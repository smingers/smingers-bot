# Helper Tools & Visualizers

This document lists all the non-core helper scripts, dashboards, and visualizers in the project. These are auxiliary tools for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing forecasts—not part of the main forecasting pipeline.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| HTML Dashboard | `python -m src.dashboard` | Static HTML dashboard to browse forecasts |
| Streamlit Dashboard | `streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py` | Interactive dashboard with filtering |
| Forecast Tracker | `python scripts/track_forecasts.py --tournament 32916` | Compare forecasts vs community consensus |
| Tool Usage Analyzer | `python scripts/analyze_tool_usage.py <path>` | Analyze research tool usage per forecast |
| Artifact Migration | `python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py` | Backfill missing database fields |

---

## Dashboards

### Static HTML Dashboard

**Location:** `src/dashboard.py`

A lightweight browser-based dashboard that lists all forecast runs with detailed drill-down views.

```bash
python -m src.dashboard [--port 8000] [--data-dir ./data]
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

**Features:**
- List view showing all forecast runs (question, type, prediction, cost)
- Detail view with full forecast breakdown (research, ensemble, aggregation)
- Markdown rendering for agent reasoning
- Computes actual percentile values from CDF for numeric questions
- Supports both old and new artifact formats

### Streamlit Dashboard

**Location:** `scripts/dashboard.py`

**Requires:** `streamlit` (install via `pip install streamlit`)

An interactive dashboard with filtering capabilities that reads from the SQLite database.

```bash
streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py
```

**Features:**
- Filter forecasts by mode (test/preview/live) and question type
- Summary metrics (total forecasts, cost, mode distribution)
- Charts showing forecast distribution by mode and type
- Agent agreement analysis for binary questions
- Raw data export

**Note:** If you see errors about missing database fields, run the migration script first:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py
```

## Analysis & Tracking

### Forecast Tracker (Consensus Comparison)

**Location:** `scripts/track_forecasts.py`

Fetches community consensus probabilities from Metaculus and compares them against your submitted forecasts. Helps identify systematic biases.

```bash
# Track all forecasts for a tournament
python scripts/track_forecasts.py --tournament 32916

# Custom output file
python scripts/track_forecasts.py --tournament 32916 --output data/tracking/spring_aib_2026.json

# Quiet mode (just save, minimal output)
python scripts/track_forecasts.py --tournament 32916 --quiet
```

**Output:**
- Per-forecast comparison (your probability vs community)
- Aggregate statistics (mean difference, over/under confidence counts)
- JSON file saved to `data/tracking/<tournament_id>.json`

**Requires:** `METACULUS_TOKEN` environment variable

### Tool Usage Analyzer

**Location:** `scripts/analyze_tool_usage.py`

Analyzes the `tool_usage.json` file generated by each forecast run to show which research tools were used and how.

```bash
python scripts/analyze_tool_usage.py data/41594_20260128_123456/tool_usage.json
```

**Output:**
- Historical and current query breakdown
- Tools used (Google, AskNews, Agentic) with result counts
- Per-agent model lineup and search activity
- Cost, token, and timing metrics (if available)

## Reports & Assessments

### Forecast Quality Assessments (Manual)

**Location:** `docs/assessments/`

A manually maintained collection of markdown-based forecast quality reviews. Each assessment grades a forecast and documents reasoning quality.

**Index page:** `docs/assessments/README.md`

**Template:** `docs/forecast_quality_assessment_template.md`

This is a manual review system, not an automated tool.

### Report Generator (Programmatic)

**Location:** `src/storage/report_generator.py`

Python module for generating markdown reports from forecast data. Used programmatically, not as a CLI tool.

```python
from src.storage.report_generator import generate_reasoning_report, ForecastData

data = ForecastData(...)
report = generate_reasoning_report(data)
```

**Functions:**
- `generate_reasoning_report(data)` - Detailed report for a single forecast
- `generate_summary_report(forecasts)` - Summary across multiple forecasts

---

## Database & Migration

### Forecast Database

**Location:** `src/storage/database.py`

SQLite database at `data/forecasts.db` storing forecast records, agent predictions, and research sources.

**Schema Tables:**
- `forecasts` - Main prediction records (question_id, timestamp, prediction, cost, etc.)
- `agent_predictions` - Individual agent outputs per forecast
- `research_sources` - Research queries and sources used

This is a library module, not a CLI tool. Access via the dashboards or programmatically:

```python
from src.storage.database import ForecastDatabase
db = ForecastDatabase("data/forecasts.db")
forecasts = await db.get_forecasts_with_agents(limit=100)
```

### Artifact Migration

**Location:** `scripts/migrate_artifacts.py`

One-time migration utility for backfilling database fields from artifact directories. Run this if you have old forecasts with incomplete database records.

```bash
# Preview changes (dry run)
python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py --dry-run

# Apply changes
python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py
```

**What it does:**
- Backfills `mode` field from `metadata.json`
- Backfills `prediction_data` JSON from prediction artifacts
- Updates agent prediction data

Safe to run multiple times (only updates rows with missing data).

## Cost Tracking

### Built-in LLM Cost Tracker

**Location:** `src/utils/llm.py`

Cost tracking is built into the LLM client—there's no separate budget checker script.

**During a forecast run:**
Costs are automatically tracked and saved to `metadata.json` in each artifact directory.

**Programmatic access:**
```python
from src.utils.llm import get_cost_tracker

tracker = get_cost_tracker()
summary = tracker.get_summary()
# Returns: {total_calls, successful_calls, failed_calls, total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens, total_cost}
```

**Model pricing table:** See `MODEL_COSTS` dict in `src/utils/llm.py`

**To check costs from artifacts:**
```bash
# View cost for a specific forecast
cat data/41594_20260128_123456/metadata.json | jq '.costs'
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No forecasts found" in dashboards

1. Check that `data/forecasts.db` exists
2. Run the migration script: `python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py`
3. Ensure you have artifact directories in `data/` with the pattern `{question_id}_{timestamp}/`

### Streamlit dashboard errors

1. Install streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
2. Run migration: `python scripts/migrate_artifacts.py`
3. Check database exists: `ls -la data/forecasts.db`

### Track forecasts rate limiting

The tracker includes built-in rate limiting (1s delay between requests) and exponential backoff for 429 errors. If you still hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again.
