# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation - Numeric Question

## Question
How old will the oldest living person be in 2100?

## Description
This question asks for an estimate of the age of the oldest living person in the year 2100, based solely on historical patterns and reference classes, without considering current events or recent news.

## Resolution Criteria
The goal is to establish a base distribution that captures the likely range of values for the age of the oldest living person in 2100, based on an analysis of historical data and relevant reference classes.

## Bounds
Lower bound: 0 , Upper bound: 100 

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), which maintains a database of verified supercentenarians (individuals who have reached the age of 110 or more). This data is considered reliable and comprehensive, as the GRG has strict verification procedures for including individuals in their records.

There may be some systematic biases in the data, as the GRG's records are limited to individuals who have been verified and reported. It's possible that there are unverified or unreported supercentenarians that are not included in the data.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Historical Longevity Records**
- Historical distribution: The oldest verified person on record was Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old. The current verified oldest living person is Kane Tanaka, who is 119 years old as of 2023.
- Sample size: The GRG database contains records for over 500 verified supercentenarians.
- Suitability score: 9/10. This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it provides historical data on the maximum ages reached by humans.
- Why this reference class: The age of the oldest living person in 2100 is likely to be within the range of historical longevity records, as these represent the upper limits of human lifespan.

**Reference Class 2: Trends in Life Expectancy**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the past century, from around 50 years in the early 1900s to over 72 years today.
- Sample size: Data on global life expectancy is available for most countries and regions over the past several decades.
- Suitability score: 7/10. While trends in life expectancy are relevant, they do not directly capture the upper limits of human lifespan.
- Why this reference class: Improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions have contributed to increases in life expectancy, which may also lead to higher maximum ages in the future.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable in this case, as we have direct reference classes to draw from.

### Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 110
Percentile 5: 112
Percentile 10: 114
Percentile 15: 115
Percentile 20: 116
Percentile 25: 117
Percentile 30: 118
Percentile 35: 119
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 45: 121
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 123
Percentile 60: 124
Percentile 65: 125
Percentile 70: 126
Percentile 75: 127
Percentile 80: 128
Percentile 85: 129
Percentile 90: 130
Percentile 95: 132
Percentile 99: 135

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for unverified or unreported supercentenarians not included in the historical data
- Possibility of future breakthroughs in longevity research or medical interventions that could extend the maximum human lifespan beyond historical precedents
