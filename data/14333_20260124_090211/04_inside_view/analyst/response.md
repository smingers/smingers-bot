**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Several studies estimate a high probability of someone living to 125-132 years by 2100, with a 68% chance of reaching 127 years and a 13% chance of reaching 130 years.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The current oldest verified person is 118 years old, and there is only a 13% chance of someone reaching 130 years by 2100 according to some projections.
- Net direction: HIGHER, with a reasonable upper bound of around 130 years.

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is relatively recent, with most sources from 2021 and early 2022. The sources appear to be credible, including academic studies, reputable news outlets, and expert commentary. There is no clear indication of significant biases in the reporting. The base distribution does not appear to fully capture the latest research on the potential for extreme longevity in the 21st century.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- Multiple independent studies estimate a high probability (68% chance) of someone reaching 127 years old by 2100, and a 13% chance of reaching 130 years old.
- There is a strong precedent for record-breaking longevity, with the current oldest verified person being 122 years old.

Moderate Evidence:
- Estimates that the world record of 122 years will "almost certainly" be broken, with a strong likelihood of at least one person living to 125-132 years.
- Projections that living past 110 is becoming more likely, with a 13% chance of reaching 130 years old.

Weak Evidence:
- Anecdotal comments about the possibility of living to 180 years old by 2100 if aided by advanced AI.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a higher distribution, with a reasonable upper bound of around 130 years. The moderate evidence further supports a shift towards higher longevity estimates. The weak evidence is not heavily weighted.

Step 4: Integration
The adjustments focus on shifting the upper percentiles higher, while keeping the lower percentiles relatively stable. The middle percentiles are adjusted upwards to maintain a smooth distribution.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles (112 and 138) appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong and moderate evidence, which indicates a significant potential for increased longevity in the 21st century.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the largest changes in the upper percentiles.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the evidence strongly suggests that the maximum human lifespan will increase significantly by 2100. The current record of 122 years is likely to be broken, with a high probability of at least one person reaching 127 years old and a reasonable possibility of someone reaching 130 years old.

This adjustment is based on the latest research and expert projections, which indicate that advances in medical technology, improved living conditions, and other factors are contributing to a steady increase in extreme longevity. While the upper bounds remain uncertain, the evidence points to a distribution that is shifted higher compared to the initial base distribution.
