**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The research indicates that the maximum human lifespan is likely to increase significantly by 2100, with estimates of the oldest person reaching 125-132 years old.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The research also suggests that the probability of someone living to 130 years old by 2100 is relatively low, around 13%.
- Net direction: HIGHER, but with uncertainty around the upper extremes.

Reasoning:

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. The base distribution provided seems to align with the general consensus that the maximum human lifespan will increase significantly by 2100. However, I believe there are some important factors to consider that could make the base rate misleading.

First, the research indicates that while the world record of 122 years is likely to be broken, the probability of someone living to 130 years old or beyond is relatively low, around 13%. This suggests that the upper end of the distribution may be skewed higher than what is realistically achievable. As a contrarian, I would want to temper the optimism reflected in the upper percentiles of the base distribution.

Additionally, the research highlights that extreme longevity will continue to rise, but there are still significant uncertainties around the pace and limits of this trend. Factors such as advances in medical technology, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic factors could all play a role in determining the maximum lifespan attained by 2100. It's important to consider that the base distribution may not fully capture these complexities and potential sources of variability.

In my adjustments, I've shifted the distribution slightly higher, but I've also narrowed the upper end to account for the relatively low probability of someone reaching 130 years old or beyond. The median estimate of 127 years is in line with the research, but I've reduced the upper percentiles to reflect the uncertainty around the extreme longevity projections.

It's important to note that my adjustments are based on the available evidence and my role as a contrarian forecaster. I've tried to balance the positive trends in longevity with the potential limitations and uncertainties that may not be fully captured in the base distribution. As with any forecasting exercise, it's crucial to remain vigilant and continuously update the analysis as new information becomes available.
