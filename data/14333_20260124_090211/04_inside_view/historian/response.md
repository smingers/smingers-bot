Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence provided is quite recent, with the majority of the sources being from 2021. The sources appear to be credible, including academic studies, news articles, and expert predictions. There does not seem to be any significant bias in the reporting, and the information is not yet fully priced into the base distribution.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence can be classified as STRONG, as it includes multiple independent sources, clear causal mechanisms, and strong historical precedents. The studies consistently indicate a high likelihood of record-breaking longevity in the 21st century, with the oldest person potentially living to 125-132 years by 2100.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a significant upward shift in the distribution, with the potential for the upper percentiles to increase by 5-10 years compared to the base distribution. The evidence also suggests a narrowing of the distribution, as the probability of reaching extreme ages becomes more certain.

Step 4: Integration
The lower percentiles (1, 5, 10) are adjusted upward by 2-3 years, reflecting the increased likelihood of reaching older ages. The middle percentiles (25, 50, 75) are adjusted upward by 5-6 years, and the upper percentiles (90, 95, 99) are adjusted upward by 6-9 years, to account for the strong evidence of record-breaking longevity.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles (112 and 141) appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are significant but justified by the strong evidence, which suggests a substantial shift in the distribution compared to the base.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing the largest changes.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I have focused on analyzing the historical precedents and patterns related to human longevity. The evidence suggests that we are entering a new era of record-breaking lifespans, with a high likelihood of the world's oldest person reaching 125-132 years by the end of the century. This is a significant shift from the past, where the oldest verified person lived to 122 years.

The historical data shows a steady increase in human longevity over the past century, driven by advancements in medical technology, public health, and living standards. The current evidence indicates that this trend is likely to accelerate, with the potential for even more dramatic increases in the coming decades.

As a historian, I believe it is important to consider the broader context and patterns that have shaped human longevity over time. The evidence suggests that we are at the cusp of a new era of extreme longevity, and the distribution should be adjusted accordingly to reflect this significant shift.
