# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation - Numeric Question

## Question
How old will the oldest living person be in 2100?

## Description
This question asks for an estimate of the age of the oldest living person in the year 2100, based solely on historical patterns and reference classes, without considering current events or recent news.

## Resolution Criteria
The goal is to establish a base distribution that captures the likely range of values for the age of the oldest living person in 2100, based on an analysis of historical data and relevant reference classes.

## Bounds
Lower bound: 0 , Upper bound: 100 

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), which maintains a database of verified supercentenarians (individuals who have reached the age of 110 or more). This data is considered reliable and comprehensive, as the GRG has strict verification procedures for including individuals in their records.

There may be some systematic biases in the data, as the GRG's records are limited to individuals who have been verified and reported. It's possible that there are unverified or unreported supercentenarians that are not included in the data.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Historical Longevity Records**
- Historical distribution: The oldest verified person on record was Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old. The current verified oldest living person is Kane Tanaka, who is 119 years old as of 2023.
- Sample size: The GRG database contains records for over 500 verified supercentenarians.
- Suitability score: 9/10. This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it provides historical data on the maximum ages reached by humans.
- Why this reference class: The age of the oldest living person in 2100 is likely to be within the range of historical longevity records, as these represent the upper limits of human lifespan.

**Reference Class 2: Trends in Life Expectancy**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the past century, from around 50 years in the early 1900s to over 72 years today.
- Sample size: Data on global life expectancy is available for most countries and regions over the past several decades.
- Suitability score: 7/10. While trends in life expectancy are relevant, they do not directly capture the upper limits of human lifespan.
- Why this reference class: Improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions have contributed to increases in life expectancy, which may also lead to higher maximum ages in the future.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable in this case, as we have direct reference classes to draw from.

### Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 110
Percentile 5: 112
Percentile 10: 114
Percentile 15: 115
Percentile 20: 116
Percentile 25: 117
Percentile 30: 118
Percentile 35: 119
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 45: 121
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 123
Percentile 60: 124
Percentile 65: 125
Percentile 70: 126
Percentile 75: 127
Percentile 80: 128
Percentile 85: 129
Percentile 90: 130
Percentile 95: 132
Percentile 99: 135

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for unverified or unreported supercentenarians not included in the historical data
- Possibility of future breakthroughs in longevity research or medical interventions that could extend the maximum human lifespan beyond historical precedents

**Prediction:** 12500.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Several studies estimate a high probability of someone living to 125-132 years by 2100, with a 68% chance of reaching 127 years and a 13% chance of reaching 130 years.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The current oldest verified person is 118 years old, and there is only a 13% chance of someone reaching 130 years by 2100 according to some projections.
- Net direction: HIGHER, with a reasonable upper bound of around 130 years.

Percentile 99: 138

**Median Estimate:** 125 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is relatively recent, with most sources from 2021 and early 2022. The sources appear to be credible, including academic studies, reputable news outlets, and expert commentary. There is no clear indication of significant biases in the reporting. The base distribution does not appear to fully capture the latest research on the potential for extreme longevity in the 21st century.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- Multiple independent studies estimate a high probability (68% chance) of someone reaching 127 years old by 2100, and a 13% chance of reaching 130 years old.
- There is a strong precedent for record-breaking longevity, with the current oldest verified person being 122 years old.

Moderate Evidence:
- Estimates that the world record of 122 years will "almost certainly" be broken, with a strong likelihood of at least one person living to 125-132 years.
- Projections that living past 110 is becoming more likely, with a 13% chance of reaching 130 years old.

Weak Evidence:
- Anecdotal comments about the possibility of living to 180 years old by 2100 if aided by advanced AI.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a higher distribution, with a reasonable upper bound of around 130 years. The moderate evidence further supports a shift towards higher longevity estimates. The weak evidence is not heavily weighted.

Step 4: Integration
The adjustments focus on shifting the upper percentiles higher, while keeping the lower percentiles relatively stable. The middle percentiles are adjusted upwards to maintain a smooth distribution.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles (112 and 138) appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong and moderate evidence, which indicates a significant potential for increased longevity in the 21st century.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the largest changes in the upper percentiles.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the evidence strongly suggests that the maximum human lifespan will increase significantly by 2100. The current record of 122 years is likely to be broken, with a high probability of at least one person reaching 127 years old and a reasonable possibility of someone reaching 130 years old.

This adjustment is based on the latest research and expert projections, which indicate that advances in medical technology, improved living conditions, and other factors are contributing to a steady increase in extreme longevity. While the upper bounds remain uncertain, the evidence points to a distribution that is shifted higher compared to the initial base distribution.

Percentile 99: 141

**Median Estimate:** 128 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence provided is quite recent, with the majority of the sources being from 2021. The sources appear to be credible, including academic studies, news articles, and expert predictions. There does not seem to be any significant bias in the reporting, and the information is not yet fully priced into the base distribution.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence can be classified as STRONG, as it includes multiple independent sources, clear causal mechanisms, and strong historical precedents. The studies consistently indicate a high likelihood of record-breaking longevity in the 21st century, with the oldest person potentially living to 125-132 years by 2100.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a significant upward shift in the distribution, with the potential for the upper percentiles to increase by 5-10 years compared to the base distribution. The evidence also suggests a narrowing of the distribution, as the probability of reaching extreme ages becomes more certain.

Step 4: Integration
The lower percentiles (1, 5, 10) are adjusted upward by 2-3 years, reflecting the increased likelihood of reaching older ages. The middle percentiles (25, 50, 75) are adjusted upward by 5-6 years, and the upper percentiles (90, 95, 99) are adjusted upward by 6-9 years, to account for the strong evidence of record-breaking longevity.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles (112 and 141) appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are significant but justified by the strong evidence, which suggests a substantial shift in the distribution compared to the base.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing the largest changes.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I have focused on analyzing the historical precedents and patterns related to human longevity. The evidence suggests that we are entering a new era of record-breaking lifespans, with a high likelihood of the world's oldest person reaching 125-132 years by the end of the century. This is a significant shift from the past, where the oldest verified person lived to 122 years.

The historical data shows a steady increase in human longevity over the past century, driven by advancements in medical technology, public health, and living standards. The current evidence indicates that this trend is likely to accelerate, with the potential for even more dramatic increases in the coming decades.

As a historian, I believe it is important to consider the broader context and patterns that have shaped human longevity over time. The evidence suggests that we are at the cusp of a new era of extreme longevity, and the distribution should be adjusted accordingly to reflect this significant shift.

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

Reasoning:

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. The base distribution provided seems to align with the general consensus that the maximum human lifespan will increase significantly by 2100. However, I believe there are some important factors to consider that could make the base rate misleading.

First, the research indicates that while the world record of 122 years is likely to be broken, the probability of someone living to 130 years old or beyond is relatively low, around 13%. This suggests that the upper end of the distribution may be skewed higher than what is realistically achievable. As a contrarian, I would want to temper the optimism reflected in the upper percentiles of the base distribution.

Additionally, the research highlights that extreme longevity will continue to rise, but there are still significant uncertainties around the pace and limits of this trend. Factors such as advances in medical technology, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic factors could all play a role in determining the maximum lifespan attained by 2100. It's important to consider that the base distribution may not fully capture these complexities and potential sources of variability.

In my adjustments, I've shifted the distribution slightly higher, but I've also narrowed the upper end to account for the relatively low probability of someone reaching 130 years old or beyond. The median estimate of 127 years is in line with the research, but I've reduced the upper percentiles to reflect the uncertainty around the extreme longevity projections.

It's important to note that my adjustments are based on the available evidence and my role as a contrarian forecaster. I've tried to balance the positive trends in longevity with the potential limitations and uncertainties that may not be fully captured in the base distribution. As with any forecasting exercise, it's crucial to remain vigilant and continuously update the analysis as new information becomes available.
