# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the historical record of the oldest living person's age. This data is maintained by organizations like the Gerontology Research Group and the Guinness World Records. The historical record appears to be reasonably comprehensive, with well-documented cases of the world's oldest people going back several decades. However, there may be some systematic biases, as the data is dependent on accurate reporting and record-keeping, which can be challenging, especially for remote or less-developed regions.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Maximum Lifespan of Humans**
- Historical distribution: The maximum verified lifespan of humans is 122 years, achieved by Jeanne Calment of France, who lived from 1875 to 1997. Other exceptionally long-lived individuals have reached ages in the 110s.
- Sample size: There are several dozen well-documented cases of people living past 110 years old.
- Suitability score: 8/10. This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it captures the upper bound of human longevity.
- Why this reference class: The maximum lifespan of humans is the most relevant and reliable reference class for estimating the age of the oldest living person in the future.

**Reference Class 2: Life Expectancy Trends**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the past century, from around 50 years in the early 1900s to over 70 years today. In some developed countries, life expectancy is now over 80 years.
- Sample size: Extensive data on global and national life expectancy trends.
- Suitability score: 7/10. While life expectancy trends are relevant, they do not directly capture the upper bound of human longevity.
- Why this reference class: Trends in life expectancy can provide useful context for understanding the potential for increases in maximum lifespan.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

Direct reference classes are available, so Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 110
Percentile 5: 112
Percentile 10: 114
Percentile 15: 115
Percentile 20: 116
Percentile 25: 117
Percentile 30: 118
Percentile 35: 119
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 45: 121
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 123
Percentile 60: 124
Percentile 65: 125
Percentile 70: 126
Percentile 75: 127
Percentile 80: 128
Percentile 85: 129
Percentile 90: 130
Percentile 95: 132
Percentile 99: 135

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for future breakthroughs in longevity research and medical technology that could extend the maximum lifespan beyond historical precedents.
- Possible biases or gaps in the historical record of the oldest living person.
- Potential for changes in environmental, social, or economic factors that could impact maximum lifespan.
