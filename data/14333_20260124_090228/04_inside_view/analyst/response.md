**Reasoning:**

Step 1: Source Analysis
The available research provides a good overview of the current state of longevity and longevity trends, with a strong focus on the record-holder Jeanne Calment and other supercentenarians. The sources are generally credible, coming from reputable organizations and publications. However, the information is mostly historical and does not provide clear forward-looking projections for the oldest living person in 2100.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence can be classified as follows:

STRONG Evidence:
- None

MODERATE Evidence:
- The longevity trends and forecasts suggest that life expectancy and the age of the oldest living person will continue to increase, but the pace and magnitude of this increase is uncertain.
- The data on the current oldest verified person (Jeanne Calment, 122 years) provides a strong historical reference point, but does not necessarily indicate that future record-holders will surpass this age.

WEAK Evidence:
- The projections and speculations about future longevity records are based on limited data and may not fully account for potential changes in medical technology, lifestyle factors, and other variables that could affect the maximum human lifespan.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The moderate evidence suggests that the distribution should be shifted slightly HIGHER, as longevity trends point to a gradual increase in the age of the oldest living person. However, the lack of strong, specific evidence makes it difficult to determine the magnitude of the shift.

Step 4: Integration
The adjustments to the distribution are relatively minor, with the lower and middle percentiles shifting up by a few years, and the upper percentiles shifting up by a slightly larger amount. This reflects the uncertainty around the pace of longevity increases and the potential for future record-holders to surpass the current maximum age.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles appear to be reasonable bounds, given the historical data and the moderate evidence for continued longevity increases.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments made are relatively small and can be justified by the available evidence.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, which is moderate.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have focused on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments related to longevity and the age of the oldest living person. The available evidence suggests that longevity will continue to increase, but the pace and magnitude of this increase are uncertain. While the record-holder Jeanne Calment lived to 122 years, it is unclear whether future record-holders will surpass this age by 2100.

Given the moderate evidence and the inherent uncertainty in long-term projections, I have made relatively minor adjustments to the base distribution, shifting the lower and middle percentiles up by a few years and the upper percentiles up by a slightly larger amount. This reflects my assessment that the age of the oldest living person in 2100 is likely to be somewhat higher than the base distribution, but not dramatically so.

My confidence in this adjustment is moderate (6 out of 10), as the available evidence is limited and does not provide a clear, unambiguous signal for the future trajectory of longevity records. I will continue to monitor developments in this area and update my assessment accordingly.
