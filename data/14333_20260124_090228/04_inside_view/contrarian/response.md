Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The sources provide strong evidence that Jeanne Calment's exceptional longevity of 122 years is the current record for the oldest verified person. However, this may be an outlier, and future longevity gains may be more modest. The information is recent and credible, coming from reputable sources like Wikipedia, scientific journals, and media outlets.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence that Jeanne Calment's longevity may be an outlier and that future longevity gains may be more modest is classified as STRONG, as it is supported by multiple independent sources and has a clear causal mechanism (i.e., the difficulty of replicating such an extreme outlier).

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence suggests that the distribution should be shifted LOWER, as the base distribution may be too optimistic in its upper percentiles. The magnitude of the shift is approximately 5-10% based on the potential for more modest longevity gains in the future.

Step 4: Integration
The lower percentiles (1, 5, 10) are adjusted downward by around 5 units to reflect the potential for more modest longevity gains. The middle percentiles (25, 50, 75) are adjusted downward by around 5-10 units, as the upper end of the distribution is likely to be affected more significantly. The upper percentiles (90, 95, 99) are adjusted downward by around 5-10 units to account for the possibility of Jeanne Calment's longevity being an outlier.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles are within reasonable bounds (105 and 130, respectively).
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are not overly large compared to the base distribution, and the reasoning is justified by the evidence.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The percentiles are monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base distribution may be too optimistic in its upper percentiles. While Jeanne Calment's exceptional longevity of 122 years is the current record, this may be an outlier, and future longevity gains may be more modest. The evidence suggests that the distribution should be shifted LOWER, with the upper percentiles affected more significantly. This reflects the potential for more modest longevity gains in the future and the possibility that Jeanne Calment's longevity is an outlier that may be difficult to replicate.
