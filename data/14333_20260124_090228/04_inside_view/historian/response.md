**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Longevity trends and forecasts indicate continued increases in life expectancy, with the potential for some deceleration in the rate of increase.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: Historical precedent shows that the longest verified human lifespan has been 122 years, and there are no clear indications that this record will be significantly surpassed in the near future.
- Net direction: UNCERTAIN, with potential for a modest increase in the upper percentiles.

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources being from the past 5 years. The sources appear to be credible, including academic publications, reputable news outlets, and government/industry reports. There does not seem to be significant bias in the reporting, and the information is generally consistent across the sources.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- Longevity trends and forecasts indicate continued increases in life expectancy, with the potential for some deceleration in the rate of increase. This is supported by multiple independent sources, including academic publications and industry reports.
- Historical precedent shows that the longest verified human lifespan has been 122 years, and there are no clear indications that this record will be significantly surpassed in the near future. This is a well-established fact with strong precedent.

Moderate Evidence:
- None identified.

Weak Evidence:
- None identified.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence pointing higher suggests a potential modest increase in the upper percentiles, as longevity trends continue to improve. However, the historical precedent of 122 years as the longest verified lifespan acts as a constraint, limiting the extent of the upward adjustment.

The strong evidence pointing lower, based on the historical precedent, suggests that the distribution should not be shifted significantly higher, as there is no clear indication that the current record will be substantially surpassed in the near future.

Step 4: Integration
Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Minimal or no adjustment, as the historical precedent and longevity trends do not indicate a significant shift in the lower end of the distribution.
Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Modest upward adjustment, reflecting the overall positive trend in longevity, but constrained by the historical precedent.
Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Slightly more pronounced upward adjustment, as the longevity trends may have a greater impact on the upper end of the distribution, but still limited by the historical precedent.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles appear to be reasonable bounds, with the 99th percentile still below the historical record of 122 years.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments made are relatively modest, with the median estimate increasing by only 1 year compared to the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the stronger evidence pointing higher resulting in a more pronounced upward shift in the upper percentiles.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I focus on analyzing historical precedents and patterns to inform my probability estimate. The key historical fact is that the longest verified human lifespan is 122 years, set by Jeanne Calment in France. While longevity trends and forecasts indicate continued increases in life expectancy, there is no clear evidence that this record will be significantly surpassed in the near future.

Considering the strong historical precedent and the potential for some deceleration in the rate of longevity increase, I believe a modest upward adjustment to the distribution is warranted, particularly in the upper percentiles. However, I am hesitant to shift the distribution too far beyond the historical record, as there is still significant uncertainty around the potential for future breakthroughs in longevity.

My adjusted distribution reflects these considerations, with a median estimate of 121 years and a slightly higher upper percentile range, but still constrained by the historical precedent. I have a moderate level of confidence in this adjustment, as the evidence is generally supportive of a modest increase, but the historical precedent remains a significant factor.
