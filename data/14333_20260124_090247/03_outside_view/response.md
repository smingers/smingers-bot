# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group, which maintains a database of the oldest verified living people. This is a reliable and comprehensive source, as they carefully verify the ages of individuals claimed to be the oldest living person. However, there may be some systematic biases, as the data is limited to only those individuals who have been verified, and there may be some underreporting of very old individuals in certain regions.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Oldest Verified Living Persons**
- Historical distribution: The oldest verified living person has ranged from around 115 to 122 years old over the past century.
- Sample size: The Gerontology Research Group has verified the ages of several hundred individuals who have reached 110 years or older.
- Suitability score: 9/10. This is the most directly relevant reference class for this question.
- Why this reference class: The age of the oldest living person is the most direct and relevant data for this question.

**Reference Class 2: Longevity Trends**
- Historical distribution: Life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the past century, with the maximum age reached by individuals also increasing.
- Sample size: Global life expectancy data is available for the past several decades.
- Suitability score: 7/10. This reference class provides useful context, but is less directly relevant than the first.
- Why this reference class: Trends in longevity and life expectancy can inform our understanding of the potential for further increases in the maximum age reached by individuals.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

There are sufficient direct reference classes available, so a Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 115
Percentile 5: 116
Percentile 10: 117
Percentile 15: 118
Percentile 20: 119
Percentile 25: 120
Percentile 30: 120
Percentile 35: 121
Percentile 40: 121
Percentile 45: 122
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 122
Percentile 60: 122
Percentile 65: 122
Percentile 70: 122
Percentile 75: 122
Percentile 80: 122
Percentile 85: 122
Percentile 90: 122
Percentile 95: 122
Percentile 99: 122

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 8/10

The Gerontology Research Group data provides a high-quality, comprehensive historical record of the oldest verified living persons, which is the most directly relevant reference class for this question. The longevity trend data also provides useful context. While there may be some systematic biases in the data, the overall confidence in this base distribution is high.

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for future breakthroughs in longevity research and medical technology that could extend the maximum age reached by individuals beyond historical precedent.
- Possible underreporting or lack of verification of the ages of the very oldest individuals in certain regions.
- The potential impact of future global events, such as pandemics or environmental changes, on longevity trends.
