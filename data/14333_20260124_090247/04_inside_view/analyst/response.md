**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: 
  - Multiple sources confirm Jeanne Calment as the oldest verified person at 122 years, providing a clear historical precedent for exceptional human longevity.
  - Longevity experts cite factors like Calment's active lifestyle, healthy diet, and strong social connections as contributing to her extreme lifespan, suggesting these could be replicated to some degree.
  - Projections from demographic research indicate a 44% probability of someone living to at least 128 years by 2100, and a 13% probability of reaching 130 years.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER:
  - None
- Net direction: HIGHER

Reasoning:

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the available evidence on the potential for extreme human longevity by 2100. The key factors that inform my analysis are:

1. Strong historical precedent: The case of Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years, demonstrates that humans can potentially achieve lifespans well beyond the current norms. This suggests the base distribution may be underestimating the upper bounds of longevity.

2. Longevity factors: Experts have identified lifestyle factors like active living, healthy diet, and strong social connections as contributors to Calment's extreme lifespan. If these factors can be replicated more widely, it could lead to a shift in the distribution towards higher ages.

3. Demographic projections: A recent study using Bayesian population modeling estimates a 44% probability of someone living to at least 128 years by 2100, and a 13% probability of reaching 130 years. This lends strong support to the potential for the upper percentiles to shift higher.

Based on this evidence, I have adjusted the distribution as follows:

- The lower percentiles (1st-25th) have been shifted upwards by 1-2 years, reflecting the historical precedent and potential for longevity improvements to benefit a wider population.
- The middle percentiles (25th-75th) have been shifted upwards by 3-6 years, to account for a more substantial increase in average lifespan.
- The upper percentiles (75th-99th) have been shifted upwards by 5-10 years, to capture the possibility of exceptional longevity breakthroughs that could push the maximum lifespan significantly higher.

This adjustment maintains a monotonically increasing distribution and keeps the 1st and 99th percentiles within reasonable bounds. The median estimate of 126 years represents a substantial increase from the base distribution, but is justified by the strong evidence pointing towards higher lifespans.

Overall, I have high confidence in this adjustment, as it is grounded in historical precedent, expert analysis of longevity factors, and rigorous demographic projections. While uncertainty remains, the potential for extreme human longevity by 2100 appears to be underestimated in the base distribution.
