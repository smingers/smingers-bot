**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: None
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The record for the oldest verified person is 122 years, set by Jeanne Calment in France. This suggests that the upper bound of the distribution may be too high.
- Net direction: LOWER

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots in the base distribution. The key piece of evidence that stands out is the verified record for the oldest person, Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years old. This suggests that the upper bound of 122 years for the 99th percentile in the base distribution may be too high.

While there is strong evidence that life expectancy and maximum lifespan will continue to increase due to advancements in medicine and technology, the historical record also shows that there are limits to human longevity. Jeanne Calment's age of 122 years has stood as the verified record for over 25 years, and no one has come close to surpassing it since.

This leads me to believe that the upper end of the distribution should be adjusted downward slightly, with the 99th percentile capped at 122 years. The lower and middle percentiles can remain largely unchanged, as the base distribution seems reasonable in those ranges.

Overall, I have high confidence in this adjustment, as it is grounded in the historical evidence and the recognition that there may be inherent biological limits to human lifespan that cannot be easily overcome, even with continued medical progress. By taking a contrarian view and challenging the base assumptions, I believe this adjusted distribution better reflects the current state of knowledge and the potential risks and uncertainties around maximum lifespan in the future.
