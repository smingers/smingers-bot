**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The historical precedent of Jeanne Calment, the oldest verified person who lived to 122 years old, suggests that lifespans beyond 120 years are possible. Additionally, some studies have projected increasing probabilities of people living to 126, 128, or even 130 years by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: While there have been a few verified cases of people living past 120 years, these are still very rare occurrences. The majority of the population is unlikely to reach such extreme longevity, and future life expectancy projections suggest more modest gains in average lifespan.
- Net direction: UNCERTAIN, with the potential for a slight upward shift in the upper tail of the distribution.

Reasoning:

As a historian, I focused on analyzing the historical precedents and patterns of human longevity to inform my probability estimates. The case of Jeanne Calment, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days, is a remarkable outlier that demonstrates the potential for individuals to exceed the typical lifespan. This strong evidence suggests that the upper tail of the distribution could be shifted slightly higher, with increased probabilities of people living to 126, 128, or even 130 years by the year 2100.

However, it's important to note that such extreme longevity cases are still very rare, and the majority of the population is unlikely to reach such extreme ages. The base distribution already reflects a relatively high upper bound, and future life expectancy projections suggest more modest gains in average lifespan, with potential declines due to factors like climate change.

Therefore, I have made a relatively small upward adjustment to the upper percentiles (75th and above), while keeping the lower and middle percentiles largely unchanged. This reflects the uncertainty and the fact that the base distribution already incorporates a significant degree of longevity potential.

In terms of the specific adjustments:
- Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): No change, as there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant shift in the lower end of the distribution.
- Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Slight upward shift, with the 75th percentile increasing from 122 to 123, to account for the possibility of more individuals reaching extreme ages.
- Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Slightly higher upward shift, with the 90th percentile increasing from 122 to 124, the 95th percentile from 122 to 124, and the 99th percentile from 122 to 125. This reflects the historical precedent and the potential for a small number of individuals to exceed the typical lifespan.

The resulting distribution maintains a monotonically increasing pattern, with the median estimate remaining at 122 years. The extremity check suggests that the 1st and 99th percentiles are reasonable bounds, and the adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence.

Overall, as a historian, I believe this adjusted distribution reflects the current understanding of human longevity, while acknowledging the potential for rare, exceptional cases to emerge in the future.
