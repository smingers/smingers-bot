# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group, which maintains a database of the oldest verified living people. This is a reliable and comprehensive source, as they carefully verify the ages of individuals claimed to be the oldest living person. However, there may be some systematic biases, as the data is limited to only those individuals who have been verified, and there may be some underreporting of very old individuals in certain regions.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Oldest Verified Living Persons**
- Historical distribution: The oldest verified living person has ranged from around 115 to 122 years old over the past century.
- Sample size: The Gerontology Research Group has verified the ages of several hundred individuals who have reached 110 years or older.
- Suitability score: 9/10. This is the most directly relevant reference class for this question.
- Why this reference class: The age of the oldest living person is the most direct and relevant data for this question.

**Reference Class 2: Longevity Trends**
- Historical distribution: Life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the past century, with the maximum age reached by individuals also increasing.
- Sample size: Global life expectancy data is available for the past several decades.
- Suitability score: 7/10. This reference class provides useful context, but is less directly relevant than the first.
- Why this reference class: Trends in longevity and life expectancy can inform our understanding of the potential for further increases in the maximum age reached by individuals.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

There are sufficient direct reference classes available, so a Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 115
Percentile 5: 116
Percentile 10: 117
Percentile 15: 118
Percentile 20: 119
Percentile 25: 120
Percentile 30: 120
Percentile 35: 121
Percentile 40: 121
Percentile 45: 122
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 122

Percentile 80: 122
Percentile 85: 122
Percentile 90: 122
Percentile 95: 122
Percentile 99: 122

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 8/10

The Gerontology Research Group data provides a high-quality, comprehensive historical record of the oldest verified living persons, which is the most directly relevant reference class for this question. The longevity trend data also provides useful context. While there may be some systematic biases in the data, the overall confidence in this base distribution is high.

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for future breakthroughs in longevity research and medical technology that could extend the maximum age reached by individuals beyond historical precedent.
- Possible underreporting or lack of verification of the ages of the very oldest individuals in certain regions.
- The potential impact of future global events, such as pandemics or environmental changes, on longevity trends.

Reasoning:

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the available evidence on the potential for extreme human longevity by 2100. The key factors that inform my analysis are:

1. Strong historical precedent: The case of Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years, demonstrates that humans can potentially achieve lifespans well beyond the current norms. This suggests the base distribution may be underestimating the upper bounds of longevity.

2. Longevity factors: Experts have identified lifestyle factors like active living, healthy diet, and strong social connections as contributors to Calment's extreme lifespan. If these factors can be replicated more widely, it could lead to a shift in the distribution towards higher ages.

3. Demographic projections: A recent study using Bayesian population modeling estimates a 44% probability of someone living to at least 128 years by 2100, and a 13% probability of reaching 130 years. This lends strong support to the potential for the upper percentiles to shift higher.

Based on this evidence, I have adjusted the distribution as follows:

- The lower percentiles (1st-25th) have been shifted upwards by 1-2 years, reflecting the historical precedent and potential for longevity improvements to benefit a wider population.
- The middle percentiles (25th-75th) have been shifted upwards by 3-6 years, to account for a more substantial increase in average lifespan.
- The upper percentiles (75th-99th) have been shifted upwards by 5-10 years, to capture the possibility of exceptional longevity breakthroughs that could push the maximum lifespan significantly higher.

This adjustment maintains a monotonically increasing distribution and keeps the 1st and 99th percentiles within reasonable bounds. The median estimate of 126 years represents a substantial increase from the base distribution, but is justified by the strong evidence pointing towards higher lifespans.

Overall, I have high confidence in this adjustment, as it is grounded in historical precedent, expert analysis of longevity factors, and rigorous demographic projections. While uncertainty remains, the potential for extreme human longevity by 2100 appears to be underestimated in the base distribution.

**Prediction:** 12200.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The historical precedent of Jeanne Calment, the oldest verified person who lived to 122 years old, suggests that lifespans beyond 120 years are possible. Additionally, some studies have projected increasing probabilities of people living to 126, 128, or even 130 years by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: While there have been a few verified cases of people living past 120 years, these are still very rare occurrences. The majority of the population is unlikely to reach such extreme longevity, and future life expectancy projections suggest more modest gains in average lifespan.
- Net direction: UNCERTAIN, with the potential for a slight upward shift in the upper tail of the distribution.

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 115
Percentile 5: 116
Percentile 10: 117
Percentile 15: 118
Percentile 20: 119
Percentile 25: 120

Percentile 90: 124
Percentile 95: 124
Percentile 99: 125

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7

Reasoning:

As a historian, I focused on analyzing the historical precedents and patterns of human longevity to inform my probability estimates. The case of Jeanne Calment, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days, is a remarkable outlier that demonstrates the potential for individuals to exceed the typical lifespan. This strong evidence suggests that the upper tail of the distribution could be shifted slightly higher, with increased probabilities of people living to 126, 128, or even 130 years by the year 2100.

However, it's important to note that such extreme longevity cases are still very rare, and the majority of the population is unlikely to reach such extreme ages. The base distribution already reflects a relatively high upper bound, and future life expectancy projections suggest more modest gains in average lifespan, with potential declines due to factors like climate change.

Therefore, I have made a relatively small upward adjustment to the upper percentiles (75th and above), while keeping the lower and middle percentiles largely unchanged. This reflects the uncertainty and the fact that the base distribution already incorporates a significant degree of longevity potential.

In terms of the specific adjustments:
- Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): No change, as there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant shift in the lower end of the distribution.
- Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Slight upward shift, with the 75th percentile increasing from 122 to 123, to account for the possibility of more individuals reaching extreme ages.
- Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Slightly higher upward shift, with the 90th percentile increasing from 122 to 124, the 95th percentile from 122 to 124, and the 99th percentile from 122 to 125. This reflects the historical precedent and the potential for a small number of individuals to exceed the typical lifespan.

The resulting distribution maintains a monotonically increasing pattern, with the median estimate remaining at 122 years. The extremity check suggests that the 1st and 99th percentiles are reasonable bounds, and the adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence.

Overall, as a historian, I believe this adjusted distribution reflects the current understanding of human longevity, while acknowledging the potential for rare, exceptional cases to emerge in the future.

Percentile 99: 122

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots in the base distribution. The key piece of evidence that stands out is the verified record for the oldest person, Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years old. This suggests that the upper bound of 122 years for the 99th percentile in the base distribution may be too high.

While there is strong evidence that life expectancy and maximum lifespan will continue to increase due to advancements in medicine and technology, the historical record also shows that there are limits to human longevity. Jeanne Calment's age of 122 years has stood as the verified record for over 25 years, and no one has come close to surpassing it since.

This leads me to believe that the upper end of the distribution should be adjusted downward slightly, with the 99th percentile capped at 122 years. The lower and middle percentiles can remain largely unchanged, as the base distribution seems reasonable in those ranges.

Overall, I have high confidence in this adjustment, as it is grounded in the historical evidence and the recognition that there may be inherent biological limits to human lifespan that cannot be easily overcome, even with continued medical progress. By taking a contrarian view and challenging the base assumptions, I believe this adjusted distribution better reflects the current state of knowledge and the potential risks and uncertainties around maximum lifespan in the future.
