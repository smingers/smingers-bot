# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group, which maintains a database of the oldest living people. This is a reliable and comprehensive source, as they carefully verify the ages of individuals. However, there may be some systematic biases, as the data is limited to only the very oldest people and may not fully capture the full distribution of lifespans.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Maximum Recorded Lifespan**
- Historical distribution: The maximum recorded lifespan is currently 122 years, set by Jeanne Calment of France.
- Sample size: There is a single data point for the maximum recorded lifespan.
- Suitability score: 7/10. This provides a useful upper bound, but does not capture the full distribution.
- Why this reference class: The maximum recorded lifespan sets a hard upper limit on what is biologically possible.

**Reference Class 2: Supercentenarian Lifespans**
- Historical distribution: Supercentenarians (people 110 years or older) have lifespans ranging from 110 to 122 years.
- Sample size: There are around 600 verified supercentenarians in the historical record.
- Suitability score: 8/10. This provides a good representation of the upper end of the lifespan distribution.
- Why this reference class: Supercentenarians represent the longest-lived individuals, which is directly relevant to the question.

**Reference Class 3: Life Expectancy Trends**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has increased from around 30 years in 1900 to over 70 years today, with significant variation by country.
- Sample size: Extensive data on global life expectancy trends.
- Suitability score: 6/10. This provides context on overall lifespan trends, but does not directly address the upper end.
- Why this reference class: Understanding broader lifespan trends can inform expectations for the future.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

Direct reference classes are available, so Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 110
Percentile 5: 112
Percentile 10: 114
Percentile 15: 115
Percentile 20: 116
Percentile 25: 117
Percentile 30: 118
Percentile 35: 119
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 45: 120
Percentile 50: 121
Percentile 55: 121
Percentile 60: 121
Percentile 65: 122
Percentile 70: 122
Percentile 75: 122
Percentile 80: 122
Percentile 85: 122
Percentile 90: 122
Percentile 95: 122
Percentile 99: 122

**Median Estimate:** 121 years

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The maximum recorded lifespan may not represent the true biological limit, as there could be even longer-lived individuals that have not been documented.
- The rate of future lifespan increases is uncertain, as it depends on medical and technological advancements.
- There may be unknown factors that could significantly impact the maximum lifespan in the future.
