**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The record for the oldest verified person ever is Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. This suggests the upper bound of the distribution could be higher than 122 years.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The majority of evidence suggests that while maximum lifespans may increase, it is unlikely to quadruple in the next 100 years as some speculative forecasts have suggested. Longevity experts generally estimate the maximum human lifespan will be in the range of 125-132 years by 2100.
- Net direction: HIGHER, but with an upper bound likely below 132 years.

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is generally recent, with most sources from the past 2-3 years. The sources appear credible, coming from reputable academic institutions, media outlets, and longevity experts. There does not seem to be significant bias in the reporting. The base distribution provided likely does not fully capture the latest evidence on increasing maximum lifespans.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- The record for the oldest verified person ever is Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. This sets a clear precedent and upper bound.
- Multiple credible sources estimate the maximum human lifespan will likely reach 125-132 years by 2100, based on statistical modeling and longevity trends.

Moderate Evidence: 
- Some speculative forecasts suggest life expectancy could quadruple by 2100, reaching 292 years on average. However, this is not supported by the majority of evidence.
- UN projections show continued increases in life expectancy, but not to the extreme levels suggested by some outlier forecasts.

Weak Evidence:
- Anecdotal reports of individuals living past 122 years, which have not been independently verified.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to an upward shift in the distribution, with the upper bound likely in the range of 125-132 years. This reflects the potential for maximum lifespans to increase, but not to the extreme speculative levels.

Step 4: Integration
Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Shift upward by 2-3 years, reflecting the general trend of increasing longevity.
Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Shift upward by 3-5 years, with the median reaching 123 years.
Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Shift upward by 5-10 years, with the 99th percentile reaching 133 years.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 133 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds given the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are generally moderate, with the median only increasing by 2 years from the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with larger updates for the stronger evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The percentiles are increasing monotonically.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the evidence points to a modest upward shift in the distribution of maximum human lifespans by 2100. The record of 122 years set by Jeanne Calment provides a clear upper bound, and longevity experts generally estimate the maximum lifespan will reach 125-132 years by the end of the century. While some speculative forecasts suggest more extreme increases, the majority of the evidence does not support such dramatic changes in the near future. My adjusted distribution reflects these trends, with the median increasing to 123 years and the upper percentiles reaching the 125-132 year range. I have a high degree of confidence in this assessment, given the strength and recency of the supporting evidence.
