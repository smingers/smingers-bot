**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The research indicates that the world record for the oldest verified person (122 years) is likely to be broken in the 21st century, with some projections suggesting a possibility of someone living up to 132 years by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: There is no clear evidence suggesting the base distribution is significantly underestimating the potential for extreme longevity.
- Net direction: HIGHER, with a potential for the distribution to shift upwards.

**Reasoning:**

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence from the research is relatively recent, with multiple credible sources (e.g., academic publications, reputable news outlets) reporting on the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century. The information does not appear to be priced into the base distribution, which caps the oldest living person at 122 years.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence is classified as STRONG, as it comes from multiple independent sources, demonstrates a clear causal mechanism (scientific advances in longevity), and has strong precedent (the current record holder, Jeanne Calment, lived to 122 years).

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, with the potential for the upper percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th) to increase significantly. There is also a moderate widening of the distribution, as the uncertainty around the maximum lifespan increases.

Step 4: Integration
The lower percentiles (1st, 5th, 10th) are only moderately affected, as the base distribution already accounts for a relatively high lifespan. The middle percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) see a more pronounced upward shift, reflecting the increased potential for longer lifespans. The upper percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th) are adjusted the most, to account for the possibility of someone living up to 132 years by 2100.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 133 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds based on the available evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong evidence indicating the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing the largest increases.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile value being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base distribution may be underestimating the potential for extreme longevity in the 21st century. The research indicates that the current record of 122 years is likely to be broken, with a strong possibility of someone living up to 132 years by 2100. This is a significant departure from the base distribution, which caps the oldest living person at 122 years.

While the lower and middle percentiles are only moderately affected, the upper percentiles see a more pronounced upward shift to account for the increased potential for record-breaking longevity. This adjustment is justified by the strong evidence from multiple credible sources, which suggests that scientific advances in longevity research and improved healthcare may lead to a breakthrough in the maximum human lifespan.

Overall, I believe the adjusted distribution better reflects the current evidence and the potential for extreme longevity in the coming decades.
