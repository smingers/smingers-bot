**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Several sources indicate that the world record for oldest verified person (122 years set by Jeanne Calment) is likely to be broken in the 21st century, with some projections suggesting a 130-year lifespan may be possible by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: No strong evidence pointing lower.
- Net direction: HIGHER

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is quite recent, with multiple credible sources (e.g. academic studies, reputable news outlets) reporting on the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century. The information does not appear to be fully priced into the base distribution, which caps the 99th percentile at 122 years.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence on the potential to exceed the current longevity record of 122 years is classified as STRONG, as it comes from multiple independent sources and has a clear causal mechanism (advances in medicine, technology, and living standards).

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, with the potential to reach lifespans of 130 years or more by 2100. This evidence also suggests a WIDER distribution, as the upper bounds of human lifespan become less certain.

Step 4: Integration
The higher and wider distribution shifts the entire curve upwards, with the largest impacts on the upper percentiles. The lower percentiles are adjusted upwards to a lesser degree, as the historical precedent of Jeanne Calment's 122-year lifespan still anchors the lower end of the distribution.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 136 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong evidence on the potential to exceed the current longevity record.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing larger increases.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I believe the evidence on historical precedents and analogous situations is crucial in informing this probability estimate. The fact that Jeanne Calment lived to 122 years, a feat that was previously thought to be impossible, suggests that human longevity limits may be higher than previously believed. The current research indicates a strong likelihood that this record will be broken in the 21st century, with some projections suggesting a 130-year lifespan may be possible by 2100.

By considering historical patterns and the potential for continued advancements in medicine, technology, and living standards, I have adjusted the distribution upwards, with the largest increases in the upper percentiles. This reflects the growing uncertainty around the true limits of human lifespan, while still anchoring the lower end of the distribution to the historical precedent set by Jeanne Calment.
