**Reasoning:**
# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the Gerontology Research Group, which maintains a database of the oldest living people. This is a reliable and comprehensive source, as they carefully verify the ages of individuals. However, there may be some systematic biases, as the data is limited to only the very oldest people and may not fully capture the full distribution of lifespans.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Maximum Recorded Lifespan**
- Historical distribution: The maximum recorded lifespan is currently 122 years, set by Jeanne Calment of France.
- Sample size: There is a single data point for the maximum recorded lifespan.
- Suitability score: 7/10. This provides a useful upper bound, but does not capture the full distribution.
- Why this reference class: The maximum recorded lifespan sets a hard upper limit on what is biologically possible.

**Reference Class 2: Supercentenarian Lifespans**
- Historical distribution: Supercentenarians (people 110 years or older) have lifespans ranging from 110 to 122 years.
- Sample size: There are around 600 verified supercentenarians in the historical record.
- Suitability score: 8/10. This provides a good representation of the upper end of the lifespan distribution.
- Why this reference class: Supercentenarians represent the longest-lived individuals, which is directly relevant to the question.

**Reference Class 3: Life Expectancy Trends**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has increased from around 30 years in 1900 to over 70 years today, with significant variation by country.
- Sample size: Extensive data on global life expectancy trends.
- Suitability score: 6/10. This provides context on overall lifespan trends, but does not directly address the upper end.
- Why this reference class: Understanding broader lifespan trends can inform expectations for the future.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

Direct reference classes are available, so Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

### analyst (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
**Prediction:** 12300.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The record for the oldest verified person ever is Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. This suggests the upper bound of the distribution could be higher than 122 years.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: The majority of evidence suggests that while maximum lifespans may increase, it is unlikely to quadruple in the next 100 years as some speculative forecasts have suggested. Longevity experts generally estimate the maximum human lifespan will be in the range of 125-132 years by 2100.
- Net direction: HIGHER, but with an upper bound likely below 132 years.

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 112
Percentile 5: 114 
Percentile 10: 115
Percentile 15: 116

Percentile 80: 129
Percentile 85: 130
Percentile 90: 131
Percentile 95: 132
Percentile 99: 133

**Median Estimate:** 123 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is generally recent, with most sources from the past 2-3 years. The sources appear credible, coming from reputable academic institutions, media outlets, and longevity experts. There does not seem to be significant bias in the reporting. The base distribution provided likely does not fully capture the latest evidence on increasing maximum lifespans.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- The record for the oldest verified person ever is Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. This sets a clear precedent and upper bound.
- Multiple credible sources estimate the maximum human lifespan will likely reach 125-132 years by 2100, based on statistical modeling and longevity trends.

Moderate Evidence: 
- Some speculative forecasts suggest life expectancy could quadruple by 2100, reaching 292 years on average. However, this is not supported by the majority of evidence.
- UN projections show continued increases in life expectancy, but not to the extreme levels suggested by some outlier forecasts.

Weak Evidence:
- Anecdotal reports of individuals living past 122 years, which have not been independently verified.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to an upward shift in the distribution, with the upper bound likely in the range of 125-132 years. This reflects the potential for maximum lifespans to increase, but not to the extreme speculative levels.

Step 4: Integration
Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Shift upward by 2-3 years, reflecting the general trend of increasing longevity.
Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Shift upward by 3-5 years, with the median reaching 123 years.
Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Shift upward by 5-10 years, with the 99th percentile reaching 133 years.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 133 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds given the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are generally moderate, with the median only increasing by 2 years from the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with larger updates for the stronger evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The percentiles are increasing monotonically.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the evidence points to a modest upward shift in the distribution of maximum human lifespans by 2100. The record of 122 years set by Jeanne Calment provides a clear upper bound, and longevity experts generally estimate the maximum lifespan will reach 125-132 years by the end of the century. While some speculative forecasts suggest more extreme increases, the majority of the evidence does not support such dramatic changes in the near future. My adjusted distribution reflects these trends, with the median increasing to 123 years and the upper percentiles reaching the 125-132 year range. I have a high degree of confidence in this assessment, given the strength and recency of the supporting evidence.

### historian (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
**Prediction:** 12400.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Several sources indicate that the world record for oldest verified person (122 years set by Jeanne Calment) is likely to be broken in the 21st century, with some projections suggesting a 130-year lifespan may be possible by 2100.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: No strong evidence pointing lower.
- Net direction: HIGHER

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 112
Percentile 5: 114 
Percentile 10: 116
Percentile 15: 117
Percentile 20: 118
Percentile 25: 119

Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 85: 131
Percentile 90: 132
Percentile 95: 134
Percentile 99: 136

**Median Estimate:** 124 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is quite recent, with multiple credible sources (e.g. academic studies, reputable news outlets) reporting on the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century. The information does not appear to be fully priced into the base distribution, which caps the 99th percentile at 122 years.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence on the potential to exceed the current longevity record of 122 years is classified as STRONG, as it comes from multiple independent sources and has a clear causal mechanism (advances in medicine, technology, and living standards).

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, with the potential to reach lifespans of 130 years or more by 2100. This evidence also suggests a WIDER distribution, as the upper bounds of human lifespan become less certain.

Step 4: Integration
The higher and wider distribution shifts the entire curve upwards, with the largest impacts on the upper percentiles. The lower percentiles are adjusted upwards to a lesser degree, as the historical precedent of Jeanne Calment's 122-year lifespan still anchors the lower end of the distribution.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 136 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds based on the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong evidence on the potential to exceed the current longevity record.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing larger increases.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I believe the evidence on historical precedents and analogous situations is crucial in informing this probability estimate. The fact that Jeanne Calment lived to 122 years, a feat that was previously thought to be impossible, suggests that human longevity limits may be higher than previously believed. The current research indicates a strong likelihood that this record will be broken in the 21st century, with some projections suggesting a 130-year lifespan may be possible by 2100.

By considering historical patterns and the potential for continued advancements in medicine, technology, and living standards, I have adjusted the distribution upwards, with the largest increases in the upper percentiles. This reflects the growing uncertainty around the true limits of human lifespan, while still anchoring the lower end of the distribution to the historical precedent set by Jeanne Calment.

Percentile 90: 131
Percentile 95: 132
Percentile 99: 133

**Median Estimate:** 123 years

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

**Reasoning:**

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence from the research is relatively recent, with multiple credible sources (e.g., academic publications, reputable news outlets) reporting on the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century. The information does not appear to be priced into the base distribution, which caps the oldest living person at 122 years.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence is classified as STRONG, as it comes from multiple independent sources, demonstrates a clear causal mechanism (scientific advances in longevity), and has strong precedent (the current record holder, Jeanne Calment, lived to 122 years).

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, with the potential for the upper percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th) to increase significantly. There is also a moderate widening of the distribution, as the uncertainty around the maximum lifespan increases.

Step 4: Integration
The lower percentiles (1st, 5th, 10th) are only moderately affected, as the base distribution already accounts for a relatively high lifespan. The middle percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) see a more pronounced upward shift, reflecting the increased potential for longer lifespans. The upper percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th) are adjusted the most, to account for the possibility of someone living up to 132 years by 2100.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 112 and 133 years, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds based on the available evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are justified by the strong evidence indicating the potential for record-breaking longevity in the 21st century.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the upper percentiles seeing the largest increases.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile value being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base distribution may be underestimating the potential for extreme longevity in the 21st century. The research indicates that the current record of 122 years is likely to be broken, with a strong possibility of someone living up to 132 years by 2100. This is a significant departure from the base distribution, which caps the oldest living person at 122 years.

While the lower and middle percentiles are only moderately affected, the upper percentiles see a more pronounced upward shift to account for the increased potential for record-breaking longevity. This adjustment is justified by the strong evidence from multiple credible sources, which suggests that scientific advances in longevity research and improved healthcare may lead to a breakthrough in the maximum human lifespan.

Overall, I believe the adjusted distribution better reflects the current evidence and the potential for extreme longevity in the coming decades.
