# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the historical record of the oldest living person's age. This data is collected and maintained by various longevity research organizations, such as the Gerontology Research Group and the Guinness World Records. The historical record is generally reliable and comprehensive, as the age of the oldest living person is a well-documented and high-profile statistic. However, there may be some systematic biases in the data, as the identification and verification of the oldest living person can be challenging, especially in remote or less-developed regions.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Longevity of the Oldest Living Person**
- Historical distribution: The age of the oldest living person has ranged from around 115 to 122 years over the past century.
- Sample size: There have been approximately 50 verified cases of the oldest living person over the past century.
- Suitability score: 9/10
- Why this reference class: This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it provides historical data on the specific statistic we are interested in.

**Reference Class 2: Life Expectancy Trends**
- Historical distribution: Global life expectancy has increased from around 50 years in the early 20th century to around 72 years today.
- Sample size: Extensive data on global life expectancy trends.
- Suitability score: 7/10
- Why this reference class: While not directly related to the age of the oldest living person, trends in life expectancy can provide useful context and insights into the potential for continued longevity improvements.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

There are sufficient direct reference classes available, so a Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 115
Percentile 5: 116
Percentile 10: 117
Percentile 15: 118
Percentile 20: 119
Percentile 25: 119
Percentile 30: 120
Percentile 35: 120
Percentile 40: 121
Percentile 45: 121
Percentile 50: 122
Percentile 55: 122
Percentile 60: 122
Percentile 65: 122
Percentile 70: 122
Percentile 75: 122
Percentile 80: 122
Percentile 85: 122
Percentile 90: 122
Percentile 95: 122
Percentile 99: 122

**Median Estimate:** 122 years

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Potential for breakthroughs in longevity research and medical technology that could significantly extend the maximum lifespan
- Potential for changes in environmental, social, or economic factors that could impact longevity trends
- Challenges in accurately identifying and verifying the age of the oldest living person, especially in remote or less-developed regions
