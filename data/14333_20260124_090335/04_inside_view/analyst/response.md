Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a range of recent developments and expert predictions on the potential for increased human longevity in the 21st century. The sources appear to be credible, including academic institutions, reputable media outlets, and recognized demographic research organizations. While some of the more speculative estimates (e.g., 180 years) may not be fully priced into the base distribution, the majority of the evidence seems to be reasonably reflected in the starting point.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
Strong Evidence:
- Advancements in medical technology, including breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, gene therapy, and targeted interventions for age-related diseases.
- Improvements in global healthcare access and nutrition, leading to reduced mortality and increased lifespans, especially in developing regions.
- Potential for future longevity research to unlock the biological limits of human lifespan.

Moderate Evidence:
- Potential impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and global pandemics that could limit life expectancy gains.
- Socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as wealth inequality and urbanization, that may influence longevity trends.

Weak Evidence:
- Highly speculative predictions of lifespans exceeding 150 years, which lack strong scientific consensus and historical precedent.

Step 3: Direction of Update
The strong evidence pointing to higher lifespans due to medical and technological advancements outweighs the moderate evidence of potential global risks. This suggests an upward shift in the distribution, with a narrowing of the tails as the uncertainty around the upper bounds decreases.

Step 4: Integration
Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): The lower end of the distribution is less affected by the positive longevity trends, as these individuals may be more vulnerable to global risks and socioeconomic factors. The adjustments are relatively minor, shifting the 1st percentile from 115 to 115, the 5th percentile from 116 to 117, and the 10th percentile from 117 to 118.

Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): The middle of the distribution sees more significant upward adjustments, reflecting the expected gains in life expectancy. The 25th percentile shifts from 119 to 121, the 50th percentile from 122 to 126, and the 75th percentile from 122 to 131.

Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): The upper end of the distribution is adjusted more aggressively, taking into account the strong evidence for potential breakthroughs in longevity research and medical advancements. The 90th percentile shifts from 122 to 134, the 95th percentile from 122 to 135, and the 99th percentile from 122 to 136.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 115 and 136, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds given the evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are generally consistent with the base distribution, with the most significant deviations occurring in the upper percentiles, which is justified by the strong evidence for potential longevity breakthroughs.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the largest changes occurring in the upper percentiles, where the strong evidence is most relevant.
4. Monotonicity: The distribution is monotonically increasing, with each percentile value being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have focused on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments related to human longevity. The strong evidence for advancements in medical technology, improvements in healthcare and nutrition, and the potential for breakthroughs in longevity research suggests an upward shift in the distribution, with a narrowing of the tails as the uncertainty around the upper bounds decreases.

While there is also moderate evidence of potential global risks that could limit life expectancy gains, the net effect appears to be a higher median estimate of 126 years, with the 99th percentile reaching 136 years. This reflects my assessment that the positive longevity trends are likely to outweigh the potential negative impacts, barring any unforeseen catastrophic events.

It's important to note that the long-term nature of this forecast and the inherent uncertainties involved mean that my confidence in the adjustment is a 7 out of 10. Ongoing monitoring and refinement of the evidence will be crucial to maintaining an accurate and up-to-date assessment of the oldest living person's age in 2100.
