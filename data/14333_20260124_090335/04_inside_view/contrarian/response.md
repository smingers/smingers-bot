**Total Sources:** 28

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence gathered is relatively recent, with the majority of the sources from the past 5 years. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable scientific and media outlets. However, there is a potential bias towards more sensational or speculative claims about extreme longevity, as these tend to garner more attention.

The base distribution already seems to price in some of the historical trends and expert predictions, as the upper percentiles are capped at 122 years. This suggests that the current evidence may not significantly shift the distribution further upwards.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Multiple sources, including academic studies, indicate that the world record for human lifespan (122 years) is likely to be broken, with estimates of lifespans reaching 125-132 years by the end of the century.
- [Evidence 2]: Demographic and statistical modeling suggests that extreme longevity will continue to rise, with a lifespan of 130 years being plausible by 2100.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Some speculative claims suggest that lifespans of up to 180 years may be possible by 2100, but these are not well-supported by current evidence.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical trends show that the age of the oldest living person has been gradually increasing over time, but the pace of this increase may be slowing.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Anecdotal reports of individuals living beyond 122 years are not well-verified and may be unreliable.
- [Evidence 2]: Volatile indicators, such as social media discussions or unsubstantiated predictions, do not provide a strong basis for adjusting the distribution.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**Strong Evidence Pointing HIGHER**
- [Evidence 1]: This shifts the distribution HIGHER by approximately 5-10%, as the world record is likely to be broken, and lifespans of 125-132 years are plausible by 2100.
- [Evidence 2]: This also shifts the distribution HIGHER by a similar magnitude, as the modeling suggests a lifespan of 130 years may be achievable.

**Moderate Evidence Pointing HIGHER**
- [Evidence 1]: This provides some additional upward pressure on the distribution, but the lack of strong supporting evidence limits the magnitude of the adjustment to around 2-5%.

**Moderate Evidence Pointing LOWER**
- [Evidence 2]: This suggests that the pace of increase in extreme longevity may be slowing, which could slightly NARROW the distribution, but the effect is relatively small.

## Step 4: Integration

**Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10):**
The lower percentiles are likely to be shifted HIGHER by 5-10%, reflecting the increased likelihood of breaking the current world record and reaching lifespans of 125-132 years.

**Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75):**
The middle percentiles are also likely to be shifted HIGHER, but to a lesser degree (around 2-5%), as the more speculative claims of 180-year lifespans are not well-supported.

**Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99):**
The upper percentiles may see a slightly WIDER distribution, as the potential for reaching 130 years or more becomes more plausible. However, the effect is not dramatic, as the base distribution already accounted for some of these trends.

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The adjusted 1st and 99th percentiles appear to be reasonable bounds, considering the evidence and the historical context.
2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustments made are proportional to the strength of the evidence and do not deviate significantly from the base distribution.
3. **Update magnitude:** The adjustments are in line with the strength of the evidence, with stronger evidence leading to larger updates and weaker evidence having a more modest impact.
4. **Monotonicity:** The adjusted distribution maintains monotonicity, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I am inclined to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the base distribution already appears to incorporate the historical trends and expert predictions regarding extreme longevity. While the current evidence suggests that the world record for human lifespan is likely to be broken, with lifespans potentially reaching 125-132 years by 2100, I do not believe this represents a dramatic shift from the existing distribution.

The more speculative claims about lifespans of 180 years or more are not well-supported by the available evidence and should be viewed with skepticism. Additionally, the potential for the pace of increase in extreme longevity to slow down in the future is a factor that could limit the upward adjustment of the distribution.

Ultimately, while I believe the distribution should be shifted HIGHER to some degree, I do not think the adjustments should be overly dramatic, as the base distribution already accounts for the key trends and expert predictions in this domain.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Increased likelihood of breaking the current world record for human lifespan, with estimates of lifespans reaching 125-132 years by 2100.
- Moderate evidence pointing HIGHER: Demographic and statistical modeling suggesting a lifespan of 130 years may be plausible by 2100.
- Moderate evidence pointing LOWER: Potential for the pace of increase in extreme longevity to slow down in the future.
- Net direction: HIGHER, but with a relatively modest adjustment.
