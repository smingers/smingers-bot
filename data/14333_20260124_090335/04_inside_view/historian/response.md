**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: The evidence suggests that human longevity will continue to increase, with several sources indicating that lifespans of 125-130 years may be attainable by the end of the 21st century. This is based on statistical modeling, historical trends, and expert predictions.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: There is no strong evidence pointing to a lower distribution.
- Net direction: HIGHER

Reasoning:

As a historian, I have carefully reviewed the available evidence on the historical trends and patterns of human longevity. The key insights from my analysis are:

1. Strong historical precedent: The longest verified human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. This demonstrates that lifespans significantly beyond the current typical range are possible.

2. Accelerating progress in longevity: Recent studies and expert predictions suggest that the 21st century may see a significant increase in maximum human lifespan, with estimates ranging from 125 to 130 years. This is likely due to advancements in medicine, technology, and our understanding of the aging process.

3. Potential for further breakthroughs: While the historical record provides a solid anchor, the pace of scientific and medical progress makes it plausible that even longer lifespans could be achieved by 2100. Emerging technologies like regenerative medicine, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology may unlock new frontiers in longevity.

Incorporating this historical perspective, I have adjusted the base distribution upwards, with the median estimate reaching 126 years. The lower percentiles have been shifted upwards by around 1-2 years, while the upper percentiles have been adjusted more significantly, up to 136 years for the 99th percentile.

This adjustment is based on the strong evidence from multiple credible sources pointing to a substantial increase in human longevity over the coming decades. While there is still uncertainty around the exact limits, the historical precedents and current trends suggest that the base distribution was too conservative and that the upper end of the lifespan distribution should be significantly higher.

I have high confidence in this adjustment, as it is grounded in a thorough analysis of the relevant historical data and emerging research. However, I acknowledge that there is always the possibility of unforeseen factors or black swan events that could impact the trajectory of human longevity. Ongoing monitoring and refinement of these projections will be crucial as we approach the year 2100.
