Based on deliberative focus groups with ordinary people in Japan, the study found that while the net-zero target is widely seen as necessary, it is also considered unrealistic, reflecting an ambivalence toward its symbolic value. Participants perceived significant conflicts between feasibility and desirability: economic cost was a key determinant of feasibility, with people viewing it as a 'proxy for realism' under real-world conditions, yet cost was largely excluded from normative evaluations of desirability. In judging desirability, participants prioritized environmental safety, policy effectiveness, and impacts on their personal lifestyles. The CDR scenario was seen as technically feasible but less desirable due to reliance on uncertain large-scale technologies. The LED scenario was viewed as desirable for promoting sustainable living but less feasible due to required lifestyle changes. The CCU scenario, which enables continued use of fossil fuel-based appliances without drastic lifestyle shifts, was perceived as both feasible and desirable, though concerns remained about the scalability and high cost of direct air capture (DAC) technology. The study underscores a fundamental tension in public perception between what is technically achievable and what is ethically or socially acceptable, highlighting the need to distinguish feasibility from desirability in climate policy design.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44458-025-00021-7)\n\n**Reduced methane emissions in transgenic rice genotypes are associated with altered rhizosphere microbial hydrogen cycling**\nA study published in Nature on January 26, 2026, reports that reduced methane emissions in transgenic rice genotypes are linked to altered microbial hydrogen cycling in the rhizosphere.

It originates from landfills, farms, coal mines, and wastewater systems, particularly in low-oxygen environments. Methane-eating bacteria, known as methanotrophs, naturally consume methane and convert it into useful products like methanol, single-cell protein, and biodegradable plastics. These microbes operate through two enzyme systems\u2014one copper-dependent and one iron-dependent\u2014allowing adaptation to diverse environments. Methanotrophs are classified into Type I, Type II, and Type X, each suited for different applications: Type I for fast growth and protein production, Type II for efficient carbon storage and plastic synthesis, and Type X for extreme conditions. Engineered systems use these microbes in bio-covers at landfills, biofilters in biogas plants and coal mines, and wastewater treatment to reduce methane emissions and nitrogen pollution. Some strains also mitigate nitrous oxide, a secondary greenhouse gas, by converting it into harmless nitrogen. Advanced techniques like Raman-based sorting and synthetic biology enable strain optimization for targeted outputs. According to study lead author Jingrui Deng of Shandong University, future systems must be designed to reduce both methane and nitrous oxide. Senior author Qigui Niu emphasizes that methanotrophs represent a convergence of climate mitigation, waste management, and sustainable manufacturing.

It projects that, through energy-sector decarbonization, GHG emissions from fuel production could reach 'net zero' by 2040. The book analyzes regional EV adoption trends, attributing progress to government policies such as subsidies and regulations that improve EV accessibility compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite these supportive policies, EV adoption rates have not met expectations, revealing a gap between policy intent and actual environmental impact. Key challenges include rapid depreciation and the pace of technological evolution. The book emphasizes the critical role of advancements in lithium-ion batteries and artificial intelligence in shaping sustainable development. It underscores the necessity of achieving zero-carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices across scientific, technological, and economic domains. The text is designed for undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students, as well as professionals and researchers in environmental science, electrical engineering, transportation, and renewable energy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 10:54 AM\nSource:[Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/9783032113870)\n\n**Weir Receives 'A' Score from CDP for Fourth Consecutive Year**\nWeir Group PLC, a mining technology company, received an 'A' score for climate transparency from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for the fourth consecutive year, according to a press release issued on Monday, January 26, 2026.

Environment Minister Bernard Drainville stated the province will pursue realistic, pragmatic measures while maintaining its long-term commitment to combating climate change. The delay reflects broader challenges across Canadian provinces in meeting the 2030 emissions reduction goals. Federal Environment Department data indicate Canada as a whole is unlikely to achieve a 40% to 45% reduction in emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Ontario and British Columbia have also acknowledged they may not meet their targets. Quebec originally pledged a 37.5% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 but has only achieved about a 20% reduction so far, with most reductions coming from international carbon credit purchases rather than domestic emission cuts. Experts warn that delaying the target will increase pressure toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and the province has not yet presented concrete new policies to close the gap. The Climate Advisory Committee has cautioned that this announcement signals a diminished climate ambition, potentially harming long-term competitiveness and international reputation.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for 45% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution and 86 times more powerful than CO2 over 20 years, has a short atmospheric lifespan (9\u201312 years), making its reduction a key short-term climate 'emergency brake.' The report notes that 65% of Paris Agreement signatories have included methane-specific policies in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by June 2024. New regulations in Europe and North America, along with slower growth in natural gas markets, are expected to drive emissions down. Full implementation of national methane action plans could reduce emissions by 8% by 2030\u2014the largest sustained decline in history, according to UNEP. However, the more ambitious Global Methane Pledge\u2014signed by over 150 countries, including Brazil\u2014aims for a 30% reduction by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Achieving this would prevent 0.2\u00b0C of warming by 2050, avoid over 180,000 premature deaths annually, and save nearly 19 million tons of crop losses each year, with benefits exceeding $330 billion annually\u2014far outweighing the $127 billion cost of implementation. Despite progress, UNEP warns that only 2% of global climate finance is allocated to methane reduction, and funding must increase tenfold to reach $110 billion annually. Maas Goote, EU climate negotiator, emphasized that 70% of methane emissions can be cut using existing technologies like leak detection and prevention systems in fossil fuel sectors. Globally, Brazil is the fifth-largest methane emitter, behind China, the U.S., India, and Russia. Emissions rose 6% from 2020 to 2023, reaching 21.1 million tons, with agriculture\u2014especially cattle enteric fermentation\u2014responsible for 14.5 million tons in 2023. Pecuarian emissions (15.7 million tons) surpassed total greenhouse gas emissions from Italy in the same year. Despite being a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, Brazil has faced criticism from the Observat\u00f3rio do Clima for lacking implementation efforts, particularly due to the absence of specific methane targets in its NDCs. Experts like Gabriel Quintana of Imaflora suggest that 28% of agricultural methane emissions could be reduced by 2035 through improved animal diets, genetics, shorter slaughter cycles, and better soil management.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 08:04 AM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/brasil/cop30-amazonia/noticia/2025/12/02/relatorio-projeta-reducao-nas-emissoes-de-metano-ate-2030.ghtml)\n\n**Pemex, Mexican Petroleum Institute initiate methane reduction programme with World Bank backing**\nPemex, Mexico's state oil company, and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP), a public research and development center supporting Pemex, have launched a nationwide methane reduction programme with backing from the World Bank. The initiative was announced during a workshop titled 'Actions and Proposals to Develop a Comprehensive Methane Emissions Reduction Programme,' held under the World Bank\u2019s global Burning and Methane Reduction initiative. The workshop brought together experts from Pemex, IMP, and the World Bank to design coordinated strategies for detecting, quantifying, and mitigating methane emissions, as well as eliminating routine gas flaring. Pemex described the effort as 'a decisive step' toward building an integrated methane-reduction programme aligned with Mexico\u2019s international climate commitments. Key outcomes included identifying opportunities to expand leak-detection systems, develop replicable gas-recovery projects, and improve efficiency at gas-processing centers. These actions are expected to strengthen Mexico\u2019s technical capacity to reduce methane emissions\u2014among the most potent greenhouse gases\u2014and enhance the competitiveness of its energy sector. According to Pemex\u2019s 2024 ESG Report, the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with specific targets to reduce methane emissions by 30% and eliminate routine gas flaring in exploration and production by 2030. The initiative comes amid heightened global focus on methane reductions, as highlighted by a COP30 assessment from the United Nations and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which projects a 5% increase in global methane emissions by 2030 and a 21% increase by 2050 relative to 2020 levels without new policies. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) warned that stronger government action\u2014especially in food and agriculture\u2014is essential to prevent accelerated climate breakdown, noting that many cost-effective methane reduction opportunities remain underused.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[Newsbase](https://newsbase.com/story/pemex-mexican-petroleum-institute-initiate-methane-reduction-programme-with-world-bank-backing-413524)\n\n**COP30: World Falling Behind on Methane Emissions Reduction Despite Available Technology**\nAccording to the 2025 Global Methane Assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), global methane emissions continue to rise, jeopardizing the 1.5\u00b0C climate target by 2050. Despite a 2021 global commitment by 159 countries and the European Commission to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, current policies project only an 8% reduction. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution, has a short atmospheric lifespan (10\u201312 years) but traps heat more effectively than CO2. Scientists emphasize that rapid methane reductions could significantly slow temperature rise. The report highlights that over 80% of the 2030 target could be achieved at low cost, with the energy sector offering 72% of the mitigation potential, followed by waste (18%) and agriculture (10%). Solutions include leak detection and repair, plugging abandoned oil and gas wells, and improved rice cultivation practices. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen stated that methane reduction is one of the most immediate and effective actions to combat climate change and protect human health. The European Commission\u2019s 2024 methane regulation is seen as pivotal, particularly for Poland, the EU\u2019s largest coal mine methane emitter, responsible for over 60% of the bloc\u2019s coal-related emissions. However, analysts like Sabina Assan of Ember warn that weak enforcement and lack of sanctions will undermine the law\u2019s impact. Jonathan Banks of the Clean Air Task Force stressed the need for urgent, coordinated action to close persistent gaps in monitoring and regulation, particularly in the oil and gas sector, noting that the global energy sector alone could cut emissions by up to 86% by 2030\u2014avoiding 94 million tons annually\u2014using low-cost solutions.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/18/cop30-o-mundo-esta-a-ficar-para-tras-nas-reducoes-cruciais-das-emissoes-de-metano-alerta-u)\n\n**Methane Emissions Rise Globally, but New Targets and Technologies Offer a Path to 1.5\u00b0C Climate Goal**\nGlobal methane emissions are rising, but new targets and technologies are already slowing this growth and could enable a more ambitious reduction of the potent greenhouse gas, helping return the planet to the 1.5\u00b0C warming trajectory set by the Paris Agreement. According to a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report released on November 17, 2025, in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, the Global Methane Pledge\u2014signed by 103 countries at COP26 in Glasgow\u2014aims to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. The report states this goal is achievable if signatories adopt all existing mitigation practices and technologies. Progress is notable: as of June 2025, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) already included policies to curb methane at 38% above 2020 levels, though this translates to only an 8% reduction in actual emissions. Methane\u2019s high global warming potential\u201480 times greater than CO\u2082\u2014combined with its short atmospheric lifetime (about 20 years) makes rapid mitigation highly effective. Implementing current measures could save $330 billion annually by 2030, prevent over 180,000 premature deaths, and avoid 19 million tons of emissions per year. The majority of mitigation (72%) can come from the energy sector, with agriculture (18%) and waste treatment (10%) contributing the rest. The estimated annual cost for implementation is $127 billion by 2030, with 80% of emission reductions achievable through low-cost methods such as sealing shale gas wells, repairing leaks in oil and gas infrastructure, and ending flaring. Companies using these technologies can be up to 100 times more efficient than the sector average. A separate International Energy Agency (IEA) study found that $100 billion could close down inactive coal mines and oil and gas wells\u20148 million in total\u2014emitting more methane than Iran. Russia\u2019s oil sector, with aging infrastructure and minimal environmental accounting, remains a major source of emissions. UNEP emphasizes the need for reliable emission monitoring by both regulators and companies, along with public policy support for private financing. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that any overshoot beyond 1.5\u00b0C would bring dramatic consequences, but that methane mitigation offers one of the most promising and actionable solutions to shorten and stabilize this overshoot.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2025/11/emissoes-de-metano-crescem-mas-gas-e-atalho-para-devolver-planeta-a-rota-do-15c.shtml)\n\n**Global Methane Reduction Could Save $1 Trillion by 2050, Study Finds**\nAchieving a global reduction of at least 30% in anthropogenic methane emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 levels\u2014known as the Global Methane Pledge launched at COP26\u2014would save over $1 trillion in economic damages by 2050, equivalent to nearly 860 billion euros, according to a new study published in the journal 'Science'. The research, conducted by scientists from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE), used an integrated assessment model to quantify avoided climate damages globally and nationally, including climate tipping points and risks. The study also evaluated co-benefits for air quality and costs. It found a cost-benefit ratio of at least 3:1 under conservative assumptions, rising to over 6:1 when health co-benefits are included. The authors assert that methane mitigation reduces the likelihood of key climate tipping points\u2014such as Amazon rainforest dieback by 8% and Indian monsoon disruption by 13%\u2014by 2050. They emphasize that methane concentrations are rising rapidly due to emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture, waste, and natural sources like wetlands. The study highlights that low-income countries would benefit most due to their higher climate vulnerability. 'The benefits of global methane action appear far greater than the costs, making the economic case for action clear. Our analysis shows that global methane mitigation is not only feasible but economically attractive,' said Simon Dietz, director of research at the Grantham Research Institute. As of the report's publication, 159 countries, including the European Union, have signed the Global Methane Pledge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:08 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/sociedad/noticia-combatir-metano-nivel-mundial-supondria-860000-millones-euros-ahorro-dano-anuales-estudio-20251030190739.html)\n\n**Achieving Net-Zero CO\u2082 by 2050: Tackling Hard-to-Abate Emissions in Switzerland**\nThe article explains Switzerland's path toward its net-zero CO\u2082 emissions target by 2050, highlighting that while emissions from road transport and building heating can be largely eliminated through transitions to fossil-free vehicles and non-fossil heating, around 12 million tonnes of CO\u2082-equivalent (CO\u2082eq) emissions will remain in 2050 due to 'hard-to-abate' sectors like agriculture, industry, and waste incineration. These residual emissions\u2014equivalent to about a quarter of current levels\u2014require negative emissions technologies (NETs) such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) to achieve net-zero. DAC is technically feasible but energy-intensive and costly, while CCS can capture CO\u2082 at emission sources like waste incinerators and cement plants. The article also addresses international aviation and shipping, noting that Switzerland has committed to net-zero emissions for aviation fuel consumed domestically by 2050, though viable solutions remain uncertain. A proposed pipeline network could export captured CO\u2082 to Norway for storage. The article discusses additional strategies, including precision farming to reduce nitrous oxide, methane-reducing feed additives for cattle, alternative building materials like wood, and behavioral changes such as reduced meat consumption. A six-year consortium project led by Empa is exploring systemic and technological solutions. The article emphasizes that while no master plan exists yet, a broad exploration of options aims to lay the groundwork for future implementation. CO\u2082-equivalent calculations account for the higher global warming potential of methane (28 times stronger than CO\u2082) and nitrous oxide (265 times stronger), based on a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) metric.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[SRF News](https://www.srf.ch/wissen/klimawandel/noch-kein-genauer-plan-netto-null-ziel-bis-2050-wie-kann-die-schweiz-das-erreichen)\n\n**The Ten Most Promising Technologies to Combat Climate Change: Proteins, Green Cement, and More**\nThe World Economic Forum's October 2025 report identifies the ten most promising technologies to combat climate change, based on innovation, impact, and depth. The report, led by Johan Rockstrom of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, emphasizes designing policies that prioritize planetary health and evolve business models to respect environmental limits. A committee analyzed 123 technologies, narrowing them down to ten using AI-driven analysis of scientific literature. The top technologies include precision fermentation\u2014using genetically modified microbes to produce animal-like proteins, reducing environmental pressure and supporting biodiversity; sustainable ammonia synthesis using renewable energy to cut emissions from fertilizers; AI-powered food waste separation for optimal recycling into compost; methane capture technology to prevent emissions; green cement, which reduces the ecological footprint of traditional cement production; bidirectional charging, enabling flexible energy storage and distribution for cleaner grids; advanced Earth observation using drones, AI, and satellite data for precise, micro-local monitoring of ecosystem health; geothermal energy, which remains underutilized but offers high yield with minimal planetary impact; regenerative desalination, which purifies seawater sustainably; and soil health restoration using AI and engineering to reduce pressure on degraded land, as one-third of Earth\u2019s soil is already degraded.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[MARCA](https://www.marca.com/tiramillas/ciencia/2025/10/15/diez-tecnologias-prometedoras-frenar-cambio-climatico-proteinas-cemento-verde.html)\n\n**New Zealand Cuts Methane Targets, Sparks Climate Denial Accusations**\nThe New Zealand government has faced intense backlash after reducing its methane emission reduction targets for biogenic methane\u2014a potent greenhouse gas\u2014calling into question its climate commitment. The new target, set for 2050 relative to 2017 levels, is now between 14% and 24%, a significant retreat from the previous goal of 24% to 47%. The decision, made by the right-wing coalition government, was welcomed by agricultural groups, including Federated Farmers of New Zealand, whose president Wayne Langford called the prior targets 'absolute madness' and praised the relief for farming families. However, environmentalists, scientists, and opposition leaders have strongly criticized the move. Greenpeace New Zealand accused the government of 'total climate denial,' while climate activist Amanda Larsson directly attacked Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, claiming he prioritizes corporate profits over the future of children. Scientists, including Ralph Sims from Massey University, expressed concern that the government\u2019s plan\u2014relying on unproven technology and no methane tax\u2014lacks assurance of short-term solutions. The government pledged to invest NZ$400 million (~US$230 million) in methane-reducing technology and stated that agricultural emissions could fall by up to 14% in the next decade if 30% of farmers adopt new technologies by 2030. Critics warn the policy may damage New Zealand\u2019s international reputation as a 'clean and green' nation, especially given that its oceans are warming 34% faster than the global average. Despite criticism, Minister for Climate Change Simon Watts reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and stated agriculture would continue to contribute fairly. A legislative review of biogenic methane targets is scheduled for 2040, with no immediate methane tax planned.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[greenMe](https://www.greenme.it/ambiente/la-nuova-zelanda-taglia-gli-obiettivi-sul-metano-e-scatta-laccusa-di-negazionismo-climatico/)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
