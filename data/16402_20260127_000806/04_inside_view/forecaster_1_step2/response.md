Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Key sources include UN Environment Programme reports, academic studies, and news articles from various international sources. Most sources are from 2025-2026, providing recent context.

Strongest Sources:
1. UNEP Global Methane Status Report (COP30)
- Expert-driven analysis
- Comprehensive global perspective
- Quantitative projections for methane emissions

2. Nature study on transgenic rice and methane emissions
- Peer-reviewed scientific research
- Offers technological mitigation perspective

3. World Economic Forum technology report
- Systematic technology assessment
- Identifies promising methane reduction technologies

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Global Methane Pledge targeting 30% reduction by 2030
- Existing technologies can mitigate up to 80% of emissions at low cost
- Methane's short atmospheric lifetime (9-12 years) makes rapid reduction impactful

Moderate Evidence:
- Emerging methane-eating microbe technologies
- Precision agriculture and genetic modifications
- Increasing corporate commitments to emissions reduction

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative technological breakthroughs
- Inconsistent national policy implementations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Horizon: 24 years (2026-2050)

If timeframe halved (12 years):
- Lower total reduction potential
- Less time for technological maturation
- More incremental changes

If timeframe doubled (48 years):
- Greater technological transformation
- More comprehensive policy implementations
- Higher potential for breakthrough technologies

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Technological Innovation
- Methane-eating microbes
- Precision agriculture
- Genetic modifications in agriculture

2. Policy Coordination
- Global Methane Pledge
- Increasing national commitments
- Corporate sustainability targets

3. Economic Incentives
- Cost-effective mitigation strategies
- Potential economic benefits of reduction

Blind Spot: Potential technological disruption or unexpected global economic shifts that could dramatically alter emissions trajectories.

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex interplay of technological, policy, and economic factors, I'll adjust the distribution to reflect cautious optimism about methane emissions reduction.

Checklist:
1. Target: Anthropogenic methane emissions level in 2050
2. Base rate: Moderate reduction scenario
3. Consistency check: Median around 7-8, mean similar
4. Key evidence: Global Methane Pledge, technological innovations, policy commitments
5. Blind spot: Potential technological disruption

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 1.2
Percentile 5: 2.1
Percentile 10: 3.4
Percentile 20: 4.7
Percentile 40: 6.2
Percentile 60: 8.5
Percentile 80: 11.3
Percentile 90: 13.6
Percentile 95: 15.2
Percentile 99: 17.8

Rationale: The distribution reflects a moderate reduction scenario, accounting for technological progress, policy commitments, and potential challenges in global implementation. The wide range acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in long-term emissions predictions.
