Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Key sources evaluated:
1. UNEP Global Methane Status Report (COP30, Nov 2025)
- Highly credible source
- Provides quantitative insights into global methane reduction efforts
- Key fact: 65% of Paris Agreement signatories included methane-specific policies by June 2024

2. Methane-eating Microbes Article (Earth.com, Jan 2025)
- Moderate credibility
- Technical details on methane reduction technologies
- Highlights potential technological interventions

3. World Economic Forum Report (Oct 2025)
- High credibility
- Identified top technologies for climate change mitigation
- Methane capture technology highlighted as a promising intervention

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Global Methane Pledge signed by 150+ countries targeting 30% reduction by 2030
- Existing technologies can potentially reduce 80% of emissions at low cost
- Multiple international policy frameworks emerging

Moderate Evidence:
- Technological innovations in methane capture and reduction
- Growing corporate commitments to emissions reduction
- Increasing investment in methane mitigation strategies

Weak Evidence:
- Individual corporate sustainability announcements
- Regional policy variations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Timeframe: 24 years (2026-2050)

If timeframe halved (12 years):
- Lower total reduction potential
- Less time for technological maturation
- More conservative estimates

If timeframe doubled (48 years):
- Higher potential for transformative technologies
- More comprehensive policy implementation
- Greater uncertainty

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. International policy momentum
2. Technological innovation potential
3. Economic incentives for emissions reduction
4. Growing climate awareness

Probability calibration:
The base trajectory suggests moderate but significant methane emissions reduction. The Global Methane Pledge and emerging technologies provide substantial optimism, but implementation challenges remain.

Checklist:
1. Target: Anthropogenic methane emissions level in 2050
2. Base rate: Moderate reduction scenario
3. Consistency check: Median around 10, mean slightly lower - aligned with evidence
4. Key evidence pieces:
   - Global Methane Pledge
   - Emerging capture technologies
   - International policy frameworks
5. Blind spot: Potential technological breakthrough or complete policy failure

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 3.2
Percentile 5: 4.5
Percentile 10: 5.7
Percentile 20: 6.9
Percentile 40: 8.3
Percentile 60: 10.1
Percentile 80: 12.6
Percentile 90: 14.2
Percentile 95: 15.8
Percentile 99: 17.5

Rationale: The distribution reflects a moderately optimistic scenario of methane emissions reduction, accounting for policy efforts, technological innovations, and implementation challenges. The wide interval acknowledges significant uncertainties in long-term projections.
