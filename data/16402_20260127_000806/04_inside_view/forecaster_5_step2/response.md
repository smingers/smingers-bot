Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. UNEP Global Methane Status Report (COP30, 2025)
- High credibility source
- Expert-driven report with quantitative projections
- Key facts: 
  * 65% of Paris Agreement signatories have methane-specific policies
  * Potential 8% emissions reduction by 2030
  * 30% reduction goal by Global Methane Pledge

2. Methane-eating Microbes Article (Earth.com)
- Moderate credibility
- Highlights technological innovation potential
- Weak on precise quantitative projections

3. Grantham Research Institute Study (Science Journal)
- High credibility academic source
- Quantitative economic modeling of methane reduction
- Key finding: >$1 trillion in economic benefits by reducing methane 30% by 2030

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Global Methane Pledge with 150+ country signatories
- Technological innovations in methane capture/reduction
- Economic incentives exceeding $330 billion annually

Moderate Evidence:
- Current policy trajectory suggests only 8% reduction
- Partial implementation of existing mitigation technologies
- Sector-specific reduction strategies (energy, agriculture, waste)

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative microbe-based reduction technologies
- Anecdotal corporate sustainability commitments

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Window: 24 years (2026-2050)

If timeframe halved (12 years):
- Lower potential for transformative technologies
- More constrained by current technological readiness
- Likely lower reduction potential

If timeframe doubled (48 years):
- Greater potential for breakthrough technologies
- More comprehensive global policy implementation
- Higher likelihood of significant emission reductions

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Technological Innovation Potential
2. Global Policy Commitment
3. Economic Incentive Structures
4. Sector-Specific Mitigation Strategies

Probability Calibration:
- Base rate suggests moderate reduction potential
- Strong global commitment increases confidence
- Technological uncertainty introduces variability

Checklist:
1. Target: Anthropogenic methane emissions level in 2050
2. Outside View Base Rate: Moderate reduction scenario
3. Consistency Check: Median around 10, mean slightly higher due to right-skew
4. Key Evidence:
   - Global Methane Pledge
   - Technological innovations
   - Economic incentives
5. Blind Spot: Potential technological breakthrough or global policy failure

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 3.2
Percentile 5: 4.5
Percentile 10: 5.8
Percentile 20: 7.2
Percentile 40: 9.1
Percentile 60: 11.3
Percentile 80: 13.7
Percentile 90: 15.6
Percentile 95: 16.9
Percentile 99: 18.4

Rationale: The distribution reflects a moderate reduction scenario with right-skew, accounting for technological potential and global policy commitments while maintaining uncertainty about long-term implementation.
