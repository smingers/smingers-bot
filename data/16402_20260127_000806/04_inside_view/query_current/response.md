Analysis:
To forecast anthropogenic methane emissions in 2050, we need to research current trends in emission reduction strategies, technological innovations, policy commitments, and sectoral changes. Key areas of focus should include:

1. Global climate policy trajectories
2. Technological advances in methane capture and reduction
3. Emissions from key sectors like agriculture, energy, and waste management
4. International agreements and national commitments to reduce methane emissions

The forecast requires understanding both current emission levels and the projected impact of mitigation efforts. We'll need to find sources that:
- Provide current methane emission data
- Outline future reduction scenarios
- Discuss technological and policy interventions
- Project long-term emission trends
