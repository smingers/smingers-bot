Analysis:
The key driver for whether the U-S population will ever overtake China’s is the speed of China’s demographic contraction versus the pace of (relatively modest) U-S growth.  Relevant up-to-date information therefore includes:
• UN World Population Prospects 2022 (and any 2023/24 updates) – median, low- and high-fertility variants for both countries out to 2100.  
• IHME (Lancet) forecasts, which extend to 2100 and often show China falling below 1 billion while the U-S edges toward 350–450 million, sometimes crossing over late in the century.  
• Chinese National Bureau of Statistics releases confirming earlier-than-expected population decline (first absolute drop in 2022, larger fall in 2023) – important because they push most projection series downward for China.  
• U-S Census Bureau international database and its own national projections (released 2023) for long-run U-S growth.  
• Academic or think-tank commentary published since 2023 discussing the “US may surpass China in population” narrative.

Those sources will give the numeric trajectories, the crossover year (if any) in the different scenarios, and commentary on fertility, immigration and mortality assumptions driving the divergence.  Collecting the newest UN tables, IHME updates, China statistical communiqués and U-S Census technical notes should provide the best inside view for the forecast.
