Analysis:
To judge whether the United States population could surpass that of the People’s Republic of China before 2200, we first need a solid historical baseline: (1) past population levels of both countries, (2) current official counts and growth rates, and (3) the most authoritative long-range projections (UN DESA, U.S. Census International Programs, IIASA, Wittgenstein Centre, academic demography papers).  Key contextual items include China’s recently recorded population decline (2023-2024), its total fertility rate well below replacement, ageing-related mortality, migration constraints, and U.S. advantages in higher fertility and net immigration.  Historic crossovers for other large countries (e.g., India > China in 2023) and any prior forecasts that explicitly predict a U.S.–China population crossover provide valuable outside-view reference points.  Therefore the search queries should surface: (a) UN and U.S. Census long-range projection tables; (b) recent news analyses on China’s decline; and (c) scholarly discussions comparing multiple scenarios up to 2100-2300.  These will supply the quantitative foundation for probabilistic forecasting.
