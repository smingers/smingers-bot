The report's author, senior fellow Stephen Wertheim, notes a growing disconnect between the American public and Washington policymakers, as most Americans are unwilling to pay a high cost for the government's goal of 'containing China\u2019s rise.' The survey included 1,500 nationally representative U.S. adults. It found that 41% believe the U.S. remains the most powerful and influential nation, while 59% see the U.S. as one of several major powers, indicating a widespread perception that America is no longer a unique superpower. Over half of respondents believe U.S. relative power is declining, and only 28% believe the U.S. is maintaining or strengthening its position. While most Americans support U.S. global influence, they prioritize North American influence over Asia. Only 35% and 33% of respondents considered it very or somewhat important for the U.S. to maintain strength in Asia, ranking fifth among regions. When asked about U.S.-China competition, 54% said their lives would not be affected by China\u2019s global surpassing of the U.S., and 8% believed it would improve their lives\u2014collectively, 62% believe U.S. living standards would not decline. This indicates that the American public is less concerned about U.S.-China rivalry than political leaders.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 03:52 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260126/49196466.html)\n\n**China's Birth Rate Plummets to 1738 Levels Amid 'Epic Shrinkage' of 1.4 Billion Population**\nChina's annual birth rate has dropped to 7.92 million in 2025, the lowest since 1949 and equivalent to the level seen in 1738 during the Qing Dynasty's\u4e7e\u9686\u4e09\u5e74 (Qianlong Year 3), when China's population was only 150 million. This marks a dramatic reversal from the population peak of 1.41 billion in 2021, with projections now indicating a population decline. The official prediction that China's population would peak at 1.5 billion by 2033 has been significantly off\u2014both the peak arrived 12 years early and is nearly 100 million lower than anticipated. The total fertility rate (TFR) is estimated at 0.97\u20130.98 in 2025, the first time it has fallen below 1.0, meaning each generation is smaller than the previous one. This sharp decline contrasts with past optimistic forecasts: in 2013, experts predicted a TFR of over 4.4 under a universal two-child policy; in 2016, officials forecast a peak TFR of 2.09 by 2018, but actual births in 2018 were only 13.62 million (TFR ~1.4). Despite the implementation of the three-child policy, births have continued to plummet. Population researcher Yi Fuxian stated that the official predictions' failure indicates a 'serious problem' in China's current demographic academic paradigm. The decline is attributed to a combination of policy miscalculations, underreporting in earlier data, and deep structural shifts in fertility behavior.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 03:45 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11098115)\n\n**30 Cities Surpass 1 Trillion Yuan GDP, 3 Super\u9ed1\u9a6c Cities Emerge**\nAs of January 24, 2026, 21 provinces in China have released their 2025 GDP data.

Beijing entered the 5 trillion yuan club for the first time, with a 2025 GDP of 52073.4 billion yuan, growing at 5.4%, driven by high-tech industry investments rising 40.1% and advancements in AI, 5G, and smart manufacturing. In regional developments, Shandong became the first northern province to exceed 10 trillion yuan in GDP, reaching 103197 billion yuan in 2025 with a 5.5% growth, marking a fivefold increase since 2006. However, Shandong faces a declining population trend, losing about 828,000 people between 2022 and 2024. Three new 'super\u9ed1\u9a6c' cities surpassed the 1 trillion yuan mark: Dalian, with a 2025 GDP of 10002.1 billion yuan, driven by growth in petrochemicals, high-tech manufacturing, and advanced equipment; Wenzhou, which officially confirmed surpassing 1 trillion yuan despite not releasing official data; and Xuzhou, estimated to reach 10090.27 billion yuan based on a 5.8% growth projection from 2024's 9537.12 billion yuan. The total number of cities with over 1 trillion yuan GDP has now reached 30. Future contenders include Shaoxing (targeting 2027), Xiamen (projected to exceed 9000 billion yuan in 2025), and Shenyang (projected to reach 9208 billion yuan in 2025, with a 2% growth rate, making a 2026 breakthrough unlikely without a significant acceleration).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 12:25 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qDpGCqOhDP)\n\n**Infographic: How Fast Is Asia Ageing?**\nAccording to the UN World Population Prospects (medium-scenario projections), Asia is experiencing a rapid demographic shift, with the share of people aged 65 and over rising significantly across multiple countries.

South Korea and China are accelerating rapidly: South Korea\u2019s 65+ population is expected to increase from 15.8% in 2020 to 33.8% by 2040, more than doubling, while China\u2019s share will rise from 12.7% to 26.6% over the same period. These trends reflect growing national concerns over labor shortages and pension system sustainability due to persistently low fertility and shrinking workforces. Even countries with lower initial aging levels, such as Thailand and Vietnam, are seeing sharp increases: Thailand\u2019s 65+ population is projected to reach 25.6% and Vietnam\u2019s to 15.8% by 2040\u2014both doubling in two decades.

This follows an 8-year drop of over 50% in births under Xi Jinping\u2019s rule, with 2025 seeing fewer than 8 million newborns\u2014levels not seen since the early 1700s, when China\u2019s population was under 225 million. The country has entered depopulation, with over four deaths for every three births in 2025, and the total fertility rate has likely fallen below one birth per woman\u2014fulfilling the long-standing goal of China\u2019s former one-child policy. If trends continue, the next generation will be only 44% as large as the previous one. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s belief in its ability to 'fine-tune' birth rates like livestock is proving ineffective; measures such as taxing condoms are described as laughable and demographically meaningless. The collapse in births correlates with a sharp drop in marriage registrations, reflecting a structural shift rooted in cultural stigma against out-of-wedlock childbearing. This demographic implosion signals a 'no confidence' vote from young Chinese, echoing the despair seen in late Soviet Union. The crisis threatens China\u2019s global ambitions by shrinking its labor force and constraining military and economic expansion by 2049. The erosion of the extended family\u2014historically China\u2019s social safety net\u2014will force the creation of a costly new welfare state, diverting resources from defense and global projects. Moreover, a military composed almost entirely of only children may face heightened casualty aversion, complicating strategic decisions such as a potential invasion of Taiwan. The author, Nicholas Eberstadt, warns that the implications of China\u2019s birth collapse may limit the CCP\u2019s future options in ways not yet fully recognized by Beijing or Washington.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:53 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/opinion/how-a-shrinking-china-could-handcuff-beijings-ambitions/)\n\n**Visualizing the World's 8.2 Billion Population**\nThe world's population reached 8.2 billion in 2025, according to data from the United Nations.

China, with over 1.4 billion people, ranks second but has declined by nearly 36 million since 2022, falling behind India in 2023 due to aging demographics and record-low fertility. The United States, with 347 million people in 2025, ranks third but is projected to be overtaken by Nigeria by 2050, as Nigeria's population is expected to double due to its younger demographic.

Bert Hofman, Senior Associate Fellow at MERICS and director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS), cited OECD projections from September 2023, which estimate that India will overtake the US by 2060 and reach nearly twice the size of China by 2100. The US is projected to fall to third place in the 2040s but rebound to match China\u2019s GDP by 2070. Key drivers include demographic shifts: China\u2019s population is expected to decline to 650 million by 2100, with a working-age labor force of fewer than 300 million\u2014less than 40% of India\u2019s projected workforce. India\u2019s labor force participation is expected to rise from 50% to 70% by 2100. The OECD\u2019s Cobb-Douglas model with constant returns to scale suggests that India will converge faster in GDP due to higher effective labor and capital dynamics, leading to stronger productivity growth than China. China may slow its convergence with the US by mid-century, but could potentially offset this through faster adoption of AI and robotics and policies boosting labor share and consumption. Hofman emphasized that these are scenarios, not predictions, but India\u2019s projected GDP margin over China by 2100 is substantial. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) also forecasts in its 'World Economic League Table 2024' that India will surpass both the US and China by century\u2019s end, with GDP 90% larger than China\u2019s and 30% larger than the US, supported by a steady 6.5% average growth rate from 2024 to 2028.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:36 AM\nSource:[Business Today](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/india-could-surpass-us-china-to-become-worlds-largest-economy-by-century-end-512815-2026-01-25)\n\n**U.S. Public Views China Surpassing U.S. as Irrelevant to Daily Life, Most Not Worried About Negative Impacts**\nA January 21, 2026, survey by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reveals that 54% of U.S. respondents believe their lives would not be negatively affected if China surpasses the United States in global power and influence. The report's author, senior fellow Stephen Wertheim, notes a growing disconnect between the American public and Washington policymakers, as most Americans are unwilling to pay a high cost for the government's goal of 'containing China\u2019s rise.' The survey included 1,500 nationally representative U.S. adults. It found that 41% believe the U.S. remains the most powerful and influential nation, while 59% see the U.S. as one of several major powers, indicating a widespread perception that America is no longer a unique superpower. Over half of respondents believe U.S. relative power is declining, and only 28% believe the U.S. is maintaining or strengthening its position. While most Americans support U.S. global influence, they prioritize North American influence over Asia. Only 35% and 33% of respondents considered it very or somewhat important for the U.S. to maintain strength in Asia, ranking fifth among regions. When asked about U.S.-China competition, 54% said their lives would not be affected by China\u2019s global surpassing of the U.S., and 8% believed it would improve their lives\u2014collectively, 62% believe U.S. living standards would not decline. This indicates that the American public is less concerned about U.S.-China rivalry than political leaders.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 03:52 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260126/49196466.html)\n\n**China's Birth Rate Plummets to 1738 Levels Amid 'Epic Shrinkage' of 1.4 Billion Population**\nChina's annual birth rate has dropped to 7.92 million in 2025, the lowest since 1949 and equivalent to the level seen in 1738 during the Qing Dynasty's\u4e7e\u9686\u4e09\u5e74 (Qianlong Year 3), when China's population was only 150 million. This marks a dramatic reversal from the population peak of 1.41 billion in 2021, with projections now indicating a population decline. The official prediction that China's population would peak at 1.5 billion by 2033 has been significantly off\u2014both the peak arrived 12 years early and is nearly 100 million lower than anticipated. The total fertility rate (TFR) is estimated at 0.97\u20130.98 in 2025, the first time it has fallen below 1.0, meaning each generation is smaller than the previous one. This sharp decline contrasts with past optimistic forecasts: in 2013, experts predicted a TFR of over 4.4 under a universal two-child policy; in 2016, officials forecast a peak TFR of 2.09 by 2018, but actual births in 2018 were only 13.62 million (TFR ~1.4). Despite the implementation of the three-child policy, births have continued to plummet. Population researcher Yi Fuxian stated that the official predictions' failure indicates a 'serious problem' in China's current demographic academic paradigm. The decline is attributed to a combination of policy miscalculations, underreporting in earlier data, and deep structural shifts in fertility behavior.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 03:45 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11098115)\n\n**30 Cities Surpass 1 Trillion Yuan GDP, 3 Super\u9ed1\u9a6c Cities Emerge**\nAs of January 24, 2026, 21 provinces in China have released their 2025 GDP data.

Beijing entered the 5 trillion yuan club for the first time, with a 2025 GDP of 52073.4 billion yuan, growing at 5.4%, driven by high-tech industry investments rising 40.1% and advancements in AI, 5G, and smart manufacturing. In regional developments, Shandong became the first northern province to exceed 10 trillion yuan in GDP, reaching 103197 billion yuan in 2025 with a 5.5% growth, marking a fivefold increase since 2006. However, Shandong faces a declining population trend, losing about 828,000 people between 2022 and 2024. Three new 'super\u9ed1\u9a6c' cities surpassed the 1 trillion yuan mark: Dalian, with a 2025 GDP of 10002.1 billion yuan, driven by growth in petrochemicals, high-tech manufacturing, and advanced equipment; Wenzhou, which officially confirmed surpassing 1 trillion yuan despite not releasing official data; and Xuzhou, estimated to reach 10090.27 billion yuan based on a 5.8% growth projection from 2024's 9537.12 billion yuan.

South Korea and China are accelerating rapidly: South Korea\u2019s 65+ population is expected to increase from 15.8% in 2020 to 33.8% by 2040, more than doubling, while China\u2019s share will rise from 12.7% to 26.6% over the same period. These trends reflect growing national concerns over labor shortages and pension system sustainability due to persistently low fertility and shrinking workforces. Even countries with lower initial aging levels, such as Thailand and Vietnam, are seeing sharp increases: Thailand\u2019s 65+ population is projected to reach 25.6% and Vietnam\u2019s to 15.8% by 2040\u2014both doubling in two decades.

This follows an 8-year drop of over 50% in births under Xi Jinping\u2019s rule, with 2025 seeing fewer than 8 million newborns\u2014levels not seen since the early 1700s, when China\u2019s population was under 225 million. The country has entered depopulation, with over four deaths for every three births in 2025, and the total fertility rate has likely fallen below one birth per woman\u2014fulfilling the long-standing goal of China\u2019s former one-child policy. If trends continue, the next generation will be only 44% as large as the previous one. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s belief in its ability to 'fine-tune' birth rates like livestock is proving ineffective; measures such as taxing condoms are described as laughable and demographically meaningless. The collapse in births correlates with a sharp drop in marriage registrations, reflecting a structural shift rooted in cultural stigma against out-of-wedlock childbearing. This demographic implosion signals a 'no confidence' vote from young Chinese, echoing the despair seen in late Soviet Union. The crisis threatens China\u2019s global ambitions by shrinking its labor force and constraining military and economic expansion by 2049. The erosion of the extended family\u2014historically China\u2019s social safety net\u2014will force the creation of a costly new welfare state, diverting resources from defense and global projects. Moreover, a military composed almost entirely of only children may face heightened casualty aversion, complicating strategic decisions such as a potential invasion of Taiwan. The author, Nicholas Eberstadt, warns that the implications of China\u2019s birth collapse may limit the CCP\u2019s future options in ways not yet fully recognized by Beijing or Washington.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:53 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/opinion/how-a-shrinking-china-could-handcuff-beijings-ambitions/)\n\n**Visualizing the World's 8.2 Billion Population**\nThe world's population reached 8.2 billion in 2025, according to data from the United Nations.

The report, based on 40 sources and crafted from an international expert perspective, highlights that China's birth rate in 2025 reached a historic low of 7.92 million, with a natural population growth rate of -2.41\u2030, marking an irreversible shift from a 'demographic dividend' to a 'demographic liability.' The analysis focuses on China's Comprehensive National Power (CNP) and examines structural challenges such as local government debt (LGFV), the projected exhaustion of pension funds by 2035, and the 'premature aging' phenomenon ('wealth before old age'). It argues that China will be forced to transition from 'quantitative expansion' to 'qualitative restructuring' in national power, with domestic stability costs increasingly eroding external power projection capabilities. The report identifies the early 2030s as a 'peak crisis period,' coinciding with the closing of a 'window of opportunity' for geopolitical ambitions, including Taiwan's reunification, thereby heightening regional instability risks.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 08:58 PM\nSource:[\u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30fb\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0](https://blogs.itmedia.co.jp/serial/2026/01/ai51015.html)\n\n**UP and Bihar Surpass China in Birth Rates, Signaling Global Demographic Shift**\nAccording to the United Nations Children's Birth Report and data from national statistical agencies, a historic demographic shift is underway. By 2025, the combined number of children born in India's Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is projected to exceed China's total annual births\u20147.91 million\u2014marking a pivotal moment in global demographics. In 2023, Uttar Pradesh recorded approximately 5.58 million births and Bihar 3.29 million, totaling 8.87 million, nearly matching China\u2019s 2023 birth count of about 9 million. China\u2019s birth rate has declined sharply since 2010, falling from 17.9 million in 2011 to an estimated 7.91 million in 2025\u2014a drop of nearly 56%. This decline is attributed to urbanization, rising living costs, delayed marriage and childbirth, and the legacy of the one-child policy. In contrast, India\u2019s overall birth rate remains high, with an estimated 23.07 million births in 2025\u2014the highest globally. While India surpassed China as the world\u2019s most populous nation in mid-2022, the 2025 projection shows that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar alone could surpass China in annual births despite having only about 26% of China\u2019s total population. This shift underscores the importance of fertility rates and age structure, not just population size. India\u2019s youthful demographic offers economic potential, but challenges remain in education, healthcare, employment, and infrastructure to harness this 'demographic dividend.' Experts warn that India\u2019s fertility rate will eventually decline, as seen in states like Tamil Nadu, where birth rates are already below China\u2019s. Thus, sustained investment in family planning, women\u2019s education, and health services in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be critical to maintaining this demographic advantage.

Mexico, with 128 million people, rounds out the top ten, transitioning from rapid growth to an aging population, influenced by migration to the U.S. and remittances. The article emphasizes that these demographic trends\u2014India\u2019s youth, China\u2019s aging, U.S. immigration, and Africa\u2019s growth\u2014will shape global economic, environmental, and political dynamics for decades. The United Nations estimated the world population at 8.232 billion in 2025, and the ten countries collectively house more than half of humanity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[Travelbinger](https://travelbinger.com/the-worlds-population-isnt-spread-evenly-heres-where-it-actually-lives/)\n\n**World Population Exceeds 8.2 Billion in 2025, Jakarta Becomes Most Populous City**\nAccording to United Nations data and projections, the world population surpassed 8.2 billion in 2025, with estimates ranging between 8.2 and 8.3 billion. Worldometer's analysis indicates that approximately 59% of the global population resides in Asia, 19% in Africa, 9% in Europe, 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and about 5% in North America. The world population is projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2060. As of 2025, 16 countries have populations exceeding 100 million. China and India, both with populations over 1 billion, together account for about one-third of the world\u2019s population. Following them are the United States (347 million), Indonesia (285 million), Pakistan (255 million), Nigeria (237 million), and Brazil (212 million). Countries with populations between 100 and 200 million include Bangladesh, Russia, Ethiopia, Mexico, Japan, Egypt, the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Vietnam. Notably, no European country has a population exceeding 100 million; Germany, with 80 million, is the closest. Europe faces demographic challenges, including slow population growth, aging populations, and migration issues. China, which previously enforced a one-child policy from 1979 to 2015, is now implementing new measures to boost birth rates, including imposing a 13% value-added tax on contraceptive products starting January 1, 2026, reversing a 1993 policy of tax exemption. China\u2019s total population has declined steadily over the past three years and lost its title as the world\u2019s most populous country to India in 2023. In Italy, the number of people aged 100 and over doubled from 2009, reaching 23,548 in 2025, with 82.6% being women. This trend is also observed across other EU countries, with France, Italy, and Greece having the highest proportions of centenarians. In 2025, Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital, surpassed Tokyo, Japan\u2019s capital, to become the world\u2019s most populous city with 42 million residents, followed by Dhaka, Bangladesh (37 million), and Tokyo (33 million). This shift resulted from the UN\u2019s updated methodology for classifying urban, rural, and suburban areas, which provides more consistent population estimates.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 07:44 PM\nSource:[En Son Haber](https://www.ensonhaber.com/dunya/dunya-nufusu-2025-yilinda-82-milyari-gecti)\n\n**World Population Exceeds 8 Billion: Global Trends and Projections for 2025 and Beyond**\nThe world population has surpassed 8 billion, according to United Nations data, with estimates placing it between 8.2 and 8.3 billion as of January 2026. Worldometer's projections indicate that approximately 59% of the global population resides in Asia, 19% in Africa, 9% in Europe, 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and about 5% in North America. The world population is projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2060. As of 2025, 16 countries have populations exceeding 100 million. China and India, the two most populous nations, together account for roughly one-third of the world\u2019s population. India, with 1.46 billion people, and China, with 1.41 billion, are followed by five countries with over 200 million: the United States (347 million), Indonesia (285 million), Pakistan (255 million), Nigeria (237 million), and Brazil (212 million). Countries with populations between 100 and 200 million include Bangladesh, Russia, Ethiopia, Mexico, Japan, Egypt, the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Vietnam. Notably, no country with all territory in Europe has a population over 100 million; Germany, with 80 million, is the closest. This reflects Europe\u2019s declining population growth and challenges related to aging populations and migration. China, like several European nations, is also grappling with low birth rates. After implementing a one-child policy from 1979 to 2015, China has seen a historic decline in fertility, rapid population aging, and a shrinking workforce. As of January 1, 2026, China began applying a 13% value-added tax on contraceptives, reversing a 1993 policy that had exempted them from taxation. China\u2019s total population has declined steadily over the past three years and lost its title as the world\u2019s most populous country to India in 2023. In Italy, the number of people aged 100 and over doubled from 2009 to 2025, reaching 23,548, with 82.6% being women. The number of centenarians is rising rapidly across the European Union, with France, Italy, and Greece having the highest proportions. Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital, surpassed Tokyo as the world\u2019s most populous city in 2025 with 42 million residents, followed by Dhaka (37 million) and Tokyo (33 million).

A New World Order**\nAccording to demographic projections by the U.S. Census Bureau, analyzed by American and European media, the 21st century will mark a fundamental demographic shift. By 2100, Africa is expected to become the world's primary human reservoir, with its population growing by approximately 155% between 2030 and 2100. Countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, and Niger are projected to see population increases of over 100 million each, leading to new megacities and global centers of influence. However, this growth will place immense pressure on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and governance. In contrast, China's population is forecasted to decline from about 1.4 billion to 662 million by 2100, resulting in significant economic and geopolitical consequences. Eastern Asia and Europe will face prolonged demographic stagnation, aging populations, shrinking labor forces, and declining economic potential. India remains an exception, projected to maintain a population of around 1.5 billion, preserving both demographic scale and economic dynamism. Azerbaidjan, positioned between the aging North and growing South, is not facing a demographic collapse nor explosive growth. Instead, it must navigate a complex challenge: retaining its youth, attracting skilled professionals, and adapting to regional migration flows. Its geographic location and role as a transport, energy, and technology hub could turn demographic stability into a strategic advantage if it successfully integrates into a Eurasian corridor by mid-century. Otherwise, it risks a 'quiet brain drain' to wealthier, aging economies. The article concludes that future global power will not be determined by population size or currency reserves, but by a country's ability to manage demographic change as a form of real political, economic, and security power.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[\"Insan Haqlar\u0131 U\u011frunda\" \u0130ctimai Birlik](https://haqqin.az/analytics/369279)\n\n**India, China, Europe, & The US Are On Very Different Population Paths**\nThe UN\u2019s latest demographic projections, visualised in a Voronoi chart, show that India and China will continue to dominate global population figures through 2100, but their trajectories diverge sharply. China\u2019s population, already falling, is projected to shrink to about 630\u202fmillion by 2100, while India is expected to grow for nearly four decades, peaking at roughly 1.7\u202fbillion in 2060 before easing to about 1.5\u202fbillion by 2100. In contrast, the United States is projected to rise modestly to around 420\u202fmillion by the end of the century, and Europe\u2019s population, which peaked near 750\u202fmillion in 2020, is expected to decline to about 590\u202fmillion by 2100\u2014close to China\u2019s projected size. The UN model is the most widely used baseline, but projections vary with different assumptions about fertility, life expectancy and migration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 02:10 AM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/india-china-europe-us-are-very-different-population-paths)\n\n**India Faces End of Its 'Demographic Dividend' - IRIS**\nIn 2023 the United Nations announced that India\u2019s population had surpassed China\u2019s, making India the world\u2019s most populous country with 1.426\u202fbillion people.
