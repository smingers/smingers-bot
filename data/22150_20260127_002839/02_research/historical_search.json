The article does not provide specific long-term projections for US vs. China population comparisons extending to 2200.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/india-china-europe-and-the-united-states-are-on-very-different-population-paths\">\n# Summary of Article: \"India, China, Europe, and the United States are on very different population paths\"\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Question:\n\n**United States Population Projections:**\n- The US is expected to grow slowly and steadily\n- Projected to reach approximately **420 million people by 2100**\n\n**China Population Projections:**\n- China's population has already begun to fall\n- Projected to more than halve to around **630 million by 2100**\n\n**Comparative Context:**\n- India is expected to reach about 1.7 billion people in 2060 and gradually decline to around 1.5 billion by 2100\n- Europe's population peaked around 750 million in 2020 and is expected to fall to about 590 million by 2100\n\n**Source and Reliability:**\n- These projections are from the **UN's latest demographic projections**\n- The UN model is described as \"the most widely used baseline for international population comparisons\"\n- The article explicitly notes that \"all population projections are sensitive to the underlying assumptions\"\n- Other research groups use different demographic assumptions about fertility, life expectancy, and migration to reach different long-term population figures\n\n## Important Caveats:\nThe article only provides projections through 2100, not 2200 as required by the forecasting question. The projections show the US at 420 million and China at 630 million by 2100, meaning China would still have a significantly larger population at that point.\n\n**Note:** The article contains several other sections on unrelated topics (stomach cancer in Japan, suicide rates in Lithuania, asteroids, Malaysian nutrition, and diarrheal diseases), which are not relevant to the population forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://table.media/en/china/opinion/declining-birthrates-what-ancient-rome-can-teach-china-about-demographic-collapse\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete, showing primarily the article's metadata and website navigation elements rather than the full article text.

I'll extract all relevant information, though only the China fertility section directly relates to the forecasting question.\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Forecasting Question:\n\n### China's Fertility Rate and Population Trends:\n1. **Current fertility rate**: China's fertility rate has fallen to **one child per woman** in recent years (as of the article's writing)\n2. **Historical context**: \n   - China's fertility rate had already fallen quickly in the early 1970s, before the one-child policy was implemented nationally in 1980\n   - During the one-child policy era (1980-2016), fertility rates never dropped close to one due to various exceptions and enforcement variations\n3. **One-child policy ended in 2016**, with the government now encouraging larger families\n4. **Current drivers**: The fall in fertility today is driven less by policy and more by social and economic changes\n5. **Population projection**: The article notes that \"cohort fertility\" (children the average woman will actually have over her lifetime) is \"likely higher than one, but still low enough that the population will continue to shrink\"\n\n**Note:** The article states definitively that China's population \"will continue to shrink\" based on current fertility trends, even accounting for cohort fertility rates being somewhat higher than the total fertility rate of one.\n\n## Other Topics Covered (Not Directly Relevant to Question):\nThe article also discusses Japan's stomach cancer mortality decline, Lithuania's suicide rate trends, asteroid tracking, Malaysia's childhood nutrition challenges, oral rehydration therapy access in Africa, and global cancer deaths.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/04/china-america-borthrate-ageing-population-output-growth-economy/\">\n# Summary of Fortune Article on China's Fertility Crisis\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**China's Economic Projections:**\n- China's potential output growth could fall from around 4% in the 2020s to less than 2% by the 2050s (Oxford Economics report)\n- China's fertility rates have fallen below \"replacement levels\" (where new workers equal those leaving employment)\n\n**Birth Rates (2025, per 1,000 people):**\n- China: 7.24 live births\n- United States: 11\n- Canada: 9.82\n- United Kingdom: 10\n\n**Dependency Ratio Shifts (2010-2060):**\n- China: 60 percentage point shift\n- Thailand: ~40 percentage points\n- Brazil: ~35 percentage points\n- United States: ~10 percentage points\n- United Kingdom: ~15 percentage points\n\nNote: Dependency ratio = working age population (16+) compared with people 65 or older\n\n**U.S. Debt Projections:**\n- America's debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 250% by 2060 due to supporting aging population\n\n**U.S. Immigration Impact:**\n- If U.S. immigration grew from 1.1 million in 2023 to 1.5 million by 2033 and stabilized, it would provide \"a notable boost to economic potential by 2050\"\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Oxford Economics (Marco Santaniello and Benjamin Trevis):**\n- Pressure from aging populations will be \"felt most acutely in developing economies like China and Brazil, where populations are still relatively young but aging fast\"\n- Developed economies have higher starting dependency ratios but will rise more slowly\n- Immigration can help ease strain by increasing working-age population\n- Without reform (raising retirement ages, boosting labor force participation), many welfare systems risk becoming unsustainable\n\n**Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO):**\n- Called for national conversation about retirement savings rather than relying on state support\n- Noted retirement support is adequate for Fortune 500 employees but problematic beyond that\n\n## Other Opinions (Less Reliable/Anecdotal):\n\n**Elon Musk:**\n- Stated \"Low birth rates will end civilization\" in response to declining American birth rates\n\n## Contextual Information:\n\nThe article frames China's demographic challenges as potentially limiting its ability to rival U.S. economic dominance long-term, citing shrinking labor force, lower consumption, reduced business investment, slower innovation, and increased government debt as consequences of the fertility crisis.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Summarize major UN, US Census, and academic projections comparing China and U.S. total population; identify any scenario where U.S. population exceeds China before 2200; include numeric crossover year if projected.\nMajor publicly-available projections from the United Nations (UN), the U.S. Census Bureau, and academic demographers all paint the same broad picture: China\u2019s population has already begun a long decline while the United States continues to edge upward, but none of the central (baseline) scenarios shows the U.S. overtaking China before the end of the 21st century.  A crossover becomes conceivable only in low-probability \u201ctail\u201d scenarios or in projections that run beyond 2100, for which little authoritative data are yet published.\n\n1.  United Nations \u2013 World Population Prospects 2024 revision  \n   \u2022 2024 base-year sizes: China 1.42 billion; United States 0.345 billion (Population Connection summary of WPP 2024).  \n   \u2022 Peak and decline: China peaked in 2020 and is projected to fall to 1.26 billion in 2050, 0.87 billion in 2080 and 0.633 billion in 2100. The U.S. rises steadily to 0.381 billion in 2050 and 0.421 billion in 2100 (Population Connection; Our World in Data chart based on WPP 2024).  \n   \u2022 Crossover test: Even by 2100 China still has about 1.5 times the U.S. population (633 m vs 421 m), so no crossover occurs within the UN\u2019s published horizon.\n\n2.  U.S. Census Bureau \u2013 International Data Base (IDB) 2024 update  \n   \u2022 The Census Bureau\u2019s November 2024 release confirms the same direction of change\u2014continued growth for the U.S. driven by immigration and sustained contraction for China\u2014but the accompanying tip sheet does not list headline numbers. Earlier IDB tables (pre-2024) placed China near 770 m and the U.S. near 435 m in 2100, reinforcing the conclusion that China remains larger through that year.  \n   \u2022 The IDB\u2019s methodological notes mirror the UN\u2019s: low fertility in China (\u22481.1) versus slightly higher fertility plus positive net migration in the U.S.  \n   \u2022 Because the detailed 2024 IDB spreadsheet is not cited in the news release, precise 2100 figures cannot be quoted here; however, every IDB vintage to date has kept China\u2019s 2100 population above the U.S. baseline.\n\n3.  Academic projection \u2013 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) / The Lancet 2020 study  \n   \u2022 Reference scenario (business-as-usual): world population peaks in 2064.  In 2100 China falls to 0.732 billion (\u221248% from 2017) while the U.S. reaches 0.336 billion (IHME paper and Guardian summary).  China is still more than twice as populous.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSDG high-education & contraception\u201d scenario (accelerated fertility decline): China could shrink to about 0.456 billion by 2100, while the U.S. might be 0.336 billion.  That narrows the gap to roughly 120 million but does not eliminate it in the central estimate.  \n   \u2022 Uncertainty intervals matter.  IHME gives a 95% UI of 456\u20131 499 million for China and 248\u2013456 million for the U.S. in 2100.  At the extreme low end for China and extreme high end for the U.S., a crossover in 2100 is just within the statistical envelope\u2014but it is not the most likely outcome.\n\n4.  What happens after 2100?  \n   \u2022 None of the three institutions has yet released official population tables out to 2200.  Qualitatively, the drivers that keep shrinking China\u2019s population\u2014fertility well below replacement and very limited immigration\u2014are expected to persist, while the U.S. is projected to benefit from continuing net in-migration.  If those trajectories continue uninterrupted, a U.S.\u2013China crossover sometime in the 22nd century becomes plausible, but no published model gives a numeric year.\n\n5.  Comparing driver assumptions  \n   \u2022 Fertility: WPP 2024 puts China\u2019s total fertility rate (TFR) at 1.01 and the U.S. at 1.62 in 2024 (Statisticstimes table based on UN data).  \n   \u2022 Migration: UN and Census Bureau both assume modestly positive net migration for the U.S. through 2100 and almost zero for China.  \n   \u2022 Mortality: Life expectancy gaps have narrowed; UN 2024 shows only a 1.4-year advantage for the U.S. (79.5 vs 78.0).  Mortality differences therefore play a minor role in the relative outlook.\n\n6.  Bottom-line comparison through 2100  \n\n| Projection source | China 2100 (millions) | U.S. 2100 (millions) | China \u00f7 U.S. | Crossover before 2100? |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| UN WPP 2024 (medium) | 633 | 421 | 1.50 | No |\n| U.S. Census IDB 2024 (baseline)* | ~770 | ~435 | ~1.8 | No |\n| IHME 2020 (reference) | 732 | 336 | 2.18 | No |\n| IHME 2020 (low-fertility alt.) | 456 | 336 | 1.36 | Only in low-probability tails |\n\n*Exact 2100 numbers not in press tip sheet but consistent with earlier IDB vintages.\n\n7.  Scenarios pointing to a possible U.S. lead  \n   \u2022 IHME\u2019s wide uncertainty interval is the only published analysis that statistically allows a U.S. edge by 2100, and even then only when China hits its lower 2\u00bd-percentile and the U.S. its upper 97\u00bd-percentile.  \n   \u2022 Beyond 2100, absent a Chinese fertility rebound or large-scale immigration, straightforward extrapolation suggests China could fall below 400 million early in the 22nd century while U.S. population plateaus around 450 million, implying a crossover perhaps in the 2110-2150 window.  Because no institution has yet released official numbers, this remains speculative.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\u2022 The newly updated (Nov 2024) Census IDB spreadsheets need to be consulted for exact 2100 figures for both countries.  \n\u2022 No mainstream projection yet extends to 2200; long-range modeling from the UN or other agencies, when available, will be required to pinpoint a crossover year.  \n\u2022 A dedicated sensitivity analysis that combines very low Chinese fertility, higher mortality due to aging, and continued U.S. immigration would clarify just how soon after 2100 a crossover becomes the median expectation.\n\nGiven the high degree of concordance among current baselines, additional open-source searches would only refine numbers already directionally clear; therefore no further search queries are proposed at this stage.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1.
