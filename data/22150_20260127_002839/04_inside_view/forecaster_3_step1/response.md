Analysis:
1. Source analysis:
 • UN World Population Prospects 2024 provides a robust baseline: with China declining from its 1.42‐billion peak to roughly 633 million by 2100 versus the US growing to about 421 million, the UN data indicate that China remains significantly larger through 2100.
 • The US Census Bureau’s International Data Base (2024 update) reinforces the UN’s picture, with its historical tables (pre-2024) consistently placing China above the US (e.g., roughly 770 million vs. 435 million in 2100). Their methodology—low fertility for China (around 1.1) compared to a modestly higher fertility plus net migration boost for the US—is standard and reliable.
 • Academic work (e.g., the IHME/Lancet 2020 study) further supports the view: even under a reference scenario, China’s 2100 population is around 732 million while the US is lower, and only in a “low-fertility alternative” scenario do the extreme tails (e.g., the lower 2.5% for China combined with the upper 2.5% for the US) bring the populations closer—a crossover that is only borderline within the uncertainty interval.
 • Additional reporting (e.g., Fortune, Our World in Data, and commentary by experts like Yi Fuxian) also note that absent a dramatic reversal in China’s demographics or unprecedented US demographic acceleration, baseline projections show China remaining well above the US. Opinions here are informed by expert economic and demographic analyses but are consistent with the quantitative projections in the UN/Census/IHME reports.
 In summary, all these sources offer historically anchored, expert-vetted data that are largely convergent in establishing a low likelihood of a US–China crossover before 2100, with any possibility confined to extreme tail events or speculative extrapolations beyond 2100.

2. Reference class analysis:
 • One useful reference class is the long‐term demographic evolution of high-income, low-fertility societies (e.g., Japan, Western Europe, and the US), where even with modest net migration, growth tends to be slow.
 • Another reference class is that of countries experiencing rapid fertility declines (e.g., China, Japan), where sustained below‐replacement fertility leads to long-term population decrease.
 • Given that reliable projections (up to 2100) consistently show China remaining above the US under central scenarios—and even the tail scenario from IHME only marginally allows a crossover—the most suitable reference class is that of countries with persistent demographic momentum (decline for China and slow growth for the US). This class suggests that a crossover in the foreseeable future (through at least the end of the 21st century) is very unlikely.

3. Timeframe analysis:
 • The prediction window extends from today (January 27, 2026) until the year 2200—that is, a horizon of nearly 174 years.
 • Historical demographic shifts of this magnitude are typically gradual. The underlying drivers (very low fertility in China, modest but steady US growth driven largely by net immigration) have been in place for decades, and no credible scenario based on current trajectory shows a rapid reversal.

4. Justification:
 • All central baseline projections (UN, US Census, and academic studies) clearly show China maintaining a population lead through 2100.
 • Extrapolating beyond 2100, one can envision that if China’s persistently low fertility (and near-zero net immigration) leads to continued contraction, while the US’s modest growth (aided by immigration) allows it to plateau or even increase slowly, then a crossover might occur sometime in the early-to-mid 22nd century.
 • However, such a crossover remains confined to the tail end of the uncertainty distribution. In the IHME study, only extreme combinations (the very low Chinese outcomes at the 2.5th percentile and very high US outcomes at the 97.5th percentile) even allow a crossover by 2100. Extrapolations beyond are even more speculative given the lack of official data.
 • Therefore, while the tail (or “inside view” in a scenario of extremely adverse Chinese demographic trends coupled with unusually high US immigration and fertility) leaves room for a crossover, the dominant (“outside view”) is that it is a low-probability event.

Outside view calibration:
Based on the convergence of these high-quality sources, the baseline probability that the US population overtakes China’s before 2200 is very low. The central estimates show no crossover up through 2100, and only the extreme tails of uncertainty suggest a possibility, albeit a marginal one. Considering the long-term inertia in demographic trends and the inherent uncertainties in projections beyond 2100, I estimate that there is roughly a 1-in-12 chance (about 8%) that the US will experience a population crossover prior to 2200.

Outside View Prediction:
I assign an 8% probability to the event that the population of the United States will be higher than that of the People’s Republic of China at any point before the year 2200.
