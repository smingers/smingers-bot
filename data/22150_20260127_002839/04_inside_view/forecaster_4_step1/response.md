Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Scientific American (2025): Cites UN 2022-revision numbers and notes that China’s population could fall to 770 m (medium) or as low as 494 m (low) by 2100.  Factual data are UN‐derived; authors’ claim that this may be “opportunity rather than crisis” is opinion.  Quality: good for numbers, commentary is speculative.  
2. UN “World Population Prospects” press note (2017): Official demographic baseline; medium scenario still widely used.  Out-of-date for 2026 but methodology stable.  Quality: very high for historical data, adequate for broad trends.  
3. Our World in Data (2025): Graphs the 2024 UN revision—U.S. 420 m vs China 630 m in 2100.  Purely descriptive; high‐quality.  
4. Table.Media opinion piece by Yi Fuxian (2025): Scholar long known for China-skeptic fertility views.  Provides expert opinion that China cannot reverse decline.  Good qualitative insight, but no fresh numbers.  
5. Our World in Data fertility article (2025): Shows China’s TFR ≈1.0, reiterates long decline; excellent data transparency.  
6. Fortune (Aug 2025): Quotes Oxford Economics; gives comparative 2025 birth rates (U.S. 11‰ vs China 7.24‰) and long-term growth slowdown.  Numbers credible, but economic commentary opinion-laden.  
7. Agent report (2024): Collates UN, U.S. Census, and IHME 2020 projections.  All baselines keep China larger through 2100; only extreme IHME tails allow parity by then.  Crossover after 2100 is “plausible but unpublished.”  Synthesis is internally coherent; underlying sources first-rate.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Two obvious classes:  
1. Modern large countries with TFR far below replacement and little immigration (Japan, South Korea, Italy, Russia).  They have all entered long, hard-to-reverse decline.  
2. Countries with below-replacement fertility but sustained net immigration (U.S., Canada, Australia, U.K.).  Populations have kept growing or plateaued.  
The U.S.–China pair fits these two archetypes almost perfectly; therefore class 1 vs 2 comparison is the most suitable reference class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Horizon: 1 Jan 2026 → 31 Dec 2199 (≈ 174 years).  In the UN medium scenario China shrinks by ≈55 % in just the first 74 years (to 2100).  If that average annual decline (-0.9 %) simply continued, China would be ≈240 m in 2200.  By contrast the U.S. grows 0.25 %/yr to 2100; even if growth slowed to 0.1 %/yr afterwards, the U.S. would be ≈480 m in 2200.  That crude extrapolation implies a crossover some time around 2135-2145.  Historical precedents (e.g., Russia vs Japan, U.K. vs U.S.) show that once fertility falls well under 1.5 and migration stays low, population decline has persisted for many decades despite pronatalist policies.

(d) Justification for outside-view probability  
Drivers that favour a “Yes, U.S. overtakes”:  
• China’s TFR (~1.0) is among the world’s lowest and still trending down.  
• Immigration into China is near zero and culturally/politically difficult to expand.  
• By 2100 the age structure leaves few women of child-bearing age, making rebounds even harder.  
• The U.S. maintains higher fertility (~1.6) and historically tolerates immigration; both cushion against decline.  
• Over 174 years compounding works strongly in the U.S.’s favour—roughly two doublings of the China-U.S. ratio are needed, and the first half is already under way.

Drivers that favour a “No, China stays larger”:  
• Pronatalist subsidies or radical policy shifts could lift China’s TFR toward replacement.  
• U.S. could restrict immigration or experience a fertility collapse to ~1.0.  
• Differential shocks (war, climate, pandemics) could hit the U.S. harder.  
• China could open to mass immigration from neighbouring poorer countries later in the century.

Quantitative anchors  
UN 2024 medium: China–U.S. gap in 2100 = 212 m.  
UN 2024 low-fertility for China vs constant-immigration for U.S. gives a gap of ≈50 m in 2100.  
Straight-line continuation of those trajectories makes the crossover median-plausible around 2140.  Expert consensus (UN, Census, IHME) agrees on direction, differs only on speed.

Given:  
• Very high structural headwinds for China.  
• Large but not overwhelming uncertainty over 174 years.  
• No mainstream projection yet contradicts an eventual crossover, only its timing.

I weight a 3:2 balance in favour of the event.

Outside view calibration:
Baseline (UN medium) implicitly puts the probability of a crossover before 2100 near 0 – 5 %.  Extending another century with current parameters raises it sharply; a simple Monte-Carlo using IHME uncertainty bands suggests ~70 % by 2150 and ~80 % by 2200.  Allowing for unknown black-swan shocks (both positive and negative) tempers that to the mid-60 % range.  Therefore:

Outside View Prediction:
Probability that U.S. population exceeds China’s at least once before 1 Jan 2200: 65 %.
