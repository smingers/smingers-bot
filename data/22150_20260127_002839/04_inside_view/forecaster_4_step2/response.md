Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion)

1. UN World Population Prospects 2024 (baseline used in almost every secondary piece). Facts: medium-variant projects China 1.03 → 0.63 billion, U.S. 0.34 → 0.43 billion between 2023-2100. Quality: gold-standard; methods transparent.

2. CNN 19-Jan-2026. Facts: 2025 Chinese births 7.92 m, deaths 11.3 m (-3.4 m net); TFR ≈ 1.0. Opinions: analysts call the decline “irreversible.” Source high-quality for data.

3. Small Wars Journal 2-Jan-2026. Facts: repeats official totals; quotes Shanghai Academy projection of 525 m Chinese in 2100. Opinion: author skeptical of pro-natalist policy. Moderate quality.

4. NPR 27-Oct-2025. Facts: U.S. TFR 1.6 (record low), Census Bureau expects U.S. population to start shrinking “later this century.” Opinion: worries about Social Security. High-quality for numbers.

5. Newsweek 31-Jan-2025 (GDP story). Facts: UN forecasts China –55 %, U.S. +18 % to 2100; immigration gap highlighted. Opinion: “China’s heft has peaked.” Moderate quality.

6. Foreign Policy 17-Feb-2026. Facts: Joseph Chamie scenario with 10 m immigrants/yr could push U.S. to #1 by 2100. Clearly labelled speculative. Moderate quality; expert author.

7. AskNews bundle (Jan-2026 Chinese-language outlets, RFI, NY Post). Facts: 2025 births at record low, TFR<1; marriage registries plunging. Opinion: CCP policies “laughable.” Data points are consistent with official NBS release. Mixed but mostly factual.

8. Statista, Visual Capitalist, Zero Hedge (late-2025). Facts: repost UN numbers; helpful graphics. Low added value but consistent.

Consensus factual picture: China already losing 3-4 m people/yr with TFR≈1; U.S. still growing +1 %/yr due mainly to immigration (~2.8 m net in 2024) even with TFR 1.6. No reputable demographic model has China > U.S. in 2200; disagreement is on when crossover occurs.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• Structural fertility gap: China ≈1.0 vs U.S. ≈1.6 (multiple official data sets).  
• Immigration asymmetry: U.S. ~1 % of pop./yr net inflow; China ≈0 %.  
• Historical precedent: once large economies hit TFR≤1.5 without immigration (Japan, SK, Italy, Russia) reversal has not occurred over decades.

Moderate evidence
• Under-count of Chinese births and possible faster decline (Yi Fuxian, Shanghai Academy).  
• U.S. long-run Census projection of eventual shrinkage absent policy changes.  
• Political feasibility of future Chinese immigration or U.S. restriction—uncertain but plausible.

Weak evidence
• Speculative “10 m immigrants per year” scenario for U.S.  
• Opinions linking Chinese fertility to Xi-era policies—causal chain not verified.  
• Black-swan catastrophes.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: 174 years (27-Jan-2026 → 31-Dec-2199).  
Half window (≈87 y, to 2113): crossover probability ~40 %.  
Double window (would be 348 y) obviously >90 %.  
Because compounding gaps accelerate, probability climbs roughly 0.3 pp per year after 2100 under median assumptions.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (UN medium) gives 65 % by 2200 (my earlier estimate).  
Updates that push probability upward  
+ Chinese TFR has fallen below even “low-variant” assumption used by UN; 2025 official data confirm four straight years of net decline (strong evidence, +6 %).  
+ Growing expert consensus (Oxford, Eberstadt, Chamie) that pro-natalist measures are failing (moderate evidence, +3 %).  
Updates that push probability downward  
– U.S. fertility hitting record low 1.6 and Census warning of eventual decline (moderate, –2 %).  
– Political risk of sharply reduced U.S. immigration later this century (moderate, –2 %).  
Net shift: +5 percentage points.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view forecast = 70 %.  
Interpretation: In 70 out of 100 parallel timelines, U.S. population tops China’s at least once between now and 2199. 30 times it never happens (either because China levels off at a higher plateau, U.S. collapses first, or an extreme shock intervenes).

Checklist
1. Paraphrase: “Between now (2026) and 31 Dec 2199, will U.S. population ever exceed China’s?”  
2. Base rate used: 65 % (UN 2024 + IHME uncertainty).  
3. Consistency: “70/100 times, the crossover occurs” – yes, matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – China TFR ≈1.0 and still falling.  
   – Four consecutive years of Chinese population shrinkage.  
   – U.S. still growing via immigration (~1 %/yr).  
   – Historical irreversibility of low-fertility declines without migration.  
   – UN medium variant still shows narrowing to 200 m gap by 2100.  
5. Blind-spot: China opens borders mid-22nd C., attracting tens of millions of African or South-Asian migrants annually; probability could drop to <30 %.  
6. Status-quo: Current trajectories already point to eventual crossover; slight nudge toward status quo actually favours “Yes.”

Probability: 70%
