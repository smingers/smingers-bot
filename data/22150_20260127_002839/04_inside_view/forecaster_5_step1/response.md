Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Scientific American (Rieffel & Wang, 2023).  Factual content: China’s population started falling in 2022; UN medium projection puts China at 1.30 bn in 2050 and 0.77 bn in 2100 (high 1.15 bn, low 0.49 bn).  Opinion: authors argue UN may exaggerate the decline.  Reliability: solid secondary source; all numbers trace back to UN WPP.  
2. UN press note on World Population Prospects 2017.  Factual baseline for 2030-2100; high–quality primary demographic model.  Key fact: U.S. continues to grow slowly, China declines.  No explicit data beyond 2100.  
3. Our World in Data (2024 article).  Reproduces UN WPP 2024 medium scenario: U.S. 420 m vs China 630 m in 2100.  Methodologically transparent; data identical to UN.  
4. Table.Media op-ed by Yi Fuxian (2025).  Expert opinion: Chinese demographer known for “low-fertility trap” thesis; argues policy cannot reverse the slide.  Limited numeric detail, but the directional claim—continued shrinkage—is consistent with hard data.  
5. Our World in Data fertility explainer (2025).  Factual: China’s TFR ≈ 1.0; drivers are socioeconomic, not policy.  High-quality database, minimal editorialising.  
6. Fortune (Aug 2025) citing Oxford Economics.  Gives comparative birth-rate figures (China 7.24, U.S. 11 per 1 000) and notes China’s dependency ratio will surge.  Oxford Economics is reputable; article mixes facts and business commentary—numerics are sound.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Countries that fell from very high to below-replacement fertility (Japan, South Korea, Italy).  None has sustainably rebounded above 1.6 births/woman after >30 years.  
2. Population “league-table” reversals caused by one country’s fertility collapse and another’s immigration-supported growth (e.g., Russia vs Pakistan, Germany vs Ethiopia).  
3. Great-power dyads with wide starting gap (>3×) and ≥150-year horizon.  Only India–China provides an exact analog; the reversal occurred when the shrinking country’s fertility remained <1.5 and the growing country stayed >2.  This is a strong match.

Reference class 1 tells us fertility rebounds are rare and shallow.  Class 2 shows that migration-supported countries can overtake much larger low-fertility rivals given enough time.  Class 3 is the closest fit (large gap, very long horizon), so I adopt it as the main outside-view anchor.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 174 years (27 Jan 2026 → 31 Dec 2199).  Over comparable spans in the modern statistical era, three major population reversals (U.K. > France 1800-1950, Germany > Russia 1870-1950, India > China 1950-2023) all occurred despite initial gaps of 50-150 %.  The U.S.–China gap today is ~310 %.  At China’s current –0.9 %/yr trend and U.S. +0.25 %/yr, arithmetic crossover occurs around 2140-2150; even if both rates halve, crossover still arrives before 2200.

(d) Justification  
• Base numbers (UN 2024 medium): China 1.42 bn → 0.63 bn (2100); U.S. 0.34 bn → 0.42 bn.  Extending the same annualised rates another century gives China ≈ 0.23 bn and U.S. ≈ 0.51 bn in 2200—U.S. comfortably larger.  
• Fertility uncertainty: A durable Chinese rebound to 1.8 would still leave the TFR below replacement; population would stabilise only if complemented by sizeable immigration—politically improbable.  By contrast, U.S. net migration has averaged +0.8 % of population for half a century and is assumed positive in every mainstream projection.  
• Tail risks:  
  – Upside China: sustained TFR ≥2.1 or turn to large-scale immigration (>2 m/yr) could keep China >700 m.  Judged <25 % likely given historic precedent and policy constraints.  
  – Downside U.S.: prolonged immigration shut-off plus fertility <1.2 could hold the U.S. near today’s 340 m; probability ≈15 %.  
  – Catastrophic shocks (war, climate, pandemic) might disproportionately hit either country.  Assign 10 % weight to “wild-card” scenarios; split evenly, they do not materially alter the mean odds of crossover.  

Weighting these possibilities with simple scenario probabilities (see calibration) yields an outside-view chance of U.S. overtaking China of roughly 70 %.

Outside view calibration:

Scenario matrix (coarse):

1. Status-quo trends persist (UN-like).  P = 0.45 → U.S. overtakes ~2140.  Outcome = Yes.  
2. Moderate China rebound (TFR ≈ 1.6) & U.S. steady.  P = 0.20 → crossover delayed to 2180-2190 but still before 2200.  Yes.  
3. Strong China rebound or large immigration; U.S. growth muted.  P = 0.15 → no crossover before 2200.  No.  
4. U.S. stagnation (immigration collapses, TFR 1.1) while China trends baseline.  P = 0.10 → no crossover.  No.  
5. Major asymmetric shock favouring one side.  P = 0.10, assume 50-50 split → 0.05 Yes, 0.05 No.

Total Yes probability = 0.45 + 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.70 (70 %).  Giving modest credit for model uncertainty (+/–3 %), I round to 72 % to avoid a false sense of precision while keeping 1 % resolution.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 72 % probability that the United States’ population will exceed that of the People’s Republic of China at least once before the year 2200.
