Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
I reviewed nine recent, date-stamped items plus the UN 2024 World Population Prospects (WPP).

1. UN-WPP 2024 (primary, July 2024).  Factual demographic projections to 2100; transparent methodology; gold-standard baseline.  
2. CNN 19 Jan 2026.  Official 2025 Chinese birth/death totals; cites UN and demographer Yi Fuxian.  High data quality; opinions from named experts.  
3. NPR 27 Oct 2025.  U.S. Census & UN fertility figures; warns the U.S. may begin shrinking late-century.  Reliable; largely factual.  
4. Newsweek 31 Jan 2025.  Summarises UN data; quotes Oxford’s George Magnus.  Moderate quality, but demographics are sourced.  
5. Small Wars Journal 2 Jan 2026.  Collates multiple Chinese statistics; author is an academic; opinionated but numbers align with official data.  
6. Foreign Policy 17 Feb 2026.  Joseph Chamie scenario analysis of U.S. immigration; expert opinion, methodology spelled out.  
7. Statista infographic 26 Jan 2026.  Reprints UN-WPP ageing share; secondary but identical to UN.  
8. New York Post op-ed 25 Jan 2026 (Nicholas Eberstadt).  Well-known demographer; factual basis is NBS and UN; viewpoint pessimistic.  
9. Visual Capitalist 25 Jan 2026.  Re-plots UN and Worldometer numbers; purely descriptive.

Factual content across sources is highly consistent; opinions come from recognised demographers (Chamie, Yi Fuxian, Eberstadt, Magnus).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• UN-WPP medium and low variants: China shrinks to 630 m / 488 m by 2100; U.S. grows to 420 m / 380 m.  
• China’s 2025 TFR ≈ 0.98 and fourth straight year of net decline (CNN, NBS).  Structural, hard to reverse.  
• Historical precedent: no country sustaining TFR < 1.3 for >30 yrs has returned to replacement (Japan, Korea, Italy).  

Moderate evidence  
• U.S. net immigration hit record 2.8 m in 2024 (Visual Capitalist); bipartisan appetite may vary, but migration is an established safety valve.  
• Chamie’s “10 m immigrants” scenario shows how U.S. policy choices could accelerate crossover.  
• NPR & Census flag possible U.S. shrinkage post-2080 if immigration were curtailed—plausible but reversible.

Weak evidence  
• Speculative Chinese incentives (taxing condoms, cash bonuses) reversing fertility—no success so far.  
• Long-range economic projections (OECD, CEBR) indirectly imply demographic paths.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome window: now through 31 Dec 2199 (≈ 63,700 days).  
If the window were halved to 2088, base UN medium still has China > U.S. (630 m v 420 m); my probability would fall to ~45 %.  
If doubled to 2400, odds would climb to >90 % because compounding differences dominate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (72 %) assumed a steady 0.9 %/yr Chinese decline and +0.25 %/yr U.S. rise.  New data since mid-2024 increases the gap:  
• China’s natural decrease in 2025 (-3.4 m) exceeded UN medium expectations by ~0.6 m; TFR already below UN low variant.  
• Multiple analysts (Yi Fuxian, Eberstadt) argue China will undershoot UN low because census under-reported deaths and over-counted births in the 2000s.  This is the same direction and independent, so I upgrade weight from moderate to strong.  
• U.S. growth out-performed UN 2022 revision owing to the immigration rebound; 2024 population 347 m beats the UN by ≈4 m.  

Scenario re-weighting after incorporating the new information:

1. UN-low-like path (China faster decline) – P 0.50 – Yes.  
2. UN-medium path – P 0.25 – Yes (crossover ~2140).  
3. China fertility rebound to 1.6, U.S. immigration steady – P 0.10 – Yes but late 2190s.  
4. Large China rebound/immigration or U.S. restriction – P 0.10 – No.  
5. Wild-card asymmetric shock – P 0.05 – 0.025 Yes / 0.025 No.

Total Yes = 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.10 + 0.025 = 0.875 → 87.5 %.

I temper 1.5 pp for overconfidence and model risk, arriving at 86 %.

Probability calibration
I therefore estimate an 86 % chance that the U.S. population will exceed that of the People’s Republic of China at least once between now and 2200.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 2026 and 2199, will U.S. population ever be larger than China’s?”  
2. Base rate: 72 % (outside view).  
3. Consistency: “About 86 times in 100, the U.S. eventual population overtakes China before 2200.”  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   a) China 2025 TFR ≈ 0.98, historic low, fourth year of shrinkage.  
   b) UN low variant shows China falls below 500 m by 2100, U.S. > 380 m.  
   c) U.S. immigration reached record 2.8 m in 2024, offsetting low fertility.  
   d) No country with decades-long sub-1.3 TFR has ever returned to replacement.  
5. Blind spot: Dramatic U.S. immigration shut-off lasting many decades could cap U.S. at <350 m; would drop probability to ~55 %.  
6. Status-quo: Current trajectories already point toward crossover; no nudge toward “No” needed.

Probability: 86%
