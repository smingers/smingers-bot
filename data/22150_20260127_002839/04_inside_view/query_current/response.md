Analysis:
China’s total population peaked around 2022 and has begun to fall as fertility remains well below replacement and the working-age share shrinks.  Recent UN (2022 Revision) medium-variant projections have China’s population falling to roughly 770 million by 2100, while the U.S. medium-variant grows slowly to about 394 million.  Several demographers note that because China’s fertility could stay very low and its age structure is already top-heavy, the decline may accelerate, whereas U.S. population prospects hinge on immigration and a modestly higher fertility rate.  
Key angles to investigate now:  
• Latest NBS releases confirming the speed of China’s decline in 2023-25.  
• Updated U.S. Census Bureau or CBO projections on fertility, mortality and immigration after the 2020-24 pandemic shock.  
• Scholarly or multilateral long-range projections that extend beyond the usual 2100 horizon (e.g., UN “Long-range 2300” studies, Wittgenstein Centre scenarios, Lancet IHME 2024 update).  
• News analyses asking whether—and when—the United States could overtake China, citing the above data.  
These sources will clarify whether crossover is viewed as plausible before 2200 and which demographic, migration or policy changes would be required.
