The only concrete data point provided is for China.\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **China's projected 2100 population: 633,368,112** (approximately 633.4 million people)\n\n### Limitations:\n\nThe extracted content does not contain:\n- United States population projections for any year\n- Comparative data between US and China populations\n- Methodology or source information for the projections\n- Any intermediate year projections between present day and 2100\n- Any projections beyond 2100 (the question asks about events before 2200)\n- Expert opinions or analysis\n\nThe content appears to be mainly a list of countries and regions available on the website rather than a substantive article with analysis or comprehensive data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/india-china-europe-and-the-united-states-are-on-very-different-population-paths\">\n# Summary of Article: \"India, China, Europe, and the United States are on very different population paths\"\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Question:\n\n**United States Population Projections:**\n- The US is expected to grow slowly and steadily, reaching approximately **420 million people by 2100**\n- The article characterizes this growth as gradual and consistent\n\n**China Population Projections:**\n- China's population has already begun to fall\n- Projected to more than halve to around **630 million by 2100**\n\n**Context:**\n- These projections are based on the UN's latest demographic projections\n- The curves are shaped by UN expectations for future fertility, life expectancy, and migration worldwide\n- Together, India, China, Europe, and the United States account for about half of today's world population\n\n**Important Caveat:**\n- The UN's model is described as \"the most widely used baseline for international population comparisons\"\n- However, the article explicitly notes that **\"all population projections are sensitive to the underlying assumptions\"**\n- Other research groups use different demographic assumptions about fertility, life expectancy, and migration to reach different long-term population figures\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nBased on these UN projections through 2100, the US population (420 million) would remain significantly lower than China's population (630 million) by the end of the century. However, the article only provides data through 2100, not through 2200 as required by the forecasting question. The article does not discuss projections beyond 2100.\n\n**Note:** The article contains additional sections on unrelated topics (stomach cancer in Japan, suicide rates in Lithuania, asteroids, Malaysian childhood nutrition, and diarrheal diseases) which are not relevant to the population forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-population-could-shrink-to-half-by-2100/\">\n# Summary of \"China's Population Could Shrink to Half by 2100\"\n\n**Source:** Scientific American  \n**Authors:** Lex Rieffel, Xueqing Wang\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Current Population Trends:\n- China's population: 1.4 billion (no longer the world's largest)\n- India surpassed China as most populous country in 2023\n- China's population began shrinking in 2022\n\n### UN Projections:\n- China's population could fall to 1.3 billion by 2050\n- Could plummet to only 770 million by 2100 (UN medium scenario)\n- UN high scenario for 2100: 1.15 billion\n- UN low scenario for 2100: 494 million\n\n### Historical Population Data:\n- 1980: China's population was around 980 million\n- 2020: China's population peaked at around 1.4 billion\n\n### Dependency Ratios (dependents per 100 working-age people):\n- 1980: 68 per 100\n- 2020: 44 per 100 (more favorable)\n- Projected 2085: 89 per 100 (potentially socially destabilizing level, per authors' calculation)\n\n### Total Fertility Rate (TFR):\n- China's TFR in 1970: 5.8\n- China's TFR in 2022: 1.18 (UN estimate, one of the lowest in the world)\n- Replacement level TFR: 2.1\n- For comparison: Niger had world's highest TFR in 2020 at 6.89; South Korea had lowest at 0.89\n\n### Policy History:\n- Pre-1979: Pronatalist policy (promoted high birth rates)\n- 1979: One-child policy adopted\n- 2015: Two-child policy introduced\n- 2021: Three-child policy introduced\n- 2023: President Xi Jinping called for \"a new type of marriage and childbearing culture\"\n\n### Comparative Context:\n- **India:** Dependency ratio of 47, median age of 27.9, population still growing but showing signs of future transition\n- **Japan:** Dependency ratio of 71, median age of 48.7, population forecast to fall from 125 million (2020) to 75 million (2100)\n\n## Authors' Opinions/Analysis:\n\nThe authors suggest that China's declining population \"could be a cause for opportunity rather than a crisis\" and that China could stabilize at around one billion by 2100, potentially remaining a global superpower with prosperous citizens.\n\nThe authors criticize the UN forecasting methodology, stating that people who view China's low fertility rate as a crisis are \"misled by a common forecasting practice\" of extrapolating the current TFR of 1.18 indefinitely into the future, which they suggest leads to \"unrealistic conclusions.\"\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so this summary may be missing concluding arguments or additional analysis.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/11/peak-china-economy-dominance\">\n# Summary of \"Why Peak China may finally have arrived\" by George Magnus\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**GDP Comparisons (China vs US):**\n- 2008: China's GDP was ~$14 trillion, approximately 1/3 of US GDP\n- 2021: China's GDP rose to 3/4 of US GDP ($23.7 trillion)\n- 2024: China's GDP is $18 trillion (62% of US's ~$30 trillion)\n- GDP per capita: China remains at only 20% of US levels\n\n**Global GDP Share:**\n- China's share rose from 3.5% (2000) to 18.5% (2021)\n- Since 2021, it has declined to approximately 16.5%\n\n**Demographic and Structural Indicators:**\n- Working age and total population are in \"relentless decline\"\n- Urbanization rate is just over 60% and \"flattening out\"\n- Productivity growth has stalled\n- China's share of global manufacturing exports and production has leveled off\n\n**Property Sector:**\n- At peak, accounted for more than a quarter of the economy\n- Facing structural downturn due to lower household formation rates, smaller cohorts of first-time buyers, and chronic oversupply\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Li Qiang (China's Premier), December 2024 Central Economic Work Conference:**\n- Stated that \"the foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth was not strong\"\n- Acknowledged weak demand\n- Cited pressures on job creation\n- Referenced \"fiscal difficulties\" among several local governments\n\n## Author's Analysis (George Magnus -
