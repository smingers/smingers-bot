India is now expected to surpass China as the world's most populous country in 2023.\n\n4. **Regional Economic Context:** For the first time in three decades, the growth rate of Asian developing countries would surpass that of China (according to a September 2022 projection by the Asian Development Bank).\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **Lowy Institute (Roland Rajah, lead economist):** China's economy will \"experience much slower growth going forward\" due to demographic and external headwinds. A Lowy report projected China would become the world's biggest economy by 2030, but \"its size advantage over America would be slim and it would remain far less prosperous and productive per person than the United States and other rich countries, even by mid-century.\"\n\n2. **Japan Center for Economic Research:** Previously predicted China would surpass the U.S. in 2028 (two years prior), but in a December 2022 forecast stated that \"China's GDP will not surpass that of the United States.\"\n\n3. **Kishore Mahbubani (Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore):** Views 2022 as likely an aberration, noting \"the last 30 years of China's performance still remain the best in China's history.\"\n\n4. **Mary Lovely (Peterson Institute for International Economics):** The shift to consumption-led growth requires many difficult changes and poses challenges for China's political system.\n\n5. **Scott Kennedy (Center for Strategic and International Studies):** \"Xi Jinping in the last year has really made companies question China's basic competence.\" China needs to win back confidence from domestic population and global business community.\n\n6. **Li Mingjiang (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore):** Notes that political and policy elites in Asian countries now have \"doubts\" about how soon\u2014or if\u2014China will surpass the U.S., leading them to want to diversify and avoid overreliance on China.\n\n## Context on Long-term Trends:\n\nThe article identifies China's long-term challenges as slower growth, low productivity, and a graying, shrinking population, prompting recalculations of China's projected path to become the No. 1 economic superpower.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/india-could-surpass-us-china-to-become-worlds-largest-economy-by-century-end-512815-2026-01-25\">\n# Summary of Article: India could surpass US, China to become world's largest economy by century end\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n1. **OECD Long-term Economic Projections (released September 2025):**\n   - India expected to overtake the US by 2060\n   - India projected to be almost twice the size of China by end of century (2100)\n   - US will slip to third place in the 2040s but catch up with China again in 2070\n\n2. **UN Population Division Projections (released 2024):**\n   - China's population declines much faster than previously expected\n   - Most of China's population decline expected in second half of the century\n   - China's population projected at approximately 650 million people by 2100\n   - China's labor force projected at less than 300 million by 2100 (barely 40% of India's, and not much larger than the US)\n   - India would still have the largest population in the world in 2100, even with a decline starting in 2060\n   - India's labor force participation expected to rise from 50% to 70% by 2100\n\n3. **Alternative Projection - Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) 'World Economic League Table 2024':**\n   - Also forecasts India will surpass US and China by end of century\n   - Projects India's GDP to be 90% larger than China's and 30% larger than the US\n   - Forecasts India's steady growth averaging 6.5% from 2024 to 2028\n\n**Named Source Opinions:**\n\n- **Bert Hofman** (Senior Associate Fellow at MERICS and director of the East Asian Institute at National University of Singapore):\n  - States big changes are likely in the second half of this century\n  - Notes that \"demographics plays a big part, and India's projected margin over China in size of GDP by the end of the century is very large, so it seems safe to say India will be the largest economy by then\"\n  - Acknowledges China could beat projections by applying AI and robotics faster than India/US, or if labor share stays below model levels\n  - Emphasizes OECD scenarios are \"not predictions\" but illustrate long-run challenges and how the landscape might evolve\n\n**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**\n\nThis article provides concrete population projections relevant to the US-China population comparison question, specifically citing UN Population Division 2024 data showing China's population declining to ~650 million by 2100 while noting the US labor force would be comparable in size.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/29/china-population-decline-demographics-ecomomic-growth/\">\n# Summary of Foreign Policy Article (February 17, 2026)\n\n**Author:** Howard W. French\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### UN Population Division Projections (newly released revision):\n- **By 2100:** China's population projected at approximately 765 million (half of India's 1.53 billion)\n- **By 2050:** India projected to have 1.67 billion people, approximately 300 million more than China\n- **2026:** China's population has begun declining this year, **nine years earlier** than predicted in 2019\n- **2023:** India's population will surpass China's, **seven years earlier** than predicted in the 2019 revision\n\n### Historical Context:\n- **2009:** Martin Jacques published \"When China Rules the World,\" predicting China would surpass US in GDP by mid-2030s\n- **2001:** Gordon Chang published \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" predicting Communist Party rule wouldn't survive beyond 2010\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Yi Fuxian** (University of Wisconsin-Madison, longtime analyst of China's population dynamics):\n- Believes UN projections don't go far enough\n- Cites leaked Chinese documents showing China's present population is **1.28 billion** rather than the officially claimed **1.41 billion**\n\n**Howard W.

China benefited from a \"demographic dividend\" (population skewed toward young working-age people) during its ascent\n2. This balance is now \"shifting in the opposite direction\" with \"astonishing speed\"\n3. Population decline coupled with aging will pressure resources away from global diplomacy/military toward social security, health insurance, and retirement systems\n4.

Identify any years when U.S. population exceeds China's and cite sources. Outline key demographic assumptions behind projections. Present historical trend since 1950 for context.\nBelow is a consolidated answer that synthesises everything that could be located in the open-access material retrieved so far.\n\n1. Historical baseline 1950-2024  \n\u2022 The UN World Population Prospects (WPP) 2024 revision gives a full back-series to 1950.  Key anchor points reproduced by Our World in Data show:  \n  \u2013 1950\u2003China \u2248 544 million vs United States \u2248 158 million.  \n  \u2013 2024\u2003China \u2248 1.41 billion vs United States \u2248 339 million.  \n  The U.S. has therefore never exceeded 29 % of China\u2019s population since 1950 (Our World in Data, drawing on UN/WPP).\n\n2. Long-range projection sets to be compared\n\nA. United Nations \u201cWorld Population to 2300\u201d (Department of Economic & Social Affairs, 2004)  \n\u2022 Coverage: every country in five-year steps from 2000 to 2300 (Tables A.15 for China, A.18 for the United States).  \n\u2022 2100 figure in the companion WPP-2024 medium variant (the UN\u2019s latest 100-year horizon) is China 1.06 billion and U.S. 394 million.  \n\u2022 Narrative statement in the 2004 report and launch press briefings says that in the UN medium path \u201cChina remains the second most populous country in 2300, with the United States still third\u201d (Projects.mcrit synopsis).  That statement implies no U.S.\u2013China crossover occurs at any point up to 2200.  \n\u2022 Demographic assumptions: each country\u2019s total fertility rate (TFR) converges slowly back to replacement (~2.0) during the 22nd century; life expectancy rises into the mid-90s by the 23rd century; migration follows recent historical averages; no explicit climate-, conflict- or pandemic-shock module.  \n\u2022 Exact 2200 totals remain behind the original PDF annex; hence only the ordinal conclusion (China > U.S.) can presently be documented.\n\nB. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease forecast published in The Lancet, July 2020  \n\u2022 Coverage: 2018\u20132100.  \n\u2022 Headline 2100 outcome: China \u2248 732 million vs United States \u2248 336 million (Al Jazeera report on IHME study, 15 July 2020).  \n\u2022 U.S. population is therefore still < \u00bd of China\u2019s in 2100.  Because the IHME horizon stops at 2100, no statement about 2200 is possible.  \n\u2022 Modelling choices: fertility is driven by female educational attainment and access to contraception; mortality by IHME\u2019s socio-demographic index and smoking trends; migration by relative economic attractiveness.  IHME assumes TFR\u22481.5 for the U.S. and \u22481.2 for China through most of the 21st century; both stay below replacement, but positive net immigration keeps the U.S. from contracting as quickly as China.\n\nC. Academic projection beyond 2100 \u2013 International Journal of Forecasting (IJF) special issue, 2023 (authors W. Lutz et al.)  \n\u2022 Scope: world and country projections to 2300; explicit country tables, including 2200, exist in the paper\u2019s supplementary material, but are not open-access.  \n\u2022 Published summary (Population Connection blog, 22 Feb 2023) describes the median global path as 11.1 billion (2100) \u2192 10.4 billion (2200) \u2192 7.5 billion (2300); states that \u201cNorthern America peaks in the 22nd century while Asia declines\u201d.  However, without the country appendix we cannot confirm whether the U.S. ever overtakes China.  \n\u2022 Assumptions: the framework extends the standard cohort-component model; fertility is allowed to stay as low as 1.2 or as high as 2.3; life expectancy reaches the high-90s; net migration gradually tapers after mid-century.\n\n3. Comparative results up to 2200  \n\u2022 All three publicly available series agree that China remains more populous than the United States in 2100.  \n  \u2013 UN/WPP-2024 medium: 1.06 bn vs 0.394 bn.  \n  \u2013 IHME-2020: 0.732 bn vs 0.336 bn.  \n\u2022 2100-2200 interval:  \n  \u2013 UN long-range: press synopsis explicitly keeps China ahead to 2300.  \n  \u2013 IJF 2023: country values not yet retrievable; possible, but undocumented, crossover late in the 22nd century.  \n  \u2013 IHME: no forecast beyond 2100.  \n\u2022 Consequently, on the evidence that can actually be cited, no specific year between 1950 and 2200 can be shown in which the U.S. population exceeds China\u2019s.\n\n4. Key demographic drivers highlighted across the models  \n\u2022 Fertility trajectories are decisive.  The UN assumes a gentle rebound toward replacement; IHME and the IJF study allow fertility to stay well below 2.0 for decades.  China\u2019s present TFR (~1.2) is lower than the U.S. (~1.7), so China\u2019s age-structure turns older faster and its population contracts more steeply once births fall below deaths.  \n\u2022 Migration cushions the U.S. decline.  All three models embed positive net immigration for the United States and essentially neutral migration for China.  \n\u2022 Mortality improvements are similar in both countries, rising toward life expectancy in the 90s by 2200 in the UN and IJF work, slightly lower in IHME.  \n\u2022 None of the baseline scenarios incorporates disruptive shocks from climate change, geopolitical conflict or new pandemics; these remain exogenous uncertainties.\n\n5. Remaining information gaps  \n\u2022 UN \u201cWorld Population to 2300\u201d Tables A.15 (China) and A.18 (United States) \u2013 needed for exact numeric totals every five years from 2100 to 2200.  \n\u2022 The full supplementary dataset of the IJF 2023 study \u2013 required to verify whether any percentile shows a U.S.\u2013China crossover.  \n\u2022 Any additional country-level projection beyond 2100 from the Wittgenstein Centre Shared Socio-economic Pathways, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s International Data Base, or other academic groups.  None surfaced in the present search tranche.\n\n6. Bottom-line answer to the original query  \nBased on the open data that can be cited:  \n\u2022 UN long-range projections (medium variant) keep China\u2019s population larger than that of the United States through 2200 and beyond.  \n\u2022 IHME projects only to 2100; within that horizon China remains larger.  \n\u2022 The 2023 academic (IJF) projections point to a faster Asian decline but no publicly available table shows the U.S. overtaking China before 2200.  \nTherefore no documented crossover year can presently be affirmed.  Obtaining the sealed UN and IJF tables is the single most important next step for anyone who must pin down exact 2200 values.</Agent_report>\n"
