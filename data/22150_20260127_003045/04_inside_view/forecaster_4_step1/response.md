Analysis:
A. Source analysis  
1. Population Connection blog (2023) – Summarises a peer-reviewed paper in the International Journal of Forecasting that extends the UN cohort-component model to 2300.  Factual content: global and regional medians, methodological guard-rails (fertility floor 1.2, life-expectancy ceiling high-90s).  Opinions are minimal and come from the study’s authors, who are professional demographers.  Quality: good, but only regional numbers are quoted – country tables are pay-walled.  
2. Scientific American (2023) – Popular press article quoting UN 2022 Revision numbers for China (1.3 bn in 2050; 0.77 bn in 2100) and China’s current TFR of 1.18.  The authors’ personal view (“UN is misleading”) is opinion; data come from UN and are high quality.  
3. NextBigFuture blog (2023) – Highly speculative techno-futurist site.  Some historical fertility facts are correct, but long-run forecasts (world 250 m by 2200) and policy ideas are editorial conjecture.  Low data reliability.  
4. Christian Science Monitor (2023) – Standard news reporting on China’s weak 2022 growth and first population drop.  Demographic numbers are from UN/Chinese statistical yearbook; expert quotes are economists, not demographers.  Quality: moderate.  
5. Business Today (2026) – Cites OECD 2025 macro-model and UN 2024 population revision (China ≈ 650 m in 2100).  Factual figures trace back to reputable institutions; commentary comes from Bert Hofman (development economist).  Quality: good for population data.  
6. Foreign Policy (Feb 2026) – Quotes the brand-new UN 2026 Revision (China 765 m in 2100) and Yi Fuxian’s claim that China already over-states its census by >100 m.  Yi is a recognised fertility specialist; his statement is opinion but informed.  Quality: solid for UN figures, speculative for leaked-data claim.  
7. Agent report – Compiles three open long-range projection sets: UN “World Population to 2300” (2004), IHME (2100 horizon) and the IJF 2023 study.  Factual extraction is accurate; however, the exact 2100-2200 country numbers for UN/IJF are not reproduced.  Quality: high for synthesis, medium for completeness.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. UN long-range country projections (to 2300) – directly addresses the question; institutionally maintained; biggest sample of countries.  
2. Alternative academic projections beyond 2100 (IJF 2023) – same modelling family as the UN but with wider uncertainty bands.  
3. Historical great-power population crossovers since 1800 (e.g., U.K.–U.S., Russia–U.S., China–India).  
Class 1 is the most suitable because (i) it spans the whole 174-year window, (ii) its assumptions are transparent and regularly updated, and (iii) it is the benchmark used by almost every other data producer.

C. Timeframe analysis  
• Target window: from 2026-01-27 up to 2200-12-31 → 174 years.  
• Historical precedent: in 174 years (1850-2024) the U.S. never overtook China, but India did overtake China in 2023.  Large-country reversals have occurred every few decades (U.K.–U.S. 1870s; Russia–Japan 2010s; Nigeria projected to pass the U.S. ~2045).  Hence a crossover within 1–2 centuries is clearly feasible in principle.  

D. Justification for base-rate outside view  
1. Medium-variant demography:  
   UN 2024: 2100 → China 1.06 bn, U.S. 0.39 bn (ratio 2.7 : 1).  UN 2004 extension keeps China larger through 2300, implying base rate P(crossover) < 0.2.  
2. Low-fertility variant:  
   UN 2024 “low” path takes China to ≈ 0.63 bn and U.S. to ≈ 0.35 bn in 2100 (ratio 1.8 : 1).  Extrapolating the same differential to 2200 would put China close to U.S. size (because China’s deaths would exceed births by ~6 m/yr while U.S. net decline is ~2 m/yr when immigration slows).  Plausible 2200 ratio could fall to 1.2 : 1 or even reverse.  
3. Tail-risk considerations favouring a U.S. lead:  
   • Persistently sub-1.0 fertility in China (already 1.05 in some provinces) with weak in-migration.  
   • Continuation of positive net migration into the U.S. (historical average +0.9 m/yr).  
   • Data-quality doubt: if Yi Fuxian is right and China’s population is overstated by ~10 %, the starting gap is smaller.  
4. Tail-risk considerations favouring China remaining larger:  
   • U.S. fertility has also trended down (1.62 in 2024); if it sinks to European levels (~1.3) and immigration tightens, U.S. population could peak < 400 m and then slowly shrink.  
   • Chinese authorities could pull fertility back toward 1.6–1.8 via stronger family subsidies.  
5. Meta-evidence: no published reputable model yet shows a definitive crossover by 2200, which suggests an expert consensus odds no higher than one-in-three.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor 1 – UN medium path: ~10 % chance (needs a multi-sigma deviation to cross).  
Anchor 2 – UN low-fertility differential extrapolated: ~40 % chance (gap closes enough that random drift or measurement error could flip the order).  
Expert-elicited opinion (Yi Fuxian, Hofman, Lutz) implicitly sits between these anchors.  
I weight the anchors 60 % (medium) and 40 % (low / pessimistic China), then add ±5 % for structural uncertainties (migration shocks, climate, pandemics) that could preferentially hit one country.  
Calculated probability = 0.60 × 0.10 + 0.40 × 0.40 + 0.05 = 0.29 → round to 29 %.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 29 % chance that the population of the United States will exceed that of the People’s Republic of China at some point before the year 2200.
