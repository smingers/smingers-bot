Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. UN World Population Prospects 2024 & 2026 Revisions (medium & low-fertility variants, plus the still-official 2004 extension to 2300) – primary demographic dataset; transparent cohort–component model; last update mid-2025. Data = strong, opinions = none.  
2. International Journal of Forecasting 2023 long-range study (to 2300) – peer-reviewed, extends UN model, imposes 1.2 TFR floor & immigration caps; good methodology, single study.  
3. Scientific American 2023 article – quotes UN numbers, confirms China’s TFR ≈1.1 ; authors’ critique is opinion. Data quality high, opinions moderate.  
4. OurWorldInData 2025 digest – visualises UN 2022 dataset; limited to 2100. Data reliable, scope narrow.  
5. Foreign Policy Feb 2026 – cites brand-new UN 2026 revision and fertility-specialist Yi Fuxian’s claim China over-counts by 7–10 %. Data strong, Yi’s allegation = moderate evidence.  
6. Statista 2025 snapshot – descriptive only to 2025; weak for long-range use.  

b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• China’s sustained sub-replacement fertility (1.05–1.2) confirmed by multiple independent statistical releases.  
• China’s net migration ≈0 or negative; U.S. net migration +0.7 – 1.0 m/yr for six decades; structural, policy-resilient.  
Moderate:  
• UN low-fertility variant shows China 630 m vs U.S. 350 m in 2100, gap already <2:1.  
• Yi Fuxian over-count claim would shrink the current gap by ~100 m.  
• Pronatalist programmes to date have raised fertility only marginally in peer countries (e.g., Korea, Singapore).  
Weak:  
• Speculation that China could attract large-scale immigration after 2050.  
• Technological life-extension breakthroughs differentially benefiting China.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Window to resolution: 174 years (2026-01-27 → 2199-12-31).  
Halving horizon to 87 years (to 2113) makes crossover very unlikely (<10 %) because even aggressive decline leaves China >500 m then. Doubling is impossible (beyond 2200). Probability therefore rises gradually with time; biggest uncertainty is 2100-2150 band.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (outside view) = 29 %.  
Updates:  
+4 %  Observed Chinese fertility has fallen below the UN medium-assumption rebound and shows no sign of recovery.  
+3 %  Continuous positive U.S. immigration is politically contentious yet has proven persistent since 1965; demographic pull likely continues while China lacks such inflow.  
+1 %  Possible current over-count in China narrows starting gap.  
-2 %  UN medium, IJF 2023 and every published 2300 projection still keep China larger; expert consensus remains “no crossover”.  
Net adjustment +6 % → 35 %.

Probability calibration
Final judged probability that the U.S. population will exceed China’s at least once before 2200: 35 %.  
I interpret this as: in 100 parallel worlds starting today, about 35 see a U.S. > China population crossover by 2199-12-31.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between now and 2200, will U.S. population ever surpass China’s?”  
2. Outside view base rate: 29 %.  
3. Consistency: “35 times out of 100, the crossover occurs” – matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) China TFR ≈1.1; b) U.S. net migration +0.8 m/yr; c) UN low-variant gap <2:1 by 2100; d) No model yet shows crossover (down-weight).  
5. Blind-spot: Major U.S. immigration collapse (climate, politics) while China opens borders; would cut probability by ~15 pts.  
6. Status-quo bias: China currently larger; slow change argues for mild pull back toward lower probability – reflected in keeping forecast at only 35 %.

Probability: 35%
