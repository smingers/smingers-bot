Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. UN World Population Prospects 2024 (primary tables, accessed Jan 2026) – peer-reviewed, cohort-component model, last census round incorporated; high quality, factual.  
2. UN long-range (to 2300) working paper (2004) – same methodology, but older baseline; still best publicly available >2100 projection; high quality, factual, but dated.  
3. Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation (IHME) 2020 forecasts – uses education & income covariates; peer-reviewed (Lancet), good transparency; high quality.  
4. Scientific American Feb 2023 article – quotes UN 2022 numbers accurately; authors’ critique is opinion; the numbers are factual, quality high.  
5. Our World in Data Sept 2025 post – reproduces UN 2024 graphics; reliable secondary source.  
6. Yi Fuxian (Demographer, Univ. of Wisconsin) interview, Foreign Policy Feb 2026 – expert opinion; claims China’s 2026 population is ~120 m below official figure; moderate quality (credible specialist, but minority view).  
7. U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base 2023 – official, transparent; high quality, factual.  
8. OECD “Long-term demographic outlook 2025–2150” (Nov 2025) – methodology public, but stops at 2150; high quality, factual.  
9. Guardian & Japan Times economy pieces (2025) – provide context on China’s growth; demographic statements consistent with UN; supplementary, moderate quality.  
All other web material either repeated the above numbers or offered anecdotal comments and was therefore ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength refers to impact on US>CN crossover before 2200)

Strong evidence  
• China’s total fertility rate (TFR) 1.0-1.2 for eight consecutive years (UN, NBS).  
• U.S. TFR 1.65 and net immigration +0.3 % p.a. for last decade (Census); structural policy openness.  
• Cohort-component mathematics: with China’s fertility well below replacement and near-zero net migration, large age-cohort attrition is baked in for 75+ years.  

Moderate evidence  
• Pronatalist measures in China (three-child policy, subsidies) so far show minimal effect (NBS 2025 births −5 % y/y).  
• IHME and OECD alternative models put a median US>CN crossover around 2165–2180.  
• Expert dispute over China’s current population size (Yi Fuxian down-revises base by ~8 %).  
• U.S. political debate could curtail immigration; 2025 bill would cut visas 30 % but has uncertain passage.

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that AI/robotic childcare or major cultural shift could raise China’s TFR to ≥1.8.  
• Catastrophic events (war, climate) that hit one country asymmetrically – real but directionally undefined.  

Weighting result: strong evidence pushes probability upward relative to UN baseline; moderate evidence gives additional 5-10 pp; weak evidence leaves small downward tug.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon from today (2026-01-27) to 2199-12-31 ≈ 63,600 days.  
If the horizon were halved to 2087 the chance of crossover would drop to ~5 %. If doubled (to 2300) it would rise to ~50 %. The event is therefore heavily driven by very-long-run fertility and migration differentials.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (derived from UN long-range ensemble) = 30 %.  
Inside factors shifting upward:  
+7 pp Continuing sub-replacement China TFR with no sign of rebound.  
+3 pp Persistent US net immigration advantage.  
+2 pp Possible downward revision of China’s current population stock.  
Downward adjustments:  
−2 pp risk of major US immigration clampdown or fertility slide to ~1.3.  
Net change: +10 pp.  
New probability ≈ 40 %. Current information does not overturn the reference class but makes the tails where a crossover occurs materially thicker.

Probability calibration

Subjective probability that U.S. population exceeds China’s at least once between 2026-01-27 and 2199-12-31: 40 %.  
80 % confidence interval for that probability estimate: 25 %-55 %.  
Interpretation: in 40 out of 100 futures similar to today, the crossover happens.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will US population ever surpass China’s before 1 Jan 2200?”  
2. Base rate stated: 30 %.  
3. Consistency line – “In 40 of 100 universes, US pop exceeds China before 2200.”  
4. Key evidence (i) China’s TFR ≈1.1, (ii) US TFR+immigration keeps slow growth, (iii) median models cross ~2165, (iv) Yi Fuxian possible 120 m over-count.  
5. Blind-spot – China successfully raises fertility to replacement by 2050 and reopens to immigration, preventing long-run decline. Would cut probability to <15 %.  
6. Status-quo – Most professional projections still show China larger through 2150; slight bias toward “no crossover” resisted but noted.

Probability: 40%
