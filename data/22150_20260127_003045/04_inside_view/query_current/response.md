Analysis:
Since China’s population peaked in 2022 and is now falling, whereas the United States is still growing slowly, several recent demographic projections (UN World Population Prospects 2022-23 updates, Lancet IHME 2020 revision, Wittgenstein Centre, and various national statistical offices) show the two countries’ curves converging during the 21st century. Key items to look for:
• Updated 2024–2025 Chinese National Bureau of Statistics releases confirming the rapid fertility decline and accelerating deaths.
• U.S. Census Bureau or UN updates that revise U.S. net immigration upward, sustaining growth.
• Long-range projections (to 2100 and beyond) from UN and IHME that illustrate the point at which U.S. population may surpass China (many place the crossover between 2060-2090, though uncertainty is high).
Recent news coverage on China’s shrinking population (e.g., “China loses 2 million people in 2024”) and commentary on U.S. demographic resilience will also illuminate expert sentiment and any newly revised forecasts. Gathering these sources will give the inside view necessary to judge whether a U.S. population lead is plausible before 2200.
