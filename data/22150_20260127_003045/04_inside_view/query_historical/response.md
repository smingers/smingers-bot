Analysis:
To judge whether the U.S. population will ever exceed China’s before 2200 we need (a) historical census figures to understand the long-run trend, and (b) reputable very-long-range projections (UN, IHME, academic demographers) that extend far enough to show any potential crossover dates. Key pieces of context therefore include: when China’s population is expected to peak and how fast it might decline, U.S. fertility and immigration assumptions, and whether any published projections already show a U.S. > China crossover in the 21st or 22nd century.
