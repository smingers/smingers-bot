# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The available data sources for this question include historical records of the founding and growth of AI labs over time. However, the historical record may be incomplete or biased, as the field of AI is relatively new and rapidly evolving. There could be systematic biases in the data, such as a focus on well-known or high-profile AI labs, while smaller or less prominent labs may be underrepresented.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Startup Founding and Growth**
- Historical distribution: The majority of startups fail within the first few years, with only a small percentage becoming successful and leading companies within 2 years of founding.
- Sample size: Thousands of startups founded each year.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: AI labs are essentially technology startups, and the dynamics of startup founding and growth may provide a useful reference point.

**Reference Class 2: Academic Research and Innovation**
- Historical distribution: In academic research and innovation, it is relatively rare for a new lab or research group to become a leading force within 2 years of its founding. Typically, it takes several years for a new lab to establish itself and make significant contributions.
- Sample size: Hundreds of new research labs and groups founded each year.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: AI labs are often closely tied to academic research and innovation, and the timelines for new labs to become leading forces may be more similar to this reference class.

## Step 3: Per-Option Analysis

**Option 1:** 0-5 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require that the majority of new AI labs struggle to gain traction and become leading forces within a short timeframe, similar to the startup failure rate.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is the most likely outcome, as it aligns with the typical timelines for startups and academic research groups to become leading forces.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 60-80%.

**Option 2:** 6-10 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require a higher success rate for new AI labs, with a significant portion of them becoming leading forces within a short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is less likely, as it would be a faster timeline than what is typically observed for startups and academic research groups.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 20-30%.

**Option 3:** 11-15 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require an exceptionally high success rate for new AI labs, with a large portion of them becoming leading forces within a very short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is unlikely, as it would be an extremely rapid timeline for new labs to become leading forces.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 5-10%.

**Option 4:** 16 or more new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require an extremely high success rate for new AI labs, with a majority of them becoming leading forces within a very short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is highly unlikely, as it would be an unprecedented level of rapid success for new labs.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely less than 5%.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Option 1 (0-5 new leading AI labs): 70%
Option 2 (6-10 new leading AI labs): 25%
Option 3 (11-15 new leading AI labs): 5%
Option 4 (16 or more new leading AI labs): 0%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 1 (0-5 new leading AI labs, 70%)

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence Level: 7

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The completeness and potential biases in the historical data on AI lab founding and growth
- The extent to which the reference classes of startups and academic research groups accurately reflect the dynamics of the AI lab ecosystem
- The potential for disruptive breakthroughs or rapid advancements in the field of AI that could lead to a faster-than-expected growth of new leading AI labs
