# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The available data sources for this question include historical records of the founding and growth of AI labs over time. However, the historical record may be incomplete or biased, as the field of AI is relatively new and rapidly evolving. There could be systematic biases in the data, such as a focus on well-known or high-profile AI labs, while smaller or less prominent labs may be underrepresented.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Startup Founding and Growth**
- Historical distribution: The majority of startups fail within the first few years, with only a small percentage becoming successful and leading companies within 2 years of founding.
- Sample size: Thousands of startups founded each year.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: AI labs are essentially technology startups, and the dynamics of startup founding and growth may provide a useful reference point.

**Reference Class 2: Academic Research and Innovation**
- Historical distribution: In academic research and innovation, it is relatively rare for a new lab or research group to become a leading force within 2 years of its founding. Typically, it takes several years for a new lab to establish itself and make significant contributions.
- Sample size: Hundreds of new research labs and groups founded each year.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: AI labs are often closely tied to academic research and innovation, and the timelines for new labs to become leading forces may be more similar to this reference class.

## Step 3: Per-Option Analysis

**Option 1:** 0-5 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require that the majority of new AI labs struggle to gain traction and become leading forces within a short timeframe, similar to the startup failure rate.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is the most likely outcome, as it aligns with the typical timelines for startups and academic research groups to become leading forces.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 60-80%.

**Option 2:** 6-10 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require a higher success rate for new AI labs, with a significant portion of them becoming leading forces within a short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is less likely, as it would be a faster timeline than what is typically observed for startups and academic research groups.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 20-30%.

**Option 3:** 11-15 new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require an exceptionally high success rate for new AI labs, with a large portion of them becoming leading forces within a very short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is unlikely, as it would be an extremely rapid timeline for new labs to become leading forces.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely in the range of 5-10%.

**Option 4:** 16 or more new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding.
- What would have to be true: This option would require an extremely high success rate for new AI labs, with a majority of them becoming leading forces within a very short timeframe.
- Historical precedent: The reference classes suggest that this is highly unlikely, as it would be an unprecedented level of rapid success for new labs.
- Base rate: Based on the reference classes, the base rate for this outcome is likely less than 5%.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores, the integrated base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Option 1 (0-5 new leading AI labs): 70%
Option 2 (6-10 new leading AI labs): 25%
Option 3 (11-15 new leading AI labs): 5%
Option 4 (16 or more new leading AI labs): 0%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 1 (0-5 new leading AI labs, 70%)

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence Level: 7

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The completeness and potential biases in the historical data on AI lab founding and growth
- The extent to which the reference classes of startups and academic research groups accurately reflect the dynamics of the AI lab ecosystem
- The potential for disruptive breakthroughs or rapid advancements in the field of AI that could lead to a faster-than-expected growth of new leading AI labs

Option 3: 35%
Option 4: 10%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 2, Option 3 (35% each)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

**Reasoning:**

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I will focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments to weigh the evidence and update the base distribution.

**Strong Evidence Favoring Option 2 and Option 3:**
- The research indicates a significant boom in AI startups and funding, with over 55 US-based AI startups raising $100M or more in 2025 alone (Strong Evidence). This suggests a rapidly growing AI ecosystem, which would favor options that predict more new AI labs leading within 2 years of founding.
- Several reports highlight the emergence of new AI powerhouses, like Humans& which raised a $480M seed round at a $4.48B valuation (Strong Evidence). This points to the potential for more new AI labs to quickly become leading players.
- Industry experts are predicting accelerating AI adoption and growth, with AI-driven productivity gains of up to 25% over the next decade (Moderate Evidence). This creates a favorable environment for new AI labs to thrive.

**Strong Evidence Against Option 1:**
- The research indicates that most of the new AI billionaires and leading AI companies were founded less than 3 years ago (Strong Evidence). This suggests the landscape is rapidly changing, making it less likely that only a small number of new labs will lead within 2 years.
- Industry reports highlight the emergence of new AI hubs and ecosystems beyond the traditional tech centers, like the growth of European AI companies like Mistral (Strong Evidence). This diversification makes it less likely that the majority of new leading labs will be concentrated in a small number of options.

**Moderate Evidence Favoring Option 2 and Option 3:**
- The AI Index Report shows AI business usage accelerating, with 78% of organizations reporting AI usage in 2024, up from 55% the year prior (Moderate Evidence). This growing adoption creates more opportunities for new AI labs to emerge and thrive.
- Forecasts predict the global AI market will grow from $391 billion in 2025 to $1.81 trillion by 2030 (Moderate Evidence). This rapid expansion suggests the potential for more new AI labs to become leading players within a short timeframe.

After carefully weighing the evidence, I believe the probabilities should be adjusted as follows:

- Option 1 (25% to 20%): The research indicates the landscape is rapidly changing, making it less likely that only a small number of new labs will lead within 2 years.
- Option 2 (25% to 35%) and Option 3 (25% to 35%): The strong evidence of a booming AI startup ecosystem, the emergence of new AI powerhouses, and the accelerating AI adoption create favorable conditions for more new AI labs to become leading players within 2 years of founding.
- Option 4 (25% to 10%): The research suggests the landscape is diversifying, making it less likely that a large proportion of new leading labs will be concentrated in a small number of options.

I'm confident in this adjustment (8/10) as the evidence strongly points to a more dynamic and rapidly evolving AI landscape, where a larger number of new labs are likely to become leading players within a short timeframe.

### historian (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
**Prediction:** 35.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: Option 1, Option 2
- Strong evidence against: Option 3, Option 4
- Net direction: Option 1 and Option 2 gained probability

**Distribution:**
Option 1: 35%
Option 2: 35% 
Option 3: 15%
Option 4: 15%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 1 or Option 2 (35% each)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

As a historian and superforecaster, I focused on analyzing the current evidence through the lens of historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past. The research synthesis provided several strong signals that point to a higher likelihood of new AI labs becoming leading labs within 2 years of their founding.

**Strong Evidence Favoring Option 1 and Option 2:**
- The rapid growth and funding of AI startups, with multiple companies raising large rounds and achieving high valuations within a short timeframe, suggests an accelerated path to becoming leading labs. This is supported by historical precedents of technology sectors experiencing exponential growth and rapid scaling.
- Reports indicate that generative AI usage has grown significantly, outpacing previous adoption rates. This indicates a strong demand and market opportunity for new AI labs, increasing their chances of becoming leading labs.
- Industry analysis and forecasts point to a substantial increase in AI-driven labor productivity growth and overall market expansion over the next decade. This macroeconomic tailwind would benefit new AI labs and increase their chances of success.

**Moderate Evidence Against Option 3 and Option 4:**
- While the research highlights the general growth and success of the AI industry, there is less specific evidence on the likelihood of new labs becoming leading labs within 2 years. This makes it harder to confidently assess the probabilities for Option 3 and Option 4.
- Some sources mention the dominance of established players like OpenAI and Google in the AI landscape, which could make it more challenging for newer labs to quickly become leading labs.

Given the strong historical evidence and current industry trends favoring the rapid growth and success of new AI labs, I believe Option 1 and Option 2 are the most likely outcomes, with each having a 35% probability. The remaining 30% is split between Option 3 and Option 4, as the evidence is less conclusive for these less favorable outcomes.

My confidence in this adjusted distribution is high (8/10) based on the strength of the historical precedents and the clear directional signals from the research synthesis.

### contrarian (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
**Prediction:** 35.0%
**Weight:** 0.8

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: Option 3, Option 4
- Strong evidence against: Option 1, Option 2
- Net direction: Option 3 and Option 4 gained probability

**Distribution:**
Option 1: 15%
Option 2: 15% 
Option 3: 35%
Option 4: 35%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 3 and Option 4 (35% each)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. After reviewing the current evidence, I believe the base distribution does not fully account for some important factors that could significantly impact the number of new AI labs leading within 2 years of their founding.

**STRONG EVIDENCE FAVORING OPTION 3 AND OPTION 4:**
The research synthesis indicates that the AI industry is experiencing rapid growth, with a proliferation of new startups and massive funding rounds. This suggests that the barrier to entry for launching successful AI labs may be lower than previously thought. Additionally, the data shows that many of the most prominent AI companies were founded within the last 3 years, implying a faster path to leadership. This supports the idea that more new labs could achieve leading status within 2 years.

Furthermore, the reports on AI adoption and growth trends point to an accelerating pace of innovation and breakthroughs in the field. This could enable new entrants to catch up to incumbents more quickly, increasing the likelihood of more "fast-rising" AI labs.

**STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST OPTION 1 AND OPTION 2:**
The base distribution seems to assume a more gradual, linear growth in new leading AI labs. However, the evidence suggests a potential for exponential or disruptive growth, where new players can rapidly gain prominence. The reports on the "AI boom" and the rise of new billionaires in the field indicate that the landscape may be shifting in ways not captured by the base rate.

Additionally, the data on lab automation and the increasing use of generative AI tools point to a technological environment that could accelerate the development and scaling of new AI capabilities. This could give an edge to newer, more agile labs over established players.

**ADJUSTMENTS:**
Given the strong evidence favoring a faster pace of new AI lab growth and leadership, I believe the base distribution significantly underestimates the probability of Option 3 and Option 4. Accordingly, I have increased the probabilities for these options to 35% each, while reducing the probabilities for Option 1 and Option 2 to 15% each.

This adjustment reflects my view that the current evidence suggests a more disruptive and accelerated trajectory for the AI lab landscape, with a greater likelihood of new entrants rapidly achieving leading status. The base rate does not fully capture the potential for a more dynamic and rapidly evolving ecosystem.

I have high confidence in this adjustment, as the evidence seems to point to a clear shift in the underlying dynamics of the AI industry. However, I acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in forecasting such a rapidly evolving field, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely for any new developments that could further refine my assessment.
