# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation - Multiple Choice Question

## Question
Before 2030, how many new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding?

## Description
This question is asking about the number of new AI labs that will become leading labs within 2 years of their founding, before the year 2030.

## Resolution Criteria
The options provided represent different ranges for the number of new leading AI labs within 2 years of founding, before 2030.

## Options
- Option 1: 0-5 new leading AI labs
- Option 2: 6-10 new leading AI labs 
- Option 3: 11-15 new leading AI labs
- Option 4: 16 or more new leading AI labs

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The available data sources for this type of question include:
- Historical records of new AI lab foundings and their subsequent growth trajectories
- Industry reports and analyses on the AI research landscape
- Academic studies on the dynamics of new technology company formation and growth

The historical record is likely incomplete, as not all new AI labs may be well documented, especially smaller or more recent ones. There could also be systematic biases in the data, as successful labs may be over-represented compared to those that failed to gain prominence.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: New technology company formation and growth**
- Historical distribution: Studies have shown that the distribution of new technology company growth follows a power law, with a small number of "superstar" companies growing rapidly, and the majority growing more slowly or failing.
- Sample size: Hundreds of examples of new technology company formation and growth trajectories.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: The formation and growth of new AI labs is likely to follow similar dynamics as other new technology companies.

**Reference Class 2: Emergence of new scientific/technological fields**
- Historical distribution: The emergence of new scientific or technological fields often follows an S-curve pattern, with a slow initial growth, followed by rapid expansion, and then a leveling off.
- Sample size: Dozens of examples of new field emergence in science and technology.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: The growth of new AI labs could be analogous to the emergence of a new scientific or technological field.

### Step 3: Per-Option Analysis

**Option 1: 0-5 new leading AI labs**
- What would have to be true: The AI field would need to be relatively mature, with few opportunities for new entrants to rapidly gain prominence.
- Historical precedent: This would be on the lower end of what is typically observed for the emergence of new scientific/technological fields and the formation of new technology companies.
- Base rate: Approximately 10-20% based on the reference class analyses.

**Option 2: 6-10 new leading AI labs**
- What would have to be true: The AI field would need to be experiencing moderate growth, with some opportunities for new entrants to gain prominence.
- Historical precedent: This would be in the middle range of what is typically observed for the emergence of new scientific/technological fields and the formation of new technology companies.
- Base rate: Approximately 30-40% based on the reference class analyses.

**Option 3: 11-15 new leading AI labs**
- What would have to be true: The AI field would need to be experiencing rapid growth, with significant opportunities for new entrants to gain prominence.
- Historical precedent: This would be on the higher end of what is typically observed for the emergence of new scientific/technological fields and the formation of new technology companies.
- Base rate: Approximately 20-30% based on the reference class analyses.

**Option 4: 16 or more new leading AI labs**
- What would have to be true: The AI field would need to be experiencing extremely rapid growth, with a large number of new entrants able to gain prominence.
- Historical precedent: This would be at the upper end of what is typically observed for the emergence of new scientific/technological fields and the formation of new technology companies.
- Base rate: Approximately 10-20% based on the reference class analyses.

### Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores, the integrated base distribution is:

**Distribution:**
Option 1 (0-5 new leading AI labs): 15%
Option 2 (6-10 new leading AI labs): 35%
Option 3 (11-15 new leading AI labs): 25%
Option 4 (16 or more new leading AI labs): 15%

**Most Likely Outcome:** Option 2 (6-10 new leading AI labs, 35%)

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence Level: 7

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The completeness and accuracy of the historical data on new AI lab formations and growth trajectories
- The extent to which the dynamics of new AI lab formation and growth will follow the patterns observed in other technology sectors
- The potential for disruptive changes or breakthroughs in the AI field that could significantly alter the growth trajectory of new AI labs
