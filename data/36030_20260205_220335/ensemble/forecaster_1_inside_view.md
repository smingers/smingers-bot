- Semiconductor industry as primary driver
- Global tech investment cycles
- Potential AI infrastructure boom

Inside View Adjustments:
- Slightly bullish due to AI and semiconductor momentum
- Accounting for potential market volatility
- Recognizing Taiwan's robust economic infrastructure

Risk Factors Pushing Distribution:
- Upside: AI investment, tech sector growth
- Downside: Geopolitical tensions, global economic uncertainty

Forecast Distribution Rationale:
- Lower percentiles reflect potential geopolitical/economic disruptions
- Higher percentiles capture tech sector growth potential
- Wide interval acknowledges significant uncertainty

Final Probabilistic Forecast:

Percentile 10: 26,500
Percentile 20: 29,000
Percentile 40: 32,000
