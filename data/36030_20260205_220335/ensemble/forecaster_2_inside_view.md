I'll conduct a comprehensive analysis following the specified framework:

1. Target Variable Paraphrase:
Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index (TAIEX) value at market close on December 31, 2026

2. Outside View Base Rate:
- Historical TAIEX annual growth: 15-25%
- 2025 year-end value: ~29,000
- Typical reference range without extraordinary circumstances: 33,000 - 36,000

3. Source Analysis:
Strong Sources:
- TWSE Market Insights (2025 Review): High reliability, primary source
- Trading Economics: Credible financial data platform
- Premia Partners Market Outlook: Professional investment analysis

Moderate Sources:
- Yahoo Finance: Technology industry insights
- Seeking Alpha: Individual stock analysis
- Morningstar: Equity research

4. Evidence Weighing:

Strong Evidence:
- AI-driven semiconductor expansion
- TSMC's projected 30% revenue growth in 2026
- Foreign investor confidence (47.4% market participation)

Moderate Evidence:
- Taiwan's projected 3.5% economic growth
- ETF market expansion
- Geopolitical stability indicators

Weak Evidence:
- Individual stock performance
- Short-term market fluctuations

5. Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 11 months
- If halved (5.5 months): Less time for structural changes, more short-term sentiment driven
- If doubled (22 months): More uncertainty, greater potential for disruptive events

6. Justification Factors:
1. Global AI infrastructure investment
2. Semiconductor supply chain dynamics
3. Geopolitical risk management
4. Foreign investment trends
5. Technological innovation cycles

7. Forecasting Checklist:

Consistency Check:
- Implied median: ~33,500
- Mean: Similar range
- Alignment: Consistent with growth expectations and market dynamics

Top Evidence:
a) TSMC's 30% projected revenue growth
b) AI infrastructure expansion
c) Strong foreign investment participation
d) Semiconductor industry resilience

Blind Spot Statement:
Most likely scenario to invalidate forecast: Sudden China-Taiwan geopolitical escalation, potentially causing significant market correction

8. Probability Distribution Rationale:
- Asymmetric distribution favoring moderate growth
- Wide confidence intervals to account for uncertainty
- Reflecting semiconductor industry's potential and geopolitical risks

Final Prediction:

Percentile 10: 25,000
Percentile 20: 28,500
Percentile 40: 32,000
Percentile 60: 35,000
Percentile 80: 38,500
Percentile 90: 42,000

Rationale: The distribution captures potential outcomes ranging from modest growth to robust expansion, with a central expectation around 33,000-35,000, reflecting Taiwan's strong technological ecosystem and global market positioning.
