(d) Justification:
Key Factors Influencing Prediction:
- Strong semiconductor industry performance
- AI and tech sector growth
- Geopolitical stability (no major conflict)
- Global tech investment trends

Outside View Calibration:

Considerations:
- High uncertainty due to geopolitical risks
- Potential for unexpected global events
- Strong underlying economic fundamentals
- Semiconductor industry as primary driver

Risk Factors:
- Potential China-Taiwan conflict (low probability, high impact)
- Global economic slowdown

Calibration Strategy:
- Wide confidence intervals
- Asymmetric distribution favoring growth
- Account for potential geopolitical disruptions

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 25000
Percentile 20: 28000
Percentile 40: 32000
Percentile 60: 36000
Percentile 80: 40000
Percentile 90: 43000

Rationale for Distribution:
- Base prediction centered around current trajectory
- Wider lower-end interval to account for potential geopolitical risks
- Upper percentiles reflect optimistic tech and semiconductor growth scenarios
- Asymmetric distribution reflects underlying economic momentum

The prediction suggests continued growth with significant uncertainty, reflecting the complex interplay of technological innovation, geopolitical risks, and global economic trends.
