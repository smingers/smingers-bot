I'll provide a comprehensive analysis following the structured approach you outlined:

Forecasting Checklist:

1. Target Variable Paraphrase:
Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index (TAIEX) value at market close on December 31, 2026

2. Outside View Base Rate:
Historical average annual growth: 8-12%
Current index value (Feb 5, 2026): 31,801
Base rate projection: 34,345 - 35,618

3. Consistency Check:
Implied median ≈ 33,500; mean ≈ 33,750
This appears reasonably aligned with market momentum and expert projections

4. Most Significant Evidence:
a) AI-driven semiconductor expansion (Strong evidence)
b) TSMC's projected 30% revenue growth in 2026 (Strong evidence)
c) Geopolitical risk premium (Moderate evidence)
d) Global tech investment trends (Moderate evidence)

5. Blind-Spot Statement:
Potential China-Taiwan military conflict could dramatically crash the index, pushing it potentially 30-50% lower
