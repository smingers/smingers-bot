Forecasting Question:
What will be the value of the Taiwan Stock Index (TAIEX) at the end of 2026?

Question background:
The [Taiwan Stock Exchange](https://www.twse.com.tw/en/) (TWSE) is the primary stock exchange in Taiwan. At the end of 2023 TWSE had [approximately 1000 listings](https://www.twse.com.tw/downloads/zh/about/company/factbook/2024/1.01.html) with an aggregate market capitalization of [over 2x the country's GDP](https://www.twse.com.tw/downloads/zh/about/company/factbook/2024/1.02.html). The largest listed company is Taiwan Semiconductor, [with almost 10x the market capitalization of the next largest, which is Mediatek](https://www.twse.com.tw/downloads/zh/about/company/factbook/2024/1.04.html). While [the exchange is dominated by electronics designers and manufacturers](https://www.twse.com.tw/downloads/zh/about/company/factbook/2024/1.03.html), prominent exceptions include [Formosa Petrochemical](https://www.fpcc.com.tw/en) and [Cathay Financial Holdings](https://www.cathayholdings.com/en/holdings/intro/intro/about).

The most widely reported index for stocks on TWSE is the "Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index" or TAIEX. At the end of 2024 its value was approximately 23000.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-05. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-05 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 0.0 and the upper bound is 50000.0.
The lower bound is CLOSED (outcome cannot be below 0.0), but the upper bound is OPEN (outcome can exceed 50000.0). Your upper percentiles may extend beyond the upper bound if evidence supports it.

Note that this is a numeric question, with expected answer format as a discrete CDF (not required for this answer).

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic indicators, financial data, interest rates, employment, GDP, inflation, trade statistics, or any quantitative economic metric, use FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to retrieve official historical data. Your query should describe the economic indicator (e.g., "US unemployment rate" or "consumer price index") or use a known FRED series ID directly (e.g., "UNRATE" or "CPIAUCSL"). This returns historical data with computed statistics for establishing base rates.

For yFinance:
If the question involves stock prices, ETF values, corporate earnings, market capitalization, company fundamentals, or options-implied expectations for publicly traded securities, use yFinance to retrieve market data. Your query should be a ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" or "SPY") optionally followed by a brief description of what data you need (e.g., "AAPL price history and fundamentals" or "TSLA options data"). This returns historical prices, key financial metrics, and options-implied probability distributions.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a FRED query if the question involves economic/financial data. Add a yFinance query if the question involves stocks, ETFs, or publicly traded securities.
