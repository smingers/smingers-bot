The Taiwan Weighted Index dropped 488 points to close at 31,801, while the TXF fell 509 points to 31,907, with a positive basis of 105.73 points. The market showed a 'top pressure, bottom support' structure, with short-term volatility expected to persist until the index regains its short-term moving averages. The futures market saw major institutional investors sell short 90.38 billion NT dollars. In terms of net positions, major institutions increased their net long positions by 1,373 contracts to 1,818, with foreign investors increasing their net short positions by 1,044 contracts to 26,743. The top ten traders\u2019 net long positions rose by 1,212 contracts to 33. In options, the highest open interest (OI) for February F1 call options was at 33,000 points, and for put options at 29,000 points; monthly call OI peaked at 34,000 points, while monthly put OI peaked at 29,000 points. The put/call ratio declined from 1.78 to 1.29, and the VIX index rose 1.39 points to 28.84. Foreign investors\u2019 net call option exposure was 195 million NT dollars, and net put exposure was 54 million NT dollars, indicating a bearish bias in the options market. Analysts from Yuantai and Yung-feng Futures noted that the TXF broke below the 32,000 psychological level, and with the year-end settlement approaching, buying interest has turned cautious. Short-term, the index may retest the monthly moving average support. Future movements will depend on the progress of the U.S. earnings season and policy changes affecting investor sentiment. If volume does not sustain, upward potential will remain constrained. The key point is that the index did not break below the monthly moving average during or after the session, suggesting the medium-term trend remains intact, and the current correction is likely a high-end adjustment rather than a trend reversal. Externally, the recent U.S. market decline stems from revised expectations of delayed rate cuts, profit-taking in overvalued tech stocks, and reduced short-term risk appetite. As long as the U.S. market avoids panic selling or critical moving average breakdowns, Taiwan\u2019s market is unlikely to experience a standalone crash, and a sustained recovery will likely wait for the U.S. market to stabilize first.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:24 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/11113/9311841)\n\n**Taiwan\u2019s Stock Market Continues Bullish Momentum, Futures Surge Past 32,600 Points Amid Global Market Volatility**\nOn February 4, 2026, the Taiwan Futures Index (TAIFEX) night session opened at 32,477 points, up 61 points, driven by gains in the U.S. Dow Jones electronic session. The index briefly surged past the 32,600-point mark, reaching 32,612 points\u2014an increase of 196 points\u2014before retreating to 32,428 points due to short-term profit-taking, ending near 32,500 points, up approximately 84 points by 9:30 p.m. The rally was supported by strong earnings from AMD, which reported revenue of $1.53 per share and $980 million in Q1 revenue guidance, exceeding expectations but falling short of the $1 billion optimistic forecast. Despite AMD's stock dropping over 9% post-earnings and negative sentiment from gold rising above $5,000 and silver surging over 7.5%, along with a weaker-than-expected non-farm payroll increase of 22,000 jobs, the Taiwan stock market\u2019s bullish momentum remained intact. The TSMC futures traded around 1,795 yuan, up 5 yuan, while electronic futures rose 0.14% and semiconductor futures gained about 0.24%. The Taiwan Composite Index closed up 94 points at 32,289 points, with foreign investors buying 12.06 billion NTD in spot shares, reducing net short positions in the index futures to 25,699 contracts. Investment trusts bought 5.38 billion NTD, while dealers sold 1.67 billion NTD, resulting in a net purchase of 15.77 billion NTD by major institutions. Market experts noted that while the index rose above all moving averages, trading volume contracted near the market close, suggesting a period of consolidation to digest prior volume above 900 billion NTD; a renewed push toward historical highs is expected only when volume rebounds and moving averages re-establish a bullish alignment.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:33 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/11112/9309484)\n\n**Taiwan Stock Market Ends Slightly Higher: Index Gains 94.45 Points to Close at 32,289.81, TSMC Drops 0.83% Amid Semiconductor Sector Pullback**\nOn February 4, 2026, Taiwan's stock market ended with a slight gain, as the weighted index rose 94.45 points to close at 32,289.81 points, a 0.29% increase.

The rally was driven by short-covering and aggressive rebound buying, particularly in technology, financial, and major blue-chip stocks. Despite self-trading firms selling a net 68.91 billion NT dollars for the fifth consecutive day, foreign investors turned from net sellers to net buyers, purchasing 72.67 billion NT dollars, while investment trusts bought 106.17 billion NT dollars, resulting in a total net buying of 109.93 billion NT dollars by the three major institutional investors. Life insurance companies also bought 3.1 billion NT dollars worth of key stocks, including TSMC (2330), MediaTek (2454), Foxconn (2317), and Delta Electronics (2308). The top ten blue-chip stocks rose across the board except for Nan Ya Plastics (2408). MediaTek surged nearly half a limit up, and TSMC rose 35 NT dollars to close at 1,800 NT dollars. The market saw broad gains, with electronics stocks up 2.1% and financials up 0.7%. Key sectors such as TPU, PCB, solar energy, and bicycles also performed strongly. The Taiwan Futures Index surged 645 points to close at 32,261 points, with a positive price difference of 65.64 points compared to the spot market, signaling further upside potential. Analysts, including Chiu Yen-min of KGI Securities, Chen Yi-guang of Fubon Securities, and Huang Wen-qing of Taishin Securities, noted that after a moderate correction to address overvaluation and high positive deviation, the market maintained strength above the 20-day moving average with controlled volume and price dynamics, suggesting a potential push toward the 33,000-point milestone. With only six trading days remaining before the Lunar Year closing, the index may reach a new historical high of 33,000 points.

The rally was led by Shin Hua, which hit a new high and drove the 'thousand-dollar stocks' sector higher. Despite intraday volatility, particularly in the memory chip sector with sharp price swings and a surge in intraday trading ratio to 43.58%\u2014the highest since November 21, 2025\u2014market sentiment remained resilient. Foreign investors ended two days of net selling, turning to net buying of NT$7.268 billion, while the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) stabilized at 31.57, ending a three-day losing streak. The NTD's recovery was supported by export-oriented companies' year-end foreign exchange sales and central bank intervention. Analysts, including Huang Yiting of First Gold Investment and Huang Wenqing of Taishin Investment, noted that the market\u2019s stability hinges on holding the 10-day line at 32,055 points; if sustained, the index may remain in a high-range consolidation near 32,500 points. A breach below this level could trigger a test of the monthly moving average at 31,473 points, which is expected to serve as key support. Investors are advised to reduce holdings in high-float, high-intraday-trading stocks such as memory chips, CPO, and low-orbit satellites to 50%-60% before year-end, while maintaining 75%-80% in fundamentally strong, institutionally held stocks with low retail participation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:10 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20260204000165-260202)\n\n**Taiwan Stock Market Rebounds Strongly, Eyes 33,000 Point Target Before Year-End Closure**\nTaiwan's stock market staged a strong rebound, with the weighted index rising 571 points to close at 32,195 points on February 3, 2026, reclaiming the '32K' level after three consecutive days of gains totaling over 1,000 points.

Despite briefly turning negative to a low of 32,269 points, the index surged to 32,499 points\u2014up 215 points\u2014driven by synchronized rebounds in gold, silver, and international crude oil. By around 9:30 p.m., the index stabilized near 32,944 points, up approximately 110 points. The rebound was fueled by gold\u2019s rise of over 6%, silver\u2019s surge of more than 13%, and copper\u2019s gain of over 4%, following market digestion of the dovish outlook from newly appointed Federal Reserve Chair, Dr. Wachter. Despite volatility in the Dow Jones electronic session, bullish momentum prevailed, lifting the night session. Key stocks like TSMC (2330) traded near 1,810 yuan, up 10 yuan, with the electronic futures up 0.14% and semiconductor futures up about 0.71%. The broader market closed higher, with the Taiwan Stock Exchange index rising 571 points to 32,195 points. Foreign investors bought 7.26 billion NT dollars in spot shares, reducing net short positions in the Taiwan Index Futures to 26,494 contracts. Investment trusts bought 10.63 billion NT dollars, while domestic dealers sold 6.89 billion NT dollars. Combined, the three major institutional investors were net buyers of 11.01 billion NT dollars. Market experts noted that the market opened strong, tested resistance at the 5- and 10-day moving averages, and maintained steady volume during consolidation. The index ultimately closed above the previous day\u2019s high of 32,008 points, indicating recovery from overbought conditions and firm support at the monthly moving average, with balanced volume and price action suggesting potential for further upward movement.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:32 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/11112/9306987)\n\n**Taiwan Stock Market Surges 571 Points, Reclaims 32,000 Level Amid AI and LEO Satellite Rally**\nOn February 3, 2026, Taiwan's stock market surged 571.33 points, closing at 32,195.36 points\u2014reclaiming the 32,000 level\u2014with a 1.81% gain and a trading volume of NT$794.99 billion. The TAIEX rebounded amid a U.S. market recovery driven by strong equity performance, rising gold, silver, and Bitcoin volatility, and uncertain Federal Reserve outlook. The rally was led by tech stocks, particularly AI-related sectors: TSMC surged 35 NT$, closing at 1,800 NT$, contributing significantly to the index; MediaTek jumped 90 NT$ to 1,795 NT$, up 5.27%; and Xiangda (5274) rose 750 NT$ to 9,790 NT$, nearing the 10,000 NT$ threshold. Key semiconductor sub-sectors including probe cards and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite stocks led gains, with companies like Yingwei, Wangxi, Jingce, and Yongzhi benefiting from supply disruptions in Japan\u2019s semiconductor materials due to a historic snowstorm. Analyst Chen Hsueh-jin of Lun Yuan Investment noted that AI remains the central theme for the year, with LEO satellite stocks\u2014such as Shengda Ke, Huatung, Yaodeng, Zhaoh\u00e9, Yaohua, and Qikong\u2014expected to remain focal points due to the commercialization of satellite infrastructure and the rise of 'space AI data centers.' Other key areas include ASIC design (Creative, Shixin-KY), PCB (Jinxiang Dian), CCL (Taike Dian), fiberglass (Dehong), and AI server components. In contrast, memory stocks like Winbond, Nanya, Phison, and Powerchip faced selling pressure due to mixed market signals and chaotic positioning, with Phison dropping 155 NT$ to 1,990 NT$ (-7.22%) and Nanya K. falling 16.5 NT$ to 277.5 NT$ (-5.61%). Analyst Rong Yishen of Qifa Investment warned that high-priced stocks remain under pressure due to end-of-year profit-taking and foreign investor liquidation, with the 33,000-point mark still out of reach. Despite short-term risks, the market is expected to maintain momentum if international developments and U.S. Treasury yields remain stable.

The rally followed a strong performance by U.S. chip and AI stocks, with major indices closing higher. The Taiwan Futures Index (TAIFEX) night session rose 625 points to 32,241 points. The main index opened 113.63 points higher at 31,737.66 points, quickly expanding gains beyond 600 points after TSMC\u2019s strong start. This recovery reversed a sharp drop the previous day, when the index fell 439.72 points to close at 31,624.03 points, with intraday lows touching 31,359.95 points\u2014down 703.8 points.

On the institutional side, foreign investors sold NT$480.5 billion, and dealers sold NT$104.98 billion, while investment trusts ended 26 consecutive days of net selling by buying back NT$49.53 billion. Analysts noted that the January rally caused a daily KDJ indicator to cross downward with expanding divergence, suggesting short-term caution. With a year-end line deviation exceeding 30% and a quarter-line deviation over 10%, profit-taking pressure intensified ahead of the Lunar New Year. Analysts recommend reducing leverage, trimming positions, and waiting for volume contraction to signal a bottom, while focusing on high-dividend, low-valued, and competitively strong stocks for gradual accumulation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:20 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/9305207)\n\n**Taiwan Stock Market Surges Over 600 Points, Reclaims Lost Ground as TSMC Rebounds to NT$1,810**\nOn February 3, 2026, Taiwan's stock market rebounded strongly, gaining over 600 points, reclaiming lost ground from the previous day. The index opened 113.63 points higher at 31,737.66, boosted by TSMC (2330) opening at NT$1,810, up 45 points.

The Taiex, Taiwan's benchmark index, rose 234.56 points, or 0.76%, to finish at 30,941.78, trading between 30,742.53 and 30,994.81, with turnover reaching NT$658.70 billion (US$20.82 billion). Concord Securities analyst Kerry Huang attributed the rally to funds rotating out of TSMC into tech stocks with lower valuations, noting that the passive electronics component segment benefited significantly. Yageo Corp. surged 6.91% to NT$278.50, and Kaimei Electronic Corp. rose 4.71% to NT$100.00, driven by a product price hike. AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. gained 3.53% to NT$234.50, and Quanta Computer Inc. advanced 2.51% to NT$286.00. TSMC, which accounts for over 40% of the Taiex's market value, closed flat at NT$1,710.00, as investors held back ahead of its upcoming investor conference, awaiting 2025 results, 2026 guidance, and potential updates on U.S. investment plans.

The index briefly reached an intraday high of 29,009.81. Over the year, the TAIEX rose 5,928.5 points, or 25.73%, its largest annual point increase, extending its streak of yearly gains above 20% to three consecutive years. The rally was driven by strong performances from major technology stocks, particularly TSMC, which closed at NT$1,550\u2014its all-time high\u2014adding 240 points to the index\u2019s daily gain and contributing NT$12.31 trillion in market value. Other top performers included Foxconn (up 1.1% to NT$230.50), MediaTek (up 0.7% to NT$1,430), and Delta Electronics (up 0.21% to NT$963). Semiconductor testing and packaging stocks like Formosa Advanced Technologies and Ardentec hit daily trading limits, with Ardentec posting a 37% cumulative gain over five sessions. Panel makers Innolux and AUO saw strong volume and gains of 4.6% and 1.66%, respectively. The combined market capitalization of listed companies reached NT$94.36 trillion, an increase of NT$20.45 trillion from 2024, while total market value\u2014including over-the-counter firms\u2014exceeded NT$100 trillion for the first time, reaching NT$101.76 trillion. AI-related demand extended beyond chip foundries to memory, power management, cooling systems, networking, and data center infrastructure, with structural tightness in the memory market boosting prices and stocks like Nanya Technology. Taishin Securities' Huang Wen-ching attributed the market's resilience to solid AI fundamentals, noting that the impact of US tariffs was less than expected. Looking ahead, analysts forecast the TAIEX to range between 26,000 and 30,000 points in Q1 2026, driven by continued AI infrastructure investment, next-gen chip development, and cloud providers\u2019 expansion of proprietary AI hardware and software. The top 20 gainers in 2025 were dominated by PCB and memory companies, with Glotech Industrial rising 686.1%, Nanya Technology 559.8%, Topoint Technology 483%, Winbond Electronics 458.1%, and Co-tech Development 382.2%. Other top performers included Walton Advanced Engineering (316.6%), Qualipoly Chemical (312.4%), and Chenbro Micom (282.8%). Analysts attribute the surge to rising demand for AI servers, upgraded server specs, increased need for upstream materials, higher memory prices, and greater computational demand. The market\u2019s growth reflects a broadening AI-driven trend beyond Nvidia\u2019s supply chain to a wider ecosystem of customized chips and infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 02:06 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6274848)\n\n**Taiwan Stock Index Futures Night Session Shows Weak Bullish Momentum; Analysts Forecast Year-End Volatility with Bullish Bias**\nOn December 29, 2025, the Taiwan Stock Index Futures (TAIFEX) night session opened at 28,940 points, trading in a flat range with a high of 28,955 points and a low of 28,818 points, a range of 137 points. By 9:40 PM, the index stood at 28,831 points, down 109 points or 0.3%. Despite initial upward momentum driven by bullish buying, the rally stalled, reflecting short-term consolidation. According to Yu-Fu and Yung-Feng Futures, with 2025 year-end closing approaching and U.S. markets in holiday mode, the corporate accounting season is in its final phase. Short-term, the market is expected to be dominated by domestic investors, with potential for further highs. Although the overall trend remains positive, geopolitical uncertainty could impact market direction, and investors should remain cautious of underlying economic instability. Optimism surrounding next year\u2019s tech industry visibility, sustained AI capital spending cycles, and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts are already pricing in, making it plausible for the index to challenge or surpass 29,000 by year-end and possibly even break 30,000 in January 2026, provided no systemic external risks emerge. The market is expected to maintain a high-range, bullish-tilted consolidation pattern, though short-term volatility remains. Domestic investors continue to lead, with blue-chip and high-priced tech stocks, including TSMC (2330), driving gains and creating a strong, resilient structure with strong support on pullbacks. This suggests that funds are actively positioning for 2026, not just short-term speculation, indicating a clear trend-driven movement.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/11112/9233262)\n\n**Taiwan stock market ends 10-week rise | Taiwan News | Nov. 8, 2025 09:19**\nTaiwan's stock market ended lower on Friday, November 8, 2025, closing the 10-week winning streak after the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) dropped 248.04 points to 27,651.41, with turnover reaching NT$469 billion (US$15.1 billion).

Eclat Textile surged to its daily limit at NT$413, driven by strong third-quarter earnings and plans to expand in Indonesia. Fubon Research noted foreign investors were net sellers for five consecutive sessions, contributing to market weakness. Analysts cited uncertainty over US technology valuations and reports of Washington tightening export restrictions on Nvidia chips as factors dampening regional sentiment. Despite short-term volatility, analysts expect the TAIEX to consolidate near its monthly moving average, supported by steady turnover, and advised investors to focus on companies with strong fundamentals and limited exposure to cyclical or geopolitical risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 01:27 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6239460)\n\n**Market Stays Cautious During Long Weekend, Taiwan Stock Index Drops 116 Points to Close at 27,532, Weekly Gain Extends to Four Consecutive Weeks**\nDue to the National Day holiday, Taiwan's stock market was closed on October 23, 2025, with the Taiex index ending at 27,532 points, down 116 points (0.42%) after dipping as low as 27,371 points during the session.

KGI Investment Advisory noted that the market has risen 100% since the end of 2022, and it remains optimistic that the rally will continue through 2026. The firm attributes the current up\u2011trend mainly to AI\u2011driven supply\u2011chain growth, especially the capital\u2011expenditure expansion of large cloud\u2011service providers (CSPs) that benefit Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor and AI\u2011server sectors. KGI explains that historically, price peaks tend to appear roughly six months before profit peaks, suggesting a strong link between fundamentals and stock prices. It also projects that AI applications will expand from the cloud to edge computing and end\u2011of\u2011line devices, creating a second wave of growth before the end of next year. However, KGI cautions about short\u2011term volatility, warning that high AI\u2011stock valuations could trigger profit\u2011taking and that rising inflation might delay Fed rate cuts, further cooling market sentiment. For investors, KGI recommends focusing on sub\u2011segments with significant specification upgrades\u2014such as cooling, network\u2011to\u2011PCB, power supplies, and copper\u2011foil substrates\u2014and to enter gradually during corrections.
