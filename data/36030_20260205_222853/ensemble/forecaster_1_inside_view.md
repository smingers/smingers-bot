I'll provide a comprehensive analysis following the specified framework:

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Target Variable Paraphrase:
Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index (TAIEX) value at 2026 year-end close

2. Outside View Base Rate:
- Current value (2026-02-05): 32,000
- Historical growth rate: ~39% over two years
- 2025 year-end value: 28,963.6

3. Consistency Check:
Implied median ≈ 36,500; mean ≈ 37,000 - aligned with growth trajectory and AI sector momentum

4. Most Significant Evidence:
- TSMC projects 30% revenue increase in 2026
- Global semiconductor industry expected 26% growth in 2026
- AI infrastructure driving massive tech investment
- Geopolitical tensions provide potential downside risk

5. Blind-Spot Statement:
China-Taiwan conflict could catastrophically crash the index, potentially pushing it below 20,000

Detailed Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Key Sources:
1. TWSE Year-End Report (High Reliability)

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 11 months
- If timeframe halved: Lower growth, more volatile
- If timeframe doubled: Potentially smoother trajectory

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. AI-driven semiconductor demand
2. TSMC's market leadership
3. Global tech investment cycles
4. Geopolitical risk premium

Probability Distribution Considerations:
- Asymmetric distribution favoring upside
- Wide confidence intervals accounting for uncertainty
- Potential for significant volatility

Calibrated Prediction Rationale:
- Lower percentiles reflect geopolitical risks
- Mid-percentiles capture expected growth
- Higher percentiles represent exceptional performance scenarios

Final Forecast:

Percentile 10: 28,000
Percentile 20: 31,500
Percentile 40: 34,500
Percentile 60: 37,500
Percentile 80: 40,500
Percentile 90: 43,000

Confidence Level: Moderate-High, with significant uncertainty around geopolitical risks.
