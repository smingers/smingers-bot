I'll meticulously analyze the forecast for the TAIEX value at the end of 2026, following the structured approach you've outlined.

Target Variable Paraphrase:
Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index (TAIEX) value at market close on final 2026 trading day, measured in index points.

Outside View Base Rate:
- End of 2024: 23,000 points
- End of 2025: 28,964 points
- Average annual growth: ~25.9%
- Base projection for end of 2026 (simple extrapolation): ~36,500 points

Source Analysis:
(Detailed analysis in previous submission, focusing on key insights)

Key Sources:
1. Yahoo Finance (TSMC Outlook):
- Factual: TSMC expects 30% 2026 revenue increase
- Expert Opinion: Bullish on AI computing hardware demand

2. Deloitte Semiconductor Outlook:
- Factual: Global semiconductor industry projected to reach $975B in 2026
- Expert Opinion: 26% industry growth expected

3. Taiwan Stock Exchange Annual Report:
- Factual: Market capitalization reached NT$94.36T in 2025
- Expert Opinion: AI infrastructure driving market expansion

Evidence Weighing:

Strong Evidence:
- TSMC's projected 30% revenue growth
- Global semiconductor industry's robust expansion
- Continued AI infrastructure investment
- Taiwan's strategic position in semiconductor supply chain

Moderate Evidence:
- Geopolitical stability assessments
- Potential US-China technology tensions
- Global economic recovery indicators

Weak Evidence:
- Short-term market volatility
- Speculative AI technology projections

Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 11 months from current date
- If timeframe halved: More volatile, narrower confidence interval
- If timeframe doubled: Broader potential outcomes, increased uncertainty

Justification Factors:
1. Semiconductor Industry Momentum
2. AI Technology Infrastructure Expansion
3. TSMC's Market Leadership
4. Geopolitical Risk Premium

Blind Spot Statement:
Most likely scenario to invalidate forecast: Unexpected China-Taiwan conflict causing sudden market collapse.

Consistency Check:
- Implied Median: ~35,000
- Mean: Slightly higher due to right-skewed distribution
- Alignment: Consistent with growth trajectory and expert projections

Confidence Interval Rationale:
- Wide range to accommodate geopolitical and technological uncertainties
- Asymmetric distribution reflecting potential upside
- Conservative lower bounds
- Optimistic upper bounds reflecting AI and semiconductor potential

Final Forecast Distribution:

Percentile 10: 27,000
Percentile 20: 30,500
Percentile 40: 33,500
Percentile 60: 36,500
Percentile 80: 39,500
Percentile 90: 42,000

This distribution reflects:
- Base growth rate of semiconductor industry
- TSMC's projected performance
- Potential AI infrastructure expansion
- Geopolitical risk premium
- Historical market volatility

The forecast maintains humility by providing a wide confidence interval, acknowledging the complexity of predicting financial markets, especially in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
