I'll break down my analysis systematically following the prescribed framework:

1. Target Variable Paraphrase:
TAIEX index value at 2026 year-end, measured in index points, with a resolution window closing January 31, 2027.

2. Outside View Base Rate:
- Current TAIEX value (2026-02-05): ~32,000
- 2025 Year-End Close: 28,963.6
- Historical Annual Growth: ~25% in 2025
- Base Rate Projection: ~36,000-38,000 range

3. Source Analysis:
Strong Sources:
- TWSE Official Data: High credibility, factual market statistics
- Deloitte Semiconductor Outlook: Expert analysis, global industry projection
- Ocac.gov.tw Market Report: Official government economic data

Moderate Sources:
- Yahoo Finance TSMC Analysis: Financial industry perspective
- Seeking Alpha TSM Article: Investment-focused analysis

Weak Sources:
- General news reports with speculative commentary

4. Evidence Weighing:

Strong Evidence:
- TSMC projects 30% 2026 revenue increase
- Global semiconductor industry expected 26% growth in 2026
- Taiwan stock market demonstrated resilience in 2025
- AI infrastructure investment driving tech valuations

Moderate Evidence:
- Potential geopolitical tensions with China
- Global economic uncertainty
- Semiconductor supply chain dynamics

Weak Evidence:
- Short-term market sentiment
- Individual stock performance

5. Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 11 months
- If timeframe halved: More volatile, narrower confidence interval
- If timeframe doubled: Lower confidence, wider potential outcomes

6. Blind Spot Statement:
Most likely scenario to invalidate forecast: Sudden China-Taiwan military conflict, which could dramatically crash the index.

7. Consistency Check:
- Implied Median: ~35,000
- Mean: Similar to median
- Alignment: Consistent with growth projections and market momentum

8. Top Evidence Influencing Prediction:
a) TSMC's strong 2026 revenue growth projection
b) Global semiconductor industry expansion
c) AI infrastructure investment driving tech sector
d) Taiwan's demonstrated market resilience in 2025

9. Confidence Assessment:
- Moderate-High Confidence (65-75%)
- Wide intervals to account for geopolitical and economic uncertainties

10. Final Probabilistic Prediction:

Percentile 10: 28,000
Percentile 20: 30,500
Percentile 40: 33,500
Percentile 60: 36,500
Percentile 80: 39,500
Percentile 90: 42,000

Rationale: The prediction reflects:
- Base growth from 2025 closing value
- Strong semiconductor and AI sector fundamentals
- Potential geopolitical risk buffers
- Asymmetric distribution accounting for upside potential and downside risks
