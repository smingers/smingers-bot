I'll provide a comprehensive analysis following the structured approach you outlined:

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Target Variable Paraphrase:
Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Index (TAIEX) value at market close on final 2026 trading day

2. Outside View Base Rate:
- End of 2025 TAIEX value: 28,963.6
- Historical growth rate: ~25% annually in recent years
- Base rate prediction: Around 36,000-38,000 points

3. Consistency Check:
Implied median ≈ 35,000; mean ≈ 36,500 - aligned with base rate and current momentum

4. Most Significant Evidence:
- TSMC projects 30% revenue growth in 2026
- AI chip market expected to approach $500 billion in 2026
- Global semiconductor industry projected 26% growth
- Taiwan stock market demonstrated resilience in 2025

5. Blind-Spot Statement:
Potential China-Taiwan military conflict could catastrophically drop the index by 40%+ (downside risk)

Detailed Analysis:

3. Seeking Alpha (Moderate Reliability)
- Factual: Record Q4 2025 results
- Cautionary Opinion: Potential valuation risks
- Credibility: Investment analysis perspective

(b) Evidence Weighing:
Strong Evidence:
- TSMC's sustained growth trajectory
- Continued AI infrastructure investment
- Semiconductor industry expansion

Moderate Evidence:
- Geopolitical stability assumptions
- Global tech investment trends
- Market capitalization growth

Weak Evidence:
- Short-term market sentiment
- Speculative tech valuations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 11 months
- If timeframe halved: More volatile, narrower range
- If timeframe doubled: Broader potential outcomes

(d) Justification Factors:
- AI-driven semiconductor demand
- Technological infrastructure investments
- Taiwan's strategic market position
- Global economic recovery signals

Probabilistic Considerations:
- Base scenario: Continued growth
- Downside scenarios: Geopolitical disruption
- Upside potential: AI and tech boom

Confidence Assessment:
- Moderate-High Confidence (65-75%)
- Wide intervals to account for uncertainties

Final Prediction Distribution:

Percentile 10: 28,000
Percentile 20: 31,000
Percentile 40: 34,000
Percentile 60: 37,000
Percentile 80: 40,000
Percentile 90: 43,000

Rationale: Reflects potential growth, semiconductor momentum, and geopolitical uncertainty, centered around current market levels with asymmetric upside potential.
