Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality, Recent):**

1. **South Carolina DHEC (January 27, 2026)**: 789 cases in SC outbreak as of today. Factual data, official state health department. Most current source available.

2. **NBC News (January 23, 2026)**: Reports 206 cases in first week of 2026, 2,255 final 2025 count. Expert opinion from Dr. Nathan Lo (Stanford) predicting "another year of high measles cases" in 2026. High-quality journalism with named expert.

3. **CIDRAP (January 27, 2026)**: Confirms 789 SC cases, 416 total US cases as of their publication. Expert opinion from CDC's Dr. Ralph Abraham downplaying outbreak significance (though this reflects political stance, not epidemiological assessment). Reliable medical news source.

4. **ASTHO (January 21, 2026)**: 2,144 cases in 2025 (slight variance from NBC's 2,255 likely due to reporting lag). Notes April 13, 2026 PAHO review scheduled. Authoritative public health source.

5. **Healthline (mid-January 2026)**: 171 cases as of mid-January across 9 jurisdictions. Expert opinions from multiple MDs (Lo, Tse, Fisher, Liu, Schaffner) all predicting continued high cases in 2026. Medical news source with multiple expert perspectives.

**AskNews Articles (January 27, 2026):**
- **AP/NBC/ABC**: Confirm 789 SC cases, 416 national cases, with additional Utah-Arizona outbreak (222+216=438 cases combined)
- **Total national as of Jan 27**: Approximately 416 confirmed cases per CDC, but state-level reporting suggests higher (SC 789 + UT/AZ 438 = 1,227 just from major outbreaks)
- **Key factual data**: 92.5% kindergarten vaccination (below 95% herd immunity threshold), 93% of 2025 cases in unvaccinated

**Critical Factual Consensus:**
- 2025 final: 2,144-2,255 cases (sources agree within 5%)
- January 2026 start: 206-416 cases depending on reporting date
- Major ongoing outbreaks: SC (789), UT-AZ border (438 combined)
- Vaccination coverage: 92.5%, below 95% threshold for 5th consecutive year
- 49 outbreaks in 2025 vs 16 in 2024

**Expert Opinion Summary (Named Sources Only):**
- Dr. Nathan Lo (Stanford): Predicts "another year of high measles cases" in 2026
- Dr. Graham Tse (Memorial Care): "Likely that measles outbreaks will continue, and the numbers could rise in 2026"
- Dr. Kristin Moffitt (Boston Children's): "Very alarmed," attributes to declining vaccination
- Multiple experts emphasize 90% transmission rate and importance of 95% vaccination threshold

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large prediction shifts warranted):**

1. **Structural vaccination decline**: 92.5% coverage for 5th year below 95% threshold. Multiple independent sources confirm. This is a structural factor difficult to reverse quickly. Historical precedent: 2000-2019 had >95% coverage with <200 cases annually; current <95% coverage correlates with 2,000+ cases.

2. **Multiple large concurrent outbreaks**: SC (789 cases), UT-AZ (438 cases) both active as of Jan 27. These represent 1,227 cases from just two outbreak clusters. Historical pattern: 2025's 49 outbreaks drove 87% of cases. Current outbreak density suggests similar or higher 2026 total.

3. **January pace significantly elevated**: 206 cases in first week = ~30 cases/day rate. Even accounting for seasonal peak, this is 3-4x higher than typical January rates in elimination era. Multiple sources confirm this is not reporting artifact.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate prediction shifts):**

1. **Expert consensus**: 5+ named infectious disease experts predict continued high or rising cases. While expert predictions aren't deterministic, consensus among specialists carries weight.

2. **Year-over-year acceleration**: 2023→2024 (4.8x), 2024→2025 (7.9x). Trend shows acceleration, not linear growth. However, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely due to susceptible pool constraints.

3. **Loss of regional elimination status**: Americas region lost status November 2025. This signals systemic deterioration in vaccination infrastructure, though direct causal link to 2026 cases is indirect.

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Small adjustments only):**

1. **Political messaging**: CDC deputy director's "cost of doing business" comment reflects policy stance but doesn't directly predict epidemiological outcomes.

2. **Media attention**: Current outbreak coverage could increase vaccination uptake, but this is speculative and short-term indicator.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 338 days remaining (January 27 - December 31, 2026)

**Current Position**: 27 days into year with 416 confirmed cases (per most recent CDC data in sources)

**If Timeframe Halved (169 days, through June 30, 2026):**
- Would capture winter/spring peak season (typically 50-60% of annual cases)
- Current 416 cases in 27 days = 15.4 cases/day
- If sustained through Q1-Q2: ~2,600 cases by June 30
- Prediction would shift DOWN significantly: P50 ~1,500-2,000 cases

**If Timeframe Doubled (676 days, through December 31, 2027):**
- Would capture full 2026 + all of 2027
- Assumes current deterioration continues through 2027
- If 2026 = 3,500 cases and 2027 follows 2-3x growth: 7,000-10,500 cumulative
- Prediction would shift UP significantly: P50 ~8,000-12,000 cases

**Seasonal Pattern Impact:**
- Measles peaks late winter/early spring (January-April)
- Summer months (June-August) typically 50-70% lower transmission
- Current January pace (30 cases/day) likely unsustainable year-round
- More realistic annual average: 10-15 cases/day = 3,650-5,475 cases

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Anchoring**: 2025 total of 2,255 cases (using NBC's figure as most recent)

**Key Factors Warranting UPWARD Adjustment:**

1. **Hot Start (Strong)**: 416 cases in 27 days = 15.4/day average. Even accounting for seasonal peak, this is 2-3x higher than 2025's average (2,255/365 = 6.2/day). If winter peak (Jan-Mar) represents 40% of annual total and continues at current pace: 416 cases in 27 days → ~1,600 in 90 days (Q1) → ~4,000 annual total.

2. **Multiple Active Large Outbreaks (Strong)**: SC outbreak at 789 cases is already 35% of 2025 total and still growing (89 new cases in 4 days per Jan 27 update). UT-AZ outbreak adds 438 cases. Combined 1,227 cases from just 2 outbreaks suggests 2026 will substantially exceed 2025.

3. **Structural Vaccination Decline (Strong)**: 92.5% coverage is 2.5 percentage points below herd immunity threshold. With ~4 million kindergartners annually, this represents ~100,000 additional susceptibles per cohort. Cumulative effect over 5 years below threshold creates large susceptible pool.

4. **Accelerating Growth Trajectory (Moderate)**: 2023→2024 growth was 4.8x, 2024→2025 was 7.9x. While exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, the acceleration pattern suggests continued strong growth in 2026.

**Key Factors Warranting DOWNWARD Adjustment:**

1. **Outbreak Burnout (Moderate)**: Large outbreaks exhaust local susceptible populations. SC's 789 cases in Spartanburg County may limit further growth there. Texas 2025 outbreak (760 cases) ended after exhausting susceptibles in affected Mennonite community.

2. **Seasonal Decline (Moderate)**: January represents peak transmission season. Summer months (June-August) typically see 50-70% reduction. Current 30/day pace will likely drop to 10-15/day in summer.

3. **Public Health Response (Moderate)**: SC received $1.5M CDC funding, mobile vaccination clinics deployed. Heightened awareness may increase vaccination uptake, though structural barriers remain.

4. **Mathematical Ceiling (Strong)**: With 92.5% vaccination, maximum susceptible pool is ~7.5% of child population. Across 0-19 age group (~75M), this is ~5.6M susceptibles. Even with 10% attack rate, maximum is ~560,000 cases - but realistically, outbreak dynamics and geographic dispersion limit annual totals to 10,000-20,000 range.

**Distribution Reasoning:**

The outside view base rate of 2,255 (2025) should be adjusted upward based on:
- Current pace: 416 cases in 27 days projects to 5,624 annualized (but unsustainable)
- Seasonal adjustment: If Q1 is 40% of year at current pace, implies ~4,000 annual
- Outbreak-driven: 2 large outbreaks (1,227 cases) + baseline (1,500-2,000) = 2,700-3,200
- Expert consensus: Multiple MDs predict "continued high" or "rising" cases

However, constraints include:
- Outbreak burnout will moderate large outbreak growth
- Seasonal decline will reduce summer transmission
- Some public health response effect expected

**Synthesis**: Evidence strongly supports 2026 exceeding 2025 (2,255 cases), with central estimate in 3,000-4,500 range. January's aggressive start and multiple large active outbreaks justify material upward revision from base rate. However, exponential growth is unsustainable due to outbreak dynamics and susceptible pool constraints.

## Probability Calibration

**Anchoring Process:**

Starting from 2025 base rate of 2,255 cases:

**Low Scenarios (P1-P20):**
- P1 (1%): Aggressive intervention + outbreak containment + vaccination surge: ~800 cases
- P10: Strong public health response, early outbreak control: ~1,500 cases  
- P20: Moderate response, slower growth than 2024-25: ~2,200 cases

**Central Scenarios (P40-P60):**
- P40: Continued growth, 2-3 large outbreaks contained: ~3,200 cases
- P50: Base case with current trends: ~3,800 cases
- P60: Stronger growth, 3-4 large outbreaks: ~4,600 cases

**High Scenarios (P80-P99):**
- P80: Multiple large outbreaks, limited containment: ~6,200 cases
- P90: Severe deterioration, 5+ large outbreaks: ~8,500 cases
- P99: Worst case, near-exponential growth: ~13,000 cases

**Calibration Checks:**

1. **January pace check**: 416 cases in 27 days = 5,624 annualized. My P90 (8,500) is 50% higher than straight annualization, accounting for seasonal decline.

2. **Outbreak arithmetic**: SC (789) + UT-AZ (438) = 1,227 from 2 outbreaks. If 3-4 more similar outbreaks occur: 1,227 + 1,500 (3 more at 500 each) + 1,500 baseline = 4,227. This aligns with my P50-P60 range.

3. **Expert opinion**: Multiple experts predict "continued high" or "rising." My P50 of 3,800 (68% increase over 2025) seems consistent with "rising" while not being extreme.

4. **Historical growth**: 2024→2025 was 7.9x. My P50 implies 1.7x growth, much more conservative, reflecting outbreak burnout and seasonal effects.

5. **Hint calibration**: Expected range 20-5,000. My distribution spans 800-13,000, with P80 at 6,200 (slightly above hint's upper bound). This suggests question-writers expect most probability mass below 5,000, which aligns with my P40-P70 range.

**Final Adjustments:**

- Slightly increase lower percentiles to account for already-confirmed 416 cases + active outbreaks
- Moderately widen upper tail to account for possibility of multiple simultaneous large outbreaks
- Ensure P50 reflects genuine central tendency given strong evidence for upward revision from 2025

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total confirmed measles cases reported in United States during calendar year 2026 (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2026)

2. **Outside view base rate**: 2,255 cases (2025 final count), up from 285 (2024). Reference class: 2024-2026 outbreak cycle with sub-95% vaccination coverage.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 3,800; mean ≈ 4,500. Makes sense given 416 cases already confirmed in 27 days, multiple large active outbreaks (SC: 789, UT-AZ: 438), and expert consensus predicting "continued high" cases. Median represents 68% increase over 2025, aligned with current pace and outbreak density.

4. **Top evidence influencing prediction**:
   - 416 cases in first 27 days (15.4/day pace, 2.5x higher than 2025 average)
   - Two large active outbreaks totaling 1,227 cases (SC: 789, UT-AZ: 438)
   - Vaccination coverage at 92.5%, below 95% herd immunity threshold for 5th year
   - Expert consensus (5+ named MDs) predicting continued high/rising cases
   - 49 outbreaks in 2025 vs 16 in 2024, indicating accelerating outbreak frequency

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Aggressive federal vaccination campaign + media-driven uptake surge + early outbreak containment could dramatically reduce cases, making my forecast look pessimistic. This would push outcome DOWN toward 1,500-2,500 range. Conversely, complete public health system breakdown or emergence of vaccine-resistant strain would push UP toward 15,000+, but this is less likely than coordinated response scenario.
