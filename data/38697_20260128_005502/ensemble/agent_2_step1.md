## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Post-elimination US measles years (2000-2023):** Typically 30-200 cases/year, with occasional spikes (1,274 in 2019). This reference class may be less relevant given the structural break in 2024-2025.

2. **Recent outbreak years (2024-2025):** 285 cases (2024) → 2,255 (2025). This shows an accelerating outbreak trajectory but only 2 data points.

3. **Pre-elimination era with similar vaccination coverage (early 1990s):** When coverage was ~90-92%, the US saw thousands of cases annually. However, healthcare infrastructure and surveillance have improved.

4. **Current trajectory extrapolation (late 2025 into 2026):** Most relevant given that:
   - 206 cases already reported in first week of 2026
   - Multiple active outbreaks (South Carolina with 200 active infections)
   - Vaccination coverage continues declining (92.5% in 2024-25 school year)
   - US may lose elimination status (April 2026 review scheduled)

**Most suitable reference class:** The current outbreak trajectory (late 2025 into 2026) is most appropriate because:
- We have concrete 2026 data (206 cases in week 1)
- Active outbreaks are ongoing and documented
- Structural conditions (sub-95% vaccination, loss of regional elimination status) persist

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 months remaining in 2026 (Feb 1 - Dec 31, 2026), plus we already have data for the first ~4 weeks showing 206+ cases.

**Historical patterns:**
- 2019 outbreak: 1,274 cases, concentrated in first half of year
- 2025 outbreak: 2,255 cases, with major outbreaks beginning in February (West Texas) and October (Utah-Arizona border)
- Weekly case rate in early 2026: ~206 cases/week (first week)

**Seasonal patterns:**
Measles typically shows seasonal variation, with peaks in late winter/spring. The first week of 2026 showing 206 cases suggests we may be entering a peak period.

**Outbreak dynamics:**
- South Carolina alone has 200 active infections and 500+ in quarantine (as of Jan 16)
- 49 outbreaks occurred in 2025
- Outbreaks can persist for months (South Carolina outbreak latest quarantine ends Feb 14, 2026)

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting higher case counts in 2026:**

1. **Strong momentum from 2025:** The 8-fold increase from 2024 (285) to 2025 (2,255) indicates exponential growth, not linear.

2. **Early 2026 data point:** 206 cases in the first week alone. If this rate were sustained, we'd see 10,700+ cases (206 × 52 weeks), though this is likely an overestimate due to outbreak clustering.

3. **Active outbreak infrastructure:** South Carolina has 200 active infections with 500+ in quarantine. Other states likely have unreported active transmission.

4. **Declining vaccination coverage:** 92.5% is well below the 95% herd immunity threshold. The 2025-26 kindergarten cohort will have similar or worse coverage.

5. **Potential loss of elimination status:** The April 2026 PAHO review could formalize loss of elimination status, potentially reducing public health urgency or resources.

6. **Expert predictions:** Dr. Moffitt explicitly predicts "significant surges" if trends continue.

**Factors supporting lower case counts in 2026:**

1. **Public health response:** The 2025 outbreak may trigger enhanced vaccination campaigns and outbreak containment efforts.

2. **Outbreak saturation:** Large outbreaks like South Carolina's may burn through susceptible populations locally, reducing future transmission.

3. **Regression to mean:** The first week of 2026 may represent an outlier (peak of South Carolina outbreak) rather than sustained weekly rate.

4. **Seasonal decline:** If we're currently at a seasonal peak (winter/early spring), cases may decline in summer/fall.

**Quantitative anchors:**

- **Lower bound scenario:** If public health response is effective and outbreaks are contained, we might see 2026 similar to 2025: ~2,000-2,500 cases
- **Base case scenario:** Continued growth at a moderated rate (2-3x 2025): 4,500-7,000 cases
- **Upper bound scenario:** Sustained high transmission with multiple large outbreaks: 8,000-12,000 cases

However, the hint suggests the answer is between 20 and 5,000, which constrains my upper estimates.

**Most likely scenario:** Given 206 cases already in week 1, even if the weekly rate drops to 50-75 cases/week for the remainder of the year (which would be high by historical standards but much lower than week 1), we'd still see 2,600-3,900 cases total for the year. The momentum from 2025, active outbreaks, and structural factors (low vaccination coverage) suggest 2026 will exceed 2025's 2,255 cases.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to 2025 baseline:** 2,255 cases is our strongest anchor point.

**Week 1 data extrapolation:** 206 cases in week 1 suggests we're starting at a high rate. Even with significant moderation:
- Conservative: 50 cases/week average for remaining 51 weeks = 2,550 additional cases + 206 = 2,756 total
- Moderate: 75 cases/week average = 3,825 additional cases + 206 = 4,031 total
- High: 100 cases/week average = 5,100 additional cases + 206 = 5,306 total (exceeds hint upper bound)

**Distribution considerations:**
- The hint range (20-5,000) strongly suggests the forecasters expect 2026 to be in the same ballpark as 2025 or moderately higher
- 206 cases in week 1 alone makes outcomes below 1,500 highly unlikely
- The upper bound of 5,000 constrains extreme scenarios
- Most probable range: 2,500-4,500 cases

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Outbreak stochasticity: large outbreaks are inherently unpredictable
- Public health response effectiveness is unknown
- Vaccination campaign impact uncertain
- Seasonal patterns may or may not match 2025

**Setting percentiles:**
- P10: Should reflect optimistic scenario with effective containment but still acknowledge week 1 data
- P50: Should reflect continuation of current trajectory with some moderation
- P90: Should approach but not exceed the 5,000 hint upper bound

Given the strong early signal (206 cases week 1) and momentum from 2025, I'll set a distribution centered around 3,000-3,500 with meaningful spread.
