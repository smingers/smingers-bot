Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. ABC News, 24 Jan 2026 – Straightforward report on CDC’s weekly update (416 YTD cases). The figures and state list are factual (CDC data). Opinions are limited to quotes from two named paediatric infectious-disease physicians; both are credible experts. Publication is four days old, therefore current.  
2. NBC News, 23 Jan 2026 – Interactive tracker that mirrors CDC’s “Measles – Cases and Outbreaks” table. Gives 2025 final total (2 255) and 206 cases in the first epidemiological week of 2026. No anonymous sourcing; data quality high.  
3. AHA News, 5 Nov 2025 – Cites CDC counts (1 681 YTD for 2025 at that point). Slightly dated but still useful for mid-year trajectory and for hospitalisation share (12 %). Purely factual.  
4. ASTHO blog, 21 Jan 2026 – Public-health professional association. Gives 2025 total 2 144 (pre-final) and context on potential loss of elimination status. Relies on CDC and PAHO documents; high credibility. Contains some forward-looking opinion, but all from identifiable public-health entities.  
5. Perplexity agent report – Synthesises CDC historical series 2000-2025 and kindergarten two-dose MMR coverage trend. Underlying numbers match CDC’s own web tables and MMWR articles; therefore suitable for reference-class construction.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. All U.S. calendar-year measles totals since elimination (2000-2025). Pros: full 26-year sample; cons: dominated by many low-count years that may no longer be representative now that endemic transmission is plausible.  
2. “Surge” years in the post-elimination era (2008, 2011, 2014, 2019, 2025). Pros: captures dynamics when pockets of susceptibility ignite outbreaks. Cons: small N = 5.  
3. First two years after other high-income countries lost elimination (e.g., UK 2008-2009, Canada 2024-2025). Pros: better analogy to present U.S. situation; cons: international health-system differences.  

I use a weighted blend: 60 % weight on Surge-year class (median 667, mean 1 060) and 40 % on full post-elimination class (median 71, mean 259). That yields a “baseline expectation” ≈ 700–900 cases.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome will be measured on 31 Dec 2026 → 339 days remain. In 2025, 45 % of cases occurred in the first quarter, then a late-summer plateau, then a second bump in October-November. Seasonality is weak; outbreaks are driven by importations into undervaccinated communities. Therefore the 416 cases already logged (as of 24 Jan) almost certainly represent less than a quarter of the final 2026 total.

d) Justification for outside-view adjustment  
Facts pushing the number UP:  
• Start-of-year incidence is already running five times higher than the 2025 weekly average.  
• National two-dose kindergarten coverage has fallen to 92.5 %, lowest on record and below herd-immunity threshold in many counties.  
• The Americas collectively lost PAHO elimination status in Nov 2025, signalling that endemic chains can persist >12 months.  
Facts pushing the number DOWN:  
• Public-health response has intensified: emergency MMR clinics in South Carolina, CDC surge teams in Utah/Arizona and Georgia, daily primetime coverage. Historically (e.g., 2019), visible response flattened the curve within six months.  
• Outbreaks, though numerous, remain spatially clustered; many states still report zero cases in 2026.  

Balancing these, I raise the mean well above the 700-900 base-rate blend but keep it below an “explosive” >5 000 scenario that would require essentially uncontrolled nationwide spread. My outside-view mode is roughly 1 500–1 800 cases, with a long right tail to 4 000 given the possibility of a few large, vaccine-hesitant communities experiencing sustained transmission.

Outside view calibration:

1. Historical distribution 2000-2025: 90th percentile ≈ 1 700; max = 2 255. I widen the 90 % interval because susceptibility is higher now than in any prior year since elimination.  
2. I anchor the 10th percentile just above the 2024 total (285) because hitting a lower annual total would require an unprecedented mid-year collapse in transmission.  
3. I let the 90th percentile reach 4 000 – well below the 5 000 upper hint but almost double the 2025 record – reflecting low-but-real probability that 2026 becomes the first year to exceed two thousand by a large margin.  
4. The implied distribution (log-normal-ish) gives a mean around 1 800, median around 1 300, consistent with qualitative reasoning.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 400  
Percentile 20: 700  
Percentile 40: 1 200  
Percentile 60: 1 800  
Percentile 80: 3 000  
Percentile 90: 4 000
