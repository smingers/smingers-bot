Analysis:
a. Source analysis  
1. ABC News (late-Jan 2026). Factual numbers: 416 cumulative 2026 cases in 14 states; vaccination coverage 92.5 % in SY 2024-25. Opinion: Drs. Moffitt and Frenck warn that declining coverage will fuel “significant surges.” ABC is a mainstream news outlet that usually copies CDC data; data quality high, opinions credible (named paediatric infectious-disease specialists).  
2. NBC News data tracker (23 Jan 2026). Factual numbers: 206 cases in the first epidemiologic week of 2026; 2 255 cases in 2025; historical context. Uses CDC’s case linelist; good quality. Mostly descriptive; minimal opinion.  
3. AHA News (5 Nov 2025). Factual: 1 681 YTD 2025 cases, 12 % hospitalised, 42 states involved. Source ultimately CDC; reliable.  
4. ASTHO blog (21 Jan 2026). Factual: final 2025 total 2 144 – 2 255 cases; 49 outbreaks; loss of regional elimination status in Nov 2025. ASTHO is the US association of state/territorial health officials; high credibility. Contains no speculative projections.  
5. Agent report (2026). Collates CDC year-by-year counts: confirms 285 cases in 2024, 2 255 in 2025 and kindergarten MMR coverage falling from 95.2 % (2019-20) to 92.5 % (2024-25). Internal summary, but all figures trace back to CDC MMWR tables; good quality.

b. Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
– U.S. measles counts 2000-2025 (directly relevant).  
– U.K. or European post-elimination rebounds (e.g., U.K. 2018–19, Romania 2022-23). Less aligned with U.S. health-system dynamics.  
– Other U.S. vaccine-preventable disease rebounds (e.g., pertussis). Transmission characteristics differ.  
Chosen reference class: annual U.S. measles counts since elimination (2000-2025). It captures the same surveillance system, travel patterns, vaccine policies and public-health response.

c. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome window: calendar year 2026, i.e., 11 months and 4 days remaining (339 days). Historically, large U.S. surges (2019, 2025) accelerated rapidly once >300 cases were logged; both ended the year with about 3–6 × the first-quarter tally. Typical seasonality is weak (importations are year-round), but school-year clusters (Jan-May and Sep-Nov) matter.

d. Justification for outside view baseline  
Base-rate mean (2000-2023) ≈ 170 cases / yr. 2024-25 broke that pattern, driven by:  
• Four-year fall in kindergarten 2-dose MMR coverage from 95.2 % → 92.5 %.  
• Build-up of susceptible cohorts (roughly 250 000 extra unvaccinated children per birth cohort).  
• Post-COVID travel rebound.  
• Demonstrated capacity for multi-state transmission chains lasting >12 months (loss of PAHO elimination status).  

The 2026 starting position is materially worse than at any point since 2000: >400 confirmed cases before February and active outbreaks in at least five states. Unless aggressive catch-up campaigns immediately lift coverage back above 95 % (implausible in under a year), a repeat or escalation of 2025 is more likely than a return to pre-2024 levels.

Outside view calibration:
To reflect both persistence of 2025 conditions and uncertainty around outbreak control, I use a three-piece mixture anchored on the 2025 count (2 255):

1. Containment succeeds after Q1 (25 % weight). 2026 ends with roughly two-thirds of 2025’s burden: mean 1 500 cases; σ ≈ 300.  
2. Status-quo continuation (40 %). Total fluctuates around 2 500 cases; σ ≈ 400.  
3. Further escalation (25 %). Larger susceptible pool plus winter–spring amplification yields 3 500–4 500 cases; mean 4 000; σ ≈ 500.  
4. Low-probability sharp reversal (<10 %). Aggressive mandates plus luck: <1 000 cases.

Combining these gives an overall mean near 2 450 cases. A log-normal distribution with μ = 7.8, σ = 0.45 (using natural log) reproduces that mean and yields a wide 90 % interval (roughly 900-4 200), compatible with the hint (20-5 000). The tails allow for both vigorous suppression and a sizeable escalation without committing to extremely narrow uncertainty bands.
