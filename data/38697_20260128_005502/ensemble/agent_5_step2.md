Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, abridged)

• CDC-derived counts quoted by NBC News (23 Jan 2026) – 206 new U.S. cases in the first epi-week; 2025 total 2255.  High-quality, factual, date-stamped.

• Healthline (14 Jan 2026) – 171 U.S. cases YTD; expert quotes from Stanford and CDC.  Mostly factual, modest editorialising; good reliability.

• CIDRAP (27 Jan 2026) – 789 South-Carolina cases, biggest single U.S. outbreak since 1991.  CIDRAP is an academic centre with strong track-record; facts solid.

• AP & ABC wire stories (27 Jan 2026) – national 2026 tally “at least 416” cases in 14 states; two other large outbreaks (Utah-Arizona, 438 combined).  Mainstream, multi-source-checked.

• ASTHO blog (21 Jan 2026) – final 2025 count 2144-2255; 49 outbreaks; vaccination coverage 92.5 %.  Institutional source, data trace to CDC.

All other cited pieces repeat the same numeric backbone or add expert opinion.  No credible contradictory dataset was found.  Opinions used come from named clinicians or CDC staff; anonymous or political commentary was ignored.

2. Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• 416 confirmed U.S. cases before February – unprecedented early-year burden, confirmed by multiple independent outlets.  
• Persistent large, under-immunised clusters (SC private schools; Short Creek, UT-AZ) with 90 %+ unvaccinated cases – structural, hard to reverse quickly.  
• Kindergarten MMR coverage fell from 95.2 % (2019-20) to 92.5 % (2024-25) – CDC surveillance, nationwide.  
• Historical pattern: 2019 and 2025 surges produced 6–8 months of sustained transmission once >300 cases were logged.

Moderate evidence  
• Expert consensus (Stanford, Boston Children’s, CDC line staff) that 2026 will be “another high year”.  
• Federal response weakened by leadership sceptical of mandates (numerous quotes), suggesting slower containment.

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that PAHO may rescind elimination status in April – symbolic, not causal.  
• Anecdotes about quarantine fatigue.

3. Timeframe analysis

Forecast window: 339 days (27 Jan-31 Dec 2026).  
If the horizon were halved (to late-July), the mean would drop to roughly 1900 cases because summer lulls often occur.  If doubled (through 2027) the mean would climb above 3000 as new unvaccinated cohorts age into exposure.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Base-rate (2000-2023) mean 170 cases / yr.  After two consecutive high years (2024 = 285; 2025 = 2255) and with 416 cases already logged, the historic average is no longer informative.  
Key upward forces  
• Front-loaded case load (already 18 % of last year’s total).  
• Two simultaneous mega-outbreaks (>400 cases each) still growing.  
• Immunisation gap of ~2.7 percentage points nationwide equates to roughly 250 000 extra susceptible children per cohort.  
Limiting factors  
• Outbreaks in 2025 eventually burned out once local susceptibility was exhausted.  
• Several states (e.g., California) have shown capacity to surge vaccines and issue school exclusion orders within weeks.

Balancing these, I raise the centre of the distribution roughly 10 % above a simple “repeat of 2025” scenario, but still leave meaningful weight on quicker containment.

Probability calibration

I model a mixed scenario distribution (log-normal approximation) with mean about 2680 and the following percentiles:

Checklist:
1. Target variable: “Number of measles cases reported in the United States during calendar-year 2026.”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 170 cases / yr (2000-23).  
3. Consistency check – implied median 2500, mean 2680; fits narrative of slightly worse than 2025 with fat right tail.  
4. Key evidence: a) 416 cases before Feb; b) SC outbreak 789 cases and growing; c) second large UT-AZ outbreak (438); d) national MMR coverage 92.5 %.  
5. Blind spot: An aggressive, federally coordinated catch-up campaign starting Feb-Mar that lifts coverage >95 % quickly would push totals down, perhaps below 1000.
