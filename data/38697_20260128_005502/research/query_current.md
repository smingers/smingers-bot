Analysis:
To forecast the number of measles cases that will be reported in the United States in 2026, I first need a clear picture of recent U.S. measles incidence, the pace and geographic spread of current outbreaks, and the latest data on vaccination uptake and exemptions. Key information includes: (1) final tallies for 2024 and provisional counts for 2025; (2) any January 2026 outbreak reports or CDC Health Advisories; (3) trends in MMR vaccination coverage, especially among kindergartners; (4) policy or behavioral changes (e.g., stricter school-entry rules, new antivax legislation) that could alter 2026 risk; and (5) expert or CDC projections, if available. Recent news articles and CDC situation updates posted in late 2025 or January 2026 are therefore the most relevant sources to build an inside-view model of 2026 U.S. measles cases.
