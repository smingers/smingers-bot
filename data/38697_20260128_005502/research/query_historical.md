Analysis:
The U.S. officially eliminated endemic measles in 2000, so the annual count is driven by sporadic importations that spark outbreaks in undervaccinated communities. Since 2001 the median year has had only a few-dozen cases (often 20-80), but outliers have occurred when a single cluster spreads widely: 2008 (140), 2011 (220), 2014 (667), and especially 2019 (1 282). Case counts collapsed in 2020–2021 (13 and 49) because international travel and domestic mixing were curtailed by COVID-19 measures. Numbers rebounded once travel resumed: preliminary CDC figures suggest roughly 121 cases in 2022, about 58 in 2023, and several dozen in 2024 (driven by the large Ohio outbreak that began in late 2022). Rising non-medical exemptions in some states, plus lingering post-pandemic immunity gaps and increased global measles transmission, all raise the tail risk of another 2019-scale year, but elimination status, generally high MMR coverage (>90 % for kindergarteners) and post-outbreak containment efforts still make very large U.S. totals uncommon. For an outside-view forecast of 2026 it is therefore critical to gather: 1) the most recent official counts for 2024–2025, 2) current vaccination-coverage and exemption data, and 3) any evidence of ongoing importations or sizeable early-2026 clusters. Historical annual totals from 2000-2025 will anchor the base rate and help estimate the probability of an extreme outbreak year.
