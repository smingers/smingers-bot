This marks the worst outbreak in the U.S. in recent months, with 89 new cases confirmed since Friday. The outbreak has rapidly escalated, leading to hundreds of children being quarantined across dozens of schools, some more than once, and spreading to North Carolina and Ohio. Nationally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 416 measles cases in 2026, nearly 20% of the projected 2025 total. Other states with confirmed cases include California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. A concurrent outbreak in the Utah-Arizona border region\u2014specifically in Short Creek (Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona)\u2014has reported 222 cases in Arizona\u2019s Mohave County and 216 in Utah, with 55 cases confirmed in Utah in the past three weeks. Experts warn of possible undercounts in both regions. Measles, caused by a highly contagious airborne virus, leads to high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash, and can result in severe complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The MMR vaccine is 97% effective after two doses and provides lifelong protection, but childhood vaccination rates have declined since the pandemic, with increasing numbers of parents opting out via religious or personal conscience waivers. The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status due to these rising case numbers. Last year (2025), the U.S. reported 2,255 cases and nearly 50 outbreaks\u2014the worst since 1991\u2014resulting in three deaths, all among unvaccinated individuals, including two children in Texas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 08:20 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b)\n\n**South Carolina measles outbreak reaches 789 cases, surpassing Texas**\nSouth Carolina's measles outbreak has reached 789 confirmed cases, surpassing the 762 cases reported in the 2025 West Texas outbreak, which resulted in two fatalities. The outbreak is primarily concentrated in Spartanburg County, with most cases involving unvaccinated individuals or those unaware of their vaccination status. Health officials reported 89 new cases since Friday, indicating the outbreak remains uncontrolled. A total of 557 people are in quarantine for 21 days. Cases have spread to California, North Carolina, and Washington, with 14 confirmed cases in North Carolina, including a cluster linked to Shining Light Baptist Academy in Union County, where only 60.1% of students are vaccinated. A child at the school, who was unvaccinated and contagious, triggered the quarantine of over 170 individuals. Dr. Deborah Greenhouse, a Columbia pediatrician, expressed sadness and emphasized that increasing vaccination rates and enforcing isolation/quarantine are essential to ending the outbreak. Most affected individuals are children and teenagers, and at least 23 schools in South Carolina have students in quarantine. The outbreak began in late September and accelerated during the holidays. The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status if the virus continues to circulate for a full year from a single source. In 2025, the U.S. recorded 2,255 measles cases\u2014the highest since 1991\u2014and 416 cases were confirmed nationwide in January 2026, with 93% of patients unvaccinated. In a January 20 press call, CDC principal deputy director Dr. Ralph Abraham downplayed the outbreak, citing 'personal freedom' and porous borders, while acknowledging the MMR vaccine's effectiveness without explicitly urging vaccination.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:53 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-surpasses-texas-vaccines-rcna256030)\n\n**Measles Resurgence in the U.S.: Elimination Status at Risk**\nThe United States is facing its worst measles resurgence since being declared eliminated in 2000, with 2,255 confirmed cases reported across 45 states in 2025\u2014exceeding the previous peak from 2019. Nearly 90% of cases were linked to identifiable outbreaks, and three deaths, including two children, marked the first measles-related fatalities in a decade. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines elimination as the interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months after the last indigenous case. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) will reassess the U.S. elimination status in April 2026, evaluating whether sustained endemic transmission of identical virus genotypes occurred for at least 12 months. A potential loss of elimination status would signal systemic weaknesses in vaccination programs, surveillance, and crisis communication, despite having no immediate legal consequences. The outbreak originated in the U.S. Southwest, particularly Texas, which reported over 700 cases, with genetically related strains spreading to other states. By January 2026, 416 additional cases were documented, mostly continuing from 2025 outbreaks. Over 90% of infected individuals were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, with children and adolescents disproportionately affected and hospitalization rates significantly higher than in adults. Nationally, MMR vaccination coverage among kindergarten-aged children dropped from over 95% (2019/2020) to approximately 92.5% in the 2024/2025 school year\u2014below the threshold needed for herd immunity. Regional clusters with even lower vaccination rates have emerged, increasing the risk of prolonged outbreaks when the virus is reintroduced, often via travelers. Political, social, and public health communication factors\u2014including rising vaccine skepticism and inconsistent messaging\u2014have eroded trust in immunization. Public health experts warn that without rapid stabilization of vaccination rates, targeted catch-up campaigns, and strict outbreak control, a return to endemic measles transmission in the U.S. is a realistic risk, posing significant health and economic consequences.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Pharmazeutische Zeitung](https://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/eliminationsstatus-der-usa-in-gefahr-162288/)\n\n**WHO Reports Reestablishment of Endemic Measles Transmission in Spain**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has officially notified Spain that endemic transmission of measles has been reestablished, following data analysis from 2024 by the Regional European Verification Committee for Measles and Rubella (CRV). Spain reported 227 confirmed measles cases in 2024 and 397 by December 28, 2025, with a significant proportion linked to unvaccinated individuals and imported infections. The CRV concluded that available data do not allow exclusion of sustained transmission during 2024, leading to the loss of Spain\u2019s previously certified elimination status, which was achieved in 2016 after 36 months without endemic spread. Spain is now updating its Strategic Plan for Measles and Rubella Elimination to strengthen surveillance, increase vaccination coverage, and ensure coordinated responses across health administration levels. Other countries that have reverted to endemic transmission include Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and the UK. Globally, measles persists in 13 European countries, with France, Germany, and Italy shifting from interrupted to sustained transmission. In 2024, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 35,212 cases in the EU/EEA, up from 3,973 in 2023. In Spain, 30 outbreaks occurred across 12 autonomous communities in 2024, including one linked to low vaccination coverage in a child population that caused 52 cases over three months. National vaccination coverage reached 97.3% for the first dose and 93.8% for the second in 2024; of the 227 confirmed cases, 160 were unvaccinated and 7 had received only one dose. The Ministry of Health emphasized that effective herd immunity requires coverage above 95% for both doses. The 2018 seroprevalence study indicated high antibody levels in those born before 1978 due to natural exposure. In May 2025, the Ministry issued recommendations to boost protection, including maintaining coverage above 95%, targeting under-vaccinated groups, checking vaccination status during health visits\u2014especially before travel\u2014and promoting public awareness. Internationally, the Americas region lost its measles elimination certification in 2025 due to resurgence, reflecting a broader European and global increase in cases and outbreaks, which has slowed progress toward global elimination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:13 PM\nSource:[LaSexta](https://www.lasexta.com/tecnologia-tecnoxplora/sinc/oms-notifica-que-restablecido-transmision-endemica-sarampion-espana_202601276978c806f21351044daa7453.html)\n\n**US measles outbreak gives \"real world\" data on the unvaccinated, CDC vaccine chair says, as he questions polio jab**\nKirk Milhoan, the new head of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stated that the ongoing measles outbreak in the United States offers real-world data on the effects of the disease among unvaccinated individuals. Speaking on the podcast *Why Should I Trust You?*, Milhoan emphasized that the outbreak\u2014where 75-80% of cases are among unvaccinated people\u2014provides updated insights into hospitalizations and fatalities. He also questioned the logic of the polio vaccine and advocated for vaccination to be a personal choice, suggesting that public health decisions should reflect individual autonomy rather than mandates. The comments were made on January 27, 2026, according to the British Medical Journal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s175)\n\n**As US Is Poised To Lose Measles-Free Status, RFK Jr.\u2019s New CDC Deputy Downplays Its Significance**\nThe United States is on the verge of losing its measles-free status after more than 2,400 cases were reported in 2025, including 80 cases and one death in Gaines County, Texas, with outbreaks spreading to South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Mexico. Despite the high case count, the newly appointed principal deputy director of the CDC, Ralph Abraham, downplayed the significance, stating that the loss of elimination status is 'just the cost of doing business' due to porous borders and personal freedom to choose not to vaccinate. However, only about 10% of cases since January 20, 2025, were linked to international travel; the vast majority were domestically acquired. The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000 due to high vaccination rates, but vaccine exemptions for kindergartners reached a record 138,000 in the 2024\u201325 school year, fueled by loosened state requirements and misinformation from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted debunked claims linking vaccines to autism and other harms. The CDC is analyzing full measles virus genomes\u2014approximately 16,000 genetic letters\u2014to determine whether outbreaks are linked domestically or from abroad, with results expected in a few months. The Pan American Health Organization will decide on the U.S. status based on whether the virus circulated continuously for a year (January 20, 2025 \u2013 January 20, 2026). Experts like pediatrician Paul Offit and epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo criticized the administration\u2019s focus on genetic technicalities, calling it a distraction from stopping outbreaks. Offit emphasized that measles was eliminated in 2000 and that three deaths occurred in 2024 alone. Former CDC official Demetre Daskalakis predicted political appointees would either credit Kennedy for preserving the status or downplay the loss if outbreaks were linked domestically. The CDC has since stepped up support, including providing vaccines and funding, such as $1.5 million to South Carolina, which reported 646 cases by January 20, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Oklahoma Voice](https://oklahomavoice.com/2026/01/26/as-us-is-poised-to-lose-measles-free-status-rfk-jr-s-new-cdc-deputy-downplays-its-significance/)\n\n**Measles Is Back: Global Resurgence Challenges Herd Immunity**\nThe measles virus, once thought eradicated in much of the developed world due to widespread vaccination campaigns, has made a significant global resurgence, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2024, the WHO European Region reported 127,350 measles cases\u2014more than double the 2023 figure and the highest since 1997. Cases increased by 47% compared to pre-pandemic levels and by 86% in the Eastern Mediterranean region versus 2019. In the European Union, the ECDC recorded over 35,000 cases in 2024, a tenfold increase from the previous year, with more than half requiring hospitalization. In the United States, cases multiplied fivefold in months, rising from approximately 285\u2013300 in 2024 to over 1,500 projected for 2025, with 92% of infections occurring in unvaccinated individuals, particularly in communities with low immunization rates. In Spain, while the country has remained free of endemic measles since 2017, cases rose from 14 in 2023 to 229 in 2024, with projections nearing 400 in 2025. Most cases are imported, primarily from Morocco and Romania, and spark outbreaks in unvaccinated communities. Although Spain\u2019s first-dose vaccination coverage is 96\u201397%, the second-dose coverage drops to 91\u201393%, falling short of the WHO\u2019s 95% threshold for herd immunity. This gap, combined with anti-vaccine movements and post-COVID vaccination delays, has created vulnerable pockets allowing imported cases to trigger local outbreaks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:01 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/creiamos-que-sarampion-era-historia-datos-demuestran-que-estabamos-muy-equivocados)\n\n**Six Measles Cases Confirmed in Baja California in January, First National Death Reported in 2026**\nBaja California reported six new confirmed cases of measles in January 2026, bringing the cumulative total since December 4, 2025, to 27 cases.

Additionally, 98 probable cases have been recorded in the state. The first national death from measles in 2026 occurred in Michoac\u00e1n, the state from which the initial cases in Mexicali originated. Authorities confirmed that Baja California maintains control of the outbreak, with no school or urban workplace outbreaks, due to a 92% vaccination coverage in vulnerable populations. Vaccination efforts have been intensified in high-risk agricultural zones and communities, with free doses available at health centers, hospitals, and through home-based brigades.

Last year (2025), the U.S. reported 2,255 cases and nearly 50 outbreaks\u2014the worst since 1991\u2014resulting in three deaths, all among unvaccinated individuals, including two children in Texas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 08:20 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b)\n\n**Nearly 800 cases in South Carolina's record-breaking measles outbreak**\nSouth Carolina is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, with 789 confirmed cases as of January 27, 2026, following 89 new cases reported since the previous update. At least 557 individuals, including students from multiple schools, are currently in quarantine across the state. Nationally, the U.S. has recorded at least 416 confirmed measles cases in 2026, with the majority affecting individuals under 19 years old; approximately 2% of cases have required hospitalization. Dr. Kristin Moffitt, an infectious diseases physician at Boston Children's Hospital, expressed alarm over the surge, attributing it to declining vaccination rates. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first at 12\u201315 months and the second between 4 and 6 years\u2014providing 93% effectiveness with one dose and 97% with two. However, national MMR vaccination rates for kindergartners dropped to 92.5% in the 2024\u20132025 school year, down from 92.7% in 2023\u20132024 and 95.2% in 2019\u20132020. A collaborative map by ABC News, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard School of Medicine, and Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai reveals significant geographic disparities, with some ZIP codes classified as 'very high risk' (fewer than 60% of children under 5 vaccinated) and others as 'lowest risk' (85% or more vaccinated).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 08:01 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/800-cases-south-carolinas-record-breaking-measles-outbreak/story?id=129608461)\n\n**South Carolina measles outbreak reaches 789 cases, surpassing Texas**\nSouth Carolina's measles outbreak has reached 789 confirmed cases, surpassing the 762 cases reported in the 2025 West Texas outbreak, which resulted in two fatalities. The outbreak is primarily concentrated in Spartanburg County, with most cases involving unvaccinated individuals or those unaware of their vaccination status. Health officials reported 89 new cases since Friday, indicating the outbreak remains uncontrolled. A total of 557 people are in quarantine for 21 days. Cases have spread to California, North Carolina, and Washington, with 14 confirmed cases in North Carolina, including a cluster linked to Shining Light Baptist Academy in Union County, where only 60.1% of students are vaccinated. A child at the school, who was unvaccinated and contagious, triggered the quarantine of over 170 individuals. Dr. Deborah Greenhouse, a Columbia pediatrician, expressed sadness and emphasized that increasing vaccination rates and enforcing isolation/quarantine are essential to ending the outbreak. Most affected individuals are children and teenagers, and at least 23 schools in South Carolina have students in quarantine. The outbreak began in late September and accelerated during the holidays. The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status if the virus continues to circulate for a full year from a single source. In 2025, the U.S. recorded 2,255 measles cases\u2014the highest since 1991\u2014and 416 cases were confirmed nationwide in January 2026, with 93% of patients unvaccinated.

It surpassed the previous record of 762 cases in the 2025 Texas outbreak, which resulted in two deaths. In South Carolina, over 600 cases were reported in 2026 alone, with at least 18 hospitalizations and no deaths. Additionally, 557 individuals are in quarantine due to potential exposure, and exposures have been reported at 23 schools, including three new ones. Cases in North Carolina and Washington are linked to the South Carolina outbreak. Nationally, the US reported over 2,200 measles cases in 2025 and 416 confirmed cases by mid-January 2026, with at least 14 states affected. The Pan American Health Organization may revoke the US's elimination status during its April meeting. The CDC previously called elimination a 'historic public health achievement' due to vaccination. The measles vaccine, introduced in 1963 and widely used in combination with MMR since the 1970s, remains the most effective prevention method. However, CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Ralph Abraham, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, downplayed the significance of losing elimination status, stating, 'It's just the cost of doing business with our borders,' and emphasized personal freedom to choose not to vaccinate. The vast majority of South Carolina cases\u2014over 700\u2014involve unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals, particularly children. In Spartanburg County, the outbreak epicenter, only 90% of students were immunized in the 2024\u201325 school year, far below the 95% threshold needed to prevent spread. State health officials are responding with mobile vaccination clinics and urging unvaccinated individuals to get protected. The MMR vaccine is available at no cost through the Vaccines for Children program or health insurance, according to State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell, who emphasized, 'We strongly encourage those who are not protected to take advantage of the opportunity to get protected... to help us stop this outbreak and protect our communities.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:37 PM\nSource:[ABC17NEWS](https://abc17news.com/cnn-health/2026/01/27/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-is-largest-in-us-since-measles-was-declared-eliminated/)\n\n**Measles Resurgence in the U.S.: Elimination Status at Risk**\nThe United States is facing its worst measles resurgence since being declared eliminated in 2000, with 2,255 confirmed cases reported across 45 states in 2025\u2014exceeding the previous peak from 2019. Nearly 90% of cases were linked to identifiable outbreaks, and three deaths, including two children, marked the first measles-related fatalities in a decade. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines elimination as the interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months after the last indigenous case. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) will reassess the U.S. elimination status in April 2026, evaluating whether sustained endemic transmission of identical virus genotypes occurred for at least 12 months. A potential loss of elimination status would signal systemic weaknesses in vaccination programs, surveillance, and crisis communication, despite having no immediate legal consequences. The outbreak originated in the U.S. Southwest, particularly Texas, which reported over 700 cases, with genetically related strains spreading to other states. By January 2026, 416 additional cases were documented, mostly continuing from 2025 outbreaks. Over 90% of infected individuals were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, with children and adolescents disproportionately affected and hospitalization rates significantly higher than in adults. Nationally, MMR vaccination coverage among kindergarten-aged children dropped from over 95% (2019/2020) to approximately 92.5% in the 2024/2025 school year\u2014below the threshold needed for herd immunity. Regional clusters with even lower vaccination rates have emerged, increasing the risk of prolonged outbreaks when the virus is reintroduced, often via travelers. Political, social, and public health communication factors\u2014including rising vaccine skepticism and inconsistent messaging\u2014have eroded trust in immunization. Public health experts warn that without rapid stabilization of vaccination rates, targeted catch-up campaigns, and strict outbreak control, a return to endemic measles transmission in the U.S. is a realistic risk, posing significant health and economic consequences.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Pharmazeutische Zeitung](https://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/eliminationsstatus-der-usa-in-gefahr-162288/)\n\n**WHO Reports Reestablishment of Endemic Measles Transmission in Spain**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has officially notified Spain that endemic transmission of measles has been reestablished, following data analysis from 2024 by the Regional European Verification Committee for Measles and Rubella (CRV). Spain reported 227 confirmed measles cases in 2024 and 397 by December 28, 2025, with a significant proportion linked to unvaccinated individuals and imported infections. The CRV concluded that available data do not allow exclusion of sustained transmission during 2024, leading to the loss of Spain\u2019s previously certified elimination status, which was achieved in 2016 after 36 months without endemic spread. Spain is now updating its Strategic Plan for Measles and Rubella Elimination to strengthen surveillance, increase vaccination coverage, and ensure coordinated responses across health administration levels. Other countries that have reverted to endemic transmission include Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and the UK. Globally, measles persists in 13 European countries, with France, Germany, and Italy shifting from interrupted to sustained transmission. In 2024, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 35,212 cases in the EU/EEA, up from 3,973 in 2023. In Spain, 30 outbreaks occurred across 12 autonomous communities in 2024, including one linked to low vaccination coverage in a child population that caused 52 cases over three months. National vaccination coverage reached 97.3% for the first dose and 93.8% for the second in 2024; of the 227 confirmed cases, 160 were unvaccinated and 7 had received only one dose. The Ministry of Health emphasized that effective herd immunity requires coverage above 95% for both doses. The 2018 seroprevalence study indicated high antibody levels in those born before 1978 due to natural exposure. In May 2025, the Ministry issued recommendations to boost protection, including maintaining coverage above 95%, targeting under-vaccinated groups, checking vaccination status during health visits\u2014especially before travel\u2014and promoting public awareness. Internationally, the Americas region lost its measles elimination certification in 2025 due to resurgence, reflecting a broader European and global increase in cases and outbreaks, which has slowed progress toward global elimination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:13 PM\nSource:[LaSexta](https://www.lasexta.com/tecnologia-tecnoxplora/sinc/oms-notifica-que-restablecido-transmision-endemica-sarampion-espana_202601276978c806f21351044daa7453.html)\n\n**US measles outbreak gives \"real world\" data on the unvaccinated, CDC vaccine chair says, as he questions polio jab**\nKirk Milhoan, the new head of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stated that the ongoing measles outbreak in the United States offers real-world data on the effects of the disease among unvaccinated individuals. Speaking on the podcast *Why Should I Trust You?*, Milhoan emphasized that the outbreak\u2014where 75-80% of cases are among unvaccinated people\u2014provides updated insights into hospitalizations and fatalities. He also questioned the logic of the polio vaccine and advocated for vaccination to be a personal choice, suggesting that public health decisions should reflect individual autonomy rather than mandates. The comments were made on January 27, 2026, according to the British Medical Journal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s175)\n\n**As US Is Poised To Lose Measles-Free Status, RFK Jr.\u2019s New CDC Deputy Downplays Its Significance**\nThe United States is on the verge of losing its measles-free status after more than 2,400 cases were reported in 2025, including 80 cases and one death in Gaines County, Texas, with outbreaks spreading to South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Mexico. Despite the high case count, the newly appointed principal deputy director of the CDC, Ralph Abraham, downplayed the significance, stating that the loss of elimination status is 'just the cost of doing business' due to porous borders and personal freedom to choose not to vaccinate. However, only about 10% of cases since January 20, 2025, were linked to international travel; the vast majority were domestically acquired. The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000 due to high vaccination rates, but vaccine exemptions for kindergartners reached a record 138,000 in the 2024\u201325 school year, fueled by loosened state requirements and misinformation from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted debunked claims linking vaccines to autism and other harms. The CDC is analyzing full measles virus genomes\u2014approximately 16,000 genetic letters\u2014to determine whether outbreaks are linked domestically or from abroad, with results expected in a few months. The Pan American Health Organization will decide on the U.S. status based on whether the virus circulated continuously for a year (January 20, 2025 \u2013 January 20, 2026). Experts like pediatrician Paul Offit and epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo criticized the administration\u2019s focus on genetic technicalities, calling it a distraction from stopping outbreaks. Offit emphasized that measles was eliminated in 2000 and that three deaths occurred in 2024 alone. Former CDC official Demetre Daskalakis predicted political appointees would either credit Kennedy for preserving the status or downplay the loss if outbreaks were linked domestically. The CDC has since stepped up support, including providing vaccines and funding, such as $1.5 million to South Carolina, which reported 646 cases by January 20, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Oklahoma Voice](https://oklahomavoice.com/2026/01/26/as-us-is-poised-to-lose-measles-free-status-rfk-jr-s-new-cdc-deputy-downplays-its-significance/)\n\n**Measles Is Back: Global Resurgence Challenges Herd Immunity**\nThe measles virus, once thought eradicated in much of the developed world due to widespread vaccination campaigns, has made a significant global resurgence, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2024, the WHO European Region reported 127,350 measles cases\u2014more than double the 2023 figure and the highest since 1997. Cases increased by 47% compared to pre-pandemic levels and by 86% in the Eastern Mediterranean region versus 2019. In the European Union, the ECDC recorded over 35,000 cases in 2024, a tenfold increase from the previous year, with more than half requiring hospitalization. In the United States, cases multiplied fivefold in months, rising from approximately 285\u2013300 in 2024 to over 1,500 projected for 2025, with 92% of infections occurring in unvaccinated individuals, particularly in communities with low immunization rates. In Spain, while the country has remained free of endemic measles since 2017, cases rose from 14 in 2023 to 229 in 2024, with projections nearing 400 in 2025. Most cases are imported, primarily from Morocco and Romania, and spark outbreaks in unvaccinated communities. Although Spain\u2019s first-dose vaccination coverage is 96\u201397%, the second-dose coverage drops to 91\u201393%, falling short of the WHO\u2019s 95% threshold for herd immunity. This gap, combined with anti-vaccine movements and post-COVID vaccination delays, has created vulnerable pockets allowing imported cases to trigger local outbreaks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:01 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/creiamos-que-sarampion-era-historia-datos-demuestran-que-estabamos-muy-equivocados)\n\n**Six Measles Cases Confirmed in Baja California in January, First National Death Reported in 2026**\nBaja California reported six new confirmed cases of measles in January 2026, bringing the cumulative total since December 4, 2025, to 27 cases.

However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines measles elimination as the absence of endemic transmission for 12 months or more, not simply a low case total. The CDC will assess the U.S. elimination status in 2026, focusing on whether any outbreak chain persisted long enough to constitute endemic spread. Of the 2025 cases, 88% were outbreak-associated (defined as three or more related cases), indicating cluster-based transmission rather than widespread community spread. Only 24 cases were among international visitors, and the majority of cases occurred in unvaccinated school-aged children. The Texas DSHS documented a major outbreak in Gaines County starting in January 2025, involving 762 confirmed cases, 99 hospitalizations, and two deaths in children. The outbreak ended on August 18, 2025, after more than 42 days without new cases\u2014twice the maximum incubation period\u2014meeting public health criteria for closure. A similar case in Chicago in 2024 linked 57 cases to a migrant shelter, with a rapid vaccination response achieving 93% coverage. Despite public interest, key details such as the index patient, exposure setting, and imported-source classification are rarely published due to privacy and incomplete data. The debate over elimination hinges not on total case numbers, but on chain-level evidence of sustained transmission. Public health agencies can resolve the issue by releasing specific outbreak chain data, but such transparency remains limited.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 12:49 PM\nSource:[NewsBlaze News](https://newsblaze.com/usnews/health/measles-elimination-status_210948/)\n\n**South Carolina reports 124 new measles cases as outbreak grows**\nSouth Carolina reported 124 new measles cases between January 6 and January 13, 2026, raising the total outbreak count to 434 cases, with over 400 people currently in quarantine. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in Spartanburg County, began in early October 2025. In the same period, Georgia, Oregon, and Virginia reported their first measles cases of 2026. The United States recorded its highest number of measles cases since 1992, with 2,144 cases reported in 2025 across 44 states. Nearly 50 outbreaks occurred nationally in 2025, compared to 16 in 2024 and four in 2023, according to CDC data, with almost 90% of cases linked to outbreaks. At least three measles-related deaths were confirmed in 2025: two unvaccinated school-aged children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico\u2014the first U.S. measles deaths in a decade. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first at 12\u201315 months and the second between ages 4 and 6. Two doses are 97% effective, while one dose is 93% effective. In 2025, 93% of cases occurred among unvaccinated or undetermined-status individuals; 3% among those with one dose; and 4% among those with two doses. Vaccination rates have declined: during the 2024\u20132025 school year, 92.5% of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine, down from 92.7% in 2023\u20132024 and 95.2% in 2019\u20132020, before the pandemic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 06:48 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/south-carolina-reports-124-new-measles-cases-outbreak/story?id=129136137)\n\n**Will the U.S. Lose Its Measles Elimination Status in 2026?**\nThe United States may lose its measles elimination status by 2026, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which evaluates disease elimination in the Americas. Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 due to high vaccination rates, but recent outbreaks in Texas (760+ cases in January 2025), South Carolina (rising cases), and Utah/AZ (ongoing outbreak) threaten that status. PAHO determines elimination based on no local transmission of a strain for 12 consecutive months. Canada lost its elimination status in November 2024 after a multi-jurisdictional outbreak with over 5,000 cases, primarily affecting under-vaccinated communities. U.S. officials, including CDC\u2019s Jim O'Neill, stated there is currently no epidemiological evidence linking the Texas, South Carolina, and Utah/AZ outbreaks into a single transmission chain. Despite this, the U.S. reported over 2,000 measles cases in 2025\u2014the highest annual total since 1992 and the most since elimination\u201493% among unvaccinated or unknown-status individuals. The decline in vaccination rates and rising exemption rates are attributed to public skepticism, amplified by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who emphasizes 'the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.' Experts warn that measles is highly contagious\u2014up to 90% of unvaccinated people exposed will contract it\u2014and can lead to severe complications, especially in young children and immunocompromised individuals. Herd immunity requires 95% vaccination coverage, but only 92.5% of kindergarteners are currently vaccinated.

The cases were identified across different dates in December and prompted public alerts from state health departments in North Carolina, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Colorado, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of December 30, 2025, 2,065 measles cases had been reported nationwide, including 49 outbreaks and three deaths linked to complications. The virus, which spreads via airborne transmission and can remain active in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, poses a significant risk in crowded, enclosed spaces like airports. Most cases involved unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals. Authorities emphasized the importance of immediate reporting of suspected cases, followed by diagnostic testing including nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and blood analysis. State health departments issued detailed alerts specifying times and zones of potential exposure and recommended that travelers monitor for symptoms such as high fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and rash\u2014typically appearing 3\u20135 days after fever onset. The CDC and state agencies coordinated contact tracing through patient interviews, travel itinerary reviews, and collaboration with airport operators. The Department of Health of Massachusetts stated that exposure timelines are determined in coordination with other authorities, while Colorado advised travelers to avoid contact with others if symptoms appear. Health officials stressed the need for high vaccination coverage and robust surveillance at entry points. The CDC reiterated that vaccination remains the most effective tool to prevent measles and curb outbreaks, especially during periods of high mobility.

The CDC reports 49 separate outbreaks (defined as three or more linked cases), 11% of patients required hospitalization, and three deaths: an adult in New Mexico and two girls in Texas. The most affected states include Utah (125 cases, 21 in the last three weeks), Arizona (190 cases, primarily in Mohave County), and South Carolina (138 cases, mostly among unvaccinated individuals). In South Carolina\u2019s Spartanburg, 168 people, primarily schoolchildren, were placed on a 21-day quarantine, some extending through the Christmas holidays. The root cause is low vaccination coverage: only 90% of school-aged children are vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. This trend is widespread, with 67% of school districts reporting vaccination rates below the critical level. In the Utah-Arizona border region, 97% of cases involved unvaccinated individuals. Federal communication has declined significantly: CDC posted only 10 social media updates on measles from January to August 2025, compared to an average of 46 annually from 2021 to 2024. While the CDC claims to have distributed updated multilingual materials, most outbreak information now comes from local health departments, leading to fragmented response efforts. Experts warn that a virus nearly eradicated by 2000 is now circulating freely, exploiting gaps in decades of successful immunization. According to the CDC, 'the virus, which was nearly eliminated in the country by the year 2000, is now circulating freely, finding loopholes in the protection built over decades of successful vaccination.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 10:11 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/55786972-kor-bet-rekordy-ssha-okazalis-ne-sposobny-ostanovit-vspyshki-zabolevaniya/)\n\n**Outgoing outbreaks threaten U.S. measles-free status**\nThe United States faces the potential loss of its measles-free status due to ongoing outbreaks, with 1,723 lab-confirmed cases reported in 2024 and 16 small outbreaks identified by the CDC. The World Health Organization (WHO) removes a country's measles elimination designation if an outbreak persists for more than 12 months. The key threshold is the January 2025 anniversary of the initial Texas outbreak, which may determine whether the U.S. remains classified as measles-free. Canada lost its status earlier in 2024 after an outbreak linked to a Mennonite event in October 2024. A significant outbreak in Arizona and Utah, with over 180 cases combined, was initially reported to be genetically linked to the Texas outbreak, but the New York Times retracted that finding on Thursday, though the risk of sustained transmission remains. Most cases involve unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Utah has reported 87 confirmed cases, primarily in the southern region, with one breakthrough case in a vaccinated individual, likely due to intense exposure. Public health officials emphasize the importance of the MMR vaccine, which reduces severity even in breakthrough cases, and note a recent decline in vaccine uptake after an initial increase. Health authorities urge individuals with suspected measles to notify clinics in advance to prevent exposure. Measles is highly contagious, lingering in the air for up to two hours, and can lead to severe complications, including death (1\u20134 per 1,000 children) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (up to 11 per 100,000 survivors).

The state's health department attributes the rise to travel-related exposure within the U.S., with no confirmed cases among those old enough to be vaccinated. The outbreak follows a larger Texas outbreak with 762 cases, 99 hospitalizations, and two deaths. Arizona has confirmed 59 cases, primarily in Mohave County, while Utah has reported 44 cases, mostly among unvaccinated youth, with five hospitalizations. The CDC reported 1,544 confirmed measles cases nationwide as of October 4, 2025, with only 21 linked to international visitors. If outbreaks continue through January 2026, the U.S. will lose its 25-year status of measles elimination. A recent NBC News investigation found that childhood vaccination rates have declined in over 75% of counties since 2019, and 67% of states lack sufficient MMR coverage for herd immunity. Public health officials emphasize that ending outbreaks requires either widespread vaccination or natural herd immunity, as seen in Texas, where the virus exhausted susceptible populations. Community education, including staying home when exposed, also played a key role in controlling the outbreak, according to Lubbock\u2019s public health director Katherine Wells. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 02:21 PM\nSource:[NBC 6 South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/health/measles-spreading-states-what-to-know/3701279/)\n\n**Researchers introduce tool featuring timely county-level US measles data, maps**\nResearchers from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) have released a new national data\u2011collection and reporting infrastructure that delivers near\u2011real\u2011time, county\u2011level measles case data starting in January\u202f2025. The system pulls data twice a week from state and local public\u2011health websites, dashboards, news releases and bulletins, and uses county\u2011specific protocols to harmonise heterogeneous reporting formats. The public dashboard shows national maps with county\u2011level cumulative and recent 2\u2011week case counts, a table summarising county and state data, and cumulative and weekly nationwide incidence curves for 2018\u20112025. It also displays state\u2011level curves for hard\u2011hit states such as Texas and nationwide vaccination status by age group.\n\nThe article notes that, as of mid\u2011August\u202f2025, 1,356 confirmed measles cases have been reported from 42 counties, the highest number of cases in the U.S. in more than three decades. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, over 90\u202f% of U.S. residents were infected by age 15, with 3\u20114\u202fmillion annual infections and about 48,000 hospital admissions. After the vaccine rollout, national efforts eliminated endemic measles in 2000. From 2000 to 2024, annual U.S. measles infections averaged less than 200, the authors wrote. 'The surge in measles cases since 2020 also coincides with declining vaccination coverage in the U.S., further increasing the risk of measles outbreaks and threatening the U.S.' current endemic elimination status.'\n\nThe authors argue that because measles outbreaks are often localized, national and state\u2011level data are insufficient; the new infrastructure provides timely, actionable situation awareness that can inform public\u2011health interventions and vaccination programs. 'By centralizing information from diverse jurisdictional reporting systems, this data collection and sharing infrastructure provides timely and actionable situation awareness for measles and may help to inform public health interventions and vaccination programs within communities as well as model more precise outbreak risk,' the authors wrote. 'The infrastructure was built upon established principles from JHU's COVID\u201119 tracking experience to standardize heterogeneous surveillance data while maintaining comprehensive coverage and data quality through systematic validation protocols,' they added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/researchers-introduce-tool-featuring-timely-county-level-us-measles-data-maps)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
