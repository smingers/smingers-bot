infections in 14 states: CDC\"\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Total US cases (as of CDC Friday report):** 416 cases reported across 14 states\n- **States affected:** Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Washington\n- **International cases:** Only 3 cases (out of 416) were from international visitors\n- **Vaccination status of cases:**\n  - 94% are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status\n  - 3% received one MMR dose\n  - 3% received two MMR doses\n- **Age distribution:** Majority of cases occur among patients under 19 years old\n- **Hospitalization rate:** Approximately 2% of all measles patients have been hospitalized\n\n**South Carolina outbreak specifics:**\n- 54 new cases reported on Friday\n- Total cases in South Carolina: 700\n- Largest outbreak in the state in more than 30 years\n- 485 people currently in quarantine\n- 10 people in isolation\n- Latest end of quarantine: February 14\n\n**Vaccination rates:**\n- 2024-2025 school year: 92.5% of kindergartners received MMR vaccine\n- 2023-2024 school year: 92.7%\n- 2019-2020 school year (pre-COVID): 95.2%\n\n**Vaccine effectiveness (per CDC):**\n- One dose: 93% effective\n- Two doses: 97% effective\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Dr. Kristin Moffitt** (infectious diseases physician, Boston Children's Hospital):\n- \"Very alarmed\" by the increase in measles cases over the last year or two\n- Concerned about current year already\n- Notes that exceeding 2,000 cases in the last year is \"indeed alarming\"\n- Attributes outbreak to declining vaccination rates: \"This is entirely due to declining vaccination rates\"\n- Warns that many counties are below the 95% vaccination threshold needed for herd immunity\n- Predicts: \"If these numbers continue to increase, we could see significant surges, and they will be very local surges in hospital admissions for measles and complications of the measles\"\n\n**Dr. Robert Frenck** (professor of pediatrics, division of infectious diseases, Cincinnati Children's Hospital):\n- Explains concern: \"As you have lower vaccination rates each year, you're gonna get a bigger and bigger population of people that are not immune, and so it's gonna increase your likelihood of having outbreaks\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- CDC recommends two MMR doses: first at 12-15 months, second at 4-6 years\n- A recent ABC News collaboration with researchers created a measles risk map showing wide variation in risk levels across US counties and ZIP codes, ranging from \"lowest risk\" (85%+ vaccination) to \"very high risk\" (fewer than 60% vaccination)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

CDC data and note vaccination coverage trends\nThe current evidence base is now strong enough to draft roughly two-thirds of the requested 26-row table, but additional retrieval is still required before a fully documented, publication-quality series of (1) U.S. measles case totals for calendar years 2000-2025 and (2) national 2-dose MMR kindergarten coverage for the same span can be delivered.  Below is an inventory of what is already in hand, what is still missing, and exactly where the remaining numbers can be obtained.\n\n1.  Annual measles case counts  \n   \u2022  Definitive CDC-posted figures are available for 2018-2025.  The \u201cMeasles \u2013 Cases and Outbreaks\u201d page (updated 23 Jan 2026) lists 382 (2018), 1 274 (2019), 13 (2020), 49 (2021), 121 (2022), 59 (2023), 285 (2024 \u2013 preliminary), and 2 255 (2025 \u2013 final) confirmed cases (CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page) [source].  \n   \u2022  For 2000-2017, no numeric values surfaced in the current search tranche.  However, two CDC-controlled resources are known from the snippets returned:  \n        \u2013 The historical \u201cCDC Yearly measles cases (1985-present)\u201d CSV cited in the Our World in Data metadata should contain the exact totals for 2000-2017 [Our World in Data measles dataset].  \n        \u2013 Individual year tables in the \u201cSummary of Notifiable Diseases\u201d / National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) reports carry the same numbers in PDF form (e.g., 2015 summary in MMWR 64(53); 2015 data table) [MMWR 64(53)].  \n   \u2022  Therefore, the gap is purely a retrieval gap, not a data-existence gap: 2000-2017 counts are known to be archived by CDC but have not yet been downloaded in this project cycle.\n\n2.  National kindergarten 2-dose MMR coverage  \n   \u2022  Complete, CDC-vetted percentages are already on hand for eleven school years: 2011-12 (94.8 %), 2013-14 (94.7 %), 2014-15 (94.0 %), 2015-16 (94.6 %), 2017-18 (94.3 %), 2019-20 (95.2 %), 2020-21 (~93 %), 2021-22 (~93 %), 2022-23 (93.1 %), 2023-24 (92.7 %), and 2024-25 (92.5 %) (MMWR kindergarten coverage reports for 2012-13 \u2192 2023-24; CDC Measles page narrative) [MMWR 68(41); MMWR 73(41); CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page].  \n   \u2022  Missing years: 2012-13, 2016-17, and the entire pre-2011 period.  \n        \u2013 2012-13 coverage is published in MMWR 62(30): 607-612 (Vaccination Coverage Among Children in Kindergarten \u2014 United States, 2012-13 School Year) but has not yet been extracted [MMWR 62(30)].  \n        \u2013 2016-17 coverage is in MMWR 67(40): 1115-1122 (Coverage With Selected Vaccines \u2026 2016-17 School Year), which has not yet been opened.  \n        \u2013 For 2000-01 through 2010-11, CDC did not publish nationally harmonized kindergarten coverage; the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) provides only 1-dose MMR at age 24 months, which is not equivalent to 2-dose coverage at school entry.  A decision is therefore needed: either (a) limit the coverage series to 2011-12 forward (when consistent 2-dose data begin) or (b) use NIS-Child as a proxy with a clear footnote that the metric differs.  The query asks to \u201cnote vaccination coverage trends,\u201d so option (a)\u2014presenting a consistent 2-dose trend from 2011-12 onward and explicitly stating that earlier national kindergarten data are unavailable\u2014meets the requirement and avoids mixing incompatible metrics.\n\n3.  Draft table contents (what can be produced today)  \n   Calendar year | Measles cases | Kindergarten 2-dose MMR coverage  \n   2018 \u2026 2025         | 382 \u2026 2 255 (see above) | 2019-20 school year 95.2 % through 2024-25 92.5 % (aligned to appropriate calendar years in footnotes)  \n   Earlier rows remain blank pending download of the historical CSV and two MMWR PDFs.\n\n4.  Observed trends supported by current data  \n   \u2022  Case resurgence: confirmed cases dropped from 1 274 in 2019 to 13 in pandemic-disrupted 2020, then climbed to 2 255 in 2025, the highest single-year total since U.S. elimination was declared in 2000 [CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page].  \n   \u2022  Coverage erosion: national kindergarten 2-dose MMR coverage declined from 95.2 % (2019-20 cohort) to 92.5 % (2024-25 cohort) [CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks narrative; MMWR 73(41)].  CDC notes that this 2.7-percentage-point drop leaves ~286 000 kindergartners unprotected in a single school year [CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page].  \n   \u2022  Temporal concordance: the sharpest spike in measles cases (2024-2025) follows four consecutive school years in which coverage stayed below the 95 % herd-immunity threshold.\n\n5.  Remaining information gaps and concrete retrieval steps  \n   a.  Case counts, 2000-2017: download \u201cCDC Yearly measles cases (1985-present)\u201d CSV referenced in the Our World in Data dataset metadata OR open the yearly NNDSS summary PDFs (especially 2000, 2016, 2017) and copy the measles totals.  \n   b.  Kindergarten coverage, 2012-13 and 2016-17: open MMWR 62(30) and MMWR 67(40) and extract the national 2-dose MMR percentages.  \n   c.  Decide on treatment of the pre-2011 era; if the table is to begin in 2000, include an explicit note such as: \u201cNational 2-dose coverage at school entry not reported by CDC before the 2011-12 school year.\u201d  \n   Once those four PDFs/CSVs are harvested, every blank cell in the 2000-2025 table can be populated, and the deliverable will satisfy the original query.\n\n6.  Conclusion and next actions  \n   \u2022  The measles case series for 2018-2025 and the kindergarten coverage series for 2011-12 \u2192 2024-25 are fully documented from CDC webpages and peer-reviewed MMWR articles.  \n   \u2022  The missing older information exists in publicly accessible CDC assets but has not yet been downloaded.  No additional primary research is needed\u2014only retrieval.  \n   \u2022  After filling those gaps, the final report should present (a) the 26-year measles case table, (b) the 14-year kindergarten coverage trend (with explanatory footnotes for earlier years), and (c) a succinct narrative linking the erosion of herd immunity to the post-pandemic resurgence of measles in the United States.\n\nBecause the outstanding items are straightforward document downloads rather than difficult-to-locate data, no new search queries are proposed at this stage.</Agent_report>\n"
