Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether a coding tool will release a BCI integration by Nov 2026 is to understand (1) the current state-of-the-art: have any IDEs, code editors, or dev-assist tools already shipped BCI support? (2) the pipeline of products—public road-maps, beta trials, research demos—that could mature into a commercial release within the next nine months. Relevant historical context therefore includes:  
• Any officially released or beta versions of VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, GitHub Copilot, Replit, etc., that accept neural input via consumer EEG headsets (e.g., NextMind, Emotiv, OpenBCI) or implant platforms (Neuralink, Synchron).  
• Academic or startup collaborations that have moved from lab demo to commercially downloadable plugin or SDK.  
• Regulatory approvals or funding rounds that explicitly mention forthcoming coding-tool integrations.  
Because the question is technical, not economic, no FRED data are necessary.

Search queries:
1. coding IDE brain computer interface plugin (Google)
2. neuralink code editor integration release (Google News)
3. Search for commercial or open-source code editors that have shipped or publicly beta-tested brain-computer interface support since 2023; include terms like “VS Code”, “JetBrains”, “GitHub Copilot”, “Replit”, “BCI SDK”, “EEG headset”, “released”, “plugin”, “extension”. Return press releases, GitHub repos, or product documentation showing availability to the public. (Agent)
