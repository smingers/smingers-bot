You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?

Question background:
[<u>Brain-computer interfaces</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between a human brain and an external device, typically by interpreting neural activity to control software or hardware. While BCIs have been largely explored for medical, gaming, and communication purposes, recent advances in neural decoding, wearable EEG devices, and implantable systems such as [<u>Neuralink</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) have increased interest in integrating brain signals with general computing tools. Both [<u>companies</u>](https://www.wired.com/story/neuralink-implant-first-human-patient-demonstration/) and [<u>research groups</u>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/) have demonstrated limited control of text editors or code environments through neural input.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
The question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 1, 2026, a publicly accessible coding tool releases an integration with brain-computer interface technology.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-13. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-13 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
