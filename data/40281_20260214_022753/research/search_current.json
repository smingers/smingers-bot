In a memo titled 'Building the Strongest Engines Inside and Outside Earth,' Musk confirmed a historic merger between SpaceX and xAI, with the combined entity valued at $1.25 trillion. This integration triggered a major internal shake-up: two key technical leaders, Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, resigned within 48 hours, leaving half of xAI\u2019s original 12 co-founders gone. Musk described the restructuring as an 'organismic evolution,' emphasizing the need to streamline operations for faster execution. Despite potential short-term technical disruption, the move aims to fully integrate SpaceX and xAI, enabling mutual access to technology and funding to build a closed-loop ecosystem. Post-restructuring, xAI is divided into four teams: Grok for real-time interaction, Imagine for video generation, Coding for automated programming, and the most ambitious 'Macrohard' team focused on developing a general-purpose digital agent capable of autonomously operating desktop software and complex workflows. Musk also plans to migrate AI compute power to near-Earth orbit, using SpaceX infrastructure to deploy a million-satellite constellation to create the world\u2019s first 'orbital data center' and a lunar data center. He argues Earth\u2019s energy resources are insufficient for AGI development, and only space\u2019s limitless solar energy and vacuum cooling can enable infinite compute scaling. The author views this as a high-leverage bet: SpaceX stabilizes xAI\u2019s cash flow, acts as a reliable energy provider, and leverages Starlink for connectivity; X platform supplies data; and xAI serves as the processing brain\u2014forming a vertically integrated 'brute-force aesthetic.' This closed-loop system could evolve into a technology empire transcending geographic and regulatory boundaries. If Macrohard succeeds in revolutionizing software interaction, xAI could become a paradigm-shifting force in computing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 12:11 AM\nSource:[\u5929\u6781\u7f51](https://wearable.yesky.com/162/337162.shtml)\n\n**AI\u2011Assisted Coding Assistants in 2026: How They Speed Up Development Without Writing Full Apps**\nBy 2026, AI-assisted coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT have become integral tools in software development workflows, focusing on generating AI-generated code snippets without full applications rather than building entire systems. These tools integrate into IDEs, terminals, and chat interfaces, offering inline completions, context-aware refactoring, and AI-powered debugging and refactoring that reduce setup time, automate repetitive tasks, and improve code quality. Studies from 2024\u20132026 indicate productivity gains of 20\u201340% for routine coding tasks, with teams reporting faster onboarding, reduced boilerplate, and up to a 30% decrease in defect rates. While these assistants do not replace human developers, they shift the developer\u2019s role toward system design, architecture, and quality control. A layered workflow combining GitHub Copilot for real-time IDE integration, Claude for deep reasoning, and ChatGPT for high-level design exploration enhances efficiency, cutting prototyping and refactoring time by roughly a third. Despite benefits, risks include hallucinated code, security vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and over-reliance, requiring strong code reviews, automated testing, and governance. The most effective teams treat AI output as a draft, not a final artifact. AI tools are not replacements for traditional debuggers or linters but complementary enhancements. The future of software work is shaped by AI as a force multiplier, accelerating development while preserving human ownership of intent, architecture, and decision-making.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[Tech Times](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/314589/20260213/aiassisted-coding-assistants-2026-how-they-speed-development-without-writing-full-apps.htm)\n\n**30,000 Nvidia Engineers Get Coding Tool Access In Push For Internal AI Use**\nNvidia has integrated OpenAI's Codex AI coding tool into the workflows of over 30,000 engineers, marking a major internal push for AI adoption.

Non-invasive BCIs, such as Tianjin University's 'Shengong -- Shenxing' exoskeleton and 'Shengong -- Shenji' hand rehabilitation devices, have enabled stroke and spinal injury patients to regain mobility and hand function, with over 3,000 patients served and consumer products like the Zhongdian Yunnao Guoxin BCI headband entering mass production. These devices use 'cloud-edge-end' intelligent architecture for applications in fatigue driving detection and focus training. For limb amputees, companies like Zhejiang Qiangnai Technology have developed non-invasive prosthetic hands that allow users to control finger movements via thought, restoring daily functions. Invasive BCIs, such as Peking University's 'BeiNao One' system with 128 channels, have enabled paralyzed patients like Xiao Rui to control robotic arms to drink water and regain hand function after six months of training. The system also prevents muscle atrophy through targeted stimulation. Experts emphasize that while both invasive and non-invasive BCIs show clear value in motor recovery and neurological treatment, challenges remain in signal stability, long-term biocompatibility, and implantation site selection. Clinical adoption is being accelerated through coordinated innovation among medical institutions, academia, industry, and research\u2014evidenced by the establishment of BCI clinical and translational wards at Beijing Tiantan Hospital and Tianjin's Huanghai Hospital. Policy support is growing: China's '14th Five-Year Plan' identifies BCI as a new growth point; the National Healthcare Security Administration has introduced the first national BCI medical service pricing in Hubei; the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a joint opinion to promote industrial innovation; and the National Medical Products Administration released the first standard for BCI medical device terminology and added implantable BCI devices to its priority review list in December 2025.

The updated management system, 'WinActor Manager on Cloud Ver.4.0,' introduces integration with AI agents via the 'Model Context Protocol (MCP),' a standardized interface. This allows AI agents to issue instructions that trigger automated PC operations based on pre-defined scenarios. For example, an AI agent can be instructed to 'analyze data and create a report'; it will then collect and analyze the necessary data, summarize key points, and instruct WinActor to automatically input the content into the appropriate format and transfer it to designated systems or documents. The update enables seamless AI integration without requiring additional development, reducing implementation costs while enabling advanced automation. According to the Japan Economic News, existing scenarios can be used directly, allowing organizations to achieve sophisticated automation with minimal investment.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 02:54 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC121J00S6A210C2000000/)\n\n**Brain-Computer Interfaces Accelerate Clinical Integration for Health Innovation**\nBrain-computer interface (BCI) technology is rapidly advancing from science fiction to clinical applications, offering new hope for patients with neurological impairments.

Consumer products like the Zhongdian Yunnao Guoxin BCI smart headset are already in mass production, used for fatigue driving alerts and focus training. For amputees, non-invasive prosthetic hands developed by Zhejiang Qiangnai Technology allow users to control five fingers via thought, enabling daily tasks like typing, cooking, and lifting weights. Meanwhile, invasive BCIs, such as the 'BeiNao One' system developed by Peking University First Hospital, have enabled a 30-year-old quadriplegic patient to drink water using a robotic arm controlled by brain signals. The 128-channel system, with world-class signal processing, has been implanted in six patients, restoring motor and speech functions. Experts like Dr. Cao Yong from Beijing Tiantan Hospital emphasize that while invasive BCIs offer superior signal quality, they require surgery and face challenges in long-term stability and biocompatibility. Despite progress, key bottlenecks remain: reliable long-term signal acquisition, optimal implantation targets, and tissue compatibility. To address these, China is fostering a collaborative innovation ecosystem involving hospitals, industry, academia, and research institutions. In 2025, Beijing Tiantan Hospital launched a BCI clinical and translational ward, and Tianjin University partnered with Huanhu Hospital to build a comprehensive clinical trial facility. Policy support is accelerating: in March 2025, Hubei Province introduced the first national BCI medical service pricing; in April, the National Healthcare Security Administration included BCI in its reimbursement guidelines; in July, seven ministries issued a joint opinion promoting BCI innovation; in September, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) released standardized terminology; and in December, implanted BCI devices were added to the priority review list for high-end medical devices.

Companies, universities, and governments are competing to develop brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that connect the human brain directly to computers, artificial intelligence, and digital devices. These implants use electrodes to record or stimulate brain activity, translating neural signals into digital actions such as moving a cursor, typing, or controlling prosthetics. While the concept once seemed science fiction, decades of progress in miniaturized electronics, artificial intelligence, and biocompatible materials now enable more precise signal interpretation. Currently, the primary application is medical: patients with paralysis have regained the ability to control computers or communicate through thought, with some users navigating the internet or playing video games using only brain activity. Researchers have also made advances in decoding 'internal speech'\u2014thoughts that are not spoken aloud\u2014offering potential for people with ALS or severe brain injuries. Immediate industry focus includes restoring speech and mobility, controlling robotic prosthetics, treating neurological and psychiatric disorders, and partially restoring vision via brain stimulation. Looking ahead, future generations may shift from medical repair to neuroaugmentation\u2014enhancing human capabilities such as memory, concentration, or direct interaction with AI. However, experts warn that implantation in healthy individuals remains premature due to unresolved questions about long-term psychological effects, personal identity, and safety. Key technological challenges include biocompatibility (to prevent inflammation or degradation), signal precision (due to the brain's complex and variable electrical activity), surgical invasiveness (though less invasive methods are being developed), and long-term dependency on manufacturers for maintenance and updates. Ethical concerns are central: who controls brain data? Risks include unauthorized access, manipulation of emotions or decisions, social inequality between implanted and non-implanted individuals, and threats to personal autonomy. International bodies are already working on 'mental privacy' regulations to prevent misuse. Some bioethicists call for temporary moratoriums on non-medical implants until deeper understanding is achieved. Mass adoption is not imminent. Expected progression includes: specialized medical use in the current decade, safer and less invasive interfaces in the next, and potential everyday integration with digital systems\u2014provided technical and ethical barriers are overcome.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[NCYT Amazings](https://noticiasdelaciencia.com/art/56165/implantes-neuronales-el-futuro-que-conectara-el-cerebro-humano-con-la-tecnologia)\n\n**This Chinese Computer Can Read Your Mind -- No Implant Required**\nA Chinese startup named Gestala has emerged in Chengdu, claiming to develop a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) using ultrasound technology to read brain states without requiring implants. According to Phoenix Peng, Gestala's CEO, ultrasound can potentially access the entire brain, unlike electrical BCIs that only record from specific regions like the motor cortex. While ultrasound is traditionally used for imaging and can deliver focused therapeutic stimulation (e.g., for Parkinson\u2019s disease), using it to extract accurate brain data via blood flow remains unproven due to skull-induced distortion of ultrasonic waves. This challenge limits the current fidelity of such systems. Meanwhile, in September 2025, UCLA researchers demonstrated a breakthrough using EEG combined with artificial intelligence to translate brain signals into movements using only a brain cap\u2014no surgery required. Jonathan Kao, a lead researcher, emphasized the goal of developing AI-BCI systems with shared autonomy to restore independence for individuals with paralysis or ALS. Although invasive BCIs like Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink have made progress, non-invasive alternatives\u2014especially those using AI-enhanced EEG and ultrasound\u2014are gaining attention, with OpenAI investing in Merge Labs, a similar startup. The future of human-machine integration remains uncertain, with both implant-based and non-invasive technologies still in development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a70196630/bci-ultrasound/)\n\n**Sina Brain-Computer Interface Hot Hour Report | February 12, 2026, 19:00 \u2013 Real-Time Updates on BCI Market Trends**\nOn February 12, 2026, multiple Chinese stocks related to brain-computer interface (BCI) technology showed varied performance.\u65b0\u534e\u533b\u7597 (Xinhua Medical) fell 0.90% with a trading volume of 105 million yuan, recording a net inflow of -12.5 million yuan by institutional investors.

The tool features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a 'pick-and-place' flowchart system, allowing researchers to visually build custom BCI pipelines by dragging and dropping instruction cards\u2014such as 'Filter the Signal' or 'Identify Key Channels'\u2014without writing code. This approach lowers the barrier to entry for neuroscientists, clinicians, and non-programmers, enabling rapid prototyping of personalized BCIs tailored to individual neural patterns. The framework supports real-time EEG data processing, channel selection, preprocessing, and stimuli generation, as demonstrated in pseudo live-streams showing raw and filtered EEG signals. PyNoetic is modular, promoting collaboration and future expansion through community contributions. It addresses two major challenges in BCI development: the need for individualized systems due to the brain's complexity and the high technical and financial barriers posed by existing platforms. The developers, Gursimran Singh and Aviral Chharia, emphasize that PyNoetic is a foundational step toward accelerating innovation in BCI research and bringing thought-controlled technology closer to clinical and real-world use. The framework was published in PLOS One on October 2, 2025, with the DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0327791.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[medicalxpress.com](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-braincomputer-interfaces-easier-lego.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
