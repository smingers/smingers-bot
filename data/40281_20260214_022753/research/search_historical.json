He showed he could play online chess and the video game Civilization using the Neuralink device.\n\n- **How It Works:** Arbaugh described the learning process: \"I would attempt to move, say, my right hand left, right, forward, back, and from there I think it just became intuitive for me to start imagining the cursor moving.\"\n\n## Technical and Regulatory Details\n\n- **Device Description:** The implant is surgically placed in the brain using a Neuralink-developed robot and is cosmetically invisible once implanted. Software analyzes brain signals and translates them into commands to control external devices.\n\n- **FDA Status:** Neuralink received FDA approval for human trials in 2023 and began recruiting paralyzed participants in fall 2023. No brain-computer interface has been FDA-approved for commercial use yet; all remain experimental.\n\n- **Timeline:** Musk announced in January 2024 that the first human received the implant and was \"recovering well.\" In February 2024, he stated the patient could control a computer mouse with their thoughts.\n\n## Safety and Recovery\n\n- **Patient Recovery:** Arbaugh reported the surgery was \"super easy\" and he was released from the hospital one day later, with no cognitive impairments.\n\n- **Ongoing Development:** Arbaugh acknowledged issues with the device, stating \"I don't want people to think that this is the end of the journey. There's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\n## Criticisms and Controversies (Named Sources)\n\n- **Transparency Concerns:** Some neuroscientists and ethicists have criticized Neuralink's lack of transparency. The company has not revealed the number of study subjects, trial sites, or assessed outcomes, and has not registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n- **Animal Testing:** A WIRED investigation in 2023 detailed how some monkeys died as a result of Neuralink's brain implant testing.\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n- **Synchron:** Competitor company developing a stent-like device inserted via the jugular vein. Implanted its first subject in 2019 and has demonstrated safety, enabling paralyzed people to browse the web and perform online shopping and banking.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"A Brain Controlled Command-Line Interface to Enhance the Accessibility of Severe Motor Disabled People to Personnel Computer\"\n\n**Source:** PMC (PubMed Central) / NCBI\n\n## Key Facts and Objective Measurements:\n\n1. **System Performance:**\n   - The proposed BCI system achieved an **average accuracy of 94.5%** in offline testing\n   - In online evaluation, the system achieved **97% accuracy for some users** and **not less than 90% for others**\n   - These results **outperformed the winners of the BCI competition**\n\n2. **Technical Approach:**\n   - The system uses **P300 responses** - positive deflections in EEG signals that occur approximately **300 milliseconds after external visual stimuli**\n   - Uses **Electroencephalography (EEG) signals** to control operating system functionalities\n   - Employs a **Row/Column paradigm (RCP)** with a **6x6 character matrix** for the P300-speller interface\n\n3. **System Capabilities:**\n   - Controls operating system through a **command-line interface (CLI)**\n   - Enables file system management (creating, deleting, renaming, moving, copying files)\n   - Allows disk driver activities and system configuration\n   - Provides process management capabilities\n   - Includes mouse controller and virtual keyboard functionality\n   - Features an **auto-complete function** to reduce typing effort and system latency\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - System implemented using **Java and C++** programming languages\n   - Architecture comprises two subsystems: command-line interface and data acquisition system\n   - Includes graphical user interface (GUI) with three main components: P300-Speller command matrix, input area, and feedback area\n\n## Context:\n\n- The paper describes a research system designed to help people with severe motor disabilities control personal computers using brain signals\n- The system translates brain activity into computer commands without requiring muscular effort\n- The research acknowledges that offline performance typically decreases when implemented online, though their system maintained high accuracy in both approaches\n\n## Note on Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis appears to be an **academic research paper** demonstrating a proof-of-concept BCI system for controlling operating system functions, including command-line interfaces (a coding-related tool).

Return press releases, GitHub repos, or product documentation showing availability to the public.\nObjective recap  \nThe query asked whether any commercial or open-source code editor (e.g., VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Replit, GitHub-hosted projects, etc.) has actually shipped or run a public beta of brain\u2013computer-interface (BCI) support at any time since 1 January 2023, and to surface concrete evidence such as press releases, product documentation, Marketplace / Plugin listings, or public GitHub repositories that make such functionality available to outside users.\n\nWhat the searches returned  \n\n1. No press releases, announcements, or product-page documentation from Microsoft (VS Code, Visual Studio), JetBrains (any 2023\u20132025 IDE releases), GitHub (Copilot or Codespaces), nor Replit mention EEG headsets, BCIs, neural implants, or OpenBCI integration. The JetBrains AI Assistant posts from April 2024 and November 2024 describe only LLM-powered features (inline completion, chat, etc.) without any neural-signal input path (JetBrains Blog, 4 Apr 2024; JetBrains AI Blog, 13 Nov 2024).  \n\n2. The GitHub repositories surfaced with the string \u201cbrain\u201d in their names (e.g., jmoyers/brain, bbci/wyrm, Sentdex/BCI) are general-purpose note-taking or BCI research toolkits. None provide an extension that plugs EEG or other neural data streams into a mainstream source-code editor. Their READMEs describe data analysis pipelines or generic Python toolboxes, not editor integrations (GitHub jmoyers/brain; GitHub Sentdex/BCI; GitHub bbci/wyrm).  \n\n3. A Reddit post (Jan 2026) describes an in-progress Clojure wrapper around the BrainFlow SDK and a personal demo (Pong game). The author states that the \u201cgame and extension aren\u2019t ready for release just yet\u201d and gives no indication of integration with a code editor; it is an SDK convenience layer, not an IDE plugin (Reddit r/Clojure, \u201cWorking towards BCI \u2026\u201d).  \n\n4. Consumer-oriented articles about \u201csilly VS Code extensions\u201d (XDA, 24 Aug 2025) list gamified or cosmetic plug-ins (Pets, Pok\u00e9mon, Rainbow Fart) and likewise make no mention of neural input.  \n\n5. No GitHub Marketplace, VS Code Marketplace, or JetBrains Marketplace entry appears in the result set for keywords like \u201cEEG,\u201d \u201cOpenBCI,\u201d \u201cBrainFlow,\u201d or \u201cBCI\u201d dated 2023-2026.  \n\nSynthesis of findings  \n\u2022 Among the major developer-tools vendors (Microsoft, JetBrains, GitHub, Replit) there is zero public evidence of BCI integrations having shipped, entered public preview, or even been announced in their official channels since 2023.  \n\u2022 Open-source BCI communities (e.g., NeuroTechX, OpenBCI) continue to publish data sets, signal-processing libraries, and hobby projects, but these do not constitute integrations into code-editing environments.  \n\u2022 The only BCI-related code-editing demonstrations that exist remain research prototypes from the 2010s \u2013 early 2020s (e.g., academic papers on typing via SSVEP or P300 interfaces). None transitioned into a maintained plugin for a mainstream editor, and none surfaced in the 2023-2026 search window.  \n\nTherefore, on the narrow criterion \u201cpublicly accessible coding tool releases an integration with BCI technology,\u201d the evidence collected so far is null: no qualifying release has occurred between 1 Jan 2023 and today (14 Feb 2026).\n\nRemaining information gaps  \nAlthough the broad web, GitHub, and news searches returned no qualifying hits, two blind spots remain:  \n\n1. Niche plugin marketplaces or personal blogs that might not rank highly on Google yet could still host a small-scale BCI-to-editor extension (for example, a VS Code extension published under an obscure publisher name that never drew media coverage).  \n2. Corporate R&D or hackathon projects that were demoed live (e.g., at Build, Ignite, DEF CON Biohacking Village) but whose source or binaries were not indexed by search engines.\n\nAdditional searching could target:  \n\u2022 The VS Code Marketplace API filtered by keywords EEG, OpenBCI, BrainFlow.  \n\u2022 JetBrains Marketplace search with identical keywords.  \n\u2022 GitHub topic \u201cvscode-extension\u201d + \u201copenbci\u201d / \u201ceeg\u201d.  \n\u2022 Conference-talk repositories (e.g., slideslive, YouTube dev-conf channels) for \u201cBCI code editor demo.\u201d\n\nBecause marketplace APIs and topic searches can reveal low-visibility projects that generic Google queries miss, running those targeted searches would materially tighten the conclusion.\n\nConclusion  \nBased on all publicly indexed sources retrieved, there is NO evidence that any commercial or open-source code editor has shipped or even public-beta-tested BCI input since 2023. All located references deal either with AI text-generation assistants (LLMs) or with general BCI research libraries unaffiliated with an IDE. Unless future, deeper marketplace/API searches uncover an obscure release, the present state of evidence supports a negative answer to the original query.</Agent_report>\n"
