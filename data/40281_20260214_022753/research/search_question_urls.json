He showed he could play online chess and the video game Civilization using the Neuralink device.\n\n- **How It Works:** Arbaugh described the learning process: \"I would attempt to move, say, my right hand left, right, forward, back, and from there I think it just became intuitive for me to start imagining the cursor moving.\"\n\n## Technical and Regulatory Details\n\n- **Device Description:** The implant is surgically placed in the brain using a Neuralink-developed robot and is cosmetically invisible once implanted. Software analyzes brain signals and translates them into commands to control external devices.\n\n- **FDA Status:** Neuralink received FDA approval for human trials in 2023 and began recruiting paralyzed participants in fall 2023. No brain-computer interface has been FDA-approved for commercial use yet; all remain experimental.\n\n- **Timeline:** Musk announced in January 2024 that the first human received the implant and was \"recovering well.\" In February 2024, he stated the patient could control a computer mouse with their thoughts.\n\n## Safety and Recovery\n\n- **Patient Recovery:** Arbaugh reported the surgery was \"super easy\" and he was released from the hospital one day later, with no cognitive impairments.\n\n- **Ongoing Development:** Arbaugh acknowledged issues with the device, stating \"I don't want people to think that this is the end of the journey. There's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\n## Criticisms and Controversies (Named Sources)\n\n- **Transparency Concerns:** Some neuroscientists and ethicists have criticized Neuralink's lack of transparency. The company has not revealed the number of study subjects, trial sites, or assessed outcomes, and has not registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n- **Animal Testing:** A WIRED investigation in 2023 detailed how some monkeys died as a result of Neuralink's brain implant testing.\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n- **Synchron:** Competitor company developing a stent-like device inserted via the jugular vein. Implanted its first subject in 2019 and has demonstrated safety, enabling paralyzed people to browse the web and perform online shopping and banking.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"A Brain Controlled Command-Line Interface to Enhance the Accessibility of Severe Motor Disabled People to Personnel Computer\"\n\n**Source:** PMC (PubMed Central) / NCBI\n\n## Key Facts and Objective Measurements:\n\n1. **System Performance:**\n   - The proposed BCI system achieved an **average accuracy of 94.5%** in offline testing\n   - In online evaluation, the system achieved **97% accuracy for some users** and **not less than 90% for others**\n   - These results **outperformed the winners of the BCI competition**\n\n2. **Technical Approach:**\n   - The system uses **P300 responses** - positive deflections in EEG signals that occur approximately **300 milliseconds after external visual stimuli**\n   - Uses **Electroencephalography (EEG) signals** to control operating system functionalities\n   - Employs a **Row/Column paradigm (RCP)** with a **6x6 character matrix** for the P300-speller interface\n\n3. **System Capabilities:**\n   - Controls operating system through a **command-line interface (CLI)**\n   - Enables file system management (creating, deleting, renaming, moving, copying files)\n   - Allows disk driver activities and system configuration\n   - Provides process management capabilities\n   - Includes mouse controller and virtual keyboard functionality\n   - Features an **auto-complete function** to reduce typing effort and system latency\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - System implemented using **Java and C++** programming languages\n   - Architecture comprises two subsystems: command-line interface and data acquisition system\n   - Includes graphical user interface (GUI) with three main components: P300-Speller command matrix, input area, and feedback area\n\n## Context:\n\n- The paper describes a research system designed to help people with severe motor disabilities control personal computers using brain signals\n- The system translates brain activity into computer commands without requiring muscular effort\n- The research acknowledges that offline performance typically decreases when implemented online, though their system maintained high accuracy in both approaches\n\n## Note on Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis appears to be an **academic research paper** demonstrating a proof-of-concept BCI system for controlling operating system functions, including command-line interfaces (a coding-related tool). However, the article does not indicate this is a **publicly accessible commercial product** or integration with an existing coding tool - it appears to be a research prototype for assistive technology purposes.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
