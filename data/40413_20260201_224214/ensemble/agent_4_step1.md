Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. House History “Majority Changes” table (updated 2023).  Factual, official archival data on seat swings every election since 1858.  High‐quality, no opinions.  
2. Fox News poll 29 Jan 2026.  National live/online survey (n = 1 005, MoE ±3).  Gives D + 6 generic-ballot edge, motivation figures, and crosstabs.  Methodologically decent, transparently dated.  Commentary from network pollsters is labelled as opinion.  
3. Newsweek article 30 Dec 2025 summarising six national polls from Dec 2025.  All show D lead of 2-16 pts; Atlas Intel identified as outlier.  Mostly factual poll citations plus pundit quotes (opinions).  
4. RealClearPolling page – extraction empty: ignored for now.  
5. Corrupted UVM pdf – unusable: ignored.  
6. Agent_report (1 Feb 2026).  Synthetic but well-sourced memo compiling: current House math (217 R–214 D + 4 vacancies), special-election calendars, pending redistricting litigation, generic-ballot average (D + 4.8), historical swing conversion (D + 5 ⇒ ≈ 15-seat D gain) and central estimate (D + 10-12 seats).  Where citations are traceable (LA Times, ABC 7, FEC, etc.) the factual components seem credible; prose forecasting portions are expert opinion.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
i. All midterm House elections since WWII (19 cases).  Mean seat loss for president’s party: –26; SD 23.  Broad but includes first-term waves (1994, 2010) not fully applicable.  
ii. Second-midterm elections under two-term presidents (Eisenhower 1958, Reagan 1986, Clinton 1998, Obama 2014).  Mean loss for president’s party: –16; SD 15.  Small n=4 but closer analogy (Trump is in his second term).  
iii. Midterms with national generic-ballot 2-6 pts against the majority party at this point in cycle (2006, 2018, 2022).  Mean seat change: –32; SD 17.  Poll environment similar, but those were first midterms.  

Given context (second-term president, generic ballot mildly but not massively negative, razor-thin starting majority) reference class ii gets most weight, tempered by the generic-ballot translation work in the agent memo.

C. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in ≈ 10 months (275 days).  History shows generic-ballot margins six-to-nine months out already explain >50 % of eventual House vote share (Erikson & Wlezien “Timeline of Election Campaigns”).  Late swings of ≥5 pts have happened (1998, 2002, 2022 specials) but are uncommon; SD of generic-ballot movement from Feb to Nov is roughly 3 pts.

D. Justification for outside-view mean  
Starting point: R hold 217-214 effective edge (= R +3).  
Expected seat change using:  
• Generic ballot D + 4.8 ⇒ translate with 1 seat per 0.33 pt (Kastellec 2023 update) ⇒ –14 R.  
• Midterm penalty for second-term presidents: –12 R mean.  
Blend (weighted 60 % to polling, 40 % to historical penalty) ⇒ –13 R.  
Apply redistricting litigation central expectation (net 0) and special-election pre-November flips (–2 R).  
Central estimate November result ≈ current + (-13) = R +3 – 13 = D +10 → Republican disadvantage of –10 seats.

Uncertainty drivers and allowances  
• SCOTUS could erase CA Prop 50 (swing +4 R) or, conversely, VRA rulings could cost D up to –3 seats.  
• Generic-ballot could tighten or widen by ±4 pts → ±12 seats.  
• Idiosyncratic candidate failures, scandals, turnout shocks ≈ ±5 seats.  

Pooled (roughly normal, σ ≈ 13).  Two-sigma band ⇒ about ±26 seats around –10, but truncate mild right tail because GOP already near numeric ceiling after 2024.  Convert to percentiles below.

Outside view calibration:

Assume mean μ = –6 seats (slightly pulled toward zero from –10 to respect outside-view humility) and σ = 12 seats.  Draw percentiles from N(–6, 12²), then round to nearest even seat and trim extreme left tail where D lands >35-seat edge (historically rare absent wave).  Resulting CDF:

10th ≈ μ – 1.28σ = –6 –15 ≈ –21  
20th ≈ –6 –10 ≈ –16  
40th ≈ –6 –2 ≈ –8  
60th ≈ –6 + 2 ≈ –4  
80th ≈ –6 +10 ≈ 4  
90th ≈ –6 +15 ≈ 9

Rounded to integers that preserve monotonicity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: -20
Percentile 20: -16
Percentile 40: -8
Percentile 60: -4
Percentile 80: 4
Percentile 90: 9
