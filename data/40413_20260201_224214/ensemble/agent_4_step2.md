Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (quality | facts vs. opinion)

1. Ballotpedia (Jan 2026). High‐quality, purely factual seat counts, retirements, redistricting list.  
2. Cook Political Report ratings via 270toWin (15 Jan 2026). Reputable non-partisan handicapper; factual race ratings, but forward-looking judgments are expert opinion.  
3. Fox News/Beacon Research poll (field 23-26 Jan 2026). Methodology disclosed; single national data point (D +6 generic ballot). Interpretation that this is “wave territory” is opinion.  
4. Emerson College poll (22 Jan 2026). Credibility interval ±3 pp; shows D +6 generic ballot and large Democratic edge among independents; early-season likely-voter screen.  
5. CNN/SSRS poll (18 Jan 2026). National sample; finds clear Democratic ballot edge and very low Trump/​congressional approval.  
6. Special-election news bundle (1 Feb 2026). Multiple independent outlets report TX-18 result shrinking GOP to 218-214 with four vacancies; purely factual tallies.  
7. AskNews compendium articles (Oct 2025 – Feb 2026). Quality varies; I leaned on pieces quoting Harry Enten (CNN) and Doug Schoen (The Hill) because they supply numeric probabilities or seat arithmetic; treated punditry without data as weak opinion.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting)

• Midterm penalty for president’s party (modern era, 8 midterms): average swing ≈ -18 seats against WH party. Strong.  
• Current generic ballot average ~D +5 (five independent polls, Jan 2026). Moderate–strong; early but consistent.  
• House now 218 R, 214 D, 3 vacant (two R, one D). Strong, directly affects starting point.  
• Retirements: 28 R vs 21 D. Moderate; open seats historically 3-4 pp likelier to flip.  
• Mid-decade redistricting estimated net +5 R. Moderate; structural and already law in TX, MO, NC, OH but partly offset by CA, UT.  
• Special-election/​off-year over-performance: D +7 average vs district partisanship (Fry’s tracker, 2025-26). Moderate; hints at enthusiasm but sample <20 races.  
• Economic dissatisfaction (majority say “worse off”, wrong-track 56 %). Weak–moderate; hurts incumbents (Republicans) but can shift with economy.  
• Trump net approval -18; historically correlates ~0.4 seats per approval point. Moderate; approval moves can occur before November.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Nine months until Election Day; ten to resolution.  
• If timeframe were halved (early Aug), generic ballot would have ~70 % of its eventual explanatory power; I would narrow my 80 % interval by ~25 %.  
• If doubled (Feb 2027), final count fixed—uncertainty collapses to recount/​contest risk only.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments

Outside-view anchor: modern-era midterms against president’s party => expect ≈ -18 R seat change from present edge of +4 => baseline Democratic advantage of about 14 seats (R adv = -14).

Inside-view pulls that baseline back toward center:

1. Fewer competitive seats now (Cook lists 42 battlegrounds vs 90 + in 2018). Reduces likely swing magnitude.  
2. Redistricting gains worth ≈ 5 R seats.  
3. Current generic ballot lead is sizable but could narrow; 2018 Dems gained ~4 pp between Feb and Nov, 2022 GOP lost ~3 pp. Assume Democrats add +1 pp on average → seat shift of ~ -3 R.  
4. Retirement imbalance worth roughly -2 R.  
5. Special-election over-performance suggests turnout/​enthusiasm edge → add -3 R.

Net expected GOP-minus-Dem margin = 4 current – 14 base swing + 5 map + 3 generic narrowing + 2 retirements +3 enthusiasm ≈ -5 seats.

Uncertainty: high. I allocate 80 % of probability to the interval -18 to +14, with fat tails for a wave (2006/2010/2018 style) or a Republican rebound (1998/2002 style).

Probability calibration

Implied median = –5; mean ≈ –4. Does this align with evidence? Yes: Cook toss-ups split 60-40 toward Democrats would yield roughly –4.7. Tails cover ±30 where sudden economic spike or national crisis could reverse or amplify trend.

Checklist (abridged)

1. Target: GOP seats – Dem seats in House elected Nov 2026, resolved by 1 Dec 2026.  
2. Outside-view base = –14.  
3. Median –5; mean –4; consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) generic ballot D +5-6, b) presidential approval –18, c) redistricting net +5 R, d) current 218-214 House, e) retirement gap 28 R-21 D.  
5. Blind spot: sharp economic boom by late summer lifting Trump to net –5 approval could drive GOP turnout up, pushing result to +15 R.
