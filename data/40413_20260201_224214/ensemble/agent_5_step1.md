Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. House History “Majority Changes” (updated 2023).  
   • Purely factual table of every House turnover since 1858.  
   • Strength: clean, official data; no opinion.  
   • Limitation: stops at 2022—does not cover the 2024 election or any 2025-26 developments.

2. Fox News poll, 29 Jan 2026.  
   • National live/online poll, 1 005 registered voters, MoE ±3 pp.  
   • Key fact: D +6 generic-ballot lead (52 – 46).  
   • Quality: major network, bipartisan team (Beacon / Shaw & Associates). Poll is recent (3 days old). Opinion content is clearly separated from numbers.

3. Newsweek round-up, 30 Dec 2025.  
   • Collates six late-2025 national generic-ballot polls (range D +2 to D +16, median ≈ D +4).  
   • Adds partisan commentary by strategists; I treat those as opinion, not data.  
   • Quality of numbers good (all reputable pollsters); article itself adds no methodology beyond what polls provide.

4. RealClearPolling scrape (incomplete).  
   • No usable figures extracted—ignored for quantitative work.

5. Agent report, 1 Feb 2026.  
   • Synthesises hard data on current seat count (217 R – 213 D, 5 vacancies), special-election calendars, litigation and generic-ballot average (RCP = D +4.8).  
   • Flags map litigation risks and translates generic ballot to an expected ≈ 15-seat swing.  
   • Quality: not public journalism, but internally consistent, date-stamped and sources cited. Treated as a well-informed analyst note; still cross-checked against public facts.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes:  
1. All midterms since 1862 (too heterogeneous: party system, electorate and maps have changed).  
2. Post-World-War-II second-term midterms (1950, 1958, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2014).  
3. Modern era (1994–2022) midterms with presidential approval < 45 % and generic ballot ≥ ±3 pp in one direction (1994, 2006, 2010, 2018, 2022).  

Class 2 best matches 2026: it is the president’s second midterm, and the chamber is closely divided. In that set the president’s party lost 18, 13, 43, 5, 30 and 13 seats respectively—mean loss 20, median loss 15. I down-weight the Watergate outlier (-43) to get an adjusted mean of about 17 seats.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

• Days to election: 278 (≈ 9 months).  
• Generic-ballot polls nine months out correlate only modestly with the final House vote (r ≈ 0.55 post-1994) and tend to tighten by early autumn. Error historically ±5 pp one sigma, equivalent to ±15 seats.  
• Special elections between now and June could move the narrative but only supply 3-4 actual seats.

(d) Justification of baseline (outside view)  

1. Start with reference-class average: president’s party loses 17 seats → converts current raw +4 R edge into a -13 R (i.e., D +13) advantage.  
2. Generic-ballot today is D +5. Regression models (Erikson-Wlezien) imply roughly 2.5 seats per point → expected loss 12-13 seats, consistent with step 1.  
3. Map changes roughly net to zero: +4 R from TX/NC/OH vs -4 R from California Prop 50 & Colorado re-map.  
4. Litigation tail risk (Louisiana VRA & Prop 50) adds ±3 seats scale.  
5. Econometric fundamentals (GDP growth 1.2 %, inflation 2.4 %, presidential approval 41 %) are mildly negative for the White House but second-order compared with generic ballot.

Putting these together I centre the outside-view distribution on a 10-seat Democratic edge (Republican disadvantage = -10) with a standard deviation of ≈ 10 seats. That implies a  central 80 % band of roughly -22 to +2 seats.

Outside view calibration:

• Distribution shape: normal-like but with heavier tails to allow for map shocks and polling error.  
• 10th/90th percentiles set at ±1.3 σ, 20th/80th at ±0.85 σ, 40th/60th at ±0.2 σ.  
• I widen the negative tail slightly because redistricting and the vacancy calendar favour Democrats if things break their way, while the positive (GOP) tail is capped by limited upside absent a national R +5 environment.

Outside View Prediction (Republican seats minus Democratic seats, negative = Democratic majority):

Percentile 10: -22  
Percentile 20: -15  
Percentile 40: -8  
Percentile 60: -2  
Percentile 80:  5  
Percentile 90: 12
