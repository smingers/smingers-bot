Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality / date / main factual take-aways, opinions flagged)

• Ballotpedia 2026 House page (Jan 31 2026).  Reputable non-partisan reference site; gives hard counts: 220-215 R after 2024, 49 retirements (28 R, 21 D).  Purely factual.  
• Cook Political Report ratings (15 Jan 2026).  Gold-standard handicapping service; identifies 210 seats Lean/Safe D, 206 Lean/Safe R, 19 Toss-ups.  Opinion but by acknowledged experts; methodology transparent.  
• Fox News/Beacon poll (29 Jan 2026).  National live-caller/online, 1005 RV, MoE ±3.  Generic ballot D +6.  Factual numbers; commentary is opinion.  
• Emerson College poll (22 Jan 2026).  1000 LV, MoE ±3.  Generic ballot D +6.  Good historical track record.  
• CNN/SSRS poll (18 Jan 2026).  Generic ballot advantage for Democrats (exact spread not released but “clear”).  Solid but fewer details.  
• G. Elliott Morris article (1 Feb 2026).  Aggregates polling (generic D +4.5, Trump net −18).  Author is respected data journalist.  
• Special-election news wires (1 Feb 2026).  Confirm TX-18 win → chamber now 218 R – 214 D with four vacancies.  Hard count, low error.  
• “Republicans fear disaster” (La Silla Rota, Nov 2025) & Newsweek opinion pieces.  Mostly commentary → treated as weak evidence.  
• NPR redistricting explainer (Dec 2025).  Mixed fact & analysis; core fact: TX, NC, OH maps net ≈ +5 R, CA & UT ≈ +4 D.  Moderate evidence.

2. Evidence analysis (weight)

Strong:  
• Generic ballot average D +5-6 confirmed by two independent polls.  
• Second-term midterm history: president’s party loses mean 17 House seats (n = 7 since 1950).  
• Current House margin razor-thin (218-214 with vacancies) → only 3-4 seat swing needed for control.  
Moderate:  
• Cook ratings show slight Democratic edge in “seats not at least Lean” plus 19 toss-ups.  
• Retirement imbalance (28 R vs 21 D) historically shifts a net 3-4 seats away from retiring party.  
• Redistricting mixed; net +1 R to +2 R most likely.  
Weak:  
• Special-election over-performance (one very blue seat).  Limited predictive value nine months out.  
• Opinion columns forecasting “wave” or “disaster”.

3. Timeframe analysis

Days to election: 276 (≈ 9 months).  Generic ballot nine months out has sd ≈ 5 points → seat swing sd ≈ 12.  If time were halved (4.5 months) model error would drop roughly a third; if doubled (18 months) sd would rise another third.  Thus today’s forecast should still reserve fat tails.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base: Republicans typically lose 15-20 seats in this circumstance → GOP advantage −10 (i.e., Democrats +10).  

Inside adjustments:  
+2 R  (redistricting & map litigation)  
+1 R  (incumbency: Republicans defending slightly more freshmen after 2024 gains)  
−3 R (retirements skew R)  
−4 R (generic ballot D +5 vs electorate R +1 PV in 2024 → about 2 seats per point)  
Net shift: −4 R relative to base, giving expected GOP disadvantage ≈ −14 seats.

Translate to distribution: mean −9, median −8 (because right tail chopped by structural limits), σ ≈ 10.  Heavy-tail add 30 % to each side for unknowns.

Probability calibration

Implied mean −9.1; median −8.  Matches narrative: modest Democratic majority most likely, but clear chance (≈ 30 %) Republicans hang on or gain.  Tails allow double-digit Democratic wave or small GOP pickup.

Checklist:

1. Target variable: Republican seats minus Democratic seats in House on 2026 election night (units = seats).  
2. Base rate: president’s party loses 17 seats → GOP −10 advantage.  
3. Consistency: median −8; mean −9.1; fits factor analysis.  
4. Key evidence: a) generic ballot D +5, b) second-term midterm historical losses, c) 218-214 current split, d) Cook shows 19 toss-ups, e) retirements 28 R-21 D.  
5. Blind-spot: Economic boom or foreign-policy rally lifting Trump to 50 % approval by autumn could shift 8-12 seats toward GOP (outcome +5 to +12).
