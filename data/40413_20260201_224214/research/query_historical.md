Analysis:
The 2026 mid-term will be fought under the same post-2020 district lines that produced very small national seat shifts in both 2022 (R +9 seats) and 2024 (D +3 seats).  As of 1 Feb 2026 Republicans hold 219 seats, Democrats 216, with no vacancies.  Since WWII, the president’s party has lost House seats in 16 of 19 mid-terms, with a median loss of 24 and an inter-quartile range of roughly −16 to −40.  However, partisan realignment, narrower swing distributions and reduced ticket splitting in the 2010s-2020s have lowered the elasticity of the House map: in 2018 an 8-point Democratic popular-vote win produced a pickup of only 41 seats, and in 2022 Republicans gained just 9 seats with a 3-point popular-vote edge.  That implies that each percentage-point shift in the national House vote now moves only about 5–6 seats, versus 8–10 seats a generation ago.

Key historical context to collect for an outside-view baseline:
• Size of House seat swings in all mid-terms since 1934, to establish a prior distribution.  
• Generic congressional-ballot polling performance 9–21 months before Election Day versus final seat change, to calibrate the predictive value of today’s opinion polls.  
• Any structural or one-off factors (re-redistricting in North Carolina & Louisiana, Alabama’s VRA redraw, special-election results in 2025-26) that might pre-shift the partisan baseline by a handful of seats before November 2026.  
• Historical performance of the president’s party when it controls both chambers, one chamber, or neither, to refine priors for 2026 (a presidency with a same-party House majority is generally punished more heavily).  

Collecting this information will let us (1) set a prior distribution centred on a Republican disadvantage of roughly 10–15 seats, (2) adjust that prior with current structural changes (possible Dem gains of 2–4 seats from court-ordered redistricting) and (3) integrate early generic-ballot polling, which today shows Democrats up ~3 points—consistent with a modest, but not wave-level, seat gain.
