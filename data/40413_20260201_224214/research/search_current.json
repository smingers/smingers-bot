The structural advantage lies in the Senate map: Republicans have eliminated Democratic representation in 25 states that voted for Donald Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns\u2014accounting for half of all Senate seats. Democrats must either regain competitiveness in redder states or sweep all Senate seats in blue and purple states to win control. While Democrats have made progress, including a notable rating upgrade in Georgia\u2014where Senator Jon Ossoff\u2019s race shifted from 'Toss-up' to 'Leans Democratic'\u2014the overall outlook still favors Republicans. The 2018 'Blue Wave' did not result in a Democratic Senate takeover, and a similar environment in 2026 may not be sufficient either. President Trump\u2019s improved performance among young and nonwhite voters in 2024 has not significantly altered the Senate dynamics, as Democrats face uphill battles in whiter, Republican-leaning states like Iowa and Ohio.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:35 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Christian Menefee, 37, defeated former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards in the runoff election to fill the vacancy left by the death of former Democratic Representative Sylvester Turner in March 2025. Menefee will serve the remainder of Turner\u2019s term until January 2027. During the campaign, Menefee pledged to implement universal health insurance and to impeach Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, over her hardline immigration policies under the Donald Trump administration. The House now has 218 Republican seats and 214 Democratic seats, with four seats vacant\u2014three of which will be decided by upcoming by-elections. This shift has weakened Republican control, making it crucial for the party to prevent internal defections to pass legislation.

The district, a stronghold for Democratic support, was vacated after the death of former House Representative Sylvester Turner in March 2025. Men\u00e9fie will serve the remainder of Turner's term until January 2027. During the campaign, she campaigned on universal healthcare and pledged to impeach Kristi Noem, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, for her hardline immigration policies under the Donald Trump administration. Following this result, the U.S. House of Representatives now has 218 Republican seats and 214 Democratic seats, narrowing the Republican majority to just four seats.

The seat had been vacant since the death of former Democratic Representative Sylvester Turner in March 2025. Men\u00e9fie will serve the remainder of Turner\u2019s term until January 2027. Her campaign focused on universal healthcare and calling for the impeachment of Kristi Noem, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, over her hardline immigration policies. The victory increased the Democratic Party\u2019s representation in the House to 213 seats, while the Republican Party holds 218, reducing their majority from 5 to 4 seats. With four seats still vacant in the 435-member House, the balance of power is now more precarious for Republicans. The Democratic Party accused Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, of delaying the election to preserve Republican control, while Abbott cited local government readiness issues. In a related special election for the Texas State Senate, Democrat Taylor Lemmet led Republican candidate by 14 percentage points in nearly complete results. The district is a traditionally Republican stronghold where President Trump won by 17 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election. Despite Trump\u2019s public endorsement of the Republican candidate, the Democratic gains have fueled growing speculation that Republicans could lose ground in the November 2026 midterm elections. Republican Senator Dan Patrick described Lemmet\u2019s lead as a 'warning bell' for Republicans across Texas.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20260201048751071)\n\n**Texas Democrat's win a 'wake-up call' for Republicans ahead of 2026 elections**\nIn a special election for a Texas state senate seat, Democrat Taylor Rehmet won by a double-digit margin\u2014over 14 percentage points\u2014defeating Republican activist Leigh Wambsganss, a candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump. The victory marks the first time in decades that Democrats have taken control of the seat from Republicans in this conservative district near Dallas. Wambsganss called the result a 'wake-up call' for Republicans, citing low turnout among Republican voters and Democratic energization. Trump, who labeled Wambsganss a 'true MAGA Warrior' during the campaign, distanced himself from the loss, stating it was a 'local Texas race' and not transferable to national politics. The district is more Republican than Tarrant County, which Trump won by 5 points in 2024 but Biden narrowly won in 2020. Rehmet\u2019s win follows a string of recent Democratic victories in local and state elections, including gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia, and special election successes in Kentucky, Iowa, and Tennessee. The November 2026 midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress and several gubernatorial races, are seen as a referendum on the White House. Democrats, currently the minority in both the House (213-218) and Senate (47-53), are encouraged by momentum, particularly with Texas Democrat Christian Menefee also winning a House vacancy on the same day. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin stated, 'Democrats are building on our historic overperformance, and we're not slowing down.' Democrats are focusing on affordability and 'kitchen-table issues' as key campaign themes, with former Biden official Meghan Hays noting that voters are rejecting 'the chaos that Trump is creating.' Trump has encouraged primary challenges against Republican incumbents, including Louisiana\u2019s Bill Cassidy and Texas senators John Cornyn and Ken Paxton, while indicating he may endorse in the upcoming Texas Republican primary.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:35 PM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/texas-democrat-s-win-a-wake-up-call-for-republicans-ahead-of-2026-elections-ce7e5bddda8af523)\n\n**Texas Democrat's win a 'wake-up call' for Republicans ahead of 2026 US midterm elections**\nIn a special election on January 31, 2026, Democrat Taylor Rehmet won a Texas state senate seat in a conservative district near Dallas by a double-digit margin\u2014over 14 percentage points\u2014defeating Republican activist Leigh Wambsganss, whom former President Donald Trump endorsed as a 'true MAGA Warrior.' The victory marks the first time in decades that Democrats have taken control of the seat from Republicans. Wambsganss called the result a 'wake-up call' for Republicans, noting that Democrats were energized while too many Republicans stayed home. Trump distanced himself from the loss, stating it was a 'local Texas race' and not transferable to national politics. The district is more Republican than Tarrant County, which Trump won by 5 percentage points in 2024 but Biden narrowly won in 2020 by fewer than 2,000 votes. Rehmet\u2019s win follows a series of Democratic victories in local and state elections across the U.S. since Trump\u2019s second term began in 2025, including gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia, and special election victories in Kentucky, Iowa, and a narrow Republican hold in Tennessee. With the November 2026 midterm elections approaching\u2014when control of Congress and several governorships will be decided\u2014Democrats, currently the minority in both the House (213\u2013218) and Senate (47\u201353), are encouraged by momentum. The addition of Representative-elect Christian Menefee, a Texas Democrat, further narrows the Republican House majority. Democratic leaders cite strong performances in competitive states like North Carolina, Maine, Ohio, and Alaska as signs of progress. Trump has encouraged primary challenges against Republican senators, including Bill Cassidy, and indicated he may endorse candidates in a Texas three-way Republican contest involving Senator John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Representative Wesley Hunt. Democratic strategists emphasize affordability and 'kitchen-table issues' as key messaging, with former Biden official Meghan Hays stating the win reflects voter rejection of Trump\u2019s 'chaos.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:26 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/texas-democrats-win-a-wake-up-call-for-republicans-ahead-of-2026-elections)\n\n**Texas House Special Election: Democrats Win, Narrowing Republican Majority**\nIn the Texas U.S. House of Representatives special election for District 18, Democrat Christian Menefee won, defeating former Houston city councilwoman Amanda Edwards in the runoff election held on February 30, 2026 (local time). The seat became vacant following the death of Democratic Congressman Sylvester Turner in March 2025. District 18 is a strong Democratic-leaning area. Menefee, who is the first Black county attorney in Harris County and has participated in legal challenges against former President Donald Trump's immigration executive orders, secured victory after advancing from a November 2025 Democratic primary where no candidate received a majority. She urged voters to participate, stating, 'I\u2019m ready to fight for Washington, DC \u2014 and I need your help.' Menefee will serve the remainder of Turner\u2019s term until January 2027. The election resulted in the U.S. House of Representatives having 218 Republican seats and 214 Democratic seats, with two Republican and one Democratic seats currently vacant, to be filled by special elections later in 2026.

This victory further narrows the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. The seat was long considered a Democratic stronghold, making Menefee's win expected. The election was delayed for over a year\u2014originally vacant since March 2025\u2014due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s authority to schedule the special election, which he only finalized in November 2025. The first round featured 16 candidates, with Menefee and Republican Amanda Edwards advancing to the runoff. Menefee defeated Edwards in the final vote. In his victory speech, Menefee pledged to preserve the Affordable Care Act and support impeachment efforts against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over alleged abuses by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As a special election winner, Menefee will serve the remainder of Turner\u2019s term, which ends in January 2027, meaning he must run again in 2026 to retain his seat. Critics accuse Governor Abbott of deliberately delaying the election to extend Republican advantages. The delay is tied to a redistricting map drawn by Texas Republicans in summer 2025 under pressure from former President Trump, designed to create five additional Republican-leaning districts. Under this map, Menefee\u2019s 18th District was merged with Democrat Al Green\u2019s 9th District, forcing them into a Democratic primary in the next election\u2014ensuring the Democrats lose at least one seat regardless of the outcome.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:24 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260201003182-260408)\n\n**U.S. Government Partial Shutdown Amid Deepening Political Turmoil**\nOn January 31, 2026, due to the U.S. House of Representatives failing to vote on a funding agreement approved by the Senate before adjourning, parts of the U.S. federal government entered a 'shutdown'. The shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis intensified partisan debate over immigration enforcement policies. According to Professor Li Haidong from the Institute of International Relations at the Foreign Affairs University, the recurring government shutdowns reflect systemic dysfunction in the U.S. political system. The budget process, which should be finalized by October 1 each year, is frequently delayed due to partisan gridlock, lobbying, and public pressure. Temporary funding bills are often used to prevent shutdowns, but recent divisions between Democrats and Republicans have made consensus impossible. The shutdowns are now a recurring feature of American politics, highlighting deep-seated issues such as political polarization and partisan conflict. Professor Li Haidong emphasized that the inability to resolve these structural problems undermines public services and governance. The events in Minneapolis exemplify how immigration enforcement has become a flashpoint in broader political struggles, particularly as Republicans seek to gain political advantages in Democratic-leaning states ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:08 PM\nSource:[news.cri.cn](https://news.cri.cn/20260201/1389298a-b42b-4b4e-c710-e2f77719ba4f.html)\n\n**Vote count continues in special Texas election to fill vacant congressional seat**\nVotes were still being counted late on Saturday, February 1, 2026, in a Texas special election to fill the vacant U.S. House of Representatives seat for Texas' 18th Congressional District, a predominantly Democratic area encompassing much of inner Houston and surrounding regions. The race is between Democrats Christian Menefee, 37, a former Harris County attorney, and Amanda Edwards, 44, a former Houston city council member, who advanced to the runoff after topping a field of 16 candidates in the November 2025 election. The seat was left vacant after the death of Representative Sylvester Turner, who served only two months in the House before passing in March 2025. As of 11:15 p.m. CST (0224 GMT), no winner had been announced, more than three hours after polls closed. The outcome will affect the balance of power in the House: Republicans currently hold a 218-213 majority, and a Democratic win would narrow the margin to 218-214. Democrats are demanding a prompt swearing-in for the winner, echoing past tensions\u2014such as when House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the swearing-in of Arizona\u2019s Adelita Grijalva until mid-November 2025. Three additional special elections are scheduled for Georgia, New Jersey, and California in March, April, and August 2026. The outcome of this race is not expected to signal broader trends for the November 2026 midterm elections, though Democrats have performed well in special elections since early 2025, bolstering hopes of reclaiming the House. In the 2024 presidential election, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris won the district 69% to Donald Trump\u2019s 29%. All 435 House seats will be contested in November, and historically, the party in the White House loses seats in midterms. Key legislative issues expected in the coming weeks\u2014including stricter federal immigration agent procedures and reinstatement of a federal health insurance subsidy\u2014could be decided by narrow margins.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:04 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/vote-count-continues-in-special-texas-election-to-fill-vacant-congressional-seat-ce7e5bdddb8ff126)\n\n**NC GOP hopes edge in voter registrations will give 2026 advantage**\nNorth Carolina now has more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the State Board of Elections, with Republicans gaining 4,318 new voters compared to Democrats' 1,637, resulting in a net Republican advantage of 2,077. Jason Simmons, chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, stated this shift provides a 'structural advantage' for the GOP, citing improved early voting performance in the 2024 presidential election and higher turnout among Republicans. He attributed the advantage to sustained registration growth and stronger mobilization. Despite this, nearly 3 million unaffiliated voters\u2014about 39% of the state\u2019s electorate\u2014now outnumber both major parties, creating a key challenge for both sides in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats view recent electoral victories as a positive sign for 2026, while Republicans, facing historical disadvantages, aim to maintain control of the House and Senate. Simmons downplayed the threat posed by unaffiliated voters, suggesting many select 'No Party' at the DMV by default and that the GOP\u2019s mission is to engage these new residents. Nearly 20% of the $1.87 billion in political ads aired in 2025 were targeted at the 2026 midterms, according to AdImpact.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/4406559/north-carolina-gop-historic-edge-voter-registrations-structural-advantage-midterms/)\n\n**Democrats are poised to take the House, but don't expect a blue wave**\nDemocrats are poised to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections, driven by favorable historical trends, growing frustration with the Trump administration, and strong gubernatorial results in New Jersey and Virginia. However, a 2018-style 'blue wave'\u2014characterized by flipping 40 seats\u2014is now considered highly unlikely due to extensive partisan gerrymandering. In 2018, Democrats flipped 75% of seats in districts where Trump won by less than 5 points; this time, only 14 Republican-held toss-up seats remain, significantly limiting potential gains. Redistricting in Texas and California, particularly Texas\u2019s map changes at Trump\u2019s request and California\u2019s Prop. 50 in response, has entrenched safe Republican and Democratic districts, shrinking the competitive landscape. As a result, even if Democrats win the House, their majority will likely be narrower than in 2018. Despite this, national polling shows a modest Democratic advantage: 47% of voters want Democrats to win the House (vs. 43% for Republicans), and 54% of Americans say they are more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate than a Republican (38%). Key battlegrounds include Tennessee\u2019s 5th District (a deep-red district where Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder is a top fundraiser and recent city-level turnaround), North Carolina\u2019s 1st District (held by moderate Democrat Don Davis, now leaning Republican due to redistricting), and New York\u2019s 17th District (Rep. Mike Lawler, one of three Republicans in a district Harris won in 2024). Control of the House will thus hinge on a small number of closely contested races, where candidate quality and local issues matter as much as national momentum. To maintain their edge and position for a 2028 presidential bid, Democrats must continue focusing on core issues like housing affordability, the job market, and healthcare costs, especially as Trump denies the nation\u2019s affordability crisis.

She stated that once Democrats win the majority, they will reclaim congressional power currently dominated by President Trump. Pelosi affirmed that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is prepared to become Speaker, praising his rhetorical skills, respect among colleagues, and ability to unify the party. She criticized the current Republican-controlled Congress for merely following Trump's will, saying, 'Once we get the gavel, that will end.' According to a November Gallup poll cited by The Guardian, Trump's approval rating had dropped to 36%, with 60% disapproval. Historical election trends also suggest that the incumbent party typically faces disadvantages in midterm elections, leading Republican lawmakers to brace for a tough campaign in 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 12:59 PM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/5293456)\n\n**Democrats' chances of flipping the House from Republicans in 2026**\nDemocrats are favored to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterms, according to recent polling and expert analysis. All 435 House seats are up for election, and Democrats are optimistic following victories in 2025 elections and a growing lead in generic ballot polls. Polls show varying leads: a YouGov/The Economist poll gave Democrats a 3-point advantage (43% to 40%), an AtlasIntel poll showed a 16-point lead (54% to 38%), a Fabrizio Ward poll indicated a 7-point lead (45% to 38%), and a Quantus Insights poll showed a narrow 2-point edge (43% to 41%). Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor, stated Democrats are 'very likely' to take over the House, citing Republican retirements, Trump\u2019s declining approval rating, and redistricting efforts by both parties. Republicans redrew maps in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio to favor conservatives, while California and Utah adjusted theirs to favor Democrats. Ernest McGowen III emphasized that party strategy in primaries\u2014particularly candidate selection between moderate and progressive factions\u2014and fundraising will shape the outcome. The economy remains a key issue, with voters citing affordability as critical, and Democratic governors won in New Jersey and Virginia by large margins in 2025. Currently, Republicans hold a narrow 220\u2013213 majority in the House, with two Democratic seats vacant. The Cook Political Report rates 208 seats as leaning Democratic and 210 as leaning Republican. Five Democratic-held seats are toss-ups (Gray, Vasquez, Gillen, Landsman, Gluesenkamp Perez), and twelve Republican-held seats are in play (Schweikert, Ciscomani, Valadao, Issa, Evans, Miller-Meeks, Barrett, Kean Jr., Mackenzie, Perry, Kiggans, Van Orden). Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene warned Republicans that healthcare failures could cost them in 2026, while journalist G. Elliot Morris noted a 90-point swing in favor of Democrats on economic issues in 2025 gubernatorial races. Red Eagle Politics argued Democrats have overperformed in off-year elections but will likely revert to baseline in midterms. The 2026 midterms are scheduled for November 3, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-of-flipping-the-house-from-republicans-in-2026-11268797)\n\n**After Texas ruling, Trump and Republicans head to 2026 with a redistricting edge**\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority ruled in favor of Texas lawmakers, Republicans gained a strategic advantage in the 2026 redistricting cycle, a process initiated by President Trump to maintain Republican control of the House of Representatives. The Texas map could potentially yield five additional GOP seats. This development is part of a broader national redistricting battle, with Democrats countering in California by passing a new map through a special election that could flip five Republican-held seats. In Indiana, the state House passed a new map, though some Republicans have hesitated to follow Trump\u2019s directive, prompting threats from Trump and Republican Governor Mike Braun, with several lawmakers receiving anonymous threats to their families. Republicans hold a structural advantage in redistricting due to control of more state legislatures nationwide. Additionally, some Democratic-controlled states have legal barriers to partisan gerrymandering or require independent commissions to draw maps\u2014such as Maryland, which has already formed a commission. The outcome of the 2026 House elections will depend on the final maps, pending court challenges, and state legislative votes, with estimates suggesting the redistricting process could shift around 12\u201314 seats toward Republicans and nine toward Democrats. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) remains a critical legal safeguard, prohibiting intentional efforts to weaken minority voting power through 'cracking' or 'packing' districts. The final impact will not be known until the November 3, 2026, election results are tallied.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/08/nx-s1-5634585/redistricting-2026midterm-election-trump-congress)\n\n**Republicans on Alert: Fear of Electoral 'Disaster' in 2026 as They Risk Losing House and Senate Majority**\nRepublican lawmakers in Washington are experiencing growing alarm over the potential for a major electoral defeat in the 2026 midterm elections, fearing a 'wipeout' that could result in losing control of the House of Representatives and reducing their Senate majority by two or three seats. This concern follows significant losses in the November 4 local elections, particularly in Virginia, where Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governorship by 15 points and her party gained over a dozen seats in the House of Delegates, including in non-competitive districts. A Republican senator admitted at a private meeting, 'The numbers are terrible. I repeat: we didn\u2019t win anything anywhere.' The GOP is especially concerned about President Donald Trump\u2019s declining approval rating\u201441.9% approval and 55.7% disapproval according to Decision Desk HQ\u2014and the Democrats\u2019 largest lead in generic ballot polling (46.8% to 41.4%). Strategists warn this gap could become a decisive disadvantage in swing states and districts. The political landscape is further complicated by legal challenges: a federal court invalidated Texas\u2019s congressional map, now under review by the Supreme Court, while Democrats are poised to gain up to six new seats, particularly in California. The House race projections are highly uncertain, with Republicans expecting a narrow battlefield and Democrats anticipating up to 60 competitive districts. In the Senate, Republicans acknowledge they could lose three key seats: Thom Tillis (NC), Susan Collins (ME), and Jon Husted (OH), which would leave the chamber tied 50-50 in 2027\u2014still under GOP control due to Vice President J.D. Vance\u2019s tie-breaking vote. Democrats also eye Iowa, Texas, and Alaska as potential pickups. Meanwhile, Republicans are targeting Democratic seats in Georgia (Jon Ossoff), Michigan (Gary Peters), and a fragmented Democratic primary in Michigan. Both parties agree that the 2026 cycle is among the most volatile in over a decade, with the GOP warning that without course correction, they face a 'disaster' similar to their 2018 losses, when they lost 41 House seats.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/11/24/republicanos-en-alerta-temen-un-desastre-electoral-en-2026-570400.html)\n\n**Democrats are celebrating after Election Day -- 2026 could be a harder fight**\nDemocrats celebrated victories in gubernatorial races, mayoral contests, and a key ballot measure on Tuesday, November 5, 2025, including wins by Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey (56.3% of the vote) and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia (57% of the vote), both with double-digit margins over Republican opponents. These results energized the party following a major Republican sweep in the 2024 presidential election, which saw Donald Trump return to the White House, flip the Senate, and maintain control of the House. Despite the momentum, analysts warn that Democrats face significant obstacles in the 2026 midterms. The House race is seen as more attainable: Democrats need to flip just three seats to gain control, though redistricting efforts\u2014particularly in states like Texas, Ohio, and California\u2014could shift the balance. California\u2019s Proposition 50 may counteract Republican redistricting gains, potentially giving Democrats an estimated four to five additional seats. However, the Senate remains a much tougher challenge: Democrats must retain all 13 of their current seats and flip at least four of the 20 Republican-held seats up for election in 2026. The Cook Political Report rates two Democratic seats (Georgia, Michigan) and two Republican seats (Maine, North Carolina) as toss-ups, while 17 Republican Senate seats are classified as solid Republican. A looming Supreme Court decision in Louisiana v. Callais, which could strike down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and allow broader racial gerrymandering, may further disadvantage Democrats by enabling Republicans to redraw maps that dilute minority voting power\u2014areas that typically favor Democrats. Legal experts like Justice Brett Kavanaugh have noted that race-based districting remedies should have an end point. Analysts such as Doug Gordon and Matt Klink acknowledge the current Democratic momentum but caution that long-term outcomes remain uncertain, with Gordon stating, 'Whether it was just a great night, or a larger trend is still to be determined.' Republican strategist John Feehery emphasized that Democrats should not be underestimated, while also urging Republicans to focus on improving economic conditions for the working class. The 2026 midterms are still over a year away, with primaries beginning within the next six months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-are-celebrating-after-election-day2026-could-be-a-harder-fight-11000224)\n\n**Here's why Democrats could face trouble in 2026 midterms: CNN data guru**\nAccording to CNN data analyst Harry Enten, Democrats' chances of retaking the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections have declined significantly, dropping from an 83% probability in April to 63% in October. Conversely, Republicans' odds rose from 17% to 37% over the same period. Enten attributes the decline to Democrats failing to maintain the momentum they had in 2017, when they held an 8-point lead on the generic congressional ballot, compared to their current 3-point advantage. He noted that while Democrats remain slightly ahead nationally, they have fallen behind the pace set during the 2017\u20132018 period. Enten also highlighted that mid-decade redistricting could favor Republicans: if both parties fully exploit redistricting, Republicans could gain a 7-seat advantage. He cited recent GOP-led redistricting efforts in Texas and Missouri, as well as the potential weakening of the Voting Rights Act, as factors making it harder for Democrats to gain seats. House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority, complicating legislative progress. President Donald Trump encouraged Republican states to redraw district lines earlier in 2025 to boost GOP representation, while Democratic-leaning states like California have proposed counter-maps to preserve their advantage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 10:08 AM\nSource:[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/10/heres-why-democrats-could-face-trouble-in-2026-midterms-cnn-data-guru.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nIn February 2026, analysts overwhelmingly suggest Republicans face significant challenges in retaining their House majority in the midterm elections.
