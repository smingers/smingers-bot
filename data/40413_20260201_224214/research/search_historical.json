Current House headcount and vacancy map  \n   \u2022 Five seats are now vacant: four formerly Republican (NY-03, AL-01, CA-20 and, as of 5 Jan., CA-01 after Rep. Doug La Malfa\u2019s death) and one formerly Democratic (TX-18, vacated when Rep. Sylvester Turner died last March).  \n   \u2022 Filled seats therefore stand at 217 R \u2013 213 D, leaving Republicans with a nominal four-seat edge but no room for partisan error.\n\n2. Special-election calendars  \n   \u2022 CA-01 (North State).  Gov. Newsom set the special primary for 2 June and, if needed, a runoff for 4 Aug., the latest date state law allows (Los Angeles Times, 23 Jan 2026).  Rural voters will be unrepresented for seven months, and the August date all but guarantees the seat will not bolster the GOP during this summer\u2019s appropriations fights.  Proposition 50 converted the district from deep-red to roughly Biden +7, so a Democratic flip is plausible.  \n   \u2022 TX-18 (Houston).  A Democratic runoff between Christian Menefee and Amanda Edwards will decide the seat on 31 Jan (Spectrum Local News, 16 Jan 2026).  Either outcome returns the district to Democratic hands and trims the GOP\u2019s functional margin to 217 R \u2013 214 D by mid-February.  \n   \u2022 NY-03 (Long Island).  The New York City Board of Elections continues to list only state-legislative specials on 3 Feb.; no federal writ of election exists (Vote.NYC Upcoming Elections page, accessed 1 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 AL-01 (Mobile/Baldwin) still lacks a proclamation; statewide election calendars list no federal special (VOTE 411 Upcoming Alabama Election Dates page, accessed 1 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 CA-20 (Central Valley) remains unscheduled.  Neither the Secretary of State\u2019s site nor major news outlets reference a date.  \n   Implication: of the five vacancies, only TX-18 will be filled before spring filing deadlines.  The House will continue to operate with a razor-thin 217 R\u2013214 D split well into the summer, heightening the leverage of every cross-pressured member.\n\n3. Fund-raising and generic-ballot environment  \n   \u2022 No Q4-2025 committee reports are yet public, so cash-on-hand tallies for the DCCC and NRCC remain unknown; the FEC\u2019s most recent mid-year summary showed House candidates with $637 million on hand as of 30 June 2025 (FEC Statistical Summary, 2025-26 cycle).  \n   \u2022 On the mood side, a late-January Fox News poll put Democrats ahead on the national generic ballot by six points, 52 %\u201346 % \u2013 the party\u2019s best showing in that survey\u2019s history (New York Post, 1 Feb 2026).  The RealClearPolitics average now sits at D + 4.8.  Historically, a D + 5 national margin translates to roughly a 15-seat House swing.\n\n4. Litigation that could alter the map  \n   \u2022 California Proposition 50.  A three-judge federal panel has rejected GOP demands for a preliminary injunction; Republicans have filed an emergency application with Justice Kagan to block use of the new maps (ABC 7 Los Angeles, 21 Jan 2026).  Amicus briefs (Public Interest Legal Foundation, 26 Jan 2026) underscore that the Supreme Court could still act, but timing is uncertain.  Candidates have already begun signature gathering, so any stay would have to issue within weeks to be administratively feasible.  \n   \u2022 Louisiana v. Callais (Voting Rights Act).  Still pending; no supplemental briefing schedule has been announced.  A ruling that curtails race-conscious districting could threaten as many as three Democratic-leaning VRA seats later this spring.  \n   In short, the Prop 50 maps \u2013 worth an estimated net two-to-five Democratic seats \u2013 are more likely than not to survive 2026, but the risk window remains open.\n\n5. Updated seat-change arithmetic  \n   Baseline with TX-18 filled: 217 R \u2013 214 D, four vacancies.  \n   \u2022 Special-election prospects:  \n     \u2013 CA-01: Toss-up under the new map (Biden +7).  \n     \u2013 NY-03: Biden +8; Dems averaged D +9 over-performance in 2025 specials \u21d2 Lean D pickup if/when scheduled.  \n     \u2013 AL-01: Trump +29; likely GOP hold.  \n     \u2013 CA-20: still R-friendly even after Prop 50; Likely R.  \n     Net expectation: +1.5 D seats from specials, pulling the chamber to a de facto 216 R \u2013 216 D tie by autumn if CA-01 and NY-03 both flip.  \n   \u2022 Mid-term fundamentals: second-term presidential penalty (\u20138 R to \u201312 R) + generic ballot (\u201315 R equivalent) \u2248 10-12 seat Democratic gain, still the central estimate from prior modelling.  \n   \u2022 Redistricting offsets: +4 R (TX, NC, OH) vs \u20133 to \u20135 R (CA Prop 50) \u2248 neutral nationally unless the Supreme Court strikes Prop 50 or VRA seats.  \n   \u2022 Retirements: 26 R vs 21 D make open-seat exposure slightly GOP-heavy.\n\n   Taking all factors together, Democrats remain modest favorites to net the four seats required for a majority, with the most plausible path being 1\u20132 special-election flips followed by a 9- to 10-seat November gain.  The key downside risk is a late Supreme Court ruling that both:  \n      a) upholds Prop 50 (removing 3\u20135 GOP seats) and  \n      b) simultaneously invalidates Louisiana-style VRA districts (adding up to 3 GOP seats).  \n   The two cases could partially cancel each other out, widening the confidence bands around any projection.\n\n6. Outstanding information gaps  \n   a. Formal writs of election and calendars for NY-03, AL-01 and CA-20.  Without dates, modelling campaign spending and turnout is guesswork.  \n   b. First hard Q4-2025 cash-on-hand numbers for the DCCC, NRCC and frontline incumbents (due 31 Jan but not yet posted).  \n   c. Public or even credible internal polling in CA-01, CA-20 and NY-03 under the new lines.  \n   d. Supreme Court action timetable on both the Prop 50 emergency appeal (Tangipa v Newsom) and Louisiana v Callais.  \n   e. Updated district-level presidential partisanship scores for Alabama once its mid-February filing deadline passes.\n\nConclusion  \nThe special-election landscape has shifted from a question of \u201cif\u201d to \u201cwhen\u201d: only one of the five vacancies (TX-18) will be resolved quickly, and even that tightens the partisan gap to just three votes.  Delays in New York, Alabama and California\u2019s Central Valley preserve Republican control through the first half of the year but at the cost of leaving the majority balanced on a knife-edge.  Assuming a neutral court outcome, the probabilistic centre-line remains a Democratic pickup of 10\u201312 seats \u2013 enough for the gavel \u2013 but that forecast is unusually sensitive to litigation timelines and the exact scheduling of two high-leverage specials (NY-03 and CA-01).  Until writs of election or Supreme Court calendars surface, those variables stay indeterminate and so do the tails of the distribution.</Agent_report>\n"
