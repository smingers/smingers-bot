Frontwoman Kimberly Perry described the event as deeply personal, celebrating community and their roots. The band re-signed with Big Machine Label Group in July 2025, with Perry\u2019s husband, Jonny Costello, joining as backing vocalist, replacing her brother Neil, who left to focus on artist management and raising mustangs in Joshua Tree. Reid Perry left the band in October 2025, citing a shift toward the management side of music and a passion for ranch life. Perry emphasized that the transition to a husband-and-wife duo has been seamless, highlighting their complementary strengths\u2014Costello managing the home front and Perry handling the business. The band is currently on a 2026 tour, their first in approximately seven years, with plans to return to the studio to complete a new album, which Perry says is 'very close' to finishing.

The band\u2019s 2010 hit 'If I Die Young' achieved Diamond certification (10 million units sold) by the RIAA in November 2025, making Perry the only female artist to solo-write a Diamond-certified country song. The track also won CMA awards for Single and Song of the Year in 2011 and remains culturally resonant, frequently shared in tributes and viral internet trends. The Band Perry previously released gold-certified albums 'Pioneer' (2013) and earned a Grammy for their cover of 'Gentle On My Mind' in 2015. Perry, 42, reflected on her journey, stating that The Band Perry has always been a family band and that this new chapter\u2014'season two'\u2014is both joyful and meaningful.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 10:30 AM\nSource: [MassLive](https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2026/01/country-band-fresh-off-hiatus-returns-with-historic-honor-first-tour-in-years.html)\n\n**Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, K-pop and more: Who will win at the 2026 Grammys?**\nThe 2026 Grammy Awards, set for February 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and broadcast on CBS and Paramount+, feature a highly competitive lineup. Kendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, followed by Lady Gaga, Jack Antonoff, and Cirkut with seven each. Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny, Leon Thomas, and Serban Ghenea each have six. In Album of the Year, 'GNX' by Kendrick Lamar is seen as a strong contender due to its cultural saturation, sustained engagement, and integration across music, sports, and everyday language, though 'Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos' by Bad Bunny and 'Mayhem' by Lady Gaga are also strong narrative and artistic choices. For Record of the Year, 'APT.' by Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars is favored for its universal appeal, cross-generational resonance, and global reach, potentially making Ros\u00e9 the first K-pop artist to win in this category. In Song of the Year, 'Abracadabra' by Lady Gaga is highlighted for its lyrical precision and intentional construction, with a strong chance of victory despite competition from Billie Eilish and Bruno Mars. Best New Artist is a tight race between Leon Thomas, who stands out for his cohesive body of work, and Olivia Dean, whose name has been most frequently mentioned. In Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, 'APT.' is a leading contender due to the balance and cohesion between Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, though 'Golden' by HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI is also a strong nominee. 'GNX' is considered the clear favorite for Best Rap Album, with strong arguments for its cohesion and cultural dominance. For Best Contemporary Country Album, Jelly Roll\u2019s 'Beautifully Broken' is predicted to win due to its genre-fluid storytelling and emotional authenticity, aligning with the category\u2019s new focus. 'Mutt' by Leon Thomas is the top pick for Best R&B Album, praised for its restraint and songwriting depth. In Best Dance/Electronic Album, Skrillex\u2019s 'F -- U Skrillex You Think Ur Andy Warhol but UR Not! 3' is favored for its balance of innovation and structure. Finally, in Best Latin Pop Album, Karol G\u2019s 'Tropicoqueta' is seen as a forward-moving, culturally specific project with strong potential, though Natalia Lafourcade and Alejandro Sanz remain strong contenders.

HUNTR/X, the fictional K-pop group from the Netflix series *K-Pop Demon Hunters*, is the frontrunner to win the first-ever Grammy for a K-pop act, with a 68% win probability on Kalshi, fueled by the viral success of their anthem 'Golden' and its Golden Globe victory. Kelsey Barnes of Sch\u00f6n! Magazine and grammy.com describes a K-pop win as 'symbolic and transformative,' emphasizing the genre's deep cultural roots and artistic complexity, which have long been underrecognized by the Grammys. Bad Bunny's Spanish-language album *Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos* is also on track for history, with a 61% implied probability of winning Best Album\u2014making it the first exclusively Spanish-language project nominated across Album, Record, and Song of the Year simultaneously. Barnes notes this would signify a shift in the Academy\u2019s recognition of global music, affirming that 'pop is global' and transcends language barriers. Olivia Dean, a rising British soul artist, is favored to become the fourth British female soloist to win Best New Artist, with a 70% win probability, following in the footsteps of Amy Winehouse, Adele, and Dua Lipa. Alexander McCloy attributes her success to her authentic 'Artistic DNA' and strategic international exposure, including opening for Sabrina Carpenter. Bruno Mars is on the verge of matching Lady Gaga\u2019s record of three wins in the Best Pop Duo/Group category, with a potential victory for 'APT.' with ROS\u00c9. Barnes highlights Mars\u2019 consistent, comforting artistry as a key factor in his enduring appeal, noting that his predictability offers stability in uncertain times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 11:01 AM\nSource: [Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/entertainment/grammy-predictions-records)\n\n**Two legends -- a drummer and a rapper -- unite for unexpected musical journey**\nJohn Densmore, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer of The Doors, and Chuck D, founder of Public Enemy and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, have formed a new musical supergroup called doPE, blending their legacies. Their debut album, 'no country for old men,' will be released on April 18, 2026, exclusively as a limited-edition oxblood transparent vinyl through participating local record shops for Record Store Day. The lead single, 'every tick tick tick,' has been named Record Store Day's 2026 Song of the Year in advance of its release. The collaboration began with a chance meeting at a Record Store Day panel in 2014, followed by a direct email from Chuck D in 2015 proposing the project with the phrase: 'You've got the beats, I've got the rhymes, let's make doPE.' Over the next decade, the duo developed the album around the philosophical concept: 'Everybody gets older, but not everybody gets elder,' as reported by Stereogum. Chuck D, 65, described the project as a bridge between generations, stating, 'John Densmore's beat isn't just rhythm, it's history talking,' while Densmore, 81 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner, called the collaboration 'an honor.' The album is characterized as a 'meditation on responsibility, legacy and the bond between generations,' according to American Songwriter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:45 PM\nSource: [MassLive](https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2026/01/two-legends-a-drummer-and-a-rapper-unite-for-unexpected-musical-journey.html)\n\n**Who Will Perform Live at the 2026 Grammys?**\nThe list of artists performing live at the 2026 Grammy Awards is expanding.

He previously won three Grammys in the M\u00fasica Urbana category and one for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album. Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, is vying for Album of the Year with 'Mayhem,' Record of the Year and Song of the Year for 'Abracadabra,' and other categories. She has 14 Grammy wins, including her most recent in Best Pop Duo/Group Performance ('Die With a Smile') and Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album (Love for Sale).

For 2025, zero country or country-adjacent artists received nominations in these top categories, despite country\u2019s significant commercial growth and critical acclaim. The article highlights that while country has seen rising popularity and strong performances by artists like Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney, Ella Langley, and Zach Top\u2014each receiving multiple CMA nominations\u2014none were nominated at the Grammys. Lainey Wilson, in particular, has been repeatedly overlooked despite widespread critical and commercial success, including winning a country Grammy in 2024, which made her ineligible for Best New Artist. The article notes a historical trend: since 2011, only two country songs have been nominated in Record of the Year, and the last nomination for a traditional country artist in Album of the Year was Chris Stapleton\u2019s 'Traveller' in 2015. While the Recording Academy has made progress in down-ballot country categories\u2014such as splitting Best Country Album into Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Country\u2014the top tiers remain largely inaccessible. The article suggests systemic issues, including voter disinterest, a lack of demographic diversity among voters, and the genre\u2019s focus on the CMAs and ACMs as primary recognition platforms. It argues that the Grammys\u2019 failure to recognize country\u2019s dominant female artists reflects a broader institutional bias, despite country\u2019s cultural and commercial relevance. The piece concludes by urging the Recording Academy to expand its voter base and recognize the genre\u2019s creative renaissance, especially the rise of women in country music.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource: [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/music/news/grammys-country-music-problem-1236575130/)\n\n**For country music traditionalists, Grammy changes promise a brighter spotlight**\nThe Grammy Awards are splitting the Best Country Album category into two separate categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, effective next year. This change, announced on November 7, 2025, follows years of advocacy by traditional country artists and supporters like Kyle Coroneos of Saving Country Music and NPR\u2019s Jewly Hight. The move aims to provide greater recognition for artists whose music leans toward classic country sensibilities, such as Sunny Sweeney, whose 2024 album 'Rhinestone Requiem' was not eligible under the old category. Sweeney reported receiving 7,000 text messages within 10 minutes of the announcement, reflecting widespread excitement among traditionalists. While artists like Zach Top, a mainstream country hitmaker with classic influences, welcome the new category as a validation of their sound, others like Charley Crockett express discomfort with genre labeling, questioning whether his work fits neatly into 'traditional' or 'contemporary' despite his rootsy style. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of The Recording Academy, emphasized that changes are driven by community input and proposals, not arbitrary decisions. The first five nominees for Best Traditional Country Album will be announced the following day. The shift reflects a broader effort to address historical marginalization of traditional country music within the mainstream industry and awards landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 04:43 PM\nSource: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5596419/grammy-nominations-country-music-traditional-contemporary)\n\n**Grammy 2026 Nominations: Date, Presenters, And When And Where To Watch The Event Live | Outlook India**\nThe nominees for the 68th Grammy Awards will be announced on November 7, 2025, by the Recording Academy.

This change redefines the existing 'Best Country Album' category as 'Best Contemporary Country Album' to better distinguish between traditional and modern country music. The new category aims to recognize artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hoffman, whose work does not fit mainstream country. According to Shelly Maree of the Recording Academy, the proposal was under review for about three years, with data collection beginning two years prior and final approval in spring 2025. The category defines traditional country by adherence to classic sound structures, including steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, live drums, and subgenres like western, western swing, and outlaw country. The Academy emphasizes that evaluation is based on the music, not the artist, and that an artist may be classified differently in different years depending on their album. The move is intended to create a more inclusive and representative platform, encouraging underrepresented artists to join the Academy and gain visibility. Maree notes that Grammy recognition can significantly boost streams and public awareness, especially for independent or traditionally rooted artists not widely played on commercial radio. The Academy also highlights that similar dual categories already exist in blues, R&B, and pop, affirming that this structure is not new but necessary for country\u2019s broad spectrum. The change reflects a broader effort to listen to the music community and adapt to the genre\u2019s diversity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource: [musicrow.com](https://musicrow.com/2025/11/a-home-for-tradition-the-grammys-get-a-new-country-category-interview/)\n\n**Jelly Roll, Zach Top & No Morgan Wallen: Inside the Grammy Race for Contemporary & Traditional Country Albums**\nThe Recording Academy has split the Grammy Award for Best Country Album into two distinct categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, marking the first time two country albums will be honored in the country field. This change aligns country categories with other genres like R&B, pop, and blues, which already separate contemporary and traditional works. The split has led to a significant increase in entries, with 68 albums submitted for contemporary and 62 for traditional, up from 79 total last year. The traditional category includes recordings adhering to classic country structures, instrumentation (e.g., acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo), and sub-genres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country. It features strong contenders such as Willie Nelson\u2019s 'Oh What a Beautiful World,' Lukas Nelson\u2019s 'American Romance,' Parker McCollum\u2019s self-titled album, Jamey Johnson\u2019s 'Midnight Gasoline,' Cody Jinks\u2019 'In My Blood,' George Strait\u2019s 'Cowboys and Dreamers,' Margo Price\u2019s 'Hardheaded Woman,' Trisha Yearwood\u2019s 'The Mirror,' and Turnpike Troubadours\u2019 'The Price of Admission.' The contemporary category, defined as music reflecting the broad spectrum of modern country style and culture, includes top contenders like Tyler Childers\u2019 'Snipe Hunter,' Miranda Lambert\u2019s 'Postcards From Texas,' Jelly Roll\u2019s 'Beautifully Broken,' Kelsea Ballerini\u2019s 'Patterns,' and Eric Church\u2019s 'Evangeline vs. the Machine.' Notably, Morgan Wallen\u2019s 'I'm the Problem,' the year\u2019s biggest country album, was not submitted, removing a major contender. Other potential nominees include Tucker Wetmore\u2019s 'What Not To' and Riley Green\u2019s deluxe 'Don\u2019t Mind If I Do.' First-round voting ends October 15, nominations are announced November 7, final-round voting runs December 12 to January 5, and the 68th Grammy Awards will be held on February 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource: [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammy-race-for-contemporary-and-traditional-country-albums-1236089699/)\n\n**Entries for the Grammys Traditional Country Category Are Here**\nThe 68th Annual Grammy Awards are set for Sunday, February 1, 2026. The Recording Academy has introduced a new Best Traditional Country Album category for the 2026 Grammys, announced in June, which many fans believe is a response to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2025 Best Country Album win. As of October 11, 2025, the entry ballot is live, featuring over 30 artists competing for nomination. Active Recording Academy members will vote through October 15 to narrow the list, with official nominees to be announced on Friday, November 7, 2025. Among the artists reportedly up for the Traditional Country Album category are independent acts like Charley Crockett, Margo Price, and the Turnpike Troubadours; country legends including Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, and George Strait; and mainstream artists such as Zach Top, The Castellows, and Parker McCollum. The Best Contemporary Country Album category is expected to include Riley Green, Tyler Childers, and potentially Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, and Cody Johnson, based on the Country Music Association Awards (CMAs) as a predictor. The announcement of nominees is pending official voting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource: [Country Living](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a69002094/grammys-traditional-country-entries/)\n\n**The Grammys Rewrote Their Rules After Beyonc\u00e9's Historic Best Country Album Win**\nIn 2025, Beyonc\u00e9 made history by winning the Grammy for Best Country Album, becoming the first Black woman to do so. Her win, which she described as unexpected, sparked widespread reaction and meme culture, especially after her visibly stunned reaction and a nudge from her daughter, Blue Ivy. Beyonc\u00e9 credited the win to the country artists who contributed to her album, 'Cowboy Carter,' and criticized genre boundaries as tools to marginalize artists, urging others to pursue their passions persistently. The win prompted backlash within the country music community, leading the Recording Academy to split the Best Country Album category into Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album starting in 2026. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, stated the change was driven by country artists themselves seeking greater recognition across subgenres, aligning country with other genres' award structures. This move followed a similar change after Beyonc\u00e9 won Best Dance/Electronic Record for 'Renaissance,' which led to the creation of the Best Pop Dance Record category. Beyonc\u00e9 also won Album of the Year for 'Cowboy Carter,' which she said was inspired by her past exclusion from the country genre. She revealed on Instagram that her experience of not feeling welcomed in country music led her to deeply study its history, ultimately creating a work that celebrates its roots and unites diverse voices. Her performance of 'Daddy Lessons' with the Chicks at the CMA Awards drew criticism, with some arguing she shouldn\u2019t have been invited, but Beyonc\u00e9 stated these criticisms fueled her artistic evolution, allowing her to challenge genre limitations and blend styles in 'Act II' of her work.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:35 PM\nSource: [Showbiz Cheat Sheet](https://www.cheatsheet.com/news/music/grammys-rewrote-rules-beyonces-historic-best-country-album-win.html/)\n\n**Entries to Grammy's New Traditional Country Category Look Very Promising**\nThe ballot for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards has been released, featuring a newly introduced Best Traditional Country Album category, which aims to elevate authentic country artists often marginalized in favor of contemporary or pop-influenced acts. The category, with an eligibility period from August 31, 2024, to August 30, 2025, includes 68 entries\u2014more than the 62 in the Best Contemporary Country Album category\u2014indicating strong participation. Prominent independent and traditional country artists are well-represented, including Charley Crockett ('Dollar A Day'), Cody Jinks ('In My Blood'), Margo Price ('Hard Headed Woman'), Turnpike Troubadours ('The Price of Admission'), and Jesse Daniel ('Son Of The San Lorenzo'). Country legends such as Willie Nelson ('Oh What A Beautiful World'), George Strait ('Cowboys And Dreamers'), Dwight Yoakam ('Brighter Days'), Trisha Yearwood ('The Mirror'), and Asleep At The Wheel ('Riding High In Texas') are also in contention. Women in traditional country are making a strong showing with Sunny Sweeney ('Rhinestone Requiem'), Shawna Thompson ('Lean On Neon'), Kristina Murray ('Little Blue'), Kelsey Waldon ('Every Ghost'), and Hailey Whitters ('Corn Queen'). Mainstream traditionalists like Zach Top ('Ain't In It For My Health'), The Castellows ('Homecoming'), Kameron Marlowe ('Sad Songs For The Soul'), Ashland Craft ('Dive Bar Beauty Queen'), and Parker McCollum ('Parker McCollum') are included, proving the category isn't limited to independent acts. Underground and lesser-known artists such as Benjamin Tod ('Shooting Star'), JP Harris ('JP Harris Is A Trash Fire'), Joshua Ray Walker ('Tropicana'), Caleb Klauder & Reeb Willms ('Gold In Your Pocket'), and The Doohickeys ('All Hat No Cattle') are also featured. Subgenres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country are represented by Marcedes Carroll ('We Lost Track Of The Stars'), Ian Munsick ('Eagle Feather'), Tris Munsick & The Innocents ('Big Medicine Moon'), Sterling Drake ('The Shape I'm In'), and Ned LeDoux ('Safe Haven'). The nominees will be announced on November 7, 2025. The Best Contemporary Country Album category remains competitive, with artists like Tyler Childers and Riley Green among the entries, suggesting that 'country' authenticity is still strong in both categories. Artists must submit their work for consideration, and the high number of entries signals growing engagement in the new traditional category.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource: [Saving Country Music](https://savingcountrymusic.com/entries-to-grammys-new-traditional-country-category-look-very-promising/)\n\n**2026 GRAMMYs: More than 1,000 songs battle for eight nomination slots**\nThe 2026 Grammy Awards are seeing intense competition in the Song of the Year category, with 1,015 entries\u2014making it the most competitive category in Grammy history. This surpasses last year\u2019s 978 submissions and far exceeds the 48 entries in Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, the lowest number recorded. Voting by Recording Academy members opened on October 3, 2025, and closes on October 15. Nominations will be announced on November 7, 2025, with the main ceremony set for February 1, 2026, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Other categories also saw shifts: Record of the Year rose to 894 entries, Best New Artist to 337, and Songwriter of the Year (Non Classical) to 63. Conversely, Album of the Year declined from 707 to 686 entries, and Producer of the Year (Non Classical) dropped from 200 to 161. Two new categories were introduced: Best Traditional Country Album (68 entries) and Best Album Cover (68 entries), with traditional country outpacing contemporary country (62 entries). While no category fell below the 40-entry minimum required for five nominees, the soundtrack category is near the threshold. Five specialized categories\u2014Best Album Cover, Best Recording Package, Best Album Notes, Best Historical Album, and Best Immersive Audio Album\u2014will be decided by committees rather than voters. Final round voting runs from December 12 to January 5, 2026, with winners announced live during the ceremony.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 07:37 AM\nSource: [The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/life/music/2026-grammys-more-than-1000-songs-battle-for-eight-nomination-slots/)\n\n"
