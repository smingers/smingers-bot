**ACT III - 2027 Grammy Predictions**
The article predicts that the Grammy Awards may create a new or split existing rock category by 2027 due to Beyoncé's potential dominance in the rock or alternative music categories, citing her previous success in country music as precedent. The author notes the current confusion in rock categories, exemplified by the inclusion of both Fontaines DC and The Rolling Stones in the same category, and suggests that the Grammys might restructure the rock genre into subcategories—such as 'Trad Rock' (encompassing rock-n-roll, blues rock, yacht rock, and southern rock) and 'Contemporary Rock' (covering punk, alternative rock, and grunge)—or tighten eligibility rules. The article acknowledges there has been no significant category fraud recently, though it briefly references HAIM as a possible exception. The prediction is presented with a speculative tone, emphasizing the cultural impact of Beyoncé’s influence on genre boundaries.

**Country band fresh off hiatus returns with historic honor, first tour in years**
The Band Perry, a Grammy, CMA, and ACM Award-winning country trio, has returned to music after a two-year hiatus, marking their comeback with a hurricane benefit concert in Greeneville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2025. Frontwoman Kimberly Perry described the event as deeply personal, celebrating community and their roots. The band re-signed with Big Machine Label Group in July 2025, with Perry’s husband, Jonny Costello, joining as backing vocalist, replacing her brother Neil, who left to focus on artist management and raising mustangs in Joshua Tree. Reid Perry left the band in October 2025, citing a shift toward the management side of music and a passion for ranch life. Perry emphasized that the transition to a husband-and-wife duo has been seamless, highlighting their complementary strengths—Costello managing the home front and Perry handling the business. The band is currently on a 2026 tour, their first in approximately seven years, with plans to return to the studio to complete a new album, which Perry says is 'very close' to finishing. A social media teaser for a new song—a hand inserting a sword into a heart-shaped cake—has generated buzz, with fans likening it to Taylor Swift’s 'Reputation' era and the song 'Ready or Not.' The band’s 2010 hit 'If I Die Young' achieved Diamond certification (10 million units sold) by the RIAA in November 2025, making Perry the only female artist to solo-write a Diamond-certified country song. The track also won CMA awards for Single and Song of the Year in 2011 and remains culturally resonant, frequently shared in tributes and viral internet trends. The Band Perry previously released gold-certified albums 'Pioneer' (2013) and earned a Grammy for their cover of 'Gentle On My Mind' in 2015. Perry, 42, reflected on her journey, stating that The Band Perry has always been a family band and that this new chapter—'season two'—is both joyful and meaningful.

**Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, K-pop and more: Who will win at the 2026 Grammys?**
The 2026 Grammy Awards, set for February 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and broadcast on CBS and Paramount+, feature a highly competitive lineup. Kendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, followed by Lady Gaga, Jack Antonoff, and Cirkut with seven each. Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny, Leon Thomas, and Serban Ghenea each have six. In Album of the Year, 'GNX' by Kendrick Lamar is seen as a strong contender due to its cultural saturation, sustained engagement, and integration across music, sports, and everyday language, though 'Debí Tirar Más Fotos' by Bad Bunny and 'Mayhem' by Lady Gaga are also strong narrative and artistic choices. For Record of the Year, 'APT.' by Rosé and Bruno Mars is favored for its universal appeal, cross-generational resonance, and global reach, potentially making Rosé the first K-pop artist to win in this category. In Song of the Year, 'Abracadabra' by Lady Gaga is highlighted for its lyrical precision and intentional construction, with a strong chance of victory despite competition from Billie Eilish and Bruno Mars. Best New Artist is a tight race between Leon Thomas, who stands out for his cohesive body of work, and Olivia Dean, whose name has been most frequently mentioned. In Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, 'APT.' is a leading contender due to the balance and cohesion between Rosé and Bruno Mars, though 'Golden' by HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI is also a strong nominee. 'GNX' is considered the clear favorite for Best Rap Album, with strong arguments for its cohesion and cultural dominance. For Best Contemporary Country Album, Jelly Roll’s 'Beautifully Broken' is predicted to win due to its genre-fluid storytelling and emotional authenticity, aligning with the category’s new focus. 'Mutt' by Leon Thomas is the top pick for Best R&B Album, praised for its restraint and songwriting depth. In Best Dance/Electronic Album, Skrillex’s 'F -- U Skrillex You Think Ur Andy Warhol but UR Not! 3' is favored for its balance of innovation and structure. Finally, in Best Latin Pop Album, Karol G’s 'Tropicoqueta' is seen as a forward-moving, culturally specific project with strong potential, though Natalia Lafourcade and Alejandro Sanz remain strong contenders. The Associated Press’ Maria Sherman and Jonathan Landrum Jr. provide in-depth analysis of each category, emphasizing cultural relevance, artistic cohesion, and historical significance.

**Grammys 2026: Bad Bunny and K-Pop Poised to Break Records**
The 68th Annual Grammy Awards, scheduled for February 1, 2026, are poised to break multiple records, according to prediction markets and expert analysis. HUNTR/X, the fictional K-pop group from the Netflix series *K-Pop Demon Hunters*, is the frontrunner to win the first-ever Grammy for a K-pop act, with a 68% win probability on Kalshi, fueled by the viral success of their anthem 'Golden' and its Golden Globe victory. Kelsey Barnes of Schön! Magazine and grammy.com describes a K-pop win as 'symbolic and transformative,' emphasizing the genre's deep cultural roots and artistic complexity, which have long been underrecognized by the Grammys. Bad Bunny's Spanish-language album *Debí Tirar Más Fotos* is also on track for history, with a 61% implied probability of winning Best Album—making it the first exclusively Spanish-language project nominated across Album, Record, and Song of the Year simultaneously. Barnes notes this would signify a shift in the Academy’s recognition of global music, affirming that 'pop is global' and transcends language barriers. Olivia Dean, a rising British soul artist, is favored to become the fourth British female soloist to win Best New Artist, with a 70% win probability, following in the footsteps of Amy Winehouse, Adele, and Dua Lipa. Alexander McCloy attributes her success to her authentic 'Artistic DNA' and strategic international exposure, including opening for Sabrina Carpenter. Bruno Mars is on the verge of matching Lady Gaga’s record of three wins in the Best Pop Duo/Group category, with a potential victory for 'APT.' with ROSÉ. Barnes highlights Mars’ consistent, comforting artistry as a key factor in his enduring appeal, noting that his predictability offers stability in uncertain times.

**Two legends -- a drummer and a rapper -- unite for unexpected musical journey**
John Densmore, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer of The Doors, and Chuck D, founder of Public Enemy and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, have formed a new musical supergroup called doPE, blending their legacies. Their debut album, 'no country for old men,' will be released on April 18, 2026, exclusively as a limited-edition oxblood transparent vinyl through participating local record shops for Record Store Day. The lead single, 'every tick tick tick,' has been named Record Store Day's 2026 Song of the Year in advance of its release. The collaboration began with a chance meeting at a Record Store Day panel in 2014, followed by a direct email from Chuck D in 2015 proposing the project with the phrase: 'You've got the beats, I've got the rhymes, let's make doPE.' Over the next decade, the duo developed the album around the philosophical concept: 'Everybody gets older, but not everybody gets elder,' as reported by Stereogum. Chuck D, 65, described the project as a bridge between generations, stating, 'John Densmore's beat isn't just rhythm, it's history talking,' while Densmore, 81 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner, called the collaboration 'an honor.' The album is characterized as a 'meditation on responsibility, legacy and the bond between generations,' according to American Songwriter.

**Grammys upheaval: Bad Bunny overtakes Lady Gaga in Album of the Year odds in the final stretch**
With less than two weeks until the 68th Grammy Awards, the Album of the Year race has seen a major shift, according to Gold Derby odds. Bad Bunny has risen to the top with a 39.5% chance of winning, surpassing Lady Gaga’s 35.7%. This marks a historic moment as Bad Bunny becomes the first Spanish-language artist nominated in Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year in a single Grammy cycle. He received six nominations in total, including Album of the Year for 'Debí Tirar Más Fotos,' Record of the Year and Song of the Year for 'DTMF,' Best Música Urbana Album, Best Global Music Performance, and Best Album Cover. He previously won three Grammys in the Música Urbana category and one for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album. Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, is vying for Album of the Year with 'Mayhem,' Record of the Year and Song of the Year for 'Abracadabra,' and other categories. She has 14 Grammy wins, including her most recent in Best Pop Duo/Group Performance ('Die With a Smile') and Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album (Love for Sale). Sabrina Carpenter is third with a 17.9% chance, thanks to six nominations including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year for 'Manchild.' Kendrick Lamar, with nine nominations—the most of any artist this cycle—holds a 5.5% chance, having already won 22 Grammys, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for 'Not Like Us.' The remaining four nominees—Justin Bieber’s 'Swag,' Clipse’s 'Let God Sort Em Out,' Tyler the Creator’s 'Chromakopia,' and Leon Thomas’ 'Mutt'—each have less than 1% odds. The ceremony will be hosted by Trevor Noah for the sixth and final time at the Crypto.com Arena on February 1, 2026.

**Do the Grammys Have a Country Music Problem?**
The article examines a growing disconnect between country music and the Grammy Awards, particularly in the Big Four categories (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist). For 2025, zero country or country-adjacent artists received nominations in these top categories, despite country’s significant commercial growth and critical acclaim. The article highlights that while country has seen rising popularity and strong performances by artists like Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney, Ella Langley, and Zach Top—each receiving multiple CMA nominations—none were nominated at the Grammys. Lainey Wilson, in particular, has been repeatedly overlooked despite widespread critical and commercial success, including winning a country Grammy in 2024, which made her ineligible for Best New Artist. The article notes a historical trend: since 2011, only two country songs have been nominated in Record of the Year, and the last nomination for a traditional country artist in Album of the Year was Chris Stapleton’s 'Traveller' in 2015. While the Recording Academy has made progress in down-ballot country categories—such as splitting Best Country Album into Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Country—the top tiers remain largely inaccessible. The article suggests systemic issues, including voter disinterest, a lack of demographic diversity among voters, and the genre’s focus on the CMAs and ACMs as primary recognition platforms. It argues that the Grammys’ failure to recognize country’s dominant female artists reflects a broader institutional bias, despite country’s cultural and commercial relevance. The piece concludes by urging the Recording Academy to expand its voter base and recognize the genre’s creative renaissance, especially the rise of women in country music.

**For country music traditionalists, Grammy changes promise a brighter spotlight**
The Grammy Awards are splitting the Best Country Album category into two separate categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, effective next year. This change, announced on November 7, 2025, follows years of advocacy by traditional country artists and supporters like Kyle Coroneos of Saving Country Music and NPR’s Jewly Hight. The move aims to provide greater recognition for artists whose music leans toward classic country sensibilities, such as Sunny Sweeney, whose 2024 album 'Rhinestone Requiem' was not eligible under the old category. Sweeney reported receiving 7,000 text messages within 10 minutes of the announcement, reflecting widespread excitement among traditionalists. While artists like Zach Top, a mainstream country hitmaker with classic influences, welcome the new category as a validation of their sound, others like Charley Crockett express discomfort with genre labeling, questioning whether his work fits neatly into 'traditional' or 'contemporary' despite his rootsy style. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of The Recording Academy, emphasized that changes are driven by community input and proposals, not arbitrary decisions. The first five nominees for Best Traditional Country Album will be announced the following day. The shift reflects a broader effort to address historical marginalization of traditional country music within the mainstream industry and awards landscape.

**A Home For Tradition: The Grammys Get A New Country Category [Interview]**
The Recording Academy announced the addition of the 'Best Traditional Country Album' category to the Grammy Awards, effective in 2025, following a multi-year, member-driven process. This change redefines the existing 'Best Country Album' category as 'Best Contemporary Country Album' to better distinguish between traditional and modern country music. The new category aims to recognize artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hoffman, whose work does not fit mainstream country. According to Shelly Maree of the Recording Academy, the proposal was under review for about three years, with data collection beginning two years prior and final approval in spring 2025. The category defines traditional country by adherence to classic sound structures, including steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, live drums, and subgenres like western, western swing, and outlaw country. The Academy emphasizes that evaluation is based on the music, not the artist, and that an artist may be classified differently in different years depending on their album. The move is intended to create a more inclusive and representative platform, encouraging underrepresented artists to join the Academy and gain visibility. Maree notes that Grammy recognition can significantly boost streams and public awareness, especially for independent or traditionally rooted artists not widely played on commercial radio. The Academy also highlights that similar dual categories already exist in blues, R&B, and pop, affirming that this structure is not new but necessary for country’s broad spectrum. The change reflects a broader effort to listen to the music community and adapt to the genre’s diversity.

**Jelly Roll, Zach Top & No Morgan Wallen: Inside the Grammy Race for Contemporary & Traditional Country Albums**
The Recording Academy has split the Grammy Award for Best Country Album into two distinct categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, marking the first time two country albums will be honored in the country field. This change aligns country categories with other genres like R&B, pop, and blues, which already separate contemporary and traditional works. The split has led to a significant increase in entries, with 68 albums submitted for contemporary and 62 for traditional, up from 79 total last year. The traditional category includes recordings adhering to classic country structures, instrumentation (e.g., acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo), and sub-genres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country. It features strong contenders such as Willie Nelson’s 'Oh What a Beautiful World,' Lukas Nelson’s 'American Romance,' Parker McCollum’s self-titled album, Jamey Johnson’s 'Midnight Gasoline,' Cody Jinks’ 'In My Blood,' George Strait’s 'Cowboys and Dreamers,' Margo Price’s 'Hardheaded Woman,' Trisha Yearwood’s 'The Mirror,' and Turnpike Troubadours’ 'The Price of Admission.' The contemporary category, defined as music reflecting the broad spectrum of modern country style and culture, includes top contenders like Tyler Childers’ 'Snipe Hunter,' Miranda Lambert’s 'Postcards From Texas,' Jelly Roll’s 'Beautifully Broken,' Kelsea Ballerini’s 'Patterns,' and Eric Church’s 'Evangeline vs. the Machine.' Notably, Morgan Wallen’s 'I'm the Problem,' the year’s biggest country album, was not submitted, removing a major contender. Other potential nominees include Tucker Wetmore’s 'What Not To' and Riley Green’s deluxe 'Don’t Mind If I Do.' First-round voting ends October 15, nominations are announced November 7, final-round voting runs December 12 to January 5, and the 68th Grammy Awards will be held on February 1, 2026.

**Entries for the Grammys Traditional Country Category Are Here**
The 68th Annual Grammy Awards are set for Sunday, February 1, 2026. The Recording Academy has introduced a new Best Traditional Country Album category for the 2026 Grammys, announced in June, which many fans believe is a response to Beyoncé’s 2025 Best Country Album win. As of October 11, 2025, the entry ballot is live, featuring over 30 artists competing for nomination. Active Recording Academy members will vote through October 15 to narrow the list, with official nominees to be announced on Friday, November 7, 2025. Among the artists reportedly up for the Traditional Country Album category are independent acts like Charley Crockett, Margo Price, and the Turnpike Troubadours; country legends including Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, and George Strait; and mainstream artists such as Zach Top, The Castellows, and Parker McCollum. The Best Contemporary Country Album category is expected to include Riley Green, Tyler Childers, and potentially Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, and Cody Johnson, based on the Country Music Association Awards (CMAs) as a predictor. The announcement of nominees is pending official voting.

**The Grammys Rewrote Their Rules After Beyoncé's Historic Best Country Album Win**
In 2025, Beyoncé made history by winning the Grammy for Best Country Album, becoming the first Black woman to do so. Her win, which she described as unexpected, sparked widespread reaction and meme culture, especially after her visibly stunned reaction and a nudge from her daughter, Blue Ivy. Beyoncé credited the win to the country artists who contributed to her album, 'Cowboy Carter,' and criticized genre boundaries as tools to marginalize artists, urging others to pursue their passions persistently. The win prompted backlash within the country music community, leading the Recording Academy to split the Best Country Album category into Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album starting in 2026. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, stated the change was driven by country artists themselves seeking greater recognition across subgenres, aligning country with other genres' award structures. This move followed a similar change after Beyoncé won Best Dance/Electronic Record for 'Renaissance,' which led to the creation of the Best Pop Dance Record category. Beyoncé also won Album of the Year for 'Cowboy Carter,' which she said was inspired by her past exclusion from the country genre. She revealed on Instagram that her experience of not feeling welcomed in country music led her to deeply study its history, ultimately creating a work that celebrates its roots and unites diverse voices. Her performance of 'Daddy Lessons' with the Chicks at the CMA Awards drew criticism, with some arguing she shouldn’t have been invited, but Beyoncé stated these criticisms fueled her artistic evolution, allowing her to challenge genre limitations and blend styles in 'Act II' of her work.

**Entries to Grammy's New Traditional Country Category Look Very Promising**
The ballot for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards has been released, featuring a newly introduced Best Traditional Country Album category, which aims to elevate authentic country artists often marginalized in favor of contemporary or pop-influenced acts. The category, with an eligibility period from August 31, 2024, to August 30, 2025, includes 68 entries—more than the 62 in the Best Contemporary Country Album category—indicating strong participation. Prominent independent and traditional country artists are well-represented, including Charley Crockett ('Dollar A Day'), Cody Jinks ('In My Blood'), Margo Price ('Hard Headed Woman'), Turnpike Troubadours ('The Price of Admission'), and Jesse Daniel ('Son Of The San Lorenzo'). Country legends such as Willie Nelson ('Oh What A Beautiful World'), George Strait ('Cowboys And Dreamers'), Dwight Yoakam ('Brighter Days'), Trisha Yearwood ('The Mirror'), and Asleep At The Wheel ('Riding High In Texas') are also in contention. Women in traditional country are making a strong showing with Sunny Sweeney ('Rhinestone Requiem'), Shawna Thompson ('Lean On Neon'), Kristina Murray ('Little Blue'), Kelsey Waldon ('Every Ghost'), and Hailey Whitters ('Corn Queen'). Mainstream traditionalists like Zach Top ('Ain't In It For My Health'), The Castellows ('Homecoming'), Kameron Marlowe ('Sad Songs For The Soul'), Ashland Craft ('Dive Bar Beauty Queen'), and Parker McCollum ('Parker McCollum') are included, proving the category isn't limited to independent acts. Underground and lesser-known artists such as Benjamin Tod ('Shooting Star'), JP Harris ('JP Harris Is A Trash Fire'), Joshua Ray Walker ('Tropicana'), Caleb Klauder & Reeb Willms ('Gold In Your Pocket'), and The Doohickeys ('All Hat No Cattle') are also featured. Subgenres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country are represented by Marcedes Carroll ('We Lost Track Of The Stars'), Ian Munsick ('Eagle Feather'), Tris Munsick & The Innocents ('Big Medicine Moon'), Sterling Drake ('The Shape I'm In'), and Ned LeDoux ('Safe Haven'). The nominees will be announced on November 7, 2025. The Best Contemporary Country Album category remains competitive, with artists like Tyler Childers and Riley Green among the entries, suggesting that 'country' authenticity is still strong in both categories. Artists must submit their work for consideration, and the high number of entries signals growing engagement in the new traditional category.

**2026 GRAMMYs: More than 1,000 songs battle for eight nomination slots**
The 2026 Grammy Awards are seeing intense competition in the Song of the Year category, with 1,015 entries—making it the most competitive category in Grammy history. This surpasses last year’s 978 submissions and far exceeds the 48 entries in Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, the lowest number recorded. Voting by Recording Academy members opened on October 3, 2025, and closes on October 15. Nominations will be announced on November 7, 2025, with the main ceremony set for February 1, 2026, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Other categories also saw shifts: Record of the Year rose to 894 entries, Best New Artist to 337, and Songwriter of the Year (Non Classical) to 63. Conversely, Album of the Year declined from 707 to 686 entries, and Producer of the Year (Non Classical) dropped from 200 to 161. Two new categories were introduced: Best Traditional Country Album (68 entries) and Best Album Cover (68 entries), with traditional country outpacing contemporary country (62 entries). While no category fell below the 40-entry minimum required for five nominees, the soundtrack category is near the threshold. Five specialized categories—Best Album Cover, Best Recording Package, Best Album Notes, Best Historical Album, and Best Immersive Audio Album—will be decided by committees rather than voters. Final round voting runs from December 12 to January 5, 2026, with winners announced live during the ceremony.

### Grammy Award for Best Traditional Country Album
The Grammy Award for Best Traditional Country Album is an award presented by the Recording Academy to honor quality traditional country music music performances in any given year. The award is scheduled to be presented for the first time at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in 2026, as a complement to the newly renamed Best Contemporary Country Album category, and sits in the Country & American Roots genre field. The academy announced the new category in June 2025, stating that the award “recognizes excellence in albums of traditional country music, both vocal and instrumental. Traditional country includes country recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation such as acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar, and live drums. It also includes sub-genres such as Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country.” The award goes to the artist(s), producer(s), and mixers(s) of the album.

It was noted that a proposal for the category had been submitted several times previously before being passed, and that it was created to honor a wider range of artists who fall outside of the commercial mainstream country music scene based in Nashville, and highlighted a need to separate these artists from those making Americana, roots, and folk music, who were all competing in the over-subscribed American Roots categories. The Academy specifically highlighted artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hofmann, the former two having previously been nominated in Americana categories, and the general growth in popularity of country and its subgenres as reasons why the category was approved. The Academy also noted that the separation of the Best Country Album category brings the genre into line with other genres, such as R&B, Pop, and Blues, which all have distinct categories honoring Traditional and Contemporary styles. Regarding the establishment of this category, which was announced alongside Best Album Cover, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. stated: “The community of people that are making country music in all different subgenres came to us with a proposal and said we would like to have more variety in how our music is honored. They said, we think we need more space for our music to be celebrated and honored. It makes country parallel with what’s happening in other genres, but it is also creating space for where this genre is going

There are obviously nuances between the different genres. Those experts in those genres understand those nuances, and I’m quite certain now you’re going to see the right people going into Americana versus folk versus traditional country. [The change] gives us an opportunity to put things in more specific categories.” The introduction of the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Country Album category received mixed reception from music journalists and country music commentators. Some writers noted that the timing of the category's creation closely followed the release and commercial success of Beyoncé's 2024 album Cowboy Carter, which prominently incorporated country music traditions while challenging cultural assumptions surrounding the genre. Critics of the new category argued that separating “traditional” country risks reinforcing cultural and racial boundaries within the genre, potentially positioning artists who do not conform to historical genre norms as “outsiders.” Supporters of the category argue that establishing a formal distinction preserves traditional instrumentation, songwriting structures, and performance practices within country music history. ^[I] Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.

### Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Country Album
The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Country Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality albums in the country music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position". The award was first presented under the name of Best Country & Western Album in 1966 to Roger Miller for Dang Me/Chug-A-Lug and was discontinued the following year. In 1995 the category was revived and was presented as Best Country Album until 2025 before receiving its current denomination at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in 2026 alongside the debut of a sister category Best Traditional Country Album. According to the category description guide for the 68th Grammy Awards (2026), the award "recognizes contemporary country music recordings, both vocal and instrumental, which utilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture. The intent is to recognize country music that remains reminiscent and relevant to the legacy of country music’s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms." The Chicks are the most awarded performers in this category with four wins, followed by Chris Stapleton who has three wins. Two-time award winners include Roger Miller, Lady A, Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Canadian singer Shania Twain is the only non-American winner in this category, to date. Trisha Yearwood holds the record for most nominations, with eight. Yearwood also holds the record for most nominations without a win.
