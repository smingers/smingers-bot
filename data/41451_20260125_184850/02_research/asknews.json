This growing movement, fueled by a new generation of artists, blends traditional Kenyan culture with country music through cowboy boots, nostalgic melodies, and lyrics in local languages such as Kikuyu. The phenomenon is not merely a trend but a cultural shift, as highlighted by artists like 'Sir Elvis' Otieno, who links country music to his family\u2019s musical heritage and local identity. Otieno, born in 1977\u2014the year Elvis Presley died\u2014grew up surrounded by vinyls and cassettes, learning guitar from his father. His performances, including a rendition of Don Williams\u2019 'It Must Be Love,' have drawn enthusiastic crowds in Nairobi, echoing scenes from Nashville. In 2002, Ythera Wildflower gained recognition for her Kikuyu-language cover of Dolly Parton\u2019s 'Coat of Many Colors,' blending local dialect with country style. Historical roots trace back to colonial-era interactions between European settlers and Kikuyu laborers, who adopted the genre, initially calling it 'music for the rich.' By 2025, Nairobi celebrated its first International Cowboy and Cowgirl Day, featuring parades of cowboy hats and boots. The 2024 release of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album 'Cowboy Carter' further accelerated the genre\u2019s global revival, inspiring a surge in country music events across Kenya.

However, modern couples increasingly choose music that reflects their personal identity, love story, and wedding mood instead of traditional pieces. Today's wedding playlists are far more diverse than just ten years ago, featuring film soundtracks, contemporary pop, indie hits, and rock ballads. Key trends include individuality and emotional authenticity over strict adherence to tradition. Popular choices include romantic pop ballads by Ed Sheeran ('Perfect', 'Thinking Out Loud') and John Legend ('All of Me'), as well as instrumental film scores by Hans Zimmer and themes from movies like 'Am\u00e9lie', 'The Notebook', and 'Twilight'. A growing trend is the use of Ukrainian-language songs by artists such as Kuzma Skryabin, Okean Elzy, Khristyna Soloviy, Jamala, and Jerry Heil, used to affirm cultural identity. For informal outdoor weddings, acoustic and indie versions of popular songs\u2014often performed live by musicians\u2014are favored. Some couples even select songs tied to personal milestones, such as the moment they met or confessed love, prioritizing emotional resonance over genre or popularity. For those seeking alternatives to Mendelssohn\u2019s march, recommended pieces include Wagner\u2019s 'Bridal Chorus' from 'Lohengrin', Pachelbel\u2019s 'Canon in D', Bach\u2019s 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring', Elgar\u2019s 'Salut d'Amour', Debussy\u2019s 'Clair de Lune', Schubert\u2019s 'Ave Maria', and modern instrumental arrangements like 'A Thousand Years' by Christina Perri or 'River Flows in You' by Yiruma. The article also references previous coverage on wedding statistics in early 2025 and celebrity unions, including Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource: [\u0424\u041e\u041a\u0423\u0421](https://focus.ua/uk/lifestyle/741351-pisni-na-vesillya-yaku-muziku-obirayut-dlya-ceremoniji)\n\n**After 'costume invasions' in street carnival, brands revisit classic fantasies**\nThis year, traditional carnival costumes such as pirate, colombina, pierr\u00f4, and clown outfits are regaining prominence in fashion collections, reflecting a broader trend among designers. The brand Ohlograma, founded by Clarissa Romancini, exemplifies this shift, with the designer stating she sought to reconnect with the emotional memories of her childhood, moving away from cultural appropriations like indigenous motifs and baiana attire. Instead, classic figures like the dancer, bunny, and sailor are now in vogue, described as 'much more playful and fun.' According to Tiago Ribeiro, author of 'Os blocos do carnaval carioca,' carnival costumes were introduced to Rio's street carnival in the mid-19th century, influenced by French and Italian carnivals, serving both an ornate and didactic purpose. In the past, those without resources created makeshift costumes, but today, the focus has shifted toward visual 'beauty' over character representation, driven in part by social media's influence on visual culture. Historical patterns show that such shifts are not new\u2014Ribeiro found reports from the late 1950s claiming the disappearance of street blocos, though in reality, they had only evolved, much like today\u2019s blocos that feature pop music acts like Katy Perry.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:30 AM\nSource: [O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/ela/gente/noticia/2026/01/25/depois-de-a-montacao-invadir-o-carnaval-de-rua-marcas-revisitam-fantasias-classicas.ghtml)\n\n**ICH 'Trend' Rises in Horse Year: Craftsmanship Lights Up Haizhou\u2019s New Year Spirit**\nIn Lianyungang City's Haizhou District, a surge in intangible cultural heritage (ICH) activities has energized the festive atmosphere ahead of the Year of the Horse. Traditional crafts such as leatherwork, textile embroidery, dough modeling, and pottery have incorporated horse-themed elements, becoming popular choices for New Year gifts and home decoration. At the Keer Shi Leather Workshop, fourth-generation ICH inheritor Cheng Junjie crafts handmade horse leather ornaments, with daily production limited to 3\u20135 pieces due to the labor-intensive process, making them highly collectible. Orders for small horse leather items priced between 100 and 200 yuan have increased significantly since the start of the year, with 2\u20134 orders per day. At Li Qiuhong\u2019s embroidery shop, traditional cut-velvet shoe insoles and horse-themed accessories like 'Ma Shang You Qian' (implying 'money comes quickly') designs are in high demand, reflecting the cultural significance of blessings and prosperity. Dough modeling artist Xu Shu shu creates vibrant, lifelike horse figurines using a four-step technique\u2014pressing, pinching, inlaying, and rolling\u2014within minutes. Meanwhile, at the 'Shizhi' pottery studio, demand for horse-themed ceramics such as figurines, fridge magnets, and mugs has surged, with customers also engaging in hands-on workshops to experience the craft firsthand. The revitalization of these ICH practices is supported by Haizhou District\u2019s 'Local Talent Recruitment Program' and incentives such as subsidies and tax reductions, attracting renowned artisans like Zhou Cunyu (Jiangsu ICH copper forging) and Xu Shu shu. The district\u2019s efforts have enabled ICH projects to 'enter, stay, and thrive' in the historic Minzhu Road Street, blending tradition with modern demand and demonstrating cultural confidence through the sustainable coexistence of heritage and market vitality.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 01:09 PM\nSource: [\u626c\u5b50\u7f51\uff08\u626c\u5b50\u665a\u62a5\uff09](https://www.yangtse.com/news/jiangsu/202601/t20260124_314906.html)\n\n**Country band fresh off hiatus returns with historic honor, first tour in years**\nThe Band Perry, a Grammy, CMA, and ACM Award-winning country trio, has returned to music after a two-year hiatus, marking their comeback with a hurricane benefit concert in Greeneville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2025. Frontwoman Kimberly Perry described the event as deeply personal, celebrating community and their roots. The band re-signed with Big Machine Label Group in July 2025, with Perry\u2019s husband, Jonny Costello, joining as backing vocalist, replacing her brother Neil, who left to focus on artist management and raising mustangs in Joshua Tree.

Perry emphasized that the transition to a husband-and-wife duo has been seamless, highlighting their complementary strengths\u2014Costello managing the home front and Perry handling the business. The band is currently on a 2026 tour, their first in approximately seven years, with plans to return to the studio to complete a new album, which Perry says is 'very close' to finishing. A social media teaser for a new song\u2014a hand inserting a sword into a heart-shaped cake\u2014has generated buzz, with fans likening it to Taylor Swift\u2019s 'Reputation' era and the song 'Ready or Not.' The band\u2019s 2010 hit 'If I Die Young' achieved Diamond certification (10 million units sold) by the RIAA in November 2025, making Perry the only female artist to solo-write a Diamond-certified country song. The track also won CMA awards for Single and Song of the Year in 2011 and remains culturally resonant, frequently shared in tributes and viral internet trends. The Band Perry previously released gold-certified albums 'Pioneer' (2013) and earned a Grammy for their cover of 'Gentle On My Mind' in 2015.

Despite the dominance of AI-generated music and algorithm-driven hooks, these artists are redefining pop with complex arrangements, orchestral elements, and emotionally raw, authentic storytelling. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s album 'Lux', recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra and sung in 14 languages, blends art-pop with classical and spiritual themes. Raye, after breaking free from her label Polydor Records, released her independent album 'My 21st Century Blues', which confronts trauma, addiction, and identity, earning her six Brit Awards in a single ceremony. Olivia Dean\u2019s music draws from 1980s soul and Motown, evoking nostalgia that resonates across generations. Experts Derek von Krogh (Popakademie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) and Dr. Pop (musicologist and comedian) argue that the human voice, emotional authenticity, and political provocation remain beyond AI\u2019s reach. They identify three key trends shaping pop\u2019s future: nostalgic aesthetics, genre hybridization, and a growing demand for handcrafted, soulful music. The Windrush Generation\u2019s historical struggle is also referenced as a source of lyrical depth in contemporary music. The article concludes with optimism: pop music is becoming more artistically courageous, politically engaged, and emotionally resonant.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 05:24 PM\nSource: [WEB.DE](https://web.de/magazine/unterhaltung/musik/erleben-gerade-revolution-popmusik-41783968)\n\n**Orquestra Afrosinf\u00f4nica: The Unique Fusion of Afro-Brazilian and Symphonic Traditions**\nThe Orquestra Afrosinf\u00f4nica, founded in 2010 in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, is a unique ensemble blending Afro-Brazilian musical traditions with symphonic instrumentation. Led by mestre Ubiratan Marques, a pianist, composer, and educator raised in a deeply musical environment rooted in Afro-Brazilian culture and regional traditions, the orchestra was born from a vision to address the lack of symphonic ensembles celebrating Afro-Brazilian heritage. Based in the renovated Casa Ponte, the orchestra functions as a community-driven conservatory, promoting local talent and cultural expression. Its sound integrates traditional symphonic instruments with Afro-Brazilian percussion and vocal elements central to terreiro practices, aiming to 'translate a little of this Afro-indigenous Brazil' and give voice to African-derived languages silenced by history. The orchestra has released two albums: 'Branco' (2015), honoring the deity Oxal\u00e1, and 'Or\u00edn' (2020), which earned a Latin Grammy nomination and was designed by artist Vik Muniz. The upcoming third album, co-directed by Ubiratan and BaianaSystem\u2019s Russo Passapusso, will feature reinterpreted classics from eight Afro-Brazilian blocos of Salvador, with a more accessible, pop-oriented language aimed at broader public resonance. The album is planned for recording in March 2026, following Carnival, and release in November. Despite its cultural impact, the orchestra faces challenges in sustainability due to the absence of public funding, particularly amid the 2026 Brazilian presidential election cycle.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 09:03 AM\nSource: [RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/musique/20260123-orquestra-afrosinfonica-la-fusion-unique-de-traditions-musicales-afro-br%C3%A9siliennes-et-symphoniques)\n\n**Two legends -- a drummer and a rapper -- unite for unexpected musical journey**\nJohn Densmore, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer of The Doors, and Chuck D, founder of Public Enemy and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, have formed a new musical supergroup called doPE, blending their legacies. Their debut album, 'no country for old men,' will be released on April 18, 2026, exclusively as a limited-edition oxblood transparent vinyl through participating local record shops for Record Store Day. The lead single, 'every tick tick tick,' has been named Record Store Day's 2026 Song of the Year in advance of its release. The collaboration began with a chance meeting at a Record Store Day panel in 2014, followed by a direct email from Chuck D in 2015 proposing the project with the phrase: 'You've got the beats, I've got the rhymes, let's make doPE.' Over the next decade, the duo developed the album around the philosophical concept: 'Everybody gets older, but not everybody gets elder,' as reported by Stereogum. Chuck D, 65, described the project as a bridge between generations, stating, 'John Densmore's beat isn't just rhythm, it's history talking,' while Densmore, 81 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner, called the collaboration 'an honor.' The album is characterized as a 'meditation on responsibility, legacy and the bond between generations,' according to American Songwriter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:45 PM\nSource: [MassLive](https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2026/01/two-legends-a-drummer-and-a-rapper-unite-for-unexpected-musical-journey.html)\n\n**Ten Eastern German Traditions Lost: How Western Firms Closed Historic East German Businesses**\nThe article highlights a growing trend in eastern Germany where large western or international corporations have acquired traditional eastern German businesses and subsequently closed them, sparking public frustration and political concern. Ten specific cases are detailed: Haribo shut down its Wilkau-Ha\u00dflau factory in 2020, ending 120 years of confectionery production and dismissing 150 workers; Melitta closed its 226-year-old paper mill in Neu-Kali\u00df due to a 'consistently poor business situation'; J\u00e4germeister\u2019s glass supplier, Owens-Illinois, ceased operations in Bernsdorf in 2025 after 150 years; Henkel closed its 108-year-old adhesive plant in Heidenau, despite CEO Carsten Knobel\u2019s public assurances in 2024 that no German plants would close; the Uhlen GmbH\u2019s slaughterhouse in Perleberg was shut after a Bundeskartellamt investigation into potential anti-competitive behavior; S\u00fcdzucker AG closed its Brottewitz sugar factory in 2019 after the end of the EU sugar market regime; Andros shut down the Spreewaldkonserve gherkin factory in Gol\u00dfen, citing a 'difficult market environment' despite recent wage improvements; Continental closed its 155-year-old rubber plant in Bad Blankenburg, citing declining demand, though the company reported strong profits; Tatravag\u00f3nka shut down the Niesky wagon factory in 2023 after years of declining orders; and T\u00f6nnies closed the Eberswalder Wurstwerke in Britz in 2026, just three years after acquisition, using a legal loophole to avoid full severance payments. Workers and communities express deep disappointment, citing lost livelihoods, identity, and trust. The article warns of rising unemployment in eastern Germany (projected 1% increase by 2026) and growing political instability, particularly with the AfD gaining strength in upcoming state elections.

The show's influence extended to related streaming content, merchandise (including jewelry by Kendra Scott and eyewear from Diff), and The Four Sixes Ranch Steakhouse at Wynn Las Vegas, named after a Texas ranch owned by show creator Taylor Sheridan. The trend was further amplified by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2024 'Cowboy Carter' album, which featured a rodeo-inspired cover and brought greater diversity to the movement. CBS\u2019s 'The Road,' a series showcasing aspiring country musicians competing for Keith Urban, also contributed to the resurgence, with performances in cities like Dallas and Nashville. Modern Western wear is rooted in heritage and lifestyle rather than the flashy 'Urban Cowboy' style of the 1980s. In Denver, vintage Western wear retailers like The Shop Outpost, Hats by Parker Thomas, and Rancher Hat Bar cater to a 25\u201340 age group, offering customization events such as hat parties. Western wear was featured at Denver Fashion Week in November, with runway shows by Rockmount Ranch Wear, Bailey Heyman, Spytful, and April & West. The Double D Ranchwear fashion show, organized by Angela S. Lieurance of Women of the National Western, grew from a pop-up into a major event attended by 200 women. Tara Kaufman, associate curator at History Colorado, notes that Western wear is a hybrid aesthetic shaped by Spanish, Native American, Mexican, and European influences, making it a versatile expression of American identity. The style\u2019s functionality\u2014such as pointed-toe boots for riding and wide-brim hats for sun protection\u2014adds to its appeal. Colorado\u2019s historical role in Western wear is underscored by the founding of major brands like Miller Stockman and Rockmount Ranch Wear. Key Western-themed venues in Denver include Belles & Boots, The Grizzly Rose, Neon Cowboy, The Buckhorn Exchange, The Fort, and the Urban Cowboy Hotel, which has locations in Nashville, Brooklyn, and the Catskills.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 12:50 PM\nSource: [The Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/21/western-fashion-stock-show-denver/)\n\n**AP Trending SummaryBrief at 6:17 p.m. EST**\nThe article is a collection of brief news updates covering multiple topics.

This change follows Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s historic win for her country album Cowboy Carter in 2024, which many see as a catalyst for broader genre recognition. Claire Heinichen, Senior Editor for Country at Spotify, describes Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s success as a 'wake-up call' that the genre deserved more representation. Artists like Kelsea Ballerini, whose album Patterns blends pop and country storytelling, and Jelly Roll, known for his pop-crossover appeal and generational connection, are seen as strong contenders. However, the race is expected to center on Tyler Childers\u2019 Snipe Hunter and Eric Church\u2019s Evangeline vs. the Machine. Childers\u2019 album, praised for its gritty songwriting and bold themes\u2014including a track about spreading rabies\u2014reclaims his Purgatory-era authenticity. Church\u2019s record, blending 1970s rock with country, features orchestral arrangements and spiritual undertones, marking his most ambitious work yet. Church, an 11-time nominee without a win, is widely viewed as a likely first-time Grammy recipient in this category.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource: [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/2026-grammys-predictions-best-contemporary-country-album-1235478465/)\n\n**Do the Grammys Have a Country Music Problem?**\nThe article examines a growing disconnect between country music and the Grammy Awards, particularly in the Big Four categories (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist). For 2025, zero country or country-adjacent artists received nominations in these top categories, despite country\u2019s significant commercial growth and critical acclaim. The article highlights that while country has seen rising popularity and strong performances by artists like Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney, Ella Langley, and Zach Top\u2014each receiving multiple CMA nominations\u2014none were nominated at the Grammys. Lainey Wilson, in particular, has been repeatedly overlooked despite widespread critical and commercial success, including winning a country Grammy in 2024, which made her ineligible for Best New Artist. The article notes a historical trend: since 2011, only two country songs have been nominated in Record of the Year, and the last nomination for a traditional country artist in Album of the Year was Chris Stapleton\u2019s 'Traveller' in 2015. While the Recording Academy has made progress in down-ballot country categories\u2014such as splitting Best Country Album into Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Country\u2014the top tiers remain largely inaccessible. The article suggests systemic issues, including voter disinterest, a lack of demographic diversity among voters, and the genre\u2019s focus on the CMAs and ACMs as primary recognition platforms. It argues that the Grammys\u2019 failure to recognize country\u2019s dominant female artists reflects a broader institutional bias, despite country\u2019s cultural and commercial relevance. The piece concludes by urging the Recording Academy to expand its voter base and recognize the genre\u2019s creative renaissance, especially the rise of women in country music.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource: [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/music/news/grammys-country-music-problem-1236575130/)\n\n**For country music traditionalists, Grammy changes promise a brighter spotlight**\nThe Grammy Awards are splitting the Best Country Album category into two separate categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, effective next year. This change, announced on November 7, 2025, follows years of advocacy by traditional country artists and supporters like Kyle Coroneos of Saving Country Music and NPR\u2019s Jewly Hight. The move aims to provide greater recognition for artists whose music leans toward classic country sensibilities, such as Sunny Sweeney, whose 2024 album 'Rhinestone Requiem' was not eligible under the old category. Sweeney reported receiving 7,000 text messages within 10 minutes of the announcement, reflecting widespread excitement among traditionalists. While artists like Zach Top, a mainstream country hitmaker with classic influences, welcome the new category as a validation of their sound, others like Charley Crockett express discomfort with genre labeling, questioning whether his work fits neatly into 'traditional' or 'contemporary' despite his rootsy style. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of The Recording Academy, emphasized that changes are driven by community input and proposals, not arbitrary decisions. The first five nominees for Best Traditional Country Album will be announced the following day. The shift reflects a broader effort to address historical marginalization of traditional country music within the mainstream industry and awards landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 04:43 PM\nSource: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5596419/grammy-nominations-country-music-traditional-contemporary)\n\n**A Home For Tradition: The Grammys Get A New Country Category [Interview]**\nThe Recording Academy announced the addition of the 'Best Traditional Country Album' category to the Grammy Awards, effective in 2025, following a multi-year, member-driven process. This change redefines the existing 'Best Country Album' category as 'Best Contemporary Country Album' to better distinguish between traditional and modern country music. The new category aims to recognize artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hoffman, whose work does not fit mainstream country. According to Shelly Maree of the Recording Academy, the proposal was under review for about three years, with data collection beginning two years prior and final approval in spring 2025. The category defines traditional country by adherence to classic sound structures, including steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, live drums, and subgenres like western, western swing, and outlaw country. The Academy emphasizes that evaluation is based on the music, not the artist, and that an artist may be classified differently in different years depending on their album. The move is intended to create a more inclusive and representative platform, encouraging underrepresented artists to join the Academy and gain visibility. Maree notes that Grammy recognition can significantly boost streams and public awareness, especially for independent or traditionally rooted artists not widely played on commercial radio. The Academy also highlights that similar dual categories already exist in blues, R&B, and pop, affirming that this structure is not new but necessary for country\u2019s broad spectrum. The change reflects a broader effort to listen to the music community and adapt to the genre\u2019s diversity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource: [musicrow.com](https://musicrow.com/2025/11/a-home-for-tradition-the-grammys-get-a-new-country-category-interview/)\n\n**Jelly Roll, Zach Top & No Morgan Wallen: Inside the Grammy Race for Contemporary & Traditional Country Albums**\nThe Recording Academy has split the Grammy Award for Best Country Album into two distinct categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, marking the first time two country albums will be honored in the country field. This change aligns country categories with other genres like R&B, pop, and blues, which already separate contemporary and traditional works. The split has led to a significant increase in entries, with 68 albums submitted for contemporary and 62 for traditional, up from 79 total last year. The traditional category includes recordings adhering to classic country structures, instrumentation (e.g., acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo), and sub-genres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country. It features strong contenders such as Willie Nelson\u2019s 'Oh What a Beautiful World,' Lukas Nelson\u2019s 'American Romance,' Parker McCollum\u2019s self-titled album, Jamey Johnson\u2019s 'Midnight Gasoline,' Cody Jinks\u2019 'In My Blood,' George Strait\u2019s 'Cowboys and Dreamers,' Margo Price\u2019s 'Hardheaded Woman,' Trisha Yearwood\u2019s 'The Mirror,' and Turnpike Troubadours\u2019 'The Price of Admission.' The contemporary category, defined as music reflecting the broad spectrum of modern country style and culture, includes top contenders like Tyler Childers\u2019 'Snipe Hunter,' Miranda Lambert\u2019s 'Postcards From Texas,' Jelly Roll\u2019s 'Beautifully Broken,' Kelsea Ballerini\u2019s 'Patterns,' and Eric Church\u2019s 'Evangeline vs. the Machine.' Notably, Morgan Wallen\u2019s 'I'm the Problem,' the year\u2019s biggest country album, was not submitted, removing a major contender. Other potential nominees include Tucker Wetmore\u2019s 'What Not To' and Riley Green\u2019s deluxe 'Don\u2019t Mind If I Do.' First-round voting ends October 15, nominations are announced November 7, final-round voting runs December 12 to January 5, and the 68th Grammy Awards will be held on February 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource: [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammy-race-for-contemporary-and-traditional-country-albums-1236089699/)\n\n**The Grammys Rewrote Their Rules After Beyonc\u00e9's Historic Best Country Album Win**\nIn 2025, Beyonc\u00e9 made history by winning the Grammy for Best Country Album, becoming the first Black woman to do so. Her win, which she described as unexpected, sparked widespread reaction and meme culture, especially after her visibly stunned reaction and a nudge from her daughter, Blue Ivy. Beyonc\u00e9 credited the win to the country artists who contributed to her album, 'Cowboy Carter,' and criticized genre boundaries as tools to marginalize artists, urging others to pursue their passions persistently. The win prompted backlash within the country music community, leading the Recording Academy to split the Best Country Album category into Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album starting in 2026. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, stated the change was driven by country artists themselves seeking greater recognition across subgenres, aligning country with other genres' award structures. This move followed a similar change after Beyonc\u00e9 won Best Dance/Electronic Record for 'Renaissance,' which led to the creation of the Best Pop Dance Record category. Beyonc\u00e9 also won Album of the Year for 'Cowboy Carter,' which she said was inspired by her past exclusion from the country genre. She revealed on Instagram that her experience of not feeling welcomed in country music led her to deeply study its history, ultimately creating a work that celebrates its roots and unites diverse voices. Her performance of 'Daddy Lessons' with the Chicks at the CMA Awards drew criticism, with some arguing she shouldn\u2019t have been invited, but Beyonc\u00e9 stated these criticisms fueled her artistic evolution, allowing her to challenge genre limitations and blend styles in 'Act II' of her work.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:35 PM\nSource: [Showbiz Cheat Sheet](https://www.cheatsheet.com/news/music/grammys-rewrote-rules-beyonces-historic-best-country-album-win.html/)\n\n**Entries to Grammy's New Traditional Country Category Look Very Promising**\nThe ballot for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards has been released, featuring a newly introduced Best Traditional Country Album category, which aims to elevate authentic country artists often marginalized in favor of contemporary or pop-influenced acts. The category, with an eligibility period from August 31, 2024, to August 30, 2025, includes 68 entries\u2014more than the 62 in the Best Contemporary Country Album category\u2014indicating strong participation. Prominent independent and traditional country artists are well-represented, including Charley Crockett ('Dollar A Day'), Cody Jinks ('In My Blood'), Margo Price ('Hard Headed Woman'), Turnpike Troubadours ('The Price of Admission'), and Jesse Daniel ('Son Of The San Lorenzo'). Country legends such as Willie Nelson ('Oh What A Beautiful World'), George Strait ('Cowboys And Dreamers'), Dwight Yoakam ('Brighter Days'), Trisha Yearwood ('The Mirror'), and Asleep At The Wheel ('Riding High In Texas') are also in contention. Women in traditional country are making a strong showing with Sunny Sweeney ('Rhinestone Requiem'), Shawna Thompson ('Lean On Neon'), Kristina Murray ('Little Blue'), Kelsey Waldon ('Every Ghost'), and Hailey Whitters ('Corn Queen'). Mainstream traditionalists like Zach Top ('Ain't In It For My Health'), The Castellows ('Homecoming'), Kameron Marlowe ('Sad Songs For The Soul'), Ashland Craft ('Dive Bar Beauty Queen'), and Parker McCollum ('Parker McCollum') are included, proving the category isn't limited to independent acts. Underground and lesser-known artists such as Benjamin Tod ('Shooting Star'), JP Harris ('JP Harris Is A Trash Fire'), Joshua Ray Walker ('Tropicana'), Caleb Klauder & Reeb Willms ('Gold In Your Pocket'), and The Doohickeys ('All Hat No Cattle') are also featured. Subgenres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country are represented by Marcedes Carroll ('We Lost Track Of The Stars'), Ian Munsick ('Eagle Feather'), Tris Munsick & The Innocents ('Big Medicine Moon'), Sterling Drake ('The Shape I'm In'), and Ned LeDoux ('Safe Haven'). The nominees will be announced on November 7, 2025. The Best Contemporary Country Album category remains competitive, with artists like Tyler Childers and Riley Green among the entries, suggesting that 'country' authenticity is still strong in both categories. Artists must submit their work for consideration, and the high number of entries signals growing engagement in the new traditional category.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource: [Saving Country Music](https://savingcountrymusic.com/entries-to-grammys-new-traditional-country-category-look-very-promising/)\n\n**2026 GRAMMYs: More than 1,000 songs battle for eight nomination slots**\nThe 2026 Grammy Awards are seeing intense competition in the Song of the Year category, with 1,015 entries\u2014making it the most competitive category in Grammy history. This surpasses last year\u2019s 978 submissions and far exceeds the 48 entries in Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, the lowest number recorded. Voting by Recording Academy members opened on October 3, 2025, and closes on October 15. Nominations will be announced on November 7, 2025, with the main ceremony set for February 1, 2026, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Other categories also saw shifts: Record of the Year rose to 894 entries, Best New Artist to 337, and Songwriter of the Year (Non Classical) to 63. Conversely, Album of the Year declined from 707 to 686 entries, and Producer of the Year (Non Classical) dropped from 200 to 161. Two new categories were introduced: Best Traditional Country Album (68 entries) and Best Album Cover (68 entries), with traditional country outpacing contemporary country (62 entries). While no category fell below the 40-entry minimum required for five nominees, the soundtrack category is near the threshold. Five specialized categories\u2014Best Album Cover, Best Recording Package, Best Album Notes, Best Historical Album, and Best Immersive Audio Album\u2014will be decided by committees rather than voters. Final round voting runs from December 12 to January 5, 2026, with winners announced live during the ceremony.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 07:37 AM\nSource: [The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/life/music/2026-grammys-more-than-1000-songs-battle-for-eight-nomination-slots/)\n\n"
