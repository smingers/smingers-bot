## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on my research into the 2026 Grammy nominations and predictions, I'll address your question about the **Best Traditional Country Album** award directly:

1. **Current Status of the Award**:  
   The 2026 Grammys (taking place on February 1, 2026) have introduced a split in the country category for the first time, separating it into **Best Traditional Country Album** and **Best Contemporary Country Album** [3][8][13]. This is a new development, and predictions are more speculative than for established categories.

2. **Key Contenders and Predictions**:  
   Industry analysis from GoldDerby [18] identifies three frontrunners:  
   - **Margo Price** is cited as having the strongest artistic work in this category, with critical acclaim for her traditional sound.  
   - **Zach Top** is considered a likely winner due to higher visibility and mainstream traction.  
   - **Charley Crockett** is also noted for a standout performance that could sway voters.  
   The analysis explicitly downplays the chances of veteran acts like Willie Nelson (referred to as "the father"), suggesting his nomination may stem more from legacy recognition than current merit [18].

3. **Limitations and Context**:  
   - No album titles or specific projects are mentioned in available sources, making it impossible to tie predictions to specific works [18].  
   - Voting demographics have shifted significantly in 2025–2026, with the Recording Academy adding 3,800 new members (many younger and more diverse), which could impact outcomes in traditional genres [1][8].  
   - The category is highly subjective, with GoldDerby noting the result may hinge on industry lobbying and name recognition as much as artistic quality [18].

4. **Most Plausible Outcome**:  
   While Margo Price has the strongest critical backing, **Zach Top appears positioned as the pragmatic favorite** due to his broader appeal and visibility with voters [18]. The actual winner will be announced during the February 1 ceremony.

I’ll continue monitoring for updates as the Grammys approach, but this reflects the most current, sourced perspective available. If you’d like deeper analysis of specific artists or voting trends, just let me know!

**Dolly Parton and the Kikuyu: The Rising Passion for Country Music in Kenya**
The country music genre is experiencing a significant rise in popularity across Kenya, according to a report by Courrier international citing Deutsche Welle. This growing movement, fueled by a new generation of artists, blends traditional Kenyan culture with country music through cowboy boots, nostalgic melodies, and lyrics in local languages such as Kikuyu. The phenomenon is not merely a trend but a cultural shift, as highlighted by artists like 'Sir Elvis' Otieno, who links country music to his family’s musical heritage and local identity. Otieno, born in 1977—the year Elvis Presley died—grew up surrounded by vinyls and cassettes, learning guitar from his father. His performances, including a rendition of Don Williams’ 'It Must Be Love,' have drawn enthusiastic crowds in Nairobi, echoing scenes from Nashville. In 2002, Ythera Wildflower gained recognition for her Kikuyu-language cover of Dolly Parton’s 'Coat of Many Colors,' blending local dialect with country style. Historical roots trace back to colonial-era interactions between European settlers and Kikuyu laborers, who adopted the genre, initially calling it 'music for the rich.' By 2025, Nairobi celebrated its first International Cowboy and Cowgirl Day, featuring parades of cowboy hats and boots. The 2024 release of Beyoncé’s album 'Cowboy Carter' further accelerated the genre’s global revival, inspiring a surge in country music events across Kenya. 'Sir Elvis' expressed his dream: 'My dream has always been that country music becomes a major genre in Kenya—and across Africa.'

**Wedding Music Trends: How Couples Are Replacing the Mendelssohn March with Personalized Soundtracks**
Since the 1858 wedding of Queen Victoria, Felix Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March' has become a global symbol of wedding ceremonies. However, modern couples increasingly choose music that reflects their personal identity, love story, and wedding mood instead of traditional pieces. Today's wedding playlists are far more diverse than just ten years ago, featuring film soundtracks, contemporary pop, indie hits, and rock ballads. Key trends include individuality and emotional authenticity over strict adherence to tradition. Popular choices include romantic pop ballads by Ed Sheeran ('Perfect', 'Thinking Out Loud') and John Legend ('All of Me'), as well as instrumental film scores by Hans Zimmer and themes from movies like 'Amélie', 'The Notebook', and 'Twilight'. A growing trend is the use of Ukrainian-language songs by artists such as Kuzma Skryabin, Okean Elzy, Khristyna Soloviy, Jamala, and Jerry Heil, used to affirm cultural identity. For informal outdoor weddings, acoustic and indie versions of popular songs—often performed live by musicians—are favored. Some couples even select songs tied to personal milestones, such as the moment they met or confessed love, prioritizing emotional resonance over genre or popularity. For those seeking alternatives to Mendelssohn’s march, recommended pieces include Wagner’s 'Bridal Chorus' from 'Lohengrin', Pachelbel’s 'Canon in D', Bach’s 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring', Elgar’s 'Salut d'Amour', Debussy’s 'Clair de Lune', Schubert’s 'Ave Maria', and modern instrumental arrangements like 'A Thousand Years' by Christina Perri or 'River Flows in You' by Yiruma. The article also references previous coverage on wedding statistics in early 2025 and celebrity unions, including Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco.

**After 'costume invasions' in street carnival, brands revisit classic fantasies**
This year, traditional carnival costumes such as pirate, colombina, pierrô, and clown outfits are regaining prominence in fashion collections, reflecting a broader trend among designers. The brand Ohlograma, founded by Clarissa Romancini, exemplifies this shift, with the designer stating she sought to reconnect with the emotional memories of her childhood, moving away from cultural appropriations like indigenous motifs and baiana attire. Instead, classic figures like the dancer, bunny, and sailor are now in vogue, described as 'much more playful and fun.' According to Tiago Ribeiro, author of 'Os blocos do carnaval carioca,' carnival costumes were introduced to Rio's street carnival in the mid-19th century, influenced by French and Italian carnivals, serving both an ornate and didactic purpose. In the past, those without resources created makeshift costumes, but today, the focus has shifted toward visual 'beauty' over character representation, driven in part by social media's influence on visual culture. Historical patterns show that such shifts are not new—Ribeiro found reports from the late 1950s claiming the disappearance of street blocos, though in reality, they had only evolved, much like today’s blocos that feature pop music acts like Katy Perry.

**ICH 'Trend' Rises in Horse Year: Craftsmanship Lights Up Haizhou’s New Year Spirit**
In Lianyungang City's Haizhou District, a surge in intangible cultural heritage (ICH) activities has energized the festive atmosphere ahead of the Year of the Horse. Traditional crafts such as leatherwork, textile embroidery, dough modeling, and pottery have incorporated horse-themed elements, becoming popular choices for New Year gifts and home decoration. At the Keer Shi Leather Workshop, fourth-generation ICH inheritor Cheng Junjie crafts handmade horse leather ornaments, with daily production limited to 3–5 pieces due to the labor-intensive process, making them highly collectible. Orders for small horse leather items priced between 100 and 200 yuan have increased significantly since the start of the year, with 2–4 orders per day. At Li Qiuhong’s embroidery shop, traditional cut-velvet shoe insoles and horse-themed accessories like 'Ma Shang You Qian' (implying 'money comes quickly') designs are in high demand, reflecting the cultural significance of blessings and prosperity. Dough modeling artist Xu Shu shu creates vibrant, lifelike horse figurines using a four-step technique—pressing, pinching, inlaying, and rolling—within minutes. Meanwhile, at the 'Shizhi' pottery studio, demand for horse-themed ceramics such as figurines, fridge magnets, and mugs has surged, with customers also engaging in hands-on workshops to experience the craft firsthand. The revitalization of these ICH practices is supported by Haizhou District’s 'Local Talent Recruitment Program' and incentives such as subsidies and tax reductions, attracting renowned artisans like Zhou Cunyu (Jiangsu ICH copper forging) and Xu Shu shu. The district’s efforts have enabled ICH projects to 'enter, stay, and thrive' in the historic Minzhu Road Street, blending tradition with modern demand and demonstrating cultural confidence through the sustainable coexistence of heritage and market vitality.

**Country band fresh off hiatus returns with historic honor, first tour in years**
The Band Perry, a Grammy, CMA, and ACM Award-winning country trio, has returned to music after a two-year hiatus, marking their comeback with a hurricane benefit concert in Greeneville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2025. Frontwoman Kimberly Perry described the event as deeply personal, celebrating community and their roots. The band re-signed with Big Machine Label Group in July 2025, with Perry’s husband, Jonny Costello, joining as backing vocalist, replacing her brother Neil, who left to focus on artist management and raising mustangs in Joshua Tree. Reid Perry left the band in October 2025, citing a shift toward the management side of music and a passion for ranch life. Perry emphasized that the transition to a husband-and-wife duo has been seamless, highlighting their complementary strengths—Costello managing the home front and Perry handling the business. The band is currently on a 2026 tour, their first in approximately seven years, with plans to return to the studio to complete a new album, which Perry says is 'very close' to finishing. A social media teaser for a new song—a hand inserting a sword into a heart-shaped cake—has generated buzz, with fans likening it to Taylor Swift’s 'Reputation' era and the song 'Ready or Not.' The band’s 2010 hit 'If I Die Young' achieved Diamond certification (10 million units sold) by the RIAA in November 2025, making Perry the only female artist to solo-write a Diamond-certified country song. The track also won CMA awards for Single and Song of the Year in 2011 and remains culturally resonant, frequently shared in tributes and viral internet trends. The Band Perry previously released gold-certified albums 'Pioneer' (2013) and earned a Grammy for their cover of 'Gentle On My Mind' in 2015. Perry, 42, reflected on her journey, stating that The Band Perry has always been a family band and that this new chapter—'season two'—is both joyful and meaningful.

**Are We Witnessing a Revolution in Pop Music?**
The article explores a quiet revolution in pop music, driven by three pioneering female artists: Rosalía, Raye, and Olivia Dean. Despite the dominance of AI-generated music and algorithm-driven hooks, these artists are redefining pop with complex arrangements, orchestral elements, and emotionally raw, authentic storytelling. Rosalía’s album 'Lux', recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra and sung in 14 languages, blends art-pop with classical and spiritual themes. Raye, after breaking free from her label Polydor Records, released her independent album 'My 21st Century Blues', which confronts trauma, addiction, and identity, earning her six Brit Awards in a single ceremony. Olivia Dean’s music draws from 1980s soul and Motown, evoking nostalgia that resonates across generations. Experts Derek von Krogh (Popakademie Baden-Württemberg) and Dr. Pop (musicologist and comedian) argue that the human voice, emotional authenticity, and political provocation remain beyond AI’s reach. They identify three key trends shaping pop’s future: nostalgic aesthetics, genre hybridization, and a growing demand for handcrafted, soulful music. The Windrush Generation’s historical struggle is also referenced as a source of lyrical depth in contemporary music. The article concludes with optimism: pop music is becoming more artistically courageous, politically engaged, and emotionally resonant.

**Orquestra Afrosinfônica: The Unique Fusion of Afro-Brazilian and Symphonic Traditions**
The Orquestra Afrosinfônica, founded in 2010 in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, is a unique ensemble blending Afro-Brazilian musical traditions with symphonic instrumentation. Led by mestre Ubiratan Marques, a pianist, composer, and educator raised in a deeply musical environment rooted in Afro-Brazilian culture and regional traditions, the orchestra was born from a vision to address the lack of symphonic ensembles celebrating Afro-Brazilian heritage. Based in the renovated Casa Ponte, the orchestra functions as a community-driven conservatory, promoting local talent and cultural expression. Its sound integrates traditional symphonic instruments with Afro-Brazilian percussion and vocal elements central to terreiro practices, aiming to 'translate a little of this Afro-indigenous Brazil' and give voice to African-derived languages silenced by history. The orchestra has released two albums: 'Branco' (2015), honoring the deity Oxalá, and 'Orín' (2020), which earned a Latin Grammy nomination and was designed by artist Vik Muniz. The upcoming third album, co-directed by Ubiratan and BaianaSystem’s Russo Passapusso, will feature reinterpreted classics from eight Afro-Brazilian blocos of Salvador, with a more accessible, pop-oriented language aimed at broader public resonance. The album is planned for recording in March 2026, following Carnival, and release in November. Despite its cultural impact, the orchestra faces challenges in sustainability due to the absence of public funding, particularly amid the 2026 Brazilian presidential election cycle.

**Two legends -- a drummer and a rapper -- unite for unexpected musical journey**
John Densmore, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer of The Doors, and Chuck D, founder of Public Enemy and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, have formed a new musical supergroup called doPE, blending their legacies. Their debut album, 'no country for old men,' will be released on April 18, 2026, exclusively as a limited-edition oxblood transparent vinyl through participating local record shops for Record Store Day. The lead single, 'every tick tick tick,' has been named Record Store Day's 2026 Song of the Year in advance of its release. The collaboration began with a chance meeting at a Record Store Day panel in 2014, followed by a direct email from Chuck D in 2015 proposing the project with the phrase: 'You've got the beats, I've got the rhymes, let's make doPE.' Over the next decade, the duo developed the album around the philosophical concept: 'Everybody gets older, but not everybody gets elder,' as reported by Stereogum. Chuck D, 65, described the project as a bridge between generations, stating, 'John Densmore's beat isn't just rhythm, it's history talking,' while Densmore, 81 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner, called the collaboration 'an honor.' The album is characterized as a 'meditation on responsibility, legacy and the bond between generations,' according to American Songwriter.

**Ten Eastern German Traditions Lost: How Western Firms Closed Historic East German Businesses**
The article highlights a growing trend in eastern Germany where large western or international corporations have acquired traditional eastern German businesses and subsequently closed them, sparking public frustration and political concern. Ten specific cases are detailed: Haribo shut down its Wilkau-Haßlau factory in 2020, ending 120 years of confectionery production and dismissing 150 workers; Melitta closed its 226-year-old paper mill in Neu-Kaliß due to a 'consistently poor business situation'; Jägermeister’s glass supplier, Owens-Illinois, ceased operations in Bernsdorf in 2025 after 150 years; Henkel closed its 108-year-old adhesive plant in Heidenau, despite CEO Carsten Knobel’s public assurances in 2024 that no German plants would close; the Uhlen GmbH’s slaughterhouse in Perleberg was shut after a Bundeskartellamt investigation into potential anti-competitive behavior; Südzucker AG closed its Brottewitz sugar factory in 2019 after the end of the EU sugar market regime; Andros shut down the Spreewaldkonserve gherkin factory in Golßen, citing a 'difficult market environment' despite recent wage improvements; Continental closed its 155-year-old rubber plant in Bad Blankenburg, citing declining demand, though the company reported strong profits; Tatravagónka shut down the Niesky wagon factory in 2023 after years of declining orders; and Tönnies closed the Eberswalder Wurstwerke in Britz in 2026, just three years after acquisition, using a legal loophole to avoid full severance payments. Workers and communities express deep disappointment, citing lost livelihoods, identity, and trust. The article warns of rising unemployment in eastern Germany (projected 1% increase by 2026) and growing political instability, particularly with the AfD gaining strength in upcoming state elections. The trend is criticized as 'market consolidation' by unions, with accusations that companies acquire businesses to eliminate competition and later liquidate them without investment.

**West Dressed: In fashion and entertainment, everyone's gone country**
Western fashion, music, and lifestyle trends have gained lasting cultural momentum, driven by the success of the TV series 'Yellowstone,' which premiered in 2018 and starred Kevin Costner as the head of a Montana ranching family. The show's influence extended to related streaming content, merchandise (including jewelry by Kendra Scott and eyewear from Diff), and The Four Sixes Ranch Steakhouse at Wynn Las Vegas, named after a Texas ranch owned by show creator Taylor Sheridan. The trend was further amplified by Beyoncé’s 2024 'Cowboy Carter' album, which featured a rodeo-inspired cover and brought greater diversity to the movement. CBS’s 'The Road,' a series showcasing aspiring country musicians competing for Keith Urban, also contributed to the resurgence, with performances in cities like Dallas and Nashville. Modern Western wear is rooted in heritage and lifestyle rather than the flashy 'Urban Cowboy' style of the 1980s. In Denver, vintage Western wear retailers like The Shop Outpost, Hats by Parker Thomas, and Rancher Hat Bar cater to a 25–40 age group, offering customization events such as hat parties. Western wear was featured at Denver Fashion Week in November, with runway shows by Rockmount Ranch Wear, Bailey Heyman, Spytful, and April & West. The Double D Ranchwear fashion show, organized by Angela S. Lieurance of Women of the National Western, grew from a pop-up into a major event attended by 200 women. Tara Kaufman, associate curator at History Colorado, notes that Western wear is a hybrid aesthetic shaped by Spanish, Native American, Mexican, and European influences, making it a versatile expression of American identity. The style’s functionality—such as pointed-toe boots for riding and wide-brim hats for sun protection—adds to its appeal. Colorado’s historical role in Western wear is underscored by the founding of major brands like Miller Stockman and Rockmount Ranch Wear. Key Western-themed venues in Denver include Belles & Boots, The Grizzly Rose, Neon Cowboy, The Buckhorn Exchange, The Fort, and the Urban Cowboy Hotel, which has locations in Nashville, Brooklyn, and the Catskills.

**Tyler Childers, Eric Church Face Off in the Grammys' Contemporary Country Album Race**
For the first time in Grammy history, country music albums are being split into two distinct categories: Contemporary and Traditional. This change follows Beyoncé’s historic win for her country album Cowboy Carter in 2024, which many see as a catalyst for broader genre recognition. Claire Heinichen, Senior Editor for Country at Spotify, describes Beyoncé’s success as a 'wake-up call' that the genre deserved more representation. Artists like Kelsea Ballerini, whose album Patterns blends pop and country storytelling, and Jelly Roll, known for his pop-crossover appeal and generational connection, are seen as strong contenders. However, the race is expected to center on Tyler Childers’ Snipe Hunter and Eric Church’s Evangeline vs. the Machine. Childers’ album, praised for its gritty songwriting and bold themes—including a track about spreading rabies—reclaims his Purgatory-era authenticity. Church’s record, blending 1970s rock with country, features orchestral arrangements and spiritual undertones, marking his most ambitious work yet. Church, an 11-time nominee without a win, is widely viewed as a likely first-time Grammy recipient in this category.

**Do the Grammys Have a Country Music Problem?**
The article examines a growing disconnect between country music and the Grammy Awards, particularly in the Big Four categories (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist). For 2025, zero country or country-adjacent artists received nominations in these top categories, despite country’s significant commercial growth and critical acclaim. The article highlights that while country has seen rising popularity and strong performances by artists like Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney, Ella Langley, and Zach Top—each receiving multiple CMA nominations—none were nominated at the Grammys. Lainey Wilson, in particular, has been repeatedly overlooked despite widespread critical and commercial success, including winning a country Grammy in 2024, which made her ineligible for Best New Artist. The article notes a historical trend: since 2011, only two country songs have been nominated in Record of the Year, and the last nomination for a traditional country artist in Album of the Year was Chris Stapleton’s 'Traveller' in 2015. While the Recording Academy has made progress in down-ballot country categories—such as splitting Best Country Album into Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Country—the top tiers remain largely inaccessible. The article suggests systemic issues, including voter disinterest, a lack of demographic diversity among voters, and the genre’s focus on the CMAs and ACMs as primary recognition platforms. It argues that the Grammys’ failure to recognize country’s dominant female artists reflects a broader institutional bias, despite country’s cultural and commercial relevance. The piece concludes by urging the Recording Academy to expand its voter base and recognize the genre’s creative renaissance, especially the rise of women in country music.

**For country music traditionalists, Grammy changes promise a brighter spotlight**
The Grammy Awards are splitting the Best Country Album category into two separate categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, effective next year. This change, announced on November 7, 2025, follows years of advocacy by traditional country artists and supporters like Kyle Coroneos of Saving Country Music and NPR’s Jewly Hight. The move aims to provide greater recognition for artists whose music leans toward classic country sensibilities, such as Sunny Sweeney, whose 2024 album 'Rhinestone Requiem' was not eligible under the old category. Sweeney reported receiving 7,000 text messages within 10 minutes of the announcement, reflecting widespread excitement among traditionalists. While artists like Zach Top, a mainstream country hitmaker with classic influences, welcome the new category as a validation of their sound, others like Charley Crockett express discomfort with genre labeling, questioning whether his work fits neatly into 'traditional' or 'contemporary' despite his rootsy style. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of The Recording Academy, emphasized that changes are driven by community input and proposals, not arbitrary decisions. The first five nominees for Best Traditional Country Album will be announced the following day. The shift reflects a broader effort to address historical marginalization of traditional country music within the mainstream industry and awards landscape.

**A Home For Tradition: The Grammys Get A New Country Category [Interview]**
The Recording Academy announced the addition of the 'Best Traditional Country Album' category to the Grammy Awards, effective in 2025, following a multi-year, member-driven process. This change redefines the existing 'Best Country Album' category as 'Best Contemporary Country Album' to better distinguish between traditional and modern country music. The new category aims to recognize artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hoffman, whose work does not fit mainstream country. According to Shelly Maree of the Recording Academy, the proposal was under review for about three years, with data collection beginning two years prior and final approval in spring 2025. The category defines traditional country by adherence to classic sound structures, including steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, live drums, and subgenres like western, western swing, and outlaw country. The Academy emphasizes that evaluation is based on the music, not the artist, and that an artist may be classified differently in different years depending on their album. The move is intended to create a more inclusive and representative platform, encouraging underrepresented artists to join the Academy and gain visibility. Maree notes that Grammy recognition can significantly boost streams and public awareness, especially for independent or traditionally rooted artists not widely played on commercial radio. The Academy also highlights that similar dual categories already exist in blues, R&B, and pop, affirming that this structure is not new but necessary for country’s broad spectrum. The change reflects a broader effort to listen to the music community and adapt to the genre’s diversity.

**Jelly Roll, Zach Top & No Morgan Wallen: Inside the Grammy Race for Contemporary & Traditional Country Albums**
The Recording Academy has split the Grammy Award for Best Country Album into two distinct categories: Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album, marking the first time two country albums will be honored in the country field. This change aligns country categories with other genres like R&B, pop, and blues, which already separate contemporary and traditional works. The split has led to a significant increase in entries, with 68 albums submitted for contemporary and 62 for traditional, up from 79 total last year. The traditional category includes recordings adhering to classic country structures, instrumentation (e.g., acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo), and sub-genres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country. It features strong contenders such as Willie Nelson’s 'Oh What a Beautiful World,' Lukas Nelson’s 'American Romance,' Parker McCollum’s self-titled album, Jamey Johnson’s 'Midnight Gasoline,' Cody Jinks’ 'In My Blood,' George Strait’s 'Cowboys and Dreamers,' Margo Price’s 'Hardheaded Woman,' Trisha Yearwood’s 'The Mirror,' and Turnpike Troubadours’ 'The Price of Admission.' The contemporary category, defined as music reflecting the broad spectrum of modern country style and culture, includes top contenders like Tyler Childers’ 'Snipe Hunter,' Miranda Lambert’s 'Postcards From Texas,' Jelly Roll’s 'Beautifully Broken,' Kelsea Ballerini’s 'Patterns,' and Eric Church’s 'Evangeline vs. the Machine.' Notably, Morgan Wallen’s 'I'm the Problem,' the year’s biggest country album, was not submitted, removing a major contender. Other potential nominees include Tucker Wetmore’s 'What Not To' and Riley Green’s deluxe 'Don’t Mind If I Do.' First-round voting ends October 15, nominations are announced November 7, final-round voting runs December 12 to January 5, and the 68th Grammy Awards will be held on February 1, 2026.

**The Grammys Rewrote Their Rules After Beyoncé's Historic Best Country Album Win**
In 2025, Beyoncé made history by winning the Grammy for Best Country Album, becoming the first Black woman to do so. Her win, which she described as unexpected, sparked widespread reaction and meme culture, especially after her visibly stunned reaction and a nudge from her daughter, Blue Ivy. Beyoncé credited the win to the country artists who contributed to her album, 'Cowboy Carter,' and criticized genre boundaries as tools to marginalize artists, urging others to pursue their passions persistently. The win prompted backlash within the country music community, leading the Recording Academy to split the Best Country Album category into Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album starting in 2026. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, stated the change was driven by country artists themselves seeking greater recognition across subgenres, aligning country with other genres' award structures. This move followed a similar change after Beyoncé won Best Dance/Electronic Record for 'Renaissance,' which led to the creation of the Best Pop Dance Record category. Beyoncé also won Album of the Year for 'Cowboy Carter,' which she said was inspired by her past exclusion from the country genre. She revealed on Instagram that her experience of not feeling welcomed in country music led her to deeply study its history, ultimately creating a work that celebrates its roots and unites diverse voices. Her performance of 'Daddy Lessons' with the Chicks at the CMA Awards drew criticism, with some arguing she shouldn’t have been invited, but Beyoncé stated these criticisms fueled her artistic evolution, allowing her to challenge genre limitations and blend styles in 'Act II' of her work.

**Entries to Grammy's New Traditional Country Category Look Very Promising**
The ballot for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards has been released, featuring a newly introduced Best Traditional Country Album category, which aims to elevate authentic country artists often marginalized in favor of contemporary or pop-influenced acts. The category, with an eligibility period from August 31, 2024, to August 30, 2025, includes 68 entries—more than the 62 in the Best Contemporary Country Album category—indicating strong participation. Prominent independent and traditional country artists are well-represented, including Charley Crockett ('Dollar A Day'), Cody Jinks ('In My Blood'), Margo Price ('Hard Headed Woman'), Turnpike Troubadours ('The Price of Admission'), and Jesse Daniel ('Son Of The San Lorenzo'). Country legends such as Willie Nelson ('Oh What A Beautiful World'), George Strait ('Cowboys And Dreamers'), Dwight Yoakam ('Brighter Days'), Trisha Yearwood ('The Mirror'), and Asleep At The Wheel ('Riding High In Texas') are also in contention. Women in traditional country are making a strong showing with Sunny Sweeney ('Rhinestone Requiem'), Shawna Thompson ('Lean On Neon'), Kristina Murray ('Little Blue'), Kelsey Waldon ('Every Ghost'), and Hailey Whitters ('Corn Queen'). Mainstream traditionalists like Zach Top ('Ain't In It For My Health'), The Castellows ('Homecoming'), Kameron Marlowe ('Sad Songs For The Soul'), Ashland Craft ('Dive Bar Beauty Queen'), and Parker McCollum ('Parker McCollum') are included, proving the category isn't limited to independent acts. Underground and lesser-known artists such as Benjamin Tod ('Shooting Star'), JP Harris ('JP Harris Is A Trash Fire'), Joshua Ray Walker ('Tropicana'), Caleb Klauder & Reeb Willms ('Gold In Your Pocket'), and The Doohickeys ('All Hat No Cattle') are also featured. Subgenres like Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country are represented by Marcedes Carroll ('We Lost Track Of The Stars'), Ian Munsick ('Eagle Feather'), Tris Munsick & The Innocents ('Big Medicine Moon'), Sterling Drake ('The Shape I'm In'), and Ned LeDoux ('Safe Haven'). The nominees will be announced on November 7, 2025. The Best Contemporary Country Album category remains competitive, with artists like Tyler Childers and Riley Green among the entries, suggesting that 'country' authenticity is still strong in both categories. Artists must submit their work for consideration, and the high number of entries signals growing engagement in the new traditional category.

**2026 GRAMMYs: More than 1,000 songs battle for eight nomination slots**
The 2026 Grammy Awards are seeing intense competition in the Song of the Year category, with 1,015 entries—making it the most competitive category in Grammy history. This surpasses last year’s 978 submissions and far exceeds the 48 entries in Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, the lowest number recorded. Voting by Recording Academy members opened on October 3, 2025, and closes on October 15. Nominations will be announced on November 7, 2025, with the main ceremony set for February 1, 2026, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Other categories also saw shifts: Record of the Year rose to 894 entries, Best New Artist to 337, and Songwriter of the Year (Non Classical) to 63. Conversely, Album of the Year declined from 707 to 686 entries, and Producer of the Year (Non Classical) dropped from 200 to 161. Two new categories were introduced: Best Traditional Country Album (68 entries) and Best Album Cover (68 entries), with traditional country outpacing contemporary country (62 entries). While no category fell below the 40-entry minimum required for five nominees, the soundtrack category is near the threshold. Five specialized categories—Best Album Cover, Best Recording Package, Best Album Notes, Best Historical Album, and Best Immersive Audio Album—will be decided by committees rather than voters. Final round voting runs from December 12 to January 5, 2026, with winners announced live during the ceremony.

### Grammy Award for Best Traditional Country Album
The Grammy Award for Best Traditional Country Album is an award presented by the Recording Academy to honor quality traditional country music music performances in any given year. The award is scheduled to be presented for the first time at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in 2026, as a complement to the newly renamed Best Contemporary Country Album category, and sits in the Country & American Roots genre field. The academy announced the new category in June 2025, stating that the award “recognizes excellence in albums of traditional country music, both vocal and instrumental. Traditional country includes country recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation such as acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar, and live drums. It also includes sub-genres such as Western, Western Swing, and Outlaw country.” The award goes to the artist(s), producer(s), and mixers(s) of the album.

It was noted that a proposal for the category had been submitted several times previously before being passed, and that it was created to honor a wider range of artists who fall outside of the commercial mainstream country music scene based in Nashville, and highlighted a need to separate these artists from those making Americana, roots, and folk music, who were all competing in the over-subscribed American Roots categories. The Academy specifically highlighted artists such as Charley Crockett, Sierra Ferrell, Colter Wall, and Noeline Hofmann, the former two having previously been nominated in Americana categories, and the general growth in popularity of country and its subgenres as reasons why the category was approved. The Academy also noted that the separation of the Best Country Album category brings the genre into line with other genres, such as R&B, Pop, and Blues, which all have distinct categories honoring Traditional and Contemporary styles. Regarding the establishment of this category, which was announced alongside Best Album Cover, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. stated: “The community of people that are making country music in all different subgenres came to us with a proposal and said we would like to have more variety in how our music is honored. They said, we think we need more space for our music to be celebrated and honored. It makes country parallel with what’s happening in other genres, but it is also creating space for where this genre is going

Critics of the new category argued that separating “traditional” country risks reinforcing cultural and racial boundaries within the genre, potentially positioning artists who do not conform to historical genre norms as “outsiders.” Supporters of the category argue that establishing a formal distinction preserves traditional instrumentation, songwriting structures, and performance practices within country music history. ^[I] Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.

### Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Country Album
The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Country Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality albums in the country music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position". The award was first presented under the name of Best Country & Western Album in 1966 to Roger Miller for Dang Me/Chug-A-Lug and was discontinued the following year. In 1995 the category was revived and was presented as Best Country Album until 2025 before receiving its current denomination at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in 2026 alongside the debut of a sister category Best Traditional Country Album. According to the category description guide for the 68th Grammy Awards (2026), the award "recognizes contemporary country music recordings, both vocal and instrumental, which utilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture. The intent is to recognize country music that remains reminiscent and relevant to the legacy of country music’s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms." The Chicks are the most awarded performers in this category with four wins, followed by Chris Stapleton who has three wins. Two-time award winners include Roger Miller, Lady A, Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Canadian singer Shania Twain is the only non-American winner in this category, to date. Trisha Yearwood holds the record for most nominations, with eight. Yearwood also holds the record for most nominations without a win. The current holder of the award is Beyonce, the first black artist, who won at the 67th Grammy Awards with her eighth studio album Cowboy Carter.

### 1990s in music
. Yearwood's debut album also became the first by a female country act to sell over 1 million copies, eventually going double platinum. Among artists whose success continued from the 1980s, Reba McEntire was the most successful of the female artists, selling more than 30 million albums during the decade, gaining eight number-one hit singles on the U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and six number one albums internationally, including her best-selling album, Greatest Hits Vol. 2, which was released in September 1993 and has sold over an international amount of 10 million copies to date. George Strait, a neo-traditionalist whose national success began in the early 1980s, enjoyed success as both a radio artist (17 No. 1 songs) and as a movie star (1992's Pure Country). Alabama, the most successful country band of the 1980s, continued their run of popularity with sell-out concerts and best-selling albums, while topping the country chart five times. Among older artists having big hits, Conway Twitty was one of the most successful, scoring two Top 3 hits with "Crazy in Love" and "I Couldn't See You Leaving", while Eddie Rabbitt had a No. 1 hit with "On Second Thought." Dolly Parton had a No. 1 hit (with relative newcomer Ricky Van Shelton) on "Rockin' Years" in 1991 and had several top 15 hits. Although his 1990s singles never reached the top 20 (excepting for a duet single with Randy Travis), George Jones (who had been around since the 1950s) regularly recorded and released critically acclaimed material, including the semi-autobiographical "Choices." The Oak Ridge Boys continued their run of success with a No. 1 hit ("No Matter How High") and several other top 40 hits; in 1995, upon the departure of William Lee Golden's replacement Steve Sanders, Golden reunited with longtime band members Duane Allen, Joe Bonsall and Richard Sterban, and the group has remained intact since then. While the Oak Ridge Boys' contemporaries the Statler Brothers were no longer reaching the top 40, the veteran group remained highly popular with fans and their new albums continued to sell well

1990s in music

. Other artists reaching the top 10 of the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart were Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray, and Kenny Rogers. Shawn Colvin rose to fame with her 1997 Grammy-winning song "Sunny Came Home". Pop-influenced country music began growing in popularity, particularly after Twain and Hill rose in popularity in the latter half of the 1990s. In 1998, Hill's "This Kiss" and Twain's "You're Still the One" both reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to peaking at No. 1 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Rimes had a multi-million selling hit with "How Do I Live" (a song successfully covered by Yearwood), while Lonestar also had a huge crossover hit with "Amazed." Although the occurrence of country crossing over to the pop charts goes back as far as the start of the Billboard charts in 1940, some critics began to be troubled by a trend toward what they perceived as pop music marketed as country; they contended that radio was concentrating more on newer music while ignoring the more traditional styles of older artists such as Merle Haggard, George Jones, and others who continued to record and release new material. Johnny Cash and producer Rick Rubin once purchased a full-page advertisement in Billboard magazine – after Cash's album Unchained won a Grammy for Best Country Album, despite a lack of support from radio – showing a young Cash displaying his middle finger and sarcastically "thanking" radio for supporting the album.[citation needed] The criticism of pop-influenced and non-traditional styles in country music, however, dated back to the 1970s although it had quieted down comparably during the 1980s. In the 1990s, alternative country came to refer to a diverse group of musicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. In general, they eschewed the high production values and pop outlook of the Nashville-dominated industry, to produce music with a lo-fi sound, frequently infused with a strong punk and rock & roll aesthetic, bending the traditional rules of country music. Lyrics were often bleak, gothic or socially aware. Other initiators include Old 97's, Steve Earle, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, Blitzen Trapper, and Drive-By Truckers

1990s in music

. A number of notable artists in country music died during the decade, including Twitty, Webb Pierce, Dottie West, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Roger Miller, Roy Acuff, Charlie Rich, Minnie Pearl, Faron Young, John Denver, Carl Perkins, Grandpa Jones, Tammy Wynette, Eddie Rabbitt, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen and Hank Snow. During the 1990s, concurrent with third wave ska, swing music made a resurgence in the form of swing revival, which brought the jazz form into the pop charts. Reaching its commercial zenith around the time of the movie Swingers, whose soundtrack featured numerous 1990s swing bands, the movement was exemplified by bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and the Brian Setzer Orchestra. The highest-charting song of the genre would have been "Jump, Jive an' Wail" by the Brian Setzer Orchestra, which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. in 1998, and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1999. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, a counter-culture movement rose from the Manchester club scene that came to be known as Madchester. Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses were the pre-eminent bands. In the early 1990s, a counter-culture movement rose in Britain, called Britpop by the music press, rejecting the themes of disenfranchised youth coming out of America in favor of songs written specifically about the experiences of the British youth. Although the movement was heavily influenced by 1960s, 1970s and 1980s British rock, there was very little that musically defined the Britpop bands beyond the intensely British lyrical themes. Britpop bands such as Blur, Suede, Kula Shaker, Pulp, Ash, Ocean Colour Scene, Elastica, Supergrass, the Verve and Oasis regularly topped the singles and album charts throughout the decade. Oasis were the biggest band of the Britpop era at the forefront of alternative rock, as their second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? became the second highest selling studio album of all time in the UK
