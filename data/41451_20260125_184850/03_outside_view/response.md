# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question is the historical record of past Grammy Award winners in the Best Traditional Country Album category. This data is publicly available and generally reliable, as the Grammys are a well-established and prestigious awards show. However, there may be some systematic biases in the data, as the Grammy voting process and the music industry itself can be influenced by factors beyond just the quality of the albums.
