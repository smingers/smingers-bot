**Assessment of Ali Khamenei's Position as Supreme Leader Before 2027**  
Based on the latest intelligence and news reports [1][3][4][5][7][8][9][11][15][16][17][19][20], Khamenei remains Supreme Leader as of January 2026, but faces unprecedented threats to his continued rule. Key factors influencing his position include:

### 1. **Critical Health and Security Situation**  
   - Khamenei (86) has reportedly retreated to a fortified Tehran bunker due to fears of U.S. military action [3][4][5][7][8][9][10]. His public appearances have sharply decreased since June 2025 conflicts with Israel, with Western intelligence indicating physical and cognitive decline [15][17].
   - Succession plans are actively contested between factions backing:
     - **Hassan Rouhani** (moderate ex-president)
     - **Hasan Khomeini** (revolutionary founder's grandson)
     - *Not* his son Mojtaba, as hereditary rule violates Islamic Republic principles [19][20].

### 2. **Regime Instability and Escape Contingencies**  
   - Mass protests since December 2025 (30,000+ deaths per reports [1][2][6]) over economic collapse have spread to previously loyal cities like Qom [15][16].
   - Credible intelligence confirms a "Plan B" to flee to Moscow with 20 loyalists if security forces defect [15][16][17][18], modeled after Bashar al-Assad's 2024 escape [16][17].

### 3. **U.S. Pressure and Military Threats**  
   - Former President Trump has threatened "decisive strikes" if protests are violently suppressed [4][17], with warships deployed regionally [4][12]. Khamenei blames the U.S. for unrest but admitted "several thousand" protester deaths [12].

### 4. **Prediction Window (2026–2027)**  
While Khamenei currently retains power, the convergence of:
- Critical health risks at age 86 [13][15][17]
- Potential regime collapse from sustained protests [6][11][15]
- U.S. military escalation threats [3][4][17]
- Documented escape preparations [15][16][18]

**Makes his departure before 2027 probable (>65% likelihood)**. The most plausible scenarios include:
- Death/incapacitation from health decline (high risk given age)
- Forced exile if security forces fracture during protests
- Removal by the Assembly of Experts amid crisis

*Limitations*: Real-time developments could alter this trajectory. IRGC loyalty remains pivotal [11][20], and conflicting reports exist about protest momentum [4][12]. Khamenei's bunker isolation complicates health verification [7][8][9][10].

**Conclusion**  
Barring rapid stabilization, Ali Khamenei is *unlikely* to remain Supreme Leader through 2027. The regime faces existential threats from internal revolt, U.S. pressure, and leadership fragility, with high-confidence reports indicating active succession planning [11][19][20] and escape protocols [15][16][17]. Contingency preparations alone suggest regime elites anticipate his departure within this timeframe.

**Ali Khamenei: Portrait of a Theocratic Tyrant**
Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, is portrayed in a highly critical and condemnatory article as a figure who has ruled the country for over four decades through fear, religious mysticism, and state-sponsored violence. The article traces his rise from a minor cleric to the head of a theocratic regime, emphasizing his role in mass executions, including the 1988 prison massacres, where between 2,800 and 5,000 political prisoners were executed in secret. According to the article, Khamenei justified these killings as necessary to eliminate 'enemies of God' and 'hypocrites' linked to the MEK. The piece cites a 1997 German court verdict that directly implicated Khamenei, President Ali Rafsandjani, and Foreign Minister Ali Velayati in the 1992 Mykonos restaurant assassination in Berlin. It further details a pattern of transnational assassinations of Iranian dissidents in the 1990s, with at least 50 killed abroad, and internal repression under Khamenei’s leadership, including the 1998 'chain murders' of intellectuals and the violent crackdowns on protests in 1999, 2009, 2017, 2019, and 2022–2023. The article describes Khamenei as increasingly isolated, living in a heavily secured compound, disconnected from reality, and promoting a myth of divine infallibility. His rhetoric, such as stating 'the Almighty God was speaking through me,' reflects a megalomania described by exiled opposition figures. The article claims that under his rule, up to 30,000 people have died in purges and executions. In a 2026 statement, Khamenei openly admitted that the Islamic Republic was founded on the blood of hundreds of thousands and vowed not to retreat from its violent foundations. The piece concludes that his regime stands as one of the darkest theocracies of the modern era, where faith is weaponized to justify mass destruction.

**Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei Moves Underground Amid Escalating U.S.-Iran Tensions and Domestic Unrest**
Amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, reports have emerged that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has moved into an underground bunker in Tehran, reportedly due to concerns over a potential American strike. While the Iranian government has not officially confirmed the move, sources cited by Iran International indicate it was driven by security reasons amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including deploying warships and the deadly Tomahawk missiles. Iran’s Defense Ministry spokesperson, Brigadier General Reza Talaei-Nik, claimed that Iran’s missile capabilities have significantly strengthened since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024, citing improvements in both quantity and quality, along with enhanced domestic missile production and defense systems. The situation is further complicated by ongoing domestic unrest, including large-scale protests at the end of December 2025 that were violently suppressed, with human rights organizations reporting over 25,000 deaths—far exceeding Iran’s official figure of approximately 3,100. Additionally, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport Iranian immigrants from the U.S. These developments collectively signal a highly precarious moment in the Middle East, with rumors of Khamenei transferring power to his third son potentially indicating a major shift in Iran’s internal politics and regional dynamics.

**Trump's Warning Sparks Iran's Supreme Leader to Go Underground; India Thanked Amid Escalating Tensions**
Tensions between Iran and the United States have reached a peak. According to reports, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has gone underground in a secure bunker in Tehran amid fears of a potential U.S. attack. The facility reportedly includes interconnected tunnels and modern security systems. During Khamenei's absence, his third son, Masoud Khamenei, is managing daily operations and serving as the primary communication channel with the government. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that any attack on the Supreme Leader would be considered a full-scale war against the entire country. This follows a warning by former U.S. President Trump, who stated that a U.S. 'armada' is moving toward Iran, citing the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several destroyers in the Indian Ocean. Trump claimed that his tough stance had caused Iran to cancel plans to execute nearly 840 people. The report also notes that violent crackdowns on protests in Iran since late December 2025 may have resulted in between 5,000 and 20,000 deaths, according to human rights activists and UN experts. On January 8, 2026, Iran implemented its longest and most extensive internet blackout in history, severing nearly all external communication.

**Who Is Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader Who Has Held Power in Iran for Over 30 Years?**
Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, has held the position since 1989, succeeding Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after his death. At 86 years old, Khamenei serves as both head of state and commander-in-chief, wielding ultimate authority over national policies, the military—including the Revolutionary Guard—and foreign strategy, including Iran’s nuclear program and stance toward Israel and the West. Born in 1939 in Mashhad, he was deeply influenced by Khomeini during the 1960s, becoming a key figure in the anti-monarchical movement against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, he rose to prominence, was elected president in 1981 with 95% of the vote, and re-elected in 1985. Following Khomeini’s death, despite lacking the religious rank of 'marja' required by the constitution, Khamenei was temporarily appointed while the constitution was amended to confirm his leadership. Over his 35-year rule, he has maintained a strong personality cult, suppressed dissent through violence, and controlled a vast economic empire estimated at $95 billion by Reuters in 2018, largely built through the confiscation of property from citizens and religious minorities. He also appoints judicial leaders and controls state media. His leadership has been challenged by ongoing protests demanding his removal, which have persisted for over two weeks as of January 14, 2026.

**Ali Khamenei, the Man Who Embodies Absolute Power at the Heart of Iran in Crisis**
Ali Khamenei has served as the Supreme Leader of Iran since 1989, the figure who has most embodied the continuity and rigidity of the Islamic Republic following the death of its founder, Ruhollah Khomeini. Born on April 19, 1939, in Mashhad, a holy city for Shia Islam, Khamenei was educated in major theological centers including Najaf and Qom, where he developed an early ideological and political alignment with the Khomeinist revolutionary movement. After the fall of the Shah in 1979, he quickly entered the new power structure, serving on the Council of the Revolution and later becoming President of the Islamic Republic during the most difficult years of the Iran-Iraq War. Upon Khomeini’s death, Khamenei was selected as Supreme Leader in an exceptional transition that required a constitutional amendment to meet political needs. Since then, he has become the central figure of the system, holding ultimate authority over domestic policy, security, judiciary, and foreign affairs.

**Who is Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei?**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, faces mounting pressure amid widespread anti-government protests that began on December 28, 2025, and have resulted in at least 544 deaths according to activists, with official figures expected to be higher. The protests were sparked by a call from exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. US President Donald Trump claimed Khamenei was considering fleeing to Russia, suggesting Iran was 'on the verge of collapsing.' In response, Khamenei denounced Trump as 'arrogant' and vowed the Islamic Republic would not yield to foreign 'mercenaries.' Born in 1939 in Mashhad, Khamenei was a political activist against the Shah, became a close aide to Ayatollah Khomeini after the 1979 Revolution, and survived a 1981 assassination attempt that left him paralyzed in his right arm. He served as Iran's president from 1981 to 1989, then became supreme leader following Khomeini’s death, making him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East. Under his rule, Khamenei consolidated power by strengthening the Revolutionary Guard, expanding its economic influence, and establishing the 'Axis of Resistance' through proxy networks across the region. He has historically responded to protests with force, including during the 2009, 2017, 2019, and 2022 uprisings. In June 2025, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war with Iran, but officials admitted the strikes failed to destroy Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program. As of January 12, 2026, the US military is evaluating options including cyber attacks and direct strikes, with Trump warning that any retaliation from Iran would be met with 'levels that they've never been hit before.'

**Who Is Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader at the Heart of Iran's Crisis**
Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran since 1989, remains at the center of the country's political crisis. Born on April 19, 1939, in Mashhad—a holy city for Shia Muslims—Khamenei began his religious education in a maktab and later studied at the seminaries of Mashhad, Najaf, and Qom, where he was influenced by prominent scholars including Ruhollah Khomeini. He became a committed revolutionary, joining opposition to the Shah’s regime and the U.S.-aligned policies, leading to multiple arrests in the 1960s. In 1979, he was appointed to the Council of the Islamic Revolution. He served as Iran’s President for two consecutive terms from 1980 to 1989. Throughout his tenure, Khamenei has maintained a staunch anti-Western stance, declaring, 'There is no trust in America,' and referring to Israel as 'a cancer.' He vowed retaliation after the U.S. assassination of Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, ordering missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq. The accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in January 2020, which killed 176 people, triggered widespread protests. Khamenei downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, stating it 'is nothing extraordinary.' His leadership has come under increasing scrutiny amid regional conflicts, economic hardship, and speculation over his health and succession, fueled by repeated rumors of his hospitalization or death. His legacy and authority are now central to both domestic and international political dynamics in Iran.

**Who Is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader?**
Ali Khamenei, the 86-year-old Supreme Leader of Iran, has remained unharmed in recent Israeli attacks on Iran, which killed high-ranking figures such as General Hossein Salami, head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Mohammad Bagheri, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces. According to three U.S. officials speaking to CBS News, former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly instructed Israel not to target Khamenei. Khamenei has held power for 35 years, serving as both the country's religious and political leader, with ultimate authority over public policy. He was last seen in public in October 2024, after the assassination of his longtime ally Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, by Israeli forces. Born in 1939 in Mashhad, Khamenei was deeply influenced by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the 1960s and became a key organizer of the Iranian opposition. He participated in the 1978 protests that led to the 1979 Revolution, was appointed Friday prayer leader in Tehran in 1980, and became president in 1981 after surviving a bomb attack that paralyzed his right arm. He served as president until 1989, when Khomeini died. Though not initially qualified by constitutional standards (lacking the rank of marja), Khamenei was temporarily appointed, the constitution was amended, and he was confirmed as Supreme Leader. In 2018, a leaked video revealed his initial disbelief and uncertainty during the 1989 selection process. Since then, he has consolidated power through parallel institutions like the IRGC, suppressed dissent, and maintained a hardline stance on social and political issues. His regime has been accused of repressing protests—such as the 2022 demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, which led to over 500 reported deaths—and of assassinating exiled dissidents. Khamenei’s foreign policy has centered on supporting proxy groups in the so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. However, recent Israeli operations—including pager attacks in September 2024 that killed Hezbollah leaders and the assassination of Nasrallah—have significantly weakened these allies. Additionally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, another key ally, was overthrown in December 2024.

**Who Is Ali Khamenei, the Ayatollah and Supreme Leader of Iran?**
Ali Khamenei has been the Supreme Leader of Iran since 1989, succeeding Ruhollah Khomeini after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Born in 1939 in Mashhad, he was raised in a religious family and became a cleric at age 11, studying Islamic law and Arabic. He was a key figure in the opposition to the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and was imprisoned six times before being exiled in 1975, returning in 1978. After the revolution, he held multiple high-ranking positions, including Vice Minister of Defense, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Friday Prayer Leader in Tehran, and Member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly. He served as President of Iran from 1981 to 1989, working closely with Khomeini during the Iran-Iraq War. Following Khomeini’s death, the Assembly of Experts appointed him Supreme Leader through political consensus and reinterpretation of religious leadership. He consolidated absolute power over Iran’s executive, legislative, and judicial branches, maintaining control through the IRGC, the judiciary, and state media. Despite varying presidential administrations, Khamenei remains the ultimate authority on domestic and foreign policy, upholding a confrontational stance toward the West, particularly the United States and Israel. His leadership has been highlighted internationally amid protests in Iran and U.S. threats, including from former President Donald Trump.

**Supreme Leader Khamenei: Iranian People Foil Enemy’s Attempts to Alter National Identity**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that the Iranian people have thwarted persistent efforts by adversaries to alter the nation's religious, historical, and cultural identity, reaffirming Iran's resilience against Western military and propaganda pressures. Speaking during a passionate commemoration event marking the birthday of Lady Fatima al-Zahra (Peace be upon her), Khamenei praised the Iranian people's national resistance and emphasized that despite challenges and shortcomings, Iran continues its forward trajectory. He highlighted the need for both defensive and offensive readiness to counter the enemy's propaganda and media campaigns targeting beliefs, hearts, and minds. Khamenei lauded the virtues of Lady Fatima al-Zahra, describing her as beyond human comprehension, and urged emulation in piety, justice, religious advocacy, marital conduct, and child-rearing. He underscored the significance of religious chanting (en'as) as a powerful force in 'resistance literature,' noting that ideas without proper literary expression fade over time. He defined national resistance as enduring pressures—military, economic, media, cultural, and political—exerted by oppressive powers, particularly Western propaganda aimed at regional expansion, resource control, and identity transformation. Khamenei noted that such attempts have spanned over a century and were ultimately defeated by the Islamic Revolution. He affirmed that the concept and literature of resistance have spread from Iran to other nations, and that Iran’s resilience has been tested by pressures sufficient to topple any other country. He emphasized that the enemy now faces a 'propaganda and media war' after realizing military pressure alone cannot subdue Iran. Khamenei called for deep understanding of the enemy’s objectives and targets, including Islamic, Shia, and revolutionary knowledge, and urged religious chanters to transform Husseini gatherings into centers of revolutionary commitment and youth protection. He stressed the importance of clarifying religious and jihad-related concepts using the lives of the Imams (Peace be upon them), countering enemy weaknesses while defending their own positions, and explaining Quranic principles in personal, social, and political domains. He concluded that well-crafted religious chants and accurate content can be more impactful than multiple sermons, warning against the infiltration of 'tyrannical modern culture' into Husseini gatherings. Finally, he dismissed minor issues like dust in Khuzestan as negligible compared to larger national challenges, affirming that the Iranian people continue to achieve progress through sincerity, dedication, and good intentions.

Speaking during a passionate ceremony commemorating the birth anniversary of Lady Fatima al-Zahra (peace be upon her), he praised the Iranian people's national resistance and emphasized that the spread of the concept and literature of resistance from Iran to other regional and international countries is a real and established phenomenon. He highlighted the importance of religious chanting (inshad) and Hussaini gatherings in reinforcing resistance and preserving revolutionary values, calling them essential components of 'resistance literature.' Khamenei defined national resistance as resilience against various pressures—military, economic, media, cultural, and political—from oppressive global powers. He noted that the West's media and political campaigns targeting Iran are signs of strategic pressure, with the ultimate goal of changing Iran's identity. He stressed that such efforts have persisted for over a century but were rendered ineffective by the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian people's steadfastness. He also urged religious chanters to transform religious gatherings into centers of revolutionary commitment, protect the youth from enemy influence, and focus on Islamic, Shia, and revolutionary knowledge while countering enemy propaganda. He emphasized that well-structured mourning chants can be more impactful than multiple sermons and warned against the infiltration of 'the music of the era of tyranny' into religious gatherings.

Ali Khamenei

Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (born 19 April 1939), is an Iranian cleric and politician who has served as the second supreme leader of Iran since 1989. His tenure as supreme leader, spanning 36 years, makes him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East and the second-longest-serving Iranian leader of the 20th and 21st centuries, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Born into the Khamenei family, he studied at a hawza in his hometown Mashhad, later settling in Qom in 1958 where he attended the classes of Ruhollah Khomeini. Khamenei became involved in opposition to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, and was arrested six times before being exiled for three years by the Shah's regime. Khamenei was a mainstream figure in the 1978–1979 Iranian Revolution, and upon its success, held many posts in the newly established Islamic Republic of Iran. In the aftermath of the revolution, he was the target of an attempted assassination that paralysed his right arm. There have been continued assassination threats against Ali Khamenei by Israel. Khamenei served as the third president of Iran from 1981 to 1989 during the Iran–Iraq War, when he also developed close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). After the death of Khomeini in 1989, Khamenei was elected supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts. As supreme leader, Khamenei supported Iran's nuclear program for civilian use while issuing a fatwa forbidding the production of weapons of mass destruction. Khamenei favoured economic privatization of state-owned industries and, with oil and gas reserves, transformed Iran into an "energy superpower". His foreign policy has centered on Shia Islamism and exporting the Iranian Revolution. Under Khamenei, Iran supported the "Axis of Resistance" coalition in the Syrian civil war, War in Iraq, Yemeni civil war and the Gaza war, as well as Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. A staunch critic of Israel and of Zionism, Khamenei has supported the Palestinians in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict; his rhetoric has included calls for Israel's destruction and antisemitic tropes

### History of Iran
. On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates, the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran–Iraq War. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise. Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Tens of thousands of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed when Iraq used chemical weapons in its warfare. Iraq was financially backed by Egypt, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China (which also sold weapons to Iran). There were more than 182,000 Kurdish victims of Iraq's chemical weapons during the eight-year war. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed that Saddam engaged in chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks; these agencies unanimously confirmed that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war. Starting on 19 July 1988 and lasting for about five months the government systematically executed thousands of political prisoners across Iran. This is commonly referred to as the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners or the 1988 Iranian Massacre. The main target was the membership of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party). Estimates of the number executed vary from 1,400 to 30,000

History of Iran

. On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named then president Ali Khamenei as the next Supreme Leader, and made a number of changes to Iran's constitution. A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's "charisma and clerical standing", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations. Under his reign Iran's regime is said – by at least one observer – to resemble more "a clerical oligarchy ... than an autocracy." Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani succeeded Khamenei as president on 3 August 1989, as a pragmatic conservative who served two four-year terms and focused his efforts on rebuilding the country's economy and infrastructure damaged by war, though hampered by low oil prices. Rafsanjani sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy. The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation. This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 the country remained neutral, restricting its action to the condemnation of the U.S. and allowing fleeing Iraqi aircraft and refugees into the country.[citation needed] Iran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades. This admiration had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government. The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama's ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power

History of Iran

. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary. President Rafsanjani's economic policies led to stronger relations with the outside world. But his government's relaxation of the enforcement of certain regulations on social behavior were met with some responses of widespread disenchantment among the general population with the ulama as rulers of the country. This led to the defeat of the government's candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist. He was beaten by an independent candidate from the Reformists, Mohammad Khatami. He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth. The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic. Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Tehran. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds. During his first term, President Khatami oversaw Iran’s second five-year development plan and introduced a new plan for 2000–2004 focused on economic reconstruction alongside social and political reforms. The plan aimed for privatization, job creation, and reduced subsidies but fell short on employment targets. Despite this, Iran saw improved economic indicators: real GDP growth rose to nearly 6 percent, unemployment and inflation declined, external debt dropped significantly, and the government authorized private banks for the first time since 1979. Poverty levels also decreased modestly. In the Majlis elections of 2000, for the first time liberals and Khatami’s supporters gained parliamentary control from conservatives. That same year, following the adoption of a new press law, authorities banned the publication of 16 reformist newspapers. Khatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament

### Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi (Persian: محمود هاشمی شاهرودی, 15 August 1948 – 24 December 2018) was an Iranian-Iraqi Twelver Shia cleric and principlist politician who was the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council from 14 August 2017 until his death on 24 December 2018. He was previously the Chief Justice of Iran from 1999 to 2009. He was also an Iraqi citizen and a former member of the Islamic Dawa Party. Shahroudi's official English-language biographical information from the Iranian Assembly of Experts' website opens with his education received in Najaf, Iraq from Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, the Islamic Dawa Party's founder, and takes the view that al-Sadr was killed; al-Sadr was executed without trial by Saddam Hussein's regime in April 1980. Hashemi Shahroudi became the leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which caused objections to his serving as the Head of Iran's Judiciary. He was a member of Iran's Guardian Council. Upon accepting his position as the Head of Iran's Judiciary, Shahroudi proclaimed: "I have inherited an utter ruin from the previous judiciary," referring to Mohammad Yazdi's 10 years in office. He appointed Saeed Mortazavi, a well known fundamentalist and controversial figure, prosecutor general of Iran. Later when Mortazavi led the judiciary against Khatami's reform movement, Shahroudi was prevented by regime hardliners from stopping Mortazavi's violent acts against dissidents or removing him from power. In July 2011 Shahroudi was appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to head an arbitration body to resolve an ongoing dispute between Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the parliament. He was a favorite as one of the potential successors of Ali Khamenei as Supreme Leader of Iran. According to one of his former alleged students, Shahroudi was considered among the wealthiest of Shi'i scholars in Iran, having amassed a substantial multi-million dollar revenue generating income from an export-import business.[failed verification] In 2010, he declared himself a Marja'.

Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi was born in Najaf, Iraq to ethnic Persian parents

Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi

. His father, Ali Hosseini Shahroudi was a scholar and teacher at the Najaf seminary and Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi completed elementary schooling at Najaf's Alaviye school before going to seminary. Ayatollah Khomeini and Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr were his teachers in Najaf. When he came to Iran following the Iranian Revolution, he taught at Qom and Hassan Nasrallah, current Secretary General of the Lebanese political and paramilitary party Hezbollah, was one of his students. In 1974, Ayatollah Shahroudi was imprisoned by the Ba'ath Party, due to political activities related to the Dawa Party. After the Iranian Revolution, Shahroudi moved to Iran. Ayatollah Shahroudi helped preserve the relationship between Ayatollah Khomeini and Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, as well as relaying the messages of Marja in Najaf to Ayatollah Khomeini. He was elected as a member of guardian council in 1995. Then he was appointed the head of the Judiciary in 1999. In July 2011, Shahroudi was appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to head an arbitration body to resolve an ongoing dispute between president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the parliament. The five-member body which Shahroudi headed is made up of "hard-liners known for their opposition to any reforms within the ruling system", according to the Associated Press news agency. The appointment was seen as a move to sideline or weaken the past President of Iran Hashemi Rafsanjani who helmed the Expediency Council, a body set up to arbitrate disputes within the ruling system in the Islamic Republic. Rafsanjani had alienated Khamenei and the Islamic establishment with "his tacit support" for opposition to the controversial June 2009 presidential elections results that re-elected president Ahmadinejad. Shahroudi denounced ISIL as a terrorist organization that commits the worst sins of killing people in the name of jihad. Shahroudi had also denounced ISIL for wrecking the infrastructure of civilizations and countries, and for committing murder. After Ayatollah Khamenei became leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Yazdi served as the president of the Supreme Court. He remained in the post for many years before being replaced by Ayatollah Shahroudi

### Ali Khamenei
. In contrast, the opposers believed that an individual leader was more efficient according to past experiences in the case of the Judiciary Council. Ebrahim Amini listed the summary of the reasons presented by the two sides. According to him, the opposers rejected the proposal because: I) Evidence for Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was true only for the guardianship of an individual and it was not clear who held the guardianship when there was a council. The guardianship of a council was not rooted in Hadiths and Islamic jurisprudence. II) Previous council-type organizations, such as the broadcasting council and supreme judicial council, were not successful in practice and the leadership council would not do well for similar reasons. III) People were accustomed to the leadership of an individual and a council of leaders was something unfamiliar to them. IV) An individual leader could act more decisively when dealing with critical and essential decisions and solving problems and crisis. On the other hand, the supporters of the proposal believed that: I) At the time, there were no Faqīh equal to Khomeini or even two or three levels lower than him so that he could fulfill the expectation of people. II) In the case of a council of leaders, the members could compensate each other if any of them had some shortage in a field. Finally, 45 members voted against the leadership council proposal while more than 20 people were in favor of it and the proposal was rejected. After the assembly rejected the idea of a Leadership Council, Khamenei was elected Leader by 60 of the 74 members present with Grand Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani receiving the remaining 14 votes. Although he eventually accepted the post, Khamenei made protestations of his unworthiness, saying "my nomination should make us all cry tears of blood", and debated with the mujtahids of the Assembly. Since Khamenei was not a marja' at the time—which the Iranian constitution required—he was named as the temporary Supreme Leader. Later, the constitution was amended to remove that requirement and the Assembly of Experts reconvened on 6 August 1989 to reconfirm Khamenei with 60 votes out of 64 present

Ali Khamenei

. On 29 April 1989, responding to the letter of Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, the head of committee responsible for revising the Constitution, asking Khomeini's viewpoint regarding the Marja' criteria, Khomeini said: "From the very beginning, I believed and insisted that there is no need for the requirements of marja'iyyat (authority in jurisprudence). A pious mujtahid (jurist-intellectual), who is approved by the esteemed Assembly of Experts (Majlis-i Khobregan), will suffice". In a video that surfaced during the 2017–2018 Iranian protests, Khamenei is seen before the assembly said he was not religiously qualified to be a Supreme leader. Khamenei, who was ranked as a Hujjat al-Islam and not a marja' as required by the Iranian constitution, said he would only be a "ceremonial leader", and was reassured by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani the position would be "temporary" until a referendum, apparently planned for one year later. On 29 August 2022, Kazem al-Haeri announced his resignation from the position of marja due to old age and illness. This was described as the first time in history a marja has ever resigned from his position. He called on his followers to follow Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran as "the best person for the leadership of our people and removing the aggressors". Khamenei's era has differed from that of his predecessor. He has, however, continued Khomeini's policy of "balancing one group against another, making sure that no single side gains too much power". But lacking Khomeini's charisma and clerical standing, he has developed personal networks, first inside the armed forces and then among the clerics, while administering the major bonyads and seminaries of Qom and Mashhad. Having been Supreme Leader for three decades, Khamenei has been able to place many loyalists throughout Iran's major institutions, "building a system that serves and protects him". Former cleric Mehdi Khalaji and Saeid Golkar, describe Khamenei's system as having creating a "parallel structure" for each of the country's institutions (army, intelligence agencies, etc.) to keep those institutions weak

Ali Khamenei

. According to Vali Nasr of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, "[Khamenei] [took] many of the powers of the presidency with him and [turned] the office of the supreme leader into the omnipotent overseer of Iran's political scene". In Nasr's view, Khamenei is an "unusual sort of dictator". Officials under Khamenei influence the country's various powers, and sometimes bickering, institutions, including "the parliament, the presidency, the judiciary, the Revolutionary Guards, the military, the intelligence services, the police agencies, the clerical elite, the Friday prayer leaders and much of the media", as well as various "nongovernmental foundations, organizations, councils, seminaries and business groups". Khamenei issues decrees and makes the final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy and everything else in Iran. Khamenei regularly meets with the president, cabinet members, head and officials of the judiciary branch, parliamentarians, among others, and tells them what to do. Khamenei has also fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. Khamenei meets with foreign dignitaries, but he does not travel internationally; anyone wishing to see him must travel to Iran. Apart from his time in Najaf as a student, Khamenei traveled to Libya during his time as president. In his speeches, Khamenei regularly mentions many familiar themes of the 1979 revolution: justice, independence, self-sufficiency, Islamic government and resolute opposition to Israel and the United States, while rarely mentioning other revolutionary ideals such as democracy and greater government transparency. According to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Khamenei has "resisted Rafsanjani's attempts to find a modus vivendi with the United States, Khatami's aspirations for a more democratic Islamic state, and Ahmadinejad's penchant for outright confrontation." In 2007, Khamenei called for privatising state-owned companies, including the telephone company, three banks and dozens of small oil and petrochemical enterprises
