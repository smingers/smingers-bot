# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question
Will Ali Khamenei cease to be Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027?

## Resolution Criteria
For this question, "cease to be Supreme Leader" means that Khamenei either dies, is forcibly removed from power, or voluntarily steps down from the position of Supreme Leader of Iran before the end of 2026.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The most relevant information comes from reports published in January 2026, so it is quite recent. The sources, including THE TIMES OF BENGAL and other unspecified intelligence reports, appear to be credible, though potential biases in reporting cannot be ruled out entirely. Some of the information, such as Khamenei's advanced age and health concerns, is likely already priced into the base rate.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Khamenei (86) has reportedly retreated to a fortified Tehran bunker due to fears of U.S. military action [3][4][5][7][8][9][10]. His public appearances have sharply decreased since June 2025 conflicts with Israel, with Western intelligence indicating physical and cognitive decline [15][17].
- Credible intelligence confirms a "Plan B" to flee to Moscow with 20 loyalists if security forces defect [15][16][17][18], modeled after Bashar al-Assad's 2024 escape [16][17].

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Mass protests since December 2025 (30,000+ deaths per reports [1][2][6]) over economic collapse have spread to previously loyal cities like Qom [15][16].
- Former President Trump has threatened "decisive strikes" if protests are violently suppressed [4][17], with warships deployed regionally [4][12]. Khamenei blames the U.S. for unrest but admitted "several thousand" protester deaths [12].

**WEAK Evidence**
- Succession plans are actively contested between factions backing:
  - **Hassan Rouhani** (moderate ex-president)
  - **Hasan Khomeini** (revolutionary founder's grandson)
  - *Not* his son Mojtaba, as hereditary rule violates Islamic Republic principles [19][20].

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence:**
- The reports of Khamenei's retreat to a bunker and declining health push the probability UP from the base rate. This suggests a higher likelihood of his departure before 2027, either through incapacitation or forced exile. Adjusting UP by approximately 20 percentage points.
- The credible intelligence on Khamenei's "Plan B" to flee the country also pushes the probability UP, indicating a high likelihood of his departure before 2027. Adjusting UP by approximately 15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The mass protests and economic collapse in Iran push the probability UP from the base rate, as they increase the risk of regime instability and Khamenei's potential removal. Adjusting UP by approximately 10 percentage points.
- The U.S. military threats and pressure also push the probability UP, as they heighten the risk of a potential conflict or intervention that could lead to Khamenei's departure. Adjusting UP by approximately 5 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- The contested succession plans do not significantly update the probability, as they do not directly indicate Khamenei's departure before 2027. No adjustment needed.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 22.6%:
- Adjustment 1: +20% for Khamenei's declining health and retreat to a bunker
- Adjustment 2: +15% for credible intelligence on Khamenei's "Plan B" escape
- Adjustment 3: +10% for mass protests and economic collapse in Iran
- Adjustment 4: +5% for U.S. military threats and pressure
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +50%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be less than 10%, it would imply that Khamenei is highly likely to remain in power despite the significant threats to his rule, which seems implausible given the evidence. Conversely, if the probability were to be greater than 90%, it would suggest a near-certainty of his departure, which may not account for potential stabilization efforts or Khamenei's resilience.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 50% adjustment from the base rate is substantial but justified by the strong and moderate evidence pointing to a high likelihood of Khamenei's departure before 2027. The base rate serves as a reasonable starting point, but the current situation appears to have significantly shifted the probability.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (Khamenei's health and escape plans) having the largest impact on the probability.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the extreme nature of the current situation, there is a risk of overestimating the probability of Khamenei's departure. However, the evidence suggests that the regime is facing a genuine crisis, and a significant adjustment from the base rate is warranted.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully examined the current evidence regarding the likelihood of Ali Khamenei ceasing to be the Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027. The base rate of 22.6% appears to be outdated, as the situation in Iran has deteriorated significantly in recent months.

The most compelling evidence points to a high probability of Khamenei's departure before 2027. The reports of his retreat to a fortified bunker, declining health, and cognitive issues, combined with credible intelligence on contingency plans to flee the country, suggest a substantial risk of his incapacitation or forced exile. The mass protests and economic collapse in Iran, along with the U.S. military threats, further increase the likelihood of regime instability and Khamenei's potential removal.

While there are some weaker signals, such as the contested succession plans, the overall evidence paints a picture of a Supreme Leader facing unprecedented threats to his continued rule. The convergence of critical health risks, potential regime collapse, and external pressure makes Khamenei's departure before 2027 a probable outcome.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Khamenei's health decline and escape plans
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 22.6%
- Total adjustment: +50%
- Final estimate: 72.6%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 9/10

**Probability: 72.6%**
