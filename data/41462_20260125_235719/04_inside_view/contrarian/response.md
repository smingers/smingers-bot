# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will Ali Khamenei cease to be Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027?

## Resolution Criteria
The question asks whether Ali Khamenei will cease to be Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027. This means he would need to either die, be removed from power, or voluntarily step down before the end of 2026.

## Base Rate from Outside View
The base rate provided is 22.6%, based on reference classes of longevity of supreme leaders in authoritarian regimes, longevity of supreme leaders in Iran, and longevity of Iranian political leaders. The confidence in this base rate is rated 8/10.

## Current Research
# Research Synthesis

The research synthesis covers a range of factors that could impact Khamenei's continued rule as Supreme Leader, including his critical health and security situation, regime instability and escape contingencies, and U.S. pressure and military threats.

## Source Analysis

The evidence presented comes from a variety of credible news sources, including reports from THE TIMES OF BENGAL and other reputable outlets. The information is relatively recent, with the most recent article dated January 2026. 

There are some potential biases to consider, as the reporting may be influenced by geopolitical tensions and the volatile situation in Iran. However, the evidence does seem to go beyond speculation and anecdotes, providing a fairly comprehensive assessment of the current state of affairs.

Much of this information does not appear to be fully priced into the base rate, as the synthesis covers developments that have occurred more recently, such as the mass protests since December 2025 and Khamenei's reported retreat to a fortified bunker.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Khamenei's critical health and security situation, including reports of physical and cognitive decline, and his retreat to a fortified bunker (Evidence 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 15, 17)
- Regime instability and escape contingencies, including mass protests, potential security force defections, and documented plans to flee to Moscow (Evidence 1, 2, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18)

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- Contested succession plans, with factions backing different candidates (Evidence 19, 20)
- U.S. pressure and military threats, including the deployment of warships and threats of "decisive strikes" (Evidence 3, 4, 12, 17)

**WEAK Evidence:**
- Conflicting reports about the momentum of the protests and the loyalty of the IRGC (Evidence 4, 11, 12)
- Limitations in verifying Khamenei's health status due to his bunker isolation (Evidence 7, 8, 9, 10)

## Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP:**
- Khamenei's critical health and security situation, with reports of physical and cognitive decline, and his retreat to a fortified bunker (Evidence 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 15, 17): +25-35 percentage points
- Regime instability and escape contingencies, including mass protests, potential security force defections, and documented plans to flee to Moscow (Evidence 1, 2, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18): +20-30 percentage points

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing DOWN:**
- Contested succession plans, with factions backing different candidates (Evidence 19, 20): -5-10 percentage points
- U.S. pressure and military threats, including the deployment of warships and threats of "decisive strikes" (Evidence 3, 4, 12, 17): -5-10 percentage points

**Evidence Already Captured in Base Rate:**
- None

## Integration

Starting from the base rate of 22.6%:
- Adjustment 1 (STRONG evidence pushing UP): +25-35 percentage points
- Adjustment 2 (STRONG evidence pushing UP): +20-30 percentage points
- Adjustment 3 (MODERATE evidence pushing DOWN): -5-10 percentage points
- Adjustment 4 (MODERATE evidence pushing DOWN): -5-10 percentage points
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +25-45 percentage points

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is below 10%, it would require a dramatic turnaround in the situation, such as Khamenei's health significantly improving, the protests losing momentum, and the U.S. backing down from its threats. Conversely, if my prediction is above 90%, it would require the regime's collapse to be even more imminent and severe than the current evidence suggests.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 22.6% seems reasonable, but the cumulative adjustment of 25-45 percentage points is justified given the substantial and recent developments that are not fully captured in the base rate, such as Khamenei's retreat to a bunker, the mass protests, and the increased U.S. pressure.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of the updates is proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the STRONG evidence pushing the probability up by 45-65 percentage points, and the MODERATE evidence pushing it down by 10-20 percentage points.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not pushing the final estimate to the extremes, even though the STRONG evidence would justify a higher probability.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base rate of 22.6% is likely too low given the current evidence. The research synthesis highlights several factors that suggest Khamenei's continued rule as Supreme Leader is in serious jeopardy:

1. Khamenei's critical health and security situation, including reports of physical and cognitive decline, and his retreat to a fortified bunker. This suggests he may not be able to maintain his grip on power much longer.

2. The regime's instability and the existence of documented escape contingencies, such as plans to flee to Moscow. This indicates that the regime is preparing for the possibility of Khamenei's departure, whether voluntary or forced.

3. The mass protests and the potential for security force defections, which could lead to the collapse of the regime and Khamenei's removal from power.

4. The increased U.S. pressure and military threats, which could further destabilize the regime and hasten Khamenei's departure.

While there are some moderating factors, such as the contested succession plans and the potential for the regime to stabilize, the overall evidence points to a high likelihood of Khamenei ceasing to be Supreme Leader before 2027.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Khamenei's critical health and security situation, regime instability and escape contingencies
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 22.6%
- Total adjustment: +25-45 percentage points
- Final estimate: 47.6-67.6%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 57.6%**
