# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: historian
You are a historian and superforecaster. Focus on historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past. Consider how often similar situations have resolved in various ways. Use history to inform your probability estimate.

## Question
Will Ali Khamenei cease to be Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027?

## Resolution Criteria
For the purposes of this analysis, "cease to be Supreme Leader" is defined as Khamenei either dying, being forced out of office, or fleeing the country before the end of 2026.

## Base Rate from Outside View

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The information provided is relatively recent, with the most relevant reports from January 2026. The sources appear to be credible, including mainstream media outlets and reports citing intelligence sources close to the Iranian government. There is potential for some bias in the reporting, as the situation is highly volatile and politically charged. However, the details provided, such as Khamenei's relocation to a secure bunker and the active succession planning, do not seem to be already priced into the base rate.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- Khamenei (86) has reportedly retreated to a fortified Tehran bunker due to fears of U.S. military action, with his public appearances sharply decreasing since June 2025 conflicts with Israel, indicating physical and cognitive decline.
- Succession plans are actively contested between factions, with no clear heir apparent, violating the principle of hereditary rule in the Islamic Republic.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Mass protests since December 2025 (30,000+ deaths) over economic collapse have spread to previously loyal cities like Qom, indicating regime instability.
- Credible intelligence confirms a "Plan B" to flee to Moscow with 20 loyalists if security forces defect, modeled after Bashar al-Assad's 2024 escape.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Former President Trump has threatened "decisive strikes" if protests are violently suppressed, with warships deployed regionally, but no direct military action has occurred yet.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence (UP):**
- The advanced age and declining health of Khamenei, combined with the contested succession, suggest a high likelihood of his departure before 2027. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 20-25 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (UP):**
- The widespread protests and regime instability, as well as the documented escape preparations, further increase the probability of Khamenei's departure. This pushes the probability UP by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence (NEUTRAL):**
- The U.S. military threats, while concerning, have not yet materialized into direct action. This evidence is largely already captured in the base rate and does not significantly impact the probability.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 22.6%:
- Adjustment 1 (STRONG evidence): +22.5%
- Adjustment 2 (MODERATE evidence): +12.5%
- Adjustment 3 (WEAK evidence): 0%
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +35%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is significantly higher than 90%, it would require the regime to completely collapse and Khamenei to be forcibly removed or flee the country. This seems plausible given the evidence, but not a certainty.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 22.6% is based on historical precedents, which are now being significantly challenged by the current situation. The large deviation from the base rate is justified by the strong and moderate evidence.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustment.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not adjusting the probability to the maximum of 100%. There is still a chance that the regime could stabilize or that Khamenei could cling to power.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I place significant weight on the historical precedents and patterns observed in authoritarian regimes, particularly in Iran. The current situation facing Khamenei and the Iranian regime bears striking similarities to the downfall of other long-ruling leaders, such as Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

The advanced age and declining health of Khamenei, coupled with the contested succession and active preparations for his potential departure, are clear indicators that his continued rule as Supreme Leader is under severe threat. The widespread protests and economic collapse further undermine the regime's stability, making Khamenei's departure before 2027 a probable outcome.

While the U.S. military threats add to the pressure on Khamenei, the lack of direct action thus far suggests this factor is already largely priced into the base rate. The key drivers appear to be the internal dynamics within Iran, particularly the regime's inability to maintain control and the lack of a clear successor.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Khamenei's declining health and contested succession
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 22.6%
- Total adjustment: +35%
- Final estimate: 57.6%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 57.6%**
