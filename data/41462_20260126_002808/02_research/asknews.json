The decision reportedly followed heightened internal unrest after protests began on December 28, 2025, and a significant U.S. military buildup in the region. The U.S. deployment has led Iranian officials to assess the threat level to Khamenei as 'unprecedented.' Khamenei is said to have moved into a high-security underground facility in Tehran in early January 2026, with the bunker described as a network of interconnected tunnels specially constructed for protection against potential attacks. To ensure continuity of governance, his son, Mesud Khamenei, is managing daily state affairs and serving as the primary communication channel. Protest-related internet shutdowns, implemented on January 8, 2026, have caused severe economic damage, with Ali Hekimcevadi, head of the Iranian Computer Engineers and IT Sector Professional Union, estimating daily losses of 2\u20133 billion Iranian toman (approximately $20.6 million). These losses primarily affect digital businesses and IT service providers. According to the Iran Human Rights News Agency (HRANA), over 5,400 people have died in protests and related violence, including 208 security personnel, with the death toll updated from 5,137 to 5,459 based on on-the-ground verification. The protests, initially sparked by the rapid devaluation of Iran's currency and worsening economic conditions, have spread nationwide and now include calls for regime change. The Iranian Martyrs and Veterans Foundation Forensic Medical Organization reported 3,117 fatalities, with 2,427 victims identified as security forces and civilians killed by 'armed terrorist groups.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 12:30 PM\nSource: [H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/iranda-benzeri-gorulmemis-tehdit-abd-asker-gonderdi-hamaneyin-yeraltina-indigi-iddia-edildi-43092620)\n\n**Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Khamenei Moves Underground Amid Escalating U.S.-Iran Tensions and Domestic Unrest**\nAmid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, reports have emerged that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has moved into an underground bunker in Tehran, reportedly due to concerns over a potential American strike. While the Iranian government has not officially confirmed the move, sources cited by Iran International indicate it was driven by security reasons amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including deploying warships and the deadly Tomahawk missiles. Iran\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesperson, Brigadier General Reza Talaei-Nik, claimed that Iran\u2019s missile capabilities have significantly strengthened since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024, citing improvements in both quantity and quality, along with enhanced domestic missile production and defense systems. The situation is further complicated by ongoing domestic unrest, including large-scale protests at the end of December 2025 that were violently suppressed, with human rights organizations reporting over 25,000 deaths\u2014far exceeding Iran\u2019s official figure of approximately 3,100. Additionally, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport Iranian immigrants from the U.S. These developments collectively signal a highly precarious moment in the Middle East, with rumors of Khamenei transferring power to his third son potentially indicating a major shift in Iran\u2019s internal politics and regional dynamics.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 12:16 PM\nSource: [News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/world/middle-east-iran-supreme-leader-khamenei-underground-shelter-amid-fears-of-us-attack-tomahawk-cruise-missile-abraham-lincon-nears-10106471.html)\n\n**Fearing U.S. Airstrikes, Iran's Supreme Leader Said to Have Gone Underground | Khamenei | Trump | Trump**\nAmid escalating tensions in Iran due to the government's harsh crackdown on mass protests since December 28, 2025, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, is reported to have retreated to a heavily fortified underground bunker in Tehran, according to Iran International and other international media. The bunker is connected to a complex tunnel system capable of withstanding high-intensity strikes. To prevent electronic signals from being used for a potential 'decapitation strike,' Khamenei has ordered top officials and aides to disable all electronic communication devices. The Supreme Leader, who was previously active on X (formerly Twitter), has not posted since January 17, 2026, confirming his secluded and restricted communications status. Instead of his eldest son Mojtaba Khamenei, traditionally seen as a potential successor, his younger son Masoud Khamenei, 53, is now managing daily affairs and serving as the sole communication link between the Supreme Leader, President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the National Security Council. This shift underscores Masoud\u2019s critical role as the 'last voice' maintaining regime continuity. The move follows U.S. President Trump\u2019s announcement on January 23, 2026, confirming the deployment of a large 'armada' of U.S. forces toward the Persian Gulf, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group advancing from the Indian Ocean. Trump warned that the U.S. is closely monitoring Iran\u2019s violent suppression of protests and stands ready to act. In response, Iran has adopted a 'defensive toughness' stance: President Pezeshkian declared that any attack on the Supreme Leader would be considered an act of 'full-scale war,' and the National Security Council announced that such an attack would trigger an immediate national 'Jihad' declaration.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 07:43 PM\nSource: [The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/26/1/24/n14683286.htm)\n\n**Report: Khamenei moved to underground bunker**\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been moved to an underground bunker amid growing concerns over a potential American strike, according to Iran International, citing assessments by senior security officials.

He declared, 'Our finger is on the trigger,' and cautioned that any miscalculation by Washington or Tel Aviv could lead to a 'destiny even more painful.' Pakpour referenced the 12-day war in June 2025, when Israel, with U.S. backing, conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear, military, and residential sites, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, including senior commanders, scientists, and civilians. Iran responded immediately. Pakpour emphasized that Iran is 'more prepared than ever' and ready to follow orders from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He reiterated that Tehran will not hesitate to defend its interests and security, and will respond immediately to any act of recklessness or miscalculation by the U.S. or Israel. The warning followed renewed U.S. threats: former President Donald Trump confirmed the deployment of a 'large fleet' toward the Gulf, stating he is 'watching them very closely,' though he preferred 'nothing happens.'

The U.S. has reportedly completed preparations for a potential military operation, though no final decision has been made, as confirmed by Israeli media. U.S. Central Command Commander Brad Cooper met with Israeli officials, while former President Donald Trump stated he is closely monitoring Iran, emphasizing a large naval presence in the region. Trump previously threatened military action if Iran continued its crackdown on anti-government protests that began on December 28, 2025, which he claimed his rhetoric prevented 800 deaths. Khamenei has accused the U.S. of orchestrating sedition and claimed the U.S. must be held accountable, while President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that an attack on the Supreme Leader would amount to 'all-out war.' Iran denies executing demonstrators, with state media reporting 3,117 deaths\u20142,427 labeled 'martyrs'\u2014while human rights groups estimate up to 25,000 fatalities.

The internet blackout, initiated on January 8, coincided with a violent government crackdown during nationwide protests. Yousef Pezeshkian, son of the president and a government adviser, urged restoration, warning that prolonged disconnection risks increasing public dissatisfaction and expanding the pool of discontent.

The plan involves a small group of approximately 20 close aides and family members, including his son and designated successor Mojtaba, should the military and security forces fail to support his orders to suppress protests. The report notes that Khamenei views Russia as his only viable escape route, citing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and perceived cultural affinity between Iran and Russia. The plan is partially modeled on the escape of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who fled Damascus to Moscow in December 2024 before the city fell to opposition forces.

Speaking during a ceremony marking the birth anniversary of Imam Ali and the first anniversary of the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, Khamenei attributed recent currency fluctuations and rising exchange rates to foreign interference, stating that 'the unexplained rise and instability in the exchange rate is not natural\u2014it is the enemy's work.' He affirmed that the enemy would seize any opportunity to undermine Iran, and that Iranian authorities were prepared to respond. Khamenei distinguished between legitimate protest and chaos, asserting that while protests are acceptable, those inciting disorder must be confronted. He declared Iran's resolve to stand firm against enemies, stating, 'We will not retreat before the enemy. With faith in God and the people's support, we will bring the enemy to their knees.' Protests began on December 28, 2025, in Tehran's Grand Bazaar due to severe losses in the value of the Iranian rial and economic hardship, spreading to multiple cities. The demonstrations led to fatalities: a 21-year-old member of the Basij militia died in Kuhdasht, Lorestan Province, on December 31, 2025, with 13 police officers injured. In Lordegan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, two people were killed on January 1, 2026. In Azna, Lorestan, a police station attack during protests resulted in three deaths on the same day.

A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Iran remains under severe international sanctions, including renewed UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025, initiated by Britain, France, and Germany.

He emphasized the 'arrogant nature' of the United States, suggesting it refuses to accept any conditions or compromises.

Khamenei described the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. as a 'fundamental conflict of interests.' He emphasized that any U.S. overtures for interaction would be reviewed 'at some point in the future, but only when' these conditions are met. This statement was published in the Supreme Leader's Telegram channel. Earlier, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Tehran would consider resuming nuclear talks when the U.S. is ready for a 'honest dialogue.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:54 PM\nSource: [NEWS.am](http://news.am/rus/news/913210.html)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Sets Condition for Cooperation with the U.S.: End Support for Israel**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that Iran will only resume cooperation with the United States if Washington ceases supporting Israel. 'Americans sometimes say they want to cooperate with Iran. Cooperation with Iran is impossible as long as the U.S. continues to support the accursed Zionist regime, maintains military bases, and interferes in regional affairs,' Khamenei said, according to Reuters. He added that there is no expectation of restored relations between Tehran and Washington in the near future, and any potential normalization would only occur later. In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated his readiness to strike a deal with Iran if Tehran is willing to take the initiative, emphasizing that 'the hand of friendship and cooperation is open.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:53 PM\nSource: [\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8179468)\n\n**Iran Khamenei says will not cooperate with US while it backs Israel**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, that Iran would only consider cooperation with the United States if it ceased supporting Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and stopped interfering in regional affairs. He emphasized that the 'arrogant nature of the United States accepts nothing other than submission.' These remarks were made during a student gathering in Tehran commemorating the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy, a pivotal event in the Islamic Revolution. The statement follows a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel that began in mid-June 2025, during which Israel launched a major bombing campaign, prompting Iran to respond with missile and drone strikes. The U.S. briefly joined the conflict with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, disrupting nuclear negotiations that had commenced in April 2025. A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Khamenei asserted that 'if the country becomes strong and the enemy realises that confronting this strong nation will not yield profit but will bring loss, the country will certainly gain immunity.' Iran continues to face severe international sanctions, including the reimposition of UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025 by Britain, France, and Germany, after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in an interview with Al Jazeera on November 2, 2025, affirmed that Tehran remains 'ready to enter negotiations' with Washington\u2014but only on its nuclear program, excluding missile capabilities. He added that talks could resume 'whenever the Americans are ready to negotiate on an equal footing and based on mutual interests. Apparently, they are not in a hurry. We are not in a hurry either.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource: [AFP](http://doc.afp.com/82UN8CQ)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Outlines Key Conditions for Future Cooperation with the U.S.**\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, during a speech to Iranian students commemorating the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, that Iran will only consider U.S. requests for cooperation if Washington fully ceases supporting Israel, closes its military bases in the Middle East, and stops interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Khamenei described the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. as an 'essential conflict of interests,' and emphasized that any potential interaction would be considered 'sometime in the future,' but not in the near term.

Khamenei also dismissed Trump's claim that the U.S. had destroyed Iran's nuclear capabilities, stating, 'Keep dreaming!' He emphasized that U.S. interference in Iran's nuclear program is 'unacceptable, wrong, and coercive.' The rejection comes after five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, which ended in a 12-day conflict in June 2025, during which Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite repeated requests, Iran has denied access to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect a newly accelerated, secret nuclear facility under Mount Kirka near Natanz. Iran has officially declared it will no longer abide by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stating the agreement's term has expired and is no longer valid. The Ukrainian outlet OBOZREVATEL reported that Iran has ceased compliance with its nuclear restrictions.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource: [OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/novosti-mir/tse-ne-ugoda-a-navyazuvannya-i-zalyakuvannya-lider-iranu-vidhiliv-propozitsiyu-trampa-pro-vidnovlennya-peregovoriv.htm)\n\n**Iran's Supreme Leader Rejects Imminent Nuclear Talks with the U.S.**\nOn 23 September 2025, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned against nuclear negotiations with the United States, stating that such talks would not serve Iran's national interests and would lead to 'grave' and 'irreparable' losses. He described the U.S. position as a pre\u2011determined outcome, demanding the cessation of Iran's nuclear activities and uranium enrichment, and framed the process as 'dictation and imposition' rather than negotiation. Khamenei also cited U.S. demands for Iran to abandon short\u2011, medium\u2011 and long\u2011range missiles, claiming this would prevent Iran from responding to potential aggression. He listed hostile U.S. actions over recent years and called any nuclear talks a 'dead end.' The article references Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the U.S. withdrawal in May 2018, and the resumption of sanctions, as well as the 22 June 2024 U.S. airstrike on three Iranian nuclear sites following Israeli attacks in June 2024.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 11:24 PM\nSource: [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250924/6a25b01669274ab4986f0d9df5fb46d6/c.html)\n\n"
