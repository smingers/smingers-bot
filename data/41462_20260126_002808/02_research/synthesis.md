## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on current developments in January 2026, there is a **significant possibility** Ali Khamenei will cease to be Supreme Leader before 2027. Critical factors increasing this likelihood include:

1. **Unprecedented Regime Instability**: Iran is experiencing its largest protests in years, with explicit calls for regime change and rejection of Khamenei's policies [1][17][18]. Security forces have killed thousands, yet demonstrations continue across major cities, reflecting systemic vulnerability [1][3][20]. The reported bunker relocation indicates extreme threat perception [2][5][9].

2. **Age and Health Pressures**: At 86, Khamenei's rare public appearances and Western intelligence assessments of declining health [17][18][19] create succession urgency. His 1981 assassination attempt left permanent disabilities [14], and recent conflicts have further strained his capacity.

3. **Existential External Threats**: U.S. naval deployments and explicit threats from former President Trump have prompted Khamenei's bunker relocation and escape plans to Russia [3][5][17][18]. Diplomatic efforts by Gulf states to prevent U.S. intervention appear fragile [3][4].

4. **Documented Contingency Plans**: Credible reports confirm escape protocols to Moscow if security forces fracture, with assets pre-positioned [17][18]. This plan would effectively end his rule even without death.

However, scenarios could preserve his leadership:
- **Brutal Repression Success**: Previous crackdowns (e.g., 2019) suggest regime resilience [14][16].
- **U.S. Restraint**: Gulf-state diplomacy might avert direct confrontation [3][4].

Considering Khamenei's advanced age, mass mobilization against his rule, and explicit contingency plans, the balance of evidence suggests **he is more likely than not to leave power before 2027**—either through exile, incapacitation, or death. Should protests wane and U.S. pressure subside, he could theoretically remain leader, but current trajectories indicate deteriorating control.

**Key Citations**:  
- Contingency escape plan to Russia [17][18]  
- Current bunker relocation [2][5][8][9]  
- U.S. military threats [3][6][11]  
- Protest scale/casualties [1][3][12]  
- Age/health concerns [14][17][19]

**Unprecedented Threat in Iran: Allegations of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Hiding Underground Amid Protests and U.S. Military Buildup**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is reportedly being hidden in an underground bunker due to unprecedented security threats, according to sources close to opposition groups. The decision reportedly followed heightened internal unrest after protests began on December 28, 2025, and a significant U.S. military buildup in the region. The U.S. deployment has led Iranian officials to assess the threat level to Khamenei as 'unprecedented.' Khamenei is said to have moved into a high-security underground facility in Tehran in early January 2026, with the bunker described as a network of interconnected tunnels specially constructed for protection against potential attacks. To ensure continuity of governance, his son, Mesud Khamenei, is managing daily state affairs and serving as the primary communication channel. Protest-related internet shutdowns, implemented on January 8, 2026, have caused severe economic damage, with Ali Hekimcevadi, head of the Iranian Computer Engineers and IT Sector Professional Union, estimating daily losses of 2–3 billion Iranian toman (approximately $20.6 million). These losses primarily affect digital businesses and IT service providers. According to the Iran Human Rights News Agency (HRANA), over 5,400 people have died in protests and related violence, including 208 security personnel, with the death toll updated from 5,137 to 5,459 based on on-the-ground verification. The protests, initially sparked by the rapid devaluation of Iran's currency and worsening economic conditions, have spread nationwide and now include calls for regime change. The Iranian Martyrs and Veterans Foundation Forensic Medical Organization reported 3,117 fatalities, with 2,427 victims identified as security forces and civilians killed by 'armed terrorist groups.'

**Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei Moves Underground Amid Escalating U.S.-Iran Tensions and Domestic Unrest**
Amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, reports have emerged that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has moved into an underground bunker in Tehran, reportedly due to concerns over a potential American strike. While the Iranian government has not officially confirmed the move, sources cited by Iran International indicate it was driven by security reasons amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including deploying warships and the deadly Tomahawk missiles. Iran’s Defense Ministry spokesperson, Brigadier General Reza Talaei-Nik, claimed that Iran’s missile capabilities have significantly strengthened since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024, citing improvements in both quantity and quality, along with enhanced domestic missile production and defense systems. The situation is further complicated by ongoing domestic unrest, including large-scale protests at the end of December 2025 that were violently suppressed, with human rights organizations reporting over 25,000 deaths—far exceeding Iran’s official figure of approximately 3,100. Additionally, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport Iranian immigrants from the U.S. These developments collectively signal a highly precarious moment in the Middle East, with rumors of Khamenei transferring power to his third son potentially indicating a major shift in Iran’s internal politics and regional dynamics.

**Fearing U.S. Airstrikes, Iran's Supreme Leader Said to Have Gone Underground | Khamenei | Trump | Trump**
Amid escalating tensions in Iran due to the government's harsh crackdown on mass protests since December 28, 2025, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, is reported to have retreated to a heavily fortified underground bunker in Tehran, according to Iran International and other international media. The bunker is connected to a complex tunnel system capable of withstanding high-intensity strikes. To prevent electronic signals from being used for a potential 'decapitation strike,' Khamenei has ordered top officials and aides to disable all electronic communication devices. The Supreme Leader, who was previously active on X (formerly Twitter), has not posted since January 17, 2026, confirming his secluded and restricted communications status. Instead of his eldest son Mojtaba Khamenei, traditionally seen as a potential successor, his younger son Masoud Khamenei, 53, is now managing daily affairs and serving as the sole communication link between the Supreme Leader, President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the National Security Council. This shift underscores Masoud’s critical role as the 'last voice' maintaining regime continuity. The move follows U.S. President Trump’s announcement on January 23, 2026, confirming the deployment of a large 'armada' of U.S. forces toward the Persian Gulf, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group advancing from the Indian Ocean. Trump warned that the U.S. is closely monitoring Iran’s violent suppression of protests and stands ready to act. In response, Iran has adopted a 'defensive toughness' stance: President Pezeshkian declared that any attack on the Supreme Leader would be considered an act of 'full-scale war,' and the National Security Council announced that such an attack would trigger an immediate national 'Jihad' declaration.

**Report: Khamenei moved to underground bunker**
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been moved to an underground bunker amid growing concerns over a potential American strike, according to Iran International, citing assessments by senior security officials. His son, Masoud Khamenei, has assumed governing authority during this period. Iran Times, a publication linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), reported that Iran's defensive and missile capabilities have significantly improved, now being described as both quantitatively and qualitatively superior to those during Operation Rising Lion in June 2025. Tensions remain high, with U.S. Central Command Commander Gen. Brad Cooper arriving in Israel on January 24, 2026, for meetings with senior Israeli officials. A security source confirmed there is currently no operational coordination between the U.S. and Israel regarding Iran, and it remains unclear how U.S. President Donald Trump will respond. In Jerusalem, there is deep concern that a potential nuclear agreement could allow Iran to retain missile capabilities threatening Israel while continuing to support regional proxies.

**'Finger on the trigger': Iran's Revolutionary Guard warns U.S. and Israel against any miscalculation**
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Commander, Major General Mahommad Pakpour, issued a strong warning to the United States and Israel on January 22, 2026, stating that Iran's forces are prepared for any provocation. He declared, 'Our finger is on the trigger,' and cautioned that any miscalculation by Washington or Tel Aviv could lead to a 'destiny even more painful.' Pakpour referenced the 12-day war in June 2025, when Israel, with U.S. backing, conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear, military, and residential sites, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, including senior commanders, scientists, and civilians. Iran responded immediately. Pakpour emphasized that Iran is 'more prepared than ever' and ready to follow orders from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He reiterated that Tehran will not hesitate to defend its interests and security, and will respond immediately to any act of recklessness or miscalculation by the U.S. or Israel. The warning followed renewed U.S. threats: former President Donald Trump confirmed the deployment of a 'large fleet' toward the Gulf, stating he is 'watching them very closely,' though he preferred 'nothing happens.' In response, Iranian Joint Command Leader General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi stated that if the U.S. launches another attack, 'all American interests, bases, and centers of influence' would be considered 'legitimate targets' by Iranian armed forces. The protests in Iran, which began on December 28, 2025, were initially driven by economic grievances due to Western sanctions, rising living costs, and the collapse of the rial against the U.S. dollar, but have since ceased.

**Khamenei Seeks Shelter in Underground Bunker Amid Fears of U.S. Attack**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is reportedly hiding in a fortified underground bunker in Tehran amid concerns over a potential U.S. attack. According to The Times of Israel, citing the opposition news site Iran International, senior officials assessed an 'increased risk of a potential U.S. strike' due to the deployment of significant U.S. military forces in the region. The bunker, described as having 'interconnected tunnels,' is said to be well-protected, though the duration of Khamenei's stay has not been specified. While in hiding, his third son, Masoud Khamenei, has assumed daily management of the Supreme Leader's office and serves as the 'primary communication channel' with government leaders. In January 2026, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, listed as a terrorist and extremist by Russia, proposed to President Donald Trump that Khamenei be eliminated during ongoing protests in Iran.

**Iranian leader hiding, son left in charge**
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, is reportedly in hiding in an underground bunker in Tehran due to fears of a U.S. strike, as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier approaches the Persian Gulf. According to Iran International, Khamenei has entrusted day-to-day governance of the Islamic Republic to his 53-year-old son, Masoud Khamenei, who now serves as the primary communication link with the regime's executive branch. The U.S. has reportedly completed preparations for a potential military operation, though no final decision has been made, as confirmed by Israeli media. U.S. Central Command Commander Brad Cooper met with Israeli officials, while former President Donald Trump stated he is closely monitoring Iran, emphasizing a large naval presence in the region. Trump previously threatened military action if Iran continued its crackdown on anti-government protests that began on December 28, 2025, which he claimed his rhetoric prevented 800 deaths. Khamenei has accused the U.S. of orchestrating sedition and claimed the U.S. must be held accountable, while President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that an attack on the Supreme Leader would amount to 'all-out war.' Iran denies executing demonstrators, with state media reporting 3,117 deaths—2,427 labeled 'martyrs'—while human rights groups estimate up to 25,000 fatalities. On January 25, 2026, Iran's telecoms chief announced internet service would be restored 'today or tomorrow,' following a brief resumption cut off after 30 minutes. The internet blackout, initiated on January 8, coincided with a violent government crackdown during nationwide protests. Yousef Pezeshkian, son of the president and a government adviser, urged restoration, warning that prolonged disconnection risks increasing public dissatisfaction and expanding the pool of discontent. The Supreme National Security Council approved the reconnection on January 24, 2026.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 86-year-old supreme leader, has reportedly retreated to a fortified underground bunker in Tehran amid escalating tensions with the United States, according to the Jerusalem Post and the New York Post. This move follows warnings from senior military officials about the increasing likelihood of a U.S. airstrike, prompted by President Donald Trump’s announcement that the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group—comprising three destroyers—was en route from the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf. Khamenei has reportedly left his 53-year-old son, Masoud Khamenei, to manage daily affairs of the Islamic Republic, serving as the primary communication link with the executive branch. Iran has declared that any attack on Khamenei would trigger an 'all-out war' and a declaration of jihad, as reported by the Iranian Students News Agency. Khamenei has not posted on X since January 17, 2026, though he had previously gone silent during the 12-Day War with Israel in June 2025, when he reportedly prepared a list of potential successors. His last public message in 2026 targeted 'criminals' responsible for nationwide protests sparked by a severe economic crisis and the worst drought in decades, which have led to at least 3,000 civilian deaths—some sources claim up to 20,000—according to regime forces.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Allegedly Preparing Secret Escape to Russia Amid Protests**
According to The Times, citing intelligence sources, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, is reportedly preparing a secret 'Plan B' to flee Iran to Russia amid escalating nationwide protests. The plan involves a small group of approximately 20 close aides and family members, including his son and designated successor Mojtaba, should the military and security forces fail to support his orders to suppress protests. The report notes that Khamenei views Russia as his only viable escape route, citing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and perceived cultural affinity between Iran and Russia. The plan is partially modeled on the escape of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who fled Damascus to Moscow in December 2024 before the city fell to opposition forces. Khamenei and his inner circle are said to have already secured assets, property, and cash abroad to facilitate a safe and discreet exit. The report was published on January 5, 2026, by 24 Kanal.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei Says Protestors' Economic Demands Are Justified but Warns Against Chaos**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged that the economic demands driving protests in Iran are legitimate, but emphasized the need for stricter measures against groups seeking to destabilize the country. Speaking during a ceremony marking the birth anniversary of Imam Ali and the first anniversary of the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, Khamenei attributed recent currency fluctuations and rising exchange rates to foreign interference, stating that 'the unexplained rise and instability in the exchange rate is not natural—it is the enemy's work.' He affirmed that the enemy would seize any opportunity to undermine Iran, and that Iranian authorities were prepared to respond. Khamenei distinguished between legitimate protest and chaos, asserting that while protests are acceptable, those inciting disorder must be confronted. He declared Iran's resolve to stand firm against enemies, stating, 'We will not retreat before the enemy. With faith in God and the people's support, we will bring the enemy to their knees.' Protests began on December 28, 2025, in Tehran's Grand Bazaar due to severe losses in the value of the Iranian rial and economic hardship, spreading to multiple cities. The demonstrations led to fatalities: a 21-year-old member of the Basij militia died in Kuhdasht, Lorestan Province, on December 31, 2025, with 13 police officers injured. In Lordegan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, two people were killed on January 1, 2026. In Azna, Lorestan, a police station attack during protests resulted in three deaths on the same day. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian admitted public dissatisfaction, acknowledged government responsibility for economic issues, and urged officials not to blame external actors like the U.S.

**Iran's supreme leader says will not cooperate with US while it backs Israel**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, that Iran would only consider cooperation with the United States if it completely abandoned support for Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and ceased interference. Khamenei emphasized that the U.S. 'arrogant nature' demands submission, and that only when the U.S. recognizes the cost of confrontation with a strong Iran will Tehran achieve 'immunity.' This stance follows a 12-day conflict in June 2025 between Iran and Israel, triggered by Israel's unprecedented bombing campaign and Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, which disrupted nuclear talks that had begun in April. A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Iran remains under severe international sanctions, including renewed UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025, initiated by Britain, France, and Germany. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated on November 2, 2025, that Tehran is ready to negotiate only on its nuclear program, not missile capabilities, and only if talks occur on equal footing and based on mutual interests—though he noted the U.S. is not in a hurry, and Iran is not either.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Excludes Any Cooperation with Washington, Citing Support for Israel**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ruled out any cooperation with Washington, stating that such cooperation could only be considered if the United States completely ceased its support for Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and refrained from intervening in the region. He emphasized the 'arrogant nature' of the United States, suggesting it refuses to accept any conditions or compromises. The statement was made on November 3, 2025, and published by Le Figaro.fr.

**Khamenei: Iran Will Consider U.S. Overtures Only If Israel Support Ends**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on Monday, during a speech to Iranian students commemorating the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran, that Iran will only consider U.S. requests for cooperation if Washington fully ceases supporting Israel, closes its military bases in the Middle East, and stops interfering in the internal affairs of regional countries. Khamenei described the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. as a 'fundamental conflict of interests.' He emphasized that any U.S. overtures for interaction would be reviewed 'at some point in the future, but only when' these conditions are met. This statement was published in the Supreme Leader's Telegram channel. Earlier, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Tehran would consider resuming nuclear talks when the U.S. is ready for a 'honest dialogue.'

**Iran's Supreme Leader Sets Condition for Cooperation with the U.S.: End Support for Israel**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that Iran will only resume cooperation with the United States if Washington ceases supporting Israel. 'Americans sometimes say they want to cooperate with Iran. Cooperation with Iran is impossible as long as the U.S. continues to support the accursed Zionist regime, maintains military bases, and interferes in regional affairs,' Khamenei said, according to Reuters. He added that there is no expectation of restored relations between Tehran and Washington in the near future, and any potential normalization would only occur later. In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated his readiness to strike a deal with Iran if Tehran is willing to take the initiative, emphasizing that 'the hand of friendship and cooperation is open.'

**Iran Khamenei says will not cooperate with US while it backs Israel**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, that Iran would only consider cooperation with the United States if it ceased supporting Israel, withdrew its military bases from the region, and stopped interfering in regional affairs. He emphasized that the 'arrogant nature of the United States accepts nothing other than submission.' These remarks were made during a student gathering in Tehran commemorating the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy, a pivotal event in the Islamic Revolution. The statement follows a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel that began in mid-June 2025, during which Israel launched a major bombing campaign, prompting Iran to respond with missile and drone strikes. The U.S. briefly joined the conflict with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, disrupting nuclear negotiations that had commenced in April 2025. A ceasefire has been in place since June 24, 2025. Khamenei asserted that 'if the country becomes strong and the enemy realises that confronting this strong nation will not yield profit but will bring loss, the country will certainly gain immunity.' Iran continues to face severe international sanctions, including the reimposition of UN sanctions under the 'snapback' mechanism in September 2025 by Britain, France, and Germany, after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in an interview with Al Jazeera on November 2, 2025, affirmed that Tehran remains 'ready to enter negotiations' with Washington—but only on its nuclear program, excluding missile capabilities. He added that talks could resume 'whenever the Americans are ready to negotiate on an equal footing and based on mutual interests. Apparently, they are not in a hurry. We are not in a hurry either.'

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated on November 3, 2025, during a speech to Iranian students commemorating the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, that Iran will only consider U.S. requests for cooperation if Washington fully ceases supporting Israel, closes its military bases in the Middle East, and stops interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Khamenei described the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. as an 'essential conflict of interests,' and emphasized that any potential interaction would be considered 'sometime in the future,' but not in the near term.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Rejects Trump's Proposal for Nuclear Talks, Calls It 'Imposition and Intimidation'**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump to resume nuclear talks on October 20, 2025, calling such an agreement 'imposition and intimidation' if it involves coercion or predetermined outcomes. Khamenei also dismissed Trump's claim that the U.S. had destroyed Iran's nuclear capabilities, stating, 'Keep dreaming!' He emphasized that U.S. interference in Iran's nuclear program is 'unacceptable, wrong, and coercive.' The rejection comes after five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, which ended in a 12-day conflict in June 2025, during which Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite repeated requests, Iran has denied access to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect a newly accelerated, secret nuclear facility under Mount Kirka near Natanz. Iran has officially declared it will no longer abide by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stating the agreement's term has expired and is no longer valid. The Ukrainian outlet OBOZREVATEL reported that Iran has ceased compliance with its nuclear restrictions.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Rejects Imminent Nuclear Talks with the U.S.**
On 23 September 2025, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned against nuclear negotiations with the United States, stating that such talks would not serve Iran's national interests and would lead to 'grave' and 'irreparable' losses. He described the U.S. position as a pre‑determined outcome, demanding the cessation of Iran's nuclear activities and uranium enrichment, and framed the process as 'dictation and imposition' rather than negotiation. Khamenei also cited U.S. demands for Iran to abandon short‑, medium‑ and long‑range missiles, claiming this would prevent Iran from responding to potential aggression. He listed hostile U.S. actions over recent years and called any nuclear talks a 'dead end.' The article references Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the U.S. withdrawal in May 2018, and the resumption of sanctions, as well as the 22 June 2024 U.S. airstrike on three Iranian nuclear sites following Israeli attacks in June 2024.

### Next Supreme Leader of Iran election
An election for the third supreme leader of Iran will be held following the end of the current tenure of Ali Khamenei. As of July 2025, no person has been officially declared as the heir to Khamenei nor as a nominee, though various sources such as Reuters and BBC News have reported on potential candidates. In 2014, it was reported that the succession of Khamenei is deemed to have been decided but not disclosed publicly. Constitutionally, the Assembly of Experts is tasked to select the next leader. Its sixth and current session began after it was elected in 2024 and is scheduled to sit until 2032. Khamenei has not discussed his replacement. He has said the selection must be made without shame or regard for expediency, rather based on the three principles of "truth, the need of the country and God". As of 2024, a four-member council of the Assembly of Experts was examining possible candidates in secrecy while advising the current leader. One of the members said that a successor had already been chosen but declined to disclose their identity for their safety. Current potential candidates to succeed Khamenei include his son Mojtaba Khamenei, his close aides Sadiq Larijani and Mohsen Araki, as well as Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder Ruhollah Khomeini. President Ebrahim Raisi was often mentioned in the frontrunners for the position prior to his death in a helicopter crash in May 2024.

. During his presidency, Hassan Rouhani was often considered by some as a potential successor. Ahmad Khatami told press in 2016 that a committee made up of three Assembly members had given three names to the supreme leader "to seek his verdict", but later remarked what he said was "hypothetical" and blamed media for misreporting his words. Mohsen Araki, commented in June 2019 that the committee has drafted a "top secret list of prospective supreme leaders" and will present three names to the Assembly "when it is necessary." Hashem Hashemzadeh Herisi confirmed that such a committee exists, adding that the names on the list will not be disclosed. He also stated that the decisions made by the committee will not be fateful because the next leader must be voted by a majority of all members in the assembly. Prior to that, in February 2019 Mohsen Mojtahed Shabestari had categorically dismissed allegations that Ebrahim Raisi and Ahmad Khatami were considered as candidates for the next leader by the assembly, stating that the question "has never been debated at the assembly". As of 2023, the Assembly of Experts was discussing a potential program to reestablish the post of Vice Supreme Leader, which was last held by Hussein-Ali Montazeri from 1985 to 1989. In November 2024, government leaker Abbas Palizdar said that Mojtaba Khamenei had quit the seminary to succeed his father. It was later reported by Al Arabiya that according to the Assembly of Experts, three people had been nominated to replace Khamenei. On 16 November it was reported by Israeli newspaper Ynet that Khamenei picked his son Mojtaba, which was later denied by the pro-government Tehran Times newspaper in January 2025. Shortly before the Iran–Israel war, Khamenei requested the Assembly of Experts to prepare for the selection of his successor. Following the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites during the war, the New York Times reported that Khamenei picked "three senior clerics" for his successorship if he is assassinated. In 2023, Israeli military intelligence had assessed President Ebrahim Raisi would succeed Khamenei. John Bolton argued the regime would be vulnerable in the event of Khamenei's death

. In the aftermath of Raisi's death, Mojtaba Khamenei's status as a potential successor to his father became more plausible, although Ali Khamenei had reportedly opposed this. The Middle East Institute opined that Khamenei appointing his own son as successor would cause conflict within the Iranian political and religious leadership. Following the 2024 election, 92-year-old Ayatollah Mohammad-Ali Movahedi Kermani became the new chairman of the Assembly of Experts. Ruhollah Khomeini's grandson Hassan Khomeini is also considered a possible successor, however, Iran International asserted he is unlikely due to his "exclusion from the regime's upper echelon" and that was "sidelined after being barred from running for the Assembly of Experts" in 2016.

. we have problem with the usurpers of Palestine land," he added. Also, he said that he had raised the issue "to spell an end to any debates". In 2013, Khamenei accused France of "kneeling" before Israel, while saying that Israel was led by people unworthy of the "title human". Nevertheless, according to anti-regime change activist Abbas Edalat, in 2005, Khamenei responded to a remark by then-President Ahmadinejad which had been widely translated as saying that the "regime occupying Jerusalem should be wiped off the map" by saying that "the Islamic Republic has never threatened and will never threaten any country". In a September 2009 sermon, Khamenei was quoted as saying that "the Zionist cancer is gnawing into the lives of Islamic nations." In another report of the same speech, he stated that "we will support and help any nations, any groups fighting against the Zionist regime across the world, and we are not afraid of declaring this." Khamenei instead proposed that "Palestinian refugees should return and Muslims, Christians and Jews could choose a government for themselves, excluding immigrant Jews", adding, "No one will allow a bunch of thugs, lechers and outcasts from London, America and Moscow to rule over the Palestinians". On 10 September 2015, in a speech about Israel after agreement on the nuclear program of Iran, Khamenei made a remark "Israel will not exist in 25 years". For the first time, the remark was published in Khamenei's official website and his Twitter. This statement was reported as voted as the best and most important among Khamenei's statements in 2015 by an online poll conducted by his official website. On 21 February 2017, at the 6th International Conference in Support of the Palestinian Intifada, Khamenei regarded the withdrawal of Israel from south Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza in 2005 as two major achievements so far. Also, he advised the Islamic countries to refrain from "useless" crises and differences and instead concentrate on the issue of Palestine, which he regarded as the core issue of Islam

Ali Khamenei

. He added: "Otherwise, the potentials and capabilities of the nations will go to waste in the face of vain struggles, which would provide opportunities for the Zionist regime to become even stronger." In September 2020, Khamenei condemned the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and charged UAE with betraying the Islamic world, the Arab countries and Palestine. He stated that the normalisation will be only temporary, but the UAE will forever have to bear the shame regarding the deal. In October 2023, Khamenei praised the October 7 attacks, but denied Iran's involvement. He condemned Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip in retaliation for the Hamas attack and accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. Israel launched surprise attacks on key military and nuclear facilities in Iran on 13 June 2025, which started the Iran–Israel war. Israeli air and ground forces assassinated some of Iran's prominent military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians. and damaged or destroyed Iran's air defenses and some of its nuclear and military facilities. Iran retaliated with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites. The United States, which defended Israel against Iranian missiles and drones, took offensive action on the ninth day of the war by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire after insistence from the U.S. In the wake of this war, Khamenei was reportedly moved to a fortified underground bunker in Tehran with his family, where he remained largely isolated from external communication. Khamenei rejected U.S. president Trump's call for Iranian surrender. Khamenei was also subjected to threats of assassination by Trump, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and defense minister Israel Katz. Katz stated in 2025 that his country wanted to kill Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, during the Iran–Israel war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in June 2025, said that he had not ruled out assassinating Khamenei in the future. US President Donald Trump reportedly vetoed an Israeli plan in June 2025 to kill Ali Khamenei. Following the Iran–Israel war ceasefire, he resurfaced on 26 June via a recorded clip, to warn the United States against future attacks

. Khamenei's isolation during the war, with access limited to his closest aides, complicated diplomatic efforts in Geneva by making him difficult to reach. Afterwards, Khamenei declared victory over Israel and threatened further attacks on American military bases, escalating tensions with the United States. In response, president Trump dismissed Khamenei's claims, telling him he had been decisively defeated. An Iran International article interviewed civilians, expressing disappointment in Khamenei during and after the war. One referred to him as a "coward" hiding in his bunker, another said Khamenei is living in an "illusion", believing Iran won the war and declaring victory. On 5 July 2025, Khamenei made his first public appearance since the war with Israel had begun. A 2006 speech of Khamenei contains the phrase that was translated into English as "the myth of the massacre of Jews". In a 2013 interview, Iran's then-Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Khamenei had been mistranslated and his comments were taken out of context. Zarif added: "I have spoken to the [supreme] leader on this issue, he rejects and condemns the killing of innocent people. No, the Holocaust is not a myth." On 21 March 2014, Khamenei said that "the Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it's uncertain how it has happened". Additionally, because of the potential legal consequences in some countries, he commented: "No one in European countries dares to speak about [the] Holocaust." He also said that in the West "speaking about [the] Holocaust and expressing doubts about it is considered to be a great sin." On Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2016, Khamenei posted a Holocaust-denying video on his official website. The video, drawing on the March 2014 speech and lasting about three minutes, features images of Holocaust deniers Roger Garaudy, Robert Faurisson, and David Irving. In December 2019, Khamenei praised Garaudy (a convert to Islam) and said that Garaudy's conviction for Holocaust denial violated freedom of speech. In 2020, Khamenei tweeted asking "Why is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust ..
