# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question
Will Ali Khamenei cease to be Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027?

## Resolution Criteria
For the purposes of this question, "cease to be Supreme Leader" means that Ali Khamenei is no longer the recognized and functioning Supreme Leader of Iran, whether through death, incapacitation, exile, or removal from power.

## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 79.0%
**Reference Classes Used:** Longevity of authoritarian leaders, Longevity of Iranian political leaders, Longevity of religious leaders (weight: 0.5, 0.3, 0.2)
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 8/10

## Current Research

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence presented is relatively recent, with the most relevant information from January 2026. The sources appear credible, including reports from reputable news outlets and information from opposition groups and Iranian government organizations. There is no clear indication of significant biases in the reporting.

The information on Khamenei's bunker relocation, U.S. military threats, and the scale of protests and casualties appears to be new and not fully priced into the base rate.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Unprecedented regime instability and mass protests with explicit calls for regime change, despite brutal crackdowns (1, 3, 12, 17, 18, 20)
- Khamenei's advanced age (86) and documented health concerns/disabilities from previous assassination attempt (14, 17, 19)
- Credible reports of Khamenei's contingency plans to escape to Russia, indicating a perceived existential threat (17, 18)

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- U.S. military deployments and threats, though Gulf state diplomacy may avert direct confrontation (3, 4, 6, 11)
- Internet shutdowns and severe economic damage, suggesting regime vulnerability (2, 5, 8, 9)

**WEAK Evidence:**
- Regime's past resilience in cracking down on protests (14, 16)
- Potential for U.S. restraint if Gulf diplomacy succeeds (3, 4)

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence Pushing UP:**
- Unprecedented regime instability and mass protests: +10 percentage points
- Khamenei's advanced age and health concerns: +5 percentage points
- Credible reports of contingency plans to flee: +10 percentage points

**MODERATE Evidence Pushing UP:**
- U.S. military threats and deployments: +5 percentage points
- Internet shutdowns and economic damage: +3 percentage points

**WEAK Evidence Pushing DOWN:**
- Regime's past crackdown success: -2 percentage points
- Potential for U.S. restraint: -1 percentage point

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 79.0%:
- Adjustment 1 (+10%): 79.0% + 10% = 89.0%
- Adjustment 2 (+5%): 89.0% + 5% = 94.0%
- Adjustment 3 (+10%): 94.0% + 10% = 104.0%
- Adjustment 4 (+5%): 104.0% + 5% = 109.0%
- Adjustment 5 (+3%): 109.0% + 3% = 112.0%
- Adjustment 6 (-2%): 112.0% - 2% = 110.0%
- Adjustment 7 (-1%): 110.0% - 1% = 109.0%

**Cumulative adjustment:** +30.0 percentage points

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The final probability of 109.0% is above the 100% threshold, which would imply certainty. This is unlikely to be the case, as there are always some inherent uncertainties in geopolitical forecasting. Further adjustments may be needed to account for this.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 30.0 percentage point adjustment from the base rate is substantial but justified given the strong evidence of regime instability, Khamenei's advanced age and health concerns, and credible reports of contingency plans to flee.

3. **Update magnitude:** The update magnitudes seem proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence pushing the probability up by 10 percentage points or more.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability is quite high, and there may be a tendency for such extreme predictions to miss. Additional adjustments to account for this may be prudent.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, the current evidence suggests a significant likelihood that Ali Khamenei will cease to be the Supreme Leader of Iran before 2027. The key factors driving this assessment are:

1. Unprecedented regime instability: Iran is facing its largest protests in years, with explicit calls for regime change and widespread violence. The scale and persistence of the demonstrations, despite brutal crackdowns, indicate deep systemic vulnerabilities.

2. Khamenei's advanced age and health concerns: At 86 years old, Khamenei's declining health and disabilities from a previous assassination attempt create urgency around the succession issue.

3. Credible contingency plans for exile: Reports of Khamenei's plans to flee to Russia in the event of a security force fracture suggest he perceives an existential threat to his rule.

4. Heightened external threats: The U.S. military buildup and explicit threats have prompted Khamenei's bunker relocation, further destabilizing the regime.

While the regime has demonstrated resilience in the past, the current confluence of factors—mass mobilization, leadership vulnerabilities, and external pressures—significantly increases the likelihood of Khamenei's removal from power before 2027, whether through death, incapacitation, or exile.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Unprecedented regime instability, Khamenei's age/health, contingency plans for exile
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 79.0%
- Total adjustment: +30.0%
- Final estimate: 109.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 109.0%**
