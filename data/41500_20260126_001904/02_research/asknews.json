This functionality is currently available to users on the Pro and Plus subscription plans worldwide. According to OpenAI\u2019s official blog, the update allows ChatGPT to locate specific details across a user\u2019s chat history, eliminating the need to manually search through old conversations. 'Any prior chat used to answer your question now appears as a source so you can open and review the original context,' OpenAI emphasized. Additionally, the company announced plans to introduce ads in the free and Go subscription tiers, starting in the United States. Ads will be displayed at the end of responses, clearly labeled and separated from content. OpenAI confirmed that responses will never be based on advertising and that user data and conversation history will remain protected and not sold to advertisers. The company stated that ads are 'useful, entertaining, and help people discover new products and services.' Ads will not appear for users under 18, and no advertising will be shown for sensitive or regulated topics such as health, mental health, or politics. Users will also have access to information explaining why they are seeing a particular ad.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 05:00 PM\nSource: [20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial/chatgpt-estrena-una-funcion-memoria-para-que-no-pierdas-informacion-tus-chats-antiguos_6923034_0.html)\n\n**ChatGPT Health**\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Health on January 7, 2026, amid growing demand, with TechCrunch reporting that 230 million people are asking health-related questions to ChatGPT weekly.

Despite OpenAI acknowledging that ChatGPT Health is not HIPAA-compliant and is not intended for diagnosis, the product was released due to existing user demand.

The update will allow users to browse product details, select delivery addresses and payment methods, and complete purchases directly within the chatbot interface. Users will be able to add items to a saved cart for later purchase and sort products by criteria. Microsoft has already implemented similar e-commerce integration in its Copilot feature, prompting OpenAI to likely follow suit soon. Additionally, merchants can submit product descriptions to be used in AI-generated recommendations. Personalized responses based on prior chat history will be available during sessions, though conversations will not be permanently stored. The exact rollout timeline is unspecified, but OpenAI is expected to act quickly due to strong market competition.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 04:23 AM\nSource: [3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1135795/korzina-dlya-onlaynpokupok-budet-dobavlena-v-interfeys-chatgpt)\n\n**OpenAI Reportedly Developing 'Shopping Cart' Feature for ChatGPT, New Tool To Enable Native Checkout and Merchant Product Feeds**\nOpenAI is reportedly developing a 'Shopping Cart' feature for ChatGPT, which will allow users to save items for later purchase and complete transactions directly within conversations.

The tool automatically detects the source language and offers advanced text refinement options, including 'natural-sounding output,' 'formal business tone,' 'explanation for children,' and 'academic or expert-level phrasing.' Additionally, Microsoft has introduced a new IME (Input Method Editor) called 'Copilot Keyboard,' announced on January 20, 2026, with plans for monthly updates. Initially launched in beta in October 2025, Copilot Keyboard integrates with Copilot and includes features such as up-to-date vocabulary (including trending terms, names, places, and new brands), 'Copilot Search' for on-the-fly word lookup, customizable themes, and a desktop display of the Copilot character. The tool now includes previously unavailable features like a built-in dictionary and keyboard customization. Microsoft confirms that input entered via Copilot Keyboard is not read by, stored in, or used for AI training purposes.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource: [ITmedia](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2601/25/news011.html)\n\n**ChatGPT Atlas Browser Receives Revolutionary New Features in Major Update!**\nOpenAI has released a new update for its browser, ChatGPT Atlas, focused on enhancing productivity and browsing experience for users managing multiple tabs simultaneously.

The move is driven by the need to offset high infrastructure and energy costs, as OpenAI's CFO revealed that the company's revenue growth over the past year was fueled by a 9.5-fold increase in compute costs, despite its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) surpassing $20 billion. While OpenAI claims ads will not compromise answer objectivity, will not use user data for ad targeting, and will allow users to disable personalized ads, concerns remain about the long-term implications. CEO Sam Altman, who previously opposed advertising in AI, now describes it as 'a valuable exploration for users.' Critics, including DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, argue that AI assistants are fundamentally different from search engines: they are personal, trusted companions, and intrusive ads could erode user trust and undermine the perceived authenticity of interactions. The 'Memory' feature, which allows ChatGPT to recall user details for personalized responses, raises privacy concerns, as it could enable hyper-targeted advertising. Despite OpenAI's current restraint, the history of digital advertising\u2014from banners to invasive in-app ads\u2014suggests that user tolerance may erode over time. With only 5% of weekly active users paying for ChatGPT, the remaining 95% of free users are seen as cost centers. Ads offer a way to monetize this large base, transforming them from liabilities into revenue sources. However, this shift risks alienating users who view AI not as a tool but as a confidant or even a friend, especially among vulnerable groups like minors who rely on AI for emotional support.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 11:28 AM\nSource: [k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5828676220_15b6a8a7c02001arnk.html)\n\n**Shopping Cart to Be Added to ChatGPT Interface**\nOpenAI plans to integrate an online shopping cart into the ChatGPT interface to advance its monetization strategy, as the company is projected to reach profitability only by 2029 given current costs.

The 'Go' plan, the only paid tier that will continue to show ads, allows users to access the GPT-5.2 model with greater freedom. However, users who wish to remove all advertisements must upgrade to more expensive plans such as Plus, Pro, or enterprise versions. OpenAI's move aligns with established advertising models, similar to those used by Google, though Apple is unlikely to allow ads in Siri interactions to preserve user experience. The company aims to offset the high costs of maintaining AI infrastructure through advertising, but the success of this model depends on whether users will tolerate ads or migrate to alternative platforms that have not yet adopted ad-based monetization.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource: [mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/tecnologia/chatgpt-empezara-mostrar-anuncios-y-estrena-un-nuevo-plan-economico-llamado-go-n1431985)\n\n**ChatGPT Atlas Browser Receives Revolutionary New Features in Major Update!**\nOpenAI has released a new update for its browser, ChatGPT Atlas, focused on enhancing productivity and browsing experience for users managing multiple tabs simultaneously.

Ads will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses when a relevant sponsored product or service aligns with the conversation, and will be 'clearly labeled and separated from organic answers.' They will not appear for users under 18 or near 'sensitive or regulated' topics such as health, mental health, or politics. Users on the Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans will remain ad-free. OpenAI emphasized that ads will not influence ChatGPT\u2019s responses, conversations will remain private from advertisers, and ad placements will always be distinct from core content. The company envisions future conversational ad experiences\u2014such as asking follow-up questions about a recommended product while seeking a recipe\u2014making ads more interactive and relevant. This move follows OpenAI\u2019s expansion of its marketing infrastructure, including hiring Fidji Simo as CEO of applications and building a ChatGPT Growth team with engineers focused on ad platform integration, campaign management, and real-time attribution. The decision comes amid pressure from competitors like Google and Anthropic, and a reported 'code red' internal memo from CEO Sam Altman in December 2025. With over 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is now testing ads as a key monetization strategy after relying primarily on subscriptions and enterprise deals. Advertisers will likely assess engagement in conversational contexts, but OpenAI faces the challenge of maintaining user trust while introducing ads into an experience historically valued as ad-free.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 04:42 PM\nSource: [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-chatgpt-ads-sponsored-products/)\n\n**OpenAI: The First AI Device to Launch in 2026 \u2013 You Won\u2019t Believe What It Is**\nOpenAI, led by Sam Altman, is advancing rapidly on its initiative to produce physical AI products, with its first device expected to launch in 2026.

A premium feature called Agent Mode, available to Plus and Business subscribers, supports multi-step actions like online shopping, research, and workflow automation, with contextual help for highlighted text in emails, documents, or invites. Atlas includes memory functionality to retain browsing context for resumed tasks such as job searches or content summarization, along with privacy controls allowing users to disable memory, use incognito mode, or restrict visibility on specific sites. It supports importing data from Google Chrome, including bookmarks, passwords, and browsing history, and can be set as the default browser. New users receive higher rate limits for the first week. OpenAI stated that ChatGPT serves over 800 million weekly active users and that Atlas is part of its strategy to integrate AI into core digital workflows.

ChatGPT Atlas is OpenAI's native browser integrating ChatGPT functionality, enabling users to summon ChatGPT from various points such as new tab pages, dedicated panes, and text field cursors. The browser leverages browsing history and real-time activity to allow ChatGPT to remember user behavior, offering personalized suggestions and context-aware responses\u2014such as creating to-do lists based on recent activity or researching holiday gift ideas based on previously viewed products. Users retain full control over stored data: they can review, delete browsing history, or clear all memory via settings. Additional features include a secret mode that temporarily logs users out of their ChatGPT account, and the ability to toggle ChatGPT\u2019s access on a per-website basis. An AI agent feature enables ChatGPT to autonomously perform tasks\u2014like searching for ingredients, purchasing them, and arranging home delivery\u2014when given a recipe. However, security restrictions prevent code execution, file downloads, or access to the PC\u2019s file system or other applications.

Built on Chromium, it features a familiar interface with a 'Ask ChatGPT' bar that enables users to summarize pages, interact with content, and perform contextual searches without leaving the current tab. The browser integrates the ChatGPT Agent, an automation tool allowing AI to perform tasks such as filling forms, booking restaurants, or completing online spreadsheets\u2014currently available only to Plus, Pro, and Business subscribers. Atlas also leverages ChatGPT\u2019s evolving memory to personalize responses based on user preferences and history. OpenAI describes it as a tool for 'vibe living,' akin to 'vibe coding' with GPT-5, where AI handles daily tasks\u2014such as automatically ordering ingredients after a recipe discussion. Sam Altman stated, 'Just as GPT-5 helps code, Atlas helps live better.' Privacy features include opt-in memory, history deletion, and private browsing, with no default use of navigation data to train AI models. This launch marks a strategic expansion for OpenAI beyond its search engine, ChatGPT Search (which had 40 million European users by April 2025), now targeting Google\u2019s core dominance in web navigation by unifying search, automation, and conversation in one interface.

This move marks a growing rivalry in AI browsers, with Google planning to integrate its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome and Perplexity already offering an AI-powered browser focused on optimized search and Amazon shopping.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 08:11 PM\nSource: [euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/next/2025/10/21/openai-lanca-o-chatgpt-atlas-browser-alimentado-por-ia-eis-tudo-o-que-sabemos)\n\n**OpenAI launches new web browser ChatGPT Atlas**\nOpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser designed to function as a 'super-assistant' by understanding users' online activities and helping complete tasks without switching tabs or copying and pasting. The browser features a split-screen layout with the user's webpage on one side and ChatGPT on the other, enabling real-time summarization and explanation of content. It includes built-in ChatGPT memory, 'agent mode' for limited automated actions such as researching topics, booking appointments, or summarizing websites, and the ability to recall context, revisit past pages, and act based on browsing history. Users can manage and delete saved history at any time, and by default, OpenAI does not use browsing content for training unless users opt in. Atlas cannot run code, download files, install extensions, or access other apps, and it pauses on private sites like banking platforms. The browser is currently available on macOS worldwide, with versions for Windows, iOS, and Android forthcoming. OpenAI's move positions it to directly compete with Google\u2019s Gemini-integrated Chrome and startups like Perplexity, which launched its own AI browser earlier in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 07:48 PM\nSource: [WTSP 10](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/openai-chatgpt-atlas-internet-browser/507-d6f53a13-0103-4ffb-9074-949218d6d649)\n\n**ChatGPT Atlas browser by OpenAI: Release date, platforms and how you can download it easily**\nChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser developed by OpenAI, was released globally on macOS on October 21, 2025, for Free, Plus, Pro, and Go users, with Business, Enterprise, and Edu users gaining access if enabled by their administrators. The browser features a ChatGPT sidebar for summarizing content, comparing products, analyzing data, and answering questions; Agent Mode for completing tasks end-to-end such as event planning or online shopping; and Browser Memory, which allows users to recall browsing context and past chats\u2014such as 'Summarize the job postings I viewed last week'\u2014with privacy controls, including the ability to browse logged out, clear history, and manage memories. Agent Mode does not run code, download files, or access other apps, and sensitive actions like logging into financial accounts require explicit user approval. OpenAI advises caution when using Agent Mode to prevent unintended or malicious behavior. Future updates are expected to include multi-profile support, enhanced developer tools, and improved app integration. Versions for Windows, iOS, and Android are forthcoming. Users can download ChatGPT Atlas from chatgpt.com/atlas and import bookmarks, passwords, and browsing history from their current browser, according to Reuters. The launch positions ChatGPT Atlas as a competitor to browsers like Google Chrome, Perplexity\u2019s Comet, and Opera\u2019s Neon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 07:26 PM\nSource: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/openai-launches-chatgpt-atlas-browser-release-details-and-easy-guide-to-download-today-101761072132682.html)\n\n**OpenAI Launches AI Browser ChatGPT Atlas**\nOpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a web browser that integrates ChatGPT directly into everyday browsing tasks, with a global release for macOS today available to Free, Plus, Pro, and Go users. Windows, iOS, and Android versions are planned for future release. Atlas embeds ChatGPT in the new-tab experience to handle queries, search, and inline writing without requiring tab switching. It leverages context from users\u2019 web history, currently open pages, and logged-in sites to personalize responses. The browser remembers details from prior sessions to resurface pages, automate repetitive tasks, and continue unfinished work. Users can issue natural-language commands\u2014such as 'reopen tabs from yesterday' or 'clean up open tabs'\u2014which Atlas executes natively. OpenAI is also previewing an agent mode that allows ChatGPT to perform actions on behalf of users within the browser; access is restricted to Plus, Pro, and Business tiers during the preview. Privacy is emphasized: browsing history can be cleared, incognito mode is available, and browser memory is opt-in and fully manageable by users. OpenAI stated that it does not use browsing content to train its models by default. The product is positioned as part of a broader initiative toward a context-aware assistant for research, shopping, planning, work, and learning. Additional information, including availability, use cases, safety details, and a product blog, is available in OpenAI\u2019s press materials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource: [ProPakistani](https://propakistani.pk/?p=939077)\n\n"
