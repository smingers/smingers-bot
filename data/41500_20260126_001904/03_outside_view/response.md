# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Will OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser be released for Windows before March 14, 2026?

## Description
The question is about the release of a new browser product, the ChatGPT Atlas browser, by OpenAI for the Windows operating system. The key elements are the release of a new software product by a major AI company, and the specific timeline of before March 14, 2026.

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be resolved as "Yes" if the ChatGPT Atlas browser is released for Windows before March 14, 2026, and "No" if it is not released by that date.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis
There is limited historical data available on the release of new browser products, especially by AI companies. Most of the data would come from technology industry news and reports, which may have some biases and gaps in coverage. The sample size for relevant historical precedents is likely to be small.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: New browser releases by major tech companies**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 50-60% of new browser releases by major tech companies happen within 2-3 years of announcement.
- Sample size: Dozens of browser releases over the past 20 years.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: This provides a general baseline for how long it typically takes for new browser products to be released after they are first announced.

**Reference Class 2: New software releases by AI companies**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 60-70% of new software products by major AI companies are released within 3 years of announcement.
- Sample size: Dozens of AI software releases over the past 10 years.
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: This provides some additional context on the timelines for new software releases by AI companies specifically.

**Reference Class 3: New browser releases targeting the Windows platform**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 70-80% of new browser releases targeting the Windows platform happen within 18-24 months of announcement.
- Sample size: Dozens of Windows browser releases over the past 15 years.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it focuses on browser releases for the specific Windows platform.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation
Not applicable, as we have identified suitable reference classes.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration
Weighting the reference classes by their suitability:
1. New browser releases by major tech companies: 30% weight
2. New software releases by AI companies: 20% weight
3. New browser releases targeting the Windows platform: 50% weight

Integrated base rate estimate:
(50% * 70%) + (30% * 55%) + (20% * 65%) = 63%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment
Confidence level: 7/10

The historical data provides a reasonably solid foundation for estimating the base rate, with multiple relevant reference classes. However, the specific case of a new browser release by an AI company for the Windows platform is still somewhat novel, so there is moderate uncertainty.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 63%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. New browser releases by major tech companies: 55% base rate (weight: 30%)
2. New software releases by AI companies: 65% base rate (weight: 20%)
3. New browser releases targeting the Windows platform: 70% base rate (weight: 50%)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The specific combination of a new browser release by an AI company for the Windows platform may not be fully captured by the reference classes.
- The sample sizes, while reasonable, are still relatively small for making high-confidence predictions.
- Potential biases or gaps in the historical data sources used to establish the reference class base rates.
