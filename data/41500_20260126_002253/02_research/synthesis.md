## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on the latest available information, it remains **uncertain** whether OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser will be released for Windows before March 14, 2026. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:

1. **Initial Release and Platform Availability**:  
   ChatGPT Atlas was first launched exclusively for **macOS on October 21, 2025** [12][13][14][17][18]. At the time, OpenAI confirmed that **Windows, iOS, and Android versions were "in development"** but provided **no specific release dates** [12][13][14][17][18][19].

2. **Recent Updates (January 2026)**:  
   - As of **January 24, 2026**, the browser was still described as **"exclusively for macOS devices"** in an update announcing new features (tab grouping, performance improvements). There was no mention of Windows progress [6].  
   - No announcements about a Windows release appeared in any January 2026 news regarding OpenAI’s other product updates (e.g., ChatGPT Health [2], shopping cart features [3][4], or ad monetization [5][7]).

3. **Official Timelines and Promises**:  
   OpenAI’s initial October 2025 communications stated Windows support would arrive "in the near future" [14][15] or "shortly" [13], but these terms were vague and unquantified. Engineering lead Adam Fry indicated post-launch updates would focus on **macOS features first** (e.g., multiprofile support) [12]. CEO Sam Altman also noted the project was "still in its early stages" at launch [17], suggesting longer development cycles.

4. **Conflicting Signals and Challenges**:  
   - The absence of Windows-related news in January 2026—despite multiple product announcements—suggests **delays or reprioritization** (e.g., toward ads [7] or hardware [8]).  
   - OpenAI faces **competitive pressure** (Apple/Google partnerships [1]) and **regulatory scrutiny** (FTC investigations [9][10]), which may divert resources from cross-platform expansion.

5. **Likelihood Before March 14, 2026**:  
   Given that 5 months have passed since the macOS launch (Oct 2025–Jan 2026) with no Windows release or concrete timeline, a launch before **March 14, 2026 (6 weeks from now)** seems **unlikely but not impossible**. If development follows macOS’s trajectory (announced and released in October 2025), a surprise launch is conceivable—but no evidence supports this.

**Weaknesses in Information**:  
- OpenAI has not updated its Windows roadmap since October 2025.  
- No leaks, beta programs, or developer previews for Windows have surfaced.  
- Coverage remains focused on macOS, implying Windows is not imminent [6][12].

**Conclusion**:  
While OpenAI planned a Windows version, the lack of updates and silence in recent months makes a pre-March 14 release improbable. If this changes, it would likely require a sudden announcement—but based on current data, **expect delays beyond your deadline**. For real-time updates, monitor OpenAI’s official channels directly.

**ChatGPT Launches Memory Feature to Retrieve Information from Past Conversations**
OpenAI has introduced a new memory feature for ChatGPT that enables users to retrieve information from previous conversations with greater accuracy. This functionality is currently available to users on the Pro and Plus subscription plans worldwide. According to OpenAI’s official blog, the update allows ChatGPT to locate specific details across a user’s chat history, eliminating the need to manually search through old conversations. 'Any prior chat used to answer your question now appears as a source so you can open and review the original context,' OpenAI emphasized. Additionally, the company announced plans to introduce ads in the free and Go subscription tiers, starting in the United States. Ads will be displayed at the end of responses, clearly labeled and separated from content. OpenAI confirmed that responses will never be based on advertising and that user data and conversation history will remain protected and not sold to advertisers. The company stated that ads are 'useful, entertaining, and help people discover new products and services.' Ads will not appear for users under 18, and no advertising will be shown for sensitive or regulated topics such as health, mental health, or politics. Users will also have access to information explaining why they are seeing a particular ad.

**ChatGPT Health**
OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health on January 7, 2026, amid growing demand, with TechCrunch reporting that 230 million people are asking health-related questions to ChatGPT weekly. Seven out of ten health conversations occur outside regular clinic hours, indicating a clear gap in access to medical advice. Despite OpenAI acknowledging that ChatGPT Health is not HIPAA-compliant and is not intended for diagnosis, the product was released due to existing user demand. ECRI, a patient safety organization, has identified AI chatbot misuse as the top health technology hazard for 2026, citing cases where chatbots provided incorrect diagnoses and even invented non-existent body parts while sounding authoritative. This highlights a strategic shift: AI adoption in healthcare is no longer a question of 'if' but 'how,' as users are already relying on these tools, making it imperative for businesses to manage risk while capturing value. The article questions whether the pace of AI integration in healthcare is too fast or simply responsive to user needs.

**Shopping Cart to Be Added to ChatGPT Interface**
OpenAI plans to integrate an online shopping cart into the ChatGPT interface to advance its monetization strategy, as the company is projected to reach profitability only by 2029 given current costs. The update will allow users to browse product details, select delivery addresses and payment methods, and complete purchases directly within the chatbot interface. Users will be able to add items to a saved cart for later purchase and sort products by criteria. Microsoft has already implemented similar e-commerce integration in its Copilot feature, prompting OpenAI to likely follow suit soon. Additionally, merchants can submit product descriptions to be used in AI-generated recommendations. Personalized responses based on prior chat history will be available during sessions, though conversations will not be permanently stored. The exact rollout timeline is unspecified, but OpenAI is expected to act quickly due to strong market competition.

**OpenAI Reportedly Developing 'Shopping Cart' Feature for ChatGPT, New Tool To Enable Native Checkout and Merchant Product Feeds**
OpenAI is reportedly developing a 'Shopping Cart' feature for ChatGPT, which will allow users to save items for later purchase and complete transactions directly within conversations. The feature has been spotted in the web app’s sidebar as a dedicated 'Cart' section. It builds on existing Instant Checkout integrations with merchants like Etsy and Shopify, enabling seamless saving, personalized recommendations, and frictionless purchasing. Additionally, OpenAI is introducing merchant self-service tools to upload product feeds. A related update enhances personalization in temporary chats through memory and preferences, while preserving privacy options. These developments aim to position ChatGPT as a more comprehensive commerce platform. The announcement also includes the rollout of 'Tab Groups' for better conversation organization. The information was published on January 25, 2026, by LatestLY.

**OpenAI Launches Translation-Optimized 'ChatGPT Translate'; Microsoft Unveils Copilot Keyboard with Dictionary and Customization Features**
OpenAI has released a new translation-focused tool called 'ChatGPT Translate,' available for free to all users. Unlike the standard ChatGPT, which requires prompt-based translation, ChatGPT Translate operates like a traditional web translator: users input text on the left, and the translated output appears on the right. The tool automatically detects the source language and offers advanced text refinement options, including 'natural-sounding output,' 'formal business tone,' 'explanation for children,' and 'academic or expert-level phrasing.' Additionally, Microsoft has introduced a new IME (Input Method Editor) called 'Copilot Keyboard,' announced on January 20, 2026, with plans for monthly updates. Initially launched in beta in October 2025, Copilot Keyboard integrates with Copilot and includes features such as up-to-date vocabulary (including trending terms, names, places, and new brands), 'Copilot Search' for on-the-fly word lookup, customizable themes, and a desktop display of the Copilot character. The tool now includes previously unavailable features like a built-in dictionary and keyboard customization. Microsoft confirms that input entered via Copilot Keyboard is not read by, stored in, or used for AI training purposes.

**From Dreaming of the Stars to Walking on the Ground: ChatGPT to Introduce Ads Amid Monetization Pressure**
OpenAI has announced plans to introduce ads into the free version and the entry-level 'Go' subscription tier of ChatGPT, with testing set to begin in the coming weeks for users in the United States. The move is driven by the need to offset high infrastructure and energy costs, as OpenAI's CFO revealed that the company's revenue growth over the past year was fueled by a 9.5-fold increase in compute costs, despite its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) surpassing $20 billion. While OpenAI claims ads will not compromise answer objectivity, will not use user data for ad targeting, and will allow users to disable personalized ads, concerns remain about the long-term implications. CEO Sam Altman, who previously opposed advertising in AI, now describes it as 'a valuable exploration for users.' Critics, including DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, argue that AI assistants are fundamentally different from search engines: they are personal, trusted companions, and intrusive ads could erode user trust and undermine the perceived authenticity of interactions. The 'Memory' feature, which allows ChatGPT to recall user details for personalized responses, raises privacy concerns, as it could enable hyper-targeted advertising. Despite OpenAI's current restraint, the history of digital advertising—from banners to invasive in-app ads—suggests that user tolerance may erode over time. With only 5% of weekly active users paying for ChatGPT, the remaining 95% of free users are seen as cost centers. Ads offer a way to monetize this large base, transforming them from liabilities into revenue sources. However, this shift risks alienating users who view AI not as a tool but as a confidant or even a friend, especially among vulnerable groups like minors who rely on AI for emotional support.

**ChatGPT to Introduce Ads and Launch New 'Go' Plan with GPT-5.2 Access**
ChatGPT will begin displaying contextually targeted ads starting January 24, 2026, as part of a new monetization strategy. The 'Go' plan, the only paid tier that will continue to show ads, allows users to access the GPT-5.2 model with greater freedom. However, users who wish to remove all advertisements must upgrade to more expensive plans such as Plus, Pro, or enterprise versions. OpenAI's move aligns with established advertising models, similar to those used by Google, though Apple is unlikely to allow ads in Siri interactions to preserve user experience. The company aims to offset the high costs of maintaining AI infrastructure through advertising, but the success of this model depends on whether users will tolerate ads or migrate to alternative platforms that have not yet adopted ad-based monetization.

**OpenAI Says It Is Bringing Ads to ChatGPT**
OpenAI announced on January 23, 2026, that it will begin testing advertisements within the Free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the 'coming weeks,' marking a major shift toward traditional monetization for the world’s most popular AI chatbot. Ads will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses when a relevant sponsored product or service aligns with the conversation, and will be 'clearly labeled and separated from organic answers.' They will not appear for users under 18 or near 'sensitive or regulated' topics such as health, mental health, or politics. Users on the Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans will remain ad-free. OpenAI emphasized that ads will not influence ChatGPT’s responses, conversations will remain private from advertisers, and ad placements will always be distinct from core content. The company envisions future conversational ad experiences—such as asking follow-up questions about a recommended product while seeking a recipe—making ads more interactive and relevant. This move follows OpenAI’s expansion of its marketing infrastructure, including hiring Fidji Simo as CEO of applications and building a ChatGPT Growth team with engineers focused on ad platform integration, campaign management, and real-time attribution. The decision comes amid pressure from competitors like Google and Anthropic, and a reported 'code red' internal memo from CEO Sam Altman in December 2025. With over 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is now testing ads as a key monetization strategy after relying primarily on subscriptions and enterprise deals. Advertisers will likely assess engagement in conversational contexts, but OpenAI faces the challenge of maintaining user trust while introducing ads into an experience historically valued as ad-free.

**OpenAI just launched a browser and Google should be worried - Gizmochina**
OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser available on macOS, with Windows, iOS, and Android versions expected soon. The browser integrates ChatGPT directly into the browsing experience, replacing the traditional address bar with a chat interface that enables real-time AI assistance across any webpage. It features a built-in sidebar for summarizing articles, answering queries, and completing tasks using live page content. A premium feature called Agent Mode, available to Plus and Business subscribers, supports multi-step actions like online shopping, research, and workflow automation, with contextual help for highlighted text in emails, documents, or invites. Atlas includes memory functionality to retain browsing context for resumed tasks such as job searches or content summarization, along with privacy controls allowing users to disable memory, use incognito mode, or restrict visibility on specific sites. It supports importing data from Google Chrome, including bookmarks, passwords, and browsing history, and can be set as the default browser. New users receive higher rate limits for the first week. OpenAI stated that ChatGPT serves over 800 million weekly active users and that Atlas is part of its strategy to integrate AI into core digital workflows. The launch follows competition from Google’s Gemini-powered Chrome and other AI-first browsers like Perplexity’s Comet.

**OpenAI Releases ChatGPT Atlas: A Chromium-Based AI Browser**
OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a Chromium-based AI-powered browser designed to integrate intelligent assistance directly into web browsing. Initially released for macOS, Atlas enables users to interact with web content through a persistent 'Ask ChatGPT' panel that provides real-time summaries, explanations, code reviews, and text edits without leaving the current page. The browser retains standard features like tabs, bookmarks, history, and password storage, all presented in a clean interface. Paid users gain access to automation tools such as Operator, which can perform small online tasks like booking tables or filling forms, and Cursor Chat, which allows inline text editing. OpenAI aims to merge browsing and conversational AI, creating a seamless experience for users who rely on ChatGPT for daily tasks. The launch positions Atlas as a competitor to Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, potentially redefining how browsers integrate AI assistants into the core user experience.

**OpenAI Launches AI-Powered Web Browser 'ChatGPT Atlas' with Memory and Task-Execution Features**
OpenAI launched a new web browser, 'ChatGPT Atlas', on October 21, 2025, officially available to users of ChatGPT Free/Plus/Pro/Go plans. The macOS version is already globally accessible, with Windows, iOS, and Android versions scheduled for release shortly. ChatGPT Atlas is OpenAI's native browser integrating ChatGPT functionality, enabling users to summon ChatGPT from various points such as new tab pages, dedicated panes, and text field cursors. The browser leverages browsing history and real-time activity to allow ChatGPT to remember user behavior, offering personalized suggestions and context-aware responses—such as creating to-do lists based on recent activity or researching holiday gift ideas based on previously viewed products. Users retain full control over stored data: they can review, delete browsing history, or clear all memory via settings. Additional features include a secret mode that temporarily logs users out of their ChatGPT account, and the ability to toggle ChatGPT’s access on a per-website basis. An AI agent feature enables ChatGPT to autonomously perform tasks—like searching for ingredients, purchasing them, and arranging home delivery—when given a recipe. However, security restrictions prevent code execution, file downloads, or access to the PC’s file system or other applications. The feature is currently offered as a preview for ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business users. Future updates will include multi-profile support and enhanced developer tools.

Available initially on macOS and set to launch on Windows, iOS, and Android, Atlas is positioned as a direct competitor to Google Chrome. Built on Chromium, it features a familiar interface with a 'Ask ChatGPT' bar that enables users to summarize pages, interact with content, and perform contextual searches without leaving the current tab. The browser integrates the ChatGPT Agent, an automation tool allowing AI to perform tasks such as filling forms, booking restaurants, or completing online spreadsheets—currently available only to Plus, Pro, and Business subscribers. Atlas also leverages ChatGPT’s evolving memory to personalize responses based on user preferences and history. OpenAI describes it as a tool for 'vibe living,' akin to 'vibe coding' with GPT-5, where AI handles daily tasks—such as automatically ordering ingredients after a recipe discussion. Sam Altman stated, 'Just as GPT-5 helps code, Atlas helps live better.' Privacy features include opt-in memory, history deletion, and private browsing, with no default use of navigation data to train AI models. This launch marks a strategic expansion for OpenAI beyond its search engine, ChatGPT Search (which had 40 million European users by April 2025), now targeting Google’s core dominance in web navigation by unifying search, automation, and conversation in one interface. OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the universal human–internet interface.

**OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-Powered Browser, in Global Push Against Google**
OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser, on October 21, 2025, entering direct competition with Google’s Chrome. The browser was introduced in a live stream featuring CEO Sam Altman, who stated, 'The way we envision people using the Internet in the future... a conversational experience in a browser could be a great equivalent.' Atlas is available globally, including in Europe, with macOS access starting on October 21, and Windows, iOS, and Android versions coming 'soon.' Key features include persistent 'memories' that track and personalize browsing history, which users can view and manage. A 'agent mode' allows ChatGPT to perform tasks autonomously, such as making purchases or editing documents—currently limited to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers. OpenAI emphasized user privacy: browsing history can be cleared, incognito mode is available, and user data is not used to train its AI models. Parental controls from ChatGPT are transferred to Atlas, including the ability to disable memories and agent mode. This move marks a growing rivalry in AI browsers, with Google planning to integrate its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome and Perplexity already offering an AI-powered browser focused on optimized search and Amazon shopping.

**OpenAI launches new web browser ChatGPT Atlas**
OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser designed to function as a 'super-assistant' by understanding users' online activities and helping complete tasks without switching tabs or copying and pasting. The browser features a split-screen layout with the user's webpage on one side and ChatGPT on the other, enabling real-time summarization and explanation of content. It includes built-in ChatGPT memory, 'agent mode' for limited automated actions such as researching topics, booking appointments, or summarizing websites, and the ability to recall context, revisit past pages, and act based on browsing history. Users can manage and delete saved history at any time, and by default, OpenAI does not use browsing content for training unless users opt in. Atlas cannot run code, download files, install extensions, or access other apps, and it pauses on private sites like banking platforms. The browser is currently available on macOS worldwide, with versions for Windows, iOS, and Android forthcoming. OpenAI's move positions it to directly compete with Google’s Gemini-integrated Chrome and startups like Perplexity, which launched its own AI browser earlier in 2025.

**ChatGPT Atlas browser by OpenAI: Release date, platforms and how you can download it easily**
ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser developed by OpenAI, was released globally on macOS on October 21, 2025, for Free, Plus, Pro, and Go users, with Business, Enterprise, and Edu users gaining access if enabled by their administrators. The browser features a ChatGPT sidebar for summarizing content, comparing products, analyzing data, and answering questions; Agent Mode for completing tasks end-to-end such as event planning or online shopping; and Browser Memory, which allows users to recall browsing context and past chats—such as 'Summarize the job postings I viewed last week'—with privacy controls, including the ability to browse logged out, clear history, and manage memories. Agent Mode does not run code, download files, or access other apps, and sensitive actions like logging into financial accounts require explicit user approval. OpenAI advises caution when using Agent Mode to prevent unintended or malicious behavior. Future updates are expected to include multi-profile support, enhanced developer tools, and improved app integration. Versions for Windows, iOS, and Android are forthcoming. Users can download ChatGPT Atlas from chatgpt.com/atlas and import bookmarks, passwords, and browsing history from their current browser, according to Reuters. The launch positions ChatGPT Atlas as a competitor to browsers like Google Chrome, Perplexity’s Comet, and Opera’s Neon.

**OpenAI Launches AI Browser ChatGPT Atlas**
OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a web browser that integrates ChatGPT directly into everyday browsing tasks, with a global release for macOS today available to Free, Plus, Pro, and Go users. Windows, iOS, and Android versions are planned for future release. Atlas embeds ChatGPT in the new-tab experience to handle queries, search, and inline writing without requiring tab switching. It leverages context from users’ web history, currently open pages, and logged-in sites to personalize responses. The browser remembers details from prior sessions to resurface pages, automate repetitive tasks, and continue unfinished work. Users can issue natural-language commands—such as 'reopen tabs from yesterday' or 'clean up open tabs'—which Atlas executes natively. OpenAI is also previewing an agent mode that allows ChatGPT to perform actions on behalf of users within the browser; access is restricted to Plus, Pro, and Business tiers during the preview. Privacy is emphasized: browsing history can be cleared, incognito mode is available, and browser memory is opt-in and fully manageable by users. OpenAI stated that it does not use browsing content to train its models by default. The product is positioned as part of a broader initiative toward a context-aware assistant for research, shopping, planning, work, and learning. Additional information, including availability, use cases, safety details, and a product blog, is available in OpenAI’s press materials.

### ChatGPT Atlas
ChatGPT Atlas (also known as simply Atlas) is an AI browser developed by OpenAI. It is based on Chromium and is currently only available on macOS. On October 21, 2025, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Atlas and released it for macOS. The announcement stated that versions for Windows, iOS, and Android were coming soon. The initial macOS rollout places the browser in a position to compete with established browsers like Google Chrome. The browser was introduced shortly after the release of Comet by Perplexity AI. Built on the Chromium engine, ChatGPT Atlas is integrated with the assistant platform of ChatGPT within the browser, providing features such as webpage summarization, inline text editing, and agentic functions. It is integrated with tools such as ChatGPT Search and ChatGPT agent. The browser operates on a freemium model, providing a free version alongside paid subscriptions, with certain advanced features, such as the agent mode, available only to Plus and Pro subscribers. ChatGPT Atlas features a ChatGPT sidebar within the browser that allows users to ask questions about the current webpage, summarize information, compare products, and analyze data from any site. The "browser memories" feature allows ChatGPT to remember facts and insights from visited sites to provide context, subject to user privacy controls. OpenAI has stated that "browser memories" are held on its servers for 30 days and are deleted afterward, and that user data would only be disclosed via "valid" legal processes or in an "emergency situation". The browser includes an optional agent mode for premium subscribers. It gives the AI a cursor and highlights the browser UI in blue, allowing it to perform tasks such as booking hotels and creating documents. Anil Dash has called it as an "anti-web browser", stating that it "actively fights against the web". He noted that it "substitutes its own AI-generated content for the web, but it looks like it's showing you the web", and described how, when he typed "Taylor Swift" into the search box, "the results had literally zero links to Taylor Swift's actual website". He emphasized that "all of these shortcomings are not because the browser is new and has bugs; this is the app working as designed." He further observed that Atlas's command-line interface is "worse in every conceivable way" than standard web browsers, and castigated its effect on online privacy

. In October 2025, cybersecurity firm LayerX Security reported the discovery of a vulnerability in OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser, which the firm named "ChatGPT Tainted Memories." The exploit reportedly utilizes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw to inject persistent, malicious instructions into the AI model's memory. According to the researchers, these hidden instructions could survive across user sessions and devices, potentially allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized commands or code when a user subsequently issues a legitimate prompt. LayerX also noted that the browser, at the time of the report, lacked robust anti-phishing protections, which they claimed heightened the potential risk of the vulnerability. The firm stated it had responsibly disclosed its findings to OpenAI. Internet portal History of web browsers List of web browsers Bhuiyan, Johana (October 21, 2025).

### OpenAI
. On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4, both as an API (with a waitlist) and as a feature of ChatGPT Plus. On November 6, 2023, OpenAI launched GPTs, allowing individuals to create customized versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes, further expanding the possibilities of AI applications across various industries. On November 14, 2023, OpenAI announced they temporarily suspended new sign-ups for ChatGPT Plus due to high demand. Access for newer subscribers re-opened a month later on December 13. In December 2024, the company launched the Sora model. It also launched OpenAI o1, an early reasoning model that was internally codenamed strawberry. Additionally, ChatGPT Pro—a $200/month subscription service offering unlimited o1 access and enhanced voice features—was introduced, and preliminary benchmark results for the upcoming OpenAI o3 models were shared. On January 23, 2025, OpenAI released Operator, an AI agent and web automation tool for accessing websites to execute goals defined by users. The feature was only available to Pro users in the United States. OpenAI released deep research agent, nine days later. It scored a 27% accuracy on the benchmark Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). Altman later stated GPT-4.5 would be the last model without full chain-of-thought reasoning. In July 2025, reports indicated that AI models by both OpenAI and Google DeepMind solved mathematics problems at the level of top-performing students in the International Mathematical Olympiad. OpenAI's large language model was able to achieve gold medal-level performance, reflecting significant progress in AI's reasoning abilities. In September 2025, OpenAI released a first-of-its-kind study revealing how people use ChatGPT for everyday tasks. The study found that "non-work tasks" (according to an LLM-based classifier) account for more than 72 percent of all ChatGPT usage, with a minority of overall usage related to business productivity. On October 6, OpenAI unveiled its Agent Builder platform during the company's DevDay event. The platform features a drag-and-drop visual interface that allows developers and businesses to design, test, and deploy agentic workflows without requiring extensive coding expertise

OpenAI

. On October 21 2025, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Atlas, a browser integrating the ChatGPT assistant directly into web navigation, to compete with existing browsers such as Google Chrome and Apple Safari. In March 2023, the company was criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards. OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn. OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky, and that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models would become "obvious" in a few years. In July 2023, OpenAI launched the superalignment project, aiming to find within 4 years how to align future superintelligences by automating alignment research using AI. OpenAI promised to dedicate 20% of its computing resources to the project, although the team denied receiving anything close to 20%. OpenAI ended the project in May 2024 after its co-leaders Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike left the company. In August 2025, OpenAI was criticized after thousands of private ChatGPT conversations were inadvertently exposed to public search engines like Google due to an experimental "share with search engines" feature. The opt-in toggle, intended to allow users to make specific chats discoverable, resulted in some discussions including personal details such as names, locations, and intimate topics appearing in search results when users accidentally enabled it while sharing links. OpenAI announced the feature's permanent removal on August 1, 2025, and the company began coordinating with search providers to remove the exposed content, emphasizing that it was not a security breach but a design flaw that heightened privacy risks. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue in a podcast, noting users often treat ChatGPT as a confidant for deeply personal matters, which amplified concerns about AI handling sensitive data

. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification. Released in 2019, MuseNet is a deep neural net trained to predict subsequent musical notes in MIDI music files. It can generate songs with 10 instruments in 15 styles. According to The Verge, a song generated by MuseNet tends to start reasonably but then fall into chaos the longer it plays. In pop culture, initial applications of this tool were used as early as 2020 for the internet psychological thriller Ben Drowned to create music for the titular character. Released in 2020, Jukebox is an open-sourced algorithm to generate music with vocals. After training on 1.2 million samples, the system accepts a genre, an artist, and a snippet of lyrics and outputs song samples. OpenAI stated the songs "show local musical coherence [and] follow traditional chord patterns" but acknowledged that the songs lack "familiar larger musical structures such as choruses that repeat" and that "there is a significant gap" between Jukebox and human-generated music. The Verge stated "It's technologically impressive, even if the results sound like mushy versions of songs that might feel familiar", while Business Insider stated "surprisingly, some of the resulting songs are catchy and sound legitimate". In 2018, OpenAI launched the Debate Game, which teaches machines to debate toy problems in front of a human judge. The purpose is to research whether such an approach may assist in auditing AI decisions and in developing explainable AI. Released in 2020, Microscope is a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight neural network models which are often studied in interpretability. Microscope was created to analyze the features that form inside these neural networks easily. The models included are AlexNet, VGG-19, different versions of Inception, and different versions of CLIP Resnet. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate content. Users can interact with it through text or voice conversations. It can generate images using GPT-4o, which replaced DALL-E 3. ChatGPT gained 100 million users during the two months following its launch. OpenAI launched multiple subscription plans: Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise

Products and applications of OpenAI

. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can access GPT-4o, but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models. In May 2023, OpenAI launched a user interface for ChatGPT for the App Store on iOS and later in July 2023 for the Play Store on Android. In December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to 15 minutes per month for free. SearchGPT, a prototype search engine developed by OpenAI, was unveiled on July 25, 2024, with an initial limited release to 10,000 test users. It combines traditional search engine features with generative AI capabilities. In October 2025, OpenAI released a web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. Unveiled in 2024, Stargate was initially a $100 billion project between OpenAI and Microsoft to build data-centers. The name "Stargate" is a homage to the 1994 sci-fi film Stargate. It eventually became a company, Stargate LLC, which was founded in January 2025 as a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX. On May 21, 2025, OpenAI announced the acquisition of io, an AI hardware startup founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive. The deal, valued at approximately $6.5 billion, marks OpenAI's strategic entry into the consumer hardware market. Ive, known for designing the iPhone, iPad and iMac, will lead hardware and design efforts for OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive have expressed a shared vision for developing AI-native devices that go beyond conventional screens and interfaces. Though specific product details have not been released, the Washington Post reports that Ive and Altman have already been working on a new product. "The first one I’ve been working on has just completely captured my imagination,” said Jony Ive. Altman added, “I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.” The company has also started to work in the robotics space with the goal of creating general purpose robots.

### ChatGPT
. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California. OpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback. ChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia. ChatGPT is a chatbot and AI assistant built on large language model technology. It is designed to generate human-like text and can carry out a wide variety of tasks. These include, among many others, writing and debugging computer programs, composing music, scripts, fairy tales, and essays, answering questions (sometimes at a level exceeding that of an average human test-taker), and generating business concepts. ChatGPT is frequently used for translation and summarization tasks, and can simulate interactive environments such as a Linux terminal, a multi-user chat room, or simple text-based games such as tic-tac-toe. Users interact with ChatGPT through conversations which consist of text, audio, and image inputs and outputs. The user's inputs to these conversations are referred to as prompts. They can explicitly tell ChatGPT to remember aspects of the conversation, and ChatGPT can use these details in future conversations. ChatGPT can also decide for itself to remember details. Users can also choose to disable the memory feature. To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI "Moderation endpoint" API (a separate GPT-based AI). In March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT. This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram. In October 2024, ChatGPT Search was introduced. It allows ChatGPT to search the web in an attempt to make more accurate and up-to-date responses

ChatGPT

. In December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT with a telephone for up to 15 minutes per month for free. In March 2025, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to generate images using GPT-4o instead of DALL-E. The model can also generate new images based on existing ones provided in the prompt, which can, for example, be used to transform images with specific styles or inpaint areas. In September 2025, OpenAI added a feature called Pulse, which generates a daily analysis of a user's chats and connected apps such as Gmail and Google Calendar. In October 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a browser integrating the ChatGPT assistant directly into web navigation, to compete with existing browsers such as Google Chrome and Apple's Safari. It is initially only available on macOS. ChatGPT was initially free to the public, and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later. In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, the paid version of the website was still experimental, but provided access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds. OpenAI later introduced the subscription plans "ChatGPT Team" and "ChatGPT Enterprise". What was offered on the paid plan versus the free tier changed as OpenAI has continued to update ChatGPT, and a Pro tier at $200/mo was introduced in December 2024. The Pro launch coincided with the release of the o1 model, providing unlimited access to o1 and advanced voice mode. GPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users. Premium users were originally limited in the number of messages they could send to the new model, but OpenAI increased and eventually removed these limits. Over many iterations of ChatGPT, plus users maintained more access to better models than the free tier provided, and access to additional features like voice mode. In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and a browsing mode (with Internet access). In October 2023, OpenAI's image generation model DALL-E 3 was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise

ChatGPT

. The integration used ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversations with users. On August 19, 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go in India, a low-cost subscription plan priced at ₹399 per month, offering ten times higher message, image generation, and file-upload limits, double the memory span compared to the free version, and support for UPI payments. In May 2023, OpenAI launched an iOS app for ChatGPT. In July 2023, OpenAI unveiled an Android app, initially rolling it out in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, and the U.S. ChatGPT can also power Android's assistant. An app for Windows launched on the Microsoft Store on October 15, 2024. ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI; these cost "hundreds of millions of dollars". Following ChatGPT's success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023. TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023. Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimated in 2023 that a series of 5 to 50 prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 0.5 liters (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 U.S. gal) of water for Microsoft servers' cooling. OpenAI met Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI worked with a team of 40 Icelandic volunteers to fine-tune ChatGPT's Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland's attempts to preserve the Icelandic language. ChatGPT (based on GPT-4) was better able to translate Japanese to English when compared to Bing, Bard, and DeepL in 2023. Researchers suggested this was due to its higher ability to capture the context. In December 2023, the Albanian government decided to use ChatGPT for the rapid translation of European Union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for Albania's accession to the EU. In February 2024, PCMag journalists conducted a test to assess the translation capabilities of ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft Bing, and compared them to Google Translate
