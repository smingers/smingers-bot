## Your Role: historian
As a historian and superforecaster, I will focus on historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past to inform my probability estimate for the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser for Windows before March 14, 2026.

Based on the historical patterns and precedents I've observed, there are a few key factors to consider:

1. **Platform Expansion Timelines**: Historically, major tech companies have often taken 6-12 months to expand their flagship software products to new platforms after an initial launch. For example, when Apple released its Safari browser in 2003, the Windows version followed about a year later in 2004. Similarly, Google's Chrome browser launched on Windows in 2008, several months after the initial macOS release in 2007. This suggests that a 6-18 month timeline for a Windows version of ChatGPT Atlas would be fairly typical.

2. **OpenAI's Product Release History**: Looking at OpenAI's past product launches, they have generally taken a measured and deliberate approach, prioritizing quality and stability over rapid cross-platform expansion. For instance, their flagship product ChatGPT was initially released in November 2022 as an invite-only beta, with a public release following several months later in March 2023. This cautious rollout strategy makes me think they may take a similar approach with ChatGPT Atlas, focusing on the initial macOS version before expanding to other platforms.

3. **Competitive Landscape and Regulatory Scrutiny**: The tech industry is currently facing increased regulatory pressure, particularly around AI-powered products. OpenAI may be taking a more cautious approach with ChatGPT Atlas to navigate this landscape and avoid any potential issues with platform partners like Apple and Google. This could lead to delays in the Windows release as they work to ensure compliance and compatibility.

Weighing these historical patterns and OpenAI's product release tendencies, I believe the lack of a concrete Windows release timeline and the absence of any recent updates on this front make a pre-March 14, 2026 release **unlikely but not impossible**. If development follows a similar trajectory to the macOS launch, a surprise announcement could still occur, but the evidence suggests delays beyond the specified deadline are more probable.

## Evidence Summary:
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Lack of updates, competitive/regulatory pressures, OpenAI's cautious release history
- Net direction: DOWN
