The islands, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands, were ceded by Denmark for 25 million gold dollars after decades of economic decline following the abolition of slavery in 1848. Once a lucrative sugar-producing colony reliant on enslaved labor, the territory became a financial burden. During World War I, the U.S. pressured Denmark\u2014neutrally aligned at the time\u2014by threatening invasion if the sale did not proceed, with historian Astrid Andersen noting, 'There are echoes of what we hear today about Greenland, because what the U.S. said was: \u201cEither you sell it to us or we\u2019ll invade.\u201d' The U.S. officially took control in 1917, and today the islands remain a U.S. unincorporated territory with U.S. citizenship for residents but no voting rights in presidential elections. This historical transaction underscores that Denmark has previously sacrificed strategic territories under geopolitical and economic pressure, making the current Greenland debate a recurring geopolitical theme.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 03:44 PM\nSource: [Radio Mitre \u270b\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffd](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/mundo/las-islas-que-dinamarca-le-vendio-a-estados-unidos-hace-mas-de-un-siglo/)\n\n**They Tried Several Times: How the U.S. Attempted to Buy Greenland**\nThe United States attempted multiple times to purchase Greenland from Denmark, with historical efforts dating back to 1867, when the deal nearly succeeded but ultimately failed.

Although tensions between the U.S. and Europe eased temporarily due to a proposed 'framework agreement' on Greenland, the deal remains uncertain, as Greenland has already rejected the idea. The U.S. has a history of territorial acquisitions, including the Louisiana Purchase (1803, $15 million), Florida (1819, $5 million), Alaska (1867, $7.2 million), and the Danish West Indies (1917, $25 million in gold, equivalent to ~$650 million today). The article notes that international norms have changed since the 19th century, particularly with the UN Charter\u2019s principle of self-determination, which requires consent from both Denmark and Greenland\u2019s residents for any transfer.

The sale was first negotiated in 1867 for 7.5 million gold dollars, but rejected by the U.S. Congress due to perceived lack of economic value. The deal was finalized in 1916 for 25 million dollars in gold, following renewed concerns during World War I that Germany might invade Denmark and seize control of the islands, threatening U.S. security. According to Danish historian Astrid Andersen, the U.S. effectively pressured Denmark with the message: 'Either sell it to us or we will invade.' The U.S. took control in 1917 and raised its flag for the first time. Today, residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands hold U.S. citizenship but cannot vote in U.S. federal elections.

Residents, like Afro-Caribbean historian Stephanie Chalana Brown, who descends from enslaved Africans brought by Danish colonizers, express concern that Greenland could face a similar fate: being subject to external decisions without consent.

While Trump claimed in 2024 at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the U.S. made a 'stupid' mistake by returning Greenland to Denmark, historical records show that the 1941 agreement explicitly recognized Danish sovereignty, meaning no return was necessary. The U.S. did, however, show renewed geopolitical interest during the Cold War, leading to President Harry Truman\u2019s 1946 offer to purchase Greenland for $100 million in gold\u2014equivalent to about $17 billion today\u2014which Denmark rejected. Today, both Greenlanders and Danes remain resolute in opposing any sale, even to a potential $700 billion offer. Historically, Greenland was first settled by Norse explorers around 900 CE, with Erik the Red naming it 'Greenland' to attract settlers. The island has been under Danish sovereignty since the 18th century, with Denmark maintaining control over Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Inuit, who make up 85% of Greenland\u2019s population, have a long history of peaceful coexistence with Danes, though they face social challenges in Copenhagen. The article notes that Trump\u2019s interest stems from geostrategic concerns (Arctic access), natural resources (oil, gas, rare earths), and personal legacy. The Circumpolar Inuit Council has rejected Trump\u2019s proposal, emphasizing past colonial trauma. Danish public opinion remains strongly nationalist, and the country would likely not support military intervention to defend Greenland if the U.S. attempted a forced takeover.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 07:16 PM\nSource: [La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/de-la-guerra-al-intento-de-compra-la-historia-contradice-el-relato-de-trump-sobre-groenlandia-nid22012026/)\n\n**A History That Wants to Be Repeated: How Denmark Sold Part of Its Country for $25 Million, Birth of the U.S. Virgin Islands**\nThe article explores the historical precedent for territorial acquisition by the United States, highlighting Denmark's 1917 sale of the Danish West Indies to the U.S. for $25 million in gold. The islands, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands, were once a cornerstone of the Atlantic slave trade and sugar production, with over 120,000 enslaved Africans transported from West Africa to the Caribbean. The economic model collapsed after the abolition of slavery in 1848, leading to a loss of profitability and increasing administrative burden for Denmark. Despite initial resistance, including a blocked 1902 agreement, negotiations resumed during World War I, driven by U.S. strategic interests in preventing European influence in the Caribbean. A national referendum in Denmark, the first in its history, approved the sale in 1916. The treaty included a clause recognizing Danish sovereignty over Greenland, a provision that still holds relevance today. After the transfer, the Danish crown remained the official currency until 1934, and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to drive on the left\u2014a remnant of their colonial past. The article argues that the idea of buying territory, as recently advocated by Donald Trump regarding Greenland, is not as eccentric as it seems, but rather rooted in a historical norm of diplomatic land transactions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 01:42 PM\nSource: [Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/una-historia-que-quiere-volver-a-repetirse-cuando-dinamarca-vendio-parte-de-su-pais-por-25-millones-de-dolares-la-increible-historia-real-de-como-nacieron-las-islas-virgenes-de-estados-unidos-2000215942)\n\n**Before Trump: The Long History of America's Dream to Buy Greenland**\nThe idea of the United States purchasing Greenland has deep historical roots, predating Donald Trump's 2019 remarks. In 1867, following the American Civil War, Secretary of State William Seward acquired Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million (equivalent to approximately $120 million today), despite initial public criticism. Robert J. Walker, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, later urged Seward to pursue the purchase of Danish colonies, including Greenland and Iceland, citing Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth and strategic value. However, no formal offer was made. In 1910, U.S. Ambassador Maurice Francis Egan proposed a swap of Philippine territories for Danish West Indies and Greenland, aiming to help Denmark reclaim Northern Schleswig from Germany, but Denmark showed no interest, and the proposal died. In 1946, during the early Cold War, the U.S. secretly offered $100 million in gold bars to Denmark for Greenland, which was rejected. The U.S. had already established military presence in Greenland during WWII through a 1941 agreement by Danish representative Henrik Kauffmann, bypassing occupied Denmark. In 1955, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a classified report titled 'Possible Acquisition of Greenland by the United States,' arguing strategic and geographic reasons, but the State Department rejected it in 1959, citing political risks and the fact that Greenland was an integrated part of Denmark. In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower reportedly discussed the idea with King Frederik IX of Denmark, who declined. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and self-government in 2009. According to Niels Bjerre-Poulsen, a lecturer at the Center for American Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, Trump\u2019s proposal is not driven by rational strategic need but reflects a dated, outdated worldview. He believes no other U.S. president would pursue such a plan, as it lacks contemporary relevance.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 09:51 PM\nSource: [nyheder.tv2.dk](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2026-01-21-foer-trump-var-det-truman-koebsdroemmen-om-groenland-gaar-langt-tilbage)\n\n**Did US give Greenland to Denmark after WW2? Fact-checking Trump's 'stupid' claim at Davos**\nPresident Donald Trump claimed during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2026, that the United States gave Greenland back to Denmark after World War II, calling the decision 'stupid.' However, this claim is factually incorrect. Greenland was never American territory, so it could not have been 'given back.' Historical context shows that Denmark-Norway began colonizing Greenland in 1721, and after the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, Denmark retained control. Greenland became an integral part of Denmark in 1953, gained home rule in 1979, and further autonomy in 2009, with Denmark retaining responsibility for defense and foreign policy. During World War II, the U.S. signed the Defense of Greenland Agreement with Denmark in exile in 1941 and established military bases. In 1946, President Harry Truman offered $100 million to purchase Greenland, which Denmark rejected. Trump revived the idea in 2019, but Denmark again rejected the proposal, calling it 'absurd.' The U.S. has never owned Greenland, making Trump\u2019s claim a misrepresentation of history.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 05:10 PM\nSource: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/did-us-own-greenland-give-to-denmark-after-world-war-2-fact-checking-trumps-stupid-claim-at-davos-101769010422536.html)\n\n**Letter to the editor: We've been trying to buy Greenland for over 150 years**\nCmdr. Wayne L. Johnson, U.S. Navy (retired), argues in a letter to the editor that President Trump's proposal to buy Greenland is neither new nor unreasonable, citing a long history of U.S. attempts to acquire the island. The first attempt occurred in 1867, the same year the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia. A second attempt took place in 1910, when the U.S. also sought to buy the Danish Virgin Islands, which Denmark sold for $25 million in gold in 1917\u2014primarily for strategic naval reasons related to the Panama Canal. After Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, the U.S. occupied Greenland and did not withdraw until after the war ended, much to Denmark\u2019s displeasure. The U.S. has maintained at least one military base in Greenland since then. In 1946, the U.S. secretly offered to buy Greenland, which Denmark rejected. Greenland has been under NATO protection since 1949. In 1955, the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed acquiring Greenland, and President Trump has made similar proposals during both of his presidencies. The letter emphasizes that the idea of acquiring Greenland has deep historical roots in U.S. foreign policy and strategic interests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 11:32 AM\nSource: [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/jan/21/letter-editor-weve-trying-buy-greenland-150-years/)\n\n**Precedent for Greenland Acquisition? How the U.S. Once Bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark**\nThe article discusses the historical precedent for the United States purchasing territory from Denmark, drawing a parallel to Donald Trump's repeated calls to acquire Greenland. It notes that in 1917, during World War I, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson facilitated the purchase of the Danish West Indies\u2014now the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014from Denmark for 25 million dollars (equivalent to about 550 million euros today). The deal was finalized after two failed attempts, driven by U.S. strategic concerns about German influence in the Caribbean. Denmark, facing financial hardship and geopolitical vulnerability, accepted the offer, with a referendum on the Danish mainland approving the sale, though island residents were not consulted. The article contrasts this historical transaction with current speculation that the U.S. might pay up to 700 billion dollars for Greenland, emphasizing Trump's argument that only U.S. ownership can protect Greenland from Russia and China. The piece underscores that Greenland remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, alongside Denmark proper and the Faroe Islands, and uses the 1917 deal as a potential model for future U.S.-Danish negotiations.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 05:29 PM\nSource: [N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Als-Daenemark-den-USA-eine-Inselgruppe-verkauft-hat-id30256623.html)\n\n**100-Year-Old D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu: The U.S. and Its Endless Territorial Ambitions in Greenland and the Danish West Indies**\nThe article discusses the historical parallels between the United States' current pursuit of Greenland and its 1917 acquisition of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands). In 1917, the U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies for $25 million (approximately $600 million in today's value, or 880 billion KRW), following a complex negotiation process that included multiple failed attempts due to Senate rejection and Danish refusal to ratify, partly because local residents' referendums were not guaranteed. The U.S. renewed its interest during World War I due to strategic concerns over European powers occupying the region, especially after the Panama Canal's opening heightened the area's strategic importance. In a significant move, the U.S. pressured Denmark into signing a treaty on August 4, 1916, while simultaneously declaring that Denmark had no political or economic interest in Greenland, effectively securing Greenland's status in exchange for giving up the West Indies. After World War II, the U.S. recognized Greenland's strategic value and began seeking its acquisition. Former President Donald Trump, who had long expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, announced on January 17, 2026, that the U.S. would impose a 10% tariff on imports from eight European countries starting February 1, increasing to 25% by June 1, in response to their opposition to the Greenland acquisition. This date marked exactly 109 years since the U.S.-Denmark treaty for the West Indies was formally ratified.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 05:35 AM\nSource: [\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1240309.html)\n\n**Trump's Greenland Purchase Plan: A History of U.S. Land Acquisitions**\nDonald Trump has stated seriously that he intends to purchase Greenland, a claim that reflects a long-standing interest by the United States in acquiring territory from Denmark. Historical examples include the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France for $15 million, which encompassed over two million square kilometers; the 1819 acquisition of Florida from Spain, effectively a debt-for-land settlement involving compensation for damages caused by escaped slaves; the 1818 Jackson Purchase from an Indigenous people for $300,000; the 1848 acquisition of land from Mexico for approximately $15 million, including parts of present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, along with assumption of U.S. citizens\u2019 debts to Mexico; and the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia for over $7 million. The U.S. also acquired the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million to secure strategic control of the Caribbean. Although no formal offer was made to buy Iceland from Denmark, the U.S. has again expressed interest in Greenland, citing national security as a key reason. The article notes that in 1946, the U.S. offered $100 million for Greenland, which was rejected by Denmark. The claim that the U.S. acquired nearly 40% of its current territory through purchases is supported by historical records.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 02:24 PM\nSource: [Blick.ch](https://www.blick.ch/ausland/jetzt-auch-groenland-im-visier-so-vergroesserten-die-usa-in-der-vergangenheit-ihr-staatsgebiet-id21600669.html)\n\n**U.S. Interest in Purchasing Greenland: Historical Precedents and Legal Challenges**\nThe United States has historically expanded its territory through purchases and cessions, and under President Donald Trump, there has been renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, currently an autonomous territory of Denmark. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Trump is willing to buy Greenland, though he did not rule out military intervention. This interest dates back to the 19th century, with William H. Seward proposing the purchase of Greenland and Iceland after acquiring Alaska from Russia in 1867. In 1946, President Harry Truman offered $100 million to Denmark, which was rejected. Trump revived the idea during both his first and second terms, framing the acquisition as a national security necessity. Igor Lucena, a doctor in International Relations, noted that Trump\u2019s push aligns with Republican Party political appeals. Experts such as Lu\u00eds Alexandre Carta Winter from PUC-PR explained that international law permits the purchase or leasing of territory, citing existing U.S. leases in other countries. However, Denmark and Greenland have clearly stated that Greenland is not for sale. BBC experts assess that such a transaction would be extremely complex and unlikely, even with Greenland\u2019s consent, due to the principle of self-determination, which requires approval from Greenland\u2019s residents. Joseph Blocher of Duke University emphasized that any transfer must involve Greenland\u2019s right to self-determination. Additionally, Congress would need to approve the purchase, requiring a two-thirds Senate majority\u2014considered highly unlikely. The cost is estimated in billions or trillions of dollars, given Greenland\u2019s vast, underexplored mineral resources and strategic value amid competition from Russia and China. The transaction would also require EU approval. Historical precedents include the Louisiana Purchase (1803, $15 million), the Florida Cession (1819, $5 million in debt settlement), the Mexican Cession (1848, $15 million + $3.2 million debt), the Alaska Purchase (1867, $7.2 million), and the Virgin Islands sale (1917, $25 million in gold). Other territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and Hawaii were acquired through war or annexation, not direct purchase.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 01:07 AM\nSource: [Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/mundo/groenlandia-como-funciona-compra-territorios-entre-paises/)\n\n**Background: The Purchase of Greenland \u2013 Legally Unfeasible**\nThe idea of the United States purchasing Greenland is legally and politically deemed impossible under international law, according to a legal analysis by Scott R. Anderson, former legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State. Although U.S. President Donald Trump previously expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, both Denmark\u2014administratively responsible for the island\u2014and Greenland\u2019s autonomous government have rejected the proposal. Greenland, known as Kalaallit Nunaat by its indigenous population, has held substantial autonomy since 1979, expanded in 2009, and possesses the right to self-determination under international law, meaning Copenhagen cannot unilaterally sell the territory. While Denmark retains control over foreign and defense policy, Greenland remains financially dependent on Copenhagen. The 2009 Danish-Greenlandic agreement allows for a referendum on independence, subject to approval by the Danish parliament, though no compelling rationale exists for Greenland to align with the U.S. afterward. Historical attempts to purchase Greenland include a failed 1860s proposal, a $100 million offer post-World War II (unconfirmed), and rumored interest from Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in the 1970s. The U.S. has previously acquired large territories at low prices\u2014Alaska (1867, $7.2M), Louisiana (1803, ~$11M), and Florida (1819, $5M)\u2014but such transactions are not applicable to Greenland due to its self-determination rights.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 06:35 AM\nSource: [ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-08/21/kauf-groenlands-voelkerrechtlich-wohl-unmoeglich)\n\n**When Denmark sold territory to the US in 1917, long before today's Greenland debate**\nThe United States has a historical precedent for acquiring territory from Denmark, having purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917, which became the U.S. Virgin Islands. This past transaction is being referenced amid a renewed geopolitical debate over Greenland, where the U.S. has recently expressed renewed interest, prompting strong resistance from Denmark. Denmark, which is 0.44% the size of the U.S., maintains sovereignty over Greenland and has cited a 1952 Cold War-era military directive instructing its forces to 'shoot first, ask questions later' in the event of an incursion. Recent remarks by the U.S. President suggesting the possible use of force to seize Greenland have sparked concern across Europe, particularly given the existing U.S. military presence in Greenland.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2026 02:53 PM\nSource: [WION](https://www.wionews.com/photos/when-denmark-sold-territory-to-the-us-in-1917-long-before-today-s-greenland-debate-1768054678649)\n\n**A Brief History of the US Trying (and Failing) to Buy Greenland**\nThe United States has attempted to purchase Greenland multiple times since the 1860s, beginning with President Andrew Johnson's administration and Secretary of State William H. Seward's efforts to acquire Greenland and Iceland from Denmark. Although Congress rejected the proposal, interest persisted through the 20th century. In 1910, US Ambassador Maurice Francis Egan proposed trading Mindanao (then a US territory) for Greenland and the Danish West Indies, though no formal offer was made. President Harry S. Truman made a serious but secret offer in the early Cold War era, proposing $100 million in gold for Greenland, which Denmark declined. Instead, the 1951 US-Denmark treaty granted the US extensive military access, including the right to construct, maintain, and operate bases\u2014such as the current Pittufik Space Base\u2014without requiring a formal transfer of sovereignty. Despite this, President Donald Trump has reignited the debate, calling Greenland a 'large real estate deal' and suggesting military force might be used to secure it. His statements have alarmed US allies, including Denmark, which warned that any military seizure would end NATO cooperation. However, the US already has near-unrestricted military presence in Greenland under existing treaties, and Greenlandic residents have consistently shown no interest in joining the US. The article concludes that Trump\u2019s fixation may stem from his real estate background, but the geopolitical reality remains that Denmark and Greenland must consent to any sovereignty change, and the US currently enjoys de facto control without formal acquisition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 08:00 PM\nSource: [The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/brief-history-of-us-trying-failing-buy-greenland-ps-010826)\n\n**The Times the United States Tried to Buy a Country \u2013 Il Post**\nThe article discusses the historical context and legal implications of the United States potentially purchasing Greenland, a topic recently revived by former U.S. President Donald Trump. While Trump has repeatedly proposed buying Greenland\u2014drawing criticism from Greenlanders and Danish officials\u2014the idea is legally and ethically contentious. Under international law, particularly the principle of self-determination enshrined in the UN Charter, Greenland\u2019s residents, not the Danish government, hold the right to decide their political future. Polls indicate 85% of Greenlanders oppose the sale, 8% are undecided, and only 6% support it. The article notes that while territorial purchases were common in the 19th and early 20th centuries\u2014such as the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the acquisition of Florida and parts of the Southeast from Spain (1819), the Mexican Cession (1848), Alaska from Russia (1867), and the U.S. purchase of the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917\u2014such transactions are no longer compatible with modern international norms. The U.S. had previously attempted to buy Greenland in 1946, offering $100 million, but Denmark rejected the proposal. The article concludes that any such transaction today would be highly unlikely due to legal, political, and ethical barriers rooted in self-determination.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 03:54 PM\nSource: [Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2026/01/08/stati-uniti-acquisto-groenlandia/)\n\n**The U.S. and Greenland: A Historical Precedent for Purchase and the Challenges of a Modern Annexation**\nThe article discusses the historical precedent of the United States purchasing territory from Denmark\u2014the Virgin Islands in 1916\u2014for $25 million in gold, with the U.S. explicitly affirming Denmark\u2019s sovereignty over Greenland in the treaty. This historical context is used to analyze Donald Trump\u2019s recent interest in acquiring Greenland, a Danish territory. The article notes that while the U.S. has a long history of territorial acquisitions\u2014including Louisiana, Florida, Alaska, and the Philippines\u2014Greenland\u2019s potential purchase would be vastly more expensive, with estimates ranging from $50 billion (based on per capita payment) to over $4 trillion (adjusted for land value). Polls indicate strong opposition among Greenlanders to U.S. annexation, with only 6% in favor, and the pro-annexation party securing just 1% of votes. The article emphasizes that any forced acquisition would be unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution, as only Congress can admit new territories. Despite this, Trump\u2019s approach reflects a pattern of challenging legal and constitutional boundaries, as seen in his previous actions. The piece also highlights that the U.S. has previously used economic incentives and strategic military interests to expand its territory, but Greenland\u2019s case presents unique political and legal hurdles.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 03:41 PM\nSource: [elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/actualidad/noticias/13718938/01/26/la-ultima-vez-que-eeuu-se-hizo-con-territorio-de-dinamarca-asi-fue-la-venta-de-las-islas-virgenes-a-cambio-de-groenlandia.html)\n\n"
