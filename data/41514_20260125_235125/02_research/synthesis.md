## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on the latest diplomatic developments as of January 25, 2026 [1][2][3][4][5], the **United States will not offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026**. Here's why:  

1. **Sovereignty is Non-Negotiable**: Denmark has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected any sale of Greenland, calling sovereignty a "red line" [5][9][11][12][18]. The US has acknowledged this stance after failed pressure tactics (tariffs/military threats) [1][6][7].  

2. **Shift to Security-Only Talks**: Current discussions exclusively involve NATO-led Arctic security cooperation, with Denmark explicitly stating negotiations are "about security, security, and security"—not sovereignty transfer [2][3][4]. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed no military intervention plans [19][20].  

3. **Timeline Constraints**: With only 3 months until May 1, 2026:  
   - No formal purchase framework exists [12][18].  
   - Trust is severely eroded, with European diplomats calling the US "our former ally" [1].  
   - Denmark/Greenland are fortifying military defenses to deter US ambitions [8][13][18].  

4. **Broader Consensus Against Sale**:  
   - The EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's leadership oppose a transfer [5][13][18].  
   - Even Greenland's pro-independence factions reject becoming a US territory [16].  

**Limitations**: While the US interest persists [9][14][20], the decisive diplomatic pivot toward security-only cooperation—coupled with Denmark's uncompromising sovereignty stance—makes a formal purchase offer before May 1, 2026 highly improbable. Should US intentions resurface, Denmark's EU-backed resolve and Greenland's autonomous opposition remain significant barriers.

**The Danish Sale of the Virgin Islands: A Historical Precedent for the Greenland Debate**
The renewed tension between the United States and Denmark over Donald Trump's proposal to acquire Greenland has brought attention to a lesser-known historical precedent: Denmark's sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in 1917. The islands, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands, were ceded by Denmark for 25 million gold dollars after decades of economic decline following the abolition of slavery in 1848. Once a lucrative sugar-producing colony reliant on enslaved labor, the territory became a financial burden. During World War I, the U.S. pressured Denmark—neutrally aligned at the time—by threatening invasion if the sale did not proceed, with historian Astrid Andersen noting, 'There are echoes of what we hear today about Greenland, because what the U.S. said was: “Either you sell it to us or we’ll invade.”' The U.S. officially took control in 1917, and today the islands remain a U.S. unincorporated territory with U.S. citizenship for residents but no voting rights in presidential elections. This historical transaction underscores that Denmark has previously sacrificed strategic territories under geopolitical and economic pressure, making the current Greenland debate a recurring geopolitical theme.

**They Tried Several Times: How the U.S. Attempted to Buy Greenland**
The United States attempted multiple times to purchase Greenland from Denmark, with historical efforts dating back to 1867, when the deal nearly succeeded but ultimately failed. In 1910, the U.S. proposed a territorial exchange: two Philippine islands for Greenland and Danish West Indies, but the plan was deemed too complex. Instead, the U.S. acquired the Danish West Indies, which are now the U.S. Virgin Islands. During World War II, the Danish ambassador in Washington transferred control of Greenland to the U.S. due to strategic concerns. The U.S. later offered a substantial sum to purchase Greenland, but the deal did not materialize. The article, reported by RT correspondent Charlotte Dubenski, details these historical attempts at acquisition.

**What Does Donald Trump Want with Greenland? An Alternative Interpretation Rooted in U.S. Expansionist History**
Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has raised concerns about its impact on transatlantic relations. While the official U.S. rationale cites security and economic benefits—particularly in countering China’s growing influence—historical context suggests deeper motivations. The article presents an alternative interpretation rooted in U.S. history of territorial expansion, including the Louisiana Purchase (1803), annexation of Florida (1819), Texas statehood (1845), the Mexican Cession (1848), the Gadsden Purchase (1854), the Alaska Purchase (1867), and the acquisition of the Danish West Indies (1917). Notably, in 1867, Secretary of State William Seward attempted—but failed—to purchase Greenland and Iceland from Denmark. The article argues that Trump’s interest may be driven by a personal desire to secure a lasting place in American history by becoming the president who expanded the U.S. to its greatest size. With Greenland (2.1 million km²) nearly matching the size of Louisiana, and combined with Canada’s 9.98 million km², the U.S. could become the world’s largest country, surpassing Russia. The article questions whether the potential cost to transatlantic cooperation is too high for such ambitions.

**Greenland: How Much Have the U.S. Already Paid to Buy Foreign Territories?**
The article discusses the United States' historical interest in acquiring foreign territories, focusing on President Donald Trump's renewed proposal to purchase Greenland from Denmark. Although tensions between the U.S. and Europe eased temporarily due to a proposed 'framework agreement' on Greenland, the deal remains uncertain, as Greenland has already rejected the idea. The U.S. has a history of territorial acquisitions, including the Louisiana Purchase (1803, $15 million), Florida (1819, $5 million), Alaska (1867, $7.2 million), and the Danish West Indies (1917, $25 million in gold, equivalent to ~$650 million today). The article notes that international norms have changed since the 19th century, particularly with the UN Charter’s principle of self-determination, which requires consent from both Denmark and Greenland’s residents for any transfer. Experts estimate the current value of Greenland at between $12 billion and $77 billion (based on economic growth and inflation), or up to $700 billion (per NBC News), due to its vast mineral resources. The article also lists other U.S. territories acquired through purchase or war, such as Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines (later independent), and various Pacific islands, most of whose residents are U.S. citizens without voting rights in federal elections.

**U.S. Virgin Islands: The Territory Denmark Once Sold to the United States Over a Century Ago**
The article discusses historical and current tensions between the United States and Denmark over U.S. interest in purchasing Greenland, which Denmark has firmly rejected. Despite this, Denmark previously sold the Danish West Indies—now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands—to the United States. The sale was first negotiated in 1867 for 7.5 million gold dollars, but rejected by the U.S. Congress due to perceived lack of economic value. The deal was finalized in 1916 for 25 million dollars in gold, following renewed concerns during World War I that Germany might invade Denmark and seize control of the islands, threatening U.S. security. According to Danish historian Astrid Andersen, the U.S. effectively pressured Denmark with the message: 'Either sell it to us or we will invade.' The U.S. took control in 1917 and raised its flag for the first time. Today, residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands hold U.S. citizenship but cannot vote in U.S. federal elections. The islands, once reliant on sugar and slavery, became economically unviable after the abolition of slavery in 1848, prompting Denmark to view them as a financial burden, which led to the eventual sale.

**These islands were bought by US. Now they have a message for Greenland.**
The U.S. Virgin Islands, formerly the Danish West Indies, were purchased by President Woodrow Wilson in 1917 for $25 million, following threats of force, amid World War I concerns that Germany might seize Denmark and its territories. The islands, now an unincorporated U.S. territory, retain visible traces of Danish colonial rule—such as Danish-named cities like Frederiksted, red-yellow bricks, and sugar plantation ruins—while also reflecting Caribbean culture and American commercial influence, including McDonald's and Home Depot. Residents, like Afro-Caribbean historian Stephanie Chalana Brown, who descends from enslaved Africans brought by Danish colonizers, express concern that Greenland could face a similar fate: being subject to external decisions without consent. Brown emphasizes that Virgin Islanders were not consulted in the 1917 acquisition and only gained U.S. citizenship over a decade later, and today still lack voting rights in presidential elections or representation in Congress. As former President Donald Trump renews interest in securing access to Greenland—initially suggesting military force, later proposing a deal for 'total access'—residents of the Virgin Islands draw parallels to their own history. Felipe Ayala of the St. Thomas Historical Trust notes that while the recent arrival of U.S. Navy carriers (USS Gerald R. Ford and USS Iwo Jima) brought economic hope, it also sparked unease due to the sudden military presence. Brown warns that increased U.S. military presence in Greenland could lead to cultural erosion similar to what she sees in the Virgin Islands, where Americanization through media and institutions is diminishing Caribbean identity. She urges that Greenlanders be included in decisions about their future, stating, 'Those things weren't extended to Virgin Islanders.' Greenland’s Indigenous Inuit population, with distinct language and traditions, is now at the center of geopolitical attention, raising fears of a repeat of colonial patterns.

**Debunking Trump’s Greenland Narrative: Historical Reality Contradicts His Claims**
The article contradicts Donald Trump's narrative about Greenland, clarifying that the U.S. never owned Greenland and thus did not 'return' it to Denmark after World War II. While Trump claimed in 2024 at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the U.S. made a 'stupid' mistake by returning Greenland to Denmark, historical records show that the 1941 agreement explicitly recognized Danish sovereignty, meaning no return was necessary. The U.S. did, however, show renewed geopolitical interest during the Cold War, leading to President Harry Truman’s 1946 offer to purchase Greenland for $100 million in gold—equivalent to about $17 billion today—which Denmark rejected. Today, both Greenlanders and Danes remain resolute in opposing any sale, even to a potential $700 billion offer. Historically, Greenland was first settled by Norse explorers around 900 CE, with Erik the Red naming it 'Greenland' to attract settlers. The island has been under Danish sovereignty since the 18th century, with Denmark maintaining control over Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Inuit, who make up 85% of Greenland’s population, have a long history of peaceful coexistence with Danes, though they face social challenges in Copenhagen. The article notes that Trump’s interest stems from geostrategic concerns (Arctic access), natural resources (oil, gas, rare earths), and personal legacy. The Circumpolar Inuit Council has rejected Trump’s proposal, emphasizing past colonial trauma. Danish public opinion remains strongly nationalist, and the country would likely not support military intervention to defend Greenland if the U.S. attempted a forced takeover.

**A History That Wants to Be Repeated: How Denmark Sold Part of Its Country for $25 Million, Birth of the U.S. Virgin Islands**
The article explores the historical precedent for territorial acquisition by the United States, highlighting Denmark's 1917 sale of the Danish West Indies to the U.S. for $25 million in gold. The islands, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands, were once a cornerstone of the Atlantic slave trade and sugar production, with over 120,000 enslaved Africans transported from West Africa to the Caribbean. The economic model collapsed after the abolition of slavery in 1848, leading to a loss of profitability and increasing administrative burden for Denmark. Despite initial resistance, including a blocked 1902 agreement, negotiations resumed during World War I, driven by U.S. strategic interests in preventing European influence in the Caribbean. A national referendum in Denmark, the first in its history, approved the sale in 1916. The treaty included a clause recognizing Danish sovereignty over Greenland, a provision that still holds relevance today. After the transfer, the Danish crown remained the official currency until 1934, and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to drive on the left—a remnant of their colonial past. The article argues that the idea of buying territory, as recently advocated by Donald Trump regarding Greenland, is not as eccentric as it seems, but rather rooted in a historical norm of diplomatic land transactions.

**Before Trump: The Long History of America's Dream to Buy Greenland**
The idea of the United States purchasing Greenland has deep historical roots, predating Donald Trump's 2019 remarks. In 1867, following the American Civil War, Secretary of State William Seward acquired Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million (equivalent to approximately $120 million today), despite initial public criticism. Robert J. Walker, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, later urged Seward to pursue the purchase of Danish colonies, including Greenland and Iceland, citing Greenland’s mineral wealth and strategic value. However, no formal offer was made. In 1910, U.S. Ambassador Maurice Francis Egan proposed a swap of Philippine territories for Danish West Indies and Greenland, aiming to help Denmark reclaim Northern Schleswig from Germany, but Denmark showed no interest, and the proposal died. In 1946, during the early Cold War, the U.S. secretly offered $100 million in gold bars to Denmark for Greenland, which was rejected. The U.S. had already established military presence in Greenland during WWII through a 1941 agreement by Danish representative Henrik Kauffmann, bypassing occupied Denmark. In 1955, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a classified report titled 'Possible Acquisition of Greenland by the United States,' arguing strategic and geographic reasons, but the State Department rejected it in 1959, citing political risks and the fact that Greenland was an integrated part of Denmark. In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower reportedly discussed the idea with King Frederik IX of Denmark, who declined. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and self-government in 2009. According to Niels Bjerre-Poulsen, a lecturer at the Center for American Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, Trump’s proposal is not driven by rational strategic need but reflects a dated, outdated worldview. He believes no other U.S. president would pursue such a plan, as it lacks contemporary relevance.

**Did US give Greenland to Denmark after WW2? Fact-checking Trump's 'stupid' claim at Davos**
President Donald Trump claimed during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2026, that the United States gave Greenland back to Denmark after World War II, calling the decision 'stupid.' However, this claim is factually incorrect. Greenland was never American territory, so it could not have been 'given back.' Historical context shows that Denmark-Norway began colonizing Greenland in 1721, and after the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, Denmark retained control. Greenland became an integral part of Denmark in 1953, gained home rule in 1979, and further autonomy in 2009, with Denmark retaining responsibility for defense and foreign policy. During World War II, the U.S. signed the Defense of Greenland Agreement with Denmark in exile in 1941 and established military bases. In 1946, President Harry Truman offered $100 million to purchase Greenland, which Denmark rejected. Trump revived the idea in 2019, but Denmark again rejected the proposal, calling it 'absurd.' The U.S. has never owned Greenland, making Trump’s claim a misrepresentation of history.

**Letter to the editor: We've been trying to buy Greenland for over 150 years**
Cmdr. Wayne L. Johnson, U.S. Navy (retired), argues in a letter to the editor that President Trump's proposal to buy Greenland is neither new nor unreasonable, citing a long history of U.S. attempts to acquire the island. The first attempt occurred in 1867, the same year the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia. A second attempt took place in 1910, when the U.S. also sought to buy the Danish Virgin Islands, which Denmark sold for $25 million in gold in 1917—primarily for strategic naval reasons related to the Panama Canal. After Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, the U.S. occupied Greenland and did not withdraw until after the war ended, much to Denmark’s displeasure. The U.S. has maintained at least one military base in Greenland since then. In 1946, the U.S. secretly offered to buy Greenland, which Denmark rejected. Greenland has been under NATO protection since 1949. In 1955, the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed acquiring Greenland, and President Trump has made similar proposals during both of his presidencies. The letter emphasizes that the idea of acquiring Greenland has deep historical roots in U.S. foreign policy and strategic interests.

**Precedent for Greenland Acquisition? How the U.S. Once Bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark**
The article discusses the historical precedent for the United States purchasing territory from Denmark, drawing a parallel to Donald Trump's repeated calls to acquire Greenland. It notes that in 1917, during World War I, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson facilitated the purchase of the Danish West Indies—now the U.S. Virgin Islands—from Denmark for 25 million dollars (equivalent to about 550 million euros today). The deal was finalized after two failed attempts, driven by U.S. strategic concerns about German influence in the Caribbean. Denmark, facing financial hardship and geopolitical vulnerability, accepted the offer, with a referendum on the Danish mainland approving the sale, though island residents were not consulted. The article contrasts this historical transaction with current speculation that the U.S. might pay up to 700 billion dollars for Greenland, emphasizing Trump's argument that only U.S. ownership can protect Greenland from Russia and China. The piece underscores that Greenland remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, alongside Denmark proper and the Faroe Islands, and uses the 1917 deal as a potential model for future U.S.-Danish negotiations.

**100-Year-Old Déjà Vu: The U.S. and Its Endless Territorial Ambitions in Greenland and the Danish West Indies**
The article discusses the historical parallels between the United States' current pursuit of Greenland and its 1917 acquisition of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands). In 1917, the U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies for $25 million (approximately $600 million in today's value, or 880 billion KRW), following a complex negotiation process that included multiple failed attempts due to Senate rejection and Danish refusal to ratify, partly because local residents' referendums were not guaranteed. The U.S. renewed its interest during World War I due to strategic concerns over European powers occupying the region, especially after the Panama Canal's opening heightened the area's strategic importance. In a significant move, the U.S. pressured Denmark into signing a treaty on August 4, 1916, while simultaneously declaring that Denmark had no political or economic interest in Greenland, effectively securing Greenland's status in exchange for giving up the West Indies. After World War II, the U.S. recognized Greenland's strategic value and began seeking its acquisition. Former President Donald Trump, who had long expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, announced on January 17, 2026, that the U.S. would impose a 10% tariff on imports from eight European countries starting February 1, increasing to 25% by June 1, in response to their opposition to the Greenland acquisition. This date marked exactly 109 years since the U.S.-Denmark treaty for the West Indies was formally ratified.

**Trump's Greenland Purchase Plan: A History of U.S. Land Acquisitions**
Donald Trump has stated seriously that he intends to purchase Greenland, a claim that reflects a long-standing interest by the United States in acquiring territory from Denmark. Historical examples include the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France for $15 million, which encompassed over two million square kilometers; the 1819 acquisition of Florida from Spain, effectively a debt-for-land settlement involving compensation for damages caused by escaped slaves; the 1818 Jackson Purchase from an Indigenous people for $300,000; the 1848 acquisition of land from Mexico for approximately $15 million, including parts of present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, along with assumption of U.S. citizens’ debts to Mexico; and the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia for over $7 million. The U.S. also acquired the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million to secure strategic control of the Caribbean. Although no formal offer was made to buy Iceland from Denmark, the U.S. has again expressed interest in Greenland, citing national security as a key reason. The article notes that in 1946, the U.S. offered $100 million for Greenland, which was rejected by Denmark. The claim that the U.S. acquired nearly 40% of its current territory through purchases is supported by historical records.

**U.S. Interest in Purchasing Greenland: Historical Precedents and Legal Challenges**
The United States has historically expanded its territory through purchases and cessions, and under President Donald Trump, there has been renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, currently an autonomous territory of Denmark. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Trump is willing to buy Greenland, though he did not rule out military intervention. This interest dates back to the 19th century, with William H. Seward proposing the purchase of Greenland and Iceland after acquiring Alaska from Russia in 1867. In 1946, President Harry Truman offered $100 million to Denmark, which was rejected. Trump revived the idea during both his first and second terms, framing the acquisition as a national security necessity. Igor Lucena, a doctor in International Relations, noted that Trump’s push aligns with Republican Party political appeals. Experts such as Luís Alexandre Carta Winter from PUC-PR explained that international law permits the purchase or leasing of territory, citing existing U.S. leases in other countries. However, Denmark and Greenland have clearly stated that Greenland is not for sale. BBC experts assess that such a transaction would be extremely complex and unlikely, even with Greenland’s consent, due to the principle of self-determination, which requires approval from Greenland’s residents. Joseph Blocher of Duke University emphasized that any transfer must involve Greenland’s right to self-determination. Additionally, Congress would need to approve the purchase, requiring a two-thirds Senate majority—considered highly unlikely. The cost is estimated in billions or trillions of dollars, given Greenland’s vast, underexplored mineral resources and strategic value amid competition from Russia and China. The transaction would also require EU approval. Historical precedents include the Louisiana Purchase (1803, $15 million), the Florida Cession (1819, $5 million in debt settlement), the Mexican Cession (1848, $15 million + $3.2 million debt), the Alaska Purchase (1867, $7.2 million), and the Virgin Islands sale (1917, $25 million in gold). Other territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and Hawaii were acquired through war or annexation, not direct purchase.

**Background: The Purchase of Greenland – Legally Unfeasible**
The idea of the United States purchasing Greenland is legally and politically deemed impossible under international law, according to a legal analysis by Scott R. Anderson, former legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State. Although U.S. President Donald Trump previously expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, both Denmark—administratively responsible for the island—and Greenland’s autonomous government have rejected the proposal. Greenland, known as Kalaallit Nunaat by its indigenous population, has held substantial autonomy since 1979, expanded in 2009, and possesses the right to self-determination under international law, meaning Copenhagen cannot unilaterally sell the territory. While Denmark retains control over foreign and defense policy, Greenland remains financially dependent on Copenhagen. The 2009 Danish-Greenlandic agreement allows for a referendum on independence, subject to approval by the Danish parliament, though no compelling rationale exists for Greenland to align with the U.S. afterward. Historical attempts to purchase Greenland include a failed 1860s proposal, a $100 million offer post-World War II (unconfirmed), and rumored interest from Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in the 1970s. The U.S. has previously acquired large territories at low prices—Alaska (1867, $7.2M), Louisiana (1803, ~$11M), and Florida (1819, $5M)—but such transactions are not applicable to Greenland due to its self-determination rights.

**When Denmark sold territory to the US in 1917, long before today's Greenland debate**
The United States has a historical precedent for acquiring territory from Denmark, having purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917, which became the U.S. Virgin Islands. This past transaction is being referenced amid a renewed geopolitical debate over Greenland, where the U.S. has recently expressed renewed interest, prompting strong resistance from Denmark. Denmark, which is 0.44% the size of the U.S., maintains sovereignty over Greenland and has cited a 1952 Cold War-era military directive instructing its forces to 'shoot first, ask questions later' in the event of an incursion. Recent remarks by the U.S. President suggesting the possible use of force to seize Greenland have sparked concern across Europe, particularly given the existing U.S. military presence in Greenland.

**A Brief History of the US Trying (and Failing) to Buy Greenland**
The United States has attempted to purchase Greenland multiple times since the 1860s, beginning with President Andrew Johnson's administration and Secretary of State William H. Seward's efforts to acquire Greenland and Iceland from Denmark. Although Congress rejected the proposal, interest persisted through the 20th century. In 1910, US Ambassador Maurice Francis Egan proposed trading Mindanao (then a US territory) for Greenland and the Danish West Indies, though no formal offer was made. President Harry S. Truman made a serious but secret offer in the early Cold War era, proposing $100 million in gold for Greenland, which Denmark declined. Instead, the 1951 US-Denmark treaty granted the US extensive military access, including the right to construct, maintain, and operate bases—such as the current Pittufik Space Base—without requiring a formal transfer of sovereignty. Despite this, President Donald Trump has reignited the debate, calling Greenland a 'large real estate deal' and suggesting military force might be used to secure it. His statements have alarmed US allies, including Denmark, which warned that any military seizure would end NATO cooperation. However, the US already has near-unrestricted military presence in Greenland under existing treaties, and Greenlandic residents have consistently shown no interest in joining the US. The article concludes that Trump’s fixation may stem from his real estate background, but the geopolitical reality remains that Denmark and Greenland must consent to any sovereignty change, and the US currently enjoys de facto control without formal acquisition.

**The Times the United States Tried to Buy a Country – Il Post**
The article discusses the historical context and legal implications of the United States potentially purchasing Greenland, a topic recently revived by former U.S. President Donald Trump. While Trump has repeatedly proposed buying Greenland—drawing criticism from Greenlanders and Danish officials—the idea is legally and ethically contentious. Under international law, particularly the principle of self-determination enshrined in the UN Charter, Greenland’s residents, not the Danish government, hold the right to decide their political future. Polls indicate 85% of Greenlanders oppose the sale, 8% are undecided, and only 6% support it. The article notes that while territorial purchases were common in the 19th and early 20th centuries—such as the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the acquisition of Florida and parts of the Southeast from Spain (1819), the Mexican Cession (1848), Alaska from Russia (1867), and the U.S. purchase of the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917—such transactions are no longer compatible with modern international norms. The U.S. had previously attempted to buy Greenland in 1946, offering $100 million, but Denmark rejected the proposal. The article concludes that any such transaction today would be highly unlikely due to legal, political, and ethical barriers rooted in self-determination.

**The U.S. and Greenland: A Historical Precedent for Purchase and the Challenges of a Modern Annexation**
The article discusses the historical precedent of the United States purchasing territory from Denmark—the Virgin Islands in 1916—for $25 million in gold, with the U.S. explicitly affirming Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland in the treaty. This historical context is used to analyze Donald Trump’s recent interest in acquiring Greenland, a Danish territory. The article notes that while the U.S. has a long history of territorial acquisitions—including Louisiana, Florida, Alaska, and the Philippines—Greenland’s potential purchase would be vastly more expensive, with estimates ranging from $50 billion (based on per capita payment) to over $4 trillion (adjusted for land value). Polls indicate strong opposition among Greenlanders to U.S. annexation, with only 6% in favor, and the pro-annexation party securing just 1% of votes. The article emphasizes that any forced acquisition would be unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution, as only Congress can admit new territories. Despite this, Trump’s approach reflects a pattern of challenging legal and constitutional boundaries, as seen in his previous actions. The piece also highlights that the U.S. has previously used economic incentives and strategic military interests to expand its territory, but Greenland’s case presents unique political and legal hurdles.

### Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland
. Byrnes made the $100 million offer on 14 December 1946, in a memorandum delivered to Danish foreign minister Gustav Rasmussen when he visited the United States. The memorandum described the American position on what to do about the informal 1941 agreement made in 1941 by Kauffmann to station United States forces on Greenland. It suggested three alternatives: Two variations on the 1941 agreement—A 99-year lease on the existing American bases there, or the United States wholly taking over the defense of the island—or the purchase of Greenland. The United States preferred to purchase and believed that doing so was better for Denmark, as it would prevent criticism of American bases on Danish soil and save Denmark the cost of supporting Greenland. The American told the Dane that a sale "would be the most clean-cut and satisfactory". "Our needs ... seemed to come as a shock to Rasmussen", Byrnes said. The memorandum indeed surprised the Dane; rumors at the time stated that the United States wanted to purchase Greenland, but the Danish government's position was that the United States would withdraw its troops, based upon language in the 1941 Kauffmann agreement that it remained in force "until agreement has been reached that current threats to the peace and security of the American continent have ended". The Danish government understood that the threats were the world war; it did not know that the U.S. understood this to include postwar threats from the Soviet Union as well. Known as "Article X" of the Kauffmann agreement, the clause established that both sides would have to agree to ending it. Rasmussen declined all three options, and returned to Denmark. He told United States ambassador Josiah Marvel, "[w]hile we owe much to America I do not feel that we owe them the whole island of Greenland". The American offer surprised Rasmussen because of duplicity by Kauffmann, who with a friend at the United States Department of State advocated for an American presence in Greenland while not fully informing the Danish government. Kauffmann had minimized in his reports the importance of proposals of a takeover or purchase in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that the idea was considered ridiculous by the U.S. government, when in fact it was not. He had also not conveyed important parts of a 1945 American proposal to keep its bases on the island after the war

Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland

. Rasmussen visited Washington in 1946 expecting to annul the 1941 agreement, not understanding because of Kauffmann's duplicity why nothing had happened with the Danish government's previous overtures in that regard. Reporting on the United States military's interest in purchasing it, Time in January 1947 stated that Lansing had erred in relinquishing the American claim to "the world's largest island and stationary aircraft carrier". The magazine predicted that Greenland "would be as valuable as Alaska during the next few years" for defense. Time observed that despite national pride "Denmark owes U.S. investors $70 million" while the country had a shortage of dollars, and rumors in Copenhagen stated that the price for the island would be $1 billion ($11 billion today), or almost four times Denmark's aid from the Marshall Plan. Selling Greenland might have made a return to Denmark's traditional neutrality easier, and would have provided funds the country greatly needed after the war. All Danish political parties rejected selling the island when they heard the rumors, however. Jens Sønderup said in a 1947 budget debate: There have been rumours in the newspapers about America wishing to acquire Greenland. King Dollar is, so to speak, about to become a major factor in all areas. I am not aware of any approach concerning the purchase of Greenland, but assume that it is a given that we will not embark on anything in that respect. Should the Greenlanders desire another relationship or secession, that would be another matter, but in this respect there can be no question of any form of financial transaction. Rasmussen responded in the debate that the idea was absurd, and declared Denmark unwilling in any way to cede sovereignty over Greenland. The West Indies were only an investment to Danes, but from the Danish Golden Age of the 19th century they saw Danish overseas colonies in the North Atlantic, including Greenland, as part of their Viking history and national identity. The island was for Denmark similar to the British Raj for the United Kingdom, and Danes felt a paternalistic, "White Man's Burden"-like responsibility for its people. While Greenland did not contribute to the Danish economy, Denmark planned to expand trade and resource extraction there. By offering to purchase Greenland, the United States told Denmark that it was not likely to ever leave. Denmark would not fully understand for another decade the island's strategic importance to the United States

Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland

. The Danish government's own outlook on national security was more parochial, and did not extend to viewing Greenland as a part of that. The legal status of the 1941 arrangement was unsettled, with the United States still pressing for purchase and Denmark rejecting the offer, leaving matters at the status quo ante until the 1960s. After the November 1947 Danish Folketing election, the new government of Hans Hedtoft continued and expanded Kauffmann's strategy of duplicity. To the Danish public, it maintained that the United States would withdraw from Greenland as expected. To the United States the Hedtoft government stated that its own private position was that the American presence would remain. Its own private position was to persuade the United States to withdraw. Kauffmann likewise continued with his own personal agenda. The Danish government was not duplicitous on one point: It was not going to outright cede Greenland to a foreign power. Marvel told Rasmussen that he should not do anything that would lead to the disclosure of anything that had transpired in Rasmussen's meeting with Byrnes. The Danish government kept the American interest secret from the public, as part of its own strategy. The 1947 offer was classified until the 1970s, and Jyllands-Posten reported on it in 1991. A scholar wrote in 1950 that, despite official denials of the rumors of an American purchase, because of Greenland's large expense to Denmark and strategic importance, "the potential sale of the island to the United States remains a distinct possibility". Postwar Denmark was not able to defend Greenland, an ice-covered island 50 times larger than itself. In April 1951 Denmark and the United States signed the Greenland Defense Agreement. Replacing the 1941 agreement, it allows the latter country to keep its military bases in Greenland, and to establish new bases or "defense areas" if deemed necessary by NATO. The American military can freely use and move between these defense areas, but cannot infringe upon Danish sovereignty in Greenland. The agreement remains in force as long as the NATO treaty does. Denmark recognized that without the agreement Greenland would become closer to the United States anyway, whether as a nominally independent country or with a Puerto Rico-like affiliation. The Pentagon told president Dwight Eisenhower that the Danes were "very cooperative in allowing the United States quite a free hand in Greenland"

### Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland
Since the 19th century, the United States has considered, and made, several attempts to purchase the island of Greenland from Denmark, as it did with the Danish West Indies in 1917. There were notable internal discussions within the U.S. federal government about acquiring Greenland in 1867, 1910, 1946, 1955, 2019, and 2025, and acquisition has been advocated by American secretaries of state William H. Seward and James F. Byrnes, privately by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, and publicly by President Donald Trump, among others. After World War II, the United States secretly offered to buy Greenland; there was public discussion about purchasing the island during Trump's first term in 2019 and again after Trump's 2024 reelection, as part of his American expansionism policy. In May 2025, Trump stated that he could not rule out a U.S. annexation of the island. While Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenlandic and Danish authorities have publicly asserted Greenland's right to self-determination and stated that Greenland is "not for sale". Many Greenlanders support independence, and many Danes see the historical ties with Greenland as an integral part of Danish national identity. The United States has long viewed Greenland as vital to national security. In the early 20th century, it included Greenland among several European possessions in the Western Hemisphere to preemptively seize and fortify in the event of a threatened attack on the US. During World War II, the US invoked its Monroe Doctrine and occupied Greenland to prevent use by Germany following the German occupation of Denmark. The US military remained in Greenland after the war, and by 1948, Denmark abandoned attempts to persuade the US to leave. The following year, both countries became members of the NATO military alliance. A 1951 treaty gave the US a significant role in Greenland's defense, and, about 1953, construction began on Thule military base, now known as Pituffik Space Base, located in northwest Greenland. The US military frequently takes part in NATO exercises in Greenlandic waters.

. The potential loss of Pituffik Space Base following the independence of Greenland would leave the United States with no redundancy and, according to SpaceNews, "have serious consequences for both a future conflict and business as usual in orbit". On 9 January 2025 U.S. Rep. Mike Haridopolos issued a statement supporting U.S. acquisition of Greenland on grounds of space security, commenting "it's a critical part of ensuring our nation's security now and in the future ... America cannot afford to cede an inch in space or the Arctic". Earlier, in July 2024, United States Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Carden—commenting on the deployment of military space assets—described the Arctic as "the shortest and least defended threat vector to North America". In addition to again permanently basing USAF fighters and bombers on Greenland, the United States might station long-range missiles there, similar to its plans in western Europe. The United States may gain access to vast amounts of natural resources including petroleum and rare minerals. The United States Geological Survey estimates 17.5 billion barrels of offshore crude oil and 4.19 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. The island has the largest deposits of rare-earth elements outside China. Two thirds of the planet's fresh water outside Antarctica are frozen in Greenland, and its rock flour has unusually strong ability for soil regeneration and direct air capture of carbon. Experts predict that 5% of global shipping could use Arctic shipping routes by 2050. Climate change may, by 2030, make the Northern Sea Route the first of the routes to be ice-free, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and making Greenland's resources more accessible. The Northwest Passage is 4,300 miles (6,900 km) or four days shorter from the US east coast to Asia, and US west coast to Europe, than the Panama Canal; such routes are three fifths of traffic through the canal. The first commercial ship traversed the passage in 2013, saving $200,000; ten did so in 2024, and the passage may be open four months of the year by the end of the 21st century. Impressed by the size of the island, Trump stated, "Look at the size of this. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States." Speaking with his security advisor he expressed thoughts that its acquisition would be a great real estate deal

Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland

. If Greenland became part of the United States, the U.S. would become the second-largest country in the world by area, after Russia (displacing Canada). It would be the largest territorial acquisition in American history, slightly larger than the Louisiana Purchase. Paleo-Eskimo peoples had been living in Greenland periodically from around 2500 BC. Norsemen began settling the uninhabited southern part of Greenland from the 10th century AD. In 1261, the Norse settlements in southern Greenland accepted Norwegian overlordship. These colonies died out in the 1400s, but Norway's territorial claims to Greenland continued to be asserted by Denmark–Norway after the union of the Danish and Norwegian realms in 1537. Beginning in 1721, missionaries and traders from Denmark–Norway began recolonizing southern Greenland. In 1775, Denmark–Norway declared Greenland a colony. When Denmark and Norway separated in 1814, Greenland was kept by Denmark under the Treaty of Kiel. Denmark began trying to colonize all of Greenland in the 1880s, and declared sovereignty over the whole island in 1921. The United States could have challenged Denmark's claim to Greenland. Much of northern Greenland had not been mapped when the Kiel treaty was signed in 1814. During the Polaris Expedition of the early 1870s, American Charles Francis Hall was the first outsider to see northwest Greenland, decades before Denmark's first permanent settlement in the northwest in 1909. From 1886 to 1909, American Robert Peary was the first outsider to explore far northern Greenland and claimed much of the area for the United States. Despite the Treaty of Kiel, Norway had long used the east coast of the island and objected to the 1921 Danish declaration. It stated that a 1924 agreement between the two countries did not endorse Danish sovereignty over the whole island, and in 1931 claimed eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land. A 1933 International Court of Justice ruling recognized Danish sovereignty over the whole island. Norway abided by this ruling, though briefly renewed its claim during the Quisling regime in the 1940s. In 1867, United States secretary of state William H. Seward negotiated the Alaska Purchase from the Russian Empire. He that year considered the idea of United States annexation of both Greenland and Iceland an idea "worthy of serious consideration". Robert J

. Walker, like Seward an advocate of American expansionism, submitted to Seward a report by the United States Coast Survey that the secretary of state had requested on the two islands. The government published the report (A Report on the Resources of Iceland and Greenland, Peirce 1868). Seward wanted to encourage Americans to support a potential purchase offer, so the report very positively described Greenland's "unusual healthfulness" and large amounts of fish, game, and minerals. Annexation would also encourage Canada—between American territory to the east and west—to join the United States, the report predicted. In 1868 negotiations by the secretary for purchasing both Greenland and Iceland from Denmark for $5.5 million in gold were reportedly "nearly complete" but Seward made no offer, probably because Congress did not approve a treaty to acquire the Danish West Indies. President Andrew Johnson was very unpopular with Republicans in Congress, and although Seward was also a Republican, his association with Johnson made passing his proposals unlikely. A proposal for acquisition of Greenland was discussed within the American government in 1910 by United States ambassador to Denmark Maurice Francis Egan. As suggested by Danish "persons of importance" who were friends of Egan, the United States would trade Mindanao and Palawan for Greenland and the Danish West Indies; Denmark could then trade Mindanao and Palawan to Germany for Northern Schleswig. Denmark regained Northern Schleswig from Germany after the German defeat in World War I following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites.

. Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States, which were renamed the United States Virgin Islands and made an unincorporated territory of the United States. After the treaty, Lansing issued a declaration affirming the U.S. "will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland". John Douglas Hazen proposed at the Imperial War Conference that the British Empire buy Greenland for Canada to prevent the United States from acquiring it. The Imperial War Cabinet in 1917 declared that even a friendly nation obtaining Greenland would be undesirable to the empire and especially to Canada, and that the empire should obtain a right of first refusal for the island from Denmark when possible. According to Tom Høyem, Britain in 1917 secured a right of first refusal from Denmark, although it is unclear "if Høyem’s interpretation of the document could withstand legal scrutiny". Since 1823 the United States has, in the Monroe Doctrine, opposed expansion of foreign sovereignty in the Americas. Lansing's declaration was an exception to the doctrine, and influenced other countries. In 1919, Denmark asked other nations to recognize its sovereignty over Greenland. Britain reiterated on behalf of Canada in September 1920 that it should be consulted before any sale; France, Japan, Italy, and Sweden had no reservations. The United States formally opposed the reservation, telling Britain that "The United States government is not disposed to recognize the existence in a third government of a right of pre-emption to acquire this territory if the Danish Government should desire to dispose of it and accordingly reserves for the future consideration what position it may take in the event of a specific proposal for such a transfer". Denmark formally declared sovereignty over all of Greenland in 1921. Norway renewed a claim to Erik the Red's Land in 1931, but two years later the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled against the country, finding that the claim had been transferred to Denmark in 1814. Peary encouraged the United States to assert its claim to Greenland, believing that not doing so violated the Monroe Doctrine. He wanted to purchase the island for mineral wealth and to avoid foreign bases that would, as air and sea technology improved, threaten his country. During World War I, the United States decided that obtaining the Danish West Indies to defend the Panama Canal was more important, but in the 1920s General Billy Mitchell, advocating for expanding American air forces, wanted American bases on Greenland and Iceland

. In 1939, United States secretary of state Cordell Hull's staff advised him not to offer to buy Greenland. United States secretary of war Harry Woodring said that the island was too far from American sea or air routes. Within one year, however, the German invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940 showed the American government that Peary had been correct about Greenland's importance to the Arctic policy of the United States. Before World War II, the island was part of Rainbow 4, a contingency plan to deal with a siege of North America in which the United States was simultaneously attacked from every direction by every great power. In Rainbow 4, American forces would preemptively seize all Dutch, Danish, and French possessions in the western hemisphere—including Greenland—and garrison them to form a defensive perimeter around the United States. Its conquest of Denmark now gave Germany a strong legal claim to Greenland. Britain and Canada were also possible foreign occupiers. Because of its proximity to mainland North America and being the only known significant source of cryolite, and German attempts to use the island during the North Atlantic weather war, the United States for the first time applied the Monroe Doctrine on European colonies in the North Atlantic Ocean. The US landed armed United States Coast Guard personnel from USCGC Northland (WPG-49) in Greenland to begin the occupation of Greenland. Prior to landing, the Coast Guardsmen were formally discharged from service and reconstituted as a force of "volunteers" to create a legal fiction that would avoid charges of an American invasion of the country, the United States being neutral and the Danish government not having agreed to the landing. On 9 April 1941 Hull and Danish Ambassador to the United States Henrik Kauffmann signed the "Agreement Relating to the Defense of Greenland". The American stated that defending Greenland was consistent with the Monroe Doctrine and Act of Havana of 1940. The United States Army began construction of Bluie West One in July 1941, the first of several bases. Kauffmann acted without the consent of his government, which considered the agreement to be void and recalled Kauffmann. He stayed in the United States, and after the war the Danish government again recognized "the good traitor" as ambassador to the country. At the end of the war, Denmark expected U.S. forces to exit Greenland and was taken by surprise when the United States indicated it had no intention of leaving

### Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland
Since the 19th century, the United States has considered, and made, several attempts to purchase the island of Greenland from Denmark, as it did with the Danish West Indies in 1917. There were notable internal discussions within the U.S. federal government about acquiring Greenland in 1867, 1910, 1946, 1955, 2019, and 2025, and acquisition has been advocated by American secretaries of state William H. Seward and James F. Byrnes, privately by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, and publicly by President Donald Trump, among others. After World War II, the United States secretly offered to buy Greenland; there was public discussion about purchasing the island during Trump's first term in 2019 and again after Trump's 2024 reelection, as part of his American expansionism policy. In May 2025, Trump stated that he could not rule out a U.S. annexation of the island. While Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenlandic and Danish authorities have publicly asserted Greenland's right to self-determination and stated that Greenland is "not for sale". Many Greenlanders support independence, and many Danes see the historical ties with Greenland as an integral part of Danish national identity. The United States has long viewed Greenland as vital to national security. In the early 20th century, it included Greenland among several European possessions in the Western Hemisphere to preemptively seize and fortify in the event of a threatened attack on the US. During World War II, the US invoked its Monroe Doctrine and occupied Greenland to prevent use by Germany following the German occupation of Denmark. The US military remained in Greenland after the war, and by 1948, Denmark abandoned attempts to persuade the US to leave. The following year, both countries became members of the NATO military alliance. A 1951 treaty gave the US a significant role in Greenland's defense, and, about 1953, construction began on Thule military base, now known as Pituffik Space Base, located in northwest Greenland. The US military frequently takes part in NATO exercises in Greenlandic waters.

. (2) In case of such decision pursuant to subsection 1, negotiations are initiated between the government and Naalakkersuisut for the purpose of implementing independence for Greenland. (3) An agreement between Naalakkersuisut and the government on the implementation of independence for Greenland shall be made with the consent of Inatsisartut and shall be approved by a referendum in Greenland. Any agreement shall in addition be with the consent of the Danish Parliament. (4) Independence for Greenland entails, that Greenland assumes sovereignty over Greenland. Lov om Grønlands Selvstyre, 12 June 2009. https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2009/473 Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. In 1953 Denmark formally added what was then its colony to the kingdom. The Greenlandic government has authority over Greenland's internal affairs such as the economy, social services, and infrastructure, while Denmark is responsible for the island's foreign affairs, defense, citizenship, currency, and monetary policy. The Danish Supreme Court is the final court of appeal. Under Danish law, Greenlandic independence is possible at any time based on the Self-Government Act of 2009, after a referendum in Greenland and approval by the Danish parliament. Others question this, arguing that an amendment of the Danish Constitution is required. Denmark has sovereignty over Greenland; private land ownership does not exist. Any agreement to allow for independence would transfer sovereignty from Denmark. The Greenlandic government declared in February 2024 that independence is its goal, and independence is expected to be the most important issue at the April 2025 Greenlandic general election. Due to its status as a former colony, some commentators have argued that under international law Greenland has, separate from the 2009 law, right of self-determination and could make a unilateral declaration of independence. The position of the Danish government is that it is up to Greenland to decide its own future, and that Denmark would respect a Greenlandic referendum on independence. The Danish government reluctantly agreed in 2017 to finance two new airports, replacing potential Chinese investors, even though the investments sought by the island are viewed as preparing for independence. Greenland gives Denmark a role in the Arctic; it is a member of the Arctic Council and as one of the five Arctic littoral states, a signatory to the Ilulissat Declaration

. Over the next several years, Danish officials attempted, unsuccessfully, to convince the United States to leave the island. According to Jeroen van Dongen, a period of tension between the two countries followed as, despite its desires, "Denmark was clearly not in a position to force the USA to leave Greenland" nor did it have any means at its disposal to deny the U.S. access to the territory. By spring 1948 Denmark gave up on persuading the Americans to leave. Part of why the country joined NATO, Trade Minister Jens Otto Krag wrote in his diary, was that since "the USA's de facto partial occupation of Greenland (which we do not possess the power to prevent)" would cause the Soviet Union to see his country as an American ally, Denmark should benefit from the relationship. Some Danes hoped that as a NATO member the United States would discuss Greenlandic issues multilaterally, or vacate the bases as Denmark was an ally, but such did not occur. In 1946 the Joint Chiefs of Staff listed Greenland and Iceland as two of the three essential international locations for American bases. During the creation of NATO, the two islands were seen as more important to American and Canadian defense than some Western European countries; Greenland is on the shortest polar route between Washington and Moscow, and about midway between the two cities. In 1946, the United States offered Denmark $100 million ($1 billion today) in gold bullion for Greenland. United States senator Owen Brewster said in November 1945 that he considered buying the island "a military necessity". The planning and strategy committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined in April 1946 that acquiring the "completely worthless to Denmark" island was vital to the United States. William C. Trimble of the State Department argued that while "there are few people in Denmark who have any real interest in Greenland, economic, political or financial", owning it would give the United States staging areas from which to launch military operations over the Arctic against America's adversaries. He suggested the $100 million price, and discussed an alternate offer of land in Point Barrow, Alaska. Had the Alaska trade occurred, from 1967 Denmark would have benefited from Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the richest petroleum discovery in American history. Secretary of State James F

. Byrnes made the $100 million offer on 14 December 1946, in a memorandum delivered to Danish foreign minister Gustav Rasmussen when he visited the United States. The memorandum described the American position on what to do about the informal 1941 agreement made in 1941 by Kauffmann to station United States forces on Greenland. It suggested three alternatives: Two variations on the 1941 agreement—A 99-year lease on the existing American bases there, or the United States wholly taking over the defense of the island—or the purchase of Greenland. The United States preferred to purchase and believed that doing so was better for Denmark, as it would prevent criticism of American bases on Danish soil and save Denmark the cost of supporting Greenland. The American told the Dane that a sale "would be the most clean-cut and satisfactory". "Our needs ... seemed to come as a shock to Rasmussen", Byrnes said. The memorandum indeed surprised the Dane; rumors at the time stated that the United States wanted to purchase Greenland, but the Danish government's position was that the United States would withdraw its troops, based upon language in the 1941 Kauffmann agreement that it remained in force "until agreement has been reached that current threats to the peace and security of the American continent have ended". The Danish government understood that the threats were the world war; it did not know that the U.S. understood this to include postwar threats from the Soviet Union as well. Known as "Article X" of the Kauffmann agreement, the clause established that both sides would have to agree to ending it. Rasmussen declined all three options, and returned to Denmark. He told United States ambassador Josiah Marvel, "[w]hile we owe much to America I do not feel that we owe them the whole island of Greenland". The American offer surprised Rasmussen because of duplicity by Kauffmann, who with a friend at the United States Department of State advocated for an American presence in Greenland while not fully informing the Danish government. Kauffmann had minimized in his reports the importance of proposals of a takeover or purchase in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that the idea was considered ridiculous by the U.S. government, when in fact it was not. He had also not conveyed important parts of a 1945 American proposal to keep its bases on the island after the war

### Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland
. If Greenland became part of the United States, the U.S. would become the second-largest country in the world by area, after Russia (displacing Canada). It would be the largest territorial acquisition in American history, slightly larger than the Louisiana Purchase. Paleo-Eskimo peoples had been living in Greenland periodically from around 2500 BC. Norsemen began settling the uninhabited southern part of Greenland from the 10th century AD. In 1261, the Norse settlements in southern Greenland accepted Norwegian overlordship. These colonies died out in the 1400s, but Norway's territorial claims to Greenland continued to be asserted by Denmark–Norway after the union of the Danish and Norwegian realms in 1537. Beginning in 1721, missionaries and traders from Denmark–Norway began recolonizing southern Greenland. In 1775, Denmark–Norway declared Greenland a colony. When Denmark and Norway separated in 1814, Greenland was kept by Denmark under the Treaty of Kiel. Denmark began trying to colonize all of Greenland in the 1880s, and declared sovereignty over the whole island in 1921. The United States could have challenged Denmark's claim to Greenland. Much of northern Greenland had not been mapped when the Kiel treaty was signed in 1814. During the Polaris Expedition of the early 1870s, American Charles Francis Hall was the first outsider to see northwest Greenland, decades before Denmark's first permanent settlement in the northwest in 1909. From 1886 to 1909, American Robert Peary was the first outsider to explore far northern Greenland and claimed much of the area for the United States. Despite the Treaty of Kiel, Norway had long used the east coast of the island and objected to the 1921 Danish declaration. It stated that a 1924 agreement between the two countries did not endorse Danish sovereignty over the whole island, and in 1931 claimed eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land. A 1933 International Court of Justice ruling recognized Danish sovereignty over the whole island. Norway abided by this ruling, though briefly renewed its claim during the Quisling regime in the 1940s. In 1867, United States secretary of state William H. Seward negotiated the Alaska Purchase from the Russian Empire. He that year considered the idea of United States annexation of both Greenland and Iceland an idea "worthy of serious consideration". Robert J

. Walker, like Seward an advocate of American expansionism, submitted to Seward a report by the United States Coast Survey that the secretary of state had requested on the two islands. The government published the report (A Report on the Resources of Iceland and Greenland, Peirce 1868). Seward wanted to encourage Americans to support a potential purchase offer, so the report very positively described Greenland's "unusual healthfulness" and large amounts of fish, game, and minerals. Annexation would also encourage Canada—between American territory to the east and west—to join the United States, the report predicted. In 1868 negotiations by the secretary for purchasing both Greenland and Iceland from Denmark for $5.5 million in gold were reportedly "nearly complete" but Seward made no offer, probably because Congress did not approve a treaty to acquire the Danish West Indies. President Andrew Johnson was very unpopular with Republicans in Congress, and although Seward was also a Republican, his association with Johnson made passing his proposals unlikely. A proposal for acquisition of Greenland was discussed within the American government in 1910 by United States ambassador to Denmark Maurice Francis Egan. As suggested by Danish "persons of importance" who were friends of Egan, the United States would trade Mindanao and Palawan for Greenland and the Danish West Indies; Denmark could then trade Mindanao and Palawan to Germany for Northern Schleswig. Denmark regained Northern Schleswig from Germany after the German defeat in World War I following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites. Appendix to the Treaty of the Danish West Indies "... the undersigned Secretary of State of the United States of America, duly authorized by his Government, has the honor to declare that the Government of the United States of America will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland". Robert Lansing, signed at New York, 4 August 1916, Another American attempt to buy the Danish West Indies failed in 1902, this time because the Danish parliament did not pass the treaty. During the First World War, the United States again wanted to buy the Danish West Indies. Denmark wanted the United States to recognize the Danish claim over the whole of Greenland. United States secretary of state Robert Lansing proposed that the two issues be combined

Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland

. Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States, which were renamed the United States Virgin Islands and made an unincorporated territory of the United States. After the treaty, Lansing issued a declaration affirming the U.S. "will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland". John Douglas Hazen proposed at the Imperial War Conference that the British Empire buy Greenland for Canada to prevent the United States from acquiring it. The Imperial War Cabinet in 1917 declared that even a friendly nation obtaining Greenland would be undesirable to the empire and especially to Canada, and that the empire should obtain a right of first refusal for the island from Denmark when possible. According to Tom Høyem, Britain in 1917 secured a right of first refusal from Denmark, although it is unclear "if Høyem’s interpretation of the document could withstand legal scrutiny". Since 1823 the United States has, in the Monroe Doctrine, opposed expansion of foreign sovereignty in the Americas. Lansing's declaration was an exception to the doctrine, and influenced other countries. In 1919, Denmark asked other nations to recognize its sovereignty over Greenland. Britain reiterated on behalf of Canada in September 1920 that it should be consulted before any sale; France, Japan, Italy, and Sweden had no reservations. The United States formally opposed the reservation, telling Britain that "The United States government is not disposed to recognize the existence in a third government of a right of pre-emption to acquire this territory if the Danish Government should desire to dispose of it and accordingly reserves for the future consideration what position it may take in the event of a specific proposal for such a transfer". Denmark formally declared sovereignty over all of Greenland in 1921. Norway renewed a claim to Erik the Red's Land in 1931, but two years later the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled against the country, finding that the claim had been transferred to Denmark in 1814. Peary encouraged the United States to assert its claim to Greenland, believing that not doing so violated the Monroe Doctrine. He wanted to purchase the island for mineral wealth and to avoid foreign bases that would, as air and sea technology improved, threaten his country. During World War I, the United States decided that obtaining the Danish West Indies to defend the Panama Canal was more important, but in the 1920s General Billy Mitchell, advocating for expanding American air forces, wanted American bases on Greenland and Iceland
