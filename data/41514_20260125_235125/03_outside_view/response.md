# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Before May 1, 2026, will the United States offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark?

## Description
Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. There have been historical instances of the United States expressing interest in purchasing Greenland, but no formal offer has been made in recent decades.

## Resolution Criteria
The United States must make a formal, public offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026 for this question to resolve as "Yes".

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The historical record of the United States attempting to purchase Greenland is relatively well-documented, with several notable instances in the 20th century. However, the data is limited, as there have been no recent formal offers to purchase Greenland. The available information is primarily from news reports and historical accounts, which may have some biases.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Historical attempts by the US to purchase Greenland**
- Historical base rate: 3 attempts (1867, 1946, 1951)
- Sample size: 3 events
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: This is the most directly relevant reference class, as it looks at the historical precedent of the US attempting to purchase Greenland.

**Reference Class 2: Territorial purchases by the United States**
- Historical base rate: 9 successful purchases (Alaska, Florida, Louisiana Purchase, etc.)
- Sample size: 9 events
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: While not directly related to Greenland, this reference class looks at the broader history of the US purchasing territories, which could provide some insight into the likelihood of a Greenland purchase.

**Reference Class 3: Territorial disputes between countries**
- Historical base rate: Difficult to determine a precise base rate, as territorial disputes can have varying outcomes.
- Sample size: N/A
- Suitability score (1-10): 4
- Why this reference class: This reference class is less directly relevant, as it does not specifically address the US purchasing Greenland. However, it could provide some general context on how countries handle territorial disputes.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation
Not applicable, as we have direct reference classes to work with.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration
Weighting the reference classes by suitability:
1. Historical attempts by the US to purchase Greenland: 80% weight
2. Territorial purchases by the United States: 20% weight
3. Territorial disputes between countries: 0% weight (low suitability)

Integrated base rate = (0.8 * 0.33) + (0.2 * 0.18) = 0.264 or 26.4%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment
Confidence level: 7
The historical record of the US attempting to purchase Greenland provides a relatively strong foundation for the base rate, though the limited sample size and lack of recent attempts introduce some uncertainty. The broader context of US territorial purchases adds some additional insight, but is less directly relevant.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 26.4%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. Historical attempts by the US to purchase Greenland: 33% base rate (weight: 80%)
2. Territorial purchases by the United States: 18% base rate (weight: 20%)
3. Territorial disputes between countries: N/A (weight: 0%)

**Confidence Level:** 7

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Limited sample size of historical attempts to purchase Greenland
- Lack of recent attempts, making it difficult to assess current geopolitical context
- Potential for unexpected factors or events that could influence a potential Greenland purchase
