## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on the latest diplomatic developments as of January 25, 2026 [1][2][3][4][5], the **United States will not offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026**. Here's why:  

1. **Sovereignty is Non-Negotiable**: Denmark has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected any sale of Greenland, calling sovereignty a "red line" [5][9][11][12][18]. The US has acknowledged this stance after failed pressure tactics (tariffs/military threats) [1][6][7].  

2. **Shift to Security-Only Talks**: Current discussions exclusively involve NATO-led Arctic security cooperation, with Denmark explicitly stating negotiations are "about security, security, and security"—not sovereignty transfer [2][3][4]. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed no military intervention plans [19][20].  

3. **Timeline Constraints**: With only 3 months until May 1, 2026:  
   - No formal purchase framework exists [12][18].  
   - Trust is severely eroded, with European diplomats calling the US "our former ally" [1].  
   - Denmark/Greenland are fortifying military defenses to deter US ambitions [8][13][18].  

4. **Broader Consensus Against Sale**:  
   - The EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's leadership oppose a transfer [5][13][18].  
   - Even Greenland's pro-independence factions reject becoming a US territory [16].  

**Limitations**: While the US interest persists [9][14][20], the decisive diplomatic pivot toward security-only cooperation—coupled with Denmark's uncompromising sovereignty stance—makes a formal purchase offer before May 1, 2026 highly improbable. Should US intentions resurface, Denmark's EU-backed resolve and Greenland's autonomous opposition remain significant barriers.

**The Danish Sale of the Virgin Islands: A Historical Precedent for the Greenland Debate**
The renewed tension between the United States and Denmark over Donald Trump's proposal to acquire Greenland has brought attention to a lesser-known historical precedent: Denmark's sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in 1917. The islands, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands, were ceded by Denmark for 25 million gold dollars after decades of economic decline following the abolition of slavery in 1848. Once a lucrative sugar-producing colony reliant on enslaved labor, the territory became a financial burden. During World War I, the U.S. pressured Denmark—neutrally aligned at the time—by threatening invasion if the sale did not proceed, with historian Astrid Andersen noting, 'There are echoes of what we hear today about Greenland, because what the U.S. said was: "Either you sell it to us or we'll invade."' The U.S. officially took control in 1917, and today the islands remain a U.S. unincorporated territory with U.S. citizenship for residents but no voting rights in presidential elections. This historical transaction underscores that Denmark has previously sacrificed strategic territories under geopolitical and economic pressure, making the current Greenland debate a recurring geopolitical theme.

**They Tried Several Times: How the U.S. Attempted to Buy Greenland**
The United States attempted multiple times to purchase Greenland from Denmark, with historical efforts dating back to 1867, when the deal nearly succeeded but ultimately failed. In 1910, the U.S. proposed a territorial exchange: two Philippine islands for Greenland and Danish West Indies, but the plan was deemed too complex. Instead, the U.S. acquired the Danish West Indies, which are now the U.S. Virgin Islands. During World War II, the Danish ambassador in Washington transferred control of Greenland to the U.S. due to strategic concerns. The U.S. later offered a substantial sum to purchase Greenland, but the deal did not materialize. The article, reported by RT correspondent Charlotte Dubenski, details these historical attempts at acquisition.

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence provided is relatively recent, with the most relevant information being from January 2026, just a few months before the resolution date. The sources appear to be credible, with the first article from a reputable Spanish news outlet and the second from the Russian state-owned RT news agency. While RT may have some pro-Russian bias, the content seems factual and focused on historical details rather than political commentary.

The information on past US attempts to purchase Greenland is already priced into the base rate of 26.4%, so that does not require a major update. However, the details on the current diplomatic situation and Denmark's firm stance against any sale are new and relevant evidence that should be incorporated.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Denmark has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected any sale of Greenland, calling sovereignty a "red line" [5][9][11][12][18].
- Current discussions exclusively involve NATO-led Arctic security cooperation, with Denmark explicitly stating negotiations are "about security, security, and security"—not sovereignty transfer [2][3][4].

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- With only 3 months until May 1, 2026, no formal purchase framework exists [12][18], and trust is severely eroded, with European diplomats calling the US "our former ally" [1].
- Denmark and Greenland are fortifying military defenses to deter US ambitions [8][13][18].
- The EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's leadership oppose a transfer [5][13][18], and even Greenland's pro-independence factions reject becoming a US territory [16].

**WEAK Evidence:**
- The US interest in purchasing Greenland persists [9][14][20], despite the diplomatic pivot toward security-only cooperation.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence:**
- The uncompromising Danish stance on Greenland's sovereignty pushes the probability DOWN by approximately 20 percentage points.
- The shift in discussions to focus solely on security cooperation, rather than a potential purchase, pushes the probability DOWN by approximately 15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The lack of a formal purchase framework, eroded trust, and defensive measures by Denmark and Greenland push the probability DOWN by approximately 10 percentage points.
- The broad opposition to a transfer from the EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's leadership pushes the probability DOWN by approximately 5 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- The persistent US interest in purchasing Greenland has a negligible impact on the probability, as it is already accounted for in the base rate.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 26.4%:
- Adjustment 1: -20% for Denmark's uncompromising sovereignty stance
- Adjustment 2: -15% for the shift to security-only cooperation
- Adjustment 3: -10% for the lack of a formal framework, eroded trust, and defensive measures
- Adjustment 4: -5% for the broad opposition to a transfer
- Cumulative adjustment: -50%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is correct, it would mean that the US has completely abandoned its long-standing interest in purchasing Greenland, despite the strategic importance of the Arctic region. This would require a significant shift in US foreign policy and a complete breakdown in US-Denmark relations, which seems plausible given the current evidence.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 26.4% is already relatively low, and the cumulative adjustment of -50% is justified by the strong and consistent evidence against a purchase offer before the resolution date.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (Denmark's stance and the shift to security-only talks) leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the substantial evidence against a purchase offer, I do not believe there is a strong tendency for the prediction to regress towards the mean. The evidence points firmly in the direction of a negative outcome.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the likelihood of the United States offering to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026. The key factors that lead me to conclude the US will not make such an offer are:

1. Denmark's uncompromising stance on Greenland's sovereignty, which they have repeatedly and firmly stated is a "red line" that will not be crossed. This strong and consistent position from the Danish government is a significant barrier to any potential purchase.

2. The shift in the US-Denmark negotiations to focus exclusively on Arctic security cooperation, with Denmark explicitly stating that the discussions are "about security, security, and security," rather than a potential transfer of sovereignty. This diplomatic pivot away from a purchase offer is a clear indication of the lack of US intent to pursue this course of action.

3. The timeline constraints, with only 3 months remaining until the resolution date. The lack of a formal purchase framework, the severely eroded trust between the US and its European allies, and the defensive measures being taken by Denmark and Greenland to deter US ambitions make it highly unlikely that a formal offer will materialize in the short time remaining.

4. The broad consensus against a transfer of Greenland, with the EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's own leadership all opposing such a move. Even Greenland's pro-independence factions have rejected the idea of becoming a US territory, further undermining the potential for a successful purchase.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Denmark's uncompromising sovereignty stance, shift to security-only cooperation
- Moderate evidence pointing DOWN: Lack of formal framework, eroded trust, defensive measures, broad opposition to transfer
- Net direction: DOWN

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 26.4%
- Total adjustment: -50%
- Final estimate: 13.2%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 9/10

**Probability: 13.2%**
