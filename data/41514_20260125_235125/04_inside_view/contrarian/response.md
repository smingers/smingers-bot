## Deep Research (AskNews)

The research indicates that the United States is unlikely to offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026. Here are the key points:

1. **Sovereignty is Non-Negotiable**: Denmark has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected any sale of Greenland, calling sovereignty a "red line". The US has acknowledged this stance after failed pressure tactics.

2. **Shift to Security-Only Talks**: Current discussions exclusively involve NATO-led Arctic security cooperation, with Denmark explicitly stating negotiations are "about security, security, and security" - not sovereignty transfer.

3. **Timeline Constraints**: With only 3 months until May 1, 2026, there is no formal purchase framework in place, trust is severely eroded, and Denmark/Greenland are fortifying military defenses to deter US ambitions.

4. **Broader Consensus Against Sale**: The EU, NATO allies, and Greenland's leadership all oppose a transfer of Greenland to the US, including Greenland's pro-independence factions.

## News Articles (AskNews)

The news articles provide historical context on the US attempts to purchase Greenland, underscoring that Denmark has previously sacrificed strategic territories under geopolitical and economic pressure. However, the current diplomatic landscape suggests Denmark is firmly opposed to any sale of Greenland.

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence is relatively recent, with the most relevant information being from January 2026. The sources appear credible, including reputable news outlets and references to diplomatic statements. There does not seem to be significant bias in the reporting.

The information about Denmark's firm opposition to selling Greenland and the shift in negotiations to focus solely on security cooperation is likely not fully priced into the base rate, which was based on historical precedents.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Denmark's unequivocal rejection of any sale of Greenland, calling sovereignty a "red line"
- The pivot in negotiations to focus exclusively on security cooperation, with Denmark stating it's "about security, security, and security"

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The lack of a formal purchase framework and eroded trust between the US and Denmark/EU
- Greenland and Denmark's efforts to fortify military defenses to deter US ambitions

**WEAK Evidence:**
- None identified

## Step 3: Direction of Update

The strong evidence that Denmark will not sell Greenland and the shift in negotiations away from a potential purchase push the probability DOWN from the base rate.

Evidence update reasoning:
- Denmark's firm opposition to selling Greenland: DOWN by approximately 15 percentage points, as this directly contradicts the historical precedents used in the base rate.
- The shift in negotiations to focus solely on security cooperation: DOWN by approximately 10 percentage points, as this indicates a clear move away from any potential purchase offer.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 26.4%:
- Adjustment 1: -15% for Denmark's firm opposition to selling Greenland
- Adjustment 2: -10% for the shift in negotiations to focus solely on security cooperation
- Cumulative adjustment: -25%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is below 10%, it would require the US to completely abandon its historical interest in Greenland and Denmark to maintain its uncompromising stance on sovereignty despite significant geopolitical pressure.

2. **Base rate anchor:** I can justify the large deviation from the base rate given the strong evidence that Denmark will not sell Greenland and the clear shift in negotiations away from a potential purchase.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not adjusting the probability too far from the base rate.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base rate of 26.4% is misleading in this case. The research reveals that Denmark has taken a firm, unequivocal stance against selling Greenland, and the negotiations have shifted entirely to focus on security cooperation rather than any potential purchase.

This represents a significant departure from the historical precedents used to establish the base rate, which involved the US successfully pressuring Denmark to sell strategic territories in the past. The current diplomatic landscape, with strong opposition from Denmark, Greenland, the EU, and NATO allies, suggests that the US is highly unlikely to make a formal offer to purchase Greenland before the May 1, 2026 deadline.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Denmark's firm opposition to selling Greenland, the shift in negotiations to focus solely on security cooperation
- Net direction: DOWN

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 26.4%
- Total adjustment: -25%
- Final estimate: 1.4%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 9/10

**Probability: 1.4%**
