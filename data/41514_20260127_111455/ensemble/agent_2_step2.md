(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: January 27, 2026
- Prediction deadline: May 1, 2026
- Timeframe: ~3 months

Prediction sensitivity:
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease due to less negotiation time
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase with more diplomatic maneuvering

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Strong U.S. strategic interest
2. Ongoing diplomatic negotiations
3. Trump administration's persistent pursuit
4. Potential compromise frameworks (access vs. ownership)

Probability calibration:
- Diplomatic resistance suggests low probability
- Strategic motivations provide significant incentive
- Evolving negotiation approach increases potential

Checklist:
1. Resolution: Will US offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026?
2. Base rate: Previously established at 17%
3. Consistency: 17/100 times, US makes a purchase offer seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Ongoing strategic negotiations
   - Trump's persistent interest
   - Potential access framework
5. Blind spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or escalation
6. Status quo: Maintains current diplomatic stance

Probability: 22%

The slight increase from the outside view reflects the ongoing negotiations and more nuanced approach, while still acknowledging significant diplomatic barriers.
