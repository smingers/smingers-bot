Moderate Evidence:
- Previous historical attempts to purchase Greenland
- Growing Arctic geopolitical tensions
- NATO considerations

Weak Evidence:
- Public opinion statements
- Speculative media commentary

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 3 months (until May 1, 2026)

Timeframe Sensitivity:
- Shorter timeframe (1.5 months): Reduces probability due to limited negotiation time
- Longer timeframe (6 months): Increases probability, allowing more diplomatic maneuvering

(d) Justification:
Key Shifting Factors:
1. Strategic U.S. Interest: Very High
2. Diplomatic Complexity: Significant
3. Greenlandic/Danish Resistance: Strong
4. Negotiation Momentum: Moderate

The prediction must balance strategic imperative against diplomatic resistance.

Probability calibration:
- Starting outside view base rate: 7%
- Adjustment factors:
  * Strong U.S. strategic interest: +3%
  * Ongoing negotiations: +2%
  * Diplomatic resistance: -2%
- Refined probability considers nuanced diplomatic landscape

Checklist:
1. Title Paraphrase: Will U.S. purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026?
2. Base Rate Consistency: Maintained from original 7%
3. Consistency Check: 10 out of 100 times, U.S. successfully negotiates Greenland purchase
4. Key Evidence:
   - Ongoing diplomatic negotiations
   - Trump's persistent strategic interest
   - Existing U.S. military presence
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or crisis
6. Status Quo Bias: Slight preference toward maintaining current arrangement

Probability: 10%
