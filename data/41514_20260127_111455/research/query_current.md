Analysis:
This forecasting question centers on whether the United States will make an official offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark before May 1, 2026. The background likely relates to the 2019 incident where then-President Trump publicly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, which was met with rejection by Denmark. To assess the likelihood of this occurring, I'll seek current information about:
1. Ongoing diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark
2. Any renewed interest in Greenland's strategic value
3. Geopolitical developments that might motivate such a purchase
4. Current political sentiment towards territorial acquisitions
5. Potential economic or strategic motivations for such an offer

The key is finding credible sources discussing potential US interest in Greenland, diplomatic signals, or strategic considerations that might revive the 2019 proposal.
