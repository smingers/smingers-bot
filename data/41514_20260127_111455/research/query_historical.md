Analysis:
The forecasting question relates to a potential future purchase of Greenland by the United States, which has historical precedent. The 2019 incident during the Trump administration, where President Trump publicly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, makes this scenario seem less far-fetched than it might initially appear. To understand the likelihood, we'll want to research:
1. Historical precedents of territorial purchases by the US
2. Geopolitical relations between the US and Denmark
3. Strategic value of Greenland
4. Previous diplomatic discussions about Greenland's potential transfer

The key will be understanding whether there are ongoing geopolitical, economic, or strategic motivations that might make such a purchase plausible before May 2026.
