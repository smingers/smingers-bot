## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on current reports and analyses from financial news outlets, there is **strong consensus among experts that there will be one dissenting vote** at the January 28, 2026 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 

The key points from recent reports:
1. Governor Michelle Bowman is expected to be the sole dissenter, advocating for interest rate cuts amid pressure from the Trump administration [2][3][6][9][10].
2. Governor Christopher Waller, despite being seen as a potential dissenter earlier, is now expected to align with Chair Jerome Powell and the majority in voting to maintain current interest rates [2][6][9].
3. Multiple sources (including Nomura's economics team) explicitly state Bowman will be the only dissenter among the 12 voting members [10].
4. This dissent would be significant as it reflects both policy differences and ongoing political tensions between the Fed and the White House [6][9][10].

**Important Caveats:**
- This is based on pre-meeting analyses (as of January 24-25, 2026) and the actual outcome may differ when votes are cast [2][10].
- The dissent primarily revolves around interest rate policy, with Bowman advocating for cuts while others prefer maintaining current rates [6][10].
- No other FOMC members are mentioned as likely dissenters in recent reports.

**Fed to Hold Rates Steady Amid Political Pressure, With Global Central Banks Following Suit**
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to maintain interest rates unchanged during its two-day meeting on Wednesday, amid mounting political pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs. Three central banks—Brazil, Canada, and Sweden—that have publicly expressed 'full solidarity' with Fed Chair Jerome Powell are also likely to keep monetary conditions unchanged. This alignment follows statements from over a dozen central bank leaders, including those from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, who have defended the independence of monetary authorities during a period of heightened political scrutiny. The Fed faces additional challenges, including a grand jury subpoena threatening criminal charges and a Supreme Court case assessing whether the president can remove Fed Director Lisa Cook. Globally, central banks operate in a tense environment marked by Japan's recent market collapse, concerns over Trump’s plans for Greenland, and ongoing threats of trade disruptions. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that 'we are no longer in Kansas,' highlighting increased global volatility. Economists Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, Alex Tanzi, and Troy Durie note that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members are likely to justify maintaining rates based on data, with a consensus seen as a show of support for Powell. They anticipate that directors Christopher Waller will vote with the majority to uphold rates, signaling alignment with Powell and the Fed’s independence, while Michelle Bowman may dissent. Meanwhile, central banks remain vigilant about inflationary pressures amid risks to growth from tariffs. Next week, 18 central banks worldwide will make decisions, with African central banks potentially pursuing monetary easing due to differing economic cycles.

**FOMC Meeting Ahead: Fed Expected to Hold Rates Steady as Next Chair Contenders’ Votes Draw Attention**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to hold its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 27–28, 2026, and maintain interest rates within the 3.5–3.75% range, despite pressure from U.S. President Trump to lower borrowing costs. This decision is seen as a demonstration of the Fed’s monetary policy independence. Other central banks, including those of Canada, Brazil, and Sweden, are also expected to keep rates unchanged. Recent U.S. data show a declining unemployment rate in December, but inflation remains above the Fed’s target, supporting the case for maintaining current rates. Economists anticipate that most FOMC members will vote to hold rates steady, signaling confidence in Chair Jerome Powell. Key attention will focus on the votes of Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, both considered top contenders for the next Fed chair. Waller is expected to support the majority, while Bowman may dissent. Powell’s post-meeting press conference will be his first public appearance following the Justice Department subpoena and the Supreme Court Cook hearing, though no new details are expected. The Bank of Canada is also expected to keep its rate at 2.25% on January 28, with its policy report likely highlighting slowing economic growth and heightened uncertainty from the USMCA review. Traders anticipate that Canada’s rate will remain unchanged through most of 2026.

**Global Central Banks Unite to Maintain Stable Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure**
The U.S. Federal Reserve and four other central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB), are collectively committed to maintaining stable interest rates amid growing political pressure. This stance is particularly significant as former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for his cautious approach to lowering interest rates, while also facing legal challenges, including a grand jury subpoena and a Supreme Court review over his attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In response, central banks worldwide, including those in Brazil, Canada, Sweden, and several African nations, are reinforcing their independence and coordinating efforts to resist political interference. Analysts expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain current interest rates at its February 28, 2026, meeting, citing data that supports continuity. Key figures such as Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman are expected to influence this decision, with Waller likely aligning with the majority and Bowman possibly dissenting. Meanwhile, global economic concerns persist, including Japan’s recent stock market crash, rising investor tensions due to Trump’s interest in Greenland and threats to international trade, and mixed inflation data from Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, and Europe. The International Monetary Fund’s Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the global economy is increasingly vulnerable to sudden shifts. While African central banks may pursue loosening measures, the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged through the end of 2025, allowing time to assess the impact of prior rate cuts.

**The Stock Market Is Facing a Federal Reserve Double Whammy in 2026 -- and Things May Get Ugly for Wall Street**
The stock market faces a potential 'double whammy' in 2026 due to historic division within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the impending end of Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chair on May 15, 2026. The S&P 500 has posted three consecutive years of gains of at least 16%, driven by AI innovation, strong corporate earnings, and the tax incentives from the Trump administration’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Investors have also anticipated further rate cuts in 2026 to stimulate economic growth. However, the FOMC has shown unprecedented disagreement in recent meetings: two of the last three meetings featured dissenting votes in opposite directions—some members favored rate cuts, while others opposed any reduction or advocated for larger cuts. Since 1990, only three such meetings with opposing dissents have occurred, and two have happened within the last three months, signaling deep internal conflict. This lack of consensus undermines confidence in an already expensive market, as the S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio is at its second-highest level in 155 years. With President Donald Trump expected to nominate a new Fed chair, concerns grow over a potential shift toward aggressive rate cuts, which could deepen FOMC divisions and threaten market stability. The combination of policy uncertainty and leadership transition may lead to significant turbulence for Wall Street in 2026.

This decision is anticipated despite repeated calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs. Brazil, Canada, and Sweden are also expected to keep rates steady.

Globally, central banks operate under heightened uncertainty, marked by recent sell-offs in Japan, investor concerns over Trump’s Greenland ambitions, and ongoing trade threats. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that 'we are no longer in Kansas,' highlighting increased vulnerability to shocks. Bloomberg Economics analysts predict strong unity among the Federal Open Market Committee, with Chair Powell receiving a vote of confidence. Key figures Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman are closely watched; if they align with the majority, it will signal support for Powell and Fed independence. Waller is expected to vote with the majority, while Bowman may dissent. Policymakers are balancing risks from potential tariffs against inflationary pressures. Up to 18 central banks worldwide are set to announce decisions next week, with African central banks possibly pursuing monetary easing due to differing economic cycles. Major upcoming data include inflation reports from Australia, Brazil, Japan, industrial profits in China, and GDP from the Eurozone.

**Tense Fed Is Set to Lead Global Peers With Interest-Rate Hold**
At the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 24, 2026, International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Kristalina Georgieva warned that 'we are in a more shock-prone world' and that 'we're not in Kansas any more.' She made these remarks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jerome Powell, would hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting. According to the Financial Post, most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants are expected to support maintaining current rates, reflecting a rare level of unity that would serve as a vote of confidence in Powell, who has faced intense criticism from the White House. The most closely watched votes are those of Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman: Waller is expected to support the majority in holding rates steady, signaling alignment with Powell and Fed independence, while Bowman is anticipated to dissent. This divergence could signal internal tensions within the Fed, particularly in relation to political pressure from the Trump administration.

**Federal Reserve and Global Central Banks Strategize to Maintain Interest Rate Stability Amid Political Pressure**
The U.S. Federal Reserve, alongside three other central banks that recently expressed support for its beleaguered chairman, is focused on maintaining interest rate stability during a sensitive period for global leaders. Amid increasing pressure from former U.S. President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve has urged Washington officials to prioritize this goal. Officials are expected to reaffirm this stance at the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday, January 28, 2026. Analysts anticipate that central banks in countries such as Brazil, Canada, and Sweden will likely maintain current interest rates due to prevailing economic conditions. The Federal Reserve faced a tense moment as Trump intensified demands regarding its recent cautious approach to rate cuts. According to informed sources—whose identities were withheld due to the confidential nature of discussions—three central banks collaborated with over twelve other institutions, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which have shown strong support for the Fed’s independence. This cooperation underscores the importance of central bank autonomy amid mounting political pressure from Washington. Reports indicate that in addition to Trump’s repeated criticism of the Fed’s cautious stance, the central bank is currently facing subpoenas from a major grand jury, suggesting a potential for criminal charges. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed arguments on whether Trump could proceed with his intent to remove Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook. In response to this crisis, central banks worldwide adopted a coordinated strategic approach to counter growing international pressures. Despite this, they remain concerned about global challenges, including the recent collapse of Japan’s stock market, rising investor tensions due to Trump’s interest in Greenland, and escalating threats to global trade flows. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, warned during the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world has become more vulnerable to sudden changes. Analysts believe that most members of the Federal Open Market Committee will find data supporting the status quo in the upcoming meeting. This consensus would signal support for Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced criticism from the White House. The two key figures to watch are Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman: if they join the majority in voting to maintain rates unchanged, it would indicate their backing for Powell and the Fed’s independence. Waller is expected to align with the majority, but Bowman may dissent. Policymakers, despite concerns about the negative impact of tariffs on economic expansion, continue to monitor potential inflationary pressures. The outcome of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision remains uncertain, with an upcoming meeting involving 18 central banks worldwide. Analysts expect African central banks to adopt a different approach than the Fed, supporting new easing measures as they adapt to changing economic conditions. Key indicators to watch include inflation reports from Australia to Brazil and Japan, Chinese industrial profits, and European GDP data. Analysts project that the Fed will keep rates steady after implementing three consecutive cuts by late 2025. Powell is expected to suggest that current policy remains appropriate, though he will not disclose future changes. This approach allows officials to assess the economic impact of previous rate cuts before making further decisions.

**Pause on Rate Cuts! Fed's Major Meeting Approaches as U.S. Stocks Brace for 'Super Storm Week'**
The U.S. stock market is approaching a 'super storm week' as the Federal Reserve is set to hold its key interest rate decision meeting on January 27–28, 2026, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expected to announce its decision on January 29. Market consensus, according to CME's Fed Watch, indicates a 95.6% probability of holding rates steady at the 3.50%–3.75% range, with only a 4.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut. This marks a shift from earlier expectations, as 58% of 100 surveyed economists now anticipate no rate cuts in the first quarter, up from previous forecasts of at least one cut in March. The focus will center on the number of dissenting votes and the accompanying statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which will signal future policy direction. According to HSBC economists, Powell is expected to emphasize that future rate decisions will depend on evolving economic data. Jeremy Schwartz, a senior U.S. economist at Nomura, noted that while economic fundamentals suggest a potential pause or even a future rate hike, the Fed may remain on hold until Powell’s term ends in May 2026. He further predicted that a new Fed leadership could initiate another 50 basis points of rate cuts later in 2026. Political interference is also a growing concern: a criminal investigation into Powell, efforts by former President Trump to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, and potential presidential appointments for the next Fed chair—especially with a Supreme Court hearing pending—have introduced significant uncertainty. Oxford Economics’ chief U.S. economist Bernard Yaros warned that political turbulence could hinder the appointment of a Fed chair aligned with dovish monetary policy. Simultaneously, the 'super earnings week' begins, with about one-fifth of the S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and Amazon, releasing earnings. The central theme of this quarter is whether tech giants are beginning to monetize their AI investments. Goldman Sachs forecasts Apple’s Q1 2026 revenue at $137.4 billion (up 11% YoY), driven by iPhone sales expected to reach $78 billion (up 13% YoY), with EPS of $2.66 and a stable gross margin of 47.7%. For Tesla, investor focus has shifted from traditional metrics to progress in Robotaxi, full self-driving, Optimus humanoid robot, and the AI5 chip. Morgan Stanley predicts Tesla’s 2026 vehicle deliveries at 1.6 million units—9% below the market consensus and down 2.5% YoY—and expects updates on AI5 chip development, AI6+, and Dojo supercomputer projects during the earnings call. Additionally, semiconductor giants Samsung and SK Hynix will report earnings, with AI-driven demand and semiconductor cycles expected to be key themes.

**Is the Independence of the Federal Reserve Under Threat?**
The independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve is under scrutiny due to renewed pressure from President Donald Trump, who has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell—whom he appointed in 2018—and attempted to remove member Lisa Cook from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Trump's push for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, despite rising inflation risks from tariff increases, raises concerns about political interference. While the Federal Reserve Act has not been amended and the Fed's legal independence remains intact, the persistent public attacks and legal actions against Powell—such as criminal proceedings over renovation costs—signal growing political pressure. Although the FOMC’s voting structure ensures that policy decisions are not dictated by a single individual, historical precedent shows that Fed members can internalize political pressure, as seen during the 1970s inflation crisis. The current dilemma involves balancing inflation control (targeting 2%) against slowing growth, with the Fed facing conflicting demands. Despite Trump’s influence, the gradual renewal of FOMC members and the need for consensus limit immediate shifts in policy. However, undermining the Fed’s credibility through politicization is not a sound strategy for economic coordination, even if better inter-agency alignment is needed.

**Navigating the Trump-Powell feud**
The feud between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve, particularly targeting Fed Chair Jerome Powell, has escalated to a critical point, with the Department of Justice issuing subpoenas and raising the possibility of a criminal indictment—a first in U.S. history. Powell responded with a video message framing the investigation as a direct threat to the Fed’s independence, warning that monetary policy must be based on evidence, not political pressure. A bipartisan group of former Fed chairs—including Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and Janet Yellen—issued a statement condemning the 'prosecutorial attacks' as incompatible with the rule of law, calling central-bank independence a cornerstone of economic stability. Internationally, central-bank governors from the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and European Central Bank jointly affirmed solidarity with Powell, a rare move that defied norms of non-interference. New Zealand’s foreign minister rebuked its central-bank governor for overstepping. Domestically, some U.S. legislators have threatened to block confirmation of any new Fed board nominees—including a successor to Powell—until the conflict resolves, risking a 'fortress Fed' and potential overreaction in policy. Experts warn this could undermine 'political flexibility' and lead to unanchored inflation expectations, macroeconomic instability, and financial volatility. Despite these risks, internal checks—such as the individual voting power on the Federal Open Market Committee and deep institutional memory of the 1970s inflation crisis—help maintain stability. Market discipline, exemplified by the bond-market reaction to Liz Truss’s brief UK premiership, also acts as a constraint. The article concludes that while the situation is serious, de-escalation is feasible through a negotiated 'off-ramp' for both Trump and Powell, urging a constructive path forward to reinforce Fed independence, accountability, and strategic policy reform.

**Fed Cuts Key Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points with Three Dissenting Votes**
The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points for the third consecutive time, maintaining its projection of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 9 to 3 in favor of reducing the target range to 3.5% to 3.75%. This decision marks the third consecutive rate cut, with three members dissenting. The announcement was reported by Michael McKee from Washington.

**Today's Rate Decision Could Bring More Dissents**
Today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision is expected to feature at least one dissenting vote, highlighting ongoing disagreement between the FOMC's hawks and doves. Fed Governor Stephen Miran is the most likely dissenter, having voted against the committee's action in the previous two meetings. Miran has consistently advocated for larger rate cuts, proposing a half-percentage-point reduction in the federal-funds rate, in contrast to the quarter-point cuts approved in the last two meetings.

**FOMC Preview: Hawkish Cut?**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, December 9, 2025, is anticipated to feature a 25 basis point interest rate cut, with markets pricing in a 90% probability of this outcome. Despite the strong consensus, a hawkish surprise—such as a hold on rates or a less dovish tone—could trigger significant market volatility. Futures markets currently expect a pause in January followed by 100 bps of rate cuts in 2026. The Fed’s updated 'dot-plot'—which reflects FOMC members’ projections for future rates—will be closely watched; if it shows fewer cuts than the market’s expectation of four (100 bps), it may be interpreted as hawkish. The vote split is another key factor: dissenting votes, such as those from Governor Stephen Miran (favoring easing) and Jeffrey Schmid (favoring a hold), have become more frequent since Trump’s appointment of Miran, and increased dissent could signal internal division. Additionally, the language in the accompanying monetary policy statement will influence market sentiment—emphasizing inflation may be seen as hawkish, while highlighting labor market weakness would be dovish. Historically, Fed Chair Powell’s hawkish rhetoric has surprised markets, increasing the risk of a reversal in the dollar and equities if the tone deviates from expectations.

**Growing Dissent at the Fed: Could Monetary Policy Become Politically Driven?**
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has transformed from a lender of last resort into the sole provider of liquidity in financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy, particularly through tools like quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), has become a central driver of market liquidity and asset pricing. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets every six weeks, typically reaches consensus on policy changes—such as adjustments to the federal funds rate—but dissenting votes are not uncommon. Historical data shows that around 5% of FOMC members vote against decisions per meeting, with a maximum of three dissenters in a single session since 2000. The published meeting minutes reveal significant internal debate, despite the official image of unity. The article raises concerns that the Fed may be increasingly influenced by political dynamics, particularly given that presidential nominations shape the ideological makeup of the committee. For instance, Stephen Miran, a nominee of former President Trump, supports aggressive rate cuts, suggesting potential alignment with a pro-Trump economic agenda. Conversely, some members may oppose loosening not out of inflation concerns but as a political stance against the administration. The article warns that growing political polarization within the Fed could undermine the appearance of consensus, especially as recent polling shows volatility in expectations for rate cuts—ranging from 25% to 85%—driven by public statements from committee members. With some members undecided and potential for more than five dissenting votes in the next meeting, the Fed’s ability to project unity may weaken. The author argues that such dissent is beneficial, as it reflects honest disagreement and better informs markets than a false image of unanimity, which has historically led to policy errors.

**Fed Regime Change: Groupthink May Be Ending**
The article discusses a potential shift in the Federal Reserve's decision-making culture, suggesting that the long-standing 'groupthink' regime—where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) publicly presents a unified consensus despite internal disagreements—may be ending. Historically, dissenting votes have been rare, averaging 5% per meeting since 1936, with only three dissenters in a single meeting being the peak. However, recent FOMC meetings show increasing divergence, with multiple members openly opposing policy actions. For example, at the October 29, 2025, meeting, two members dissented: Stephen I. Miran, who favored a 0.5 percentage point rate cut, and Jeffrey R. Schmid, who supported no change. The article argues that political influence, particularly from presidential appointments, may be deepening ideological divides—dovish members may be aligning with political goals, while hawkish members may oppose policies based on ideology rather than economic data. With rate cut probabilities fluctuating between 25% and 85%, and multiple members undecided or split, the possibility of four to six dissenters at the next meeting is rising. The author welcomes this shift, advocating for a new Fed regime where 12 independent members vote based on their own views rather than conforming to the Chair’s leadership. This change, though potentially increasing short-term market volatility, would improve transparency and reduce the risk of policy errors driven by centralized groupthink. The author concludes that a transparent, pluralistic FOMC would better serve investors, businesses, and consumers by reflecting genuine policy debate.

**Fed Regime-Change: Groupthink May Be Ending**
The article argues that the Federal Reserve may be moving away from a long-standing 'groupthink' regime, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consistently presents a unified policy stance despite internal disagreements. Since 1936, FOMC minutes have revealed diverse economic views among members, but public statements have historically shown strong consensus. However, recent dissenting votes—such as two members opposing policy actions at the October 29, 2025, meeting—signal growing divergence. The article suggests that political influence may now be shaping Fed decisions, with appointees like Stephen Miran, a Trump nominee, advocating for aggressive rate cuts, while others may hold hawkish views for political reasons rather than economic fundamentals. The odds of a rate cut at the next meeting have fluctuated between 25% and 85%, reflecting uncertainty. The author contends that the Fed Chair’s role in steering consensus may be weakening, potentially leading to more dissenting votes. The author welcomes this shift, advocating for a new regime where all 12 FOMC members independently voice and vote on policies, even if it introduces short-term market volatility. This change would enhance transparency and reduce the risk of policy errors driven by centralized, unchallenged authority.

**Federal Reserve shows unexpected unity, independence as it weathers Trump's attacks**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on Wednesday and, contrary to expectations of a split vote, adopted a nearly unanimous decision to cut the federal funds rate by a quarter‑point. The 12‑member committee had been anticipated to see up to three dissenting votes – the most in five years – but only one member, Trump‑appointed Stephen Miran, opposed the cut. All other members, including former Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted with the majority. Brian Bethune, a Boston College economist, praised the unity, saying ‘They all came together to support what seems to be a very balanced decision.’  Jason Furman, a former Obama adviser, noted the outcome as a sign of Fed independence.  Trump had tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook; a court allowed her to remain on the board while her lawsuit proceeds.  Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed’s commitment to independence and warned that ‘There are no risk‑free paths now.’  Former Fed economist Claudia Sahm added that ‘The institution is under attack,’ underscoring the significance of the committee’s cohesion.

**Union President Calls US Tariffs Still Significant, Urges Government to Continue Discussion**
On September 17, the newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Steven M. cast a dissenting vote at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and presented a policy‑rate outlook that fell well below the Fed’s consensus. The move, which could be seen as a response to President Trump’s desire to send a close aide to the Fed for media attention, highlights the Fed’s internal disagreement on monetary policy. The article notes that the dissenting vote and the lower rate forecast '投じた反対票' and '示したＦＲＢ内のコンセンサスを大きく下回る政策金利の見通し' respectively.

**Trump‑Backed One‑Vote Rebellion: Fed’s 0.25 p Rate Cut Amid Powell’s Unified Decision**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on September 17 2025 and voted to lower the federal funds target rate by 0.25 percentage point (p). Of the 12 members who cast votes, 11—including Chair Jerome Powell—supported the cut, while the sole dissenting vote came from newly‑appointed Governor Steven Meyer, a Trump loyalist, who voted for a larger 0.5 p cut. Bloomberg noted that the single opposition vote was the most surprising element of the meeting, describing it as a "rebellion vote". Powell, after the decision, explained that the FOMC’s structure—19 participants with 12 rotating voters—makes it difficult for any single member to wield excessive influence, adding that "the only way a voter could truly change the outcome is by having an incredibly persuasive argument" and that there was "no widespread support for the 0.5 p cut." The article also references that in July the FOMC had seen a shift when Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, moved from opposing the cut to joining the majority. A Bloomberg correspondent remarked, '파월이 고양이들을 울타리 안으로 몰아넣었다는 게 분명합니다.' The meeting’s key metrics were a 0.25 p rate cut, 0.5 p dissenting vote, 12 voting members, and 19 total participants.

**Miran Was the Sole Dissent, Opting for a Larger Cut**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to cut the federal‑funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, but newly installed Fed governor Miran was the sole dissenting member. According to the Fed’s statement, Miran preferred a half‑percentage‑point cut. Miran was sworn onto the board of governors on Tuesday after Senate confirmation on Monday evening. The July meeting marked the first time in more than thirty years that two Fed governors dissented on a policy decision; earlier in the month, Waller and Bowman had voted against keeping the rate unchanged.

### History of Federal Open Market Committee actions
This is a list of historical rate actions by the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC controls the supply of credit to banks and the sale of treasury securities. The Federal Open Market Committee meets every two months during the fiscal year. At scheduled meetings, the FOMC meets and makes any changes it sees as necessary, notably to the federal funds rate and the discount rate. The committee may also take actions with a less firm target, such as an increasing liquidity by the sale of a set amount of Treasury bonds, or affecting the price of currencies both foreign and domestic by selling dollar reserves (such as during the Mexican peso bailout in 1994). Jerome Powell is the current chairperson of the Federal Reserve and the FOMC.

The committee may also take actions with a less firm target, such as an increasing liquidity by the sale of a set amount of Treasury bonds, or affecting the price of currencies both foreign and domestic by selling dollar reserves (such as during the Mexican peso bailout in 1994). Jerome Powell is the current chairperson of the Federal Reserve and the FOMC. The Federal Open Market Committee action known as Operation Twist (named for the twist dance craze of the time) began in 1961. The intent was to flatten the yield curve in order to promote capital inflows and strengthen the dollar. The Fed utilized open market operations to shorten the maturity of public debt in the open market. It performs the 'twist' by selling some of the short term debt (with three years or less to maturity) it purchased as part of the quantitative easing policy back into the market and using the money received from this to buy longer term government debt. Although this action was marginally successful in reducing the spread between long-term maturities and short-term maturities, Vincent Reinhart and others have suggested it did not continue for a sufficient period of time to be effective. Despite being considered a failure since a 1966 near-term analysis by Franco Modigliani and Richard Sutch, the action has subsequently been reexamined and in a 2011 paper economist Eric Swanson of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has suggested that "Operation Twist" was more effective than originally thought. Swanson suggested similar action as an alternative to quantitative easing by central banks; the FOMC did in fact take an analogous action in 2011. Inflation in the US was persistent in the 1970s. Year-on-year inflation bottomed at 5% in December 1976 before moving higher once again. Paul Volcker was chosen as Fed Chairman in 1979 in order to deal with the challenge of high inflation

### History of Federal Open Market Committee actions
This is a list of historical rate actions by the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC controls the supply of credit to banks and the sale of treasury securities. The Federal Open Market Committee meets every two months during the fiscal year. At scheduled meetings, the FOMC meets and makes any changes it sees as necessary, notably to the federal funds rate and the discount rate. The committee may also take actions with a less firm target, such as an increasing liquidity by the sale of a set amount of Treasury bonds, or affecting the price of currencies both foreign and domestic by selling dollar reserves (such as during the Mexican peso bailout in 1994).

History of Federal Open Market Committee actions

. In a rare Saturday press conference on October 6, 1979, Paul Volcker's federal reserve increased the Fed Funds rate from 11% to 12%. The event was known as the "Saturday Night Massacre" because of its effect on US bond prices. "On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion in agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs) and agency debt. However, these purchases were to have no impact on the balance sheet, and would have been sterilized by Treasury sales by the System Open Market Account (SOMA) desk. On December 1, Chairman Bernanke provided further details in a speech. On December 16 the program was formally approved by the FOMC, however their approval was not required as the SOMA desk was already authorized to acquire Agency debt and MBS as part of their Open Market Operations (OMOs). On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the program would be expanded by an additional $750 billion in purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities. These purchases would be unsterilized and this date more appropriately marks the beginning of QE in the US. In August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target for the federal funds rate was 5.25 percent. Sixteen months later, with the 2008 financial crisis in full swing, the FOMC had lowered the target for the federal funds rate to nearly zero, thereby entering the unfamiliar territory of having to conduct monetary policy with the policy interest rate at its effective lower bound. The unusual severity of the recession and ongoing strains in financial markets made the challenges facing monetary policymakers all the greater. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower overnight interest rates to zero to help with easing of money and credit. Over the past five years, the Federal Reserve has acted to support economic growth and foster job creation, and it is important to achieve further progress, particularly in the labor market. Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability
