# Full Analysis: FOMC January 28, 2026 Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency Assessment:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026) - just 3-4 days before the actual meeting on January 28, 2026
- This is highly relevant timing, as these are pre-meeting analyses based on current positioning

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple independent financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN, 工商時報)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited (credible institutional forecaster)
- Consistent messaging across diverse sources suggests genuine consensus

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong; actual votes may differ from expectations
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than providing truly independent analysis
- Political pressure narrative may be overemphasized in media coverage

**Priced into Base Distribution?**
- The base distribution shows 74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent
- This appears to be historical base rates, NOT incorporating the specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent
- The current evidence appears to be NEW information not reflected in the base distribution

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

### STRONG Evidence

**Evidence 1: Multiple sources explicitly predict Bowman as sole dissenter**
- Favors: **1 dissent**
- Multiple independent outlets (Nomura, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan) specifically name Michelle Bowman
- Clear mechanism: Bowman advocating for rate cuts vs. majority preferring to hold
- Consistent across all sources with no contradictory reporting

**Evidence 2: Waller expected to align with majority despite earlier speculation**
- Favors: **1 dissent** (against 2+ dissents)
- Financial Post explicitly contrasts Bowman vs. Waller, noting Waller will vote with Powell
- Eliminates the most likely second dissenter candidate
- Reduces probability of 2+ dissents significantly

### MODERATE Evidence

**Evidence 3: Political pressure context**
- Favors: **1 dissent** (could theoretically increase dissents)
- Trump administration pressure for rate cuts creates environment for potential dissent
- However, sources suggest this pressure is actually strengthening unity among most FOMC members
- Net effect: supports the narrative of Bowman being isolated in her position

### WEAK Evidence

**Evidence 4: Historical pattern of Fed independence**
- Slightly favors: **0 dissents**
- Fed traditionally shows unity when facing political pressure
- However, this is contradicted by specific intelligence about Bowman's position
- Too general to override specific predictions

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**Option: 0 dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Historical base rate (74%), Fed unity under pressure
- Evidence against: STRONG - Multiple explicit predictions of Bowman dissent, no sources suggest 0 dissents
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 55-60%** (from 74% to ~15-20%)

**Option: 1 dissent**
- Evidence favoring: STRONG - Explicit predictions from multiple sources naming Bowman, Waller alignment eliminates second dissenter
- Evidence against: Base rate suggests this is less common historically
- Net adjustment: **INCREASE by 50-55%** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**Option: 2 dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Base rate of 5%, political pressure environment
- Evidence against: STRONG - Waller explicitly expected to align with majority, no second dissenter identified
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 3-4%** (from 5% to ~1-2%)

**Option: 3+ dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Only the base rate of 1%
- Evidence against: STRONG - No evidence of multiple dissenters, consensus appears strong
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 0.5-0.8%** (from 1% to ~0.2-0.5%)

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0 dissents: 74% → 17%
- 1 dissent: 20% → 72%
- 2 dissents: 5% → 2%
- 3+ dissents: 1% → 0.5%

Normalized (sum check: 91.5% → need to scale):
- Scaling factor needed, but close enough to adjust manually

Final integrated distribution:
- 0 dissents: 17%
- 1 dissent: 72%
- 2 dissents: 10%
- 3+ dissents: 1%

Wait - I need to reconsider the 2 dissents probability. While Waller is expected to align, the evidence isn't absolutely certain, and there could be other members. Let me be more conservative.

Revised:
- 0 dissents: 18%
- 1 dissent: 70%
- 2 dissents: 11%
- 3+ dissents: 1%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity Check:**
- 1 dissent at 70%: For me to be wrong, either (a) Bowman votes with majority contrary to all predictions, or (b) another member unexpectedly dissents
- 0 dissents at 18%: Bowman would need to change position or sources are all wrong
- These seem reasonable given evidence strength

**2. Base Rate Anchor:**
- Moving from 74% (0 dissents) to 18% is a large shift
- Justified because: (a) we have specific intelligence about this particular meeting, (b) multiple independent sources agree, (c) named individual with clear motivation
- This is NOT a historical average but a specific forecast

**3. Update Magnitude:**
- 50+ percentage point shift is large but warranted by STRONG evidence
- Multiple independent sources with specific predictions justify major update
- This is exactly the type of situation where inside information should override base rates

**4. Sum Check:**
18 + 70 + 11 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I'm evaluating this through the lens of current actors, incentives, and credible intelligence.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **Actor Identification:** Michelle Bowman has been explicitly identified by multiple credible sources as the likely sole dissenter. This isn't speculation - it's based on her known policy preferences and recent statements.

2. **Incentive Structure:** Bowman's incentive to dissent aligns with advocacy for rate cuts amid economic concerns. The Trump administration's pressure creates a political context, but most FOMC members appear to be rallying around Powell to demonstrate independence, which paradoxically isolates Bowman.

3. **Strength of Evidence:** The convergence of multiple independent sources (Nomura, major financial outlets across different regions) on the same specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter) is rare and highly informative. This is not typical pre-meeting speculation but appears to be based on actual intelligence about member positioning.

4. **Elimination of Alternatives:** The explicit statement that Waller will vote with the majority eliminates the most likely second dissenter, significantly reducing the probability of 2+ dissents.

5. **Recency and Relevance:** This intelligence is from 3-4 days before the meeting - recent enough to be highly relevant but allowing for last-minute changes.

**Risk Factors:**
- Bowman could change her position at the last minute
- An unexpected dissenter could emerge
- Sources could all be wrong (though unlikely given convergence)
- Political pressure could create unexpected dynamics

**Confidence Assessment:**
I have high confidence in this adjustment (8/10) because of the strength and convergence of evidence, though I maintain meaningful probability on 0 dissents (18%) and 2 dissents (11%) to account for uncertainty.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Bowman explicitly predicted as sole dissenter by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (contradicts specific predictions), 2+ dissents (Waller expected to align, no other dissenters identified)
- Net direction: Massive shift from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 18%
1: 70%
2: 11%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 dissent (70%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10
