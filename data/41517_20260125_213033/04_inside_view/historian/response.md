# Analysis as Historian and Superforecaster

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:** The evidence is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026) - just 3-4 days before the January 28, 2026 meeting. This is highly relevant timing.

**Source Credibility:** 
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Consensus across independent sources

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation could be wrong
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than independent analysis
- Political narrative (Trump pressure) may be overemphasized

**Already Priced In?** 
The base distribution shows 74% for 0 dissents and 20% for 1 dissent. The current evidence strongly suggests 1 dissent is more likely, so this may NOT be fully priced into the base distribution.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (at least 5) specifically naming Michelle Bowman as expected sole dissenter, favoring **1 dissent**
- Explicit statement from Nomura economics team predicting Bowman as lone dissenter, favoring **1 dissent**
- Christopher Waller now expected to align with majority (not dissent), favoring **1 dissent** over higher numbers

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- Historical context: Political pressure on Fed during Trump administration creates conditions for dissent, favoring **1+ dissents**
- Timing: Pre-meeting analyses 3-4 days out have reasonable but not perfect predictive power, supporting **1 dissent**

**WEAK Evidence:**
- No sources mention possibility of 0 dissents as likely outcome (against **0 dissents**)
- No sources mention multiple dissenters beyond Bowman (against **2 or 3+ dissents**)

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None explicitly
- Evidence against: All sources predict at least Bowman will dissent; no source suggests consensus vote
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55%** (from 74% to ~20%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman; Nomura explicit prediction; Waller expected to align with majority
- Evidence against: None significant
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 50-55%** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: No second dissenter mentioned in any source; Waller specifically expected NOT to dissent
- Net adjustment: **Decrease slightly** (from 5% to ~4%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters
- Net adjustment: **Decrease slightly** (from 1% to ~1%)

## Step 4: Integration

Starting distribution:
- 0: 74%
- 1: 20%
- 2: 5%
- 3+: 1%

After adjustments:
- 0: 74% - 54% = 20%
- 1: 20% + 54% = 74%
- 2: 5% - 1% = 4%
- 3+: 1% + 0% = 1%

Sum check: 20 + 74 + 4 + 1 = 99% (need to adjust by 1%)

Final adjustment (add 1% to most likely):
- 0: 20%
- 1: 75%
- 2: 4%
- 3+: 1%

Sum: 100% ✓

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** 1 dissent at 75% - For me to be wrong, either: (a) Bowman changes position last-minute, (b) sources are all wrong about her stance, or (c) another member unexpectedly dissents or Bowman doesn't. These are plausible but unlikely given consensus reporting.

2. **Base rate anchor:** I've essentially flipped the base distribution between 0 and 1 dissents. This is justified because:
   - The base distribution may have been established before recent specific intelligence about Bowman
   - Multiple credible sources with specific names and reasoning support the flip
   - Historical precedent shows FOMC members do dissent when under political pressure

3. **Update magnitude:** A ~54 percentage point swing is large but justified by:
   - Multiple independent sources
   - Specific named individual (Bowman)
   - Very recent intelligence (3-4 days before meeting)
   - Clear reasoning provided (policy disagreement on rate cuts)

4. **Sum check:** 20 + 75 + 4 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Historical Perspective)

As a historian examining FOMC dissent patterns, several key factors inform my analysis:

**Historical Precedent for Single Dissents:**
Historically, single dissents at FOMC meetings are common when there are clear policy disagreements. During periods of political pressure on the Fed (notably during previous Trump administration 2017-2021), individual governors have dissented when they disagreed with the majority position. The pattern of one dissenter advocating for more dovish policy (rate cuts) while the majority maintains rates is well-established.

**Pattern Recognition:**
The current situation mirrors historical episodes where:
1. External political pressure exists (Trump calling for rate cuts)
2. One Fed governor aligns somewhat with that pressure for policy reasons
3. The Chair and majority maintain independence by holding steady
4. Result: One dissent, not zero (which would suggest the governor caved) or multiple (which would suggest institutional breakdown)

**Michelle Bowman's Historical Pattern:**
Looking at recent FOMC history, Bowman has shown willingness to dissent when she disagrees. This is consistent with her expected behavior.

**Why Not Zero Dissents?**
Historical analysis shows that when there's significant external pressure and clear policy disagreement, complete consensus is rare. The absence of any source predicting consensus, combined with named individual (Bowman) with clear policy rationale, makes 0 dissents unlikely.

**Why Not Multiple Dissents?**
Historically, multiple dissents occur when there's institutional crisis or fundamental disagreement on direction. Current evidence shows Waller (the other potential dissenter) is expected to align with Powell, suggesting institutional cohesion. Multiple dissents would be historically unusual without evidence of broader disagreement.

**Confidence Assessment:**
The convergence of multiple independent sources, specific named individual, clear policy rationale, and consistency with historical patterns of single dissents during politically charged periods gives me high confidence in this adjustment.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Michelle Bowman specifically named by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (no source predicts consensus; all predict Bowman dissent)
- Net direction: Probability mass shifted from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 75%
2: 4%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (75%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10
