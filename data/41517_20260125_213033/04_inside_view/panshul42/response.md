# Full Analysis: FOMC Dissenting Votes Forecast

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026), just 3-4 days before the January 28, 2026 meeting
- This is highly relevant timing for pre-meeting predictions

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Mix of international sources suggesting independent verification
- These are professional financial analysts making specific predictions

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation always carries uncertainty
- Sources may be relying on similar analyst reports
- Political context (Trump pressure) may be influencing narrative
- No direct quotes from FOMC members themselves

**Already Priced In:**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- This specific, recent intelligence about Bowman as expected dissenter is likely NOT priced into the base distribution
- The base distribution seems to reflect historical patterns, not this specific meeting's dynamics

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources predicting exactly 1 dissent (Bowman)**: At least 5 independent sources ([2][3][6][9][10]) specifically name Michelle Bowman as the expected sole dissenter. This convergence across sources is significant.
- **Nomura economics team explicit forecast**: Professional forecasters explicitly stating "Bowman will be the only dissenter among the 12 voting members" provides institutional credibility.
- **Specific policy rationale identified**: Bowman advocating for rate cuts vs. majority favoring hold provides clear mechanism for dissent.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Waller expected to align with majority**: Multiple sources note Waller, despite earlier speculation, will vote with Powell. This reduces probability of 2+ dissents.
- **Political pressure context**: Trump administration pressure creates environment for potential dissent, but also incentive for Fed to show unity.
- **No other dissenters mentioned**: Absence of speculation about other potential dissenters suggests 0 or 1 dissent most likely.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **Timing uncertainty caveat**: Sources acknowledge actual vote may differ from predictions.
- **Historical patterns**: Not explicitly discussed in research but implied by base distribution.

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: General Fed preference for consensus, political pressure might encourage unity
- Evidence against: 5+ sources specifically predicting Bowman will dissent, clear policy disagreement identified
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 45-50%** (from 74% to ~25-30%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman, Nomura explicit forecast, clear policy rationale, Waller expected to vote with majority
- Evidence against: Pre-meeting predictions could be wrong, Bowman might align at last minute
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 45-50%** (from 20% to ~65-70%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: Political environment could create additional dissent
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any source, Waller specifically expected to align with majority
- Net adjustment: **Slight decrease** (from 5% to ~3-4%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None identified
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters, would require multiple members to break from consensus unexpectedly
- Net adjustment: **Maintain or slight decrease** (from 1% to ~1%)

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0: 74% → 26%
- 1: 20% → 68%
- 2: 5% → 4%
- 3+: 1% → 1%

Sum check: 26 + 68 + 4 + 1 = 99%

Adjustment to reach 100%:
- 0: 26%
- 1: 69%
- 2: 4%
- 3+: 1%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity Check:**
- 1 dissent at 69% is high but not extreme
- For me to be wrong: Bowman would need to change position, or predictions would need to be systematically biased
- This is plausible (maybe 25-30% chance), which aligns with keeping 0 dissents at 26%

**2. Base Rate Anchor:**
- Large deviation from base (74% → 26% for 0 dissents)
- Justified because: Base appears to be historical average, not meeting-specific intelligence
- Multiple independent recent sources provide specific, credible prediction for THIS meeting

**3. Update Magnitude:**
- ~48% swing from 0 to 1 dissent is large
- Proportional to STRONG evidence: multiple independent sources, explicit institutional forecast, clear mechanism
- Meeting is in 3 days, so this is late-breaking, highly relevant information

**4. Sum Check:**
- 26 + 69 + 4 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Panshul42 Inside View)

As a superforecaster using the Panshul42 Q2 winner methodology, I focus on:

1. **Specific, recent intelligence over general base rates**: The base distribution appears to reflect historical patterns (most FOMC meetings have 0 dissents). However, we have multiple credible sources from January 24-25, 2026—just days before the meeting—providing specific predictions about THIS particular meeting.

2. **Convergence of independent sources**: When 5+ independent sources (including professional forecasters like Nomura) converge on the same specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter), this represents strong signal over noise.

3. **Clear causal mechanism**: The research identifies a specific policy disagreement (rate cuts vs. hold) and specific political context (Trump pressure). This isn't vague speculation—it's a concrete reason for dissent.

4. **Process of elimination**: The research specifically addresses potential alternative dissenters (Waller) and explains why they're expected to align with the majority. This strengthens the "exactly 1" prediction.

5. **Appropriate uncertainty**: While the evidence strongly favors 1 dissent, I maintain meaningful probability (~26%) for 0 dissents because:
   - Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong
   - Bowman could align at the last minute
   - Fed members value consensus and may compromise

6. **Conservative on tails**: I keep 2 and 3+ dissents low because no evidence suggests additional dissenters, though I don't eliminate them entirely given political uncertainty.

The key insight is that we're not forecasting a generic FOMC meeting—we have specific, credible, recent intelligence about this particular meeting that justifies substantial departure from the historical base rate.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (multiple independent sources, Nomura forecast, specific dissenter named)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (convergent predictions of Bowman dissent)
- Net direction: Probability mass shifted from 0 to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 26%
1: 69%
2: 4%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (69%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10
