# Quantitative Analysis: FOMC Dissenting Votes Forecast

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:**
- Research generated January 25, 2026 (3 days before the meeting)
- Multiple news sources from January 24-25, 2026
- This is highly recent and relevant information

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple independent financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Mix of established financial journalism and analysis

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation could be wrong
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than providing independent analysis
- Political pressure narrative may be overemphasized in media

**Already Priced In?**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- Current specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent is likely NOT fully priced into this generic base rate

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources naming Bowman as sole dissenter**: At least 5 independent sources ([2][3][6][9][10]) specifically identify Michelle Bowman as the expected dissenter, with Nomura explicitly stating she will be the "only dissenter among 12 voting members." This strongly favors **1 dissent**.
- **Waller expected to align with majority**: Multiple sources ([2][6][9]) indicate Christopher Waller, previously seen as potential dissenter, will vote with Powell. This reduces probability of 2+ dissents.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Clear policy rationale**: Bowman's dissent is based on advocating for rate cuts amid political pressure, providing a logical mechanism. Favors **1 dissent**.
- **No other dissenters mentioned**: Comprehensive coverage mentions no other potential dissenters among the 12 voting members. Favors **1 dissent** over **2+**.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **Caveat about pre-meeting analysis**: Sources acknowledge actual votes may differ when cast. Creates uncertainty around all predictions.
- **Political pressure context**: Unusual political environment could theoretically create additional dissenters not anticipated. Slight increase to uncertainty.

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence against: Multiple strong sources predicting Bowman dissent
- Evidence favoring: General acknowledgment predictions could be wrong
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55 percentage points** (from 74% to ~19-24%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman specifically; Nomura explicit forecast; no other dissenters identified
- Evidence against: Pre-meeting uncertainty caveat
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 45-50 percentage points** (from 20% to ~65-70%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any source; Waller expected to align with majority
- Evidence favoring: Political pressure environment creates some tail risk
- Net adjustment: **Slight increase** (from 5% to ~8-10%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters; comprehensive coverage identifies only Bowman
- Evidence favoring: Black swan political scenarios
- Net adjustment: **Minimal change** (from 1% to ~2-3%)

## Step 4: Integration

Starting distribution:
- 0: 74.0%
- 1: 20.0%
- 2: 5.0%
- 3+: 1.0%

Quantitative adjustments based on evidence strength:

The evidence strongly supports a shift from the historical baseline (0 dissents most common) to the specific forecast for this meeting (1 dissent expected). The strength of multiple independent sources with specific individual identification justifies a major reweighting.

Proposed distribution:
- 0: 20% (strong evidence against, but maintaining probability for forecast error)
- 1: 68% (strong convergent evidence)
- 2: 10% (slight increase for political uncertainty)
- 3+: 2% (minimal increase for tail risk)

Sum check: 20 + 68 + 10 + 2 = 100% ✓

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity check:**
- No option <5% or >95%, so not at extremes
- For 1 dissent (68%) to be wrong: Bowman would need to change position, or additional unexpected dissenters would need to emerge, or no dissent would occur despite multiple forecasts

**2. Base rate anchor:**
- Large deviation from base (74% → 20% for 0 dissents) justified by:
  - Specific, named individual expected to dissent
  - Multiple independent confirmatory sources
  - Clear policy rationale
  - This is meeting-specific intelligence vs. historical average

**3. Update magnitude:**
- ~48 percentage point shift from 0 to 1 dissent
- Justified by STRONG evidence classification with multiple independent sources
- Maintains 20% residual on 0 dissents to account for forecast uncertainty

**4. Sum check:** 20 + 68 + 10 + 2 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Quantitative Perspective)

As a quantitative analyst, I focus on the data:

**Historical Base Rate Context:**
The base distribution of 74% for zero dissents likely reflects historical FOMC voting patterns where consensus is common. However, this is a generic baseline.

**Meeting-Specific Data:**
The current intelligence represents a significant information advantage over the base rate:
- **N=5+ independent sources** identifying the same individual (Bowman) as dissenter
- **Specificity**: Not just "likely dissent" but named individual with policy rationale
- **Negative evidence**: Comprehensive coverage identifies NO other likely dissenters
- **Waller data point**: Previously potential dissenter now expected to vote with majority

**Quantitative Adjustment Logic:**
Using Bayesian reasoning, the prior (base distribution) should be updated significantly when:
1. Multiple independent observations converge
2. Specific mechanisms are identified
3. Coverage is comprehensive (reducing unknown unknowns)

All three conditions are met here.

**Risk Factors:**
- **Forecast error rate**: Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong (~20-30% residual probability)
- **Political volatility**: Unusual environment adds tail risk to 2+ dissents
- **Information lag**: 3 days before meeting allows position changes

**Probability Calibration:**
- 68% for 1 dissent reflects high confidence from convergent sources while maintaining humility about forecast uncertainty
- 20% for 0 dissents accounts for meaningful probability of forecast error or last-minute position changes
- 10% for 2 dissents reflects political uncertainty creating small probability of additional unexpected dissenter
- 2% for 3+ dissents maintains minimal tail risk probability

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: **1 dissent** (multiple independent sources naming Bowman specifically)
- Strong evidence against: **0 dissents** (contradicts multiple forecasts), **2+ dissents** (no other dissenters identified)
- Net direction: Major probability shift from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 68%
2: 10%
3+: 2%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 dissent (68%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

The high confidence reflects multiple independent sources with specific individual identification, though I maintain 2 points of uncertainty due to the inherent unpredictability of individual voting behavior and the 3-day gap before the actual meeting.
