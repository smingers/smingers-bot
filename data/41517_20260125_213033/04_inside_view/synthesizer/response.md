# Comprehensive Analysis: FOMC January 28, 2026 Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026), just 3-4 days before the actual meeting
- This is highly relevant timing for forecasting FOMC votes

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan)
- Explicit mention of Nomura's economics team (a major financial institution)
- Cross-referenced reporting from different geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, Taiwan)

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong even when consensus-driven
- Sources may be interpreting similar analyst reports rather than independent intelligence
- Political pressure narrative may be emphasized for newsworthiness

**Already Priced In?**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- The specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent is NOT reflected in the base distribution
- This represents NEW, material information

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent sources naming Michelle Bowman as expected sole dissenter**: This is reported across at least 4-5 different outlets, with specific attribution to Nomura economists. The convergence of independent reporting strongly suggests this is well-sourced market consensus. **Favors: 1 dissent**
- **Explicit statement that Christopher Waller will vote with majority**: Previously considered a potential dissenter, multiple sources now indicate he will align with Powell. This reduces the probability of multiple dissents. **Favors: 1 dissent, Against: 2+ dissents**

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Consensus expectation for rate hold**: When there's broad agreement on the policy direction (maintaining rates), dissents become more predictable. The fact that markets expect a hold with one known dissenter suggests limited uncertainty. **Favors: 1 dissent**
- **Political pressure context**: The Trump administration pressure creates an environment where some dissent is likely, but the specific nature (Bowman wanting cuts) is well-telegraphed. **Favors: 1 dissent over 0**

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **"May dissent" language**: Some sources use conditional language ("may dissent") rather than definitive predictions, suggesting some residual uncertainty. **Slightly increases uncertainty across all options**
- **Pre-meeting timing caveat**: Analysts acknowledge actual votes may differ from predictions. **Increases baseline uncertainty**

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None directly
- Evidence against: Multiple sources explicitly predict Bowman will dissent; political environment makes some dissent likely
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55 percentage points** (from 74% to ~20%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman; Waller expected to align with majority; Nomura explicit prediction; no other dissenters mentioned
- Evidence against: Conditional language in some reports; pre-meeting uncertainty
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 50-55 percentage points** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: General uncertainty; possibility of surprise dissenter
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any reporting; Waller explicitly expected to vote with majority
- Net adjustment: **Slight increase** (from 5% to ~8-10%) to account for unknown unknowns

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: Extreme political pressure scenario
- Evidence against: No evidence of multiple potential dissenters; consensus on policy direction
- Net adjustment: **Minimal change** (from 1% to ~2%) - very unlikely but not impossible

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0: 74% → 20%
- 1: 20% → 72%
- 2: 5% → 7%
- 3+: 1% → 1%

Check: 20 + 72 + 7 + 1 = 100% ✓

The relative ordering makes sense: strong consensus for 1 dissent, with 0 dissents as second most likely (if Bowman changes position or analysts are wrong), and small probabilities for multiple dissents.

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity check:**
- 1 dissent at 72%: For this to be wrong, either (a) Bowman votes with majority despite multiple analyst predictions, or (b) additional unexpected dissenters emerge
- Both scenarios are plausible but less likely than the consensus prediction

**2. Base rate anchor:**
- Moving from 74% (0 dissents) to 72% (1 dissent) is a major shift
- Justified because: The base rate appears generic/historical, while we have specific, recent intelligence about this particular meeting
- The shift reflects incorporation of meeting-specific information

**3. Update magnitude:**
- ~50 percentage point swing is large but proportional to STRONG evidence (multiple independent sources, specific names, recent timing)
- Not moving to >85% for 1 dissent because of conditional language and pre-meeting uncertainty

**4. Sum check:**
- 20 + 72 + 7 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Synthesizer Role)

As a synthesizer integrating multiple perspectives and identifying key uncertainties, my assessment is:

**Key Insight:** The convergence of multiple independent sources on a specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter) represents a rare case where meeting-specific intelligence substantially overrides historical base rates.

**Critical Factors Identified:**
1. **Consensus specificity**: Not just predicting "likely dissent" but naming the specific individual (Bowman) and explaining the rationale (favoring rate cuts)
2. **Elimination of alternatives**: Waller explicitly expected to vote with majority, removing the most likely alternative dissenter
3. **Recency and relevance**: Intelligence from 3-4 days before the meeting with no contradictory information

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. **Last-minute position changes**: FOMC members could shift views based on final deliberations
2. **Unknown dissenters**: Someone not mentioned in reporting could dissent
3. **Analyst error**: Market consensus predictions can be wrong

**Balanced View:**
The evidence strongly favors 1 dissent, but I'm maintaining meaningful probability on 0 dissents (~20%) because:
- Pre-meeting predictions have inherent uncertainty
- Bowman could ultimately vote with the majority
- The political pressure might lead to unity

I'm keeping modest probability on 2+ dissents (~8%) for unknown unknowns, though no evidence supports this scenario.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Bowman named by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (consensus expects Bowman dissent); 2+ dissents (no second dissenter identified)
- Net direction: 1 dissent gained ~52 percentage points

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 72%
2: 7%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (72%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

The high confidence reflects strong, convergent evidence from multiple sources with specific details, tempered by the inherent uncertainty of pre-meeting predictions.
