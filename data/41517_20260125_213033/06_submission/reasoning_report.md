# Base Distribution Analysis: FOMC Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Available Data Sources:**
- Federal Reserve official meeting minutes and statements (publicly available since 1993 in detail)
- FOMC voting records are publicly documented for every meeting
- Federal Reserve archives provide comprehensive historical data
- Academic studies on FOMC voting patterns

**Reliability Assessment:**
The historical record for FOMC voting is exceptionally reliable. Every vote is officially recorded and published. The data is:
- Complete and systematic since the modern FOMC structure was established
- Free from reporting bias (official government records)
- Consistently formatted and easily verifiable
- Comprehensive coverage of all meetings

**Data Quality Score: 9/10** - This is among the highest quality historical data available for forecasting questions.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

### Reference Class 1: All FOMC Meetings (2000-2024)
- **Description:** All regular FOMC meetings in the modern era
- **Historical distribution:** 
  - 0 dissents: ~70-75% of meetings
  - 1 dissent: ~20-22% of meetings
  - 2 dissents: ~4-6% of meetings
  - 3+ dissents: ~1-2% of meetings
- **Sample size:** ~200 meetings over 24 years (8 meetings per year)
- **Suitability score: 9/10**
- **Reasoning:** This is the most direct reference class. The FOMC structure, voting procedures, and culture have remained relatively stable during this period. This captures the baseline tendency toward consensus.

### Reference Class 2: FOMC Meetings (2010-2024, Post-Financial Crisis)
- **Description:** FOMC meetings in the post-2008 financial crisis era
- **Historical distribution:**
  - 0 dissents: ~75-80% of meetings
  - 1 dissent: ~15-18% of meetings
  - 2 dissents: ~3-5% of meetings
  - 3+ dissents: ~1-2% of meetings
- **Sample size:** ~112 meetings over 14 years
- **Suitability score: 8/10**
- **Reasoning:** More recent period may better reflect current FOMC culture and norms. The post-crisis era saw somewhat fewer dissents as the Fed emphasized forward guidance and consensus.

### Reference Class 3: FOMC Meetings During Policy Transition Periods
- **Description:** Meetings during periods when policy was actively changing direction
- **Historical distribution:**
  - 0 dissents: ~60-65% of meetings
  - 1 dissent: ~25-30% of meetings
  - 2 dissents: ~7-10% of meetings
  - 3+ dissents: ~2-3% of meetings
- **Sample size:** ~50-60 meetings during tightening/easing cycles
- **Suitability score: 7/10**
- **Reasoning:** January 2026 could fall during a transition period. These periods historically see more dissents as committee members disagree on timing and magnitude of changes.

### Reference Class 4: January FOMC Meetings Specifically
- **Description:** First meetings of the calendar year
- **Historical distribution:**
  - 0 dissents: ~75-80% of meetings
  - 1 dissent: ~15-20% of meetings
  - 2 dissents: ~3-5% of meetings
  - 3+ dissents: ~0-2% of meetings
- **Sample size:** ~24 meetings (one per year since 2000)
- **Suitability score: 6/10**
- **Reasoning:** January meetings tend to be slightly more consensus-oriented, but sample size is smaller. No strong seasonal pattern in dissents, but worth considering.

## Step 3: Per-Option Analysis

### Option: 0 Dissents
**What must be true:** The committee reaches consensus on the policy decision, or dissenters choose not to formally dissent.

**Historical precedent:** This is the modal outcome by far. The FOMC has a strong institutional culture favoring consensus. Chairs typically work to build consensus before meetings.

**Base rate:** 70-80% across most reference classes

**Supporting factors:**
- Strong institutional norm toward consensus
- Chair typically has significant influence
- Members often defer to avoid market disruption

### Option: 1 Dissent
**What must be true:** One member disagrees sufficiently with the decision to formally dissent.

**Historical precedent:** Common but minority outcome. Usually occurs when one regional Fed president has a different view on policy stance.

**Base rate:** 15-25% across reference classes

**Supporting factors:**
- Regional Fed presidents sometimes represent different economic perspectives
- Single dissents are culturally acceptable
- Precedent for "hawkish" or "dovish" dissenters

### Option: 2 Dissents
**What must be true:** Two members disagree with the decision, possibly for different reasons (one too hawkish, one too dovish, or both on same side).

**Historical precedent:** Relatively rare but not unprecedented. More common during periods of economic uncertainty or policy transition.

**Base rate:** 3-7% across reference classes

**Supporting factors:**
- Occasionally seen during major policy debates
- Can occur with split dissents (one hawk, one dove)

### Option: 3+ Dissents
**What must be true:** Three or more members formally dissent, indicating significant committee division.

**Historical precedent:** Very rare in modern FOMC history. Typically only occurs during extraordinary circumstances or major policy disagreements.

**Base rate:** 1-3% across reference classes

**Supporting factors:**
- Extremely rare in consensus-oriented culture
- Would suggest major policy disagreement or crisis conditions

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

**Weighting approach:**
- Reference Class 1 (All meetings 2000-2024): 40% weight
- Reference Class 2 (Post-2010): 35% weight
- Reference Class 3 (Transition periods): 15% weight
- Reference Class 4 (January meetings): 10% weight

**Integrated calculation:**

**0 Dissents:**
(0.73 × 0.40) + (0.78 × 0.35) + (0.63 × 0.15) + (0.78 × 0.10) = 0.292 + 0.273 + 0.095 + 0.078 = **73.8%**

**1 Dissent:**
(0.21 × 0.40) + (0.17 × 0.35) + (0.27 × 0.15) + (0.18 × 0.10) = 0.084 + 0.060 + 0.041 + 0.018 = **20.3%**

**2 Dissents:**
(0.05 × 0.40) + (0.04 × 0.35) + (0.08 × 0.15) + (0.04 × 0.10) = 0.020 + 0.014 + 0.012 + 0.004 = **5.0%**

**3+ Dissents:**
(0.01 × 0.40) + (0.01 × 0.35) + (0.02 × 0.15) + (0.00 × 0.10) = 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.003 + 0.000 = **1.1%**

**Rounded to sum to 100%:**

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Rating: 8/10**

**Justification:**
- Excellent historical data quality and availability
- Large sample size with consistent patterns
- Strong institutional continuity in FOMC voting culture
- Clear modal outcome with well-established base rates
- Multiple corroborating reference classes

**Limitations:**
- Cannot account for specific circumstances of January 2026
- Institutional culture could shift (though historically stable)
- Specific policy context unknown from outside view alone

---

**Distribution:**
0: 74%
1: 20%
2: 5%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 0 dissents (74%)

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Whether January 2026 falls during a policy transition period (which increases dissent probability)
- Composition of voting members at that specific meeting (rotates among regional Fed presidents)
- Potential changes in FOMC institutional culture or norms between now and 2026

**Reasoning:**
# Full Analysis: FOMC January 28, 2026 Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency Assessment:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026) - just 3-4 days before the actual meeting on January 28, 2026
- This is highly relevant timing, as these are pre-meeting analyses based on current positioning

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple independent financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN, 工商時報)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited (credible institutional forecaster)
- Consistent messaging across diverse sources suggests genuine consensus

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong; actual votes may differ from expectations
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than providing truly independent analysis
- Political pressure narrative may be overemphasized in media coverage

**Priced into Base Distribution?**
- The base distribution shows 74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent
- This appears to be historical base rates, NOT incorporating the specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent
- The current evidence appears to be NEW information not reflected in the base distribution

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

### STRONG Evidence

**Evidence 1: Multiple sources explicitly predict Bowman as sole dissenter**
- Favors: **1 dissent**
- Multiple independent outlets (Nomura, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan) specifically name Michelle Bowman
- Clear mechanism: Bowman advocating for rate cuts vs. majority preferring to hold
- Consistent across all sources with no contradictory reporting

**Evidence 2: Waller expected to align with majority despite earlier speculation**
- Favors: **1 dissent** (against 2+ dissents)
- Financial Post explicitly contrasts Bowman vs. Waller, noting Waller will vote with Powell
- Eliminates the most likely second dissenter candidate
- Reduces probability of 2+ dissents significantly

### MODERATE Evidence

**Evidence 3: Political pressure context**
- Favors: **1 dissent** (could theoretically increase dissents)
- Trump administration pressure for rate cuts creates environment for potential dissent
- However, sources suggest this pressure is actually strengthening unity among most FOMC members
- Net effect: supports the narrative of Bowman being isolated in her position

### WEAK Evidence

**Evidence 4: Historical pattern of Fed independence**
- Slightly favors: **0 dissents**
- Fed traditionally shows unity when facing political pressure
- However, this is contradicted by specific intelligence about Bowman's position
- Too general to override specific predictions

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**Option: 0 dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Historical base rate (74%), Fed unity under pressure
- Evidence against: STRONG - Multiple explicit predictions of Bowman dissent, no sources suggest 0 dissents
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 55-60%** (from 74% to ~15-20%)

**Option: 1 dissent**
- Evidence favoring: STRONG - Explicit predictions from multiple sources naming Bowman, Waller alignment eliminates second dissenter
- Evidence against: Base rate suggests this is less common historically
- Net adjustment: **INCREASE by 50-55%** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**Option: 2 dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Base rate of 5%, political pressure environment
- Evidence against: STRONG - Waller explicitly expected to align with majority, no second dissenter identified
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 3-4%** (from 5% to ~1-2%)

**Option: 3+ dissents**
- Evidence favoring: Only the base rate of 1%
- Evidence against: STRONG - No evidence of multiple dissenters, consensus appears strong
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 0.5-0.8%** (from 1% to ~0.2-0.5%)

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0 dissents: 74% → 17%
- 1 dissent: 20% → 72%
- 2 dissents: 5% → 2%
- 3+ dissents: 1% → 0.5%

Normalized (sum check: 91.5% → need to scale):
- Scaling factor needed, but close enough to adjust manually

Final integrated distribution:
- 0 dissents: 17%
- 1 dissent: 72%
- 2 dissents: 10%
- 3+ dissents: 1%

Wait - I need to reconsider the 2 dissents probability. While Waller is expected to align, the evidence isn't absolutely certain, and there could be other members. Let me be more conservative.

Revised:
- 0 dissents: 18%
- 1 dissent: 70%
- 2 dissents: 11%
- 3+ dissents: 1%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity Check:**
- 1 dissent at 70%: For me to be wrong, either (a) Bowman votes with majority contrary to all predictions, or (b) another member unexpectedly dissents
- 0 dissents at 18%: Bowman would need to change position or sources are all wrong
- These seem reasonable given evidence strength

**2. Base Rate Anchor:**
- Moving from 74% (0 dissents) to 18% is a large shift
- Justified because: (a) we have specific intelligence about this particular meeting, (b) multiple independent sources agree, (c) named individual with clear motivation
- This is NOT a historical average but a specific forecast

**3. Update Magnitude:**
- 50+ percentage point shift is large but warranted by STRONG evidence
- Multiple independent sources with specific predictions justify major update
- This is exactly the type of situation where inside information should override base rates

**4. Sum Check:**
18 + 70 + 11 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I'm evaluating this through the lens of current actors, incentives, and credible intelligence.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **Actor Identification:** Michelle Bowman has been explicitly identified by multiple credible sources as the likely sole dissenter. This isn't speculation - it's based on her known policy preferences and recent statements.

2. **Incentive Structure:** Bowman's incentive to dissent aligns with advocacy for rate cuts amid economic concerns. The Trump administration's pressure creates a political context, but most FOMC members appear to be rallying around Powell to demonstrate independence, which paradoxically isolates Bowman.

3. **Strength of Evidence:** The convergence of multiple independent sources (Nomura, major financial outlets across different regions) on the same specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter) is rare and highly informative. This is not typical pre-meeting speculation but appears to be based on actual intelligence about member positioning.

4. **Elimination of Alternatives:** The explicit statement that Waller will vote with the majority eliminates the most likely second dissenter, significantly reducing the probability of 2+ dissents.

5. **Recency and Relevance:** This intelligence is from 3-4 days before the meeting - recent enough to be highly relevant but allowing for last-minute changes.

**Risk Factors:**
- Bowman could change her position at the last minute
- An unexpected dissenter could emerge
- Sources could all be wrong (though unlikely given convergence)
- Political pressure could create unexpected dynamics

**Confidence Assessment:**
I have high confidence in this adjustment (8/10) because of the strength and convergence of evidence, though I maintain meaningful probability on 0 dissents (18%) and 2 dissents (11%) to account for uncertainty.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Bowman explicitly predicted as sole dissenter by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (contradicts specific predictions), 2+ dissents (Waller expected to align, no other dissenters identified)
- Net direction: Massive shift from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 18%
1: 70%
2: 11%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 dissent (70%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

# Analysis as Historian and Superforecaster

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:** The evidence is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026) - just 3-4 days before the January 28, 2026 meeting. This is highly relevant timing.

**Source Credibility:** 
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Consensus across independent sources

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation could be wrong
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than independent analysis
- Political narrative (Trump pressure) may be overemphasized

**Already Priced In?** 
The base distribution shows 74% for 0 dissents and 20% for 1 dissent. The current evidence strongly suggests 1 dissent is more likely, so this may NOT be fully priced into the base distribution.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (at least 5) specifically naming Michelle Bowman as expected sole dissenter, favoring **1 dissent**
- Explicit statement from Nomura economics team predicting Bowman as lone dissenter, favoring **1 dissent**
- Christopher Waller now expected to align with majority (not dissent), favoring **1 dissent** over higher numbers

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- Historical context: Political pressure on Fed during Trump administration creates conditions for dissent, favoring **1+ dissents**
- Timing: Pre-meeting analyses 3-4 days out have reasonable but not perfect predictive power, supporting **1 dissent**

**WEAK Evidence:**
- No sources mention possibility of 0 dissents as likely outcome (against **0 dissents**)
- No sources mention multiple dissenters beyond Bowman (against **2 or 3+ dissents**)

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None explicitly
- Evidence against: All sources predict at least Bowman will dissent; no source suggests consensus vote
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55%** (from 74% to ~20%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman; Nomura explicit prediction; Waller expected to align with majority
- Evidence against: None significant
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 50-55%** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: No second dissenter mentioned in any source; Waller specifically expected NOT to dissent
- Net adjustment: **Decrease slightly** (from 5% to ~4%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters
- Net adjustment: **Decrease slightly** (from 1% to ~1%)

## Step 4: Integration

Starting distribution:
- 0: 74%
- 1: 20%
- 2: 5%
- 3+: 1%

After adjustments:
- 0: 74% - 54% = 20%
- 1: 20% + 54% = 74%
- 2: 5% - 1% = 4%
- 3+: 1% + 0% = 1%

Sum check: 20 + 74 + 4 + 1 = 99% (need to adjust by 1%)

Final adjustment (add 1% to most likely):
- 0: 20%
- 1: 75%
- 2: 4%
- 3+: 1%

Sum: 100% ✓

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** 1 dissent at 75% - For me to be wrong, either: (a) Bowman changes position last-minute, (b) sources are all wrong about her stance, or (c) another member unexpectedly dissents or Bowman doesn't. These are plausible but unlikely given consensus reporting.

2. **Base rate anchor:** I've essentially flipped the base distribution between 0 and 1 dissents. This is justified because:
   - The base distribution may have been established before recent specific intelligence about Bowman
   - Multiple credible sources with specific names and reasoning support the flip
   - Historical precedent shows FOMC members do dissent when under political pressure

3. **Update magnitude:** A ~54 percentage point swing is large but justified by:
   - Multiple independent sources
   - Specific named individual (Bowman)
   - Very recent intelligence (3-4 days before meeting)
   - Clear reasoning provided (policy disagreement on rate cuts)

4. **Sum check:** 20 + 75 + 4 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Historical Perspective)

As a historian examining FOMC dissent patterns, several key factors inform my analysis:

**Historical Precedent for Single Dissents:**
Historically, single dissents at FOMC meetings are common when there are clear policy disagreements. During periods of political pressure on the Fed (notably during previous Trump administration 2017-2021), individual governors have dissented when they disagreed with the majority position. The pattern of one dissenter advocating for more dovish policy (rate cuts) while the majority maintains rates is well-established.

**Pattern Recognition:**
The current situation mirrors historical episodes where:
1. External political pressure exists (Trump calling for rate cuts)
2. One Fed governor aligns somewhat with that pressure for policy reasons
3. The Chair and majority maintain independence by holding steady
4. Result: One dissent, not zero (which would suggest the governor caved) or multiple (which would suggest institutional breakdown)

**Michelle Bowman's Historical Pattern:**
Looking at recent FOMC history, Bowman has shown willingness to dissent when she disagrees. This is consistent with her expected behavior.

**Why Not Zero Dissents?**
Historical analysis shows that when there's significant external pressure and clear policy disagreement, complete consensus is rare. The absence of any source predicting consensus, combined with named individual (Bowman) with clear policy rationale, makes 0 dissents unlikely.

**Why Not Multiple Dissents?**
Historically, multiple dissents occur when there's institutional crisis or fundamental disagreement on direction. Current evidence shows Waller (the other potential dissenter) is expected to align with Powell, suggesting institutional cohesion. Multiple dissents would be historically unusual without evidence of broader disagreement.

**Confidence Assessment:**
The convergence of multiple independent sources, specific named individual, clear policy rationale, and consistency with historical patterns of single dissents during politically charged periods gives me high confidence in this adjustment.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Michelle Bowman specifically named by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (no source predicts consensus; all predict Bowman dissent)
- Net direction: Probability mass shifted from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 75%
2: 4%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (75%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Prediction:** 74.0%
**Weight:** 0.8

**Reasoning:**
# Contrarian Analysis: FOMC Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:** The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026), just 3-4 days before the January 28, 2026 meeting. This is highly timely.

**Source Credibility:** 
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- However, these are pre-meeting predictions, not actual votes

**Potential Biases:**
- **Critical contrarian insight:** The narrative is TOO clean and TOO consensus. When every source agrees on exactly one dissenter (Bowman), this suggests groupthink or a single analyst note being recycled.
- The political pressure angle (Trump administration) creates a compelling story that journalists love, potentially overshadowing actual monetary policy considerations
- Pre-meeting predictions often miss surprises because they're based on public statements, not private deliberations

**Already Priced In?**
The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1) suggests the "outside view" already expects dissents to be rare. The current narrative strongly favors exactly 1 dissent, but the base rate still heavily favors 0.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Historical base rate of 0 dissents**: The 74% base probability reflects that most FOMC meetings have no dissents. This is the strongest evidence we have.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources predict Bowman dissent**: Several outlets cite Bowman as likely dissenter, advocating for rate cuts. However, these appear to be echoing similar analyst predictions rather than independent analysis.
- **Political pressure context**: Trump administration pressure creates unusual circumstances that could provoke dissents, but could also unite the committee in showing independence.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **Waller expected to align with Powell**: This is speculative prediction based on positioning, not actual votes
- **"No other members mentioned"**: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - this is a key contrarian insight

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: 
  - Strong historical base rate (74%)
  - Political pressure might UNITE the committee to show solidarity with Powell
  - Pre-meeting predictions are often wrong
  - The consensus narrative being so strong suggests overconfidence
- Evidence against:
  - Multiple sources predict Bowman dissent
  - Unusual political circumstances
- Net adjustment: **INCREASE by 4%** (contrarian view: consensus is overconfident about Bowman)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring:
  - Multiple sources specifically name Bowman
  - Political context creates pressure for some differentiation
- Evidence against:
  - TOO much consensus in predictions (red flag)
  - If Bowman dissents, why wouldn't others with similar views?
  - Base rate suggests dissents are rare
- Net adjustment: **INCREASE by 2%** (still most likely given evidence, but less than consensus suggests)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring:
  - If political pressure is real, multiple members might dissent
  - Bowman might not be alone - others could join her
  - The narrative ignores potential hawks who might dissent the OTHER direction
  - Historical precedent: when there are dissents, sometimes multiple members join
- Evidence against:
  - No sources mention a second likely dissenter
- Net adjustment: **INCREASE by 2%** (contrarian: what if there's a hawk dissenter too?)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring:
  - Extreme political pressure could fracture consensus
  - Black swan scenario
- Evidence against:
  - Very rare historically
  - No evidence for this
- Net adjustment: **DECREASE by 0%** (remains at 1%, already accounts for tail risk)

## Step 4: Integration

Starting distribution:
- 0: 74%
- 1: 20%
- 2: 5%
- 3+: 1%

Adjustments (redistributing 6% from 0 and 1 to other options):
- 0: 74% - 10% = **64%**
- 1: 20% + 12% = **32%**
- 2: 5% + 3% = **8%**
- 3+: 1% + 0% = **1%**

Wait, let me recalculate more carefully with my contrarian lens:

The consensus narrative is SO strong for "1 dissent" that I need to push back harder. But the evidence IS real. My contrarian adjustment should:
1. Reduce confidence in the consensus "1" outcome
2. Increase probability of surprise "0" outcome (solidarity prevails)
3. Modestly increase "2" (hidden dissenter emerges)

Revised:
- 0: 74% - 6% = **68%**
- 1: 20% + 4% = **24%**
- 2: 5% + 2% = **7%**
- 3+: 1% + 0% = **1%**

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** No option is extreme. 0 dissents at 68% could be wrong if Bowman really does dissent as predicted, but 32% captures that risk.

2. **Base rate anchor:** I'm staying relatively close to the base (moving only 6% from 0 to other options), which is appropriate given the evidence is all predictive, not actual votes.

3. **Update magnitude:** My adjustments are modest (6% total shift), appropriate for moderate-strength predictive evidence that might be overconfident.

4. **Sum check:** 68 + 24 + 7 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

**Contrarian Perspective:**

The consensus narrative is dangerously clean: "Bowman will be the sole dissenter." This is exactly the kind of story that sounds authoritative but often misses reality. Here's what the consensus might be missing:

1. **Committee solidarity effect**: When under external political pressure, committees often rally around the chair. The Trump pressure might actually REDUCE dissents as members show united front.

2. **Hidden hawks**: The narrative focuses entirely on dovish dissents (Bowman wanting cuts). But what if there are hawks who think rates should stay higher? The political story drowns out normal monetary policy disagreements.

3. **Pre-meeting predictions are notoriously unreliable**: Members' public positioning before meetings doesn't always match their actual votes. Bowman might ultimately vote with the majority.

4. **The "no other dissenters mentioned" problem**: Just because analysts don't predict other dissenters doesn't mean they won't appear. Surprises happen.

5. **Base rate wisdom**: 74% of meetings have zero dissents for a reason - consensus-building is the Fed's norm. We need strong evidence to deviate significantly from this.

My contrarian adjustment: I'm giving MORE weight to the base rate than the consensus narrative suggests, while acknowledging the evidence for Bowman's dissent is real. The most likely outcome shifts from 0 to 1, but not as dramatically as the news consensus implies.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 0 dissents (historical base rate, committee solidarity under pressure)
- Strong evidence against: None definitively
- Net direction: Modest shift toward 1 dissent, but maintaining significant probability for 0

**Distribution:**
0: 68%
1: 24%
2: 7%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 0 dissents (68%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 6/10

The contrarian view is that the consensus narrative about Bowman's dissent is overconfident. While it's plausible, the base rate of committee solidarity and the potential for external pressure to unite rather than divide the FOMC suggests we should remain anchored closer to the historical norm of zero dissents.

- Multiple news sources from January 24-25, 2026
- This is highly recent and relevant information

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple independent financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Cryptopolitan, Financial Post, UDN)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Mix of established financial journalism and analysis

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation could be wrong
- Sources may be echoing each other rather than providing independent analysis
- Political pressure narrative may be overemphasized in media

**Already Priced In?**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- Current specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent is likely NOT fully priced into this generic base rate

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources naming Bowman as sole dissenter**: At least 5 independent sources ([2][3][6][9][10]) specifically identify Michelle Bowman as the expected dissenter, with Nomura explicitly stating she will be the "only dissenter among 12 voting members." This strongly favors **1 dissent**.
- **Waller expected to align with majority**: Multiple sources ([2][6][9]) indicate Christopher Waller, previously seen as potential dissenter, will vote with Powell. This reduces probability of 2+ dissents.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Clear policy rationale**: Bowman's dissent is based on advocating for rate cuts amid political pressure, providing a logical mechanism. Favors **1 dissent**.
- **No other dissenters mentioned**: Comprehensive coverage mentions no other potential dissenters among the 12 voting members. Favors **1 dissent** over **2+**.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **Caveat about pre-meeting analysis**: Sources acknowledge actual votes may differ when cast. Creates uncertainty around all predictions.
- **Political pressure context**: Unusual political environment could theoretically create additional dissenters not anticipated. Slight increase to uncertainty.

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence against: Multiple strong sources predicting Bowman dissent
- Evidence favoring: General acknowledgment predictions could be wrong
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55 percentage points** (from 74% to ~19-24%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman specifically; Nomura explicit forecast; no other dissenters identified
- Evidence against: Pre-meeting uncertainty caveat
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 45-50 percentage points** (from 20% to ~65-70%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any source; Waller expected to align with majority
- Evidence favoring: Political pressure environment creates some tail risk
- Net adjustment: **Slight increase** (from 5% to ~8-10%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters; comprehensive coverage identifies only Bowman
- Evidence favoring: Black swan political scenarios
- Net adjustment: **Minimal change** (from 1% to ~2-3%)

## Step 4: Integration

Starting distribution:
- 0: 74.0%
- 1: 20.0%
- 2: 5.0%
- 3+: 1.0%

Quantitative adjustments based on evidence strength:

The evidence strongly supports a shift from the historical baseline (0 dissents most common) to the specific forecast for this meeting (1 dissent expected). The strength of multiple independent sources with specific individual identification justifies a major reweighting.

Proposed distribution:
- 0: 20% (strong evidence against, but maintaining probability for forecast error)
- 1: 68% (strong convergent evidence)
- 2: 10% (slight increase for political uncertainty)
- 3+: 2% (minimal increase for tail risk)

Sum check: 20 + 68 + 10 + 2 = 100% ✓

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity check:**
- No option <5% or >95%, so not at extremes
- For 1 dissent (68%) to be wrong: Bowman would need to change position, or additional unexpected dissenters would need to emerge, or no dissent would occur despite multiple forecasts

**2. Base rate anchor:**
- Large deviation from base (74% → 20% for 0 dissents) justified by:
  - Specific, named individual expected to dissent
  - Multiple independent confirmatory sources
  - Clear policy rationale
  - This is meeting-specific intelligence vs. historical average

**3. Update magnitude:**
- ~48 percentage point shift from 0 to 1 dissent
- Justified by STRONG evidence classification with multiple independent sources
- Maintains 20% residual on 0 dissents to account for forecast uncertainty

**4. Sum check:** 20 + 68 + 10 + 2 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Quantitative Perspective)

As a quantitative analyst, I focus on the data:

**Historical Base Rate Context:**
The base distribution of 74% for zero dissents likely reflects historical FOMC voting patterns where consensus is common. However, this is a generic baseline.

**Meeting-Specific Data:**
The current intelligence represents a significant information advantage over the base rate:
- **N=5+ independent sources** identifying the same individual (Bowman) as dissenter
- **Specificity**: Not just "likely dissent" but named individual with policy rationale
- **Negative evidence**: Comprehensive coverage identifies NO other likely dissenters
- **Waller data point**: Previously potential dissenter now expected to vote with majority

**Quantitative Adjustment Logic:**
Using Bayesian reasoning, the prior (base distribution) should be updated significantly when:
1. Multiple independent observations converge
2. Specific mechanisms are identified
3. Coverage is comprehensive (reducing unknown unknowns)

All three conditions are met here.

**Risk Factors:**
- **Forecast error rate**: Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong (~20-30% residual probability)
- **Political volatility**: Unusual environment adds tail risk to 2+ dissents
- **Information lag**: 3 days before meeting allows position changes

**Probability Calibration:**
- 68% for 1 dissent reflects high confidence from convergent sources while maintaining humility about forecast uncertainty
- 20% for 0 dissents accounts for meaningful probability of forecast error or last-minute position changes
- 10% for 2 dissents reflects political uncertainty creating small probability of additional unexpected dissenter
- 2% for 3+ dissents maintains minimal tail risk probability

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: **1 dissent** (multiple independent sources naming Bowman specifically)
- Strong evidence against: **0 dissents** (contradicts multiple forecasts), **2+ dissents** (no other dissenters identified)
- Net direction: Major probability shift from 0 dissents to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 68%
2: 10%
3+: 2%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 dissent (68%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

The high confidence reflects multiple independent sources with specific individual identification, though I maintain 2 points of uncertainty due to the inherent unpredictability of individual voting behavior and the 3-day gap before the actual meeting.

**Reasoning:**
# Comprehensive Analysis: FOMC January 28, 2026 Dissenting Votes

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026), just 3-4 days before the actual meeting
- This is highly relevant timing for forecasting FOMC votes

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan)
- Explicit mention of Nomura's economics team (a major financial institution)
- Cross-referenced reporting from different geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, Taiwan)

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong even when consensus-driven
- Sources may be interpreting similar analyst reports rather than independent intelligence
- Political pressure narrative may be emphasized for newsworthiness

**Already Priced In?**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- The specific intelligence about Bowman's expected dissent is NOT reflected in the base distribution
- This represents NEW, material information

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent sources naming Michelle Bowman as expected sole dissenter**: This is reported across at least 4-5 different outlets, with specific attribution to Nomura economists. The convergence of independent reporting strongly suggests this is well-sourced market consensus. **Favors: 1 dissent**
- **Explicit statement that Christopher Waller will vote with majority**: Previously considered a potential dissenter, multiple sources now indicate he will align with Powell. This reduces the probability of multiple dissents. **Favors: 1 dissent, Against: 2+ dissents**

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Consensus expectation for rate hold**: When there's broad agreement on the policy direction (maintaining rates), dissents become more predictable. The fact that markets expect a hold with one known dissenter suggests limited uncertainty. **Favors: 1 dissent**
- **Political pressure context**: The Trump administration pressure creates an environment where some dissent is likely, but the specific nature (Bowman wanting cuts) is well-telegraphed. **Favors: 1 dissent over 0**

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **"May dissent" language**: Some sources use conditional language ("may dissent") rather than definitive predictions, suggesting some residual uncertainty. **Slightly increases uncertainty across all options**
- **Pre-meeting timing caveat**: Analysts acknowledge actual votes may differ from predictions. **Increases baseline uncertainty**

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None directly
- Evidence against: Multiple sources explicitly predict Bowman will dissent; political environment makes some dissent likely
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 50-55 percentage points** (from 74% to ~20%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman; Waller expected to align with majority; Nomura explicit prediction; no other dissenters mentioned
- Evidence against: Conditional language in some reports; pre-meeting uncertainty
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 50-55 percentage points** (from 20% to ~70-75%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: General uncertainty; possibility of surprise dissenter
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any reporting; Waller explicitly expected to vote with majority
- Net adjustment: **Slight increase** (from 5% to ~8-10%) to account for unknown unknowns

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: Extreme political pressure scenario
- Evidence against: No evidence of multiple potential dissenters; consensus on policy direction
- Net adjustment: **Minimal change** (from 1% to ~2%) - very unlikely but not impossible

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0: 74% → 20%
- 1: 20% → 72%
- 2: 5% → 7%
- 3+: 1% → 1%

Check: 20 + 72 + 7 + 1 = 100% ✓

The relative ordering makes sense: strong consensus for 1 dissent, with 0 dissents as second most likely (if Bowman changes position or analysts are wrong), and small probabilities for multiple dissents.

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity check:**
- 1 dissent at 72%: For this to be wrong, either (a) Bowman votes with majority despite multiple analyst predictions, or (b) additional unexpected dissenters emerge
- Both scenarios are plausible but less likely than the consensus prediction

**2. Base rate anchor:**
- Moving from 74% (0 dissents) to 72% (1 dissent) is a major shift
- Justified because: The base rate appears generic/historical, while we have specific, recent intelligence about this particular meeting
- The shift reflects incorporation of meeting-specific information

**3. Update magnitude:**
- ~50 percentage point swing is large but proportional to STRONG evidence (multiple independent sources, specific names, recent timing)
- Not moving to >85% for 1 dissent because of conditional language and pre-meeting uncertainty

**4. Sum check:**
- 20 + 72 + 7 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Synthesizer Role)

As a synthesizer integrating multiple perspectives and identifying key uncertainties, my assessment is:

**Key Insight:** The convergence of multiple independent sources on a specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter) represents a rare case where meeting-specific intelligence substantially overrides historical base rates.

**Critical Factors Identified:**
1. **Consensus specificity**: Not just predicting "likely dissent" but naming the specific individual (Bowman) and explaining the rationale (favoring rate cuts)
2. **Elimination of alternatives**: Waller explicitly expected to vote with majority, removing the most likely alternative dissenter
3. **Recency and relevance**: Intelligence from 3-4 days before the meeting with no contradictory information

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. **Last-minute position changes**: FOMC members could shift views based on final deliberations
2. **Unknown dissenters**: Someone not mentioned in reporting could dissent
3. **Analyst error**: Market consensus predictions can be wrong

**Balanced View:**
The evidence strongly favors 1 dissent, but I'm maintaining meaningful probability on 0 dissents (~20%) because:
- Pre-meeting predictions have inherent uncertainty
- Bowman could ultimately vote with the majority
- The political pressure might lead to unity

I'm keeping modest probability on 2+ dissents (~8%) for unknown unknowns, though no evidence supports this scenario.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (Bowman named by multiple sources)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (consensus expects Bowman dissent); 2+ dissents (no second dissenter identified)
- Net direction: 1 dissent gained ~52 percentage points

**Distribution:**
0: 20%
1: 72%
2: 7%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (72%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

The high confidence reflects strong, convergent evidence from multiple sources with specific details, tempered by the inherent uncertainty of pre-meeting predictions.

# Full Analysis: FOMC Dissenting Votes Forecast

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Recency:**
- The research is extremely recent (January 24-25, 2026), just 3-4 days before the January 28, 2026 meeting
- This is highly relevant timing for pre-meeting predictions

**Source Credibility:**
- Multiple financial news outlets (Valor Econômico, Financial Post, UDN, Cryptopolitan)
- Nomura economics team explicitly cited
- Mix of international sources suggesting independent verification
- These are professional financial analysts making specific predictions

**Potential Biases:**
- Pre-meeting speculation always carries uncertainty
- Sources may be relying on similar analyst reports
- Political context (Trump pressure) may be influencing narrative
- No direct quotes from FOMC members themselves

**Already Priced In:**
- The base distribution (74% for 0 dissents, 20% for 1 dissent) appears to be a general historical baseline
- This specific, recent intelligence about Bowman as expected dissenter is likely NOT priced into the base distribution
- The base distribution seems to reflect historical patterns, not this specific meeting's dynamics

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources predicting exactly 1 dissent (Bowman)**: At least 5 independent sources ([2][3][6][9][10]) specifically name Michelle Bowman as the expected sole dissenter. This convergence across sources is significant.
- **Nomura economics team explicit forecast**: Professional forecasters explicitly stating "Bowman will be the only dissenter among the 12 voting members" provides institutional credibility.
- **Specific policy rationale identified**: Bowman advocating for rate cuts vs. majority favoring hold provides clear mechanism for dissent.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- **Waller expected to align with majority**: Multiple sources note Waller, despite earlier speculation, will vote with Powell. This reduces probability of 2+ dissents.
- **Political pressure context**: Trump administration pressure creates environment for potential dissent, but also incentive for Fed to show unity.
- **No other dissenters mentioned**: Absence of speculation about other potential dissenters suggests 0 or 1 dissent most likely.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- **Timing uncertainty caveat**: Sources acknowledge actual vote may differ from predictions.
- **Historical patterns**: Not explicitly discussed in research but implied by base distribution.

## Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: General Fed preference for consensus, political pressure might encourage unity
- Evidence against: 5+ sources specifically predicting Bowman will dissent, clear policy disagreement identified
- Net adjustment: **Decrease by 45-50%** (from 74% to ~25-30%)

**1 Dissent:**
- Evidence favoring: Multiple independent sources naming Bowman, Nomura explicit forecast, clear policy rationale, Waller expected to vote with majority
- Evidence against: Pre-meeting predictions could be wrong, Bowman might align at last minute
- Net adjustment: **Increase by 45-50%** (from 20% to ~65-70%)

**2 Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: Political environment could create additional dissent
- Evidence against: No second dissenter identified in any source, Waller specifically expected to align with majority
- Net adjustment: **Slight decrease** (from 5% to ~3-4%)

**3+ Dissents:**
- Evidence favoring: None identified
- Evidence against: No sources suggest multiple dissenters, would require multiple members to break from consensus unexpectedly
- Net adjustment: **Maintain or slight decrease** (from 1% to ~1%)

## Step 4: Integration

Initial adjustments:
- 0: 74% → 26%
- 1: 20% → 68%
- 2: 5% → 4%
- 3+: 1% → 1%

Sum check: 26 + 68 + 4 + 1 = 99%

Adjustment to reach 100%:
- 0: 26%
- 1: 69%
- 2: 4%
- 3+: 1%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

**1. Extremity Check:**
- 1 dissent at 69% is high but not extreme
- For me to be wrong: Bowman would need to change position, or predictions would need to be systematically biased
- This is plausible (maybe 25-30% chance), which aligns with keeping 0 dissents at 26%

**2. Base Rate Anchor:**
- Large deviation from base (74% → 26% for 0 dissents)
- Justified because: Base appears to be historical average, not meeting-specific intelligence
- Multiple independent recent sources provide specific, credible prediction for THIS meeting

**3. Update Magnitude:**
- ~48% swing from 0 to 1 dissent is large
- Proportional to STRONG evidence: multiple independent sources, explicit institutional forecast, clear mechanism
- Meeting is in 3 days, so this is late-breaking, highly relevant information

**4. Sum Check:**
- 26 + 69 + 4 + 1 = 100% ✓

## Step 6: Final Reasoning (Panshul42 Inside View)

As a superforecaster using the Panshul42 Q2 winner methodology, I focus on:

1. **Specific, recent intelligence over general base rates**: The base distribution appears to reflect historical patterns (most FOMC meetings have 0 dissents). However, we have multiple credible sources from January 24-25, 2026—just days before the meeting—providing specific predictions about THIS particular meeting.

2. **Convergence of independent sources**: When 5+ independent sources (including professional forecasters like Nomura) converge on the same specific prediction (Bowman as sole dissenter), this represents strong signal over noise.

3. **Clear causal mechanism**: The research identifies a specific policy disagreement (rate cuts vs. hold) and specific political context (Trump pressure). This isn't vague speculation—it's a concrete reason for dissent.

4. **Process of elimination**: The research specifically addresses potential alternative dissenters (Waller) and explains why they're expected to align with the majority. This strengthens the "exactly 1" prediction.

5. **Appropriate uncertainty**: While the evidence strongly favors 1 dissent, I maintain meaningful probability (~26%) for 0 dissents because:
   - Pre-meeting predictions can be wrong
   - Bowman could align at the last minute
   - Fed members value consensus and may compromise

6. **Conservative on tails**: I keep 2 and 3+ dissents low because no evidence suggests additional dissenters, though I don't eliminate them entirely given political uncertainty.

The key insight is that we're not forecasting a generic FOMC meeting—we have specific, credible, recent intelligence about this particular meeting that justifies substantial departure from the historical base rate.

---

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1 dissent (multiple independent sources, Nomura forecast, specific dissenter named)
- Strong evidence against: 0 dissents (convergent predictions of Bowman dissent)
- Net direction: Probability mass shifted from 0 to 1 dissent

**Distribution:**
0: 26%
1: 69%
2: 4%
3+: 1%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (69%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10
