Three central banks\u2014Brazil, Canada, and Sweden\u2014that have publicly expressed 'full solidarity' with Fed Chair Jerome Powell are also likely to keep monetary conditions unchanged. This alignment follows statements from over a dozen central bank leaders, including those from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, who have defended the independence of monetary authorities during a period of heightened political scrutiny. The Fed faces additional challenges, including a grand jury subpoena threatening criminal charges and a Supreme Court case assessing whether the president can remove Fed Director Lisa Cook. Globally, central banks operate in a tense environment marked by Japan's recent market collapse, concerns over Trump\u2019s plans for Greenland, and ongoing threats of trade disruptions. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that 'we are no longer in Kansas,' highlighting increased global volatility. Economists Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, Alex Tanzi, and Troy Durie note that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members are likely to justify maintaining rates based on data, with a consensus seen as a show of support for Powell. They anticipate that directors Christopher Waller will vote with the majority to uphold rates, signaling alignment with Powell and the Fed\u2019s independence, while Michelle Bowman may dissent. Meanwhile, central banks remain vigilant about inflationary pressures amid risks to growth from tariffs. Next week, 18 central banks worldwide will make decisions, with African central banks potentially pursuing monetary easing due to differing economic cycles.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 04:19 PM\nSource: [Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/financas/noticia/2026/01/25/sob-tensao-fed-deve-manter-juros-inalterados-e-liderar-pares-globais.ghtml)\n\n**FOMC Meeting Ahead: Fed Expected to Hold Rates Steady as Next Chair Contenders\u2019 Votes Draw Attention**\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to hold its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 27\u201328, 2026, and maintain interest rates within the 3.5\u20133.75% range, despite pressure from U.S. President Trump to lower borrowing costs. This decision is seen as a demonstration of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy independence. Other central banks, including those of Canada, Brazil, and Sweden, are also expected to keep rates unchanged. Recent U.S. data show a declining unemployment rate in December, but inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s target, supporting the case for maintaining current rates. Economists anticipate that most FOMC members will vote to hold rates steady, signaling confidence in Chair Jerome Powell. Key attention will focus on the votes of Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, both considered top contenders for the next Fed chair. Waller is expected to support the majority, while Bowman may dissent. Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference will be his first public appearance following the Justice Department subpoena and the Supreme Court Cook hearing, though no new details are expected. The Bank of Canada is also expected to keep its rate at 2.25% on January 28, with its policy report likely highlighting slowing economic growth and heightened uncertainty from the USMCA review. Traders anticipate that Canada\u2019s rate will remain unchanged through most of 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 01:44 PM\nSource: [\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260125700625-430701)\n\n**Global Central Banks Unite to Maintain Stable Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve and four other central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB), are collectively committed to maintaining stable interest rates amid growing political pressure. This stance is particularly significant as former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for his cautious approach to lowering interest rates, while also facing legal challenges, including a grand jury subpoena and a Supreme Court review over his attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In response, central banks worldwide, including those in Brazil, Canada, Sweden, and several African nations, are reinforcing their independence and coordinating efforts to resist political interference. Analysts expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain current interest rates at its February 28, 2026, meeting, citing data that supports continuity. Key figures such as Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman are expected to influence this decision, with Waller likely aligning with the majority and Bowman possibly dissenting. Meanwhile, global economic concerns persist, including Japan\u2019s recent stock market crash, rising investor tensions due to Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland and threats to international trade, and mixed inflation data from Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, and Europe. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the global economy is increasingly vulnerable to sudden shifts. While African central banks may pursue loosening measures, the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged through the end of 2025, allowing time to assess the impact of prior rate cuts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:30 AM\nSource: [Cryptopolitan - German](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/de/fed-and-key-banks-set-to-stand-pat-on-rates/)\n\n**The Stock Market Is Facing a Federal Reserve Double Whammy in 2026 -- and Things May Get Ugly for Wall Street**\nThe stock market faces a potential 'double whammy' in 2026 due to historic division within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the impending end of Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chair on May 15, 2026. The S&P 500 has posted three consecutive years of gains of at least 16%, driven by AI innovation, strong corporate earnings, and the tax incentives from the Trump administration\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Investors have also anticipated further rate cuts in 2026 to stimulate economic growth. However, the FOMC has shown unprecedented disagreement in recent meetings: two of the last three meetings featured dissenting votes in opposite directions\u2014some members favored rate cuts, while others opposed any reduction or advocated for larger cuts. Since 1990, only three such meetings with opposing dissents have occurred, and two have happened within the last three months, signaling deep internal conflict. This lack of consensus undermines confidence in an already expensive market, as the S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio is at its second-highest level in 155 years. With President Donald Trump expected to nominate a new Fed chair, concerns grow over a potential shift toward aggressive rate cuts, which could deepen FOMC divisions and threaten market stability.

Amid increasing pressure from former U.S. President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve has urged Washington officials to prioritize this goal. Officials are expected to reaffirm this stance at the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday, January 28, 2026. Analysts anticipate that central banks in countries such as Brazil, Canada, and Sweden will likely maintain current interest rates due to prevailing economic conditions. The Federal Reserve faced a tense moment as Trump intensified demands regarding its recent cautious approach to rate cuts. According to informed sources\u2014whose identities were withheld due to the confidential nature of discussions\u2014three central banks collaborated with over twelve other institutions, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which have shown strong support for the Fed\u2019s independence. This cooperation underscores the importance of central bank autonomy amid mounting political pressure from Washington. Reports indicate that in addition to Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of the Fed\u2019s cautious stance, the central bank is currently facing subpoenas from a major grand jury, suggesting a potential for criminal charges. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed arguments on whether Trump could proceed with his intent to remove Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook. In response to this crisis, central banks worldwide adopted a coordinated strategic approach to counter growing international pressures. Despite this, they remain concerned about global challenges, including the recent collapse of Japan\u2019s stock market, rising investor tensions due to Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, and escalating threats to global trade flows. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, warned during the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world has become more vulnerable to sudden changes. Analysts believe that most members of the Federal Open Market Committee will find data supporting the status quo in the upcoming meeting. This consensus would signal support for Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced criticism from the White House. The two key figures to watch are Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman: if they join the majority in voting to maintain rates unchanged, it would indicate their backing for Powell and the Fed\u2019s independence. Waller is expected to align with the majority, but Bowman may dissent. Policymakers, despite concerns about the negative impact of tariffs on economic expansion, continue to monitor potential inflationary pressures. The outcome of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision remains uncertain, with an upcoming meeting involving 18 central banks worldwide. Analysts expect African central banks to adopt a different approach than the Fed, supporting new easing measures as they adapt to changing economic conditions. Key indicators to watch include inflation reports from Australia to Brazil and Japan, Chinese industrial profits, and European GDP data. Analysts project that the Fed will keep rates steady after implementing three consecutive cuts by late 2025. Powell is expected to suggest that current policy remains appropriate, though he will not disclose future changes. This approach allows officials to assess the economic impact of previous rate cuts before making further decisions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:30 AM\nSource: [Cryptopolitan - Arabic](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ar/fed-and-key-banks-set-to-stand-pat-on-rates/)\n\n**The Stock Market Is Facing a Federal Reserve Double Whammy in 2026 -- and Things May Get Ugly for Wall Street**\nThe stock market faces a potential 'double whammy' in 2026 due to historic division within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the impending end of Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chair on May 15, 2026.

Fed's Major Meeting Approaches as U.S. Stocks Brace for 'Super Storm Week'**\nThe U.S. stock market is approaching a 'super storm week' as the Federal Reserve is set to hold its key interest rate decision meeting on January 27\u201328, 2026, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expected to announce its decision on January 29. Market consensus, according to CME's Fed Watch, indicates a 95.6% probability of holding rates steady at the 3.50%\u20133.75% range, with only a 4.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut. This marks a shift from earlier expectations, as 58% of 100 surveyed economists now anticipate no rate cuts in the first quarter, up from previous forecasts of at least one cut in March. The focus will center on the number of dissenting votes and the accompanying statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which will signal future policy direction. According to HSBC economists, Powell is expected to emphasize that future rate decisions will depend on evolving economic data. Jeremy Schwartz, a senior U.S. economist at Nomura, noted that while economic fundamentals suggest a potential pause or even a future rate hike, the Fed may remain on hold until Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026. He further predicted that a new Fed leadership could initiate another 50 basis points of rate cuts later in 2026. Political interference is also a growing concern: a criminal investigation into Powell, efforts by former President Trump to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, and potential presidential appointments for the next Fed chair\u2014especially with a Supreme Court hearing pending\u2014have introduced significant uncertainty. Oxford Economics\u2019 chief U.S. economist Bernard Yaros warned that political turbulence could hinder the appointment of a Fed chair aligned with dovish monetary policy. Simultaneously, the 'super earnings week' begins, with about one-fifth of the S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and Amazon, releasing earnings. The central theme of this quarter is whether tech giants are beginning to monetize their AI investments. Goldman Sachs forecasts Apple\u2019s Q1 2026 revenue at $137.4 billion (up 11% YoY), driven by iPhone sales expected to reach $78 billion (up 13% YoY), with EPS of $2.66 and a stable gross margin of 47.7%. For Tesla, investor focus has shifted from traditional metrics to progress in Robotaxi, full self-driving, Optimus humanoid robot, and the AI5 chip. Morgan Stanley predicts Tesla\u2019s 2026 vehicle deliveries at 1.6 million units\u20149% below the market consensus and down 2.5% YoY\u2014and expects updates on AI5 chip development, AI6+, and Dojo supercomputer projects during the earnings call. Additionally, semiconductor giants Samsung and SK Hynix will report earnings, with AI-driven demand and semiconductor cycles expected to be key themes.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 08:45 AM\nSource: [\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qChNaGqg2C)\n\n**Despite Trump Pressure, Federal Reserve Leads Global Peers in Keeping Rates Unchanged**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, along with three central banks that recently supported its chair, is expected to maintain interest rates unchanged amid a tense global monetary policy environment.

Trump's push for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, despite rising inflation risks from tariff increases, raises concerns about political interference. While the Federal Reserve Act has not been amended and the Fed's legal independence remains intact, the persistent public attacks and legal actions against Powell\u2014such as criminal proceedings over renovation costs\u2014signal growing political pressure. Although the FOMC\u2019s voting structure ensures that policy decisions are not dictated by a single individual, historical precedent shows that Fed members can internalize political pressure, as seen during the 1970s inflation crisis. The current dilemma involves balancing inflation control (targeting 2%) against slowing growth, with the Fed facing conflicting demands. Despite Trump\u2019s influence, the gradual renewal of FOMC members and the need for consensus limit immediate shifts in policy. However, undermining the Fed\u2019s credibility through politicization is not a sound strategy for economic coordination, even if better inter-agency alignment is needed.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 03:05 AM\nSource: [Alternatives Economiques](https://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/lindependance-de-reserve-federale-menacee/00117565)\n\n**Navigating the Trump-Powell feud**\nThe feud between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve, particularly targeting Fed Chair Jerome Powell, has escalated to a critical point, with the Department of Justice issuing subpoenas and raising the possibility of a criminal indictment\u2014a first in U.S. history. Powell responded with a video message framing the investigation as a direct threat to the Fed\u2019s independence, warning that monetary policy must be based on evidence, not political pressure. A bipartisan group of former Fed chairs\u2014including Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and Janet Yellen\u2014issued a statement condemning the 'prosecutorial attacks' as incompatible with the rule of law, calling central-bank independence a cornerstone of economic stability. Internationally, central-bank governors from the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and European Central Bank jointly affirmed solidarity with Powell, a rare move that defied norms of non-interference. New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister rebuked its central-bank governor for overstepping. Domestically, some U.S. legislators have threatened to block confirmation of any new Fed board nominees\u2014including a successor to Powell\u2014until the conflict resolves, risking a 'fortress Fed' and potential overreaction in policy. Experts warn this could undermine 'political flexibility' and lead to unanchored inflation expectations, macroeconomic instability, and financial volatility. Despite these risks, internal checks\u2014such as the individual voting power on the Federal Open Market Committee and deep institutional memory of the 1970s inflation crisis\u2014help maintain stability. Market discipline, exemplified by the bond-market reaction to Liz Truss\u2019s brief UK premiership, also acts as a constraint. The article concludes that while the situation is serious, de-escalation is feasible through a negotiated 'off-ramp' for both Trump and Powell, urging a constructive path forward to reinforce Fed independence, accountability, and strategic policy reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource: [The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/navigating-the-trump-powell-feud/4115236/)\n\n**Fed Cuts Key Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points with Three Dissenting Votes**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points for the third consecutive time, maintaining its projection of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 9 to 3 in favor of reducing the target range to 3.5% to 3.75%. This decision marks the third consecutive rate cut, with three members dissenting. The announcement was reported by Michael McKee from Washington.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource: [de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/fed-senkt-leitzins-um-25-basispunkte-bei-drei-gegenstimmen-ce7d50dada8bfe21)\n\n**Today's Rate Decision Could Bring More Dissents**\nToday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision is expected to feature at least one dissenting vote, highlighting ongoing disagreement between the FOMC's hawks and doves. Fed Governor Stephen Miran is the most likely dissenter, having voted against the committee's action in the previous two meetings. Miran has consistently advocated for larger rate cuts, proposing a half-percentage-point reduction in the federal-funds rate, in contrast to the quarter-point cuts approved in the last two meetings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource: [Barrons](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-december-interest-rate-cut-decision/card/today-s-rate-decision-could-bring-more-dissents-qbthwZWLIcBjOyarbIhc?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo)\n\n**FOMC Preview: Hawkish Cut?**\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, December 9, 2025, is anticipated to feature a 25 basis point interest rate cut, with markets pricing in a 90% probability of this outcome. Despite the strong consensus, a hawkish surprise\u2014such as a hold on rates or a less dovish tone\u2014could trigger significant market volatility. Futures markets currently expect a pause in January followed by 100 bps of rate cuts in 2026. The Fed\u2019s updated 'dot-plot'\u2014which reflects FOMC members\u2019 projections for future rates\u2014will be closely watched; if it shows fewer cuts than the market\u2019s expectation of four (100 bps), it may be interpreted as hawkish. The vote split is another key factor: dissenting votes, such as those from Governor Stephen Miran (favoring easing) and Jeffrey Schmid (favoring a hold), have become more frequent since Trump\u2019s appointment of Miran, and increased dissent could signal internal division. Additionally, the language in the accompanying monetary policy statement will influence market sentiment\u2014emphasizing inflation may be seen as hawkish, while highlighting labor market weakness would be dovish. Historically, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s hawkish rhetoric has surprised markets, increasing the risk of a reversal in the dollar and equities if the tone deviates from expectations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 09, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource: [TalkMarkets - Currencies & Forex](https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fomc-preview-hawkish-cut?post=543544)\n\n**Growing Dissent at the Fed: Could Monetary Policy Become Politically Driven?**\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has transformed from a lender of last resort into the sole provider of liquidity in financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy, particularly through tools like quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), has become a central driver of market liquidity and asset pricing. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets every six weeks, typically reaches consensus on policy changes\u2014such as adjustments to the federal funds rate\u2014but dissenting votes are not uncommon. Historical data shows that around 5% of FOMC members vote against decisions per meeting, with a maximum of three dissenters in a single session since 2000. The published meeting minutes reveal significant internal debate, despite the official image of unity. The article raises concerns that the Fed may be increasingly influenced by political dynamics, particularly given that presidential nominations shape the ideological makeup of the committee. For instance, Stephen Miran, a nominee of former President Trump, supports aggressive rate cuts, suggesting potential alignment with a pro-Trump economic agenda. Conversely, some members may oppose loosening not out of inflation concerns but as a political stance against the administration. The article warns that growing political polarization within the Fed could undermine the appearance of consensus, especially as recent polling shows volatility in expectations for rate cuts\u2014ranging from 25% to 85%\u2014driven by public statements from committee members. With some members undecided and potential for more than five dissenting votes in the next meeting, the Fed\u2019s ability to project unity may weaken. The author argues that such dissent is beneficial, as it reflects honest disagreement and better informs markets than a false image of unanimity, which has historically led to policy errors.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 06:27 AM\nSource: [Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/mehr-dissens-bei-der-fed-droht-ein-politisch-getriebenes-machtspiel-200504210)\n\n**Fed Regime Change: Groupthink May Be Ending**\nThe article discusses a potential shift in the Federal Reserve's decision-making culture, suggesting that the long-standing 'groupthink' regime\u2014where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) publicly presents a unified consensus despite internal disagreements\u2014may be ending. Historically, dissenting votes have been rare, averaging 5% per meeting since 1936, with only three dissenters in a single meeting being the peak. However, recent FOMC meetings show increasing divergence, with multiple members openly opposing policy actions. For example, at the October 29, 2025, meeting, two members dissented: Stephen I. Miran, who favored a 0.5 percentage point rate cut, and Jeffrey R. Schmid, who supported no change. The article argues that political influence, particularly from presidential appointments, may be deepening ideological divides\u2014dovish members may be aligning with political goals, while hawkish members may oppose policies based on ideology rather than economic data. With rate cut probabilities fluctuating between 25% and 85%, and multiple members undecided or split, the possibility of four to six dissenters at the next meeting is rising. The author welcomes this shift, advocating for a new Fed regime where 12 independent members vote based on their own views rather than conforming to the Chair\u2019s leadership. This change, though potentially increasing short-term market volatility, would improve transparency and reduce the risk of policy errors driven by centralized groupthink. The author concludes that a transparent, pluralistic FOMC would better serve investors, businesses, and consumers by reflecting genuine policy debate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource: [TalkMarkets](https://talkmarkets.com/content/fed-regime-change-groupthink-may-be-ending?post=542338)\n\n**Fed Regime-Change: Groupthink May Be Ending**\nThe article argues that the Federal Reserve may be moving away from a long-standing 'groupthink' regime, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consistently presents a unified policy stance despite internal disagreements. Since 1936, FOMC minutes have revealed diverse economic views among members, but public statements have historically shown strong consensus. However, recent dissenting votes\u2014such as two members opposing policy actions at the October 29, 2025, meeting\u2014signal growing divergence. The article suggests that political influence may now be shaping Fed decisions, with appointees like Stephen Miran, a Trump nominee, advocating for aggressive rate cuts, while others may hold hawkish views for political reasons rather than economic fundamentals. The odds of a rate cut at the next meeting have fluctuated between 25% and 85%, reflecting uncertainty. The author contends that the Fed Chair\u2019s role in steering consensus may be weakening, potentially leading to more dissenting votes. The author welcomes this shift, advocating for a new regime where all 12 FOMC members independently voice and vote on policies, even if it introduces short-term market volatility. This change would enhance transparency and reduce the risk of policy errors driven by centralized, unchallenged authority.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 05:45 PM\nSource: [Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-regime-change-groupthink-may-be-ending)\n\n**Federal Reserve shows unexpected unity, independence as it weathers Trump's attacks**\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on Wednesday and, contrary to expectations of a split vote, adopted a nearly unanimous decision to cut the federal funds rate by a quarter\u2011point. The 12\u2011member committee had been anticipated to see up to three dissenting votes \u2013 the most in five years \u2013 but only one member, Trump\u2011appointed Stephen Miran, opposed the cut. All other members, including former Trump appointees Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted with the majority. Brian Bethune, a Boston College economist, praised the unity, saying \u2018They all came together to support what seems to be a very balanced decision.\u2019  Jason\u202fFurman, a former Obama adviser, noted the outcome as a sign of Fed independence.  Trump had tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook; a court allowed her to remain on the board while her lawsuit proceeds.  Chair Jerome\u202fPowell emphasized the Fed\u2019s commitment to independence and warned that \u2018There are no risk\u2011free paths now.\u2019  Former Fed economist Claudia\u202fSahm added that \u2018The institution is under attack,\u2019 underscoring the significance of the committee\u2019s cohesion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource: [AP](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-trump-dbd197ba501ac0b6ab0b47e079eedddb)\n\n**Union President Calls US Tariffs Still Significant, Urges Government to Continue Discussion**\nOn September 17, the newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Steven M. cast a dissenting vote at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and presented a policy\u2011rate outlook that fell well below the Fed\u2019s consensus. The move, which could be seen as a response to President Trump\u2019s desire to send a close aide to the Fed for media attention, highlights the Fed\u2019s internal disagreement on monetary policy.

Of the 12 members who cast votes, 11\u2014including Chair Jerome\u202fPowell\u2014supported the cut, while the sole dissenting vote came from newly\u2011appointed Governor Steven\u202fMeyer, a Trump loyalist, who voted for a larger 0.5\u202fp cut. Bloomberg noted that the single opposition vote was the most surprising element of the meeting, describing it as a \"rebellion vote\". Powell, after the decision, explained that the FOMC\u2019s structure\u201419 participants with 12 rotating voters\u2014makes it difficult for any single member to wield excessive influence, adding that \"the only way a voter could truly change the outcome is by having an incredibly persuasive argument\" and that there was \"no widespread support for the 0.5\u202fp cut.\" The article also references that in July the FOMC had seen a shift when Christopher\u202fWaller and Michelle\u202fBowman, both appointed during Trump\u2019s first term, moved from opposing the cut to joining the majority.
