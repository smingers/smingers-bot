## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on current expectations and analyst predictions, it appears there will be **one dissenting vote** at the January 28, 2026 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 

The dissenting member is expected to be **Governor Michelle Bowman**, who has publicly advocated for a significant rate cut [10]. Most other FOMC members, including Governor Christopher Waller, are projected to support maintaining current interest rates [1][2][6][8][9]. 

Key context:
- There are 12 voting FOMC members at this meeting [10]
- Analysts predict a 9-3 vote pattern like the December meeting won't repeat [11]
- The dissent centers on political pressure from President Trump for rate cuts versus the Fed's data-driven approach [10][11]
- Bowman has been the sole member publicly aligned with Trump's demand for aggressive cuts [10]

Limitations:  
While multiple sources agree on this expectation [1][2][6][8][9][10], these are projections. The actual vote count may change based on last-minute deliberations. We'll need to verify this after the meeting concludes on January 28.

**Fed to Hold Rates Steady Amid Political Pressure, With Global Central Banks Following Suit**
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to maintain interest rates unchanged during its two-day meeting on Wednesday, amid mounting political pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs. Three central banks—Brazil, Canada, and Sweden—that have publicly expressed 'full solidarity' with Fed Chair Jerome Powell are also likely to keep monetary conditions unchanged. This alignment follows statements from over a dozen central bank leaders, including those from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, who have defended the independence of monetary authorities during a period of heightened political scrutiny. The Fed faces additional challenges, including a grand jury subpoena threatening criminal charges and a Supreme Court case assessing whether the president can remove Fed Director Lisa Cook. Globally, central banks operate in a tense environment marked by Japan's recent market collapse, concerns over Trump's plans for Greenland, and ongoing threats of trade disruptions. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos that 'we are no longer in Kansas,' highlighting increased global volatility. Economists Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Chris G. Collins, Alex Tanzi, and Troy Durie note that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members are likely to justify maintaining rates based on data, with a consensus seen as a show of support for Powell. They anticipate that directors Christopher Waller will vote with the majority to uphold rates, signaling alignment with Powell and the Fed's independence, while Michelle Bowman may dissent. Meanwhile, central banks remain vigilant about inflationary pressures amid risks to growth from tariffs. Next week, 18 central banks worldwide will make decisions, with African central banks potentially pursuing monetary easing due to differing economic cycles.

**FOMC Meeting Ahead: Fed Expected to Hold Rates Steady as Next Chair Contenders' Votes Draw Attention**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to hold its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 27–28, 2026, and maintain interest rates within the 3.5–3.75% range, despite pressure from U.S. President Trump to lower borrowing costs. This decision is seen as a demonstration of the Fed's monetary policy independence. Other central banks, including those of Canada, Brazil, and Sweden, are also expected to keep rates unchanged. Recent U.S. data show a declining unemployment rate in December, but inflation remains above the Fed's target, supporting the case for maintaining current rates. Economists anticipate that most FOMC members will vote to hold rates steady, signaling confidence in Chair Jerome Powell. Key attention will focus on the votes of Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, both considered top contenders for the next Fed chair. Waller is expected to support the majority, while Bowman may dissent. Powell's post-me

## Your Task

Starting from the base distribution above, adjust based on current evidence. Show your full reasoning.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence provided is relatively recent, with the most relevant information being from January 2026, just a few days before the FOMC meeting. The sources appear to be credible, including reputable news outlets and economic analysts. There is no clear evidence of significant bias in the reporting.

The information on the expected dissenting vote by Governor Bowman seems to be widely reported, suggesting it is not yet priced into the base distribution.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Multiple sources agree that there will be one dissenting vote at the January 2026 FOMC meeting, with Governor Bowman expected to be the dissenter. This strongly favors the "1" option.
- [Evidence 2]: The sources indicate that most other FOMC members, including Governor Waller, are expected to support maintaining current interest rates. This strongly disfavors the "2" and "3+" options.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The sources note that the actual vote count may change based on last-minute deliberations, introducing some uncertainty. This moderately disfavors the "1" option.

**WEAK Evidence**
- None identified.

### Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: Strong evidence that there will be at least one dissenting vote
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 5%

**1:**
- Evidence favoring: Strong evidence that there will be one dissenting vote, with Bowman expected to be the dissenter
- Evidence against: Moderate evidence that the actual vote count may change
- Net adjustment: Increase by 10%

**2:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: Strong evidence that most FOMC members are expected to support maintaining current rates
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 5%

**3+:**
- Evidence favoring: None
- Evidence against: Strong evidence that most FOMC members are expected to support maintaining current rates
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 5%

### Step 4: Integration

After all adjustments:
- 0: 65.0%
- 1: 30.0%
- 2: 3.0%
- 3+: 2.0%

The probabilities now sum to 100%, and the relative ordering makes sense based on the evidence.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The probability for the "0" option is relatively high at 65%, but this seems justified given the strong evidence against any dissenting votes beyond one.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustments from the base distribution are not overly large, and the final distribution still has a similar shape to the original.

3. **Update magnitude:** The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest updates.

4. **Sum check:** The probabilities sum to exactly 100%.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the current evidence on the expected dissenting votes at the January 28, 2026 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The strong consensus across multiple credible sources that there will be one dissenting vote, with Governor Bowman expected to be the dissenter, leads me to increase the probability of the "1" option significantly.

At the same time, the moderate uncertainty around the actual vote count, as well as the strong evidence that most other FOMC members are expected to support maintaining current interest rates, justifies decreasing the probabilities for the "0", "2", and "3+" options.

Overall, the evidence points to a highly likely scenario of a 9-3 vote, with Bowman dissenting while the rest of the committee, including Waller, supports the Fed's data-driven approach over political pressure for rate cuts. This aligns with the Fed's demonstrated commitment to monetary policy independence, even in the face of external pressure.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 1
- Strong evidence against: 2, 3+
- Net direction: 1 gained probability

**Distribution:**
- 0: 65.0%
- 1: 30.0%
- 2: 3.0%
- 3+: 2.0%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (30.0%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8
