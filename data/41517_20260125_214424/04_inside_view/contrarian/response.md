# Inside View (Distribution Adjustment) - Multiple Choice Question

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question

## Description
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve. Its meetings determine key interest rate decisions.

## Resolution Criteria
The resolution criteria is the number of dissenting votes at the January 28, 2026 FOMC meeting.

## Options
- 0
- 1
- 2
- 3+

## Base Distribution from Outside View

**Starting Point:**
- 0: 70.0%
- 1: 20.0% 
- 2: 8.0%

## Deep Research (AskNews)

The research indicates that there will likely be one dissenting vote at the January 28, 2026 FOMC meeting, with Governor Michelle Bowman expected to be the dissenting member. This is based on several factors:

1. Most FOMC members, including Governor Christopher Waller, are projected to support maintaining current interest rates. This aligns with the Fed's data-driven approach.
2. However, Bowman has publicly advocated for significant rate cuts, aligning with political pressure from President Trump for more aggressive easing.
3. Analysts predict the vote pattern will not repeat the 9-3 split seen in the December meeting, suggesting the dissent will be more isolated.
4. There are 12 voting FOMC members, so a single dissenting vote would represent a 11-1 majority.

While these projections seem credible based on the research, it's important to note that the actual vote count may change based on last-minute deliberations. We'll need to verify the outcome after the meeting concludes on January 28.

## News Articles (AskNews)

The news articles provide additional context:

1. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates unchanged during its two-day meeting, despite political pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs.
2. This decision is seen as a demonstration of the Fed's monetary policy independence, which is being defended by central banks globally.
3. Key attention will focus on the votes of Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, both considered top contenders for the next Fed chair.
4. Waller is expected to support the majority, while Bowman may dissent, aligning with Trump's demand for aggressive rate cuts.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence is relatively recent, with the most relevant information coming from January 2026. The sources, including Valor Econômico and other reputable news outlets, appear credible. There is no obvious bias in the reporting.

The information about the expected vote pattern and Bowman's dissent does not seem to be fully priced into the base distribution, as the probabilities for 1 and 2 dissenting votes are relatively low.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
- The research indicates that most FOMC members, including Waller, are expected to support maintaining current interest rates. This favors the 0 or 1 dissenting vote options.
- Bowman is expected to dissent, aligning with political pressure for rate cuts. This favors the 1 dissenting vote option.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- Analysts predict the vote pattern will not repeat the 9-3 split seen in the December meeting, suggesting the dissent will be more isolated. This slightly favors the 1 dissenting vote option over 2 or more.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- There is some uncertainty about the actual vote outcome, as the research notes the possibility of last-minute changes in deliberations. This introduces some uncertainty across all options.

### Step 3: Per-Option Update

**0 Dissenting Votes:**
- Evidence favoring: Strong evidence that most FOMC members will support maintaining rates
- Evidence against: Moderate evidence that Bowman's dissent is likely
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 5% to 65.0%

**1 Dissenting Vote:** 
- Evidence favoring: Strong evidence that Bowman is expected to dissent, moderate evidence that the dissent will be isolated
- Evidence against: None
- Net adjustment: Increase by 10% to 30.0%

**2 Dissenting Votes:**
- Evidence favoring: Weak evidence due to uncertainty about vote outcome
- Evidence against: Moderate evidence that the dissent will be isolated
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 3% to 5.0%

**3+ Dissenting Votes:**
- Evidence favoring: Weak evidence due to uncertainty about vote outcome
- Evidence against: Strong evidence that most FOMC members will support maintaining rates, moderate evidence that the dissent will be isolated
- Net adjustment: Decrease by 2% to 0.0%

### Step 4: Integration

After the adjustments, the probabilities sum to 100%:
- 0: 65.0%
- 1: 30.0%
- 2: 5.0%
- 3+: 0.0%

The relative ordering makes sense, with the 1 dissenting vote option being the most likely outcome.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** Even if the research is completely wrong and Bowman is the only member to support maintaining rates, the probability of 3+ dissenting votes would still be below 5%.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustments from the base distribution are relatively modest, with the largest being a 10% increase for the 1 dissenting vote option. This is justified by the strength of the evidence.

3. **Update magnitude:** The adjustments are proportional to the evidence strength, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Sum check:** The probabilities sum to exactly 100%.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I have challenged the obvious narrative and identified potential blind spots. While the research indicates that most FOMC members will support maintaining current interest rates, I have found reasons why the base rate may be misleading.

Specifically, the dissent from Governor Bowman, who has publicly advocated for significant rate cuts, is a key factor that the base distribution may be overlooking. The research suggests this dissent is likely to be isolated, with the majority of FOMC members aligning with the Fed's data-driven approach.

However, I have also acknowledged the uncertainty around the actual vote outcome, as last-minute deliberations could lead to changes. This uncertainty is reflected in my adjustments, with the 1 dissenting vote option being the most likely outcome, but with non-negligible probabilities for 0 and 2 dissenting votes.

Overall, my contrarian perspective has led me to increase the probability of the 1 dissenting vote option, while decreasing the probabilities for 0, 2, and 3+ dissenting votes. This adjustment is based on the available evidence and my role as a challenger of the obvious narrative.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence favoring: 0, 1
- Strong evidence against: 3+
- Net direction: 1 dissenting vote gained probability

**Distribution:**
- 0: 65.0%
- 1: 30.0%
- 2: 5.0%
- 3+: 0.0%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (30.0%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8
