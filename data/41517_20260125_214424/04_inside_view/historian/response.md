# Inside View (Distribution Adjustment) - Multiple Choice Question

## Your Role: historian

How many dissenting votes will there be at the January 28, 2026 Federal Open Market Committee meeting?

## Evidence Summary:

**Strong Evidence Favoring:**
- 1: The current research indicates that most FOMC members are expected to vote to maintain current interest rates, with one dissenting vote from Governor Michelle Bowman [1][2][6][8][9][10].

**Strong Evidence Against:**
- 0: The research suggests there is a high likelihood of at least one dissenting vote, contradicting the 70% probability in the base distribution [1][2][6][8][9][10].
- 3+: The research does not indicate there will be more than one dissenting vote, making 3+ an unlikely outcome [1][2][6][8][9][10].

**Net Direction:** The evidence points to a higher probability of 1 dissenting vote compared to the base distribution.

## Distribution:

- 0: 60%
- 1: 35% 
- 2: 5%
- 3+: 0%

**Most Likely Outcome:** 1 (35%)

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

## Reasoning

As a historian, I focused on analyzing the precedents and patterns from past FOMC meetings to inform my probability estimate. The current research indicates that it is quite common for there to be at least one dissenting vote, even when the majority of FOMC members agree on a course of action. This is often the case when there are political pressures or differing economic outlooks among the committee members.

In this specific case, the research suggests that Governor Michelle Bowman is likely to dissent from the majority view of maintaining current interest rates. Bowman has publicly advocated for more aggressive rate cuts, aligning with President Trump's demands, while the rest of the FOMC is expected to take a more data-driven approach. This dynamic of political pressure versus the Fed's independence is not uncommon and has played out in similar ways in the past.

Given this historical context, I believe the base distribution underestimates the probability of at least one dissenting vote. While 0 dissenting votes is still possible, the research points to a higher likelihood of 1 dissenting vote. I have therefore decreased the probability of 0 dissents and increased the probability of 1 dissent accordingly.

At the same time, I do not see strong evidence to suggest there will be more than one dissenting vote, as the research indicates the majority of FOMC members are aligned on maintaining current rates. Therefore, I have decreased the probability of 2 or more dissents compared to the base distribution.

Overall, my adjustments are based on the historical precedents and patterns observed in similar situations, which I believe provides a more accurate assessment of the likely outcome for this FOMC meeting.
