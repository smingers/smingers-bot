Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Sources are consistently high-quality, with multiple reputable international news outlets providing insights. Key sources include CNBC, The Diplomat, BBC, and CFR. All sources are from January 2026, providing current context.

Key Factual Observations:
1. Snap election called for February 8, 2026
2. Takaichi's personal approval ratings: 70-78%
3. LDP party support: Around 28-29%
4. First female Prime Minister of Japan
5. Recently took office in October 2025

(b) Evidence Weighing:
Strong Evidence:
- High personal approval ratings (multiple sources)
- First female Prime Minister (historical significance)
- Snap election strategy (precedent with Koizumi, Abe)

Moderate Evidence:
- Economic challenges (inflation, wage stagnation)
- Complex geopolitical environment
- Slim parliamentary majority

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative long-term political projections
- Individual expert opinions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Window: From 2026-01-26 to 2032-12-31
Total Possible Days: 2190 days

Sensitivity Analysis:
- If timeframe halved: More volatile, higher chance of shorter tenure
- If timeframe doubled: More opportunity for political stabilization

(d) Justification:
Reference Class: Japanese Prime Ministers since 1990
- Average tenure: ~2 years
- Significant variability in leadership duration

Factors Favoring Longer Tenure:
- High personal popularity
- Historic first female PM status
- Strong political brand associated with Abe's legacy

Factors Challenging Tenure:
- Economic uncertainties
- Potential election volatility
- Competitive political landscape

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex political dynamics and historical precedents, I'll construct a distribution that reflects both potential short-term disruption and possibility of sustained leadership.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: ~2 years (historical Japanese PM tenure)
3. Consistency Check: Implied median ≈ 540 days, mean ≈ 600 days ✓
4. Key Evidence:
   - High personal approval
   - Snap election strategy
   - First female PM
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis or economic collapse

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 0
Percentile 5: 30
Percentile 10: 90
Percentile 20: 180
Percentile 40: 450
Percentile 60: 720
Percentile 80: 1080
Percentile 90: 1440
Percentile 95: 1800
Percentile 99: 2160

Rationale for Distribution:
- Reflects historical PM tenure volatility
- Allows for potential breakthrough to longer leadership
- Captures both short-term and extended scenarios
- Weighted towards moderate tenure lengths
- Accounts for potential political and economic uncertainties

The distribution suggests a median expectation of around 540 days (1.5 years), with significant probability of both shorter and longer tenures, reflecting the dynamic nature of Japanese political leadership.
