I'll provide a comprehensive analysis for this forecasting challenge:

Analysis:
(a) Source Analysis:
1. CNBC (2026-01-12): High-quality financial source
   - Factual: Snap election planned, Takaichi's 75% approval
   - LDP/JIP control 230/465 Lower House seats
   - Weak economic indicators (contracting GDP, weak yen)

2. The Diplomat (2026-01-19): Respected geopolitical publication
   - Factual: First snap election in 25 years
   - LDP holds 191/465 seats
   - High youth support (90% for Takaichi)
   - Unusual election without Komeito coalition

3. Hungarian Conservative (2026-01-XX): Moderate international perspective
   - Factual: LDP only 28.5% party support
   - Takaichi's personal ratings 60-75%
   - Historical precedent of risky snap elections

(b) Evidence Weighing:
Strong Evidence:
- Takaichi's high personal approval (multiple sources)
- Strategic political positioning
- Historical precedent of similar political maneuvers

Moderate Evidence:
- Potential economic challenges
- Shifting coalition dynamics
- Mixed party vs. personal support

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative long-term leadership projections
- Uncertain international geopolitical factors

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: Until 2032 (6 years from 2026)
- Key Milestones:
  * February 8, 2026 election
  * Potential leadership contests in 2028, 2030
- If timeframe halved: More volatile, higher uncertainty
- If timeframe doubled: More potential for sustained leadership

(d) Justification:
- Japanese PM tenures historically short (1-2 years)
- Current high personal popularity
- Strategic political maneuvering
- Potential for external disruptions

Probability Calibration:
- Base Reference Class: Recent Japanese PM tenures
- Adjusting for current unique circumstances
- Considering high personal approval and strategic positioning

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as PM before 2032
2. Outside View Base Rate: ~730 days (typical PM tenure)
3. Consistency Check: Median ~900, Mean ~1000 - Reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - 75% personal approval
   - Snap election strategy
   - First female PM
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical/economic crisis

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 30
Percentile 5: 90
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 365
Percentile 40: 730
Percentile 60: 1095
Percentile 80: 1460
Percentile 90: 1825
Percentile 95: 2190
Percentile 99: 2555

Rationale for Distribution:
- Lower percentiles reflect potential early resignation
- Mid-range represents typical Japanese PM tenure
- Higher percentiles account for potential sustained leadership
- 90th percentile (1825 days ≈ 5 years) represents an optimistic scenario

The distribution reflects the significant uncertainty in Japanese political leadership while accounting for Takaichi's current strong political position.
