Probability Calibration:
Considering historical Japanese PM tenures and current political dynamics, I'll adjust the previous outside view prediction to reflect the unique circumstances.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: 1-2 years typical PM tenure
3. Consistency Check: Median ~540 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - 75% personal approval
   - Snap election strategy
   - First female PM
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected economic or geopolitical crisis

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 30
Percentile 5: 90
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 365
Percentile 40: 540
Percentile 60: 730
Percentile 80: 1095
Percentile 90: 1460
Percentile 95: 1825
Percentile 99: 2190

Rationale: The distribution reflects the potential for a more extended tenure compared to recent Japanese PMs, accounting for her high approval, unique political position, and potential to break historical patterns. The wide range acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in political forecasting, with a median expectation of around 540 days but significant potential for both shorter and longer terms.
