- Strong nationalist credentials
- Political experience since 1993

Potential Tenure Limitations:
- Slim parliamentary majority
- Potential geopolitical tensions
- Economic challenges
- Competitive internal LDP dynamics

Outside View Calibration:
- Consider historical PM tenure patterns
- Account for potential political volatility
- Factor in personal and party approval ratings
- Assess geopolitical and economic stability risks

Calibration Considerations:
- High variability in Japanese political landscape
- Personal popularity doesn't guarantee sustained leadership
- External shocks could dramatically alter trajectory

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 300
Percentile 20: 500
Percentile 40: 800
Percentile 60: 1200
Percentile 80: 1600
Percentile 90: 2000

Rationale: The prediction reflects a moderate expectation of tenure based on recent Japanese political patterns, accounting for Takaichi's unique position and potential challenges. The wide range acknowledges significant uncertainty in Japanese political dynamics.

The prediction suggests she could serve between 10 months (300 days) to approximately 5.5 years (2000 days), with the most likely scenario around 2-3 years (800-1200 days).
