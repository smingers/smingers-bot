Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Sources range from high-quality international news outlets (CNBC, The Diplomat, BBC) to specialized geopolitical analysis platforms. Key considerations:

1. Reliability Ranking:
- CNBC: High (business-focused, data-driven)
- The Diplomat: High (geopolitical specialization)
- BBC: High (international news reputation)
- Hungarian Conservative: Moderate
- CFR: High (think tank credibility)

2. Factual Consensus:
- Takaichi is Japan's first female Prime Minister
- Currently has 70-78% approval ratings
- Called snap election for February 8, 2026
- Recently took office in October 2025
- Lost traditional coalition with Komeito Party

3. Expert Opinion Consistency:
- Multiple sources describe election as high-risk political strategy
- Comparisons to previous transformative leaders like Koizumi and Abe
- Recognition of potential political volatility

(b) Evidence Analysis:

Strong Evidence:
- High personal approval ratings (multiple sources)
- First female Prime Minister with unique political positioning
- Snap election strategy with historical precedent

Moderate Evidence:
- Recent coalition restructuring
- Economic challenges (inflation, demographic shifts)
- Geopolitical tensions in Asia-Pacific region

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative long-term leadership predictions
- Polling data with potential short-term bias

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Period: Jan 2026 to Dec 2031 (approximately 6 years)

Key Timeframe Considerations:
- February 2026 election is critical inflection point
- Potential leadership challenges around:
  * September 2028 LDP leadership contest
  * October 2028 mandatory Lower House poll
  * October 2030 potential re-election period

Sensitivity Analysis:
- If timeframe halved (3 years): Lower probability of sustained leadership
- If timeframe doubled (12 years): Requires extraordinary political stability

(d) Justification:
Compelling Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Unprecedented female leadership
2. Strong personal approval ratings
3. Strategic political positioning
4. Nationalist sentiment support
5. Potential economic policy innovations

Probability Calibration:
Considering historical Japanese Prime Minister tenures (average 1-2 years) and Takaichi's unique positioning, we'll construct a distribution that reflects both volatility and potential stability.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Prime Minister before 2032
2. Base Rate: 365-730 days (typical Japanese PM tenure)
3. Consistency Check: Median around 730 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - High approval ratings
   - Snap election strategy
   - First female PM
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis or economic collapse

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 30
Percentile 5: 90
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 365
Percentile 40: 730
Percentile 60: 1095
Percentile 80: 1460
Percentile 90: 1825
Percentile 95: 2190
Percentile 99: 2555

The distribution reflects a wide range of potential tenures, acknowledging both the potential for short-term volatility and the possibility of sustained leadership. The median (around 1095 days or 3 years) represents a balanced assessment of Takaichi's political prospects, considering her current strengths and the inherent challenges in Japanese political leadership.
