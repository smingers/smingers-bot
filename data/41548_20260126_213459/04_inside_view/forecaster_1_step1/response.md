(b) Reference Class Analysis:

Most Suitable Reference Class: Japanese Prime Minister Tenure Length
- Average tenure: ~2 years
- High variability due to political instability
- Recent PMs (Suga, Kishida) served shorter terms

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

- Historical Pattern: Prime Ministers typically serve 1-3 years
- Takaichi's unique position as first female PM adds uncertainty

(d) Justification:
- Political Challenges: Minority government, dissolved coalition
- Personal Factors: Strong initial popularity, conservative base support
- Structural Constraints: LDP internal dynamics, economic performance

Outside view calibration:
- Considering high political volatility in Japan
- Accounting for potential unexpected events
- Recognizing Takaichi's unique political positioning

Factors increasing likelihood of shorter tenure:
- Minority government
- Economic challenges
- Potential internal LDP challenges

Factors potentially extending tenure:
- Strong initial popularity
- Strategic political maneuvering
- Lack of clear alternative leadership

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 300
Percentile 20: 450
Percentile 40: 600
Percentile 60: 800
Percentile 80: 1,100
Percentile 90: 1,400

Rationale: The prediction reflects the typical Japanese PM tenure pattern while accounting for Takaichi's unique political circumstances. The wide range acknowledges significant uncertainty about her potential longevity, with a median expectation around 600-800 days. The upper percentiles allow for potential stability or unexpected political developments.

The prediction suggests she's likely to serve between 1-2 years, consistent with recent Japanese political trends, but with significant variability due to her groundbreaking position as Japan's first female PM.
