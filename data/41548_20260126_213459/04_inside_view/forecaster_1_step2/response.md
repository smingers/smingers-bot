2. Economic Challenges: Rising living costs, weak yen

- Accounting for structural political challenges
- Recognizing Takaichi's unique political positioning

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: Typical 1-2 year tenure
3. Consistency Check: Median ~600 days aligns with historical patterns
4. Key Evidence:
