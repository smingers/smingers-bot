(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Fragile political coalition
- Minority government status
- Declining LDP party membership
- Complex economic and geopolitical challenges

Moderate Evidence:
- Current 60-70% cabinet approval rating
- Successful budget negotiations
- Personal political determination

Weak Evidence:
- Individual leadership style
- Potential health concerns

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: Until 2032 (approximately 2160 days from now)
- If timeframe halved: Likely shorter tenure due to intensified political pressures
- If timeframe doubled: Increased potential for stabilization and longer-term governance

(d) Justification:
- Historical LDP leadership tenures typically short (12-18 months)
- Current political landscape more volatile than previous periods
- Multiple external challenges (economic, geopolitical) increase uncertainty

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex political environment, I'll adjust the outside view prediction to reflect higher uncertainty and potential for shorter tenure.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi Sanae serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: Typical LDP PM tenure of 12-18 months (360-540 days)
3. Consistency Check: Median around 450 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Minority government status
   - Fragile political coalition
   - Economic challenges
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis potentially extending/shortening tenure
