(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:

- Declining LDP membership (from 5.4m to 900,000)
- Potential health concerns due to micromanagement style

Moderate Evidence:
- First female prime minister breaking traditional political barriers
- High initial cabinet approval rating (60-70%)
- Economic challenges (weak yen, rising living costs)

Weak Evidence:
- Personal political ambitions
- Individual leadership characteristics

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 2026-01-26 to 2032-01-01
- Total Potential Days: 2191 days

Sensitivity Analysis:
- Half timeframe (1095 days): Likely shorter tenure
- Double timeframe (4382 days): Extremely unlikely to maintain continuous leadership

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Political Instability: LDP's declining membership
2. Coalition Fragility: Loss of Komeito support
3. Economic Challenges: Weak economic environment
4. Leadership Style: Micromanagement risks

Probability Calibration:
Considering historical Japanese prime ministerial tenures and current political landscape, the prediction will reflect high uncertainty and potential for early resignation.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi Sanae serves as Japan's Prime Minister before 2032
2. Base Rate: Historically short Japanese PM tenures
3. Consistency Check: Implied median around 400-500 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Fragile political coalition
   - LDP membership decline
   - Economic challenges
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical event causing early resignation

Percentile 40: 380
Percentile 60: 540
Percentile 80: 720
Percentile 90: 900
Percentile 95: 1080

Rationale: The distribution reflects high uncertainty, potential for early resignation, but also allows for possible extended tenure under stable conditions. The peak around 400-600 days represents the most likely scenario based on recent Japanese political patterns.
