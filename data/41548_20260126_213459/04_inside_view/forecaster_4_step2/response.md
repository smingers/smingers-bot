Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. Nippon.com Article:
- Quality: High (Japanese news source)
- Factual Information: 
  * Fiscal budget details
  * Current political standing
  * Challenges facing Takaichi's administration
- Expert Opinions: Balanced reporting on political challenges

2. Edelman Global Advisory Article:
- Quality: Moderate (consulting firm insight)
- Factual Information:
  * Takaichi became PM on October 21, 2025
  * Broke 26-year LDP-Komeito coalition
- Expert Insights: Highlights political realignment

3. East Asia Forum Article:
- Quality: High (academic source)
- Factual Information:
  * LDP membership decline
  * Opposition majority in lower house
- Expert Opinion: Suggests Takaichi might accelerate LDP's decline

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Fragile political coalition (LDP lost Komeito support)
- Minority government position
- Complex economic challenges

Moderate Evidence:
- Current 60-70% cabinet approval rating
- Successful budget negotiations
- Reputation as a problem solver

Weak Evidence:
- Personal leadership style
- Potential health concerns

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Period: Until 2032 (approximately 6 years from now)
- Current Date: 2026-01-26

If timeframe halved (3 years):
- Likelihood of shorter tenure increases
- Probability of early resignation or challenge rises

If timeframe doubled (12 years):
- Less predictable long-term political landscape
- Increased chance of multiple leadership changes

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Unprecedented political coalition breakdown
2. Economic pressures (weak yen, living costs)
3. Geopolitical tensions with China
4. LDP's declining membership and influence

Probability Calibration:
- Historical LDP PM tenures: 1-2 years
- Current challenges suggest potential for shorter tenure
- But strong initial approval ratings provide some stability

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: 1-2 years typical LDP leadership
3. Consistency Check: Median around 500-700 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Broken LDP-Komeito coalition
   - Minority government
   - Economic challenges
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis could dramatically extend/shorten tenure

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 85
Percentile 5: 120
Percentile 10: 200
Percentile 20: 350
Percentile 40: 500
Percentile 60: 700
Percentile 80: 900
Percentile 90: 1100
Percentile 95: 1300
Percentile 99: 1600

Rationale: The distribution reflects typical LDP leadership tenures with additional uncertainty due to unique political circumstances, providing a wide range of potential outcomes while respecting the specified lower bound of 85 days.
