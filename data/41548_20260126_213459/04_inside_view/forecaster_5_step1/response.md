(b) Reference Class Analysis:

- Limited global comparisons
- Less direct applicability

3. LDP Leadership Transitions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-01-26

- Approximately 6 years remaining
- Historical pattern: Rapid PM turnover (average ~1.5 years per PM)

(d) Justification:
- Takaichi represents a breakthrough as first female PM
- Political landscape highly volatile
- LDP experiencing significant internal challenges
- Minority government status increases uncertainty
- Personal popularity doesn't guarantee sustained political survival

Outside View Calibration:
- Considerations:
  1. High political volatility
  2. Minority government challenges
  3. Historical PM turnover rates
  4. Potential unexpected geopolitical events

- Distribution characteristics:
  - Wide confidence intervals
  - Higher probability of shorter tenure
  - Account for potential unexpected resignations/challenges

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 150
Percentile 20: 250
Percentile 40: 400
Percentile 60: 600
Percentile 80: 800
Percentile 90: 1000

Rationale:
- Base prediction centers around historical PM tenure (400-600 days)
- Wide intervals account for potential political instability
- Upper percentiles allow for potential longer tenure if she successfully navigates challenges
- Lower percentiles reflect potential early resignation scenarios

The prediction suggests a 90% likelihood she serves between 150-1000 days as Prime Minister before 2032, with the most likely range being 400-600 days.
