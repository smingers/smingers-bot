(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential reference classes:
1. Japanese Prime Ministers since 1990
2. LDP leaders with minority government
3. First-time female leaders in parliamentary systems

Most suitable reference class: Japanese Prime Ministers since 1990
- Average tenure: Approximately 1-2 years
- High turnover rate
- Dependent on coalition dynamics and public support

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-01-26
- Prediction period: Until 2032
- Remaining time: Approximately 6 years

Historical Pattern:
- Average LDP Prime Minister tenure: 1-2 years
- Minority government situations typically less stable
- Snap elections can dramatically alter political landscape

(d) Justification:
Key factors influencing prediction:
- Minority government status
- Upcoming snap election
- Low public support (44-69% disapproval)
- Fragile coalition with Japan Innovation Party
- High political volatility in recent Japanese politics

Outside View Calibration:
Considerations:
- High uncertainty due to minority government
- Potential for unexpected political shifts
- Historical precedent of short Prime Ministerial tenures
- Snap election as potential inflection point

Adjustment factors:
- Increased volatility: +20% uncertainty
- Minority government risk: Higher probability of shorter tenure
- Personal political skill: Moderate resilience factor

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 200
Percentile 20: 300
Percentile 40: 450
Percentile 60: 600
Percentile 80: 800
Percentile 90: 1000

Rationale: The prediction reflects the high uncertainty of Takaichi's tenure, accounting for potential early removal, successful navigation of snap election, and possible political survival mechanisms. The wide range acknowledges multiple potential political scenarios while respecting the specified constraints (>85, <1825 days).

The median prediction (around 450-600 days) suggests a likely scenario of partial political survival, consistent with recent Japanese Prime Ministerial trends, while the wider intervals allow for unexpected political developments.
