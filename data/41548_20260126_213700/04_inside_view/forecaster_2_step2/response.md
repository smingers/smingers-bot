Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. The Diplomat (2026-01-26): High-quality source. Key factual points:
- Takaichi called a snap election for February 8
- Currently leads a slim majority government (191/465 seats)
- Enjoys high public approval (over 70% in polls)
Potential bias: Seems to provide balanced political analysis

2. PBS (historical context): Credible source. Key factual points:
- Takaichi is 64 years old
- Formed coalition with Osaka-based Ishin no Kai
- Planned defense budget increase to 2% of GDP by 2027
Expert opinion: Observers expect short government duration

3. Time Magazine (2025-10-04): Reputable source. Key factual points:
- Elected LDP leader on October 4, 2025
- Won 185/341 votes in leadership run-off
- First potential female Prime Minister of Japan
Expert perspective suggests symbolic but potentially limited political impact

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Minority government status
- Upcoming snap election
- Historical volatility of Japanese prime ministerial tenures

Moderate Evidence:
- High initial public approval
- Personal political positioning
- Coalition dynamics with Japan Innovation Party

Weak Evidence:
- Individual expert opinions
- Speculative political predictions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction Period: 2026-01-26 to 2032-01-01 (approximately 6 years)
- If timeframe halved: Likely more concentrated around near-term political volatility
- If timeframe doubled: More opportunity for political stabilization

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Minority government inherent instability
2. Upcoming snap election as potential inflection point
3. Complex coalition maintenance challenges
4. Historical precedent of short Prime Ministerial tenures

Probability Calibration:
Considering the volatile Japanese political landscape and Takaichi's precarious political position, I'll construct a probability distribution that reflects significant uncertainty while respecting the 85-1825 day constraint.

The distribution will emphasize:
- Higher probability of shorter tenure (200-600 days)
- Decreasing probability of extended tenure
- Low but non-zero probability of full term completion

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Japan's Prime Minister before 2032
2. Outside View Base Rate: 1-2 years typical LDP tenure
3. Consistency Check: Median ~450 days aligns with historical patterns
4. Key Evidence:
- Minority government
- Snap election dynamics
- Historical PM tenure volatility
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical event dramatically altering political landscape (could push tenure up or down)

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 90
Percentile 5: 120
Percentile 10: 200
Percentile 20: 300
Percentile 40: 450
Percentile 60: 600
Percentile 80: 800
Percentile 90: 1000
Percentile 95: 1200
Percentile 99: 1500

The distribution reflects:
- Minimum constraint of 85 days
- Most likely scenario of 450-600 days
- Possibility of extended tenure up to ~1500 days
- Acknowledgment of significant political uncertainty in Japanese context
