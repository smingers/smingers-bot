Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 270
Percentile 40: 420
Percentile 60: 620
Percentile 80: 850
Percentile 90: 1100

Rationale for Distribution:
- Lower percentiles reflect potential early termination
- Higher percentiles account for potential stability
- Wide range reflects political uncertainty
- Centered around historical average of ~2 years
- Allows for potential longer tenure like Abe's

The prediction suggests a likely tenure between 6 months to 3 years, with potential extensions based on political maneuvering and election outcomes.
