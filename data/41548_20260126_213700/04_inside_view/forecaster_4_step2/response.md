Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex political landscape and historical Japanese PM tenures, I'm adjusting the outside view prediction to reflect higher uncertainty and potential shorter tenure.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi Sanae serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: ~500-600 days (historical average)
3. Consistency Check: Median ~550, Mean ~600 - aligned with justification
4. Key Evidence:
   - Snap election strategy
   - Minority government
   - High personal approval
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis potentially extending/shortening tenure

Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 270
Percentile 40: 450
Percentile 60: 620
