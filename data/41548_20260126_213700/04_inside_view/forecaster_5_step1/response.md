(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-01-26
- Prediction period: Until 2032
- Remaining time: Approximately 6 years
- Recent PM tenures suggest average ~1-2 years
- Upcoming snap election is a critical inflection point

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Influencing Tenure:
1. Minority government status
2. Upcoming snap election
3. Complex coalition dynamics
4. Low initial public support (44% have little expectation)
5. Political funding scandals
6. Diplomatic tensions with China

Outside View Calibration:
- Consider high variability due to political uncertainty
- Snap election could dramatically alter tenure
- Historical precedent of short PM tenures in Japan
- Need to account for potential unexpected events

Considerations for Distribution:
- Higher probability of shorter tenure (1-2 years)
- Lower probability of extremely long tenure
- Account for potential political upheavals
- Include wide confidence intervals

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 365
Percentile 40: 540
Percentile 60: 720
Percentile 80: 1095
Percentile 90: 1460

Rationale: The prediction reflects the uncertain political landscape, potential for early removal, but also possibility of surviving multiple years. The wide range accounts for unexpected political developments, coalition shifts, and election outcomes.

The 50th percentile (around 540 days or ~1.5 years) aligns with recent Japanese PM tenure patterns while providing flexibility for both shorter and longer potential terms.
