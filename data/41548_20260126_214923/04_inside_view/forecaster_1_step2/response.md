(c) Timeframe Analysis:

- If timeframe doubled: Increased likelihood of sustained leadership

(d) Justification:
Key Factors:
- Political Instability: High (LDP coalition challenges)
- Personal Leadership: Moderate-Strong
- Economic Context: Challenging (inflation, global tensions)

Probability Calibration:
Considering historical Japanese PM tenures and current political landscape, a wide distribution is warranted to capture potential scenarios.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Japanese PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: Historical average 600-900 days
3. Consistency: Median around 720 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Snap election indicates political confidence
   - 70% approval rating
   - Minority government status
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis could dramatically shorten tenure

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 85
Percentile 5: 120
Percentile 10: 210
Percentile 20: 360
Percentile 40: 540
Percentile 60: 780
Percentile 80: 1020
Percentile 90: 1380
Percentile 95: 1620
Percentile 99: 1825

Rationale: The distribution reflects potential volatility, with a central tendency around typical Japanese PM tenures, but allowing for both shorter and longer scenarios based on current political dynamics.
