- Suitable for baseline estimation

2. Female Political Leaders in Conservative Parties
- Limited global sample
- Less directly applicable

3. LDP Leadership Transitions
- Most relevant reference class
- Consistent pattern of short-term leadership

Selected Reference Class: LDP Leadership Transitions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Question covers period until 2032
- Current date: 2026-01-26
- Potential tenure: Approximately 6 years remaining
- Historical LDP leadership patterns suggest 2-3 year average tenure
- Takaichi's current position: Minority government, potential instability

(d) Justification:
- High political volatility
- Minority government challenges
- Economic uncertainties
- Geopolitical tensions
- Personal leadership risks

Outside view calibration:
- Historical LDP leadership suggests high variability
- Consider potential disruption scenarios
- Account for economic and geopolitical black swan events
- Recognize potential for unexpected leadership changes

Accounting for variability and historical patterns, a wide confidence interval is appropriate.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 180
Percentile 20: 270
Percentile 40: 420
Percentile 60: 600
Percentile 80: 840
Percentile 90: 1020

Rationale: 
- Base estimate around 420 days (approximately 1.15 years)
- Wide interval reflects political uncertainty
- Considers potential early resignation or unexpected events
- Aligns with historical LDP leadership transition patterns
- Accounts for minority government instability
- Reflects potential economic or geopolitical disruptions

The prediction suggests a moderate likelihood of serving around 1-1.5 years, with significant potential for shorter or longer tenures depending on political developments.
