(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential Reference Classes:

- Average tenure: 2-3 years
- High variability
- Most suitable reference class

2. Female Political Leaders' Tenure
- Limited global data
- Less applicable due to unique Japanese political context

3. Conservative Party Leaders in Parliamentary Systems
- Moderate applicability
- Provides some comparative insights

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: 5-6 years (until 2032)
- Historical Pattern: 
  * Post-2006 LDP leaders averaged 2-3 years
  * Abe's extended tenure (2012-2020) is an outlier
  * Minority governments typically have shorter tenures

(d) Justification Factors:
- Political Volatility: High (frequent leadership changes)
- Economic Challenges: Significant (inflation, aging population)
- Geopolitical Tensions: Increasing (China-Taiwan-US dynamics)
- Personal Leadership Factors: Mixed (strong initial support, potential fragility)

Outside View Calibration:
- Considering historical LDP leadership patterns
- Accounting for minority government instability
- Factoring potential external shock scenarios
- Recognizing high uncertainty in long-term political predictions

Adjustments for Uncertainty:
- Wide confidence intervals
- Higher probability of shorter tenure
- Significant potential for unexpected events

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 200
Percentile 20: 350
Percentile 40: 500
Percentile 60: 700
Percentile 80: 900
Percentile 90: 1100

Rationale: The prediction reflects:
1. Typical LDP leadership tenure (2-3 years)
2. Potential for extended stay if successful
3. High uncertainty due to complex political landscape
4. Minority government challenges
5. Geopolitical and economic volatility

The distribution suggests a most likely scenario of 500-700 days, with significant variance reflecting the unpredictable nature of Japanese political leadership.
