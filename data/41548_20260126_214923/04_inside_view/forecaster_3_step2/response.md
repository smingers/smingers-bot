- Current 70% approval ratings
- First female PM with historical significance

Moderate Evidence:
- LDP membership decline
- Loss of Komeito coalition support
- Minority government challenges

Weak Evidence:
- Personal leadership ambitions
- Speculative geopolitical scenarios

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: Until 2032 (approximately 6 years)
- Current Context: 3 months into tenure, snap election upcoming
- If timeframe halved: Likely shorter, more volatile tenure
- If timeframe doubled: Potential for more stable leadership

(d) Justification Factors:
- Political Volatility: High (frequent leadership changes)
- Economic Challenges: Significant (inflation, aging population)
- Geopolitical Tensions: Increasing (China-Taiwan-US dynamics)
- Personal Leadership Potential: Mixed

Probability Calibration:
Considering historical LDP leadership patterns (2-3 years average), minority government instability, and current political context, the prediction will center around 500-700 days with significant variance.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: 2-3 years typical LDP leadership
3. Consistency Check: Median ~600, Mean ~650 (reasonable)
4. Key Evidence:
   - Snap election for public mandate
   - 70% current approval
   - Minority government challenges
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis potentially shortening tenure
