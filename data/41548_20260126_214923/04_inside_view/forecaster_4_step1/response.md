(b) Reference Class Analysis:

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

- Minority government increases volatility

(d) Justification:

- Fragile coalition dynamics
- Economic challenges
- Potential geopolitical disruptions

Outside view calibration:
- Acknowledge high variability in Japanese political landscape
- Consider potential disruptive events
- Recognize internal LDP leadership challenges
- Account for economic and geopolitical risks

Factors increasing tenure probability:
- High initial approval ratings
- Strong factional support
- Economic stimulus plans

Factors decreasing tenure probability:
- Minority government
- Potential scandals
- Economic challenges
- Geopolitical tensions

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 365
Percentile 20: 548
Percentile 40: 730
Percentile 60: 912
Percentile 80: 1,095
Percentile 90: 1,278

Rationale: The prediction reflects the typical 2-3 year LDP leadership cycle, with a wide range to account for potential unexpected events. The median (around 730 days) suggests a likely scenario of Takaichi serving approximately two years before potential replacement, while allowing for extended tenure up to nearly 3.5 years.

The distribution accounts for:
- Baseline LDP leadership patterns
- Current political instability
- Potential economic/geopolitical disruptions
- Her initial strong position

The wide interval (365-1,278 days) provides flexibility for various political scenarios while maintaining a statistically grounded approach.
