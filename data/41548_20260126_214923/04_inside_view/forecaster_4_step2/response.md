(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 2026-01-26 to 2032-01-01
- Approximately 5-6 years remaining
- If timeframe halved: Likely shorter, more volatile tenure
- If doubled: Potential for longer-term stability

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
- Political Uncertainty: Minority government
- Economic Challenges: Inflation, consumer prices
- Geopolitical Tensions: China relations, security concerns

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex political landscape, I'll adjust the previous outside view prediction with more nuanced probabilities accounting for potential disruptions.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: 730 days (typical LDP leadership)
3. Consistency Check: Median around 730-912 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Snap election for public mandate
   - 70% initial approval
   - Minority government challenges
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected scandal or economic crisis

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 85
Percentile 5: 180
Percentile 10: 365
Percentile 20: 548
Percentile 40: 730
Percentile 60: 912
Percentile 80: 1095
Percentile 90: 1278
Percentile 95: 1461
Percentile 99: 1644

Rationale: The distribution reflects typical LDP leadership cycles while accounting for Takaichi's unique position as the first female PM, with a wide range to capture potential political volatility. The median around 730-912 days suggests a likely two-year tenure, with significant uncertainty due to minority government and economic challenges.

The prediction considers her initial strong position, potential political risks, and the historical context of Japanese political leadership, providing a probabilistic view that acknowledges the complexity of her potential tenure.
