(b) Reference Class Analysis:

- Median tenure closer to 2-3 years

2. Female Political Leaders' Global Tenure
- Often shorter than male counterparts
- High variability across different political systems

3. Minority Government Leaders
- Typically less stable
- Higher likelihood of early replacement

Selected Reference Class: Japanese Prime Ministers' Tenure Length

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-01-26
- Prediction horizon: Until 2032
- Remaining time: Approximately 6 years (72 months)
- Historical Pattern: Most PMs serve 2-3 years
- Contextual Factors: Minority government, potential coalition shifts

(d) Justification:
Key Predictive Factors:
- Minority government status
- High-stakes February 2026 election
- Economic challenges
- Geopolitical tensions
- Personal leadership style limitations

Potential Destabilizing Factors:
- Inflation management
- China-Taiwan relations
- Internal LDP factional dynamics

Outside View Calibration:
- Acknowledge high uncertainty
- Consider multiple scenario probabilities
- Recognize potential for unexpected political shifts
- Account for structural constraints in Japanese political system

Calibration Considerations:
- Base rate of PM tenure: 2-3 years
- Takaichi's unique position as first female PM
- Minority government instability
- Potential external shock scenarios

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 400
Percentile 20: 600
Percentile 40: 800
Percentile 60: 1100
Percentile 80: 1400
Percentile 90: 1600

Rationale for Distribution:
- Centered around historical PM tenure averages
- Wide intervals to accommodate uncertainty
- Reflects potential for both early replacement and extended tenure
- Considers minority government dynamics
- Accounts for potential external political/economic shocks

The prediction suggests Takaichi has a reasonable chance of serving between 1-2 years, with potential extensions depending on electoral performance and economic conditions. The wide distribution reflects the inherent unpredictability of Japanese political leadership.
