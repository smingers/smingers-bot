Moderate Evidence:
- Current 70% approval ratings
- Economic challenges (inflation)
- Geopolitical tensions

Weak Evidence:
- Personal leadership ambitions
- Gender breakthrough narrative

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current date: 2026-01-26
- Prediction horizon: Until 2032
- Remaining time: Approximately 6 years (2190 days)

Sensitivity Analysis:
- If timeframe halved (1095 days): Likely shorter tenure, more volatile
- If timeframe doubled: Increased potential for extended leadership

(d) Justification:
Key Predictive Factors:
1. Minority government inherent instability
2. Complex inter-party negotiations
3. Economic and geopolitical challenges
4. Historical precedent of short PM tenures

Reference Class Calibration:
- Post-WWII Japanese PM average: 2-3 years
- Takaichi's unique position requires deviation from base rate
- Structural constraints suggest shorter-than-average tenure

Probability Calibration:
Considering the complex political landscape, minority government status, and historical PM tenure patterns, I anticipate a non-uniform distribution with higher probability of shorter tenure periods.

Checklist:
1. Target: Days Takaichi Sanae serves as Japan's PM before 2032
2. Base Rate: 2-3 years typical PM tenure
3. Consistency Check: Median around 800 days seems reasonable
4. Key Evidence:
   - Minority government
   - Snap election strategy
   - LDP structural decline
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected geopolitical crisis potentially extending tenure

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 200
Percentile 5: 300
Percentile 10: 400
Percentile 20: 600
Percentile 40: 800
Percentile 60: 1100
Percentile 80: 1400
Percentile 90: 1600
Percentile 95: 1800
Percentile 99: 1900

Rationale: The distribution reflects the high uncertainty in Japanese political leadership, with a central tendency around 800-1100 days, accounting for potential early replacement or modest tenure extension. The wide distribution acknowledges potential for unexpected political shifts while respecting the lower and upper bounds provided.
