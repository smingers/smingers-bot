These events have sparked widespread protests against ICE's active immigration policies under former President Donald Trump. In response to escalating unrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the National Guard to restore order. The situation has raised the possibility that Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act to federalize the state's National Guard, thereby stripping the governor of command. Historical precedents for such federalization include President Eisenhower's 1957 deployment to Little Rock, Arkansas; President Johnson's 1965 intervention in Alabama; President Bush's 1992 federalization during the Los Angeles riots; and President Kennedy's 1962 action in Mississippi to enforce desegregation at the University of Mississippi.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 08:59 PM\nSource: [El Nuevo Diario](https://elnuevodiario.com.do/democratas-publican-en-su-cuenta-oficial-un-unico-mensaje-sin-mas-detalles-juicio-politico-contra-kristi-noem/)\n\n**Bj\u00f6rn af Kleen: ICE Brutality in Minneapolis Signals How Trump Could Secure Power in the Midterm Elections**\nThe article claims that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), under the Trump administration, has become a tool for political repression, citing its actions in Minneapolis as evidence. It alleges that ICE has detained a five-year-old child during a school commute, labeled activists as 'domestic terrorists,' and conducted operations that provoke unrest in Democratic-leaning states. According to Robert Kagan, a prominent American historian and critic of the Republican Party, these actions are part of a strategic effort to create conditions that would justify invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807\u2014granting the federal military authority over state law enforcement. This could allow President Trump to deploy troops to seize ballots and influence the outcome of the November 2026 midterm elections, consolidating Republican control of Congress. The article draws a parallel to the 1957 Little Rock crisis, where President Eisenhower used federal troops to enforce desegregation, but warns that a similar military intervention today could instead entrench a white supremacist autocracy. The piece presents these claims without direct attribution to primary sources, relying on commentary from Kagan and assertions about ICE's role in political strategy. It references ICE\u2019s recruitment ads describing agents as 'patriots' removing 'murderers, pedophiles, gang members, rapists' from the U.S., and notes ICE\u2019s increased funding and power under Trump.

It cites multiple incidents, including the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old man carrying a legally permitted firearm at a protest, and the killing of Ren\u00e9e Good, a woman shot at close range. Despite video evidence showing no clear threat from Pretti\u2014some footage suggesting his weapon was taken before he was shot\u2014the federal authorities immediately claimed legitimate self-defense, a claim the article strongly disputes. The article criticizes the lack of cooperation between federal agents (ICE) and local police, the absence of independent investigations into federal shootings, and the politicization of the FBI under Kash Patel, with prosecutors and agents resigning over the administration\u2019s narrative. It notes that ICE agents in Minneapolis-St. Paul outnumber local police by a factor of three to four, and that federal agents, untrained in crowd control, operate without oversight. The article further claims that Trump is using these incidents to justify declaring a state of emergency under the Insurrection Act, aiming to deploy the U.S. military domestically\u2014a move historically used during racial riots and civil unrest. The author warns that Trump\u2019s strategy is not only to scare immigrants but to instill fear in the entire population, as fear is central to his political power.

President Donald Trump accused Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey of inciting insurrection against the federal government, claiming their rhetoric promotes disorder and undermines federal operations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded full support for ICE operations in Minnesota and criticized the absence of local police during the raid, alleging that state and city leaders left federal agents unprotected. He shared an image of an object he claimed was a weapon carried by the man, suggesting the agent's use of force was justified. The incident sparked immediate protests and intensified political conflict between the White House and Democratic leaders in Minnesota. Since January 1, Minnesota has seen recurring protests against federal immigration enforcement. On January 15, Trump had already threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the use of the military to suppress civil unrest when local authorities fail to maintain order. Governor Walz responded by condemning the federal operation, stating it led to a death, indiscriminate use of tear gas, and clashes with demonstrators, causing instability. He confirmed he had spoken with White House officials and requested the removal of ICE from the state, while also announcing an investigation into the shooting and rejecting premature conclusions before the facts are fully examined.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 09:34 PM\nSource: [Di\u00e1rio do Centro do Mundo](https://www.diariodocentrodomundo.com.br/minneapolis-trump-acusa-autoridades-locais-de-incitarem-insurreicao-contra-seu-governo/)\n\n**Did Trump Just Signal He's Going to Invoke Insurrection Act?**\nOn January 24, 2026, an armed man confronted Border Patrol agents in Minnesota, was shot during an attempt to disarm him, and was found carrying a firearm and two additional magazines.

He questioned why local police were not allowed to assist ICE agents, suggesting they were ordered off duty, and accused the mayor and governor of inciting insurrection through their rhetoric. Trump referenced the Insurrection Act, stating he does not believe it is necessary at this moment but would invoke it if needed, emphasizing its historical precedent\u2014used by over 40% of U.S. presidents.

The demonstrators, part of a broader movement across Minnesota, demanded airlines halt deportation flights and called for a de facto general strike by urging residents to stop using workplaces, schools, and businesses. Simultaneously, thousands of residents gathered in downtown Minneapolis despite temperatures as low as -23\u00b0C. The protests were triggered by the fatal shooting of Rene Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, by an ICE officer on January 7, 2026. Protesters emphasized that the real danger is not 'ice' (the weather), but 'ICE' (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), highlighting the symbolic weight of the acronym. The movement has seen over 700 businesses across Minnesota close in solidarity. On January 20, 2026, nationwide protests involving thousands of workers and students occurred across the U.S. to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration policies. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress the protests in Minnesota, stating that if corrupt politicians fail to stop 'agitators and rebels' attacking 'patriotic agents' of ICE, he would take decisive action as past presidents have done.

It describes the fatal shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse in Minneapolis, by masked federal agents, citing the New York Times' report that he was shot at least ten times. The piece claims that these operations, justified on paper as targeting undocumented immigrants, are in practice used to intimidate and punish citizens for voting against Trump. Stephen Miller, portrayed as a self-identified racist with a fanatical ideological vision to 'protect Western civilization' through violence, is said to have designed these actions. The article cites historian Robert Kagan, who warns that the brutality is intended to desensitize the public to state violence, paving the way for election interference during the upcoming midterm elections. The article further notes Trump\u2019s threat to invoke the 'Insurrection Act' in Minnesota and his previous threat to invade Greenland, asserting that these developments threaten not only U.S. democracy but also European and Swedish security. Despite Trump\u2019s current unpopularity among American voters and his declining support, the article argues that the U.S. democracy is now 'hanging by a thread,' echoing Benjamin Franklin\u2019s warning that a republic endures only if citizens preserve it. The piece concludes with a sense of existential dread about the future of democracy.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 10:05 PM\nSource: [Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/a/wr8P2n)\n\n**Minneapolis: Trump Accuses Local Authorities of Inciting 'Insurrection' Against His Government**\nOn Saturday, January 24, 2026, U.S. federal agents shot and killed a 37-year-old white American man with no history of violence during a raid in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Kristin Noble proposing 'politically segregated schools' for Democrats and Republicans, a search of a Washington Post journalist\u2019s home at the Defense Department\u2019s request, and President Trump accusing Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander and four others of 'seditious behavior, punishable by death.' The author questions the credibility of these reports, noting some may be satire or conspiracy theories, but emphasizes the seriousness of Noble\u2019s proposal to create separate public schools for Democrats and Republicans. Drawing from personal memory of a school policy allowing religious education absences, the author reflects on how such segregation created division, misunderstanding, and alienation between groups. The editorial argues that education should foster exposure to diverse beliefs and ideas, promoting cooperation over alienation. It concludes that Noble\u2019s controversial idea, though untenable, may serve as a catalyst for reimagining education to cultivate democratic citizenship, inclusivity, and societal cohesion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource: [Concord Monitor](https://www.concordmonitor.com/2026/01/24/my-turn-politically-segregated-schools/)\n\n**'The real danger is not ice, but ICE' \u2014 Over 100 clergy arrested in Minnesota protest against immigration enforcement**\nOn January 23, 2026 (local time), approximately 100 clergy members opposing immigration enforcement were arrested at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport in Minnesota, USA, during a protest against the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) 'largest immigration enforcement operation in history.'

The Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law first enacted in 1792 and revised in 1807, allows the U.S. president to deploy the military domestically for civilian law enforcement during 'armed rebellion' or 'domestic violence,' overriding the Posse Comitatus Act, which normally prohibits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The law has been invoked approximately 30 times in U.S. history, with the last use in 1992 by George H.W. Bush during the Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict. Trump has issued similar threats in Democratic-run states like California, Illinois, and Oregon, and has previously used Title 10 authority to deploy National Guard troops under federal control during 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,' though without police powers. His attempt to deploy troops to Chicago was blocked by the Supreme Court, which ruled he 'failed to identify a source of authority' for military enforcement in Illinois. The court\u2019s decision marked a rare setback for Trump, despite the conservative majority on the bench.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 09:35 AM\nSource: [WION](https://www.wionews.com/world/what-is-the-insurrection-act-the-19th-century-law-trump-wants-to-use-on-minnesota-s-anti-ice-protests-wion-explains-1768554284225)\n\n**Insurrection Act of 1807: What It Is and Why Trump Wants to Invoke It in Minnesota**\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807, which Donald Trump seeks to invoke in Minnesota, grants the U.S. president authority to deploy the U.S. Army and 'federalize' the National Guard at the national level to suppress insurrections, rebellions, or domestic violence.

Here is everything you need to know**\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 is a federal law that permits the U.S. president to deploy military forces within the United States to enforce federal law, suppress insurrections, or protect constitutional rights when specific conditions are met, according to PolitiFact. It overrides the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The law may be invoked if a state requests federal assistance, federal law cannot be enforced through normal means, or state authorities are unable or unwilling to protect constitutional rights\u2014though a governor's request is not required in all cases. Historically, the Act has been invoked dozens of times, notably during school desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s, and most recently in 1992 during the federal response to the Los Angeles riots. Since then, its use has been rare. If invoked, the president can deploy active-duty military or federally activated National Guard units domestically, but civilian government and courts remain intact\u2014distinguishing it from martial law, which involves military control over civilian functions and is not created by the Insurrection Act.

It has been invoked at least 30 times in U.S. history, including during the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the 1992 Rodney King riots in California. The law is intended for extreme breakdowns of law and order, not for routine protests or political disagreements. Concerns have been raised by experts and civil liberties advocates about the potential misuse of the Act, particularly in the context of protests following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, by an ICE agent in Minnesota. Critics warn that deploying the military in such situations could create a war-zone atmosphere, disproportionately impact Black communities, and set a dangerous precedent for future abuse of presidential power. The article emphasizes that the Insurrection Act was not designed to manage protests or political grievances, and its invocation risks undermining civil rights and normal law enforcement.

An initial version was passed in 1792 to empower the militia to execute federal laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions, and has since been amended multiple times. According to a 2006 Congressional Research Service report, the president must first demand that 'insurgents' disperse before deploying troops; if order is not restored, an executive order may be issued. The law was designed as a backstop when state or local authorities are unable or unwilling to maintain public order, as explained by law professor Stephen I. Vladeck. However, the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement is limited by constitutional protections for civil liberties and state sovereignty. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally prohibits the military from acting as a domestic police force. Exceptions exist under the Insurrection Act, including when a state government requests federal military assistance or when the president determines that unrest is obstructing federal laws.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 02:31 PM\nSource: [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/what-is-the-insurrection-act-of-1807/601564593)\n\n**The History of the Insurrection Act in America**\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 grants the U.S. President the authority to deploy federal troops within the United States to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion, effectively allowing federal override of state authority during crises. Enacted under Thomas Jefferson in response to frontier conflicts and fears of domestic uprisings, the Act has been invoked sparingly. Early uses include 1808 to enforce a trade embargo and 1833 when Andrew Jackson used it to counter South Carolina\u2019s nullification of federal tariffs. During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln invoked it in 1861 to suppress the Confederate rebellion\u2014the most extensive use in U.S. history. In the Reconstruction era, Ulysses S. Grant used it in 1871 to combat the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina. In the 20th century, the Act was used for civil rights enforcement: Dwight Eisenhower deployed troops in 1957 to enforce desegregation at Little Rock Central High School; John F. Kennedy in 1962 sent troops to the University of Mississippi to protect James Meredith; and Lyndon Johnson used it during the 1967 Detroit riots. George H.W. Bush invoked it in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict\u2014marking the last formal use. The Act has since remained dormant but politically salient, discussed after Hurricane Katrina (2005) and during 2020 protests, though never invoked again. Despite its rarity, the Act remains a potent legal tool, symbolizing federal authority in moments of national crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 10:14 PM\nSource: [DaveManuel.com](https://www.davemanuel.com/2025/10/18/insurrection-act-history-united-states/)\n\n**Every time Insurrection Act was invoked in US history as Trump floats use**\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy federal troops in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland to address crime and protests over immigration policy. The Insurrection Act permits a president to use military forces domestically when a state cannot suppress an insurrection or defies federal law, without requiring a governor\u2019s consent. However, critics argue that no actual insurrection exists, making such a move legally and constitutionally questionable. Legal experts, including former federal prosecutor Shanlon Wu, state that while Trump has theoretical authority, there is no factual basis for invoking the act in the context of general crime. The act has been invoked dozens of times historically, most notably during the Civil War (Abraham Lincoln, 1861), Reconstruction (Ulysses S. Grant, eight times), and civil rights enforcement (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson). The last use was in 1992 after the Rodney King police brutality verdict sparked riots in Los Angeles. Illinois and Oregon have sued to block federal troop deployments. Lawmakers like Representative Ilhan Omar and Senator Tammy Duckworth have condemned the proposal as unconstitutional and authoritarian, arguing it would be used to intimidate cities rather than protect citizens. Former federal prosecutor Joyce White Vance emphasized the act is meant for extreme situations like rebellions or invasions, not routine crime. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller claimed the situation constitutes 'domestic terrorism' and 'insurrection.' Professor Robert Reich warned the move is a prelude to authoritarianism. Despite Trump\u2019s statements, no formal invocation has occurred, and legal challenges are ongoing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 09:45 PM\nSource: [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/every-time-insurrection-act-invoked-in-us-history-trump-floats-use-10843289)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Use 1807 Insurrection Act to Bypass Courts if Blocked from Deploying Troops**\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, a 19th-century law that permits the deployment of military forces into American cities, if he is blocked from deploying troops. The law was last used in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots following the acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating Rodney King, a Black man. According to the article, Trump's threat signals a potential effort to bypass judicial constraints on military deployment. The article notes the historical significance of the law and its rare use, emphasizing its controversial nature in modern governance.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:19 PM\nSource: [Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2025/10/07/mundo/noticia/trump-ameaca-usar-lei-insurreicao-contornar-tribunais-impedido-destacar-tropas-2149953)\n\n"
