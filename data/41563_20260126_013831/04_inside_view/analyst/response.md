# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question
Will the Insurrection Act or a state of martial law be declared in relation to the 2026 U.S. midterms?

## Resolution Criteria
The Insurrection Act is invoked by the president, or martial law is declared, in relation to the 2026 U.S. midterm elections.

## Deep Research (AskNews)

There is **no evidence** in current news reports that either the Insurrection Act or martial law is being considered for deployment during the 2026 midterm elections [1][2][3][4][5][6]. While significant federal-state tensions exist over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, these actions:
1. Involve specific agencies like ICE rather than full military deployment under the Insurrection Act
2. Are framed as law enforcement operations rather than martial law declarations
3. Lack any connection to election administration or security

### Key Context from Research
1. **Active Federal-Local Conflict**: Federal immigration agents are conducting controversial operations in Minneapolis described by officials as an "occupation" [1]. Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have condemned these ICE actions after fatal shootings of unarmed civilians, with the Minnesota governor demanding President Trump end the operation [1][2].

2. **Broader Political Tensions**:  
   - The federal government is accused of authoritarian tactics resembling "South American military regimes" [2], but these focus on immigration enforcement, not elections
   - Project 2025 (a conservative governance plan) includes radical restructuring of power but doesn't mention election-related martial law in available documentation [6]
   - Transatlantic tensions are escalating due to Trump's foreign policy [3][4], diverting attention from domestic election security

3. **No Election Linkages Found**:  
   - Zero sources mention midterm elections, voting security, or election administration in connection with military or emergency powers
   - All federal-state conflicts center on immigration enforcement and jurisdictional disputes, not election integrity or disruptions [1][2][6]

### Limitations and Caveats
- The search focused on January 2026 events—situations could evolve before November midterms
- No information was found about Department of Defense or National Guard election contingency plans
- Sources show heightened political polarization but no imminent election-related military deployment [2][6]

### Conclusion
Based on currently available information, there are **no indications** that the Insurrection Act (which allows presidential deployment of troops domestically) or martial law will be invoked for the 2026 midterms. The significant federal-state conflicts revolve exclusively around immigration enforcement operations, not election processes. I'll continue monitoring for developments as the election approaches.

*Sources reflect real-time reporting from January 2026 but show no election-military nexus: Minneapolis federal operation [1][2], transatlantic tensions [3][4], Ukraine policy impacts [5], and Project 2025 analysis [6].*

## News Articles (AskNews)

Here are the relevant news articles:

**Democrats Post 'Political Trial against Kristi Noem' Amid ICE Violence and National Guard Activation in Minnesota**
The Democratic Party of the United States posted a single message on its official X (formerly Twitter) account: 'Political Trial against Kristi Noem,' generating national anticipation in the U.S. The post follows a series of incidents in Minneapolis involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, including the deaths of three individuals: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen shot multiple times; Renee Good, another 37-year-old U.S. citizen fatally shot inside a vehicle; and a Venezuelan immigrant who also died during an ICE operation. These events have sparked widespread protests against ICE's active immigration policies under former President Donald Trump. In response to escalating unrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the National Guard to restore order. The situation has raised the possibility that Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act to federalize the state's National Guard, thereby stripping the governor of command. Historical precedents for such federalization include President Eisenhower's 1957 deployment to Little Rock, Arkansas; President Johnson's 1965 intervention in Alabama; President Bush's 1992 federalization during the Los Angeles riots; and President Kennedy's 1962 action in Mississippi to enforce desegregation at the University of Mississippi.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence from the news article is relatively recent, being published in January 2026, just a few months before the midterm elections. The source, El Nuevo Diario, appears to be a credible Spanish-language news outlet. While the article discusses federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement, it does not directly link these events to the 2026 midterm elections or indicate any plans for invoking the Insurrection Act or declaring martial law. The base rate already accounts for historical precedents of the Insurrection Act being used, so this evidence does not significantly update the base rate.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
**STRONG Evidence:** None
**MODERATE Evidence:** None
**WEAK Evidence:** 
- The article discusses federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement in Minnesota, which could potentially escalate, but does not directly link these events to the 2026 midterm elections or indicate any plans for invoking the Insurrection Act or declaring martial law.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
The weak evidence from the news article does not push the probability up or down from the base rate, as it does not directly address the question of whether the Insurrection Act or martial law will be declared in relation to the 2026 midterm elections.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from the base rate of 6.5%:
- No adjustments are made, as the evidence does not significantly update the base rate.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** 0%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** The base rate of 6.5% is not an extreme prediction, so there is no need for a significant adjustment.
2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate is appropriate given the historical precedents for the Insurrection Act and martial law declarations in the United States.
3. **Update magnitude:** The lack of evidence updates is proportional to the weak evidence found.
4. **Regression to mean:** The base rate already accounts for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
Based on the current research, there is no strong or moderate evidence to suggest that the Insurrection Act or martial law will be declared in relation to the 2026 U.S. midterm elections. The news article discusses federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement in Minnesota, but these events do not appear to be directly linked to election security or administration. While the situation in Minnesota could potentially escalate, the available information does not indicate any imminent plans for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act or declare martial law specifically in the context of the midterm elections.

Given my role as a geopolitical analyst, I will continue to monitor the situation closely for any developments that could impact election security and administration. However, based on the current evidence, I do not see a strong case for adjusting the base rate significantly from the original 6.5%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 6.5%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 6.5%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 6.5%**
