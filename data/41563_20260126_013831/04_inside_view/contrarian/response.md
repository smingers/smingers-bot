# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will the Insurrection Act or a state of martial law be declared in relation to the 2026 U.S. midterms?

## Resolution Criteria
The Insurrection Act is invoked by the president to deploy federal troops domestically, or a state of martial law is declared, in relation to the 2026 U.S. midterm elections.

## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 6.5%
**Reference Classes Used:** Invocation of the Insurrection Act in the United States, Declarations of martial law in the United States
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 8/10

## Current Research

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence presented is relatively recent, with the most relevant information from January 2026. The sources appear credible, including mainstream media outlets and government officials. There is no clear evidence of significant biases in the reporting. However, the information may not fully capture the rapidly evolving political and security situation leading up to the November 2026 midterm elections.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:**
None

**MODERATE Evidence:**
1. Heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, including National Guard activation and accusations of authoritarian tactics. This suggests a potential for escalating conflict between the federal government and state/local authorities, but does not directly link it to election security or the potential use of the Insurrection Act.

**WEAK Evidence:**
1. The Democratic Party's social media post about a "political trial against Kristi Noem" is vague and lacks clear context or connection to the Insurrection Act or martial law.
2. The historical precedents for Insurrection Act invocation and martial law declarations, while relevant, do not necessarily indicate a high likelihood of such actions being taken in the 2026 midterm elections.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**MODERATE Evidence:**
1. This evidence pushes the probability UP from the base rate by a small to moderate amount (perhaps 1-3 percentage points) because it suggests an increased potential for federal-state conflict, which could create conditions more favorable for Insurrection Act invocation or martial law declarations. However, the connection to the midterm elections is not direct.

**WEAK Evidence:**
1. The Democratic Party social media post does not provide enough information to warrant an adjustment from the base rate.
2. The historical precedents are already reflected in the base rate and do not require a further adjustment.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 6.5%:
- Adjustment 1: +2% for the heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota
- Cumulative adjustment: +2%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is very low (e.g., <10%), it would mean that there is an extremely low likelihood of the Insurrection Act being invoked or martial law being declared, even in the face of significant federal-state conflicts and political polarization. This would require a belief that the U.S. political and institutional safeguards are extremely robust and would prevent such actions, even in a highly contentious electoral environment.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 6.5% is already quite low, and my adjusted prediction of 8.5% is not a large deviation. The evidence, though moderate, supports a small increase from the base rate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of my update (2 percentage points) is proportional to the strength of the moderate evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not making a large adjustment from the base rate.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I am looking for reasons the consensus might be wrong and identifying potential blind spots. While the current evidence does not indicate a high likelihood of the Insurrection Act being invoked or martial law being declared in relation to the 2026 midterm elections, there are some factors that could make the base rate misleading.

The heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, including the activation of the National Guard, suggest a potential for escalating conflicts between the federal government and state/local authorities. This could create an environment more conducive to the president invoking the Insurrection Act or declaring martial law, even if such actions are not directly linked to the midterm elections.

However, the evidence is still relatively moderate, and there are no clear indications that the federal government is actively planning or considering such measures specifically in relation to the 2026 midterm elections. The historical precedents for Insurrection Act invocation and martial law declarations, while relevant, do not necessarily indicate a high likelihood of these actions being taken in the current political context.

Additionally, the vague social media post from the Democratic Party provides little concrete information and does not warrant a significant adjustment from the base rate.

Overall, while I believe the base rate may be slightly underestimating the potential for Insurrection Act invocation or martial law declarations due to the heightened federal-state tensions, the evidence is not strong enough to justify a large deviation from the starting point. My contrarian perspective leads me to modestly increase the probability, but I still maintain a relatively low estimate compared to the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 6.5%
- Total adjustment: +2%
- Final estimate: 8.5%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 8.5%**
