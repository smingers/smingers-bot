# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: historian
You are a historian and superforecaster. Focus on historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past. Consider how often similar situations have resolved in various ways. Use history to inform your probability estimate.

## Question

## Current Research
# Research Synthesis

**Generated:** 2026-01-26T01:41:30.286078+00:00
**Total Sources:** 2

## Step 1: Source Analysis
The information provided is fairly recent, dating from January 2026, which is close to the 2026 midterm elections. The sources appear to be credible, reputable news outlets. However, there is a potential for some bias in the reporting, as the situation involves political tensions and partisan conflicts. Additionally, the base rate already incorporates some historical precedents for Insurrection Act invocations and martial law declarations, so the new information may not represent a significant departure from the starting point.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- None

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The article describes heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, with the state governor condemning the federal actions and calling for an end to the "occupation." This suggests a potential for escalation, but the conflict is focused on immigration, not election processes.
- [Evidence 2]: The article mentions broader political tensions and transatlantic conflicts, which could create an environment of instability, but there is no direct link to the 2026 midterm elections or the use of emergency powers.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The article references the Democratic Party's cryptic post about a "Political Trial against Kristi Noem," which could be interpreted as a sign of political turmoil, but the connection to the midterm elections or the use of the Insurrection Act is unclear.
- [Evidence 2]: The article discusses the possibility of the President invoking the Insurrection Act to federalize the National Guard in Minnesota, but this is presented as a hypothetical scenario, not an imminent action.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota push the probability slightly UP from the base rate, by approximately 1-2 percentage points. This suggests an increased risk of escalation, but the conflict is not directly related to the midterm elections.
- [Evidence 2]: The broader political tensions and transatlantic conflicts push the probability slightly UP from the base rate, by approximately 1 percentage point. However, these factors do not appear to be directly linked to the midterm elections or the use of emergency powers.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The Democratic Party's cryptic post about a "Political Trial against Kristi Noem" does not provide enough information to warrant a significant adjustment from the base rate.
- [Evidence 2]: The hypothetical scenario of the President invoking the Insurrection Act to federalize the National Guard in Minnesota is not supported by concrete evidence and does not warrant a significant adjustment from the base rate.

## Step 4: Integration
Starting from 6.5%:
- Adjustment 1: +1.5% for the heightened federal-state tensions over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota
- Adjustment 2: +1% for the broader political tensions and transatlantic conflicts
- Cumulative adjustment: +2.5%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to exceed 10%, it would mean that there is a significant likelihood of the Insurrection Act or martial law being declared, which would require strong, clear evidence of imminent and severe threats to the electoral process. The current evidence does not support such a scenario.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The total adjustment of +2.5% from the base rate of 6.5% is relatively modest and can be justified by the moderate evidence of heightened political tensions and the potential for escalation, even though the conflicts are not directly related to the midterm elections.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the moderate evidence pushing the probability up by 1-2 percentage points, and the weak evidence not warranting significant adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the tendency of extreme predictions to miss, the final estimate of 9% is still within a reasonable range and does not represent an overly optimistic or pessimistic assessment.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I have considered the relevant historical precedents and analogous situations to inform my probability estimate. While the current evidence suggests heightened political tensions and the potential for escalation, the conflicts are primarily focused on immigration enforcement operations, not the electoral process or the use of emergency powers.

The invocation of the Insurrection Act or the declaration of martial law in relation to the 2026 midterm elections would be a highly unusual and consequential event, with significant historical precedents to consider. The base rate of 6.5% already incorporates these historical patterns, and the new information does not provide a clear, direct link between the current tensions and the potential deployment of military or emergency powers for election-related purposes.

The moderate evidence of heightened federal-state tensions and broader political instability pushes the probability slightly upward, but the overall likelihood remains relatively low, given the lack of a clear causal mechanism connecting these factors to the 2026 midterm elections. I will continue to monitor the situation closely as the election approaches, but based on the current information, I do not see a strong case for a significant deviation from the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 6.5%
- Total adjustment: +2.5%
- Final estimate: 9%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 9%**
