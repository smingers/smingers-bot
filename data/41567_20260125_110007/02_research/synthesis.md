The Israel-Hamas War is a war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas, that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the territory. The next day, Israel declared war for the first time since the Yom Kippur War (1973). Although Israel’s war objectives sought to dismantle Hamas and bring back the more than 240 people taken hostage during the October 7 attack, it later came under intense international criticism for the mounting death toll, which exceeded 70,000 in November 2025, and the widespread destruction throughout the Gaza Strip. Pressure on the Israeli government from abroad and at home, where many Israelis called for a ceasefire that would lead to an immediate return of the hostages, culminated eventually in a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in October 2025, which mediators hoped would bring an end to the war. The ceasefire went into effect on October 10, and the final surviving hostages were released on October 13.
The October 7, 2023, attack
The election of Hamas in 2006 and its subsequent takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007 prompted Israel and Egypt to blockade the enclave. A series of short conflicts took place between Hamas and Israel, most notably in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021, but Israel generally considered the security threat from Hamas to be contained and manageable. With the conclusion in 2020 of the Abraham Accords, a set of normalization agreements between Israel and several Muslim-majority countries, the Arab states increasingly put aside the issue of Palestinian self-determination while other international actors, such as the United States, sought to shift global interest away from the Middle East to other regions. With the world’s eyes turned elsewhere, frustration was mounting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank with the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, new provocations in Jerusalem around Al-Aqsa Mosque and in nearby neighborhoods, and, beginning in 2022, some of the worst confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank in decades. In late 2023 the United States was reportedly on the verge of concluding an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations, a development that was later considered to be a factor in the timing of the October 7 attack.
Hamas, along with other militants in the Gaza Strip, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), carried out t

The Israel-Hamas war's devastating human toll after 2 years, by the numbers
Over 67,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, officials say.
Tuesday marks two years since the Israel-Hamas war began, bringing devastation across the region.
The war -- which started after Hamas launched a surprise terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed roughly 1,200 Israelis, and Israel responded by declaring war -- has led to thousands of people killed and injured in the Gaza Strip and Israel, as Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Gaza has been experiencing a worsening humanitarian crisis. Fewer than half of the region's hospitals are functioning, all of them partially, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A growing number of children are either at risk of or are suffering from acute malnutrition due to a lack of food, according to humanitarian groups.
Here is a look at the tragic human toll of the war over the past two years, by the numbers.
Casualties of war
In Israel, about 2,000 people have been killed, including about 900 civilians during the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks and at least 913 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers since the war began, according to Israeli officials.
Additionally, more than 20,000 IDF soldiers have been injured since the war began, according to the Israel Ministry of Defense.
In Gaza, more than 67,000 people have been killed, and more than 169,600 people have been injured as of Oct. 6, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.
Earlier this year, the United Nations (U.N.) said at least 11,000 people in Gaza remain missing. Some may be buried under the rubble, meaning the true death toll could be higher.
In Israel, more than 100,000 people have been internally displaced due to the war, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, about 1.9 million, or 90% of the population, have been displaced, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Israeli hostages
When Hamas launched its terrorist attack, militants kidnapped nearly 250 hostages -- including women, children and elderly adults -- and took them into Gaza.
As of Oct. 6, 140 hostages have come out of Gaza alive, having been swapped for prisoners being held in Israel, Israeli officials said. The largest hostage release came on Nov. 24. 2023, during a pause in fighting.
An additional eight hostages were rescued in IDF operations.
About 48 hostages remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 people no longer believed to be alive, according to Israeli officials. The latter figure includes the bodies of two Americans and the body of a hostage held in Gaza since 2014.
The IDF has so far recovered the remains of 57 hostages inside Gaza.
Collapse of Gaza's health care system
Before the war, 36 hospitals were functioning in Gaza -- excluding field hospitals -- according to the WHO.
As of Oct. 2, 22 hospitals have stopped functioning. Four hospitals were for

What was the outcome of the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War?
The 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War secured Israel’s independence, the establishment of a temporary border with its neighbors, and resulted in the beginning of a Palestinian refugee crisis. It is known as the War of Independence in Israel and the Nakba (Arabic for “Catastrophe”) in the Arab world due to the displacement of many Palestinians.
Hostilities in the Yom Kippur War lasted until October 26 and formally ended with a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Egypt on November 11, 1973, and with Syria on May 31, 1974. A peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was signed on March 26, 1979, following the conclusion of the Camp David Accords.
How many wars have been fought between Arab countries and Israel?
After decades of confrontations between Arabs and Jews under the British mandate of Palestine, where both communities sought self-determination after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, the United Kingdom announced its intention in 1947 to withdraw its forces from Palestine and endorsedUnited Nations Resolution 181, which partitioned the British mandate into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The plan, although accepted by the international community, was rejected by the Arabs, and in May 1948, as British forces withdrew, Israel was born in a region with unresolved disputes over borders, security, land ownership, and other matters. Since that time, Israel has fought a number of conflicts with various Arab forces, most notably in 1948–49, 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982, 2006, and 2023–present. This article focuses on those conflicts with significant consequences for the broader Middle East region, although the 2025 Israel-Iran Conflict, which did not involve any Arab actors, is discussed separately here.

As Israel turns its focus to Iran, the death toll mounts in Gaza — and hunger deepens
GAZA CITY and DUBAI — Israel's primary focus is now its war with Iran, but Israeli troops are still holding territory deep inside Gaza, and Tuesday marked the deadliest day in recent weeks for Palestinians there trying to reach food distribution sites and trucks.
Health officials in Gaza say at least 59 people were killed by Israeli military drones and artillery fire Tuesday, and more than 200 wounded, trying to get food. Most of the deaths, at least 45, occurred at an intersection in southern Gaza's city of Khan Younis, where a large crowd of people had amassed waiting for trucks to enter carrying flour.
It was the deadliest single incident of people desperately trying to lay their hands on food since late March, when Israel began allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza following nearly three months of total blockade.
Israeli attacks on Palestinians trying to reach food aid since March 27 have killed at least 400 people and wounded more than 3,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which releases daily death counts. Those killed while seeking aid are among the ministry's overall death toll of nearly 55,500 people killed in the war.
Israel says its restrictions on food and its continued blockade of other aid is to keep the items from benefiting Hamas. The group holds an estimated 20 hostages still alive and the bodies of 33 deceased hostages, taken in the deadly Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
The aid restrictions have plunged families in Gaza into extreme hunger. Half a million people in Gaza are now starving and the entire territory is at risk of famine, according to a report last month by dozens of independent experts on hunger.
"I saw so many dead people"
People began amassing late Monday afternoon in an area of Khan Younis on word that aid trucks were going to enter from Israel, said Salim Saigaly.
The 32-year-old teacher walked from his tent encampment near the coast for several hours in the hopes of getting a sack of flour to feed his four children.
"Most of the time I try to distract my children when they talk of hunger, until they go to sleep," he said, adding that often doesn't work. "So, I decided to go and take the risk and get some flour."
He and others slept on the road overnight, waiting for the trucks. He said he was planning to grab a sack of flour off the trucks, but was also carrying the equivalent of $170 to buy one from others there in case he couldn't get it on his own.
Palestinian survivors and doctors say just before 9 a.m., the crowd swelled and moved closer to the main roundabout, which is in an area Israel has ordered evacuated. They say that's when Israeli drones fired onto the crowd. Artillery shells were also fired.
Israel's military told NPR the incident is under review and took place near an area where troops are.
"Luckily for me, shrapnel did not hit me, but what actually fell over me were pieces of human flesh and bones
