# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what might make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will attacks on Israel cause 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order before March 1, 2026?

### [Israel-Hamas War (Gaza Conflict) | Explanation, Summary, Ceasefire, Casualties, & Map](https://www.britannica.com/event/Israel-Hamas-War) (3 days ago)
> The Israel-Hamas War is the war between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas, that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas...

This article provides historical context on the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas, including the October 2023 attack that sparked the war. It suggests that the situation in the region has been tense for years, with a series of short conflicts between the two sides. This provides some relevant background, but does not directly address the specific question of whether attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order will occur before March 2026.

### [The Israel-Hamas war's devastating human toll after 2 years, by the numbers](https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-hamas-wars-devastating-human-toll-after-2/story?id=126252242) (Oct 7, 2025)
> Tuesday marks two years since the Israel-Hamas war began, bringing devastation across the region.

This article provides more recent and relevant information, detailing the significant human toll of the ongoing conflict. It notes that over 67,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began in 2023, and that the region is experiencing a worsening humanitarian crisis. This suggests that the conflict remains intense and deadly, which could increase the likelihood of future attacks causing 5+ casualties. However, the article does not directly address the probability of such an event occurring before March 2026.

## Your Task

Starting from the base rate of 32.0%, adjust based on current evidence. Show your full reasoning.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The most relevant information is from the past 2-3 years, as it provides the most up-to-date picture of the ongoing conflict. The sources, such as Britannica and ABC News, appear to be credible and reputable. There is no obvious bias in the reporting, and the information seems to be factual rather than speculative.

However, the sources do not directly address the specific question of whether attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order will occur before March 2026. The information is more focused on the general escalation of the conflict and its devastating human toll. As such, this evidence may not be fully priced into the base rate, which is more focused on the specific outcome in question.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- None

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with a history of short but intense confrontations, suggests an increased likelihood of future attacks causing 5+ casualties.
- The worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the high death toll from the conflict (over 67,000 in 2 years) indicate that the situation remains volatile and could lead to further escalation.

**WEAK Evidence**
- None

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**MODERATE Evidence pushing UP:**
- The history of the conflict and the current volatile situation suggest an increased likelihood of future attacks causing 5+ casualties. This evidence pushes the probability up from the base rate by approximately 10 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence pushing DOWN:**
- None

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 32.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the increased likelihood of future attacks due to the ongoing conflict and volatile situation
- Cumulative adjustment: +10%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is very low (<10%), it would likely mean that the conflict has somehow been resolved or deescalated in a way that is not captured by the current evidence. If my prediction is very high (>90%), it would likely mean that I am overreacting to the current situation and not considering the potential for de-escalation or conflict resolution.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 32.0% seems reasonable given the historical context of the conflict. My adjustment of +10% is not an extreme deviation from the base rate and can be justified by the current evidence.

3. **Update magnitude:** The +10% adjustment seems proportional to the moderate strength of the evidence, as it does not represent an extreme update.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have not accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss, as my final estimate is not an extreme value.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I want to challenge the obvious narrative and consider what might be overlooked. The base rate of 32.0% seems reasonable given the historical context of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. However, the current evidence suggests that the situation remains volatile and the likelihood of future attacks causing 5+ casualties may be higher than the base rate.

The ongoing conflict, with a history of short but intense confrontations, and the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza indicate that the region is still in a state of heightened tension. The high death toll from the conflict (over 67,000 in 2 years) suggests that the situation could further escalate, leading to the possibility of future attacks causing 5+ casualties.

While the sources do not directly address the specific question of whether such an event will occur before March 2026, the overall context of the conflict points to an increased risk compared to the base rate. As a contrarian, I want to push back against any complacency or overconfidence in the base rate and highlight the potential for further escalation.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 32.0%
- Total adjustment: +10%
- Final estimate: 42.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 42.0%**
