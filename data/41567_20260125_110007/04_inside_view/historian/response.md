### [Israel-Hamas War (Gaza Conflict) | Explanation, Summary, Ceasefire, Casualties, & Map](https://www.britannica.com/event/Israel-Hamas-War)
> The Israel-Hamas War is the war between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas, that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the territory. The next day, Israel declared war for the first time since the Yom Kippur War (1973). Although Israel's war objectives sought to dismantle Hamas and bring back the more than 240 people taken hostage during the October 7 attack, it later came under intense international criticism for the mounting death toll, which exceeded 70,000 in November 2025, and the widespread destruction throughout the Gaza Strip.

### [The Israel-Hamas war's devastating human toll after 2 years, by the numbers](https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-hamas-wars-devastating-human-toll-after-2/story?id=126252242)
> Tuesday marks two years since the Israel-Hamas war began, bringing devastation across the region. The war -- which started after Hamas launched a surprise terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed roughly 1,200 Israelis, and Israel responded by declaring war -- has led to thousands of people killed and injured in the Gaza Strip and Israel, as Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The most relevant information in these sources is from the last 2-3 years, covering the 2023 Israel-Hamas war and its aftermath. The sources are from reputable news outlets (Britannica, ABC News) and provide detailed, fact-based reporting on the events, so they are considered credible. 

There does not appear to be any significant bias in the reporting, as the articles cover both the Israeli and Palestinian perspectives and casualties. The information on the 2023 war and its devastating impact is likely already priced into the base rate, as it represents a major historical precedent.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- The 2023 Israel-Hamas war resulted in over 70,000 casualties in the Gaza Strip and the holding of over 240 Israeli hostages, demonstrating the potential for large-scale attacks on Israel.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The 2023 war led to a nationwide shelter order in Israel, suggesting that such orders are a possible outcome of attacks on Israel.

**WEAK Evidence**
- There is limited information on the likelihood of attacks on Israel causing 5+ casualties before March 2026, as the sources focus more on the 2023 conflict and its aftermath.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence**
- The 2023 war shows the potential for large-scale attacks on Israel that could cause 5+ casualties. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The nationwide shelter order during the 2023 war suggests this is a plausible outcome of attacks on Israel. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence**
- The limited information on the likelihood of attacks causing 5+ casualties before March 2026 does not significantly change the base rate.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 32.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +12.5% for the potential of large-scale attacks based on the 2023 war
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for the likelihood of nationwide shelter orders based on the 2023 war
- Cumulative adjustment: +20.0%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability was over 90%, it would mean that attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order are virtually certain to occur before March 2026, which seems unlikely given the historical precedent of the 2023 war and the uncertainty around future events.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20 percentage point increase from the base rate is justified by the strong historical precedent of the 2023 war and the moderate likelihood of nationwide shelter orders, which are significant factors not fully captured in the original base rate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The 10-15 percentage point increase for the strong evidence and 5-10 percentage point increase for the moderate evidence seem proportional to the strength of the evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the extreme nature of the 2023 war, there is a possibility that future events may not be as severe, so some regression to the mean should be accounted for.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I believe the 2023 Israel-Hamas war is a crucial precedent that should heavily inform the probability estimate for this question. The scale of the 2023 conflict, with over 70,000 casualties in Gaza and the holding of over 240 Israeli hostages, demonstrates the potential for large-scale attacks on Israel that could result in 5+ casualties. Additionally, the nationwide shelter order during the 2023 war suggests this is a plausible outcome of future attacks.

However, the 2023 war was an exceptionally severe event, and there is a possibility that future attacks may not reach the same level of devastation. As such, I have adjusted the base rate upward by 20 percentage points to account for the strong historical precedent and moderate likelihood of nationwide shelter orders, but not to the full extent that the 2023 war would suggest.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Potential for large-scale attacks based on 2023 war
- Moderate evidence pointing UP: Likelihood of nationwide shelter orders based on 2023 war
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 32.0%
- Total adjustment: +20.0%
- Final estimate: 52.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 52.0%**
