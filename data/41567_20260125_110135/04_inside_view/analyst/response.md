**Full Article:**
Military officials warn that a full Israeli occupation of Gaza could lead to heavy IDF casualties, with "dozens" of soldiers at risk of being killed and many more wounded, according to Kan public broadcaster reports. The operation also threatens the safety of hostages held by Hamas, as IDF forces have so far avoided areas where hostages are believed to be held. There is growing tension between Israel's political leadership and military command, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushing for full occupation while IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir advocates for a slower, encirclement strategy around Gaza City. Netanyahu reportedly rejected Zamir's caution and ordered preparations for occupation.

**Full Article:**
An Israeli military official has for the first time acknowledged that Iranian strikes hit "very few" military sites in Israel during last month's 12-day war. This confirmation follows a report citing satellite data from Oregon State University, which indicated that Iranian ballistic missiles struck five Israeli military bases, including Tel Nof Airbase, Glilot Intel Base, and Zipporit Armor & Weapons Production Base. The official stated the sites remain functional, but did not reveal locations or damage severity. The war, which also saw 36 other Iranian missiles impact Israel, ended with a US-brokered ceasefire.

**Full Article:**
Geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova warns that Hamas is facing an existential crisis amid ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza. While international efforts push for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu may refuse to accept all conditions proposed by Hamas, complicating peace efforts. Recent Hamas attacks, including ambushes and rocket fire, have intensified the conflict, leading to casualties among Israeli troops and retaliatory airstrikes. With critical infrastructure in Gaza targeted and high tensions persisting, Hamas' negotiating position appears increasingly precarious. Analysts suggest that Israel's uncompromising stance could prolong hostilities, while the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Watch

**Full Article:**
At least 27 people were injured, two critically, after a Yemeni drone struck Eilat, southern Israel, near popular tourist hotels. Israeli media confirmed sirens, power outages, and a failed interception attempt by the military. Reports say another ballistic missile from Yemen was intercepted over central Israel. The attack is the second in less than a week, with the Houthis warning operations will not stop. Sayyed Abdul Malik al-Houthi declared Yemen's actions as a "legitimate response" in support of Palestine, vowing more strikes and continuation of the Red Sea blockade against Israeli shipping.#Israel #Eilat #DroneStrike #Yemen #Houthis #MiddleEast #BreakingNews #Gaza #RedSea #Palestine

## Your Task

Starting from the base rate of 21.4%, adjust based on current evidence. Show your full reasoning.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

Evaluate the quality and recency of the evidence:
- The most relevant information is from 2025, which is recent and directly addresses the question.
- The sources appear credible, including mainstream news outlets and military/geopolitical analysts.
- There is no obvious bias in the reporting, as the articles cover both sides of the conflict.
- Some of the information, such as the tensions between the Israeli military and political leadership, may already be priced into the base rate.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence** (Multiple independent sources, clear causal mechanism, strong precedent)
- ["Hamas Will Inflict Pain": IDF Fears Huge Casualties If It Follows Netanyahu's 'Invade Gaza' Order]: This article suggests that a full Israeli occupation of Gaza could lead to heavy IDF casualties, which would push the probability down.
- ["Yes, We Were Hit": Five Israeli Bases Bombarded By Iran Missiles | Big Admission By Israel]: This article confirms that Iranian strikes hit Israeli military sites, which could push the probability up.

**MODERATE Evidence** 
- [Netanyahu Set To Back Out Of Truce? Sensational Reveal By Top Strategist | Gaza Crisis]: This article suggests that ongoing hostilities and tension between Israel and Hamas could prolong the conflict, which could push the probability up.

**WEAK Evidence**
- ["Drone Blast, Power Outage, 27 Injured": Houthi Twin Drone Strikes Create Chaos In Eilat | Watch]: This article describes a specific drone attack, but it is not clear how representative this is of the overall situation.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**Strong Evidence Pointing UP:**
- ["Yes, We Were Hit": Five Israeli Bases Bombarded By Iran Missiles | Big Admission By Israel]: This confirms that Iranian strikes have hit Israeli military sites, which increases the risk of escalation and further attacks. I estimate this pushes the probability up by approximately 5 percentage points.

**Strong Evidence Pointing DOWN:**
- ["Hamas Will Inflict Pain": IDF Fears Huge Casualties If It Follows Netanyahu's 'Invade Gaza' Order]: This suggests that a full Israeli occupation of Gaza could lead to heavy IDF casualties, which would likely deter such an operation and reduce the risk of a major attack. I estimate this pushes the probability down by approximately 7 percentage points.

**Moderate Evidence Pointing UP:**
- [Netanyahu Set To Back Out Of Truce? Sensational Reveal By Top Strategist | Gaza Crisis]: This indicates that ongoing hostilities and tension between Israel and Hamas could prolong the conflict, increasing the risk of attacks. I estimate this pushes the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 21.4%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for confirmation of Iranian strikes on Israeli military sites
- Adjustment 2: -7% for IDF concerns over heavy casualties from a Gaza occupation
- Adjustment 3: +3% for prolonged hostilities between Israel and Hamas
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +1%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is very low (<10%), it would likely require a major de-escalation or ceasefire between Israel and its adversaries, which does not seem highly likely based on the current evidence. If my prediction is very high (>90%), it would likely require a significant breakdown in Israel's defenses or a major provocation that leads to a large-scale attack, which also does not seem highly likely.

2. **Base rate anchor:** My adjustment of +1 percentage point from the base rate seems reasonable given the mixed nature of the evidence, with some factors pushing the probability up and others pushing it down.

3. **Update magnitude:** My updates seem proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (on IDF casualties and Iranian strikes) resulting in the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not making a large adjustment from the base rate.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, I have reviewed the current evidence on the likelihood of attacks on Israel causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order before March 1, 2026. The key factors I have considered are:

- The tension between the Israeli political leadership and military command, with the political leadership pushing for a full occupation of Gaza despite warnings from the military about the risk of heavy casualties. This suggests the probability may be lower than the base rate, as the military's caution could deter such an operation.
- Confirmation that Iranian strikes have hit Israeli military sites, which could increase the risk of escalation and further attacks, pushing the probability up.
- Ongoing hostilities and tension between Israel and Hamas, which could prolong the conflict and increase the risk of attacks, pushing the probability up.

Overall, the evidence presents a mixed picture, with some factors pushing the probability up and others pushing it down. Based on my analysis, I have adjusted the base rate of 21.4% upwards by 1 percentage point to 22.4%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Confirmation of Iranian strikes on Israeli military sites
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: IDF concerns over heavy casualties from a Gaza occupation
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 21.4%
- Total adjustment: +1%
- Final estimate: 22.4%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 22.4%**
