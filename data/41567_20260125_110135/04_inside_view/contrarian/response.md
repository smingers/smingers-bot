This article suggests that a full Israeli occupation of Gaza could lead to heavy IDF casualties, with "dozens" of soldiers at risk of being killed and many more wounded. This is a strong piece of evidence pointing DOWN from the base rate, as it suggests the Israeli military is wary of the potential for high casualties in an escalation against Gaza.

This article confirms that Iranian strikes did hit several Israeli military bases, though the official stated the sites remain functional. This is moderate evidence pointing UP from the base rate, as it suggests Israel's defenses are being tested and could potentially be overwhelmed in a future conflict.

This article reports on a Yemeni drone strike on Eilat, Israel, which injured 27 people and caused power outages. This is moderate evidence pointing UP from the base rate, as it suggests Israel's defenses are being tested and could potentially be overwhelmed in a future conflict.

This article provides historical context on some of the deadliest military conflicts, but does not directly relate to the current situation in Israel. It is not relevant to the current evidence adjustment.

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The most relevant information is from 2025, which is fairly recent. The sources appear to be credible news outlets, though there may be some potential for bias in reporting on the ongoing conflict. The information about IDF fears of high casualties and Israeli bases being struck does not seem to be fully priced into the base rate, which was based on a broader set of reference classes.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence** (Multiple independent sources, clear causal mechanism, strong precedent)
- None

**MODERATE Evidence** (Single credible source, indirect links, weak precedent)
- The IDF's fears of high casualties in a Gaza invasion (DOWN)
- The confirmation of Iranian missile strikes on Israeli bases (UP)
- The potential for Netanyahu to back out of a truce with Hamas (UP)
- The Houthi drone strikes on Eilat, Israel (UP)

**WEAK Evidence** (Anecdotes, speculation, volatile indicators)
- None

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**IDF Fears of High Casualties (DOWN):** This evidence suggests the Israeli military is very wary of the potential for high casualties in an escalation against Gaza, which could make them more cautious about launching such an operation. This pushes the probability DOWN from the base rate by approximately 5 percentage points.

**Confirmation of Iranian Missile Strikes (UP):** The fact that Iranian missiles did hit several Israeli military bases, even if the damage was limited, suggests Israel's defenses are being tested and could potentially be overwhelmed in a future conflict. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 3 percentage points.

**Potential for Netanyahu to Back Out of Truce (UP):** The possibility that Netanyahu may refuse to accept Hamas' ceasefire conditions suggests the conflict could continue to escalate, increasing the chances of attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 3 percentage points.

**Houthi Drone Strikes on Eilat (UP):** The drone strikes on Eilat, which injured 27 people, demonstrate Israel's vulnerability to attacks from non-state actors. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 3 percentage points.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 21.4%:
- Adjustment 1: -5% for IDF fears of high casualties
- Adjustment 2: +3% for confirmation of Iranian missile strikes
- Adjustment 3: +3% for potential for Netanyahu to back out of truce
- Adjustment 4: +3% for Houthi drone strikes on Eilat
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +4%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is very low (<10%), it would likely mean that the Israeli military is able to effectively deter and defend against all potential attacks, even in the face of escalating tensions. If my prediction is very high (>90%), it would likely mean that the situation in Israel/Gaza has deteriorated to the point of almost certain conflict.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 4 percentage point adjustment from the base rate of 21.4% is justified by the moderate evidence suggesting increased risk of attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (IDF fears) leading to a 5 percentage point adjustment, and the moderate evidence leading to 3 percentage point adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not making a larger adjustment from the base rate.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I have identified several pieces of evidence that suggest the base rate of 21.4% may be too low. The IDF's fears of high casualties in a Gaza invasion, the confirmation of Iranian missile strikes on Israeli bases, the potential for Netanyahu to back out of a truce with Hamas, and the Houthi drone strikes on Eilat all point to an increased risk of attacks causing 5+ casualties or a nationwide shelter order before March 1, 2026.

The IDF's caution about a full-scale invasion of Gaza suggests they are wary of the potential for high casualties, which could make them more reluctant to launch such an operation. This would push the probability down from the base rate.

However, the other evidence points to an increased risk of attacks on Israel. The confirmation of Iranian missile strikes, the possibility of continued conflict with Hamas, and the vulnerability demonstrated by the Houthi drone strikes all suggest Israel's defenses could be overwhelmed in a future conflict, pushing the probability up from the base rate.

Overall, the net effect of this evidence is to increase the probability from the base rate of 21.4% to 25.4%. While this is not an extremely high probability, it does represent a significant increase from the starting point, reflecting the increased tensions and risks facing Israel in the coming years.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: IDF fears of high casualties
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 21.4%
- Total adjustment: +4%
- Final estimate: 25.4%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 25.4%**
