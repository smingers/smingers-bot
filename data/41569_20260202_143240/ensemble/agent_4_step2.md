Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality / facts vs opinion – abbreviated)  
   • ChartStorm 1 Feb 2026 – factual y-t-d performance, rotation clues; author is respected technician. Moderate quality, mostly data.  
   • CNBC 1 Feb 2026 – real-time market desk report, quotes earnings, macro news. High factual quality. Opinions confined to quoted strategists.  
   • XTB earnings wrap – FactSet‐style numbers on beat-rates and margins. High factual value on profits; caution that XTB is a broker.  
   • CNN, Yahoo Finance, Tker 2025-26 outlook pieces – compile year-end 2026 targets from major banks. Helpful for sentiment, but all opinion.  
   • AskNews batch – AP, Investing.com etc. provide closing levels (S&P 6939 on 30 Jan 2026) and describe the immediate trigger (Warsh nomination). High factual quality for prices, moderate for causal attributions.  
   Net: prices and earnings data are hard facts (strong evidence); strategist targets and rotation talk are expert opinions (moderate evidence).

2. Evidence weighting  
   Strong (+):  
   • Index is already near 6950; six-week realised σ historically ≈ 5 %.  
   • Q4-2025 earnings beats > 75 %, profit margins at record 13 %, providing tangible support.  
   • Fed funds futures imply no hike before March 13; policy shock risk contained until after that date.  
   Moderate (+):  
   • Consensus year-end targets cluster 7100-7800, indicating bullish bias.  
   Moderate (–):  
   • Valuation rich at 22 × Fwd P/E; past episodes show larger sensitivity to earnings misses.  
   • Warsh nomination injects policy uncertainty; tech led the January pull-back.  
   Weak (±):  
   • Crypto/precious-metal crash and overseas headlines – usually second-order for SPX in a six-week window.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Horizon = 39 calendar / ~29 trading days. One-year σ ≈ 16 % ⇒ horizon σ ≈ 5.4 %. If the question resolved in only 3 weeks I would tighten the distribution by ~√½; if it resolved in 12 weeks I would widen σ by √(12/6) ≈ 1.4.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments  
   Outside-view median = current spot (~6950) with 0.5 % upward drift.  
   • Record earnings momentum and the historical “up January” seasonality tilt the mean slightly higher (+0.5 %).  
   • Policy and valuation risks pull the left tail fatter – I expand the 1 – 20 percentile band a bit more than a log-normal would give.  
   • Expert year-end optimism justifies a mild right-tail skew but not a sharp march-to-new-highs in six weeks.

Probability calibration
I model log-returns with μ = 0.6 % and σ = 5.5 %, then widen tails by 25 % to allow for event risk.  This produces the following rounded percentile grid:

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 6150
Percentile 5: 6350
Percentile 10: 6500
Percentile 20: 6700
Percentile 40: 6950
Percentile 60: 7100
Percentile 80: 7350
Percentile 90: 7550
Percentile 95: 7700
Percentile 99: 8000

Checklist:
1. Target = closing level of the S&P 500 on 13 Mar 2026, index points.  
2. Base-rate median ≈ current level 6950 with 5 % 1σ six-week swing.  
3. Implied median 7000 (between P40 & P60); mean ≈ 7050 – matches drift and skew rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) spot 6939 on 30 Jan; (ii) 75 % EPS beats and record margins; (iii) 22 × forward P/E valuation risk; (iv) Fed on hold until after 13 Mar; (v) Warsh nomination injects uncertainty.  
5. Blind-spot: a shock CPI print on 12 Mar forcing markets to price an emergency hike – would push the close well below my P10.
