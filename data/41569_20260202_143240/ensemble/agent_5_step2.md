Analysis:

1. Source analysis (abridged)  
a. ChartStorm (1 Feb 2026): timely, data-driven technical commentary; factual January performance, opinion “bullish rotation”. Quality: medium.  
b. CNBC live blog (1 Feb 2026): real-time market colour; multiple verifiable facts (prices, earnings calendar). Quality: high for facts, opinions confined to quoted analysts.  
c. XTB earnings wrap (31 Jan 2026): factual earnings beats/margins; valuation numbers from FactSet. Quality: high for data, mild sell-side bias.  
d. CNN/Yahoo/Tker outlook pieces (Dec 2025–Jan 2026): collect year-end-2026 Street targets. Quality: moderate—useful for sentiment, not short-horizon.  
e. Wire reports 30–31 Jan 2026 (AP, Investing, Stockpulse, etc.): objective closing levels. Quality: high.  
f. AskNews aggregated articles 2 Feb 2026: confirm last close 6939, note global risk-off tone, Fed-chair uncertainty. Quality: high on prices, speculative on motives.

2. Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• Six-week realised volatility history (σ ≈ 6.5 %) → base distribution.  
• Index level 6939 on 30 Jan (multiple sources).  
Moderate:  
• 75 % earnings beats, record margins (XTB) → mild upward drift.  
• Futures implied 85 % chance of NO March Fed move → removes extreme downside tail.  
• Street conviction that 2026 EPS growth ≈ 14 % (CNN/Tker) → supportive.  
Weak:  
• January Barometer lore; rotation from crypto; Silver crash contagion → small.

Net evidence tilt: +0.5 % drift vs base, broaden tails very slightly for event risk (Feb CPI, March CPI two days before settle).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 40 calendar ≈ 30 trading days. Halving horizon (15 days) would cut σ to ≈ 4.5 %; doubling (60 days) would raise σ to ≈ 9.0 %. Directional bias unchanged unless an exogenous shock appears.

4. Justification of inside view shift  
Outside-view mean (6950) derived from 0.8 % historical six-week average. I add +0.3 % (≈ 20 points) for strong earnings/likely soft-landing, yielding μ ≈ 6970.  
Volatility: base σ 455 points (6.5 % of 7000); add 50 points for macro data events → σ_eff ≈ 500.  
This produces the percentile ladder below.

Probability calibration

• Distribution assumed normal in log-space centred on 6970, σ(log) ≈ 0.072.  
• Mean ≈ 7005, median ≈ 6970 – consistent with slight positive skew.  
• 90 % CI: 6200-7800 (wide to respect unknowns).

Checklist:
1. Target variable: S&P 500 official close 13 Mar 2026, index points.  
2. Outside-view base mean 6950, σ 455.  
3. Consistency: median 6970; mean 7005; matches upward-skew rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) 6939 last close; b) 6 % six-week σ history; c) record profit margins; d) Fed seen on hold until June; e) tech earnings season still robust.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden geopolitical shock (e.g., Taiwan crisis) could push index below 6000.
