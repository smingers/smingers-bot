Analysis:
The key to judging where the S&P 500 might close on 13 March 2026 is knowing (a) where the index stands today (2 Feb 2026), (b) how traders are currently pricing in the next six-week path for Fed policy, inflation prints and Q1-2026 earnings, and (c) whether the “AI-boom rotation” is continuing or stalling.  Therefore the most useful current information will be:
• Real-time index level data and market commentary from the past few trading sessions.  
• Fresh (late-Jan / early-Feb 2026) strategist targets or revisions for March-quarter levels.  
• News on macro triggers between now and 13 March: CPI on 12 Feb & 11 Mar, the 19 Feb FOMC minutes and the 18 Mar Fed meeting (whose expectations are already being priced).  
• Earnings season take-aways—about 60 % of the S&P reports between now and mid-Feb, so profit-margin guidance can shift sentiment quickly.  
• Sector rotation stories—signs of continued cooling in megacap-AI names or renewed momentum.  

To surface these angles I want one broad Google search for background pieces and data pages, one Google News search restricted to the very latest financial-press articles, and one AskNews query that explicitly requests analyst commentary and outlooks dated in February 2026.
