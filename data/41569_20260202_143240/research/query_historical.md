Analysis:
The March-13-2026 close is only six weeks away, so any forecast should weigh (1) the recent price path of the index, (2) macro-economic releases scheduled before 13 Mar 2026 (Fed meetings, CPI, payrolls, earnings season tail), and (3) the typical short-term volatility of the S&P 500.  
Relevant historical context therefore includes:  
• The distribution of 6-week percentage moves for the S&P 500 when it is near an all-time high (e.g., post-1990 episodes where the index sat ≥98 % of its preceding 52-week high).  
• How the index behaved after previous multi-year AI/tech-led rallies (e.g., 1998-2000 dot-com run-up, 2016-2018 FAANG surge).  
• Market responses in election years immediately after a new administration’s first budget and policy announcements (2001, 2009, 2017).  
• Interest-rate expectations: the FOMC’s 19-Mar-2026 meeting is after the target date, so the market will still be trading on the February minutes and the February CPI (due 11 Mar). Historical data on how CPI surprises within two days of option expiration affect index levels is pertinent.  
• Current valuation metrics versus historical ranges (forward P/E, equity risk premium) to gauge mean-reversion risk within a short horizon.

Collecting this information will allow construction of an outside-view distribution for 6-week returns starting from the present level (~6 900) and thus produce a well-calibrated CDF for 13 Mar 2026.
