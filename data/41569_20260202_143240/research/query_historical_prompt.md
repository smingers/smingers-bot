Forecasting Question:
What will be the closing value of the S&P 500 on March 13, 2026?

Question background:
The [S\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) is a stock market index that tracks the stock prices of 500 companies that are publicly traded in the United States. Its performance is widely followed and often used as a proxy for the overall performance of the U.S. stock market.

From 2023 through 2025, the S\&P 500 [saw significant gains](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-spending-strong-corporate-profits-fed-rate-cuts-seen-key-2026-stock-market-2025-12-24/) as AI-related stocks surged in value. In 2024 alone, the index reached for the first time both [the 5000- and the 6000-point marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_milestones_of_the_S%26P_500#Milestone_highs), and although it [dipped in the first two months of the new administration](https://www.gia.com/march-2025-market-recap/), the index has continued to rise in 2025, closing at an all-time high (as of this writing) of 6,932.05 on December 24, 2025.

[Prognosticators](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/every-major-wall-street-analysts-sp-500-forecast-for-2026) expect the S\&P 500 to continue to grow in 2026, albeit not at the rates seen in any of the previous three years, with "waning enthusiasm for A.I. and a drop in tech valuations" seen as the [top threat](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/dealbook/ai-rally-bubble-2026.html) to the market's continued growth.
