Article on Q4 2025 Earnings Season\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Current Earnings Season Performance (Q4 2025):**\n- Approximately one-third of S&P 500 companies have reported\n- 75% of S&P 500 companies beat EPS forecasts\n- 65% surprised positively on revenue\n- Blended year-over-year earnings growth rate: 11.9%\n- If this pace holds, it would mark a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth\n- On December 31, consensus had implied only 8.3% earnings growth for Q4 (vs. current ~11.9%)\n- Six sectors are tracking stronger earnings outcomes than at year-end\n\n**Profit Margins:**\n- S&P 500 blended net profit margin for Q4 2025: 13.2%\n- This would be the highest net profit margin since FactSet began tracking in 2009\n- Previous record was 13.1%, set in Q3 2025\n- Only five sectors are currently above their five-year average net margins\n\n**Sector-Specific Margin Performance:**\n- Technology and Industrials showing strongest performance\n- Real Estate margins declined to 33.5% from 35.1% (year-over-year)\n- Energy essentially flat at 7.8% year-over-year\n- Industrials expanded sequentially to 12.5% vs. 10.5% (Q4 vs. Q3)\n- Utilities declined sequentially to 12.9% vs. 17.1%\n\n**Valuation Metrics:**\n- S&P 500 forward 12-month P/E: 22.2\n- This is above both the 5-year average and 10-year average (specific numbers not provided)\n\n**Q1 2026 Guidance:**\n- Described as \"steady rather than exuberant\"\n- Characterized as \"constructive, but not euphoric\"\n\n**2026 Outlook:**\n- Consensus expects net profit

daily chart\n- Currently hovering near 6,950\n\n## Key Opinions/Analysis from Source:\n\nThe article (from XTB.com, a trading platform) suggests that:\n- Expectations were set conservatively, while companies showed stronger operational resilience than priced in\n- The narrative that costs are rapidly eroding corporate profitability is being challenged by historic high margins\n- The record margin is driven by a few large, highly profitable segments rather than broad-based improvement\n- The bigger risk for equities isn't the earnings backdrop itself, but that at current valuation levels, investors will demand near-perfect execution\n- Any earnings stumble could carry larger price impact than in a lower-multiple environment\n- If margins continue to deliver on projected trajectory, high valuations may remain defensible\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/01/investing/what-to-expect-stock-market-2026\">\n# Summary of CNN Article: \"What to

Despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, the market failed to consolidate above 2,800, with the benchmark expected to target 3,000 points if positive external signals emerge or if the Central Bank of Russia reduces its key rate by 50 basis points on February 13. Among stocks, Southern Urals Gold outperformed the market with a January gain of +37%, closing above 0.73 rubles after an initial rally exceeding 80% and a peak near 1 ruble.

In contrast, Lukoil underperformed with a -10% decline in January, though adjusted for 6% dividends, the net loss was -4%, still worse than the broader market due to uncertainty over the sale of foreign assets.

The ruble strengthened by +3% against the USD in January, with USD/RUB falling to 75.73\u2014the lowest since March 2023.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plummeted nearly 5%, falling 317.96 points or 4.77% to close at 6,352.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 386 points to 45,752.26, the S&P 500 fell 103.4 points to 6,538.76, and the Nasdaq Composite plunged 486 points or 2.15% to 22,078.05. Despite Nvidia reporting strong Q3 results with 62% year-over-year revenue growth and better-than-expected EPS, the stock ended down 2.97% at $180.98, reversing gains and marking its worst monthly performance since March. Other AI-related stocks also declined sharply: Micron (-10.87%), Marvell (-5.71%), Microsoft (-1.78%), Netflix (-3.94%), and NetApp (-2.85%). Only a few stocks like Ninth City and NetEase rose. The S&P 11 sectors saw only consumer staples marginally positive; technology stocks led losses with a 2.66% drop. Market analysts attributed the sell-off to concerns over AI valuation bubbles, profit-taking, and a shift in sentiment due to the U.S. September nonfarm payroll report showing 119,000 new jobs\u2014well above expectations\u2014while the unemployment rate hit a 4-year high. Federal funds futures indicated a drop in the probability of a December rate cut to below 40%, reducing the likelihood of a rate cut and increasing uncertainty around monetary policy. This heightened fears of an AI bubble. In contrast, Asian markets rallied on Nvidia\u2019s pre-market strength: Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged 1,286 points (2.65%) to 49,823, TOPIX rose 1.66%, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI gained 75.34 points (1.92%) to 4,004.85. Analysts like Rong Yishen of Qifa Investment and KKM Financial noted that the initial optimism from Nvidia\u2019s report was overwhelmed by concerns over rate cuts, market liquidity, and potential AI growth slowdown. The market\u2019s shift in sentiment suggests a broader reassessment of AI stocks\u2019 valuations and future growth prospects. Future market movements will depend on Fed commentary, Taiwan\u2019s stock performance, and semiconductor supply chain dynamics.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:32 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001901x8mw.html)\n\n**S&P 500 Declines Slightly on Friday Amid Mixed Stock Performance**\nOn Friday, January 30, 2026, the S&P 500 declined by 0.42% to close at 6,939.65 points, down from 6,969.01 points on the previous trading day, Thursday, January 29, 2026.

The S&P 500 also fell to 6,939.03, down 29.98 points. The downturn followed a stronger-than-expected December 2025 Producer Price Index (PPI) and the announcement by former President Donald Trump that Kevin Warsh, a known hawkish figure, would become the next Federal Reserve Chair. This shift increased uncertainty around future interest rate cuts, prompting investors to take profits. Sector-wise, telecommunications services rose while semiconductors and related manufacturing declined. SanDisk (SNDK) surged on strong second-quarter results and robust demand for AI data center memory chips. Apple (AAPL) rose despite concerns over memory price increases and supply constraints. Gold miner Newmont (NEM) fell sharply as the dollar strengthened and gold prices dropped, with silver prices plunging over 30% at one point. Silver producers such as Hudbay Minerals (HL), Coeur Mining (CDE), and Pan American Silver (PAAS) saw significant sell-offs. Footwear company Deckers Outdoor (DECK) surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year outlook, driven by strong performance in brands like UGG and HOKA. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated in a CNBC interview that Kevin Warsh is likely to succeed her as Fed Chair upon her term's expiration on March 31, 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:15 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-1404263)\n\n**BC-Select Stock Indices**\nOn Friday, January 30, 2026, at 5:30 PM, U.S. stock indices showed mixed performance.

The decline followed U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that Kevin Warsh would replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. Allan Small, senior investment adviser at iA Private Wealth, attributed the sell-off to Warsh\u2019s perceived hawkish stance, which strengthened the U.S. dollar and pressured gold and other metals. The April gold contract fell US$609.70 to US$4,745.10 per ounce. U.S. markets also declined: the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 179.09 points to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 fell 29.98 points to 6,939.03, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 223.30 points to 23,461.82.

The upcoming 'quadruple witching day' on Friday, December 19, 2025, marked the largest in history, with $7.1 trillion (approximately NT$223.8 trillion) in expiring options contracts\u2014surpassing all prior records. The majority of this, about $5 trillion, was tied to the S&P 500 index, with an additional $880 billion from individual stock options. This volume equates to 10.2% of the Russell 3000 Index\u2019s total market capitalization, significantly impacting market liquidity and short-term price movements. Analysts warn that the massive expiration could trigger heightened volatility due to settlement and hedging activities, or alternatively, create a 'pinning effect' that temporarily suppresses price swings. The S&P 500\u2019s 6,800-point level is identified as a critical technical threshold\u2014its ability to hold this level will determine whether the bullish trend from 2025 continues. Technical analysis from SpotGamma shows the index is within a 'gamma pressure zone' between 6,700 and 6,900 points. A close above 6,800 could signal the start of a 'Santa Claus rally.' SpotGamma recommends long investors consider December 31, 2025, call spreads near 6,900, while short-side investors may opt for put options expiring in February or March 2026 to mitigate time decay during holidays.

The Brazilian real initially performed poorly, registering its worst morning performance among the world\u2019s 33 strongest currencies, amid speculation about Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s political candidacy. Later, as the 'price' of his candidacy was assessed through 'dosimetry,' the U.S. dollar slowed its rise to 0.26%, trading at R$5.4349, fueled by hopes of reduced fragmentation on the right-wing political front. On Friday (12), U.S. futures markets showed mixed performance after investor rotation from technology stocks into value and cyclical stocks pushed the Dow Jones and S&P 500 to new record highs. Following the initial market reaction to the FOMC and COPOM meetings on Super Wednesday, market participants are awaiting new commentary. The COPOM\u2019s more hawkish tone has raised concerns: will interest rate cuts occur in January 2026 or only in March? Economic indicators such as retail sales and GDP show weakening momentum, and real interest rates are becoming excessive, already affecting default rates. Many market participants believe there is room for a rate cut next month. Meanwhile, in Congress, tensions between the Executive and the Supreme Federal Court (STF), along with the Legislative branch\u2019s weak institutional standing, have caused discomfort. Internationally, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s room for maneuver is shrinking, especially after Maria Corina\u2019s visit to Oslo and her Nobel Prize recognition, signaling that his time may be nearing an end.

This pullback follows President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as next Federal Reserve Chair (effective May 2026), which triggered safe-hasset sell-offs and equity volatility [1][3][7][9]. Despite this, the index remains **up ~1% YTD** and near all-time highs, supported by robust earnings expectations [3][6][13].\n\n#### Federal Reserve Impact\n- **March Meeting**: Markets price in an **85.1% chance of no rate change** in March, maintaining the current 3.5%-3.75% range [1][4]. Two Fed governors recently dissented favoring a cut, reflecting internal policy divergence [11].\n- **Warsh Uncertainty**: Historically hawkish but recently dovish, Warsh's nomination sparks concerns about Fed independence amid Trump's public pressure for rate cuts [2][9][19]. Markets will scrutinize his Congressional testimony for policy clues.\n- **Key Data Watch**: The February 6 jobs report (forecast: +64K payrolls) and January inflation data could shift rate expectations. Weak labor data might accelerate cuts; strength could delay easing until June [4][6][10].\n\n#### Earnings Influence\n- **2026 Growth**: Analysts project **15% earnings growth** for S&P 500 companies [4][6][13][15], with tech sector profits expected to surge 27% [13].\n- **Q4 2025 Performance**: 76.5% of early reporters beat expectations, but reactions were uneven. Microsoft's cloud disappointment weighed on markets, while Meta's strength provided support [4][6][16].\n- **Tech Catalyst**: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia's upcoming reports (late Jan-early Feb) are critical for sustaining the AI-driven rally. Capital expenditure guidance on AI infrastructure will be closely watched [3][6][13][20].\n- **Valuation Risk**: Trading at 22x forward earnings, high concentration in tech megacaps makes the market vulnerable to earnings misses [8][15][19].\n\n#### March Projections & Catalysts\n- **Bull Case (7,100-7,200)**: Requires:  \n  \u2713 Strong tech earnings with robust AI spending outlook [6][13]  \n  \u2713 Reassuring Fed messaging on policy continuity [4][11]  \n  \u2713 Geopolitical de-escalation (e.g., U.S.-Iran tensions) [14][17]  \n- **Bear Case (6,700-6,800)**: Risks include:  \n  \u2717 Earnings misses from key AI players [4][16]  \n  \u2717 Warsh nomination fueling policy uncertainty [2][7][10]  \n  \u2717 Inflation rebound delaying rate cuts [5][17]  \n- **Base Case**: Choppy consolidation near 7,000, with **5-8% upside potential by March-end** if earnings momentum holds and Fed fears ease [11][15][19]. Technical support sits at 6,800 [7].\n\n#### Analyst Consensus\n- **Kalshi Prediction Market**: 19% probability of S&P 500 reaching 7,600-7,800 by December 2026 [12][15].  \n- **Goldman Sachs**: Projects high-teens percentage gains for 2026, citing earnings growth and AI tailwinds [15].  \n- **Cautionary Views**: Mohamed El-Erian warns of a \"tense tug-of-war\" between economic scenarios, noting K-shaped recovery and labor market stagnation risks [1][5].\n\n**Summary**  \nThe February-March outlook hinges on three pillars:  \n1. **Tech Earnings**: AI spending commitments must validate 2026 growth projections [6][13][20].  \n2. **Fed Credibility**: Warsh's testimony must reassure markets of policy independence [2][9][10].  \n3. **Data Resilience**: Jobs/inflation reports must align with soft-landing expectations [4][17].  \n\nWhile near-term volatility is likely, **analysts broadly retain positive 2026 targets** (7,500-8,100) assuming earnings growth materializes and Fed transitions smoothly [11][12][15]. Markets will remain reactive to geopolitical shocks and political pressure on the Fed [5][14][19].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
