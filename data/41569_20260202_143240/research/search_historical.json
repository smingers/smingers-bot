boom in AI-related capital expenditures; larger shareholder payments; fiscal stimulus from President Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\"\n\n**HSBC**\n- Target: 7,500\n- Upside: +9%\n- Key reasoning: AI trade expanding beyond hyperscalers; earnings growth slowing for Magnificent Seven while picking up in rest of S&P 500 (broadening rally); solid US economic growth should help cyclical stocks outperform\n\n**RBC**\n- Target: 7,750\n- Upside: +12%\n- Key reasoning: Models based on sentiment, valuations, economic and monetary policies; investor sentiment showing \"contrarian buy signal\" for long-term investors; solid earnings growth and expected Fed rate cuts, though subdued economic growth could drag on returns\n\n**Morgan Stanley**\n- Target: 7,800\n- Upside: +13%\n- Key reasoning: Strong corporate earnings and \"rolling recovery\" in economy expected to pick up steam; bank believes US is in midst of new bull market and earnings cycle\n- Quote: \"We believe that we're in the midst of a new bull market and earnings cycle, especially for many of the lagging areas of the index\"\n\n**Deutsche Bank**\n- Target: 8,000\n- Upside: +16%\n- Key reasoning: Earnings growth expected to accelerate to around 14%; valuations supported by higher payout ratios, fewer large earnings declines, and inflation remaining below long-term average\n- Quote: \"Our demand-supply framework suggests mid-teens returns on the back of positioning rising from neutral, a continued cross-asset inflows boom benefiting equities, and buybacks rising in line with earnings\"\n\n**Common themes across forecasts:**\n- Earnings growth (13%-15% range commonly cited)\n- Fed rate cuts expected\n- Continued US economic growth\n- AI investments continuing to expand\n- All forecasts are bullish, ranging from +3% to +16% upside\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tker.co/p/wall-street-2026-stock-market-outlook\">\n# Summary of Wall Street's 2026 Outlook for Stocks\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Year-End S&P 500 Targets for 2026:**\nWall Street strategists have year-end S&P 500 targets ranging from **7,100 to 8,000**, implying returns between **3.3% and 16.4%** from the December 5 close.\n\n**Individual Firm Targets (with EPS estimates where provided):**\n- Bank of America: 7,100 (EPS: $310) - implies ~5% price return\n- Societe Generale: 7,300 (EPS: $310)\n- Barclays: 7,400 (EPS: $305)\n- CFRA: 7,400\n- UBS: 7,500 (EPS: $309)\n- JPMorgan: 7,500 (EPS: $315)\n- Goldman Sachs: 7,600 (EPS: $305) - assumes 12% EPS growth with 7% revenue growth\n- KKR: 7,600 (EPS: $303)\n- Yardeni: 7,700 (EPS: $310)\n- Fundstrat: 7,700 (EPS: $307)\n- RBC: 7,750 (EPS: $311)\n\n**Consensus Earnings Growth:** The consensus calls for **14% earnings growth in 2026**.\n\n**Historical Context:** The standard deviation around the mean annual total return for the S&P 500 is nearly **20 percentage points** (cited from Data Trek's Nick Colas).\n\n**Midterm Election Year Statistics:** According to CFRA's Sam Stovall, since 1946:\n- Average intra-year drawdown for midterm election years: **18%** (highest of all four years of presidential cycle)\n- Average annual price gain: **3.8%** (weakest of presidential cycle)\n- Frequency of price advance: **55%** (versus 76% for other three years)\n\n## Key Drivers and Opinions from Named Sources:\n\n**Economic Tailwinds:**\n- Fiscal stimulus from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act expected to add **0.9% to GDP**\n- Easier monetary policy as Federal Reserve continues rate cuts\n- More friendly trade policy than 2025\n- Increased AI capex spending\n\n**Economic Challenges:**\n- Inflation expected to remain above Fed's **2% target rate**\n- Labor markets expected to remain cool as companies use AI for complex tasks\n\n**Valuation Concerns:**\n- More conservative strategists expect P/E ratio contraction from elevated levels\n- Current earnings expectations and valuations are \"among the highest in four decades\" (UBS)\n- KKR assumes equity multiples remain in **22-23x forward earnings range**, not underwriting further multiple expansion\n\n**Specific Firm Views:**\n\n- **Goldman Sachs:** Forecast combines 7% revenue growth with **70 basis points of profit margin expansion**\n\n- **UBS:** Expects market consolidation first with speed bump in early 2026 due to tariffs, then broadening rally into lower-quality cyclicals from late Q1. Nearly half of earnings growth expected from Tech sector.\n\n- **JPMorgan:** Views current elevated multiples as correctly anticipating above-trend earnings growth, AI capex boom, rising shareholder payouts, and easier fiscal/monetary policies.\n\n- **Yardeni:** Expects 2026 to be \"just another year of the Roaring 2020s\"\n\n## General Commentary:\n\nThe article author (Sam Ro, CFA) cautions against putting too much weight into one-year targets, noting it's \"extremely difficult to predict short-term moves in the market with any accuracy.\"\n\n**Summary view:** Expanding profit margins expected to turn modest revenue growth into double-digit earnings growth, driving stock prices higher. The magnitude of gains will depend on whether valuations stay high.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-soar-again-2026-083000263.html\">\n# Summary of \"Will the Stock Market Soar Again in 2026? Wall Street Has a Clear Answer for Investors.\"\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Finance (The Motley Fool)  \n**Date:** January 6, 2026  \n**Author:** Trevor Jennewine\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Recent Performance:** The S&P 500 has advanced 92% since the current bull market began in October 2022, with double-digit returns in each of the past three years.\n\n2. **Current Valuation:** The S&P 500 currently trades at 22.2 times forward earnings. This expensive valuation has only been seen during two other historical periods (excluding the current situation): the dot-com bubble and the Covid-19 pandemic. Both previous instances ended in sharp declines.\n\n3. **Current Level:** The article references the S&P 500's current level as 6,858 (as of the article's writing date).\n\n## Three Major Headwinds Identified:\n\n1. **Midterm Election Year Effect:** During midterm election years, the S&P 500 has historically suffered an average peak-to-trough decline of 18%. This is attributed to policy uncertainty as the party holding the presidency typically loses Congressional seats.\n\n2. **Economic Challenges Related to Tariffs:** \n   - Unemployment recently hit a four-year high\n   - Jobs growth has dropped to its slowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the pandemic)\n   - The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index recorded its lowest annual average in history in 2025 (data goes back to 1952)\n\n3. **High Valuation:** As noted above, the 22.2x forward earnings multiple is historically elevated.\n\n## Wall Street Forecasts:\n\nThe article presents year-end 2026 targets from 19 Wall Street investment banks and research organizations:\n\n- **Highest forecast:** Oppenheimer at 8,100 (18% upside)\n- **Lowest forecast:** Bank of America at 7,100 (4% upside)\n- **Median forecast:** 7,600 (11% upside from the 6,858 level)\n\nAll 19 firms surveyed predict positive returns for 2026, despite the identified headwinds. The median forecast of 7,600 represents 11% upside from the index's level at the time of writing.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve S&P 500 daily closes 2022-2026 and major bank forecasts for 2026 levels, emphasize post-CPI reactions\nThe original brief asked for three distinct items:\n\nA.
