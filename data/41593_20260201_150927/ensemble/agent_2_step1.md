**LessWrong (Jan 29, 2026):**
- Most recent detailed update
- **Key Facts:** Claude at 230,000 steps in Victory Road, stuck on boulder puzzles
- Author opinion: "expects Claude would beat the game given unlimited time" - reasonable extrapolation but speculative
- High quality technical analysis from AI safety community

**TIME Magazine (Jan 13, 2026):**
- **Key Facts:** Claude Opus 4.5 at 170,000 steps in Victory Road; has been playing 500+ hours
- **Expert Opinion (Joel Zhang):** Challenge is "long-term planning capacity"
- **Expert Opinion (Peter Whidden):** "AI knows everything about Pokémon...but bumbles the execution"
- **Comparison:** Gemini 3 Pro has completed both Blue and Crystal; Gemini achieved first completion in May 2025

**Tom's Hardware (Jan 24, 2026):**
- **Key Facts:** Gemini and GPT have already beaten Pokémon Blue; Claude has not
- **Expert Opinion (David Hershey, Anthropic AI lead):** Pokémon is "pretty hard problem" and provides "quantitative way" to evaluate models
- Confirms competitive context but less detail on current status

**Jurgen Gravestein Substack (date unclear, but references recent events):**
- **Key Facts:** Brock took ~20 hours; stuck in Mt. Moon for 18+ hours; "furthest we've seen Claude get is past Lt. Surge's Gym" (channel description)
- Author opinion: Claude is "slow, terribly slow"
- This appears to be from earlier in the run (possibly Sonnet 3.7 era) based on progress described

**The Verge (Feb 25, 2025):**
- Historical snapshot from launch day
- Claude hunting Mankey outside Viridian City with Sonnet 3.7
- Useful for establishing timeline but outdated for current prediction

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Claude's own progression rate (Opus 4.5 era):**
   - Late Nov 2025 to Jan 29, 2026 (~2 months): Went from restart to Victory Road (8 badges)
   - Stuck in Victory Road for at least 16 days (Jan 13-29) with 60,000 step increase
   - Suitability: HIGH - most direct predictor of future performance

2. **Competitor AI completion times:**
   - Gemini: First completion ~May 2025 (timeline from launch unclear)
   - GPT: Completed before Jan 2026
   - Gemini 3 Pro: Completed both Blue and Crystal
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - different harnesses and capabilities make direct comparison difficult

3. **Human baseline:**
   - Children complete in 20-40 hours
   - Claude at 500+ hours (as of Jan 13) with ~170,000 steps
   - Suitability: LOW - fundamentally different cognitive architecture

4. **Claude's historical stall patterns:**
   - Mt. Moon: 18+ hours stuck
   - Silph Co: Extended period (48,000 steps mentioned)
   - Pokemon Mansion: Days stuck, then completed
   - Victory Road: 16+ days and counting
   - Suitability: HIGH - demonstrates both persistence and eventual breakthrough pattern

**Selected Reference Class:** Claude's Opus 4.5 progression rate combined with historical stall-then-breakthrough patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** Feb 1, 2026 to Oct 1, 2026 (242 days)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From late Nov 2025 to Jan 29, 2026 (~60 days):
- Completed 8 gyms
- Reached Victory Road
- Average: ~1 major milestone per week during productive periods
- But: Experienced multi-day/week stalls

Victory Road stall (Jan 13-29+):
- 16+ days with no escape from boulder puzzles
- Step count increased 60,000 (170k → 230k) but no progress
- Pattern suggests this could extend weeks or months

**Critical Remaining Challenges:**
1. Complete Victory Road boulder puzzles (current blocker)
2. Navigate remaining Victory Road sections
3. Defeat Elite Four (4 consecutive battles)
4. Defeat Champion Blue (final battle)

**Historical Breakthrough Pattern:**
- Author notes viewers "routinely wrote off the run as doomed" but Claude "eventually found solutions"
- Previous seemingly impossible obstacles (Safari Zone backtrack, Pokemon Mansion) were overcome
- Suggests eventual completion is likely, but timeline highly uncertain

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Claude's Performance:**

Given Opus 4.5's demonstrated capabilities:
- Successfully completed 8 badges in ~60 days of active running
- Shows ability to recover from planning failures (Gold Teeth retrieval)
- Persistence without giving up

**Key Uncertainties:**

1. **Victory Road Duration:** Currently 16+ days stuck. Historical stalls have lasted weeks but eventually resolved. Boulder puzzles are deterministic and solvable, but require precise execution Claude struggles with.

2. **Elite Four Challenge:** Requires 5 consecutive difficult battles without the ability to extensively grind between them. No AI has demonstrated this on the minimal-harness Claude setup. This could be a significantly harder barrier than any gym.

3. **Model Updates:** Article mentions anticipation of new Claude model release. If a new model launches and resets the run, timeline extends significantly.

4. **Exponential Tail Risk:** The longer Claude is stuck, the more likely intervention or project abandonment becomes.

**Integration:**

Most likely scenario: Claude escapes Victory Road within 2-8 weeks (early-mid March), then faces Elite Four. Elite Four could take anywhere from days to months depending on battle execution quality. 

Median completion: Late March to May 2026 (60-120 days from Feb 1)

However, significant tail risk exists:
- Could remain stuck in Victory Road for months
- Elite Four could prove insurmountable without harness improvements
- Project could be reset with new model
- Could achieve breakthrough and complete rapidly

The question resolves Oct 1, 2026 if not completed, giving 242 days total window.

## Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring Considerations:**

1. **Optimistic Scenario (10th percentile):** Claude has breakthrough on boulder puzzles within days, navigates remaining Victory Road in 1-2 weeks, and defeats Elite Four with moderate grinding. Completion: Late February to early March (~25-40 days from Feb 1)

2. **Moderate Scenario (50th percentile):** Victory Road escape takes 3-6 weeks, Elite Four requires significant attempts and strategy refinement. Completion: Late March to early May (~60-100 days from Feb 1)

3. **Pessimistic Scenario (90th percentile):** Extended Victory Road stall (2-3 months), Elite Four proves extremely difficult requiring multiple strategy overhauls or minor harness adjustments. Completion: June to August (~120-180 days from Feb 1)

4. **Tail Risk Beyond 90th:** Project reset, insurmountable Elite Four difficulty, or abandonment means completion after Oct 1 or never within 2026.

**Distribution Shape:**
- Right-skewed: More probability mass in earlier dates with long tail
- Victory Road is solvable (deterministic puzzle), so complete failure unlikely
- Elite Four introduces new uncertainty but Opus 4.5 has shown battle competence

**Calibration Adjustments:**
- 10th percentile: Should reflect realistic "everything goes well" scenario - ~30 days
- 20th percentile: Minor delays resolved quickly - ~45 days  
- 40th percentile: Moderate Victory Road delay, smooth Elite Four - ~70 days
- 60th percentile: Extended Victory Road, challenging Elite Four - ~95 days
- 80th percentile: Major stalls but eventual completion - ~140 days
- 90th percentile: Near-worst case while still completing - ~180 days
