Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)  
1. LessWrong follow-up (2026-01-29) – Enthusiast observer with screenshots/logs.  Factual: Claude is in Victory Road at 230 000 steps, all eight badges, struggling with boulder puzzles; earlier recovered STRENGTH.  Opinion: will beat “given unlimited time”, likely reset on new model.  Quality: good for precise run state, medium overall.  
2. Tom’s Hardware & iPhone-in-Canada twin articles (2026-01-24) – Mainstream tech press, direct quotes from Anthropic’s David Hershey.  Factual: Opus 4.5 stream ongoing; no Claude victory yet; GPT/Gemini have finished.  Quality: moderate-high.  
3. TIME magazine feature (2026-01-13) – National publication, staff reporting.  Factual: Opus 4.5 still fails frequently (e.g. four-day gym loop); ~170 000 steps; vision weakness.  Opinion: Pokémon exposes real-world reasoning limits.  Quality: high for general patterns.  
4. 2025 coverage (Ars, Futurism, Verge etc.) – Earlier snapshots confirming very slow but persistent progress; useful for historical pace.  Quality: high but older.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent 2026 sources concur: Claude has reached Victory Road but NOT yet finished.  
• Historical pattern inside this very run: every major dungeon stall lasted days-to-weeks but was eventually solved.  

Moderate evidence  
• Statements from Anthropic staff: next Claude model release “will reset” run (could delay finish).  
• Other labs’ AIs have already beaten the game (demonstrates feasibility).  

Weak evidence  
• Rumour-mill timing of Opus 5 release.  
• Speculation that vision fix will arrive “soon”.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window remaining: 242 days (to 2026-10-01).  
If that window were halved (121 d), I would shift the median earlier to late April and compress the right tail; if doubled, I would push the 80th-90th percentiles into 2027 because resets and stalls accumulate.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: Claude’s mean time per late-game obstacle ≈ 20–40 days.  Two major hurdles remain:  
1. Finish Victory Road puzzle & exit.  
2. Defeat Elite Four + Champion (may need grinding and multiple wipes).  
Adding generous buffers and a 25 % chance of a full run reset gives a nominal mean of ~135 days from today.  Heavy-tailed delays (loops or reset after E4 wipe) justify a fat right tail; conversely, there’s a non-trivial 10 % chance Claude clears the puzzle quickly and steamrolls the league within a month.  

Probability calibration
Mean ≈ 2026-06-15; median 2026-05-30; 10-90 interval late Feb – late Sep.  Tail beyond 2026-10-01 censored by platform but acknowledged.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: calendar date Claude first defeats Champion, measured 2026-01-18–2026-10-01.  
2. Base rate: prior late-game obstacle clearance ~30 days each.  
3. Consistency check – median 2026-05-30; mean 2026-06-15; matches narrative of “likely mid-year but could drift”.  
4. Key evidence: a) Verified Victory Road status; b) Historical multi-week stalls; c) Possible upcoming model reset; d) Feasibility shown by other AIs.  
5. Blind-spot: Anthropic silently gives Claude explicit map/vision upgrade tomorrow → pushes finish much earlier.
