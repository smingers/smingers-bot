Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. J. Gravestein Substack (19 Jan 2026).  First-hand narrative, screenshots, ~2 000 viewers; confirms Claude 3.7 Sonnet took ≈20 h to beat Brock and was still in Mt Moon.  Good chronology up to Nov 2025, but no data later than the model switch.  
2. Tom’s Hardware (24 Jan 2026).  Reputable tech outlet, staff-written.  Factual claim that, as of 24 Jan, no Claude run had finished while Gemini and GPT already had.  Useful as a cross-check.  
3. LessWrong follow-up (29 Jan 2026).  Detailed, well-sourced write-up by a known community member; gives a blow-by-blow of the Opus 4.5 run to 230 000 steps and states Claude is stuck in Victory Road.  Highest-quality, most recent factual status.  
4. TIME magazine feature (13 Jan 2026).  Professional journalism; confirms Opus 4.5 in Victory Road at 170 000 steps.  
5. The Verge (25 Feb 2025).  Old snapshot (Claude still outside Viridian).  Merely historical.  
6. Agent report (compiled 1 Feb 2026).  Synthesises all of the above plus HN / subreddit logs; no contradictory evidence.  Gives a coherent timeline that Claude has not yet faced the Elite Four.  Cross-reference shows internal consistency.

Across sources there is a clear factual core: Opus 4.5 has every badge but is still solving Victory Road as of 29 Jan 2026; nothing later contradicts this.  Opinions (e.g., “Claude is slow”, “persistence does wonders”) are noted but not relied on for dating.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. “Claude Plays Pokémon” itself: prior Sonnet run lasted ~10 months and never cleared 4 badges.  Opus 4.5 went from New Game to Victory Road in ≈9 weeks (late Nov → late Jan).  
2. Parallel LLM projects (Gemini, GPT).  These finished in 4–8 weeks with more scaffolded harnesses.  
3. Human speed-runs / casual players (20–40 h)—orders of magnitude faster; poor fit because humans have rich perception & memory.  

Best reference class: “Large-language-model agent with minimal harness playing first-generation Pokémon”.  Only two datapoints (Claude Sonnet and Claude Opus 4.5).  Opus 4.5 is ~10× faster than Sonnet; the improvement arc argues for eventual success, but timing uncertainty is large.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → question close (1 Feb → 1 Oct 2026) = 243 days (≈8 months).  
• Progress so far: badges 1–8 achieved in ~60 days.  Remaining tasks:  
  – Finish Victory Road puzzle (best-case a few hours, worst-case weeks).  
  – Defeat Elite Four + Champion (may require grinding or revives; potential loops/soft-locks).  
  – Risk of hard reset if Anthropic swaps in a new model; this could shorten (faster run) or lengthen (fresh start) the calendar time.  

Historical pattern: the run spends long plateaus (Mt Moon 18 h, Safari mis-step several days).  Expect at least one additional multiday plateau between now and the Champion.

(d) Justification for outside-view distribution  
Base rate: 2-month pace so far → naive extrapolation would beat the game in February.  Adjustments:  
• Sticky tail risk: fresh bugs, model reset, or derailment could add many weeks.  
• 20 % chance Claude is still not Champion by 1 Oct 2026; 10 % chance the run drags on beyond December.  
• Expert chatter (LessWrong, Anthropic dev) shows confidence but no hard deadline; markets (Manifold) last priced “Claude beats game by July” at roughly 55 % (anecdotal).  

Balancing a fast-finish median against a fat right tail leads to a distribution centred in late May/early June with sizable probability mass into September and a small but real mass beyond the resolution date.

Outside view calibration:

• 90 % confidence window spans seven months (3 Mar → 1 Dec 2026).  
• Median (50 th percentile) is deliberately placed between the 40 % and 60 % control points (around early June).  
• 20 % cumulative probability of “not by close” is reflected by pushing the 80 th percentile close to the official resolution date and the 90 th percentile into the post-resolution tail.  
• Distribution checked for monotonicity and plausible month-to-month deltas (no sudden jumps >70 days between adjacent percentiles).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2026-03-01  
Percentile 20: 2026-04-05  
Percentile 40: 2026-05-25  
Percentile 60: 2026-07-10  
Percentile 80: 2026-09-15  
Percentile 90: 2026-12-01
