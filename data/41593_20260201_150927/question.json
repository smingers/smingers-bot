    "description": "Games have been a benchmark for computers and artificial intelligence for decades but there's been [an acceleration in the games that machine learning succeeding in beating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning_in_video_games \"an acceleration in the games that machine learning succeeding in beating\"). Models like [OpenAI Five]() have brought to light the possibility that human players may soon be unable to beat AIs in any game setting.\n\nRecent advances in AI have also allowed general purpose models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude to perform complex reasoning tasks, including long term thinking and strategic decision-making. The first generation of Pok\u00e9mon games are often used as benchmarks to compare the capability of many systems as it presents unique reasoning and agency challenges due to its combination of menu-based combat, short and long-term intersecting gameplay loops and in-game randomness.\n\nInspired by the famous [Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon), [Claude Plays Pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon \"Claude Plays Pokemon\") is an AI experiment with the Claude LLM to try and beat the first generation of Pok\u00e9mon games.\n\nIn 2025, Claude made a lot of progress and went from being infinitely stuck in Mt Moon to being close to finishing the game. [This previous question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/35956/when-will-claude-plays-pokemon-beat-the-first-pokemon-game/#comment-622377) was asking whether this would happen in 2025 and includes relevant information.",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as the date on which [Claude Plays Pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon) successfully completes a full playthrough of the Pok\u00e9mon game it plays on stream by reaching and defeating the Champion (Blue) at the Pok\u00e9mon League.\n\nThe resolution will be based on direct confirmation from the Twitch stream, the organizer of the experiment, or credible sources.",
    "fine_print": "* \"Finishing\" the game is defined for the purposes of this question as reaching the end of the main story (defeating the Elite Four and Champion), not completing the Pok\u00e9dex or any post-game content.\n* The current game played is a modded version of Pok\u00e9mon Red. Further modifications to the game are irrelevant as long as the organizer maintains the same stream, and that the base game is still one of the first generation of Pok\u00e9mon games or their remakes (as of early 2025, these are Blue, Red, Yellow, LeafGreen, FireRed).\n* The AI does not have to be the current version of Claude, any AI by Anthropic would qualify.&#x20;\n* The Claude Plays Pokemon Twitch stream is the only experience that matters for resolution, if Anthropic or any other actor announces that Claude has been able to beat a Pok\u00e9mon game, this will not resolve the question.",
