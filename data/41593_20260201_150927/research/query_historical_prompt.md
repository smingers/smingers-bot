Models like [OpenAI Five]() have brought to light the possibility that human players may soon be unable to beat AIs in any game setting.

Recent advances in AI have also allowed general purpose models like Anthropic’s Claude to perform complex reasoning tasks, including long term thinking and strategic decision-making. The first generation of Pokémon games are often used as benchmarks to compare the capability of many systems as it presents unique reasoning and agency challenges due to its combination of menu-based combat, short and long-term intersecting gameplay loops and in-game randomness.
