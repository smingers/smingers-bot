(2026)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**From 1996 to 2026: How the World and Pok\u00e9mon Have Changed in 30 Years**\nFrom 1996 to 2026, Pok\u00e9mon has evolved dramatically alongside technological and societal changes. Initially released on handheld consoles with monochrome screens, the franchise transitioned to high-definition open worlds, reflecting shifts from analog to digital culture. In 1996, internet access in Spain was minimal (320,000 users), and Pok\u00e9mon games were not globally available\u2014Spain received Blue and Blastoise instead of Green and Venusaur. The anime, featuring Ash and Pikachu, was a central entertainment hub, with viewers relying on friends or reruns to catch missed episodes. The original Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green introduced revolutionary mechanics like trading between versions and a 151-creature Pok\u00e9dex, sparking a global phenomenon. By 1999, internet culture began shaping society, with IRC and ICQ dominating communication and 56k modems defining connectivity. The rise of Game Boy Color and the success of Gold and Silver marked a leap in gameplay with features like real-time progression and a second region. In 2002, post-9/11 global anxiety influenced media, with fantasy franchises like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter offering escapism. The launch of Nintendo DS and Wii in 2006 ushered in a new era of accessible, intuitive gaming, enabling Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl to introduce Wi-Fi connectivity and the Global Trade Station, transforming Pok\u00e9mon into a global, real-time social experience. By 2010, smartphones and social media reshaped attention spans, leading to the rise of mobile gaming and the decline of handhelds. Pok\u00e9mon Black and White embraced DS\u2019s capabilities with a new region, a darker narrative, and a fully original Pok\u00e9dex. In 2013, Pok\u00e9mon X and Y made a landmark leap to 3D, introduced Mega Evolution, and launched simultaneously worldwide\u2014reflecting a hyperconnected era. The 2016 release of Pok\u00e9mon GO redefined the franchise, turning it into a global augmented reality phenomenon. Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon introduced Alola, a Hawaiian-inspired region with unique mechanics like Island Challenges and regional forms. The 2019 release of Sword and Shield brought the first true open world with the Wild Area and Dynamax battles, though it sparked backlash over the loss of the National Pok\u00e9dex and the controversial 'Dexit' decision. In 2022, Scarlet and Violet broke from tradition with Paldea, the first open-world Pok\u00e9mon region, offering unprecedented freedom of exploration. However, the games were plagued by technical issues, including bugs, glitches, and performance problems, sparking criticism despite record sales. Over 30 years, Pok\u00e9mon has mirrored societal evolution\u2014from analog to digital, from linear gameplay to open worlds\u2014while maintaining its core appeal: a reliable refuge in a changing world. The franchise continues to balance innovation with nostalgia, aiming to remain relevant across generations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:39 AM\nSource:[as](https://as.com/meristation/reportajes/de-1996-a-2026-como-ha-cambiado-el-mundo-en-30-anos-de-pokemon-f202602-n/)\n\n**Pok\u00e9mon GCC: What Are the Card Sets Coming in 2026?**\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game (GCC) is set for another significant year in 2026, following a rich 2025.

Though Game Freak is closely associated with Pok\u00e9mon, it is not owned by Nintendo, allowing it to develop titles with other publishers. The game, set to release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S later in 2026, marks Game Freak's first major console title outside the Pok\u00e9mon series. It features a realistic 3D world, a darker narrative, and a protagonist who forms a deep bond with a canine companion, departing from Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s signature cartoon aesthetic. The article notes that many Pok\u00e9mon fans have grown dissatisfied with the franchise\u2019s recent graphical style, particularly the flat, unrealistic visuals in games like Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet, and the lack of innovation in gameplay. While the author expresses love for Pok\u00e9mon and anticipation for the next main series entry, they admit to feeling a sense of fatigue with the repetitive 'catch 'em all' loop. The article highlights that 'Beast of Reincarnation' offers a chance to see Game Freak\u2019s creative potential beyond Pok\u00e9mon, combining the studio\u2019s strengths in storytelling and character-driven RPGs with a more mature, visually ambitious design. The game\u2019s reveal has generated excitement for its narrative depth, realistic visuals, and departure from the Pok\u00e9mon formula.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Comicbook](https://comicbook.com/gaming/feature/i-love-pokemon-but-im-excited-to-see-a-new-side-of-game-freak-with-beast-of-reincarnation/)\n\n**Chatbots go to space: NASA used Claude AI to navigate its Perseverance rover across Mars - The Times of India**\nNASA's Perseverance rover traversed 400 meters across Mars on December 8 and 10, 2025, following a route autonomously planned by Anthropic's Claude AI\u2014the first time a chatbot has directed machinery on another planet. Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provided Claude with years of rover data and orbital imagery from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The AI generated commands in Rover Markup Language (a specialized XML-based code), breaking the route into 10-meter segments and self-critiquing waypoints to refine the path. JPL tested the route using Perseverance\u2019s digital twin, simulating over 500,000 variables; one issue was identified\u2014sand ripples near a narrow corridor not visible in the AI\u2019s initial analysis\u2014prompting a manual adjustment. The remaining path held up under testing. The innovation cuts planning time in half, according to JPL estimates, enabling more drives, more rock sample collection, and enhanced scientific exploration in Jezero Crater\u2014a site once holding water and potentially habitable for microbial life. This is critical given the 20-minute Earth-Mars signal delay, which makes real-time remote driving impossible, and NASA\u2019s workforce reduction of approximately 4,000 employees due to budget cuts. The development marks a significant leap for Anthropic, whose AI previously could not beat Pok\u00e9mon Red. The timing is strategic as NASA prepares for the Artemis moon missions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:34 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatbots-go-to-space-nasa-used-claude-ai-to-navigate-its-perseverance-rover-across-mars/articleshow/127825118.cms)\n\n**When & What to Expect From Pokemon Day 2026**\nPokemon Day 2026, celebrated on February 27, marks the 30th anniversary of the original Pokemon Red and Green release in Japan, and is expected to be the most significant celebration yet. The event will center around a global Pokemon Presents livestream, likely airing in the early afternoon Central European Time (very early morning EST, earlier on the West Coast), lasting 15\u201330 minutes and featuring major announcements. Key highlights include the official reveal of Pokemon Generation 10, expected to be announced during the final segment of the presentation with a likely 2026 holiday release to commemorate the anniversary. The event will also feature a confirmed release date or blockbuster trailer for Pokemon Champions, a cross-platform strategic battle game slated for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, supporting multiplayer, cross-play, and integration with Pokemon Home. Pokemon Pokopia, a sandbox-style game akin to Stardew Valley, is set for an early March 2026 launch on Nintendo Switch 2 and may receive a gameplay trailer during the broadcast. Mobile and franchise-wide updates are anticipated, including new Pokemon TCG Pocket expansions, in-game bonuses for Scarlet and Violet, and special events across Pokemon Go and Unite. LEGO Pokemon sets, including the first-ever LEGO Pokemon collection featuring Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise, will launch on February 27, 2026, and may be spotlighted during the event. The 30th anniversary celebration could also include exclusive merchandise, nostalgia-driven content such as the classic Pikachu design, and potential remasters of classic Pokemon games.

Despite this, the author demonstrates that it is possible to succeed and enjoy ranked battles without using any Legendary or Mythical Pokemon. The recommended team includes Overqwil (Dark/Poison) with Shuca Berry and a set to counter Xerneas, Rotom (Mow Form, Electric/Grass) with Magnet and a size XS form for stealth, and Swampert with Assault Vest to resist special attacks. This team has achieved consistent results\u2014landing last place only once in over 40 matches\u2014primarily due to Rotom's high effectiveness as a sniper. Alternative options like Gholdengo with Nasty Plot and Shadow Ball are also suggested. The author acknowledges the appeal of using Legendaries but emphasizes that a non-Legendary team can still be both competitive and enjoyable, promoting meta diversity. The game was released on October 16, 2025, and received a critic score of 79/100 on OpenCritic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:01 AM\nSource:[Game Rant](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-za-season-6-xernes-kyogre-rayquaza-counter-best-team/)\n\n**Aniimo Could Be a Solid Pokemon and Palworld Rival, If Your PC Can Handle It (Preview)**\nAniimo, a free-to-play creature collector developed by Pawprint Studio and Kingslory, is generating anticipation among fans of Pok\u00e9mon and cozy games. The game's second Closed Beta, launched on January 23, 2026, offers a visually stunning, open-world experience with anime-inspired aesthetics, exploration, and puzzle-solving elements. Unlike Palworld, Aniimo emphasizes open-ended exploration over survival and base-building, with a story-driven but largely player-directed progression. Core gameplay includes catching 'aniimo' using a mechanic similar to Palworld and Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, enhanced by a unique 'Twining' feature that allows players to temporarily become their collected aniimo to solve environmental puzzles, access restricted areas, and traverse the world. The game integrates MMO-style social features with non-intrusive in-game chat. While the beta version shows promise with intuitive tutorials and engaging world design, it suffers from an overabundance of menus, currencies, and unclear reward systems typical of free-to-play titles. Notably, the game demands high PC specifications\u2014straining older systems and even some modern laptops\u2014raising concerns about accessibility. However, the planned multiplatform release (PC, mobile, Xbox Series X|S) may mitigate these performance issues. Despite rough edges, Aniimo shows strong potential as a rival to Pok\u00e9mon and Palworld, particularly for players seeking a visually rich, open-world creature-collecting experience with innovative mechanics. The full release is expected in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 10:30 PM\nSource:[Comicbook](https://comicbook.com/gaming/feature/aniimo-could-be-a-solid-pokemon-and-palworld-rival-if-your-pc-can-handle-it-preview/)\n\n**NASA used Claude to plot a route for its Perseverance rover on Mars**\nNASA successfully used Anthropic's Claude large language model to plot a 400-meter route through a rocky area of Mars' Jezero crater for its Perseverance rover between December 8 and 10, 2025, marking the first time an AI model has been used to pilot the rover. The task required Claude to process years of contextual data from the rover, generate waypoints in ten-meter segments, and iteratively refine the route. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) engineers verified the AI-generated path using their standard simulation system, making only minor adjustments\u2014such as one based on ground-level images not available to Claude during planning. NASA estimates that using Claude reduces route-planning time by half, increases consistency, and allows operators to conduct more drives, collect more scientific data, and perform more analysis. This advancement is particularly significant given NASA's workforce reduction of about 4,000 employees (20% of its workforce) due to Trump administration cuts and a proposed 50% cut to its science budget in 2025, which Congress rejected. The success highlights a dramatic leap for Anthropic, whose Claude model evolved from failing to beat Pok\u00e9mon Red in 2024 to enabling interplanetary navigation in under a year. NASA expressed excitement about future collaborations, noting that autonomous AI systems could enable probes to explore more distant parts of the solar system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:37 PM\nSource:[engadget](https://www.engadget.com/ai/nasa-used-claude-to-plot-a-route-for-its-perseverance-rover-on-mars-203150701.html)\n\n**New Nintendo Direct Focused on Third-Party Games Set for February 5, 2026**\nAccording to reliable sources including insider NatetheHate and GameXplain, a new Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase is scheduled for Thursday, February 5, 2026, as confirmed by sources close to VGC.

The article updates insights from a prior piece written two months after the release of Claude Opus 4.5, noting that the model has advanced significantly since the original analysis. After the initial article, Claude overcame key obstacles: he beat Silph Co, completed the Safari Zone, solved Pokemon Mansion, collected all eight badges, and reached Victory Road, where he remains stuck on boulder puzzles. Key observations from the original analysis still hold: Claude has better vision (though still poor), improved spatial awareness, better use of context window, enhanced ability to detect and escape loops, and persistence despite frequent stalling. However, long-term planning remains weak\u2014evidenced by his failure to collect Gold Teeth in the Safari Zone, which are required to obtain the HM for STRENGTH. Fortunately, he later realized the oversight and backtracked successfully. The article emphasizes that persistence, not flawless reasoning, enables progress. The author notes that while Claude may eventually beat the game with unlimited time, the upcoming release of a new Claude model is expected to reset the run soon, potentially accelerating progress. The project is seen as a rigorous benchmark of LLM capabilities, more authentic than other tests that rely on external assistance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:14 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gogZyeistdaDFuhbG/claude-plays-pokemon-opus-4-5-follow-up)\n\n**Why Your Childhood Pok\u00e9mon Games Are the Newest Test for Advanced AI | iPhone in Canada**\nClassic 1990s Pok\u00e9mon games, including Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, are being used as a benchmark for evaluating advanced artificial intelligence models, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

The challenge began in February 2024 when Anthropic launched a livestream of Claude Sonnet 3.7 playing the game, marking the first time a Claude model could meaningfully engage with it\u2014previous versions 'wandered aimlessly or got stuck in loops' and failed to progress beyond the opening stages. Although Sonnet 3.7 attracted around 2,000 viewers during its stream, it could not complete the game, often getting stuck for dozens of hours. The latest model, Claude Opus 4.5, performs better but still frequently fails, such as spending four days circling a gym without entering because it failed to recognize it needed to cut down a tree. In contrast, Google's Gemini models completed a similar game in May 2024, prompting CEO Sundar Pichai to humorously claim Google was 'one step closer to creating Artificial Pok\u00e9mon Intelligence.' The difficulty AI systems face with Pok\u00e9mon reflects broader limitations in real-world reasoning, consistency, and situational awareness, offering more meaningful insight into their capabilities than traditional benchmark metrics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 07:27 PM\nSource:[TIME](https://time.com/7345903/ai-chatgpt-claude-gemini-pokemon/)\n\n**New Board Game 'SLIDE' to Launch in Japan on December 19, 2025**\nStudio Mundii Co., Ltd. (based in Minato, Tokyo, CEO: Hiroyuki Nakajima) will release the new board game 'SLIDE' (Japanese edition) on Friday, December 19, 2025. The game is priced at a suggested retail price of 2,970 yen (tax included). It is a simple yet strategic game where players arrange 16 cards (each numbered 1 to 10, with 10 copies per number) in a 4\u00d74 grid face-down. After a rock-paper-scissors match to determine the starting player, each round involves players simultaneously selecting one card, which is then placed into their grid by sliding it from the outside. The game ends after 16 rounds, when all cards are face-up. Points are calculated by eliminating connected pairs of identical numbers; any remaining unpaired numbers result in negative points. The player with the fewest negative points wins. The game supports 2\u20136 players, lasts about 15 minutes, and is suitable for ages 7 and up. The game was designed by Claude Cl\u00e9ment and features artwork by Joey. It will be available through Amazon and nationwide electronics retailers, toy stores, and board game shops. Studio Mundii also announced upcoming releases for 2026, including 'Arcade Challenger' (spring), 'Exghost: The Ghost Eraser' (summer), 'Paw! Cat Ludo' (summer), 'Let's Go Thank You Tiger Boy!' (autumn), 'Pit In!' (winter), and an unnamed title for spring 2027.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u914d\u4fe1\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2No.1\uff5cPR TIMES](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000024.000067526.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nAs of early February 2026, **Anthropic's Claude (Opus 4.5) has not completed the Generation 1 Pok\u00e9mon League** in the \"Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\" project [11][12][15][18].
