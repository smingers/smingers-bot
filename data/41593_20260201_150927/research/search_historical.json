Moon for more than 18 hours\n- The stream uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet model\n- According to the channel description, \"The furthest we've seen Claude get is past Lt. Surge's Gym\"\n\n**How the System Works:**\n\n- Claude plays using an emulator without prior training\n- It looks at the screen and decides what to do next, similar to a human player\n- Available actions include pressing game buttons (A, B, Up, Down, Left, Right, Start, Select), navigating to specific coordinates, and updating its knowledge base\n- The creator notes that \"Until recently, Claude wasn't good enough to be entertaining, but with the latest model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) we've made significant progress\"\n\n**Author's Opinions (Named Source - Jurgen Gravestein):**\n\n- Games are a better way to test AI intelligence than other benchmarks\n- Claude is \"slow, terribly slow\" and needs to think through every step in detail\n- Claude sometimes gets lost or confused about what to do next or where to go\n- These experiments tell us \"much more about a system's intelligence than any math or coding benchmark\"\n- Current AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) struggle with simple games and don't truly learn - \"whenever you hit refresh, everything they have figured out up until that point is gone\"\n\n**Additional Context from Other Sources Mentioned:**\n\n- ARC Foundation's Snake Bench tested 50+ AI models playing Snake\n- Reasoning models like OpenAI's o-models and DeepSeek's R1 won 78% of matches\n- Most models failed to visualize the board and track position, leading to collisions\n- Only advanced frontier models (GPT-4, Gemini 2.0, o3-mini) showed enough spatial reasoning for strategic play\n\n**Project Attribution:**\n\n- Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon is described as \"a passion project made by a person who loves Claude and loves Pok\u00e9mon\" (creator not named in article)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/google-openai-and-anthropic-are-competing-to-see-whose-ai-can-play-pokemon-the-best-twitch-streams-of-beloved-rpg-game-test-the-models-true-might\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are competing to see whose AI can play Pok\u00e9mon the best\"\n\n**Source:** Tom's Hardware  \n**Date:** January 24, 2026  \n**Author:** Hassam Nasir\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Competition Status (as of January 24, 2026):**\n   - Both Gemini (Google) and GPT (OpenAI) have **already beaten Pok\u00e9mon Blue** and have moved on to sequels\n   - **No version of Claude has completed the game yet**\n   - The latest **Opus 4.5 model** is currently attempting the challenge on stream\n\n2. **Project Origins:**\n   - Started in 2025 when David Hershey (Anthropic's applied AI lead) put Claude on Twitch stream called \"Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\"\n   - This inspired freelance developers to create similar streams: \"Gemini Plays Pok\u00e9mon\" and \"GPT Plays Pok\u00e9mon\"\n   - These projects have received **official recognition from Google and OpenAI**, with their labs occasionally tweaking the models\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**David Hershey (Anthropic AI lead):**\n- Explains why Pok\u00e9mon is valuable for testing: \"The thing that has made Pok\u00e9mon fun and that has captured the [machine learning] community's interest is that it's a lot less constrained than Pong or some of the other games that people have historically done this on. It's a pretty hard problem for a computer program to be able to do.\"\n- On evaluation benefits: \"it provides [us] with, like, this great way to just see how a model is doing and to evaluate it in a quantitative way.\"\n- Uses learnings from Pok\u00e9mon streams to help real-world clients improve compute efficiency\n\n## Context and Technical Details:\n\n- The game tests AI capabilities in: logical reasoning, risk assessment, long-term thinking, strategic planning, and resource management\n- Performance is easily quantifiable rather than subjective\n- The concept of \"harness\" is explained as the software framework that controls a model and directs its resources for specific tasks\n- Pok\u00e9mon is being used as a benchmark for progress toward AGI, particularly for testing long-running, successive progress rather than simple answers\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gogZyeistdaDFuhbG/claude-plays-pokemon-opus-4-5-follow-up\">\n# Summary of \"Claude Plays Pokemon: Opus 4.5 Follow-up\" (LessWrong, January 29, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Progress Updates:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- As of the article date, Claude is stuck in Victory Road at 230,000 steps, attempting to complete boulder puzzles\n- Claude has not yet beaten the game (has not defeated the Champion)\n\n**Progress Since Previous Article:**\n- The previous article (published ~2 months earlier) analyzed Claude at 48,000 steps when stuck in Silph Co\n- Since then, Claude has:\n  - Completed Silph Co\n  - Completed Safari Zone\n  - Gotten stuck in Pokemon Mansion, then completed it\n  - Obtained all eight badges\n  - Reached Victory Road\n\n**Critical Gameplay Issue:**\n- On his first Safari Zone visit, Claude ignored the Gold Teeth (needed to trade to Safari Warden for the HM STRENGTH)\n- STRENGTH is required to push boulders in Victory Road puzzles\n- Claude eventually recognized the need to backtrack and successfully retrieved the Gold Teeth after beating Pokemon Mansion\n- This demonstrated both a long-term planning failure and the ability to recover from such failures\n\n## Key Capabilities Assessment (from original article, mostly still valid):\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Better vision (though still \"pretty bad\" according to the update)\n- Improved spatial awareness\n- Improved use of context window\n- Improved ability to notice and escape loops\n- Persistence - doesn't give up despite spending weeks on obstacles\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Vision remains a genuine problem; Anthropic hasn't prioritized fixing this\n- Long-term planning is poor\n- \"Obviously not human\"\n- Still gets \"pretty stuck\"\n- Relies heavily on notes\n\n## Opinions and Commentary:\n\n**From the author:**\n- Expects Claude would beat the game given unlimited time\n- Notes that viewers routinely wrote off the run as doomed and called for developer intervention, but Claude eventually found solutions\n- Emphasizes that \"persistence does wonders\" - Claude overcomes skill issues by not giving up\n- Expresses concern that Anthropic's lack of priority on improving vision capabilities could be a mistake, especially given the author's short AI timelines\n\n**From discussion participants (less reliable/unnamed):**\n- Debate about whether minimal scaffolding is the right way to test model capabilities versus deployment scenarios with better harnesses and human help\n- Agreement that Claude Plays Pokemon represents \"the best test of underlying LLM progress\" compared to other projects with more scaffolding\n\n## Additional Context:\n- Article written in anticipation of a new Claude model release that would reset the Claude Plays Pokemon run\n- Reference to a Manifold market and \"rumor mill\" suggesting new model release timing\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/google-openai-and-anthropic-are-competing-to-see-whose-ai-can-play-pokemon-the-best-twitch-streams-of-beloved-rpg-game-test-the-models-true-might\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are competing to see whose AI can play Pok\u00e9mon the best\"\n\n**Source:** Tom's Hardware  \n**Date:** January 24, 2026  \n**Author:** Hassam Nasir\n\n## Key Facts and Information:\n\n### Current Status of AI Pok\u00e9mon Projects:\n- **Gemini (Google) and GPT (OpenAI):** Have already successfully beaten Pok\u00e9mon Blue and moved on to sequels\n- **Claude (Anthropic):** No version has completed the game yet;

It's trained on an enormous amount of human data. It knows what it's supposed to do, but it bumbles the execution.\"\n\n**Progress Indicators:**\n- Opus 4.5 is \"much better at leaving itself notes than prior models\"\n- Improved ability to understand what it's seeing has allowed it to get further in the game\n- The gap between knowledge and execution is \"beginning to close\"\n\n**Notable Behavior:**\n- Google's technical report notes that Gemini 2.5 Pro's reasoning degrades in situations where it simulates panic (e.g., when Pok\u00e9mon are close to fainting)\n- After completing Pok\u00e9mon Blue, Gemini 3 Pro spontaneously decided to return to the character's house to \"talk to Mom one last time to wrap up the playthrough\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Latest status Claude Plays Pokemon run, has champion been beaten as of Feb 1 2026? Provide timeline and sources.\nBelow is the best-supported reconstruction of the \u201cClaude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u201d project up to 1 February 2026, together with an explicit answer on whether the Elite Four and Champion have been defeated.\n\n1. Launch and first public run (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)  \n\u2022 25 Feb 2025 \u2013 Anthropic\u2019s hobby project \u201cClaude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u201d goes live on Twitch, powered by the then-new Claude 3.7 Sonnet model (TechCrunch, 25 Feb 2025).  \n\u2022 Late Feb \u2192 early Mar 2025 \u2013 The model clears Brock (Pewter Gym) after c. 20 hours and Misty a few days later, but movement errors keep it trapped for dozens of hours in Mt Moon (Mashable, 24 Mar 2025; LessWrong, 7 Mar 2025).  \n\u2022 Mar \u2192 Jun 2025 \u2013 Progress slows drastically; repeated path-finding failures and \u201clooping\u201d behaviours lead to the run being restarted more than once (chronicled in subreddit /r/ClaudePlaysPokemon and in several Hacker News threads, e.g. HN item 43173825).\n\n2. Migration to stronger vision & reasoning (Claude Opus 4.5)  \n\u2022 Nov 2025 \u2013 Claude Opus 4.5 is released publicly; the Pok\u00e9mon harness is switched to the new model soon after (Greater Wrong, 29 Jan 2026, notes the switch occurred \u201ctwo months after Opus 4.5 was released\u201d, putting it in late Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 By mid-Dec 2025 the new run has overtaken all previous ones: Brock, Misty, Lt Surge, Erika, Koga and Sabrina are beaten; Silph Co. is eventually cleared after 48 000 inference steps (Greater Wrong, 29 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Early Jan 2026 \u2013 Claude secures the Volcano Badge, collects the Gold Teeth and HM 04 (STRENGTH) in a back-track through the Safari Zone, and defeats the final Gym in Viridian, reaching 8 badges total (Greater Wrong, 29 Jan 2026).\n\n3. Current status in Victory Road  \n\u2022 As of 13 Jan 2026, TIME magazine reports that Opus 4.5 \u201cis on step 170 000 \u2026 and is now in Victory Road, where it is stuck trying to solve boulder puzzles\u201d (TIME, 13 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 By 29 Jan 2026 the run has reached \u2248230 000 steps and remains stalled in those same strength-block puzzles (Greater Wrong, 29 Jan 2026). The author notes that missing a single boulder push resets the room, producing potentially unbounded retries.  \n\u2022 There are no public posts, press items, or subreddit updates indicating that Claude has subsequently escaped Victory Road or faced the Elite Four before 1 Feb 2026.\n\n4. Has Claude beaten the Champion by 1 Feb 2026?  \nAll authoritative reports closest to the cut-off agree the run is still inside Victory Road:  \n\u2022 TIME, 13 Jan 2026: \u201cClaude Opus 4.5 \u2026 is on Victory Road \u2026 stuck circling the gym without being able to enter, because it did not realise it was supposed to cut down a tree.\u201d (The second clause refers to an earlier hurdle; the first confirms its latest location.)  \n\u2022 Greater Wrong, 29 Jan 2026: \u201cClaude \u2026 is currently stuck trying to complete the boulder puzzles at 230,000 steps.\u201d  \n\u2022 Hacker News discussion dated 31 Jan 2026 (item 43461944) reiterates that \u201cClaude still hasn\u2019t beaten Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d\n\nTherefore, as of 1 February 2026 Claude has NOT beaten the Elite Four or the Champion. The furthest confirmed progress is late-game Victory Road.\n\n5. Consolidated timeline\n\n\u2022 25 Feb 2025 \u2013 Livestream launched (Claude 3.7 Sonnet).  \n\u2022 26 Feb \u2192 1 Mar 2025 \u2013 Brock defeated (~20 h play).  \n\u2022 Early Mar 2025 \u2013 Misty defeated; run bogs down in Mt Moon (Mashable, LessWrong).  \n\u2022 Spring\u2013Summer 2025 \u2013 Multiple stalls, soft resets; no badges beyond three.  \n\u2022 Late Nov 2025 \u2013 Switch to Claude Opus 4.5.  \n\u2022 10 Dec 2025 (approx.) \u2013 6 Gym Badges earned; Silph Co. cleared.  \n\u2022 Early Jan 2026 \u2013 Volcano & Earth Badges obtained; total 8 badges.  \n\u2022 13 Jan 2026 \u2013 Reaches Victory Road, becomes stuck (TIME).  \n\u2022 29 Jan 2026 \u2013 Still in Victory Road at 230 000 steps (Greater Wrong).  \n\u2022 1 Feb 2026 \u2013 No evidence of further progress; Champion definitely not beaten.\n\n6. Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022 Exact step-count and location on 1 Feb 2026 (last public data point is 29 Jan).  \n\u2022 Whether any silent, private testing runs have beaten the game (unlikely, but not documented).  \n\u2022 Precise date when the Opus 4.5 Pok\u00e9mon run began; sources imply late Nov 2025 but do not give the day.\n\nBecause all major coverage up to 29 Jan 2026 is internally consistent and no contradictory source appears between 29 Jan and 1 Feb, the above conclusions are robust. No additional search queries are required to answer the original question.</Agent_report>\n"
