Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**LessWrong/Greaterwrong post (Jan 29, 2026)** - High relevance. Written by Josh Snider, the organizer of the experiment. As of Jan 29, 2026 (~4 weeks ago from today), Claude (Opus 4.5) is at ~230,000 steps, stuck in Victory Road on boulder puzzles. He notes the run is near its end - either Claude finishes Victory Road and the Pokémon League, or the stream resets for a new model. This is the most directly relevant and recent source. The author is an identifiable expert (the organizer).

**TIME article (Jan 13, 2026)** - High relevance. As of Jan 13, Claude Opus 4.5 had played 500+ hours and reached ~step 170,000, still not finished. Notes Claude frequently gets stuck. Confirms Gemini completed an equivalent game in May 2025 with a more assistive harness.

**Agent Report** - Useful compilation. Notes GPT-o3 cleared in ~15 days, GPT-5 in 7 days, Gemini in ~48-55 hours of continuous streaming (after ~1 month of demo). Claude had NOT cleared as of Feb 2025. Demo-to-clear lag for LLM agents: 1-5 weeks once they're near the end.

**Saanya Ojha Substack** - Moderate relevance. Mentions unverified community reports that Claude completed the game (~35,000 steps), but this appears to be a different setup than the Twitch stream. Not directly applicable to resolution criteria.

**MARCA article (Aug 2025)** - About GPT-5, not Claude. Contextual only.

**GoNintendo** - About OpenAI and Gemini, contextual only.

**AI Digest/AI Village** - About a separate experiment, low direct relevance but shows Claude Opus 4.1 has a tendency to declare premature victory.

**GitHub repos** - Technical background, no progress info.

**TPP sources** - Historical background only.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: LLM agents completing Pokémon once near the end of the game**
- Gemini: ~1 month from first demo to clear, with the final streaming run taking ~48-55 hours
- GPT-5: ~9 days from demo to clear, 7-day run
- GPT-o3: ~5 weeks from demo to clear, 15-day run
- Claude is already at Victory Road (near the end) as of Jan 29, 2026

**Reference Class 2: Claude Plays Pokémon historical sticking points**
- Claude spent days circling a gym, weeks stuck in Mt. Moon, got stuck in Silph Co., got stuck in Pokémon Mansion, and is now stuck in Victory Road. Each obstacle took days to weeks to overcome.

**Reference Class 3: Model resets**
- The organizer anticipated a model reset imminently (as of Jan 29, 2026). A reset would restart the game, potentially delaying completion by months.

The most suitable reference class is a combination of RC1 and RC2: Claude is near the end but has a documented pattern of getting stuck for days to weeks at each obstacle. Victory Road's boulder puzzles are a known difficulty. The organizer also anticipated a potential reset.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Today is Feb 26, 2026.** The question resolves by Oct 1, 2026 (7+ months remaining).

As of Jan 29, 2026 (4 weeks ago), Claude was stuck in Victory Road. Since then:
- Either Claude has made progress and potentially completed the game (or is close)
- Or the stream was reset to a new model (which the organizer anticipated)

Victory Road is the penultimate obstacle before the Elite Four. After Victory Road, Claude would need to defeat the Elite Four (4 trainers) and Champion Blue. This is primarily a combat challenge rather than navigation, which Claude handles better than spatial puzzles.

Historical patterns:
- Claude took ~weeks to overcome each major obstacle
- Victory Road boulder puzzles are similar in difficulty to previous navigation challenges
- Once past Victory Road, the Elite Four/Champion battle is more straightforward (turn-based combat, Claude's stronger suit)

If no reset occurred: Claude could complete the game within days to a few weeks from Jan 29.
If a reset occurred: The new model would need to replay from the beginning, potentially taking months.

The organizer's Jan 29 post strongly suggested a reset was imminent. If a new Claude model was released around late January/early February 2026, the stream likely reset. A full new run could take 2-4 months based on prior runs (the current run took ~11 months from Feb 2025 to reach Victory Road, though that included many model changes and improvements).

However, with each new model generation being significantly more capable, a new model might complete the game much faster than the previous run.

## (d) Justification

Key factors:
1. **Near completion as of Jan 29, 2026**: Claude was at Victory Road, the final dungeon before the Elite Four. This is very close to the end.
2. **Potential model reset**: The organizer anticipated an imminent reset. If this happened, a new (presumably more capable) model would restart from scratch.
3. **New model capability**: Each new Claude model has been significantly more capable. A new model starting fresh might complete the game in weeks to months rather than the ~11 months the previous run took.
4. **Pattern of getting stuck**: Even near the end, Claude has historically gotten stuck for extended periods.
5. **Resolution window**: The question resolves Oct 1, 2026, giving 7+ months.

**Scenario A (No reset, current run continues)**: ~30-40% probability. Claude completes Victory Road and Elite Four within days to weeks. Completion likely in February-March 2026.

**Scenario B (Reset occurred, new model starts fresh)**: ~60-70% probability. A new, more capable model restarts. Given the trajectory of improvement (each model completes faster), a new model might complete in 1-4 months. Completion likely in March-June 2026.

**Scenario C (Reset + new model also gets stuck or another reset)**: Possible but less likely given the resolution window extends to October.

Given today is Feb 26 and I have no information about what happened in the last 4 weeks, I need to account for uncertainty. The most likely outcome is that the game is completed sometime in the March-June 2026 range, with meaningful probability extending to later in 2026.

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be:
- Left tail (early completion): If no reset occurred, Claude could have completed the game in early-to-mid February. But since the question opened Jan 18 and today is Feb 26, if it had been completed very early, we might expect that to be reflected in sources. The Jan 29 source shows Claude was still stuck. So Feb 26 or later is likely.
- Central mass: March-May 2026, accounting for either continued current run or a new model run
- Right tail: June-September 2026 if multiple resets occur or new model also struggles significantly
- Beyond resolution (>Oct 1): ~15-20% probability if the stream resets multiple times or faces technical issues

The lower bound is Jan 18, 2026 (closed). Given the Jan 29 source shows Claude still stuck, the 10th percentile should be no earlier than late February 2026.
