Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**LessWrong/Greaterwrong post (Jan 29, 2026) by Josh Snider:** Most directly relevant source. As of Jan 29, 2026, Claude (Opus 4.5) is at ~230,000 steps, stuck in Victory Road on boulder puzzles. Author notes Claude would likely beat the game given unlimited time, but anticipates an imminent model reset. Author is the stream organizer/close observer — high credibility for factual status updates. Key fact: Claude has all 8 badges and is in Victory Road as of late January 2026.

**TIME article (Jan 13, 2026):** States Claude Opus 4.5 has played 500+ hours and reached ~step 170,000, still not finished. Notes Gemini completed an equivalent game in May 2025 with a more assistive harness. Credible journalistic source, but slightly older than the LessWrong post.

**Substack (Saanya Ojha):** Claims community reports suggest Claude completed Pokémon Red (~35,000 steps), but flags this as unverified and notes it's likely a different setup than the Twitch stream. Should be treated cautiously — this appears to refer to a separate benchmark run, not the Twitch stream.

**MARCA article (Aug 2025):** GPT-5 completed Pokémon Red in 141 hours/6,470 steps. Credible gaming journalism. Confirms GPT-5 completed the game in August 2025, not relevant to Claude's Twitch stream.

**GoNintendo article:** Gemini 2.5 Pro completed Pokémon Blue in 813 hours (then 406.5 hours after optimization). Useful comparative benchmark.

**Agent Report:** Synthesizes documented AI completions. GPT-o3 cleared in ~15 days, GPT-5 in 7 days, Gemini in ~48-55 hours of continuous streaming. Claude had not cleared as of Feb 2025. The agent report notes demo-to-clear lag for LLM agents is 1-5 weeks once they're in finishing position.

**GitHub repos, Twitch Plays Pokémon historical sources:** Background context only.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Other AI agents completing Pokémon Red from near-end position**
Gemini completed from a similar position in ~48-55 hours of continuous streaming. GPT-5 completed in 7 days total. However, Claude's harness is deliberately more minimal, and Claude has been stuck in Victory Road specifically on boulder puzzles.

**Reference Class 2: Claude's historical pattern of getting stuck**
Claude spent 4 days circling a gym, got stuck in Mt. Moon, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion. Each time it eventually broke through. Victory Road boulder puzzles are a known hard obstacle. The pattern suggests eventual completion but with potentially long delays.

**Reference Class 3: Model resets**
The LessWrong author explicitly anticipates a model reset imminently (as of Jan 29, 2026). If a reset occurs, the new model would need to replay from the beginning, potentially adding months. This is a critical uncertainty.

**Most suitable reference class:** Claude's own historical pattern of getting stuck then breaking through, combined with the possibility of a model reset. The question window is Jan 18 - Oct 1, 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Today is Feb 26, 2026. The resolution window ends Oct 1, 2026 — about 7 months remain.

As of Jan 29, 2026, Claude was in Victory Road with all 8 badges. Victory Road is the final dungeon before the Pokémon League. If no reset occurs, Claude needs to:
1. Solve Victory Road boulder puzzles (currently stuck here)
2. Navigate to the Pokémon League
3. Defeat Elite Four + Champion

Historical patterns:
- Claude has broken through every obstacle eventually (Mt. Moon, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion)
- The author expected either completion or reset "imminently" as of Jan 29
- If a new model was released and the stream reset, the new run would need to replay the entire game

Key uncertainty: Whether a model reset happened. The LessWrong author anticipated this. If reset occurred in early February 2026, the new run would be starting fresh. Given Claude's previous run took from ~Feb 2025 to Jan 2026 (~11 months) to reach Victory Road, a full reset could push completion to late 2026 or beyond the resolution window.

However, newer Claude models are faster/better, and the harness has improved. The previous run accelerated significantly in later stages.

## (d) Justification

**Scenario A: No reset, Claude completes Victory Road (probability ~30%)**
If the stream continued with Opus 4.5 and Claude solved the boulder puzzles, completion could have happened in February-March 2026. The author's Jan 29 post suggested this was imminent. Probability of completion in Feb-March 2026: moderate.

**Scenario B: Reset occurred, new model starts fresh (probability ~50%)**
The author strongly anticipated a reset. A new Claude model (presumably Opus 5 or similar) starting fresh would benefit from a better model but need to replay the entire game. Given the previous run took ~11 months to reach Victory Road, even with improvements, a new run might take 3-6 months. This would put completion in May-August 2026.

**Scenario C: Reset occurred, new model is significantly faster (probability ~15%)**
If the new model is dramatically better (like GPT-5's efficiency gains), it might complete the game in weeks. This would put completion in March-April 2026.

**Scenario D: Doesn't complete before Oct 1, 2026 (probability ~20%)**
Given the history of getting stuck and potential multiple resets, there's meaningful probability of non-completion within the window.

The question resolves as a date within the window (Jan 18 - Oct 1, 2026), and if it doesn't resolve, the question presumably doesn't resolve (open upper bound). Given the strong momentum as of late January 2026 and the 7-month window, I'd estimate ~75-80% probability of resolution within the window.

For the distribution of *when* it resolves (conditional on resolving), the central estimate is around April-June 2026, with significant uncertainty in both directions.

Outside view calibration:

The key factors shaping this distribution:
- As of Jan 29, 2026, Claude was in Victory Road — very close to completion if no reset
- High probability of model reset (author explicitly anticipated it)
- If reset: new run likely takes 2-5 months given improving models
- If no reset: completion likely within weeks of Jan 29
- ~20-25% chance of non-resolution within window (extends beyond Oct 1)

The distribution should be somewhat bimodal: a cluster in Feb-March 2026 (if no reset and quick completion) and a larger cluster in April-July 2026 (if reset and new run). The 10th percentile should be in mid-February (fastest plausible scenario), and the 90th percentile should approach or exceed the Oct 1 deadline.

Given the open upper bound, I'll set the 90th percentile at or near Oct 1, acknowledging meaningful probability of non-resolution.
