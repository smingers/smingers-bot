**Analyzing distribution and status**

I need to focus on delivering an analysis and ensuring proper distribution with sources included. Today's date is important, and I have to cover the timeframe from January 18 to October 1. I don't have direct Twitch status from February 26, but evidence from January 29 indicates a standstill in progress. I've also noticed discussions about potential resets and timelines that are vague but may impact outcomes, possibly leading to a new model around February. Historically, challenges take time, but overall, the chances of progress by October 1 seem favorable.**Updating predictions and distribution**

I need to make my predictions more bimodal but adjust my thinking since nearly a month has passed between January 29 and February 26. If nothing has been completed yet, that could indicate they're still stuck or have reset, which would delay distribution. I should update the 10th percentile to something like March 10, setting future forecasts within that time. As for the 90th percentile, I'm considering extending it to dates in late 2026, perhaps around October 20 or December 1, to reflect a chance that they might not finish by October 1.**Examining resolution and predictions**

I need to consider the resolution timeline: if this isn’t completed by October 1, it might resolve later, and Metaculus allows for that with an open upper bound. I’m using an outside view as a baseline with key dates but need to shift them based on recent information. Given that no completion has been reported as of February 26, I might need to move the median to around July. Since other models have surpassed Claude's capabilities, that indicates some limitations, and if a reset has occurred, I’d expect a mid-year completion.**Setting prediction dates**

I'm planning to set the following prediction dates: p10 for April 5, 2026, p20 for May 10, p40 for June 25, p60 for August 5, p80 for September 20, and p90 for November 10, which is beyond the initial window. I need to ensure these are in strictly increasing order while incorporating analysis components (a)-(d) for weighing evidence. I’ll also create a checklist and note the implied median between p40 and p60, targeting mid-July, with the mean likely in early August. Now it's time to craft the response!
