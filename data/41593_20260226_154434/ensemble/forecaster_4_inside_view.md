Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. LessWrong post 2026-01-29 (Maya Farber Brodsky). Eye-witness notes, time-stamped clips. FACT: Claude Opus 4.5 has all 8 badges and is stuck in Victory Road’s boulder puzzle. Quality: good but single observer; moderate weight.  
2. Times of India 2026-01-23 (reprints WSJ). FACT: as of late-Jan no Claude version has finished; Opus 4.5 is live. Quality: mainstream paper quoting project lead David Hershey; strong weight.  
3. Engadget feature 2025-?? (article date late-2025). Historical narrative of earlier Sonnet runs; shows multiday stalls. Quality: vetted tech outlet; background only; moderate weight.  
4. Manifold market thread (second-run log, 2025-autumn). FACT: prior run reset before step 200 k; community notes on resets when new model drops. Quality: informal crowd log; weak–moderate weight.  
5. Feb 24-25 2026 outage reports (AndroidAuthority / USA Today FTW). FACT: Claude platform interruptions for ~24 h. Quality: tech news; weak direct relevance, but demonstrates risk of technical downtime.  
All other articles (AI constitution, NASA plugin, Pokémon anniversary, etc.) contain no information about the stream’s progress and are ignored for forecasting.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent mainstream sources (1,2) agree: Opus 4.5 is in end-game but not yet victorious.  
Moderate evidence  
• History of resets coinciding with new model releases → non-negligible risk of progress wipe.  
• Past episodes of getting stuck for several DAYS on simpler puzzles show high variance in time-to-solve.  
Weak evidence  
• One-day global outage could recur and delay play.  
• Speculation that “Claude 5” may launch mid-year.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window left: ~7 months (218 days) until 2026-10-01.  
If timeframe were halved (≈ 3.5 months) my median would shift slightly earlier, but a fat right tail would remain because resets could still occur.  
If doubled (≈ 14 months) the distribution would broaden but centre of mass would not shift much because I already allow spill-over past October.

(d) Justification / outside→inside shift  
Outside view base rate: AI agents that reach Victory Road generally finish within **days–weeks** once perception/planning are adequate.  
Inside view adjustments:  
+ Claude already at Victory Road → pulls forecast earlier.  
– Documented multi-day loops and puzzle confusion → pushes forecast later (weeks→months).  
– Historical resets on new model releases (second→third run) introduce ≥30 % chance of large delay.  
Resulting mixture: 60 % probability of success before July, 40 % after, with a long but not dominant tail into late 2026.

Distribution calibration
• I translate the mixture into dates (YYYY-MM-DD).  
• Shape: logit-like; modest skew right.  
• Median (50 %) lies between 40th & 60th percentiles (≈ mid-June).  
• Mean ≈ early July – consistent with justification.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: date Claude Plays Pokémon beats Champion during 2026 Twitch run.  
2. Base-rate anchored to other AI agents that have already beaten Gen 1 once in end-game.  
3. Implied median ≈ 2026-06-15; mean ≈ 2026-07-05; coherent with narrative.  
4. Key evidence: a) Victory Road status (fact), b) prior week-long stalls, c) history of resets, d) 7-month window.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden human hot-fix or new tool gives Claude perfect pathfinding tomorrow → outcome sooner than 10th %.  
6. Status-quo: slow but steady progress; my distribution leans only slightly earlier.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct format, within/beyond bounds as allowed.
