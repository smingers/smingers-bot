**Analyzing prediction parameters**

I need to provide a detailed analysis that includes looking at sources, classifying references, and considering the timeframe. The outside view is crucial for calibration, so I’ll need to create predictions using percentiles like 10, 20, 40, up to 90. The date range will start from today, 2026-02-26, and go until 2026-10-01, but I might extend it beyond that for the 90th percentile. I should consider the baseline chance, ensuring I stay aligned with the required format.**Evaluating completion timelines**

I’m analyzing historical data about AI agents completing Pokémon games, specifically focusing on when they reach the championship level after getting 8 badges. The typical time to finish can vary a lot. For instance, one model is stuck right now, and if it resets, progress could start over. Based on past experiences with other models, they usually finish in 1-4 weeks, but this one is slower. I estimate a 50% chance it will complete by mid-2026 and will present percentiles for completion dates.**Crafting the analysis**

I need to clarify the date range for my analysis, noting that the 80th percentile can go beyond October 1, 2026, as that's acceptable. I want to ensure the data I present is strictly increasing. For source analysis, I’ll summarize key articles, like those from Greaterwrong, TIME, and others related to AI progress. Then I’ll evaluate these sources, considering timeframes and patterns. My justification will tie everything together, calibrating the outside view to capture relevant parameters accurately. Let’s get started!
