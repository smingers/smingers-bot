Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   a. LessWrong post (29 Jan 2026, Maya Farber Brodsky). Eyewitness summary of the current Opus 4.5 run; says Claude now has all eight badges and is in Victory Road.  Good recency, niche but technically diligent.  Mostly factual screenshots plus log links (strong).  
   b. Times of India / Wall Street Journal re-print (23 Jan 2026).  Mainstream outlet; quotes project lead David Hershey.  Confirms “no Claude version has finished yet”; identifies current model as Opus 4.5.  Reliable for the negative claim (moderate).  
   c. Manifold market page on the second run (early Jan 2026).  Crowd discussion; confirms second run reset, third run will use Claude 4.  Anecdotal, but step counts match LessWrong logs (weak → moderate because independent).  
   d. Engadget feature (late 2025).  Historical—documents how hard Mt Moon/Viridian were and the type of tooling used.  Provides base-rate context (weak, older).  
   e. AskNews outage reports (25 Feb 2026).  Show multi-hour Claude API failures.  Indirect evidence that interruptions are possible but usually short-lived (weak).  

   Factual consensus:  
   • As of 26 Feb 2026 Claude Opus 4.5 run is alive, sitting in Victory Road, not yet Champion.  
   • Previous two resets occurred when a new model shipped; each reset cost ~2–4 weeks to regain prior progress.  
   • Claude’s pace has accelerated: 0 → Brock took 20 h, Brock → 8 badges took ~7 months, Safari Zone back-track solved within weeks.

2. Evidence weighting  
   Strong: LessWrong log of 8-badge state; historical pattern that once any player (human or AI) reaches Victory Road they finish within days to a few weeks if uninterrupted.  
   Moderate: Hershey quote that every new Claude release is tested from scratch (risk of reset); past resets twice in 12 mo.  
   Weak: February API outages; they demonstrate vulnerability but were <24 h.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Time until question closes: 217 days (~7.1 months).  If this were halved (3.5 mo) I would cut P(finish) by ~10 pp because a reset would almost certainly push after the window.  If doubled (14 mo) I would raise P(finish) by ~15 pp because multiple model cycles almost guarantee success.  

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view base: only 4/5 autonomous Gen-1 AI projects have ever finished → 80 % eventual completion, with a median 12 days once a “finishing run” begins.  Claude is ~30× slower than that, so naïve hazard gives ~13 % by 1 Oct.  

   Inside-view boosts:  
   • Position in game (inside VR) adds +20 pp.  
   • Rapid progress with 4.5 and likely stronger 5.0 raises +10 pp.  
   Inside-view dampers:  
   • 30 – 40 % chance of forced reset in next model release, costing ~3–6 weeks and risking new bugs (–10 pp).  
   • Chronic strategic lapses (e.g., forgot Gold Teeth) mean non-zero risk of month-long stalls even this late (–5 pp).  

   Net probability of finishing before 1 Oct 2026 ≈ 40 %.  I spread mass with a right-tail beyond the resolution window to reflect remaining 60 % that it never finishes (for this question).

Distribution calibration
Median (mid-point between my 40th and 60th percentiles) ≈ 2026-07-18.  Mean skewed later (~2026-08-15) because of fat right tail.  This matches rationale: good chance by late summer, but majority mass still in “not by deadline”.

Checklist:
1. Target: date Claude Plays Pokémon first defeats Champion, between 18 Jan 2026 and later.  
2. Outside-view distribution anchored at 80 % eventual, 13 % by 1 Oct baseline.  
3. Consistency check: implied median ≈ 18 Jul 2026; mean ≈ 15 Aug 2026; coherent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – LessWrong log: 8 badges, stuck in Victory Road.  
   – Hershey statement: no finish yet, resets on each model.  
   – Historical AI benchmarks: GPT/Gemini finished days after VR.  
   – Prior Claude resets took weeks to recover.  
5. Blind-spot: Anthropic quietly patches harness allowing Claude to brute-force puzzles overnight; finish occurs within days (earlier than 10th %).  
6. Status-quo: continuing slow play & possible reset favours “no finish by deadline”.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, ISO-date format.
