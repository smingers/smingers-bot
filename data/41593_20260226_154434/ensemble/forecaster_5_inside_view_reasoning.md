**Analyzing outcomes and percentiles**

I need to focus on the outcome dates between January 18 and October 1. If an event happens after October 1, I might say it’s N/A. The guidelines allow for upper percentiles to extend beyond the expected bounds if there's supporting evidence. So, I can provide dates like December 10, 2026, and January 15, 2027, while also including the within bound dates based on previous analysis. I'll make sure that the percentiles are strictly increasing as I craft the final analysis.**Crafting evidence-based analysis**

I need to gather information from various sources to create an inside view. The LessWrong follow-up from January 29, 2026, mentions Claude Opus 4.5 having 8 badges, indicating significant progress in the final dungeon. I’ll also reference an earlier Engadget article. Evaluating the probability of finishing by October 1 is crucial, especially considering potential resets to a new model, which could impact progress. I’ll analyze timeframe and calibrate distributions, aiming for an implied median around August 5, 2026, while clarifying that the median typically falls between the 40th and 60th percentiles. I’ll ensure all these details are combined in the final analysis.
