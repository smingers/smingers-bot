Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Has Claude already completed the game or been reset by Feb 26, 2026?**
- Forecaster 1 places P10 at Feb 28 (thinks there's ~10% chance it's already done or about to be done), while Forecaster 3 places P10 at April 5 and Forecaster 5 at March 19. Forecaster 1 assigns ~15% probability the game was completed before today.
- This is the most impactful disagreement for the left tail. If Claude already beat the game, the entire distribution collapses to a single point. If a reset occurred, the early percentiles should shift right significantly.
- Impact: Large — shifts P10-P20 by 3-5 weeks.

**Disagreement 2: Probability of completion before Oct 1, 2026 (right tail)**
- Forecaster 1 assigns ~90% probability of completion by Oct 1 (P90 at Sep 10). Forecaster 5 assigns only ~40% probability of completion by Oct 1 (P60 at Sep 5, P80 at Dec 10, P90 at Jan 15 2027). Forecasters 2, 3, and 4 fall in between with P90 values of Nov 15, Nov 10, and Dec 1 respectively.
- The core disagreement is about how likely resets and chronic stalling are to push completion beyond the resolution window. Forecaster 5 believes there's a ~60% chance Claude does NOT finish by Oct 1, while Forecaster 1 believes there's only ~10% chance of that.
- Impact: Very large — this is the biggest source of spread in the distributions.

**Disagreement 3: Whether a reset has already occurred and what model is currently playing**
- Forecaster 1 and 2 reference Manifold Markets info about a "third run with Claude 4" being announced, suggesting a reset already happened. Forecaster 5 seems less certain about whether a reset occurred. Forecasters 3 and 4 acknowledge reset risk but don't commit to whether one has already happened.
- This matters because if Claude 4 is already running and is significantly more capable, completion could come faster. If Opus 4.5 is still stuck in Victory Road, it could finish imminently or stall indefinitely.
- Impact: Moderate — shifts the median by 1-2 months depending on the answer.

Root Causes:

1. **Has Claude already completed or been reset?** — Different factual beliefs (verifiable). No forecaster has confirmed current stream status as of late February 2026. This is a factual question that can be resolved by checking the stream or recent reports.

2. **Probability of completion before Oct 1** — Different weighting of the same evidence AND different base rate assumptions. Forecaster 5 uses a much more conservative base rate (13% by Oct 1 from outside view, boosted to ~40%), while Forecaster 1 starts from a much more optimistic position (~90%). This stems from different interpretations of how analogous GPT/Gemini completions are (given different harnesses) and different assessments of reset probability and recovery time.

3. **Current model and reset status** — Different factual beliefs (verifiable). The Manifold Markets source is informal and could be outdated or inaccurate. The actual current state of the stream is a factual matter.
