Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1: Has Claude already completed the game or been reset by Feb 26, 2026?**
RESOLVED. The agent research confirms that as of February 2026, Claude has NOT beaten the game. The Time Magazine article (Jan 13, 2026) confirms the Opus 4.5 run is ongoing with 500+ hours logged. No reset has occurred since the switch to Opus 4.5. This rules out Forecaster 1's ~15% probability that the game was already completed. The early tail (P10 in late February) is too aggressive.

**Disagreement 2: Whether a reset has occurred and what model is playing**
PARTIALLY RESOLVED. The agent research confirms Claude Opus 4.5 is still the active model with no reset since the Opus-era upgrade. The Manifold Markets reference to "Claude 4" for a third run appears to have been about the current Opus 4.5 run itself, not a separate future reset. However, we now know that Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 have been released (Anthropic announcements found in research). These newer models show significant improvements in computer use, long-horizon planning, and agentic tasks. A reset to use Opus 4.6 is plausible but not confirmed.

**Disagreement 3: Probability of completion before Oct 1, 2026**
PARTIALLY RESOLVED. The research confirms Claude is still stuck and has not beaten the game. However, the discovery that Opus 4.6 exists (with major improvements in computer use, navigation, and long-horizon planning) provides a meaningful capability upgrade path. If a reset occurs to use Opus 4.6, the new model's improved capabilities could accelerate completion significantly. But a reset also means starting over, which adds months.

Updated Analysis:

Key facts established:
1. As of Feb 2026, Claude Opus 4.5 is playing, stuck in Victory Road with all 8 badges, ~500+ hours into the run
2. No reset has occurred recently
3. Claude Opus 4.6 now exists with significantly improved computer use and long-horizon planning capabilities
4. The game has NOT been completed

The critical question is whether:
- Opus 4.5 can solve Victory Road boulder puzzles and beat the Elite Four (possible but has been stuck for weeks)
- A reset to Opus 4.6 occurs (likely given historical pattern of resetting on new models), which would restart progress but with a much more capable model

Given Opus 4.6's described improvements in "navigating large, complex environments" and "sustained autonomous operation," a reset to this model could be very productive. Historical pattern: each model generation has been dramatically faster at reaching the same milestones.

Scenario analysis:
- **Opus 4.5 finishes without reset (~25%)**: Could happen in March-April if boulder puzzles are solved. Victory Road + Elite Four could take 2-6 weeks from current position.
- **Reset to Opus 4.6, then completion (~45%)**: Reset likely in March-April 2026. New model reaches end-game in 1-3 months, finishes by May-July 2026.
- **Multiple obstacles/resets push to late 2026 (~20%)**: Completion in Aug-Sep 2026.
- **Not completed by Oct 1 (~10%)**: Persistent failures or stream abandonment.

The weighted average seems reasonable but slightly too conservative in the middle given the Opus 4.6 capability improvements. The left tail should be shifted right (ruling out February completion), but the median should stay around May-June given the strong capability upgrade path.
