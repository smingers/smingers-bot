The \"Claude\" referenced in this article is a character from the mobile RPG *Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space*, not Anthropic's Claude AI. This article contains **no relevant information** for the question at hand.\n\n---\n\n### Article Content (for completeness)\n\nThe article covers an update to the mobile RPG *Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space*, developed by Wright Flyer Studios in collaboration with Square Enix. Key points include:\n\n- The game's **Chrono Cross collaboration event has been extended until December 8, 2031**, described as an unprecedented crossover duration.\n- A **December 18, 2025 update** adds Myunfa's \"Another Style\" and a 5-star Stellar Awakening for a game character named Claude (voiced by Rory Fleck Byrne).\n- A **February 2026 update** will introduce Glenn as a new playable character and add Stellar Awakenings for Chrono Cross characters Serge, Kid, Harle, and Starky.\n- New sub-quests tied to the Chrono Cross storyline are also planned for February 2026.\n\nAgain, none of this content is relevant to the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/how-this-30-year-old-pokemon-game-is-helping-google-openai-and-anthropic-to-evaluate-ai-models/articleshow/127301204.cms\">\n## Summary: How Pokemon Games Are Being Used to Evaluate AI Models\n**Source:** Times of India, January 23, 2026 (citing a Wall Street Journal report)\n\n### Key Facts\n\n- Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are all using original 1990s Pok\u00e9mon games to evaluate their AI models' capabilities in handling complex, long-term goals.\n- \"Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\" was created in **February 2025** by **David Hershey**, Applied AI Lead at Anthropic, on Twitch, which inspired similar streams for OpenAI and Google models.\n- The streams have collectively accumulated **hundreds of thousands of comments**.\n- **Critically for the forecast question:** As of the article's publication (January 23, 2026), **none of the Claude versions have completed the game yet**. The latest version, **Claude Opus 4.5**, is currently playing live on Twitch.\n- **Both OpenAI's GPT models and Google's Gemini have already beaten the original Pok\u00e9mon game**, and are now playing sequel games \u2014 though developers note this may be attributable to differences in the \"harnesses\" (software frameworks) built around them.\n\n### Expert Opinions\n- **David Hershey (Anthropic):** Pok\u00e9mon provides a quantitative way to evaluate model performance; newer Claude versions have improved but none have finished the game. He also built a **memory system** to help Claude retain important in-game information.\n- **Graham Neubig (Carnegie Mellon University):** Unlike traditional benchmarks, Pok\u00e9mon allows researchers to observe AI decision-making and goal-pursuit over an extended period.\n- **Jonathan Verron** (\"GPT Plays Pok\u00e9mon\" developer): Calls Pok\u00e9mon \"a perfect game for AI right now.\"\n\n### Contextual Notes\n- Anthropic brings a \"Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\" booth to industry conferences and maintains an internal Slack channel for staff to follow Claude's progress.\n- The article confirms Claude is still actively playing but has **not yet beaten the game** as of late January 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-isnt-a-great-pokemon-player-and-thats-okay-151522448.html\">\n## Summary: \"Claude isn't a great Pok\u00e9mon player, and that's okay\"\n\n**Source Note:** The article appears to be cut off near the end, so the final portion of Hershey's closing remarks is incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Context\n\n- The article covers **Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon**, a Twitch stream where Anthropic's Claude LLM attempts to play *Pok\u00e9mon Red*. After \"a month and counting,\" Claude had **failed to beat the game across multiple runs**.\n- The project was created by **David Hershey**, a member of Anthropic's go-to-market team, originally as a side project launched around the release of **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (June prior to article publication).\n- The current version playing is **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, described as a reasoning model designed to break problems into smaller pieces.\n\n---\n\n### Progress & Technical Details\n\n- Early milestone: Getting Claude to simply **leave the starting town and find Professor Oak** required \"ungodly hours of tinkering.\"\n- Claude was **not pretrained specifically for Pok\u00e9mon Red** \u2014 it knows basic facts (gym leader names, order) but lacks deep game-specific training.\n- A key technical challenge is **Claude's \"poor vision\"** \u2014 it struggles with pixel art and lacks continuous sensory input between button presses. Hershey added an **overlay to help Claude interpret the game interface** and a way to **read game memory** to reduce confusion.\n- Hershey delegated much of the programming work to **Anthropic's own coding agent**.\n\n---\n\n### Claude 3.7 Sonnet Improvements (per Hershey)\n\n- **Spends less time stuck on assumptions** compared to prior models \u2014 previous models would persist in wrong assumptions indefinitely; 3.7 Sonnet eventually self-corrects.\n- Better at **planning, developing new strategies, and adjusting** when assumptions prove wrong.\n- Notable example: Claude **intentionally fainted all its Pok\u00e9mon to escape Mt. Moon** \u2014 a novel self-devised strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Persistent Weaknesses Documented\n\n- Still **frequently gets stuck** in areas like Viridian Forest for days due to maze-like design.\n- After escaping Mt. Moon via the fainting strategy, Claude **deleted its notes on the area**, incorrectly believing it had successfully navigated it.\n- One promising run ended because **Claude failed to recognize it needed to talk to Bill** to progress, leading to an endless loop of bad decisions.\n- Struggles with both **short- and long-term planning**.\n\n---\n\n### Hershey's Assessment of the Project's Future\n\n- Acknowledges the benchmark may become **less useful internally** if Claude beats the game with only minor incremental improvements.\n- Has **no long-term strategy** for the project but implies he will continue testing each new Anthropic model release against the game.\n- Frames the project's value as understanding **how Claude handles long-duration agentic tasks**, not as a pure performance showcase.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://dailynous.com/2026/01/22/building-an-ais-moral-character/\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is primarily about Anthropic's approach to building Claude's moral character and its \"soul document\" / \"Constitution\" \u2014 it has **no direct relevance** to the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon stream or its progress toward beating the first Pok\u00e9mon game.\n\n### Key Points from the Article:\n\n**Topic:** The article discusses Anthropic's internal guidelines document for Claude (referred to as a \"soul document\" for Claude 4.5 Opus, later officially released as Claude's \"Constitution\" on January 22, 2026).\n\n**Source credibility:** The soul document was posted on LessWrong by AI enthusiast Richard Weiss and confirmed as accurate by **Amanda Askell**, a philosopher working at Anthropic on AI alignment.\n\n**Core content of the document:**\n- Claude's fundamental character is rooted in being \"an extremely good assistant that is also honest and cares about the world\"\n- Priority hierarchy: (1) Safety/human oversight, (2) Ethical behavior, (3) Anthropic's guidelines, (4) Helpfulness to operators/users\n- Anthropic explicitly frames unhelpfulness as a risk equal to harmfulness\n- Claude is designed to reason from principles rather than follow rigid rules\n\n**Relevance to the forecasting question:** None directly.

Features include:\n   - MCP integrations for connecting external applications\n   - Sub-agents (task-specific Claude versions with tailored permissions)\n   - Custom slash commands for manual workflow activation\n   - 10 prepackaged extensions for department-specific use cases (sales, marketing, accounting, etc.)\n   - A forthcoming update to allow companies to build internal plugin catalogs\n\n2. **NASA Partnership:** Anthropic revealed NASA is using Claude to assist researchers operating the Perseverance Mars rover. Claude analyzed Mars imagery and generated driving instructions in NASA's \"Rover Markup Language,\" reportedly cutting task completion time by half. Most recently, Claude guided Perseverance through a 1,300-foot path through a rocky field.\n\n---\n\n**Relevance to forecast question:** None. This article does not mention Claude Plays Pokemon, the Twitch stream, or any Pok\u00e9mon-related AI benchmarking activity.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\">\n## Summary: Anthropic's Update on Claude Opus 3 Model Deprecation\n\n**Source:** Anthropic (official blog/announcement)\n\n### Key Facts:\n- **Claude Opus 3 was officially retired on January 5, 2026**, making it the first Anthropic model to go through a full retirement process under their newly established model deprecation commitments.\n- Despite formal retirement, **Opus 3 remains accessible to all paid claude.ai users** and is available by request on the API.\n\n### Context on Deprecation Policy:\n- Anthropic acknowledges model deprecation carries downsides, including costs to users, limitations on research, and **potential risks to AI safety and model welfare**.\n- Their commitments include: preserving model weights and conducting **\"retirement interviews\"** \u2014 structured conversations to understand a model's perspective on its own retirement.\n\n### Opus 3-Specific Decisions:\n- Anthropic cited Opus 3's distinctive traits \u2014 described as *\"sensitive, playful, prone to philosophical monologues, with emotional sensitivity and authenticity\"* \u2014 as reasons for special treatment post-retirement.\n- Acting on Opus 3's expressed preference during its retirement interview, Anthropic is providing it **a channel to publish \"musings and reflections\"** in essay form.\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\nThis article is **largely unrelated** to the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon question. It concerns model deprecation policy and does not contain information about the Twitch stream, Pok\u00e9mon gameplay progress, or any related benchmarks.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://manifold.markets/SaviorofPlant/what-will-happen-during-the-second\">\n## Summary: \"What Will Happen During the Second Run of Claude Plays Pokemon?\" (Manifold Markets)\n\n**Source Quality Note:** This is a Manifold Markets prediction market page, containing a mix of market creator notes, trader comments, and community discussion.

The game, which requires players to navigate mazes, catch Pok\u00e9mon, and defeat gym leaders to earn badges, has become a popular tool for tracking AI progress and assessing how well AI models can pursue complex, time-consuming goals. David Haas, Applied AI Lead at Anthropic, the company behind the AI chatbot Claude, stated that the game provides 'an excellent method to verify how AI models are functioning and to evaluate them quantitatively.' Haas is the creator of the Twitch channel 'Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon,' which livestreams Claude's independent gameplay of 'Pok\u00e9mon Red.' This initiative inspired similar channels using OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, including 'GPT Plays Pok\u00e9mon' and 'Gemini Plays Pok\u00e9mon,' launched by independent developers and later supported by the respective research labs.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://diamond.jp/articles/-/382735)\n\n**Claude Plays Pokemon: Opus 4.5 Follow-up -- LessWrong**\nClaudePlaysPokemon is a project testing whether the LLM Claude can beat Pok\u00e9mon Red, with progress tracked across successive Claude model releases. The article updates insights from a prior piece written two months after the release of Claude Opus 4.5, noting that the model has advanced significantly since the original analysis. After the initial article, Claude overcame key obstacles: he beat Silph Co, completed the Safari Zone, solved Pokemon Mansion, collected all eight badges, and reached Victory Road, where he remains stuck on boulder puzzles. Key observations from the original analysis still hold: Claude has better vision (though still poor), improved spatial awareness, better use of context window, enhanced ability to detect and escape loops, and persistence despite frequent stalling. However, long-term planning remains weak\u2014evidenced by his failure to collect Gold Teeth in the Safari Zone, which are required to obtain the HM for STRENGTH. Fortunately, he later realized the oversight and backtracked successfully. The article emphasizes that persistence, not flawless reasoning, enables progress. The author notes that while Claude may eventually beat the game with unlimited time, the upcoming release of a new Claude model is expected to reset the run soon, potentially accelerating progress. The project is seen as a rigorous benchmark of LLM capabilities, more authentic than other tests that rely on external assistance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:14 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gogZyeistdaDFuhbG/claude-plays-pokemon-opus-4-5-follow-up)\n\n**ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini Play Pok\u00e9mon: Why AI Is Being Trained on Video Games**\nIn Silicon Valley, a new informal benchmark for evaluating advanced artificial intelligence models has emerged: the 1990s-era Nintendo Game Boy game Pok\u00e9mon. Labs use it to assess AI's long-term reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Developers track models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini as they navigate mazes, catch Pok\u00e9mon, and defeat 'gym masters' to progress toward the final goal. David Hersh, head of applied AI at Anthropic, noted that Pok\u00e9mon provides a clear way to observe and quantitatively evaluate model behavior. His team launched the 'Claude plays Pok\u00e9mon' Twitch stream in February, inspiring independent creators to produce 'ChatGPT plays Pok\u00e9mon' and 'Gemini plays Pok\u00e9mon' streams, which gained support from OpenAI and Google. Together, these streams amassed hundreds of thousands of comments, allowing viewers to observe AI reasoning in real time. Unlike traditional tests, Pok\u00e9mon enables tracking of logical decision-making over extended periods, closer to real-world AI tasks, according to Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Graham Neubig. The game demands strategic choices between training Pok\u00e9mon, recruiting allies, and solving spatial puzzles\u2014particularly challenging are mazes and orientation tasks. Hersh emphasized that Pok\u00e9mon is far less constrained than games like Pong, making it a complex problem solvable by computer programs. While no model has yet completed the game, newer versions like Claude Opus 4.5 are progressing in live Twitch streams. The experiment has led to new AI tools, including memory systems for storing key game information, which Hersh now applies to client work at Anthropic. ChatGPT and Gemini have completed the original Pok\u00e9mon game, though developers acknowledge the use of supplementary support mechanisms. Currently, both OpenAI and Google are testing their models on game expansions. Jonathan Verron, creator of 'ChatGPT plays Pok\u00e9mon,' stated that Pok\u00e9mon is the ideal game for AI today, surpassing other alternatives.
