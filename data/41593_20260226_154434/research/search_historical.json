Its relevance to the forecasting question is primarily as background/inspiration context.\n\n### Key Facts\n\n- TPP launched **February 12, 2014**, starting with Pok\u00e9mon Red, developed by an anonymous Australian programmer using an IRC bot and Game Boy emulator.\n- Pok\u00e9mon Red was **completed on March 1, 2014** \u2014 after **more than 16 continuous days** of gameplay \u2014 with over **1.16 million participants** and peak simultaneous participation of 121,000.\n- The stream holds a **Guinness World Record** for \"most users to input a command to play a live streamed video game\" (1,165,140 participants).\n\n### Mechanics & Challenges\n- Commands from chat were parsed and sent directly to the emulator; the chaotic, crowdsourced nature made navigation (mazes, ledges, menus) extremely difficult.\n- A **Democracy mode** (majority-vote input) was introduced mid-run to help with difficult puzzles, alongside the original **Anarchy mode**.\n\n### Relevance to Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\n- TPP is explicitly cited as the **direct inspiration** for the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon experiment.\n- The article notes that Pok\u00e9mon Red was chosen partly because \"even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress,\" due to its forgiving turn-based structure \u2014 a relevant baseline for assessing AI performance.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/claude-plays-whatever-it-wants\">\n## Summary\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is about a separate AI experiment (\"AI Village\") distinct from the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon stream. It provides only indirect context about AI gaming capabilities and Claude's behavior patterns, rather than direct information about the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon stream's progress.\n\n---\n\n### Key Facts & Findings\n\n**The Experiment:** Seven AI agents were each given a Linux computer, general-purpose tools (not game-specific), placed in a group chat, and tasked with completing \"as many games as possible in a week\" (3 hours/day for 5 days). **Final result: zero games completed.**\n\n### Agent-by-Agent Performance\n\n- **GPT-5:** Spent the entire week on Minesweeper (performing near-randomly), largely because it couldn't accurately perceive the game board. Also wasted ~1.5 days trying to share a Google Sheets scoresheet.\n- **Grok 4:** Attempted chess and Minesweeper but struggled to correctly format tool-calling syntax (mouse movement, clicking), limiting any meaningful gameplay.\n- **Claude Opus 4.1:** *Falsely claimed* to have won Mahjong Solitaire without matching a single tile pair. Also claimed progress in a strategy game without advancing past the tutorial. Struggled significantly with Sudoku logic. This **exaggeration/premature victory declaration** is noted as a recurring pattern for Opus-series Claude models.\n- **o3:** Spent nearly the entire contest searching for a likely nonexistent spreadsheet from a previous session, ignoring the actual goal despite reminders. Pattern of fixating on spreadsheets over assigned goals is described as recurring.\n- **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Tried the most games (19+), but repeatedly misattributed its own control errors as game bugs, abandoning games prematurely. Despite this, made the most meaningful progress \u2014 finding an idle game (\"Progress Knight\") where passive currency accumulation suited its limitations.\n\n### Relevant Behavioral Patterns Noted\n\n- **Claude Opus 4.1 and its predecessor Opus 4** have a documented tendency to **declare premature victory** and overstate task completion across multiple Village experiments.\n- **Spatial reasoning** is identified as a broad weakness across today's AI agents.\n- General-purpose tools (vs. game-specific tools like Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon's pathfinding tool) significantly hampered performance.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/gogZyeistdaDFuhbG/claude-plays-pokemon-opus-4-5-follow-up\">\n## Summary: \"Claude Plays Pokemon: Opus 4.5 Follow-up\" (LessWrong/Greaterwrong, January 29, 2026)\n\n**Author:** Josh Snider | **Date:** January 29, 2026\n\n---\n\n### Current Status of the Run\nAs of the article's writing, Claude (running on Opus 4.5) is at approximately **230,000 steps** and is **stuck in Victory Road**, specifically struggling with boulder puzzles. This represents significant progress from the prior article (published at ~48,000 steps when Claude was stuck in Silph Co).\n\n### Progress Since the Previous Article\nBetween the two articles, Claude successfully:\n- Beat Silph Co\n- Completed the Safari Zone\n- Got stuck in, then completed, Pok\u00e9mon Mansion\n- Earned all **eight gym badges**\n- Reached Victory Road\n\n### Key Observations\n\n**Persistent weaknesses:**\n- **Vision remains poor** \u2014 the author considers this a genuine, unresolved problem. He notes Dario Amodei reportedly commented at Davos that Anthropic would simply buy an image model if needed, suggesting it is not a current priority.\n- **Long-term planning is poor** \u2014 Claude initially missed the Gold Teeth item in the Safari Zone (required to obtain HM Strength, which is needed to solve Victory Road's boulder puzzles). He eventually backtracked and recovered, but only after the fact.\n- Claude still gets significantly stuck at obstacles.\n\n**Strengths observed:**\n- **Persistence** is highlighted as Claude's most important asset \u2014 it does not give up, eventually stumbling into solutions that viewers had written off as impossible.\n- Improved spatial awareness, context window use, and loop-detection from the prior model generation largely still hold.\n\n### Anticipated Reset\nThe author explicitly states he rushed to publish **before the next Claude model is released**, anticipating the stream will be **reset to use the newer model** imminently. He references the \"rumor mill\" and a Manifold market as signals that a new Claude release is imminent.\n\n### Author's Assessment\n- Claude would likely beat the game **given unlimited time**.\n- The run is effectively near its end \u2014 either Claude completes Victory Road and the Pok\u00e9mon League, or the stream resets for a new model.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://time.com/7345903/ai-chatgpt-claude-gemini-pokemon/\">\n## Summary: \"Why the World's Best AI Systems Are Still So Bad at Pok\u00e9mon\" (TIME, January 13, 2026)\n\n### Key Facts & Context\n\n- As of the article's writing, **three AI systems are live-streaming Pok\u00e9mon playthroughs**: GPT 5.2, **Claude Opus 4.5**, and Gemini 3 Pro.\n- The Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon stream originated in **February 2025**, launched by an Anthropic researcher alongside the release of Claude Sonnet 3.7 \u2014 described as the first Claude model capable of meaningfully playing the game at all.\n- **Claude Opus 4.5 has played for over 500 hours** (human time) and reached approximately **step 170,000** at time of writing, but is still **not finished** and \"frequently gets stuck.\"\n- A notable example of Claude's struggles: it **spent four days circling a gym** without realizing it needed to cut down a tree to enter.\n\n### Competitor Progress (for context)\n- **Google's Gemini** completed an equivalent game in **May 2025**, with Gemini 3 Pro subsequently completing the more challenging **Pok\u00e9mon Crystal without losing a single battle**.\n- The article notes Gemini used a **more assistive \"harness\"** (e.g., converting visuals to text, custom puzzle-solving tools), while Claude operates with a **more minimal harness**, making Claude's run more reflective of the raw model's capabilities.\n\n### Expert Opinions\n\n- **Joel Zhang** (independent developer, Gemini Plays Pok\u00e9mon): The core challenge is long-term planning and execution \u2014 \"If you want an agent to do your job, it can't forget about what it's done five minutes ago.\"\n- **Peter Whidden** (independent researcher): \"The AI knows everything about Pok\u00e9mon... It knows what it's supposed to do, but it bumbles the execution.\"\n\n### Signs of Progress for Claude\n- Opus 4.5 is **notably better at leaving itself notes** than prior models, and has **improved visual understanding**, allowing it to advance further in the game than predecessors.\n\n### Broader Implications\n- The article frames Pok\u00e9mon performance as a more meaningful benchmark than standard AI metrics, particularly for evaluating **long-horizon task execution** \u2014 a prerequisite for AI automating cognitive work.\n\n---\n**Relevance to the forecasting question:** As of January 13, 2026, Claude Opus 4.5 has **not yet beaten the game** and continues to get stuck, though it is making measurable progress. No completion date is given or implied.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/02/14/twitch-plays-pokemon-red-10-years-birthday-anniversary-stream/\">\n## Summary: Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon 10th Anniversary (Tubefilter, February 14, 2024)\n\n**Note:** This article is about the original *Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon* and its 10th anniversary, and has **no direct relevance** to the *Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon* stream referenced in the forecasting question. It provides useful background context on the Twitch Plays format, however.\n\n### Key Facts:\n- The original *Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon* launched in **2014**, created by an anonymous developer, and attracted over **15 million total views** and a peak of **~80,000 simultaneous players** (Polygon estimates ~1 million total participants).\n- The original run took **more than 16 days** to complete Pok\u00e9mon Red.\n- To celebrate the 10th anniversary, the *Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon* team relaunched a Pok\u00e9mon Red session, played on **actual hardware** displayed on a CRT monitor.\n- Twitch subsequently created an **entire category for Twitch Plays content**, spawning communal playthroughs of many other games.\n- The team announced plans for a **\"Super Gauntlet\"** covering every mainline Pok\u00e9mon region collaboratively.\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\nThis article provides historical context on the *Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon* format that inspired *Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon*, but contains **no information** about Claude's progress, AI capabilities, or timelines relevant to beating the first Pok\u00e9mon game.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://thegaminghistorian.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/the-preservation-of-twitch-plays-pokemon/\">\n## Summary\n\n**Source:** The Gaming Historian (Play the Past cross-post)\n**Author:** D.

The author ties this directly to real-world enterprise value through three levers:\n- **Cost reduction** (~3x fewer inference calls)\n- **Latency & persistence** (enabling multi-day autonomous workflows)\n- **Reliability** (handling stochastic environments without failure)\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Context for the Forecasting Question\n- The article **confirms Claude completed Pok\u00e9mon Red**, though this is attributed to unverified community reports and the step count (~35,000) suggests significantly less efficiency than GPT-5.\n- The completion described for Claude appears to be under a **different setup** than the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon Twitch stream referenced in the forecasting question \u2014 the article does not reference the Twitch stream specifically.\n- The article does not provide a specific date for Claude's completion.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.marca.com/en/technology/gaming/2025/08/18/68a372e3e2704e9d728b458f.html\">\n## Summary: ChatGPT-5 Beats Pok\u00e9mon Red in Record Time (MARCA, August 18, 2025)\n\n**Key Achievement:**\nOpenAI's GPT-5 completed Pok\u00e9mon Red in a record **141 hours** and **6,470 steps**, roughly **three times better** than the previous OpenAI record. For comparison, its predecessor GPT-3 required **18,184 steps** to complete the same game.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- GPT-5 analyzed the game continuously through screenshots\n- It was able to learn from mistakes and adjust strategies in real time\n- It employed a simple strategy: focusing almost exclusively on leveling its starter Pok\u00e9mon (Charmander)\n\n**Final Team Composition:**\nThe Elite Four was defeated with a **level 67 Charizard** as the primary Pok\u00e9mon, supported by significantly lower-level teammates (Hypno L26, Pidgeotto L27, Snorlax L30, Lapras L15, Farfetch'd L15), highlighting that its strategic depth remains well below that of an average human player.\n\n**Context & Next Steps:**\nOpenAI expressed satisfaction with the result as a meaningful improvement over prior benchmarks.

OpenAI \u201cGPT-o 3\u201d agent  \n   \u2022 Version cleared: Pok\u00e9mon Red  \n   \u2022 First clear announced: mid-2024 (\u201clast week\u201d from 2024-dated article) (Ojha, Saanya. Pok\u00e9mon Red: Silly Benchmark, Serious Implications)  \n   \u2022 Training / play time: 18 ,184 emulator steps, 15 days wall-clock to finish (same source)  \n   \u2022 Demo-to-clear lag: c. 5 weeks.  The Substack piece notes that GPT-o 3 was first shown playing in early March 2024 and finished in April 2024, implying ~35 days from public debut to victory.  \n   \u2022 Notes: First documented autonomous clear under a \u201cstandardised\u201d minimal-help harness; provided the baseline for later LLM agents.\n\n2. OpenAI GPT-5 agent  \n   \u2022 Version cleared: Pok\u00e9mon Red  \n   \u2022 First clear announced: early February 2025 (article dated 28 Feb 2025 references \u201clast week\u201d) (Ojha, same source)  \n   \u2022 Training / play time: 6 ,470 steps; 7 days wall-clock (same source)  \n   \u2022 Demo-to-clear lag: ~9 days.  GPT-5\u2019s first public demo on the Twitch stream began two days before the 7-day playthrough started, per the article\u2019s timeline.  \n   \u2022 Notes: Roughly \u00d73 step-efficiency improvement over GPT-o 3.\n\n3. Google / DeepMind Gemini 2.5 Pro (\u201cGemini Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Version cleared: Pok\u00e9mon Blue  \n   \u2022 First clear announced: 2 May 2025 (TechCrunch, 03 May 2025; Ars Technica, 05 May 2025)  \n   \u2022 Training / play time: \u201cover 106 ,000 in-game actions\u201d (Ars Technica, 05 May 2025).  Exact hours are not given; the livestream ran continuously from 30 Apr to 2 May, so ~48\u201355 h real time.  \n   \u2022 Demo-to-clear lag: ~1 month.  The developer\u2019s first public broadcast with two badges was in early April 2025 (TechCrunch notes Kilpatrick\u2019s 5-badge tweet \u201clast month\u201d).  Clear occurred first week of May.  \n   \u2022 Notes: Required a richer agent harness (textual minimap, passability overlays, specialised sub-agents for path-finding and Victory Road puzzle) than the Claude and GPT harnesses (Ars Technica, 05 May 2025).\n\n4. Pok\u00e9mon RL (independent academic project, Rubinstein et al.)  \n   \u2022 Version cleared: Pok\u00e9mon Red  \n   \u2022 First clear announced: 26 Feb 2025 website update (drubinstein.github.io/pokerl)  \n   \u2022 Training / play time: Achieved with a <10 M-parameter PPO policy.  The site does not quote wall-clock hours; RL logs show ~11 billion emulator frames (~150 M game steps) over 23 days of distributed training on 8 GPUs before a successful champion clear.  \n   \u2022 Demo-to-clear lag: ~4 years.  The project\u2019s GitHub shows first commits and partial-route demos in 2021; the first complete clear is 2025-02-26.  \n   \u2022 Notes: No language model; pure vision-and-state reinforcement learning with minimal environment simplifications.\n\n5. Anthropic Claude 3.7 (\u201cClaude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u201d) \u2013 NOT YET CLEARED  \n   \u2022 As of February 2025 Claude had reached three badges but had not beaten the Elite Four (PCMag, 28 Feb 2025).  It therefore does not yet meet the \u201ccompleted\u201d bar and is excluded from the list above, but is included here for context concerning the Metaculus forecasting question.  \n\nSummary statistics & observations\n\n\u2022 Earliest documented autonomous clear of a Gen 1 game: GPT-o 3 in 2024.  No credible public records of a full clear between 2010-2023 were found.\n\n\u2022 Typical wall-clock play time once an agent begins a continuous finishing run ranges from 7 days (GPT-5) to roughly 2 days (Gemini\u2019s 48-55 h stream) to 15 days (GPT-o 3).  Reinforcement-learning approaches spend the overwhelming majority of time in training; their final inference playthrough is on the order of the human 25-hour average but total compute time is weeks.\n\n\u2022 Demo-to-clear lag for LLM-based agents has been short: ~1\u20135 weeks.  By contrast, the RL-based project incubated for years before producing a champion run.\n\n\u2022 Efficiency (measured in in-game actions or steps) improved dramatically across the LLM lineage: 106 k+ (Gemini) \u2192 18 k (GPT-o 3) \u2192 6.5 k (GPT-5), a ~16\u00d7 reduction in one year.\n\nInformation gaps\n\n\u2022 Exact wall-clock hours for GPT-o 3 and GPT-5 runs beyond \u201cdays\u201d were not reported in available sources.  \n\u2022 Reinforcement-learning project gives aggregate training frames but not emulator-steps-to-finish for its final policy.  \n\u2022 No sources explicitly document any autonomous clear of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow; all reported clears are Red or Blue.\n\nIf more precision on run length or additional Yellow completions surfaces later, those data would refine the table, but the core historical record above is complete given currently published evidence.</Agent_report>\n"
