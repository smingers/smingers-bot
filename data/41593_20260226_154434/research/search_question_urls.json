Its relevance to the forecasting question is primarily as background/inspiration context.\n\n### Key Facts\n\n- TPP launched **February 12, 2014**, starting with Pok\u00e9mon Red, developed by an anonymous Australian programmer using an IRC bot and Game Boy emulator.\n- Pok\u00e9mon Red was **completed on March 1, 2014** \u2014 after **more than 16 continuous days** of gameplay \u2014 with over **1.16 million participants** and peak simultaneous participation of 121,000.\n- The stream holds a **Guinness World Record** for \"most users to input a command to play a live streamed video game\" (1,165,140 participants).\n\n### Mechanics & Challenges\n- Commands from chat were parsed and sent directly to the emulator; the chaotic, crowdsourced nature made navigation (mazes, ledges, menus) extremely difficult.\n- A **Democracy mode** (majority-vote input) was introduced mid-run to help with difficult puzzles, alongside the original **Anarchy mode**.\n\n### Relevance to Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\n- TPP is explicitly cited as the **direct inspiration** for the Claude Plays Pok\u00e9mon experiment.\n- The article notes that Pok\u00e9mon Red was chosen partly because \"even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress,\" due to its forgiving turn-based structure \u2014 a relevant baseline for assessing AI performance.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
