  "plan_analysis": "The forecaster\u2019s job is to estimate the (calendar-date) moment when the Twitch channel \u201cClaude Plays Pokemon\u201d finally defeats Champion Blue.  \nWhat we already know: only the 2014 Twitch Plays Pokemon precedent and a short note that Claude improved a lot during 2025.  \nKey missing pieces:\n\n1. Current state (Feb 2026): How far is the run right now? frequency of streams, last gym defeated, any Elite Four attempts, any recent soft-locks, hiatuses, or re-starts.  \n2. Resolution mechanism details: Where will completion be announced first\u2014stream title, organiser tweet, Discord, GitHub bot?  \n3. Base rates / reference classes:  \n   \u2022 How long did Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon and other crowd/AI runs typically take from \u201cnew game\u201d to champion?  \n   \u2022 Historical examples of *autonomous* AI agents beating Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue and the time they needed after reaching \u201cnear-finish\u201d.  \n4. Key drivers:  \n   \u2022 Anthropic model upgrades (Claude-4, tool-use, 200k context, etc.) and any explicit plans for the Pok\u00e9mon project.  \n   \u2022 Developer activity (GitHub, Discord) that may accelerate or stall the run (e.g., smarter action-selection code, save-state safeguards).  \n5. Contrarian indicators: stream hiatus, technical/DMCA takedown, change of focus, or organiser abandoning the challenge.\n\nThe search strategy therefore splits into:\nA. Historical queries (\u224860 %) to establish completion times for prior runs and agents as a baseline and to gauge developer velocity.  \nB. Current-state queries (\u224840 %) to capture the latest progress, upcoming Claude upgrades, and any negative surprises that could delay victory.",
