# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The available information is quite limited, with no recent, credible sources on the specific question of whether the US will attack Iran before April 2026. The search queries cover relevant topics, but do not provide direct evidence for this particular scenario. The base rate, while not extremely recent, is based on historical precedent and seems a reasonable starting point.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence:** None
**MODERATE Evidence:** None
**WEAK Evidence:** 
- Recent news reports indicate ongoing tensions between the US and Iran, with both sides engaging in provocative actions. However, this does not necessarily mean an attack is imminent.
- Some experts have speculated about the possibility of a US-Iran conflict, but their predictions are highly uncertain and not based on clear causal mechanisms.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

The available weak evidence suggests a slightly elevated risk of a US attack on Iran, but not enough to significantly update the base rate. The tensions between the two countries are an ongoing concern, but a full-scale military attack before April 2026 still seems unlikely based on the information available.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 30.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the elevated geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, which increase the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation.
- Adjustment 2: -3% to account for the lack of strong, direct evidence pointing to a US attack in the near future.
- Cumulative adjustment: +2%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be very low (<10%) or very high (>90%), it would require a dramatic shift in the geopolitical landscape, such as a major breakthrough in US-Iran negotiations or a significant provocation leading to war. The current evidence does not suggest such a drastic change is likely.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 2% adjustment from the base rate is relatively small, which is appropriate given the limited new information available.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the weak evidence leading to a modest adjustment.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final estimate of 32% does not represent an extreme prediction, so regression to the mean is not a major concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, I have focused on the current state of US-Iran relations, the incentives and actions of the key actors, and recent developments that could impact the probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026.

The base rate of 30% is a reasonable starting point, based on historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East and attacks on sovereign nations. However, the current evidence suggests a slightly elevated risk of such an event occurring.

While there are ongoing tensions and the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation, the available information does not point to a clear, imminent threat of a US attack. Experts have speculated about the possibility, but their predictions are highly uncertain and not grounded in strong causal mechanisms.

Overall, the evidence points to a modest increase in the probability, but the likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 remains relatively low. The geopolitical situation is fluid, and significant developments could change the calculus, but based on the current information, a 32% probability seems like a reasonable estimate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: SLIGHTLY UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 30.0%
- Total adjustment: +2%
- Final estimate: 32%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 6/10

**Probability: 32%**
