# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Resolution Criteria


## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 30.0%
**Reference Classes Used:** US Military Interventions in the Middle East, US Military Attacks on Sovereign Nations, US Military Conflicts Initiated Before April (weight 8: 40%, weight 7: 25%)
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 7/10

## Search Queries
1. "US military history Iran attack"
2. "Recent US-Iran tensions news"
3. "Experts predict US Iran conflict"

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The search queries did not return any relevant information, so I do not have any new evidence to evaluate. The base rate appears to be based on historical precedents, but it is unclear how recent or comprehensive the reference classes are. There could be potential biases in the reporting or selection of reference classes.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

Without any new evidence, I cannot classify any pieces of information.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

Without any new evidence, I cannot determine the direction or magnitude of any updates to the base rate.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 30.0%:
- No adjustments can be made due to lack of evidence.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** 0%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The base rate of 30.0% does not seem overly extreme, so there is no need to consider what would have to be true for a very low or high prediction to be correct.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate appears to be reasonably grounded in historical precedent, so a large deviation from 30.0% would require strong justification.

3. **Update magnitude:** No updates can be made due to lack of evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** No updates can be made, so regression to the mean is not a concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I would typically look for reasons the consensus might be wrong or what people could be overlooking. However, without any new evidence to evaluate, I do not have a strong basis to challenge the base rate.

The base rate of 30.0% seems reasonably grounded in historical precedent, but the reference classes used and their weighting are not entirely clear. It is possible that there are other relevant factors or recent developments that are not captured in the base rate.

Overall, I do not have a strong case to adjust the base rate up or down, as I lack the necessary evidence to do so. I would recommend keeping the base rate at 30.0% and continuing to monitor the situation for any new information that could warrant a reevaluation.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 30.0%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 30.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 30.0%**
