# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: historian
You are a historian and superforecaster. Focus on historical precedents, analogous situations, and patterns from the past. Consider how often similar situations have resolved in various ways. Use history to inform your probability estimate.

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be resolved as "Yes" if the United States military conducts an attack on Iranian territory or military forces before April 1, 2026. The question will be resolved as "No" if no such attack occurs by that date.

## Base Rate from Outside View
**Starting Point:** 30.0%
**Reference Classes Used:** US Military Interventions in the Middle East, US Military Attacks on Sovereign Nations, US Military Conflicts Initiated Before April (weight 8: 40%, weight 7: 25%)
**Confidence in Base Rate:** 7/10

## Search Queries
1. "US military history Iran attack"
2. "Recent US-Iran tensions news"
3. "Experts predict US Iran conflict"

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The search queries did not yield any relevant, high-quality sources that would significantly update the base rate. The information is likely already priced into the 30.0% base rate, as it reflects general historical patterns of US military interventions in the Middle East and attacks on sovereign nations. There are no recent, credible reports of imminent US plans to attack Iran before April 2026.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
No new evidence was found that would be classified as strong, moderate, or weak.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
No new evidence was found, so no updates to the base rate are warranted.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from 30.0%, there are no adjustments to be made.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** A 30.0% probability is not an extreme estimate, so there is no need to consider what would have to be true for me to be wrong.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 30.0% is well-justified based on the historical reference classes used.

3. **Update magnitude:** No updates are being made, so this check is not applicable.

4. **Regression to mean:** The base rate is not an extreme prediction, so regression to the mean is not a concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I do not have any significant new evidence to adjust the base rate of 30.0%. The historical precedents of US military interventions in the Middle East and attacks on sovereign nations suggest a moderate probability of the US attacking Iran before April 2026. However, without any recent, credible reports of imminent US plans to do so, I do not have a strong basis to deviate from the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 30.0%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 30.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 30.0%**
