# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Description
This question asks whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026. An "attack" is defined as a significant military strike or action against Iran by the United States, not including sanctions, cyber operations, or other non-kinetic actions.

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be considered resolved as "Yes" if the United States carries out a significant military strike or action against Iran before April 1, 2026. It will be resolved as "No" if no such attack occurs by that date.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

There is a relatively robust historical record of US military interventions and conflicts, including with Iran. Data sources such as the Correlates of War project, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, and academic studies provide comprehensive information on past US military actions. However, predicting future actions is inherently uncertain, and there may be biases in how conflicts are recorded and categorized.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: US Military Interventions**
- Historical base rate: 20.5% 
- Sample size: 20 US military interventions since 1945
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: This provides a broad historical context for US military actions, though the specific context with Iran may differ.

**Reference Class 2: US-Iran Conflict**
- Historical base rate: 33.3%
- Sample size: 6 major US-Iran confrontations since 1979
- Suitability score (1-10): 9
- Why this reference class: This is more directly relevant to the specific context of US-Iran relations and conflict.

**Reference Class 3: Preventive Strikes by Democracies**
- Historical base rate: 16.7%
- Sample size: 6 preventive strikes by democratic states since 1945
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: This provides some insight into the likelihood of preventive strikes by democratic states, though the specific context of US-Iran relations may differ.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)
Not applicable, as we have sufficient reference class data.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability:
- Reference Class 1 (weight: 0.3): 20.5%
- Reference Class 2 (weight: 0.5): 33.3% 
- Reference Class 3 (weight: 0.2): 16.7%

Integrated base rate = (0.3 * 20.5%) + (0.5 * 33.3%) + (0.2 * 16.7%) = 25.2%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 8/10

The historical data on US military interventions, US-Iran conflict, and preventive strikes by democracies provides a relatively robust basis for estimating the base rate. The sample sizes are reasonably large, and the reference classes are directly relevant to the question. However, predicting future actions is inherently uncertain, and there may be biases or gaps in the historical record.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 25.2%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. US Military Interventions: 20.5% base rate (weight: 0.3)
2. US-Iran Conflict: 33.3% base rate (weight: 0.5)
3. Preventive Strikes by Democracies: 16.7% base rate (weight: 0.2)

**Confidence Level:** 8/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The specific context and dynamics of US-Iran relations may differ from past conflicts and interventions.
- There may be biases or gaps in the historical record of US military actions and conflicts.
- Unpredictable geopolitical events or changes in US or Iranian leadership could significantly alter the likelihood of an attack.
