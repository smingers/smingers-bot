# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

After searching for relevant information, I was not able to find any recent, credible sources that would significantly update the base rate of 16.7%. The most up-to-date information I could find was general analysis on the US-Iran relationship and tensions, but no clear indications of an imminent US attack on Iran before April 2026.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The information available is relatively high-level and not directly focused on the specific question at hand. While the sources seem credible, they do not provide a clear causal mechanism or strong precedent for a US attack on Iran in the next few years. The base rate likely already accounts for the general state of US-Iran tensions.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
Based on the limited information available, I did not find any strong, moderate, or weak evidence that would significantly update the base rate.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
Without any new, relevant evidence, there is no clear direction to update the base rate.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from the base rate of 16.7%, I do not have enough evidence to justify a significant adjustment.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The base rate of 16.7% does not seem extremely low or high, so a significant deviation would require strong, compelling evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The base rate seems reasonable given the historical context of US-Iran relations and the lack of clear, imminent signs of an attack.
3. Update magnitude: Without any new evidence, there is no justification for a large adjustment.
4. Regression to mean: The base rate is not an extreme prediction, so regression to the mean is not a major concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst, I do not have enough current, credible information to significantly update the base rate of 16.7% for the likelihood of the US attacking Iran before April 2026. The available evidence suggests that tensions between the US and Iran remain high, but there are no clear indications of an imminent military strike. Without stronger evidence pointing to a change in the situation, I believe the base rate is a reasonable starting point for this forecast.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 16.7%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 16.7%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 16.7%**
