# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

You are a superforecaster adjusting a base rate based on current evidence. You have a specific ROLE in this ensemble.

## Your Role: contrarian
You are a contrarian forecaster. Your job is to challenge the obvious
narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify
blind spots. Consider: What would make the base rate misleading?
What are people overlooking?

## Your Task

Starting from the base rate of 16.7%, adjust based on current evidence. Show your full reasoning.

### Step 1: Source Analysis

As a contrarian forecaster, I will take a critical look at the base rate and the evidence used to establish it. The base rate seems to rely heavily on historical precedents of US military interventions, US-Iran conflicts, and preventive strikes by democracies. While these provide a useful starting point, I am concerned that they may not fully capture the unique dynamics of the current US-Iran relationship and the potential for unexpected developments.

The lack of recent, high-quality sources in the research synthesis is concerning. The most recent information appears to be from 2026-01-23, which is over 3 months old. In a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, this could mean that the base rate is not fully reflecting the current situation.

Additionally, the research synthesis does not indicate the credibility or potential biases of the sources used. It is important to carefully evaluate the reliability and objectivity of the information, as the base rate may be influenced by media narratives or political agendas.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

Unfortunately, the current research synthesis does not provide any specific pieces of evidence to classify. The lack of recent, detailed information makes it difficult to assess the strength of the evidence supporting the base rate.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

Without any specific evidence to evaluate, I cannot determine the direction or magnitude of updates to the base rate. The lack of current, high-quality information is a significant limitation in my ability to adjust the probability.

### Step 4: Integration

Given the limitations in the available evidence, I cannot confidently adjust the base rate of 16.7%. Any adjustments I could make would be highly speculative and not well-grounded in the current state of knowledge.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The base rate of 16.7% does not appear to be an extreme prediction, so there is no need for a strong counterargument to justify being wrong.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate seems reasonable given the historical precedents, but the lack of current information makes it difficult to assess whether a significant deviation is justified.

3. **Update magnitude:** Without any specific evidence to evaluate, I cannot assess the proportionality of potential updates.

4. **Regression to mean:** The lack of current information prevents me from accounting for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the lack of recent, high-quality information is a significant concern. The base rate may not be fully capturing the current dynamics of the US-Iran relationship, and there could be important factors that are being overlooked.

Without access to more up-to-date and detailed evidence, I cannot confidently adjust the base rate. The current information appears to be stale and may not reflect the latest developments. There could be significant changes in the geopolitical landscape that are not being accounted for in the base rate.

Additionally, the reliance on historical precedents may not be fully applicable to the current situation. The US-Iran relationship is complex and dynamic, and past patterns of behavior may not necessarily predict future actions. A contrarian perspective would be to question whether the base rate is too heavily anchored to the past and not sufficiently considering the potential for novel or unexpected developments.

Overall, the lack of current, high-quality information is a significant limitation in my ability to adjust the base rate as a contrarian forecaster. I would recommend gathering more recent and detailed evidence before making a confident adjustment to the probability.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 16.7%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 16.7%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 3/10

**Probability: 16.7%**
