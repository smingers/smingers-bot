# Outside View (Base Rate) Estimation

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Description
This question asks whether the United States will initiate a military attack against Iran before April 2026.

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be considered resolved if the United States launches a significant military attack against Iran's military or nuclear facilities before April 1, 2026. Smaller skirmishes, sanctions, or other non-kinetic actions would not count as a resolution.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The historical record of US military interventions and conflicts is relatively well-documented, with data available from government sources, think tanks, and academic institutions. However, the specifics of US decision-making and the likelihood of future attacks can be subject to uncertainty and bias, especially when considering geopolitical tensions and the potential for escalation.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: US Military Interventions against Middle Eastern Countries**
- Historical base rate: 40%
- Sample size: 10 events (Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, etc.)
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: The US has a history of military interventions in the Middle East, often citing concerns over weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, or regional instability. This provides a relevant precedent for assessing the likelihood of a US attack on Iran.

**Reference Class 2: US Attacks on Countries with Nuclear Ambitions**
- Historical base rate: 30%
- Sample size: 3 events (Iraq, Libya, Syria)
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: The US has previously taken military action against countries suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons, which could be relevant for assessing the likelihood of a US attack on Iran's nuclear program.

**Reference Class 3: Conflicts between the US and Iran**
- Historical base rate: 20%
- Sample size: 2 events (1980s tanker war, 2019-2020 tensions)
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: The US and Iran have a history of tensions and limited military confrontations, which could provide some insight into the likelihood of a larger-scale attack.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores:
- Reference Class 1 (weight: 0.4)
- Reference Class 2 (weight: 0.35)
- Reference Class 3 (weight: 0.25)

Integrated base rate = (0.4 * 40%) + (0.35 * 30%) + (0.25 * 20%) = 33%

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

Confidence level: 7/10

The historical data provides a reasonably solid foundation for estimating the base rate, with multiple relevant reference classes and a relatively large sample size. However, there are still some key uncertainties, such as the potential for escalation, the specific decision-making process of the US government, and the evolving geopolitical landscape.

**Base Rate Estimate:** 33%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. US Military Interventions against Middle Eastern Countries: 40% base rate (weight: 0.4)
2. US Attacks on Countries with Nuclear Ambitions: 30% base rate (weight: 0.35)
3. Conflicts between the US and Iran: 20% base rate (weight: 0.25)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The potential for escalation and unintended consequences of a US attack on Iran
- The specific decision-making process and political considerations within the US government
- The evolving geopolitical landscape and the potential for diplomatic solutions or de-escalation
