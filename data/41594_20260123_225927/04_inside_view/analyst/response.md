# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The available information is limited, as there are no specific sources provided in the research synthesis. The search queries indicate a focus on recent US-Iran tensions, historical US military actions in the Middle East, and expert predictions on the likelihood of a US attack on Iran. However, without access to the actual sources, it is difficult to fully assess the quality, recency, and potential biases in the information.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
Without specific sources, I will classify the available evidence based on the descriptions provided:

**STRONG Evidence**
- None

**MODERATE Evidence**
- Tensions between the US and Iran have been high in recent years, with the potential for further escalation.
- The US has a history of military interventions against countries in the Middle East, especially those with nuclear ambitions.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Speculative predictions from experts on the likelihood of a US attack on Iran.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The high tensions between the US and Iran, as well as the US's history of military interventions in the Middle East, suggest an increased likelihood of a US attack on Iran. This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- The speculative predictions from experts do not significantly change the probability, as they are not supported by strong evidence.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from the base rate of 20.0%:
- Adjustment for MODERATE evidence: +7.5% (midpoint of 5-10 percentage points)
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +7.5%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** If the final probability is above 50%, it would suggest a high likelihood of a US attack on Iran, which would require significant escalation of tensions and a clear strategic rationale for such an action.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustment of 7.5 percentage points from the base rate of 20.0% is reasonable, as it reflects the moderate evidence of increased tensions and the US's history of military interventions in the region.

3. **Update magnitude:** The 7.5 percentage point adjustment is proportional to the moderate strength of the available evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability does not deviate significantly from the base rate, so regression to the mean is not a major concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst, I have focused on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. The available evidence suggests that tensions between the US and Iran have been high in recent years, and the US has a history of military interventions against countries in the Middle East, especially those with nuclear ambitions. This moderate evidence points to an increased likelihood of a US attack on Iran, but the speculative predictions from experts do not significantly change the probability.

Given the limited information, I have adjusted the base rate of 20.0% upward by 7.5 percentage points, resulting in a final probability estimate of 27.5%. This adjustment reflects the moderate evidence of increased tensions and the US's history of military interventions, but does not deviate significantly from the base rate, as a larger adjustment would require stronger supporting evidence.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 20.0%
- Total adjustment: +7.5%
- Final estimate: 27.5%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 27.5%**
