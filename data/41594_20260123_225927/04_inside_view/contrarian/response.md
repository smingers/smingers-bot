# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
You are a contrarian forecaster. Your job is to challenge the obvious
narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify
blind spots. Consider: What would make the base rate misleading?
What are people overlooking?


## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Resolution Criteria
The United States initiates a military attack against Iran, including airstrikes, missile strikes, or a ground invasion, before April 1, 2026.

## Search Queries

2. "Iran US tensions news 2023"
3. "Iran war predictions experts analysis"

## Web Search Results
The search results do not provide any significant new information beyond what is already captured in the base rate. The results discuss ongoing tensions between the US and Iran, but do not indicate any imminent military action.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The available evidence is relatively limited and does not provide much new information beyond the base rate. The information is mostly recent (within the last year), but lacks depth and independent verification. There is a potential for biases in media reporting on this sensitive geopolitical issue.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
**WEAK Evidence**
- Ongoing tensions between the US and Iran, but no clear signs of an impending attack.
- Speculation by some analysts about the possibility of a US attack, but no strong causal mechanisms or precedents identified.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
The available evidence does not provide a strong basis for adjusting the base rate in either direction. The information is largely speculative and does not point to a clear increase or decrease in the probability of a US attack on Iran.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from 20.0%:
- No significant adjustments based on the current evidence.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** 0%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be very low (<10%) or very high (>90%), it would require a significant escalation of tensions and clear indicators of an impending attack that are not currently present.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 20% seems reasonable given the historical precedents and current geopolitical dynamics. Without strong new evidence, a large deviation from this base rate would not be justified.

3. **Update magnitude:** The lack of significant updates is proportional to the weak and speculative nature of the available evidence.

4. **Regression to mean:** The prediction is not an extreme one, so regression to the mean is not a major concern.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a contrarian forecaster, I am looking for reasons the consensus might be wrong or overlooking important factors. However, the current evidence does not provide a strong basis for challenging the base rate. The ongoing tensions between the US and Iran are well-known, and the search results do not uncover any significant new developments or causal mechanisms that would drastically change the probability of a US attack.

While it is always possible that unexpected events or escalations could occur, the available information does not suggest a clear path towards a US military intervention against Iran in the near future. The base rate of 20% seems like a reasonable starting point, and the current evidence does not warrant a significant adjustment in either direction.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: None
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 20.0%
- Total adjustment: 0%
- Final estimate: 20.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 20.0%**
