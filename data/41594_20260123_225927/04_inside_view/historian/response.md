My research on the history of US military action against Iran and the current state of US-Iran tensions reveals the following:

**STRONG Evidence:**
- The US has a long history of military intervention in the Middle East, including past attacks on Iran. The US bombed Iran in 1988 during the Iran-Iraq war and conducted cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear program in the late 2000s. This suggests a precedent for potential future US military action against Iran.
- Tensions between the US and Iran have remained high in recent years, with the US withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and imposing harsh economic sanctions. This has increased the risk of a direct military confrontation.

**MODERATE Evidence:** 
- Experts have provided mixed predictions about the likelihood of a US attack on Iran in the near future. Some see the risk as relatively low given the potential consequences, while others warn that tensions could escalate quickly.
- There have been some recent incidents, such as Iran's attacks on US forces in Iraq and the US assassination of Iranian General Soleimani in 2020, that have heightened the risk of further military escalation.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- Speculation about a potential US-Iran war has been a persistent feature of media coverage, but the actual probability is difficult to assess without more concrete information.
- Volatile geopolitical indicators like fluctuations in oil prices or sabre-rattling rhetoric from leaders on both sides provide limited insight into the true risk of military conflict.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The most relevant information is fairly recent, focusing on the current state of US-Iran tensions and the history of past US military actions. The sources appear credible, coming from reputable news outlets and expert analyses. However, there is still significant uncertainty and potential for bias in how these issues are reported.

Much of this information is likely already reflected in the base rate, which was calculated using similar reference classes. However, the base rate may not fully capture the nuances of the current geopolitical situation.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification
**STRONG Evidence:**
- The US has a history of military intervention against Iran and in the Middle East more broadly.
- Tensions between the US and Iran have remained high in recent years, increasing the risk of a direct confrontation.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- Experts have provided mixed predictions about the likelihood of a US attack on Iran in the near future.
- There have been some recent incidents that have heightened the risk of military escalation.

**WEAK Evidence:**
- Speculation about a potential US-Iran war has been a persistent feature of media coverage.
- Volatile geopolitical indicators provide limited insight into the true risk of military conflict.

### Step 3: Direction of Update
**STRONG Evidence:**
- The history of US military intervention against Iran and in the Middle East pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 10 percentage points.
- The ongoing high tensions between the US and Iran also push the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The mixed expert predictions and recent incidents push the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 3 percentage points.

### Step 4: Integration
Starting from 20.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the history of US military intervention against Iran and in the Middle East.
- Adjustment 2: +5% for the ongoing high tensions between the US and Iran.
- Adjustment 3: +3% for the mixed expert predictions and recent incidents.
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +18%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** If the probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 is less than 10%, it would likely require a significant de-escalation of tensions and a major shift in US foreign policy priorities. Conversely, if the probability is greater than 90%, it would likely require an imminent and clear path to military conflict that is not currently evident.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustments made to the base rate are justified given the strong historical precedents for US military action against Iran and the current high-tension geopolitical environment.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate does not deviate too far from the base rate, suggesting that the tendency for extreme predictions to miss has been accounted for.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I believe the evidence strongly suggests an increased probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 compared to the base rate. The US has a long history of military intervention in the Middle East, including past attacks on Iran, which sets a precedent for potential future action. Additionally, the ongoing high tensions between the US and Iran, including recent incidents that have heightened the risk of escalation, further push the probability upward.

While expert predictions have been mixed, and there is still significant uncertainty and potential for bias in how these issues are reported, the combination of historical precedents and the current geopolitical environment warrants a substantial adjustment to the base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: History of US military intervention against Iran, ongoing high tensions between the US and Iran.
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None.
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 20.0%
- Total adjustment: +18%
- Final estimate: 38.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 38.0%**
