# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Description
The question is asking about the likelihood of the United States attacking Iran before April 2026.

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be resolved as "Yes" if the United States launches a military attack against Iran before April 1, 2026. It will be resolved as "No" if no such attack occurs by that date.

## Current Research
# Research Synthesis

**Generated:** 2026-01-23T23:00:03.084718+00:00
**Total Sources:** 30

## Source Analysis
The sources cover a range of perspectives on the history of US-Iran relations and recent tensions, including news reports, analysis from think tanks and academic institutions, and government documents. The information spans several decades, with a focus on more recent events in the past 5-10 years. Overall, the sources appear to be credible and offer a balanced view, though there may be some bias in reporting from certain outlets.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence (pointing UP):**
- Recent military deployments and escalating rhetoric from both the US and Iran suggest a heightened risk of conflict. Multiple credible sources report on the movement of US naval assets towards the Middle East and Iran's threats of retaliation.
- The US has a history of military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran, with a high base rate of 50% for the region and 20% specifically for Iran.

**MODERATE Evidence (pointing UP):**
- The US and Iran have had a long and contentious relationship since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, marked by covert actions, proxy conflicts, and periodic military confrontations. This history increases the plausibility of a future US attack.
- Domestic political pressures in both the US and Iran could incentivize escalation, as leaders seek to appear strong and project power.

**WEAK Evidence (pointing DOWN):**
- The 2015 nuclear deal and subsequent US withdrawal have increased tensions, but also demonstrated a desire by both sides to avoid full-scale war. This could make them more cautious about initiating a direct military conflict.
- The US may be deterred by the risk of Iranian retaliation, including through asymmetric means like cyberattacks or proxy forces, which could be costly.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence (pointing UP):**
- Recent military deployments and escalating rhetoric: +20 percentage points. The movement of US naval assets and Iran's combative statements suggest a heightened risk of conflict that is not fully captured in the base rate.
- US history of interventions in the Middle East and against Iran: +10 percentage points. This increases the plausibility of a future US attack, though the base rate already accounts for some of this.

**MODERATE Evidence (pointing UP):**
- Contentious US-Iran relationship since 1979: +5 percentage points. The long history of hostility makes conflict more likely, but does not dramatically change the probability.
- Domestic political pressures: +5 percentage points. Leaders may feel compelled to take action, but the extent of this influence is uncertain.

**WEAK Evidence (pointing DOWN):**
- 2015 nuclear deal and desire to avoid war: -5 percentage points. This suggests both sides may be cautious about initiating a direct conflict, but does not outweigh the other evidence.
- Risk of Iranian retaliation: -5 percentage points. The US may be deterred by the potential costs of an Iranian response, but this factor is also somewhat priced into the base rate.

## Integration
Starting from 0.1%:
- Adjustment 1 (+20%): 0.1% + 20% = 20.1%
- Adjustment 2 (+10%): 20.1% + 10% = 30.1%
- Adjustment 3 (+5%): 30.1% + 5% = 35.1%
- Adjustment 4 (-5%): 35.1% - 5% = 30.1%
- Adjustment 5 (-5%): 30.1% - 5% = 25.1%
**Cumulative adjustment:** +25 percentage points

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be less than 10% or greater than 90%, it would imply that either the US and Iran have found a way to de-escalate tensions dramatically, or that they are on the brink of a major military confrontation. Both scenarios seem unlikely given the current geopolitical landscape.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 25 percentage point adjustment from the base rate is substantial but justified by the strong evidence of recent military deployments and the historical pattern of US interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest factors pushing the probability up by 20-30 percentage points and the weaker factors adjusting by 5 percentage points.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the high base rate and the strong evidence pointing towards an increased probability, there is less need to account for regression to the mean in this case.

## Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, I believe the current evidence points to an increased likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026. The key factors driving this assessment are:

1. The recent military deployments and escalating rhetoric from both the US and Iran, which suggest a heightened risk of conflict that is not fully captured in the base rate.
2. The historical pattern of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran, which increases the plausibility of a future attack.
3. The long-standing and contentious relationship between the US and Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which has been marked by periodic military confrontations.
4. Domestic political pressures in both countries, which could incentivize escalation as leaders seek to appear strong and project power.

While the 2015 nuclear deal and the desire to avoid a full-scale war provide some counterbalancing factors, I believe these are outweighed by the other evidence pointing towards an increased probability of a US attack on Iran in the coming years.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Recent military deployments, escalating rhetoric, US history of interventions in the Middle East and against Iran
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.1%
- Total adjustment: +25 percentage points
- Final estimate: 25.1%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 25.1%**
