# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Source Analysis

The evidence gathered covers a wide range of recent events and expert analysis on the likelihood of a US attack on Iran. The sources appear to be credible, including reputable news outlets, think tanks, and historical accounts. However, there are some potential biases in the reporting, as the media may be prone to sensationalism and speculation around military conflicts.

Additionally, much of the information is related to past tensions and conflicts between the US and Iran, which may already be reflected in the base rate. The most recent and directly relevant evidence seems to be the reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials, which could indicate an increased risk of escalation.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence (pushing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: Recent reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials, suggesting heightened tensions and risk of escalation.
- [Evidence 2]: Historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran, indicating a higher likelihood of action.

**MODERATE Evidence (pushing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: Expert analysis suggesting the US may be more willing to use military force against Iran due to the current administration's hawkish stance.
- [Evidence 2]: Ongoing regional conflicts and proxy wars between the US and Iran, which could increase the risk of direct confrontation.

**WEAK Evidence (pushing DOWN):**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation about the potential consequences and risks of a US attack on Iran, which could deter the US from taking such action.
- [Evidence 2]: Anecdotal reports of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, which could reduce the likelihood of a US attack.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**Strong Evidence (pushing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: The recent reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials suggest an increased risk of escalation, pushing the probability up by approximately 10 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran, indicates a higher likelihood of action, pushing the probability up by approximately 5 percentage points.

**Moderate Evidence (pushing UP):**
- [Evidence 1]: The expert analysis suggesting the US may be more willing to use military force against Iran due to the current administration's hawkish stance pushes the probability up by approximately 3 percentage points.
- [Evidence 2]: The ongoing regional conflicts and proxy wars between the US and Iran could increase the risk of direct confrontation, pushing the probability up by approximately 2 percentage points.

**Weak Evidence (pushing DOWN):**
- [Evidence 1]: The speculation about the potential consequences and risks of a US attack on Iran could deter the US from taking such action, pushing the probability down by approximately 1 percentage point.
- [Evidence 2]: The anecdotal reports of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions could reduce the likelihood of a US attack, pushing the probability down by approximately 1 percentage point.

## Integration

Starting from 0.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the recent reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials
- Adjustment 2: +5% for the historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran
- Adjustment 3: +3% for the expert analysis suggesting the US may be more willing to use military force against Iran due to the current administration's hawkish stance
- Adjustment 4: +2% for the ongoing regional conflicts and proxy wars between the US and Iran
- Adjustment 5: -1% for the speculation about the potential consequences and risks of a US attack on Iran
- Adjustment 6: -1% for the anecdotal reports of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +18%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is over 90%, it would require an extremely high likelihood of a US attack, which seems unlikely given the potential risks and consequences. Conversely, if my prediction is under 10%, it would suggest the US is highly unlikely to attack Iran, which may not be supported by the current evidence.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 18% adjustment from the base rate of 0.1% is significant but can be justified by the strong evidence of heightened tensions and the historical precedent of US military interventions in the region.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are generally proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence pushing the probability up the most, and the weaker evidence having a smaller impact.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not pushing the probability too high, despite the strong evidence pointing towards an increased likelihood of a US attack.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base rate of 0.1% may be misleading and underestimate the current risk of a US attack on Iran. The recent reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials, combined with the historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran, suggest an increased likelihood of escalation and potential conflict.

Additionally, the expert analysis indicating the US may be more willing to use military force against Iran due to the current administration's hawkish stance, as well as the ongoing regional conflicts and proxy wars between the two countries, further contribute to the risk of a US attack.

While there are some factors that could push the probability down, such as the potential consequences and risks of such an attack, as well as diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, the overall evidence points to a higher likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Recent reports of US military deployments and threats of retaliation from Iranian officials, historical precedent of US military interventions in the Middle East, including against Iran
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.1%
- Total adjustment: +18%
- Final estimate: 18.1%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 18.1%**
