**Total Sources:** 30

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The evidence gathered covers a wide range of relevant historical information on U.S.-Iran relations and potential for military conflict. The sources appear to be credible, with a mix of academic, news, and government sources. The information spans several decades, from the 1979 Islamic Revolution to the present day, providing a comprehensive historical context.

The most recent information is from early 2026, indicating the evidence is relatively current and likely captures the latest developments in the U.S.-Iran tensions. However, there are still some potential biases in the reporting, as the sources may have their own political leanings or agendas when covering this sensitive geopolitical issue.

Overall, the evidence provides a solid foundation for understanding the historical precedents and patterns in U.S.-Iran relations, which is directly relevant to assessing the probability of a U.S. attack on Iran in the near future. The base rate of 0.1% seems reasonable given the historical context, but may not fully capture the current tensions and potential for escalation.

## Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- The history of U.S. military interventions against Iran, including the 1953 coup and subsequent tensions, suggests a higher likelihood of U.S. military action against Iran in the future.
- The recent increase in U.S. military deployments and rhetoric towards Iran, including Trump's statements about an "armada" heading to the region, indicates a heightened risk of potential conflict.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The complex and often adversarial relationship between the U.S. and Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including proxy conflicts and sanctions, creates an environment where miscalculation or escalation could lead to direct military confrontation.
- Iran's increasingly combative official statements and rhetoric towards the U.S. suggest its leaders may be taking the U.S. military buildup more seriously and could potentially provoke a response.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Speculation about the potential for Iran to launch a "deadly night attack" on U.S. bases, based on the movement of missiles and drones, may be exaggerated or lack concrete evidence.
- The toll of the recent protest crackdown in Iran, while significant, may not directly influence the probability of a U.S. military attack.

## Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence**
- The history of U.S. military interventions against Iran pushes the probability UP by approximately 10 percentage points, as it demonstrates a precedent for such action and the willingness of the U.S. to use military force against Iran.
- The recent increase in U.S. military deployments and rhetoric towards Iran pushes the probability UP by approximately 15 percentage points, as it indicates a heightened risk of potential conflict in the near future.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The complex and adversarial relationship between the U.S. and Iran pushes the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points, as it creates an environment where miscalculation or escalation could lead to direct military confrontation.
- Iran's combative official statements and rhetoric towards the U.S. push the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points, as they suggest a potential for further escalation and a possible U.S. response.

**WEAK Evidence**
- The speculation about a potential "deadly night attack" by Iran and the toll of the protest crackdown are not expected to have a significant impact on the probability, as they are not directly relevant to the likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran.

## Step 4: Integration

Starting from 0.1%:
- Adjustment 1: +10% for the history of U.S. military interventions against Iran
- Adjustment 2: +15% for the recent increase in U.S. military deployments and rhetoric towards Iran
- Adjustment 3: +5% for the complex and adversarial relationship between the U.S. and Iran
- Adjustment 4: +5% for Iran's combative official statements and rhetoric towards the U.S.
- Cumulative adjustment: +35%

## Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** Even if the current tensions and military buildup between the U.S. and Iran escalate significantly, it is highly unlikely that the probability of a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026 would exceed 90%. There are still significant political and diplomatic obstacles to such an action, and the U.S. would likely exhaust other options before resorting to direct military intervention.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The cumulative adjustment of +35% from the base rate is justified given the strong historical precedents for U.S. military interventions against Iran, the recent escalation in tensions, and the potential for miscalculation or further escalation. The base rate of 0.1% does not fully capture the current geopolitical dynamics, and the adjusted probability of 35% is a reasonable estimate based on the evidence.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (historical precedents and recent military deployments) receiving the largest adjustments, and the weaker evidence (speculation and protest crackdown) having little to no impact on the final probability.

4. **Regression to mean:** Given the significant adjustments made to the base rate, there is a risk of the final probability overestimating the actual likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran. However, the sanity checks and the overall reasoning process help mitigate this tendency and ensure the final probability is a reasonable estimate based on the available evidence.

## Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a historian, I believe the probability of the United States attacking Iran before April 2026 is 35%. This assessment is based on the strong historical precedents of U.S. military interventions against Iran, the recent escalation in tensions and military deployments, and the potential for miscalculation or further escalation in the complex and adversarial relationship between the two countries.

The history of U.S. involvement in Iran, including the 1953 coup and subsequent tensions, demonstrates a willingness to use military force against the Iranian regime. The current situation, with the U.S. deploying an "armada" to the region and issuing strong rhetoric towards Iran, further increases the risk of a direct military confrontation.

While there are still significant political and diplomatic obstacles to a U.S. attack on Iran, the combination of historical precedents, current tensions, and the potential for miscalculation or escalation suggests a higher probability of such an event occurring before April 2026 compared to the initial base rate of 0.1%.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: History of U.S. military interventions against Iran, recent increase in U.S. military deployments and rhetoric towards Iran
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 0.1%
- Total adjustment: +35%
- Final estimate: 35%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 35%**
