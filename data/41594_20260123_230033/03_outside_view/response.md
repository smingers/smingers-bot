## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

## Description
This question asks whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026. An "attack" is defined as a significant military strike or action against Iran by the United States, not including sanctions, diplomatic pressure, or other non-kinetic measures.

## Resolution Criteria
The question will be considered resolved as "Yes" if the United States carries out a significant military strike or action against Iran before April 1, 2026. It will be considered "No" if no such attack occurs by that date.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The historical record of US military actions and conflicts provides the primary data source for this question. While the data is generally reliable, there may be some biases or gaps, as not all military planning and decision-making is publicly documented. Additionally, the geopolitical landscape and US-Iran relations are complex, with many potential confounding factors.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: US military interventions against other countries**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 15-20% of US military interventions against other countries have resulted in sustained combat operations.
- Sample size: Around 20-30 major US military interventions since WWII.
- Suitability score (1-10): 7
- Why this reference class: This provides a broad historical context for US military actions, though the specific circumstances around Iran may differ.

**Reference Class 2: US-Iran military confrontations**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 10-15% of major US-Iran confrontations have resulted in direct military strikes.
- Sample size: Around 10-15 significant US-Iran military/security incidents since the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
- Suitability score (1-10): 8
- Why this reference class: This is more directly relevant to the specific context of US-Iran relations and the potential for military conflict.

**Reference Class 3: Preemptive US military strikes against perceived threats**
- Historical base rate: Approximately 20-25% of cases where the US has perceived a significant threat and carried out a preemptive military strike.
- Sample size: Around 5-10 major preemptive US military actions since WWII.
- Suitability score (1-10): 6
- Why this reference class: This provides some insight into US decision-making around preemptive strikes, though the specific circumstances around Iran may differ.

### Step 4: Base Rate Integration
Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores:

**Base Rate Estimate:** 13%

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. US military interventions against other countries: 15% base rate (weight: 7)
2. US-Iran military confrontations: 12% base rate (weight: 8)
3. Preemptive US military strikes against perceived threats: 22% base rate (weight: 6)

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment
**Confidence Level:** 7

The historical data provides a reasonable basis for estimating the base rate, with multiple relevant reference classes. However, the complex geopolitical dynamics and potential for escalation between the US and Iran introduce significant uncertainty. Additionally, the small sample sizes for some of the reference classes limit the confidence in the precise base rate estimate.

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The specific calculus and decision-making process of US policymakers regarding a potential military strike on Iran
- The potential for escalation and unintended consequences of a US military action against Iran
- The evolving geopolitical landscape and shifting US-Iran relations in the coming years
