# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: analyst
You are a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster. Focus on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. Weigh evidence by strength (strong, moderate, weak) and reason through how each piece updates the base rate.

## Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a wide range of recent developments in US-Iran relations, including military confrontations, sanctions, and diplomatic tensions. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable news outlets and think tanks. However, there is a potential for bias, as some sources may have a particular political leaning or agenda. Additionally, much of the information is relatively recent, so it may not fully capture the long-term dynamics and historical context of the relationship.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence (UP):**
- The US has a history of military interventions against perceived threats, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This suggests a willingness to use force preemptively against Iran.
- Iran has a track record of supporting militant groups and proxy forces that have attacked US interests in the region, such as the 1983 bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut. This could heighten US concerns and the perceived need for military action.

**MODERATE Evidence (UP):**
- Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated in recent years, with the US withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, reimposing sanctions, and engaging in military confrontations such as the 2019 downing of a US drone. This indicates a deteriorating relationship that could increase the risk of conflict.
- The US has deployed military assets, including an aircraft carrier group, to the Middle East in response to perceived threats from Iran. This suggests a heightened state of readiness for potential military action.

**WEAK Evidence (NEUTRAL):**
- Some experts have expressed skepticism about the likelihood of a full-scale US military attack on Iran, citing the potential for severe consequences and the lack of an obvious trigger for such an action.
- Domestic political considerations in the US, such as the desire to avoid another costly and unpopular war, may constrain the willingness of the US government to initiate military action against Iran.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence (UP):**
- The US's history of military interventions against perceived threats, as well as Iran's support for militant groups that have attacked US interests, suggest a higher likelihood of the US attacking Iran. These factors push the probability up by approximately 10-15 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence (UP):**
- The deteriorating US-Iran relationship and the deployment of US military assets to the region indicate an increased risk of conflict, pushing the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**WEAK Evidence (NEUTRAL):**
- The skepticism expressed by some experts and the potential domestic political constraints on the US government suggest that the probability may not be as high as the strong and moderate evidence would indicate. However, these factors do not significantly change the overall assessment.

## Integration
Starting from 50.0%:
- Adjustment 1 (STRONG UP): +12.5%
- Adjustment 2 (MODERATE UP): +7.5%
- Cumulative adjustment: +20%

## Sanity Checks
1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be less than 10%, it would imply that the US has little to no willingness or capacity to use military force against Iran, which seems unlikely given the historical precedents and current tensions.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 20% adjustment from the base rate is justified by the strong and moderate evidence, which suggests a meaningful increase in the likelihood of a US attack on Iran.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the stronger evidence leading to larger adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate of 70% does not represent an extreme prediction, so regression to the mean is not a major concern.

## Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst, I believe the current evidence points to an increased likelihood of the US attacking Iran before April 2026. The US has a history of using military force against perceived threats, and the ongoing tensions and confrontations between the US and Iran, including Iran's support for militant groups that have attacked US interests, suggest a heightened risk of conflict.

At the same time, the potential for severe consequences and domestic political constraints in the US may temper the likelihood of a full-scale military attack. However, the strong and moderate evidence outweighs the weaker evidence, leading me to conclude that the probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 is higher than the initial base rate.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: US history of military interventions against perceived threats, Iran's support for militant groups
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 50.0%
- Total adjustment: +20%
- Final estimate: 70.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 70.0%**
