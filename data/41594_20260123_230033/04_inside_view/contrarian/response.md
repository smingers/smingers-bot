# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Question
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

**Total Sources:** 28

## Source Analysis
The evidence gathered covers a wide range of recent events and historical context around US-Iran tensions and military confrontations. The sources appear to be from reputable news outlets and organizations, providing a relatively balanced and up-to-date perspective. However, there are potential biases in the reporting, as some sources may have a pro-US or anti-Iran slant. Additionally, the base rate may already reflect some of this information, so the value of the current evidence in further adjusting the probability is unclear.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The long history of US-Iran tensions, including the 1979 hostage crisis, US support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War, and recent confrontations like the shooting down of a US drone, suggest a high likelihood of further military escalation.
- [Evidence 2]: The US has a track record of preemptive military strikes against perceived threats, such as the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020, which could increase the probability of an attack on Iran.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Renewed tensions in the Persian Gulf, with Iran-backed militias attacking oil tankers and the US deploying additional military forces to the region, indicate a heightened risk of conflict.
- [Evidence 2]: The Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, including the reimposition of sanctions and withdrawal from the nuclear deal, could increase the likelihood of a US attack to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Ongoing protests and unrest within Iran, and the US's stated concerns over the regime's crackdown on protesters, could be used as a pretext for military intervention.
- [Evidence 2]: Speculation about a "big force" being deployed by the US towards Iran, as mentioned by President Trump, may suggest preparations for a potential attack.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: UP by approximately 15 percentage points because the long history of US-Iran tensions and the potential for further escalation suggests a high likelihood of a US attack.
- [Evidence 2]: UP by approximately 10 percentage points because the US's track record of preemptive strikes against perceived threats increases the probability of an attack on Iran.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: UP by approximately 5 percentage points because the renewed tensions in the Persian Gulf and the deployment of additional US military forces indicate an elevated risk of conflict.
- [Evidence 2]: UP by approximately 5 percentage points because the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran could increase the likelihood of a US attack to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: UP by approximately 2 percentage points because the unrest within Iran and the US's stated concerns over the regime's crackdown on protesters could potentially be used as a pretext for military intervention, though this is speculative.
- [Evidence 2]: UP by approximately 2 percentage points because the speculation about a "big force" being deployed by the US towards Iran may suggest preparations for a potential attack, but this is also highly speculative.

## Integration
Starting from 50.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +15% for the long history of US-Iran tensions and the potential for further escalation
- Adjustment 2: +10% for the US's track record of preemptive strikes against perceived threats
- Adjustment 3: +5% for the renewed tensions in the Persian Gulf and the deployment of additional US military forces
- Adjustment 4: +5% for the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran
- Adjustment 5: +2% for the unrest within Iran and the US's stated concerns over the regime's crackdown on protesters
- Adjustment 6: +2% for the speculation about a "big force" being deployed by the US towards Iran
- **Cumulative adjustment:** +39%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is above 90%, it would mean that the US is highly likely to attack Iran before April 2026, which would require a significant escalation of tensions and a drastic shift in US foreign policy that is not currently evident.

2. **Base rate anchor:** While my final estimate deviates significantly from the base rate, I believe I have provided a strong justification for this based on the evidence, including the long history of US-Iran tensions, the US's track record of preemptive strikes, and the current geopolitical context.

3. **Update magnitude:** The magnitude of my evidence updates is proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not adjusting the probability too far from the base rate, and by acknowledging the potential for unexpected events or de-escalation that could push the probability back towards the mean.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base rate of 50.0% may be misleading and underestimate the likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026. The long history of US-Iran tensions, the US's track record of preemptive strikes, and the current geopolitical context all point to an elevated risk of military conflict.

While the base rate may reflect some of this information, the recent escalation of tensions, the deployment of additional US military forces, and the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran suggest that the probability of a US attack is higher than the starting point. The unrest within Iran and the speculation about a "big force" being deployed by the US towards Iran, though weaker evidence, also contribute to my assessment.

Ultimately, I believe the balance of evidence points to a higher likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026, and I have adjusted the probability accordingly.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Long history of US-Iran tensions, US track record of preemptive strikes
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 50.0%
- Total adjustment: +39%
- Final estimate: 89.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 89.0%**
