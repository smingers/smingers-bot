**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: 
  - Recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran, including threats of military action and the deployment of US naval forces to the region.
  - History of past US military interventions against Iran, including the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020.
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN:
  - The US and Iran have shown some restraint in recent months, with the US president indicating that "killing has stopped" and that Iran has no plans for further attacks.
  - The high economic and political costs of a full-scale US military intervention in Iran, especially given the ongoing domestic unrest and instability in Iran.
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 23.8%
- Total adjustment: +5%
- Final estimate: 28.8%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

The current evidence suggests a more complex and uncertain geopolitical situation between the US and Iran, with both sides demonstrating a mix of aggressive and restrained behavior. While the recent escalation of tensions and historical precedent of US military interventions point to an increased probability of a US attack on Iran, the apparent de-escalation in recent months and the high costs of such an intervention suggest that the base rate should not be adjusted too significantly upwards.

Probability: 28.8%
