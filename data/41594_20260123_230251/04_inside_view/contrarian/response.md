# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

The research provides a mixed picture on the likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026. There is evidence of longstanding tensions and a history of military confrontations between the two countries. However, there are also signs of recent de-escalation and efforts to avoid direct conflict.

### Step 1: Source Analysis
The evidence is relatively recent, with most sources covering events within the past 2-3 years. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable news outlets and think tanks. However, there may be some potential for bias, as the US-Iran relationship is a highly politicized issue.

Much of the information seems to already be priced into the base rate, which is based on a broader set of historical US military interventions and confrontations with Iran. The base rate likely captures the general risk of US-Iran conflict, so the new evidence may not dramatically shift the probability.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The history of US-Iran tensions, including the 1979 hostage crisis, the 1988 attack on Iranian oil platforms, and the 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani, suggests a high risk of future military confrontation.
- [Evidence 2]: The recent escalation of tensions, including the US assassination of Soleimani and Iran's retaliatory strikes on US bases in Iraq, demonstrates the potential for rapid escalation between the two countries.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The 2015 Iran nuclear deal and subsequent US withdrawal in 2018 have increased tensions, but also provided a framework for diplomacy and de-escalation.
- [Evidence 2]: The ongoing protests and unrest in Iran, which the US has been accused of fomenting, could increase the risk of a US strike, but could also make Iran less likely to provoke a direct confrontation.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation about a potential US "armada" moving towards Iran, which may be more rhetoric than a concrete military threat.
- [Evidence 2]: Uncertain predictions from experts about the likelihood of a US-Iran conflict in the next few years, which are difficult to assess without more context.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 5-10 percentage points, as the history of US-Iran tensions suggests a persistent risk of military confrontation.
- [Evidence 2]: This pushes the probability UP from the base rate by approximately 3-5 percentage points, as the recent escalation demonstrates the potential for rapid escalation.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This pushes the probability DOWN from the base rate by approximately 2-3 percentage points, as the nuclear deal framework provides a path for diplomacy and de-escalation.
- [Evidence 2]: This has a mixed effect, as the unrest in Iran could both increase and decrease the risk of a US strike, so no significant adjustment is warranted.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: This has a negligible effect on the probability, as the "armada" rhetoric is likely more posturing than a concrete military threat.
- [Evidence 2]: This also has a negligible effect, as the expert predictions are too uncertain to warrant a significant adjustment.

### Step 4: Integration

Starting from 23.8%:
- Adjustment 1: +7.5% for the strong historical evidence of US-Iran tensions
- Adjustment 2: +4% for the recent escalation of tensions
- Adjustment 3: -2.5% for the moderating effect of the nuclear deal framework
- Cumulative adjustment: +9%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to exceed 90%, it would imply that a US attack on Iran is virtually certain, which seems unlikely given the complex geopolitical dynamics and the potential for further diplomacy and de-escalation.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 9% adjustment from the base rate is significant but not unreasonable, as the new evidence highlights specific factors that could increase the risk of a US attack, such as the history of tensions and recent escalation.

3. **Update magnitude:** The updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (historical tensions and recent escalation) receiving the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability of 32.8% is still relatively close to the base rate, suggesting that I have not overreacted to the new evidence and that the prediction has not strayed too far from the mean.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I have identified several reasons why the base rate of 23.8% may be misleading or overlooking important factors. The history of US-Iran tensions and the recent escalation of conflict suggest a persistent risk of military confrontation, which pushes the probability higher. However, the existence of the nuclear deal framework and the potential for unrest in Iran to either increase or decrease the risk of a US strike introduce some moderating factors.

Overall, the evidence points to an increased likelihood of a US attack on Iran before April 2026, but the probability is not as high as it might initially appear. There are still paths for diplomacy and de-escalation, and the complex geopolitical dynamics make it difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: History of US-Iran tensions, recent escalation of conflict
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Existence of nuclear deal framework, uncertain effect of unrest in Iran
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 23.8%
- Total adjustment: +9%
- Final estimate: 32.8%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 7/10

**Probability: 32.8%**
