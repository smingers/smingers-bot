## Source Analysis

The sources provide a comprehensive overview of the historical relationship between the United States and Iran, covering key events and tensions dating back to the 1950s. The information is relatively recent, with many sources covering events within the past 5 years. The sources appear to be credible, coming from reputable media outlets, think tanks, and government/academic institutions. While some potential biases may exist, the overall picture painted by the evidence seems balanced and well-rounded.

Much of the historical context provided is likely already incorporated into the base rate, as it covers long-standing tensions and patterns of US-Iran confrontation. However, the more recent escalations and potential for renewed conflict are not fully captured in the base rate.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- The history of US military interventions against Iran, including the 1988 attack on Iranian oil platforms and ship, suggests a pattern of US willingness to use force against Iran when tensions escalate. This pushes the probability up.
- The 2023 outbreak of war between Israel and Iran-backed Palestinian militants, which drew the US into the conflict, demonstrates the potential for rapid escalation between the US and Iran. This also pushes the probability up.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- The Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, including the killing of Qasem Soleimani in 2020, indicates a more aggressive US posture towards Iran. This pushes the probability up.
- The recent crackdown by the Iranian regime on nationwide protests, and the resulting tensions with the US, suggests an increased risk of conflict. This pushes the probability up.

**WEAK Evidence**
- Speculation about potential US military strikes against Iran in response to the protests, as suggested by some sources, is too speculative to incorporate into the estimate. This evidence is not used.
- Reports of the US moving naval assets towards Iran are volatile indicators that do not provide a clear causal mechanism for a US attack. This evidence is not used.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence:**
- The history of US military interventions against Iran, including the 1988 attack on Iranian oil platforms and ship, suggests a pattern of US willingness to use force against Iran when tensions escalate. This pushes the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.
- The 2023 outbreak of war between Israel and Iran-backed Palestinian militants, which drew the US into the conflict, demonstrates the potential for rapid escalation between the US and Iran. This also pushes the probability up by approximately 5-10 percentage points.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
- The Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, including the killing of Qasem Soleimani in 2020, indicates a more aggressive US posture towards Iran. This pushes the probability up by approximately 3-5 percentage points.
- The recent crackdown by the Iranian regime on nationwide protests, and the resulting tensions with the US, suggests an increased risk of conflict. This pushes the probability up by approximately 3-5 percentage points.

## Integration

Starting from 23.8%:
- Adjustment 1: +7.5% for the history of US military interventions against Iran
- Adjustment 2: +7.5% for the potential for rapid escalation between the US and Iran due to the 2023 Israel-Iran conflict
- Adjustment 3: +4% for the Trump administration's more aggressive posture towards Iran
- Adjustment 4: +4% for the increased tensions due to the Iranian regime's crackdown on protests
- Cumulative adjustment: +23%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If the probability were to be above 90%, it would mean that a US attack on Iran before April 2026 is virtually certain. This seems unlikely given the complex geopolitical situation and the potential for diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The 23% adjustment from the base rate is significant but can be justified by the historical precedents, the recent escalations, and the potential for further conflict. The base rate alone does not fully capture the current risk.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence leading to the largest adjustments.

4. **Regression to mean:** The final probability estimate of 46.8% does not represent an extreme prediction, and accounts for the tendency of forecasts to regress towards the mean over time.

## Final Reasoning

As a historian, I believe the current evidence points to an elevated risk of a US attack on Iran before April 2026, compared to the base rate. The long history of US military interventions against Iran, including direct attacks, suggests a pattern of US willingness to use force when tensions escalate. The recent outbreak of war between Israel and Iran-backed militants, which drew the US into the conflict, further demonstrates the potential for rapid escalation between the US and Iran.

Additionally, the more aggressive posture of the Trump administration towards Iran, including the killing of Qasem Soleimani, and the increased tensions due to the Iranian regime's crackdown on protests, indicate an increased risk of conflict. While the base rate of 23.8% already accounts for some of this historical context, the current situation represents a heightened risk that is not fully captured in the starting point.

Ultimately, the cumulative evidence suggests a 46.8% probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026. This assessment takes into account the strong historical precedents, the potential for rapid escalation, and the current geopolitical tensions, while also recognizing the complex and uncertain nature of the situation.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: History of US military interventions against Iran, potential for rapid escalation due to Israel-Iran conflict
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 23.8%
- Total adjustment: +23%
- Final estimate: 46.8%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 46.8%**
