**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: 
  - Recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran, including threats of military action and the deployment of US naval forces to the region (Evidence 1-4)
  - History of past US military attacks against Iran and other Middle Eastern countries (Evidence 5-8)
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN:
  - Efforts by both the US and Iran to de-escalate tensions and avoid direct military confrontation (Evidence 9-11)
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 18.0%
- Total adjustment: +15%
- Final estimate: 33.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 33.0%**

As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have carefully weighed the current evidence regarding the likelihood of the US attacking Iran before April 2026. The base rate of 18.0% reflects the historical precedent of US military attacks against other countries, Middle Eastern countries, and countries with nuclear capabilities. However, the recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran, including threats of military action and the deployment of US naval forces to the region, suggests a heightened risk of conflict.

The strong evidence pointing towards an increased probability includes:
1. The US has a history of military attacks against Iran, such as the 1988 destruction of Iranian oil platforms and a ship in the Strait of Hormuz (Evidence 5-8). This precedent increases the likelihood of future US military action against Iran.
2. The current tensions between the US and Iran, including the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and Iran's attacks on US interests in the region, have raised the risk of a larger conflict (Evidence 1-4).
3. The US has demonstrated a willingness to use military force against other Middle Eastern countries, such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (Evidence 5-8), which further increases the probability of a US attack on Iran.

However, there is also strong evidence pointing towards a lower probability of a US attack on Iran. Both the US and Iran have expressed a desire to avoid direct military confrontation and have taken steps to de-escalate tensions, such as the US president's recent comments about the "killing having stopped" in Iran (Evidence 9-11). This suggests that both sides are interested in avoiding a full-scale war.

After carefully weighing the evidence, I have increased the probability from the base rate of 18.0% to 33.0%. While the current situation is tense, the strong desire of both the US and Iran to avoid direct military conflict, as well as the potential for further diplomatic efforts, suggests that the probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 is still relatively low, though higher than the historical average.

Probability: 33.0%
