# Inside View (Evidence Adjustment)

## Your Role: contrarian
As a contrarian forecaster, my job is to challenge the obvious narrative, find reasons the consensus might be wrong, and identify blind spots. I will consider what could make the base rate misleading and what people might be overlooking.

## Source Analysis

The evidence presented covers a wide range of recent developments in US-Iran relations, including historical context, current tensions, and expert predictions. The sources seem credible, coming from reputable news outlets and think tanks. The information is generally quite recent, with many articles from 2023-2026, so it appears to capture the latest dynamics.

However, there are a few potential issues:
1. Reporting bias - Many of the sources have an American or Western perspective, which could downplay or overlook Iranian motivations and decision-making.
2. Priced-in information - Some of the evidence, like the history of US-Iran tensions, is likely already reflected in the base rate.
3. Lack of insider information - As a contrarian, I would want more access to classified intelligence or decision-makers' perspectives to truly challenge the consensus.

## Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The history of US military attacks against Iran and the Middle East, including the 1988 attack on Iranian oil platforms, suggests a precedent for potential future US aggression. This pushes the probability UP.
- [Evidence 2]: The recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran, including the killing of Qasem Soleimani and Iran's retaliation, indicates a heightened risk of conflict. This pushes the probability UP.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Expert predictions of a possible US-Iran conflict in 2026 provide some support for an increased probability, but the specific details and reasoning are unclear. This pushes the probability UP slightly.
- [Evidence 2]: The ongoing unrest and protests in Iran, and the Iranian regime's crackdown, could potentially increase the risk of a US intervention, but the causal link is indirect. This pushes the probability UP slightly.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation about a potential US "armada" moving towards Iran and Trump's tough rhetoric do not necessarily translate to a concrete plan for military action. This has little impact on the probability.
- [Evidence 2]: The history of US-Iran relations, while relevant context, is largely already captured in the base rate and does not warrant a significant adjustment.

## Evidence Update Reasoning

**STRONG Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: The history of US military attacks against Iran and the Middle East pushes the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points, as it suggests a precedent for potential future aggression.
- [Evidence 2]: The recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran, including the killing of Qasem Soleimani and Iran's retaliation, pushes the probability UP by approximately 5 percentage points, as it indicates a heightened risk of conflict.

**MODERATE Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Expert predictions of a possible US-Iran conflict in 2026 push the probability UP by approximately 2 percentage points, as they provide some support for an increased probability, but the specific details and reasoning are unclear.
- [Evidence 2]: The ongoing unrest and protests in Iran, and the Iranian regime's crackdown, push the probability UP by approximately 1 percentage point, as they could potentially increase the risk of a US intervention, but the causal link is indirect.

**WEAK Evidence**
- [Evidence 1]: Speculation about a potential US "armada" moving towards Iran and Trump's tough rhetoric have little impact on the probability, as they do not necessarily translate to a concrete plan for military action.
- [Evidence 2]: The history of US-Iran relations is largely already captured in the base rate and does not warrant a significant adjustment.

## Integration

Starting from 18.0%:
- Adjustment 1: +5% for the history of US military attacks against Iran and the Middle East
- Adjustment 2: +5% for the recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran
- Adjustment 3: +2% for expert predictions of a possible US-Iran conflict in 2026
- Adjustment 4: +1% for the ongoing unrest and protests in Iran
- Cumulative adjustment: +13%

## Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** If my prediction is significantly above 50%, it would mean that I believe the US is highly likely to attack Iran before April 2026, which would require a very compelling case that the current tensions and historical precedent are likely to lead to an outright military conflict. This seems plausible given the evidence, but I would need to be very confident in my assessment to make such a high-probability prediction.

2. **Base rate anchor:** The base rate of 18% is based on a robust set of reference classes, and a 13% upward adjustment seems justified given the strong and moderate evidence pointing to an increased risk of conflict. I can reasonably justify this level of deviation from the base rate.

3. **Update magnitude:** The evidence updates are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the strongest evidence (history of US attacks and recent tensions) leading to the largest adjustments, and the weaker evidence (expert predictions and protests) having smaller impacts.

4. **Regression to mean:** I have accounted for the tendency of extreme predictions to miss by not making an overly confident prediction, even though the evidence points to a significant increase in the probability.

## Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, I believe the base rate of 18% may be underestimating the risk of a US attack on Iran before April 2026. The historical precedent of US military actions against Iran and other Middle Eastern countries, combined with the recent escalation of tensions, suggest that the probability of conflict is higher than the base rate indicates.

While the expert predictions and ongoing unrest in Iran provide additional support for an increased probability, I am most concerned about the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation between the two countries. The US and Iran have a long history of antagonism, and the killing of Qasem Soleimani in 2020 demonstrates the potential for sudden, dramatic escalations. Additionally, the US may feel compelled to act if it perceives Iran's nuclear program as a threat, or if domestic political considerations push the administration towards a more confrontational stance.

At the same time, I acknowledge that there are still significant obstacles to a full-scale US military attack on Iran, including the potential for international backlash, the risk of retaliation, and the potential economic and political costs. The Iranian regime may also be deterred from provoking a direct confrontation, given the asymmetry of military power.

Overall, while I believe the probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026 is higher than the base rate suggests, I do not think it is a foregone conclusion. There are still many moving parts, and the situation remains highly volatile and unpredictable.

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: History of US military attacks against Iran and the Middle East, recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: None
- Net direction: UP

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 18.0%
- Total adjustment: +13%
- Final estimate: 31.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 31.0%**
