**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing UP: 
  - The long history of tensions and military confrontations between the US and Iran, including the US destroying Iranian oil platforms and ships in the 1980s, and the US killing Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in 2020, suggesting a high risk of further military escalation.
  - The ongoing protests and unrest in Iran, which have led to a harsh crackdown by the Iranian regime and heightened tensions with the US, making the potential for a US military strike higher.
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN:
  - The US and Iran have shown some willingness to de-escalate tensions in the past, such as when President Trump said the "killing has stopped" in Iran in 2023, suggesting the two sides may still seek to avoid an outright military conflict.
- Net direction: NEUTRAL

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 18.0%
- Total adjustment: +5%
- Final estimate: 23.0%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

**Probability: 23.0%**

As a historian, I see a complex history of conflict and confrontation between the US and Iran, with periods of heightened tensions and military actions, as well as occasional attempts at de-escalation. The current situation, with ongoing protests and unrest in Iran, suggests an elevated risk of a US military strike, but the two sides have also shown a willingness to pull back from the brink in the past.

Looking at historical precedents, the US has a track record of military interventions in the Middle East, including against countries with nuclear capabilities. However, the costs and risks of a direct US attack on Iran, which has a robust military and could retaliate, would be significant. 

Ultimately, while the current evidence points to an increased probability of a US attack on Iran compared to the base rate, the situation remains highly uncertain, and both sides may still seek to avoid an outright military conflict. My final probability estimate, considering the historical context and the latest developments, is 23.0%.

Probability: 23.0%
