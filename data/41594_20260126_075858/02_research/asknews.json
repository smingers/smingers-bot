The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.'

The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters\u2014though Iran\u2019s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei\u2019s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran\u2019s senior officials stated that any attack\u2014limited or unlimited\u2014would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran\u2019s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option\u2014assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran\u2019s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran\u2019s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war\u2014unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 11:47 AM\nSource: [News18](https://www.news18.com/explainers/after-a-short-lived-pause-us-iran-tensions-are-flaring-again-what-triggered-the-escalation-ws-l-9854123.html)\n\n**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**\nThe article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements\u2014including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments\u2014signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump\u2019s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses\u2014raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident\u2014such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack\u2014could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing\u2014often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 10:14 AM\nSource: [Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5393133)\n\n**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**\nA large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.'

Over 500 people have been killed, and widespread property damage has occurred during anti-government demonstrations triggered by economic collapse, inflation, currency devaluation, and subsidy cuts. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the U.S. of instigating the unrest. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump issued multiple threats, including vowing to 'wipe out Iran' and 'obliterate' its nuclear capacity during potential strikes in June 2025, while also calling Khamenei 'a sick man' and demanding new leadership. Iran retaliated with a firm warning: any attack would trigger a full-scale war. The deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group\u2014comprising a central aircraft carrier, escort warships, and fighter jets\u2014near Iran has heightened fears of a major military confrontation. The situation intensified in January 2026, with Trump stating in an interview that 'anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,' and reaffirming in Davos that Iran 'does want to talk, and will talk.' A senior Iranian official declared the U.S. military presence a direct threat and vowed retaliation using 'everything at its disposal.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 07:31 PM\nSource: [Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India](https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-protests-threats-carrier-strike-group-how-us-iran-tensions-escalated-again-3198105)\n\n**Iran's Revolutionary Guard has its \"finger on the trigger,\" leader says, as U.S. warships head toward Middle East**\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, declared the force is 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger,' in a statement reported by Nournews, a media outlet linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on April 18, 2024. This announcement came as U.S. warships, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, moved toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions. President Trump stated the U.S. was deploying a 'massive fleet' 'just in case' he decides to act, warning Iran not to cross two red lines: the killing of peaceful demonstrators and mass executions of detainees. Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters, a claim denied by Iran's top prosecutor, Mohammad Movahedi, via the judiciary's Mizan news agency. The U.S. has previously conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites during Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June 2023, with Trump threatening actions that would make prior strikes 'look like peanuts.' The heightened tensions have prompted at least two European airlines\u2014Air France and Luxair\u2014to suspend or delay flights to Dubai, citing regional airspace insecurity. KLM and Transavia also canceled flights from Amsterdam to Dubai, while some KLM flights to Tel Aviv were canceled. Despite no new protests in Iran for days, the death toll from the December 28, 2023, crackdown on demonstrations\u2014triggered by the rial's collapse\u2014continues to rise. Activist group Human Rights Activists News Agency reported 5,137 deaths and over 27,700 arrests, figures that exceed those from any prior unrest in decades. Iran\u2019s government reported a lower toll of 3,117 deaths, labeling the rest as 'terrorists,' a pattern consistent with past underreporting by Iran\u2019s theocracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 03:19 PM\nSource: [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-protests-warning-warships-middle-east-revolutionary-guard/)\n\n**Why US-Iran Relations Are Deteriorating Again After a Short-Lived Calm?**\nUS-Iran relations have deteriorated again after a brief period of reduced tension, following a surge in internal unrest in Iran that began in late December 2025. The unrest, sparked by economic grievances including high inflation, a collapsing currency, and declining living standards, escalated into widespread political protests. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet and phone blackout on 8 January 2026, aiming to suppress coordination and limit information flow. Activist groups report over 5,000 deaths, though exact figures remain uncertain due to communication restrictions; the Guardian quoted an Iranian official acknowledging thousands died, blaming 'terrorists and armed rioters.' The Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with Kurdish regions experiencing the worst violence. The US response intensified after President Donald Trump declared Washington would 'come to their rescue,' urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions,' and warned that any attack on him would result in 'wiping them off the face of this earth.' On 14 January 2026, the US reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but the operation was halted at the last moment due to pressure from regional allies, including Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned of unpreparedness for retaliation, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who urged caution. A temporary calm followed, with restored internet access, a halt to executions (though Iran\u2019s chief prosecutor denied mass executions were planned), and reduced public protests, though anti-Khamenei slogans persisted in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan. The pause ended when Trump warned of a 'big flotilla' of US warships approaching Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group, which he described as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran responded sharply: military spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would trigger 'war' and that Iran would 'set fire to their world.' Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard stated it has its 'finger on the trigger,' and an Iranian official told Reuters that any attack\u2014limited, surgical, or kinetic\u2014would be considered full-scale war. The US faces uncertain outcomes: limited strikes might embolden protesters and undermine regime confidence, but could also provoke intensified repression. Experts emphasize that Iran\u2019s political future hinges on domestic dynamics, not foreign military intervention. The US carrier group provides strategic leverage, but Iran may respond with calibrated escalation to avoid full war. However, targeting Khamenei would likely trigger an unpredictable and catastrophic conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 12:51 PM\nSource: [The Sunday Guardian Live](https://sundayguardianlive.com/world/why-us-iran-relations-are-deteriorating-again-after-a-short-lived-calm-166114/)\n\n**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**\nTensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict.

If Iran does not comply, the U.S. and Israel are expected to carry out a precise military strike targeting Iranian leadership to overthrow the regime. The expert emphasized that the U.S. military presence in the region is a carefully calculated plan designed to deliver a strike while minimizing potential losses from Iranian retaliation. The deployment includes the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, several destroyers, and fighter jets, which began moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week. This buildup follows heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S., particularly after a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, there are discussions about sending further air defense systems to the region. While such deployments are often framed as defensive, experts note that the U.S. has historically increased military presence before major strikes\u2014such as the June attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\u2014demonstrating a pattern of strategic secrecy and precision.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 12:49 PM\nSource: [\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5579574)\n\n**U.S. military signals imminent intervention in Iran as European officials sound alarm and nations urge evacuations   - NaturalNews.com**\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran have escalated to a critical level, with European officials warning that U.S. military intervention in Iran could occur within days. Direct diplomatic talks between the two nations are suspended, and the U.S. strategy relies on military threats despite long-disputed intelligence indicating no immediate Iranian nuclear threat. The U.S. has begun withdrawing personnel from key regional bases, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and Britain is also pulling staff from a Qatari base. Multiple nations, including the U.S., Poland, and Italy, have issued urgent evacuation advisories for their citizens in Iran, with Italy noting approximately 600 of its nationals remain in Tehran. A senior Iranian official warned that U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey would be attacked if Washington strikes Iran, heightening fears of rapid regional escalation. The crisis is fueled by severe domestic unrest in Iran, described by French officials as 'the most violent repression in Iran's contemporary history,' with anti-government protests\u2014originating from economic grievances\u2014met with deadly crackdowns. Rights groups report thousands of protesters have been killed. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened 'very strong action' against Iran, particularly if executions occur, despite claiming the violence is subsiding based on 'very important sources.' A Western military official noted the U.S. strategy includes unpredictability to keep adversaries and allies off-balance. The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet, but diplomatic channels appear ineffective. The situation risks triggering a global energy crisis, drawing in major powers like Russia and China, and causing massive humanitarian consequences. With no clear exit strategy and escalating military posturing, the Middle East stands on the brink of a potentially unwinnable conflict rooted in disputed threat narratives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 02:01 AM\nSource: [NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2026-01-17-us-military-signals-imminent-intervention-in-iran.html)\n\n**U.S. Aircraft Carrier Approaching Middle East, Iran Faces Tensions Amid Protests and Foreign Threats**\nIn Tehran, Iran, social order has largely stabilized according to Xinhua News Agency reporters, with streets bustling, shops open, and citizens commuting normally. However, the calm is described as potentially fleeting if external powers do not abandon their military interventionist stance. Since late last year, protests have erupted across Iran due to rising prices and currency depreciation, leading to violent riots and severe disruptions in several cities. The Iranian government acknowledged public hardships and pledged to address concerns. The U.S. has repeatedly threatened military intervention under the pretext of 'supporting Iranian protesters.' In some residential areas, residents evacuated to rural homes due to fears of American airstrikes, leaving neighborhoods nearly deserted at night. U.S. media reports indicate that military action has not yet occurred, primarily due to two concerns: the low likelihood of toppling the Iranian regime through force and the risk of triggering widespread retaliation. These concerns could be reduced or eliminated, prompting potential military action. An American aircraft carrier is currently en route to the Middle East and is expected to arrive in about five days. In response to escalating tensions, New Zealand temporarily closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated staff on January 16, while the European Union Aviation Safety Agency advised airlines to avoid Iranian airspace. The combination of external interference and domestic economic struggles has created significant uncertainty. Iran's economic challenges stem not only from domestic mismanagement but also from long-standing U.S.-led economic sanctions. Historical patterns show that reliance on force, pressure, sanctions, and interference only deepen conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Salehi stated in a recent interview with U.S. media that Iran has consistently sought dialogue over the past two decades, but 'the U.S. has repeatedly walked away from negotiations and chosen war instead.' Iran\u2019s military remains on high alert. During a memorial service for victims of recent protests, Mehdi, a gray-haired Tehran resident, declared, 'We will fight to the last drop of blood against the U.S. and Israel.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 01:24 AM\nSource: [\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/international/1000/20260118/49173495.html)\n\n**Erdo\u011fan's Secret Diplomacy 'Froze' the Crisis: How a Trump\u2013Iran Confrontation Was Averted**\nA behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort involving Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan played a critical role in de-escalating a potential conflict between the United States and Iran, according to an article from pagenews.gr. The crisis, described as existential for Iran, was averted through quiet, controlled signals of restraint from Washington, which allowed Tehran time to respond without immediate foreign intervention. The U.S. prioritized avoiding a regional escalation involving Iran, Israel, and American forces, while Iran sought assurance that its violent crackdown would not trigger direct foreign military action. The backchannel diplomacy\u2014characterized as crisis management rather than peace mediation\u2014involved open lines of communication between Ankara, Tehran, and Washington. The process enabled a managed reduction in tensions without a formal resolution, preserving both sides\u2019 dignity and autonomy. However, the article warns that such 'frozen' crises rarely disappear permanently, often returning later in more intense and dangerous forms, as historical patterns in Iran\u2019s foreign relations suggest. The diplomatic quietude was underpinned by mutual self-restraint and strategic patience, with Erdo\u011fan's role described as pivotal in facilitating the indirect dialogue.\nOriginal language: el\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource: [pagenews.gr](https://www.pagenews.gr/2026/01/17/geopolitika/i-mystiki-diplomatia-erntogan-pagose-tin-krisi-pos-apofeuxthike-sygkrousi-tramp-iran/)\n\n**Netanyahu's Plane Lands in Crete: Harbinger of War?**\nOn January 14, 2026, Israel's Boeing 767 government aircraft, known as the 'Wing of Zion' (4X-ISR), landed at Heraklion International Airport on Crete, Greece, after departing from Nevatim Airbase. The aircraft remained for approximately one hour before returning to Israel and landing near Beersheba. Israeli officials, including public broadcaster Kan, described the flight as a routine training mission, a maintenance-related rerouting, or a evacuation drill, and confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not on board, as he was appearing in court in Tel Aviv on corruption charges that day. Despite this, social media and analysts questioned the official explanation, citing historical patterns: the same aircraft had previously been observed moving to Greece shortly before Israel's three recent strikes on Iran in 2025. Analysts suggest such movements may serve as a pre-attack 'standard precaution' or 'signal'. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Aviation Commander General Majid Musavi claimed Iran\u2019s military capacity had fully recovered from the '12-Day War' in June 2025, with increased missile stocks and aviation production surpassing pre-war levels, vowing an overwhelming response to any attack. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all planned meetings with Iranian officials were canceled, citing 'senseless killings of protesters', and called on the Iranian people to continue protests, urging them to record the names of 'killers and tyrants' and stating, 'Help is on the way.' This message came amid ongoing anti-regime protests in Iran, where human rights groups report over 2,000 deaths. While official sources maintain the Crete flight was part of a scheduled annual maintenance program, open-source intelligence (OSINT) accounts and international outlets interpret the movement as a potential indicator of escalating regional tensions, especially given the aircraft\u2019s prior behavior before major military actions. Although mainstream media has not yet established a direct link between this flight and an imminent military operation, the convergence of Iran\u2019s military posturing, Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and historical flight patterns has intensified speculation that the flight may signal an impending large-scale conflict.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 07:49 PM\nSource: [Haber7.com](https://www.haber7.com/dunya/haber/3596102-netanyahunun-ucagi-girite-indi-savasin-habercisi-mi)\n\n**United States and the 'Pizz\u00f3metro': The Unexpected Signal That Anticipated the Attack on Venezuela**\nIn the hours preceding a U.S. military operation in Venezuela and the capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, an informal phenomenon known as the 'Pentagon pizz\u00f3metro' resurfaced, drawing attention from analysts and social media users. This theory suggests that a sudden spike in pizza orders near key U.S. government sites\u2014such as the Pentagon, the White House, and the Department of Defense\u2014serves as an indirect signal of heightened national security alert. A notable surge occurred at Pizzato Pizza, a restaurant near the Pentagon, with a sharp increase in orders around 2 a.m., an unusual time even for 24-hour establishments. The theory is based on the idea that during critical operations, security personnel work extended shifts with no time for meals, making pizza a practical, quick option. This pattern has historical roots: during the Cold War, Soviet intelligence reportedly monitored pizza delivery drivers in Washington, D.C., to gauge activity at sensitive agencies. A well-documented example occurred in 1990, when a spike in deliveries to CIA-linked buildings preceded Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a precursor to the Gulf War. The Soviets referred to this informal intelligence method as 'Pizzint.' Similar patterns were observed during the 1998 impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton and in April 2024 during an Iranian drone attack on Israel. On January 2, 2026, another surge in pizza orders was recorded near federal facilities, coinciding with the Venezuela operation. A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) shared a real-time Google Maps screenshot showing Pizzato Pizza saturated around 6 p.m. local time, with demand far exceeding normal levels. Nearby Papa John's locations near the Department of Defense reported order increases of up to 770%. The pizz\u00f3metro has thus become a recurring, unofficial indicator of geopolitical tension, symbolizing that when power enters crisis mode, even cooking is sacrificed for urgency.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 02:00 AM\nSource: [TVN](https://www.tvn-2.com/entretenimiento/estados-unidos-pizzometro-senal-inesperada-anticipo-ataque-venezuela_1_2221615.html)\n\n**The Spectator Warns: Prepare for 'No Peace, No War' in the Middle East by 2026**\nA report by the British publication 'The Spectator' warns that the Middle East is heading toward a state of 'no peace, no war' by 2026, characterized by persistent instability. The article highlights that despite former U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of imminent peace in the region due to his deal-making prowess, the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict continues to undermine stability and prevent the establishment of a durable political system. The term 'no peace, no war'\u2014an Anglo-Saxon concept describing the threshold between open conflict and stability\u2014is described as historically familiar to Middle Eastern populations. The region's deep-rooted challenges\u2014transnational social structures, contested borders, sectarian tensions, and tightly linked economic-political power\u2014have long prevented the kind of stability provided by broadly legitimate systems. Historical patterns show repeated cycles of conflict: 27 years of Arab-Jewish hostilities preceded the 1947 civil war, followed by the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, then the Six-Day War (1967), War of Attrition, and Yom Kippur War. In Gaza, the 2005 Israeli withdrawal did not bring peace but instead triggered 10 rounds of fighting over 17 years between Israel and Hamas. The article argues that the root cause of the conflict remains unaddressed, making lasting political change impossible. Trump\u2019s diplomatic vision centers on replacing weapons with 'work cards' through U.S. political and economic leverage, urging regional actors to set aside differences. However, Israel views these initiatives as peripheral or even harmful, as the decisive victory over Iran remains unachieved. Iran continues to expand its military capabilities: it has conducted nuclear activities, including at suspected undeclared enrichment facilities, and has developed a missile deterrent based on retaliation. Missile production is intensifying, with mobile launch platforms replacing fixed silos, and a nationwide missile drill was held recently. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has surrounded himself with a younger military team viewing the conflict with Israel as a national humiliation to be overcome. Hardline factions are vying for influence in the upcoming May local elections, aiming to shape the selection of four new members of the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which will choose Khamenei\u2019s successor. The article notes that the Iran-Israel conflict is entering a new phase, as signaled by Israeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir on June 24\u2014a date also marking Trump\u2019s ceasefire, which Israeli officials deemed premature. In the past month, Israeli rhetoric has intensified regarding Iran\u2019s growing missile capacity, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to present military options to Trump in Miami. Revolutionary Guards-linked social media continuously reference the 'next round.' While Trump envisions a new regional order based on political and economic agreements, Israel remains wary of potential setbacks to its recent military gains. The paradox is that Trump\u2019s grand plan may depend on further actions to halt Iran\u2019s military rebuilding. The report concludes that 2026 will likely be a turbulent year in the Middle East, though the exact degree of disruption remains uncertain. Military operations in Syria may slow but not cease entirely, and the White House is expected to approve additional Israeli actions against Iran, believing such moves will not derail the broader peace agenda. Afterward, 'all possibilities remain open.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 25, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource: [Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/world-news/1459649/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%80the-spectator-%D9%8A%D9%8F%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%80%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7)\n\n**Is Washington Preventing an Israeli Escalation?**\nLeveraging insights from informed sources, the article details escalating tensions in Lebanon, with growing indications of a potential large-scale Israeli military operation against Hezbollah, possibly involving a series of concentrated airstrikes rather than a prolonged ground war. The U.S. administration is reportedly engaged in serious internal discussions about this scenario, which is framed as a 'wide but limited' operation aimed at weakening Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities\u2014targeting infrastructure and key leadership\u2014without immediately triggering a full-scale regional war. However, sources warn that such a limited strike could rapidly spiral out of control, particularly if Iran perceives Hezbollah as facing an existential threat, potentially prompting direct Iranian intervention or the opening of additional fronts. While the U.S. remains reluctant to support a prolonged or open-ended war due to economic and political costs, it may grant Israel a 'limited window' for targeted airstrikes. The article underscores the inherent risk in assuming such operations can remain contained, citing historical patterns in the region where limited actions have led to uncontrollable escalations. Lebanon\u2019s fragile political and military state makes it highly vulnerable to any major shock. Despite ongoing backchannel diplomacy and international mediation efforts, the trajectory of tension suggests a rising likelihood of escalation, with the next phase potentially marking a decisive turning point\u2014especially if the U.S. formally approves such airstrikes. The article concludes that Lebanon stands at a critical juncture, where any reckless move could trigger a regional conflict extending far beyond southern Lebanon.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource: [Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/lebanon/1449791/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%9F)\n\n**Pentagon Pizza Orders Surge Amid Rising Tensions: Is the U.S. Preparing for Military Action Against Venezuela?**\nTensions between the United States and Venezuela have intensified, with former U.S. President Donald Trump issuing a warning on November 29, 2025, via his social media platform 'Truth Social', calling for all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers to treat the airspace over and around Venezuela as fully closed. This statement was interpreted as an informal blockade targeting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government, which Venezuela labeled a 'colonialist threat'. International airlines canceled flights in response. The U.S. has framed any potential military action as part of a campaign against narco-terrorism, citing drug cartels' air routes. Concurrently, a surge in pizza orders at a Domino's near the Pentagon has reignited the 'Pentagon Pizza Theory'\u2014a historical anecdote suggesting that spikes in late-night pizza orders at the Pentagon correlate with major global events. Historical precedents include the Gulf War in 1990, the Panama invasion in 1998, and the Israel-Iran conflict in June 2025, all of which preceded significant military actions. U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly identified potential cartel sites along the Venezuela-Colombia border, and the U.S. has conducted at least 21 strikes in the Caribbean and Latin America region in recent days, resulting in over 80 deaths. While the U.S. has stated no ground invasion plans, the closure of airspace and increased military activity suggest a major decision may be underway in Washington. Experts note this pattern echoes Trump\u2019s 2019 designation of Venezuela as a 'narco-state'. The combination of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, intelligence activity, and the pizza order spike has fueled speculation that history may be repeating itself.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 09:06 AM\nSource: [Prabhat Khabar - Hindi News](https://www.prabhatkhabar.com/world/pentagon-pizza-orders-surge-raises-alarm-of-attack-on-venezuela-will-donald-trump-and-us-repeat-history)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Past Patterns Suggest Limited Military Action, Rapid De-escalation in Potential Venezuela Conflict**\nThe article by Mauricio Meschoulam analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior\u2014particularly his use of limited military force followed by rapid de-escalation\u2014to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible second Trump administration. Drawing on past actions in Syria (2017\u20132018), Iran (2019\u20132020), Afghanistan (2018\u20132021), Yemen (2025), and Iran again in June 2025, the author identifies a consistent strategy: launching targeted, high-impact strikes to project strength and deter adversaries\u2014especially Russia and China\u2014while avoiding prolonged conflicts. These operations, described as 'hit and run' tactics, are designed to demonstrate resolve without committing to long-term military engagement. The article notes that Trump\u2019s approach is shaped by his 'America First' doctrine and the influence of key figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who advocates a more interventionist stance in Latin America. The current massive U.S. naval deployment near Venezuela\u2014its largest since 1989\u2014is interpreted as a prelude to potential limited strikes against Venezuelan infrastructure linked to drug trafficking or state-backed criminal networks. However, the author argues Trump is likely to avoid full-scale war, instead seeking a negotiated outcome\u2014such as concessions on resource access or a transition of power\u2014after demonstrating force. The final outcome will depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including tensions between isolationist and interventionist factions within Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Pentagon. The article concludes that while military action is possible, Trump is expected to de-escalate quickly if the situation becomes complex or resource-intensive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 06:52 AM\nSource: [El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/opinion/mauricio-meschoulam/venezuela-eu-que-nos-dice-el-historial-de-trump-sobre-lo-que-podria-venir/)\n\n"
