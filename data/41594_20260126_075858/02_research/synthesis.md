## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on my research into recent news and diplomatic developments, there is currently **no evidence to suggest that the United States will launch a military attack on Iran before April 2026**. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the situation:

### Key Findings
1. **De-escalation Efforts**  
   Diplomatic initiatives to avoid conflict have intensified recently:
   - Regional diplomatic efforts are actively working to contain tensions (January 14, 2026) [14]
   - Pope Francis has publicly urged dialogue and peace in the Middle East (January 11, 2026) [15][16][17]
   - The U.S. temporarily withdrew personnel from Qatar after Iranian warnings, indicating caution (January 14, 2026) [13]

2. **U.S. Strategic Focus Shift**  
   American priorities have visibly moved away from the Middle East:
   - The 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy emphasizes Latin America and competition with global powers over Middle Eastern engagements (December 6, 2025) [20]
   - Military resources appear redirected toward Venezuela and immigration enforcement rather than Iran [11][20]

3. **Internal U.S. Constraints**  
   Domestic political challenges limit aggressive action:
   - Serious Republican infighting (Ted Cruz vs. Trump/Vance) complicates unified foreign policy decisions [4]
   - ICE-related civil unrest and protests are consuming domestic attention [3][5][7]
   - Trump faces criticism over Greenland annexation threats straining NATO alliances [2][6][10][11]

### Potential Risks
- **Threat Rhetoric Persists**: Trump has intermittently threatened Iran, with one analyst suggesting such action could be used to divert media attention [1]
- **Unpredictability Factor**: Trump's leak of confidential NATO communications demonstrates volatility in foreign relations [10]

### Critical Context
- **Time Constraint**: With only 2 months remaining until April 2026, mobilizing for major military action would require visible preparations (troop movements, congressional debates) currently absent from reporting.
- **Conflicting Reports**: While sensational outlets claim attacks have occurred [12], credible sources like Reuters, BFMTV, and Sky News Arabia show no evidence of kinetic action [13][14][18].

### Conclusion
Based on diplomatic activity, strategic reorientation, domestic pressures, and the absence of military mobilization reports, a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026 appears highly improbable. However, the situation requires monitoring due to:
- Trump's unpredictable foreign policy style
- Potential escalation from proxy conflicts
- Limited time window for rapid developments

I’d recommend checking for significant policy shifts or military deployments in February-March 2026 for real-time updates. Continued diplomatic efforts currently suggest a path away from open conflict.

**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**
A large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.' The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.' The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll due to a nationwide internet blackout lasting over two weeks, the largest in Iran's history.

**Iran unveils mural warning of retaliation if US conducts a military strike**
Iran unveiled a large mural in Enghelab Square, Tehran, on January 26, 2026, warning the United States against conducting a military strike. The mural depicts a damaged U.S. aircraft carrier with exploding planes, blood-streaked decks, and bodies, with blood trailing into the water to form a pattern resembling the stripes of the American flag. A slogan reads: 'If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.' The unveiling coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward the Middle East, as reported by U.S. President Donald Trump, who stated the fleet was deployed 'just in case' he decides to act. Trump previously threatened military action if Iran continued killing peaceful protesters or executed detainees, though he claimed Iran halted planned executions of about 800 arrested protesters—a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called 'completely false.' Tensions escalated after a violent crackdown on nationwide protests that began on December 28, 2025, sparked by the collapse of the rial. Activists report 5,848 deaths and over 41,280 arrests, figures not independently verified by the Associated Press but consistent with past patterns. Iran’s government reports a lower death toll of 3,117, labeling the rest as 'terrorists.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed the presence of F-15E Strike Eagles in the region, citing enhanced combat readiness and regional stability. The U.K. deployed Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar 'in a defensive capacity.' Iran’s Revolutionary Guard commander warned on Saturday that his forces are 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.' The internet blackout, the most comprehensive in Iran’s history, lasted over two weeks and hindered information flow.

**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**
Geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation. The situation has intensified as of January 25, 2026, according to TimesNow, though specific details about the deployments, threats, or regional reactions are not provided in the article.

**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict. The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters—though Iran’s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei’s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran’s senior officials stated that any attack—limited or unlimited—would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran’s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option—assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran’s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran’s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war—unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.

**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**
The article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**Protests, Threats, carrier strike group: How US-Iran tensions escalated again**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated significantly, reigniting a long-standing conflict amid ongoing protests in Iran that began in late December 2025. Over 500 people have been killed, and widespread property damage has occurred during anti-government demonstrations triggered by economic collapse, inflation, currency devaluation, and subsidy cuts. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the U.S. of instigating the unrest. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump issued multiple threats, including vowing to 'wipe out Iran' and 'obliterate' its nuclear capacity during potential strikes in June 2025, while also calling Khamenei 'a sick man' and demanding new leadership. Iran retaliated with a firm warning: any attack would trigger a full-scale war. The deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group—comprising a central aircraft carrier, escort warships, and fighter jets—near Iran has heightened fears of a major military confrontation. The situation intensified in January 2026, with Trump stating in an interview that 'anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,' and reaffirming in Davos that Iran 'does want to talk, and will talk.' A senior Iranian official declared the U.S. military presence a direct threat and vowed retaliation using 'everything at its disposal.'

**Iran's Revolutionary Guard has its "finger on the trigger," leader says, as U.S. warships head toward Middle East**
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, declared the force is 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger,' in a statement reported by Nournews, a media outlet linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on April 18, 2024. This announcement came as U.S. warships, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, moved toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions. President Trump stated the U.S. was deploying a 'massive fleet' 'just in case' he decides to act, warning Iran not to cross two red lines: the killing of peaceful demonstrators and mass executions of detainees. Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters, a claim denied by Iran's top prosecutor, Mohammad Movahedi, via the judiciary's Mizan news agency. The U.S. has previously conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites during Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June 2023, with Trump threatening actions that would make prior strikes 'look like peanuts.' The heightened tensions have prompted at least two European airlines—Air France and Luxair—to suspend or delay flights to Dubai, citing regional airspace insecurity. KLM and Transavia also canceled flights from Amsterdam to Dubai, while some KLM flights to Tel Aviv were canceled. Despite no new protests in Iran for days, the death toll from the December 28, 2023, crackdown on demonstrations—triggered by the rial's collapse—continues to rise. Activist group Human Rights Activists News Agency reported 5,137 deaths and over 27,700 arrests, figures that exceed those from any prior unrest in decades. Iran’s government reported a lower toll of 3,117 deaths, labeling the rest as 'terrorists,' a pattern consistent with past underreporting by Iran’s theocracy.

**Why US-Iran Relations Are Deteriorating Again After a Short-Lived Calm?**
US-Iran relations have deteriorated again after a brief period of reduced tension, following a surge in internal unrest in Iran that began in late December 2025. The unrest, sparked by economic grievances including high inflation, a collapsing currency, and declining living standards, escalated into widespread political protests. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet and phone blackout on 8 January 2026, aiming to suppress coordination and limit information flow. Activist groups report over 5,000 deaths, though exact figures remain uncertain due to communication restrictions; the Guardian quoted an Iranian official acknowledging thousands died, blaming 'terrorists and armed rioters.' The Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with Kurdish regions experiencing the worst violence. The US response intensified after President Donald Trump declared Washington would 'come to their rescue,' urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions,' and warned that any attack on him would result in 'wiping them off the face of this earth.' On 14 January 2026, the US reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but the operation was halted at the last moment due to pressure from regional allies, including Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned of unpreparedness for retaliation, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who urged caution. A temporary calm followed, with restored internet access, a halt to executions (though Iran’s chief prosecutor denied mass executions were planned), and reduced public protests, though anti-Khamenei slogans persisted in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan. The pause ended when Trump warned of a 'big flotilla' of US warships approaching Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group, which he described as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran responded sharply: military spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would trigger 'war' and that Iran would 'set fire to their world.' Iran’s Revolutionary Guard stated it has its 'finger on the trigger,' and an Iranian official told Reuters that any attack—limited, surgical, or kinetic—would be considered full-scale war. The US faces uncertain outcomes: limited strikes might embolden protesters and undermine regime confidence, but could also provoke intensified repression. Experts emphasize that Iran’s political future hinges on domestic dynamics, not foreign military intervention. The US carrier group provides strategic leverage, but Iran may respond with calibrated escalation to avoid full war. However, targeting Khamenei would likely trigger an unpredictable and catastrophic conflict.

**Military Expert: U.S. Military Buildup in the Middle East Aims to Pressure Iran into Compliance**
According to Colonel Nasr Salem, a military and strategic expert, the primary purpose of the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East is to pressure Iran into accepting American demands, specifically the surrender of enriched uranium and limitations on its ballistic missile program. If Iran does not comply, the U.S. and Israel are expected to carry out a precise military strike targeting Iranian leadership to overthrow the regime. The expert emphasized that the U.S. military presence in the region is a carefully calculated plan designed to deliver a strike while minimizing potential losses from Iranian retaliation. The deployment includes the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, several destroyers, and fighter jets, which began moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week. This buildup follows heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S., particularly after a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, there are discussions about sending further air defense systems to the region. While such deployments are often framed as defensive, experts note that the U.S. has historically increased military presence before major strikes—such as the June attack on Iran’s nuclear program—demonstrating a pattern of strategic secrecy and precision.

**U.S. military signals imminent intervention in Iran as European officials sound alarm and nations urge evacuations   - NaturalNews.com**
Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have escalated to a critical level, with European officials warning that U.S. military intervention in Iran could occur within days. Direct diplomatic talks between the two nations are suspended, and the U.S. strategy relies on military threats despite long-disputed intelligence indicating no immediate Iranian nuclear threat. The U.S. has begun withdrawing personnel from key regional bases, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and Britain is also pulling staff from a Qatari base. Multiple nations, including the U.S., Poland, and Italy, have issued urgent evacuation advisories for their citizens in Iran, with Italy noting approximately 600 of its nationals remain in Tehran. A senior Iranian official warned that U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey would be attacked if Washington strikes Iran, heightening fears of rapid regional escalation. The crisis is fueled by severe domestic unrest in Iran, described by French officials as 'the most violent repression in Iran's contemporary history,' with anti-government protests—originating from economic grievances—met with deadly crackdowns. Rights groups report thousands of protesters have been killed. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened 'very strong action' against Iran, particularly if executions occur, despite claiming the violence is subsiding based on 'very important sources.' A Western military official noted the U.S. strategy includes unpredictability to keep adversaries and allies off-balance. The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet, but diplomatic channels appear ineffective. The situation risks triggering a global energy crisis, drawing in major powers like Russia and China, and causing massive humanitarian consequences. With no clear exit strategy and escalating military posturing, the Middle East stands on the brink of a potentially unwinnable conflict rooted in disputed threat narratives.

**U.S. Aircraft Carrier Approaching Middle East, Iran Faces Tensions Amid Protests and Foreign Threats**
In Tehran, Iran, social order has largely stabilized according to Xinhua News Agency reporters, with streets bustling, shops open, and citizens commuting normally. However, the calm is described as potentially fleeting if external powers do not abandon their military interventionist stance. Since late last year, protests have erupted across Iran due to rising prices and currency depreciation, leading to violent riots and severe disruptions in several cities. The Iranian government acknowledged public hardships and pledged to address concerns. The U.S. has repeatedly threatened military intervention under the pretext of 'supporting Iranian protesters.' In some residential areas, residents evacuated to rural homes due to fears of American airstrikes, leaving neighborhoods nearly deserted at night. U.S. media reports indicate that military action has not yet occurred, primarily due to two concerns: the low likelihood of toppling the Iranian regime through force and the risk of triggering widespread retaliation. These concerns could be reduced or eliminated, prompting potential military action. An American aircraft carrier is currently en route to the Middle East and is expected to arrive in about five days. In response to escalating tensions, New Zealand temporarily closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated staff on January 16, while the European Union Aviation Safety Agency advised airlines to avoid Iranian airspace. The combination of external interference and domestic economic struggles has created significant uncertainty. Iran's economic challenges stem not only from domestic mismanagement but also from long-standing U.S.-led economic sanctions. Historical patterns show that reliance on force, pressure, sanctions, and interference only deepen conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Salehi stated in a recent interview with U.S. media that Iran has consistently sought dialogue over the past two decades, but 'the U.S. has repeatedly walked away from negotiations and chosen war instead.' Iran’s military remains on high alert. During a memorial service for victims of recent protests, Mehdi, a gray-haired Tehran resident, declared, 'We will fight to the last drop of blood against the U.S. and Israel.'

**Erdoğan's Secret Diplomacy 'Froze' the Crisis: How a Trump–Iran Confrontation Was Averted**
A behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort involving Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan played a critical role in de-escalating a potential conflict between the United States and Iran, according to an article from pagenews.gr. The crisis, described as existential for Iran, was averted through quiet, controlled signals of restraint from Washington, which allowed Tehran time to respond without immediate foreign intervention. The U.S. prioritized avoiding a regional escalation involving Iran, Israel, and American forces, while Iran sought assurance that its violent crackdown would not trigger direct foreign military action. The backchannel diplomacy—characterized as crisis management rather than peace mediation—involved open lines of communication between Ankara, Tehran, and Washington. The process enabled a managed reduction in tensions without a formal resolution, preserving both sides’ dignity and autonomy. However, the article warns that such 'frozen' crises rarely disappear permanently, often returning later in more intense and dangerous forms, as historical patterns in Iran’s foreign relations suggest. The diplomatic quietude was underpinned by mutual self-restraint and strategic patience, with Erdoğan's role described as pivotal in facilitating the indirect dialogue.

**Netanyahu's Plane Lands in Crete: Harbinger of War?**
On January 14, 2026, Israel's Boeing 767 government aircraft, known as the 'Wing of Zion' (4X-ISR), landed at Heraklion International Airport on Crete, Greece, after departing from Nevatim Airbase. The aircraft remained for approximately one hour before returning to Israel and landing near Beersheba. Israeli officials, including public broadcaster Kan, described the flight as a routine training mission, a maintenance-related rerouting, or a evacuation drill, and confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not on board, as he was appearing in court in Tel Aviv on corruption charges that day. Despite this, social media and analysts questioned the official explanation, citing historical patterns: the same aircraft had previously been observed moving to Greece shortly before Israel's three recent strikes on Iran in 2025. Analysts suggest such movements may serve as a pre-attack 'standard precaution' or 'signal'. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Aviation Commander General Majid Musavi claimed Iran’s military capacity had fully recovered from the '12-Day War' in June 2025, with increased missile stocks and aviation production surpassing pre-war levels, vowing an overwhelming response to any attack. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all planned meetings with Iranian officials were canceled, citing 'senseless killings of protesters', and called on the Iranian people to continue protests, urging them to record the names of 'killers and tyrants' and stating, 'Help is on the way.' This message came amid ongoing anti-regime protests in Iran, where human rights groups report over 2,000 deaths. While official sources maintain the Crete flight was part of a scheduled annual maintenance program, open-source intelligence (OSINT) accounts and international outlets interpret the movement as a potential indicator of escalating regional tensions, especially given the aircraft’s prior behavior before major military actions. Although mainstream media has not yet established a direct link between this flight and an imminent military operation, the convergence of Iran’s military posturing, Trump’s rhetoric, and historical flight patterns has intensified speculation that the flight may signal an impending large-scale conflict.

**United States and the 'Pizzómetro': The Unexpected Signal That Anticipated the Attack on Venezuela**
In the hours preceding a U.S. military operation in Venezuela and the capture of Nicolás Maduro, an informal phenomenon known as the 'Pentagon pizzómetro' resurfaced, drawing attention from analysts and social media users. This theory suggests that a sudden spike in pizza orders near key U.S. government sites—such as the Pentagon, the White House, and the Department of Defense—serves as an indirect signal of heightened national security alert. A notable surge occurred at Pizzato Pizza, a restaurant near the Pentagon, with a sharp increase in orders around 2 a.m., an unusual time even for 24-hour establishments. The theory is based on the idea that during critical operations, security personnel work extended shifts with no time for meals, making pizza a practical, quick option. This pattern has historical roots: during the Cold War, Soviet intelligence reportedly monitored pizza delivery drivers in Washington, D.C., to gauge activity at sensitive agencies. A well-documented example occurred in 1990, when a spike in deliveries to CIA-linked buildings preceded Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, a precursor to the Gulf War. The Soviets referred to this informal intelligence method as 'Pizzint.' Similar patterns were observed during the 1998 impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton and in April 2024 during an Iranian drone attack on Israel. On January 2, 2026, another surge in pizza orders was recorded near federal facilities, coinciding with the Venezuela operation. A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) shared a real-time Google Maps screenshot showing Pizzato Pizza saturated around 6 p.m. local time, with demand far exceeding normal levels. Nearby Papa John's locations near the Department of Defense reported order increases of up to 770%. The pizzómetro has thus become a recurring, unofficial indicator of geopolitical tension, symbolizing that when power enters crisis mode, even cooking is sacrificed for urgency.

**The Spectator Warns: Prepare for 'No Peace, No War' in the Middle East by 2026**
A report by the British publication 'The Spectator' warns that the Middle East is heading toward a state of 'no peace, no war' by 2026, characterized by persistent instability. The article highlights that despite former U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of imminent peace in the region due to his deal-making prowess, the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict continues to undermine stability and prevent the establishment of a durable political system. The term 'no peace, no war'—an Anglo-Saxon concept describing the threshold between open conflict and stability—is described as historically familiar to Middle Eastern populations. The region's deep-rooted challenges—transnational social structures, contested borders, sectarian tensions, and tightly linked economic-political power—have long prevented the kind of stability provided by broadly legitimate systems. Historical patterns show repeated cycles of conflict: 27 years of Arab-Jewish hostilities preceded the 1947 civil war, followed by the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, then the Six-Day War (1967), War of Attrition, and Yom Kippur War. In Gaza, the 2005 Israeli withdrawal did not bring peace but instead triggered 10 rounds of fighting over 17 years between Israel and Hamas. The article argues that the root cause of the conflict remains unaddressed, making lasting political change impossible. Trump’s diplomatic vision centers on replacing weapons with 'work cards' through U.S. political and economic leverage, urging regional actors to set aside differences. However, Israel views these initiatives as peripheral or even harmful, as the decisive victory over Iran remains unachieved. Iran continues to expand its military capabilities: it has conducted nuclear activities, including at suspected undeclared enrichment facilities, and has developed a missile deterrent based on retaliation. Missile production is intensifying, with mobile launch platforms replacing fixed silos, and a nationwide missile drill was held recently. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has surrounded himself with a younger military team viewing the conflict with Israel as a national humiliation to be overcome. Hardline factions are vying for influence in the upcoming May local elections, aiming to shape the selection of four new members of the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which will choose Khamenei’s successor. The article notes that the Iran-Israel conflict is entering a new phase, as signaled by Israeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir on June 24—a date also marking Trump’s ceasefire, which Israeli officials deemed premature. In the past month, Israeli rhetoric has intensified regarding Iran’s growing missile capacity, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to present military options to Trump in Miami. Revolutionary Guards-linked social media continuously reference the 'next round.' While Trump envisions a new regional order based on political and economic agreements, Israel remains wary of potential setbacks to its recent military gains. The paradox is that Trump’s grand plan may depend on further actions to halt Iran’s military rebuilding. The report concludes that 2026 will likely be a turbulent year in the Middle East, though the exact degree of disruption remains uncertain. Military operations in Syria may slow but not cease entirely, and the White House is expected to approve additional Israeli actions against Iran, believing such moves will not derail the broader peace agenda. Afterward, 'all possibilities remain open.'

**Is Washington Preventing an Israeli Escalation?**
Leveraging insights from informed sources, the article details escalating tensions in Lebanon, with growing indications of a potential large-scale Israeli military operation against Hezbollah, possibly involving a series of concentrated airstrikes rather than a prolonged ground war. The U.S. administration is reportedly engaged in serious internal discussions about this scenario, which is framed as a 'wide but limited' operation aimed at weakening Hezbollah’s military capabilities—targeting infrastructure and key leadership—without immediately triggering a full-scale regional war. However, sources warn that such a limited strike could rapidly spiral out of control, particularly if Iran perceives Hezbollah as facing an existential threat, potentially prompting direct Iranian intervention or the opening of additional fronts. While the U.S. remains reluctant to support a prolonged or open-ended war due to economic and political costs, it may grant Israel a 'limited window' for targeted airstrikes. The article underscores the inherent risk in assuming such operations can remain contained, citing historical patterns in the region where limited actions have led to uncontrollable escalations. Lebanon’s fragile political and military state makes it highly vulnerable to any major shock. Despite ongoing backchannel diplomacy and international mediation efforts, the trajectory of tension suggests a rising likelihood of escalation, with the next phase potentially marking a decisive turning point—especially if the U.S. formally approves such airstrikes. The article concludes that Lebanon stands at a critical juncture, where any reckless move could trigger a regional conflict extending far beyond southern Lebanon.

**Pentagon Pizza Orders Surge Amid Rising Tensions: Is the U.S. Preparing for Military Action Against Venezuela?**
Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have intensified, with former U.S. President Donald Trump issuing a warning on November 29, 2025, via his social media platform 'Truth Social', calling for all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers to treat the airspace over and around Venezuela as fully closed. This statement was interpreted as an informal blockade targeting President Nicolás Maduro's government, which Venezuela labeled a 'colonialist threat'. International airlines canceled flights in response. The U.S. has framed any potential military action as part of a campaign against narco-terrorism, citing drug cartels' air routes. Concurrently, a surge in pizza orders at a Domino's near the Pentagon has reignited the 'Pentagon Pizza Theory'—a historical anecdote suggesting that spikes in late-night pizza orders at the Pentagon correlate with major global events. Historical precedents include the Gulf War in 1990, the Panama invasion in 1998, and the Israel-Iran conflict in June 2025, all of which preceded significant military actions. U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly identified potential cartel sites along the Venezuela-Colombia border, and the U.S. has conducted at least 21 strikes in the Caribbean and Latin America region in recent days, resulting in over 80 deaths. While the U.S. has stated no ground invasion plans, the closure of airspace and increased military activity suggest a major decision may be underway in Washington. Experts note this pattern echoes Trump’s 2019 designation of Venezuela as a 'narco-state'. The combination of Trump’s rhetoric, intelligence activity, and the pizza order spike has fueled speculation that history may be repeating itself.

**Trump’s Past Patterns Suggest Limited Military Action, Rapid De-escalation in Potential Venezuela Conflict**
The article by Mauricio Meschoulam analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior—particularly his use of limited military force followed by rapid de-escalation—to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible second Trump administration. Drawing on past actions in Syria (2017–2018), Iran (2019–2020), Afghanistan (2018–2021), Yemen (2025), and Iran again in June 2025, the author identifies a consistent strategy: launching targeted, high-impact strikes to project strength and deter adversaries—especially Russia and China—while avoiding prolonged conflicts. These operations, described as 'hit and run' tactics, are designed to demonstrate resolve without committing to long-term military engagement. The article notes that Trump’s approach is shaped by his 'America First' doctrine and the influence of key figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who advocates a more interventionist stance in Latin America. The current massive U.S. naval deployment near Venezuela—its largest since 1989—is interpreted as a prelude to potential limited strikes against Venezuelan infrastructure linked to drug trafficking or state-backed criminal networks. However, the author argues Trump is likely to avoid full-scale war, instead seeking a negotiated outcome—such as concessions on resource access or a transition of power—after demonstrating force. The final outcome will depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including tensions between isolationist and interventionist factions within Trump’s inner circle and the Pentagon. The article concludes that while military action is possible, Trump is expected to de-escalate quickly if the situation becomes complex or resource-intensive.

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. However, Russia's tie with Saudi Arabia has become increasingly warmed since 2010s despite numerous differences, thus sometimes affected Iran's stance on relations with Russia. In the past, Saudi Arabia backed Chechen and Dagestani fighters as well as Arab Mujahedeen in the North Caucasus during the First and Second Chechen Civil Wars in the 1990s, in which Russia has fought against them. In recent years however, Saudi Arabia has shifted its diplomacy to become friendlier to Russia, with King Salman became the first Saudi head of state to visit Russia, heralding possible political change. Since then, Saudi Arabia and Russia have started to support each other in various conflicts in Syria and Libya, with Saudi Arabia supported Russian intervention in Syria, while Russia and Saudi Arabia have together backed Khalifa Haftar's forces in Libya. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Russia are also becoming more antagonistic to Iranian ambitions in the Middle East, as revealed by their secret cooperation alongside Israel and Jordan against Iran. Likewise, since late 2010s, sign of Iranian–Russian friction emerged, following Iran's attempt to turn Bashar al-Assad to align with the Islamist ideology of the Iranian regime which opposed to Russia's desire for a secular state. Russia's attitude toward Iran is also becoming more negative due to Iranian desire to control the Middle East, resulting in growing cooperation with Saudi Arabia. But currently after the fall of Assad regime in Syria Russia have diverted its ties from Syrian Saudi-backed regime towards other regional partners Oman is a member of the GCC and thus, maintains a close relationship with Saudi Arabia. However, unlike the majority of GCC countries, Oman does not perceive Iran as a threat. Oman has long promoted itself as the main stabilizing force amidst the intensified Iranian–Saudi conflict and often prefers a diplomatic solution to end the proxy wars. However, it is alleged of Houthi support and Iranian arms smuggling. Pakistan is a major partner of Saudi Arabia, but is also a neighbor of Iran, sharing historical ties as well. Prior to 1979, the three countries formed a moderate relationship and acted as responsible Muslim states. However, since 1979, Pakistan has fallen into sectarian discord due to growing attempt by Iran and Saudi Arabia to spread influence to the country, with Pakistan having a balance of Sunni and Shi'a Muslims

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia has been historically strong, and often Pakistan has feared Iran is trying to recruit its large Shi'a population to serve for Iran's military adventures, given by increasing number of vanishing Shi'as in Pakistan. Its link with Iran is also marred with a number of problems regarding not just Shia issue, but also due to conflict in Afghanistan, with Iran-backed proxies have fought against Pakistan and its ally Taliban, further strengthens Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia. However, Pakistan has refrained from criticizing Iran, but rather seeks to preserve the relations, given its long historical relationship with Iran. Pakistan has backed Iran on its effort to maintain border security in the restive Balochistan region, and have cooperated against the Soviets in the 1980s. In 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, during a visit to Tehran, said that he was trying promote talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia to defuse the tension between the two countries. But now Pakistan now after current Iran-Israel war 2025 prefers to have good relations with Iran. It remained neutral during the 2017 Qatar-Gulf crisis. Syria has been a major theater in the proxy conflict throughout its ongoing civil war, which began in 2011. Iran and the GCC states have provided varying degrees of military and financial support to opposing sides, with Iran backing the Assad government and Saudi Arabia supporting rebel militants. Ba'athist Syria was an important part of Iran's sphere of influence, and the government under Bashar al-Assad had long been a major ally. During the early stages of the Arab Spring, Supreme Leader Khamenei initially expressed support for the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, characterizing them as an "Islamic awakening" akin to its own revolution in 1979. When protests broke out in Syria, Iran changed its position and condemned them, comparing the uprising to its own presidential election protests in 2009 and accusing the United States and Israel of being behind the unrest. The war threatened Iran's position, and Saudi Arabia and its allies sided with Sunni rebels in part to weaken Iran. For years Iranian forces were involved on the ground, with soldiers in Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps facing heavy casualties. In 2014, with no end in sight to the conflict, Iran increased its ground support for the Syrian Army, providing elite forces, intelligence gathering, and training. Iran also backed pro-Assad Hezbollah fighters

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Although Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed in 2015 to participate in peace talks in Vienna in participation with United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the talks ultimately failed. Saudi Arabia countered Russia's intervention in Syria by increasing its support for the rebels and supplying American-made anti-tank TOW missiles, a move which slowed initial progress made by Russian and Syrian forces. Iran suffered a significant setback in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime to renewed rebel offensives in 2024. Yemen's geographical position in the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, close to Egypt and East Africa, and bordering Saudi Arabia, makes it important for Iran. With the help of the Houthis, Iran was able to expand its network of proxies without making significant financial or military investments in the southern borders of Saudi Arabia. With Iranian assistance, the Houthis were able to consolidate their position in Yemen and the Middle East. Yemen has been called one of the major fronts in the conflict as a result of the revolution and subsequent civil war. Yemen had for years been within the Saudi sphere of influence. The decade-long Houthi insurgency in Yemen stoked tensions with Iran, with accusations of covert support for the rebels. A 2015 UN report alleged that Iran provided the Houthi rebels with money, training, and arms shipments beginning in 2009. However, the degree of support has been subject to debate, and accusations of greater involvement have been denied by Iran. The 2014–2015 coup d'état was viewed by Saudi leadership as an immediate threat, and as an opportunity for Iran to gain a foothold in the region. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states, including all GCC members except Oman, intervened and launched airstrikes and a ground offensive in the country, declaring the entire Saada Governorate a military target and imposing a naval blockade. The United States intervened in October 2016 after missiles were fired at a US warship, which was in place to protect oil shipments along the sea lane passing through the Mandeb Strait. The US blamed the rebels and responded by targeting radar sites with missile strikes along the Red Sea coast. In response, rebels called the strikes evidence of American support for the Saudi campaign. While the majority of Muslims in Iraq are Shia, the country has been ruled for decades by Sunni-dominated governments under the Ottoman Empire, the British-installed Hashemites, and the Ba'athists

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. In January 2020, following the death of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian government lashed out at Albania for hosting MEK members, and Iran has increased cyberattacks and agent hunting on Iranian dissidents against Albania. Saudi Arabia, in response, announced its support for Albania in its efforts against Iran. The rebel group Jaish ul-Adl, active in the Sistan and Baluchestan region of Iran, is accused by Iranian authorities of receiving Saudi and American support. The speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, stated that Saudi Arabia gave "strategic" intelligence information to Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. In May 2018, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman supported greater discussion between Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, stating "It's time for the Middle East to [...] have an axis of moderate countries," opposed to the network of Iranian allies and proxies. As of 2018, several sources described alleged intelligence ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel as a "covert alliance", with a joint interest to counter Iran in the region. The New York Times remarked that such cooperation was made more difficult by controversy over Israel's attitude towards Palestinians. Israel and Saudi Arabia are both part of the Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD). The United States and Saudi Arabia have a strategic relationship that dates back to 1947. When the Iranian Revolution occurred, revolutionaries began to support other uprisings and rebellions throughout the Muslim world, including in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Iran used this policy to undermine their sovereignty while fighting in proxy warfare. This caused Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf allies to turn to the U.S. for support. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, and the GCC jointly backed Iraq under Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and the U.S. and Iran directly attacked each other during the Tanker War. The U.S. and Iran again opened in mistrust during the Iraq War, with the U.S. and the GCC accusing Iran of funding and militarizing its proxies and Shia groups within Iraq. The highest point of mutual distrust happened in 2005 after details of Iran's nuclear program were leaked, and sanctions by the UN were put in place. The sanctions were put in place until 2015, when the JCPOA was implemented. Iran and U.S

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. have also been embroiled in tensions due to the wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and disputes surrounding the Strait of Hormuz. In the 2011–2012 Strait of Hormuz dispute, Iran threatened to close Hormuz, however, was forced to back down after the EU placed sanctions. The U.S. and Iran were brought to the brink of war during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, when the U.S. assassinated Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, leaders of the Quds Force and the Popular Mobilization Forces, respectively. This was after the December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and the Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad, and Iran retaliated by bombing Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. U.S.-Saudi relations have deteriorated due to the Yemeni civil war and Syrian civil war. Saudi Arabia formerly supported the Al-Nusra Front, an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Saudi Arabia has also been involved in war crimes in Yemen due to civilian airstrikes and a humanitarian blockade. The U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led invasion until 2022, when Joe Biden repealed support for it and halted arm sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, on 14 September 2019, as an "act of war". President Donald Trump called for an increase in sanctions against Iran opposing the strikes. President Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran. Jordan has historically been on the Saudi bloc despite its slight rivalry. Jordan and Iran have sour relations with each other. Turkey has long seen Iran's expansions as threats but also perceived Saudi Arabia's influence with a similar reception, and is seeking to build itself as an alternative replacement to both Saudi and Iranian influences, to a degree. Historically, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey were part of the Western bloc. Turkey sided with Saudi Arabia throughout the conflicts in Syria and Yemen to contain against Iranian influence, however, both sides backed different groups. However, Turkey's growing military, political, and economic influence have caused some concern on Saudi circles with the start of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, when Turkey sided with Qatar

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Iran also considers Turkish military adventurism in Syria and its growing encounter against Iran in the Levant and Iraq as a challenge, not to mention its good relationship with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has antagonistic relations with Iran, and friendly relations with the Persian Gulf Arab states and Israel. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has also begun a systematic campaign to rewrite history, changing the Ottoman Empire into the occupier of Arabia; while it has also partially financed other megaprojects to counter the growing Turkish presence in Qatar, Sudan, Maghreb, Somalia, Kuwait, and Oman. Turkey was able to improve its relations with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the end of the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Erdoğan met with Mohammed bin Salman on June 2022 to boost their economic and political relations. Emirati-Turkish reconciliation in 2021, followed by Turkey's decision to move Khashoggi's case to the Saudi authorities and the mutual disdain of Biden administration to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey, paved a way for Saudi-Turkish reconciliation. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia supported Syrian opposition against Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey were among the first countries to welcome the new administration in Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. Turkey played a key role to ensure the new Syrian government would not pose any threats to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Turkey continued to strengthen their ties through cooperation and the mutual interest in both countries to contain Iran. Even though, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey maintains different strategic goals, both countries agree that limited cooperation is necessary for economic growth and regional stability. Qatar–Saudi Arabia relations have been strained since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Qatar has been a focus of controversy in the Saudi-Iranian rivalry due to Saudi Arabia's longstanding concern about the country's relationship with Iran and Iranian-backed militant groups. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Sudan, Senegal, Djibouti, Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government, and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and blocked their airspace and sea routes, in addition to Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing. The reasons cited were Qatar's relations with Iran, Al-Jazeera's coverage of other GCC states and Egypt, and Qatar's alleged support of Islamist groups. Qatar was also expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition

### 2020s in military history
. Whilst the invasion failed its main goal of a rapid victory, as Ukraine pushed back the northern arm of the invasion and prevented the capture of Kyiv, Russia maintained a military occupation of the southeast of Ukraine, and several months after the invasion, unilaterally declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials. The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict between Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey, and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh together with Armenia, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but partially governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. Clashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the First Nagorno-Karabakh war (1988–1994). In response to the clashes, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law and a curfew, later declaring partial mobilization on 28 September 2020. Turkey provided military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of this support has been disputed. Turkey's involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence, both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russia's influence over the region

2020s in military history

. Following the capture of Shusha, the second-largest settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ending all hostilities in the area from 00:00, 10 November 2020 Moscow Time. The President of Artsakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, also agreed to end the hostilities. Under the agreement, the warring sides will keep control of their currently held areas within Nagorno-Karabakh, while Armenia will return the surrounding territories it occupied in 1994 to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain land access to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Approximately 2,000 Russian soldiers will be deployed as peacekeeping forces along the Lachin corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh for a mandate of at least five years. On 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, beginning the Gaza war. On 8 October 2023, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery shells at Israeli positions, beginning the 2023 Israel-Hezbollah conflict. On 1 April 2024, Israel conducted an airstrike on the Iranian consulate complex in Damascus, Syria, beginning the 2024 Iran-Israel conflict. In September 2024, the Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated into the 2024 Israel-Hezbollah War. On 13 June 2025, Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities, starting the Iran–Israel war, which resulted in a ceasefire after the US attacked Iranian nuclear sites. In January 2020, the United States assassinated the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, general Qasem Soleimani. This led to an Iranian missile strike against bases housing US troops in Iraq five days later. As a result of expectations of a US retribution, the Iranian air defence system accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people on board. The International Maritime Security Construct was setup by the US to prevent Iran from disrupting international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. Israel was suspected of being behind at least five explosions and fires at Iranian nuclear sites in the summer of 2020

2020s in military history

. The leading nuclear scientist of the country, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated on 27 November 2020, with Iran blaming Israel for the attack. The Yemeni Civil War is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently control the capital Sanaʽa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. Concurrently, the Hadi government is in conflict with UAE forces as a result of UAE military measures such as the United Arab Emirates takeover of Socotra and UAE-backed STC takeover of Aden. In February 2020, the political track of the Libyan peace process started in Geneva among 20 Libyans, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the Libyan House of Representatives, and from the independent persons' group selected by UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), including Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, former Education Minister Othman Abdul Jalil and former head of the HCS Abdulrahman Sewehli. The aimed composition was 13 HoR representatives from both the Tobruk and Tripoli branches, 13 HCS representatives and 14 UNSMIL-selected independent Libyans, for a total of 40. The Tigray conflict was an armed conflict that began in November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, between Tigray Region special forces led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) in alliance with Amhara Region special forces. The conflict stemmed from the attempt of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to distance the country's politics from ethnic federalism, a power-sharing system giving regional influence to individual ethnic groups, by merging the ethnic and region-based parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which had governed Ethiopia for 30 years, into a nationwide Prosperity Party

### Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration
. Project Cassandra was a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) initiative launched in 2008 to disrupt Hezbollah's funding networks by targeting its involvement in international drug trafficking and money laundering. While the operation uncovered significant links between Hezbollah and organized crime, its later years were marked by controversy over allegations that enforcement efforts were slowed to protect the JCPOA negotiations with Iran—a claim disputed by former officials. On January 12, 2016, two United States Navy riverine command boats were seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy after they entered Iranian territorial waters near Iran's Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. Initially, the U.S. military claimed the sailors inadvertently entered Iranian waters owing to mechanical failure, but it was later reported that they entered Iranian waters because of navigational errors. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif within five minutes, the first of a series of phone calls between the two. The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released, unharmed, 15 hours later. The release was hailed by the Obama administration as an unintended benefit of the new diplomatic relationship. Iran released pictures of captured U.S. sailors. Some U.S. Republican 2016 presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump criticized the U.S. response to the detention, which they deemed too weak. Although the JCPOA removed sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program, the United States continued to enforce sanctions concerning human rights violations, support for terrorism, and ballistic missile activities. Iran frequently criticized this dual-track approach as undermining the spirit of the agreement, even if not in legal violation, and cited it as evidence of bad faith. Additionally, European banks and corporations were hesitant to engage with Iran due to the risk of U.S. secondary sanctions, which discouraged financial and commercial transactions despite the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. During this period, the United States backed the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), an exiled opposition group that had once allied with Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and was delisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2012. The MEK received public support from several high-profile American politicians and was promoted by some as a viable alternative to Iran's current leadership

Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration

. On 8 and 9 March 2016 the IRGC conducted ballistic missile tests as part of its military drills, with one of the Qadr H missiles carrying the inscription, "Israel should be wiped off the Earth." Israel called on Western powers to punish Iran for the tests, which U.S. officials said did not violate the nuclear deal but might violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the tests were not in violation of the UNSC resolution. On 17 March the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian and British companies for involvement in the Iranian ballistic missile program. On 21 May 2016 Zarif, during a meeting with his New Zealander counterpart Murray McCully, while statements of support (like those from the U.S.) are politically helpful, they are not sufficient unless matched by action — especially to resolve obstacles created by years of sanctions and U.S. hostility. In parallel with ongoing sanctions and legal disputes, tensions also extended into the judiciary. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Iran must pay nearly $2 billion to victims of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. Although U.S. troops generally have no legal right to sue under combat rules, the judge determined they were on a peacekeeping mission under peacetime rules of engagement. As a result, survivors and family members were allowed to sue Iran under a 1996 law permitting U.S. citizens to take legal action against nations that sponsor terrorism. Meanwhile, Iran and the United States engaged in indirect military confrontation during the Arab Spring, primarily in Syria following an uprising against the pro-Iranian dictator Bashar al-Assad, with both sides supporting opposing factions. Iran backed al-Assad through proxy forces, viewing his regime as vital to its regional interests. The U.S., Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia supported the uprising, with the latter three funding revolutionary groups. As the conflict escalated into a broader civil war, it evolved into a proxy struggle between Russia and the United States, with Russia largely supporting Iranian efforts in Syria to contain rebels. Iran, Russia, and Syria, alongside Hezbollah and Iraq, formed a military coalition, which was viewed by the U.S. as an attempt by said countries to antagonize the West. Iran and the U.S. also engaged in proxy warfare in Yemen, where the U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen. The U.S

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a proxy war over influence in the Middle East and other regions of the Muslim world. The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria and Yemen; and disputes in Bahrain, Lebanon, Qatar, and Iraq. The struggle also extends to disputes or broader competition in other countries globally including in West, North and East Africa, South,[excessive citations] Central, Southeast Asia, the Balkans, and the Caucasus. In what has been described as a new cold war, the conflict is waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic, and sectarian influence in pursuit of regional hegemony. The rivalry has drawn comparisons to the dynamics of the Cold War era. As of 2017[update], the rivalry is primarily a political and economic struggle exacerbated by religious differences, and sectarianism in the region is exploited by both countries for geopolitical purposes as part of a larger conflict. Iran sees itself as the leading Shia Muslim power, while Saudi Arabia is the leading Wahhabi power (see Shia–Sunni relations). As of 10 March 2023[update], diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been restored due to Chinese-Iraqi brokered talks, which could have positive implications in the political climate of the Middle East. The deal was concluded after Iranian agreement to stop its military support for the Houthi militants in the Yemeni civil war.

The Arab–Iranian conflict is a term which is used in reference to the modern conflict between Arab League countries and Iran. In a broader sense, the term is also used in reference to the historical ethnic tensions which have existed for centuries between Arabs and Persians as well as the historical religious sectarian conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims, due to Saudi Arabia and post-revolutionary Iran seeing themselves as the champion leading states for Wahhabi and Shia Muslims, respectively. A noteworthy point in this conflict is that Iran has very positive relations with numerous Arab countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria and Tunisia. Qatar also has established close working relations with Tehran, despite their differences of opinion over the Syrian civil war, with Iran and Turkey two of the non-Arab countries to support Qatar against Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries in the Qatar diplomatic crisis which lasted for over two years

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. In this regard, the rivalry and tension is often seen as being between Iran and Persian Gulf Arab monarchies (all of which identify more with theocratic governance), such as the GCC states and their allies: namely Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Morocco. The biggest rivalry in the Arab–Iranian conflict is between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who have been waging a heavy proxy war against each other since the late 1970s. The proxy conflict can be traced back to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when the monarchic Imperial State of Iran became an Islamic republic. After the Islamic Revolution, the utilization of proxies became a key component of Iran's national security strategy and its initiatives in the region. The revolutionaries called for the overthrow of monarchies and secular governments to be replaced with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of the region's Sunni-run Arab monarchies Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the other Persian Gulf states, and Ba'athist Iraq (which was not a monarchy), most of whom were monarchies and all of whom had sizable Shia populations. Islamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia in 1979, Egypt and Bahrain in 1981, Syria in 1982, and Lebanon in 1983. Prior to the Iranian Revolution, the two countries constituted the Nixon Doctrine's "twin pillar" policy in the Middle East. The monarchies, particularly Iran since the Pahlavi-coup in 1953, were allied with the US to ensure stability in the Gulf region and act as a bulwark against Soviet influence during the Arab Cold War between Saudi Arabia and Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser. The alliance acted as a moderating influence on Saudi-Iranian relations. During this period Saudi Arabia styled itself as the leader of the Muslim world, basing its legitimacy in part on its control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. In 1962, it sponsored the inaugural General Islamic Conference in Mecca, at which a resolution was passed to create the Muslim World League. The organization is dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity under the Saudi purview, and has been successful in promoting Islam, particularly the conservative Wahhabi doctrine advocated by the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia also spearheaded the creation of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in 1969

### Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration
Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration (2021–2025) were shaped by efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement alongside ongoing regional tensions, sanctions, cyberattacks, and proxy conflicts. Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. officials expressed interest in returning to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but negotiations in Vienna eventually stalled. Iran increased uranium enrichment and imposed retaliatory sanctions, while the U.S. imposed new sanctions over missile programs, oil exports, and human rights abuses. Tensions persisted throughout this era, marked by recurring proxy attacks on U.S. bases, which intensified following the outbreak of the Gaza war in late 2023, and by subsequent American retaliatory strikes. The period also saw disputes over the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and military escalations across the Gulf region. In 2023, a breakthrough occurred with a U.S.–Iran prisoner swap and the release of frozen Iranian funds, though indirect diplomacy remained fragile. Iran was later accused of interfering in the 2024 U.S. presidential election through cyber operations and AI disinformation. Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust.

Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust. At the outset of the Biden administration in January 2021, Iran was led by President Hassan Rouhani, a centrist cleric who had previously championed the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) and advocated for improved relations with the West, while ultimate authority rested with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who held decisive power over Iran’s foreign and security policies. Relations between the U.S. and Iran were deeply strained, with no formal diplomatic ties since 1980. The United States had withdrawn from the JCPOA, reimposed sweeping sanctions, and escalated military tensions, while Iran had resumed higher-level uranium enrichment and reduced compliance with the nuclear deal in violation of the agreement. The Biden administration initially expressed interest in re-engaging with Iran on the Iran nuclear deal, which the previous administration had withdrawn from in 2018, sparking international backlash. Early in his presidency, Biden formally extended an offer to restart diplomatic talks on a new nuclear deal, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that the U.S. would consider re-entering the agreement if Iran returned to "strict compliance" with its terms

. At the time, Blinken also did not rule out the possibility of military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. As Iran continued to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2021, the government repeatedly urged the Biden administration to lift sanctions. Strict financial measures imposed by the previous Trump administration had negatively impacted Iranian economies. Tensions remained high in the region. Following a militia-organized rocket attack in Erbil, Iraq, which wounded four American contractors and one soldier, in February 2021 the United States Military conducted airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria, including Kata'ib Hezbollah. The attacks sparked renewed debate over presidential war powers, with key Democratic lawmakers expressing concern about conducting military operations without prior congressional approval. Over 220 US Congress leaders endorsed House Resolution 118 in April 2021, expressing support for "the Iranian people's desire for a democratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic of Iran" and condemning "violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism". Around the same time, signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) met in Vienna in an effort to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement. U.S. and Iranian officials participated in so-called proximity talks in order to exchange views on how to return to the considered deal. Both sides downplayed expectations for rapid progress, insisting that the other should resume their commitments first. Talks continued even after an explosion at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, blamed on Israel, to which Iran responded by increasing uranium enrichment to 60% purity, its highest level to date. Diplomatic tensions remained unresolved in late 2021, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stating that military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons could not be ruled out. Around the same time, Iran imposed sanctions on former U.S. President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and eight others for their alleged roles in the 2020 killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani. Iran also requested their arrest through Interpol. President Ebrahim Raisi stated that Trump, Pompeo, and others must be tried in a "fair court". In 2021, Iran's crude oil exports had been re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA
