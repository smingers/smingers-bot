## Geopolitical Analysis: US Attack on Iran Before April 2026

### Step 1: Source Analysis
- Most recent information is from January 2026 (very current)
- Sources include diplomatic reports, news agencies (Reuters, Sky News Arabia)
- Credibility is moderate to high
- Potential bias in sensationalist reporting about tensions

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

**STRONG Evidence (Pushing Probability DOWN)**
- De-escalation diplomatic efforts actively ongoing
- U.S. strategic focus shifted away from Middle East
- No visible military mobilization preparations
- Domestic political constraints limiting aggressive foreign action

**MODERATE Evidence (Pushing Probability UP)**
- Intermittent hostile rhetoric from political figures
- Ongoing tensions in Middle Eastern region
- Unpredictability of current political leadership

**WEAK Evidence**
- Sensationalist media reports about potential conflict
- Isolated threats without substantive follow-through

### Step 3: Direction of Update

Downward Adjustments:
- Diplomatic de-escalation: -5% (Strong evidence)
- Strategic refocus away from Middle East: -4% (Strong evidence)
- Domestic political constraints: -3% (Strong evidence)

Upward Adjustments:
- Rhetorical tensions: +2% (Moderate evidence)
- Potential unpredictability: +1% (Weak evidence)

### Step 4: Integration

Starting Point: 22.0%
- Downward adjustments: -12%
- Upward adjustments: +3%
- Net adjustment: -9%

### Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: Requires massive unexpected geopolitical shift
2. Base rate anchor: Adjustment proportional to evidence strength
3. Evidence updates reasonable and measured
4. Not overcorrecting from base rate

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a geopolitical analyst, the evidence strongly suggests a low probability of US military action against Iran. Key factors include:
- Active diplomatic channels
- U.S. strategic pivot away from Middle Eastern conflicts
- Domestic political gridlock
- Short timeframe remaining (only 2 months)
- Absence of typical pre-conflict military preparations

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing DOWN: Diplomatic efforts, strategic refocus, domestic constraints
- Strong evidence pointing UP: Minimal and weak
- Net direction: STRONGLY DOWN

**Adjustment Calculation:**
- Base rate: 22.0%
- Total adjustment: -9%
- Final estimate: 13%

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8/10

Probability: 13%
