The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.' The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll due to a nationwide internet blackout lasting over two weeks, the largest in Iran's history.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 05:47 AM\nSource: [euronews](http://ru.euronews.com/2026/01/26/iran-install-billboard-threatening-usa)\n\n**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**\nGeopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation. The situation has intensified as of January 25, 2026, according to TimesNow, though specific details about the deployments, threats, or regional reactions are not provided in the article.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 05:07 AM\nSource: [TimesNow](https://www.timesnownews.com/videos/times-now/world/war-clouds-over-iran-as-trump-issues-military-threats-deploys-us-warships-fears-of-conflict-rise-video-153502523)\n\n**In Iran, the US-Israeli addiction to hybrid warfare is on full display**\nThe article argues that the United States and Israel are deeply entrenched in a pattern of hybrid warfare, exemplified by ongoing campaigns against Venezuela and Iran. In Venezuela, the U.S. has pursued long-term objectives to seize oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt and overthrow the leftist government since 2002, using economic sanctions, cyber operations, military strikes, and misinformation. The article claims that under Donald Trump, these tactics escalated to bombing Caracas, kidnapping President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and imposing a naval blockade\u2014acts described as war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is cited as endorsing these actions, motivated by Venezuela\u2019s support for Palestine and ties to Iran. Similarly, the U.S.-Israel hybrid war against Iran dates back to 1953, when the CIA and MI6 orchestrated Operation Ajax to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstall the Shah, who ruled with repression via SAVAK. The article asserts that U.S. actions\u2014including funding Iraq\u2019s war against Iran in the 1980s and withdrawing from the 2015 JCPOA\u2014aim not at diplomacy but at keeping Iran economically crippled and diplomatically isolated. The article criticizes the U.S. and Israel for violating the UN Charter by waging hybrid warfare, which thrives on deception, contradictions, and escalation. It claims such actions have caused widespread chaos, economic devastation, refugee crises, and undermined global stability. The authors argue that the only beneficiaries are the military-tech-industrial complexes in the U.S. and Israel, and they call on the 191 other UN member states to reject regime-change operations, unilateral sanctions, weaponized currency, and the rejection of international law. The article concludes that the American public and global population oppose this deep state brutality but struggle to be heard. The analysis is attributed to Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares, advisors for the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 11:16 PM\nSource: [The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2026/01/25/in-iran-the-us-israeli-addiction-to-hybrid-warfare-is-on-full-display)\n\n**Escalation Over Iran: U.S. Military Moves, Israeli Coordination, and Warnings of a Decisive Response**\nTensions surrounding Iran have escalated on both military and political fronts, with U.S. military movements and Israeli security coordination countered by Iran\u2019s warnings of a existential threat from any attack and readiness to respond to the worst-case scenarios. The U.S. Central Command Commander, Brad Cooper, arrived in Israel to hold security and military coordination meetings with Israeli leadership, including Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the Air Force Commander, according to Israeli media and the Haaretz newspaper. Simultaneously, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by three destroyers, arrived in the Indian Ocean from the South China Sea, with plans to join U.S. destroyers already stationed in the Gulf. Iran\u2019s UN mission cited a senior Iranian official stating that any U.S. attack would be considered an existential threat, and that Iran\u2019s military is prepared for the worst-case scenarios. The official also expressed hope that the military buildup is not a prelude to real conflict and mentioned ongoing discussions about reviving nuclear talks. Iran\u2019s Ground Forces and Revolutionary Guard emphasized unity and coordination among armed forces as decisive in thwarting enemy plots. Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Ali Jahanshahi stated that 'unity of the armed forces is the key to defeating the enemy in crises' and affirmed that ground forces will defend Iranian soil alongside the Revolutionary Guard, pledging to defend Iran 'to the death.' Revolutionary Guard Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Mohammad Karami described inter-service coordination as a 'valuable asset' requiring serious preservation and enhancement. Deputy Commander of the Revolutionary Guard Ahmad Vahidi declared that 'it is wrong to retest what has already been tested,' asserting Iran is 'at the peak of its strength' and ready to respond forcefully to any aggression, calling the latest conspiracy against Iran a continuation of the '12-day war.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 04:24 PM\nSource: [Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/1/24/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%82)\n\n**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**\nTensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict. The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters\u2014though Iran\u2019s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei\u2019s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran\u2019s senior officials stated that any attack\u2014limited or unlimited\u2014would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran\u2019s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option\u2014assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran\u2019s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran\u2019s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war\u2014unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 11:47 AM\nSource: [News18](https://www.news18.com/explainers/after-a-short-lived-pause-us-iran-tensions-are-flaring-again-what-triggered-the-escalation-ws-l-9854123.html)\n\n**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**\nThe article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements\u2014including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments\u2014signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump\u2019s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses\u2014raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident\u2014such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack\u2014could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing\u2014often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 10:14 AM\nSource: [Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5393133)\n\n**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**\nA large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.'

Fidan cited 'clear signs' of Israel's ongoing efforts to attack Iran, warning that any conflict would open 'wide doors of uncertainty.' Meanwhile, Israel's recent assessments indicate that U.S. military presence in the Middle East has reached its highest level this week, potentially serving as a platform for a large-scale attack on Iran or as a strategic threat to pressure Tehran into negotiating under stricter nuclear terms. In response, an Iranian official emphasized that Iran is on high alert, warning that any action would be met with unprecedented retaliation and could escalate into a 'total war.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource: [Asharq Al-awsat  - Turkish](https://turkish.aawsat.com/node/5233437)\n\n**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**\nGeopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation.

It alleges that Iran's hardline leadership defied Trump's earlier diplomatic overtures by announcing the execution of 800 individuals, escalating tensions.

It concludes that the real conflict is not military but strategic, involving U.S. pressure tactics, Iranian resilience, and the risk of global escalation, with outcomes shaped more by diplomacy, oil markets, and information warfare than by actual combat.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 02:04 AM\nSource: [\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/979662776_121752858?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0-0-0-0-0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**In Iran, the US-Israeli addiction to hybrid warfare is on full display**\nThe article argues that the United States and Israel are deeply entrenched in a pattern of hybrid warfare, exemplified by ongoing campaigns against Venezuela and Iran.

The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander, Brad Cooper, met with Israeli officials, while Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner also held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three destroyers toward the Persian Gulf, with the strike group expected to reach the CENTCOM area of responsibility within a week. The deployment will bring an additional 5,700 U.S. troops, along with F-15E fighter jets, to the region. The United Kingdom has sent four Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar\u2019s Al-Duhail Air Base at the request of the Qatari government to enhance defense capabilities. U.S. military cargo planes and Patriot and THAAD missile defense systems have also been deployed to the region. Iran, through an unnamed official speaking to Times of Israel, stated it is prepared for the worst-case scenario and will treat any attack\u2014whether limited, precision-based, kinetic, or otherwise\u2014as an all-out war, vowing the strongest possible response. The conflict escalated after Israel's June 13 attack, prompting Iran to retaliate. On June 22, U.S. aircraft conducted airstrikes on Iranian facilities in Isfahan, Fordo, and Natanz using 14 GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs. Meanwhile, protests in Iran following the December 28 unrest have resulted in official figures of 3,117 deaths, according to Iran's Martyrs and Veterans Foundation, though HRANA reports at least 5,137 killed and 27,797 arrested.

The death toll from the protests, which began on December 28, 2025 and intensified by January 8, stands at a minimum of 3,117, according to Iranian officials, with over 500 security personnel among the dead; independent human rights groups, such as the U.S.-based HRANA, estimate at least 5,137 deaths. President Donald Trump has escalated U.S. military posture by deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward Iranian waters, declaring that 'all options are on the table' if Iran executes protesters. Trump also falsely claimed to have prevented the hanging of 837 people in Iran, a claim rejected by Iran\u2019s Prosecutor-General Mohammad Movahedi. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that any renewed attack on Iran would provoke a 'ferocious' and prolonged response, potentially engulfing the entire Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed credit for reshaping the Middle East, asserting that Israel is prepared to respond with unprecedented force if attacked, and praised the Iranian people\u2019s 'heroic struggle' against their government. Iran accuses Israel of infiltrating the country through operatives trained in ISIS-held territories and has arrested up to 3,000 alleged members of 'terrorist groups,' including a suspected Mossad agent executed after arrest. Kurdish factions, such as the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) and the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), have claimed responsibility for armed actions during the protests. The Iranian government maintains that foreign-backed militants, including those trained in ISIS-controlled areas, hijacked initially peaceful demonstrations. Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel for seeking opportunities to strike Iran, highlighting regional opposition to military confrontation. The 12-Day War between Iran and Israel in June 2025\u2014sparked by an Israeli air campaign and retaliated by Iran with missile and drone attacks\u2014had already significantly altered regional dynamics, weakening Iran\u2019s Axis of Resistance network, particularly after the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. military activity near Iran, including the movement of refueling aircraft and evacuation advisories for personnel at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, has heightened fears of imminent conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 09:00 AM\nSource: [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-warns-middle-east-will-collapse-if-government-falls-amid-us-threats-11410985)\n\n**Erdo\u011fan's Secret Diplomacy 'Froze' the Crisis: How a Trump\u2013Iran Confrontation Was Averted**\nA behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort involving Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan played a critical role in de-escalating a potential conflict between the United States and Iran, according to an article from pagenews.gr. The crisis, described as existential for Iran, was averted through quiet, controlled signals of restraint from Washington, which allowed Tehran time to respond without immediate foreign intervention. The U.S. prioritized avoiding a regional escalation involving Iran, Israel, and American forces, while Iran sought assurance that its violent crackdown would not trigger direct foreign military action. The backchannel diplomacy\u2014characterized as crisis management rather than peace mediation\u2014involved open lines of communication between Ankara, Tehran, and Washington. The process enabled a managed reduction in tensions without a formal resolution, preserving both sides\u2019 dignity and autonomy. However, the article warns that such 'frozen' crises rarely disappear permanently, often returning later in more intense and dangerous forms, as historical patterns in Iran\u2019s foreign relations suggest. The diplomatic quietude was underpinned by mutual self-restraint and strategic patience, with Erdo\u011fan's role described as pivotal in facilitating the indirect dialogue.\nOriginal language: el\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource: [pagenews.gr](https://www.pagenews.gr/2026/01/17/geopolitika/i-mystiki-diplomatia-erntogan-pagose-tin-krisi-pos-apofeuxthike-sygkrousi-tramp-iran/)\n\n**Iran: U.S. Sows Destabilization Through Humanitarian Narrative**\nIn a high-impact speech before the United Nations Security Council, Iran's Deputy Representative Gholamhossein Darzi accused the United States and Israel of launching a hybrid war phase to destabilize Iran after failing in their military objectives. Darzi claimed that Washington and Tel Aviv, unable to achieve their goals through direct military force, are now inciting internal unrest, chaos, and extremist activities to undermine Iran's sovereignty. He condemned the U.S. stance as 'deeply cynical,' highlighting the contradiction between portraying itself as an ally of the Iranian people while planning military intervention under humanitarian pretexts. According to Darzi, the U.S. strategy involves fabricating casualties and inflating casualty figures to justify foreign interference\u2014a pattern previously used in Iraq, Libya, and Venezuela to overthrow governments opposing American interests. He cited historical U.S. hostility, including the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq and support for Saddam Hussein\u2019s war in 1980. Darzi stated that the current destabilization campaign follows the failure of a 12-day aggression in June 2025, aiming now to achieve through internal chaos what was not possible on the battlefield. He lamented the deaths of police officers defending public order against externally directed violence and accused the U.S. of using the Security Council meeting to spread disinformation and conceal its role in organizing violent acts inside Iran. Darzi emphasized that Iran does not seek escalation or direct confrontation but warned that any act of aggression would receive a firm, proportionate, and lawful response under the UN Charter. He concluded that this statement is not a threat but a legal reality, holding accountable those who initiate illegal acts for all resulting consequences.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 01:22 AM\nSource: [\u00daltimas Noticias](https://ultimasnoticias.com.ve/actualidad/iran-eeuu-siembra-desestabilizacion-con-narrativa-humanitaria/)\n\n**Netanyahu's Plane Lands in Crete: Harbinger of War?**\nOn January 14, 2026, Israel's Boeing 767 government aircraft, known as the 'Wing of Zion' (4X-ISR), landed at Heraklion International Airport on Crete, Greece, after departing from Nevatim Airbase. The aircraft remained for approximately one hour before returning to Israel and landing near Beersheba. Israeli officials, including public broadcaster Kan, described the flight as a routine training mission, a maintenance-related rerouting, or a evacuation drill, and confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not on board, as he was appearing in court in Tel Aviv on corruption charges that day. Despite this, social media and analysts questioned the official explanation, citing historical patterns: the same aircraft had previously been observed moving to Greece shortly before Israel's three recent strikes on Iran in 2025. Analysts suggest such movements may serve as a pre-attack 'standard precaution' or 'signal'. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Aviation Commander General Majid Musavi claimed Iran\u2019s military capacity had fully recovered from the '12-Day War' in June 2025, with increased missile stocks and aviation production surpassing pre-war levels, vowing an overwhelming response to any attack. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all planned meetings with Iranian officials were canceled, citing 'senseless killings of protesters', and called on the Iranian people to continue protests, urging them to record the names of 'killers and tyrants' and stating, 'Help is on the way.' This message came amid ongoing anti-regime protests in Iran, where human rights groups report over 2,000 deaths. While official sources maintain the Crete flight was part of a scheduled annual maintenance program, open-source intelligence (OSINT) accounts and international outlets interpret the movement as a potential indicator of escalating regional tensions, especially given the aircraft\u2019s prior behavior before major military actions. Although mainstream media has not yet established a direct link between this flight and an imminent military operation, the convergence of Iran\u2019s military posturing, Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and historical flight patterns has intensified speculation that the flight may signal an impending large-scale conflict.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 07:49 PM\nSource: [Haber7.com](https://www.haber7.com/dunya/haber/3596102-netanyahunun-ucagi-girite-indi-savasin-habercisi-mi)\n\n**Dear Iran, About That Threat to Trump**\nThe article, published on January 14, 2026, by PJ Media, responds to Iran's public threat against former U.S. President Donald Trump. It argues that the threat, issued amid ongoing domestic repression and protests in Iran, is a miscalculation rooted in a misunderstanding of U.S. resolve. The piece asserts that Iran\u2019s leadership has already witnessed the U.S. dismantle hidden nuclear facilities despite mountainous defenses and conduct a precision military operation to arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela without casualties. It emphasizes that the U.S. does not respond to threats against its presidents with retreat but with escalation, citing Trump\u2019s historical pattern of tightening pressure and removing ambiguity. The article warns that such threats do not enhance Iran\u2019s international standing or solve domestic crises like hyperinflation, energy shortages, and repression, which are fueling protests. It concludes that threats against U.S. presidents signal desperation, not strength, and that Iran risks provoking a response it cannot control. The piece urges Iran to reconsider its strategy, noting that rattlesnakes lose power when their rattle is no longer feared. The article positions itself as a source for 'clarity, context, and consequences' without panic, targeting readers who value 'sharp thinking over loud noise and facts over fear.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 03:16 PM\nSource: [PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/david-manney/2026/01/14/dear-iran-about-that-threat-to-trump-n4948287)\n\n**Iran's Protests Expand Amid Hardline Rhetoric and Escalating Crackdown**\nProtests in Iran have expanded geographically and intensified, with the death toll rising to at least 10, according to reports from Associated Press and human rights groups. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei delivered a hardline speech, labeling protesters as 'a group of incited individuals and enemies' who chant anti-Islam and anti-Iran slogans, and asserting that 'disruptors must be brought back to their place.' He claimed that the economic grievances of merchants were being exploited to 'sabotage and create chaos,' while reaffirming the regime's commitment to 'not retreat before the enemy,' vowing to 'force the enemy to bow down.' Despite this, Khamenei acknowledged the historical loyalty of merchants to the Islamic Revolution and admitted that currency fluctuations are not normal, attributing the rise in foreign exchange rates to 'the enemy's actions.' President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed the arrest of some merchants involved in protests, stating the government 'will not use force or retaliation' and pledged to resolve grievances personally. Protests have spread across Tehran\u2019s neighborhoods including Nazimabad, Sadeghiyeh, Star Khan, Narmak, and Tehranpars, with fire outbreaks and violent incidents reported in Qom and Kermanshah. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard and security forces have arrested dozens, including a teenager in Isfahan allegedly carrying a firearm. The Guardian reported that inflation, a 50% increase in food prices, and the aftermath of the 12-day Iran-Israel conflict have fueled unrest. International concern is growing, with Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry expressing 'deep concern' and urging Iran to uphold its international human rights commitments. The UN fact-finding mission and EU sanctions are under consideration. The Organization of Human Rights emphasized the severity of the crackdown. While the current protests have not yet matched the scale of the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, the ongoing pattern of nighttime demonstrations, expanded arrests, and state media narratives suggest a potential escalation, depending on government response. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning via Truth Social, stating the U.S. 'will intervene to save them' if protesters are attacked, prompting threats from Iranian MP Ismail Kothari, who warned of targeting U.S. bases in West Asia.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 08:42 AM\nSource: [\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062e\u0628\u0631\u0646\u064a](https://www.khaberni.com/news/767826-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%22%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%88%22)\n\n**Escalating 'Intensity of Confrontation' Between the U.S. and Iran Amid Protests and Threats**\nTensions between the United States and Iran have escalated following a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to intervene if Iranian security forces used violence against peaceful protesters during nationwide demonstrations over economic and living conditions. Trump stated on Truth Social: 'If Iran shoots and kills peaceful protesters, we will intervene to help them,' adding that the U.S. is ready. Iran's National Security Council Secretary, Ali Shamkhani, responded by warning Trump that any foreign interference in Iran\u2019s internal affairs would destabilize the region and undermine U.S. interests, calling such actions reckless. He emphasized that Iran distinguishes between legitimate public demands and sabotage elements, and criticized Trump for hypocrisy, citing historical U.S. interventions in Iran\u2014such as the 1953 coup, the 1988 downing of Iran Air Flight 655, and the 2025 assassination campaign against Iranian citizens\u2014while accusing the U.S. of using the pretext of 'saving' Iranians to advance its geopolitical agenda. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei reiterated that Iran rejects all external interference, calling Trump\u2019s threats a violation of international law and a continuation of a long pattern of destabilization. Analyst Dr. Mohamed Saad Idris noted that Trump\u2019s rhetoric appears to be part of a broader U.S.-Israel strategy to exploit internal unrest to justify military action against Iran and Hezbollah, especially after the failed June 2025 strike aimed at destabilizing the regime. He argued that while protests began as peaceful economic grievances\u2014triggered by sudden inflation in food, housing, and fuel\u2014some were hijacked by organized elements, including trained operatives with no mobile phones to avoid detection, some led by women. These groups reportedly engaged in sabotage, attacks on police stations, and violence, leading to at least seven deaths among security forces and civilians. Iranian authorities have arrested 30 individuals in Tehran on charges of 'disturbing public order' and announced direct talks with union and business representatives. President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered immediate economic reforms to restore purchasing power, and the government acknowledged the protests and pledged corrective measures. Iranian media outlets, including Tasnim and Mehr, reported that the unrest was fueled by economic shocks and that foreign intelligence operatives, including from Mossad, were involved in inciting violence, turning peaceful demonstrations into chaos. The Iranian response has been both diplomatic and firm, warning of severe consequences for any further escalation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 02:48 AM\nSource: [AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4165899)\n\n**Iran Protests Turn Deadly: Trump Warns of U.S. Intervention as Crisis Escalates**\nOn January 1, 2026, Iran experienced its first reported fatalities from protests, with at least six people killed in demonstrations across three cities\u2014Isfahan, Shiraz, and Kerman\u2014according to Iranian media. The protests, which began as an economic uprising in Tehran\u2019s commercial districts due to hyperinflation and a collapsing rial (falling to 144 million per USD by December 28, 2025), rapidly escalated into a nationwide movement involving merchants, students, workers, and even former supporters of the regime. The unrest marked a historic shift, as traditional bazaar merchants\u2014long considered pillars of the Islamic Republic\u2019s support base\u2014led the resistance. U.S. President Donald Trump, through his platform Truth Social, issued a stark warning: 'If Iran opens fire and violently kills peaceful protesters, we will go to rescue them. We are already ready.' He framed Iran\u2019s actions as part of a longstanding pattern of violence and emphasized that the U.S. was 'already poised.' The statement signaled potential U.S. intervention, ranging from intensified sanctions and cyber support to military deployment or even direct strikes, though the exact nature of 'rescue' remains ambiguous. The crisis has triggered a strategic dilemma for Iran: suppressing the protests risks U.S. military retaliation, while failing to act risks regime instability. The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has remained silent, while President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed willingness to dialogue. Three possible paths have emerged: limited concessions and technical economic fixes; violent crackdown with international escalation; or systemic collapse leading to regime change. The situation has transformed a currency crisis into a high-stakes geopolitical confrontation, with global implications for Middle East stability and U.S.-Iran relations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 10:56 AM\nSource: [\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd](https://www.secretchina.com/news/b5/2026/01/02/1092910.html)\n\n**Is Washington Preventing an Israeli Escalation?**\nLeveraging insights from informed sources, the article details escalating tensions in Lebanon, with growing indications of a potential large-scale Israeli military operation against Hezbollah, possibly involving a series of concentrated airstrikes rather than a prolonged ground war. The U.S. administration is reportedly engaged in serious internal discussions about this scenario, which is framed as a 'wide but limited' operation aimed at weakening Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities\u2014targeting infrastructure and key leadership\u2014without immediately triggering a full-scale regional war. However, sources warn that such a limited strike could rapidly spiral out of control, particularly if Iran perceives Hezbollah as facing an existential threat, potentially prompting direct Iranian intervention or the opening of additional fronts. While the U.S. remains reluctant to support a prolonged or open-ended war due to economic and political costs, it may grant Israel a 'limited window' for targeted airstrikes. The article underscores the inherent risk in assuming such operations can remain contained, citing historical patterns in the region where limited actions have led to uncontrollable escalations. Lebanon\u2019s fragile political and military state makes it highly vulnerable to any major shock. Despite ongoing backchannel diplomacy and international mediation efforts, the trajectory of tension suggests a rising likelihood of escalation, with the next phase potentially marking a decisive turning point\u2014especially if the U.S. formally approves such airstrikes. The article concludes that Lebanon stands at a critical juncture, where any reckless move could trigger a regional conflict extending far beyond southern Lebanon.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource: [Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/lebanon/1449791/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%9F)\n\n**Venezuela-EU: What Does Trump\u2019s Past Behavior Suggest About Future U.S. Actions?**\nThe article analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible return to power. It highlights five key precedents: (I) Limited strikes in Syria in 2017\u20132018, where Trump responded to chemical weapons use by Bashar al-Assad with targeted attacks that projected strength but avoided escalation; (II) The assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in 2020, followed by a swift de-escalation after Iran retaliated with ballistic missiles, despite initial claims of no casualties; (III) The withdrawal from Afghanistan, where Trump negotiated directly with the Taliban, bypassing the Kabul government, leading to a deal even as attacks continued; (IV) A 2025 campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, launched under pressure from hardliners but quickly concluded with a negotiated settlement; and (V) A 2025 strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, conducted with technological precision and force, but immediately followed by a statement on Truth Social declaring the operation over. The article concludes that Trump\u2019s pattern\u2014'Peace Through Strength'\u2014involves using limited, decisive force to signal resolve, then swiftly seeking negotiation. Given the significant U.S. naval presence near Venezuela, the analysis suggests a high-probability scenario of limited, high-impact strikes aimed at pressuring Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to resign or negotiate, rather than prolonged conflict. However, outcomes depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including the influence of figures like Marco Rubio and military assessments.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource: [Vanguardia](https://vanguardia.com.mx/opinion/venezuela-eu-que-nos-dice-el-historial-de-trump-sobre-lo-que-podria-venir-DO18256423)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Past Patterns Suggest Limited Military Action, Rapid De-escalation in Potential Venezuela Conflict**\nThe article by Mauricio Meschoulam analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior\u2014particularly his use of limited military force followed by rapid de-escalation\u2014to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible second Trump administration. Drawing on past actions in Syria (2017\u20132018), Iran (2019\u20132020), Afghanistan (2018\u20132021), Yemen (2025), and Iran again in June 2025, the author identifies a consistent strategy: launching targeted, high-impact strikes to project strength and deter adversaries\u2014especially Russia and China\u2014while avoiding prolonged conflicts. These operations, described as 'hit and run' tactics, are designed to demonstrate resolve without committing to long-term military engagement. The article notes that Trump\u2019s approach is shaped by his 'America First' doctrine and the influence of key figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who advocates a more interventionist stance in Latin America. The current massive U.S. naval deployment near Venezuela\u2014its largest since 1989\u2014is interpreted as a prelude to potential limited strikes against Venezuelan infrastructure linked to drug trafficking or state-backed criminal networks. However, the author argues Trump is likely to avoid full-scale war, instead seeking a negotiated outcome\u2014such as concessions on resource access or a transition of power\u2014after demonstrating force. The final outcome will depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including tensions between isolationist and interventionist factions within Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Pentagon. The article concludes that while military action is possible, Trump is expected to de-escalate quickly if the situation becomes complex or resource-intensive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 06:52 AM\nSource: [El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/opinion/mauricio-meschoulam/venezuela-eu-que-nos-dice-el-historial-de-trump-sobre-lo-que-podria-venir/)\n\n"
