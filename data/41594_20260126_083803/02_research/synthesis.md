## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on the latest available news reports as of January 26, 2026, there is no concrete evidence to indicate that the United States will attack Iran before April 2026. However, the current political climate suggests elevated tensions and the possibility remains due to the Trump administration's aggressive foreign policy stance.

Key points from recent news:

- There have been references to military threats from the U.S. toward Iran, as part of broader confrontational foreign policy actions, such as the Greenland dispute and sanctions against other nations [1][6]. These threats have contributed to divisions within the U.S. political landscape and strained relations with European allies [1][5][6].

- Diplomatic efforts appear ongoing, as indicated by private communications between former President Trump and European leaders discussing collaboration on Iran [3][9]. This suggests that non-military options are still being pursued.

- Internal U.S. disagreements, such as between Senator Ted Cruz and Vice President JD Vance over foreign policy (including Iran), may act as a restraining factor against immediate military action [5].

- News reports speculate about potential conflicts involving Iran but do not report any specific military preparations or imminent attack plans [4].

It's important to note that international relations are fluid and can change rapidly. The absence of evidence in open-source news does not guarantee that an attack won't occur. However, based on publicly available information up to late January 2026, an attack before April 2026 does not appear imminent.

Factors that could alter this assessment include:
- Escalating incidents in the region (e.g., attacks on U.S. assets by Iranian proxies)
- Changes in U.S. domestic politics (e.g., increased pressure from within the administration)
- Breakdown of diplomatic channels

For the most current updates beyond January 26, 2026, continued monitoring of reliable news sources is advised.

**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**
A large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.' The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.' The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll due to a nationwide internet blackout lasting over two weeks, the largest in Iran's history.

**In Iran, the US-Israeli addiction to hybrid warfare is on full display**
The article argues that the United States and Israel are deeply entrenched in a pattern of hybrid warfare, exemplified by ongoing campaigns against Venezuela and Iran. In Venezuela, the U.S. has pursued long-term objectives to seize oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt and overthrow the leftist government since 2002, using economic sanctions, cyber operations, military strikes, and misinformation. The article claims that under Donald Trump, these tactics escalated to bombing Caracas, kidnapping President Nicolás Maduro, and imposing a naval blockade—acts described as war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is cited as endorsing these actions, motivated by Venezuela’s support for Palestine and ties to Iran. Similarly, the U.S.-Israel hybrid war against Iran dates back to 1953, when the CIA and MI6 orchestrated Operation Ajax to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstall the Shah, who ruled with repression via SAVAK. The article asserts that U.S. actions—including funding Iraq’s war against Iran in the 1980s and withdrawing from the 2015 JCPOA—aim not at diplomacy but at keeping Iran economically crippled and diplomatically isolated. The article criticizes the U.S. and Israel for violating the UN Charter by waging hybrid warfare, which thrives on deception, contradictions, and escalation. It claims such actions have caused widespread chaos, economic devastation, refugee crises, and undermined global stability. The authors argue that the only beneficiaries are the military-tech-industrial complexes in the U.S. and Israel, and they call on the 191 other UN member states to reject regime-change operations, unilateral sanctions, weaponized currency, and the rejection of international law. The article concludes that the American public and global population oppose this deep state brutality but struggle to be heard. The analysis is attributed to Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares, advisors for the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

**Escalation Over Iran: U.S. Military Moves, Israeli Coordination, and Warnings of a Decisive Response**
Tensions surrounding Iran have escalated on both military and political fronts, with U.S. military movements and Israeli security coordination countered by Iran’s warnings of a existential threat from any attack and readiness to respond to the worst-case scenarios. The U.S. Central Command Commander, Brad Cooper, arrived in Israel to hold security and military coordination meetings with Israeli leadership, including Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the Air Force Commander, according to Israeli media and the Haaretz newspaper. Simultaneously, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by three destroyers, arrived in the Indian Ocean from the South China Sea, with plans to join U.S. destroyers already stationed in the Gulf. Iran’s UN mission cited a senior Iranian official stating that any U.S. attack would be considered an existential threat, and that Iran’s military is prepared for the worst-case scenarios. The official also expressed hope that the military buildup is not a prelude to real conflict and mentioned ongoing discussions about reviving nuclear talks. Iran’s Ground Forces and Revolutionary Guard emphasized unity and coordination among armed forces as decisive in thwarting enemy plots. Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Ali Jahanshahi stated that 'unity of the armed forces is the key to defeating the enemy in crises' and affirmed that ground forces will defend Iranian soil alongside the Revolutionary Guard, pledging to defend Iran 'to the death.' Revolutionary Guard Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Mohammad Karami described inter-service coordination as a 'valuable asset' requiring serious preservation and enhancement. Deputy Commander of the Revolutionary Guard Ahmad Vahidi declared that 'it is wrong to retest what has already been tested,' asserting Iran is 'at the peak of its strength' and ready to respond forcefully to any aggression, calling the latest conspiracy against Iran a continuation of the '12-day war.'

**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict. The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters—though Iran’s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei’s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran’s senior officials stated that any attack—limited or unlimited—would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran’s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option—assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran’s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran’s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war—unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.

**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**
The article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**Iran Faces Escalating Conflict Risks Amid Regional Tensions**
Iran is facing increasing risks of conflict in the region, with Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stating that Israel is still attempting to provoke Iran, and that Ankara believes Israel is more eager than the U.S. to reignite hostilities. Fidan cited 'clear signs' of Israel's ongoing efforts to attack Iran, warning that any conflict would open 'wide doors of uncertainty.' Meanwhile, Israel's recent assessments indicate that U.S. military presence in the Middle East has reached its highest level this week, potentially serving as a platform for a large-scale attack on Iran or as a strategic threat to pressure Tehran into negotiating under stricter nuclear terms. In response, an Iranian official emphasized that Iran is on high alert, warning that any action would be met with unprecedented retaliation and could escalate into a 'total war.'

**Trump's Escalation Against Iran: Military Posturing or Strategic Gamble?**
The article claims that former U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for military action against Iran, citing the deployment of the USS Lincoln carrier strike group, F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, and B-2 stealth bombers from Missouri, with the potential for a '12-day war' scenario similar to a 2023 operation. It alleges that Iran's hardline leadership defied Trump's earlier diplomatic overtures by announcing the execution of 800 individuals, escalating tensions. The article speculates that China may have sent 16 Y-20 transport aircraft to Iran to deliver HQ-9BE air defense systems, but this claim is dismissed as likely disinformation due to lack of official confirmation and logistical implausibility—16 Y-20s could only carry one full system. The article analyzes three possible scenarios over the next 48 hours: a limited strike followed by de-escalation (30% probability), a full-scale regional war triggered by Iranian retaliation (20% probability), or a diplomatic de-escalation through third-party mediation (50% probability). It concludes that the real conflict is not military but strategic, involving U.S. pressure tactics, Iranian resilience, and the risk of global escalation, with outcomes shaped more by diplomacy, oil markets, and information warfare than by actual combat.

**Iran Warns of All-Out War in Response to U.S. Military Buildup Amid Escalating Regional Tensions**
Iran has issued a warning that any military attack by the United States would be considered an 'all-out war,' in response to escalating tensions following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to increase military presence in the region. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander, Brad Cooper, met with Israeli officials, while Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner also held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three destroyers toward the Persian Gulf, with the strike group expected to reach the CENTCOM area of responsibility within a week. The deployment will bring an additional 5,700 U.S. troops, along with F-15E fighter jets, to the region. The United Kingdom has sent four Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar’s Al-Duhail Air Base at the request of the Qatari government to enhance defense capabilities. U.S. military cargo planes and Patriot and THAAD missile defense systems have also been deployed to the region. Iran, through an unnamed official speaking to Times of Israel, stated it is prepared for the worst-case scenario and will treat any attack—whether limited, precision-based, kinetic, or otherwise—as an all-out war, vowing the strongest possible response. The conflict escalated after Israel's June 13 attack, prompting Iran to retaliate. On June 22, U.S. aircraft conducted airstrikes on Iranian facilities in Isfahan, Fordo, and Natanz using 14 GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs. Meanwhile, protests in Iran following the December 28 unrest have resulted in official figures of 3,117 deaths, according to Iran's Martyrs and Veterans Foundation, though HRANA reports at least 5,137 killed and 27,797 arrested. Families of protesters claim mistreatment of bodies, with reports from the New York Times describing corpses stacked in morgues in Tehran and Mashhad, including a mother seen begging not to have her son’s body moved from where it lay.

**Iran warns Middle East will "collapse" if government falls amid US threats**
In response to escalating tensions following the deadliest wave of protests in Iran's history—triggered by economic grievances and escalating into nationwide unrest—the Iranian government has warned that the collapse of its regime would lead to a regional collapse, which it claims would benefit only Israel. The death toll from the protests, which began on December 28, 2025 and intensified by January 8, stands at a minimum of 3,117, according to Iranian officials, with over 500 security personnel among the dead; independent human rights groups, such as the U.S.-based HRANA, estimate at least 5,137 deaths. President Donald Trump has escalated U.S. military posture by deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward Iranian waters, declaring that 'all options are on the table' if Iran executes protesters. Trump also falsely claimed to have prevented the hanging of 837 people in Iran, a claim rejected by Iran’s Prosecutor-General Mohammad Movahedi. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that any renewed attack on Iran would provoke a 'ferocious' and prolonged response, potentially engulfing the entire Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed credit for reshaping the Middle East, asserting that Israel is prepared to respond with unprecedented force if attacked, and praised the Iranian people’s 'heroic struggle' against their government. Iran accuses Israel of infiltrating the country through operatives trained in ISIS-held territories and has arrested up to 3,000 alleged members of 'terrorist groups,' including a suspected Mossad agent executed after arrest. Kurdish factions, such as the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) and the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), have claimed responsibility for armed actions during the protests. The Iranian government maintains that foreign-backed militants, including those trained in ISIS-controlled areas, hijacked initially peaceful demonstrations. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel for seeking opportunities to strike Iran, highlighting regional opposition to military confrontation. The 12-Day War between Iran and Israel in June 2025—sparked by an Israeli air campaign and retaliated by Iran with missile and drone attacks—had already significantly altered regional dynamics, weakening Iran’s Axis of Resistance network, particularly after the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. military activity near Iran, including the movement of refueling aircraft and evacuation advisories for personnel at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, has heightened fears of imminent conflict.

**Erdoğan's Secret Diplomacy 'Froze' the Crisis: How a Trump–Iran Confrontation Was Averted**
A behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort involving Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan played a critical role in de-escalating a potential conflict between the United States and Iran, according to an article from pagenews.gr. The crisis, described as existential for Iran, was averted through quiet, controlled signals of restraint from Washington, which allowed Tehran time to respond without immediate foreign intervention. The U.S. prioritized avoiding a regional escalation involving Iran, Israel, and American forces, while Iran sought assurance that its violent crackdown would not trigger direct foreign military action. The backchannel diplomacy—characterized as crisis management rather than peace mediation—involved open lines of communication between Ankara, Tehran, and Washington. The process enabled a managed reduction in tensions without a formal resolution, preserving both sides’ dignity and autonomy. However, the article warns that such 'frozen' crises rarely disappear permanently, often returning later in more intense and dangerous forms, as historical patterns in Iran’s foreign relations suggest. The diplomatic quietude was underpinned by mutual self-restraint and strategic patience, with Erdoğan's role described as pivotal in facilitating the indirect dialogue.

**Iran: U.S. Sows Destabilization Through Humanitarian Narrative**
In a high-impact speech before the United Nations Security Council, Iran's Deputy Representative Gholamhossein Darzi accused the United States and Israel of launching a hybrid war phase to destabilize Iran after failing in their military objectives. Darzi claimed that Washington and Tel Aviv, unable to achieve their goals through direct military force, are now inciting internal unrest, chaos, and extremist activities to undermine Iran's sovereignty. He condemned the U.S. stance as 'deeply cynical,' highlighting the contradiction between portraying itself as an ally of the Iranian people while planning military intervention under humanitarian pretexts. According to Darzi, the U.S. strategy involves fabricating casualties and inflating casualty figures to justify foreign interference—a pattern previously used in Iraq, Libya, and Venezuela to overthrow governments opposing American interests. He cited historical U.S. hostility, including the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq and support for Saddam Hussein’s war in 1980. Darzi stated that the current destabilization campaign follows the failure of a 12-day aggression in June 2025, aiming now to achieve through internal chaos what was not possible on the battlefield. He lamented the deaths of police officers defending public order against externally directed violence and accused the U.S. of using the Security Council meeting to spread disinformation and conceal its role in organizing violent acts inside Iran. Darzi emphasized that Iran does not seek escalation or direct confrontation but warned that any act of aggression would receive a firm, proportionate, and lawful response under the UN Charter. He concluded that this statement is not a threat but a legal reality, holding accountable those who initiate illegal acts for all resulting consequences.

**Netanyahu's Plane Lands in Crete: Harbinger of War?**
On January 14, 2026, Israel's Boeing 767 government aircraft, known as the 'Wing of Zion' (4X-ISR), landed at Heraklion International Airport on Crete, Greece, after departing from Nevatim Airbase. The aircraft remained for approximately one hour before returning to Israel and landing near Beersheba. Israeli officials, including public broadcaster Kan, described the flight as a routine training mission, a maintenance-related rerouting, or a evacuation drill, and confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not on board, as he was appearing in court in Tel Aviv on corruption charges that day. Despite this, social media and analysts questioned the official explanation, citing historical patterns: the same aircraft had previously been observed moving to Greece shortly before Israel's three recent strikes on Iran in 2025. Analysts suggest such movements may serve as a pre-attack 'standard precaution' or 'signal'. Iran's Revolutionary Guards Aviation Commander General Majid Musavi claimed Iran’s military capacity had fully recovered from the '12-Day War' in June 2025, with increased missile stocks and aviation production surpassing pre-war levels, vowing an overwhelming response to any attack. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all planned meetings with Iranian officials were canceled, citing 'senseless killings of protesters', and called on the Iranian people to continue protests, urging them to record the names of 'killers and tyrants' and stating, 'Help is on the way.' This message came amid ongoing anti-regime protests in Iran, where human rights groups report over 2,000 deaths. While official sources maintain the Crete flight was part of a scheduled annual maintenance program, open-source intelligence (OSINT) accounts and international outlets interpret the movement as a potential indicator of escalating regional tensions, especially given the aircraft’s prior behavior before major military actions. Although mainstream media has not yet established a direct link between this flight and an imminent military operation, the convergence of Iran’s military posturing, Trump’s rhetoric, and historical flight patterns has intensified speculation that the flight may signal an impending large-scale conflict.

**Dear Iran, About That Threat to Trump**
The article, published on January 14, 2026, by PJ Media, responds to Iran's public threat against former U.S. President Donald Trump. It argues that the threat, issued amid ongoing domestic repression and protests in Iran, is a miscalculation rooted in a misunderstanding of U.S. resolve. The piece asserts that Iran’s leadership has already witnessed the U.S. dismantle hidden nuclear facilities despite mountainous defenses and conduct a precision military operation to arrest Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela without casualties. It emphasizes that the U.S. does not respond to threats against its presidents with retreat but with escalation, citing Trump’s historical pattern of tightening pressure and removing ambiguity. The article warns that such threats do not enhance Iran’s international standing or solve domestic crises like hyperinflation, energy shortages, and repression, which are fueling protests. It concludes that threats against U.S. presidents signal desperation, not strength, and that Iran risks provoking a response it cannot control. The piece urges Iran to reconsider its strategy, noting that rattlesnakes lose power when their rattle is no longer feared. The article positions itself as a source for 'clarity, context, and consequences' without panic, targeting readers who value 'sharp thinking over loud noise and facts over fear.'

**Iran's Protests Expand Amid Hardline Rhetoric and Escalating Crackdown**
Protests in Iran have expanded geographically and intensified, with the death toll rising to at least 10, according to reports from Associated Press and human rights groups. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei delivered a hardline speech, labeling protesters as 'a group of incited individuals and enemies' who chant anti-Islam and anti-Iran slogans, and asserting that 'disruptors must be brought back to their place.' He claimed that the economic grievances of merchants were being exploited to 'sabotage and create chaos,' while reaffirming the regime's commitment to 'not retreat before the enemy,' vowing to 'force the enemy to bow down.' Despite this, Khamenei acknowledged the historical loyalty of merchants to the Islamic Revolution and admitted that currency fluctuations are not normal, attributing the rise in foreign exchange rates to 'the enemy's actions.' President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed the arrest of some merchants involved in protests, stating the government 'will not use force or retaliation' and pledged to resolve grievances personally. Protests have spread across Tehran’s neighborhoods including Nazimabad, Sadeghiyeh, Star Khan, Narmak, and Tehranpars, with fire outbreaks and violent incidents reported in Qom and Kermanshah. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard and security forces have arrested dozens, including a teenager in Isfahan allegedly carrying a firearm. The Guardian reported that inflation, a 50% increase in food prices, and the aftermath of the 12-day Iran-Israel conflict have fueled unrest. International concern is growing, with Germany’s Foreign Ministry expressing 'deep concern' and urging Iran to uphold its international human rights commitments. The UN fact-finding mission and EU sanctions are under consideration. The Organization of Human Rights emphasized the severity of the crackdown. While the current protests have not yet matched the scale of the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, the ongoing pattern of nighttime demonstrations, expanded arrests, and state media narratives suggest a potential escalation, depending on government response. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning via Truth Social, stating the U.S. 'will intervene to save them' if protesters are attacked, prompting threats from Iranian MP Ismail Kothari, who warned of targeting U.S. bases in West Asia.

**Escalating 'Intensity of Confrontation' Between the U.S. and Iran Amid Protests and Threats**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated following a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to intervene if Iranian security forces used violence against peaceful protesters during nationwide demonstrations over economic and living conditions. Trump stated on Truth Social: 'If Iran shoots and kills peaceful protesters, we will intervene to help them,' adding that the U.S. is ready. Iran's National Security Council Secretary, Ali Shamkhani, responded by warning Trump that any foreign interference in Iran’s internal affairs would destabilize the region and undermine U.S. interests, calling such actions reckless. He emphasized that Iran distinguishes between legitimate public demands and sabotage elements, and criticized Trump for hypocrisy, citing historical U.S. interventions in Iran—such as the 1953 coup, the 1988 downing of Iran Air Flight 655, and the 2025 assassination campaign against Iranian citizens—while accusing the U.S. of using the pretext of 'saving' Iranians to advance its geopolitical agenda. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei reiterated that Iran rejects all external interference, calling Trump’s threats a violation of international law and a continuation of a long pattern of destabilization. Analyst Dr. Mohamed Saad Idris noted that Trump’s rhetoric appears to be part of a broader U.S.-Israel strategy to exploit internal unrest to justify military action against Iran and Hezbollah, especially after the failed June 2025 strike aimed at destabilizing the regime. He argued that while protests began as peaceful economic grievances—triggered by sudden inflation in food, housing, and fuel—some were hijacked by organized elements, including trained operatives with no mobile phones to avoid detection, some led by women. These groups reportedly engaged in sabotage, attacks on police stations, and violence, leading to at least seven deaths among security forces and civilians. Iranian authorities have arrested 30 individuals in Tehran on charges of 'disturbing public order' and announced direct talks with union and business representatives. President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered immediate economic reforms to restore purchasing power, and the government acknowledged the protests and pledged corrective measures. Iranian media outlets, including Tasnim and Mehr, reported that the unrest was fueled by economic shocks and that foreign intelligence operatives, including from Mossad, were involved in inciting violence, turning peaceful demonstrations into chaos. The Iranian response has been both diplomatic and firm, warning of severe consequences for any further escalation.

**Iran Protests Turn Deadly: Trump Warns of U.S. Intervention as Crisis Escalates**
On January 1, 2026, Iran experienced its first reported fatalities from protests, with at least six people killed in demonstrations across three cities—Isfahan, Shiraz, and Kerman—according to Iranian media. The protests, which began as an economic uprising in Tehran’s commercial districts due to hyperinflation and a collapsing rial (falling to 144 million per USD by December 28, 2025), rapidly escalated into a nationwide movement involving merchants, students, workers, and even former supporters of the regime. The unrest marked a historic shift, as traditional bazaar merchants—long considered pillars of the Islamic Republic’s support base—led the resistance. U.S. President Donald Trump, through his platform Truth Social, issued a stark warning: 'If Iran opens fire and violently kills peaceful protesters, we will go to rescue them. We are already ready.' He framed Iran’s actions as part of a longstanding pattern of violence and emphasized that the U.S. was 'already poised.' The statement signaled potential U.S. intervention, ranging from intensified sanctions and cyber support to military deployment or even direct strikes, though the exact nature of 'rescue' remains ambiguous. The crisis has triggered a strategic dilemma for Iran: suppressing the protests risks U.S. military retaliation, while failing to act risks regime instability. The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has remained silent, while President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed willingness to dialogue. Three possible paths have emerged: limited concessions and technical economic fixes; violent crackdown with international escalation; or systemic collapse leading to regime change. The situation has transformed a currency crisis into a high-stakes geopolitical confrontation, with global implications for Middle East stability and U.S.-Iran relations.

**Is Washington Preventing an Israeli Escalation?**
Leveraging insights from informed sources, the article details escalating tensions in Lebanon, with growing indications of a potential large-scale Israeli military operation against Hezbollah, possibly involving a series of concentrated airstrikes rather than a prolonged ground war. The U.S. administration is reportedly engaged in serious internal discussions about this scenario, which is framed as a 'wide but limited' operation aimed at weakening Hezbollah’s military capabilities—targeting infrastructure and key leadership—without immediately triggering a full-scale regional war. However, sources warn that such a limited strike could rapidly spiral out of control, particularly if Iran perceives Hezbollah as facing an existential threat, potentially prompting direct Iranian intervention or the opening of additional fronts. While the U.S. remains reluctant to support a prolonged or open-ended war due to economic and political costs, it may grant Israel a 'limited window' for targeted airstrikes. The article underscores the inherent risk in assuming such operations can remain contained, citing historical patterns in the region where limited actions have led to uncontrollable escalations. Lebanon’s fragile political and military state makes it highly vulnerable to any major shock. Despite ongoing backchannel diplomacy and international mediation efforts, the trajectory of tension suggests a rising likelihood of escalation, with the next phase potentially marking a decisive turning point—especially if the U.S. formally approves such airstrikes. The article concludes that Lebanon stands at a critical juncture, where any reckless move could trigger a regional conflict extending far beyond southern Lebanon.

**Venezuela-EU: What Does Trump’s Past Behavior Suggest About Future U.S. Actions?**
The article analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible return to power. It highlights five key precedents: (I) Limited strikes in Syria in 2017–2018, where Trump responded to chemical weapons use by Bashar al-Assad with targeted attacks that projected strength but avoided escalation; (II) The assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in 2020, followed by a swift de-escalation after Iran retaliated with ballistic missiles, despite initial claims of no casualties; (III) The withdrawal from Afghanistan, where Trump negotiated directly with the Taliban, bypassing the Kabul government, leading to a deal even as attacks continued; (IV) A 2025 campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, launched under pressure from hardliners but quickly concluded with a negotiated settlement; and (V) A 2025 strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, conducted with technological precision and force, but immediately followed by a statement on Truth Social declaring the operation over. The article concludes that Trump’s pattern—'Peace Through Strength'—involves using limited, decisive force to signal resolve, then swiftly seeking negotiation. Given the significant U.S. naval presence near Venezuela, the analysis suggests a high-probability scenario of limited, high-impact strikes aimed at pressuring Nicolás Maduro to resign or negotiate, rather than prolonged conflict. However, outcomes depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including the influence of figures like Marco Rubio and military assessments.

**Trump’s Past Patterns Suggest Limited Military Action, Rapid De-escalation in Potential Venezuela Conflict**
The article by Mauricio Meschoulam analyzes former U.S. President Donald Trump's historical patterns of foreign policy behavior—particularly his use of limited military force followed by rapid de-escalation—to predict potential U.S. actions toward Venezuela under a possible second Trump administration. Drawing on past actions in Syria (2017–2018), Iran (2019–2020), Afghanistan (2018–2021), Yemen (2025), and Iran again in June 2025, the author identifies a consistent strategy: launching targeted, high-impact strikes to project strength and deter adversaries—especially Russia and China—while avoiding prolonged conflicts. These operations, described as 'hit and run' tactics, are designed to demonstrate resolve without committing to long-term military engagement. The article notes that Trump’s approach is shaped by his 'America First' doctrine and the influence of key figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who advocates a more interventionist stance in Latin America. The current massive U.S. naval deployment near Venezuela—its largest since 1989—is interpreted as a prelude to potential limited strikes against Venezuelan infrastructure linked to drug trafficking or state-backed criminal networks. However, the author argues Trump is likely to avoid full-scale war, instead seeking a negotiated outcome—such as concessions on resource access or a transition of power—after demonstrating force. The final outcome will depend on internal U.S. political dynamics, including tensions between isolationist and interventionist factions within Trump’s inner circle and the Pentagon. The article concludes that while military action is possible, Trump is expected to de-escalate quickly if the situation becomes complex or resource-intensive.

### 2024 Iran–Pakistan conflict
. However, both the Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish government refuted this claim and condemned the attack. The Iranian missile attack occurred almost two weeks after the Kerman bombings, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. After conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran targeted Koh-e-Sabz, a locality in the Panjgur District of Pakistan's Balochistan province, which resulted in the death of two Pakistani nationals and injury of three. Pakistan swiftly denounced the attack, taking diplomatic measures by expelling the Iranian ambassador from Islamabad, recalling its own ambassador from Tehran, and issuing a stern warning to Iran regarding potential retaliatory actions. Iran justified its actions by claiming that it had aimed at Jaish ul-Adl, a Baloch insurgent group involved in the Sistan and Baluchestan insurgency. This group had previously claimed responsibility for the 2019 Khash–Zahedan suicide bombing that targeted the IRGC. On 18 January, In a tit for tat move, Pakistan launched a retaliatory strike, codenamed Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar, carried out by the Pakistan Air Force and the Pakistan Army, using drones like the Wing Loong II, multiple rocket launchers like the Fatah MRL, loitering munitions, F-16s, JF-17s, J-10Cs, and other stand-off weapons against seven targets of the Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front terrorists in the Saravan city of Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran. Pakistani aircraft and drones penetrated approximately 12 miles (20 km) into Iranian territory to target the militant hideouts. Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi claimed nine foreign nationals were killed, including three women, four children and two men. Such Pakistani strikes were the first known instances of attacks on Iranian soil since the end of the Iran–Iraq War. Communicating through diplomatic channels on 19 January, both countries agreed to de-escalate and cooperate along the Iran–Pakistan border. Pakistan recalled the Iranian ambassador to Islamabad and reinstated the Pakistani ambassador in Tehran. Foreign Minister of Iran Hossein Amir-Abdollahian visited Pakistan on 29 January 2024 at the invitation of Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani in a push to diffuse the standoff

2024 Iran–Pakistan conflict

. According to the Atlantic Council, Pakistan's strikes against Iran were "well-measured" and left Iran "dazed and shocked." The Council goes on to state that Iran reluctantly agreed to de-escalate because it feared a military humiliation in the event of armed conflict with Pakistan due to Pakistan's traditional Western and Chinese military aid. According to an article by The SAIS Review of International Affairs, China played a major role to mediate the conflict because of its long-standing partnership with both Iran and Pakistan. The article goes on to state that China values a cordial relationship between Iran and Pakistan to maintain its commercial interests in Central and South Asia. China has invested billions of dollars into Pakistan through the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, in which it aims to connect itself to the Arabian Sea and build stronger trade networks with the Middle East. Moreover, China is Iran's largest buyer of oil despite international sanctions against Iran, and it signed the Iran–China 25-year Cooperation Program in 2021, which states that China will invest a large sum of US$400 billion in Iran's economy over that period. However, Michael Kugelman, an American foreign policy expert on South Asia, believes that Pakistan and Iran had enough of a pre-existing cordial relationship to resolve the conflict, and China simply provided a forum to ensure regional cooperation between the two nations. In an article for Chatham House, Chietigji Bajpaee, senior research fellow for Chatham House's South Asia and Asia-Pacific programme, notes that Iran's actions against Pakistan are not directly connected to its actions in the Middle East due to the historically friendly relations between the two countries. Bajpaee notes that both Iran and Pakistan have worked to stabilize Afghanistan and put an end to the Afghan conflict. As a result of these factors, Bajpaee concludes that neither country sought a broader conflict; Iran was already tied up in the Middle Eastern crisis and suffering from an economic crisis, while Pakistan had to address an economic crisis, an upcoming general election, and political unrest. According to Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert on South Asia at the US Institute of Peace, Iran's strikes against Pakistan potentially signaled a threat to rethink its alignment with the United States and not to provide any aid to the U.S. that could be used to counter Iran or its proxies

2024 Iran–Pakistan conflict

. Mir further notes that Iran's refusal to retaliate against Pakistan's strikes on its territory signal that it wishes to avoid a tit-for-tat cycle of conflict with Pakistan, particularly because of Pakistan's superior military and such a conflict would allow Pakistan to regularly violate Iran's sovereignty and erode Iran's ability to deter other adversaries. According to Madiha Afzal, fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, Iran's strikes united a politically polarized Pakistani society, and Pakistan's retaliatory strike "seems to have satisfied the Pakistani political class and public." 2024 Saravan killings 2021 Afghanistan–Iran clashes 2023 Afghanistan–Iran clash 2024 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan 2025 India–Pakistan conflict Mao, Frances; Davies, Caroline; Adams, Paul (18 January 2024).

### De-escalation
. Traditional deescalation training relies on a combination of direct instruction (e.g., lectures, presentations, webinars), group discussion, and live "peer role-play" among class participants. The experiential aspect of role-play (both simulated and with live peers) has been found to be especially important for helping trainees develop core de-escalation skills and be able to deploy those skills in high-pressure situations. Accordingly, in 2023 U.S. Senators introduced S. 2637, to fund the development and distribution of a federal law enforcement training program that uses "live-action simulations and role playing to place law enforcement personnel in an interactive learning environment to replicate real-life scenarios or teach particular skills or techniques." Those skills and techniques must include situational awareness, critical decision-making and problem-solving, crisis intervention, and de-escalation. Work in other fields (especially healthcare) has drawn into question the value of live peer role-play, over other options for interactive training. Researchers have found that this is because the live peer role-play experience can vary so greatly with the quality of the training facilitator and acting skills of one's partner in role-play exercises. Participants reported that peer role-play is generally inferior to other role-play options that are aimed at greater consistency and authenticity. This has led an increasing number of agencies and organizations in healthcare and law enforcement to adopt simulation-based de-escalation training over peer roleplay. Simulation-based training ensures a consistent and engaging experience for all trainees. Simulation-based training follows many of the basic de-escalation approaches noted above (e.g. effective communication and assessment of the scene) but is done through screen-based or head-mounted virtual reality simulator. Notable simulation-based de-escalation training systems include FAAC's MILO Range System (a screen-based simulator) and Apex Officer's Virtual Reality Training (a head-mounted VR simulator). These training systems address a range of de-escalation situations not limited just to work with the mentally ill. Screen-based simulators have been in use in law enforcement training for since the 1990s. While early systems were rudimentary and focused on a single domain (like marksmanship or pursuit driving), by the early 2000s they'd expanded to include de-escalation and other soft skills. Today, screen-based simulators are generally understood to offer the broadest range of training options

De-escalation

. They can run either computer-generated simulations, or those filmed in high-definition video using live actors. These simulations can be used for marksmanship (including live fire ), use-of-force, driving, or de-escalation/interaction/communication training by single officers, groups of officers, or teams of officers and non-law enforcement personal (such as social workers). Head-mounted virtual reality systems like Apex Officer's Virtual Reality Training (introduced to the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) at their 126th Annual Conference and Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in October 2019.) are more limited in their offerings. Despite being more immersive according to some studies, the reliance on lower-fidelity computer-generated environments and characters make such systems better suited to single-person training on decision-making and de-escalation. In the military, de-escalation is a way to prevent military conflict escalation. A historic example is the teaching harvested from the Proud Prophet war simulation of a conflict between the US and the USSR, which took place in 1983. In war-time diplomacy, de-escalation is used as an exit strategy, sometimes called an "off-ramp" or "slip road". In such cases, an alternative peaceful resolution is offered to a belligerent (i.e. nation or person engaged in war or conflict) in order to avoid further bloodshed. Restraint or appeasement against interventionism can in some cases lead to escalation instead of de-escalation. Deterrence is one strategy to decrease conflict severity. In asymmetric conflicts a probabilistic escalation might be rational for one side in some situations, resulting in challenges for de-escalation. "De-escalation through escalation" strategy hopes for increased probability of a diplomatic deal or further de-escalation.

### De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran
The De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a strategy in Iran's foreign policy that began during the second term of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's presidency and with the presidency of Mohammad Khatami since 1997, special attention was paid to this strategy. Hassan Rouhani (7th president of Iran) also mentioned the de-escalation policy as his top priority during his presidency. The "De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran" briefly states that in the face of globalization, Iran's foreign relations with other countries should be based on building trust and resolving past misunderstandings. "De-escalation policy" is based on principles such as the acceptance of political-economic pluralism, peaceful coexistence, the avoidance of ideological conflict, and the abandonment of hegemony and hegemonic policies. According to international relations experts, the implementation of the "De-escalation policy" by Iran led to important successes, including the promotion of Iran's position in OPEC.

The De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a strategy in Iran's foreign policy that began during the second term of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's presidency and with the presidency of Mohammad Khatami since 1997, special attention was paid to this strategy. Hassan Rouhani (7th president of Iran) also mentioned the de-escalation policy as his top priority during his presidency.

"De-escalation policy" is based on principles such as the acceptance of political-economic pluralism, peaceful coexistence, the avoidance of ideological conflict, and the abandonment of hegemony and hegemonic policies. According to international relations experts, the implementation of the "De-escalation policy" by Iran led to important successes, including the promotion of Iran's position in OPEC. The objectives and manners of the "De-escalation policy" in general can be summarized as follows: De-escalation policy is not a final solution of tensions, but an intermediate state that incorporates elements of convergence and permissive, and is typically an effort to promote cooperation and coexistence with governments and to avoid emphasizing and reducing disputes, or reducing tensions in international relations. De-escalating foreign policy typically seeks to remove international obstacles to the country's development and to attract international resources for the country's development and strength. De-escalation is sometimes defined as the most important principle in international relations by resorting to peaceful methods and psychological modernization at the international level and activating diplomacy through bilateral and multilateral dialogue, and its purpose is to improve the level of political and economic relations in order to achieve regional and global security. By adopting a policy of de-escalation with different countries of the world, success in the field of foreign policy is more likely and on the other hand, it prepare the space for improving and promoting exchanges between economic actors of countries. Moving towards a policy of de-escalation does not mean retreating from fundamental positions and backtracking from national interests. Design and implement a set of confidence-building measures to eradicate some of the international system's common misconceptions about Iran, is the most important objective of "De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran"

### De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran
. De-escalation in the sense of rebuilding relations with conflicting international and regional countries in the foreign policy process of countries, Iran started such a process from 1988 onwards. Economic and technological needs along with strategic necessities were the cause of this formation. This process paved the way for the emergence and expansion of the trust-building discourse. Early in the formation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, regional resistance was a reflection of Islamic ideological indicators and led to the growth of the Islamic consciousness movement. In the second decade of the revolution, manifestations of Islamic pragmatism emerged. This was organized during the presidency of Hashemi Rafsanjani. The model of Islamic pragmatism was aimed at increasing national power through international interaction. Since 1997, the ground has been created for the activation of discourse forms related to the Islamic democratic orientation. Each of these discourse forms pursued a specific national role; However, in the first decades of the Islamic Revolution, there were signs of radicalism and Ideological orientation in Iran's foreign policy, in other words, signs of Islamic ideological discourse can be seen in foreign policy; But the change in the internal structure as well as the processes related to the international system can be considered as a factor in transforming the Islamic ideological discourse. In the modern era, manifestations of the discourse of de-escalation emerged. This discourse has been focused on cooperation with the regional and international environment. The "De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran" in foreign policy began in 1988. During this period, a change have been made in the "orientation" and "national role" of Iran's foreign policy. This can be considered a reflection of economic, strategic and security needs. Based on the necessities of the new period, also a change have been made in the priorities of Iran's foreign and economic policy. The first wave of de-escalation can be considered as a factor in rebuilding Iran's relations with the countries around of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The second wave of de-escalation began in 1997. During this period, conditions were provided to improve the level of cooperation between Iran and European countries. The main focus of the second wave of de-escalation was on the expansion of the "confidence-building" process. Iran's economic and strategic cooperation with European countries was enhanced. During this period, extensive efforts were made for "effective participation" of Iran with other countries in the economic and strategic fields

De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran

. This trend was accompanied by reversals in the 2000s. Building trust can be considered a continuation of the policy of de-escalation. With the design of discourse formats, a serious ideal model was formed in the Islamic Republic of Iran and signs of a democratic Islamic discourse emerged in the new atmosphere. Although there have been changes in Iran's foreign policy, it can be considered a continuation of previous discourses. After the election of Mohammad Khatami in August 1997 as the fifth president of Iran and the outline of the new president's plans, the expansion of foreign relations and the handling of foreign issues and affairs continued within the framework of the approach of relative realism. With the difference that the way of expression and the way of dealing with other countries changed and the policy of economic adjustment and government industrial development gave way to political development and in foreign relations, accepting global pluralism means rejecting unipolar system and accepting equality of other cultures. It became the main axis of foreign policy and on this basis, another wave of de-escalation in Iran's foreign policy began. Achieving such goals was not possible in the short term; Because the general opposition of the international system regarding Iran continued. Although in Khatami's presidential term, Iran's economic policy and security behavior pattern were democratic and cooperative in nature; But evidence suggests that the international system had relatively limited flexibility with Iran. Thus, the model of confidence-building and de-escalation led to the formation of signs of a security crisis in Iran. With the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the sixth president of Iran, Iran's foreign policy continued with the slogan of de-escalation and peace in the region and the world. During this presidential term, the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran was designed based on the principles of de-escalation, justice, mutual understanding and the spread of peace and peaceful coexistence in the region and the world. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's foreign policy can be called a non-aligned revisionist. During his eight years, especially in his early years, he tried to fight the current unipolar system by challenging the current hegemony and order in the world system. At the same time, he had invested heavily in the "Non-Aligned Movements" and was trying to create a union among these groups to go to face with the present order

De-escalation policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran

. Emphasizing the inefficiency of the current order, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sought to both challenge the superpower and call international organizations inefficient. Critics say Ahmadinejad's approach has been a source of tension in Iran's foreign policy. After the election of Hassan Rouhani in August 2013 as the seventh president of Iran, he made de-escalation in foreign policy, especially in relation to the United States, his top priority. According to Rouhani, given the country's need for foreign investment to solve economic problems on the one hand and the US domination of world companies and economic institutions on the other hand, it is necessary for Iran's foreign policy to be directed towards de-escalation with the United States. The center of gravity and the main focus of de-escalation with Western countries, especially the United States, was considered the most important Rouhani strategic plan. Rouhani's goal in adopting a de-escalation policy is to promote security, development and normalization of Iran's foreign policy; But this policy has been fundamentally challenged by Trump's rise to power, the change of executive elites in the United States, US hostile policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the intensification of opposition activities at the national, regional, and international levels. To solve economic problems, Rouhani sought to make Iran's foreign policy focus on relations with the United States and cooperation with that country. Rouhani is known in the West as a pragmatic politician who suspended Iran's nuclear program during Khatami's presidency. This, together with the election of Mohammad Javad Zarif as foreign minister, has led Iran's foreign policy to reduce tensions with the West, especially the United States. The election of Hassan Rouhani as president provided a good opportunity to negotiate with the United States. From Rouhani's point of view, the hostile relationship between Iran and the United States is not the right path. All of this points to his de-escalating foreign policy.

### Iran–United States relations
. At the start of Obama's presidency, both sides exchanged public messages signaling a possible thaw, with Iran voicing long-standing grievances and the United States calling for mutual respect and responsibility. However, after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009, which sparked mass protests and allegations of fraud, the United States responded with skepticism and concern. In late 2011 and early 2012, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz and warned a U.S. aircraft carrier not to return to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. rejected the warning and maintained its naval presence, while experts doubted Iran’s ability to sustain a blockade. The 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani, seen as a moderate, marked a shift in tone, with his outreach at the UN and a historic phone call with Obama signaling renewed diplomatic engagement. While high-level contact resumed and symbolic gestures were exchanged, conservative backlash in Iran highlighted internal divisions over rapprochement. In 2015, the United States and other world powers reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement marked a major diplomatic achievement for the Obama administration, though it faced skepticism in Congress and mixed public support in the U.S. Despite the JCPOA, tensions between the United States and Iran persisted over ballistic missile tests, continued U.S. sanctions, and European business hesitancy due to fear of U.S. penalties. The administration also faced criticism for its handling of these issues, both from Iran and from political opponents. Iran–United States relations during the first Trump administration (2017–2021) were marked by a sharp policy shift from Obama's engagement-oriented approach. Trump began with a travel ban affecting Iranian citizens, and withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). A broader maximum pressure campaign followed, with over 1,500 sanctions targeting Iran’s financial, oil, and shipping sectors, as well as foreign firms doing business with Iran, severely damaging its economy. The effort aimed to isolate Iran but met with strong resistance—even from U.S. allies—and often left Washington diplomatically isolated. Iran responded by threatening to resume unrestricted uranium enrichment; rejecting negotiations with the Trump administration, and intensified rhetoric. Tensions escalated in 2019 with U.S. intelligence reports of Iranian threats, attacks on oil tankers, the downing of a U.S

. drone by Iran, and suspected Iranian strikes on Saudi oil facilities. President Trump called off retaliatory strikes, using for cyberattacks and additional sanctions instead. A major escalation followed a December 2019 rocket attack on the K-1 Air Basein Iraq, which led to American airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias and a retaliatory attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. On 3 January 2020, the U.S. assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike, prompting Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and heightened fears of war. The crisis deepened with the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iranian forces and continued through early 2020 with retaliatory strikes and threats. Later in 2020, Iran blamed U.S. sanctions for limiting its COVID-19 response. They launched a military satellite, and were later accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election and proxy attacks. Relations ended under Trump with continued hostility and unresolved disputes. Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration (2021–2025) were shaped by efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement alongside ongoing regional tensions, sanctions, cyberattacks, and proxy conflicts. Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. officials expressed interest in returning to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but negotiations in Vienna eventually stalled. Iran increased uranium enrichment and imposed retaliatory sanctions, while the U.S. imposed new sanctions over missile programs, oil exports, and human rights abuses. Tensions persisted throughout this era, marked by recurring proxy attacks on U.S. bases, which intensified following the outbreak of the Gaza war in late 2023, and by subsequent American retaliatory strikes. The period also saw disputes over the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and military escalations across the Gulf region. In 2023, a breakthrough occurred with a U.S.–Iran prisoner swap and the release of frozen Iranian funds, though indirect diplomacy remained fragile. Iran was later accused of interfering in the 2024 U.S. presidential election through cyber operations and AI disinformation. Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust. In February 2025, Trump said he had given the military and his advisors instructions to obliterate Iran if he were to be assassinated

Iran–United States relations

. He signed the return of the Maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian government. Trump called for talks for a nuclear peace agreement. In February 7 prayer, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei dismissed negotiations and warned Iranian government not to make a deal with US. February 9, Trump said that he would rather make a deal with Iranians than let them be bombed by Israel. In March 2025, Khamenei stated he did not intend to go to negotiations with Trump. IRGC General Salami threatened United States military with devastation. Trump threatened he would hold Iranian regime to blame for any shots fired by Houthis. Putin and Trump reached an agreement that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel. In April, Ali Larijani, advisor to Khamenei, threatened Trump that Iran would make nuclear weapons. Islamic Republic military allegedly had recommended a preemptively strike on US military bases. In April President Trump stated that Iranians want direct negotiations. US–Iran negotiations began on 12 April 2025. In April 2025, U.S. Congressmen Joe Wilson and Jimmy Panetta introduced a 'Free Iraq from Iran' bill. The legislation mandates the development of a comprehensive U.S. strategy to irreversibly dismantle Iran-backed militias, including the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), and calls for the suspension of U.S. assistance to Iraq until these militias are fully removed. The bill also imposes sanctions on Iraqi political and military figures aligned with Iran, and provides support for Iraqi citizens and independent media to expose abuses committed by these militias. Its primary objective is to restore Iraq’s sovereignty and reduce Iranian dominance without resorting to direct military intervention. In his speech his May 2025 trip to Middle East Trump called out the Iranians as the most destructive force and denounced the Iran leaders for having managed to be turning green fertile farmland and rolling blackouts calling on it to make a choice between war and violence and making a deal. On June 7, 2025, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and 27 entities, including Iranian nationals and firms based in the UAE and Hong Kong. These targets include the Zarringhalam brothers, accused of laundering billions via shell companies tied to the IRGC and Iran’s Central Bank. The funds reportedly supported Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, oil sales, and militant proxies. Relations further worsened after Iranian authorities threatened to attack U.S

### 2024 Iran–Israel conflict
. Al Jazeera said the attack was significant given the conflict, and the Institute for the Study of War suggested the strikes were coordinated with Iran. Later, Iran and its proxies attacked Israel with about 300 drones and multiple ballistic missiles. The Houthis, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Badr Organization, and True Promise Corps also launched attacks on Israel under Iranian command. Syria shot down some Israeli interceptors. The United States, United Kingdom, and Jordan intercepted over 100 Iranian drones. The attack caused minor damage to Nevatim Airbase, which remained operational. A 7-year-old Israeli Bedouin child was critically injured by a missile shrapnel, and 31 other civilians suffered minor injuries while rushing to shelters or due to anxiety. Israeli and U.S. officials conducted situational assessments that night. The United States said it would not participate in a retaliatory strike on Iran. Iran threatened that if Israel were to retaliate, directly or indirectly, it would strike back harder. Israel said the attack warranted a response. The United States warned Israel to exercise restraint, and the Israeli war cabinet argued over the scale of Israel's response. Israel delayed plans to start an offensive in Rafah that week so it could determine a response. The war cabinet continued arguments over the Israeli response during the following week. The cabinet considered military and diplomatic options, with international pressure to de-escalate the situation influencing decisions. On 18 April, it was reported that the United States would greenlight a Rafah offensive in exchange for no Israeli strike on Iran. The U.S. and EU tightened sanctions on Iran. On the morning of 19 April, Israel retaliated against Iran. Israel attacked three targets in or near Isfahan International Airport, including a military base. One of the targets was a radar for the Natanz nuclear site. Iran claimed that its air defense shot down all Israeli projectiles and that the explosions were from air defense, but satellite images showed a damaged air defense battery and damage to the radar system. Israel did not comment or claim responsibility for any attack. In southern Syria, SAA bases were targeted, leading to material losses. Explosions and fighter jets were also heard in Iraq, and debris from an Israeli missile was found in central Iraq, suggesting Israel fired from there. Iranian state media downplayed the Israeli strike, and Iranian officials said there was no planned retaliation. An anonymous source told CNN that direct state-to-state strikes were over

. Analysts said the attack and Iranian reaction showed that both sides wanted to de-escalate. On 31 July, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander was assassinated in an Israeli strike on Haret Hreik, in the suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Iranian military adviser Milad Bedi and civilians were also killed in the strike. The strike was retaliation for the Majdal Shams attack, which killed twelve children, that Israel claimed Shukr had ordered. Later that day, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated along with his personal bodyguard in the Iranian capital Tehran by an apparent Israeli attack. Haniyeh was killed in his accommodation in a military-run guesthouse after attending the inauguration ceremony for Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. After the attacks, Iran and Hezbollah pledged retaliation. According to Israeli reports, retaliatory attacks are likely to be launched by multiple members of the Axis of Resistance, including in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as similarly done in the coordinated attack on Israel in April 2024. Many countries warned their citizens to leave Lebanon because of increasing war tensions. The U.S. State Department has been trying to prevent an attack by working through diplomats to send the message to Iran that escalation of the conflict is not in their best interests, and that the U.S. will defend Israel from attacks. Other U.S. officials stated that the successful shoot-down in April relied on good military intelligence about what Iran was planning, but this time the military situation is more uncertain. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei through Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia's security council, to have a restrained response, and not to attack Israeli civilians. The United States military announced the deployment of an additional squadron of F-22 Raptors from the 1st Operations Group of the 1st Fighter Wing; 4,000 marines and 12 ships were deployed to the region as a part of Carrier Strike Group 9 in the Persian Gulf and three Wasp-class amphibious assault ships, two destroyers and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit as a part of the USS Wasp amphibious ready group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea

2024 Iran–Israel conflict

. The Carrier Strike Group 3 including USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) and an unspecified number of cruisers and destroyers along with Carrier Air Wing Nine was also deployed, sent from the Pacific Ocean. On 5 August 2024, NOTAMs were issued to warn pilots regarding the closure or restriction of the airspace of Iran and Jordan, a precaution related to a possible attack by Iran against Israel. On 1 October 2024, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel in two waves. Iranian officials cited the recent assassinations of Hezbollah, Hamas, and IRGC leaders as justification. On 26 October 2024, Israel began attacking Iran, with explosions heard near Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mashhad, Karaj, Kermanshah, Zanjan. Explosions were also heard near Damascus, Syria. On 31 October 2024, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ordered his military officials to prepare for a military response against Israel, with Iranian officials warning that the response to Israel's strikes will be 'harsh' and 'unimaginable'. On the same day, Israeli intelligence suggested that Iran prepared to respond to Israel's attack from within Iraqi territory. The Axios reported that the attack would consist of a large number of drones and ballistic missiles launched from Iraqi territory. In November 2024, Israeli news outlets began reporting that Israel may target the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for its campaign against Israel during its wars on Gaza and on Lebanon. Unnamed officials allegedly told outlets that satellites monitored the transfer of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraqi territory. On 19 November, Israel issued a letter to the UN Security Council asserting its right to self-defense against the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for its military campaign on Israel during its wars on Gaza and Lebanon. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani warned that the letter served as pretext for an attack on Iraq, aligning with Israel's efforts to expand the war in the region. The Israeli security threat towards Iraq caused the Iraqi government to issue a statement that it would take all necessary diplomatic and military actions to protect its sovereignty. On 21 November, the Iraqi government requested an emergency session of the Arab League Council through the Iraqi Permanent Mission to the Arab League to address the Israeli threats against Iraq. The request highlighted Israel's threats in its letter to the UN Security Council, where it sought to expand its aggression in the region to Iraq

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi prompted international backlash against Saudi Arabia and Mohammad bin Salman. The Trump administration issued a statement reiterating its support for Saudi Arabia and blaming Iran for the war in Yemen. The United States Senate responded to the president by passing bipartisan resolutions condemning the assassination and voting to end United States aid to Saudi Arabia for the war in Yemen, though the measures were considered largely symbolic. Military tensions between Iran and the United States escalated in 2019 amid a series of confrontations involving the US, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman took place in May and June. In the wake of growing tensions, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated that Iran sought good relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and their allies, and called on them to end their dispute with Qatar. In September 2019 a drone attack was launched on the Saudi Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq and Khurais oil field in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The attack knocked out half of the country's oil supply. Although the Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Iran was behind the attack, a charge which Iran denied. Saudi Arabia and the US were reportedly investigating whether the attacks involved cruise missiles launched from Iran or Iraq. US officials had previously concluded that the attack on the East-West pipeline was launched by Iranian-backed militias in southern Iraq, despite Houthi rebels also claiming responsibility. On 16 September, the US told Saudi Arabia that it had concluded that Iran was a staging ground for the September attack. The US raised the prospect of a joint retaliatory strike on Iran, an action which would potentially broaden into a regional conflict. Saudi Arabia said its investigation was ongoing, but officials alleged that Iranian weapons were used in the strikes and that the attacks were not launched from Yemen. The claims were made without supporting evidence. Iran's Hassan Rouhani, after the attack on Aramco, claimed that Saudi Arabia should take it as a warning to stop its intervention in Yemen. The Saudi-led intervention has led to the deaths of more than thousands to date. On 3 January 2020, the US launched an airstrike on a convoy near Baghdad International Airport that killed multiple passengers, including Iranian Major general and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. The military action came shortly after pro-Iran protesters and Iraqi militiamen attacked the US embassy in Baghdad on 31 December 2019 in response to US airstrikes targeting Iran-backed militia. The airstrike was seen as a major escalation of tensions, and the government of Iran vowed revenge in response. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the attack "an extremely dangerous and foolish escalation" and released a statement saying that "the brutality and stupidity of American terrorist forces in assassinating Commander Soleimani... will undoubtedly make the tree of resistance in the region and the world more prosperous." On 7 January, Iran attacked Al Asad Airbase and Erbil International Airport in Iraq as an act of revenge. The attack left 110 injured. Hours after the missile attacks, during a state of high alert, IRGC forces mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people on board. On 12 January, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah called for Iran's allies in the Axis of Resistance—including Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah, the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Houthi movement in Yemen—to intensify its military campaigns against the U.S. to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East. During a state visit by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei called for regional cooperation against the U.S. However, following discussions between Sheikh Tamim and President Rouhani, Tamim concluded that de-escalation and dialogue were the only means to resolve the regional crises. In response to the increased tensions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and many U.S. states released advisories warning of Iranian cyberattacks, while the Texas Department of Information Resources said Iranian cyberattacks had reached a rate of 10,000 per minute. The 2019 Warsaw Conference would later lead to the Abraham Accords, with Saudi allies UAE and Bahrain normalizing relations with Israel. This was followed by Morocco and Sudan. This would later lead to the Arab–Israeli alliance, and the Negev Summit. The U.S. , along with Israel allegedly announced the formation of the Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD) in June 2022 with the purpose of countering Iran. Israel stated delegations from the U.A.E, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. participated in broker talks

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. In 2022, Iran and Saudi Arabia participated in peace talks brokered by Iraq. In July of that year, the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, alongside Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and the United States participated in the Jeddah Security and Development Summit (JSDS). In the summit, members called on Iran to stop intervening in other countries' affairs, and U.S. President Joe Biden ensured that they will not let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and Israel of meddling within their internal affairs due to the Mahsa Amini protests. In late October 2022, Saudi intelligence was shared to the U.S., warning of an imminent attack by Iran, which placed the GCC, Iraq, and Israel on high alert. The intelligence showed that Iran was allegedly planning to strike Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. Iran denied these accusations and intel as baseless. Since April 2021, Iraq has hosted five rounds of direct talks between the two nations, which cut diplomatic ties in 2016. The 6th round of talks on a ministerial level stalled, but after a meeting in Amman, Jordan, in December 2022, Iran's Hossein Amirabdollahian and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud signaled that both countries would be "open to more dialogue". Despite increased rhetoric by Iran against Saudi Arabia, the Saudis support efforts to revive the stalled Iran nuclear deal. However, the Saudi minister threatened to nullify the negotiations and following agreement if Iran were to obtain nuclear weapons. In January 2023, the Saudi foreign ministers Al Saud speaking at a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos reiterated that "Riyadh is trying to find a dialog with Iran". He welcomed the decision by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to focus on their economies "towards joint prosperity". The two countries announced the resumption of relations on 10 March 2023, following a deal brokered by China. The agreement was signed by secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran Ali Shamkhahni and Saudi Arabian national security advisor Musaed Al-Aiban. A joint statement announced that their embassies would re-open within two months. The United Nations Secretary General, Hezbollah, Oman, UAE, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia welcomed the reapproachment, while two former Israeli Prime Ministers criticized it
