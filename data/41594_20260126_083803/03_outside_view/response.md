Step 1: Source Analysis  
• Main sources:  
  – Congressional Research Service (CRS) chronologies of U.S. overseas military operations (1945-present)  
  – Department of Defense historical timelines  
  – Secondary compilations: Correlates of War “Militarized Interstate Disputes,” Wikipedia “U.S. military operations” lists, academic literature on U.S. use of force.  
• Coverage: For overt, acknowledged strikes these datasets are highly complete from 1945 onward; they miss some covert/CIA actions but those are outside our resolution definition (“United States attack”).  
• Reliability: Medium-high. Dates, targets and scale are well documented.  
• Systematic biases:  
  1. Gray-zone or proxy activity sometimes excluded.  
  2. Small single-day airstrikes can be inconsistently coded.  
  3. Borderline cases (e.g., drone strike on Iranian general in Iraq) require judgment about whether the “target country” was attacked.  

Step 2: Reference Class Analysis  

Reference Class 1: U.S. direct military attacks on Iran, 1979-2023  
• Events counted: 1987 “Nimble Archer,” 1988 “Praying Mantis.” (Both part of the tanker war; same 8-month episode → counted as one attack episode.)  
• Historical base rate: 1 episode in 44 years = 2.3 % per year → 5.2 % in a 2.25-year window (Oct 2023-Apr 2026).  
• Sample size: 1  
• Suitability score: 8/10 (exact target match but tiny N).  
• Why: Directly answers “How often has the U.S. struck Iranian territory or forces?”  

Reference Class 2: U.S. attacks on any adversarial Middle-East state, 1979-2023  
• Counted episodes: Libya 1986, Iraq 1991, Iraq 1998, Iraq 2003, Syria 2014 (ISIS), Syria chemical-response 2017, 2018, Libya 2011, Afghanistan 2001, Yemen (overt cruise-missile) 2016. ≈ 10 episodes.  
• Base rate: 10 episodes / 44 years = 0.23 per year → 51 % per 2.25 years that the U.S. attacks at least one ME state.  
• Probability it is Iran (one of roughly six perennial adversaries) ≈ 1/6 ⇒ 8.5 %.  
• Sample size: 10  
• Suitability score: 6/10 (regional similarities, still small N, needs scaling to Iran).  
• Why: Captures frequency of U.S. force use in same theater with comparable stakes.  

Reference Class 3: U.S. overt attacks on any sovereign state worldwide, 1945-2023  
• Episodes (air/sea/ground) ≈ 30 (Korea 1950, Vietnam 1965, Grenada 1983 … Syria 2018).  
• Base rate: 30 / 78 years = 0.38 per year → 69 % per 2.25 years that the U.S. attacks somebody.  
• Adjust for “which country?” Roughly 30 potential adversaries on the globe at any time ⇒ 69 % / 30 ≈ 2.3 % for any specific state.  
• Sample size: 30  
• Suitability score: 4/10 (broad, but good N).  
• Why: Provides a long-run global baseline for U.S. use of force against a particular state.  

Step 3: Fermi Cross-Check  
P(U.S. initiates a new limited or major attack in 2.25 years) ≈ 0.30  
P(Target = Iran | attack occurs) ≈ 0.15  
P(Attack on Iran) ≈ 0.30 × 0.15 ≈ 4.5 %  
(Consistent with reference-class outputs.)  

Step 4: Base Rate Integration  
Weighting by suitability: RC1 0.5, RC2 0.3, RC3 0.2  
Integrated base rate = (0.5 × 5.2) + (0.3 × 8.5) + (0.2 × 2.3)  
= 2.6 + 2.6 + 0.5 ≈ 5.7 %  

Rounded to nearest whole percent: 6 %.  

Step 5: Confidence Assessment  
Confidence level: 5/10 (moderate).  
– Strength: Good documentation of U.S. military actions.  
– Weakness: Small number of Iran-specific cases, judgment calls in counting episodes, need to scale broader classes down to one country.  

Base Rate Estimate: 6 %

Reference Classes Used:  
1. Iran-specific attacks: 5.2 % base rate (weight 0.5)  
2. Middle-East adversary attacks: 8.5 % base rate (weight 0.3)  
3. Global state-level attacks: 2.3 % base rate (weight 0.2)  

Confidence Level: 5  

Key Uncertainties:  
• Definition of “attack” (size, covert vs. overt, attack on Iranian forces outside Iran).  
• Number of potential adversaries used to down-scale broader reference classes.  
• Whether 1987-88 events should be counted as one or two separate attack episodes.
