Step 1: Source Analysis  
• Recency: The most recent information comes from news articles published on January 26, 2026. They are current but cover a turbulent and fast‐changing political moment.  
• Credibility: The main sources (e.g., Euronews) are reputable, but the coverage is highly charged and includes politically sensitive language that may exaggerate rhetorical threats.  
• Bias and Pricing In: Some of the aggressive language (e.g., dramatic images, threat slogans) may be more about political posturing than about concrete plans. Much of this “evidence” may already have been partially factored into historical base-rate conditions for U.S. attacks on Iran.  

Step 2: Evidence Classification  
• STRONG Evidence:  
  – Evidence A: Reports of U.S. military assets (such as F-15E Strike Eagles) being deployed to the region alongside announcements of warships nearby. This indicates that U.S. military posture is being adjusted, which can be a precursor to military action.  
  – Evidence B: Public statements—such as references to potential June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites—that, though not an announcement of an immediate attack, signal an escalation in rhetoric and preparedness.  

• MODERATE Evidence:  
  – Evidence C: Diplomatic back channels (e.g., discussions between former President Trump and European leaders) signal that non-military solutions are being seriously pursued even as threats persist.  
  – Evidence D: Internal disagreements within U.S. leadership (e.g., diverging views between senators and the executive branch) can act as a restraining factor against an impulsive military decision.  

• WEAK Evidence:  
  – Evidence E: The dramatic tone of the billboard in Tehran and other rhetoric that, while emotionally charged, may overstate the immediacy of the threat.  
  – Evidence F: Speculative news commentary on potential “conflict clouds” which, in absence of concrete operational orders, are best seen as situational color rather than actionable intelligence.

Step 3: Direction of Update  
• Evidence A (UP): Deployment of advanced assets suggests increased readiness. This might push the probability upward by about +1 percentage point.  
• Evidence B (UP): Public statements about potential strikes add another roughly +0.5 percentage point, signaling that escalation is on the table.  
• Evidence C (DOWN): Active diplomatic engagement and clear efforts to avoid military escalation push the probability downward by approximately −1 percentage point.  
• Evidence D (DOWN): Internal disagreement reduces the likelihood of a unified decision to attack, contributing another −0.5 percentage point downward.  
• Evidence E & F (Neutral/Already priced in): The dramatic symbolism and speculation are likely already reflected in the base rate; no additional significant adjustment needed.

Step 4: Integration  
Starting from the base rate of 6.0%:  
• Adjustment 1: +1.0% for the deployment of advanced military assets (Evidence A).  
• Adjustment 2: +0.5% for aggressive public threat statements (Evidence B).  
• Adjustment 3: −1.0% for active diplomatic engagement (Evidence C).  
• Adjustment 4: −0.5% for internal U.S. political disagreements (Evidence D).  
Cumulative adjustment: +1.0% +0.5% −1.0% −0.5% = 0%

Step 5: Sanity Checks  
1. Extremity Check: Our final prediction is around 6.0%. If this were off, it would require either dramatically more concrete operational data supporting imminent strikes or evidence of a complete breakdown in all diplomatic channels—both seem absent given current evidence.  
2. Base Rate Anchor: The 6.0% base rate is drawn from several decades of comparable events; the moderate changes in the current environment do not justify large deviations.  
3. Update Magnitude: The slight adjustments are proportional to the quality and strength of the new evidence.  
4. Regression to the Mean: Extreme outlier probabilities (very high or very low) are unwarranted here, as our risk conditions remain similar to historical situations.

Step 6: Final Reasoning  
Quantitatively, while there are signals of escalation (deployment of assets and aggressive statements) that might slightly increase the odds of an attack, simultaneous evidence—such as active diplomacy and internal political divisions—dampens the likelihood of an immediate military decision. Given that the base rate for U.S. direct attacks on Iran (and similar adversarial contexts) has been around 6.0%, the current evidence, when balanced, does not substantively alter that probability. In summary, the available data yields an essentially neutral net adjustment on the base rate.

Evidence Summary:  
• Strong evidence pointing UP:  
  – Deployment of advanced U.S. military assets near Iran.  
  – Public statements hinting at future military strikes.  
• Strong evidence pointing DOWN:  
  – Ongoing diplomatic negotiations and back-channel communications indicating pursuit of non-military resolutions.  
  – Internal U.S. disagreements reducing the coherence of an aggressive military decision.  
• Net direction: NEUTRAL

Adjustment Calculation:  
• Base rate: 6.0%  
• Total adjustment: 0%  
• Final estimate: 6.0%

Confidence in Adjustment: 7/10

Probability: 6.0%
