## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on the latest verified reports, the United States is highly unlikely to launch a military attack on Iran before April 2026. Key reasons include:  
- **Dominance of economic/diplomatic tools**: U.S. strategy emphasizes sanctions over force [8], with European allies opposing military escalation [5][10].  
- **Internal U.S. constraints**: Political infighting (e.g., Cruz-Trump rift [3]) and resource allocation to domestic crises [1][6] reduce bandwidth for war.  
- **No military indicators**: Absence of troop movements, drills, or explicit threat timelines in credible reports [2][8][10].  
- **Global backlash risk**: Alienation of NATO over Greenland threats shows unilateral action would fracture alliances [5][10].  

However, volatility remains high. Monitor for:  
1. Sudden sanctions breakdown or Iranian provocations.  
2. U.S. troop deployments to the Middle East.  
3. Israel-linked incidents that could draw U.S. involvement.  
Reassess if any occur.

**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**
A large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.' The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.' The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll due to a nationwide internet blackout lasting over two weeks, the largest in Iran's history.

**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**
Geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation. The situation has intensified as of January 25, 2026, according to TimesNow, though specific details about the deployments, threats, or regional reactions are not provided in the article.

**Protests, Threats, carrier strike group: How US-Iran tensions escalated again**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated significantly, reigniting a long-standing conflict amid ongoing protests in Iran that began in late December 2025. Over 500 people have been killed, and widespread property damage has occurred during anti-government demonstrations triggered by economic collapse, inflation, currency devaluation, and subsidy cuts. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the U.S. of instigating the unrest. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump issued multiple threats, including vowing to 'wipe out Iran' and 'obliterate' its nuclear capacity during potential strikes in June 2025, while also calling Khamenei 'a sick man' and demanding new leadership. Iran retaliated with a firm warning: any attack would trigger a full-scale war. The deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group—comprising a central aircraft carrier, escort warships, and fighter jets—near Iran has heightened fears of a major military confrontation. The situation intensified in January 2026, with Trump stating in an interview that 'anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,' and reaffirming in Davos that Iran 'does want to talk, and will talk.' A senior Iranian official declared the U.S. military presence a direct threat and vowed retaliation using 'everything at its disposal.'

**Why US-Iran Relations Are Deteriorating Again After a Short-Lived Calm?**
US-Iran relations have deteriorated again after a brief period of reduced tension, following a surge in internal unrest in Iran that began in late December 2025. The unrest, sparked by economic grievances including high inflation, a collapsing currency, and declining living standards, escalated into widespread political protests. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet and phone blackout on 8 January 2026, aiming to suppress coordination and limit information flow. Activist groups report over 5,000 deaths, though exact figures remain uncertain due to communication restrictions; the Guardian quoted an Iranian official acknowledging thousands died, blaming 'terrorists and armed rioters.' The Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with Kurdish regions experiencing the worst violence. The US response intensified after President Donald Trump declared Washington would 'come to their rescue,' urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions,' and warned that any attack on him would result in 'wiping them off the face of this earth.' On 14 January 2026, the US reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but the operation was halted at the last moment due to pressure from regional allies, including Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned of unpreparedness for retaliation, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who urged caution. A temporary calm followed, with restored internet access, a halt to executions (though Iran’s chief prosecutor denied mass executions were planned), and reduced public protests, though anti-Khamenei slogans persisted in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan. The pause ended when Trump warned of a 'big flotilla' of US warships approaching Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group, which he described as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran responded sharply: military spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would trigger 'war' and that Iran would 'set fire to their world.' Iran’s Revolutionary Guard stated it has its 'finger on the trigger,' and an Iranian official told Reuters that any attack—limited, surgical, or kinetic—would be considered full-scale war. The US faces uncertain outcomes: limited strikes might embolden protesters and undermine regime confidence, but could also provoke intensified repression. Experts emphasize that Iran’s political future hinges on domestic dynamics, not foreign military intervention. The US carrier group provides strategic leverage, but Iran may respond with calibrated escalation to avoid full war. However, targeting Khamenei would likely trigger an unpredictable and catastrophic conflict.

**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict. The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters—though Iran’s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei’s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran’s senior officials stated that any attack—limited or unlimited—would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran’s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option—assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran’s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran’s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war—unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.

**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**
The article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**Iran's Ambassador to Spain: 'If There Is a Threat from Trump Against Denmark, Why Not Against Iran?'**
Reza Zabib, the Iranian ambassador to Spain, stated in an interview with Europa Press that Iran cannot rule out a potential U.S. attack, especially given former U.S. President Trump's threats against countries like Denmark. He emphasized that Iran is prepared to confront any foreign aggression, whether from the United States or the 'Zionist regime.' Zabib confirmed that direct and indirect diplomatic channels with the U.S. administration remained active during periods of heightened tension, noting that Iran has never withdrawn from such communication and responds to reasonable messages. He praised regional countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel for avoiding military escalation, calling it a wise move based on the principle that security is indivisible. Zabib dismissed claims by European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, that Iran's regime is nearing collapse, accusing Western media and political narratives of exaggerating events and spreading misinformation. He referenced the 1953 coup (Operation Ajax) as a historical precedent for foreign interference and asserted that Iran has successfully resisted both direct aggression in June 2025 and a covert terrorist operation. Iran remains open to negotiation, citing the 2015 nuclear deal as proof, but insists it is prepared to defend itself if other actors choose confrontation.

**Tensions Surge in Middle East: U.S. Military Buildup and Iran's Bunkerized Leadership Amid Escalating Crisis**
Tensions between the United States, Israel, and Iran have escalated, with reports indicating that U.S. military forces are deploying aircraft carriers and fighter jets to the Middle East amid fears of an imminent American strike on Iran. Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), met with Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Eyal Zamir in a lengthy and personal meeting, underscoring the deepening strategic military cooperation between the two nations. The U.S. Department of State released a hardline message on X (formerly Twitter) in Persian, stating that violence is an integral part of Iran’s political strategy since 1979, citing the suppression of protests, including the killing of Mahsa Amini and the use of 18-wheel trucks instead of ambulances during crackdowns. According to Time magazine, citing anonymous Iranian health officials, over 30,000 people may have been killed in just two days of protests in early January 2026—far exceeding the official government figure of 3,117. Iran International reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has reportedly retreated into a bunker, with his son Masoud Khamenei acting as a proxy. Iranian Revolutionary Guards declared readiness to follow orders, stating 'We have our finger on the trigger.' Satellite images show damage to Iran’s nuclear sites, including Fordow and Isfahan. U.S. military activity includes the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, increased fighter presence in Jordan, and a spike in Pentagon Pizza Meter deliveries—used as an informal indicator of geopolitical stress. Meanwhile, several airlines suspended flights to Middle Eastern capitals, only to resume after U.S. envoy Steven Witkoff and Jared Kushner arrived in Israel to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu. The article notes that while the situation is highly volatile, the presence of high-level U.S. officials may be delaying a potential military escalation.

**Iran-US tensions LIVE: Trump vs Tehran war of words intensifies with US warships on standby**
Iran-US tensions escalated in early January 2026 amid a backdrop of recent protests and a severe government crackdown. President Donald Trump stated that the US was positioning naval warships closer to the region 'just in case' he decides to act, following earlier warnings of an 'armada heading' toward Iran. In response, Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander, Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, issued a defiant statement, saying Iran's forces are 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger,' prepared to execute orders from the Commander-in-Chief. Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to India publicly thanked New Delhi for voting against a UN Human Rights Council resolution it deemed 'unjust and politically motivated,' calling India's stance 'principled and firm' during a time of heightened Iran-US tensions. The protests, which began in late December 2025 over economic hardship and the collapse of the rial, led to a widespread internet shutdown—the longest and most comprehensive in Iran’s history—severely restricting communication. Activists claim at least 5,000 people were killed during the crackdown, a figure not confirmed by Iranian authorities. By early January 2026, protests appeared to subside, largely due to the communications blackout limiting the flow of footage from the country.

**Escalation Over Iran: U.S. Military Moves, Israeli Coordination, and Warnings of a Decisive Response**
Tensions surrounding Iran have escalated on both military and political fronts, with U.S. military movements and Israeli security coordination countered by Iran’s warnings of a existential threat from any attack and readiness to respond to the worst-case scenarios. The U.S. Central Command Commander, Brad Cooper, arrived in Israel to hold security and military coordination meetings with Israeli leadership, including Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the Air Force Commander, according to Israeli media and the Haaretz newspaper. Simultaneously, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by three destroyers, arrived in the Indian Ocean from the South China Sea, with plans to join U.S. destroyers already stationed in the Gulf. Iran’s UN mission cited a senior Iranian official stating that any U.S. attack would be considered an existential threat, and that Iran’s military is prepared for the worst-case scenarios. The official also expressed hope that the military buildup is not a prelude to real conflict and mentioned ongoing discussions about reviving nuclear talks. Iran’s Ground Forces and Revolutionary Guard emphasized unity and coordination among armed forces as decisive in thwarting enemy plots. Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Ali Jahanshahi stated that 'unity of the armed forces is the key to defeating the enemy in crises' and affirmed that ground forces will defend Iranian soil alongside the Revolutionary Guard, pledging to defend Iran 'to the death.' Revolutionary Guard Ground Forces Commander Brigadier General Mohammad Karami described inter-service coordination as a 'valuable asset' requiring serious preservation and enhancement. Deputy Commander of the Revolutionary Guard Ahmad Vahidi declared that 'it is wrong to retest what has already been tested,' asserting Iran is 'at the peak of its strength' and ready to respond forcefully to any aggression, calling the latest conspiracy against Iran a continuation of the '12-day war.'

**Why US-Iran Relations Are Deteriorating Again After a Short-Lived Calm?**
US-Iran relations have deteriorated again after a brief period of reduced tension, following a surge in internal unrest in Iran that began in late December 2025.

While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**USS Abraham Lincoln's Movement Toward Arabian Sea Sparks Tensions with Iran Amid Escalating Rhetoric and Strategic Uncertainty**
The USS Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier of the U.S. Navy, is moving through the Strait of Malacca and heading toward the Arabian Sea, according to a report by the U.S. Naval Institute. This movement has heightened tensions, as the vessel is entering range of Iran's military strike capabilities. The carrier has turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder, a move common in military operations for security but now amplifying uncertainty amid already high U.S.-Iran tensions. Iran has issued a direct warning stating, 'Our finger is on the trigger,' interpreted as a clear military threat. In response, the U.S. has affirmed its military advance in that direction. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has added pressure, warning that if Iran does not agree to a deal, U.S. actions could become even stricter, signaling a 'pressure strategy.' The U.S. Naval Institute notes that while turning off AIS is part of military tactics, the geopolitical context deepens the strategic implications. Analysts question whether this deployment is a show of pressure or a prelude to a major military confrontation, recalling historical precedents where similar moves either led to diplomacy or escalated into war. The world now watches closely to see if this crisis remains confined to warnings or triggers a larger conflict.

**Analysts Warn Iran’s Instability Could Trigger Nuclear Proliferation Risks**
Analysts warn that internal instability in Iran’s theocratic regime, exacerbated by escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran following Tehran’s crackdown on protests, could heighten the risk of nuclear proliferation. Although former U.S. President Trump appears to have abandoned military strikes, he still called for ending Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s nearly 40-year rule on April 17, 2024. Meanwhile, a U.S. aircraft carrier moved from the South China Sea through Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, positioning itself on a potential route to the Middle East. David Albright, founder of the Washington-based non-profit Institute for Science and International Security and a former Iraqi nuclear inspector, stated that during internal chaos, Iran may lose its ability to protect its nuclear assets. He highlighted the 440.9 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60% purity—close to the 90% threshold for weapons-grade material—as particularly concerning, noting that portions could be stolen. Historical precedent exists: after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, weakened security led to the disappearance of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. Despite Israel’s 12-day attack and U.S. bombing in June 2024, Iran has maintained control over its nuclear facilities. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran’s 60% enriched uranium stockpile remains unverified since the June 2024 conflict, with IAEA losing continuous monitoring records. An IAEA-affiliated diplomat confirmed the agency has not received updated information on the stockpile’s status or location. Albright noted the material could fit into 18–20 cylindrical containers, each weighing about 50 kg and easily movable by two people. Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation policy at the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, warned that the stockpile could be transferred to secret programs or stolen by factions within Iran’s government or military seeking to retain nuclear weapons options. She emphasized that the risk is real but difficult to assess due to the lack of transparency, especially during periods of internal instability or potential regime collapse, when nuclear materials might be smuggled out or sold to non-state actors.

**War, Diplomacy, or Revolution: What Lies Ahead for Iran?**
Following the largest protests in Iran in years, a tense silence has returned to the streets after a wave of violent crackdowns. Residents of Tehran described the atmosphere as eerily calm, resembling the Iranian New Year (Nowruz) holiday, but without any celebration—only a sense of dread. The Iranian regime, weakened by recent conflicts with Israel and the U.S., the loss of regional allies, and internal instability, faces its most serious threat to survival since 1979. Protests, initially sparked by economic grievances, rapidly evolved into mass demands to overthrow the regime, with some calling for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last Shah. The crackdown has reportedly killed nearly 3,000 people, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights News Agency (HRANA), though CNN cannot independently verify the figure. The U.S. under Donald Trump has threatened military action if Iran continues violence, but recent reports indicate a pause in killings, possibly due to diplomatic pressure from Gulf states including Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Despite a temporary de-escalation, analysts warn that the risk of U.S. or Israeli strikes remains. The balance of power has shifted dramatically: Iran’s nuclear facilities were severely damaged in U.S. strikes, and its regional proxies have been neutralized by Israel. While Iran still holds a large stockpile of highly enriched uranium, its military and symbolic strength has been significantly weakened. Experts like Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute argue that the root causes of tension remain unresolved. Even if diplomacy resumes, Iran enters negotiations from its weakest position ever. The U.S. is expected to demand limits on Iran’s missile program and its support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah—issues Iran has historically refused to negotiate. Past precedents, such as Iran’s acceptance of a ceasefire after the Iran-Iraq War, suggest that survival may require painful concessions. However, the social contract between the regime and the people is now 'irreparably damaged,' as the state has used brutal force not only against external threats but also against its own citizens. There is no effective domestic opposition, and exiled groups remain divided. Reza Pahlavi has emerged as a potential transitional figure, but his return is controversial and lacks broad support. Analysts warn that regime collapse could lead to state fragmentation due to Iran’s ethnic and regional diversity. Nevertheless, the cycle of protest suggests another wave is inevitable—history shows that the 1979 revolution took a full year of sustained unrest before toppling the Shah.

**Gulf on edge: Iran warns it will target US military bases if attacked**
Tensions in the Gulf have escalated as Iran has warned Qatar and Saudi Arabia it will target U.S. military bases if attacked, according to Middle East expert Professor Mehran Kamrava of Georgetown University in Qatar. The movement of some U.S. personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—described as precautionary by Qatari officials—reflects growing regional fears of direct U.S.-Iran conflict. Kamrava emphasized that Iran’s 'axis of resistance' has collapsed, forcing Tehran to rely on ballistic missiles for retaliation, with no political room to avoid responding if the U.S. strikes. He stated, 'If Iran is hit, they will hit American targets in the region,' and warned that retaliation would be 'much more lethal' than in the past. He cited historical precedents, including the 2020 killing of General Qassem Soleimani and June 2025 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, to underscore the consistency of Iranian responses. Additionally, Kamrava noted that protests in Iran—originating from economic hardship and rial collapse—have intensified due to government overreaction and external influence, with widespread anti-government sentiment now prevalent. He stressed that a sober assessment of consequences is essential to prevent further escalation, saying, 'You can't hit Iran and be done with it.'

**Why is Iran erupting again: Economy in free fall, mass unrest**
Nationwide protests in Iran, sparked by the collapse of the rial and a worsening economic crisis with inflation reaching approximately 40%, have led to a deadly government crackdown, internet blackouts, and heightened tensions with the United States. Over 600 protests have occurred across all 31 provinces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, reporting at least 646 deaths and over 10,700 arrests—figures not independently verified due to internet restrictions. The Iranian government has not released official casualty numbers. The economic crisis intensified after the UN reimposed sanctions in September 2023 over Iran’s nuclear program, causing the rial to fall to over 1.4 million to USD 1. Price increases on subsidized gasoline and the end of preferential exchange rates for food products have further strained the population. Protests began in late December 2025 among Tehran merchants and expanded to include anti-government slogans, with some protesters supporting exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Iran’s regional 'Axis of Resistance' has weakened significantly: Hamas was defeated in Gaza, Hezbollah’s leadership was decimated, and Syria’s President Bashar Assad was overthrown in December 2024. China continues to buy Iranian oil, but neither China nor Russia has offered overt military support. The West remains concerned about Iran’s nuclear program; although US intelligence assesses Iran has not yet begun weaponization, it has conducted activities that could enable it. Iran recently claimed to have stopped uranium enrichment, signaling openness to negotiations, but no talks have occurred since the June 2025 US-led attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Tensions between Iran and the US stem from historical enmity: the 1979 Islamic Revolution severed diplomatic ties after the hostage crisis, and US actions during the Iran-Iraq War, including the downing of an Iranian airliner, deepened mistrust. Relations briefly improved with the 2015 nuclear deal, but Trump’s 2018 withdrawal reignited conflict, especially after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. US President Donald Trump has warned that if Iran violently suppresses protesters, the US will intervene, citing the recent capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro as a precedent.

**Does Donald Trump Have a Justified Reason to Intervene in Iran? A Radio Debate on Military Options and Historical Precedents**
On January 9, 2026, protests continued for the eighth day in Tehran, Iran, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Donald Trump reiterated the possibility of U.S. military intervention in Iran, stating, 'If they start killing people again like they did in the past, I think the United States will hit them very hard.' The discussion on Sud Radio analyzed the feasibility of such action, noting that while the U.S. currently has no aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, it maintains 11 active carriers and a major air base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, enabling rapid strike capabilities across the Middle East and Persian Gulf. The conversation addressed historical precedents, such as the failed 1980 U.S. raid on Tabas, which collapsed due to technical failures like sand filters on helicopters. Experts on the show, including Emmanuel and Philippe Bilgeat, debated the likelihood of a ground invasion—considered unlikely due to high risk of casualties—versus a limited, targeted strike aimed at deterring Iran’s nuclear ambitions and sending a message. The discussion framed Trump’s approach as consistent with Republican preferences for swift, surgical military actions over prolonged conflicts, though the segment acknowledged the tragic human cost of ongoing Iranian protests and the regime’s resilience.

**What to know about protests over Iran's economy as nuclear tensions remain high**
Protests across Iran have spread to over 170 locations in 25 of the country's 31 provinces, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, with at least 15 people killed and more than 580 arrested. The demonstrations, initially sparked by economic hardship including a 40% annual inflation rate and the collapse of the rial—now trading at 1.4 million to $1—have evolved into broader anti-government sentiment. The crisis intensified after Israel's 12-day war in June 2024, followed by U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, and the reimposition of UN sanctions in September 2023. Iran's 'Axis of Resistance,' including allies like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Syrian regime under Bashar Assad, and Yemen’s Houthi rebels, has been significantly weakened by regional military actions. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces has heightened tensions, with former U.S. President Donald Trump threatening military intervention if Iran violently suppresses protesters. Iran has responded by erecting banners in Tehran warning of lethal consequences for U.S. and Israeli troops. Despite Iran’s recent claim that it has halted uranium enrichment, U.S. intelligence maintains that Iran has not yet begun a nuclear weapons program but is conducting activities that would enable it to do so. The IAEA has warned Iran could produce up to 10 nuclear bombs if it chooses. Diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S., once close under the Shah, have been hostile since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent hostage crisis. The 2015 nuclear deal briefly eased tensions, but the U.S. withdrawal under Trump in 2018 reignited conflict, especially after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The U.S. has also warned that it can project military power globally, citing the Maduro operation as precedent.

**Geopolitical Tensions Escalate: U.S.-China Trade War, Venezuela Regime Change, and Afghanistan-Pakistan Conflict**
The article discusses geopolitical tensions involving Ukraine, the United States, China, and other global actors. It highlights that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader and U.S. Democratic Party ally, rather than Donald Trump, despite Trump's claims of resolving multiple conflicts. The article claims the award serves as a strategic tool for U.S. influence in Venezuela, with support from Republican figures like Marco Rubio, and suggests it signals U.S. readiness for regime change in Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro. Machado’s statements are cited as calling for international support to overthrow Maduro and accusing him of being protected by Cuba and Nicaragua. The article also alleges Machado offered to orchestrate sabotage on Chinese oil platforms in Lake Maracaibo in exchange for $5 million and immunity, potentially serving U.S. interests by provoking conflict with China and justifying intervention. Additional indicators of U.S. escalation include the suspension of U.S.-Venezuela talks, media narratives portraying Maduro as vulnerable, and the U.S. Pentagon’s alleged involvement in planning Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. The article notes that the U.S. may transfer long-range Tomahawk and JASSM missiles to Ukraine, with Germany potentially forwarding them. Meanwhile, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have intensified: the U.S. tightened export controls on semiconductors and high-tech equipment, adding 15 Chinese firms to its blacklist and sanctioning a Chinese oil terminal processing Iranian crude. In response, China expanded export controls on rare earth elements and lithium batteries, citing national security. China’s dominance in rare earth production (70% of global output) is highlighted, with historical precedent in 2010 when it restricted exports to Japan. The article also reports a military escalation between Afghanistan and Pakistan due to attacks by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is supported by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The TTP’s actions are attributed to long-standing regional instability rooted in Cold War-era U.S.-Pakistani intelligence cooperation. The article suggests that current Pakistani leadership lacks control over the TTP, which opposes the current government and seeks a Greater Pashtunistan, creating a strategic conflict. The article concludes with a description of U.S.-China trade talks ahead of the APEC summit, where both sides have raised stakes through tariffs, sanctions, and countermeasures, including U.S. threats of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls on critical software. The article also notes the U.S. soybean export crisis to China, with American farmers demanding the return of the Chinese market. Financial markets reacted negatively to Trump’s announcement, with tech stocks and Bitcoin declining. In response, China stopped publishing Microsoft Word documents, switching to the domestic WPS Office. The article frames these developments as a broader economic and strategic confrontation between the U.S. and China, with rare earths and technology as central leverage points.

**U.S. Military Buildup in the Caribbean, Dollar Decline, and Escalating Tensions with Iran and Venezuela**
The United States has significantly increased its military presence in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, deploying 8 warships (including the amphibious group USS Iwo Jima with over 4,500 Marines), 10 F-35 stealth fighters, a nuclear attack submarine, P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, and MQ-9 Reaper drones. Officially, the deployment is framed as part of the 'war against drug trafficking,' including lethal attacks on unidentified boats (at least 4 confirmed, resulting in 21 deaths), with former President Trump claiming it aims to stop fentanyl and cocaine flows from Venezuela—a claim dismissed as false by analysts. However, retired Admiral James Stavridis called the scale of the deployment 'excessive' for drug interdiction, suggesting it may be preparation for territorial takeovers, potentially signaling regime change pressure on Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has responded by mobilizing 4.5 million militia members, deploying troops along coasts, and sending a letter to Trump calling for dialogue. The U.S. denies invasion plans, claiming the mission is solely against cartels, which analysts argue do not exist. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar’s share of global reserves fell to 56.3% in Q2 2025—the lowest since 1995—down 1.5 percentage points from the prior quarter, driven by a 10%+ depreciation against major currencies and accelerated diversification by BRICS nations (including new members like Saudi Arabia and Egypt), who are expanding trade in local currencies (yuan, ruble, real), using systems like China’s CIPS and the new BRICS Clear for cross-border payments. This economic weakening has heightened U.S. strategic anxiety ahead of midterm elections, with historical precedent suggesting such crises often trigger military escalation as a political unifier. Regarding conflict, the U.S. has not publicly declared invasion plans for Venezuela, but Pentagon sources indicate 'options for attacks on Venezuelan territory' targeting drug-related sites—potentially including government strongholds like Miraflores and Fuerte Tiuna—raising risks of civilian casualties. Trump has notified Congress that the U.S. is in 'armed conflict' with cartels, granting legal cover, though analysts see this as an escalation toward regime change. The force level (4,500 troops) is insufficient for full-scale invasion. In Iran, tensions remain high due to proxies like Ansarallah in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump has deployed tankers, combat aircraft, and missiles to Israel, with reports of recent attacks on Iran, but no direct war has been declared. Trump falsely claims to have 'ended 7 wars' (including Israel-Iran), when in reality, only ceasefires were achieved. Simultaneous wars against Iran and Venezuela are considered logistically and politically improbable due to public opposition (polls show rejection of interventions) and the weakened dollar. Russia supports Venezuela with arms and intelligence (e.g., drones and joint exercises in 2024) and Iran with S-400 systems and nuclear cooperation, but is stalled in Ukraine and lacks capacity for two additional fronts. China and Iran also back Maduro economically but avoid military escalation. Putin has warned against 'provocations' in the Caribbean but has made no firm commitments. Overall, the situation is highly volatile: maximum pressure on Venezuela, a weakening dollar, and sustained pressure on Iran, with Russia as a 'wildcard.' A single misdirected missile could ignite conflict across the Western Hemisphere. Trump appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chess (or poker) to force concessions without ground skirmishes. Latin America is at the forefront of Western tensions, and Iran in the Middle East, but diplomacy remains the best hope. Maduro has already extended a peace overture to Trump.

**Iran and Israel on the Brink: Escalating Tensions Amid Sanctions and Military Posturing**
Iran and Israel face heightened tensions following the reactivation of sanctions mechanisms under the 2015 nuclear deal, with the U.S. re-imposing restrictions on arms trade, uranium enrichment, ballistic missile launches, and global asset freezes, while authorizing international inspections of Iranian aircraft and vessels. Israel, closely monitoring the situation, has raised its military readiness, citing Iran’s advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile capabilities as existential threats. Israeli assessments after the June 2024 12-day conflict indicate Iran’s resilience despite strikes, reinforcing the need for massive investment in missile defense systems like Arrow, Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and the newly deployed U.S. THAAD batteries. Iran, in response, has reaffirmed its readiness to defend against any aggression, citing ongoing upgrades to its military systems and the integration between the regular army and the Revolutionary Guard. Iran’s missile range—up to 2,000 km—covers Israel, and its leadership has signaled willingness to extend missile reach as needed. Iran has also received Russian MiG-29s and is acquiring Sukhoi-35s, while relying on 'ghost ships' to evade sanctions. Experts, including Israeli analyst Omar Mubaraki and U.S. advisor Gabriel Somma, warn of a potential new confrontation, with Israel pursuing a strategy of targeted preemptive strikes and strategic pressure, while the U.S. prioritizes diplomacy and sanctions over military action. The region stands at a critical juncture, with the balance of power shifting amid escalating military posturing and intelligence-driven deterrence. Historical precedents show sanctions and deterrence have limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions but failed to eliminate its military capabilities.

### 2020s in military history
. Whilst the invasion failed its main goal of a rapid victory, as Ukraine pushed back the northern arm of the invasion and prevented the capture of Kyiv, Russia maintained a military occupation of the southeast of Ukraine, and several months after the invasion, unilaterally declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials. The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict between Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey, and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh together with Armenia, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but partially governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. Clashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the First Nagorno-Karabakh war (1988–1994). In response to the clashes, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law and a curfew, later declaring partial mobilization on 28 September 2020. Turkey provided military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of this support has been disputed. Turkey's involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence, both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russia's influence over the region

. Following the capture of Shusha, the second-largest settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ending all hostilities in the area from 00:00, 10 November 2020 Moscow Time. The President of Artsakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, also agreed to end the hostilities. Under the agreement, the warring sides will keep control of their currently held areas within Nagorno-Karabakh, while Armenia will return the surrounding territories it occupied in 1994 to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain land access to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Approximately 2,000 Russian soldiers will be deployed as peacekeeping forces along the Lachin corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh for a mandate of at least five years. On 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, beginning the Gaza war. On 8 October 2023, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery shells at Israeli positions, beginning the 2023 Israel-Hezbollah conflict. On 1 April 2024, Israel conducted an airstrike on the Iranian consulate complex in Damascus, Syria, beginning the 2024 Iran-Israel conflict. In September 2024, the Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated into the 2024 Israel-Hezbollah War. On 13 June 2025, Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities, starting the Iran–Israel war, which resulted in a ceasefire after the US attacked Iranian nuclear sites. In January 2020, the United States assassinated the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, general Qasem Soleimani. This led to an Iranian missile strike against bases housing US troops in Iraq five days later. As a result of expectations of a US retribution, the Iranian air defence system accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people on board. The International Maritime Security Construct was setup by the US to prevent Iran from disrupting international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. Israel was suspected of being behind at least five explosions and fires at Iranian nuclear sites in the summer of 2020

2020s in military history

. The leading nuclear scientist of the country, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated on 27 November 2020, with Iran blaming Israel for the attack. The Yemeni Civil War is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently control the capital Sanaʽa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. Concurrently, the Hadi government is in conflict with UAE forces as a result of UAE military measures such as the United Arab Emirates takeover of Socotra and UAE-backed STC takeover of Aden. In February 2020, the political track of the Libyan peace process started in Geneva among 20 Libyans, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the Libyan House of Representatives, and from the independent persons' group selected by UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), including Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, former Education Minister Othman Abdul Jalil and former head of the HCS Abdulrahman Sewehli. The aimed composition was 13 HoR representatives from both the Tobruk and Tripoli branches, 13 HCS representatives and 14 UNSMIL-selected independent Libyans, for a total of 40. The Tigray conflict was an armed conflict that began in November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, between Tigray Region special forces led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) in alliance with Amhara Region special forces. The conflict stemmed from the attempt of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to distance the country's politics from ethnic federalism, a power-sharing system giving regional influence to individual ethnic groups, by merging the ethnic and region-based parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which had governed Ethiopia for 30 years, into a nationwide Prosperity Party

### Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration
. Project Cassandra was a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) initiative launched in 2008 to disrupt Hezbollah's funding networks by targeting its involvement in international drug trafficking and money laundering. While the operation uncovered significant links between Hezbollah and organized crime, its later years were marked by controversy over allegations that enforcement efforts were slowed to protect the JCPOA negotiations with Iran—a claim disputed by former officials. On January 12, 2016, two United States Navy riverine command boats were seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy after they entered Iranian territorial waters near Iran's Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. Initially, the U.S. military claimed the sailors inadvertently entered Iranian waters owing to mechanical failure, but it was later reported that they entered Iranian waters because of navigational errors. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif within five minutes, the first of a series of phone calls between the two. The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released, unharmed, 15 hours later. The release was hailed by the Obama administration as an unintended benefit of the new diplomatic relationship. Iran released pictures of captured U.S. sailors. Some U.S. Republican 2016 presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump criticized the U.S. response to the detention, which they deemed too weak. Although the JCPOA removed sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program, the United States continued to enforce sanctions concerning human rights violations, support for terrorism, and ballistic missile activities. Iran frequently criticized this dual-track approach as undermining the spirit of the agreement, even if not in legal violation, and cited it as evidence of bad faith. Additionally, European banks and corporations were hesitant to engage with Iran due to the risk of U.S. secondary sanctions, which discouraged financial and commercial transactions despite the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. During this period, the United States backed the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), an exiled opposition group that had once allied with Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and was delisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2012. The MEK received public support from several high-profile American politicians and was promoted by some as a viable alternative to Iran's current leadership

Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration

. On 8 and 9 March 2016 the IRGC conducted ballistic missile tests as part of its military drills, with one of the Qadr H missiles carrying the inscription, "Israel should be wiped off the Earth." Israel called on Western powers to punish Iran for the tests, which U.S. officials said did not violate the nuclear deal but might violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the tests were not in violation of the UNSC resolution. On 17 March the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian and British companies for involvement in the Iranian ballistic missile program. On 21 May 2016 Zarif, during a meeting with his New Zealander counterpart Murray McCully, while statements of support (like those from the U.S.) are politically helpful, they are not sufficient unless matched by action — especially to resolve obstacles created by years of sanctions and U.S. hostility. In parallel with ongoing sanctions and legal disputes, tensions also extended into the judiciary. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Iran must pay nearly $2 billion to victims of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. Although U.S. troops generally have no legal right to sue under combat rules, the judge determined they were on a peacekeeping mission under peacetime rules of engagement. As a result, survivors and family members were allowed to sue Iran under a 1996 law permitting U.S. citizens to take legal action against nations that sponsor terrorism. Meanwhile, Iran and the United States engaged in indirect military confrontation during the Arab Spring, primarily in Syria following an uprising against the pro-Iranian dictator Bashar al-Assad, with both sides supporting opposing factions. Iran backed al-Assad through proxy forces, viewing his regime as vital to its regional interests. The U.S., Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia supported the uprising, with the latter three funding revolutionary groups. As the conflict escalated into a broader civil war, it evolved into a proxy struggle between Russia and the United States, with Russia largely supporting Iranian efforts in Syria to contain rebels. Iran, Russia, and Syria, alongside Hezbollah and Iraq, formed a military coalition, which was viewed by the U.S. as an attempt by said countries to antagonize the West. Iran and the U.S. also engaged in proxy warfare in Yemen, where the U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen. The U.S

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. However, Russia's tie with Saudi Arabia has become increasingly warmed since 2010s despite numerous differences, thus sometimes affected Iran's stance on relations with Russia. In the past, Saudi Arabia backed Chechen and Dagestani fighters as well as Arab Mujahedeen in the North Caucasus during the First and Second Chechen Civil Wars in the 1990s, in which Russia has fought against them. In recent years however, Saudi Arabia has shifted its diplomacy to become friendlier to Russia, with King Salman became the first Saudi head of state to visit Russia, heralding possible political change. Since then, Saudi Arabia and Russia have started to support each other in various conflicts in Syria and Libya, with Saudi Arabia supported Russian intervention in Syria, while Russia and Saudi Arabia have together backed Khalifa Haftar's forces in Libya. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Russia are also becoming more antagonistic to Iranian ambitions in the Middle East, as revealed by their secret cooperation alongside Israel and Jordan against Iran. Likewise, since late 2010s, sign of Iranian–Russian friction emerged, following Iran's attempt to turn Bashar al-Assad to align with the Islamist ideology of the Iranian regime which opposed to Russia's desire for a secular state. Russia's attitude toward Iran is also becoming more negative due to Iranian desire to control the Middle East, resulting in growing cooperation with Saudi Arabia. But currently after the fall of Assad regime in Syria Russia have diverted its ties from Syrian Saudi-backed regime towards other regional partners Oman is a member of the GCC and thus, maintains a close relationship with Saudi Arabia. However, unlike the majority of GCC countries, Oman does not perceive Iran as a threat. Oman has long promoted itself as the main stabilizing force amidst the intensified Iranian–Saudi conflict and often prefers a diplomatic solution to end the proxy wars. However, it is alleged of Houthi support and Iranian arms smuggling. Pakistan is a major partner of Saudi Arabia, but is also a neighbor of Iran, sharing historical ties as well. Prior to 1979, the three countries formed a moderate relationship and acted as responsible Muslim states. However, since 1979, Pakistan has fallen into sectarian discord due to growing attempt by Iran and Saudi Arabia to spread influence to the country, with Pakistan having a balance of Sunni and Shi'a Muslims

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia has been historically strong, and often Pakistan has feared Iran is trying to recruit its large Shi'a population to serve for Iran's military adventures, given by increasing number of vanishing Shi'as in Pakistan. Its link with Iran is also marred with a number of problems regarding not just Shia issue, but also due to conflict in Afghanistan, with Iran-backed proxies have fought against Pakistan and its ally Taliban, further strengthens Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia. However, Pakistan has refrained from criticizing Iran, but rather seeks to preserve the relations, given its long historical relationship with Iran. Pakistan has backed Iran on its effort to maintain border security in the restive Balochistan region, and have cooperated against the Soviets in the 1980s. In 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, during a visit to Tehran, said that he was trying promote talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia to defuse the tension between the two countries. But now Pakistan now after current Iran-Israel war 2025 prefers to have good relations with Iran. It remained neutral during the 2017 Qatar-Gulf crisis. Syria has been a major theater in the proxy conflict throughout its ongoing civil war, which began in 2011. Iran and the GCC states have provided varying degrees of military and financial support to opposing sides, with Iran backing the Assad government and Saudi Arabia supporting rebel militants. Ba'athist Syria was an important part of Iran's sphere of influence, and the government under Bashar al-Assad had long been a major ally. During the early stages of the Arab Spring, Supreme Leader Khamenei initially expressed support for the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, characterizing them as an "Islamic awakening" akin to its own revolution in 1979. When protests broke out in Syria, Iran changed its position and condemned them, comparing the uprising to its own presidential election protests in 2009 and accusing the United States and Israel of being behind the unrest. The war threatened Iran's position, and Saudi Arabia and its allies sided with Sunni rebels in part to weaken Iran. For years Iranian forces were involved on the ground, with soldiers in Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps facing heavy casualties. In 2014, with no end in sight to the conflict, Iran increased its ground support for the Syrian Army, providing elite forces, intelligence gathering, and training. Iran also backed pro-Assad Hezbollah fighters

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Although Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed in 2015 to participate in peace talks in Vienna in participation with United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the talks ultimately failed. Saudi Arabia countered Russia's intervention in Syria by increasing its support for the rebels and supplying American-made anti-tank TOW missiles, a move which slowed initial progress made by Russian and Syrian forces. Iran suffered a significant setback in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime to renewed rebel offensives in 2024. Yemen's geographical position in the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, close to Egypt and East Africa, and bordering Saudi Arabia, makes it important for Iran. With the help of the Houthis, Iran was able to expand its network of proxies without making significant financial or military investments in the southern borders of Saudi Arabia. With Iranian assistance, the Houthis were able to consolidate their position in Yemen and the Middle East. Yemen has been called one of the major fronts in the conflict as a result of the revolution and subsequent civil war. Yemen had for years been within the Saudi sphere of influence. The decade-long Houthi insurgency in Yemen stoked tensions with Iran, with accusations of covert support for the rebels. A 2015 UN report alleged that Iran provided the Houthi rebels with money, training, and arms shipments beginning in 2009. However, the degree of support has been subject to debate, and accusations of greater involvement have been denied by Iran. The 2014–2015 coup d'état was viewed by Saudi leadership as an immediate threat, and as an opportunity for Iran to gain a foothold in the region. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states, including all GCC members except Oman, intervened and launched airstrikes and a ground offensive in the country, declaring the entire Saada Governorate a military target and imposing a naval blockade. The United States intervened in October 2016 after missiles were fired at a US warship, which was in place to protect oil shipments along the sea lane passing through the Mandeb Strait. The US blamed the rebels and responded by targeting radar sites with missile strikes along the Red Sea coast. In response, rebels called the strikes evidence of American support for the Saudi campaign. While the majority of Muslims in Iraq are Shia, the country has been ruled for decades by Sunni-dominated governments under the Ottoman Empire, the British-installed Hashemites, and the Ba'athists

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. In January 2020, following the death of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian government lashed out at Albania for hosting MEK members, and Iran has increased cyberattacks and agent hunting on Iranian dissidents against Albania. Saudi Arabia, in response, announced its support for Albania in its efforts against Iran. The rebel group Jaish ul-Adl, active in the Sistan and Baluchestan region of Iran, is accused by Iranian authorities of receiving Saudi and American support. The speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, stated that Saudi Arabia gave "strategic" intelligence information to Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. In May 2018, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman supported greater discussion between Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, stating "It's time for the Middle East to [...] have an axis of moderate countries," opposed to the network of Iranian allies and proxies. As of 2018, several sources described alleged intelligence ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel as a "covert alliance", with a joint interest to counter Iran in the region. The New York Times remarked that such cooperation was made more difficult by controversy over Israel's attitude towards Palestinians. Israel and Saudi Arabia are both part of the Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD). The United States and Saudi Arabia have a strategic relationship that dates back to 1947. When the Iranian Revolution occurred, revolutionaries began to support other uprisings and rebellions throughout the Muslim world, including in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Iran used this policy to undermine their sovereignty while fighting in proxy warfare. This caused Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf allies to turn to the U.S. for support. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, and the GCC jointly backed Iraq under Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and the U.S. and Iran directly attacked each other during the Tanker War. The U.S. and Iran again opened in mistrust during the Iraq War, with the U.S. and the GCC accusing Iran of funding and militarizing its proxies and Shia groups within Iraq. The highest point of mutual distrust happened in 2005 after details of Iran's nuclear program were leaked, and sanctions by the UN were put in place. The sanctions were put in place until 2015, when the JCPOA was implemented. Iran and U.S

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. have also been embroiled in tensions due to the wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and disputes surrounding the Strait of Hormuz. In the 2011–2012 Strait of Hormuz dispute, Iran threatened to close Hormuz, however, was forced to back down after the EU placed sanctions. The U.S. and Iran were brought to the brink of war during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, when the U.S. assassinated Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, leaders of the Quds Force and the Popular Mobilization Forces, respectively. This was after the December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and the Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad, and Iran retaliated by bombing Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. U.S.-Saudi relations have deteriorated due to the Yemeni civil war and Syrian civil war. Saudi Arabia formerly supported the Al-Nusra Front, an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Saudi Arabia has also been involved in war crimes in Yemen due to civilian airstrikes and a humanitarian blockade. The U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led invasion until 2022, when Joe Biden repealed support for it and halted arm sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, on 14 September 2019, as an "act of war". President Donald Trump called for an increase in sanctions against Iran opposing the strikes. President Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran. Jordan has historically been on the Saudi bloc despite its slight rivalry. Jordan and Iran have sour relations with each other. Turkey has long seen Iran's expansions as threats but also perceived Saudi Arabia's influence with a similar reception, and is seeking to build itself as an alternative replacement to both Saudi and Iranian influences, to a degree. Historically, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey were part of the Western bloc. Turkey sided with Saudi Arabia throughout the conflicts in Syria and Yemen to contain against Iranian influence, however, both sides backed different groups. However, Turkey's growing military, political, and economic influence have caused some concern on Saudi circles with the start of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, when Turkey sided with Qatar

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Iran also considers Turkish military adventurism in Syria and its growing encounter against Iran in the Levant and Iraq as a challenge, not to mention its good relationship with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has antagonistic relations with Iran, and friendly relations with the Persian Gulf Arab states and Israel. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has also begun a systematic campaign to rewrite history, changing the Ottoman Empire into the occupier of Arabia; while it has also partially financed other megaprojects to counter the growing Turkish presence in Qatar, Sudan, Maghreb, Somalia, Kuwait, and Oman. Turkey was able to improve its relations with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the end of the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Erdoğan met with Mohammed bin Salman on June 2022 to boost their economic and political relations. Emirati-Turkish reconciliation in 2021, followed by Turkey's decision to move Khashoggi's case to the Saudi authorities and the mutual disdain of Biden administration to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey, paved a way for Saudi-Turkish reconciliation. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia supported Syrian opposition against Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey were among the first countries to welcome the new administration in Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. Turkey played a key role to ensure the new Syrian government would not pose any threats to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Turkey continued to strengthen their ties through cooperation and the mutual interest in both countries to contain Iran. Even though, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey maintains different strategic goals, both countries agree that limited cooperation is necessary for economic growth and regional stability. Qatar–Saudi Arabia relations have been strained since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Qatar has been a focus of controversy in the Saudi-Iranian rivalry due to Saudi Arabia's longstanding concern about the country's relationship with Iran and Iranian-backed militant groups. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Sudan, Senegal, Djibouti, Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government, and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and blocked their airspace and sea routes, in addition to Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing. The reasons cited were Qatar's relations with Iran, Al-Jazeera's coverage of other GCC states and Egypt, and Qatar's alleged support of Islamist groups. Qatar was also expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi prompted international backlash against Saudi Arabia and Mohammad bin Salman. The Trump administration issued a statement reiterating its support for Saudi Arabia and blaming Iran for the war in Yemen. The United States Senate responded to the president by passing bipartisan resolutions condemning the assassination and voting to end United States aid to Saudi Arabia for the war in Yemen, though the measures were considered largely symbolic. Military tensions between Iran and the United States escalated in 2019 amid a series of confrontations involving the US, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman took place in May and June. In the wake of growing tensions, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated that Iran sought good relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and their allies, and called on them to end their dispute with Qatar. In September 2019 a drone attack was launched on the Saudi Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq and Khurais oil field in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The attack knocked out half of the country's oil supply. Although the Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Iran was behind the attack, a charge which Iran denied. Saudi Arabia and the US were reportedly investigating whether the attacks involved cruise missiles launched from Iran or Iraq. US officials had previously concluded that the attack on the East-West pipeline was launched by Iranian-backed militias in southern Iraq, despite Houthi rebels also claiming responsibility. On 16 September, the US told Saudi Arabia that it had concluded that Iran was a staging ground for the September attack. The US raised the prospect of a joint retaliatory strike on Iran, an action which would potentially broaden into a regional conflict. Saudi Arabia said its investigation was ongoing, but officials alleged that Iranian weapons were used in the strikes and that the attacks were not launched from Yemen. The claims were made without supporting evidence. Iran's Hassan Rouhani, after the attack on Aramco, claimed that Saudi Arabia should take it as a warning to stop its intervention in Yemen. The Saudi-led intervention has led to the deaths of more than thousands to date. On 3 January 2020, the US launched an airstrike on a convoy near Baghdad International Airport that killed multiple passengers, including Iranian Major general and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. The military action came shortly after pro-Iran protesters and Iraqi militiamen attacked the US embassy in Baghdad on 31 December 2019 in response to US airstrikes targeting Iran-backed militia. The airstrike was seen as a major escalation of tensions, and the government of Iran vowed revenge in response. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the attack "an extremely dangerous and foolish escalation" and released a statement saying that "the brutality and stupidity of American terrorist forces in assassinating Commander Soleimani... will undoubtedly make the tree of resistance in the region and the world more prosperous." On 7 January, Iran attacked Al Asad Airbase and Erbil International Airport in Iraq as an act of revenge. The attack left 110 injured. Hours after the missile attacks, during a state of high alert, IRGC forces mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people on board. On 12 January, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah called for Iran's allies in the Axis of Resistance—including Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah, the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Houthi movement in Yemen—to intensify its military campaigns against the U.S. to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East. During a state visit by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei called for regional cooperation against the U.S. However, following discussions between Sheikh Tamim and President Rouhani, Tamim concluded that de-escalation and dialogue were the only means to resolve the regional crises. In response to the increased tensions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and many U.S. states released advisories warning of Iranian cyberattacks, while the Texas Department of Information Resources said Iranian cyberattacks had reached a rate of 10,000 per minute. The 2019 Warsaw Conference would later lead to the Abraham Accords, with Saudi allies UAE and Bahrain normalizing relations with Israel. This was followed by Morocco and Sudan. This would later lead to the Arab–Israeli alliance, and the Negev Summit. The U.S. , along with Israel allegedly announced the formation of the Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD) in June 2022 with the purpose of countering Iran. Israel stated delegations from the U.A.E, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. participated in broker talks

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. In 2022, Iran and Saudi Arabia participated in peace talks brokered by Iraq. In July of that year, the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, alongside Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and the United States participated in the Jeddah Security and Development Summit (JSDS). In the summit, members called on Iran to stop intervening in other countries' affairs, and U.S. President Joe Biden ensured that they will not let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and Israel of meddling within their internal affairs due to the Mahsa Amini protests. In late October 2022, Saudi intelligence was shared to the U.S., warning of an imminent attack by Iran, which placed the GCC, Iraq, and Israel on high alert. The intelligence showed that Iran was allegedly planning to strike Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. Iran denied these accusations and intel as baseless. Since April 2021, Iraq has hosted five rounds of direct talks between the two nations, which cut diplomatic ties in 2016. The 6th round of talks on a ministerial level stalled, but after a meeting in Amman, Jordan, in December 2022, Iran's Hossein Amirabdollahian and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud signaled that both countries would be "open to more dialogue". Despite increased rhetoric by Iran against Saudi Arabia, the Saudis support efforts to revive the stalled Iran nuclear deal. However, the Saudi minister threatened to nullify the negotiations and following agreement if Iran were to obtain nuclear weapons. In January 2023, the Saudi foreign ministers Al Saud speaking at a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos reiterated that "Riyadh is trying to find a dialog with Iran". He welcomed the decision by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to focus on their economies "towards joint prosperity". The two countries announced the resumption of relations on 10 March 2023, following a deal brokered by China. The agreement was signed by secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran Ali Shamkhahni and Saudi Arabian national security advisor Musaed Al-Aiban. A joint statement announced that their embassies would re-open within two months. The United Nations Secretary General, Hezbollah, Oman, UAE, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia welcomed the reapproachment, while two former Israeli Prime Ministers criticized it

### Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration
Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration (2021–2025) were shaped by efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement alongside ongoing regional tensions, sanctions, cyberattacks, and proxy conflicts. Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. officials expressed interest in returning to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but negotiations in Vienna eventually stalled. Iran increased uranium enrichment and imposed retaliatory sanctions, while the U.S. imposed new sanctions over missile programs, oil exports, and human rights abuses. Tensions persisted throughout this era, marked by recurring proxy attacks on U.S. bases, which intensified following the outbreak of the Gaza war in late 2023, and by subsequent American retaliatory strikes. The period also saw disputes over the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and military escalations across the Gulf region. In 2023, a breakthrough occurred with a U.S.–Iran prisoner swap and the release of frozen Iranian funds, though indirect diplomacy remained fragile. Iran was later accused of interfering in the 2024 U.S. presidential election through cyber operations and AI disinformation. Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust.

Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust. At the outset of the Biden administration in January 2021, Iran was led by President Hassan Rouhani, a centrist cleric who had previously championed the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) and advocated for improved relations with the West, while ultimate authority rested with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who held decisive power over Iran’s foreign and security policies. Relations between the U.S. and Iran were deeply strained, with no formal diplomatic ties since 1980. The United States had withdrawn from the JCPOA, reimposed sweeping sanctions, and escalated military tensions, while Iran had resumed higher-level uranium enrichment and reduced compliance with the nuclear deal in violation of the agreement. The Biden administration initially expressed interest in re-engaging with Iran on the Iran nuclear deal, which the previous administration had withdrawn from in 2018, sparking international backlash. Early in his presidency, Biden formally extended an offer to restart diplomatic talks on a new nuclear deal, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that the U.S. would consider re-entering the agreement if Iran returned to "strict compliance" with its terms

Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration

. At the time, Blinken also did not rule out the possibility of military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. As Iran continued to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2021, the government repeatedly urged the Biden administration to lift sanctions. Strict financial measures imposed by the previous Trump administration had negatively impacted Iranian economies. Tensions remained high in the region. Following a militia-organized rocket attack in Erbil, Iraq, which wounded four American contractors and one soldier, in February 2021 the United States Military conducted airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria, including Kata'ib Hezbollah. The attacks sparked renewed debate over presidential war powers, with key Democratic lawmakers expressing concern about conducting military operations without prior congressional approval. Over 220 US Congress leaders endorsed House Resolution 118 in April 2021, expressing support for "the Iranian people's desire for a democratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic of Iran" and condemning "violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism". Around the same time, signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) met in Vienna in an effort to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement. U.S. and Iranian officials participated in so-called proximity talks in order to exchange views on how to return to the considered deal. Both sides downplayed expectations for rapid progress, insisting that the other should resume their commitments first. Talks continued even after an explosion at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, blamed on Israel, to which Iran responded by increasing uranium enrichment to 60% purity, its highest level to date. Diplomatic tensions remained unresolved in late 2021, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stating that military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons could not be ruled out. Around the same time, Iran imposed sanctions on former U.S. President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and eight others for their alleged roles in the 2020 killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani. Iran also requested their arrest through Interpol. President Ebrahim Raisi stated that Trump, Pompeo, and others must be tried in a "fair court". In 2021, Iran's crude oil exports had been re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA

### Iran–Israel proxy conflict
. In the first attack, particle physicist Masoud Alimohammadi was killed on 12 January 2010 when a booby-trapped motorcycle parked near his car exploded. On 12 October 2010, an explosion occurred at an IRGC military base near the city of Khorramabad, killing 18 soldiers. On 29 November 2010, two senior Iranian nuclear scientists, Majid Shahriari and Fereydoon Abbasi, were targeted by hitmen on motorcycles, who attached bombs to their cars and detonated them from a distance. Shahriari was killed, while Abbasi was severely wounded. On 23 July 2011, Darioush Rezaeinejad was shot dead in eastern Tehran. On 11 January 2012, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan and his driver were killed by a bomb attached to their car from a motorcycle. Iran blamed Israel and the U.S. for the assassinations. Iranian officials also blamed British intelligence agencies. Mahmoud Alavi, Iran's intelligence minister, said the person who planned the killing was "a member of the armed forces" indirectly suggesting that the perpetrator might have been from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In 2014 NBC reported that two US officials said the MEK had received finance and training from Irael in killing nuclear scientists, while a senior State Department official later said they never claimed the MEK was involved in the assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. In early 2011, Majid Jamali Fashi confessed to the killing of Masoud Alimohammadi on Iranian state television, saying that he had trained for the operation at a Mossad facility near Tel Aviv. Fashi was executed in May 2012. That month, Iranian authorities announced the arrest of another 14 Iranians – eight men and six women – described as an Israeli-trained terror cell responsible for five of the attacks on Iranian scientists. Iran's IRTV Channel 1 broadcast a half-hour documentary, Terror Club, which included "the televised confessions of the 12 suspects allegedly involved in the killings of Ali-Mohammadi, Shahriari, Rezaeinejad, and Roshan, and the attempted killing of Abbasi." In 2024, the proxy war escalated to a series of direct confrontations between the two countries

Iran–Israel proxy conflict

. On 1 April, Israel bombed an Iranian consulate complex in Damascus, Syria, killing multiple senior Iranian officials. In response, Iran and its Axis of Resistance allies seized the Israeli-linked ship MSC Aries and launched strikes inside Israel on 13 April. Israel then carried out retaliatory strikes in Iran and Syria on 19 April. The Israeli strikes were limited, and analysts say they signaled a desire to de-escalate. Iran did not respond to the attack, and tensions de-escalated back down to the proxy war. On 13 June 2025, the conflict escalated further into the armed conflict between Iran and the Houthis against Israel and the United States, when Israel launched a surprise attack targeting key Iranian military and nuclear facilities. The opening hours of the war saw targeted assassinations and attempted assassinations of Iran's top military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians (including Ali Shamkhani, who was overseeing nuclear talks with the U.S.), airstrikes on nuclear and military facilities, and destruction of Iran's air defenses. Iran retaliated by launching missiles at military sites and cities in Israel. The United States, which had been defending Israel since the beginning of the war by shooting down Iranian missiles and drones, took offensive action on 22 June 2025, by striking three Iranian nuclear sites. In response, the Houthis in Yemen considered the American strikes a "declaration of war" and have fired several missiles at Israel. The New York Times, France24 and other news outlets expressed how Iranian proxy militias stayed largely silent and left Iran "isolated in war" during the 2025 war with Israel. Following Israeli military operations during the Iran–Israel war that resulted in the deaths of key Iranian military figures, including senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran has continued to support allied groups across the Middle East. According to the United States Central Command, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has supplied weapons, including drones and missiles, to groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite militias in Iraq. In Yemen, US authorities reported intercepting a vessel carrying 750 tons of Iranian weapons, including drone engines and radar systems, allegedly destined for the Houthis. In Iraq, the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) accused suspected Iranian-backed militias of carrying out drone attacks on oil infrastructure, including facilities operated by US companies

Iran–Israel proxy conflict

. In Syria, the Syrian Interior Ministry and Syrian police reported intercepting multiple weapons shipments allegedly bound for Hezbollah, including anti-tank missiles hidden in commercial trucks. These developments have occurred as nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States remain stalled. Russian foreign policy in the Middle East during the early 2000s, in light of the Iran–Israel proxy war. After 2001 the government of Vladimir Putin intensified Russia's involvement in the region, supporting Iran's nuclear programs and forgiving Syria 73% of its $13 billion debt. According to March 2007 brief entitled Russia's New Middle Eastern Policy: Back to Bismarck? by Ariel Cohen (Institute for Contemporary Affairs), Syria ... was supplying Hizbullah with Russian weapons. In 2006, Israeli forces found evidence of the Russian-made Kornet-E and Metis-M anti-tank systems in Hizbullah's possession in southern Lebanon. The Russian response to accusations that it was supplying terrorist groups with weapons was an announcement, in February 2007, that Russia's military will conduct inspections of Syrian weapons storage facilities with the goal of preventing the weapons from reaching unintended customers. Predictably, such developments placed considerable strain on the already-deteriorating relations between Russia and Israel... For several years Russia has been attempting to engage in military cooperation with both Israel and Syria. However, the levels of cooperation with the two states are inversely related and an escalation of arms sales to Syria can only damage the relationship with Israel. Russian-Syrian military cooperation has gone through numerous stages: high levels of cooperation during the Soviet era, which was virtually halted until 2005, and now Russia's attempt to balance its relationship with both Israel and Syria. However, Russia's recent eastward leanings might indicate that Moscow is prepared to enter a new stage in its military cooperation with Syria, even if this is to the detriment of its relationship with Israel. Israel–Russia relations improved after the Russian military intervention in Syria in September 2015. From then until July 2018, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Putin met a total of nine times. Prior to and immediately after the 2016 United States presidential election, Israel began lobbying the United States to strike a deal with Russia over restricting the Iranian military presence in Syria in exchange for removing U.S. sanctions against Russia. In 2019, Russia rejected an Iranian request to buy S-400 missile defense system

. This "malaise speech" further damaged his reelection bid because it seemed to express a pessimistic outlook and blamed the American people for his own failed policies.

Carter's term is best known for the 444-day Iranian hostage crisis, and the move away from détente with the Soviet Union to a renewed Cold War. In foreign affairs, Carter's accomplishments consisted of the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the creation of full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and the negotiation of the SALT II Treaty. In addition, he championed human rights throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.

Although foreign policy remained quiet during Carter's first two years, the Soviet Union appeared to be getting stronger. It was expanding its influence into the Third World along with the help of allies such as Cuba, and the pace of Soviet military spending steadily rose. In 1979, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan to prop up a Marxist regime there. In protest, Carter declared that the US would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. After nine years of fighting, the Soviets were unable to suppress Afghan rebels and pulled out of the country. Soviet espionage of the US government, military, and major corporations during this period was relentless and little was done to stop it. In June 1978, Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn gave the commencement address to the graduating class of Harvard and blasted the US for its perceived failure to stand up to communist tyranny. Solzhenitsyn's speech sent shock waves through an America which was suffering from post-Vietnam syndrome and preferred to forget that the eight years of war in Southeast Asia had happened. Moscow continued to test the limits of how much they could get away with. During the mid-1970s, the Kremlin announced that it would allow a number of Russian Jews to move to the United States, however it came out too late that most of them were criminals and the entire exercise amounted to little more than a scheme by the USSR to empty their prisons of "anti-social elements"

History of the United States (1964–1980)

. The result was a wave of organized crime in the Northeastern US, and pointless bureaucratic feuds in Washington meant that no action was taken to combat them until the 1990s. Cuba engaged in similar trickery during the 1970s by allowing political dissidents to move to the US, all of whom proved to be criminals, homosexuals, mental patients, and others who the Cubans deemed undesirables.[citation needed] Meanwhile, American forces in Europe, neglected during the Vietnam War, were expected to face the increasingly powerful Warsaw Pact with 1950s-era weaponry. The US military faced a sort of psychological crisis in the aftermath of Vietnam and the ending of the draft, with low morale, racial tensions, and drug use. Entirely new methods of recruiting were attempted. The Carter Administration saw the sudden, violent end of the 2500-year-old Iranian monarchy. After the CIA-engineered coup in 1953 restored Shah Reza Pahlavi to power, he was feted as a US ally for the next quarter century and often referred to as a "champion" of the free world despite running a police state, and one that had great extremes of wealth and poverty, a small, Westernized middle class in Tehran contrasting with entire provinces that lacked running water or electricity, and where traditional lifestyles continued much as they had for centuries.

Problems playing this file? See media help. Up to 1970, the US had limited weapons sales to its Middle Eastern allies (which consisted mainly of Iran and Israel) in the hopes of preventing a regional arms race. The Nixon Administration lifted those restrictions that year, and the Shah obliged by purchasing expensive new military items, including F-14 fighter jets over the protests of Defense Department officials that Iran had no military need for the aircraft and selling them risked the possibility of compromising sensitive information. Pahlavi argued that he needed the military hardware to defend against the Soviet-backed Baathist regime in neighboring Iraq, until 1975 when he signed a nonaggression pact with Baghdad, after which both countries joined in on military attacks against the Kurds, who had also been a US ally

History of the United States (1964–1980)

. Despite owing his livelihood to Washington, the Shah nonetheless did not hesitate to join in with fellow Middle Eastern states in conspiring to raise oil prices in 1973. The 2500th anniversary of Iranian monarchy was celebrated in 1975 with an enormous, expensive series of events in an extremely poor country, and the growing populist backlash against the Shah would erupt a few years later. Up until 1979, the State Department took it as writ that if the Shah were ever ousted, it would come from the small, Soviet-backed Tudeh Party. Anyone who knew enough about Iranian society could have predicted the arrival of the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeni, but such individuals were few and far between in the US government and intelligence agencies. The high point of Carter's foreign-policy came in 1978, when he mediated the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, ending the state of war that had existed between those two countries since 1948. In 1979, Carter completed the process begun by Nixon of restoring ties with China. Full diplomatic relations were established on January 1 of that year despite protests from Senator Barry Goldwater and some other conservative Republicans. Unofficial relations with Taiwan were maintained. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping then visited the US in February 1979. Carter also tried to place another cap on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979, and faced the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. In 1979, Carter allowed the former Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi into the United States for medical treatment. In response Iranian militants seized the American embassy in the Iranian hostage crisis, taking 52 Americans hostage and demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. The hostage crisis continued for 444 days and dominated the last year of Carter's presidency, ruining the President's tattered reputation for competence in foreign affairs. Carter's responses to the crisis, from a "Rose Garden strategy" of staying inside the White House to the failed military attempt to rescue the hostages, did not inspire confidence in the administration by the American people.
