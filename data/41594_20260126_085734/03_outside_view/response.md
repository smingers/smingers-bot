# Base Rate Estimation: US Attack on Iran Before April 2026

## Step 1: Source Analysis

**Available Data Sources:**
- Historical records of US military operations (post-WWII era most relevant)
- Congressional records and war authorizations
- Academic databases on interstate conflicts (Correlates of War Project, UCDP)
- Declassified military and intelligence documents
- News archives and historical accounts

**Reliability Assessment:**
- Post-1945 data is highly reliable and well-documented
- Clear definitions exist for military attacks vs. covert operations
- Systematic bias: Covert operations may be underreported in historical record
- Time horizon: ~16 months from present (January 2025 to April 2026)

**Data Quality:** 7/10 - Excellent for overt military operations, less complete for covert actions

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

### Reference Class 1: US Military Attacks on Sovereign Nations (Post-Cold War Era, 1991-2024)

**Description:** Direct US military attacks (airstrikes, invasions, sustained operations) against sovereign nations, excluding ongoing operations in existing war zones.

**Historical Cases:**
- Iraq (1991 - Gulf War)
- Iraq (1998 - Operation Desert Fox)
- Afghanistan (2001 - invasion)
- Iraq (2003 - invasion)
- Libya (2011 - intervention)
- Syria (2017, 2018 - limited strikes)
- Syria (2020 - limited strikes on Iranian-backed forces)

**Analysis:**
- Time period: 33 years (1991-2024)
- Major attacks on new countries: ~5-7 depending on definition
- Rate: Approximately 0.15-0.21 attacks per year
- For 16-month period: ~0.20-0.28 probability (20-28%)

**Sample size:** 7 events over 33 years
**Suitability score:** 7/10
**Reasoning:** Highly relevant as it captures US willingness to use military force. However, Iran is a specific case with unique deterrence factors (size, capabilities, regional position).

### Reference Class 2: US Military Actions Specifically Targeting Iran or Iranian Assets (1979-2024)

**Description:** Direct US military operations against Iran or Iranian military forces.

**Historical Cases:**
- Operation Eagle Claw (1980 - failed hostage rescue, not an attack on Iran per se)
- Operation Praying Mantis (1988 - naval engagement destroying Iranian platforms)
- Various incidents in Persian Gulf (1987-1988)
- Drone strikes on Iranian General Soleimani (2020 - in Iraq)
- Cyber operations (Stuxnet, ~2010)
- Multiple strikes on Iranian-backed proxies (not Iran directly)

**Analysis:**
- Time period: 45 years (1979-2024)
- Direct attacks on Iranian territory: 0
- Direct attacks on Iranian military assets: 2-3 major incidents
- Rate of attacks on Iranian territory specifically: 0 per 45 years
- Rate including assets/forces: ~0.04-0.07 per year
- For 16-month period: ~0.05-0.09 probability (5-9%)

**Sample size:** 2-3 events over 45 years (for direct military action)
**Suitability score:** 9/10
**Reasoning:** Most directly relevant reference class. The US has shown restraint in directly attacking Iran despite numerous provocations and proxy conflicts over 45 years.

### Reference Class 3: US Attacks on Regional Powers with Significant Military Capabilities (Post-WWII)

**Description:** US military attacks on countries with substantial military forces and regional power status (not minor states).

**Historical Cases:**
- North Korea (1950-1953 - Korean War)
- North Vietnam (1965-1973)
- Iraq (1991, 2003) - regional power status
- Serbia/Yugoslavia (1999)
- Libya (2011) - degraded but still regional actor

**Analysis:**
- Time period: 75 years (1949-2024)
- Attacks on regional powers: ~5-6 cases
- Rate: ~0.07-0.08 per year
- For 16-month period: ~0.09-0.11 probability (9-11%)
- Note: Trend shows decreasing frequency in recent decades

**Sample size:** 5-6 events over 75 years
**Suitability score:** 6/10
**Reasoning:** Captures the constraint that attacking capable adversaries is rare. However, definitions of "regional power" are somewhat subjective, and modern deterrence dynamics differ from Cold War era.

### Reference Class 4: Threatened US Military Actions That Did NOT Occur

**Description:** Cases where US seriously considered or threatened military action against Iran or similar adversaries but did not follow through.

**Historical Cases (Iran-specific):**
- Multiple crises during Iran-Iraq War (1980s)
- Iranian nuclear program escalations (2006-2015)
- Various Gulf incidents and tanker attacks (2019)
- Post-Soleimani escalation (2020)
- Numerous other tensions

**Analysis:**
- Instances of high tension with Iran: 10+ major crises
- Instances resulting in direct attack on Iran: 0
- This suggests strong structural factors preventing escalation

**Sample size:** 10+ near-miss scenarios
**Suitability score:** 8/10
**Reasoning:** Demonstrates revealed preference for restraint despite repeated opportunities and provocations.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation

Breaking down the probability:

**P(US attacks Iran) = P(Crisis occurs) × P(Crisis escalates to military action | Crisis) × P(Attack occurs in 16-month window | Escalation)**

- P(Crisis occurs in 16 months): ~0.60 (60%) - based on frequency of US-Iran tensions
- P(Crisis escalates to military consideration): ~0.30 (30%) - most crises de-escalate
- P(Military action authorized | serious consideration): ~0.15 (15%) - based on historical restraint
- P(Action occurs within timeframe | authorized): ~0.80 (80%)

**Combined probability:** 0.60 × 0.30 × 0.15 × 0.80 = 0.0216 or ~2.2%

## Step 4: Base Rate Integration

**Weighting by Suitability:**

1. **Reference Class 1** (US attacks post-Cold War): 20-28% base rate × 0.20 weight = 4.8%
2. **Reference Class 2** (US actions vs Iran): 5-9% base rate × 0.40 weight = 2.8%
3. **Reference Class 3** (US vs regional powers): 9-11% base rate × 0.15 weight = 1.5%
4. **Reference Class 4** (non-attacks): Suggests <5% × 0.25 weight = 1.0%

**Weighted average:** ~4.8 + 2.8 + 1.5 + 1.0 = **10.1%**

**Adjustments:**
- The Iran-specific reference class (most suitable) strongly suggests restraint
- Fermi estimation (~2%) suggests even lower probability
- However, 16-month window is relatively short, reducing base rate
- Balancing broader US intervention patterns against Iran-specific restraint

**Integrated Base Rate:** Averaging the weighted reference classes (10%) with Fermi estimation (2%), and giving more weight to Iran-specific history: **~6-8%**

## Step 5: Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Level: 7/10**

**Justification:**
- Strong historical data on US military operations (high quality)
- Excellent Iran-specific track record showing 45 years of restraint
- Clear patterns in the data
- Reasonable sample sizes for most reference classes
- Some uncertainty about covert operations and definition of "attack"

**Factors Supporting Confidence:**
- Consistent pattern of US restraint toward Iran specifically
- Well-documented historical record
- Multiple converging reference classes

**Factors Reducing Confidence:**
- Relatively rare events (small sample sizes)
- Changing geopolitical context over time
- Difficulty predicting rare, high-impact events
- Definition ambiguity (what constitutes an "attack"?)

---

## Output

**Base Rate Estimate: 7%**

**Reference Classes Used:**
1. US military attacks on sovereign nations (post-Cold War): 20-28% base rate (weight: 0.20)
2. US military actions specifically targeting Iran/Iranian assets: 5-9% base rate (weight: 0.40)
3. US attacks on regional powers with military capabilities: 9-11% base rate (weight: 0.15)
4. Threatened actions against Iran that did not occur: <5% base rate (weight: 0.25)

**Confidence Level: 7/10**

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. **Definition ambiguity:** What constitutes an "attack" (cyber operations? Strikes on proxies? Covert action?)
2. **Structural change:** Whether current geopolitical dynamics differ fundamentally from historical patterns
3. **Sample size limitations:** Direct US-Iran military confrontations are rare events, making statistical inference challenging
4. **Unreported operations:** Possible covert actions not in public record could affect true base rate
