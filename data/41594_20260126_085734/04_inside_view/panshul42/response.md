Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Source 1: Euronews (January 26, 2026)**
- **Summary**: Reports Tehran installed billboard warning US against military action; USS Abraham Lincoln moved toward Iran; mentions protests beginning December 28, 2025 with 5,848 deaths (per HRW); US deployed F-15E fighters; UK stationed Typhoons in Qatar; Iran warns it will "open fire in response"; references June 2025 Israel-Iran conflict.
- **Quality Assessment**: Mixed quality. Euronews is generally reliable, but this article contains concerning elements: (1) The date references are problematic - it's currently January 26, 2026, yet the article discusses events as if they just happened, including protests that "began December 28" and a "June 2025" Israel-Iran conflict that would be recent history. (2) Death toll of 5,848 seems extraordinarily high for one month. (3) Some details (billboard imagery, specific quotes) suggest propaganda elements. **The factual claims about military deployments (USS Abraham Lincoln, F-15Es, UK Typhoons) are verifiable facts if true, but require corroboration.**
- **Opinion vs Fact**: Factual: military deployments, billboard installation. Opinion/unverified: casualty figures, specific threat statements.

**Source 2: TimesNow (January 25, 2026)**
- **Summary**: Brief report of escalating US-Iran tensions with warship deployments and military threats.
- **Quality Assessment**: Very low information density. No specific details provided. TimesNow is a legitimate Indian news outlet, but this appears to be a breaking news snippet without substance.
- **Opinion vs Fact**: Too vague to distinguish.

**Source 3: Incomplete article on protests**
- Insufficient information to analyze.

**AskNews Deep Research Summary**
- **Assessment**: Concludes attack is "highly unlikely" based on: emphasis on sanctions over force, internal US constraints, no military indicators, global backlash risk.
- **Quality**: This appears to be AI-generated synthesis rather than original reporting. The analysis mentions sources [1]-[10] but these aren't clearly identifiable primary sources. **The conclusion directly contradicts the news articles about military deployments.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- None. The military deployment claims would constitute strong evidence if independently verified, but we have only single-source reporting with quality concerns.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Military deployments reported (USS Abraham Lincoln, F-15E fighters, UK Typhoons)**: If accurate, these represent concrete military positioning. However, single source with credibility concerns. Even if true, carrier deployments to the Middle East are not uncommon and don't necessarily presage attack. The timeframe (before April 2026) is only ~2 months away, which would be extremely compressed for a major military operation. **Weight: Increases probability moderately, but with high uncertainty.**
- **Explicit presidential threats**: Article mentions US President threatened military action over protest suppression. This represents rhetorical escalation. **Weight: Moderate increase, but threats often don't materialize (per reference class).**

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Iranian billboard and rhetoric**: Propaganda response, not predictive of US action.
- **June 2025 Israel-Iran conflict reference**: If this occurred, it's context but doesn't predict US action.
- **Protest situation**: Internal Iranian instability could theoretically create intervention pretext, but US has historically not attacked sovereign nations over internal repression alone.

**Critical Gap**: The AskNews synthesis says "No military indicators" while the news articles report significant military deployments. This contradiction is highly problematic. Either:
1. The deployments are false/exaggerated, OR
2. The synthesis is outdated/incorrect, OR  
3. The deployments are routine and not attack preparations

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: ~64 days (January 26 to April 1, 2026)

This is an extremely compressed timeframe for a major military operation against Iran. Historical US attacks on sovereign nations typically involve:
- Months of diplomatic buildup
- Clear casus belli
- Coalition building
- Extensive military staging

**If timeframe halved (32 days)**: Probability would drop to ~3-5%. Insufficient time for necessary preparations.

**If timeframe doubled (~4 months)**: Probability might increase to 12-15%. More realistic timeframe for escalation spiral, though still unlikely without major triggering event.

The short timeframe is actually protective against the resolution criteria being met.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate: 7%**

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. **Recent military deployments (if verified)**: Carrier strike groups and fighter deployments show concrete military positioning, not just rhetoric. This is more tangible than typical saber-rattling. **+3-5 percentage points**
2. **Explicit presidential threats**: Goes beyond typical diplomatic language. **+2-3 percentage points**
3. **Iranian internal instability**: Could provide pretext, though weak. **+1 percentage point**

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. **Compressed timeframe**: 64 days is extremely short for major military operation. **-2 percentage points**
2. **No clear casus belli**: Protest suppression has never triggered US attack on sovereign nation. **-2 percentage points**
3. **Reference class**: US threatened military actions frequently don't materialize. **-1 percentage point**
4. **Lack of coalition/diplomatic groundwork**: No evidence of NATO coordination or UN engagement. **-2 percentage points**

**Net adjustment**: +1 to +4 percentage points from base rate

**Critical uncertainty**: The factual accuracy of military deployment claims is pivotal. If false, probability stays near base rate. If true but routine, modest increase. If true and exceptional, larger increase warranted.

Given the source quality concerns but the specificity of deployment claims, I'm treating them as partially credible but not fully verified.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 7% base rate:
- Military deployment reports (uncertain credibility): +3%
- Presidential threats: +2%  
- Short timeframe constraint: -2%
- No clear casus belli: -1%
- Historical pattern of threats not materializing: -1%

**Calibrated estimate: 8%**

However, this feels insufficiently responsive to the concrete deployment claims if they're accurate. The question is whether current circumstances are sufficiently different from the reference class.

**Recalibration**: If we take the deployment reports more seriously (despite source concerns), the presence of carrier strike groups + fighters + explicit threats + compressed timeframe creates a higher-volatility situation than the base rate suggests. But the absence of diplomatic buildup, clear trigger event, and extremely short timeframe still make attack unlikely.

**Final calibrated estimate: 12%**

This represents:
- Acknowledgment that military positioning is more concrete than typical saber-rattling
- Recognition that short timeframe limits escalation potential
- Respect for base rate showing threatened actions rarely materialize
- Uncertainty about source reliability

A 12% probability means roughly 1 in 8 times in similar circumstances, an attack would occur. This seems aligned with: significant military positioning + explicit threats + internal Iranian instability, but constrained by: short timeframe + no clear trigger + historical pattern of de-escalation + lack of coalition support.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will US militarily attack Iran between now (Jan 26, 2026) and April 2026 (64 days)?

2. **Base rate**: 7% from reference classes of US attacks on sovereign nations and specifically Iran. Final prediction (12%) represents modest upward adjustment based on current military positioning reports.

3. **Consistency**: "12 out of 100 times in situations with carrier deployments, explicit threats, but no clear casus belli and 2-month timeframe, US attacks Iran." This seems reasonable - captures elevated but still unlikely risk.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group deployment toward Iran (single source, uncertain reliability)
   - US President explicit military threats over protest suppression (single source)
   - F-15E and UK Typhoon fighter deployments to region (single source)
   - 64-day timeframe extremely compressed for major military operation (structural constraint)
   - No historical precedent for US attacking sovereign nation over internal repression (reference class)

5. **Blind spot**: A major terrorist attack or Iranian military provocation (e.g., attack on US forces, closure of Strait of Hormuz) could rapidly change the calculation. Such a triggering event would push probability to 40-60%. My forecast assumes no major exogenous shock.

6. **Status quo**: The world changes slowly. Despite heated rhetoric, US-Iran tensions have persisted for decades without direct war. The status quo is continued confrontation without direct military conflict. Given volatility indicators but strong structural constraints, 12% already incorporates some status quo bias while acknowledging current elevated tensions.

Probability: 12%
