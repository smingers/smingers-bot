## Deep Research (AskNews)

Based on my research of recent news up to January 26, 2026, there is no concrete evidence indicating that the United States plans to attack Iran before April 2026. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

1. **Current U.S.-Iran Tensions**  
   The Trump administration continues to maintain an adversarial stance toward Iran, with references to potential military action appearing in speculative or critical contexts:
   - A Russian political analyst suggested Trump might need a "dramatic action" like a military strike on Iran to counter negative media coverage [1].  
   - Critical reports speculate about potential wars with Iran as examples of "extreme cruelty" by the administration, but provide no operational details [3].  
   - European media notes Trump's "suggestions of military intervention in Iran" have strained transatlantic relations [6].

2. **Diplomatic Dynamics**  
   - Leaked messages show French President Macron attempting to influence Trump through diplomacy, claiming "we are completely aligned on Syria" and "we can do great things on Iran" [2][5].  
   - Trump's public sharing of private diplomatic communications has damaged trust with allies, making coordinated action less likely [5][10].

3. **Political Constraints**  
   - Internal Republican divisions are significant, with Senator Ted Cruz privately warning Trump's policies could lead to election "bloodbath" and impeachment risks [4].  
   - The administration faces multiple crises including trade wars, Greenland annexation attempts, and domestic unrest [3][6][10].  

4. **Military Readiness Indicators**  
   News reports contain no evidence of:  
   - Troop buildups in the region  
   - Emergency military appropriations  
   - Statements from Defense Department officials about Iran preparations  
   - Regional ally coordination (like Israel or Saudi Arabia)

**Key Limitations in Assessment**:  
- News reflects analysis up to late January 2026 - developments could change rapidly.  
- Some critical intelligence would not appear in open-source news.  
- Trump's unpredictability remains a variable, though no actionable threats appear in the diplomatic record [5][10].

**Conclusion**  
Based on currently available information, a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026 appears **unlikely but not impossible**. The administration is distracted by multiple crises, lacks reliable international partners for such an action, and shows no public military preparations. However, the speculative nature of references to Iran in political discourse [1][3][6] means the possibility can't be entirely ruled out.

*Recommendation*: Monitor for these key indicators if the situation evolves:  
- Unusual carrier group deployments to the Persian Gulf  
- Emergency Congressional briefings  
- Sudden withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from Iran  
- Escalatory rhetoric from CENTCOM or National Security Advisers

**Tehran Installs Giant Billboard Warning U.S. Against Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**
A large advertising billboard warning the United States against military action was installed in Tehran's Enghelab Square on Sunday, following U.S. President statements about deploying a fleet to the region 'just in case.' The billboard features a dramatic image of a damaged aircraft carrier with destroyed fighters, blood-stained decks, and blood flowing into the water to form patterns resembling the American flag. The slogan 'Sow the wind, reap the storm' appears in the corner. The installation coincided with the movement of the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships toward Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned that forces are 'as ready as never before, with a finger on the trigger.' Tensions have escalated after the brutal suppression of anti-government protests that began on December 28, triggered by the collapse of Iran's currency. According to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, 5,848 people have died and over 41,280 protesters arrested. The U.S. President previously threatened military action if Iran continues killing peaceful demonstrators and conducting mass executions. Iran's General Prosecutor dismissed claims that Tehran paused executions of around 800 arrested protesters as 'completely false.' Former President Trump stated that June strikes on Iranian nuclear sites would be 'a minor matter.' The U.S. Central Command confirmed F-15E Strike Eagle fighters were deployed to the Middle East, and the UK Ministry of Defence announced Typhoon fighters were stationed in Qatar 'for defense purposes.' Iran's Foreign Minister warned the U.S. that Iran would 'open fire in response' to any new attack, citing its readiness after the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. The government claims 3,117 deaths, with 2,427 as civilians or security personnel and the rest labeled 'terrorists.' The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll due to a nationwide internet blackout lasting over two weeks, the largest in Iran's history.

**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**
Geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation. The situation has intensified as of January 25, 2026, according to TimesNow, though specific details about the deployments, threats, or regional reactions are not provided in the article.

**Trump's Escalation Against Iran: Military Posturing or Strategic Gamble?**
The article claims that former U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for military action against Iran, citing the deployment of the USS Lincoln carrier strike group, F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, and B-2 stealth bombers from Missouri, with the potential for a '12-day war' scenario similar to a 2023 operation. It alleges that Iran's hardline leadership defied Trump's earlier diplomatic overtures by announcing the execution of 800 individuals, escalating tensions. The article speculates that China may have sent 16 Y-20 transport aircraft to Iran to deliver HQ-9BE air defense systems, but this claim is dismissed as likely disinformation due to lack of official confirmation and logistical implausibility—16 Y-20s could only carry one full system. The article analyzes three possible scenarios over the next 48 hours: a limited strike followed by de-escalation (30% probability), a full-scale regional war triggered by Iranian retaliation (20% probability), or a diplomatic de-escalation through third-party mediation (50% probability). It concludes that the real conflict is not military but strategic, involving U.S. pressure tactics, Iranian resilience, and the risk of global escalation, with outcomes shaped more by diplomacy, oil markets, and information warfare than by actual combat.

**Protests, Threats, carrier strike group: How US-Iran tensions escalated again**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated significantly, reigniting a long-standing conflict amid ongoing protests in Iran that began in late December 2025. Over 500 people have been killed, and widespread property damage has occurred during anti-government demonstrations triggered by economic collapse, inflation, currency devaluation, and subsidy cuts. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the U.S. of instigating the unrest. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump issued multiple threats, including vowing to 'wipe out Iran' and 'obliterate' its nuclear capacity during potential strikes in June 2025, while also calling Khamenei 'a sick man' and demanding new leadership. Iran retaliated with a firm warning: any attack would trigger a full-scale war. The deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group—comprising a central aircraft carrier, escort warships, and fighter jets—near Iran has heightened fears of a major military confrontation. The situation intensified in January 2026, with Trump stating in an interview that 'anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,' and reaffirming in Davos that Iran 'does want to talk, and will talk.' A senior Iranian official declared the U.S. military presence a direct threat and vowed retaliation using 'everything at its disposal.'

**Why US-Iran Relations Are Deteriorating Again After a Short-Lived Calm?**
US-Iran relations have deteriorated again after a brief period of reduced tension, following a surge in internal unrest in Iran that began in late December 2025. The unrest, sparked by economic grievances including high inflation, a collapsing currency, and declining living standards, escalated into widespread political protests. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet and phone blackout on 8 January 2026, aiming to suppress coordination and limit information flow. Activist groups report over 5,000 deaths, though exact figures remain uncertain due to communication restrictions; the Guardian quoted an Iranian official acknowledging thousands died, blaming 'terrorists and armed rioters.' The Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with Kurdish regions experiencing the worst violence. The US response intensified after President Donald Trump declared Washington would 'come to their rescue,' urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions,' and warned that any attack on him would result in 'wiping them off the face of this earth.' On 14 January 2026, the US reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but the operation was halted at the last moment due to pressure from regional allies, including Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned of unpreparedness for retaliation, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who urged caution. A temporary calm followed, with restored internet access, a halt to executions (though Iran’s chief prosecutor denied mass executions were planned), and reduced public protests, though anti-Khamenei slogans persisted in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan. The pause ended when Trump warned of a 'big flotilla' of US warships approaching Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group, which he described as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran responded sharply: military spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would trigger 'war' and that Iran would 'set fire to their world.' Iran’s Revolutionary Guard stated it has its 'finger on the trigger,' and an Iranian official told Reuters that any attack—limited, surgical, or kinetic—would be considered full-scale war. The US faces uncertain outcomes: limited strikes might embolden protesters and undermine regime confidence, but could also provoke intensified repression. Experts emphasize that Iran’s political future hinges on domestic dynamics, not foreign military intervention. The US carrier group provides strategic leverage, but Iran may respond with calibrated escalation to avoid full war. However, targeting Khamenei would likely trigger an unpredictable and catastrophic conflict.

**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**
The article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**Iran’s Multi-Dimensional Defense Strategy Amid Escalating Regional Tensions**
Iran has developed a multi-dimensional defense strategy in response to escalating tensions with the United States and Israel following widespread protests that began in late December 2023. Initially peaceful, the protests—sparked by economic collapse and currency devaluation—escalated into violence, particularly in western Iran and the capital, Tehran, prompting the Iranian government to cut internet and phone access nationwide on January 8–9, 2024. Western media and Riza Pahlavi, son of the former Shah of Iran, reported between 12,000 and 20,000 deaths, while Iran’s Martyrs and Veterans Foundation stated 3,117 fatalities, including 2,427 security personnel and civilians. The U.S., under President Donald Trump, responded with military mobilization: the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, F-15E fighter jets in Jordan, and F-35 and electronic warfare aircraft were deployed to the region. Despite U.S. military readiness, internal assessments suggested insufficient capacity for a large-scale attack, and Trump stated the military option remained on the table, saying, 'We are watching Iran... we have a massive fleet heading there, but maybe we won’t have to use it.' Iran, believing a U.S. attack is likely in early February 2024, is preparing for a multi-front conflict involving external strikes and internal uprisings. Iran’s primary defense mechanism is the Basij, a paramilitary volunteer force established in 1979 under Ayatollah Khomeini. With approximately 20 million members, Basij is organized into a nationwide network of resistance districts, stations, and centers in mosques, schools, factories, and universities. Key units include Khatam al-Anbiya (for men), Fatemeh Zahra (for women), Bayt al-Muqaddas (for protest suppression), Imam Ali (for security), Imam Hussein (for foreign invasion defense), and Al-Kawthar (women-only). The Basij also operates a secure communication network called 'Shabab' (SHABAB), used for rapid command transmission. During the 12-day Iran-Israel conflict, Basij played a critical role in suppressing internal attacks and securing streets within days. The article concludes that Iran’s internal security relies not only on the military and police but primarily on the Basij’s extensive, multi-layered structure, which enables rapid response to internal dissent and external threats, making it extremely difficult for domestic uprisings to succeed during wartime.

**Tensions Surge in Middle East: U.S. Military Buildup and Iran's Bunkerized Leadership Amid Escalating Crisis**
Tensions between the United States, Israel, and Iran have escalated, with reports indicating that U.S. military forces are deploying aircraft carriers and fighter jets to the Middle East amid fears of an imminent American strike on Iran. Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), met with Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Eyal Zamir in a lengthy and personal meeting, underscoring the deepening strategic military cooperation between the two nations. The U.S. Department of State released a hardline message on X (formerly Twitter) in Persian, stating that violence is an integral part of Iran’s political strategy since 1979, citing the suppression of protests, including the killing of Mahsa Amini and the use of 18-wheel trucks instead of ambulances during crackdowns. According to Time magazine, citing anonymous Iranian health officials, over 30,000 people may have been killed in just two days of protests in early January 2026—far exceeding the official government figure of 3,117. Iran International reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has reportedly retreated into a bunker, with his son Masoud Khamenei acting as a proxy. Iranian Revolutionary Guards declared readiness to follow orders, stating 'We have our finger on the trigger.' Satellite images show damage to Iran’s nuclear sites, including Fordow and Isfahan. U.S. military activity includes the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, increased fighter presence in Jordan, and a spike in Pentagon Pizza Meter deliveries—used as an informal indicator of geopolitical stress. Meanwhile, several airlines suspended flights to Middle Eastern capitals, only to resume after U.S. envoy Steven Witkoff and Jared Kushner arrived in Israel to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu. The article notes that while the situation is highly volatile, the presence of high-level U.S. officials may be delaying a potential military escalation.

**Iran-US tensions LIVE: Trump vs Tehran war of words intensifies with US warships on standby**
Iran-US tensions escalated in early January 2026 amid a backdrop of recent protests and a severe government crackdown. President Donald Trump stated that the US was positioning naval warships closer to the region 'just in case' he decides to act, following earlier warnings of an 'armada heading' toward Iran. In response, Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander, Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, issued a defiant statement, saying Iran's forces are 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger,' prepared to execute orders from the Commander-in-Chief. Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to India publicly thanked New Delhi for voting against a UN Human Rights Council resolution it deemed 'unjust and politically motivated,' calling India's stance 'principled and firm' during a time of heightened Iran-US tensions. The protests, which began in late December 2025 over economic hardship and the collapse of the rial, led to a widespread internet shutdown—the longest and most comprehensive in Iran’s history—severely restricting communication. Activists claim at least 5,000 people were killed during the crackdown, a figure not confirmed by Iranian authorities. By early January 2026, protests appeared to subside, largely due to the communications blackout limiting the flow of footage from the country.

**After A Short-Lived Pause, US-Iran Tensions Are Flaring Again: What Triggered The Escalation?**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated again following a brief de-escalation, reigniting fears of military conflict. The crisis originated in late December 2025 amid widespread protests in Iran over economic hardship, inflation, and a collapsing currency, which quickly evolved into anti-government demonstrations. Iranian authorities responded with a nationwide internet blackout on 8 January 2026, restricting communication and obscuring the scale of unrest. Activist groups estimate over 5,000 people were killed, while the Human Rights Activists news agency reported more than 24,000 arrests, with particularly violent clashes in Kurdish regions. The situation intensified in early January when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Iranians to 'take over your institutions' and called Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'a sick man who should run his country properly,' escalating rhetoric. On 14 January, the U.S. reportedly came close to launching military strikes, but regional pressure from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to a pause. A brief period of calm followed on 16 January, when Trump claimed Iran halted the execution of 800 protesters—though Iran’s top prosecutor denied this. Partial internet restoration and reduced public demonstrations created the illusion of stabilization. However, tensions flared again after Trump warned that any assassination attempt on him would trigger 'overwhelming retaliation' against Iran, referencing his call for Khamenei’s removal. Iran responded swiftly: Armed forces spokesperson Abolfazl Shekarchi declared that any aggression against Khamenei would lead to 'setting fire to their world.' Trump then announced a 'big flotilla' of U.S. warships, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, moving toward the Persian Gulf, framing it as a 'warning rather than a combat mission.' Iran’s senior officials stated that any attack—limited or unlimited—would be treated as full-scale war, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declaring they are 'on high readiness' and have their 'finger on the trigger.' The U.S. now faces several military options: symbolic strikes on nuclear or missile sites, attacks on Iran’s security forces (IRGC, Basij), cyber operations, strikes on economic infrastructure (oil and gas facilities), or the most unpredictable option—assassination-style strikes targeting Khamenei. Analysts caution that while strikes might boost protester morale and expose regime weaknesses, they risk triggering greater repression, as seen in past uprisings. A U.S. strike on Khamenei could cause a power vacuum, given Iran’s lack of consensus on succession, and would almost certainly lead to war. Experts emphasize that Iran’s future will be determined by Iranians, not U.S. military action. Iran is expected to respond to any U.S. move with calibrated, symbolic retaliation to maintain deterrence while avoiding full-scale war—unless Khamenei is targeted, which would mark a decisive shift toward all-out conflict.

**Iran and the U.S. at the Brink: Between 'I Won't Strike' and the Roar of Battleships**
The article analyzes the escalating tension between the United States and Iran, highlighting a stark contrast between public statements and military actions. While Donald Trump publicly declares 'I will not attack,' U.S. military movements—including the repositioning of aircraft carriers, heightened readiness at bases from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean, and open sea deployments—signal a clear military preparedness. The U.S. does not mobilize for show; such actions reflect a real, if restrained, readiness for military options. Trump’s strategy is framed as one of 'brinkmanship,' using the threat of war to extract concessions without direct conflict. Iran, with its nuclear program and regional influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, is seen as both a strategic target and a destabilizing force. The U.S. military buildup serves not only as a deterrent but also as a strategic umbrella for Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat and seeks opportunities for limited, controlled escalation. Israel, though not seeking a full war, interprets U.S. posture as implicit support, enabling it to act with greater confidence. Iran, aware of U.S. reluctance for war and Israeli pressure, carefully manages its responses—raising tensions when advantageous but avoiding full-scale conflict. However, the risk of miscalculation is high due to multiple actors, overlapping interests, and multiple flashpoints. A minor incident—such as a misinterpreted missile launch or a poorly timed attack—could rapidly escalate into a broader conflict. The region, including the Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and even distant countries like Egypt, remains vulnerable to economic, political, and security fallout. The article concludes that while war is not inevitable, the conditions for conflict are fully in place: an openly hostile adversary, military mobilization, an eager ally, and an already volatile regional environment. What remains uncertain is only the timing—often abrupt and unpredictable in the Middle East. The article emphasizes that in international politics, words are for public consumption, but military movements are the true language of power. Between denial and preparation, the region stands at a precipice, aware of the danger but uncertain of the outcome.

**US-Iran Relations: 2026  --  A New Geopolitical Order on a Powder Keg**
The article analyzes the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran in early 2026, framing them as a critical turning point in a decades-long conflict rooted in historical trauma. The 'spine effect'—shaped by the 1953 CIA-backed coup that overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh and the 1979 Islamic Revolution—continues to influence both nations' strategic mindsets. Washington’s 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' strategy and Iran’s position at the 'nuclear threshold' have narrowed diplomatic space. Key developments from 2021 to 2026 include the collapse of JCPOA negotiations, regional proxy escalation (2023), direct missile exchanges between Iran and Israel (2024), the '12-Day War' (2025), and mass domestic protests in Iran (2026) driven by economic collapse. As of January 2026, Iran’s enriched uranium stockpiles are sufficient for 5–10 nuclear warheads, crossing Washington’s red line. The risk of large-scale war is estimated at 65–70%, with triggers including nuclear weaponization, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and regime-driven scapegoating. Regional consequences include potential oil price spikes to $150–180 per barrel, disruption of global supply chains, and a new refugee wave. Three scenarios are outlined: 'The Grand Bargain' (15% probability), 'Permanent Grey Zone' (50% probability), and 'Regional Apocalypse' (35% probability). The article concludes that 2026 marks the end of strategic ambiguity, with no clear winners in a conflict that would devastate global energy markets and regional stability. Iran’s internal unrest now plays a more decisive role than U.S. military threats.

**Analysts Warn Iran’s Instability Could Trigger Nuclear Proliferation Risks**
Analysts warn that internal instability in Iran’s theocratic regime, exacerbated by escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran following Tehran’s crackdown on protests, could heighten the risk of nuclear proliferation. Although former U.S. President Trump appears to have abandoned military strikes, he still called for ending Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s nearly 40-year rule on April 17, 2024. Meanwhile, a U.S. aircraft carrier moved from the South China Sea through Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, positioning itself on a potential route to the Middle East. David Albright, founder of the Washington-based non-profit Institute for Science and International Security and a former Iraqi nuclear inspector, stated that during internal chaos, Iran may lose its ability to protect its nuclear assets. He highlighted the 440.9 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60% purity—close to the 90% threshold for weapons-grade material—as particularly concerning, noting that portions could be stolen. Historical precedent exists: after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, weakened security led to the disappearance of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. Despite Israel’s 12-day attack and U.S. bombing in June 2024, Iran has maintained control over its nuclear facilities. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran’s 60% enriched uranium stockpile remains unverified since the June 2024 conflict, with IAEA losing continuous monitoring records. An IAEA-affiliated diplomat confirmed the agency has not received updated information on the stockpile’s status or location. Albright noted the material could fit into 18–20 cylindrical containers, each weighing about 50 kg and easily movable by two people. Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation policy at the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, warned that the stockpile could be transferred to secret programs or stolen by factions within Iran’s government or military seeking to retain nuclear weapons options. She emphasized that the risk is real but difficult to assess due to the lack of transparency, especially during periods of internal instability or potential regime collapse, when nuclear materials might be smuggled out or sold to non-state actors.

**Tensions Between the U.S. and Iran Could Escalate into a Larger Conflict - HSB NOTICIAS**
Tensions between the United States and Iran have escalated following reciprocal threats and military movements in the region. The U.S. has withdrawn part of its military personnel from a key base in Qatar, warning of potential Iranian retaliation. Iranian officials have reaffirmed their commitment to respond to any threat against their country. Internationally, joint military exercises with nations such as South Africa have drawn criticism and indicate deteriorating relations. Domestically, Iran faces ongoing protests, with its leader blaming the U.S. for inciting destabilization, further intensifying the situation. Although there has been a slight decline in the most intense protests, the internal environment remains volatile, marked by a strong presence of security forces. According to international relations experts, if the United States conducts a direct military strike against Iran—whether over its nuclear program or in retaliation—there is a high probability such an action would trigger a broader regional conflict.

**The Strategic Cost of a Potential U.S. Military Intervention in Iran Before Any Attack**
Tensions between Washington and Tehran are escalating amid repeated threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump, raising questions about the likelihood of U.S. military intervention in Iran and its strategic consequences. Trump has vowed immediate action if protests in Iran intensify, but former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned this rhetoric has undermined American credibility, giving Iranians the impression that U.S. support is imminent—making military action seem necessary to restore credibility. Panetta also noted that rising casualties and internet blackouts in Iran could pressure Trump, who claims his decisions are guided by personal ethics rather than international law. According to Karim Sadjadpour, a U.S. Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Trump has threatened military action against Iran seven times in two weeks, with many hoping the U.S. will provide a 'protective umbrella' for Iranian protesters. Strategic reasons cited by CNN include Iran’s domestic and international weakening due to economic crises and currency collapse, reduced regional influence after the October 7, 2023 war, and the belief among some Americans that the U.S. can leverage this moment to reshape the Middle East. Trump boasts of defying traditional presidential norms, referencing past actions such as the alleged assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities in June of the previous year, and strong support from Republican allies like Lindsey Graham. However, experts caution that Trump’s threats may lose credibility without accompanying military force. Historical precedents show U.S. military interventions carry risks, including the potential for a new Iranian leadership to emerge. The impact of a U.S. strike on Iranian protesters remains uncertain—while some fear it could backfire and provoke stronger backlash, others question whether strikes would actually protect civilians. Ultimately, any U.S. decision to intervene in Iran would come with a high political and military cost, both regionally and in terms of global credibility, amid complex internal and external challenges that make such a move highly risky.

**Gulf on edge: Iran warns it will target US military bases if attacked**
Tensions in the Gulf have escalated as Iran has warned Qatar and Saudi Arabia it will target U.S. military bases if attacked, according to Middle East expert Professor Mehran Kamrava of Georgetown University in Qatar. The movement of some U.S. personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—described as precautionary by Qatari officials—reflects growing regional fears of direct U.S.-Iran conflict. Kamrava emphasized that Iran’s 'axis of resistance' has collapsed, forcing Tehran to rely on ballistic missiles for retaliation, with no political room to avoid responding if the U.S. strikes. He stated, 'If Iran is hit, they will hit American targets in the region,' and warned that retaliation would be 'much more lethal' than in the past. He cited historical precedents, including the 2020 killing of General Qassem Soleimani and June 2025 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, to underscore the consistency of Iranian responses. Additionally, Kamrava noted that protests in Iran—originating from economic hardship and rial collapse—have intensified due to government overreaction and external influence, with widespread anti-government sentiment now prevalent. He stressed that a sober assessment of consequences is essential to prevent further escalation, saying, 'You can't hit Iran and be done with it.'

**Saturday War? Assessing the Likelihood of a U.S.-Iran Conflict Based on Market Timing and Precedent**
The Lebanese news outlet Lebanon24 reported on January 15, 2026, that the Israeli website Walla cited intelligence assessments suggesting a potential U.S.-Iran war could begin on the upcoming Saturday. The report linked this timing to the strategic use of weekend operations by both Israel and the United States to minimize disruption to financial markets, referencing the precedent of the U.S. 'Operation Washington' in Venezuela, which occurred on a Saturday, January 3, 2024, resulting in the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. The article noted that U.S. military actions have historically been scheduled on weekends to allow markets time to absorb information before Monday’s trading session. It cited a study analyzing stock market returns from 1926 to 2014, showing average positive returns of over 0.20% on Fridays, while returns on Mondays were near zero or negative. Although the study has no direct link to military operations, the report argued it aligns with the perceived timing of a looming conflict with Iran. The article also suggested that the sudden departure of Benjamin Netanyahu’s family from Israel and the influence of billionaire-led U.S. leadership—where wealth depends on market volatility—further support the scenario. Following the Venezuela operation, major indices such as the Dow Jones and S&P 500 reportedly rose on Monday, indicating market stability after weekend announcements.

**Why is Iran erupting again: Economy in free fall, mass unrest**
Nationwide protests in Iran, sparked by the collapse of the rial and a worsening economic crisis with inflation reaching approximately 40%, have led to a deadly government crackdown, internet blackouts, and heightened tensions with the United States. Over 600 protests have occurred across all 31 provinces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, reporting at least 646 deaths and over 10,700 arrests—figures not independently verified due to internet restrictions. The Iranian government has not released official casualty numbers. The economic crisis intensified after the UN reimposed sanctions in September 2023 over Iran’s nuclear program, causing the rial to fall to over 1.4 million to USD 1. Price increases on subsidized gasoline and the end of preferential exchange rates for food products have further strained the population. Protests began in late December 2025 among Tehran merchants and expanded to include anti-government slogans, with some protesters supporting exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Iran’s regional 'Axis of Resistance' has weakened significantly: Hamas was defeated in Gaza, Hezbollah’s leadership was decimated, and Syria’s President Bashar Assad was overthrown in December 2024. China continues to buy Iranian oil, but neither China nor Russia has offered overt military support. The West remains concerned about Iran’s nuclear program; although US intelligence assesses Iran has not yet begun weaponization, it has conducted activities that could enable it. Iran recently claimed to have stopped uranium enrichment, signaling openness to negotiations, but no talks have occurred since the June 2025 US-led attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Tensions between Iran and the US stem from historical enmity: the 1979 Islamic Revolution severed diplomatic ties after the hostage crisis, and US actions during the Iran-Iraq War, including the downing of an Iranian airliner, deepened mistrust. Relations briefly improved with the 2015 nuclear deal, but Trump’s 2018 withdrawal reignited conflict, especially after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. US President Donald Trump has warned that if Iran violently suppresses protesters, the US will intervene, citing the recent capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro as a precedent.

**U.S. Military Attack on Iran Probability Surges Past 50% on Prediction Market Amid Escalating Tensions**
On January 13, 2026, the Polymarket prediction platform reported that the probability of the United States launching a military attack on Iran had risen to 54%, exceeding 50% for the first time, up 9 percentage points in the past 24 hours. The likelihood of a U.S. military strike occurring by January 23 increased from 29% to 43%. Approximately $13.7 million has been wagered on the outcome. If the U.S. conducts a military attack—via drones, missiles, or airstrikes—on Iranian territory, including embassies and consulates, the market will settle on 'YES'; otherwise, if the attack is prevented, it will be a no-count result. Polymarket, which uses the CRYPTO: POL token, has previously faced criticism for profiting from conflicts and wars. Meanwhile, the probability that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will step down this month remains low at 20%. The surge in speculation follows a new travel advisory issued by the U.S. virtual embassy in Iran, warning U.S. citizens to evacuate due to escalating protests that have entered their 16th day. The advisory cites a significant risk of interrogation, arrest, or detention for U.S. passport holders or those perceived to have ties to the U.S. The U.S. virtual embassy serves as a diplomatic platform since the U.S. and Iran do not maintain formal diplomatic relations. According to the U.S.-based nonprofit Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 656 people, including 505 protesters, have died during the unrest. Iran claims foreign interference is behind the uprising, which began due to public anger over currency devaluation and hyperinflation. The Trump administration is reportedly considering various responses, including military action. Tehran has signaled both readiness for war and willingness to negotiate.

**High Probability of Direct Confrontation Between Iran, the U.S., and Israel**
Iranian sources, including the newspaper 'Kayhan', indicate that a direct confrontation between Iran, the United States, and Israel is 'highly probable.' The article cites Avigdor Lieberman, former Israeli defense minister and leader of 'Yisrael Beiteinu,' who stated on social media platform X that those who believe the issue with Iran is resolved are mistaken, noting Iran's ongoing military and defense advancements, including resumed nuclear site activities, and efforts to surprise its adversaries. The newspaper argues that Iran's strong national unity after the 12-day war—where it delivered a 'strong slap' to the U.S. and the Zionist regime—has made a repeat of the failed strategy used in Syria unlikely. The article claims the enemy attempted to exploit economic hardship in Iran to incite unrest, but failed, prompting renewed efforts to undermine public livelihood through sanctions, media, and social media. The paper asserts that ongoing economic instability in Iran is a continuation of the war's aftermath and that the enemy's open attacks on the population's well-being confirm the likelihood of renewed conflict. It concludes that the world stands at a historical turning point, and a potential confrontation between Iran and the U.S.-Israel alliance could have significant global consequences.

**Iran and Israel on the Brink: Escalating Tensions Amid Sanctions and Military Posturing**
Iran and Israel face heightened tensions following the reactivation of sanctions mechanisms under the 2015 nuclear deal, with the U.S. re-imposing restrictions on arms trade, uranium enrichment, ballistic missile launches, and global asset freezes, while authorizing international inspections of Iranian aircraft and vessels. Israel, closely monitoring the situation, has raised its military readiness, citing Iran’s advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile capabilities as existential threats. Israeli assessments after the June 2024 12-day conflict indicate Iran’s resilience despite strikes, reinforcing the need for massive investment in missile defense systems like Arrow, Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and the newly deployed U.S. THAAD batteries. Iran, in response, has reaffirmed its readiness to defend against any aggression, citing ongoing upgrades to its military systems and the integration between the regular army and the Revolutionary Guard. Iran’s missile range—up to 2,000 km—covers Israel, and its leadership has signaled willingness to extend missile reach as needed. Iran has also received Russian MiG-29s and is acquiring Sukhoi-35s, while relying on 'ghost ships' to evade sanctions. Experts, including Israeli analyst Omar Mubaraki and U.S. advisor Gabriel Somma, warn of a potential new confrontation, with Israel pursuing a strategy of targeted preemptive strikes and strategic pressure, while the U.S. prioritizes diplomacy and sanctions over military action. The region stands at a critical juncture, with the balance of power shifting amid escalating military posturing and intelligence-driven deterrence. Historical precedents show sanctions and deterrence have limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions but failed to eliminate its military capabilities.

### 2020s in military history
. Whilst the invasion failed its main goal of a rapid victory, as Ukraine pushed back the northern arm of the invasion and prevented the capture of Kyiv, Russia maintained a military occupation of the southeast of Ukraine, and several months after the invasion, unilaterally declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials. The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was an armed conflict between Azerbaijan, supported by Turkey, and the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh together with Armenia, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but partially governed by Artsakh, a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. Clashes began on the morning of 27 September 2020 along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, which had been established in the aftermath of the First Nagorno-Karabakh war (1988–1994). In response to the clashes, Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilization, while Azerbaijan introduced martial law and a curfew, later declaring partial mobilization on 28 September 2020. Turkey provided military support to Azerbaijan, although the extent of this support has been disputed. Turkey's involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence, both by increasing the standing of Azerbaijan in the conflict and by marginalizing Russia's influence over the region

2020s in military history

. Following the capture of Shusha, the second-largest settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ending all hostilities in the area from 00:00, 10 November 2020 Moscow Time. The President of Artsakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, also agreed to end the hostilities. Under the agreement, the warring sides will keep control of their currently held areas within Nagorno-Karabakh, while Armenia will return the surrounding territories it occupied in 1994 to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain land access to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Approximately 2,000 Russian soldiers will be deployed as peacekeeping forces along the Lachin corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh for a mandate of at least five years. On 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, beginning the Gaza war. On 8 October 2023, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired guided rockets and artillery shells at Israeli positions, beginning the 2023 Israel-Hezbollah conflict. On 1 April 2024, Israel conducted an airstrike on the Iranian consulate complex in Damascus, Syria, beginning the 2024 Iran-Israel conflict. In September 2024, the Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated into the 2024 Israel-Hezbollah War. On 13 June 2025, Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities, starting the Iran–Israel war, which resulted in a ceasefire after the US attacked Iranian nuclear sites. In January 2020, the United States assassinated the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, general Qasem Soleimani. This led to an Iranian missile strike against bases housing US troops in Iraq five days later. As a result of expectations of a US retribution, the Iranian air defence system accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people on board. The International Maritime Security Construct was setup by the US to prevent Iran from disrupting international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. Israel was suspected of being behind at least five explosions and fires at Iranian nuclear sites in the summer of 2020

2020s in military history

. The leading nuclear scientist of the country, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated on 27 November 2020, with Iran blaming Israel for the attack. The Yemeni Civil War is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently control the capital Sanaʽa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. Concurrently, the Hadi government is in conflict with UAE forces as a result of UAE military measures such as the United Arab Emirates takeover of Socotra and UAE-backed STC takeover of Aden. In February 2020, the political track of the Libyan peace process started in Geneva among 20 Libyans, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the Libyan House of Representatives, and from the independent persons' group selected by UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), including Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, former Education Minister Othman Abdul Jalil and former head of the HCS Abdulrahman Sewehli. The aimed composition was 13 HoR representatives from both the Tobruk and Tripoli branches, 13 HCS representatives and 14 UNSMIL-selected independent Libyans, for a total of 40. The Tigray conflict was an armed conflict that began in November 2020 in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, between Tigray Region special forces led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) in alliance with Amhara Region special forces. The conflict stemmed from the attempt of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to distance the country's politics from ethnic federalism, a power-sharing system giving regional influence to individual ethnic groups, by merging the ethnic and region-based parties of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which had governed Ethiopia for 30 years, into a nationwide Prosperity Party

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
. However, Russia's tie with Saudi Arabia has become increasingly warmed since 2010s despite numerous differences, thus sometimes affected Iran's stance on relations with Russia. In the past, Saudi Arabia backed Chechen and Dagestani fighters as well as Arab Mujahedeen in the North Caucasus during the First and Second Chechen Civil Wars in the 1990s, in which Russia has fought against them. In recent years however, Saudi Arabia has shifted its diplomacy to become friendlier to Russia, with King Salman became the first Saudi head of state to visit Russia, heralding possible political change. Since then, Saudi Arabia and Russia have started to support each other in various conflicts in Syria and Libya, with Saudi Arabia supported Russian intervention in Syria, while Russia and Saudi Arabia have together backed Khalifa Haftar's forces in Libya. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Russia are also becoming more antagonistic to Iranian ambitions in the Middle East, as revealed by their secret cooperation alongside Israel and Jordan against Iran. Likewise, since late 2010s, sign of Iranian–Russian friction emerged, following Iran's attempt to turn Bashar al-Assad to align with the Islamist ideology of the Iranian regime which opposed to Russia's desire for a secular state. Russia's attitude toward Iran is also becoming more negative due to Iranian desire to control the Middle East, resulting in growing cooperation with Saudi Arabia. But currently after the fall of Assad regime in Syria Russia have diverted its ties from Syrian Saudi-backed regime towards other regional partners Oman is a member of the GCC and thus, maintains a close relationship with Saudi Arabia. However, unlike the majority of GCC countries, Oman does not perceive Iran as a threat. Oman has long promoted itself as the main stabilizing force amidst the intensified Iranian–Saudi conflict and often prefers a diplomatic solution to end the proxy wars. However, it is alleged of Houthi support and Iranian arms smuggling. Pakistan is a major partner of Saudi Arabia, but is also a neighbor of Iran, sharing historical ties as well. Prior to 1979, the three countries formed a moderate relationship and acted as responsible Muslim states. However, since 1979, Pakistan has fallen into sectarian discord due to growing attempt by Iran and Saudi Arabia to spread influence to the country, with Pakistan having a balance of Sunni and Shi'a Muslims

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia has been historically strong, and often Pakistan has feared Iran is trying to recruit its large Shi'a population to serve for Iran's military adventures, given by increasing number of vanishing Shi'as in Pakistan. Its link with Iran is also marred with a number of problems regarding not just Shia issue, but also due to conflict in Afghanistan, with Iran-backed proxies have fought against Pakistan and its ally Taliban, further strengthens Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia. However, Pakistan has refrained from criticizing Iran, but rather seeks to preserve the relations, given its long historical relationship with Iran. Pakistan has backed Iran on its effort to maintain border security in the restive Balochistan region, and have cooperated against the Soviets in the 1980s. In 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, during a visit to Tehran, said that he was trying promote talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia to defuse the tension between the two countries. But now Pakistan now after current Iran-Israel war 2025 prefers to have good relations with Iran. It remained neutral during the 2017 Qatar-Gulf crisis. Syria has been a major theater in the proxy conflict throughout its ongoing civil war, which began in 2011. Iran and the GCC states have provided varying degrees of military and financial support to opposing sides, with Iran backing the Assad government and Saudi Arabia supporting rebel militants. Ba'athist Syria was an important part of Iran's sphere of influence, and the government under Bashar al-Assad had long been a major ally. During the early stages of the Arab Spring, Supreme Leader Khamenei initially expressed support for the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, characterizing them as an "Islamic awakening" akin to its own revolution in 1979. When protests broke out in Syria, Iran changed its position and condemned them, comparing the uprising to its own presidential election protests in 2009 and accusing the United States and Israel of being behind the unrest. The war threatened Iran's position, and Saudi Arabia and its allies sided with Sunni rebels in part to weaken Iran. For years Iranian forces were involved on the ground, with soldiers in Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps facing heavy casualties. In 2014, with no end in sight to the conflict, Iran increased its ground support for the Syrian Army, providing elite forces, intelligence gathering, and training. Iran also backed pro-Assad Hezbollah fighters

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. Although Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed in 2015 to participate in peace talks in Vienna in participation with United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the talks ultimately failed. Saudi Arabia countered Russia's intervention in Syria by increasing its support for the rebels and supplying American-made anti-tank TOW missiles, a move which slowed initial progress made by Russian and Syrian forces. Iran suffered a significant setback in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime to renewed rebel offensives in 2024. Yemen's geographical position in the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, close to Egypt and East Africa, and bordering Saudi Arabia, makes it important for Iran. With the help of the Houthis, Iran was able to expand its network of proxies without making significant financial or military investments in the southern borders of Saudi Arabia. With Iranian assistance, the Houthis were able to consolidate their position in Yemen and the Middle East. Yemen has been called one of the major fronts in the conflict as a result of the revolution and subsequent civil war. Yemen had for years been within the Saudi sphere of influence. The decade-long Houthi insurgency in Yemen stoked tensions with Iran, with accusations of covert support for the rebels. A 2015 UN report alleged that Iran provided the Houthi rebels with money, training, and arms shipments beginning in 2009. However, the degree of support has been subject to debate, and accusations of greater involvement have been denied by Iran. The 2014–2015 coup d'état was viewed by Saudi leadership as an immediate threat, and as an opportunity for Iran to gain a foothold in the region. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states, including all GCC members except Oman, intervened and launched airstrikes and a ground offensive in the country, declaring the entire Saada Governorate a military target and imposing a naval blockade. The United States intervened in October 2016 after missiles were fired at a US warship, which was in place to protect oil shipments along the sea lane passing through the Mandeb Strait. The US blamed the rebels and responded by targeting radar sites with missile strikes along the Red Sea coast. In response, rebels called the strikes evidence of American support for the Saudi campaign. While the majority of Muslims in Iraq are Shia, the country has been ruled for decades by Sunni-dominated governments under the Ottoman Empire, the British-installed Hashemites, and the Ba'athists

### Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration
. Project Cassandra was a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) initiative launched in 2008 to disrupt Hezbollah's funding networks by targeting its involvement in international drug trafficking and money laundering. While the operation uncovered significant links between Hezbollah and organized crime, its later years were marked by controversy over allegations that enforcement efforts were slowed to protect the JCPOA negotiations with Iran—a claim disputed by former officials. On January 12, 2016, two United States Navy riverine command boats were seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy after they entered Iranian territorial waters near Iran's Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. Initially, the U.S. military claimed the sailors inadvertently entered Iranian waters owing to mechanical failure, but it was later reported that they entered Iranian waters because of navigational errors. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif within five minutes, the first of a series of phone calls between the two. The sailors had a brief verbal exchange with the Iranian military and were released, unharmed, 15 hours later. The release was hailed by the Obama administration as an unintended benefit of the new diplomatic relationship. Iran released pictures of captured U.S. sailors. Some U.S. Republican 2016 presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump criticized the U.S. response to the detention, which they deemed too weak. Although the JCPOA removed sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program, the United States continued to enforce sanctions concerning human rights violations, support for terrorism, and ballistic missile activities. Iran frequently criticized this dual-track approach as undermining the spirit of the agreement, even if not in legal violation, and cited it as evidence of bad faith. Additionally, European banks and corporations were hesitant to engage with Iran due to the risk of U.S. secondary sanctions, which discouraged financial and commercial transactions despite the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. During this period, the United States backed the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), an exiled opposition group that had once allied with Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and was delisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2012. The MEK received public support from several high-profile American politicians and was promoted by some as a viable alternative to Iran's current leadership

Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration

. On 8 and 9 March 2016 the IRGC conducted ballistic missile tests as part of its military drills, with one of the Qadr H missiles carrying the inscription, "Israel should be wiped off the Earth." Israel called on Western powers to punish Iran for the tests, which U.S. officials said did not violate the nuclear deal but might violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the tests were not in violation of the UNSC resolution. On 17 March the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian and British companies for involvement in the Iranian ballistic missile program. On 21 May 2016 Zarif, during a meeting with his New Zealander counterpart Murray McCully, while statements of support (like those from the U.S.) are politically helpful, they are not sufficient unless matched by action — especially to resolve obstacles created by years of sanctions and U.S. hostility. In parallel with ongoing sanctions and legal disputes, tensions also extended into the judiciary. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Iran must pay nearly $2 billion to victims of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. Although U.S. troops generally have no legal right to sue under combat rules, the judge determined they were on a peacekeeping mission under peacetime rules of engagement. As a result, survivors and family members were allowed to sue Iran under a 1996 law permitting U.S. citizens to take legal action against nations that sponsor terrorism. Meanwhile, Iran and the United States engaged in indirect military confrontation during the Arab Spring, primarily in Syria following an uprising against the pro-Iranian dictator Bashar al-Assad, with both sides supporting opposing factions. Iran backed al-Assad through proxy forces, viewing his regime as vital to its regional interests. The U.S., Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia supported the uprising, with the latter three funding revolutionary groups. As the conflict escalated into a broader civil war, it evolved into a proxy struggle between Russia and the United States, with Russia largely supporting Iranian efforts in Syria to contain rebels. Iran, Russia, and Syria, alongside Hezbollah and Iraq, formed a military coalition, which was viewed by the U.S. as an attempt by said countries to antagonize the West. Iran and the U.S. also engaged in proxy warfare in Yemen, where the U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen. The U.S

### Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration
Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration (2021–2025) were shaped by efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement alongside ongoing regional tensions, sanctions, cyberattacks, and proxy conflicts. Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. officials expressed interest in returning to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but negotiations in Vienna eventually stalled. Iran increased uranium enrichment and imposed retaliatory sanctions, while the U.S. imposed new sanctions over missile programs, oil exports, and human rights abuses. Tensions persisted throughout this era, marked by recurring proxy attacks on U.S. bases, which intensified following the outbreak of the Gaza war in late 2023, and by subsequent American retaliatory strikes. The period also saw disputes over the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and military escalations across the Gulf region. In 2023, a breakthrough occurred with a U.S.–Iran prisoner swap and the release of frozen Iranian funds, though indirect diplomacy remained fragile. Iran was later accused of interfering in the 2024 U.S. presidential election through cyber operations and AI disinformation. Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust.

Alleged assassination plots targeting Donald Trump and dissidents on U.S. soil further strained relations. By late 2024, relations remained adversarial, marked by unresolved security disputes and growing mistrust. At the outset of the Biden administration in January 2021, Iran was led by President Hassan Rouhani, a centrist cleric who had previously championed the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) and advocated for improved relations with the West, while ultimate authority rested with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who held decisive power over Iran’s foreign and security policies. Relations between the U.S. and Iran were deeply strained, with no formal diplomatic ties since 1980. The United States had withdrawn from the JCPOA, reimposed sweeping sanctions, and escalated military tensions, while Iran had resumed higher-level uranium enrichment and reduced compliance with the nuclear deal in violation of the agreement. The Biden administration initially expressed interest in re-engaging with Iran on the Iran nuclear deal, which the previous administration had withdrawn from in 2018, sparking international backlash. Early in his presidency, Biden formally extended an offer to restart diplomatic talks on a new nuclear deal, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that the U.S. would consider re-entering the agreement if Iran returned to "strict compliance" with its terms

Iran–United States relations during the Biden administration

. At the time, Blinken also did not rule out the possibility of military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. As Iran continued to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2021, the government repeatedly urged the Biden administration to lift sanctions. Strict financial measures imposed by the previous Trump administration had negatively impacted Iranian economies. Tensions remained high in the region. Following a militia-organized rocket attack in Erbil, Iraq, which wounded four American contractors and one soldier, in February 2021 the United States Military conducted airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria, including Kata'ib Hezbollah. The attacks sparked renewed debate over presidential war powers, with key Democratic lawmakers expressing concern about conducting military operations without prior congressional approval. Over 220 US Congress leaders endorsed House Resolution 118 in April 2021, expressing support for "the Iranian people's desire for a democratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic of Iran" and condemning "violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism". Around the same time, signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) met in Vienna in an effort to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement. U.S. and Iranian officials participated in so-called proximity talks in order to exchange views on how to return to the considered deal. Both sides downplayed expectations for rapid progress, insisting that the other should resume their commitments first. Talks continued even after an explosion at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, blamed on Israel, to which Iran responded by increasing uranium enrichment to 60% purity, its highest level to date. Diplomatic tensions remained unresolved in late 2021, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stating that military intervention to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons could not be ruled out. Around the same time, Iran imposed sanctions on former U.S. President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and eight others for their alleged roles in the 2020 killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani. Iran also requested their arrest through Interpol. President Ebrahim Raisi stated that Trump, Pompeo, and others must be tried in a "fair court". In 2021, Iran's crude oil exports had been re-imposed sanctions by the United States after Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA

### 2020s in United States history
. His second administration has been criticized for its targeting of political opponents and civil society. Many of his administration's actions have been found by judges to be illegal and unconstitutional, and have been criticized as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. Trump is the second U.S. president to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first with a felony conviction. At 78 years old and seven months, he is the oldest person to become U.S. president. Following his electoral victories in 2016 and 2024, he is constitutionally ineligible from seeking further terms due to the Twenty-second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, although many of his associates have discussed the possibility of him running for a third term. In the years 2021-2022 Biden promoted 2 bills that can reduce the US greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% from the level of 2005: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Act. The group of experts who made the analysis said that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act alone will make only a small reduction in emissions, but they did not count at all the impact of measures regarding highways and public transport. The bill includes the largest federal investment in public transit in history. The bill includes spending of 105 billion dollars in public transport. It also give 110 billion on fixing roads and bridges what includes measures for climate change mitigation - access for cyclists and pedestrians. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was enacted in late 2021. The plan includes measures for reaching carbon neutrality in the electricity sector, supporting electric vehicles, and promoting energy efficiency on a very large scale. The plan should cost $2.3 trillion. If passed, it can have a large influence on the Greenhouse gas emissions of the United States. The plan, according to Biden's administration, should help rebuild the American economy and create millions of jobs. Biden's administration claims that economic and climate issues are linked. 19 Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell, voted for it, despite criticism from Donald Trump, who called it "the beginning of the Green New Deal". The bill includes spending of 105 billion dollars for public transit, 21 billion for environmental projects, 50 billion for water storage, 15 billion for electric vehicles. 73 billion dollars will be spent on power infrastructure what includes its adjustment to renewable energy. 110 billion will be spent on fixing roads and bridges what includes measures for climate change mitigation - access for cyclists and pedestrians

2020s in United States history

. The plan also includes 1 billion for better connection of neighborhoods separated by transport infrastructure. According to Biden's administration the plan should add 2 million jobs per year. Tensions between the United States and Iran heated up in January 2020 when Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was killed in a drone attack. Iran retaliated with a strike on U.S. military bases in Iraq. Tensions let up somewhat after it is revealed that Iran accidentally shot down a civilian plane that departed Tehran for Kyiv. The U.S.-Irani relationship remained tense throughout 2020, with the U.S. sending B52s over the Persian Gulf twice in December. In late February 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed an agreement that could lead to the end of the war in Afghanistan. Ivan Duque, president of Colombia, revealed in March 2020 that his country and the United States had a three-prong policy to bring about change in Venezuela: support for the opposition, diplomatic isolation, and economic pressures including a blockade against petroleum exports and against financial support. He said the effort was paying off as social discontent increases, oil exports reach only 500,000 barrels/day, and Venezuela could not pay for industrial parts, food, or medicine. On March 26, 2020, the United States accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of narcoterrorism and offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The stock market fell over 3,000 points in the last week of February 2020, the greatest fall since 2008, as investors worry about disruptions to supplies because of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Stocks fell to 18,592 points (Dow average) on March 23 after a procedural Senate vote on a coronavirus economic stimulus bill failed for the second time in two days. In the late spring and early summer of 2022, gas prices soared as a result of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Nationwide gas prices reached an all-time high of $5.02 a gallon on June 14, 2022. [1] In late February 2020, the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign sued The New York Times for libel for intentionally publishing a false opinion article related to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. a week later they sued The Washington Post for the same thing

. In March, the Justice Department indicated it might not pursue legal action against a Russian company that bankrolled 2016 election interference. In the 2019 Special Counsel investigation, Robert Mueller concluded that the Russians and other countries were already trying to interfere in the 2020 United States elections. Other reports indicated that not only Russia but also China and Iran were meddling in U.S. elections. Dan Coats, director of National Intelligence, testified about such interference before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January 2019. Similar testimony in February 2020 that Russia was trying to help the campaigns of President Trump and Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders led to the firing of acting director of national intelligence, retired Vice Adm. Joseph Maguire, and his replacement by Richard Grenell. Sanders vehemently rejected Russian support for his campaign. Social media companies Facebook and Twitter announced in March 2020 that they had dismantled scores of Russian-backed trolls originating in Ghana and Nigeria, following a CNN report about troll farms in the two countries. After the 2020 United States presidential election in which Joe Biden prevailed, then-incumbent Donald Trump, as well as his campaign, his proxies, and many of his supporters, pursued an aggressive and unprecedented effort to deny and overturn the election. The attempts to overturn the election were described as an attempted coup d'état and an implementation of "the big lie." Trump and his allies promoted numerous false claims that the election was stolen from Trump through an international communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and electoral fraud. These claims culminated in a rally at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 calling for Congress to deny the certification of Biden's Electoral College victory. The rally led to the 2021 United States Capitol attack, when Trump supporters illegally entered the building, causing its temporary evacuation. Health care emerged as a leading issue in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and the 2020 United States elections as a whole. The United States' response to the COVID-19 pandemic was slow. China announced its first cases in late December 2019 but travelers were allowed to come in from that country until mid-January after the first case was reported in Everett, Washington, on January 20. The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29, 2020. American diplomatic personal were evacuated the same day. A public health emergency and travel from China was restricted on January 31

In January 2020, following the death of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian government lashed out at Albania for hosting MEK members, and Iran has increased cyberattacks and agent hunting on Iranian dissidents against Albania. Saudi Arabia, in response, announced its support for Albania in its efforts against Iran. The rebel group Jaish ul-Adl, active in the Sistan and Baluchestan region of Iran, is accused by Iranian authorities of receiving Saudi and American support. The speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, stated that Saudi Arabia gave "strategic" intelligence information to Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. In May 2018, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman supported greater discussion between Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, stating "It's time for the Middle East to [...] have an axis of moderate countries," opposed to the network of Iranian allies and proxies. As of 2018, several sources described alleged intelligence ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel as a "covert alliance", with a joint interest to counter Iran in the region. The New York Times remarked that such cooperation was made more difficult by controversy over Israel's attitude towards Palestinians. Israel and Saudi Arabia are both part of the Middle East Air Defense Alliance (MEAD). The United States and Saudi Arabia have a strategic relationship that dates back to 1947. When the Iranian Revolution occurred, revolutionaries began to support other uprisings and rebellions throughout the Muslim world, including in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Iran used this policy to undermine their sovereignty while fighting in proxy warfare. This caused Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf allies to turn to the U.S. for support. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, and the GCC jointly backed Iraq under Saddam Hussein during the Iran–Iraq War and the U.S. and Iran directly attacked each other during the Tanker War. The U.S. and Iran again opened in mistrust during the Iraq War, with the U.S. and the GCC accusing Iran of funding and militarizing its proxies and Shia groups within Iraq. The highest point of mutual distrust happened in 2005 after details of Iran's nuclear program were leaked, and sanctions by the UN were put in place. The sanctions were put in place until 2015, when the JCPOA was implemented. Iran and U.S

. have also been embroiled in tensions due to the wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and disputes surrounding the Strait of Hormuz. In the 2011–2012 Strait of Hormuz dispute, Iran threatened to close Hormuz, however, was forced to back down after the EU placed sanctions. The U.S. and Iran were brought to the brink of war during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, when the U.S. assassinated Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, leaders of the Quds Force and the Popular Mobilization Forces, respectively. This was after the December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and the Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad, and Iran retaliated by bombing Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. U.S.-Saudi relations have deteriorated due to the Yemeni civil war and Syrian civil war. Saudi Arabia formerly supported the Al-Nusra Front, an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Saudi Arabia has also been involved in war crimes in Yemen due to civilian airstrikes and a humanitarian blockade. The U.S. supported the Saudi Arabian–led invasion until 2022, when Joe Biden repealed support for it and halted arm sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the attacks on the Saudi oil industry, on 14 September 2019, as an "act of war". President Donald Trump called for an increase in sanctions against Iran opposing the strikes. President Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran. Jordan has historically been on the Saudi bloc despite its slight rivalry. Jordan and Iran have sour relations with each other. Turkey has long seen Iran's expansions as threats but also perceived Saudi Arabia's influence with a similar reception, and is seeking to build itself as an alternative replacement to both Saudi and Iranian influences, to a degree. Historically, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey were part of the Western bloc. Turkey sided with Saudi Arabia throughout the conflicts in Syria and Yemen to contain against Iranian influence, however, both sides backed different groups. However, Turkey's growing military, political, and economic influence have caused some concern on Saudi circles with the start of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, when Turkey sided with Qatar

. Iran also considers Turkish military adventurism in Syria and its growing encounter against Iran in the Levant and Iraq as a challenge, not to mention its good relationship with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has antagonistic relations with Iran, and friendly relations with the Persian Gulf Arab states and Israel. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has also begun a systematic campaign to rewrite history, changing the Ottoman Empire into the occupier of Arabia; while it has also partially financed other megaprojects to counter the growing Turkish presence in Qatar, Sudan, Maghreb, Somalia, Kuwait, and Oman. Turkey was able to improve its relations with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the end of the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Erdoğan met with Mohammed bin Salman on June 2022 to boost their economic and political relations. Emirati-Turkish reconciliation in 2021, followed by Turkey's decision to move Khashoggi's case to the Saudi authorities and the mutual disdain of Biden administration to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey, paved a way for Saudi-Turkish reconciliation. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia supported Syrian opposition against Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey were among the first countries to welcome the new administration in Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. Turkey played a key role to ensure the new Syrian government would not pose any threats to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Turkey continued to strengthen their ties through cooperation and the mutual interest in both countries to contain Iran. Even though, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey maintains different strategic goals, both countries agree that limited cooperation is necessary for economic growth and regional stability. Qatar–Saudi Arabia relations have been strained since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Qatar has been a focus of controversy in the Saudi-Iranian rivalry due to Saudi Arabia's longstanding concern about the country's relationship with Iran and Iranian-backed militant groups. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Sudan, Senegal, Djibouti, Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government, and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and blocked their airspace and sea routes, in addition to Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing. The reasons cited were Qatar's relations with Iran, Al-Jazeera's coverage of other GCC states and Egypt, and Qatar's alleged support of Islamist groups. Qatar was also expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition

### 2024 Iran–Israel conflict
. Al Jazeera said the attack was significant given the conflict, and the Institute for the Study of War suggested the strikes were coordinated with Iran. Later, Iran and its proxies attacked Israel with about 300 drones and multiple ballistic missiles. The Houthis, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Badr Organization, and True Promise Corps also launched attacks on Israel under Iranian command. Syria shot down some Israeli interceptors. The United States, United Kingdom, and Jordan intercepted over 100 Iranian drones. The attack caused minor damage to Nevatim Airbase, which remained operational. A 7-year-old Israeli Bedouin child was critically injured by a missile shrapnel, and 31 other civilians suffered minor injuries while rushing to shelters or due to anxiety. Israeli and U.S. officials conducted situational assessments that night. The United States said it would not participate in a retaliatory strike on Iran. Iran threatened that if Israel were to retaliate, directly or indirectly, it would strike back harder. Israel said the attack warranted a response. The United States warned Israel to exercise restraint, and the Israeli war cabinet argued over the scale of Israel's response. Israel delayed plans to start an offensive in Rafah that week so it could determine a response. The war cabinet continued arguments over the Israeli response during the following week. The cabinet considered military and diplomatic options, with international pressure to de-escalate the situation influencing decisions. On 18 April, it was reported that the United States would greenlight a Rafah offensive in exchange for no Israeli strike on Iran. The U.S. and EU tightened sanctions on Iran. On the morning of 19 April, Israel retaliated against Iran. Israel attacked three targets in or near Isfahan International Airport, including a military base. One of the targets was a radar for the Natanz nuclear site. Iran claimed that its air defense shot down all Israeli projectiles and that the explosions were from air defense, but satellite images showed a damaged air defense battery and damage to the radar system. Israel did not comment or claim responsibility for any attack. In southern Syria, SAA bases were targeted, leading to material losses. Explosions and fighter jets were also heard in Iraq, and debris from an Israeli missile was found in central Iraq, suggesting Israel fired from there. Iranian state media downplayed the Israeli strike, and Iranian officials said there was no planned retaliation. An anonymous source told CNN that direct state-to-state strikes were over

. Analysts said the attack and Iranian reaction showed that both sides wanted to de-escalate. On 31 July, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander was assassinated in an Israeli strike on Haret Hreik, in the suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Iranian military adviser Milad Bedi and civilians were also killed in the strike. The strike was retaliation for the Majdal Shams attack, which killed twelve children, that Israel claimed Shukr had ordered. Later that day, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated along with his personal bodyguard in the Iranian capital Tehran by an apparent Israeli attack. Haniyeh was killed in his accommodation in a military-run guesthouse after attending the inauguration ceremony for Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. After the attacks, Iran and Hezbollah pledged retaliation. According to Israeli reports, retaliatory attacks are likely to be launched by multiple members of the Axis of Resistance, including in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as similarly done in the coordinated attack on Israel in April 2024. Many countries warned their citizens to leave Lebanon because of increasing war tensions. The U.S. State Department has been trying to prevent an attack by working through diplomats to send the message to Iran that escalation of the conflict is not in their best interests, and that the U.S. will defend Israel from attacks. Other U.S. officials stated that the successful shoot-down in April relied on good military intelligence about what Iran was planning, but this time the military situation is more uncertain. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei through Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia's security council, to have a restrained response, and not to attack Israeli civilians. The United States military announced the deployment of an additional squadron of F-22 Raptors from the 1st Operations Group of the 1st Fighter Wing; 4,000 marines and 12 ships were deployed to the region as a part of Carrier Strike Group 9 in the Persian Gulf and three Wasp-class amphibious assault ships, two destroyers and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit as a part of the USS Wasp amphibious ready group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea

. The Carrier Strike Group 3 including USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) and an unspecified number of cruisers and destroyers along with Carrier Air Wing Nine was also deployed, sent from the Pacific Ocean. On 5 August 2024, NOTAMs were issued to warn pilots regarding the closure or restriction of the airspace of Iran and Jordan, a precaution related to a possible attack by Iran against Israel. On 1 October 2024, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel in two waves. Iranian officials cited the recent assassinations of Hezbollah, Hamas, and IRGC leaders as justification. On 26 October 2024, Israel began attacking Iran, with explosions heard near Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mashhad, Karaj, Kermanshah, Zanjan. Explosions were also heard near Damascus, Syria. On 31 October 2024, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ordered his military officials to prepare for a military response against Israel, with Iranian officials warning that the response to Israel's strikes will be 'harsh' and 'unimaginable'. On the same day, Israeli intelligence suggested that Iran prepared to respond to Israel's attack from within Iraqi territory. The Axios reported that the attack would consist of a large number of drones and ballistic missiles launched from Iraqi territory. In November 2024, Israeli news outlets began reporting that Israel may target the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for its campaign against Israel during its wars on Gaza and on Lebanon. Unnamed officials allegedly told outlets that satellites monitored the transfer of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraqi territory. On 19 November, Israel issued a letter to the UN Security Council asserting its right to self-defense against the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for its military campaign on Israel during its wars on Gaza and Lebanon. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani warned that the letter served as pretext for an attack on Iraq, aligning with Israel's efforts to expand the war in the region. The Israeli security threat towards Iraq caused the Iraqi government to issue a statement that it would take all necessary diplomatic and military actions to protect its sovereignty. On 21 November, the Iraqi government requested an emergency session of the Arab League Council through the Iraqi Permanent Mission to the Arab League to address the Israeli threats against Iraq. The request highlighted Israel's threats in its letter to the UN Security Council, where it sought to expand its aggression in the region to Iraq

### Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war
Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a proxy war over influence in the Middle East and other regions of the Muslim world. The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria and Yemen; and disputes in Bahrain, Lebanon, Qatar, and Iraq. The struggle also extends to disputes or broader competition in other countries globally including in West, North and East Africa, South,[excessive citations] Central, Southeast Asia, the Balkans, and the Caucasus. In what has been described as a new cold war, the conflict is waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic, and sectarian influence in pursuit of regional hegemony. The rivalry has drawn comparisons to the dynamics of the Cold War era. As of 2017[update], the rivalry is primarily a political and economic struggle exacerbated by religious differences, and sectarianism in the region is exploited by both countries for geopolitical purposes as part of a larger conflict. Iran sees itself as the leading Shia Muslim power, while Saudi Arabia is the leading Wahhabi power (see Shia–Sunni relations). As of 10 March 2023[update], diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been restored due to Chinese-Iraqi brokered talks, which could have positive implications in the political climate of the Middle East. The deal was concluded after Iranian agreement to stop its military support for the Houthi militants in the Yemeni civil war.

The Arab–Iranian conflict is a term which is used in reference to the modern conflict between Arab League countries and Iran. In a broader sense, the term is also used in reference to the historical ethnic tensions which have existed for centuries between Arabs and Persians as well as the historical religious sectarian conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims, due to Saudi Arabia and post-revolutionary Iran seeing themselves as the champion leading states for Wahhabi and Shia Muslims, respectively. A noteworthy point in this conflict is that Iran has very positive relations with numerous Arab countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria and Tunisia. Qatar also has established close working relations with Tehran, despite their differences of opinion over the Syrian civil war, with Iran and Turkey two of the non-Arab countries to support Qatar against Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries in the Qatar diplomatic crisis which lasted for over two years

Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy war

. In this regard, the rivalry and tension is often seen as being between Iran and Persian Gulf Arab monarchies (all of which identify more with theocratic governance), such as the GCC states and their allies: namely Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Morocco. The biggest rivalry in the Arab–Iranian conflict is between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who have been waging a heavy proxy war against each other since the late 1970s. The proxy conflict can be traced back to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when the monarchic Imperial State of Iran became an Islamic republic. After the Islamic Revolution, the utilization of proxies became a key component of Iran's national security strategy and its initiatives in the region. The revolutionaries called for the overthrow of monarchies and secular governments to be replaced with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of the region's Sunni-run Arab monarchies Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the other Persian Gulf states, and Ba'athist Iraq (which was not a monarchy), most of whom were monarchies and all of whom had sizable Shia populations. Islamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia in 1979, Egypt and Bahrain in 1981, Syria in 1982, and Lebanon in 1983. Prior to the Iranian Revolution, the two countries constituted the Nixon Doctrine's "twin pillar" policy in the Middle East. The monarchies, particularly Iran since the Pahlavi-coup in 1953, were allied with the US to ensure stability in the Gulf region and act as a bulwark against Soviet influence during the Arab Cold War between Saudi Arabia and Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser. The alliance acted as a moderating influence on Saudi-Iranian relations. During this period Saudi Arabia styled itself as the leader of the Muslim world, basing its legitimacy in part on its control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. In 1962, it sponsored the inaugural General Islamic Conference in Mecca, at which a resolution was passed to create the Muslim World League. The organization is dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity under the Saudi purview, and has been successful in promoting Islam, particularly the conservative Wahhabi doctrine advocated by the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia also spearheaded the creation of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in 1969
