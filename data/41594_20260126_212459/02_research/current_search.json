Protests erupted in Iran on December 28, 2025\n2. US President Donald Trump threatened potential military intervention in support of protesters\n3. Unexpectedly, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and Oman rallied behind the Iranian regime\n\nGeopolitical Dynamics:\n- Saudi Arabia and Turkey were concerned about potential regime change in Iran\n- Both countries lobbied the Trump administration to avoid military action\n- Primary concerns included:\n  a) Potential rise of Reza Pahlavi (with strong Israeli connections)\n  b) Potential ethnic conflicts if regime collapses\n  c) Risk of regional instability\n\nEthnic Complexity:\n- Iran is a multi-ethnic country with significant minority populations\n- Potential regime collapse could trigger ethnic conflicts\n- Turkey especially worried about Kurdish movements\n- Saudi Arabia concerned about stability near critical export routes like Strait of Hormuz\n\nRegional Stance:\n- Most regional stakeholders (Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey) prefer maintaining geopolitical status quo\n- An emerging bloc of younger states (UAE, Israel, Azerbaijan) might challenge this approach\n\nConclusion:\nThe US president's decision to reduce military threats has so far preserved regional stability, but a significant military strike could dramatically reshape Middle Eastern geopolitics.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/strait-of-hormuz-back-in-focus-amid-possible-us-intervention-in-iran.html\">\nSummary of CNBC Article on Potential U.S. Action Against Iran:\n\nKey Facts and Statistics:\n1.
