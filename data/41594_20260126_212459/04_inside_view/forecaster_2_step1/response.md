- Deployed military assets
- Economic pressures
- Domestic political considerations
- Proxy conflict dynamics

Outside View Calibration:
- Aggregating source probabilities
- Considering expert assessments
- Accounting for historical intervention patterns
- Balancing escalation risks with diplomatic constraints

Calibration Methodology:
1. Long War Journal: ~40% conflict probability
2. AP News: ~30% intervention likelihood
3. Geopolitical expert assessments: Range 20-35%
4. Diplomatic constraint adjustments: -10-15%

Synthesis Considerations:
- Limited strike more probable than full-scale war
- Economic and diplomatic costs act as deterrents
- Specific triggering events could rapidly change calculus

Outside View Prediction:
27% probability of a United States attack on Iran before April 2026

Rationale: Balances military positioning, diplomatic tensions, and historical intervention patterns while accounting for significant de-escalation constraints.
