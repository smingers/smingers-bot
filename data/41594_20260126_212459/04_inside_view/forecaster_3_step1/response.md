(d) Justification:
Key Factors Influencing Prediction:

- Recent Israel-Iran conflict
- US military deployments
- Domestic political considerations
- Economic and strategic constraints

Outside View Calibration:
- Agent Report provides explicit probability ranges
- Limited strike exchange: 40%
- Large-scale air campaign: 20%
- Full regional war: ≤10%
- Triangulating these estimates and considering expert assessments

Calibration Considerations:
- Multiple sources suggest significant tension
- Diplomatic channels appear limited
- Military preparations ongoing
- Economic and political constraints exist

Outside View Prediction:
22% probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026

Rationale: 
- Reflects moderate-low likelihood of conflict
- Accounts for military preparations
- Considers diplomatic constraints
- Acknowledges potential for limited engagement
- Slightly lower than Agent Report's limited strike estimate due to additional diplomatic considerations
