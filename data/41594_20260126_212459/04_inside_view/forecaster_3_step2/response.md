(c) Timeframe Analysis:

- Double Timeframe (4 months): Increased complexity, potential diplomatic shifts

(d) Justification:
Key Shifting Factors:
1. Military Positioning: USS Abraham Lincoln deployment increases intervention readiness
2. Domestic Iranian Instability: 3,117 protest-related deaths create potential regime vulnerability
3. Previous Conflict Precedent: June 2025 Israel-Iran conflict establishes recent intervention template
4. Regional Diplomatic Constraints: Most regional powers prefer status quo

Probability Calibration:
- Outside View Base Rate: 27%
- Adjustments:
  * Military Positioning: +7%

4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier group deployment
