(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential Reference Classes:

2. US-Iran Confrontations (1979-2024)
3. Regional Proxy Conflicts
4. Nuclear Proliferation Scenarios

Most Suitable Reference Class: US Middle East Interventions
- Provides historical precedent for military engagement
- Accounts for geopolitical complexities
- Includes diplomatic and military escalation patterns

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 2 months (Jan 26, 2026 to April 2026)
- Historical Pattern: US interventions typically follow:
  * Escalating diplomatic tensions
  * Proxy provocations
  * Perceived threat to national interests
  * Short-duration, precision-targeted operations

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Influencing Prediction:
- Ongoing nuclear tensions
- Recent Israel-Iran conflict (June 2025)
- US military positioning
- Domestic political pressures
- Economic and strategic considerations

Outside View Calibration:
- Agent report provides probability estimates:
  * Limited strike exchange: 40%
  * Large-scale air campaign: 20%
  * Full-scale regional war: ≤10%

Calibration Considerations:
- Multiple sources suggest high tension but diplomatic restraint
- Economic and geopolitical costs of full-scale conflict
- Preference for limited, precision-targeted actions

Outside View Prediction:
27% probability of a US military strike against Iran before April 2026

Rationale:
- Reflects high tensions
- Accounts for diplomatic constraints
- Aligns with historical intervention patterns
- Considers economic and geopolitical risks of full-scale conflict

The prediction is deliberately conservative, recognizing the complex and volatile nature of US-Iran relations while acknowledging the potential for limited military action.
