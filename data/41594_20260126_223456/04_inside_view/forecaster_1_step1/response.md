Calibration Approach:
- Base rate of Middle East interventions
- Subtract probability of diplomatic resolution
- Add probability of significant provocation

Outside View Prediction:
17% probability of United States attacking Iran before April 2026

Rationale:
- Significant military positioning suggests tension
- Low probability due to strategic complexities
- Diplomatic channels still partially open
- Potential for miscalculation exists
- Trump administration's unpredictability
- Strong deterrence factors present

The prediction reflects a nuanced assessment of current geopolitical dynamics, recognizing both escalation potential and strategic restraint.
