- Short Timeframe Considerations:
  * Rapid military escalation less likely
  * Diplomatic channels still open
  * Logistical challenges of immediate intervention

Potential Timeframe Shift Impact:
- If timeframe halved: Probability would decrease to ~10%
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase to ~25%

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Significant military positioning
2. High regional tensions
3. Limited diplomatic options
4. Potential Iranian nuclear advancement
5. Proxy group instability

Calibration Considerations:
- Military preparedness suggests potential for action
- Diplomatic constraints reduce immediate intervention likelihood
- Complex geopolitical landscape favors measured response

Probability calibration:
- Adjusted from initial 17% outside view
- Considered current military positioning
- Weighed diplomatic constraints
- Evaluated potential escalation risks

Checklist:
1. Question: Will US militarily attack Iran before April 2026? Specific criteria not fully detailed.
2. Base rate: Originally 17%, adjusted based on current evidence
3. Consistency: 20 out of 100 times, US would attack Iran
4. Key Evidence:
