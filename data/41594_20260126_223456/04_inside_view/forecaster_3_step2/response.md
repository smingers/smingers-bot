- Heightened tensions from 2025 Israel-Iran conflict
- Domestic Iranian protests creating instability

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative media discussions about potential conflict
- General rhetorical threats from Iranian officials

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 2 months (until April 2026)
- If timeframe halved (1 month): Probability might decrease to 10-12%
- If timeframe doubled (4 months): Probability might increase to 22-25%

(d) Justification Factors:
1. Deterrence Considerations
- US maintains flexible military positioning
- Diplomatic channels still open
- High potential for uncontrolled escalation

2. Constraining Factors
- Regional states unwilling to provide airspace
- Significant diplomatic and economic costs
- Low public support for intervention

Probability calibration:
- Outside view base rate: 17%
- Current evidence suggests maintaining similar probability
- Slight adjustment for specific military positioning

Checklist:
1. Question: Will US attack Iran before April 2026? Binary outcome within specified timeframe.
2. Base rate consistent: 17% maintained
3. 17/100 times, US attacks Iran before April 2026 - logically consistent
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier strike group deployment
   - Iranian proxy tensions
   - Regional diplomatic constraints
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected major provocation triggering immediate conflict
6. Status Quo: Diplomatic tension without direct military engagement

Probability: 16%
