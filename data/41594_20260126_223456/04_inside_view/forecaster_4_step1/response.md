Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. PBS News Article: High-quality, recent source providing detailed context about current tensions. Factual information includes military positioning, specific statements from Iranian and US officials. Expert opinions are limited but contextually relevant.

2. The Guardian Article: Reputable news source. Provides specific details about military posturing and provocative messaging. Contains factual information about carrier deployment and official statements.

3. Caspian Post Analysis: Appears to be a specialized geopolitical analysis source. Provides structured, nuanced assessment of carrier deployment. Includes objective military capabilities and strategic context.

4. Guardian Article on Israel-Iran War: Academic and expert-sourced analysis. Highlights strategic complexities and potential limitations of military intervention. Contains expert quotes from respected academics and policy experts.

5. The Week Article: More speculative, less rigorous source. Contains some expert quotes but also includes more sensationalist language about potential conflict.

6. Brandeis University Article: High-credibility academic source. Provides structured geopolitical analysis from a Middle East economics expert.

(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential reference classes:
- US military interventions in Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan)
- US-Iran military tensions since 1979
- Regional proxy conflicts
- US responses to Iranian provocations

Most suitable reference class: US responses to Iranian provocations, considering historical pattern of measured responses and diplomatic pressure.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction timeframe: 2 months (January 26, 2026 to April 2026)
- Historical pattern: US typically avoids direct military confrontation without substantial provocation
- Current tensions high but not at immediate breaking point

(d) Justification:
Key factors against immediate attack:
- Low public support for intervention
- Complex geopolitical consequences
- Potential for significant regional destabilization
- Diplomatic alternatives still available

Key factors potentially supporting attack:
- Ongoing Iranian protest suppression
- Provocative Iranian military positioning
- Trump administration's aggressive rhetoric
- Carrier group deployment signaling readiness

Outside view calibration:
- Sources suggest high tension but low probability of direct conflict
- Expert opinions lean towards diplomatic pressure over military action
- Significant uncertainty exists
- Need to balance provocative rhetoric with strategic restraint

Considerations:
- Precise military intervention probability difficult to quantify
- Experts consistently highlight risks of escalation
- No clear consensus on immediate military action

Outside View Prediction:
7% probability of United States attacking Iran before April 2026

Rationale: While tensions are high, the strategic, diplomatic, and military complexities suggest a low probability of direct military intervention. The prediction accounts for provocative positioning, but recognizes the significant barriers to outright conflict.

The 7% reflects:
- Ongoing diplomatic channels
- High potential for unintended escalation
- Lack of overwhelming strategic imperative
- Expert skepticism about intervention effectiveness
