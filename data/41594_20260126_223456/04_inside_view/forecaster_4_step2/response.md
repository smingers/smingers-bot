Moderate Evidence:
- Iranian proxy groups issuing threats
- US considering precision strikes
- Regional states' reluctance to support direct conflict

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative statements about potential escalation
- Media rhetoric about potential conflict

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 2 months (Jan 26, 2026 to April 2026)
- Short timeframe increases uncertainty
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might slightly increase due to potential escalation

(d) Justification:
Key Deterrence Factors:
- Regional states blocking airspace
- Diplomatic channels still open
- High risk of uncontrolled escalation
- Lack of clear strategic advantage for US

Escalation Factors:
- Ongoing Iranian domestic suppression
- Provocative military positioning
- Trump administration's aggressive rhetoric

Probability calibration:
Adjusting from outside view base rate of 5%:
- Carrier deployment: +3%
- Proxy group tensions: +2%
- Diplomatic constraints: -3%

Checklist:
1. Question: Will US attack Iran before April 2026? Specific military intervention criteria.
2. Base rate maintained with minor adjustments
3. 7/100 times, US would attack Iran (consistent with analysis)
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier group deployment
   - Ongoing regional tensions
   - Diplomatic constraints
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected major provocation or incident
6. Status Quo: Diplomatic tension without direct conflict

Probability: 7%
