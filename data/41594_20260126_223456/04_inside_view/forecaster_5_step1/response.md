(b) Reference Class Analysis:

2. US-Iran Conflict Escalation Scenarios
3. Historical Tensions with Rogue States

Most Suitable Reference Class: US-Iran Conflict Escalation Scenarios

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current timeframe: January 26, 2026
- Prediction window: Until April 2026 (approximately 2.5 months)
- Recent historical context: 
  * June 2025: Israeli-Iranian 12-day conflict
  * Ongoing tensions from Iranian protests
  * Increasing military posturing

(d) Justification Factors:
1. Military Positioning:
- USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group deployed
- Increased military assets in the region
- Provocative messaging from both sides

2. Diplomatic Tensions:
- Ongoing protests in Iran
- Weakened "Axis of Resistance"
- Potential for diplomatic miscalculation

3. Strategic Considerations:
- Trump administration's aggressive stance
- Low public support for full-scale intervention
- Risks of broader regional conflict

Outside View Calibration:
- Considering the sources and context, the probability seems low but not negligible
- Expert sources suggest high risk of miscalculation
- Direct confrontation appears unlikely without significant provocation
- Military posturing suggests deterrence rather than immediate conflict

Calibration Factors:
- Experts skeptical of strategic effectiveness of military action
- Diplomatic channels still partially open
- High potential cost of direct conflict

Outside View Prediction:
17% probability of a US attack on Iran before April 2026

Rationale: The prediction reflects the complex geopolitical landscape, high-tension environment, and strategic considerations that make an outright attack unlikely but not impossible. The 17% accounts for potential miscalculation, provocative incidents, or unexpected escalation while recognizing the significant barriers to direct military intervention.
