Ali Larijani (secretary of Iran's Supreme Council for National Security)\n  - Four regional commanders of Iran's Law Enforcement Forces and Revolutionary Guard\n- **Trade Measures**: Trump instituted a 25% tariff on products from countries continuing to trade with Iran (aimed at China buying Iranian oil)\n\n## Internal U.S. Deliberations:\n\nAccording to sources familiar with administration discussions:\n- Trump wanted any potential military action to deliver a swift and decisive blow without sparking sustained war lasting weeks or months\n- Trump's aides assessed that the regime would not quickly collapse after an American military strike\n- Experts have long argued that air or missile strikes would not cause regime collapse; achieving that would require U.S. ground forces\n- Deploying ground forces has been repeatedly ruled out and would likely require Congressional authorization (not expected to be forthcoming)\n- U.S. officials judged they did not have all necessary assets in the region to guard against expected Iranian retaliation\n\n## Assessment of Iranian Regime Weakness:\n\nThe Trump administration's assessment is that the regime has been weakened by:\n- Defeat of its regional allies\n- Economic deterioration\n- U.S. and Israeli strikes on strategic facilities in June\n\n## Regional Allies' Opposition:\n\n**Israel** (per The New York Times reporting):\n- Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Trump to \"postpone\" striking Iran\n- Netanyahu reportedly supports U.S. action in principle but wanted time to position missile defense assets\n- Israeli officials would prefer a full-throated U.S. attack rather than targeted decapitation strikes\n- Iran warned it would strike Israel and U.S. bases if attacked\n\n**Arab Gulf States** (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt):\n- Coordinated diplomatic effort to persuade Trump to cancel (not postpone) a strike\n- One Saudi official (speaking on background): \"We told Washington that an attack on Iran would open the way for a series of grave blowbacks in the region\"\n- Concerns included:\n  - Iranian retaliation against military and energy facilities in their countries\n  - Iran possesses thousands of short-range ballistic missiles\n  - Potential for getting caught in crossfire between Iran and Israel\n  - Risk that regime collapse could produce an unpredictable/aggressive successor government or failed state\n  - Weapons caches could be captured by terrorist groups (Libya comparison cited)\n\n**Note**: The article appears to end mid-sentence regarding the UAE's position, suggesting the extracted content may be incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.inss.org.il/publication/iran-usa-protests/\">\n# Summary of INSS Article on US-Iran Intervention Scenarios\n\n**Key Context and Timeline:**\n- Article dated January 19, 2026\n- Discusses unrest in Iran that began three weeks prior (late December 2025)\n- The protests started among bazaar merchants in Tehran and have spread to all 31 provinces of Iran\n- Thousands have been killed and thousands more arrested in regime crackdown\n\n**Facts and Developments:**\n\n1. **Presidential Statements and Threats:**\n   -

Gen. Eyal Zamir (Israeli army chief, late December 2025):**\nWarned that \"Iran is the one that financed and armed the ring of strangulation around Israel and stood behind the plans for its destruction,\" adding Israel will strike back \"wherever required, on near and distant fronts alike.\"\n\n**Former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (early December 2025):**\nRemarked that \"The skies over Iran have become completely safe for the enemy\" regarding Iran's degraded air defenses.\n\n**President Donald Trump (after meeting with Netanyahu):**\nThreatened to \"knock the hell out of\" Iran if it restarted its nuclear program.\n\n**Netanyahu's office:**\nCalled Lebanese government efforts to disarm Hezbollah an \"encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient.\"\n\n## Article Analysis (RAND):\n\nThe article argues that the current d\u00e9tente is tactical rather than strategic, driven by:\n- Israel's depleted interceptor stockpiles\n- Fewer U.S. military assets in the region currently\n- More immediate Hezbollah threat requiring attention\n- General skepticism about whether airstrikes would collapse Iranian regime during protests\n\nThe article predicts the pause is unlikely to last because:\n- Israel is rebuilding military capabilities\n- Iran continues nuclear ambitions with possible Russian support\n- Iran is reconstituting military capabilities with Chinese and Russian assistance\n- 2026 is an Israeli election year where Netanyahu needs to demonstrate security credentials\n- Israel's post-October 7, 2023 strategic mindset favors preemption over deterrence\n- Israel has operational incentive to strike while Iran's air defenses remain degraded\n\n**Note:** Article appears to be cut off mid-sentence at the end.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/26/us-military-presence-iran/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n- The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three destroyers have arrived in the Middle East as of January 26, 2026\n- The strike group is currently in the Indian Ocean, not the Arabian Sea (which borders Iran)\n- The Middle East has not had a U.S. aircraft carrier since USS Gerald R.

anti-government protests\n- Trump has recently backed away from immediate threats but has not ruled out an attack on Iran\n- US media reports indicate Trump is weighing multiple military options

\"very high\"\n- Described the military buildup in the Persian Gulf as \"overtly aggressive\"\n- Stated the deployment sends a message to Iran: \"we're ready, our capabilities are in place\"\n-

followed by stealth bombers and fighter jets striking command centers and missile sites\n- Said even if Washington resorts to a largely symbolic strike, Iran is likely to respond in kind\n\n**Mehrdad

ballistic missiles that could hit regional bases\n- Tehran has vowed to hit US bases in the Persian Gulf as well as Israel\n- A ground invasion of Iran (the largest and most populous country in the Middle East) is considered a nonstarter by many military experts\n- Regional countries have privately urged Washington to exercise restraint, concerned about triggering a wider conflict\n\n###

Iran's nuclear sites\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/26/iran-tehran-mural-warns-us-against-military-strike\">\n# Summary of Guardian Article: \"You will
