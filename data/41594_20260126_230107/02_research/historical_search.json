U.S.\u2013IRAN MILITARY CONFRONTATIONS, 1979-2022  \nThe list interweaves direct clashes with proxy episodes in which Washington judged Tehran legally or operationally responsible.\n\n1. Nov 1979\u2013Jan 1981 \u2013 U.S. Embassy seizure, Tehran  \n   Trigger: radical students retaliated for the Shah\u2019s admission to the U.S.  \n   U.S. decision-makers (Carter, then Reagan) chose economic sanctions, a failed rescue attempt (Apr 1980, Operation Eagle Claw), and finally an Algerian-brokered deal.  \n   Outcome: 52 hostages freed; diplomatic ties severed and never restored. (CNN timeline; UANI)\n\n2. 1982-1991 \u2013 Hezbollah hostage-taking & bombings in Lebanon (U.S. Embassy April 1983; Marine Barracks Oct 1983; multiple kidnappings)  \n   Trigger: U.S. peacekeeping presence; Iranian support for Shia militias.  \n   U.S. rationale (Reagan/Bush 41): protect forces and maritime traffic while avoiding a ground war with Iran; limited naval gunfire and withdrawal from Beirut.  \n   Outcome: 258 U.S. personnel killed; Hezbollah entrenched. (UANI)\n\n3. 1987-1988 \u2013 \u201cTanker War,\u201d Operation Earnest Will & Operation Praying Mantis  \n   Trigger: Iran mining Persian Gulf and firing on re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers amid the Iran-Iraq War.  \n   U.S. rationale (Reagan): preserve freedom of navigation and global oil flow.  \n   Outcome: largest U.S. surface naval battle since WWII; Iranian navy suffered heavy losses; no wider war. (UANI)\n\n4. July 1988 \u2013 Shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655 by USS Vincennes  \n   Trigger: Mistaken identity during high-tempo Gulf operations.  \n   U.S. called it accident; Tehran called it massacre.  \n   Outcome: 290 civilians killed; still a grievance in Iranian narrative. (CNN)\n\n5. 1996 \u2013 Khobar Towers truck-bombing, Saudi Arabia  \n   Trigger: Presence of U.S. airmen enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq; attack carried out by Saudi Hizbollah with IRGC support.  \n   U.S. (Clinton) refrained from strike; opted for indictments and covert pressure.  \n   Outcome: 19 Americans killed; event cited later to justify terror designation of IRGC. (UANI)\n\n6. 2003-2011 \u2013 Iraq War \u201cproxy hot war\u201d  \n   Trigger: U.S. invasion of Iraq; Iran saw need to bleed U.S. and shape post-Saddam order.  \n   U.S. (Bush 43/Obama) accused IRGC-Qods Force of supplying explosively formed penetrators that killed >600 U.S. troops.  \n   Outcome: Dozens of militia\u2013U.S. firefights; no direct U.S. strike on Iranian soil. (UANI)\n\n7. Jan 2016 \u2013 U.S. detains IRGC sailors after navigation error in Gulf; quick diplomatic resolution under JCPOA framework. (generic, covered in CNN chronology)\n\n8. May 2019\u2013Jan 2020 \u2013 Maximum-Pressure period  \n   \u2022  June 2019: Iran shoots down U.S. RQ-4 drone; President Trump approves strikes, then aborts.  \n   \u2022  Dec 2019: Kataib Hizbollah rocket attack kills a U.S. contractor; U.S. airstrikes on militia bases.  \n   \u2022  3 Jan 2020: U.S. drone strike kills Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad airport.  \n   Rationale (Trump term 1): re-establish deterrence.  \n   Outcome: Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile barrage on Ayn al-Asad base injured 100+ U.S. personnel; informal deterrence reset but proxy attacks resumed later. (CNN; CFR tracker)\n\n9. Oct 2023-Aug 2024 \u2013 Post-Hamas War proxy surge  \n   Trigger: Hamas 7 Oct 2023 assault on Israel.  \n   Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) carried out >180 rocket/drone strikes on U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Jordan; killed 3 U.S. soldiers (Jan 2024).  \n   U.S. responses: limited strikes on IRGC facilities in Syria/Iraq (Oct 26 2023; Feb 2 2024).

Truce largely holds but proxy environment remains volatile.

Analysts note political-will constraints and fear of regional conflagration. (AP; Iran International; BBC 12 Jan 2026)\n\nIV.  EXPERT ASSESSMENTS OF U.S. STRIKE PROBABILITY, 2023-APR 2026  \n\u2022  Prior to the June 2025 strikes, most think-tank assessments put likelihood of U.S. attack <25 % absent Iranian move toward weaponization. That changed after Israel\u2019s June 2025 raid, which \u201cpulled\u201d the U.S. in.  \n\u2022  Brookings post-mortem (24 Jun 2025) judges that Washington may strike again if Iran resumes enrichment or mass-casualty proxy attacks, but \u201cmilitary means alone cannot ensure a positive outcome,\u201d implying restraint.  \n\u2022  RAND commentary (Jan 2026) argues d\u00e9tente with Israel \u201cwon\u2019t last,\u201d but also stresses U.S. aversion to getting \u201cbogged down\u201d again; probability of another large-scale U.S. strike before Apr 2026 deemed moderate (roughly one-third) and conditional on (a) mass protest killings, (b) rapid nuclear rebuild, or (c) strikes on U.S. personnel.  \n\u2022  Media analyses (AP, Iran International) highlight signaling\u2014carrier, high-level visits\u2014yet underline domestic poll fatigue with wars and Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica-First\u201d doctrine, keeping odds below 50 %.  \n\nV.  KEY ESCALATION INDICATORS, 2023-2026  \n1.  Rate and lethality of proxy militia attacks on U.S. troops and shipping (Long War Journal; AP).  \n2.  IAEA inspection reports & Iranian enrichment milestones (CFR; Brookings).  \n3.  Israeli unilateral actions, which have twice forced Washington\u2019s hand (CFR).  \n4.  Scale of repression inside Iran\u2014death tolls, executions (BBC; Iran International).  \n5.  U.S. naval deployments and public red-line statements (AP; Iran International).  \n\nVI.  OUTCOMES AND STRATEGIC EFFECTS SO FAR  \n\u2022  Iran\u2019s nuclear timetable delayed months, not years; inspectors\u2019 access now severely limited (Brookings).  \n\u2022  Tehran\u2019s \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d weakened after Israeli blows to Hamas, Hezbollah, militias; hesitancy evident in 2025-26 crises (AP).  \n\u2022  U.S.\u2013Gulf allies support new Trump negotiations, hoping to avoid region-wide war (NY Times 20 Apr 2025).  \n\u2022  Russia & China rhetorically back Iran but decline material aid, illustrating limits of anti-U.S. axis (TIME 23 Jun 2025).  \n\nVII.  INFORMATION GAPS  \nA.  Quantitative casualty tallies for some 1980-2003 proxy events differ across sources; official DoD figures could refine.  \nB.  Precise U.S. rules of engagement governing 2026 carrier group not publicly available.  \nC.  Up-to-date IAEA verification status post-June 2025 attack not in open press after mid-2025.  \nD.
