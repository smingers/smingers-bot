Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**The Soufan Center (January 23, 2026):**
High-quality intelligence analysis organization. Reports factual events (uprising beginning December 28, protests across 31 provinces, IRGC deployment, internet blackout) with specific dates and details. Contains identifiable expert opinions from administration sources regarding Trump's deliberations. Key factual claims: Trump threatened intervention, then appeared to backtrack; military assets continue moving to region; regional allies (Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Egypt) actively lobbied against strikes. The article distinguishes between factual events and assessments from "sources familiar with administration discussions."

**INSS Israel (January 19, 2026):**
Israeli national security think tank with direct regional insight. Provides specific timeline (protests began three weeks prior to January 19, i.e., late December). Factual elements: Trump's tweets on January 13 and January 2, 25% tariff announcement, suspension of US-Iran negotiations. Author Avishay Ben Sasson-Gordis provides analysis but the article appears incomplete, cutting off before completing the "overall likelihood" assessment. Quality is good for factual reporting but incomplete for predictive assessment.

**RAND Corporation (January 26, 2026):**
Highly credible policy research organization. Provides specific statistics (33 killed, 3,500+ wounded, $1.5B damage from June 2025 war; ~4,000 Hezbollah operatives killed; $1B to Hezbollah in 2025). Contains identifiable quotes from Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, Hassan Rouhani, Trump, and Netanyahu's office. The analysis argues current détente is tactical, not strategic. This represents expert institutional analysis rather than mere opinion.

**Denver Post (January 26, 2026):**
Mainstream news outlet reporting factual military movements: USS Abraham Lincoln arrival, F-15 deployment, cargo planes observed. Cites US Central Command official statement and direct Trump quotes. Provides specific casualty figures from activists (5,973 killed, 41,800 detained) versus official Iranian figures (3,117 dead). Quality is good for factual reporting of observable events.

**Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (January 26, 2026):**
US government-funded but editorially independent news service. Reports same military deployments as Denver Post. Contains identifiable expert opinions: Farzin Nadimi (Washington Institute) assesses chances as "very high" and describes buildup as "overtly aggressive"; Mehrdad Khansari (former Iranian diplomat) warns of unpredictable costs. These are named experts with relevant credentials providing specific assessments.

**The Guardian (January 26, 2026):**
Major international newspaper. Reports observable facts: mural unveiled January 26, Revolutionary Guard commander statement Saturday, USS Abraham Lincoln movement, UK Typhoon deployment Thursday. Contains direct Trump quotes and Iranian prosecutor response. Quality is good for factual event reporting.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Military deployment is factually confirmed across multiple independent sources** (Soufan Center, Denver Post, RFE/RL, Guardian all report USS Abraham Lincoln, F-15s, and destroyer deployments as of January 26, 2026). This represents observable, verifiable military positioning.
2. **Regional allies actively opposed strikes** - Multiple independent sources (Soufan Center citing NYT reporting on Netanyahu; Saudi, Qatar, Oman, Egypt coordination) confirm diplomatic pressure against military action. This represents structural constraint on US action.
3. **Trump's own statements show escalation then de-escalation pattern** - Direct quotes across multiple sources show initial threats ("locked and loaded," "help is on the way") followed by hedging ("just in case," "maybe we won't have to use it"). This demonstrates ambivalence at decision-maker level.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Expert assessment from Farzin Nadimi (Washington Institute)** - Single identified expert with relevant credentials assesses probability as "very high," describing buildup as "overtly aggressive." However, this is one expert's opinion, not consensus.
2. **Iranian protests have been suppressed** - Multiple sources report the uprising has been crushed (Soufan Center quotes Iranian prosecutor "sedition is now over"; Denver Post reports no protests for days). This removes the immediate trigger Trump cited for intervention.
3. **Historical precedent from June 2025** - RFE/RL notes similar military buildup preceded actual strikes last year, suggesting current movements could presage action.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Iranian mural and Revolutionary Guard rhetoric** - Guardian reports propaganda displays and "finger on the trigger" statements. These are standard posturing, not reliable indicators of US decision-making.
2. **Speculation about Trump's domestic political motivations** - RAND mentions 2026 Israeli election year and Netanyahu's need to demonstrate security credentials, but this is indirect and speculative regarding US actions.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

The prediction window is approximately 63 days (January 27 to April 1, 2026). This is a short timeframe where:

- **If halved to ~31 days (end of February):** Probability would decrease to ~20-25%. The military assets are just arriving (as of January 26), and the immediate protest trigger has subsided. A strike within one month would require a new acute provocation.

- **If doubled to ~126 days (end of May):** Probability would increase to ~45-50%. A longer window allows more opportunities for triggering events (renewed protests, Iranian retaliation for June 2025 strikes, nuclear program advances, attacks on US forces or allies).

The current 2-month window represents a "medium-short" timeframe where military assets are positioned but the immediate crisis has cooled. Historical patterns show US strikes often follow acute provocations within days-to-weeks, not months of slow build.

**(d) Justification:**

**Factors increasing probability from outside view baseline (34.7%):**

1. **Unprecedented military positioning:** The deployment of carrier strike group, F-15s, and ongoing military exercises represents the most significant US military buildup in the region since the June 2025 strikes. Multiple sources confirm this is not routine positioning. This is a structural factor that increases strike capability and readiness. (+8-10%)

2. **Trump's established willingness to strike Iran:** The June 2025 nuclear site strikes demonstrate Trump has already crossed the threshold of attacking Iran directly (not just proxies). This precedent lowers the psychological/political barrier to future strikes. (+5-7%)

3. **Expert assessment of "very high" likelihood:** Farzin Nadimi, a credible regional military expert, explicitly assesses current strike probability as "very high" based on the "overtly aggressive" buildup. While one expert, his assessment carries weight given his credentials. (+3-5%)

**Factors decreasing probability from outside view baseline:**

1. **Regional allies successfully lobbied against strikes:** The Soufan Center reports that Netanyahu asked to "postpone" (implying acceptance in principle but not now) while Arab Gulf states asked to "cancel" strikes. This represents significant structural constraint—Trump faces allied opposition, not support. The administration's own assessment (per Soufan Center) concluded they lacked all necessary assets to guard against retaliation. (-5-7%)

2. **Immediate trigger (protests) has been suppressed:** Trump's stated red lines were mass executions and killing peaceful protesters. Iranian sources claim the uprising is "over," and multiple sources report no recent protests. Without the triggering event, Trump's justification weakens. (-8-10%)

3. **Administration's own assessment of inadequate positioning:** Soufan Center reports US officials judged they "did not have all necessary assets in the region to guard against expected Iranian retaliation." This suggests the current buildup is incomplete for the administration's own requirements. (-3-5%)

4. **Trump's hedging language:** His recent statements ("just in case," "maybe we won't have to use it") represent significant de-escalation from earlier rhetoric. This suggests internal deliberation has moved away from immediate action. (-5-7%)

**Net adjustment:** The factors roughly balance, with constraints (allied opposition, suppressed protests, incomplete positioning, hedging language) slightly outweighing enablers (military buildup, precedent, expert assessment). The current situation differs from the outside view reference class in that:
- Military assets are more explicitly positioned than in typical "tense but no action" periods
- But regional allies are more explicitly opposed than in the June 2025 strike scenario
- The immediate triggering crisis has cooled rather than escalated

This suggests a modest upward adjustment from the 34.7% baseline, but not a dramatic shift.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view baseline: 34.7%

Adjustments:
- Military buildup and readiness: +8%
- Established precedent of striking Iran: +6%
- Expert assessment: +4%
- Regional allied opposition: -6%
- Suppressed protests (removed trigger): -9%
- Incomplete asset positioning per US assessment: -4%
- Trump's hedging language: -6%

Net adjustment: -7%

**Calibrated probability: 28%**

This represents roughly 1-in-3.5 odds. The reasoning: While military assets are positioned and Trump has demonstrated willingness to strike, the immediate crisis has cooled, regional allies oppose action, and Trump's own statements suggest ambivalence. The 28% probability accounts for the possibility of a new triggering event (renewed protests, Iranian attack on US forces/allies, nuclear program advancement) within the 63-day window that could rapidly change the calculus, but assigns this scenario less than even odds.

A 10% shift upward (to 38%) would imply the military buildup is more determinative than allied opposition—possible but not supported by the evidence showing Trump backed down under allied pressure. A 10% shift downward (to 18%) would imply the military buildup is mere posturing—contradicted by the scale and expert assessments of its aggressive nature.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will US conduct military attack on Iran between now (Jan 27, 2026) and April 1, 2026? (63-day window)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 34.7% based on historical US-Iran escalation patterns in similar 3-month windows during heightened tension periods.

3. **Consistency check:** "28 out of 100 times in situations with significant military buildup but cooled immediate crisis and allied opposition, the US attacks Iran within 2 months." This aligns with my justification that the situation is elevated but constrained.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group and F-15s deployed to region as of Jan 26 (factual, multiple sources)
   - Regional allies (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Gulf states) actively lobbied Trump against strikes (factual, Soufan Center)
   - Iranian protests suppressed, removing Trump's stated trigger (factual, multiple sources)
   - Trump's language shifted from "locked and loaded" to "just in case, maybe we won't" (factual, direct quotes)
   - Expert Farzin Nadimi assesses strike likelihood as "very high" (identifiable expert opinion)

5. **Blind spot:** A rapid new triggering event (Iranian attack on US forces, attempted mass executions, major nuclear program announcement) could make 28% look far too low. Such events historically precipitate US action within days. However, assigning higher probability would require assuming such an event is more likely than not within 63 days, which the evidence doesn't support.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo over the past 2 weeks has been "military buildup without action." Given the short 63-day timeframe and recent cooling of immediate crisis, a slight bias toward continuation of this status quo is appropriate, supporting the modest probability rather than a >50% forecast.

**Probability: 28%**
