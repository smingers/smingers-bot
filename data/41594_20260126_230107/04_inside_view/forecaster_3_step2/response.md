Analysis:
(a) Source analysis:
• The Soufan Center (Jan 23, 2026): Reports on Iran’s uprising and subsequent repression, including Trump’s earlier military threat. It mixes hard news (protests, deployment of forces) with US political rhetoric. Quality is moderate to high for recent events but opinion elements (e.g., assessment of regime weakness) must be distinguished.
• INSS (Jan 19, 2026): Details the escalation of protests, Trump’s tweets about “locked and loaded,” and outlines Iran’s strategic and economic vulnerabilities. It contains both factual reports (protest spread, casualty counts) and interpretative comments on US intent. Source quality is moderate.
• RAND (Jan 26, 2026): Provides a strategic overview of regional military capabilities and outlines reasons why direct U.S. airstrikes are unlikely (limited by depleted US assets, risk of broader conflict, and a history of restraint). This source is valuable for its expert assessments.
• The Denver Post (Jan 26, 2026): Reports on the US carrier group’s movements and the “just in case” language by Trump. It provides solid, verifiable details about US military deployments, with factual information on assets already in transit.
• RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty (Jan 26, 2026): Highlights multiple US military deployments, exercises, and expert opinions (e.g., Farzin Nadimi’s “very high” likelihood statement) while also noting Iran’s capacity for retaliation. Though alarmist in tone, its factual reporting of force movements is reliable.
• The Guardian (Jan 26, 2026): Reports on the symbolic Tehran mural and quotes from US and Iranian officials. The mural is propaganda but confirms the high tension environment.
Each source blends factual details (dates, military deployments, numbers) with opinion calls about risk. I give more weight to those with identifiable experts and robust military reporting while being cautious about rhetoric.

(b) Evidence analysis:
• Strong evidence: The historical record (over 45 years) shows zero direct US attacks on Iranian territory; institutional and strategic priorities (Congressional authorization, risk of escalation, alternative tools like sanctions and cyber) consistently favor restraint.
• Moderate evidence: Recent troop and carrier deployments—while increasing the possibility of some form of kinetic action—are couched as contingency measures (“just in case”) and do not on their own signal an imminent full attack.
• Weak evidence: Statements and propaganda (e.g., Tehran mural, “locked and loaded” tweets) serve mostly to warn or posture and do not establish a clear causal mechanism for a full US attack.
The balance of evidence supports that despite rising tensions and provocative rhetoric, structural institutional factors and historical patterns make a direct strike highly unlikely.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
The prediction period is roughly 93 days (from January 27, 2026, to the end of April 2026). If the timeframe were halved (about 1.5 months), the probability would be even lower due to the short window for decision-making and deployment adjustments. If doubled, there might be a modest increase in the chance, but the fundamental historical restraint and strategic costs would still keep the probability in a very low range.

(d) Justification:
Adjusting the historical base rate – essentially 0% per year for direct US attacks on Iran – current conditions (nuclear proliferation pressures, regional instability, and elevated military posture) could nominally push the probability upward. However, the constraints (risk of escalation, Congressional hurdles, and reliance on alternatives to direct kinetic action) strongly favor maintaining most of the base rate. Consequently, the net adjustment is modest, supporting a final estimate around 3% for an attack before April 2026.

Probability calibration
Based on the historical base rate of near-zero (0% over 45 years), modified upward by heightened nuclear, regional, and political pressures but then dampened by institutional constraints and the short 3‐month timeframe, the inside view prediction is calibrated at 3%. That is, in 3 out of 100 comparable cases, a US attack on Iran would occur in the next 93 days.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the US attack Iran before April 2026?” over the next 93 days; analysis reflects historical non-intervention and current escalating tensions.
2. Base rate: Nearly 0% historically; adjusted upward modestly.
3. Consistency check: 3 out of 100 times, a US attack on Iran occurs before April 2026—aligned with justification.
4. Key evidence: (i) 45-year record of no direct strikes, (ii) recent US military deployments “just in case,” (iii) high strategic costs and Congressional hurdles, (iv) provocations via rhetoric yet historical restraint.
5. Blind-spot: A sudden, unforeseen escalation (e.g., an Iranian nuclear breakthrough or miscalculation triggering rapid escalation) could cause a spike in probability.
6. Status quo: Given gradual shifts in US policy and enduring institutional risk aversion, the status quo of non-action remains the most likely outcome.

Probability: 3%
