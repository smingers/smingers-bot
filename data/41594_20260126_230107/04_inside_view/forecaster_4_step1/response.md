Analysis:

1.  Source analysis  
a. ABC-11 (6-25-2025). Factual core: lists a chronology of U.S.–Iran friction and – crucially – asserts “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025.  The station is a local affiliate that normally re-packages wire reports; the piece contains no original documents or on-the-record confirmation.  Quality: medium; useful for a rough timeline but not dispositive evidence.  
Opinion vs. fact: when it calls the strike “a major escalation” it is an interpretive label.  

b. American Military University article (12-24-2024).  Mostly historical background (1953-2015).  Authored by a legal scholar; low bias, adequate sourcing.  Limited forward-looking opinion – hence little weight on the forecast, but good for the long-run base rate.  

c. State Department FRUS volume (1969-72).  Primary source, but only historical.  No forward-looking views; serves as context only.  High factual quality.  

d. AP News timeline (6-13-2025).  Describes large-scale Israeli strikes on Iran in mid-2025 and claims they cancelled U.S.–Iran talks.  AP’s editorial standards are strong, but the dateline is in the future relative to our present, suggesting either a scenario exercise or mis-dated content.  I treat it as plausible but unverified.  

e. CFR “U.S.–Iran relations” (1-13-2026, excerpt to 2001).  Credible, but stops well before the period we care about.  Used only for long-term statistics.  

f. CNBC (6-23-2025).  Gives details of a Trump-brokered Israel–Iran cease-fire and brief U.S.–Iran exchange (Iranian missiles at al-Udeid).  CNBC relies on on-the-record statements and market data; medium-high reliability.  Opinions come only from clearly attributed officials.  

g. Agent_report (synthesised).  Collates open sources through Jan 2026 and is transparent about gaps.  Because it blends fact and analysis I treat the specific dated events as “soft” data (medium reliability) and the analytical probability numbers purely as opinion.  

2.  Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• U.S. direct attacks on nation-state territory since 1979.  Frequency: Iran (1988, 2025*), Libya (1986, 2011), Iraq (1991, 1998, 2003, 2020 limited), Syria (2017, 2018), Serbia (1999). Roughly 12 episodes in 45 years ≈ 27 % per year for some country, but only 2 of those 12 hit Iran (≈ 4 % per year).  
• U.S. attacks on Iran specifically.  Count = 2 (1988, 2025*) in 47 yrs → 4.3 % per year.  
• U.S. large-scale strikes on a target it has already hit within the prior 12 months (repeat-attack class).  Gulf War follow-on raids (Iraq 1992-2000) show that once the first strike occurs, repeated strikes are fairly common: 5 repeat years in 10.  So conditional probability given a strike in 2025 might be ≈ 50 % in the next 12 months.  

Suitability: the “U.S. attacks on Iran” class is too small; the “repeat-attack within one year” class offers a better statistical anchor because we already (apparently) had a U.S. strike in June 2025.  I therefore use the repeat-attack reference class, then discount for questions about veracity of the June 2025 event (see below).  

3.  Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining until 1 April 2026 = 64 days (≈ 0.18 yr).  If the conditional 50 %/yr hazard rate is correct, Poisson approximation gives P(strike in next 0.18 yr) ≈ 1 – e^(-0.50*0.18) ≈ 8.6 %.  
However, if “Operation Midnight Hammer” never happened, we revert to the long-run 4 %/yr base rate → P ≈ 0.7 %.  
Therefore I create two branches:  
• Branch A: June 2025 strike real, hazard 8.6 %.  Prior weight 60 % (moderate confidence in its reality).  
• Branch B: strike did not occur (or was only Israeli), hazard 0.7 %.  Prior weight 40 %.  
Weighted outside-view probability = 0.6*8.6 % + 0.4*0.7 % ≈ 5.3 %.  

4.  Justification / adjustments  
Up-risk factors (push probability up):  
• Tensions remain high: U.S. carrier strike group in Gulf, public Trump red-lines on protest repression.  
• Iran’s proxies periodically hit U.S. troops; one lethal incident could trigger a limited U.S. response.  
• Israeli unilateral behaviour can drag the U.S. in, as arguably happened in 2025.  The next two months include the Iranian Nowruz period when protest anniversaries often flare.  

Down-risk factors (push probability down):  
• Domestic U.S. war-weariness and election-year calculus (primaries March 3 & March 10).  Trump’s rhetoric is bellicose but he has repeatedly pulled back at the last minute (historically June 2019 drone incident, June 2025 cease-fire).  
• A cease-fire is nominally in effect; Iran knows another direct hit on U.S. forces would jeopardise needed sanctions relief.  
• Any U.S. strike so close to November 2026 mid-terms (and while oil is at $92) would be politically risky.  

Net adjustment: +1 % for proximate triggers, –1 % for political constraints → roughly cancels.  I therefore keep the 5 % figure derived from the weighted outside-view calculation.  

Outside view calibration:
I anchor on the repeat-attack reference class conditional on a prior strike (≈ 8-9 % over 2 months) but haircut that class by the possibility the June 2025 strike never happened.  After weighting branches and lightly adjusting for current incentives, the calibrated outside-view probability is 5 %.  This is intentionally a “true” probability, neither hedged high to sound tough nor low to sound dovish; it means I think an attack would surprise me 19 times out of 20, but it is far from impossible.

Outside View Prediction:
5 % (i.e., roughly 1-in-20 chance that the United States conducts a qualifying attack on Iran between 28 January 2026 and 31 March 2026 inclusive).
