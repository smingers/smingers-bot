Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Soufan Center IntelBrief (23 Jan 2026) – U.S. nonprofit with solid analytic reputation; mostly factual chronology of Iranian protests, U.S. deployments, and regional diplomacy.  Reliable for dates, quotes; analytic tone is informed opinion.  
2. INSS brief (19 Jan 2026) – Israeli think-tank, tends to be hawkish but data-rich.  Facts on protests, Trump tweets, and force movements are corroborated elsewhere; judgement sections are clearly labeled analysis.  
3. RAND commentary (26 Jan 2026) – U.S. policy institute with peer-review; focuses on Israel–Iran dynamics.  Good for force-structure numbers; future-looking statements are expert opinion.  
4. Denver Post wire story (26 Jan 2026) – Straight news; confirms precise U.S. naval and air deployments with CENTCOM quotes.  High factual value.  
5. RFE/RL report (26 Jan 2026) – US-funded broadcaster; credible on military moves, includes named experts Farzin Nadimi & Mehrdad Khansari.  Opinions clearly attributed.  
6. Guardian piece (26 Jan 2026) – Mainstream UK outlet; details Iranian propaganda response and reiterates U.S. deployments.  Factual for mural, quotes; interpretive language is minor.  

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “U.S. launches any kinetic strike on Iranian territory/forces before 1 Apr 2026”)  

Strong evidence (push ↑)  
• CENTCOM-confirmed arrival of USS Abraham Lincoln CSG + F-15E deployment (Guardian, Denver Post, RFE/RL) – shows military capability in-theatre.  
• Multiple on-record presidential threats of force tied to further repression (Soufan, INSS).  
• Historical pattern: Trump administration twice used limited force vs. Iran when red lines were crossed (Soleimani 2020; nuclear sites 2025).  

Moderate evidence (↑)  
• Expert Farzin Nadimi: “chances … very high,” notes exercises could mask real op (RFE/RL).  
• Iranian security posture elevated; IRGC urging proxies to prepare (RFE/RL).  

Moderate evidence (↓)  
• Documented regional lobbying (Israel, Gulf monarchies) persuading Trump to postpone (Soufan, RAND).  
• Internal U.S. assessment that strike would not topple regime and risks prolongation (Soufan).  
• Domestic political calendar – early primary season; large new war unpopular (historical polling).  

Weak evidence (↓)  
• Mural & rhetoric (“reap the whirlwind”) – signalling but largely propaganda (Guardian).  
• Rumoured but unverified mass-execution plans; protests appear to have ebbed (Soufan, INSS).  

Net qualitative balance: strong capability + past behaviour raise odds, but equally strong political & allied braking mechanisms restrain.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining until 1 Apr 2026: 64 (≈0.18 yr).  Halving window to 32 days would drop probability roughly by half, to about 4 %; doubling to 128 days would raise it to roughly 12–13 %, assuming constant hazard rate.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (repeat-strike within one year) produced 5 %.  
Up-adjustments  
+2 ppt Visible surge deployment & live-fire exercise create operational window.  
+1 ppt Explicit presidential threats; credibility cost of further climb-down.  
Down-adjustments  
–1 ppt Recent back-off after allied pressure; pattern of brinkmanship without follow-through.  
–0.5 ppt Trigger (mass executions or renewed killings) currently absent; protests fading.  
Resulting inside-view estimate: ~6.5 %.  Rounded to 7–8 % to reflect tail uncertainty that a sudden catalyst (e.g., lethal IRGC strike on U.S. personnel) could spike risk.  

Probability calibration

I assess an 8 % chance that the United States conducts at least one qualifying attack on Iran between today (27 Jan 2026) and 1 Apr 2026.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase – “Will the U.S. carry out any kinetic attack on Iran before 1 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated: 5 % (repeat-strike class).  
3. Consistency – “About 8 out of 100 times, the U.S. would strike Iran in the next 64 days.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) Carrier & air assets deployed; (ii) Trump’s public red-lines; (iii) Prior limited strikes on Iran; (iv) Regional/allied opposition; (v) Protests currently subsiding.  
5. Blind-spot – A sudden Iranian proxy attack killing U.S. troops could push Trump into rapid retaliation, raising true probability well above 8 %.  
6. Status-quo bias – Default path is no strike; my 8 % remains mostly on the “no-change” side.  

Probability: 8%
