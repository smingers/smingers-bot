Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. ABC11 Raleigh-Durham (June 25 2025).  Local U.S. TV affiliate summarising six decades of U.S.–Iran history and claiming “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a U.S. strike on Fordow and two other sites in June 2025.  Factual segments on 1953-2020 period track well-known history; the June 2025 strike claim is not corroborated by any major international outlet and is presented without primary sourcing.  Credibility: medium for historical background, low for the June 2025 strike assertion until independently confirmed.  Mainly factual, few opinions.  
2. American Military University blog (Dec 24 2024) by a legal historian.  Academic tone, cites public records; no policy views.  Reliable for pre-2024 history.  
3. U.S. State Department FRUS volume (1969-72).  Primary archival material; gold-standard for that era.  Irrelevant for the forecast window.  
4. AP News timeline (June 13 2025).  Normally a high-reliability wire service, but this item is dated in the future and reports large Israeli attacks inside Iran that are absent from other mainstream databases.  Treat as scenario or speculative.  
5. Council on Foreign Relations timeline (Jan 13 2026 excerpt ends in 2001).  High quality, purely historical.  
6. CNBC report (June 23 2025).  Real outlet but, again, future-dated and describing a Trump-brokered Israel-Iran cease-fire that is not documented elsewhere.  Treat with caution.  
7. Agent-supplied report.  Synthesises the above “future” articles plus open-source history.  Because it rests on the same un-verified June 2025 material, it is informative for framing but not for hard facts.

Bottom line: Only the long-term historical facts (items 1, 2, 3, 5) can be used with confidence.  All “2025” kinetic-war accounts lack external corroboration and, per instructions, the adjudicating body says “criteria have not yet been satisfied.”  Therefore the working assumption is that, as of 27 Jan 2026, the United States has NOT yet conducted a qualifying attack on Iran.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i.  Incidence of direct U.S. military strikes on Iranian territory since 1979 (Praying Mantis 1988; none since).  → 1 event in 46 years.  
ii.  Incidence of direct U.S. strikes on peer or near-peer adversary homelands without a declaration of war (e.g., Libya 1986, Serbia 1999, Syria 2017/2018).  Roughly 4–5 events in 40 years.  
iii.  Incidence of U.S. initiating new combat operations anywhere in a given two-month window (including counter-terror raids).  25–30 episodes since 1979 ≈ 0.6 per year.

Class (i) is tightly matched to the question and avoids dilution.  I therefore adopt class (i).

C. Timeframe analysis  
Time until deadline: 27 Jan 2026 → 1 Apr 2026 = 64 days ≈ 0.175 years.  
Historical base-rate from class (i): 1 attack / 46 years = 2.17 % per full year.  
Scaling to 0.175 years: 2.17 %  × 0.175 ≈ 0.38 %.

D. Justification (outside view only)  
•  Base-rate is <1 % for any random 64-day slice since 1979.  
•  Even during high-tension eras (1987-88 “Tanker War,” 2019 drone shoot-down, 2020 Soleimani strike in Iraq) the U.S. refrained from hitting inside Iran proper.  Therefore the base-rate already embeds episodes of acute crisis.  
•  Present-day circumstances (proxy skirmishes, sanctions, naval deployments) are not unprecedented in intensity.  Without looking at fresh inside-view signals, the most defensible outside-view estimate remains close to the scaled historical base-rate.  
•  To reflect model uncertainty (only one data-point) I widen the probability slightly but keep it clearly under 5 %.

Outside view calibration:
Historical scaled base-rate: 0.4 %.  
Apply a one-order-of-magnitude uncertainty factor (×2 to ×5 is common in sparse data).  Using ×4 produces 1.6 %; round to nearest whole percent gives 2 %.

Outside View Prediction:
2 % (≈ 1-in-50 chance that the United States will attack Iran between now and April 2026, before considering any inside-view information).
