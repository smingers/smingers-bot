Analysis:  

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)  
1. RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty, 26 Jan 2026 – Long-standing, reputable US-funded broadcaster; clearly separates fact (carrier, air-exercise deployments, White-House deliberations) from quoted opinions (Farzin Nadimi, Mehrdad Khansari). Quality: high for facts; opinions moderate—both experts are identifiable regional specialists.  
2. Guardian, 26 Jan 2026 – Mainstream UK newspaper with solid fact-checking; article adds imagery (Tehran mural) and direct quotations from Trump and Iran’s prosecutor.  Mostly factual; minimal analysis.  
3. Denver Post, 26 Jan 2026 – US local daily citing CENTCOM statements and aircraft-tracking data.  High factual reliability for deployments; little interpretation.  
4. RAND commentary, 26 Jan 2026 – US think-tank; author usually peer-reviewed.  Provides data on June 2025 conflict, quotes senior Israeli officers.  Good for defence-capability context, but forward-looking arguments are opinion.  
5. Soufan Center IntelBrief, 23 Jan 2026 – Non-profit security think-tank led by ex-FBI analyst.  Uses multiple official and press sources; analytic tone.  Factual sections rated high; conjecture about “kinetic action may still happen” is opinion.  
6. INSS (Israel), 19 Jan 2026 – Academic institute with defence focus.  Facts on protests and US deliberations come from open sources; judgment on “dilemma” is author opinion.  Reliability moderate-high.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Confirmed arrival of USS Abraham Lincoln strike group, F-15Es, large air-exercise (3 independent outlets, official press releases).  Direction: raises likelihood (+).  
• Stated US policy that a ground invasion is ruled out (Soufan, INSS, historical pattern).  Direction: limits scope of attack (neither + nor – for “any attack,” but constrains scale).  

Moderate evidence  
• Repeated public threats by President Trump to strike if executions/killings continue (Soufan, Guardian, RFE/RL). (+)  
• Expert assessment (“chances … very high”) from Farzin Nadimi (+) balanced by Khansari’s warning of unpredictable costs (–).  
• Regional allies—Israel, Saudi-led Gulf states—actively lobbying Washington against a strike (Soufan, RAND). (–)  

Weak evidence  
• Tehran propaganda mural and IRGC rhetoric; signals resolve but often posturing (±0).  
• Unverified claims that prior US strikes occurred in 2025 (treated as not proven; excluded).  

Weighting net effect: two strong (+), three moderate (two +, one –), one moderate (–) → overall odds modestly above baseline but still well below even.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until deadline: 64 days (0.175 yr).  Halving to 32 days would remove some carrier transits and diplomatic cycles; I would trim probability by roughly one-third.  Doubling to 128 days would permit an additional crisis trigger (e.g., mass execution, nuclear test); probability would nearly double.  

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base probability (scaled historical class “US strikes inside Iran”): 2 %.  
Adjustments:  
+ Carrier group & air-exercise already in theatre (×3)  
+ Presidential rhetoric & prior risk-accepting behaviour (×2)  
– Explicit opposition from Israel & Gulf monarchies, fear of escalation (×0.6)  
– No ongoing mass-casualty trigger; protests ebbing (×0.7)  
Net Bayes factor ≈ 3 × 2 × 0.6 × 0.7 ≈ 2.5  
Updated odds: 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 0.0204  → 0.0204 × 2.5 ≈ 0.051  
Converted back to probability: 5 %.  
Given expert divergence and the possibility of a sudden catalyst, I add a qualitative +2 pp cushion for model uncertainty.  

Probability calibration  
Inside-view probability that the United States conducts at least one qualifying armed attack on Iranian territory before 1 Apr 2026: 7 %.  
Interpretation: roughly 1 time in 14 comparable two-month crises.  

Checklist:  
1. Re-phrase: “Any US strike on Iranian soil before 1 Apr 2026?”  
2. Outside view: 2 %/64 days.  
3. “7 out of 100 times, the US strikes Iran before deadline.”  Coherent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (a) carrier & air-exercise in theatre; (b) Trump’s public red-lines; (c) allies lobbying against strike; (d) protests calming; (e) expert view of high odds.  
5. Blind spot: A sudden, video-documented mass execution or IRGC killing of US sailors could catapult probability >50 %.  
6. Status-quo inertia argues for reining in over-reaction, hence forecast stays single-digit.  

Probability: 7%
