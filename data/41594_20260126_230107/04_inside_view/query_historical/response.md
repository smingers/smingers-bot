Analysis:
To estimate the likelihood that the United States will launch an attack on Iran before April 2026, I first need an “outside view” grounded in historical precedent and current escalation dynamics. Key context includes:  
• Instances since 1979 when the U.S. has used overt military force against Iran or its assets, and what precipitated those actions.  
• Patterns of U.S.–Iran escalation (e.g., tanker wars of the 1980s, Soleimani strike in 2020, tit-for-tat strikes in Syria/Iraq 2023-24).  
• Recent policy statements, deployments, and congressional authorizations that might signal intent.  
• Reporting on the most recent flashpoints (Houthi attacks in Red Sea, Iran’s nuclear advances, proxy militia strikes on U.S. forces).  
Collecting this background will allow me to compare today’s conditions with prior moments that did (or did not) lead to direct U.S. attacks.
