# Summary of Article: "How we got here: The history of the tension between the U.S. and Iran"

**Source:** ABC11 Raleigh-Durham  
**Date:** June 25, 2025

## Key Facts and Timeline:

**Historical Background (1953-1991):**
- 1953: US-British coup removed democratically-elected PM Mohammed Mossadeq, installing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
- 1979: Shah overthrown by Islamic fundamentalists, establishing Iran's Islamic Republic; Iran Hostage Crisis began with 52 Americans held for 444 days
- U.S. and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since the hostage crisis
- 1983: Iran-backed terrorists bombed U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American service members
- 1984: U.S. labeled Iran as state sponsor of terrorism
- 1988: U.S. destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and a ship; U.S. forces shot down Iranian passenger plane killing all 290 people aboard
- 1991-1992: Sanctions intensified with Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act

**Recent Escalation (2002-2025):**
- 2002: President Bush identified Iran as part of "axis of evil"
- 2007: U.S. National Intelligence estimate found Iran ended nuclear arms program in 2003 but continued enriching uranium
- 2015: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal reached
- 2017: President Trump withdrew from JCPOA
- January 2020: U.S. airstrike killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of Iran's elite Quds Force; Iran responded by fully defying nuclear deal restraints
- Early 2023: International Atomic Energy Agency found uranium enriched to "near weapons-grade level" at Iran's Fordow facility
- April 2025: In-person meeting between Iran's Foreign Minister and Steve Witkoff (Trump's Middle East Envoy); both sides confirmed progress with Iran vowing to discuss new nuclear deal

**Critical Current Event:**
- **June 2025: U.S. strikes targeted nuclear sites in Iran, described as "a major escalation"** - the article specifically mentions "Operation Midnight Hammer" targeting Fordow and two other nuclear sites
- Just before these strikes, as U.S. and Iran were planning talks, U.S.-ally Israel started bombing Iran, citing their nuclear program as an imminent threat

## Named Source Opinion:
- Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation: Iran's breakout time (time to accumulate enough fissile material for nuclear weapon) reduced from more than a year to about 3-4 months since U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA

- Main point of contention: the Shah's desire for expensive, high-technology weapons
- U.S. officials were concerned arms build-up might imperil Iranian internal stability by diverting funds from social efforts
- In May 1972, Nixon promised to sell the Shah any American arms (short of atomic weapons) that he desired, abandoning efforts to restrain military spending
- The Johnson administration had signed a $100 million per year, six-year military agreement with the Shah in 1968
- U.S. policymakers believed the Shah's arms build-up could threaten stability within Iran and in the Gulf region
- Iranian purchases improved the U.S. balance of payments position

**U.S.-Iraq Relations:**
- The Nixon administration viewed the Iraqi Ba'athist regime "with suspicion if not hostility"
- Iraq had severed relations with the United States in 1967
- In July 1972, the U.S. Government began supporting the Iraqi Kurdish rebellion under Mullah Mustafa Barzani to keep the Ba'athist regime off-balance, after Iraq signed a treaty with the Soviets in April 1972

**Relevance to Forecast Question:** None. This is purely historical documentation with no bearing on current or future U.S.-Iran relations.

Query: Provide a concise timeline of direct and proxy military confrontations between the United States and Iran since 1979, highlighting triggers, U.S. decision-makers’ rationales, and outcomes; then summarize 2023-2026 escalation indicators and expert assessments of likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026.
Below is a compact but complete response built almost entirely from the material surfaced in the search results. All dates refer to the Gregorian calendar.

I.  U.S.–IRAN MILITARY CONFRONTATIONS, 1979-2022  
The list interweaves direct clashes with proxy episodes in which Washington judged Tehran legally or operationally responsible.

1. Nov 1979–Jan 1981 – U.S. Embassy seizure, Tehran  
   Trigger: radical students retaliated for the Shah’s admission to the U.S.  
   U.S. decision-makers (Carter, then Reagan) chose economic sanctions, a failed rescue attempt (Apr 1980, Operation Eagle Claw), and finally an Algerian-brokered deal.  
   Outcome: 52 hostages freed; diplomatic ties severed and never restored. (CNN timeline; UANI)

2. 1982-1991 – Hezbollah hostage-taking & bombings in Lebanon (U.S. Embassy April 1983; Marine Barracks Oct 1983; multiple kidnappings)  
   Trigger: U.S. peacekeeping presence; Iranian support for Shia militias.  
   U.S. rationale (Reagan/Bush 41): protect forces and maritime traffic while avoiding a ground war with Iran; limited naval gunfire and withdrawal from Beirut.  
   Outcome: 258 U.S. personnel killed; Hezbollah entrenched. (UANI)

3. 1987-1988 – “Tanker War,” Operation Earnest Will & Operation Praying Mantis  
   Trigger: Iran mining Persian Gulf and firing on re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers amid the Iran-Iraq War.  
   U.S. rationale (Reagan): preserve freedom of navigation and global oil flow.  
   Outcome: largest U.S. surface naval battle since WWII; Iranian navy suffered heavy losses; no wider war. (UANI)

4. July 1988 – Shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655 by USS Vincennes  
   Trigger: Mistaken identity during high-tempo Gulf operations.  
   U.S. called it accident; Tehran called it massacre.  
   Outcome: 290 civilians killed; still a grievance in Iranian narrative. (CNN)

5. 1996 – Khobar Towers truck-bombing, Saudi Arabia  
   Trigger: Presence of U.S. airmen enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq; attack carried out by Saudi Hizbollah with IRGC support.  
   U.S. (Clinton) refrained from strike; opted for indictments and covert pressure.  
   Outcome: 19 Americans killed; event cited later to justify terror designation of IRGC. (UANI)

6. 2003-2011 – Iraq War “proxy hot war”  
   Trigger: U.S. invasion of Iraq; Iran saw need to bleed U.S. and shape post-Saddam order.  
   U.S. (Bush 43/Obama) accused IRGC-Qods Force of supplying explosively formed penetrators that killed >600 U.S. troops.  
   Outcome: Dozens of militia–U.S. firefights; no direct U.S. strike on Iranian soil. (UANI)

7. Jan 2016 – U.S. detains IRGC sailors after navigation error in Gulf; quick diplomatic resolution under JCPOA framework. (generic, covered in CNN chronology)

8. May 2019–Jan 2020 – Maximum-Pressure period  
   •  June 2019: Iran shoots down U.S. RQ-4 drone; President Trump approves strikes, then aborts.  
   •  Dec 2019: Kataib Hizbollah rocket attack kills a U.S. contractor; U.S. airstrikes on militia bases.  
   •  3 Jan 2020: U.S. drone strike kills Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad airport.  
   Rationale (Trump term 1): re-establish deterrence.  
   Outcome: Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage on Ayn al-Asad base injured 100+ U.S. personnel; informal deterrence reset but proxy attacks resumed later. (CNN; CFR tracker)

9. Oct 2023-Aug 2024 – Post-Hamas War proxy surge  
   Trigger: Hamas 7 Oct 2023 assault on Israel.  
   Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) carried out >180 rocket/drone strikes on U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Jordan; killed 3 U.S. soldiers (Jan 2024).  
   U.S. responses: limited strikes on IRGC facilities in Syria/Iraq (Oct 26 2023; Feb 2 2024). (CFR tracker; Long War Journal)

II.  ESCALATION TO DIRECT U.S.–IRAN STRIKES, 2024-2025  
10. Apr 1 2024 – Suspected Israeli airstrike on Iranian consular facility in Damascus kills IRGC generals → Iran launches 300+ drones/missiles at Israel (CFR).  
11. Oct 2024 – After further tit-for-tat, Iran fires 180 ballistic missiles at Israel; Israel directly hits Iranian air-defense and missile plants (CFR).  
12. Jun 12-13 2025 – IAEA finds Iran in breach; Israel mounts unilateral mass strike on nuclear & military sites.  
13. Jun 21 2025 – U.S. Air-Force-led strikes using bunker-busters on Fordow, Natanz & Isfahan, first ever U.S. attack on Iran’s nuclear program (CFR; CNN; Brookings).  
    Rationale (Trump term 2): align with Israel to “significantly hinder” weaponization; signal openness to regime change; demonstrate credibility.  
    Outcome: IAEA head says delay of “months.” Iran retaliates with missile salvo at Al-Udeid, Qatar (no casualties); Trump declares cease-fire 23 Jun. Truce largely holds but proxy environment remains volatile. (CFR; Brookings)

III.  2026 CRISIS OVER DOMESTIC REPRESSION  
•  Late Dec 2025–Jan 2026 – Nationwide Iranian protests over economic collapse; death toll 5,000-20,000 per human-rights groups.  
•  U.S. deploys USS Abraham Lincoln CSG; Trump sets red lines: mass executions or killing of peaceful protesters will trigger strikes (AP 26 Jan 2026; Iran International 26 Jan 2026).  
•  Iran-linked Houthis and Kataib Hizbollah threaten shipping and “total war,” signalling escalation ladders.  
•  CENTCOM / Israeli coordination intensifies; yet no U.S. kinetic action as of 26 Jan 2026. Analysts note political-will constraints and fear of regional conflagration. (AP; Iran International; BBC 12 Jan 2026)

IV.  EXPERT ASSESSMENTS OF U.S. STRIKE PROBABILITY, 2023-APR 2026  
•  Prior to the June 2025 strikes, most think-tank assessments put likelihood of U.S. attack <25 % absent Iranian move toward weaponization. That changed after Israel’s June 2025 raid, which “pulled” the U.S. in.  
•  Brookings post-mortem (24 Jun 2025) judges that Washington may strike again if Iran resumes enrichment or mass-casualty proxy attacks, but “military means alone cannot ensure a positive outcome,” implying restraint.  
•  RAND commentary (Jan 2026) argues détente with Israel “won’t last,” but also stresses U.S. aversion to getting “bogged down” again; probability of another large-scale U.S. strike before Apr 2026 deemed moderate (roughly one-third) and conditional on (a) mass protest killings, (b) rapid nuclear rebuild, or (c) strikes on U.S. personnel.  
•  Media analyses (AP, Iran International) highlight signaling—carrier, high-level visits—yet underline domestic poll fatigue with wars and Trump’s “America-First” doctrine, keeping odds below 50 %.  

V.  KEY ESCALATION INDICATORS, 2023-2026  
1.  Rate and lethality of proxy militia attacks on U.S. troops and shipping (Long War Journal; AP).  
2.  IAEA inspection reports & Iranian enrichment milestones (CFR; Brookings).  
3.  Israeli unilateral actions, which have twice forced Washington’s hand (CFR).  
4.  Scale of repression inside Iran—death tolls, executions (BBC; Iran International).  
5.  U.S. naval deployments and public red-line statements (AP; Iran International).  

VI.  OUTCOMES AND STRATEGIC EFFECTS SO FAR  
•  Iran’s nuclear timetable delayed months, not years; inspectors’ access now severely limited (Brookings).  
•  Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance” weakened after Israeli blows to Hamas, Hezbollah, militias; hesitancy evident in 2025-26 crises (AP).  
•  U.S.–Gulf allies support new Trump negotiations, hoping to avoid region-wide war (NY Times 20 Apr 2025).  
•  Russia & China rhetorically back Iran but decline material aid, illustrating limits of anti-U.S. axis (TIME 23 Jun 2025).  

VII.  INFORMATION GAPS  
A.  Quantitative casualty tallies for some 1980-2003 proxy events differ across sources; official DoD figures could refine.  
B.  Precise U.S. rules of engagement governing 2026 carrier group not publicly available.  
C.  Up-to-date IAEA verification status post-June 2025 attack not in open press after mid-2025.  
D.  Polling on U.S. public support for Iran intervention since 2025 absent; fresh survey data would sharpen likelihood estimates.

Given the breadth of material already captured—from historical episodes to 2026—no further searches appear essential for a concise policy briefing.</Agent_report>
