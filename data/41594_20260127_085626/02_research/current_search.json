Qassem made the remarks during a solidarity rally in Lebanon, cautioning that a military conflict targeting Iran could trigger a broader regional war. This development occurs amid increased U.S. military presence in the Gulf, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, and President Donald Trump reiterating that military action against Iran remains a viable option.

Waiting for the Major Escalation**\nThe article discusses the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, focusing on the potential for a U.S. military strike against Iran amid ongoing regional instability. U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly had bombers ready to attack Iran on January 8, 2026, but halted the operation at the last minute, stating 'no further executions are planned,' signaling a temporary pause in military action. Despite a growing U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, including a 'strong armada,' experts believe the element of surprise has been lost, and a successful regime change through airstrikes is now unlikely. U.S. Admiral Brad Cooper, head of CENTCOM, emphasized close cooperation with Israel and Gulf allies but avoided any aggressive statements. Analysts estimate the U.S. military may need at least two more weeks to launch effective attacks. The goal of such an attack may not be regime change but rather coercive diplomacy\u2014pressuring Iran to compromise on its nuclear program. Trump has maintained that diplomacy remains open, stating, 'The Iran wants to talk, so we will talk!' Meanwhile, Israeli and Arab experts agree that military action risks triggering broader conflict, with U.S. military bases in Iraq and the Gulf vulnerable to retaliation. Israel\u2019s air defense system, though impressive, was tested during a 12-day war in June 2025, when Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles, killing 28 and injuring 3,238, prompting Israel to replenish its missile stockpiles. The article also notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has limited influence, deferring to Trump\u2019s decisions, as seen in controversial moves like the Rafah border opening. The article concludes with a critical tone toward the concentration of power in Trump\u2019s hands and the perceived lack of strategic coherence in U.S. Middle East policy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:30 AM\nSource:[Kurier](https://kurier.at/politik/ausland/israel-us-angriff-iran-trump-netanjahu-mullahs-proteste/403124976)\n\n**U.S. Military Buildup Near Iran Sparks Global Tensions Amid Submarine Deployments and Diplomatic Maneuvering**\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threats of military action against Iran, the U.S. has significantly increased its military presence near Iran, including the deployment of the USS Lincoln carrier strike group to the Indian Ocean, accompanied by cruisers, destroyers, and C-17 transport aircraft, signaling preparations for potential 'extreme scenarios.' In response, major international airlines such as KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa suspended flights over Iraq, Iran, Israel, and Gulf states, indicating a severe assessment of regional security risks. Iran has countered by deploying two domestically built 'Fatah'-class submarines to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global energy chokepoint, with the capability to disrupt shipping via mine-laying, ambushes, or oil tanker attacks. Iran's leadership has issued a firm warning: any U.S. strike, even a 'surgical' one, would be considered the start of full-scale war, and the country is on high alert. Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei is reportedly operating from an underground bunker, with his son Masoud assuming partial duties, and the Revolutionary Guard is using 'flash appearances' to maintain the illusion of leadership continuity. Meanwhile, the U.S. has not deployed large-scale air or ground forces, suggesting caution over the potential for uncontrollable escalation. China and Russia are actively engaged in diplomatic efforts: China opposes military intervention and emphasizes non-dollar trade, while Russia conducts joint naval drills with Iran and privately communicates with the U.S. on conflict management. The situation remains highly volatile, with global consequences looming\u2014oil prices, supply chains, and regional stability at risk. The outcome hinges on Washington\u2019s decision, as Trump\u2019s 'maximum pressure' strategy aims to bolster his political base ahead of midterm elections and force Iran to return to negotiations, but risks triggering a war with severe economic and geopolitical costs. The crisis underscores that in today\u2019s interconnected world, a conflict in the Middle East would have global repercussions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 10:04 PM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/980302940_121752853?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0-0-0-0-0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**U.S.-Iran Tensions Rise as Lincoln Carrier Deployed to Middle East Amid Diplomatic Backchannel Efforts**\nTensions between the United States and Iran have escalated following the Pentagon's confirmation of the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the Middle East. In response, Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander stated that Iranian forces are 'more ready than ever, with their finger on the trigger,' while Foreign Minister Esmail Baghaei promised a 'radical response' in case of an American attack. Despite the heightened rhetoric, behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly delivered a WhatsApp message from Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi and President Pezeshkian offering guarantees in exchange for a suspension of attacks against Iran. This follows a prior incident in January 2026, during a violent crackdown on protesters in Tehran, when Araghchi contacted Witkoff to slow down U.S. military plans. President Trump claimed he reversed course on aiding protesters after being told Iran had 'erased 800 executions,' a claim repeatedly denied by Iran\u2019s chief prosecutor as 'completely false.' The deployment coincides with the release of a new mural in Tehran\u2019s Enghelab Square depicting damaged U.S. fighter jets and blood-streaked aircraft carrier decks, symbolizing the warning 'If you sow the wind, you will reap the storm.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 06:12 PM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/politica/si-alza-tensione-usa-iran-il-pentagono-conferma-l-arrivo-portaerei-lincoln-461863)\n\n**Iran Unveils Warning Poster Against U.S. Military Action Amid Escalating Tensions**\nIran unveiled a new propaganda poster on Enghelab Square in Tehran, warning the United States against military action. The image depicts a damaged aircraft carrier with exploded fighter jets, bloodied bodies on deck, and bloodstains resembling the stripes of the American flag flowing behind the fleet. The slogan reads: 'If you sow the wind, you will reap the storm.' This comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump stated on Air Force One that the U.S. was deploying a 'massive fleet' toward the region 'just in case' he decided to act, adding that any new U.S. strikes would be 'like peanuts' compared to potential future attacks. Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned the U.S. and Israel to 'avoid miscalculation,' stating the force is 'more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.' Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian issued a direct warning in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, stating that Iran 'will retaliate with everything we have' if attacked again, contrasting with Iran\u2019s restraint in the June 2025 conflict with Israel. The escalation follows nationwide protests beginning December 28, initially over the collapse of the rial, but evolving into broader anti-government unrest. According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 5,002 activists have been killed and over 41,280 arrested since the protests began, with fears that many more have died due to a prolonged internet blackout lasting over two weeks, severely limiting information flow.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 08:48 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://fr.euronews.com/2026/01/26/liran-devoile-un-panneau-daffichage-mettant-en-garde-les-etats-unis-contre-une-action-mili)\n\n**[Investment Note] Domestic Market in Favorable Winds Amid U.S. Shutdown and Middle East Tensions**\nSouth Korea's domestic stock market continues its strong performance, with the KOSPI surpassing 5,000 points and the KOSDAQ achieving its first 'Thousand-KOSDAQ' recovery in four years. However, external uncertainties persist, including escalating geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and renewed concerns over a potential U.S. government shutdown by late January 2026. The situation intensified after two separate incidents in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents fatally shot civilians, fueling nationwide distrust in federal immigration policies. Although the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Homeland Security budget bill on January 23, the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority has pushed to condition its approval on limiting ICE funding. According to Polymarket, the probability of a U.S. government shutdown has risen from below 10% to approximately 80%. A shutdown would likely delay key economic data releases and create monetary policy uncertainty, as seen during the 2023 prolonged shutdown. However, analysts suggest domestic market impact will be limited. Hyung-won Ha of Hyundai Motor Securities stated that the most likely scenario involves separating the controversial DHS portion of the bill, allowing other legislation to pass, thereby minimizing market disruption. Additionally, rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran\u2014prompted by U.S. military movements, including an aircraft carrier group in the Indian Ocean\u2014pose a supply risk, particularly for oil. Despite Iran\u2019s significant oil production (three times that of Venezuela), analysts believe a full-scale conflict is unlikely, especially given the political context and the potential for global oil price volatility. Ha noted that while the political backgrounds of the U.S.-Venezuela and U.S.-Iran situations differ, from an oil market perspective, a full-scale conflict with Iran is unlikely under a Trump administration.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 08:23 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/stock/analysis-prospect/2026/01/27/SV2IAIQDVFBR3APDJRSIK2R2OM/)\n\n**Iran Displays Warning Poster to U.S. Ahead of Military Tensions**\nIran has displayed a new poster in Tehran's Enghelab Square, warning the United States against military action.

The poster depicts a damaged and exploding aircraft carrier with bloodstains resembling the American flag, accompanied by the slogan 'if you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.' This follows U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that warships are being deployed to the region 'just in case' he decides to act, stating that any military action would make previous U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities 'look like child's play.' Iran's Revolutionary Guard commander warned the U.S. and Israel to avoid 'miscalculation,' asserting that Iran's forces are 'more ready than ever, with their finger on the trigger.' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a direct threat in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, stating that Iran will 'respond with everything we have' if attacked again, contrasting its restraint in the June 2025 conflict with Israel. The escalation occurs amid ongoing repression of nationwide protests that began on December 28, 2025, initially over the rial's collapse but evolving into broader discontent with the government. According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 5,002 activists have been killed and over 41,280 detained, with fears of higher casualties due to a prolonged internet blackout lasting over two weeks.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 06:26 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/2026/01/26/autoridades-iranianas-fixam-novo-cartaz-em-teerao-onde-advertem-eua-contra-acao-militar)\n\n**Tensions Surge in Middle East: U.S. Military Buildup and Iran's Bunkerized Leadership Amid Escalating Crisis**\nTensions between the United States, Israel, and Iran have escalated, with reports indicating that U.S. military forces are deploying aircraft carriers and fighter jets to the Middle East amid fears of an imminent American strike on Iran. Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), met with Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief Eyal Zamir in a lengthy and personal meeting, underscoring the deepening strategic military cooperation between the two nations. The U.S. Department of State released a hardline message on X (formerly Twitter) in Persian, stating that violence is an integral part of Iran\u2019s political strategy since 1979, citing the suppression of protests, including the killing of Mahsa Amini and the use of 18-wheel trucks instead of ambulances during crackdowns. According to Time magazine, citing anonymous Iranian health officials, over 30,000 people may have been killed in just two days of protests in early January 2026\u2014far exceeding the official government figure of 3,117. Iran International reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has reportedly retreated into a bunker, with his son Masoud Khamenei acting as a proxy. Iranian Revolutionary Guards declared readiness to follow orders, stating 'We have our finger on the trigger.' Satellite images show damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, including Fordow and Isfahan. U.S. military activity includes the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, increased fighter presence in Jordan, and a spike in Pentagon Pizza Meter deliveries\u2014used as an informal indicator of geopolitical stress. Meanwhile, several airlines suspended flights to Middle Eastern capitals, only to resume after U.S. envoy Steven Witkoff and Jared Kushner arrived in Israel to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu. The article notes that while the situation is highly volatile, the presence of high-level U.S. officials may be delaying a potential military escalation.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 08:02 AM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/tira-aria-guerra-teheran-gli-uniti-stanno-spostando-portaerei-caccia-in-461672)\n\n**Escalating Tensions Between Iran and the U.S. Amid Diplomatic Push for Gaza Stabilization**\nTensions are escalating between the United States and Iran, with reports indicating that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has relocated to a special underground bunker in Tehran, according to the opposition website Iran International. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier USS Lincoln, accompanied by Tomahawk-armed destroyers, combat jets, supply ships, and a command vessel, is advancing toward the Middle East region. This military buildup coincides with heightened diplomatic activity in Gaza, where the U.S. is pushing Italy to join the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for the Gaza Strip as a founding member. Italy would not deploy combat troops but would train the future Gaza police force, leveraging its political influence across Arab states, Israel, and Palestinian factions. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency of the Council have reportedly received the proposal. Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed Italy\u2019s readiness to send Carabinieri instructors to train police in Gaza and the West Bank, potentially including deployment to Rafah to reinforce border operations. Despite these efforts, the U.S. and Iran are preparing for a possible military confrontation, with Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards stating they are 'ready as never before, with their finger on the trigger.' U.S. Central Command Commander Brad Cooper met with Israeli defense leaders following accusations from Tehran that the U.S. incited anti-regime protests, which were violently suppressed, resulting in an estimated 53,000 deaths according to Human Rights International. Vice President JD Vance emphasized the U.S. has multiple strategic options and is prepared to respond decisively if Iran acts recklessly. In response to the crisis, airlines including Lufthansa, Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Swiss have canceled numerous flights to and from the Middle East for safety reasons.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 07:27 AM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/venti-guerra-iran-e-usa-e-khamenei-va-nel-bunker-2600299.html)\n\n**War Clouds Over Iran As Trump Issues Military Threats Deploys US Warships; Fears Of Conflict Rise**\nGeopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating, with the U.S. deploying warships and issuing military threats, leading to growing fears of a potential military confrontation.

Over 500 people have been killed, and widespread property damage has occurred during anti-government demonstrations triggered by economic collapse, inflation, currency devaluation, and subsidy cuts. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the U.S. of instigating the unrest. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump issued multiple threats, including vowing to 'wipe out Iran' and 'obliterate' its nuclear capacity during potential strikes in June 2025, while also calling Khamenei 'a sick man' and demanding new leadership. Iran retaliated with a firm warning: any attack would trigger a full-scale war. The deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group\u2014comprising a central aircraft carrier, escort warships, and fighter jets\u2014near Iran has heightened fears of a major military confrontation. The situation intensified in January 2026, with Trump stating in an interview that 'anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,' and reaffirming in Davos that Iran 'does want to talk, and will talk.' A senior Iranian official declared the U.S. military presence a direct threat and vowed retaliation using 'everything at its disposal.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 07:31 PM\nSource:[Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India](https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-protests-threats-carrier-strike-group-how-us-iran-tensions-escalated-again-3198105)\n\n**US-Iran Relations: 2026\u200a -- \u200aA New Geopolitical Order on a Powder Keg**\nThe article analyzes the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran in early 2026, framing them as a critical turning point in a decades-long conflict rooted in historical trauma. The 'spine effect'\u2014shaped by the 1953 CIA-backed coup that overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh and the 1979 Islamic Revolution\u2014continues to influence both nations' strategic mindsets. Washington\u2019s 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' strategy and Iran\u2019s position at the 'nuclear threshold' have narrowed diplomatic space. Key developments from 2021 to 2026 include the collapse of JCPOA negotiations, regional proxy escalation (2023), direct missile exchanges between Iran and Israel (2024), the '12-Day War' (2025), and mass domestic protests in Iran (2026) driven by economic collapse. As of January 2026, Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpiles are sufficient for 5\u201310 nuclear warheads, crossing Washington\u2019s red line. The risk of large-scale war is estimated at 65\u201370%, with triggers including nuclear weaponization, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and regime-driven scapegoating. Regional consequences include potential oil price spikes to $150\u2013180 per barrel, disruption of global supply chains, and a new refugee wave. Three scenarios are outlined: 'The Grand Bargain' (15% probability), 'Permanent Grey Zone' (50% probability), and 'Regional Apocalypse' (35% probability). The article concludes that 2026 marks the end of strategic ambiguity, with no clear winners in a conflict that would devastate global energy markets and regional stability. Iran\u2019s internal unrest now plays a more decisive role than U.S. military threats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:49 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@geologic990/us-iran-relations-2026-a-new-geopolitical-order-on-a-powder-keg-1f20e03a55ab)\n\n**'Stanford & Poor's': Impact of U.S.-Iran Conflict on Regional Credit 'Limited'**\nStandard & Poor's (S&P) stated in its latest report that sovereign credit ratings and banks in the Middle East region possess strong resilience against most prolonged tensions between the United States and Iran. Although direct military threats have recently diminished, persistent uncertainty remains a risk that could pressure regional creditworthiness. However, S&P forecasts that the credit impact of any potential escalation will remain limited, similar to the June 2025 events, supported by strong financial buffers accumulated over years of oil surpluses. The agency assumes that any conflict would remain confined to limited, targeted strikes without major casualties\u2014a scenario labeled 'moderate stress.' It also rules out attacks on critical infrastructure in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, citing recent diplomatic efforts to improve bilateral relations. The report considers a regime change in Tehran via direct military intervention highly unlikely, due to Iran\u2019s strong security apparatus and lack of a viable, organized political alternative. Geopolitical tensions affect the regional economy through multiple channels, primarily disruptions to strategic shipping routes like the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandeb, increasing insurance and logistics costs. The report warns that sustained instability in Iran and ongoing military activity could prolong downward credit pressures through capital outflows, slower non-oil sector growth, and rising government security spending. While higher oil prices from supply tensions may boost budgets of exporting nations, the net benefit depends entirely on their ability to maintain production and ensure the security of maritime export routes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5231729)\n\n**Escalating Digital Confrontation Between Tehran and Washington: Khameini Fires Back with a Fiery Message**\nTensions between the United States and Iran are escalating into a public digital confrontation on social media platforms. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a military threat against Tehran via Truth Social, prompting sharp responses from Iran. The conflict has taken an overtly online dimension, marking a new phase in the ongoing diplomatic and geopolitical standoff between the two nations.

These actions, described as part of a strategic buildup, are interpreted by analysts as potential preparations for a large-scale military operation against Iran. The timing coincides with widespread protests in Iran, a deepening economic crisis, and the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a U.S. military operation\u2014an event that has heightened fears within Iran\u2019s leadership. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, view U.S. diplomacy as a cover for war planning, citing the U.S. action in Venezuela as proof of Washington\u2019s intent to destabilize regimes. Iran has responded with a new military exercise involving missile and air defense tests across major cities, including Tehran, and has issued strong warnings that all U.S. military installations in the region are legitimate targets. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also issued firm threats, stating that the U.S. and Israel will not allow Iran to rebuild its ballistic missile or nuclear programs. Experts such as Danny Citrinowicz (Institute for National Security Studies), Vali Nasr (Johns Hopkins), and Sanam Vakil (Chatham House) warn of a 'triple crisis' in Iran\u2014economic, political, and external\u2014driven by U.S.-Israel pressure. Despite the risk of war, no side appears eager for conflict: the U.S. and Israel seek to avoid escalation, while Iran, still recovering from its June 2024 12-day war with Israel, cannot afford another. However, analysts caution that a miscalculation, a perceived threat from Israel, or failure to reach a nuclear deal with the U.S. could trigger war. The article notes that Iran\u2019s alliance with Russia has provided little strategic benefit, as Moscow did not support Iran during its recent military crisis. Experts also argue that removing Khamenei may not lead to regime change, as Iran\u2019s security apparatus can absorb leadership losses. The article concludes with the view that while war is not imminent in 2026, the risk remains high due to misperception, military escalation, and lack of diplomatic progress.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 06:57 PM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/ayatollah-venimo-piglia-gli-uniti-stanno-spostando-numerosi-aerei-459643)\n\n**Iran Declares 'Total War' with U.S., Israel, and Europe Amid Escalating Geopolitical Tensions**\nIran's President Masud Pezeshkian declared on December 27, 2025, that Iran is engaged in a 'total war' with the United States, Israel, and Europe, citing a multifaceted confrontation spanning military, economic, political, cultural, and security dimensions. This statement, made in an interview published on the official website of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, reflects heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East amid international sanctions, recent military escalations, and stalled nuclear negotiations. Pezeshkian accused Washington, Tel Aviv, and European powers of attempting to isolate Iran 'on all fronts' to weaken the state and provoke internal collapse. He emphasized that the current conflict is more complex than the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, involving an integrated strategy of sustained pressure. Economic sanctions\u2014reinforced by Germany, France, and the UK after their reinstatement in late September 2025\u2014have caused the Iranian rial to lose over 24% of its value, contributing to 42% annual inflation, reduced purchasing power, and a deepening economic crisis. The conflict escalated in June 2025 during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths, including high-ranking military and scientific personnel, and extensive damage to Iranian facilities. Iran retaliated with daily missile and drone attacks on Israeli territory, killing approximately 30 people and causing significant material damage. The U.S. directly intervened by attacking Iran\u2019s three main nuclear facilities, justifying it as a measure to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear program, while Iran labeled it an act of aggression. The war led to the suspension of nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S., which remain inactive. Iran refuses to resume negotiations under U.S. conditions, which include halting uranium enrichment, limiting missile capabilities, and ending support for regional groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Tehran views these demands as excessive and sovereignty-threatening, insisting that any dialogue must begin with the lifting of sanctions and recognition of its national sovereignty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 03:25 PM\nSource:[El Tiempo](https://eltiempo.pe/internacional/iran-dice-estar-en-guerra-total-con-israel-eeuu-y-europa/)\n\n**Tensions Rise Between Iran and Israel: Why a New Confrontation Now Seems Imminent**\nTensions between Iran and Israel are escalating, with multiple political, military, economic, and security indicators converging to suggest an imminent new phase of confrontation. Since the first direct clashes five months prior, signs include heightened U.S. delivery of precision missiles to Israel, increased pressure on Lebanon to weaken Hezbollah, threatening phone calls from the U.S. Secretary of Defense to his Iraqi counterpart regarding pro-Iranian groups, and significant Iranian naval deployments in the Strait of Hormuz\u2014where nearly 20% of global oil passes. Financial markets are reacting with elevated risk premiums, as oil prices have already incorporated a $5\u201310 per barrel geopolitical risk premium, with potential to exceed $100 per barrel in case of broader conflict, triggering global inflation and economic slowdown. Iran has intensified its military modernization, including air defense systems, new fighter jets, ballistic and cyber capabilities, and continued nuclear activities, raising concerns over 408 kg of uranium enriched to 60%. Israel has expanded targeted operations against pro-Iranian networks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, while acquiring $10 billion worth of precision munitions. Internal destabilization efforts against Iran include exploiting a severe drought\u201416 dams below 10% capacity\u2014and influence campaigns. U.S. and Israeli electoral cycles in 2026, lack of progress in nuclear talks, and growing regional front-line tensions amplify the risk. Experts warn that the countdown to a major regional escalation is now active, with the likelihood of a targeted strike on Iranian facilities\u2014nuclear or military\u2014higher than in years.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:27 AM\nSource:[Tunisie Numerique](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/la-tension-monte-entre-liran-et-israel-pourquoi-une-nouvelle-confrontation-parait-desormais-imminente/)\n\n**The Countdown to 'Hour Zero': Escalating Tensions Between Iran and Israel**\nTensions between Iran and Israel have escalated again, signaling a growing likelihood of a second phase of conflict, with analysts warning of an approaching 'hour zero' for a new confrontation. Since the 12-day war in 2024, geopolitical risks have remained high, with Brent crude prices reaching $81 per barrel and the VIX fear index surging above 20 during peak tensions. Markets initially declined but recovered quickly, indicating resilience to short-term geopolitical shocks\u2014unless energy supply disruptions, such as a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, occur. Currently, Iran continues its nuclear program and prioritizes military rebuilding, maintaining a geopolitical risk premium of $5\u201310 per barrel of oil. Foreign direct investment in the Gulf has declined, and if tensions flare again, oil prices could exceed $100, driving global inflation and slowing economic growth. U.S. sensitivity to Middle East instability is evident in Donald Trump\u2019s call on Truth Social for oil producers to lower prices. Experts warn that regional escalation could trigger a sharp oil price spike and economic shock, potentially affecting midterm U.S. congressional elections. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy intercepted and detained the oil tanker 'Talara,' flying the Marshall Islands flag, signaling a strategic message to Trump and global markets. Concurrently, Israel resumed military operations against Iran-linked targets across Lebanon to Yemen, including precision airstrikes and assassination campaigns targeting senior leaders of Hezbollah and Ansar Allah. Israel has also ordered 3,000 units each of MK-82, MK-84, BLU-117, GBU-39B, DLU-109, and DLU-110 missiles, with a $10 billion deal reportedly finalized under Biden but implemented under Trump. Iran\u2019s efforts to strengthen military capabilities, including missile and defense systems like HQ-9B and Su-35s, and its opaque nuclear program\u2014particularly the unresolved fate of 408 kg of 60%-enriched uranium\u2014have fueled a renewed psychological campaign by pro-Israel media in New York, promoting narratives of Iranian vulnerability. Meanwhile, Iran faces a severe water crisis, with reservoir levels in at least 16 dams dropping below 10%, exacerbating public discontent and boosting Netanyahu\u2019s hopes of provoking internal unrest. Psychological operations, including leaks of private images and videos of Iranian military figures, are being amplified by Israeli-linked media to destabilize Iran. On the Lebanon front, Israel accuses Beirut of failing to disarm Hezbollah and has threatened to expand operations into northern Litani River region unless UN Resolution 1701 is implemented. Israel has also built a final security barrier near southern Lebanon, signaling intent to prevent Hezbollah\u2019s rearmament. The U.S. Treasury delegation recently visited Beirut and gave Lebanon 60 days to act against Hezbollah funding, marking unprecedented pressure. In Iraq, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iraqi Defense Minister Thabit al-Abassi of potential U.S. military action against a regional state if Iran-aligned militias remain active. With Netanyahu\u2019s 2026 election campaign intensifying, Iran\u2019s military modernization, nuclear ambiguity, and the unresolved 608 kg of enriched uranium, combined with stalled nuclear talks, make a new Iran-Israel confrontation increasingly probable. Iran\u2019s ongoing military upgrades, including Chinese-backed systems, further reduce the window of opportunity for Israel, accelerating the countdown to 'hour zero' for an anticipated Israeli strike on Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/opinions/2025/11/25/%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%b9%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%b1-%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d9%84%d9%84%d8%ad%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ab%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a8%d9%8a%d9%86)\n\n**Tensions Between the U.S. and Iran: Paths to Agreement or Escalation**\nThe relationship between the United States and Iran is at a critical juncture following the 12-day conflict in June 2024 between Iran and Israel, which was directly supported by the U.S. The war has reignited the central question in the region: can Washington and Tehran reach a comprehensive agreement to reduce tensions, or is the region headed toward intermittent chaos? Observers note that the ceasefire in Gaza has opened a new diplomatic window under President Donald Trump, who aims to leverage partial settlements into a broader regional deal to contain Iran. However, the current geopolitical landscape is marked by mutual distrust and conflicting interests, making any comprehensive resolution highly risky. Two divergent paths are emerging: a major agreement offering strategic and economic gains for both sides, enabling Iran\u2019s gradual reintegration into the regional order; or a 'toxic equilibrium' maintaining stagnation, suspicion, and the constant threat of military escalation. The first scenario requires Iran to significantly reduce uranium enrichment to 3.6% for civilian use, accept strict International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) oversight, and limit support for regional proxies like Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iraqi militias. In return, the U.S. would need to provide strong guarantees against unilateral withdrawal, restrict Israeli military actions against Iran, and gradually lift economic sanctions, potentially including a joint civilian nuclear project with Gulf investment\u2014previously proposed but rejected by Iran. Yet, deep mutual distrust persists: Iran views its nuclear program as a symbol of sovereignty and deterrence, while the U.S. and Israel fear high enrichment enables nuclear weapons. Despite this, analysts suggest Trump may have a unique opportunity to build a new agreement by offering concrete security and economic incentives, especially after successfully brokering the Gaza ceasefire. This could yield a major diplomatic achievement ahead of the 2028 elections. The second, more realistic scenario involves maintaining a precarious status quo\u2014ongoing sanctions, ambiguous nuclear activity, and persistent risk of military escalation. Israel may launch new strikes if Iran crosses red lines, such as blocking IAEA inspectors or restarting high-level enrichment. Iran could respond with asymmetric attacks, including cyber operations, targeting ships, and oil infrastructure in the Gulf. The U.S. faces a difficult balancing act between supporting Israel and preventing escalation. Military assessments warn renewed conflict would deplete U.S. and Israeli missile defense stocks\u2014like THAAD and Arrow systems\u2014threatening regional deterrence. Domestically, Israel faces declining reserve military participation, with only 60% of reservists attending training by mid-2025, signaling growing societal and military fatigue. Meanwhile, Iran has restructured its military institutions post-June war by establishing a National Defense Council to accelerate wartime decision-making, signaling readiness for renewed conflict. Senior advisors to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader have declared that 'Iran is not in a ceasefire, but in an open war,' indicating a strategic shift toward full confrontation. Ongoing tensions threaten international economic interests, particularly in energy and trade, with potential disruptions to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. Gulf states are increasingly concerned that a new U.S.-Iran war could spill into their territories or destabilize their economies, especially after June\u2019s war, when Iranian missiles landed near Doha. Key possible scenarios include: a major peaceful agreement limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear program and enabling gradual economic integration; a toxic equilibrium maintaining suspicion and intermittent conflict; a new large-scale military confrontation or partial collapse of Iran\u2019s regime; or a flexible regional settlement based on multilateral security guarantees led by the U.S.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.alwatan.com.sa/article/1172577)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
