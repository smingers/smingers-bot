(d) Justification Factors:

- Domestic Iranian Unrest
- Regional Proxy Conflicts
- US Military Positioning
- Diplomatic Isolation of Iran

Outside view calibration:
- Multiple sources suggest high tension but low immediate intervention probability
- US military build-up indicates preparedness, not guaranteed action
- Diplomatic channels remain partially open
- Regional allies reluctant to support direct confrontation

Consideration of Expert Perspectives:
- Military experts suggest high-risk environment
- Diplomatic sources indicate preference for sanctions over direct conflict
- No unanimous expert consensus on imminent military intervention

Outside View Prediction:
[17%]

Rationale: 
- Significant tensions exist
- Low probability of full-scale military intervention
- Higher likelihood of continued diplomatic pressure and limited strikes
- Reference class of historical US-Iran interactions suggests restraint
- Regional diplomatic complexities reduce intervention likelihood

The 17% reflects a nuanced assessment of the high-tension environment while acknowledging the substantial barriers to direct military conflict before April 2026.
