Weak Evidence:
- Social media provocations
- Speculative opinion pieces about potential conflict

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction window: Approximately 2 months (until April 2026)
- Current timeframe suggests high tension but low immediate conflict probability
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease due to less time for escalation
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase due to prolonged tension and potential miscalculation

(d) Justification Factors:
Key Escalation Indicators:
1. Military Positioning: USS Abraham Lincoln deployment
2. Domestic Iranian Unrest: Protests, potential regime instability
3. Diplomatic Breakdown: Collapsed nuclear negotiations
4. Rhetorical Escalation: Trump's provocative statements

Mitigating Factors:
1. Economic Constraints
2. Potential Diplomatic Channels
3. Regional Complexity
4. Domestic Political Considerations

Probability calibration:
Considering the complex geopolitical landscape, multiple sources suggest high tension but significant barriers to direct military intervention. The analysis points to a nuanced scenario with potential for escalation but not outright conflict.

Checklist:
1. Prediction: Will US militarily attack Iran before April 2026?
2. Base Rate: Initially estimated at 17%
3. Consistency Check: 17/100 times, US attacks Iran before April 2026
4. Key Evidence:
   - USS Lincoln carrier deployment
   - Iranian domestic unrest
   - Diplomatic tension breakdown
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected regional incident triggering immediate conflict
6. Status Quo: Continued diplomatic tension without direct military action

Probability: 22%

The slight increase from the outside view prediction reflects the recent military positioning and rhetorical escalation, while maintaining a cautious assessment of the significant barriers to direct military intervention.
