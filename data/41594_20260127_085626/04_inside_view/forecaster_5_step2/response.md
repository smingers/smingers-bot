- Trump's explicit military threat statements
- Ongoing Iranian nuclear program tensions
- Significant domestic unrest in Iran

Moderate Evidence:
- Iranian military preparedness warnings
- Regional proxy positioning (Hezbollah statements)
- Diplomatic backchannel communications

Weak Evidence:
- Social media rhetoric
- Propaganda posters
- Speculative media commentary

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: Approximately 2 months (until April 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease to ~10%
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase to ~25%

(d) Justification Factors:
1. Military Positioning
- US carrier group strategically positioned
- Trump's explicit military threat rhetoric
- Iran's defensive military posturing

2. Nuclear Program Tensions
- Iran's continued uranium enrichment
- Unresolved IAEA compliance issues
- Historical US red lines on nuclear capabilities

3. Domestic Iranian Context
- Significant internal protests
- Economic instability
- Potential regime vulnerability

Probability calibration:
- Base rate of US-Iran direct military confrontation: Historically low
- Current tension level: Exceptionally high
- Miscalculation risk: Significant
- Diplomatic channels: Partially open but strained

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will US militarily attack Iran before April 2026?
2. Base rate: Historically <10% probability of direct conflict
3. Consistency: 17/100 times, US would attack Iran
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier group deployment
   - Trump's explicit military threats
   - Iranian nuclear tensions
5. Blind spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough
6. Status quo: Maintained diplomatic tension without direct conflict

Probability: 17%
