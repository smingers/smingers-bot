- Distinguishing Facts from Opinions: Balanced reporting with clear sourcing

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- USS Abraham Lincoln carrier deployment (multiple sources confirm)
- Ongoing Iranian domestic unrest
- Trump's willingness to consider military action
- Existing tensions from previous limited conflict

Moderate Evidence:
- Iran-backed militia warnings
- Israeli military preparations
- Diplomatic tensions

Weak Evidence:
- Inflammatory rhetoric
- Speculative media interpretations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 2 months (until April 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease due to less time for escalation
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase due to potential accumulation of tensions

(d) Justification:
Key Escalation Factors:
1. Military positioning (USS Abraham Lincoln)
2. Ongoing Iranian domestic instability
3. Previous limited conflict precedent
4. Trump's assertive foreign policy stance

De-escalation Factors:
1. UAE's explicit non-involvement stance
2. Economic constraints
3. Lack of broader regional support
4. Diplomatic channels still open

Probability calibration:
- Outside view base rate: 17%
- Current evidence suggests slight increase in tension
- Careful consideration of potential unintended consequences
- Maintaining skepticism about full-scale conflict

Checklist:
1. Resolution: Will US attack Iran before April 2026? Specific military engagement criteria.
2. Base rate consistency: Anchored to historical precedent of controlled confrontation
3. Consistency check: 17/100 times, US would launch a full military attack
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier group deployment
   - Ongoing Iranian domestic unrest
   - Previous limited conflict
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or sudden regime change
6. Status quo tendency: Favors diplomatic tension over full military engagement

Probability: 22%

Rationale for Slight Increase:
- Marginal increase from base rate due to:
  1. Active military positioning
  2. Ongoing tensions
  3. Trump's assertive posture
- Still maintains low probability of full-scale conflict
- Accounts for potential unexpected escalation while remaining conservative
