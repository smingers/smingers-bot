- Reflects historical pattern of tension without full-scale war

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: ~2 months remaining until April 2026

(d) Justification Factors:
- High tension but strategic restraint from both sides
- Economic and diplomatic costs of full-scale war
- Diplomatic channels still partially open
- Internal challenges within Iran
- US presidential election dynamics

Outside View Calibration:
- Sources suggest high tension but low probability of full-scale war
- Military strikes are possible but total conflict unlikely
- Need to distinguish between limited strikes and comprehensive attack
- Probability should reflect nuanced geopolitical complexity

Calibration Considerations:
- June 2025 strikes provide recent precedent
- Gulf states' airspace restrictions complicate US military options
- Iran's demonstrated restraint in previous confrontations
- Diplomatic and economic consequences of full-scale war

Outside View Prediction:
27%

Rationale: This prediction reflects the high tension but strategic calculations preventing full-scale conflict. It acknowledges the possibility of limited military action while recognizing the significant barriers to comprehensive war. The 27% captures the complex geopolitical dynamics, recent historical patterns, and the specific constraints facing both the US and Iran in early 2026.
