Most Suitable Reference Class: Historical US-Iran Confrontations
- Provides direct contextual precedents
- Captures specific bilateral dynamics
- Accounts for escalation patterns

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 2 months (January 27, 2026 to April 1, 2026)
- Historical Pattern: Rapid escalation possible within weeks
- Previous Conflict Durations: Typically 1-3 weeks of active engagement

(d) Justification Factors:
- High military tensions
- Ongoing nuclear program disputes
- Demonstrated willingness to use military force
- Complex regional dynamics
- Economic and diplomatic pressures

Outside view calibration:
- Sources suggest high tension but low probability of full-scale war
- Military positioning indicates preparedness but not inevitable conflict
- Diplomatic channels still partially open
- Potential for miscalculation exists

Calibration Considerations:
- June 2025 strikes provide recent precedent
- US demonstrated limited surgical strike capability
- Iran's response historically measured
- Economic consequences heavily discourage full conflict

Outside View Prediction:
27% probability of United States attacking Iran before April 2026

Rationale:
- Surgical strike more likely than full invasion
- Recent historical precedent of limited interventions
- Strong deterrence factors
- Diplomatic channels not completely exhausted
- Regional power dynamics discourage total war

Confidence Level: Moderate (reflects complexity and uncertainty of geopolitical predictions)
