Weak Evidence:
- Provocative murals and rhetorical threats
- Speculative articles about potential conflict scenarios

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 2 months until April 2026
- If timeframe halved (1 month): Slightly lower probability due to reduced strategic planning time
- If timeframe doubled (4 months): Potentially higher probability due to increased diplomatic tensions and strategic maneuvering

(d) Justification Factors:
- Recent limited conflict in June 2025 suggests controlled engagement
- Significant internal challenges in Iran
- Strategic restraint from regional actors
- Economic and diplomatic costs of full-scale war
- US election year dynamics

Probability calibration:
Adjusting from the outside view prediction of 27%, considering:
- Increased military positioning (+5%)
- Explicit militia warnings (+3%)
- Diplomatic constraints (-2%)
- Internal Iranian instability (-3%)

Checklist:
1. Question: Will the US attack Iran before April 2026? Specific criteria of military engagement to be evaluated.
2. Base rate: 27% from outside view analysis
3. Consistency check: 27 out of 100 times, US would attack Iran
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier strike group positioned
   - Iran-backed militia warnings
   - Recent limited conflict precedent
5. Blind spot: Unexpected escalation from minor incident
6. Status quo: Diplomatic tension without full military engagement

Probability: 30%
