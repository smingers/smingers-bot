(d) Justification Factors:
- Diplomatic constraints limit full-scale attack
- Economic and political costs of direct confrontation

- Ongoing protest dynamics in Iran
- Nuclear program tensions

Probability Calibration:
- Outside view base rate: 17%

2. Base rate consistency: Rooted in historical US-Iran conflict patterns
3. Consistency check: 17/100 times, US would launch full attack
4. Key Evidence:

   - Protest-related tensions
   - Previous limited military engagement
5. Blind spot: Unexpected major provocation or regime change scenario
