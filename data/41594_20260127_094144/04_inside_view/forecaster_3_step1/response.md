(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential Reference Classes:

2. US-Iran Proxy Conflicts
3. Nuclear Proliferation Confrontations
4. Regional Geopolitical Tensions

Most Suitable Reference Class: US-Iran Proxy Conflicts
- Demonstrates consistent pattern of indirect confrontation
- Avoids direct military engagement
- Reflects complex diplomatic maneuvering

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 2 months remaining (until April 2026)
- Historical Pattern: US-Iran tensions typically escalate through proxy actions rather than direct confrontation
- Recent Conflict Intensity: High (multiple military exchanges in 2024-2025)

(d) Justification Factors:
- Regional diplomatic constraints
- Economic limitations
- Domestic political considerations
- Potential for proxy warfare
- Nuclear program tensions

Outside View Calibration:
- Multiple sources suggest high tension but low direct conflict probability
- Regional powers actively discourage direct confrontation
- Economic and diplomatic costs of direct conflict are prohibitive
- Proxy warfare more likely than direct military engagement

Outside View Prediction:
17% probability of United States attacking Iran before April 2026

Rationale:
- Tensions are extremely high
- Multiple diplomatic restrictions exist
- Proxy conflict more strategically advantageous
- Limited direct military intervention more probable than full-scale attack
- Considers complex geopolitical constraints

The 17% reflects a non-trivial but unlikely scenario, accounting for unexpected escalation while recognizing substantial barriers to direct military confrontation.
