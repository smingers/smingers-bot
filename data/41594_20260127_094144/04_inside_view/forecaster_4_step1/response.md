4. Nuclear proliferation confrontations

Most Suitable Reference Class: US-Iran conflict escalations since 1979
- Characterized by diplomatic tensions, proxy conflicts
- Rare direct military confrontations
- High rhetorical escalation, low actual warfare probability

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 2 months remaining (until April 2026)
- Historical Pattern: Typically, US-Iran tensions resolve through diplomatic channels
- Recent Escalation: Increased military posturing, but strategic restraint evident

(d) Justification:
Key Mitigating Factors:
- Regional powers blocking direct conflict
- Economic constraints
- Domestic instability in Iran
- Diplomatic communication channels remain open

Key Escalation Factors:
- Trump's aggressive posture
- Iranian nuclear program advancement

- Historical precedent shows diplomatic resolution preference
- Expert opinions suggest strategic restraint

Outside View Prediction:
17% probability of US attacking Iran before April 2026

Rationale: Moderate probability reflecting high tensions but strong structural barriers to direct conflict. The prediction accounts for military posturing, diplomatic channels, and historical conflict resolution patterns.
