Probability calibration:
Carefully weighing the evidence, the current situation presents a complex geopolitical landscape. While tensions are extremely high, the historical pattern suggests diplomatic alternatives and strategic restraint.

The previous outside view prediction of 17% remains appropriate, with slight adjustment to 19% considering the most recent escalatory rhetoric and military positioning.

Checklist:
1. Prediction: Will US attack Iran before April 2026? Binary outcome within specified timeframe.
2. Base rate consistently applied from previous analysis
3. 19/100 times, US would attack Iran under current circumstances
4. Key evidence:
   - Aircraft carrier deployment
   - Ongoing protest tensions
   - Previous limited military engagement
5. Blind spot: Unexpected escalatory event triggering immediate conflict
6. Status quo leans towards diplomatic tension rather than direct military action

Probability: 19%
