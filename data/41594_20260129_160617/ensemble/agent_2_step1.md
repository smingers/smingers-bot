2. US-Iran Conflict Scenarios
3. Geopolitical Confrontations with Nuclear Powers

Most Suitable Reference Class: US Military Interventions in Middle East
- Demonstrates historical reluctance for full-scale military engagements
- Shows preference for economic pressure and targeted actions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: January 29, 2026 to April 1, 2026 (approximately 2 months)
- Historical Pattern: US tends to exhaust diplomatic and economic options before military action
- Recent Context: Targeted strikes in June 2025, but no full-scale invasion

(d) Justification:
Key factors influencing prediction:
- Diplomatic alternatives available
- High potential for unintended escalation
- Market and regional actor preferences for de-escalation
- Domestic political considerations
- Complexity of Iranian internal situation

Outside view calibration:
- Market signals suggest low probability of military intervention
- Expert opinions emphasize risks of direct conflict
- Historical precedent shows preference for alternative strategies
- Specific constraints (regime stability, regional dynamics) reduce likelihood

Considerations:
- Precise probability difficult to determine
- Sources suggest less than 50% likelihood
- Market pricing suggests even lower probability

Outside View Prediction:
15%

Rationale:
- Accounts for existing tensions
- Reflects low but non-zero probability of military action
- Considers complex geopolitical landscape
- Aligns with expert and market assessments of intervention risks

The prediction deliberately avoids extreme positions, recognizing the inherent uncertainty in geopolitical forecasting.
