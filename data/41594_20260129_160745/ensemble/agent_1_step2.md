- Iranian threats of retaliation
- Economic sanctions as alternative intervention method

Weak Evidence:

- Unnamed source predictions
- Short-term rhetorical escalations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: 2 months (Jan 29, 2026 - Apr 1, 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease due to reduced escalation potential
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase due to prolonged diplomatic tensions

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Military Preparedness: Significant asset deployment suggests readiness
2. Diplomatic Breakdown: Failed nuclear negotiations
3. Domestic Iranian Instability: Ongoing protests weakening regime
4. Trump's Aggressive Rhetoric: Explicit consideration of military action

Calibration Methodology:
- Baseline historical intervention probability
- Current geopolitical temperature
- Diplomatic communication channels
- Economic alternative strategies

Probability calibration:
Carefully weighing the evidence, current tensions, and historical patterns of U.S. intervention, the probability requires nuanced consideration. The military assets and rhetoric suggest heightened tension, but structural barriers to intervention remain significant.

Checklist:
1. Prediction: Will US militarily attack Iran before April 2026?
2. Base Rate: Previously established at 7%
3. Consistency Check: 7/100 times, a military strike occurs
4. Key Evidence:
   - Carrier strike group deployed
   - Trump's explicit military option considerations
   - Ongoing Iranian protests
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or sudden regime change
6. Status Quo: Maintained diplomatic tension without direct military action

Probability: 12%

Rationale: Slight increase from outside view prediction, reflecting current tensions and military positioning, but maintaining skepticism about full-scale military intervention due to significant diplomatic and strategic constraints.
