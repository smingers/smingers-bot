6. Agent Report (Credibility: Medium)
- Comprehensive geopolitical analysis
- Synthesizes multiple sources
- Provides structured potential intervention scenarios

(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential Reference Classes:

2. US-Iran Conflict Historical Patterns

3. Middle East Regional Conflict Escalations
- Israel-Hamas conflicts
- Saudi-Yemen conflict

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 2 months (January 29, 2026 to April 1, 2026)
- Historical Pattern: US interventions typically involve months of escalation
- Typical Intervention Preparation: 3-6 months of diplomatic and military buildup

(d) Justification Factors:
- Current military deployments suggest heightened tensions
- Economic sanctions creating pressure
- Domestic unrest in Iran
- Nuclear program concerns
- Limited diplomatic channels
- Potential regime change motivations

Outside View Calibration:
- Historical US intervention frequency: Moderate
- Current geopolitical tension level: High
- Diplomatic off-ramps: Limited
- Military preparedness: Significant
- Domestic political considerations: Mixed

Calibration Anchor Points:
- Expert sources suggest "managed tension"
- Agent report indicates intervention as "last resort"
- Multiple sources highlight complexity and restraint

Outside View Prediction:
17%

Rationale: While tensions are high, full-scale military intervention remains unlikely due to:
1. Diplomatic constraints
2. War fatigue
3. Complex regional dynamics
4. Potential for unintended escalation

The 17% reflects a non-negligible but not highly probable scenario of military action, accounting for current geopolitical volatility while recognizing significant barriers to direct conflict.
