(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: January 29, 2026 to April 1, 2026 (2 months)
- If timeframe halved: Probability would likely decrease to 10-12%
- If timeframe doubled: Probability might increase to 22-25%

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Prediction:
1. Significant military positioning suggests preparation
2. Diplomatic tensions and protest context create intervention environment
3. Structural constraints (international support, military limitations) reduce likelihood

Calibration shifts outside view from 17% to a more nuanced prediction considering current complexities.

Probability calibration:
- Considered multiple intervention scenarios
- Weighted military, diplomatic, and structural constraints
- Maintained skepticism about full-scale military intervention

Checklist:
1. Resolution: US military attack on Iran before April 2026

4. Key Evidence:
   - Military asset deployment
   - Ongoing nuclear tensions
   - Domestic Iranian unrest
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected escalatory event triggering immediate conflict
