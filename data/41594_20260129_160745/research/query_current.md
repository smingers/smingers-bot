Analysis:
The forecasting question centers on the potential for a U.S. military strike against Iran before April 2026, given recent heightened tensions. Key contextual elements include the Israel-Iran war in June 2025, ongoing protests in Iran, U.S. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric, and the possibility of U.S. intervention. The most relevant current information would focus on:

1. U.S. military preparedness and strategic discussions about potential strikes
2. Diplomatic tensions and statements from U.S. and Iranian leadership
3. Ongoing domestic situation in Iran and international reactions
4. Assessment of military capabilities and potential intervention scenarios

The Sentinel forecasting team's estimate of a 59% chance of U.S. strikes suggests significant perceived probability of military action. The recent Israeli attack, U.S. involvement in bombing Iranian nuclear sites, and Trump's provocative statements about Iran's leadership create a volatile geopolitical environment.
