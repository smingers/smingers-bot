Analysis:
The forecasting question centers on the potential for a U.S. military attack on Iran before April 2026, against a backdrop of escalating tensions. The background suggests several key contextual factors: historical U.S.-Iran animosity, recent Israeli-Iranian conflict, ongoing internal Iranian protests, and Trump's aggressive stance toward Iran. To generate an outside view, we need to understand:

1. Historical precedents of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East
2. Current geopolitical tensions and diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran
3. Domestic political dynamics in both the U.S. and Iran that might influence military decision-making
4. International community's potential response to a potential U.S. attack

The goal is to gather information that can help assess the probability of military action, looking beyond the specific scenario to broader patterns of international conflict and intervention.
