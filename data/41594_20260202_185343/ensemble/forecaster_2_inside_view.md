Moderate Evidence:
- Trump's aggressive rhetoric and ultimatum-style communications
- Iranian military preparedness and counter-threat messaging

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative articles about potential regime change
- Unconfirmed anonymous source predictions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 2 months (until April 2026)
- If timeframe halved (1 month): Probability might decrease due to less time for escalation
- If timeframe doubled (4 months): Probability might increase due to potential accumulation of tensions

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
- Unprecedented military positioning
- High-tension diplomatic environment
- Trump's known aggressive foreign policy approach
- Iranian internal instability
- Ongoing nuclear program tensions

Probability calibration:
The current circumstances demonstrate significant deviation from historical reference classes, particularly the Trump administration's unconventional approach to foreign policy and the unique internal dynamics in Iran.

The military positioning, diplomatic rhetoric, and geopolitical tensions suggest a higher probability of limited military action compared to previous periods.

Checklist:
1. Question: Will US militarily attack Iran's territory before April 2026?
2. Base Rate: Previously established at 37%
3. Consistency Check: 37 out of 100 times, a US attack on Iran occurs
4. Key Evidence:
   - US military fleet positioning
   - Trump's aggressive diplomatic stance
   - Iranian internal protests
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough
6. Status Quo: Maintains tension without full-scale attack

Probability: 45%
