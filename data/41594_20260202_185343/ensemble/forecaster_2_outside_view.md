- Provides historical precedent for intervention patterns

- Historical Pattern: US interventions typically involve:

  * Economic sanctions
  * Military positioning
  * Potential limited surgical strikes

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Influencing Prediction:
1. Current Geopolitical Tensions
- Ongoing Iranian protests
- US military positioning
- Trump administration's aggressive stance
- Iranian nuclear program concerns

2. Structural Constraints
- Limited US appetite for full-scale war
- Economic and diplomatic alternatives
- International diplomatic pressures

3. Escalation Indicators
- Increasing military rhetoric
- USS Abraham Lincoln deployment
- Targeted sanctions
- Potential regime change objectives

Outside View Calibration:
- Multiple sources suggest high tension but low probability of full-scale attack
- Foreign Affairs suggests limited strikes already occurred (June 2025)
- Diplomatic channels partially open
- Risk of miscalculation exists

Probability Considerations:
- Full-scale invasion: Very low (< 5%)
- Limited surgical strikes: Moderate probability
- Economic/diplomatic pressure: High probability

Outside View Prediction:
17%

Rationale: The prediction reflects a moderate probability of limited military action, accounting for current tensions, historical intervention patterns, and diplomatic constraints. The 17% represents a nuanced assessment of potential limited strikes or targeted interventions, rather than a full-scale war.
