- US military positioning air defense systems in Middle East
- Trump's explicit ultimatum to Iran for nuclear negotiations

Moderate Evidence:
- Iranian military preparedness and drone development
- Ongoing domestic protests in Iran
- Diplomatic channels still partially open

Weak Evidence:
- Social media statements from politicians
- Speculative articles about potential attack scenarios

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: Approximately 2 months (until April 2026)
- If timeframe halved (1 month): Lower probability due to less diplomatic maneuvering
- If timeframe doubled (4 months): Higher probability due to potential escalation

(d) Justification:
Factors increasing attack probability:
- Trump's assertive foreign policy
- US military positioning
- Iranian internal instability

Factors decreasing attack probability:
- Significant diplomatic risks
- Potential regional destabilization
- Lack of clear international support

Probability calibration:
- Base rate for Middle East interventions: Low
- Current tension multiplier: Moderate
- Diplomatic off-ramps: Significant

Checklist:
1. Question: Will US militarily attack Iran's territory before April 2026?
2. Base rate: Previously established at 17%
3. Consistency Check: 17/100 times, US attacks Iran before April 2026
4. Key Evidence:
- Carrier group deployment
- Trump's military ultimatum
- Iranian internal protests
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough
6. Status Quo: Continued tensions without direct military conflict

Probability: 23%

The slight increase from the outside view (17%) reflects the current heightened tensions and military positioning, but still maintains a fundamentally low probability of direct military intervention.
