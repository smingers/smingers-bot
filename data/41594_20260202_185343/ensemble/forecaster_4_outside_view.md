(d) Justification:
Key Factors:
- Ongoing Iranian internal protests
- Economic pressure on Iran
- Trump's aggressive foreign policy stance
- Military positioning in the region
- Nuclear program tensions

Integrative Analysis:
The sources suggest a high-tension environment with potential for limited military action, but full-scale attack seems less likely due to:
- Diplomatic constraints
- Regional instability
- Potential for unintended escalation

Outside view calibration:
- Sources indicate significant tension
- Military positioning suggests preparedness
- Explicit threats from both sides
- Historical precedent of limited interventions
- Constraints on full-scale war

Consideration of probabilities from sources:
- Foreign Affairs article suggests high tension
- Guardian article implies imminent risk
- Iran International highlights rhetorical escalation

Outside View Prediction:
37%

Rationale: Reflects high tensions, military positioning, and Trump's aggressive stance, while accounting for diplomatic constraints and potential de-escalation mechanisms. The prediction acknowledges the significant probability of limited strikes or confrontations without committing to a full-scale war.
