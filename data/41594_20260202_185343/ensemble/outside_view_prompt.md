Historical context:

<Summary source="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/highlights-experts-discuss-the-first-ever-us-military-intervention-in-the-middle-east/">
Summary of Brookings Article:

Key Points:
1. The article discusses a Brookings event examining the first U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, specifically focusing on President Eisenhower's 1958 decision to send Marines to the region.

2. Experts Bruce Riedel and Suzanne Maloney discussed:
- The changing nature of U.S. engagement in the Middle East
- Recent events suggesting a potential reduced commitment to the region (e.g., muted response to Iranian attacks on Saudi Arabia, troop withdrawal from Syria)
- The historical context of U.S. military involvement

3. The discussion highlighted:
- The importance of understanding past policy decisions
- The complex political landscape of the Middle East
- The role of ideologies like Arab nationalism
- The challenge of balancing patience and action in foreign policy

Relevance to the Forecast Question:
While the article does not directly address the potential for a U.S. attack on Iran, it provides context about U.S. military decision-making in the Middle East. However, the content is from 2019 and primarily historical, so its direct predictive value for a 2026 scenario is limited.

Note: The article appears to be more of a retrospective discussion about historical U.S. military intervention rather than a forward-looking analysis of potential future conflicts.

Summary of "America's Middle East Scorecard: Many Interventions, Few Successes" (NPR, 2014):

Key Points:
1. The U.S. has been involved in eight Middle Eastern countries from Libya to Pakistan, opposing Islamists in each.

2. Despite various approaches (major wars, airstrikes, diplomacy, sanctions), the U.S. has not achieved a clear success in the region.

3. Critiques of U.S. policy include:
- George W. Bush's overreach in waging two simultaneous wars
- Barack Obama's perceived hesitancy to act
- The possibility that the region's upheaval is beyond any outside power's control

Regional Assessments:
- Iraq: After decades of involvement, little tangible progress; current focus on combating Islamic State
- Syria: Complex situation with no clear appealing options
- Afghanistan/Pakistan: Uncertain stability after U.S. troop withdrawal
- Israel/Palestinians: Continued conflict despite U.S. mediation attempts
- Egypt: Ongoing challenges in promoting regional freedoms

Expert Quotes:
- Steven Cook (Council on Foreign Relations): Until Arabs determine their own identity and desired countries, Washington can do little to help.
- Roger Cohen (New York Times): Obama has "undersold the nation" and created doubts about American power.

The article portrays U.S. Middle East interventions as complex, largely unsuccessful, and fraught with challenges.

Comprehensive Strategic Assessment of US-Iran Military Scenarios and Geopolitical Tensions in 2026

Geopolitical Context and Internal Iranian Dynamics:
Iran is experiencing a critical period of internal instability characterized by three interconnected crises: economic hardship, legitimacy challenges, and leadership succession uncertainty. According to the Steptoe strategic assessment, Iran's economic situation has dramatically deteriorated, with GDP per capita falling from $11,000 in 1990 to approximately $5,000 in 2026. Inflation has consistently remained around 50%, and poverty rates have doubled to nearly 30% of the population.

The nationwide protests that began in late December 2025 represent the most significant internal challenge to the Islamic Republic since its establishment. These demonstrations, initially sparked by economic grievances, quickly transformed into broader political demands challenging the regime's fundamental legitimacy. The government's response has been exceptionally violent, with thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested.

US Military and Diplomatic Strategy:
President Donald Trump has adopted a nuanced approach combining diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and military signaling. Key strategic elements include:

1. Military Positioning
- Deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Middle East
- Positioning of additional combat aircraft, armored units, and air-defense systems across regional bases
- Maintaining a posture of readiness without explicit commitment to full-scale intervention

2. Diplomatic Pressure
- Suspension of planned US-Iran negotiations
- Proposed 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran
- Public warnings about potential military action
- Encouraging protesters and highlighting regime repression

Potential US Intervention Scenarios:
According to the Washington Institute, Trump is considering multiple intervention options:

1. Targeted Strikes
- Decapitation strikes against IRGC leadership
- Attacks on nuclear research facilities
- Strikes on security force headquarters
- Targeting critical infrastructure

2. Regime Change Considerations
- Potential elimination of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
- Exploiting potential succession crisis
- Encouraging internal fragmentation

Iranian Response Capabilities:
Iran's potential retaliation options include:
- Attacks on US regional bases
- Strikes against Israel
- Closure of the Strait of Hormuz
- Mobilization of regional proxy forces
- Potential missile and drone attacks

Diplomatic and International Constraints:
Multiple sources highlight significant constraints on US military intervention:
- Risk of broader regional conflict
- Limited US operational capacity following Gaza ceasefire
- European hesitation about direct military action
- Potential unintended consequences of regime change

Key Challenges and Uncertainties:
1. Lack of viable Iranian opposition leadership
2. Risk of IRGC takeover if regime collapses
3. Potential consolidation of regime support through external threats
4. Complex regional power dynamics

Potential Outcomes:
- Negotiated concessions from Iran
- Limited surgical strikes
- Extended diplomatic pressure
- Prolonged regional instability

Recommendation:
The most prudent approach appears to be a measured combination of economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and strategic military signaling, avoiding direct large-scale military intervention.

Limitations and Uncertainties:
- Rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape
- Unpredictable Iranian regime response
- Potential for unintended escalation

Conclusion:
The US faces a complex strategic challenge requiring nuanced, multi-dimensional approach balancing military readiness, diplomatic pressure, and careful risk management.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
