Iran has responded to the European Union's designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization by declaring EU armed forces terrorist entities, with Iranian Parliament speaker Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf stating that 'the consequences of these decisions will lie entirely on the EU.' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized Iran's readiness for war, warning that any aggressor risks triggering a regional conflict, while affirming Iran's non-aggressive stance: 'We do not wish to oppress anyone, but those who attack us will face a powerful response.' Meanwhile, the U.S. is actively preparing for potential retaliation: the Pentagon has deployed additional Patriot and THAAD air defense systems in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar\u2014costly deployments indicating a high likelihood of conflict. U.S. Navy assets are also positioned near Israel and Iran, including ships in the Gulf of Aqaba, Eastern Mediterranean, and northern Arabian Sea. The article outlines three potential scenarios: (1) a favorable nuclear deal for the U.S. under Donald Trump\u2014considered unlikely due to lack of trust in Iran; (2) limited airstrikes on sensitive Iranian targets\u2014expected to yield minimal results and possibly suppress domestic protests; and (3) a full-scale Iranian retaliation, possibly leading to a U.S. military escalation, with the risk of a prolonged and devastating regional war. The article further draws parallels between U.S. and Iranian actions, noting that while the U.S. accuses Iran of killing up to 3,000 protesters, American immigration and customs enforcement has also killed two U.S. citizens\u2014Rene Nicole Good and Alex Pretti\u2014during raids, sparking nationwide protests and a partial government shutdown. The article warns that a second Trump presidency may deepen America\u2019s national divide, potentially leading to a 'cold' civil war, due to reckless and poorly considered policies.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:11 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/55984208-ostalos-menshe-48-chasov-tri-stsenariya-voyny-s-iranom-pochemu-dlya-ssha-net-horoshego-varianta/)\n\n**Wall Street Journal: U.S. Must Strengthen Air Defense Before Attacking Iran**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, the United States must strengthen its air defense systems in the Middle East before launching any potential strike against Iran. The report, published on February 1, 2026, states that the Pentagon is currently in the process of deploying additional air defense systems\u2014specifically, high-altitude THAAD batteries and Patriot missile systems\u2014to better protect U.S. forces, Israel, and Arab allies in case of retaliation or a prolonged conflict. Although the U.S. could execute a 'limited airstrike' against Iran if President Donald Trump issued an order today, officials believe the country is not yet adequately prepared to withstand potential retaliatory attacks. Satellite imagery confirms that the Pentagon has not yet completed the deployment of these systems in key U.S. military bases across the region, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Susan Maloney, a former U.S. State Department official on Iran policy, emphasized that air defense readiness is critical to protecting U.S. troops and assets from possible Iranian retaliation. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Washington is negotiating with Tehran but expressed pessimism about reaching a positive outcome. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that any U.S. attack on Iran would trigger a regional war. Iran claims the U.S. uses sanctions, pressure, and unrest to justify foreign intervention and aims to change its regime, threatening a 'comprehensive and unprecedented' response to any attack, even a 'limited' one. Israel and the U.S. accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, including electricity generation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:21 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A/%D9%88%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/3817310)\n\n**WSJ: U.S. Will Not Launch Attack on Iran Until This Is Completed**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing government sources, the United States will not launch an attack on Iran until additional air defense systems are deployed across the Middle East. The Pentagon is reinforcing its defensive posture by deploying additional THAAD and Patriot missile defense systems to bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The U.S. has also sent three squadrons of F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, capable of intercepting drones, following Iran\u2019s April 2024 drone and missile attack on Israel. The U.S. Navy has increased its fleet of interceptors in the region to eight destroyers, with two in the Strait of Hormuz, three north of the Arabian Sea, one in the Red Sea near Israel, and two east of the Mediterranean. These actions follow heightened tensions beginning in early January 2026, when former President Donald Trump threatened military intervention over anti-government protests in Iran. Although protests were later suppressed, Washington renewed threats citing Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. On Tuesday, the U.S. president announced a 'marvelous fleet' was heading toward Iran, shortly after the USS Abraham Lincoln and its combat group were deployed to the region. Iran has warned that any military action would be seen as the start of war and declared its forces are 'ready, with fingers on the trigger,' to respond immediately and forcefully. However, Iran also expressed willingness to engage in 'dialogue based on respect and mutual interests.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:06 PM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/585030-explicar-ataque-eeuu-iran-inminente)\n\n**Wall Street Journal: U.S. Temporarily Holds Off Airstrikes on Iran, Bolsters Air Defenses in Middle East**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing multiple U.S. officials, an airstrike on Iran is not currently imminent as the Pentagon is reinforcing air defense systems across the Middle East to better protect Israel, Arab allies, and U.S. military personnel in the event of Iranian retaliation or a prolonged conflict. While U.S. military forces could conduct limited strikes if President Trump ordered them today, Trump has instead instructed the military to prepare for decisive attacks\u2014likely triggering Iranian responses\u2014necessitating the pre-deployment of robust air defense systems. The U.S. has deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile batteries and Patriot air defense systems to key bases in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. THAAD is designed to intercept ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, while Patriot systems defend against shorter-range, lower-altitude threats. The U.S. Central Command declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal. Additionally, three F-15E fighter squadrons have been deployed to Jordan, capable of engaging Iranian drones\u2014similar to their role during Iran\u2019s April 2024 aerial attack on Israel. The U.S. Navy has also moved several missile-equipped destroyers to the region, with eight currently positioned to intercept Iranian missiles and drones: two near the Strait of Hormuz, three in the northern Arabian Sea, one in the Red Sea near Israel, and two in the eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, six F-35 fighter jets from the Vermont National Guard were observed landing in the Azores, Portugal, on February 29, 2026, moving closer to the Middle East. These jets previously participated in an operation to capture Venezuela\u2019s former leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Meanwhile, several EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft have departed Puerto Rico and arrived in Spain.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:29 PM\nSource:[\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u62a5](https://www.sinchew.com.my/news/20260201/international/7236752)\n\n**Trump Confirms U.S.-Iran Talks Aiming for 'Satisfactory Agreement' Amid Escalating Tensions**\nU.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the United States is engaged in serious negotiations with Iran, aiming to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement to ensure Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons. On January 31, 2026, Trump stated during an interview on Air Force One that the U.S. is in 'serious talks' with Iran and emphasized the need for a deal acceptable to both sides. He refused to disclose final decisions on military action but said a 'very strong fleet' is en route to Iran. Trump warned that the previous failed negotiations led to the U.S. bombing Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. He also stated that the U.S. did not inform its Middle East allies of any potential strike plans for security reasons. Iran, facing international pressure due to its crackdown on anti-government protests, has signaled willingness to negotiate, with Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council Secretary, Ali Shamkhani, stating that the negotiation framework is gradually taking shape. Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that a larger-scale conflict would harm both Iran and the U.S., emphasizing diplomacy as the preferred option. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stated that any U.S. attack would trigger a regional war and that Iran would respond forcefully. Regional actors are also involved: Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Mohammed held talks with Shamkhani to de-escalate tensions, while Yemen\u2019s Houthi political official Asad warned that Houthi forces are on high alert and would target U.S. and Israeli military assets in the region if conflict erupts. The current standoff follows years of strained relations: the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in 2018, reimposed sanctions, and conducted five rounds of indirect talks with Iran, which were canceled after Israel\u2019s April 2025 strike on Iran, triggering a 12-day conflict that included U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The EU Foreign Ministers, on February 29, 2026, voted to designate Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. Iran responded by declaring European military forces as terrorist entities and warning the EU of consequences. The situation remains highly volatile with significant regional and global implications.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:39 PM\nSource:[\u65e9\u62a5](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/world/story20260201-8256204)\n\n**Khamenei warns US of 'regional war' if Iran is attacked**\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned the United States on February 1, 2026, that any attack on Iran would trigger a 'regional war,' speaking during the anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s return from exile in 1979. His remarks came amid heightened tensions following the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, jet fighters, and navy destroyers to the Middle East, coinciding with widespread antigovernment protests in January 2026 that began over the collapse of the Iranian rial and escalated into a direct challenge to Khamenei\u2019s rule. Iranian state media reported 3,117 deaths during the unrest, including 2,427 civilians and security personnel, though US-based rights groups claim over 6,000 were killed\u2014figures Al Jazeera could not independently verify. Khamenei labeled the protests a 'coup' orchestrated by foreign agents, accusing demonstrators of attacking police, government centers, Revolutionary Guard facilities, banks, mosques, and burning copies of the Quran. The US, under President Donald Trump, has repeatedly threatened military action, initially linking it to Iran\u2019s treatment of protesters, then shifting focus to securing a nuclear deal. Indirect talks between Iranian and American officials occurred in Oman in June 2025 before Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran, during which the US joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite aggressive rhetoric, both nations have confirmed open communication channels to prevent military conflict. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Iran was 'seriously talking' with Washington, while Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani affirmed Tehran\u2019s readiness for negotiations. Trump emphasized that Iran should agree to a deal with 'no nuclear weapons,' though he expressed uncertainty about whether Tehran would accept such terms, adding, 'But they are talking to us.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:28 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked)\n\n**Will the United States Attack Iran? With Trump, Anything Is Possible**\nThe article raises the question of whether the United States will attack Iran, citing the extraordinary concentration of American military forces in the Persian Gulf. It notes that the U.S. press is discussing multiple potential scenarios under consideration by the President, including decapitating the regime, destroying nuclear facilities and missile bases, and targeting the Revolutionary Guard. The article does not confirm any imminent attack, nor does it provide evidence of a decision being made. The topic is presented as a matter of speculation and ongoing discussion within U.S. media and political circles as of February 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2026/02/01/opiniao/opiniao/estados-unidos-vao-atacar-irao-trump-possivel-2163182)\n\n**Trump Says U.S.-Iran Negotiations Are Underway**\nOn January 31, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that Iran is currently negotiating with the United States, saying, 'Let's see if we can make progress; if not, we'll see what happens next.' Trump noted that the previous round of negotiations failed, resulting in the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities. He also confirmed that the U.S. will not inform its Gulf allies about any potential military plans against Iran. On the same day, Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary and Supreme Leader's adviser Ali Shamkhani posted on social media, stating, 'Contrary to the media atmosphere created artificially, the negotiation framework is gradually taking shape,' a statement widely interpreted by international media as indicating progress toward renewed U.S.-Iran talks. The U.S. has been increasing pressure on Iran by deploying multiple warships, including aircraft carriers, in the Middle East. The U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed and expanded sanctions. Since April 2025, Iran and the U.S. have held five rounds of indirect negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the lifting of sanctions. The sixth round, originally scheduled for June 15, 2025, was canceled due to Israel\u2019s surprise attack on Iran. During the 12-day conflict, the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities, leading to a complete halt in negotiations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 11:53 PM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](http://world.people.com.cn/n1/2026/0201/c1002-40657067.html)\n\n**Is a U.S. Military Strike on Iran Imminent? Report Suggests Plan to Topple the Regime**\nA report published on January 31, 2026, by Merkur.de suggests that a U.S. military strike against Iran may be imminent, citing unconfirmed claims from anonymous sources within the U.S. Department of Defense that the attack could occur as early as Sunday, January 31, 2026. The article states that Donald Trump's administration is reportedly focused not on Iran's nuclear or missile programs, but on toppling the Iranian regime, with the belief that a U.S. military intervention could reignite domestic protests and lead to regime change. The USS Abraham Lincoln and ten other warships are positioned in the Persian Gulf, but military analysts suggest this visible fleet may be a diversion. The real attack could involve B-2 stealth bombers, similar to the 2025 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' which destroyed underground nuclear facilities in Fordow and Natanz using 14 bunker-busting bombs. According to WION News, the bombers may have secretly deployed from Missouri via the Atlantic, avoiding detection while the Lincoln fleet draws attention. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. would act in self-defense if there were evidence of an imminent attack on American troops, with approximately 30,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in eight to nine facilities within range of Iranian missiles. Trump warned on Truth Social that 'the next attack will be much worse' and urged negotiations on a nuclear deal or face a repeat of 'Operation Midnight Hammer.' Forbes identifies potential targets as leadership centers around Ayatollah Khamenei, remaining nuclear facilities, and Revolutionary Guard command centers. The B-2 bombers are the only aircraft capable of carrying bunker-busting bombs that can penetrate 90 meters of rock and concrete. Iran has responded with defiance, threatening retaliation 'like never before,' though experts question Iran\u2019s capabilities after the 2025 losses. The prolonged presence of the Lincoln fleet without action is seen as a psychological warfare tactic, keeping Iran\u2019s air defenses in constant alert. Sources cited include the Council on Foreign Relations, WION News, Forbes, DPA, and AFP.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 04:18 AM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/ein-ablenkungsmanoever-mit-bombern-gegen-den-iran-nutzt-die-usa-94146312.html)\n\n**U.S. Gives Iran Ultimatum to Reach Nuclear Deal Before Possible Attack**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on January 30, 2026, that he has issued an ultimatum to Iran to reach a nuclear agreement before a potential military attack, following the recent deployment of a U.S. naval fleet in the region. Trump stated he has directly communicated with Tehran but provided no further details, saying, 'Only they know for sure.' Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, expressed willingness to negotiate, but only if Washington abandons 'unilateral demands' and addresses Iran's 'legitimate concerns.' Araqchi rejected negotiations based on 'threats, intimidation, and unilateral and illegitimate demands,' calling such approaches unacceptable. Iran has previously refused to engage in new talks without security guarantees, citing Israel\u2019s military offensive in June 2025 amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, which was effectively nullified after the U.S. withdrawal during Trump\u2019s first term.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:12 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-eeuu-da-ultimatum-iran-alcanzar-acuerdo-programa-nuclear-antes-posible-ataque-20260130201232.html)\n\n**Iran's Army Chief Vows 'Crushing Retaliation' Amid U.S. Threats**\nOn January 29, 2026, Iranian Army Chief General Amir Hatami declared before state television that Iran is prepared for a 'crushing retaliation' against repeated threats of U.S. military intervention. This statement followed President Donald Trump\u2019s warning that 'time is running out' before a potential U.S. attack, which he described as 'worse' than the June 2025 strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Hatami stated that combat regiments have been equipped with 1,000 strategic drones, developed in cooperation between the military and the Ministry of Defense, based on lessons from the 12-day war with Israel in June 2025. The army's priority, according to Hatami, is to strengthen strategic capabilities for a swift and overwhelming response to any invasion or attack. Iran has also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz\u2014a critical global chokepoint for oil and liquefied natural gas transport\u2014citing its right under the Islamic Republic. The pro-government newspaper Kayhan argued that 'if the enemy brandishes a sword, we will not greet them with a diplomatic smile.'

He cited the need for adequate resources in the region and preparedness to defend against potential retaliation from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as key factors. This follows President Donald Trump\u2019s earlier warnings that the U.S. would strike Iran if Iranian authorities began killing protesters, stating, 'If they do, we will hit them very hard. They know, and have been told very clearly \u2014 even more firmly than I am telling you now \u2014 that if they do, they will pay a hell of a price.' Trump also expressed support for Iranian protesters, saying, 'Iran is seeking freedom, perhaps never before,' and affirmed that the U.S. is ready to help. The U.S. Department of State reportedly circulated a 'collage' of threats against Iran. In response, Iran\u2019s Parliament spokesperson Mohammad Qalibaf warned that any U.S. attack would trigger a military response against Israel and U.S. bases in the region, rejecting passive defense. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused foreign-linked 'terrorists' of killing civilians, burning mosques, and attacking public property, while affirming the government\u2019s willingness to listen to citizens and urging them to avoid 'troublemakers and terrorists.' Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Al\u00ed Larijani claimed the country is 'in the middle of a war' and blamed 'foreign currents' for inciting violent protests, describing demonstrators as a 'near-terrorist urban group.' Iran\u2019s Defense Council issued a statement on Tuesday warning that continued hostile conduct and 'threatening, interventionist rhetoric' would be met with a 'proportional, firm, and decisive response.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 02:06 AM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/581674-haremos-pronto-multimillonario-asegura-hay-certeza-ataque-eeuu-iran)\n\n**Israel May Be Preparing for a New Attack on Iran Before 2026, Warns Baghdad Al-Youm**\nThe Iraqi newspaper 'Baghdad Al-Youm', citing regional political and security indicators and a significant increase in U.S. military support to Israel, warned on November 30, 2025, of the possibility of a new Israeli attack on Iran before the end of 2025. According to Iranian sources cited by the publication, the United States has upgraded the quality of weapons supplied to Israel and is accelerating deliveries under a $10 billion contract, including advanced penetrating munitions and interception systems. These measures are interpreted as practical preparations by Israel for a second phase of attacks, whether limited or widespread. At the same time, Washington is increasing pressure on Beirut to disarm Hezbollah, with informal demands for action within 60 days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly conveyed during a visit to Baghdad that any response by Iraqi groups to a potential attack on Iran would face unprecedented retaliation. The newspaper suggests a possible offensive could occur before year-end, with indications that the next conflict would be more extensive and complex than the prior 12-day war. Israel is concerned that delaying action would give Iran more time to address vulnerabilities exposed in the earlier conflict. Iranian former President Hassan Rouhani warned of a weakened regional deterrent capability, stating that Iran currently lacks 'broad deterrent capacity' and that neighboring countries\u2014Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan\u2014have their airspace effectively under U.S. and Israeli control. He emphasized that the 12-day conflict was technologically driven, not conventional, and stressed the need for accurate self-assessment of Iran\u2019s strength relative to Israel\u2019s advanced capabilities. Rouhani cautioned against deception in evaluating enemy power, stating, 'The greatest betrayal to leaders is to make reality seem smaller or greater than it is,' and warned, 'We have strong and dangerous enemies.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 08:22 AM\nSource:[Euronews Espa\u00f1ol](http://es.euronews.com/2025/11/30/israel-se-estaria-preparando-para-volver-a-atacar-iran-por-aire-antes-de-fin-de-ano)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
