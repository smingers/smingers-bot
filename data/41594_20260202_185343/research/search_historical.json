The article discusses a Brookings event examining the first U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, specifically focusing on President Eisenhower's 1958 decision to send Marines to the region.\n\n2. Experts Bruce Riedel and Suzanne Maloney discussed:\n- The changing nature of U.S. engagement in the Middle East\n- Recent events suggesting a potential reduced commitment to the region (e.g., muted response to Iranian attacks on Saudi Arabia, troop withdrawal from Syria)\n- The historical context of U.S. military involvement\n\n3. The discussion highlighted:\n- The importance of understanding past policy decisions\n- The complex political landscape of the Middle East\n- The role of ideologies like Arab nationalism\n- The challenge of balancing patience and action in foreign policy\n\nRelevance to the Forecast Question:\nWhile the article does not directly address the potential for a U.S. attack on Iran, it provides context about U.S. military decision-making in the Middle East. However, the content is from 2019 and primarily historical, so its direct predictive value for a 2026 scenario is limited.\n\nNote: The article appears to be more of a retrospective discussion about historical U.S. military intervention rather than a forward-looking analysis of potential future conflicts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.socialistalternative.org/no-to-bushs-war-on-iraq/a-brief-history-of-us-interventions-in-the-middle-east-1949-2002/\">\nDisclaimer: The provided article is a historical account of US interventions in the Middle East from 1949-2002, and does not directly address the forecast question about a potential US attack on Iran in 2026.

According to the Steptoe strategic assessment, Iran's economic situation has dramatically deteriorated, with GDP per capita falling from $11,000 in 1990 to approximately $5,000 in 2026. Inflation has consistently remained around 50%, and poverty rates have doubled to nearly 30% of the population.\n\nThe nationwide protests that began in late December 2025 represent the most significant internal challenge to the Islamic Republic since its establishment. These demonstrations, initially sparked by economic grievances, quickly transformed into broader political demands challenging the regime's fundamental legitimacy. The government's response has been exceptionally violent, with thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested.\n\nUS Military and Diplomatic Strategy:\nPresident Donald Trump has adopted a nuanced approach combining diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and military signaling. Key strategic elements include:\n\n1. Military Positioning\n- Deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Middle East\n- Positioning of additional combat aircraft, armored units, and air-defense systems across regional bases\n- Maintaining a posture of readiness without explicit commitment to full-scale intervention\n\n2. Diplomatic Pressure\n- Suspension of planned US-Iran negotiations\n- Proposed 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran\n- Public warnings about potential military action\n- Encouraging protesters and highlighting regime repression\n\nPotential US Intervention Scenarios:\nAccording to the Washington Institute, Trump is considering multiple intervention options:\n\n1. Targeted Strikes\n- Decapitation strikes against IRGC leadership\n- Attacks on nuclear research facilities\n- Strikes on security force headquarters\n- Targeting critical infrastructure\n\n2. Regime Change Considerations\n- Potential elimination of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\n- Exploiting potential succession crisis\n- Encouraging internal fragmentation\n\nIranian Response Capabilities:\nIran's potential retaliation options include:\n- Attacks on US regional bases\n- Strikes against Israel\n- Closure of the Strait of Hormuz\n- Mobilization of regional proxy forces\n- Potential missile and drone attacks\n\nDiplomatic and International Constraints:\nMultiple sources highlight significant constraints on US military intervention:\n- Risk of broader regional conflict\n- Limited US operational capacity following Gaza ceasefire\n- European hesitation about direct military action\n- Potential unintended consequences of regime change\n\nKey Challenges and Uncertainties:\n1. Lack of viable Iranian opposition leadership\n2. Risk of IRGC takeover if regime collapses\n3. Potential consolidation of regime support through external threats\n4. Complex regional power dynamics\n\nPotential Outcomes:\n- Negotiated concessions from Iran\n- Limited surgical strikes\n- Extended diplomatic pressure\n- Prolonged regional instability\n\nRecommendation:\nThe most prudent approach appears to be a measured combination of economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and strategic military signaling, avoiding direct large-scale military intervention.\n\nLimitations and Uncertainties:\n- Rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape\n- Unpredictable Iranian regime response\n- Potential for unintended escalation\n\nConclusion:\nThe US faces a complex strategic challenge requiring nuanced, multi-dimensional approach balancing military readiness, diplomatic pressure, and careful risk management.</Agent_report>\n"
