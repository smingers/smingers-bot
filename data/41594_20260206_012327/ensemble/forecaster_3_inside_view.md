Analysis:
### 1) Resolution criteria / paraphrase
Resolves **Yes** if **before 1 Apr 2026** the US conducts a **military attack** on **Iranian territory** or **Iranian military personnel**, per credible sources.

### 2) (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality/date)
**The War Zone (TWZ), Feb 5, 2026 (Altman)**  
- **What it says (facts):** US-Iran talks slated Feb 6 in Oman; outlines a reported framework (via Al Jazeera) involving temporary zero enrichment and removal of HEU stockpile; quotes Trump/Rubio/Leavitt; reports Iranian military threats; notes Iran hardening nuclear sites; reports Israel urging strikes and close US-Israel coordination.  
- **What it says (judgment):** “last-ditch” framing; emphasis on “preparing for war.”  
- **Quality:** Generally strong on military posture details; still a **single-article synthesis** with some secondhand reporting. **Current-day**.

**NPR, Feb 5, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Trump threatening action “with speed and violence” absent a deal; talks appear to be happening.  
- **Quality:** NPR is high-quality, but this extract reads like a **program preview**, light on detail. **Moderate** evidentiary weight.

**BBC scenario article, Jan 29, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Describes US force buildup; discusses plausible retaliation pathways (bases, shipping, mining Hormuz, etc.).  
- **Judgment:** “US appears poised to strike within days” is **interpretive**; scenario set is exploratory, not a forecast.  
- **Quality:** BBC is credible, but this piece is **scenario analysis**; moderate weight.

**DefenseScoop, Feb 4, 2026**  
- **Facts:** US F-35 shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone approaching USS *Abraham Lincoln*; IRGC harassment of US-flagged tanker; de-escalation; diplomacy still scheduled; quotes Atlantic Council fellow Plitsas.  
- **Quality:** Credible defense outlet; **specific incident reporting**. Strong for “tensions high,” weaker for “war likely.”

**Defense Security Monitor, Nov 13, 2025**  
- **Facts:** Pentagon budget/shutdown impacts.  
- **Relevance:** Minimal to near-term strike decision. Low weight.

**Middle East Monitor, Jan 30, 2026 (Crooke claim)**  
- **Content:** Single commentator claims about Pentagon debate and Iran’s capabilities.  
- **Quality:** Advocacy-ish outlet; not independently verified; treat as **weak**.

**AskNews / AFP explainer, Feb 5, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Confirms Oman talks; rehearses long-run hostility and June 2025 US strikes; notes US “armada.”  
- **Quality:** AFP is highly credible; mostly background. Moderate.

**AskNews / Valor Econômico explainer, Feb 5, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Agenda dispute (US wants missiles/proxies/human rights; Iran wants nuclear-only); confirms key attendees; describes missile arsenal and proxy issues.  
- **Quality:** Mainstream business press; largely compilation; moderate.

**AskNews / News18, Feb 5, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Iran confirms indirect talks in Muscat; insists nuclear-only/sanctions removal.  
- **Quality:** Secondary outlet likely sourcing Iranian statements/wires; moderate.

**AskNews / Xinhua, Feb 5, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Similar: talks; agenda gap; US deployments; risk if talks stall.  
- **Quality:** State media with potential framing; factual portions often usable. Moderate-to-weak.

**AskNews / Asharq Al-Awsat, Feb 4, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Talks Friday; Iran claims thousands killed; US represented by Witkoff; Kushner possibly attends.  
- **Quality:** Regional outlet with sources; moderate.

**AskNews / AFP analysis on US-Israel divergence, Feb 4, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Notes Israel wants overthrow/dismantlement; suggests Trump wants avoid prolonged war; includes named experts/poll.  
- **Quality:** AFP + named analysts/polling = good. Moderate-strong.

**AskNews / TEMPO/Anadolu citing Axios, Feb 4, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Reports US officials saying Israel wants strike, Trump “not there” and “really does not want to do it.”  
- **Quality:** The key is **Axios sourcing** (usually decent) but still anonymous officials and republished through other outlets. Moderate-strong but not definitive.

**AskNews / Responsible Statecraft, Feb 3, 2026**  
- **Content:** Argument against war; skepticism about casus belli.  
- **Quality:** Opinion/advocacy; useful for mapping arguments, not for probability. Weak.

**AskNews / Reuters-like item via Times of Israel, Feb 3, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Trump warns “bad things”; Iran considering enrichment flexibility/HEU transfer (attributed to Iranian officials); says Khamenei worried strike could topple regime.  
- **Quality:** ToI is mixed, but this reads wire-sourced; if truly Reuters-based, useful. As provided, treat as moderate.

**AskNews / WSJ summary in Anadolu & RT Español, Feb 1, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Claim: US won’t strike until additional THAAD/Patriot/force protection deployed; details on deployments.  
- **Quality:** WSJ is strong; Anadolu/RT are secondary carriers. Net: moderate-strong that **US is prioritizing defense posture first**.

**AskNews / Al Jazeera, Feb 1, 2026**  
- **Facts:** Khamenei warning; acknowledges both sides keeping channels open; recounts protests and military posture.  
- **Quality:** Credible; moderate.

### 3) (b) Evidence analysis with weights (what moves the needle)
**Strong evidence (bigger shifts)**
1) **Active, imminent diplomacy (Feb 6 Oman talks) confirmed across multiple outlets** (TWZ, AFP, Al Jazeera, Asharq Al-Awsat, others).  
   - Mechanism: talk initiation/continuation generally **reduces near-term strike probability** (leaders pay reputational cost for striking mid-process unless provoked).  
   - Direction: **Down**.

2) **US force-protection sequencing: reports US “will not attack until air defenses in region strengthened” (WSJ-cited)**.  
   - Mechanism: implies **delay gate**; with only ~55 days left, delays matter.  
   - Direction: **Down (near-term)**, though not down overall if deployments complete soon.

3) **US–Israel divergence + reported Trump reluctance (“really does not want to do it”)** (Axios-cited via TEMPO/Anadolu; AFP analysis).  
   - Mechanism: reduces probability of discretionary offensive action absent a trigger.  
   - Direction: **Down**.

**Moderate evidence (medium shifts)**
4) **Recent kinetic incidents at sea (drone shot down; tanker harassment)** (DefenseScoop).  
   - Mechanism: increases odds of miscalculation/retaliation spiral; also increases political pressure to “restore deterrence.”  
   - Direction: **Up**, but note US framed as self-defense and then de-escalated.

5) **Negotiating-position gap (Iran nuclear-only; US wants missiles/proxies/human rights)** (TWZ, Rubio quotes, multiple explainers).  
   - Mechanism: higher chance talks fail → higher chance of coercive action.  
   - Direction: **Up (via failure risk)**.

**Weak evidence (small shifts)**
6) **Media “poised to strike within days” / scenario lists** (BBC) and single-expert capability takes (Middle East Monitor/Crooke).  
   - Direction: slight **Up** for “mood music,” but low reliability for timing.

### 4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** From **Feb 5, 2026 to Apr 1, 2026 = 55 days**.
- **If timeframe were halved (~27 days):** Diplomacy + defense-posture gating would loom larger → probability would drop meaningfully (fewer windows for talks to fail + decision + execution).
- **If timeframe were doubled (~110 days):** More time for talks to stall, for a triggering incident, or for Israel/Iran escalation → probability would rise (more opportunity cycles).

### 5) (d) Justification: updating the 32% outside view to an inside view
**Baseline (outside view): 32%.**

Key inside-view pushes **down**:
- **Broad confirmation that talks are actually happening immediately (Feb 6)** and are being treated as a real off-ramp by multiple parties. Even if “last-ditch,” the existence of a diplomatic channel usually reduces the chance of an attack *during the next few weeks*, which is a big chunk of a 55-day horizon.
- **Reported US sequencing constraint (air defenses not yet fully in place)** suggests the US is not optimized for immediate action and is wary of Iranian retaliation. With a short deadline, any “wait until X is deployed” is material.
- **Reported Trump reluctance vs Israeli pressure** makes “discretionary” strikes less likely; increases conditionality on a trigger (talks collapse + provocation).

Key pushes **up / keeps substantial risk**:
- **High operational tempo and close encounters** (drone/tanker) increase the fat-tail risk of an incident that forces escalation.
- **Big negotiating gap** raises the chance of failure; and Trump’s rhetoric implies he wants leverage and is willing to use force if he judges talks are a stalling tactic.

Net: These largely **offset**, but the diplomacy + sequencing constraint slightly dominate in a short 55-day window. So I nudge **down modestly** from 32%.

Probability calibration:
- Start from outside view **32%**.
- **-4 pp** for (i) near-term diplomacy being real and imminent across sources, and (ii) “not until defenses deployed” acting as a timing gate in a short window.
- **+2 pp** for recent kinetic incidents and the miscalculation tail-risk.
- **Net inside-view forecast: 30%**.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: **By Apr 1, 2026, will US militarily attack Iranian territory or Iranian military personnel (per credible sources)?**
2) Outside view base rate: **32%**.
3) Consistency line: **30 out of 100** times, the US conducts such an attack before Apr 1, 2026.
4) Top evidence (most important):
   - Confirmed **Feb 6 Oman talks** (multiple credible outlets).
   - **WSJ-cited** reporting: US prioritizing **air defenses/force protection** before any strike.
   - **Drone shootdown/tanker incident** shows elevated friction and accident risk.
   - **Agenda mismatch** makes talks fragile.
   - **Axios/AFP**-reported **Trump reluctance vs Israeli pressure**.
5) Blind spot: A **single deadly incident** (Iran hits US troops/ship; or Israel strikes and Iran retaliates) could force rapid US escalation, making 30% too low.
6) Status quo outcome: Default is **continued coercive diplomacy + deterrence posture** without crossing into a fresh US attack; that modestly favors **No** in a 55-day window.

Probability: 30%
