Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, ↑ = higher weight)

• DefenseScoop 4 Feb 26 – F-35C downs Iranian Shahed-139 near USS Abraham Lincoln; IRGC gunboats harass U.S. tanker. Mostly factual, on-the-record DoD release. Direct indicator of hair-trigger environment. ↑ (Strong factual)

• War Zone 5 Feb 26 – Describes 6 Feb Oman talks; quotes Trump, Rubio, IRGC generals; details Iranian site hardening, U.S./Israeli coordination. Authoritative on ­posture imagery, but mixes fact & analysis. ↑

• NPR 5 Feb 26 – Quotes Trump: “speed and violence” if no deal. Credible but short; adds little unique data. → (Moderate)

• BBC 29 Jan 26 – Scenario piece on possible consequences of a U.S. strike. Mostly analysis, no new facts. Good for incentives but light evidentiary weight. ↓

• Middle East Monitor 30 Jan 26 – One ex-diplomat claiming Iran could overwhelm Israel. Single opinion, unverified. ↓

• WSJ via Anadolu 1 Feb 26 – U.S. rushing THAAD/Patriot before any strike; officials say “not ready today.” Reliable (WSJ) but secondary re-tell. ↑

• AFP / AskNews package 3-5 Feb 26 – Confirms Oman talks, Israeli pressure, U.S. reluctance, regional shuttle diplomacy. Wire services, factual. ↑

• RT/Responsible Statecraft/Lenta etc. – Mostly commentary or Russian/Iranian perspectives; useful for narrative but speculative. ↓

2. Evidence analysis (relative to ≥ 1 Apr 26 cutoff)

Strong evidence (large shifts)

• Imminent Oman negotiation (multiple wires). Talks usually suppress immediate kinetics unless they collapse spectacularly (historical 2015, 2019 Gulf crises). Pushes probability down.

• Pentagon still deploying air-defence cover (WSJ). Shows U.S. preference to finish force-protection first; large strikes unlikely until assets in place. Lowers near-term risk.

Moderate evidence (medium shifts)

• Large U.S. carrier/air build-up + drone shoot-down. Demonstrates readiness and willingness to use force if triggered. Raises probability.

• Explicit Trump threats (“much worse than 2025”). Presidential signalling can precede real action (e.g., Jan 2020 Soleimani), but not always (North Korea 2017). Raises probability modestly.

• Israeli lobbying for strikes but U.S. official “president not there” (Axios/AFP). Suggests internal split; tempers risk.

Weak evidence (small shifts)

• Speculative analyst pieces declaring strike “very high” or spring 2026 window (Economist quote via Lenta). Single unnamed sources.

• Iranian bellicose rhetoric (“regional war”). Standard deterrent talk; historically poor predictor.

3. Timeframe analysis

Window remaining: 55 days. If the window were halved to ≈28 days, my probability would drop about one-third (fewer days for talks to fail/cycle). If doubled to 110 days, I would add ~10 pp because force-protection deployments would likely be complete, increasing viable strike window.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view anchor (crises where U.S. carried out ≥1 strike on Iranian territory/personnel within 2 months): ≈ 25-30 %.  
Key current factors:

• Negotiations scheduled – historically, the U.S. rarely initiates fresh strikes while a formal round is still live (Iraq 1998 and Libya 2011 exceptions after collapse). −7 pp.

• Force-protection not yet complete – officials openly say “not ready today”. −3 pp.

• Trump rhetoric & visible military power – raises chance he will pull trigger if talks fail abruptly. +6 pp.

• Recent kinetic contact (drone) – shows escalation ladder is already climbing; miscalculation risk. +4 pp.

Net shift: +0 pp overall → inside-view 30 - 35 %.

Probability calibration
Taking midpoint with slight skew toward “No” given diplomatic momentum: 35 %.

Checklist:
1. Will U.S. conduct a military attack on Iranian territory or personnel before 1 Apr 26?  
2. Base-rate 33 % (crisis-conditional).  
3. “35 of 100 times, an attack occurs in next 55 days” – consistent.  
4. a) Oman talks tomorrow, b) U.S. still installing THAAD/Patriot, c) Lincoln drone shoot-down, d) Trump public threats, e) Israeli pressure vs U.S. reluctance.  
5. Blind-spot: A large Iranian provocation (e.g., killing U.S. troops in Iraq) could prompt rapid U.S. retaliation sooner than force-protection finished, pushing Yes >60 %.  
6. Status-quo = no strike; short window and active talks favour inertia.

Probability: 35%
