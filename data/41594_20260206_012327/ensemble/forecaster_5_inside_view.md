Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, 26 Jan – 5 Feb 2026)  
1. WSJ 1 Feb 2026 – Factual: Pentagon rushing extra THAAD/Patriot, strike “unlikely until complete”. Identifiable U.S. officials quoted.  High credibility, current.  
2. Khamenei speech 1 Feb (Al Jazeera) – Factual quotes; opinion = Iranian propaganda. Useful for red-line clarity, not for U.S. intent.  
3. Axios/Anadolu 4 Feb – Factual on Israeli lobbying & U.S. internal reluctance, citing senior U.S. official: “president really does not want to do it.”  Medium reliability.  
4. DefenseScoop 4 Feb – Confirmed drone shoot-down and IRGC harassment. Primary DoD statements & photos.  High reliability.  
5. TWZ & AFP 5 Feb – Factual: Oman talks 6 Feb, details of draft nuclear framework, hostile statements from both sides, current force disposition.  High credibility.  
6. BBC 29 Jan – Scenario piece, largely opinion.  Retained as qualitative background only.  
7. Sentinel crowd estimate 59 % (quoted 21 Jan) – Aggregated forecasts, useful market signal, not a primary fact source.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight against resolution criterion “U.S. carries out military attack on Iranian territory/personnel before 1 Apr 2026”)

Strong-positive  
• Large, already-deployed carrier strike group, bombers pre-positioned (multiple independent outlets).  
• President Trump’s repeated public threats of a “far worse” strike if no deal (NYT, TWZ).  Clear causal channel.

Moderate-positive  
• Israeli political and military pressure for U.S. action (Axios, AFP).  
• Escalatory minor clashes at sea (DefenseScoop) increasing accident risk.

Strong-negative  
• WSJ: Pentagon states extra air defences must be in place first; work still underway.  Structural, hard-to-compress timeline.  
• Credible reports of Trump’s reluctance to start a major war (Axios quoting senior U.S. official).

Moderate-negative  
• Oman talks scheduled for 6 Feb with draft that would freeze enrichment; even a partial deal would pause strike decision for weeks.  
• Gulf allies (Saudi, UAE) signaling no support for large war (Lenta, RT-ES report).

Weak (noise / small shift)  
• Iranian threats of all-out retaliation (routine).  
• Opinion scenarios in BBC piece.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days to deadline: 56.  Historical “decision-to-strike” windows once build-up/ultimatum peak average ≈14 days; risk therefore front-loaded.  If the window were halved (to 28 days) I would raise the probability ~+7 pp (fewer chances for talks).  If doubled (to 112 days) I would cut ~-15 pp (forces redeploy, U.S. domestic politics shift).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view anchor (class: carrier on station + explicit threats + last-chance talks) = 70 %.

Downward pressures  
– Logistics: air-defence deployment not yet ready (strong, −8 pp).  
– Documented Trump reluctance and election-year aversion to messy war (moderate, −5 pp).  
– Scheduled Oman negotiation with a plausible face-saving “freeze for freeze” deal that would buy 90 days (moderate, −5 pp).

Upward pressures  
+ Fresh drone incident & harassment show hair-trigger environment (moderate, +4 pp).  
+ Israeli lobbying and internal U.S. hawks continue (moderate, +4 pp).  
+ Massive protests and humanitarian framing give White House an additional public justification (weak-moderate, +2 pp).

Net shift: −8 pp.  70 % → 62 %.  Rounded for clarity and calibration: 60 %.

Probability calibration

“I expect that roughly 60 times out of 100 in comparable situations, the United States would conduct at least one kinetic strike on Iranian territory before 1 April 2026.”

Checklist:  
1. Title paraphrase: “Will the U.S. fire on Iran before 1 Apr 2026?” ✔  
2. Outside base: 70 %.  Final forecast rooted & adjusted. ✔  
3. Consistency line: 60/100 times a U.S. attack occurs in next 56 days. ✔  
4. Top evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • Pentagon says extra air-defence needed before strike.  
   • Oman talks with draft zero-enrichment deal 6 Feb.  
   • Carrier group plus Trump threats already in theatre.  
   • Axios: senior official says Trump “really doesn’t want to”.  
   • IRGC drone shot-down near USS Lincoln. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden large Iranian provocation (e.g., deadly attack on U.S. troops) could force rapid retaliation and push odds >90 %. ✔  
6. Status quo pull: Last major strike only 8 months ago; inertia plus diplomacy could keep shooting war on hold. ✔

Probability: 60%
