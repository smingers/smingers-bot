Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. The Guardian (05 Feb 2026, Patrick Wintour)  
   • Facts: recap of June-25 war, size of protests, economic collapse, upcoming US-Iran meeting.  
   • Opinions: quotations from think-tank fellow, Rubio, Iranian dissidents. Mostly well-sourced mainstream outlet; factual chronology is reliable, policy speculation is opinion.

2. Al Jazeera (29 Jan 2026, Shola Lawal)  
   • Facts: current US force-posture (carrier, destroyers, regional bases), description of June-25 strike package.  
   • Opinions: unnamed analysts say build-up “could indicate” strikes. AJ’s military data are usually solid; anonymous speculation low weight.

3. Institute for the Study of War update (05 Feb 2026)  
   • Facts: scheduling of 6 Feb Oman talks, Iranian negotiating positions, Iranian public warnings.  
   • Opinions: ISW assessment that inflexibility “reduces the likelihood” of diplomacy. ISW is a policy NGO with decent track-record; factual nuggets on talks credible.

4. New York Post letters (05 Feb 2026)  
   • Pure public opinion, no verifiable fact. Negligible evidentiary value.

5. New York Times (29 Jan 2026, Steven Erlanger)  
   • Facts: Trump quotations, explicit threats, reminder of June-25 precedent.  
   • Opinions: Expert Ali Vaez doubts an attack. NYT standards give high confidence in quotations; analytical passages weighed but not data.

6. NBC News (14 Jan 2026)  
   • Facts: partial evacuation of Al Udeid, portfolio of military options presented to Trump.  
   • Opinions: suggested motivation is deterrence of executions. NBC’s sourcing (U.S. officials) has decent record on troop-movement stories.

7. Agent report (synthesised open sources to 05 Feb 2026)  
   • Facts: consolidated timeline, ORBAT, official statements. Provides cross-citations; useful factual digest but not an independent primary source.  

Overall: Hard data (troop movements, scheduled talks, direct presidential threats) come from NYT, NBC, Al Jazeera, ISW; these carry the most weight. Opinion pieces and letters are noise.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
1. Any two-month window in which the US has mounted overt kinetic action against the sovereign territory of another state since 1979. (≈20 such actions / 282 two-month windows ⇒ base ≈7%).  
2. Two-month windows immediately following a prior US strike on that same state. Only two historical precedents (Iraq 1998 after 1991, Syria 2018 after 2017) → repeat-strike within 12 months happened once out of two ⇒ 50% over 12 mths; scaled to 2 mths ≈9%.  
3. Two-month windows when a US carrier strike group is on station, the President has issued public threats, and negotiations are underway. Rough historical matches: Libya 1986, Iraq 1990, Iraq 1998, Syria 2013, Syria 2018; attacks occurred in 3 of 5 ⇒ 60% over roughly 1-month decision windows.  

Class 3 is narrow but maps best to current conditions (visible force, explicit threats, last-chance diplomacy). It is chosen as the anchor.

C. Time-frame analysis  
• Days left until resolution: 56.  
• Historically, for the five class-3 cases, decisions to strike (or abort) came ≤14 days after peak signalling. Therefore the relevant hazard is front-loaded; probability decays if nothing happens by mid-March.

D. Justification for outside-view number  
Starting with class-3 base 60% for a one-month window. Adjustments:  
– Long-run US aversion to a second Iran strike so soon after June-25 (-10 pts).  
– Risk of wider Gulf war and election-year blow-back (-5 pts).  
+ Trump’s demonstrated willingness to use limited force (Venezuela 2026, Iran 2025) (+5 pts).  
+ Substantial ready forces already deployed (+5 pts).  
Time-dilution: we have a 56-day window, roughly twice the typical decision window; but hazard is not linear (if no strike by mid-Feb probability falls sharply). Net effect multiplies by ~1.3.  

Computed outside-view probability ≈ (60 − 10 − 5 + 5 + 5) × 1.3 ≈ 71% → round to 70%.

Cross-check with published crowd estimate (Sentinel 59%). Outside view lands slightly higher because the reference class contains more “go” than “no-go” outcomes once a carrier, threats and last-chance talks coincide.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor value (class-3)   ………………60%  
Contextual adjustments   ………………-5% (net)  
Time-window stretch factor ………………× 1.3  
Raw result       ………………~71%  
Recognising model uncertainty (±10 pts), centre at 70% with 5-point slack gives a well-calibrated outside estimate.

Outside View Prediction:
70 % chance that the United States will attack Iran before 1 April 2026.
