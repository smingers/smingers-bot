You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Question background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

# Summary of "Iran is betting that Trump does not have a plan for regime change"

**Source:** The Guardian, February 05, 2026, by Patrick Wintour

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Israeli-Iran War (June 2025):** During the 12-day conflict, over 30 Iranian military commanders were killed and 160 strikes were conducted on Iranian military targets
- **US Strikes (June 22):** The US used B-2 bombers and 30 Tomahawk missiles to hit Iran's three major nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz, described as "eviscerating its nuclear programme"
- **Economic Impact:** Since June, Iran's currency has lost more than half its value against the dollar; food inflation is approaching triple digits
- **Sanctions:** UN-wide sanctions were reimposed in September after European powers ended objections; Trump imposed a 25% tariff in January on goods from countries trading with Iran
- **January Protests:** Nationwide protests occurred, with security services killing thousands of Iranians; internet filtering continues over a month after censorship started
- **Upcoming Talks:** US-Iran negotiations scheduled for Friday in Oman

## Named Source Opinions:

**Hamidreza Azizi** (visiting fellow, German Institute for International and Security Affairs):
- "There seems to be a consensus among the Islamic Republic security elite that President Trump doesn't want prolonged and messy wars at high cost. So the only thing they have to do is to make sure that it's going to be as unpredictable, as messy and as expensive in terms of human cost and economic cost as possible."

**Marco Rubio** (US Secretary of State, speaking to Senate foreign relations committee last week):
- Admitted the US does not have a plan for what happens after regime fall: "I don't think anyone can give you a simple answer as to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall"
- Compared Iran to Venezuela, saying it "would be even far more complex" given the regime's longevity

**Saeed Ghasseminejad** (supporter of Reza Pahlavi):
- Claims "Iranians want the regime to be bombed"
- Believes US attack can galvanize masses to return to streets

**Nasrin Sotoudeh** (human rights lawyer, told Iranwire):
- "As for public sentiment inside Iran, many people are waiting for this strike. Many who have been driven to the brink see it as their last hope."

**Mir Hossein Mousavi** (former Iranian prime minister, Green Movement leader, under house arrest):
- Wants peaceful and democratic transition of power
- Opposes external intervention

**Mehdi Mahmoudian** (Oscar-nominated screenwriter, told BBC):
- No "patriotic Iranian" would support external attack
- Warned war would "undermine domestic democratic agency, deepen social divisions and prevent a domestic democratic transition"

**Group of 17** (including Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi and Mahmoudian, statement from January 2):
- Demanded change that was "neither reformism or revolution"
- Called for "prosecuting those responsible for the repression, ending this inhumane system, and enabling the people to determine their political future in a democratic manner"

## Key Analysis Points (Author's Assessment):

- Iran is entering negotiations with "maximalist positions" similar to those before June's Israeli attack, despite being significantly weakened
- Iran's confidence stems from belief that Trump won't attack due to potential consequences (reprisals on Israel/US bases, destabilization of Gulf region)
- Iran believes Trump lacks a strategy for regime change and has no plan to connect with opposition groups
- Iranian negotiators are described as "hugely experienced," "legalistic, full of stamina, well prepared and tough" (citing Wendy Sherman, former US nuclear deal negotiator 2013-15)
- Three of the Group of 17 signatories have been arrested for helping Mousavi draft his statement
- Trump "seems to have lost interest in those in jail or seeking radical change inside Iran" currently

## Key Statements from Named Sources:

### President Donald Trump:
- Told Iranian protesters "help is on its way"
- Threatened military action if Iran executed prisoners
- Later "dialled back his threats" after Iranian government assured no executions would occur

- **Quote (aboard Air Force One, Thursday last week):** Military forces deployed "just in case" and "We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it"
- **Warning:** If Iran executes protesters, US military action would make June's attack "look like peanuts"

### Lieutenant General Derek France (AFCENT commander):
- **Quote on military drills:** "This is about upholding our commitment to maintaining combat-ready Airmen and the disciplined execution required to keep airpower available when and where it's needed"

## Expert/Analyst Opinion (unnamed):
- "Some analysts say" the current deployment and Trump's rhetoric "may indicate that strikes could be imminent"
- Experts say the military build-up "could be an indicator that Washington is planning to strike the country"

## Historical Context Provided:
- US previously stockpiled military assets in Caribbean before striking Venezuelan boats (claimed drug trafficking without proof)
- US "abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from Caracas in a military assault on January 3" (following the Caribbean build-up pattern)

# Summary of "Iran Update, February 4, 2026"

**Source:** Institute for the Study of War  
**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Author:** Fiona Noonan

## Key Facts and Developments:

### US-Iran Talks
- **Scheduled talks:** US and Iran expected to hold talks in Oman on February 6, 2026, after a brief cancellation on February 4
- **Location dispute:** Originally planned for Istanbul, Turkey with other regional states participating. Iran's inflexibility over location and format prompted the brief cancellation
- **Scope disagreement:** Iran pushed for bilateral talks limited to nuclear program only; US seeks broader negotiations including ballistic missiles and Iran's support for regional proxies
- **Regional pressure:** At least nine regional countries sent "high-level" messages urging the US not to cancel talks (according to unspecified officials to Axios)
- **US position:** Trump administration remains "very skeptical" that negotiations will proceed

### Iranian Positions and Strategy
- **Non-negotiable items:** Iranian officials have repeatedly insisted they will not negotiate on ballistic missile program or support for proxy/partner network
- **Supreme Leader Representative Ali Shamkhani** (to Supreme National Security Council's Defense Council) told Lebanese Hezbollah-affiliated outlet on February 2 that Iran will "definitely continue" to support the Axis of Resistance
- **Deterrence reassessment:** UK-based Middle East outlet reported February 3 that some Iranian regime policymakers believe only threat of prolonged, costly war can deter US military action—limited retaliatory strikes are no longer seen as credible deterrents
- **Past Iranian strikes failed to deter US:**
  - 2020: Strikes on Ain al Assad airbase in Iraq (response to Soleimani killing)
  - June 2025: Strikes on al Udeid Airbase in Qatar (retaliation for US strikes on Iranian nuclear program)
- **Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei** warned February 1 that US attack would lead to regional war
- **Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi** warned February 1 that Iran would target US bases and conflict would extend regionally if US attacks

### Iranian Negotiation Leadership
- **Abbas Araghchi** (Foreign Affairs Minister since August 2024) oversees nuclear negotiations with US, main point of contact with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff
- Araghchi led Iranian nuclear negotiating team as deputy foreign minister (2017-2021) under Hassan Rouhani
- Senior political insiders report Araghchi has won "internal battles" within regime regarding nuclear negotiations at "key junctures" over past year
- **Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Larijani** supervises Iran's coordination with Russia
- Larijani has 20 years experience on Iran's nuclear file, including as SNSC Secretary (2005-2007) and parliament speaker (2008-2020) when he oversaw passage of 2015 JCPOA

### Analysis/Assessment (from article authors)
- Iran's inflexibility "reduces the likelihood that Iran and the United States will be able to reach a diplomatic solution"
- Iranian regime unwilling to make concessions on ballistic missiles or proxy support "almost certainly because" these constitute main pillars of Iran's deterrence and defense strategies
- Iranian officials "appear to be reckoning" that threatening limited retaliatory strikes won't deter US from striking Iran again
- Iranian policymakers have "almost certainly seen and internalized" ongoing Western media discussion about Trump administration's fears of broader war

### Syria/SDF Content
(The article also discusses Syrian Democratic Forces integration developments, which appears unrelated to the Iran-US attack question)

# Summary of "Trump's warning to Iran: Letters to the Editor — Feb. 6, 2026"

**Source:** New York Post, February 5, 2026

**Article Type:** Letters to the Editor (collection of reader opinions)

## Key Content:

This is a collection of reader letters responding to a New York Post editorial from February 3rd titled "Trump Must Hit Iran."

### Opinions Supporting Military Action:

- **Expectation of Action:** One reader argues Trump will act decisively against Iran because "Israel expects his action, Iran expects his action and America expects his action." The reader claims failure to strike would be seen as weakness, which Trump abhors.

- **Regime Change Advocacy:** A reader suggests that if the U.S. removes the Ayatollah and installs "the crown prince," it would create "a viable country and no nuclear threat."

- **Humanitarian Justification:** One letter writer states "if we have to do this to free the Iranian people, it's the humane thing to do."

- **Iran as 'Paper Tiger':** A reader claims "Iran is a paper tiger and its leaders only hold onto power by massacring their own citizens."

### Opinions Against Military Action:

- **Negotiation Preference:** Multiple readers argue for tougher sanctions and negotiation rather than bombing, with one stating "A bombing campaign won't bring regime change, but only result in a pause."

- **Campaign Promises:** A reader notes Trump promised to be the "peace president" and vowed to keep the nation out of foreign wars, arguing "He's done the opposite, which is why he's losing so much support here and abroad."

- **World War III Warning:** One letter warns Trump should "stop the war-mongering" if he's "truly the 'peace president'" to avoid starting World War III.

- **Non-Interventionism:** A reader argues "People didn't vote for Trump to be the world's policeman, and if it's regime change the Iranians want, then let them figure it out on their own."

### Context Mentioned:

- The U.S. and Iran are described as being in "their final round of negotiations" after "a year of back-and-forth dialogue"
- "Formidable American and allied armed forces" are present
- Iran has killed "tens of thousands of demonstrators" according to one reader
- The Iranian regime has shut down internet, media, and phone communications

**Note:** These are reader opinions published in a letters section, not reporting or expert analysis. The reliability of factual claims made by individual letter writers cannot be verified from this source alone.

# Summary of "Trump Warns Iran With Military Muscle, but Risks a Regional War"

**Source:** New York Times  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Author:** Steven Erlanger (covers diplomacy and security in Europe and the Middle East)

## Key Facts and Statements:

### Trump's Threats and Demands:
- President Trump is threatening Iran with military strikes "with great power, enthusiasm and purpose"
- Trump stated on Wednesday that "Time is running out" for Iran to negotiate a deal
- The strikes would be conditional on Iran not agreeing to various demands, including a deal to end its nuclear enrichment program

### Iran's Current Situation:
- Iran's Islamic Republic has been weakened by airstrikes in June and huge popular unrest
- Iran warns it will "strike back hard" if attacked by the United States
- The article notes that "This time, Iran may mean it"

### Expert Analysis:

**Ali Vaez (Iran project director, International Crisis Group):**
- "Trump likes low-cost, high-impact operations"
- "On Iran, he could do high impact, but not at a low cost"
- "He's trying to use threats to coerce Iran into submission, but I don't think this will work"
- "This is a regime that is cornered and bound to act recklessly, whether against its own people or its enemies in the region"
- Assessment: Trump "is hesitating"

### General Expert/Analyst Views (unnamed):
- Trump and Israel may be tempted to strike with the larger aim of bringing down the faltering Iranian regime and changing the balance of power in the Middle East
- Given the stakes for the Iranian regime, the risks of a regional conflagration are real

### Trump's Recent Military Action Pattern:
- In June strikes against Iran and January incursion into Venezuela (to kidnap President Maduro), Trump showed preference for short and limited military action
- He has avoided long military involvement or occupation, which would be unpopular with his MAGA base

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize 2024-2026 US-Iran military incidents, current US force deployments in region, and official U.S. statements suggesting potential attack on Iran; include developments through 5 Feb 2026.
This briefing pulls together what the open-source record shows about (1) U.S.–Iran military incidents from 1 Jan 2024 through 5 Feb 2026, (2) current U.S. force posture in and around the Gulf, and (3) authoritative U.S. statements that a strike on Iran is being considered.  Citations are to the material retrieved above.

1. Chronology of military incidents, 2024-2026  
2024  
•  No major direct U.S.–Iran clashes are documented in the sources provided.  Most U.S. activity in 2024 focused on Red-Sea strikes against Yemen’s Houthis, a Tehran-aligned actor, and maritime patrols to deter harassment of tankers, but no U.S. or Iranian shots were exchanged in the Gulf that year (gap noted below).

2025  
•  13–24 Jun 2025 – Operation “Midnight Hammer”.  Israel initiated strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities; on 22 Jun the United States joined, sending seven B-2 bombers that dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrators on Fordow and Natanz, and the guided-missile submarine USS Georgia, which fired >30 Tomahawks at Isfahan.  Roughly 1,000 Iranians were killed (Middle East Forum, 28 Jan 2026; CNN, 30 Jan 2026).

•  Fox News interview, 2 Feb 2026: “They are negotiating, so we’ll see what happens … We have a big fleet heading out there” (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  
•  NBC interview, 5 Feb 2026: Iran’s supreme leader “should be very worried” (CNN, 5 Feb 2026).  
•  Statement to reporters on Air Force One, 25 Jan 2026: carrier group deployed “just in case”; if Iran executes protesters, future U.S. strike would make June 2025 look “like peanuts” (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  
Collectively these remarks, paired with the force buildup, are the clearest public indicators that a decision to employ force is under active consideration.

4. Assessment of information gaps  
•  2024 incident record is thin in the sources retrieved.  Additional data on any encounters (e.g., IRGC harassment of U.S. Navy ships or UAV shoot-downs in 2024) would complete the timeline.  
•  Exact U.S. troop counts by country and the location/status of the USS George H. W. Bush are unconfirmed.  
•  Iranian military responses since 24 Jan 2026 (movement of ballistic-missile units, readiness levels) are only partly covered by Western media.

5. Recommended follow-up searches (only if deeper detail is required)  
–  Strait of Hormuz incident 2024 U.S. Navy (Google News)  
–  IRGC drone shootdown 2024 Persian Gulf (Google)  
–  CENTCOM posture statement March 2025 (Google)  
–  USS George H W Bush destination 2026 (Google News)

Overall, the public record shows a clear escalation ladder: June 2025 kinetic exchange; late-2025 domestic unrest triggering U.S. threats; January-February 2026 force concentration and explicit warnings by President Trump that time is running out for diplomacy.  The current disposition of a carrier strike group, reinforced air wings, air-defence surges and 40,000 troops gives Washington credible capability for limited but significant strikes should it choose to act.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
