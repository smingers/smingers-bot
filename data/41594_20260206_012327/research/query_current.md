Analysis:
The key to judging whether the United States is likely to attack Iran before 1 April 2026 is to surface the very latest reporting on:
• Any concrete military preparations (troop deployments, carrier movements, munitions shipments, over-flight negotiations, cyber-capabilities readied).  
• Authoritative statements from the White House, Pentagon, CENTCOM or Congress that signal intent or red lines (e.g., escalation if protests are crushed, if nuclear activity resumes, or if Israel requests direct support).  
• Diplomatic activity that might substitute for – or precede – force, such as back-channel talks with Tehran or pressure applied through sanctions resolutions.  
• Reactions inside Iran (IRGC alerts, air-defence readiness, warnings from Supreme Leader Khamenei) that could either deter or provoke U.S. action.  
• Allied moves: Israel, Gulf states or NATO consultations that would be consistent with a coalition strike.  
Because the last month has seen both mass protests and rising congressional calls for “decisive action,” the most relevant coverage will be from late January – early February 2026. Good queries therefore need to capture February 2026 timing, U.S. decision-makers, and the possibility (not just the history) of a strike.
