Analysis:
To estimate the likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran before 1 Apr 2026, I first need a solid baseline of:
• Recent U.S.–Iran kinetic events (e.g., June 2025 bunker-buster strikes, earlier Soleimani strike).  
• Current 2025-26 military signaling: carrier strike-group movements, CENTCOM force posture, leaked Pentagon plans.  
• Public statements by President Trump and senior officials linking protest repression to possible intervention.  
• Reactions from Iran and regional actors that could either deter or invite U.S. action.  
The most relevant historical context will therefore be authoritative reporting (news and think-tank pieces) on any U.S. planning or limited strikes already conducted, plus a synthesized timeline of incidents since 2024.
