Here are seven scenarios\" (January 29, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n- **Timing**: The article states \"The US appears poised to strike Iran within days\" (as of January 29, 2026)\n- **Military positioning**: President Trump has \"amassed this powerful force close to Iran's borders\"\n- **Iran's stated position**: Iran has vowed to retaliate against any US attack, saying \"its finger is on the trigger\"\n\n## Seven Possible Scenarios Outlined:\n\n### 1. Targeted strikes leading to democratic transition\n- US forces conduct limited, precision strikes targeting IRGC military bases, Basij paramilitary forces, ballistic missile sites, and nuclear facilities\n- Regime is toppled and transitions to democracy\n- **Assessment**: Described as \"highly optimistic scenario\" - the article notes Western military intervention in Iraq and Libya did not bring smooth democratic transitions but instead \"years of chaos and bloodshed.\" Syria's 2024 revolution (without Western military support) \"has so far fared better\"\n\n### 2. Regime survives but moderates policies (\"Venezuelan model\")\n- Islamic Republic remains intact but is forced to curtail support for regional militias, cease/curtail nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and ease suppression of protests\n- **Assessment**: \"At the more unlikely end of the scale\" - the leadership \"has remained defiant and resistant to change for 47 years\" and \"appears incapable of changing course now\"\n\n### 3. Regime collapses, replaced by military rule\n- **Assessment**: \"Many think this is the most likely possible outcome\"\n- Despite regime unpopularity, \"a huge and pervasive security deep state\" has vested interest in status quo\n- Protests have failed to overthrow regime due to no significant defections and unlimited force used against protesters\n- Possible outcome: Iran ruled by strong military government \"composed largely of IRGC figures\"\n\n### 4. Iran retaliates against US forces and neighbors\n- Iran \"clearly no match\" for US Navy and Air Force but could use ballistic missiles and drones (many concealed in caves/underground)\n- Potential targets: US bases in Bahrain and Qatar, critical infrastructure in Jordan or Israel\n- **Historical precedent**: 2019 attack on Saudi Aramco facilities (attributed to Iranian-backed militia) demonstrated vulnerability\n- Iran's Gulf Arab neighbors (all US allies) are \"extremely jittery\" about potential retaliation\n\n### 5. Iran mines the Gulf\n- **Strategic significance**: Strait of Hormuz is critical chokepoint - approximately 20% of world's LNG exports and 20-25% of oil/oil byproducts pass through annually\n- **Historical precedent**: Iran mined shipping lanes during Iran-Iraq war (1980-88); Royal Navy helped clear them\n- Iran has conducted exercises in rapidly deploying sea mines\n- Impact: Would affect world trade and oil prices\n\n### 6. Iran sinks a US warship\n- **Threat type**: \"Swarm attack\" - launching many high explosive drones and fast torpedo boats to overwhelm US Navy defenses\n- IRGC Navy has focused on \"asymmetric warfare\" to overcome US technical advantages\n- **Assessment**: \"Thought unlikely\" but precedents exist (USS Cole attack in 2000 killed 17 sailors; USS Stark attack in 1987 killed 37)\n- Would be \"massive humiliation for the US\"\n\n### 7. Regime collapses, replaced by chaos\n- **Assessment**: \"A very real danger\" and \"major concern\" for neighbors like Qatar and Saudi Arabia\n- Risks: Civil war (like Syria, Yemen, Libya), ethnic tensions spilling into armed conflict (Kurds, Baluchis, other minorities)\n- Iran has largest Middle East population at approximately 93 million\n- Potential humanitarian and refugee crisis\n- While region would be \"glad to see the back of the Islamic Republic,\" \"nobody wants to see\" Iran descend into chaos\n\n## Regional Context:\n- Israel has dealt \"heavy blows to Iran's proxies across the region\" and fears existential threat from Iran's suspected nuclear program\n- Gulf Arab neighbors concerned about being caught in crossfire\n\n## Overall Assessment:\nThe article concludes with a warning: \"The greatest danger now is that President Trump, having amassed this powerful force close to Iran's borders, decides he must act or lose face, and a war begins with no clear end-state and with unpredictable and potentially damaging repercussions.\"\n\n**Note**: This article presents scenario analysis rather than predictions, with assessments of likelihood for some scenarios but acknowledging significant uncertainty about outcomes.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20260130-former-british-diplomat-claims-iran-could-overwhelm-israel-in-major-war/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Former British diplomat claims Iran could overwhelm Israel in major war\"\n\n**Source:** Middle East Monitor  \n**Date:** January 30, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Claims:\n\n**Expert Opinion (Named Source):**\n- Former British diplomat Alistair Crooke claims there is debate within the Pentagon regarding Iran's military capabilities\n- Crooke states some Pentagon assessments suggest Israel may not be able to withstand a direct conflict with Iran\n- He argues these Pentagon views are \"based on evidence rather than assumptions\"\n\n**Assessment of Iran's Capabilities:**\n- Crooke references what he describes as \"the experience of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran\" as evidence\n- He claims Israel was \"attacked in an unprecedented way\" and sustained \"real damage\" during this conflict\n- Crooke argues Iran \"isn't backward\" or in decline, and that countries including China and Russia have demonstrated capacity to challenge Western military systems\n\n**Criticism of Western/Israeli Assessments:**\n- Crooke criticizes what he calls \"arrogance in Washington and Israel,\" particularly claims that Iran cannot challenge advanced missile defense systems\n- He describes dismissals of Iranian missiles as outdated and ineffective as \"emotional thinking\" not grounded in rational assessment\n\n**Historical Parallel:**\n- Crooke draws a comparison to the 2006 Lebanon war, citing an example where Hezbollah nearly sank Israel's newest frigate with a surface-to-sea missile\n- He claims Israeli intelligence had underestimated Hezbollah's capabilities at that time\n\n**Note:** This article presents the views of a single former diplomat in a podcast interview.

However, it notes that a full-year CR remains \"on the table\" and that another shutdown is \"not out of the question\" since the agreement doesn't resolve the healthcare subsidy debate that triggered the initial shutdown.\n\n**Note:** This article is focused entirely on U.S. defense budget processes and does not contain any information directly relevant to the question of whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://defensescoop.com/2026/02/03/f-35-fighter-jet-shot-down-iran-drone-centcom-uss-abraham-lincoln/\">\n# Summary of DefenseScoop Article (February 4, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n**Incident 1 - Drone Shootdown:**\n- An F-35C Lightning II fighter jet shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 long-range drone in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, February 4, 2026\n- The drone \"aggressively approached\" the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier with \"unclear intent\"\n- The carrier was transiting approximately 500 miles from Iran's southern coast in international waters\n- The F-35C launched from the Lincoln; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron-314 (Black Knights) were photographed operating from the carrier days earlier\n- The drone continued approaching despite de-escalatory measures\n- U.S. shot it down \"in self-defense\" to protect the Lincoln and crew\n- No U.S. personnel injured, no American equipment damaged\n\n**Incident 2 - Tanker Harassment:**\n- Hours after the shootdown, two Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ships and a Mohajer drone approached U.S.-flagged tanker Stena Imperative in the Strait of Hormuz\n- The Iranian vessels approached at \"high speeds\" and threatened to board and seize the tanker\n- USS McFaul (guided-missile destroyer) responded to escort the tanker with U.S. Air Force support\n- Situation was \"de-escalated\"\n\n## Context:\n\n- These incidents occurred after President Trump threatened military action against Iran over its deadly suppression of protests last month\n- Nuclear negotiations between U.S. and Iran could begin this week\n- Trump administration began sending additional military assets to Middle East last month after Trump told Iranians \"help is on its way\"\n- Last week Trump warned Iran to make a deal on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, threatening \"the next attack will be far worse\" than Operation Midnight Hammer (a U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities last year)\n- The Lincoln and three other warships with thousands of troops, equipment and missiles arrived in the Middle East last week\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Alex Plitsas, Atlantic Council senior fellow on Middle East:**\n- Noted the lack of inexpensive capability to deal with drone threats; fighter aircraft and missiles are expensive\n- Stated the shootdown was for force protection and \"a clear message to the Iranians\"\n- Assessed: \"The shoot down in itself is unlikely to stop talks given the repercussions for Iran if talks do not happen or fail\"\n- Warned: \"If this becomes a pattern or a U.S. ship comes under fire, that could change things\"\n\n## Diplomatic Context:\n\n- CNN reported U.S. and Iranian officials were planning to meet in Turkey on Friday to avoid military action and reestablish nuclear negotiations\n- White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed talks are \"scheduled as of right now\" but noted \"the president has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**US-Iran: more than four decades of enmity**\nThe United States and Iran have been in a state of prolonged enmity since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran, where 52 diplomats and employees were held for 444 days. In response, the US severed diplomatic ties in April 1980 and imposed trade and travel restrictions. The relationship further deteriorated in 2002 when US President George W. Bush labeled Iran part of an 'axis of evil' alongside Iraq and North Korea, citing nuclear ambitions and terrorism support. In 2018, the US, under President Donald Trump, withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, reimposing sanctions and prompting Iran to gradually roll back its commitments. By 2025, negotiations collapsed over uranium enrichment, leading to the reimposition of UN sanctions on September 28, 2025, and the formal lapse of the agreement in October. In January 2020, a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, triggering retaliatory missile attacks by Iran. In June 2025, the US launched strikes on three major Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, claiming they were 'obliterated' though damage extent remains unclear. In January 2026, President Trump sent a naval 'armada' to the Gulf, including the USS Abraham Lincoln, in response to Iran\u2019s violent crackdown on protests beginning in December 2025, demanding negotiations on both nuclear and ballistic missile issues. The US and Iran are scheduled to hold talks in Oman on Friday, February 6, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:34 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/92DX4G4)\n\n**U.S. and Iran: Understanding the Issues Dividing the Countries Ahead of Meeting in Oman**\nThe United States and Iran are set to hold a significant meeting in Oman on Friday, February 6, 2026, amid ongoing disagreements over the agenda. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Washington seeks discussions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, ballistic missiles, support for armed groups in the Middle East, and the regime\u2019s treatment of its people, particularly in the context of recent government repression of protests. Iran, however, insists on discussing only its nuclear program, a position reinforced by the change of venue from Turkey to Oman\u2014previously the site of a nuclear-only meeting in the prior year. Attendees include Jared Kushner, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. The nuclear issue has been a long-standing point of tension since 2003, when Iran\u2019s secret nuclear activities were revealed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). While Iran maintains its right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to a civilian nuclear program, the U.S. and Western powers fear weaponization. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), led by the Obama administration, temporarily curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear work and lifted sanctions, but President Trump withdrew in 2018, calling it 'the worst deal ever.' Under Biden, indirect talks resumed with little progress; Iran began enriching uranium to 60% purity\u2014close to weapons-grade levels. Trump, returning to the White House in 2025, declared Iran must accept a new nuclear deal or face airstrikes. In June 2025, Israel launched attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, with U.S. support, resulting in damage whose extent remains uncertain. Iran possesses one of the largest ballistic missile arsenals in the Middle East. It launched missiles directly at Israel for the first time in 2024 in retaliation for an attack on its Damascus embassy, and during the 12-day war in 2024, fired hundreds of missiles, killing dozens and testing Israeli air defenses. Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi stated on January 30, 2026, that Iran\u2019s missile and defensive capabilities 'will never be subject to negotiation,' while Rubio emphasized the need to address missile range. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and its 20,000 missiles to 'two cancerous tumors.' Iran has long supported regional armed groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, collectively known as the 'Axis of Resistance,' which posed a major challenge to Israel before the October 7, 2023 attacks. Israel has since weakened these groups, and Iran\u2019s influence has declined after the fall of its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Despite this, Hamas and Hezbollah have not disarmed. The U.S. also seeks to limit Iran-backed militias in Iraq, with Reuters reporting threats of sanctions on Iraq\u2019s oil revenues if such groups join the next government. Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen continue to control major areas and have launched missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and on Israel during the Gaza war. Trump escalated military threats during a December 2025 protest wave over economic hardship that evolved into nationwide demands to end the clerical regime\u2014marking the worst violence in Iran since the 1979 Revolution, with thousands killed.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 02:54 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2026/02/05/eua-x-ira-entenda-os-temas-que-dividem-os-paises-antes-de-reuniao-em-oma.ghtml)\n\n**Iran confirms nuclear talks with US in Muscat amid tense diplomacy**\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on February 5, 2026, that nuclear talks with the United States are scheduled to take place in Muscat, Oman, on Friday morning at approximately 10 a.m. Araghchi credited Oman for facilitating the arrangements, stating the discussions will focus exclusively on Iran's peaceful nuclear energy program and the removal of sanctions, with no inclusion of issues such as Iran's missile program or regional role. The negotiations will be indirect, with Oman serving as mediator, and will be led by Iran\u2019s delegation including Araghchi, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, and Kazem Gharibabadi, while the U.S. side will be represented by White House special envoy Steve Witkoff. This format mirrors earlier rounds held before June 2025, when a U.S.-Israel war on Iran disrupted diplomacy. The previous process had reached five rounds before being halted after Israel launched a military operation described by Iranian officials as an unprovoked war of aggression, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths and widespread damage to civilian, military, and scientific infrastructure in Iran. Iranian officials have insisted that talks must occur in a non-threatening environment and free from what they describe as illogical or illegal demands. Senior figures such as Ali Shamkhani, advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, emphasized the need for respect and realism in U.S.-Iran negotiations. The renewed diplomatic effort occurs amid heightened regional tensions, a strengthened U.S. military presence in West Asia, and recent coordinated attacks on Iranian police stations, military installations, and civilian infrastructure in early January 2026. These attacks, which Iranian officials claim were intended to cause mass casualties and destabilize urban centers, were followed by strong warnings from Iranian authorities, including military leaders, against further U.S. aggression, asserting that Iran\u2019s military readiness now exceeds pre-war levels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/iran-confirms-nuclear-talks-with-us-in-muscat-amid-tense-diplomacy-9880344.html)\n\n**Hot Topic Q&A: Iran-U.S. Nuclear Talks Looming \u2014 What Are the Key Divides?**\nIran and the United States confirmed on April 4, 2024, that their nuclear negotiations will take place on April 6, 2024, in Muscat, Oman. The location was initially disputed, with the U.S. favoring Istanbul, Turkey, but Iran insisted on Muscat. After diplomatic efforts across at least nine Middle Eastern countries, the U.S. agreed to the venue. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian stated on social media that the talks would be indirect, with Iran's foreign minister and U.S. Special Envoy David S. Weiss leading the delegations. Despite agreement on location, significant\u5206\u6b67 remain over the scope of negotiations. Iran insists the talks be limited to nuclear issues, asserting its right to peaceful nuclear energy and rejecting any discussion of its ballistic missile program, which it considers a core defense capability. U.S. Secretary of State Rubio, however, demands inclusion of Iran\u2019s missile program, uranium enrichment cessation, and cessation of support for regional proxies. The U.S. has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and additional aircraft to the Middle East amid heightened military threats toward Iran. Iran has warned of a strong response, including strikes on U.S. bases, if attacked. The 2023 talks, previously mediated by Oman, were suspended after Israel\u2019s attack on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day conflict and U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Analysts warn that if the current talks stall, the U.S. may resort to military action, escalating regional tensions.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed the meeting would take place at 10:00 a.m. local time in Muscat, expressing gratitude to Oman for its logistical support. The U.S. administration, citing respect for regional allies, accepted Iran\u2019s request to change the venue from Istanbul, Turkey, to Muscat, despite initial reluctance and prior reports from Axios suggesting the talks were on the verge of collapse. The shift followed pressure from several Arab and Muslim leaders urging the U.S. not to let the talks fail. U.S. officials remain cautiously optimistic about the meeting\u2019s success, describing their outlook as 'highly skeptical.' The meeting is expected to focus primarily on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, though U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, emphasize that discussions must also include Iran\u2019s ballistic missile range, support for militant groups in the Middle East, and treatment of its citizens. Israel, a key U.S. ally, shares this broader agenda and has conveyed its concerns to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The talks come amid heightened military tensions, including the U.S. military\u2019s downing of an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf on April 3, 2024, just days before the scheduled negotiations.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:45 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202602050745001)\n\n**Iran, US Talks to Be Held Friday in Oman**\nIran and the United States are set to hold indirect nuclear negotiations on Friday, February 5, 2026, in Muscat, Oman, according to Iranian media reports from February 4, 2026. The talks will focus exclusively on nuclear issues and the lifting of sanctions on Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will lead the Iranian delegation, joined by senior diplomats Majid Takht-Ravanchi and Kazem Gharibabadi. The U.S. will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff, with reports indicating that Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, may also attend. This marks a resumption of negotiations following the collapse of five prior rounds in 2025, which were derailed when Israel launched a bombing campaign two days before a planned sixth round, triggering a 12-day war. The upcoming talks occur amid heightened tensions, as the U.S. has deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following a crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran. Iran has acknowledged over 3,000 deaths from the unrest, while the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency confirmed 6,872 deaths\u2014mostly protesters killed by security forces\u2014with other rights groups suggesting the actual number is significantly higher.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 05:30 PM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5237190)\n\n**Common foe, different agenda: US and Israel diverge on Iran**\nThe United States and Israel, though close allies, hold divergent objectives in confronting Iran, according to experts. While US President Donald Trump appears to be pursuing negotiations over Iran's nuclear program\u2014expected to occur in Oman on Friday\u2014Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks the regime's overthrow and the complete dismantling of its nuclear and missile capabilities. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that Israel would respond with unprecedented force if Iran attacks, emphasizing that Iran 'cannot be trusted.' Geopolitical analyst Michael Horowitz noted that Israel aims for 'lasting weakening or even the fall of the Iranian regime,' whereas Trump seeks to avoid a prolonged war. This strategic divergence has created tension in Israel, where a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute shows 50% of Israelis support an attack only in retaliation and 44% favor coordinated military action with the US. Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group highlighted differing domestic incentives: Trump has little to gain from a long war, while Netanyahu has built his political career on emphasizing the Iranian threat. The two nations were previously engaged in a 12-day war in 2023 after an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities, with US support, leading to a ceasefire initiated by Trump. Iran retaliated with drone and missile attacks in April 2024 and a barrage of 200 missiles on October 1, 2024, in response to assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Former Israeli air force commander Eitan Ben Eliahou proposed that any US-Iran deal must include an end to Iran\u2019s military nuclear program, cessation of ballistic missile production, and public recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist\u2014conditions Zonszein deemed unrealistic, noting Israel\u2019s longstanding opposition to diplomatic agreements like the JCPOA and its preference for military action over diplomacy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 05:17 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/964L363)\n\n**Israel Pushes US to Strike Iran Despite Trump's Reluctance**\nIsrael is urging the United States, under President Donald Trump, to launch military strikes against Iran despite Trump's reluctance, according to a report by Axios cited by Anadolu Agency.

General Zamir briefed U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Dan Caine on Israel\u2019s war plans over the weekend, but a U.S. official stated that 'nothing came out of that meeting to change his or the president's mind' on attacking Iran, emphasizing that 'it's really the Israelis who want a strike. The president is just not there.' A senior U.S. official confirmed that Trump 'really does not want to do it.' This follows a 12-day Israeli-U.S.-backed attack on Iran in June 2025, which targeted military, nuclear, and civilian infrastructure, killing senior Iranian commanders and scientists, prompting Iran to retaliate with missile and drone attacks on Israeli facilities before the U.S. conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, ending ongoing nuclear negotiations. As of February 4, 2026, U.S.-Iran negotiations are scheduled to resume, with White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt stating that President Trump 'always wants to pursue diplomacy first, but it takes two to tango.' U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff was set to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on February 6, 2026, but Iran has reportedly demanded a change in location and format, pushing instead for in-person talks in Oman. Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar are expected to participate in the talks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 02:34 AM\nSource:[TEMPO.CO](https://en.tempo.co/read/2084901/israel-pushes-us-to-strike-iran-despite-trumps-reluctance)\n\n**'Nuclear Deal' with Egyptian and Qatari Support and Iranian Trap: Israeli Warnings Before U.S. Strike**\nThe article reports on diplomatic efforts involving the United States and Iran, with negotiations taking place in Istanbul under the mediation of Egypt and Qatar. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is visiting Israel, meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, and Mossad Director Danny Barnea, before traveling to Abu Dhabi and Doha to hear Israeli concerns ahead of the talks. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is set to meet Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Istanbul to discuss the U.S. proposal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, with Iran clarifying that the talks are limited to nuclear issues and not related to protests or internal repression. Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Pakistan, and Egypt, have been invited to participate. Israel has set red lines, demanding 'zero enrichment' and removal of uranium from Iranian territory, and warns that the U.S. must not settle for a nuclear-only deal, as it must also address Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles and support for terrorism. Israel views Iran\u2019s missile program as an existential threat and hopes the U.S. will push for reductions in missile range. Iranian negotiators are limited to nuclear matters only, which Israel sees as a strategic misstep. The article notes Israeli concerns that Witkoff may fall into an Iranian trap, and questions Trump\u2019s commitment to pushing through to military action. Israel believes the massive U.S. military buildup in the region\u2014costing tens of billions\u2014indicates a readiness for military options, as the U.S. military does not believe short strikes would topple the regime. Western sources indicate Iran still possesses a robust ballistic missile capability, with key components intact and improved launch platforms in mountainous areas. Iran has signaled readiness to respond violently to any attack, unlike its limited response to the June 2024 attack on a U.S. base in Qatar. Israel has offered U.S. support in defense, including fighter jets, and anticipates international coordination in case of an Iranian attack, as seen in previous attacks in October and April 2024.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:43 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/middle_east/1754387-%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%81%D8%AE-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B0%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**Could Trump bomb Iran before settling on a rationale?**\nThe article examines President Donald Trump's escalating rhetoric threatening military action against Iran, questioning the shifting and inconsistent rationales behind such threats. It highlights that the justification for war\u2014initially tied to the 2022\u20132023 Iranian protests\u2014has become increasingly tenuous as the protests were suppressed, weakening the link between U.S. military action and domestic political change in Iran. The article critiques three purported U.S. demands: ending uranium enrichment (which Iran is not currently doing), limiting ballistic missile capabilities (a demand not applied to regional powers like Israel), and ceasing support for regional allies like the Houthis, Hezbollah, and Hamas\u2014groups whose actions are responses to foreign aggression. The article argues that these demands are unrealistic, inconsistent, and ignore U.S. support for allied actors. It asserts that none of these issues constitute a valid casus belli. Instead, the article suggests the real motivation behind the threats lies in domestic politics\u2014diverting attention from internal troubles and claiming foreign policy 'success' over predecessors. The article emphasizes that diplomacy, not military escalation, offers a viable path forward: a step-by-step approach beginning with updating the nuclear agreement, which could build mutual confidence. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has stated that direct talks are only possible if Trump ends threats of attack, and Iran will not accept unilateral missile restrictions. A U.S. attack, the article warns, would harm Iranian oppositionists, strengthen hardliners in Tehran, deepen regional alliances, and provoke retaliation that could damage U.S. interests more than past responses. The article concludes that diplomacy\u2014not war\u2014is the only rational and sustainable solution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:05 AM\nSource:[Responsible Statecraft](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/trump-war-iran/)\n\n**As US and Iran set for talks, Trump warns 'bad things' will happen if no deal reached**\nOn February 3, 2026, the United States and Iran are set to resume nuclear talks in Istanbul, Turkey, with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi leading negotiations. US President Donald Trump warned that 'bad things' would likely occur if no deal is reached, citing a large fleet of US warships en route to Iran's coast. Trump has demanded three conditions for talks: zero uranium enrichment in Iran, limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and an end to support for regional proxies\u2014demands Iran has rejected as violations of sovereignty. However, Iranian officials told Reuters that Tehran is considering flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement, but insists that US military assets must be withdrawn before talks begin. Regional allies including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, and the UAE are expected to attend, with bilateral and trilateral meetings planned. Iranian leadership, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is reportedly deeply concerned that a US strike could trigger a collapse of the regime due to widespread public anger following the deadliest domestic crackdown since the 1979 revolution, with officials stating the 'wall of fear has collapsed.' Former and current Iranian officials say that public readiness to confront security forces is high, and external pressure could lead to an uprising. Meanwhile, Israeli military leadership, including IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, declared a heightened state of readiness for war, citing lessons from October 7, 2023, and preparing for multi-front conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed Israel\u2019s readiness for any scenario, warning that any attack on Israel would bring 'unbearable consequences.' Israel previously conducted a major strike in June 2025 targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, missile sites, and leadership, claiming it was necessary to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weaponization. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons but has enriched uranium to weapons-grade levels, obstructed inspections, and expanded missile capabilities. The New York Times and Reuters reported that Iran may be nearing weaponization, though Iran maintains its program is peaceful.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:37 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-us-and-iran-set-for-talks-trump-warns-bad-things-will-happen-if-no-deal-reached/)\n\n**Iran Foreign Ministry Official Says Talks with U.S. Are at Decision Stage; Possible Resumption Within Week**\nIran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson stated on February 2, 2026, that negotiations with the United States are 'at a decision-making stage' and expressed hope for outcomes in the near future, indicating ongoing review of mediation efforts by regional countries. Both U.S. and Iranian media reported the possibility of resumed talks this week. According to Axios, a U.S. Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, may hold nuclear talks with Iranian officials in Turkey later this week, with Egypt and Qatar also involved in mediation attempts. Iran's Fars News Agency reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian instructed the resumption of talks with the U.S., while Tasnim News Agency noted that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is expected to participate, though final decisions remain pending. The two countries had held five high-level meetings since April 2025 over Iran's nuclear program, but talks were suspended after the U.S. attacked Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025. In late 2025 to early 2026, former U.S. President Trump increased pressure on Iran by deploying naval forces to the Middle East, citing Iran's crackdown on anti-government protests. Iran has maintained a firm stance against negotiations under pressure, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning on February 1, 2026, that if the U.S. starts a war, 'this time it will become a regional war.' Despite this, Iran is engaging in mediation efforts from regional powers, indicating a strategy of cautious assessment, balancing both confrontation and diplomacy.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:33 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/world/20260203-GYT1T00138/)\n\n**US-Iran tensions: Iran ready for talks with US on nuclear deal, says foreign minister**\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran is ready to begin diplomatic talks with the United States on its nuclear programme, emphasizing that Iran has consistently supported diplomacy based on mutual respect and consideration of interests. This comes amid heightened US military presence in the region, including the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, and President Donald Trump\u2019s demands that Iran halt highly enriched uranium production and curb its ballistic missile programme. Reports indicate that Araghchi may meet with Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul, potentially marking the first direct US-Iran talks since April 2024. The meeting would follow recent strikes by Israel and the US on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, which have prompted repairs at sites like Isfahan and Natanz. Iran has warned of a 'swift and decisive' response to any US attack, including strikes on Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed Israel\u2019s readiness for any scenario. Iran\u2019s government reported 3,117 deaths during protests that began in December 2025 following a sharp currency devaluation and rising inflation, though activists claim the actual number is higher. The possibility of regime change under Trump\u2019s rhetoric has raised regional tensions, with fears that even limited military action could trigger further unrest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:03 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-iran-tensions-iran-ready-for-talks-with-us-on-nuclear-deal-says-foreign-minister-10510075/)\n\n**Iran pins hopes on diplomacy for positive results, foreign minister says**\nIranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi stated on February 2, 2026, in Tehran that Iran hopes diplomacy will soon yield positive results and is prepared to take the first step, emphasizing that diplomacy must be based on equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit\u2014conditions incompatible with pressure, fear, or threats. Five rounds of indirect talks between Iran and the United States on Iran\u2019s nuclear program were held on April 12, 19, 26, and May 11, 23, 2025, mediated by Oman\u2019s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Hamad Al Busaidi. The first, third, and fourth rounds occurred in Muscat, Oman; the second and fifth rounds were held in Rome, Italy. On June 13, 2025, Israel launched air strikes on Iran, killing numerous high-ranking military officials, generals, nuclear scientists, and senior personnel. That same evening, Iran retaliated with Operation True Promise III, launching hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones at targets including Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties and widespread destruction. On June 22, 2025, the United States conducted military airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, which reportedly destroyed the facilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:21 PM\nSource:[Trend News Agency](https://www.trend.az/iran/politics/4148781.html)\n\n**Wall Street Journal: U.S. Must Strengthen Air Defense Before Attacking Iran**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, the United States must strengthen its air defense systems in the Middle East before launching any potential strike against Iran. The report, published on February 1, 2026, states that the Pentagon is currently in the process of deploying additional air defense systems\u2014specifically, high-altitude THAAD batteries and Patriot missile systems\u2014to better protect U.S. forces, Israel, and Arab allies in case of retaliation or a prolonged conflict. Although the U.S. could execute a 'limited airstrike' against Iran if President Donald Trump issued an order today, officials believe the country is not yet adequately prepared to withstand potential retaliatory attacks. Satellite imagery confirms that the Pentagon has not yet completed the deployment of these systems in key U.S. military bases across the region, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Susan Maloney, a former U.S. State Department official on Iran policy, emphasized that air defense readiness is critical to protecting U.S. troops and assets from possible Iranian retaliation. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Washington is negotiating with Tehran but expressed pessimism about reaching a positive outcome. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that any U.S. attack on Iran would trigger a regional war. Iran claims the U.S. uses sanctions, pressure, and unrest to justify foreign intervention and aims to change its regime, threatening a 'comprehensive and unprecedented' response to any attack, even a 'limited' one. Israel and the U.S. accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, including electricity generation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:21 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A/%D9%88%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/3817310)\n\n**WSJ: U.S. Will Not Launch Attack on Iran Until This Is Completed**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing government sources, the United States will not launch an attack on Iran until additional air defense systems are deployed across the Middle East. The Pentagon is reinforcing its defensive posture by deploying additional THAAD and Patriot missile defense systems to bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The U.S. has also sent three squadrons of F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, capable of intercepting drones, following Iran\u2019s April 2024 drone and missile attack on Israel. The U.S. Navy has increased its fleet of interceptors in the region to eight destroyers, with two in the Strait of Hormuz, three north of the Arabian Sea, one in the Red Sea near Israel, and two east of the Mediterranean. These actions follow heightened tensions beginning in early January 2026, when former President Donald Trump threatened military intervention over anti-government protests in Iran. Although protests were later suppressed, Washington renewed threats citing Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. On Tuesday, the U.S. president announced a 'marvelous fleet' was heading toward Iran, shortly after the USS Abraham Lincoln and its combat group were deployed to the region. Iran has warned that any military action would be seen as the start of war and declared its forces are 'ready, with fingers on the trigger,' to respond immediately and forcefully. However, Iran also expressed willingness to engage in 'dialogue based on respect and mutual interests.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:06 PM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/585030-explicar-ataque-eeuu-iran-inminente)\n\n**Khamenei warns US of 'regional war' if Iran is attacked**\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned the United States on February 1, 2026, that any attack on Iran would trigger a 'regional war,' speaking during the anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s return from exile in 1979. His remarks came amid heightened tensions following the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, jet fighters, and navy destroyers to the Middle East, coinciding with widespread antigovernment protests in January 2026 that began over the collapse of the Iranian rial and escalated into a direct challenge to Khamenei\u2019s rule. Iranian state media reported 3,117 deaths during the unrest, including 2,427 civilians and security personnel, though US-based rights groups claim over 6,000 were killed\u2014figures Al Jazeera could not independently verify. Khamenei labeled the protests a 'coup' orchestrated by foreign agents, accusing demonstrators of attacking police, government centers, Revolutionary Guard facilities, banks, mosques, and burning copies of the Quran. The US, under President Donald Trump, has repeatedly threatened military action, initially linking it to Iran\u2019s treatment of protesters, then shifting focus to securing a nuclear deal. Indirect talks between Iranian and American officials occurred in Oman in June 2025 before Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran, during which the US joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite aggressive rhetoric, both nations have confirmed open communication channels to prevent military conflict. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Iran was 'seriously talking' with Washington, while Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani affirmed Tehran\u2019s readiness for negotiations. Trump emphasized that Iran should agree to a deal with 'no nuclear weapons,' though he expressed uncertainty about whether Tehran would accept such terms, adding, 'But they are talking to us.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:28 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked)\n\n**Potential U.S. Strike on Iran: Escalation Risks, Domestic Tensions, and International Reactions**\nAccording to Anastasiya Kislicyna, junior research fellow at the IMEMO RAS, the escalation between Iran and the United States, as well as Iran and Israel, is highly likely, with major events expected in spring 2026. The U.S. is intensifying pressure, with reported suspicious activity by American aviation near Diego Garcia, a key U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean, and increased air defense deployments across the Persian Gulf. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, accompanied by destroyers and missile ships capable of delivering unprecedented strikes, is being monitored closely. The Economist reports a very high probability of a U.S. strike on Iran, though President Donald Trump has not yet made a final decision. Some U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf region have reportedly indicated that a large-scale U.S. attack on Iran is likely, targeting Iran\u2019s political leadership. Iran\u2019s potential response is limited to military buildup, which experts warn would further escalate regional tensions. The active phase is expected between April and May 2026. Israel may also act by targeting Iran-linked groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, possibly leading to strikes in Lebanon later in the year. Iranian drones pose a significant threat to U.S. aircraft carriers, with attack costs estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, Gulf states such as the UAE have commented cautiously, while Saudi Arabia reportedly refused to assist the U.S. in any strike on Iran. Internally, Iran remains unstable after the suppression of protests, with ongoing public anxiety over war, external pressure, espionage fears, and economic collapse. Although the peak of protest activity has subsided, underlying contradictions remain unresolved, and people are emotionally affected by social media reports of casualties.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:01 AM\nSource:[lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2026/01/29/iran-trump/)\n\n**Iran Warns It Will Respond 'Like Never Before' to U.S. Attack**\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, stating that Iran 'will respond like never before' if attacked by the United States, in response to former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration that 'time is running out' before a potential strike.
