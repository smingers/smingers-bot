So the only thing they have to do is to make sure that it's going to be as unpredictable, as messy and as expensive in terms of human cost and economic cost as possible.\"\n\n**Marco Rubio** (US Secretary of State, speaking to Senate foreign relations committee last week):\n- Admitted the US does not have a plan for what happens after regime fall: \"I don't think anyone can give you a simple answer as to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall\"\n- Compared Iran to Venezuela, saying it \"would be even far more complex\" given the regime's longevity\n\n**Saeed Ghasseminejad** (supporter of Reza Pahlavi):\n- Claims \"Iranians want the regime to be bombed\"\n- Believes US attack can galvanize masses to return to streets\n\n**Nasrin Sotoudeh** (human rights lawyer, told Iranwire):\n- \"As for public sentiment inside Iran, many people are waiting for this strike.

current U.S. force posture in and around the Gulf, and (3) authoritative U.S. statements that a strike on Iran is being considered.  Citations are to the material retrieved above.\n\n1. Chronology of military incidents, 2024-2026  \n2024  \n\u2022  No major direct U.S.\u2013Iran clashes are documented in the sources provided.  Most U.S. activity in 2024 focused on Red-Sea strikes against Yemen\u2019s Houthis, a Tehran-aligned actor, and maritime patrols to deter harassment of tankers, but no U.S. or Iranian shots were exchanged in the Gulf that year (gap noted below).\n\n2025  \n\u2022  13\u201324 Jun 2025 \u2013 Operation \u201cMidnight Hammer\u201d.  Israel initiated strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities; on 22 Jun the United States joined, sending seven B-2 bombers that dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrators on Fordow and Natanz, and the guided-missile submarine USS Georgia, which fired >30 Tomahawks at Isfahan.  Roughly 1,000 Iranians were killed (Middle East Forum, 28 Jan 2026; CNN, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  23 Jun 2025 \u2013 Iran retaliated with ballistic missiles against Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar.  Patriot batteries intercepted most missiles; one warhead damaged a radar dome but caused no U.S. casualties (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026; Middle East Forum, 28 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  Late 2025 \u2013 From 28 Dec onward, nationwide protests shook Iran.  Security forces reportedly killed 1,000\u20135,000 demonstrators (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  Washington threatened further action if mass executions occurred.\n\n2026 (through 5 Feb)  \n\u2022  27 Jan \u2013 \u201cUSS Abraham Lincoln\u201d carrier strike group (CSG) crossed into CENTCOM\u2019s area; U.S. Air Force began multi-day dispersal drills (Al-Monitor, 30 Jan 2026; Al Jazeera live blog, 27 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  30 Jan \u2013 Satellite imagery confirmed Patriot & THAAD batteries arriving at Al Udeid; constant U.S. drone and ISR flights over Strait of Hormuz began (CNN, 30 Jan 2026; NY Times, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  2 Feb \u2013 U.S. jet shot down an Iranian drone that approached the CSG; the same day IRGC fast boats harassed a U.S.\u2013flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz (Iran International, 3 Feb 2026; CNN, 5 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  3\u20134 Feb \u2013 Additional encounters at sea; no shots fired beyond the earlier drone incident (Iran International, 3 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  5 Feb \u2013 On the eve of U.S.\u2013Iran talks in Oman, President Trump again warned Iran\u2019s supreme leader to be \u201cvery worried,\u201d while CENTCOM kept forces on high alert (CNN, 5 Feb 2026).\n\n2. Current U.S. force deployments (late Jan \u2013 5 Feb 2026)  \nNaval forces  \n\u2022  USS Abraham Lincoln CSG: the carrier plus cruiser USS Mobile Bay, destroyers USS Spruance, Michael Murphy & Frank E. Petersen Jr, supported by at least one fast-attack submarine (Middle East Forum, 28 Jan 2026; Al-Monitor, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  Additional destroyers USS Mitscher, USS Roosevelt and three Littoral Combat Ships (Santa Barbara, Canberra, Tulsa) operating in Gulf / Red Sea for Tomahawk strike and mine-countermeasure roles (CNN, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  Unlocated: USS George H.

Official U.S. statements foreshadowing a possible attack  \n\u2022  President Trump, 29 Jan 2026: threatened Iran with strikes \u201cwith great power, enthusiasm and purpose\u201d if it rejects a no-enrichment deal (NY Times, 29 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022  Oval Office, 3 Feb 2026: \u201cIf we can\u2019t [reach a deal], probably bad things would happen \u2026 We have ships heading to Iran right now, big ones \u2014 the biggest and the best\u201d (Times of Israel, 3 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  Fox News interview, 2 Feb 2026: \u201cThey are negotiating, so we\u2019ll see what happens \u2026 We have a big fleet heading out there\u201d (Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  NBC interview, 5 Feb 2026: Iran\u2019s supreme leader \u201cshould be very worried\u201d (CNN, 5 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  Statement to reporters on Air Force One, 25 Jan 2026: carrier group deployed \u201cjust in case\u201d; if Iran executes protesters, future U.S. strike would make June 2025 look \u201clike peanuts\u201d (Al Jazeera, 29 Jan 2026).  \nCollectively these remarks, paired with the force buildup, are the clearest public indicators that a decision to employ force is under active consideration.\n\n4. Assessment of information gaps  \n\u2022  2024 incident record is thin in the sources retrieved.  Additional data on any encounters (e.g., IRGC harassment of U.S. Navy ships or UAV shoot-downs in 2024) would complete the timeline.  \n\u2022  Exact U.S. troop counts by country and the location/status of the USS George H. W. Bush are unconfirmed.  \n\u2022  Iranian military responses since 24 Jan 2026 (movement of ballistic-missile units, readiness levels) are only partly covered by Western media.\n\n5. Recommended follow-up searches (only if deeper detail is required)  \n\u2013  Strait of Hormuz incident 2024 U.S. Navy (Google News)  \n\u2013  IRGC drone shootdown 2024 Persian Gulf (Google)  \n\u2013  CENTCOM posture statement March 2025 (Google)  \n\u2013  USS George H W Bush destination 2026 (Google News)\n\nOverall, the public record shows a clear escalation ladder: June 2025 kinetic exchange; late-2025 domestic unrest triggering U.S. threats; January-February 2026 force concentration and explicit warnings by President Trump that time is running out for diplomacy.  The current disposition of a carrier strike group, reinforced air wings, air-defence surges and 40,000 troops gives Washington credible capability for limited but significant strikes should it choose to act.</Agent_report>\n"
