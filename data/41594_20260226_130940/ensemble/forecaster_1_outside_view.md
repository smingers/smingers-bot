Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

Unfortunately, most sources returned errors and couldn't be summarized. However, from the question background itself, I can extract key factual information:

1. **Wikipedia sources** (Iranian Revolution, Iran-US relations, JCPOA, Soleimani assassination): These are historical background sources establishing the long-running hostile relationship between the US and Iran. Reliable for historical facts.

2. **Operation Midnight Hammer / US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites (June 2025)**: The question background explicitly states that in June 2025, the US dropped "bunker-buster" bombs on three Iranian nuclear sites. This is presented as a historical fact (it occurred before today's date of February 26, 2026). This is the most critical piece of information.

3. **Sentinel forecast** (blog.sentinel-team.org): A foresight team gave 59% probability of US strikes on Iranian territory by March 31, 2026. This was written before the June 2025 strikes occurred, so this forecast was made in the context of anticipating those strikes. Given that the strikes already happened in June 2025, this forecast has already resolved.

4. **Reuters/Politico sources**: Trump threatened intervention on behalf of protesters and called for "new leadership" in Iran (January 2026). These are credible news sources reporting on recent statements.

5. **AP News**: Reza Pahlavi positioning himself as future Iranian leader (January 2026).

**Critical realization**: The question asks whether the US will attack Iran **before April 2026**, with the resolution window starting **January 21, 2026**. The question background mentions US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025 — but those occurred BEFORE the resolution window opens (January 21, 2026). Therefore, those strikes do NOT count toward resolution.

The question is asking about NEW attacks after January 21, 2026.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Possible reference classes:
1. **US military strikes on Iran specifically**: Very rare historically. The June 2025 strikes were unprecedented (first direct US attack on Iranian territory). Before that, the US had not directly struck Iranian territory since the 1988 Operation Praying Mantis.
2. **US follow-up strikes after initial engagement**: When the US has struck a country, follow-up strikes within months are common (Iraq 1991, Libya 2011, Syria 2017/2018). However, the June 2025 strikes were followed by a ceasefire.
3. **US military action during domestic unrest in target country**: The US has occasionally intervened during foreign civil unrest, but rarely with direct military strikes.
4. **US strikes during nuclear negotiations**: The current context involves both protests and potential nuclear talks.

The most relevant reference class is: **probability of additional US military strikes on Iran within ~9 months of the June 2025 strikes, given ongoing protests and diplomatic pressure**.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is January 21 to April 1, 2026 — approximately **69 days** (about 2.3 months) remaining from today (February 26, 2026), with about **33 days** left from today.

Key context:
- The US already struck Iran in June 2025 (outside the resolution window)
- Iran is experiencing massive protests (December 2025 onward)
- Trump has threatened intervention on behalf of protesters
- The Iranian regime is killing thousands of protesters
- Iran's nuclear program was significantly damaged by June 2025 strikes
- There are ongoing diplomatic signals (nuclear talks mentioned in PBS source)

The protests create a new trigger for potential US action. Trump's rhetoric about "new leadership" and intervening for protesters suggests elevated probability. However:
- The US just struck Iran 8 months ago
- Iran's nuclear threat is reduced (sites bombed)
- There may be diplomatic channels being explored
- A ceasefire/settlement from the June 2025 war may still be in effect
- Congress and public may resist another war

**(d) Justification**

The key factors:

**For Yes (US attacks Iran before April 2026)**:
- Trump has explicitly threatened military intervention on behalf of protesters
- The Iranian regime is killing thousands, creating humanitarian justification
- Trump has called for "new leadership" — regime change rhetoric
- The US has already demonstrated willingness to strike Iran directly (June 2025)
- Reza Pahlavi positioning suggests US may be planning regime change support
- Only ~33 days remain in the resolution window

**For No**:
- The US just struck Iran 8 months ago — another strike so soon would be extraordinary
- Iran's nuclear program is already degraded — the primary military justification is reduced
- Diplomatic talks may be ongoing
- The protests themselves may lead to regime change without US military intervention
- Trump's threats may be rhetorical/diplomatic pressure
- The resolution window is very short (33 days remaining)
- Military action during protests risks destabilizing a potential transition
- Iran may be in a weakened enough state that military action is unnecessary

The Sentinel forecast of 59% was made before the June 2025 strikes and was anticipating those strikes. That forecast has already resolved. The current question is about NEW strikes after January 21, 2026.

Given Trump's rhetoric and the protest situation, there's elevated probability compared to baseline. However, the US just struck Iran 8 months ago, and the remaining window is only ~33 days. The question is whether Trump follows through on his threats to intervene militarily for the protesters.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for the US striking Iran in any given 33-day period is very low historically (essentially zero before June 2025). However, we're in an extraordinary period:
- The US has already struck Iran once (June 2025)
- Massive protests are ongoing with regime killing thousands
- Trump has explicitly threatened intervention
- The geopolitical situation is highly unstable

I'd estimate:
- Base rate of US striking Iran in any 33-day window: ~2-3% (historically near-zero, elevated by recent precedent)
- Adjustment for Trump's explicit threats: +15-20%
- Adjustment for ongoing protests and regime violence: +10%
- Adjustment for short remaining window (33 days): -5% (less time)
- Adjustment for diplomatic alternatives being pursued: -5%
- Adjustment for Iran already weakened (less urgency): -5%

Net estimate: approximately 20-30%

The Sentinel team's 59% figure was for strikes by March 31, 2026, but that was written in a context where the June 2025 strikes hadn't happened yet (or was anticipating them). Given the strikes already happened and the current question is about NEW strikes in a 33-day window, I'd place this lower.

However, the question background describes an ongoing crisis with Trump threatening intervention for protesters — this is a live situation with real probability.
