Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

Unfortunately, most sources returned errors and couldn't be summarized. However, the question background itself contains rich factual information that serves as the primary source:

Key factual elements from the question background:
- **June 2025**: The U.S. dropped "bunker-buster" bombs on three Iranian nuclear sites (Operation Midnight Hammer referenced in Fox News URL). This is described as a historical event that already occurred.
- **December 2025**: Protests erupted across Iran, described as the largest since 1979.
- **January 2026**: Trump threatened U.S. intervention on behalf of protesters; called for "new leadership" in Iran.
- **Sentinel forecast** (foresight team): 59% chance U.S. strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026.

The question's resolution window begins **January 21, 2026**. The U.S. strikes in June 2025 occurred BEFORE the resolution window opens, so they do NOT count toward resolution.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **U.S. military strikes on adversary nations during periods of active hostility (post-2001)**: The U.S. has struck Syria multiple times (2017, 2018, 2019), Iraq/Iran-linked forces repeatedly. Base rate: fairly high when there's active confrontation.

2. **U.S. escalation against Iran specifically**: Historical precedents include the 2020 Soleimani assassination, the June 2025 nuclear strikes. The U.S. has now already crossed the threshold of striking Iran directly.

3. **U.S. military action in support of popular uprisings**: Much rarer — the U.S. rarely intervenes militarily to support protesters (Libya 2011 is an exception, but that was through NATO/UN authorization).

4. **Repeat strikes within months of a prior strike**: After the June 2025 strikes, the question is whether the U.S. would strike again within the January-April 2026 window. Given the protests and regime instability, this is a distinct scenario.

The most relevant reference class is: **U.S. military strikes on a country it has recently struck, within a ~6-9 month window, during active domestic instability in that country**. This is relatively rare historically but the current context (protests, Trump's rhetoric, regime weakness) elevates the probability.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window: January 21, 2026 to April 1, 2026 — approximately **69 days** (about 2.3 months) remaining from today (Feb 26, 2026), with roughly 34 days left from today's date.

Actually, from today (Feb 26) to April 1 is about **34 days**.

Key considerations:
- The U.S. already struck Iran in June 2025. The threshold has been crossed.
- Trump has made explicit threats about intervening on behalf of protesters.
- The protests are described as ongoing and the regime is killing thousands.
- Iran's nuclear program was set back by the June 2025 strikes.
- The question window is now in its final ~34 days.

Historical pattern: When the U.S. has struck a country once (e.g., Syria in 2017), follow-up strikes within months are possible but not automatic. The 2017 Syria strike was followed by another in 2018. However, the political context matters enormously.

**(d) Justification**

Key factors pushing probability UP:
- The U.S. already struck Iran in June 2025 — the psychological/political barrier has been crossed
- Trump explicitly threatened intervention on behalf of protesters
- The regime is in crisis (protests + economic collapse + nuclear program degraded)
- Sentinel's expert forecast: 59% by March 31, 2026
- Trump's "new leadership" rhetoric suggests regime change ambitions
- Historical pattern: Trump is willing to use military force against Iran

Key factors pushing probability DOWN:
- The question window opened Jan 21, 2026 — we're already 36 days in with no confirmed strike
- The June 2025 strikes may have satisfied immediate U.S. objectives (nuclear degradation)
- Iran is already weakened; further strikes may not be necessary
- Diplomatic/negotiation track may be preferred (Trump has also pursued deals)
- Congressional/domestic political constraints
- Risk of escalation with a destabilized Iran
- The protests may achieve regime change without U.S. military action
- Only ~34 days remain in the resolution window

The Sentinel estimate of 59% was presumably made earlier in the question window. Given that we're now 36 days into the window with no strike yet, and only 34 days remain, Bayesian updating is needed. If the base rate was ~59% over the full ~70-day window, and no strike has occurred in the first 36 days, the conditional probability for the remaining 34 days is lower.

Using a rough Bayesian update: If we model strikes as roughly uniformly distributed across the window (simplistic), then P(strike in remaining 34 days | no strike in first 36 days) = (34/70) / (1 - 36/70 × P_daily) ≈ roughly 40-45% if the original 59% was uniform. But strikes are likely not uniformly distributed — they might cluster around specific events (protests escalating, specific provocations).

Outside View Calibration:

- Starting anchor: Sentinel's 59% (for the full window through March 31)
- Bayesian update for time elapsed without strike: reduces this
- The fact that ~36 days have passed without a strike suggests the immediate trigger hasn't materialized yet
- But 34 days remain and the situation remains volatile
- Trump's rhetoric and the ongoing protests maintain elevated risk
- Adjusted estimate: approximately 35-42%

Given the time elapsed, the remaining window, and the volatile but not-yet-triggered situation, I'll calibrate around 38%.

Outside View Prediction:
38%
