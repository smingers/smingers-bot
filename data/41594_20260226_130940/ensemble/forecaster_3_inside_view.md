Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria / what counts**
This resolves **Yes** if **between Jan 21, 2026 and Apr 1, 2026** the U.S. conducts a **kinetic military attack** that **physically affects Iran’s territory or Iranian military personnel**, per credible sources (cyber/warning shots don’t count).

### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality)
*Note: several provided web links (BBC, CFR, NPR, MilitaryTimes, etc.) failed to load/summarize in the prompt. I therefore only treat as usable the AskNews-ingested items and any facts that clearly recur across multiple independent reports.*

**High-quality / primary-ish reporting (generally reliable outlets; still watch for anonymous officials):**
- **NYT-sourced reporting (via Anadolu Ajansı, Sydney Morning Herald, Asharq Al-Awsat English, Times of Israel liveblog) (Feb 23, 2026):** Multiple outlets echo the same core claim: Trump is weighing **limited near-term strikes** to pressure Iran on nuclear terms, with a possible **larger follow-on** later in 2026 if that fails. These are largely **secondary writeups** of NYT reporting; the underlying NYT story is the key. Quality: **moderate-to-high**, but details hinge on unnamed officials.
- **Politico (summarized via a repost) (Feb 26, 2026):** Claims some Trump advisers prefer **Israel strike first** for political optics, with joint action still plausible. Quality: **moderate**; Politico is credible, but this is politics/strategy framing and sourced to “knowledgeable sources.”
- **PBS timeline (Feb 25, 2026):** Chronology of escalations (carriers, drone incidents, Strait of Hormuz episode, prior 2025 strike history). Quality: **high** for timeline facts; less predictive.
- **Reuters-referenced item (OBOZREVATEL citing Reuters, Feb 14, 2026):** U.S. planning back-to-back Geneva talks (Iran then Russia/Ukraine). Quality: **high** if accurately relayed; but this is a secondary relay.
- **Euronews Arabic (Feb 23, 2026):** Beirut embassy non-essential staff departure amid regional security risks. Quality: **moderate-to-high**; concrete precautionary action.

**Moderate-quality / useful but with caveats (state media, partisan, or single-source expert takes):**
- **Bluewin.ch explainer (Feb 26, 2026):** Claims extensive US force posture; also notes some allies restricting basing/airspace. This is an “explainer” with many numbers—could be partially right but error-prone. Quality: **moderate** (use as directional, not precise).
- **Times of India (Feb 24, 2026):** Reports JCS Chair Dan Caine warning about casualties/stockpiles; contrasts with Trump social media. Quality: **moderate** (often aggregates); still plausible and consistent with “military cautiousness” pattern.
- **ZEIT / n-tv (Feb 24, 2026):** Iran signaling willingness to compromise; missile program “red line.” Quality: **moderate**; broadly consistent with known negotiating positions.
- **Frankfurter Rundschau / Korean FNnews (Feb 26, 2026):** Geneva talks described as last chance; outlines U.S. “package” demands beyond nuclear. Quality: **moderate** (interpretation-heavy).

**Lower-quality / propaganda-risk / highly speculative:**
- **RT Arabic / Lenta.ru** (Feb 23–26, 2026): Often mirrors the NYT narrative but with added spin. Quality: **low-to-moderate**; treat as repetition, not confirmation.
- **Daily Beast / Yeshiva World** (Feb 19, 2026): “Strike as soon as this weekend,” “90% chance” claims attributed to unnamed sources; tabloid-ish framing. Quality: **low-to-moderate**; useful mainly as a sign of rumor intensity.
- **Sky News Arabia / Al Masry Al Youm** (Feb 24–26, 2026): “Imminent” Israeli assessments; “inevitable” rhetoric. Quality: **moderate** for capturing regional sentiment; can be agenda-driven.
- **Zero Hedge repeating FT leak claim** (Feb 24, 2026): Russia-Iran MANPADS deal. If truly FT-sourced it matters; but as presented here, the chain is messy. Quality: **low-to-moderate**.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted by strength)
**Strong evidence (big shifts):**
1. **Multiple independent mainstream outlets (NYT underlying; echoed across several) report Trump weighing a near-term limited strike** and that detailed options are in the Situation Room mix (Feb 23 wave). This is the clearest direct indicator that the U.S. could attack within the resolution window.
2. **Observable escalation posture / crisis rhythm:** repeated reporting of **carrier groups moved into theater** and broader force positioning, plus **embassy staff reductions** (even if not determinative) — consistent with preparation for kinetic operations.
3. **A clear decision forcing function exists:** Geneva talks + Trump’s “last chance / 10–15 days” framing (around Feb 19–Mar 5). That compresses timelines and raises near-term hazard versus a “simmering” standoff.

**Moderate evidence (medium shifts):**
1. **Credible constraints and reluctance signals**: reports of senior military warning about casualties and stockpile depletion; plus domestic polling allegedly showing ~70% opposed (from a Chinese-language summary referencing Quinnipiac). These reduce probability of a discretionary strike.
2. **Diplomatic off-ramp plausibility**: multiple reports of compromise concepts (e.g., limited enrichment for medical purposes, partial transfer/dilution of 60% stockpile). If either side can “declare victory,” a strike may be deferred beyond Apr 1.

**Weak evidence (small shifts):**
1. **“Inevitable” / “80–90%” pundit or unnamed-aide probabilities** (Heute.at expert, Daily Beast source). These are not decision-authoritative and are often wrong at the tails.
2. **Claims about allies blocking airspace/bases** (varies by report; could constrain, but the U.S. can strike from carriers/subs/other routes).

**Net effect of evidence vs outside view:** The outside-view 38% assumed time elapsed without a strike reduced risk. The inside-view evidence suggests the hazard is **not uniform**—it is peaking **right now** around a diplomatic deadline with forces in place—so I update **upward**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time remaining:** from **Feb 26, 2026 to Apr 1, 2026 ≈ 34 days**.
- **If timeframe were halved (~17 days):** Probability would drop materially because success would require (i) talks fail quickly and (ii) Trump authorizes action almost immediately. My estimate would fall to roughly the **35–45%** range.
- **If timeframe were doubled (~68 days):** (Not applicable to this question’s resolution, but conceptually) more time generally increases cumulative strike odds; I’d expect the probability to rise into the **60–70%** range if political/military posture remained similar.

### (d) Justification (updating from outside view)
**Outside view base rate (given): 38%.**

**Reasons to shift upward (why current circumstances are “hotter” than the base-rate frame):**
- **Decision point + ultimatum dynamics:** Several sources converge on a “last chance” negotiation round and imminent decision window. This increases near-term strike hazard relative to a slow-moving standoff.
- **Force posture suggests credible capability and readiness:** Carrier presence and other preparations make “limited strike” operationally feasible on short notice, matching the reported preference for a quick operation.
- **Prior threshold already crossed (June 2025 strikes don’t count for resolution but matter psychologically):** The U.S. has recently struck Iranian nuclear sites; repeat action is more plausible than in eras when the U.S. avoided direct hits on Iran.

**Reasons to restrain the update (why it’s not 70–80%):**
- **Trump already reportedly backed off once (mid-Jan) at the last minute** (as described in one report). This pattern supports meaningful “threat without follow-through” probability.
- **Domestic and alliance constraints plausibly bite:** public opposition and partner reluctance raise political/military friction; even if the U.S. can strike unilaterally, constraints increase the odds of delay beyond Apr 1.
- **An off-ramp exists that could be framed as Iranian capitulation:** even a narrow nuclear arrangement could postpone strikes.

Probability calibration
- Start: **38% (outside view)**
- Upward adjustments (imminent decision cycle + multi-outlet reporting of strike consideration + posture): **+18 to +22 pts**
- Downward adjustments (credible constraints + off-ramp + “back down” precedent): **−6 to −10 pts**

**Inside-view probability: ~52%** that the U.S. conducts a qualifying kinetic attack on Iran before Apr 1, 2026.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Before Apr 1, 2026, will the U.S. kinetically strike Iran’s territory or military personnel (not cyber/warnings), per credible sources?”
2) Outside view base rate: **38%**
3) Consistency check: “**52 out of 100** times, the U.S. conducts a qualifying attack on Iran before Apr 1, 2026.” (Plausible given an active deadline-driven crisis but real chance of diplomatic deferral.)
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - NYT-underlying multi-outlet reporting: Trump weighing **near-term limited strike** options.
   - **34-day** window coincides with a **Geneva ‘last chance’** negotiation cycle.
   - Significant **U.S. force posture** + protective moves (e.g., embassy staff departures) consistent with readiness.
   - Counterweight: credible reports of **military caution / political opposition** and potential **diplomatic off-ramps**.
5) Blind spot: A sudden Iranian-linked attack (proxy or direct) killing Americans could trigger a rapid retaliatory strike; that would push probability sharply higher in hindsight.
6) Status quo outcome: Most of the time crises end in more talks; a modest nudge toward “no strike before Apr 1” is warranted, preventing overreaction to rumor-heavy signals.

Probability: 52%
