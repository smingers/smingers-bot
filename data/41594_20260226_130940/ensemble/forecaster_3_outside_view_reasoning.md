**Analyzing US-Iran conflict timeline**

In the post-1979 era, the US has directly attacked Iran a few times: during the 1987-88 tanker war, Operation Praying Mantis, and the 2020 strike on Soleimani in Iraq (not in Iranian territory). While the US uses force often, actions against Iran are rare. For clarity, from February 26 to April 1 is 34 days, which is part of a larger 70-day window. The base rate for US strikes during this period is likely low, though possibly higher during crisis years.**Evaluating US airstrikes context**

I’m considering US attacks on other countries, specifically airstrikes, since 1990. The frequency is generally high due to ongoing operations, but when it comes to Iran, it's quite low. An outside perspective might ignore current protests but should consider relevant context. Analyzing limited airstrikes against Iran, there have been only two episodes in 47 years, leading to a very low expected rate. After recent strikes in 2025, the probability may increase, particularly in crisis situations, like during the Trump presidency.**Focusing on Iran's conflict context**

The question is specifically about Iran, so I need to narrow my focus. I can create multiple reference classes and figure out calibrations. For instance, I might lean on the Sentinel forecast of a 59% chance by March 31, 2026, though that's a bit of an inside view. Given the current war and hostility, the base rate is likely higher than 0.8%. Since the US struck Iranian sites in June 2025, I wonder about the likelihood of another strike within nine months, considering historical patterns.**Estimating US strike probability**

I'm analyzing past US actions, like the follow-up to strikes in Syria in 2017-2018 and Iraq in 1998 with no-fly zones. With only 34 days left until the end of this timeframe, I need to consider how that impacts the probability of a strike. If nothing has happened since January 21 and we assume a constant hazard rate, then the chances of a strike are probably lower now. The question really asks for an estimate of probability for the next 34 days, regardless of the current situation.**Calculating US strike probability again**

I'm considering the context regarding US attacks on Iran, especially during high tensions. While I typically rely on an outside view, the recent situation might change the baseline. Looking at past US actions since 1979, there have only been two direct attacks on Iran territory. The average strike probability per 70-day period is around 0.8%, but this might change if we factor in heightened tensions and recent strikes. So, I’m estimating the probability of a US attack on Iran in the next 34 days to be around 3.7%.**Estimating US-Iran attack probability**

The question at hand is whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026, considering the 34 days left from January 21. Initially, using a hazard-based approach, I estimate a low annual attack rate of 0.043, leading to a probability of about 0.4% for the remaining days. However, given the current tensions, I might apply a crisis multiplier of around 15 times, bringing that estimate up to approximately 6-7%. Thus, a final outside view prediction would be around 6.9%, with expert expectations noting variations.
