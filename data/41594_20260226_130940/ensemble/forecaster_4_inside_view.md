Analysis:
a) Source analysis (condensed)
1. Politico (26 Feb 26) – quotes WH advisers wanting Israel to strike first; direct quotes + anonymous staff; reliable mainstream US outlet; factual reporting on deliberations, opinion on “politically advantageous.”  
2. NY Times / RT Arabic / Lenta (26 Feb) – identical NYT scoop: WH weighing limited strike; NYT high-quality; foreign reprints derivative. Factual: options under active review.  
3. Bluewin.ch (26 Feb) – German press digest, lists US force posture & predicted strike windows (27 Feb or 6 Mar); largely summary, speculative timing (op-ed).  
4. Washington Post / Al-Masry (26 Feb) – quotes Sen. Mike Rogers saying strike “inevitable”; single named source, partisan; moderate quality.  
5. Times of Israel (24 Feb) – reports US–Iran Geneva talks ultimatum, Israeli concern; good regional outlet; mix fact (meeting dates, demands) and analysis.  
6. Military Times / Stars & Stripes (20 Feb) – Pentagon positioning two carrier groups; high factual reliability.  
7. Reuters (14 Jan) – Iran warning of retaliation; strong factual.  
8. Sentinel forecast blog (21 Jan) – crowd estimate 59 %; methodology opaque; use only as sentiment gauge.  
9. Quinnipiac poll (Jan) – 70 % of Americans oppose war; credible survey.  
10. Times of India (24 Feb) – internal dispute with JCS chair; single-sourced; some uncertainty.  

b) Evidence weighting
Strong:
• Confirmed US force-build-up (6) – structural capability, independent outlets.  
Moderate:
• WH actively drafting strike options (2) – single reliable source.  
• Negotiations framed as “final ultimatum” with Feb 26–Mar 6 window (3,5) – multiple outlets, but indirect.  
• Domestic opposition/political risk (9) – polling data, could restrain decision.  
• Pentagon caution re casualties/munitions (10) – single source.  
Weak:
• Bluewin “Friday pattern” prediction, pundit 80 % (3).  
• Sentinel 59 % aggregate (8) – crowd opinion, not causal.  
• Israeli “very imminent” intel leaks (5) – adversary incentive to shape narrative.  

c) Timeframe analysis
Remaining window: 34 days (≈5 weeks).  If halved to 17 days I’d drop probability by ~40 % (insufficient prep/decision time).  If doubled to 68 days I’d raise ~50 % (more time for breakdown + strike).  

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (6.9 %) reflects historic rarity of US kinetic strikes on Iranian soil over 47 years, adjusted for a crisis multiplier.  
Inside factors raising odds:
+ Largest US regional deployment since 2003 and explicit presidential threats (strong).  
+ Negotiations feature mutually incompatible red lines; talks widely judged likely to fail quickly (moderate).  
+ Political narrative from Trump allies that limited strike is low-risk and electorally useful before mid-terms (moderate).  
Inside factors lowering odds:
– Serious Pentagon misgivings about casualties, depleted stocks, and lack of basing—raises cost curve (moderate).  
– 70 % US public opposes war; election year; Congress preparing War-Powers check (moderate).  
– Trump’s history of 11-hour reversals (Jan 14 abort) shows risk-aversion once costs crystallise (weak-to-moderate).  

Combining: multiply outside base (7 %) by factor ~4 for heightened forces + imminent diplomatic failure, then discount by ~0.6 for political/military brakes → ≈17 %.  Add 10 % absolute for chance that Israel starts exchange dragging US in (based on June 2025 precedent) times 0.4 likelihood before 1 Apr = +4 %.  Round to 21 %.  Sanity check vs Sentinel (59 %) and prediction markets (~25 % average per Kalshi equivalent): within plausible band, somewhat conservative.

Probability calibration
Interpretation: Roughly 21 chances in 100 that the US conducts a qualifying kinetic attack on Iranian territory/personnel in the next 34 days; 79 in 100 it does not.  I am ±6 pp uncertain; if key Geneva talks collapse today with fiery rhetoric and carrier moves accelerate, I would update toward 30–35 %.  If a face-saving interim uranium deal emerges, I’d fall to <10 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 21 Jan and 31 Mar 2026, will US physically strike Iran’s territory/personnel?”  
2. Outside base = 6.9 %.  
3. Consistency: “21/100 times, the US attacks Iran before 1 Apr 26.” ✔  
4. Key evidence:  
    • Two US carrier groups + 100+ strike aircraft in theatre.  
    • NYT: WH preparing limited-strike options now.  
    • Feb 26 ‘final’ Geneva talks likely to fail.  
    • Strong US public opposition & Pentagon caution.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden Iranian attack on US assets forcing immediate US retaliation (outside planned timeline) could spike probability above my estimate.  
6. Status-quo bias: Last seven weeks saw no strike despite buildup; inertia favours “No,” nudging me 2 pp downward (already reflected).

Probability: 21%
