Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological sampling, *date = 2026 unless noted*)
• NY Times / Politico / Reuters bundle (23-26 Feb).  Main facts: Trump has ordered detailed target lists; USS Ford & Lincoln in theatre; Geneva round 3 set for 26 Feb.  First-hand official leaks, high factual quality, identical core narrative → strong evidence.  
• Times of Israel (24 Feb) & Sky News Arabic (24 Feb).  Israeli intel says attack “very imminent”.  Secondary but independent of US leaks; moderate evidence.  
• WSJ (31 Jan) & Interfax (30 Jan).  White-House still split on final objectives; no strike order yet.  High-quality, but three-weeks old.  Shows indecision → moderate counter-evidence.  
• Quinnipiac poll (Jan).  70 % US public oppose war.  Credible quantitative datum → weak-to-moderate deterrent.  
• Sentinel foresight team (20 Feb).  Crowd estimate 59 %; methodological transparency but still opinion → weak evidence (used only as market sentiment).  
• Historical record (CRS, 1973-2025).  7 of 34 US combat actions were follow-on strikes within 12 mo of a first strike → structural base-rate input, strong evidence.

2. Evidence analysis
Strong-for-YES  
• (1) Fully assembled strike package (two CSGs, 200+ tac-air, bombers forward-deployed) verified by multiple outlets.  
• (2) Trump’s public 10- to 15-day ultimatum (19 Feb) ends c. 5 Mar, inside the window.  
• (3) Past behaviour: Trump already hit Iran once (Jun 2025) → follow-on strikes historically 20-25 % likely.

Moderate-for-YES  
• Israeli urgency; advisers say “inevitable”; Friday announcement pattern (Bluewin.ch).  
• Geneva talks widely described as “last chance”.

Moderate-for-NO  
• Joint Chiefs’ risk briefings; allies deny basing; munitions stockpiles low.  
• Public-opinion / mid-term politics disincentivise new war.

Weak-for-NO  
• Back-channel optimism (Al-Manar, N-tv) — few details, single-source.

Net evidence balance: tilt toward a limited strike scenario, not a full war.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Window left: 35 days.  Hazard is highly front-loaded: if a strike comes it is most plausible 27 Feb – 8 Mar (post-Geneva, before carriers need to re-fuel/rotate and before Easter recess).  If we magically doubled the window to 70 days I would add ≈ +7 pp; if halved to 18 days I would subtract ≈ -9 pp.

4. Justification / from outside to inside view  
Outside view (reference-class) = 2 ½ % (probability a second-round US strike on a country 8-12 mo after first strike, per historical data).  
Adjustments:  
+12 pp  military capability already staged (structural, hard to reverse in < 5 wks).  
+8 pp  explicit presidential threats with short deadline.  
+7 pp  Israeli pressure & alignment of political calendars (Netanyahu visit, State of Union complete).  
-3 pp  Joint Chiefs & allies’ reluctance / basing limits.  
-4 pp  very low US public support & looming primaries.  
+10 pp  unusually intense domestic Iranian crack-down creating potential trigger.  
Cumulative shift: +30 pp → 32-33 %.

Status-quo (no new strike) still more likely, but margin is not large.

Probability calibration
“I expect that roughly 33 out of 100 comparable situations would see the US conduct at least one qualifying kinetic attack on Iranian territory or forces between now and 1 Apr 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “From 21 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 will the US physically strike Iran’s territory or troops?”  
2. Base-rate noted: 2.5 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 w each):  
   – Two carrier groups & 200+ aircraft in strike posture.  
   – Trump 10-15 day ultimatum ends early-Mar.  
   – Prior US strike June 2025 raises follow-on risk.  
   – Joint Chiefs, allies warn of high costs.  
   – US voters 70 % oppose new war.  
5. Blind-spot: A last-minute secret mini-deal (limited enrichment + sanctions relief) defuses crisis on 28 Feb; probability would drop to < 10 %.  
6. Status-quo bias considered; kept overall < 50 %.

Probability: 33%
