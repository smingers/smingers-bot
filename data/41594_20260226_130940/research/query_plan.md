Analysis:
The background excerpts cover the long-standing hostility, the 2025 Israel-Iran war, the December-2025 protests, and some public threats from President Trump.  Forecasters still need (a) a quantitative base rate for U.S. kinetic strikes on Iran or on any country in comparable windows; (b) clarity on how past strikes were reported/resolved (so they know what “credible sources” will look like); (c) the main proximate drivers—U.S. force deployments, decision-making signals from the White House/Pentagon/Congress, Iranian actions that might trigger a strike, and Israeli lobbying; (d) the very latest situational facts (troop movements, diplomatic talks, protest dynamics, Iranian nuclear progress); and (e) contrarian evidence such as de-escalation moves, U.S. domestic constraints, or ongoing negotiations.  
The search strategy therefore mixes historical/base-rate queries (≈60 %) with current-state queries (≈40 %), and includes at least one query specifically focused on the resolution mechanism (how previous strikes were confirmed by sources).
