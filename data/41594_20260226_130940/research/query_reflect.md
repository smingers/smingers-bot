Analysis:
1. Base rate: GAP – attempted searches but no usable historical frequency data on U.S. kinetic strikes against Iran or comparable actions.
2. Resolution mechanism: COVERED – definition of what counts as an “attack” is clear and uncontested.
3. Key drivers: GAP – only scattered current-event snippets; missing structured information on U.S. force posture, decision-makers’ incentives, and regional trigger dynamics.
4. Current state: COVERED – several items from the past week on carriers, diplomacy, protests.
5. Contrarian: COVERED – reporting on hawkish voices and scenarios that could lead to a strike supplies the less-obvious outcome narrative.
