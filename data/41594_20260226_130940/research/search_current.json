White House officials reportedly stated that the 'political situation is budding' and emphasized that Israel's Iron Dome defense system does not provide full protection, increasing the risk of American casualties and significant political fallout. While Israel may prefer to act first, the most likely scenario remains a joint U.S.-Israeli operation. White House Deputy Press Secretary Anne Kelly cautioned against media speculation, stating, 'Only President Trump knows what he can do and what he can't do.' This comes amid heightened tensions, including new U.S. visa restrictions on Iranian officials following a violent crackdown on nationwide protests. On February 20, 2026, Trump publicly indicated he would consider limited strikes on Iran, citing Iran\u2019s imminent development of missiles capable of reaching the U.S., though he also expressed a preference for diplomacy. A U.S.-Iranian delegation meeting is scheduled for February 26, 2026, in Geneva to discuss Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 10:05 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f 97](https://charter97.org/en/news/2026/2/26/675004/)\n\n**'New York Times': Washington Counting on Limited Strikes Against Iran to Pressure It in Nuclear Negotiations**\nAccording to The New York Times, U.S. officials are skeptical about Iran's willingness to reach a nuclear deal, with limited strikes aimed at pressuring Iranian leaders to make concessions. While the primary goal of a potential strike is to damage Iran's nuclear facilities, it also carries significant symbolic weight. Several U.S. administration representatives stated that a strike would allow former President Donald Trump to declare victory over a long-standing adversary. The newspaper noted that senior officials hope such a strike could compel Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program, though some current and former officials remain doubtful about the strategy's effectiveness. Trump announced on February 20, 2026, that he was considering limited strikes against Iran. In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei warned on Monday, February 24, 2026, that any U.S. strike\u2014no matter how limited\u2014would be considered an aggressive act by Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 08:51 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1761481-%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%83-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%B2-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%BA%D8%B7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**Reasons Behind U.S. Intentions to Strike Iran Named**\nAccording to The New York Times (NYT), citing U.S. officials, the United States is considering a potential strike on Iran to compel Tehran to make concessions during nuclear negotiations. Officials doubt Iran's willingness to reach a deal but believe that a strategy of targeted strikes aims to pressure Iranian leaders into yielding. The primary objective of a potential strike would be to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, though the action also carries symbolic significance. A senior source noted that a U.S. strike could allow President Donald Trump to claim victory over a longstanding adversary. While U.S. officials hope the strike would lead Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program, some current and former officials remain skeptical about its effectiveness. The U.S. is reportedly seeking for Israel to launch the initial strike, which would provoke Iranian retaliation and provide a justification for American military involvement.

President Donald Trump, during his first 'Peace Council' meeting on February 19, 2026, indicated that Iran had 10 to 15 days to reach a deal\u2014or face 'really bad things.' The Pentagon has activated military preparations, including deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean and positioning the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf of Oman. However, key allies like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the UK have blocked U.S. use of their airspace and bases, particularly disallowing attacks from British bases and the Diego Garcia support hub. The U.S. Air Force has deployed 128 aircraft to the region, including 48 F-16s, 12 F-22 Raptors, 6 EA-18G Growlers, 30 F-35A and 10\u201312 F-35C fighters, 35 F-15E Strike Eagles, 70\u201384 F/A-18F Super Hornets, 12 A-10C Thunderbolts, 8 E-11A communications aircraft, and 108 KC-46 and KC-135 tankers to enable long-range strikes. The B-2 Spirit, B-1 Lancer, and B-52H Stratofortress bombers are also on standby. General of the Army Dan Caine has warned Trump of significant risks, including depleted weapons stocks due to ongoing support for Israel and Ukraine, potential casualties, and the danger of a prolonged conflict. Despite Caine\u2019s warnings, Trump dismissed media reports as 'fake news' and insisted he alone makes decisions. He emphasized that while he prefers a diplomatic deal, failure to reach one would be 'a very bad day for this country.' The article suggests a military strike could occur around February 27 or March 6, 2026, following a pattern of Friday announcements.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 03:48 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/iran-in-x-punkten-3112682.html)\n\n**Trump Allies: Iran Strike 'Inevitable' Regardless of Today's Negotiation Results**\nAccording to U.S. Senator Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the U.S. administration has provided Congress with clear evidence that Iran has resumed efforts to revive its nuclear program, which the U.S. considers a sufficient justification for military intervention. The Washington Post reports that former President Donald Trump has several military options available, including a limited operation to force Iran to accept U.S. terms, or a broader operation aimed at regime change if Tehran rejects a deal\u2014potentially including direct strikes on Iranian leadership. Senior Trump advisers reportedly favor Israel launching an initial air strike on Iran first, followed by monitoring Tehran\u2019s response, thereby allowing the U.S. to intervene in retaliation while securing public support for the military action. Close associates of Trump assert that a strike on Iran is 'inevitable,' regardless of the outcome of negotiations scheduled for Thursday, February 26, 2026.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 03:32 AM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4208406)\n\n**Expert Predicts US Military Strike Against Iran Following Trump's State of the Union Address**\nUS President Donald Trump delivered a nearly two-hour State of the Union address, portraying the nation as 'greater, better, richer, and stronger than ever' and describing a 'golden age' for the United States. The speech emphasized his claimed economic successes, border security, and international strength, receiving enthusiastic applause from Republican lawmakers. In contrast, dozens of Democratic lawmakers boycotted the event and held counter-rallies, accusing Trump of chaos and corruption, particularly criticizing his hardline immigration and economic policies. Facing declining poll numbers ahead of the November midterms and growing backlash over aggressive tariffs and deportation measures, Trump\u2019s rhetoric is under scrutiny. US political expert Peter Rough, a former Trump aide, analyzed the speech on ORF\u2019s ZIB2, calling it 'quite disciplined' and the official kickoff to the 2026 election campaign. While acknowledging Trump\u2019s use of exaggeration and selective truth, Rough noted that the US economy is indeed performing well compared to Europe and that AI investment could give the country a strategic advantage. He emphasized that Trump\u2019s approach is not about consistency but about strategic messaging. Regarding international tensions, Rough stated he believes there is an '80% chance' of a US military strike against Iran, though the specifics remain unknown.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 09:27 PM\nSource:[Heute.at](https://www.heute.at/s/experte-sagt-us-militaerschlag-gegen-den-iran-voraus-120165111)\n\n**Two Factors Determine Whether the U.S. Will Attack Iran and When**\nTwo key factors determine whether the United States will attack Iran and when: diplomatic negotiations and domestic public opinion in the U.S. The first factor is the ongoing indirect U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with the third round scheduled for February 26, 2026, in Geneva. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated this round is Iran\u2019s 'last chance'; if no significant concessions are made, military action may follow. Iran has reaffirmed its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons but insists on its right to peaceful nuclear energy, refusing to dismantle its nuclear capabilities\u2014a strategic move to retain deterrence. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has prepared for potential assassination by delegating core powers to the head of the Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, and mandating that each key government and military position have up to four pre-designated successors to prevent a power vacuum from a U.S. 'decapitation' strike. The second factor is U.S. public opinion: a January 2026 Quinnipiac University poll found 70% of Americans oppose military action against Iran. Additionally, Trump\u2019s domestic approval ratings have hit a low, with 65% disapproving of his inflation handling, 64% opposing his tariffs, 62% criticizing his foreign policy, 58% opposing his immigration policy, and 57% rejecting his overall economic management\u2014leading to a 60% disapproval rate, the highest since his second term began. Trump\u2019s upcoming State of the Union address on February 24, 2026, will focus on domestic economic and social issues, but its impact on his approval ratings could influence his decision on Iran. If the speech boosts his popularity and strengthens his political position ahead of the midterm elections, his willingness to launch a war may increase. Thus, the period after February 26, 2026, is described as extremely dangerous, as both the third round of negotiations and the State of the Union will have concluded, leaving the decision in Trump\u2019s hands.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 09:19 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8r29cDgfx2m)\n\n**Top Gen said to dispute Trump's expectation of easy win in Iran - The Times of India**\nPresident Donald Trump claimed in a social media post on February 24, 2026, that General Dan Caine, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, believed any military action against Iran would be 'something easily won.' However, sources briefed on internal White House deliberations contradicted this, stating that Caine has, in recent high-level meetings, emphasized that a potential strike on Iran\u2014while feasible with U.S. forces deployed in West Asia\u2014would carry a high risk of American casualties and would negatively impact U.S. weapon stockpiles. Caine also compared the operation to the recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, noting that the Iran operation would be significantly more complex. Despite Trump\u2019s assertion that Caine supports a decisive victory and has no reservations about military action, Caine has consistently refrained from advocating a specific policy position, instead presenting military options and their risks without offering personal recommendations. A spokesperson for the Joint Staff declined to comment. Trump\u2019s post was reportedly prompted by news reports from The New York Times and other outlets detailing the administration\u2019s ongoing military planning regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 09:47 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-gen-said-to-dispute-trumps-expectation-of-easy-win-in-iran/articleshow/128762889.cms)\n\n**Israeli Security Estimates: Attack on Iran 'Very Imminent'**\nAccording to Israeli security assessments reported by Israeli media on February 24, 2026, a military attack on Iran is considered 'very imminent.' The Israeli Channel 12 reported that an intelligence assessment within Israel's security apparatus indicates the attack is expected 'very soon.' Despite Iran's internal crisis and weakened state, experts and officials note Iran still possesses significant military capability that could enable it to inflict damage on U.S. and allied interests in the region, disrupt the global economy, and trigger a prolonged conflict in response to any U.S. military strike. According to U.S. officials, Iran's potential military retaliation has become a central factor in former President Donald Trump\u2019s deliberations about bombing Tehran, particularly in discussions with Middle Eastern allies. Former officials and diplomats suggest Iran\u2019s response would differ significantly from its June 2025 reaction, especially if Iranian leaders perceive the regime as being at risk of collapse. Experts identify three potential Iranian response pathways: missile strikes, attacks through proxies such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, or global terrorist operations. A new round of diplomatic talks between the U.S. and Iran is expected on Thursday, according to U.S. administration officials. Officials emphasize that Iran must make substantial concessions on its nuclear program\u2014specifically, abandoning uranium enrichment\u2014to avoid a potential U.S. military strike. Reports indicate Trump is evaluating military options should diplomacy fail, including limited strikes targeting nuclear and missile sites, or a broader attack aimed at weakening or toppling the Iranian regime.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 08:25 PM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/world/1854984-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A7)\n\n**Unofficial: 'Gang of Eight' to Meet at the White House Over Iran**\nOn February 19, 2026, Donald Trump stated he would decide within 10 to 15 days whether to take military action against Iran, later confirming he did not rule out an attack. Media outlets reported unofficially that the U.S. had already made a decision and might strike Iran in the coming days. On Wednesday, February 24, 2026, a meeting is scheduled at the White House where Secretary of State Marco Rubio will brief the 'gang of eight'\u2014a group of top congressional leaders from both the Democratic and Republican parties, including Senate and House party leaders and members of the House Intelligence Committee\u2014on Iran-related matters. According to NewsNation correspondent Libbey Dean, a State Department official confirmed the briefing. Democratic lawmakers, including Congressman Gregory Meeks, criticized the Trump administration for not providing sufficient information about the military buildup near Iran and questioned the lack of transparency regarding the nature of a potential strike\u2014whether it would be small or large-scale, involve ground troops, or aim to change the regime. Meeks also criticized the administration for limiting high-level Iran negotiations to just two individuals: U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 11:43 AM\nSource:[gazetapl](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/polityka/7,198013,32620749,nieoficjalnie-gang-osmiu-spotka-sie-w-bialym-domu-chodzi.html)\n\n**Decisive hours: Progress on a new nuclear deal, or countdown to a US strike?**\nAhead of a critical round of U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations in Geneva on Thursday, February 27, 2026, Israel remains uncertain about the U.S. position despite close coordination with the Trump administration. The U.S. issued a pre-talks ultimatum requiring Iran to submit a detailed response by Tuesday, with the decision to proceed hinging on the nature of Tehran\u2019s reply. Iran, reportedly acting under the personal approval of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei through envoy Ali Larijani, is expected to offer to transfer half of its 60% enriched uranium to a third country and dilute the remainder on Iranian soil in exchange for the removal of significant economic sanctions. However, analysts doubt this proposal meets the U.S. threshold, as it would still leave Iran with enough enriched material to pursue a nuclear bomb and retain leverage. Iran is seeking the inclusion of IAEA Director Rafael Grossi in the Geneva talks, a strategic shift from his previous status as persona non grata in Tehran. Former IDF Military Intelligence head Danny Citrinowicz argues that the U.S. suffers from a 'deep conceptual gap' in understanding Iran\u2019s red lines\u2014regime survival, deterrence, and regional influence\u2014which Iran is unwilling to compromise, even under threat of military action. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, believe only a military strike\u2014referred to as 'reshuffling the deck'\u2014could force flexibility or regime change. Israel fears that a limited strike could backfire, potentially strengthening Iran\u2019s resolve and leadership. The outcome hinges on whether Iran offers more than uranium concessions and whether President Trump can frame any agreement as an Iranian capitulation, particularly amid his upcoming State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 11:21 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/decisive-hours-progress-on-a-new-nuclear-deal-or-countdown-to-a-us-strike/)\n\n**Report: Trump Considers Targeted Strike Against Iran, Followed by Larger Attack**\nUS President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a two-phase military strategy against Iran if diplomacy and a targeted initial strike fail to compel Tehran to abandon its nuclear program. According to sources briefed on internal administration deliberations, Trump has instructed advisers that if initial actions do not yield results, he may authorize a larger, more ambitious attack later in 2026 aimed at toppling Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Targets under consideration include Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, nuclear facilities, and ballistic missile programs. The United States is preparing for possible conflict, with two aircraft carrier groups, dozens of fighter jets, bombers, and refueling aircraft massing near Iran. A potential diplomatic off-ramp is being discussed: a proposal from International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi allowing Iran to conduct limited uranium enrichment solely for medical purposes, such as cancer treatment, at the Tehran Research Reactor\u2014a facility originally supplied by the US under the 'Atoms for Peace' program. While the proposal could serve as a face-saving compromise, it remains uncertain whether Iran will agree to scale back its vast nuclear infrastructure or if Trump will accept a non-zero enrichment arrangement despite his public 'zero enrichment' stance. The situation is further complicated by tensions with Arab nations over comments by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who claimed Israel has a right to much of the Middle East. European officials at the Munich Security Conference expressed skepticism that military pressure will force Iran to abandon its nuclear program, which has become a symbol of national resistance. The White House declined to comment, with spokesperson Anna Kelly stating only that 'only President Trump knows what he may or may not do.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 09:22 AM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat English](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5243796)\n\n**Report: Trump weighing limited strike on Iran, broader action if talks fail**\nAccording to The New York Times, citing U.S. officials, President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike against Iran in the coming days to pressure Tehran into abandoning its nuclear program, with broader action aimed at toppling Iran's leadership if diplomatic efforts fail. The Geneva negotiations, mediated by Oman, are set for February 26, following earlier rounds on February 6 and February 17. Potential targets for a limited strike include the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, nuclear facilities, and ballistic missile infrastructure. If initial measures fail, Trump may pursue a larger-scale military operation later in 2026 to remove Iran's leadership, though some officials question whether this is achievable through airstrikes alone. Earlier special operations options have been discarded due to high operational risk. The White House declined to comment, stating only that 'only President Trump knows what he may or may not do.' A proposed compromise allowing Iran limited uranium enrichment for medical purposes is under discussion, though neither side has confirmed acceptance. Publicly, Trump demands 'zero enrichment,' while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi asserts Iran's right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to produce nuclear fuel. The U.S. has deployed two aircraft carrier groups, fighter jets, bombers, and refueling aircraft near Iran, with high-level deliberations held in the White House Situation Room involving Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The talks focus on Iran's uranium enrichment levels and stockpile of highly enriched uranium.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 08:46 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/report-trump-weighing-limited-strike-on-iran-broader-action-if-talks-fail/3837574)\n\n**NY Times: Trump weighing initial limited Iran strike, but going for regime change if no results**\nAccording to The New York Times, U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike on Iran in the near term to pressure Tehran into meeting his nuclear demands.

According to sources, Trump is leaning toward a preliminary strike in the coming days to send a strong message to Iran, targeting Revolutionary Guard facilities, nuclear sites, and ballistic missile programs. If these actions fail to shift Iran\u2019s stance, a larger military campaign remains under consideration later in 2026, with the goal of weakening or overthrowing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. However, this strategy has sparked internal debate within the U.S. administration over the feasibility of regime change through airstrikes alone. Alternative proposals are being explored, including a potential deal allowing Iran a limited nuclear enrichment program for medical and research purposes, though neither side has shown clear willingness to accept such a framework.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 05:28 AM\nSource:[ashourland.net](https://ashourland.net/2026/02/23/%d9%86%d9%8a%d9%88%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%83-%d8%aa%d8%a7%d9%8a%d9%85%d8%b2-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%85%d8%a8-%d9%8a%d8%af%d8%b1%d8%b3-%d8%a5%d8%b3%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%b7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7/)\n\n**Trump considers 'much bigger attack' on Iran as part of two-pronged war if diplomacy fails**\nPresident Donald Trump has informed advisers that if diplomacy or an initial targeted U.S. strike fails to compel Iran to abandon its nuclear program, he is considering a significantly larger military operation in the coming months aimed at removing Iran's leadership.

At the same time, alternative proposals are being considered, such as allowing Iran a highly restricted nuclear enrichment program for medical and research purposes\u2014though it remains unclear whether either side is willing to accept such a compromise.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 03:27 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1760400-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B0%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AD-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/)\n\n**It\u2019s Time for Trump to Choose Peace or War with Iran \u2013 Jornal Op\u00e7\u00e3o**\nThe decision on whether the United States will launch a military strike against Iran in the coming days rests solely with President Donald Trump. Despite ongoing negotiations in Geneva, progress has stalled, frustrating Trump, who has deployed a significant military force\u2014including hundreds of military aircraft and the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier\u2014to pressure Iran. Media reports from the U.S. and Israel suggest military action could begin on Sunday, February 22, 2026, with U.S. military personnel monitoring developments closely in the White House\u2019s Situation Room. Trump, though not present during the overnight deliberations, was briefed by envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Assessments within his administration indicate that Iran is weakened\u2014its proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been significantly degraded, the economy is in crisis, and public unrest is growing. Trump is reportedly weighing advice from allies and advisors on both sides of the issue, with his legacy as a central consideration. Advisors believe this is the optimal moment to act, arguing that inaction may forfeit a rare strategic opportunity. The outcome hinges on whether Trump chooses diplomacy or military action, with the potential for a post-regime power vacuum in Iran and broader regional implications, particularly given Iraq\u2019s current Shia influence. The final decision will be revealed in the coming days.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 09:55 PM\nSource:[Jornal Op\u00e7\u00e3o](https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/colunas-e-blogs/geopolitica-colunas-e-blogs/chegou-a-hora-de-trump-decidir-pela-paz-ou-pela-guerra-795683/)\n\n**Trump Admin's Secret War Room Meeting Plot Exposed**\nSources indicate that President Donald Trump may launch a military strike on Iran as early as Saturday, February 21, 2026, amid ongoing deliberations with advisers and allies. According to CNN and CBS, Trump has been deeply engaged in weighing the pros and cons of military action, with no final decision made as of February 19, 2026. In preparation, U.S. air and naval assets have been significantly increased in the Middle East, and the Pentagon is temporarily relocating personnel to Europe and the U.S. in anticipation of potential Iranian counterattacks. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that diplomacy remains the president\u2019s first option, though military action is a possibility. She referenced a 'very successful operation in June' targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and warned Iran to make a deal with Trump, noting that the two sides remain 'very far apart' on key issues. Iran is expected to provide further details on its negotiating position within the next couple of weeks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 28 to update him on Iran talks, with Israel expected to support any U.S. military action. A source cited by Axios said Trump was 'getting fed up' with nuclear talks and that there is a '90 percent chance' of kinetic action in the coming weeks, despite warnings from some advisers against war.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 08:57 AM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admins-secret-war-room-meeting-plot-exposed/)\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 LOCKED & LOADED: U.S. Military Signals Readiness for Potential Iran Strikes AS SOON AS THIS WEEKEND**\nTop U.S. national security officials have informed President Donald Trump that the U.S. military is prepared to conduct potential strikes on Iran as early as Saturday, February 21, 2026, according to CBS News. The decision remains undetermined, with ongoing internal deliberations weighing the risks of escalation against the consequences of restraint. In preparation, the Pentagon is temporarily relocating some personnel from the Middle East to Europe and the U.S., a standard procedure not necessarily indicating an imminent strike. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is already in the Middle East, and the USS Gerald R. Ford\u2014America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier\u2014is en route, having been tracked off the coast of West Africa as of Wednesday, February 18, 2026. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded by posting an AI-generated image of the Ford submerged, warning that 'more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.' Diplomatic efforts continue: U.S. and Iranian negotiators met in Geneva on February 18, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledging 'a little bit of progress' but emphasizing that 'we're still very far apart on some issues.' Leavitt reiterated that diplomacy remains the president\u2019s first option and declined to confirm whether any strike would be coordinated with Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel in about two weeks to discuss further with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump reportedly told Netanyahu in December that he would support Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program if negotiations fail. Iran has warned pilots to avoid its southern region due to planned rocket launches. This military buildup follows a 12-day conflict in June 2025, during which the U.S. and Israel conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, damaging Tehran\u2019s program. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had enriched uranium to 60% purity\u2014just short of weapons-grade\u2014prior to those strikes. As of February 19, 2026, the carriers advance, diplomats negotiate, and the president retains final decision-making authority.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[The Yeshiva World](https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/2514220/%f0%9f%9a%a8-locked-loaded-u-s-military-signals-readiness-for-potential-iran-strikes-as-soon-as-this-weekend.html)\n\n**Trump Asks Advisors for Rapid, Decisive Strike Options Against Iran to Avoid Prolonged War**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly asked his advisors for options for rapid and decisive military strikes against Iran that avoid the risk of a prolonged war in the Middle East, according to The Wall Street Journal citing unnamed officials. The discussions focus on whether the primary objective should be disrupting Iran\u2019s nuclear program, destroying its ballistic missile arsenal, toppling the Iranian government, or a combination of these. The ideal scenario, as described by sources, would be a strike so forceful that Iran\u2019s leadership is compelled to comply with U.S. nuclear demands and cease supporting dissidents. There have been deliberations on a punitive bombing campaign aimed at overthrowing Iran\u2019s leadership, as well as using military threats to extract diplomatic concessions. Vice Admiral Robert Murrett, a retired Navy intelligence official, emphasized that the type of operations and force packages required would vary significantly depending on the chosen strategy. Trump has maintained a public stance that Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons, yet he has remained deliberately ambiguous to conceal his strategic intentions. The White House and Pentagon have prepared several attack options, including a large-scale 'grand plan' targeting Iranian government facilities and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). However, officials warn that removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may not lead to a more conciliatory successor, as a senior IRGC member could assume power, potentially preserving or even intensifying Iran\u2019s current posture. U.S. military tensions with Iran escalated in early January 2026, when Trump threatened military intervention over protests in Iran. Although protests were later suppressed, Trump renewed threats citing Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. On Tuesday, January 27, 2026, Trump announced a 'wonderful army' was heading toward Iran, shortly after the USS Abraham Lincoln and its carrier strike group were deployed to the Middle East, placing Iran within striking range.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:02 PM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/584883-revelar-tipo-ataque-iran-desarrolar-trump)\n\n**White House Still Unclear on Final Goal of Iran Policy**\nThe White House under President Donald Trump has not yet established a clear final objective for its policy toward Iran. According to unnamed U.S. officials cited by Al Arabiya on January 30, 2026, the administration is still deliberating the ultimate goal of its approach, despite a significant increase in U.S. military presence in the Middle East. Internal debates continue, and no definitive course of action has been set, leaving a range of potential responses under consideration. Officials noted that Trump may make a decision at the last moment. Although the U.S. previously deployed aircraft carrier strike groups to the region without launching attacks, circumstances have changed, particularly after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025. On Wednesday, Trump stated that U.S. forces are prepared to conduct a more devastating strike than in summer 2025 if Tehran does not reach a nuclear agreement with Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not rule out a preemptive strike. Iran has responded by asserting readiness to retaliate, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirming contingency plans for various conflict scenarios. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated on Friday that Tehran is willing to negotiate with the U.S., but only if the talks are substantive.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:02 PM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/world/1070364)\n\n**Experts: U.S. Hesitates on Military Action Against Iran Due to Strategic Concerns**\nRecent escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions has prompted the deployment of the U.S. Navy's 'Abraham Lincoln' carrier strike group to the Middle East, according to Israeli sources on January 25, 2026. Chinese expert Qin Tian, Deputy Director of the Middle East Department at the China Institute of Modern International Relations, notes that the U.S. military presence near Iran\u2014comprising the carrier strike group, pre-existing bases in the region, and the ability to launch long-range bombers from the U.S. mainland\u2014indicates that the military technical readiness for potential strikes against Iran is complete. However, the Trump administration has not yet made a final decision, citing strategic concerns. The primary dilemma lies in the cost-effectiveness of such action. Past U.S. military operations under Trump, such as those against Venezuela and the 2025 Israel-Iran conflict intervention, were characterized by rapid, low-cost strikes with minimal duration. The question now is whether a similar approach\u2014symbolic or limited strikes, or a prolonged campaign including a maritime blockade followed by targeted attacks\u2014can be successfully applied to Iran. To buy time for strategic deliberation, the administration is maintaining both military and diplomatic options on the table.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:51 AM\nSource:[news.cri.cn](https://news.cri.cn/20260128/9d3023d4-9f84-499d-b50e-3e45f4a176d4.html)\n\n**Washington Backs Down at the Last Minute from Strike on Iran: Behind the Scenes of 10 Days That Held the Region in Suspense**\nOn January 14, 2026, the United States reportedly retreated from launching a military strike on Iran at the last minute, despite widespread belief that President Donald Trump had approved the operation. According to four U.S. officials and Israeli sources, the decision followed intense internal deliberations within the Trump administration, driven by concerns over military readiness, regional pressures, and potential escalation. The decision came after Iran\u2019s security forces killed dozens of protesters and imposed near-total internet blackouts starting January 9, prompting initial support for a strike. Key developments included a high-level meeting chaired by Vice President J.D. Vance on January 9, a backchannel diplomatic effort led by Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and a critical phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that Israel was unprepared for a large-scale Iranian retaliation. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also expressed deep concern about regional instability. A pivotal moment occurred when Araghchi reportedly sent a message on January 14 promising to suspend planned executions and 'halt killings' of protesters. Despite the pause, U.S. officials confirmed that military options remain under active review, with White House spokesperson Caroline Leavitt stating, 'No one knows what President Trump will do about Iran except the President himself,' and warning that a new decision could be made within weeks if the situation deteriorates or diplomatic efforts fail.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 04:06 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/8209568)\n\n**Strategizing on Iran: Trump's Crucial Briefing | Politics**\nU.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with key officials on Tuesday, January 11, 2026, to discuss potential responses to ongoing protests in Iran, according to unnamed U.S. sources cited by The Wall Street Journal.

Although Trump has not made a final decision, he has repeatedly warned that Iran will face 'severe strikes' if its leaders continue killing protesters. According to unnamed U.S. officials, Trump is evaluating options, including targeting non-military sites in Tehran, as part of secret deliberations. The protests, which began in late December 2025 over economic crises, have evolved into calls for fundamental political change. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have declared they will not back down. Trump has emphasized that any strike would not involve ground troops but would be 'harsh and painful' to Iran's leadership. U.S. officials stress the need for caution to avoid unintended consequences, such as unifying Iranian public opinion behind the government or provoking retaliatory attacks. Defense officials note that military readiness and regional positioning require additional time before any action. This potential strike follows Trump\u2019s previous military actions in June 2025, when he ordered 'Midnight Hammer' operations\u2014air and submarine strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014resulting in Iranian missile retaliation and an offer to resume nuclear talks. Trump also discussed Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting in January 2026, reaffirming support for Israeli strikes if Iran continues advancing its capabilities. The U.S. State Department released a video on January 10, 2026, commemorating the strike on Venezuela, reinforcing Trump\u2019s reputation for following through on threats. Since the start of his second term, Trump has authorized airstrikes in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Nigeria. In his first term, he ordered a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020 that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 06:27 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/trump-america-iran-options-protests)\n\n**'Trump Received Military Strike Options Against Iran Amid Protest Crackdown'**\nAccording to the AsiaEconomy report published on January 11, 2026, former U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering military strike options against Iran in response to the bloodshed during anti-government protests. The New York Times (NYT), citing multiple officials, reported that Trump had received multiple military strike alternatives targeting Iran in recent days. Although no final decision has been made, officials stated that Trump is seriously deliberating a response to Iran\u2019s crackdown on protests. On Truth Social, Trump stated, 'Iran is perhaps closer than ever to freedom' and emphasized that 'the U.S. is ready to help.' The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) also reported that the U.S. government has been conducting preliminary discussions on potential attack plans in preparation for possible action. A senior U.S. military official told NYT that regional commanders need more time to strengthen defenses and prepare for potential retaliatory strikes from Iran. This follows Trump\u2019s 2023 actions when, after escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, he authorized surprise strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities\u2014Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014after repeated verbal pressure. According to human rights monitoring group HRANA, as of January 9, 2026, a total of 65 people, including 50 anti-government protesters, had been killed in Iran\u2019s crackdown.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 06:16 AM\nSource:[\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uacbd\uc81c](https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2026011115163044109)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nThe Trump administration is currently engaged in intensive internal deliberations regarding potential military action against Iran, with decisions reportedly imminent as high-stakes negotiations are scheduled for February 26, 2026 in Geneva [1][7]. The administration is weighing a range of military options from limited targeted strikes to broader regime change operations, creating significant uncertainty about the final strategic objective [19].\n\n**Nature of Deliberations**\n\nAccording to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Axios, President Trump has instructed his team to prepare options for \"rapid and decisive\" military strikes designed to avoid prolonged conflict, while simultaneously considering broader campaigns targeting regime change if initial operations prove insufficient [1][17]. The planning has reached an advanced stage, including detailed options for targeted attacks on Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, nuclear facilities, and ballistic missile programs [1][9]. However, significant disagreement persists within the administration regarding the ultimate goal, with some officials advocating for limited strikes to pressure Iran into a nuclear deal, while hardliners push for exploiting what they view as a rare window for regime change following Iran's brutal suppression of domestic protests in late December 2025 and January 2026 [5][6].\n\n**The Two-Phase Strategy**\n\nA central element of current deliberations involves a potential two-phase military approach. According to sources briefed on internal discussions, Trump is weighing an initial limited strike to pressure Tehran into abandoning its nuclear program, followed by larger-scale attacks aimed at Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the broader regime infrastructure if diplomatic efforts fail [9]. This strategy reflects Trump's apparent preference for a diplomatic solution\u2014driven by concerns about unpredictability and lack of clear exit strategies in military conflict\u2014while maintaining credible military leverage [2][3]. However, military officials have reportedly expressed skepticism about whether airstrikes alone can achieve regime change, noting that destroying Iran's hardened, dispersed, and underground nuclear facilities would require prolonged operations beyond the administration's stated desire for quick, decisive action [4][9].\n\n**Military Posture and Timing**\n\nThe deliberations are occurring against the backdrop of the largest U.S. military buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 Iraq invasion. The administration has deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups (USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald R. Ford), approximately 40,000 troops, over 90 aircraft across seven air wings, and advanced missile defense systems including Patriot and THAAD batteries [6][8][12][15]. Officials have indicated that military assets are positioned to enable strikes potentially within hours or days, with some reports suggesting a 90% chance of military action within the next few weeks according to senior aides [12][15][20].\n\n**Diplomatic Context and Pressures**\n\nThe military deliberations are running parallel to last-ditch diplomatic efforts. Following the breakdown of indirect talks in Geneva on February 17, 2026, the administration has set a ten-day deadline for Iran to present detailed proposals, with the February 26 meeting viewed as a final opportunity to avert military action [6][7]. Trump has publicly stated he prefers a diplomatic path but has established \"red lines\" that Iran has not yet accepted, particularly regarding the complete cessation of uranium enrichment and dismantling of ballistic missile capabilities [14][16].\n\nExternal pressures significantly complicate the deliberations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has actively pushed Trump toward military action, citing Iran as an existential threat and arguing that prior strikes have been insufficient to degrade Iranian capabilities [1][4]. Conversely, Gulf Arab monarchies have warned against intervention, fearing regional destabilization and potential targeting of their own territories [11]. Russia has also cautioned against attacks, warning of severe consequences and potential nuclear incidents [13].\n\n**Constraints and Uncertainties**\n\nMultiple factors constrain the administration's options. Intelligence assessments indicate the U.S. may only sustain a high-intensity air campaign for 4 to 5 days before logistical constraints force reduced operations, given the complexity of targeting Iran's geography and hardened facilities [5]. Additionally, Iran's robust deterrence strategy\u2014including missile forces, regional proxy networks, and capacity to disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz\u2014raises concerns that even limited strikes could trigger uncontrollable escalation [4]. Iranian officials have explicitly warned that any attack would cross a \"red line\" and trigger \"resolute and appropriate\" responses, potentially including regional war [1][10].\n\n**Current Status**\n\nAs of February 26, 2026, the administration appears to be maintaining deliberate ambiguity regarding its final intentions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has emphasized that diplomacy remains the first option, while simultaneously noting \"many reasons and arguments\" for military strikes [13]. Trump himself has used ambiguous language to keep strategic objectives confidential, and officials acknowledge he may make a final decision at the last moment [17][19]. The situation remains fluid, with the outcome of the Geneva talks likely to prove decisive in determining whether the administration proceeds with its planned military options or pursues a negotiated settlement potentially allowing limited Iranian enrichment for medical purposes [7][9].\n</Asknews_articles>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/confrontation-between-united-states-and-iran\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://iranhumanrights.org/2026/01/iranian-authorities-intensify-crackdown-on-protests-with-live-fire-arbitrary-arrests-and-attacks-on-hospitals/\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mgndkklvmo\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: US Iran backchannel negotiations ceasefire 2026\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Geneva at a Crossroads: Iran-US Talks Decide the Fate of Peace Amid Global Crises**\nOn February 26, 2026, pivotal diplomatic talks took place in Geneva between Iran and the United States, marking what could be the final opportunity to prevent military escalation before Donald Trump potentially implements his war threats. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghtschi, and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met amid heightened tensions over Iran's nuclear program, with the U.S. demanding strict limits on uranium enrichment and Iran asserting its right to peaceful nuclear technology. The U.S. accused Iran of developing long-range missiles capable of reaching U.S. territory and claimed the Iranian regime killed 32,000 people during recent protests, while Iran dismissed these claims as 'great lies.' According to the Times of Israel, Iran refused to open a U.S.-proposed package of rocket-related proposals during a prior round, yet Iran's foreign minister stated after the latest session that both sides had agreed on 'guiding principles.' The U.S. has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region, raising fears of a second military strike in less than a year, following the June 2025 attacks on Iranian military and nuclear sites. The outcome of the Geneva talks will determine whether diplomacy continues or war looms. If talks fail, i24NEWS reported that 'the chances for a diplomatic resolution have been exhausted, and therefore an attack may proceed.' A key figure in the process is Ali Larijani, Khamenei\u2019s senior advisor, who is expected to transmit Iran\u2019s draft agreement via Omani mediators. Simultaneously, Ukraine peace negotiations were underway in Geneva, making the city a global focal point for multiple crises.

The U.S., under President Trump, has issued a 'final ultimatum' with a 15-day deadline, warning that if Iran does not demonstrate genuine commitment, military action will follow. The U.S. is pushing for a comprehensive 'package deal' that includes Iran\u2019s nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, regional proxy support, and domestic human rights issues. Iran, however, insists on discussing only nuclear issues, rejecting any linkage to other topics. Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that the prospects for negotiations are 'bright,' emphasizing the need to move beyond the current 'neither war nor peace' situation. The U.S. insists Iran must halt uranium enrichment beyond 60%\u2014close to weapons-grade 90%\u2014and remove enriched material from the country, while Iran is willing only to dilute its enriched uranium. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that Iran\u2019s refusal to discuss ballistic missiles is a major obstacle. Internal instability in Iran, including a crackdown on anti-government protests, has heightened the regime\u2019s vulnerability, making concessions riskier. The New York Times reports that Iran\u2019s clerical leadership views U.S. demands as existential threats to the regime. Past U.S. military actions, such as the 12-day war in 2023, were met with limited retaliation, but current conditions may lead to broader escalation. However, the U.S. faces significant military constraints: depleted munitions stocks from ongoing operations in Ukraine and Israel, high risk of casualties, and no plans for large-scale ground warfare. The U.S. military, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, has warned that a full-scale campaign against Iran would be a high-risk, long-term operation. Analysts suggest limited strikes may not yield results, while regime-targeted operations could trigger prolonged conflict. The outcome hinges on whether Iran makes meaningful concessions before the deadline.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 02:58 AM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202602261146454909)\n\n**Iran Announces New Round of Indirect Talks with US in Geneva - Al-Manar TV Lebanon**\nThe Iranian government announced a new round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States, scheduled for Thursday, February 25, 2026, in Geneva.

The United States abstained, citing concerns that the resolution could hinder ongoing negotiations, as explained by U.S. Deputy UN Ambassador Tammy Bruce, who stated that 'peace requires sacrifice and compromise.' Abstentions totaled 51 countries, including China and India, while 12 nations, such as Russia and Iran, opposed the resolution. The resolution, submitted by Ukraine, demanded an immediate, unconditional, and complete ceasefire, the realization of a comprehensive and sustainable peace based on international law, the full exchange of prisoners, the return of forcibly displaced civilians including children, and strong support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Marianna Bezha criticized Russia for lacking genuine intent to halt its invasion and emphasized Ukraine\u2019s willingness to accept a difficult compromise, including a ceasefire at the current front lines. The resolution omitted demands for Russian troop withdrawal and strong condemnation of Russia, likely to accommodate U.S. diplomatic concerns. This marks a shift from the previous UNGA resolution under the pre-Trump administration, which had included such demands and received U.S. support; in contrast, the Trump administration had opposed a similar resolution in February 2025. Although the U.S. did not oppose this resolution, its abstention highlights ongoing divergence in alignment with European allies.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 02:42 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/world/20260225-GYT1T00124/)\n\n**A timeline of tensions over Iran's nuclear program as talks with U.S. approach**\nIran and the United States are set to hold new nuclear talks in Geneva on February 26, 2026, amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East\u2014the largest in decades\u2014under President Donald Trump's administration. The talks follow escalating tensions, including Iran's announcement of a third nuclear enrichment facility on June 12, 2025, after the International Atomic Energy Agency found Iran in noncompliance. Israel launched a war against Iran on June 13, 2025, targeting nuclear and military sites, prompting U.S. intervention on June 22, 2025, when it attacked three Iranian nuclear sites. Iran retaliated on June 23, 2025, by striking a U.S. military base in Qatar. Trump declared a ceasefire on June 24, 2025, but diplomatic efforts continued through multiple rounds of indirect talks in Oman, Rome, and Geneva. By August 2025, France, Germany, and the UK initiated the 'snapback' of UN sanctions, which were confirmed by the UN Security Council on September 28, 2025. Despite a temporary agreement with the IAEA on September 9, 2025, implementation remains uncertain. Meanwhile, domestic unrest in Iran intensified after the rial collapsed to 1.42 million per dollar on December 28, 2025, triggering nationwide protests. The government responded with internet blackouts and a violent crackdown, resulting in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands detained. On January 3, 2026, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei authorized harsh measures against 'rioters,' and on January 8, 2026, a mass protest was sparked by the exiled crown prince. Trump canceled further meetings on January 13, 2026, but the USS Abraham Lincoln and three warships arrived in the region on February 3, 2026. On February 6, a U.S. fighter jet shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea, and Iranian fast-attack boats challenged a U.S.-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran temporarily closed the Strait on February 17, 2026, as the next round of talks approached.

Al-Raji emphasized on social media that Lebanon is actively pursuing diplomatic and political efforts to prevent the country from being drawn into regional war. According to Israeli media reports from February 23, 2026, Israeli and U.S. military forces are coordinating closely in preparation for a potential breakdown in U.S.-Iran negotiations. Although a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Lebanon in November 2024, Israeli forces have continued frequent airstrikes on Lebanon, citing Hezbollah's alleged violations of the truce. On February 22, 2026, Oman\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr confirmed that a new round of U.S.-Iran indirect talks is scheduled for February 26 in Geneva, following a previous round on February 17, 2026, which both sides described as having made progress despite ongoing disagreements. Meanwhile, the U.S. has significantly increased its military presence in the Middle East, and President Trump recently acknowledged considering 'limited military strikes' against Iran.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 11:47 PM\nSource:[news.cn](https://www.news.cn/world/20260225/4f857ebde87141b2be25bdd5a2c71109/c.html)\n\n**Iranian Foreign Minister: U.S. Talks Resume Thursday, Agreement Within Reach If Diplomacy Prevails**\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced that Iran will resume talks with the United States on Thursday, February 27, 2026, stating that a fair and balanced agreement is within reach if diplomacy is prioritized. According to reports from Al-Qahira News Channel, Araghchi emphasized that the goal of the negotiations is to achieve mutual interests through a just and sustainable agreement. He noted that an agreement is 'within reach' but depends on genuine commitment to diplomatic dialogue and resolving differences through negotiation. Iran views the talks as an opportunity to find realistic, long-term solutions to existing disputes, promoting regional stability and reducing tensions. Araghchi reaffirmed that Iran will not compromise on its national sovereignty and will take any necessary measures to protect its interests, stressing that pursuing diplomacy does not mean abandoning core principles but rather achieving a balance between sovereignty and political engagement. The minister concluded by affirming Iran\u2019s commitment to seeking a peaceful resolution to disputes with the U.S. through dialogue and mutual understanding, aiming to ease tensions and open a new chapter in bilateral relations.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 10:20 PM\nSource:[elfagr.org](https://www.elfagr.org/5283937)\n\n**Iran Shows Optimism for Nuclear Deal with U.S. Amid Escalating Tensions and Military Threats**\nIran and the United States are entering a new round of negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, with Iran expressing optimism about reaching a deal, according to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghi. Araghi stated on X that a breakthrough is 'within reach\u2014if diplomacy is prioritized,' emphasizing Iran's willingness to pursue an agreement that respects mutual interests and peaceful nuclear energy use. Iran reaffirmed it 'will never develop a nuclear weapon' but insists on its right to peaceful nuclear energy. Vice Foreign Minister Madschid Tacht-Rawanchi affirmed Iran's readiness to act in good faith in negotiations in Geneva, while warning that any U.S. attack would trigger a strong response. The U.S. demands include a halt to uranium enrichment, limits on ballistic missiles, and an end to support for regional allies such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi militia. Iran has shown flexibility on its nuclear program but considers its missile program a red line. The talks resumed in February 2026 after a hiatus, following U.S. pressure and threats of military action. The U.S. had previously withdrawn from the 2015 nuclear deal under Donald Trump in 2018, prompting Iran to increase enrichment. In June 2025, Israel and the U.S. launched a 12-day military campaign against Iranian nuclear facilities, severely damaging the Fordo site, which ended in a ceasefire. The U.S. has since increased its military presence in the region, and Iran has warned of 'full-force retaliation' in case of further aggression.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 08:58 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Iran-zeigt-sich-fuer-Einigung-mit-den-USA-optimistisch-id30401207.html)\n\n**Iran Strikes Covert Missile Deal With Moscow In Backchannel Rearmament**\nAccording to the Financial Times, Russia has entered into a covert arms deal with Iran worth 500 million Euros, signed in December 2025, to supply thousands of advanced shoulder-fired missiles. The agreement, negotiated between Russia\u2019s state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), includes the delivery of 500 'Verba' launch units and 2,500 '9M336' missiles over three years. The '9M336' missiles are priced at \u20ac170,000 each. The deal aims to rebuild Iran\u2019s air defenses, which were severely degraded during Israeli-US airstrikes in June 2025. The Verba systems are considered a low-cost option for Russia, allowing Moscow to bolster Iran\u2019s deterrent capability without depleting its own inventory, crucial for ongoing operations in Ukraine and potential future confrontations with NATO. This arms transfer coincides with rare joint naval drills between Russian and Iranian forces, including the IRGC, signaling strategic cooperation. While Russia and China are unlikely to provide direct military aid to Iran in the event of a U.S. attack, they are expected to jointly condemn any such action at the UN Security Council and oppose a new Iraq-style war in the Middle East, fearing regional instability. The deal was confirmed through leaked Russian documents obtained by the Financial Times and verified by Zero Hedge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 08:45 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/iran-strikes-covert-missile-deal-moscow-backchannel-rearmament)\n\n**Iran Shows Willingness to Compromise Ahead of New US Talks**\nPrior to the third round of talks with the United States, Iran has expressed willingness to reach a rapid agreement, with Vice Foreign Minister Madschid Tacht-Rawanchi stating that Tehran is prepared to take all necessary steps to achieve a deal. He warned that any U.S. attack on Iran would be 'a real gamble.' The negotiations, mediated by Oman, are set to resume in Geneva on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action if no agreement is reached, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt affirming that diplomacy remains Trump's first choice, but lethal force is a fallback. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the region. Washington demands that Iran halt uranium enrichment entirely, cap its ballistic missile program, and cease supporting regional allies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and the Houthi militia in Yemen. Iran has shown flexibility on its nuclear program but has repeatedly declared its missile program a 'red line' that cannot be crossed. The U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in 2018, prompting Iran to resume enriched uranium production. In June 2025, Israel and the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the key Fordo site, which was reported by Iran to have been 'seriously and heavily damaged' after 12 days of conflict, ending in a ceasefire.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 04:35 PM\nSource:[ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2026-02/iran-usa-gespraeche-genf-atomprogramm-donald-trump)\n\n**Global Developments in February 2026: Iran's Military Prep, EU-China Trade Tensions, Gaza Ceasefire Fragility, and U.S. Political Crises**\nThe GLOPOL Bulletin summarizes key global developments as of February 24, 2026. Iran is reportedly strengthening its nuclear and military infrastructure\u2014particularly at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites\u2014amid concerns over a potential U.S. or Israeli strike, with experts noting the reinforcement of underground facilities and relocation of critical equipment. The European Commission is pushing to revise the WTO\u2019s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principle, arguing that China\u2019s access to the EU market should be reciprocal, citing a \u20ac359 billion trade deficit with China in 2025. The peace process between Azerbaijan and Armenia is resuming with renewed diplomacy, focusing on border demarcation, territorial integrity, and transport routes, though progress remains fragile due to mistrust and political sensitivities. In Pakistan, post-election political tensions persist, with opposition allegations of irregularities, PTI-led protests, and a coalition government now likely amid an economic crisis and high inflation. Former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol was sentenced to life in prison in December 2024 for leading an insurrection, including declaring martial law and attempting to detain lawmakers, and is also accused of ordering drones to North Korea. The U.S. 'Board of Peace,' established under President Donald Trump, held its first meeting in February 2026, pledging $10 billion for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction and proposing a 20,000-member International Stability Force, while Trump implied it could eventually replace the UN\u2014though major European nations like the UK, France, and Germany declined to join. The U.S. and International Energy Agency (IEA) are deepening their rift over energy policy, with the U.S. accusing the IEA of losing neutrality and threatening to cut funding, while the IEA insists clean energy transition is inevitable. Ceasefire talks in Gaza remain fragile, with Israeli violations undermining the truce and humanitarian aid delivery still conditional, despite UN calls for progress. The U.S. faces a government shutdown risk after Congress failed to pass a 2026 budget, leading to a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with Republicans demanding spending cuts and tighter immigration controls, while Democrats warn of economic and service disruptions. The UK has agreed with Germany, France, Italy, and Poland on a joint drone defence initiative, aiming to develop low-cost, autonomous drones and boost European defence cooperation, inspired by Ukraine\u2019s rapid drone industry growth, with each nation committing millions in funding, though the full budget remains unconfirmed.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 08:54 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@global.policy/glopol-bulletin-c4580da1668c)\n\n**New Washington-Tehran Talks Begin Amid Regional Tensions and Global Security Concerns**\nOn Thursday, new negotiations between Washington and Tehran are underway, amid escalating regional tensions. The Pentagon has warned of the risks associated with a prolonged military campaign against Iran. The U.S. has renewed accusations against Beijing, claiming China is expanding its nuclear arsenal and conducting nuclear tests. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have jointly affirmed the necessity for all parties to uphold the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. In Syria, four security personnel were killed by militants from the ISIS terrorist group. Iran has issued a warning stating that while enemies may initiate war, they will not be able to dictate its conclusion. Meanwhile, diplomatic talks are taking place among the U.S., Russia, and China to discuss nuclear arms reduction. Former U.S. President Donald Trump denied any disagreement with the U.S. Army Chief of Staff regarding Iran.

The U.S. continues to maintain its highest travel advisory level (Level 4) for Lebanon, advising against all travel. The State Department cited increased risks in certain areas, particularly near borders, and warned of ongoing planning by terrorist groups for potential attacks within Lebanon. A senior U.S. State Department official, speaking anonymously, stated the decision was a temporary measure to ensure staff safety while preserving the embassy\u2019s ability to assist American citizens. According to a Lebanese security source, approximately 40 employees left the embassy via Beirut International Airport on Monday. The move comes amid regional escalation following the October 7, 2023 attacks, with Israel intensifying airstrikes in southern Lebanon despite a ceasefire that took effect in November 2024. The U.S. action follows a parallel warning from Iran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister, Kazem Gharib Abadi, at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, who urged nations committed to peace to take meaningful steps to prevent further escalation. Gharib Abadi emphasized that any new aggression against Iran would have consequences beyond a single country and reiterated Iran\u2019s commitment to diplomacy and dialogue. He highlighted the ongoing diplomatic efforts in Geneva\u2014set to resume on Thursday\u2014as a potential path to de-escalation, contingent on mutual respect and equal application of international standards. Meanwhile, the U.S. has increased military presence in the Middle East, deploying additional aircraft carriers, air and naval forces, and warning of 'very bad things' if no nuclear deal is reached with Iran. President Donald Trump reiterated the possibility of military action if negotiations fail. In June 2025, U.S. and Israeli forces conducted strikes on three major Iranian nuclear sites. Iran has repeatedly claimed it has recovered from the damage and that its nuclear capabilities are stronger than ever.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 06:37 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://arabic.euronews.com/2026/02/23/us-lebanon-iran-beirut-geneva-warning-evacuation-embassy)\n\n**\u3010After Peace Comes Risk\u3011Ukraine Faces Hidden Dangers as U.S. and Russia Pursue Ceasefire 'Backchannels' \u2014 Will Putin-Kremlin Talks Reshape History?**\nThe article explores the potential risks Ukraine may face after a peace agreement with Russia, focusing on the implications of a possible U.S.-Russia mediated ceasefire under a potential Trump administration. According to Professor Yoko Hirose of Keio University, while a ceasefire remains unlikely in the near term, Trump\u2019s 'hidden card' in diplomatic efforts could involve a backchannel strategy favoring Russia. The article discusses the possibility of a Putin-Kremlin leadership meeting, the strategic significance of Moldova as a potential future scenario for Ukraine, and the deepening crisis within Russian society, particularly the issue of returning soldiers from the war. It also highlights Ukraine\u2019s harsh winter conditions, the severe demographic decline, and the shifting perception of Ukraine\u2019s value in Europe. Despite Putin\u2019s potential departure, the article suggests Russia\u2019s systemic nature will remain unchanged.

This dual mandate has raised concerns among foreign policy experts about the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach. Brett Bruen, a former Obama foreign policy adviser, criticized the strategy as prioritizing quantity over quality, stating it lacks the depth required for complex diplomacy. The Iran talks, mediated by Oman, lasted three-and-a-half hours and yielded no immediate agreement, though both sides acknowledged some progress. The US team then immediately shifted to negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, with low expectations for breakthroughs. A regional official close to Iran\u2019s leadership likened the situation to an emergency room with two critically ill patients and only one doctor, warning of increased risk of failure. Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre called the assignment of Witkoff and Kushner to resolve global crises 'a shocking reality.' Critics argue that both envoys, drawn from Trump\u2019s New York real estate circle, lack the experience and institutional knowledge to match seasoned negotiators like Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi or Russian counterparts. Notably absent from the Geneva meetings was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a foreign policy expert. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the team, claiming Trump had done more than anyone to bring peace to Ukraine, while dismissing anonymous critics without addressing specific questions. Analysts highlight that the effectiveness of Witkoff and Kushner has been weakened by Trump\u2019s dismantling of the State Department and National Security Council, resulting in a 'hollowing-out of our diplomatic bench,' as noted by Bruen. Despite prior successes\u2014such as the 2024 Gaza ceasefire and the Abraham Accords\u2014progress on current negotiations has stalled, underscoring concerns about the sustainability of Trump\u2019s unconventional diplomatic model.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[Irish Independent](https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/juggling-two-wars-at-the-same-time-is-a-tall-order-for-donald-trumps-two-man-negotiating-team/a366100490.html)\n\n**U.S. Plans Back-to-Back Talks on Ukraine and Iran in Geneva \u2013 Reuters**\nOn February 17, 2026, in Geneva, Switzerland, two rounds of diplomatic consultations are scheduled. The first session involves U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner meeting with Iran, mediated by Omani representatives. The second session, in the afternoon, features a trilateral dialogue with delegations from Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. delegation, led by Witkoff and Kushner, aims to negotiate with Iran, with President Trump previously stating that talks could last up to a month and threatening military action if Iran refuses a deal. The U.S. has increased military presence in the region and intensified pressure on Iran following its crackdown on protesters. Simultaneously, the U.S. seeks to push Ukraine and Russia toward a ceasefire agreement to end the four-year war. Russia plans to send at least 15 officials, including Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin and Vladimir Medinsky. Ukraine\u2019s delegation, approved by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, includes Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umierov and Head of the Office of the President Kyrylo Budanov.

The meeting focused on integrating Israel\u2019s demands into the U.S. negotiation strategy. Israel seeks strict conditions from Iran, including a halt to uranium enrichment, limiting ballistic missile range to 300 km, and ending support for proxy forces in the Middle East. In contrast, Iran insists on discussing only nuclear program and sanctions relief, refusing to abandon its right to uranium enrichment. Trump has been intensifying military pressure by deploying aircraft carrier groups to the region and warning of potential airstrikes if a deal is not reached, echoing his 2023 threat to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. CNN reported that Netanyahu plans to discuss military options with Trump should the negotiations fail. Additionally, the meeting is expected to address the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, with Trump pushing for rapid reconstruction efforts, while Israel insists that Hamas\u2019s disarmament must come first.

The article notes that the U.S. administration has responded to calls from multiple Arab and regional countries to pursue a diplomatic resolution with Iran, in order to prevent a new war that could worsen regional security and ongoing crises. Al-Ahram argues that Israel perceives both the Peace Council and U.S.-Iran negotiations as threats to its agenda: the former would increase pressure on Israel to implement the second phase of the Sharm El-Sheikh Agreement, which Israel has repeatedly sought to evade, while ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza have led to over 2,000 Palestinian casualties\u2014including more than 1,500 violations of the ceasefire agreement. Additionally, Israel fears that U.S.-Iran talks might result in a deal focused only on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, excluding restrictions on its missile program, which Israel opposes. The newspaper asserts that Israel aims to block diplomatic solutions and push the U.S. toward military action. The article concludes that these two issues will be central to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming visit to Washington on February 11, 2026, as he seeks to undermine these initiatives to strengthen his political position ahead of the upcoming Knesset elections.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:34 AM\nSource:[Elnashra News](https://www.elnashra.com/news/show/1761250/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B0%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A7)\n\n**Netanyahu\u2019s Surprise Visit to Washington Amid U.S.-Iran Talks and Fears of a U.S. Strategic Shift**\nIsrael expressed concern over the outcomes of the first direct U.S.-Iran negotiations since the June 2023 12-day war, held in Muscat, Oman, on Friday, February 7, 2026. The talks, described as serious and positive, are expected to continue with a second round planned for the following week. Despite this, Israel, particularly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reacted with unease, prompting an unexpected early visit to Washington, D.C., scheduled for Wednesday, February 11, 2026\u2014ten days ahead of the original plan. According to Israeli sources cited by the German Press Agency (dpa), Netanyahu will request that President Donald Trump demand Iran\u2019s complete nuclear program dismantlement, prohibit uranium enrichment, remove enriched uranium from Iran, limit Iranian missile range to 300 km, and dismantle Iran\u2019s regional military arms. The Israeli media, including Channel 14 and Channel 12, emphasized that the talks are limited to the nuclear issue only and warned of potential U.S. retreat from prior agreements with Israel. The U.S. presence of envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea was interpreted as a military signal. Channel 12 reported that the U.S. has completed Phase 1 of preparations for a 'very large strike' against Iran and is advancing to Phase 2. A U.S. official stated, 'We will soon know where this is headed, and Iran must show real seriousness and make genuine concessions.' Israel\u2019s military radio noted that the Air Force Chief will accompany Netanyahu, a rare move indicating high stakes. Analysts suggest Israel seeks to declare negotiation failure and push for war, while the U.S. may have different strategic calculations. The delay in a potential strike has angered Israel. There are also concerns that the Gaza scenario may repeat, as Trump abandoned plans for mass Palestinian displacement and instead proposed a ceasefire with Palestinians remaining in Gaza and reconstruction. Iran, while acknowledging the positive tone of the Muscat talks, reiterated that negotiations are limited to the nuclear file and warned of a decisive response if attacked, threatening regional war.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 04:41 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/iran/2026/02/09/%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A)\n\n**2026 Middle East Outlook: Conflict Remains Central, Stability Remains Elusive**\nIn 2025, the Middle East experienced ongoing and intertwined conflicts, with security conditions remaining volatile. A fragile ceasefire was achieved between Israel and Palestine, but peace talks advanced slowly. Iran witnessed nationwide mass protests, while the U.S. and Israel repeatedly issued threats of military action. Israel conducted extensive military operations across multiple fronts, damaging its international reputation. The U.S. appeared to both 'extinguish fires' and 'ignite them,' revealing a pattern of political opportunism in its Middle East policy. According to experts from the Ningxia University Institute of Chinese-Arab States and the China Institute of Modern International Relations, key shifts in 2025 included the strengthening of Israel\u2019s military expansionism, a significant weakening of Iran and its 'resistance arc' allies, and rising economic and diplomatic influence of Gulf states like Saudi Arabia. The regional security landscape is described as mixed: temporary calm was observed in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran-Israel tensions, but no substantive resolution was achieved. Three trends were identified: U.S.-Israel strategic dominance, particularly highlighted by the 12-day June 2025 campaign against Iran\u2019s military and nuclear facilities; Iran\u2019s declining regional influence; and the rising power of regional actors like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who filled gaps left by Iran\u2019s retreat. Looking ahead to 2026, experts predict three possible scenarios in Gaza: renewed large-scale war if no compromise is reached; prolonged stalemate with Israel controlling 53% of the territory and ongoing aerial strikes; or a negotiated agreement under U.S. and Gulf pressure involving phased disarmament of Hamas. Regional perceptions of Israel remain negative, with Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia expressing growing concern and potential for coordinated efforts to counterbalance Israeli dominance. The risk of renewed U.S.-Israeli military action against Iran remains high, especially if domestic unrest in Iran intensifies, as such unrest is seen as an opportunity to pressure the regime. The U.S. strategy is characterized as 'opportunistic intervention'\u2014acting swiftly on quick wins like bombing Iran\u2019s nuclear sites or securing temporary ceasefires, while avoiding long-term commitments on core issues like post-war Gaza governance or the two-state solution. In 2026, the region faces two major contradictions: U.S. short-term military interventionism versus regional peace and stability, and Israel\u2019s military adventurism threatening regional equilibrium. Additionally, a growing trend of fragmentation is evident across the region, with weakening cohesion in Iran\u2019s alliance network, rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and ongoing instability in Syria, Yemen, and Iran itself.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 09:50 AM\nSource:[news.cn](https://www.news.cn/world/20260116/69665461532148da9a1ad561339ee8b2/c.html)\n\n**Iran's Foreign Ministry reveals ongoing diplomatic backchannel with U.S.**\nIran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei confirmed on January 12, 2026, that a direct diplomatic backchannel exists between Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff, used to convey necessary messages between the two countries. Baghaei emphasized that Iran has consistently adhered to diplomacy and negotiation, rejecting unilateral talks that lack mutual goals, stating such approaches lead to strategic uncertainty. Five rounds of indirect talks on Iran's nuclear program were held between April 12 and May 23, 2025, mediated by Oman\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, with sessions in Muscat and Rome. The talks were followed by escalating military actions: on June 13, 2025, Israel launched air strikes on Iran, killing high-ranking officials; Iran retaliated on June 13 with Operation True Promise III, launching hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones at Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties. On June 22, the U.S. conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, reportedly destroying them. Iran responded on June 23 by attacking a U.S. military base in Qatar. On June 24, 2025, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office announced a ceasefire with Iran, brokered by former U.S. President Donald Trump, and Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council confirmed the cessation of hostilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 05:06 PM\nSource:[Trend News Agency](https://www.trend.az/iran/nuclearp/4140491.html)\n\n**Trump to Meet Netanyahu in Florida Amid Stalled Gaza Ceasefire and Rising U.S. Frustration**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with former U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Monday, marking their fifth meeting in the United States since Trump's return to the White House nearly a year ago. The discussions will focus on major issues including Iran's nuclear program, the future of the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, and the stalled second phase of the truce agreement. This phase involves Hamas's disarmament, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, the establishment of a transitional Palestinian authority, and the deployment of an international stabilization force. According to Israeli and U.S. sources, the U.S. administration is increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu\u2019s actions, which are seen as undermining the ceasefire and peace process. Analysts, including Gershon Baskin and Yossi Mekelberg, emphasize that the second phase is in a state of impasse, with Israel demanding the return of a final hostage before negotiations proceed. The U.S. reportedly plans to announce a technocratic Palestinian transitional government soon. Netanyahu\u2019s focus on Iran\u2014highlighted by recent media coverage of Iran\u2019s missile advancements\u2014is seen as a strategic effort to divert attention from domestic political challenges ahead of the 2026 elections. Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and leader of one of the country\u2019s most right-wing governments, is widely viewed as using the meeting to bolster his political standing.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/international/rencontre-netanyahu-trump-lundi-en-floride-3025694.html)\n\n**U.S. Envoy: Gaza Ceasefire Phase Two to Launch in January 2026**\nU.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff informed intermediaries that Phase Two of the Gaza ceasefire agreement will begin in January 2026. According to Israel's Channel 13, Witkoff conveyed this to Israel and mediators, stating that Phase Two includes establishing a temporary technocratic committee to manage the Gaza Strip, an infrastructure reconstruction file, forming a Peace Council, creating an international force, additional Israeli military withdrawal, and disarming Hamas. This follows a statement by Witkoff after talks with representatives from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey in Miami, where he confirmed that Phase One achieved notable progress, including expanded humanitarian aid, the return of hostages, partial troop withdrawal, and reduced hostilities. Witkoff emphasized the need for a unified authority in Gaza to protect civilians and maintain public order, expressed support for establishing and activating the Peace Council in the near term as a governance mechanism beyond reconstruction, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan. He called on all parties to fulfill their commitments, exercise restraint, cooperate with monitoring mechanisms, and stressed that consultations will continue in the coming weeks to advance Phase Two implementation. A meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, scheduled for December 29, 2025, in Miami, is expected to conclude with a statement on progress toward Phase Two, with agenda items focusing on Gaza ceasefire steps and the Iranian issue, particularly Hamas disarmament and the establishment of alternative governance structures in Gaza.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 26, 2025 05:08 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642](https://al-sharq.com/article/26/12/2025/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on my research into current news reports from February 2026, I can provide you with the following information regarding U.S.-Iran relations and diplomatic contacts:\n\n**Current Status of Negotiations**\n\nAs of late February 2026, there are reports of potential backchannel or indirect negotiations on the horizon, though no ceasefire agreement currently exists between the United States and Iran. High-ranking Iranian officials informed Reuters that indirect talks between Iran and the United States may take place in March 2026, with the possibility of reaching what was described as a \"temporary agreement\" or interim deal [13]. However, just days earlier, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs explicitly denied media reports claiming that a temporary agreement with Washington already existed, stating such claims were \"entirely unrelated to reality\" [12].\n\n**Diplomatic Positions and Preconditions**\n\nIran has established clear conditions for entering negotiations. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf stated that Iran is prepared to enter negotiations only if they are based on \"respect for Iranian dignity and mutual interests\" [6]. He warned that if \"deception, lies, misleading information, or an attack occurs during talks, the other side will inevitably face the bitter consequences of an Iranian response\" [6]. This suggests that while backchannel communications may be ongoing, any formal negotiation framework remains fragile and contingent on mutual trust.\n\n**Military Buildup and \"Pressure Without Commitment\" Strategy**\n\nThe potential for talks occurs against a backdrop of significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East. President Trump addressed what he described as a \"vast armada\" of naval and military assets in the region\u2014the largest since the 2003 Iraq invasion\u2014during his February 24, 2026 State of the Union address [4][11]. Analysts characterize Trump's approach as \"pressure without commitment,\" using heightened threats and military posturing to psychologically pressure adversaries while testing reactions before engaging diplomatically [8]. One expert from the Hudson Institute estimated an \"80% chance\" of a military strike against Iran in the near future, though noting direct negotiations would likely precede such action [3].\n\n**Congressional and Expert Concerns**\n\nSenator Tim Kaine has indicated he will bring an Iran war powers resolution to the Senate floor \"very soon\" to prevent President Trump from launching an attack without congressional authorization, suggesting that diplomatic efforts may be time-sensitive [2]. Meanwhile, experts like Sanam Vakil of Chatham House assess that Trump is attempting to \"prepare the American public for an imminent military confrontation\" while simultaneously using the military buildup to pressure Tehran toward a nuclear deal [5][11].\n\n**Clarification on \"Ceasefire\" Terminology**\n\nIt is important to note that the search results do not indicate a formal ceasefire agreement between the U.S. and Iran, as the two nations are not currently in a declared state of war that would require such a mechanism. Rather, the discussions center on nuclear negotiations and de-escalation of tensions to prevent military conflict. The \"temporary agreement\" referenced in reports [13] appears to relate to nuclear program limitations and sanctions relief rather than a cessation of hostilities.\n\n**Limitations in Available Information**\n\nThe available reporting shows some contradictions\u2014between Iranian officials hinting at March talks [13] and their Foreign Ministry denying existing agreements [12]\u2014suggesting that backchannel communications may be intentionally obscured or that different factions within Iran are sending mixed signals. Additionally, while student protests in Iran are coinciding with these diplomatic moments [1], it remains unclear whether domestic pressure is influencing Iran's willingness to negotiate or hardening its stance.\n</Asknews_articles>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aol.com/articles/us-assets-middle-east-positioned-033232790.html\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/20/nx-s1-5720662/trump-warns-bad-things-iran-doesnt-make-deal-second-us-carrier-nears\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2026/02/19/us-military-assets-flock-to-middle-east-amid-iran-standoff/\">\nError summarizing article: 'SearchPipeline' object has no attribute '_current_summarization_cost'\n</Summary>\n"
