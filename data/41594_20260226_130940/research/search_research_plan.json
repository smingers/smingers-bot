  "plan_analysis": "The background excerpts cover the long-standing hostility, the 2025 Israel-Iran war, the December-2025 protests, and some public threats from President Trump.  Forecasters still need (a) a quantitative base rate for U.S. kinetic strikes on Iran or on any country in comparable windows; (b) clarity on how past strikes were reported/resolved (so they know what \u201ccredible sources\u201d will look like); (c) the main proximate drivers\u2014U.S. force deployments, decision-making signals from the White House/Pentagon/Congress, Iranian actions that might trigger a strike, and Israeli lobbying; (d) the very latest situational facts (troop movements, diplomatic talks, protest dynamics, Iranian nuclear progress); and (e) contrarian evidence such as de-escalation moves, U.S. domestic constraints, or ongoing negotiations.  \nThe search strategy therefore mixes historical/base-rate queries (\u224860 %) with current-state queries (\u224840 %), and includes at least one query specifically focused on the resolution mechanism (how previous strikes were confirmed by sources).",
  "reflect_analysis": "1. Base rate: GAP \u2013 attempted searches but no usable historical frequency data on U.S. kinetic strikes against Iran or comparable actions.\n2. Resolution mechanism: COVERED \u2013 definition of what counts as an \u201cattack\u201d is clear and uncontested.\n3. Key drivers: GAP \u2013 only scattered current-event snippets; missing structured information on U.S. force posture, decision-makers\u2019 incentives, and regional trigger dynamics.\n4. Current state: COVERED \u2013 several items from the past week on carriers, diplomacy, protests.\n5. Contrarian: COVERED \u2013 reporting on hawkish voices and scenarios that could lead to a strike supplies the less-obvious outcome narrative.",
