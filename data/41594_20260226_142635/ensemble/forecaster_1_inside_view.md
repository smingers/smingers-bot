Analysis:
The forecasting question asks whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026. The resolution criteria specify that a military attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel, excluding cyberattacks or ambiguous actions. The timeframe for this prediction is approximately 34 days from today's date (February 26, 2026) until April 1, 2026.

(a) **Source Analysis:**
1. **CNN (February 19, 2026)**: Discusses U.S. military buildup and Iran's preparations for conflict. Reliable and factual, indicating heightened tensions.
2. **PBS News (February 20, 2026)**: Covers U.S. military deployments and Trump’s potential military options. Solid source with expert opinions, highlighting the significant military presence.
3. **Al Jazeera (February 23, 2026)**: Focuses on diplomatic talks and Iran's readiness for self-defense. Offers a balanced view of ongoing negotiations and military threats.
4. **The Guardian (January 11, 2026)**: Reports on protests in Iran and U.S. military options. Reliable but may carry a critical stance on U.S. actions.
5. **Time (June 22, 2025)**: Highlights Trump's views on Iran's nuclear capabilities. Provides historical context but is less relevant to current events.
6. **Agent Reports**: Detailed analysis of U.S. military strategy and Iranian internal dynamics. Comprehensive and insightful, synthesizing various sources.

(b) **Evidence Analysis:**
- **Strong Evidence**: The military buildup and Trump's threats are corroborated by multiple sources (CNN, PBS News, Al Jazeera), showing a clear trend toward potential military action.
- **Moderate Evidence**: Ongoing protests and the Iranian regime's violent response (The Guardian, Agent Reports) suggest internal instability that may influence U.S. decisions.
- **Weak Evidence**: Public opinion polls indicating opposition to military action (Marist Poll, Globalaffairs) provide context but may not directly impact imminent military decisions.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**: The timeframe is 34 days. If this were halved, the urgency for military action might increase, potentially raising the probability of an attack. Conversely, if doubled, the likelihood of diplomatic resolutions might increase, lowering the probability.

(d) **Justification**: The current situation reflects a complex interplay of military readiness, internal unrest in Iran, and ongoing diplomatic negotiations. The significant military buildup suggests that the U.S. is prepared for action, but public opposition and the risks of escalation highlight caution. The historical context of U.S.-Iran relations indicates a pattern of military responses to perceived threats, but the unique dynamics of current protests and international sentiment may mitigate immediate military action.

Probability calibration:
Based on the outside view prediction of 52% and considering the strong military readiness and ongoing tensions, I will adjust my inside view prediction slightly upwards to 55%. This adjustment accounts for the substantial military buildup and the potential for rapid escalation, tempered by public sentiment and diplomatic efforts.

Checklist:
1. The U.S. will attack Iran before April 2026 if military action occurs against its territory or personnel.
2. The outside view base rate was previously established at 52%.
3. "55 out of 100 times, the U.S. attacks Iran before April 2026 happens." This aligns with evidence of military readiness and tensions.
4. Significant evidence includes:
   - U.S. military buildup indicating readiness for action.
   - Trump's threats regarding potential military strikes.
   - Ongoing protests in Iran leading to regime vulnerability.
5. A scenario that could make my forecast look silly is a sudden, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough leading to a peaceful resolution, which might shift the probability down significantly.
6. The status quo outcome suggests that if tensions remain unchanged, the likelihood of military action is moderate, but the potential for diplomatic resolution exists.

Probability: 55%
