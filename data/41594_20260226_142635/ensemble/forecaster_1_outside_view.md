**Analysis:**

(a) **Source Analysis:**
1. **Wikipedia Articles (Iranian Revolution, U.S.-Iran Relations, Soleimani Assassination, JCPOA)**: These articles provide a comprehensive historical context of U.S.-Iran relations, detailing key events and shifts in policy. They are factual, well-cited, and cover various aspects of the relationship, from the 1953 coup to recent developments. However, as user-generated content, they should be interpreted with caution regarding bias.
   
2. **AJC Article**: This article outlines Iran's history of violence against U.S. interests and military personnel, providing factual accounts of incidents since 1979. It is credible and presents a clear historical timeline, although it may carry an implicit bias against Iran.

3. **Al Jazeera Article**: This piece discusses the escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, particularly following military actions against Iranian nuclear facilities. It is factual, though it may reflect a particular editorial stance typical of its coverage.

4. **History.com Article**: This article was not relevant, as it did not provide insights into U.S.-Iran relations or military actions.

5. **Responsible Statecraft Article**: This source discusses the increase in U.S. military presence in the Middle East and its implications. It is credible and provides insights into the military's strategic thinking, though it may lean towards a critical perspective on U.S. foreign policy.

6. **Middle East Eye Article**: This article provides a historical context for U.S. military interventions, highlighting trends in military action. It is factual and presents a critical view of U.S. interventions.

7. **Agent Reports**: These reports provide detailed analyses of U.S. responses to Iranian protests, historical contexts of military strikes, and factors leading to military de-escalation. They synthesize various sources and offer insights based on recent developments. However, they should be evaluated for potential biases based on the framing of the issues.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**
Possible reference classes include:
- Historical U.S. military interventions in the Middle East.
- Instances of U.S. military action prompted by domestic unrest in foreign nations.
- Previous U.S.-Iran conflicts and military strikes.
The most suitable reference class is historical U.S. military interventions in the Middle East, as it encompasses both the political context and the patterns of military engagement relevant to the current situation.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**
The prediction timeframe is from now (February 26, 2026) until April 1, 2026, which is approximately 34 days. Historically, significant military actions in the region have often occurred in response to escalating tensions over shorter periods, particularly during crises.

(d) **Justification:**
Given the historical context of U.S.-Iran relations, the current situation reflects heightened tensions due to internal unrest in Iran and the Iranian regime's violent crackdown on protests. The U.S. has a history of military interventions framed as humanitarian responses, but public sentiment in the U.S. currently leans against military action, with polls indicating substantial opposition. 

Moreover, the military's assessments show caution regarding potential escalation and retaliation from Iran, which could destabilize the region further. The recent military buildup in the region suggests a readiness for potential action, but this does not guarantee an attack will occur, especially considering the lack of public support and the risks involved.

The probability of a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026 is further complicated by the Iranian regime's internal challenges and the potential for diplomatic solutions emerging from ongoing unrest. Given these considerations, the historical patterns of U.S. military interventions suggest that while there is a significant risk of military action, it is not guaranteed, especially in light of the current public and military sentiment against such actions.

**Outside View Calibration:**
Considering the insights from the sources and the historical context:
- The Sentinel forecast of a 59% chance of U.S. strikes by March 31, 2026, serves as a useful tether.
- Given the historical rate of unexpected outcomes in similar contexts, I would adjust this figure slightly downward to account for public opposition and military caution.

Overall, I would estimate a probability of approximately 52% for a U.S. attack on Iran before April 2026, reflecting a balance between the potential for military action and the significant factors working against it.
