Analysis:
1. **Paraphrase the title and resolution criteria**: Will the U.S. conduct a military attack on Iran before April 1, 2026, affecting its territory or military personnel?
  
2. **State your outside view base rate previously established**: My outside view base rate prediction was a 45% chance of a U.S. attack on Iran before April 1, 2026.

3. **Consistency check**: "45 out of 100 times, the U.S. attacks Iran before April 1, 2026." This aligns with my justification based on current military readiness and historical context.

4. **Significant pieces of evidence influencing final prediction**:
   - The U.S. military buildup in the Middle East is unprecedented, with two aircraft carrier strike groups deployed (PBS News, 2026).
   - President Trump has indicated military action is a possibility if negotiations fail (Al Jazeera, 2026).
   - Iran's violent crackdown on protests has drawn U.S. threats of intervention (The Guardian, 2026).
   - Public sentiment shows significant opposition to military action, which may restrain U.S. decisions (Marist Poll, 2026).
   - Ongoing diplomatic negotiations are progressing, but key issues remain unresolved (Al Jazeera, 2026).

5. **Blind-spot statement**: A sudden, significant diplomatic breakthrough leading to a peaceful resolution with Iran could drastically reduce the likelihood of a U.S. military attack, potentially shifting the probability to below 20%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: If the current situation continues without significant escalation or resolution, the likelihood of an attack remains moderate, but public opposition and the risks of retaliation from Iran could deter military action.

Probability calibration:
Considering the evidence, the significant military readiness and ongoing tensions suggest a higher likelihood of conflict than my initial estimate. However, the strong public opposition and the potential for diplomatic solutions warrant a cautious adjustment. Therefore, I revise my inside view prediction to a **55% chance** that the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026.
