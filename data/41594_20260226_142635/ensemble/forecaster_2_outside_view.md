Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis**:
1. **Wikipedia Articles on Iran-U.S. Relations**: These articles provide a comprehensive historical overview of U.S.-Iran relations, detailing significant events and shifts in policy. While Wikipedia is a collaborative platform and should be approached with some skepticism, the articles are generally well-cited and reflect a consensus view on historical events. The information is factual, though it lacks expert opinion. The historical context is crucial for understanding the current situation.

2. **AJC Article on Iran's Campaign Against the U.S.**: This source outlines Iran's history of violence against U.S. interests and provides context for the current tensions. It is a credible source, as it discusses historical facts and recent developments, but it may have a slight bias due to its advocacy focus. The article is dated and relevant to understanding Iran's motivations.

3. **Al Jazeera Article on U.S. Strikes**: This article discusses the escalation of military actions by the U.S. against Iran in the context of recent conflicts. It is a reputable news source known for its international coverage, and it presents a factual account of events. The article's analysis of the geopolitical implications is valuable for understanding the potential for U.S. military action.

4. **Military and Historical Context Reports**: The agent reports provide insights into the potential for U.S. military action in response to protests in Iran and the historical context of U.S. military interventions. These reports are based on expert analysis and current events, making them highly relevant. They synthesize various opinions and data, providing a nuanced view of the situation.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis**: 
- **Historical Military Interventions**: This reference class includes U.S. military actions in response to protests or regime changes in other countries (e.g., Libya, Syria). The outcomes of these interventions have varied significantly, with many leading to prolonged conflict rather than stabilization.
- **U.S.-Iran Relations**: The historical context of U.S.-Iran relations, particularly since the 1979 revolution, is another relevant reference class. The pattern of hostility and military threats has been consistent, but actual military actions have often been limited.
- **Recent U.S. Military Engagements**: Evaluating recent military actions in the Middle East, particularly in response to Iranian provocations, can provide insights into the likelihood of further military engagement.

Of these, the **U.S.-Iran Relations** reference class is the most suitable, as it captures the historical animosity and recent escalations in military tensions.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**: The prediction timeframe is approximately 13 months from now (February 2026 to April 2026). Historically, U.S. military interventions have often occurred in response to immediate crises or escalations, but the decision to engage in military action typically involves longer deliberations and assessments. Previous interventions have shown that significant military actions often follow patterns of escalating tensions over several months.

(d) **Justification**: The analysis of sources indicates a complex interplay of historical context, current geopolitical dynamics, and domestic factors influencing U.S. military decisions regarding Iran. The U.S. has a history of military intervention, but public sentiment and military assessments currently lean against engaging in another conflict, especially given the opposition to military action among the American public. The presence of significant unrest in Iran, coupled with the regime's violent response to protests, raises the stakes for potential U.S. intervention. However, the historical pattern suggests that while military action is possible, it is not guaranteed, especially considering the risks of escalation and the lack of public support.

Outside view calibration:
The aggregate estimate from forecasters indicating a 59% chance of U.S. strikes on Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, serves as a useful tether for calibration. However, considering historical precedents of U.S. military action, the high public opposition to military intervention, and the complexities involved, I would adjust this figure downward. The historical rate of unexpected outcomes and the potential for de-escalation strategies suggest a lower probability than initially forecasted.

Taking all these factors into account, I would predict a 40% chance of the U.S. attacking Iran before April 2026. This figure reflects both the possibility of military action and the significant constraints that currently exist.
