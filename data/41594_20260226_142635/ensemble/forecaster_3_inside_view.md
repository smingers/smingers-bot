Analysis:
The forecasting question is whether the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026, with the resolution criteria being a military attack that physically affects Iran's territory or military personnel. 

(a) **Source Analysis**:
1. **CNN (February 19, 2026)**: Discusses U.S. military buildup and readiness for potential conflict with Iran. Reliable and timely, it reflects current military strategies and tensions.
2. **PBS News (February 20, 2026)**: Reports on significant U.S. military assets in the region and the potential for military action. Credible and informative, it emphasizes the scale of military readiness.
3. **Al Jazeera (February 23, 2026)**: Covers Iran's defensive posture and readiness against U.S. aggression. The source is reputable and provides insights into Iran's strategic responses.
4. **The Guardian (January 11, 2026)**: Details the violent crackdown on protests in Iran and the potential U.S. response. It is a respected news outlet, offering context on U.S.-Iran dynamics.
5. **Time (June 22, 2025)**: Discusses Trump's views on Iran's nuclear ambitions and military options. While slightly dated, it remains relevant for understanding U.S. policy towards Iran.

(b) **Evidence Analysis**:
- **Strong Evidence**: Multiple sources confirm a significant U.S. military buildup and readiness, indicating a high likelihood of potential strikes if diplomatic efforts fail.
- **Moderate Evidence**: Reports of Iran's internal unrest and violent government response suggest that U.S. intervention may be considered, but the degree of military action remains uncertain.
- **Weak Evidence**: Public sentiment against military action in the U.S. is notable but does not directly influence immediate military decisions.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**: The prediction timeframe is approximately 13 months from now. If this were halved, the urgency for military action might increase, potentially raising the probability of an attack. Conversely, if doubled, the likelihood might decrease as diplomatic avenues could emerge.

(d) **Justification**: Compelling factors include the substantial military buildup by the U.S., Trump's aggressive rhetoric, and Iran's internal instability. While historical patterns suggest that military action is possible, the lack of public support and the potential for diplomatic negotiations complicate the situation. The combination of military readiness and ongoing protests in Iran creates a volatile environment that could lead to conflict, but the risks of escalation and a lack of clear public backing suggest a lower probability than previously considered.

Probability calibration:
Taking into account the outside view base rate of 40% and adjusting for current dynamics, I would predict a 35% chance of the U.S. attacking Iran before April 2026, reflecting the heightened tensions but also the significant constraints.

Checklist:
1. The U.S. will attack Iran before April 1, 2026, if military action occurs against its territory or personnel.
2. My outside view base rate is 40%.
3. "35 out of 100 times, the U.S. attacks Iran before April 1, 2026, happens." This aligns with my justification.
4. Significant evidence: 
   - U.S. military buildup indicates readiness for conflict.
   - Iran's internal unrest could provoke U.S. action.
   - Diplomatic negotiations remain unresolved, increasing risk.
5. A scenario making my forecast look silly could be an unexpected alliance or agreement between the U.S. and Iran that leads to de-escalation, potentially lowering the probability below my forecast.
6. The status quo outcome suggests that without further escalation or significant changes, the likelihood of military action may remain stable or decrease as diplomatic efforts continue.

Probability: 35%
