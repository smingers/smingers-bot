**Analysis:**

(a) **Source Analysis:**
1. **Wikipedia Articles on Iran-U.S. Relations**: These articles provide a historical overview of U.S.-Iran relations, detailing significant events and shifts in policy. The information is factual, covering historical context and major incidents, but may lack depth in analysis. The dates of the articles are not specified, but they are likely updated periodically to reflect current events.
   
2. **Assassination of Qasem Soleimani**: This article details the context and consequences of Soleimani's assassination, providing factual information about U.S.-Iran tensions. It is a reliable source for understanding the escalation of hostilities, given its focus on a pivotal event in recent history. The date is not specified, but the information is relevant up to October 2023.

3. **U.S. Foreign Policy in the Middle East**: This article outlines the evolution of U.S. foreign policy in the region, highlighting strategic interests and military presence. It provides factual insights into U.S. actions and their motivations. The date is not specified, but the content is relevant for understanding the broader context of U.S. military interventions.

4. **Agent Reports**: These reports provide detailed analyses of the current situation regarding U.S.-Iran relations, including military buildup, public opinion, and historical patterns. The reports are based on recent developments and expert opinions, making them valuable for understanding the current landscape. The dates of the reports range from early to late February 2026, ensuring their relevance to the question.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis**:
Possible reference classes include:
- Historical U.S. military interventions in response to protests or internal unrest in foreign nations.
- Instances of U.S. military action against hostile regimes in the Middle East over the last 20 years.
- Patterns of U.S.-Iran relations since the 1979 revolution, particularly during periods of heightened tensions.

The most suitable reference class appears to be the historical U.S. military interventions in response to internal unrest, as this aligns closely with the current situation in Iran involving protests against the government.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**:
The prediction timeframe is approximately 13 months from now (from February 2026 to April 2026). Historically, similar situations have seen military actions occurring in response to escalations within six months to a year, particularly when a regime faces significant internal dissent. However, the U.S. has often refrained from intervening militarily when public sentiment is against such actions, as seen in previous conflicts.

(d) **Justification**:
The analysis indicates that the U.S. has a history of military intervention in the Middle East, particularly in response to internal unrest. However, the current context is complicated by significant public opposition to military action in the U.S., as indicated by recent polling data. The military's cautious approach, combined with geopolitical considerations and the potential for destabilization, suggests a reluctance to engage in direct military conflict.

The Iranian regime is currently facing severe internal dissent, which could make it vulnerable. However, military action could also provoke significant retaliation and further destabilization in the region. The historical precedents indicate that while military action may be considered, the U.S. has often opted for diplomatic solutions when faced with similar circumstances, especially in light of potential public backlash.

**Outside View Calibration**:
Based on the above analysis:
- The sources indicate a 59% chance of U.S. military action by March 31, 2026, which serves as a useful baseline.
- Considering the historical context and public sentiment, I would adjust this figure downwards to account for the current political climate and the complexities involved in military engagement.
- The historical rate of unexpected outcomes in military interventions suggests that while there is a significant probability of action, there is also a notable chance of non-action, particularly given the current domestic and international dynamics.

Taking all these factors into account, I would calibrate my prediction to reflect a more cautious stance.

**Outside View Prediction**:
My outside view prediction is that there is a **42%** probability that the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026.
