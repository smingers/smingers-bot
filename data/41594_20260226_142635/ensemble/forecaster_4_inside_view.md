   - **Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis of U.S. military strategy and public opinion on Iran. It includes recent developments and expert opinions, ensuring relevance and accuracy, dated February 2026.

2. **Evidence Analysis**:
   - **Strong Evidence**: The military buildup and readiness of the U.S. (multiple sources confirm significant deployments) indicate a high potential for military action.
   - **Moderate Evidence**: Ongoing protests in Iran and the regime's violent crackdown suggest internal instability, which could provoke U.S. action, but they also indicate a potential deterrent against escalation.
   - **Weak Evidence**: Public opinion against military action in the U.S. is divided, which could influence decision-making but lacks the immediacy of military readiness.

3. **Timeframe Analysis**: 
   The prediction timeframe is approximately 13 months (from February 2026 to April 2026). If this were halved, the urgency for military action would increase, likely raising my prediction. If doubled, the situation might stabilize, potentially lowering the likelihood of action.

4. **Justification**:
   The strong evidence of military readiness combined with moderate evidence of internal dissent in Iran suggests a higher likelihood of U.S. military action. However, public sentiment against military intervention and the potential for diplomatic resolution complicate the situation. The historical context indicates a tendency for the U.S. to avoid military action unless absolutely necessary, especially when public opinion is against it.

Probability calibration:
Taking into account the strong military readiness, the moderate instability in Iran, and the divided public sentiment regarding military action, I adjust my outside view base rate of 42% up to **55%**. This reflects a cautious optimism about the likelihood of U.S. action while acknowledging the complexities involved.

Checklist:
1. Will the U.S. attack Iran before April 2026? This resolves as Yes if military action occurs against Iranian territory or personnel.
2. Outside view base rate: 42%.
3. "55 out of 100 times, the U.S. attacks Iran before April 2026." This makes sense given the current military readiness and diplomatic efforts.
4. Significant evidence: 
   - U.S. military buildup suggests readiness for action.
   - Ongoing protests in Iran could provoke U.S. intervention.
   - Public opinion is divided, complicating the likelihood of military action.
5. Blind-spot statement: If Iran's internal dissent leads to regime change before April 2026, it could significantly reduce the likelihood of U.S. action.
6. Status quo outcome: If current tensions and military readiness remain unchanged, the likelihood of U.S. action is high, supporting my prediction.

Probability: 55%
