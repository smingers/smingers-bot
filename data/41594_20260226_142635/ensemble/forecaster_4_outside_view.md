Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. **Wikipedia Articles**: These provide a historical overview of U.S.-Iran relations, the Iranian Revolution, and relevant U.S. foreign policy. While generally reliable for factual information, they may lack depth in analysis and are not primary sources. They are suitable for establishing a historical context but should be supplemented with more current analyses.
   
2. **Agent Reports**: These reports offer detailed assessments of the current situation in Iran, U.S. military posture, and public sentiment. They are derived from a combination of historical context and real-time events, making them valuable for understanding the nuances of the current geopolitical landscape. They reflect expert opinions and analyses, which are critical for forecasting.

3. **News Articles (AJC, Al Jazeera, History.com)**: These provide timely updates and analyses of events, such as U.S. military actions and Iranian protests. They include expert commentary and public opinion data, which are useful for understanding the evolving situation. However, they may contain biases depending on the publication's editorial stance.

(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Possible reference classes include:
- Historical U.S. military interventions in response to internal unrest in foreign nations (e.g., Iraq, Libya).
- U.S. responses to Iranian provocations or crises (e.g., the assassination of Soleimani, attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities).
- Public sentiment trends during military engagements in the Middle East.
The most suitable reference class for this question is the historical U.S. military interventions in response to internal unrest, as it offers insights into the decision-making process and outcomes of similar situations.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
The prediction timeframe is approximately 13 months, from February 2026 to April 2026. Historically, U.S. military interventions have often been precipitated by urgent crises, such as significant protests or government crackdowns. The timeline suggests that if tensions escalate, military action could occur relatively quickly, especially under a leadership that favors aggressive foreign policy.

(d) Justification:
The historical context indicates a long-standing adversarial relationship between the U.S. and Iran, characterized by military threats and interventions. The current situation, marked by severe internal unrest in Iran and a violent government crackdown, mirrors past scenarios where the U.S. has intervened militarily. However, public sentiment in the U.S. is largely against military intervention, which could deter action. The U.S. military's readiness to act, coupled with President Trump's rhetoric, suggests a heightened risk of conflict, but the lack of public support and the potential for significant regional backlash complicate the calculus. The probability of an attack is further influenced by the internal dynamics of the Iranian regime, which, while under pressure, may also use external threats to consolidate power.

Outside view calibration:
Considering the sources and analyses, a rough figure from the Sentinel report suggested a 59% chance of U.S. strikes on Iran by March 31, 2026. This figure reflects expert consensus but may be overly optimistic given public opposition and historical caution against military engagement. The historical rate of unexpected outcomes in similar scenarios suggests that while the likelihood of military action is significant, it is not guaranteed. Therefore, I would calibrate the outside view prediction downward, accounting for the complexities and uncertainties involved.

Outside View Prediction:
Based on the analysis, I predict a 45% chance that the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026.
