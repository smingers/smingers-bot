Analysis:
The question at hand is whether the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026. The resolution criteria specify that an attack must physically affect Iranian territory or military personnel, as verified by credible sources.

(a) **Source analysis**: 
1. **CNN (February 19, 2026)** - Discusses U.S. military readiness and Iran's preparations for conflict. Reliable and timely, it highlights military buildups and tensions. 
2. **PBS News (February 20, 2026)** - Details U.S. military asset deployment in the Middle East and Trump's threats of military action. Credible source providing specifics about military strategy.
3. **Al Jazeera (February 23, 2026)** - Covers ongoing diplomatic talks and Iranian readiness to defend against U.S. aggression. Reliable, highlighting the dual approach of diplomacy and military readiness.
4. **The Guardian (January 11, 2026)** - Discusses the U.S. consideration of military action in response to Iranian protests. Provides context on public sentiment and U.S. military options.
5. **Agent Reports (February 2026)** - Synthesizes current events and expert opinions on U.S. responses to Iranian protests, timely and relevant.
6. **CFR (February 2026)** - Analyzes the U.S. military strategy and its implications for Iran. A credible source with expert insights on military readiness and potential outcomes.

(b) **Evidence analysis**:
- **Strong evidence**: The U.S. military buildup (CNN, PBS News) and Trump's explicit threats indicate a high likelihood of military action if negotiations fail. Multiple sources confirm the military readiness and potential for conflict.
- **Moderate evidence**: The ongoing protests in Iran and the government's violent crackdown (Al Jazeera, The Guardian) suggest that internal instability could provoke a U.S. response.
- **Weak evidence**: Public opinion trends against military action (Marist Poll, Globalaffairs) indicate caution but lack direct influence on immediate military decisions.

(c) **Timeframe analysis**: The prediction timeframe is approximately 34 days from February 26, 2026, to April 1, 2026. If this were halved, the urgency for military action might increase, potentially raising the likelihood of an attack. If doubled, the situation may stabilize, leading to decreased military action probability.

(d) **Justification**: The significant military buildup by the U.S. and Trump's threats strongly suggest a high probability of military action. However, the public sentiment against military intervention and the potential for diplomatic resolutions may mitigate this likelihood. The historical context of U.S.-Iran relations indicates a pattern of military threats without direct action, leading to a more cautious approach.

Probability calibration:
Considering the evidence and the current geopolitical landscape, I adjust my outside view prediction from 43% to 55%. The military readiness and current tensions suggest a higher probability of military action than initially estimated, but the public sentiment and potential diplomatic efforts provide a counterbalance.

Checklist:
1. The U.S. will attack Iran before April 1, 2026, based on credible sources.
2. My outside view base rate was 43%.
3. "55 out of 100 times, the U.S. attacks Iran before April 1, 2026." This aligns with the justification provided.
4. Significant evidence: 
   - U.S. military buildup and readiness (CNN, PBS).
   - Trump's threats of military action (PBS News).
   - Ongoing protests and Iranian government crackdown (Al Jazeera).
5. Blind-spot statement: A sudden diplomatic breakthrough could significantly reduce the likelihood of an attack, potentially lowering the probability to around 30%.
6. Status quo outcome: The current situation is volatile, with ongoing protests in Iran and military readiness from the U.S., suggesting that a slight nudge towards maintaining the status quo may not be advantageous.

Probability: 55%
