Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis**:
1. **Wikipedia Articles**: These articles provide a comprehensive historical context of U.S.-Iran relations, detailing significant events and policy shifts. They are factual and well-cited but may lack the depth of expert analysis. They are current as of October 2023.
2. **AJC Article**: This source outlines Iran's historical campaign against the U.S. and recent military activities. It is credible but may reflect a particular viewpoint regarding U.S. interests. Its date is unspecified but likely aligns with ongoing developments.
3. **Al Jazeera Article**: This piece discusses U.S. military actions in response to Iranian threats and protests. It provides a nuanced view of U.S. motivations but may contain bias against U.S. military interventions. The date is also unspecified, but it covers events leading up to early 2026.
4. **History.com Article**: This source lacks relevant information for the forecasting question, focusing instead on the company's mission. Therefore, it is not useful for analysis.
5. **Responsible Statecraft Article**: This report discusses the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East and its implications for Iran. It is credible and provides insights into military strategies and public sentiment, dated February 2026.
6. **Middle East Eye Article**: This source discusses U.S. military interventions historically and provides statistical insights. It is credible but may reflect a critical stance on U.S. foreign policy, dated early 2026.
7. **Agent Reports**: These reports synthesize current events and expert opinions, providing a detailed analysis of U.S. responses to Iranian protests and historical contexts. They are timely and relevant, dated February 2026.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis**:
1. **Historical Military Interventions**: Analyzing past U.S. military interventions in response to internal unrest in foreign countries could provide insight into the likelihood of a similar response in Iran. This reference class includes cases like Libya and Syria, where U.S. military actions were influenced by internal protests.
2. **U.S.-Iran Relations**: A reference class focusing on U.S.-Iran relations since 1979, particularly during periods of heightened tension, could help assess the likelihood of military engagement. This class includes instances of military threats and actual strikes.
3. **Public Opinion Trends**: Analyzing public sentiment regarding military interventions in the Middle East could offer insights into the political landscape influencing potential military actions.

The most suitable reference class is **U.S.-Iran Relations**, as it directly relates to the current geopolitical context and historical precedents of U.S. military actions against Iran.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**:
The prediction timeframe is from February 26, 2026, to April 1, 2026, which is approximately 34 days. Historically, significant military actions often occur in response to immediate crises or escalations, suggesting that if an attack were to happen, it would likely occur in this short window, especially given the current tensions.

(d) **Justification**:
The historical context of U.S.-Iran relations indicates a pattern of hostility and military threats, particularly in response to internal unrest in Iran. The recent protests have been met with a violent crackdown, prompting U.S. military threats and a buildup of forces in the region. However, public sentiment in the U.S. largely opposes military intervention, which may deter the administration from acting impulsively. 

While there is a credible assessment from Sentinel forecasting a 59% chance of U.S. strikes against Iran by March 31, 2026, this figure may be influenced by expert biases or the current political climate. The historical rate of unexpected outcomes in military interventions suggests that while tensions are high, the actual occurrence of military action could be lower than anticipated due to public opposition and potential geopolitical repercussions.

Outside view calibration:
Considering the factors analyzed and the reference class of U.S.-Iran relations, I would calibrate my outside view prediction to reflect a moderate likelihood of military action. The 59% figure from Sentinel provides a useful anchor, but I must account for the historical context of U.S. reluctance to engage in prolonged conflicts and the current public sentiment against military action. Given these considerations, I will adjust the estimate downward.

Outside View Prediction:
I predict a 43% probability that the United States will attack Iran before April 1, 2026.
