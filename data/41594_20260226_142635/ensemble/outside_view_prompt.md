The forecasting question is:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Question background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Additional fine-print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

Historical context:

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">
The article provides a historical overview of the Iranian Revolution, which culminated in the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979 and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Key points include:

1. **Background**: The revolution was influenced by a series of events, including the 1953 CIA- and MI6-backed coup that reinstated Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch, leading to increased U.S. influence in Iran. The Shah's modernization efforts, known as the White Revolution, alienated various societal sectors, particularly the clergy.

2. **Revolutionary Events**: Anti-government demonstrations began in 1977, escalating into a broad-based uprising by late 1978. A significant turning point was the Cinema Rex fire, which fueled public outrage against the Shah's regime. By early 1979, Khomeini returned to Iran, and the monarchy was dismantled by February 11, 1979.

3. **Post-Revolution**: The revolution replaced a pro-Western secular monarchy with an anti-Western Islamic republic, led by Khomeini. The new government aimed to undermine Sunni influence in the region and support Shia political ascendancy.

4. **Perceptions of the Shah's Regime**: The Shah was viewed as corrupt and overly reliant on foreign powers, particularly the U.S., which contributed to widespread discontent. The revolution was characterized by a mix of nationalist goals, political populism, and religious radicalism.

5. **Significance**: The Iranian Revolution marked a profound change in Iran's political landscape, leading to the establishment of a regime that opposed Western influence and sought to export its revolutionary ideals across the region.

Overall, the article outlines the complex interplay of historical, political, and social factors that led to the Iranian Revolution and its lasting impact on Iran and its relations with the West.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations">
The article discusses the turbulent history of Iran–United States relations, which began in the mid-to-late 19th century and have been characterized by significant events and shifts in policy. Initially, the U.S. was viewed as a trustworthy ally by Iran, especially during the Qajar dynasty. However, relations soured dramatically after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which resulted in the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

Since April 7, 1980, the two nations have had no formal diplomatic relations, relying instead on third-party countries for communication. The U.S. has imposed a trade embargo on Iran since 1995, and relations further deteriorated after the U.S. withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, reinstating sanctions and initiating a "maximum pressure campaign" against Iran.

The article highlights the Iranian government's narrative of animosity towards the U.S., attributing it to U.S. support for Israel and perceived imperialistic ambitions. Conversely, the U.S. cites Iran's human rights abuses, its nuclear ambitions, and its support for terrorist organizations as reasons for the strained relations.

Public opinion in both countries reflects a deep-seated animosity, with a 2013 BBC poll indicating that only 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively, while a 2019 survey showed that 13% of Iranians have a favorable view of the U.S. The article also notes that relations have improved during periods of shared interests, such as during the Iraq War and the fight against ISIS.

Overall, the article outlines a complex and often adversarial relationship shaped by historical events, ideological differences, and geopolitical interests.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration">
The article discusses the Iran–United States relations during the first Trump administration (2017–2021), highlighting a significant shift from the previous administration's engagement approach to a more confrontational stance. Key points include:

1. **Policy Changes**: Trump implemented a travel ban affecting Iranian citizens and withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), initiating a maximum pressure campaign that included over 1,500 sanctions targeting Iran's economy, particularly its financial, oil, and shipping sectors.

2. **Iran's Response**: In reaction to U.S. actions, Iran threatened to resume unrestricted uranium enrichment and rejected negotiations with the Trump administration. Tensions escalated with incidents such as the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran and attacks on oil tankers.

3. **Major Escalations**: The assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 by a U.S. drone strike led to Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq, heightening fears of war. The crisis continued with retaliatory strikes and accusations of Iranian interference in U.S. affairs.

4. **Diplomatic Isolation**: The U.S. faced strong resistance to its policies, even from allies, leading to diplomatic isolation. The maximum pressure campaign aimed to force Iran to renegotiate the nuclear agreement but resulted in increased hostility and unresolved disputes.

5. **Military and Economic Impact**: The sanctions severely damaged Iran's economy, leading to a sharp decline in oil exports and significant inflation. Iranian leaders, including President Rouhani, warned that any attempt to prevent Iran's oil exports would lead to broader regional conflict.

Overall, the article outlines a period marked by escalating tensions and a lack of diplomatic resolution, with both sides engaging in aggressive rhetoric and actions.
</QuestionSource>

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement finalized on July 14, 2015, between Iran and the P5+1 countries (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) along with the European Union. The JCPOA aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Key points of the JCPOA include:
- Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear activities, including limiting the number and type of centrifuges, the level of uranium enrichment, and the size of its enriched uranium stockpile.
- Key facilities such as Fordow, Natanz, and Arak were repurposed for civilian uses, and Iran accepted more intrusive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
- In return for compliance, Iran received relief from nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the UN, EU, and the U.S., although many U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue remained in place.

The agreement took effect on January 20, 2016, but faced criticism from various parties, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, leading to the re-imposition of sanctions that effectively nullified the economic benefits of the deal for Iran. Following the June 2025 Iran-Israel war, Iran officially announced the termination of the JCPOA on October 18, 2025.

The JCPOA was a culmination of extensive negotiations that began with an interim agreement in 2013, leading to a framework agreement in April 2015 and the final deal in July 2015. The agreement was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while allowing for peaceful nuclear energy development under strict regulations.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani">
The article discusses the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a high-ranking Iranian general, by a U.S. drone strike on January 3, 2020. Soleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful figure in Iran after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The strike occurred near Baghdad International Airport while Soleimani was en route to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.

Key points include:

1. **Context of the Assassination**: The strike was part of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, particularly following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions. The assassination was justified by U.S. officials as a necessary action to prevent an "imminent attack" and to protect U.S. personnel.

2. **Consequences**: The assassination led to heightened tensions, with Iranian leaders vowing revenge. In retaliation, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq shortly after the strike. The incident marked a significant escalation in U.S.-Iran relations.

3. **International Reactions**: The assassination was met with widespread concern from the international community, with calls for restraint and diplomacy. Critics, including the United Nations special rapporteur, argued that the strike likely violated international law.

4. **Political Implications**: The article notes that the assassination reflects a broader trend of eroding norms against targeted killings of foreign leaders. It also highlights the complex political landscape in the Middle East, where such actions can have far-reaching consequences.

5. **Historical Context**: The article provides background on U.S. and Iranian activities in Iraq since 2014, including the U.S. intervention against ISIS and the role of Iranian-backed militias.

Overall, the assassination of Soleimani is portrayed as a pivotal moment in U.S.-Iran relations, with significant implications for regional stability and international law.

<Summary source="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/us-military-in-the-middle-east/">
The article from Responsible Statecraft discusses the significant increase in the U.S. military presence in the Middle East since October 2023, reversing the drawdown that followed the Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021. U.S. troop numbers have risen from approximately 34,000 to nearly 50,000, the highest level since the first Trump term. This military buildup is characterized as a response to perceived Iranian threats and instability in the region, rather than a result of long-term strategic planning.

Key developments include the deployment of three aircraft carrier strike groups near Yemen as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, aimed at countering Houthi attacks on shipping lanes. These carriers enhance U.S. operational capabilities, with the USS Carl Vinson alone carrying 90 aircraft and 6,000 crew members. Additionally, six B-2 stealth bombers have been deployed to Diego Garcia, a strategic base for long-range missions against Iran.

The article notes that U.S. forces are also stationed in Kuwait, Jordan, and Cyprus, with a focus on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. The Pentagon's recent Operation Rough Rider has expanded airstrikes against Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, resulting in high casualties and raising concerns about humanitarian impacts.

While the Biden administration has framed these deployments as defensive, the article suggests that the buildup reflects a lack of clear strategy, with military posture increasingly driving foreign policy. The risk of accidental escalation is highlighted, particularly given recent incidents involving Iranian and Houthi forces. The article concludes that the Trump administration may view this military presence as leverage in negotiations with Iran, but the sustainability of this posture is questioned due to financial and logistical burdens.
</Summary>

<Summary source="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/america-quarter-wars-middle-east-africa">
The article from Middle East Eye discusses a major study titled "Introducing the Military Intervention Project: A New Dataset on US Military Interventions, 1776–2019," which reveals that over a quarter of U.S. military interventions have targeted the Middle East and Africa. The study highlights that since the end of the Cold War, U.S. military actions have increased, particularly in the post-9/11 era, where military interventions have become more common and often justified under the banner of human rights.

Key findings include:
- The U.S. has conducted almost 400 military interventions from its founding to 2019, with a significant portion occurring after the Cold War.
- The study's authors, including Sidita Kushi and Monica Duffy Toft, noted that the quantity and quality of U.S. military interventions were unexpectedly high.
- The U.S. military budget exceeds $800 billion annually, accounting for nearly 40% of global military spending.
- The U.S. has more special forces deployed in countries than it has ambassadors, indicating a shift towards remote military operations rather than large-scale troop deployments.
- The authors warn that the U.S.'s hyper-interventionist stance has damaged its legitimacy and respect globally, and they predict a continuing upward trend in military interventions in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The article concludes that a significant change in U.S. foreign policy, which currently favors military solutions, is unlikely in the near term.

Query: analysis of U.S. responses to Iranian protests
The U.S. response to the Iranian protests that erupted in December 2025 has been characterized by a complex interplay of military threats, diplomatic overtures, and public statements from President Donald Trump. The protests, described as the largest since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, were driven by a severe economic crisis exacerbated by international sanctions, leading to widespread calls for systemic reform and the end of the Islamic Republic's rule. The Iranian government's brutal crackdown resulted in thousands of deaths and arrests, further intensifying the situation.

President Trump has publicly threatened military action against Iran if the regime continues to violently suppress protesters, stating, "If Iran violently kills peaceful protesters... the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go." This rhetoric has been coupled with a significant military buildup in the region, including the deployment of aircraft carriers and strike groups, raising concerns about an imminent U.S. attack. However, public opinion in the U.S. shows notable reluctance to support military intervention, with nearly half of Americans opposing military action against Iran.

The U.S. administration's approach has oscillated between threats of military action and attempts at diplomatic engagement. Trump's preference for resolving tensions through diplomacy while keeping military options on the table reflects a dual strategy that complicates the U.S. position. The Iranian regime has framed the protests as a result of foreign interference, particularly from the U.S. and Israel, and has vowed to respond firmly to any military aggression.

The situation is further complicated by ongoing negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. has leveraged the protests and the regime's violent response as a means to pressure Iran into concessions regarding its nuclear ambitions. However, experts suggest that military intervention is unlikely to lead to a favorable outcome for U.S. interests or the Iranian populace. Historical precedents indicate that foreign military intervention often fails to produce stable, democratic governance and can exacerbate existing tensions.

Recent analyses indicate that the U.S. military is poised for a significant operation if ordered, which would mark a departure from previous, more limited strikes. The convergence of Iran's missile arsenal, the regime's violent crackdown at home, and its unresolved nuclear program complicate the potential for limited military action. Military planners are likely to target missile production facilities, launchers, and associated air defenses as part of a broader campaign that could also include strikes against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Basij militia, which have been instrumental in the crackdown on protests.

The Iranian opposition, while fragmented, has become increasingly vocal in the context of the protests. Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah, has positioned himself as a potential leader of a secular Iranian state, although his support within Iran remains uncertain. The opposition is characterized by a lack of unity, with various groups and individuals holding differing aims and strategies. This fragmentation complicates the prospects for a cohesive response to the regime's repression and raises questions about the potential for a stable government in the event of regime change.

The impact of U.S. military action on Iran's internal politics is a critical consideration. Analysts suggest that while military strikes may weaken the regime's capacity to suppress protests in the short term, they could also reinforce the regime's narrative of foreign aggression, potentially galvanizing support for the government among segments of the population. The Iranian regime has historically used external threats to consolidate internal support, framing dissent as a foreign conspiracy. Thus, the effectiveness of U.S. military action in supporting the Iranian people's aspirations for democracy remains highly uncertain.

The potential consequences of U.S. military action extend beyond Iran's borders. Regional powers, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have expressed concerns about the destabilizing effects of a U.S. strike on Iran, fearing retaliation that could impact their own security. The geopolitical landscape in the Middle East is fraught with complexities, and any military engagement by the U.S. could have far-reaching implications for regional stability.

In summary, the U.S. response to the Iranian protests has been marked by a combination of military threats and diplomatic overtures, reflecting a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. While there is significant public opposition to military action, the administration's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric suggest a readiness to act if the situation escalates further. The Iranian government remains defiant, framing the protests as a foreign conspiracy while preparing for potential military confrontation. The outcome of this volatile situation remains uncertain, with the potential for significant geopolitical ramifications.

Remaining information gaps include:
1. Detailed assessments of the effectiveness of U.S. military options and their potential consequences on Iranian internal dynamics.
2. Insights into the Iranian opposition's organization and their potential role in a post-regime scenario.
3. A clearer understanding of the internal political dynamics within the U.S. administration regarding military action against Iran.
4. Public opinion trends in Iran regarding foreign intervention and the opposition's leadership.
5. The potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran's economy and their role in exacerbating public dissent.</Agent_report>

Query: historical context of U.S. military strikes in response to protests
The historical context of U.S. military strikes in response to protests, particularly in Iran, reveals a complex interplay of geopolitical strategy, domestic unrest, and international relations. The U.S. has a long history of military intervention that often coincides with significant domestic protests in other nations, framed under the guise of promoting democracy or protecting human rights. The current situation in Iran, marked by severe internal unrest and a violent government crackdown, provides a critical lens through which to examine the potential for U.S. military action against Iran before April 2026.

The Iranian protests that erupted in December 2025 were driven by a severe economic crisis characterized by rampant inflation and a dramatic collapse of the national currency, the rial, which had lost over 90% of its value since the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018. These economic hardships were exacerbated by international sanctions, leading to widespread discontent among the populace. The protests quickly escalated into mass demonstrations demanding fundamental changes to the political system, with protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic. The Iranian government's response was brutal, with reports indicating that thousands of protesters were killed during the crackdown, marking one of the deadliest periods of repression in decades (BBC, February 7, 2026).

This violent response drew international condemnation and raised concerns about potential U.S. military intervention. President Donald Trump publicly threatened military action against Iran if the regime continued its violent crackdown on protesters, stating that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the demonstrators. This rhetoric aligns with historical precedents where the U.S. has intervened in foreign nations under the pretext of supporting democracy, such as during the Vietnam War and the Arab Spring movements.

The U.S. military's involvement in the region has intensified following the June 2025 conflict between Israel and Iran, during which the U.S. conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming to have significantly damaged Iran's nuclear capabilities. This military action was framed as a necessary response to Iran's perceived threats to regional stability and its nuclear ambitions. However, the timing of U.S. military actions often coincides with significant domestic unrest in Iran, suggesting a strategic calculus that intertwines humanitarian rhetoric with geopolitical objectives.

The U.S. military buildup in the region, including the deployment of aircraft carrier strike groups and additional forces, reflects a readiness to respond to the situation in Iran. Analysts suggest that if military action were to occur, it would likely target Iran's missile infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and elements of the regime's security apparatus responsible for the crackdown on protesters. The convergence of these issues—Iran's missile capabilities, the regime's violent repression of protests, and its nuclear program—creates a complex environment for U.S. military planners, who may find it difficult to limit the scope of any military operation.

Historically, U.S. military interventions have had mixed results. While some, such as Operation Desert Storm in 1991, were deemed successful, many others, including interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, have resulted in prolonged conflict and instability. The U.S. has often intervened under the assumption that military action can achieve political objectives, but this has frequently led to unintended consequences, including regional destabilization and humanitarian crises. The current situation in Iran, marked by severe internal unrest and a violent government crackdown, presents a unique challenge for U.S. policymakers as they navigate the complexities of public opinion, regional stability, and the potential for military escalation.

The implications of a potential U.S. military strike against Iran are profound. While the Iranian regime appears vulnerable due to internal dissent, military action could provoke significant retaliation, destabilizing the region further and potentially leading to broader conflict. The historical context of U.S. interventions suggests that while military action may be framed as a means to support democracy, the outcomes often lead to unintended consequences, including prolonged conflict and regional instability.

Recent reports indicate that the Iranian regime is facing unprecedented internal turmoil, with protests driven by economic collapse and public anger at unresponsive governance. This domestic upheaval unfolds against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. The U.S. has positioned itself as a potential actor in this crisis, with Trump’s administration contemplating various military options, including targeted strikes against Iranian state security forces responsible for the violent crackdown on protests (Military.com, February 25, 2026).

The Iranian government has framed the protests as a foreign conspiracy, using this narrative to justify its repressive measures. However, the regime's reliance on brute force to maintain control may ultimately undermine its legitimacy. The potential for U.S. military action could further complicate the situation, as it may provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. interests in the region, including military bases and allied nations (WRAL.com, February 26, 2026).

In summary, the historical context of U.S. military strikes in response to protests underscores a pattern of intervention that is often framed as a means to promote democracy but is influenced by broader geopolitical considerations. The situation in Iran, marked by severe internal unrest and a violent government crackdown, presents a unique challenge for U.S. policymakers as they navigate the complexities of public opinion, regional stability, and the potential for military escalation. The convergence of economic crisis, domestic protests, and international tensions creates a precarious environment for both Iran and the U.S., with significant implications for the future of U.S.-Iran relations.

The U.S. military's readiness to respond to the situation in Iran, coupled with Trump's threats of intervention, raises the stakes for both nations. The historical context of U.S. military strikes in response to protests highlights a pattern of intervention that is often justified by humanitarian concerns but is deeply rooted in geopolitical strategy. As the deadline of April 2026 approaches, the interplay between domestic unrest in Iran and U.S. military strategy will be critical in determining the future of U.S.-Iran relations. The potential for military intervention remains high, particularly if the Iranian government continues its violent crackdown on protesters. However, public sentiment in the U.S. is largely against military intervention, with polls indicating that a significant majority of Americans oppose military action in Iran. This disconnect between political rhetoric and public opinion could complicate any decision-making process regarding military action.</Agent_report>

Query: factors leading to U.S. military de-escalation in conflicts
The factors leading to U.S. military de-escalation in conflicts, especially regarding Iran, are multifaceted and deeply rooted in historical precedents, public sentiment, military assessments, geopolitical dynamics, and economic conditions. These elements are crucial for understanding the current tensions and the likelihood of U.S. military action against Iran before April 2026.

Historically, U.S. military interventions have often followed cycles of escalation and de-escalation, shaped by the outcomes of previous engagements. The experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan have fostered a wariness of prolonged military commitments, leading to a preference for de-escalation strategies when feasible. The U.S. has learned that military actions can lead to unintended consequences, prompting a reevaluation of its military strategies. This historical context informs current policy decisions regarding Iran, as the U.S. weighs the potential costs of military action against the backdrop of past conflicts.

Public opinion plays a significant role in shaping U.S. military actions. Recent polling indicates that a substantial majority of Americans oppose military intervention in Iran, particularly in light of the ongoing protests against the Iranian government. For instance, a January poll from Quinnipiac University showed that 70% of Americans opposed military action if protesters were killed by the government. This sentiment reflects a broader trend of reluctance towards foreign military engagements, particularly after the costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The American public's skepticism towards military interventions is likely to influence policymakers, who may be hesitant to engage in another conflict that lacks clear public support. A YouGov poll conducted in February 2026 found that 48% of Americans oppose military action in Iran, with only 28% in favor, highlighting a significant divide in public sentiment (YouGov).

Military assessments also play a crucial role in decisions regarding escalation or de-escalation. The U.S. military has expressed concerns about the risks associated with prolonged conflicts, especially in regions where U.S. interests are not directly threatened. The complexities of the Iranian military landscape, including its missile capabilities and regional alliances, contribute to military caution regarding potential conflict with Iran. Reports indicate that U.S. military leadership, including General Dan Caine, has raised concerns about the risks of strikes on Iran, indicating a concerted messaging campaign to surface these concerns before any potential military action (Council on Foreign Relations). The military's apprehension is compounded by the potential for Iranian retaliation, which could involve targeting U.S. bases in the region and disrupting global oil supplies via the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime chokepoint (Council on Foreign Relations).

Geopolitical dynamics further complicate the U.S. approach to military action. The relationships between the U.S. and its allies, particularly in the Gulf region, influence decisions about military engagement. Gulf states have shown reluctance to support U.S. military action against Iran, fearing that such actions could destabilize the region further (War on the Rocks). The aftermath of the June 2025 Israel-Iran conflict, where Gulf states expressed concerns about escalating hostilities, underscores this hesitance. Regional leaders are advocating for diplomatic solutions to avoid conflict, reflecting a sober recognition that instability in Iran poses profound risks to their own security and economies (Stimson Center).

The economic situation in Iran plays a critical role in the calculus of U.S. military action. Iran is currently facing a severe economic crisis exacerbated by international sanctions and domestic mismanagement. The economic turmoil has led to widespread protests and social unrest, which could impact the Iranian regime's stability. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the sanctions have successfully created conditions for unrest in Iran, which could influence U.S. strategy moving forward (NPR). The Iranian rial has plummeted in value, leading to skyrocketing inflation and a significant decline in purchasing power for ordinary Iranians. This economic distress may make the Iranian regime more amenable to negotiations or concessions, thereby reducing the likelihood of military action.

In the context of the current U.S.-Iran tensions, President Trump's administration has adopted a confrontational stance, emphasizing the need to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump's threats of military action have been met with mixed reactions from both the public and lawmakers. While some congressional Democrats have expressed opposition to military escalation, others have shown tacit support for Trump's flexibility in responding to perceived threats (responsiblestatecraft.org). The disjointedness within the Democratic Party regarding military action against Iran reflects a broader uncertainty about the best course of action.

The military buildup in the region, characterized by the deployment of multiple aircraft carrier strike groups, signals a readiness for potential military action against Iran. However, experts warn that any military engagement could lead to significant regional instability and retaliation from Iran (PBS News). The Iranian leadership has indicated that any military confrontation could provoke a broader regional conflict, complicating U.S. military calculations (Council on Foreign Relations). The potential for escalation remains a critical concern, as both sides navigate a complex landscape of threats and responses.

Recent polling data further illustrates the American public's stance on military action against Iran. According to a YouGov poll conducted in February 2026, about half (49%) of Americans oppose the U.S. using military force to attack Iran, while only 27% support such an attack. Notably, 58% of Republicans support military action, while majorities of Democrats (76%) and Independents (54%) oppose it (YouGov). This partisan divide highlights the complexities of public opinion and its influence on U.S. foreign policy.

The internal dynamics of the Iranian regime are also critical to understanding the potential for U.S. military action. The 2025-2026 internal crisis in Iran, characterized by domestic unrest and political instability, has led to government crackdowns and mass arrests. The regime's response to protests has intensified repression, indicating a regime that is increasingly paranoid and willing to use violence to maintain control. This internal crisis, combined with economic instability, may weaken the regime's ability to respond effectively to external threats, potentially influencing U.S. calculations regarding military intervention.

In summary, the factors leading to U.S. military de-escalation in conflicts are influenced by historical experiences, public opinion, military assessments, geopolitical dynamics, and economic conditions. The current situation with Iran exemplifies these complexities, as the U.S. navigates the delicate balance between asserting its interests and managing the risks of escalation. While the potential for military action remains, the preference for diplomatic solutions and the recognition of the costs of war may ultimately guide U.S. policy decisions in the coming years.

Remaining information gaps include deeper insights into the internal dynamics within the Iranian regime, particularly regarding the potential for leadership change and its implications for U.S. strategy. Additionally, further analysis of the military's assessment of the risks associated with a prolonged conflict with Iran would be beneficial. Understanding the potential impact of U.S. military actions on regional allies and adversaries is also crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the situation.</Agent_report>
