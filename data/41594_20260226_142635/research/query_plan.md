Analysis:
The question seeks to determine whether the United States will attack Iran before April 2026, requiring a thorough understanding of historical precedents, current geopolitical dynamics, and key drivers influencing U.S.-Iran relations. The pre-research context provides a solid historical background on U.S.-Iran relations, recent escalations, and the current political landscape, including the impact of protests in Iran and U.S. responses. However, there are several gaps in information that need to be addressed: 

1. **Base Rate**: Historical frequency of U.S. military actions against Iran or similar nations in comparable contexts.
2. **Resolution Mechanism**: Specific criteria or events that would confirm an attack and the current state of military readiness or plans.
3. **Key Drivers**: Identification of the most significant factors influencing the likelihood of an attack, such as political pressures, military readiness, and international relations.
4. **Current State**: Latest developments in U.S.-Iran relations, including military movements, political statements, and international reactions.
5. **Contrarian Check**: Exploration of factors that could lead to a de-escalation or avoidance of conflict, despite current tensions.

The search strategy will focus on gathering historical data, current news, and insights into key drivers and potential contrarian scenarios.
