QUESTION:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Type: binary

Background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

Resolution criteria:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Fine print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">
The article provides a historical overview of the Iranian Revolution, which culminated in the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979 and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Key points include:

1. **Background**: The revolution was influenced by a series of events, including the 1953 CIA- and MI6-backed coup that reinstated Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch, leading to increased U.S. influence in Iran. The Shah's modernization efforts, known as the White Revolution, alienated various societal sectors, particularly the clergy.

2. **Revolutionary Events**: Anti-government demonstrations began in 1977, escalating into a broad-based uprising by late 1978. A significant turning point was the Cinema Rex fire, which fueled public outrage against the Shah's regime. By early 1979, Khomeini returned to Iran, and the monarchy was dismantled by February 11, 1979.

3. **Post-Revolution**: The revolution replaced a pro-Western secular monarchy with an anti-Western Islamic republic, led by Khomeini. The new government aimed to undermine Sunni influence in the region and support Shia political ascendancy.

4. **Perceptions of the Shah's Regime**: The Shah was viewed as corrupt and overly reliant on foreign powers, particularly the U.S., which contributed to widespread discontent. The revolution was characterized by a mix of nationalist goals, political populism, and religious radicalism.

5. **Significance**: The Iranian Revolution marked a profound change in Iran's political landscape, leading to the establishment of a regime that opposed Western influence and sought to export its revolutionary ideals across the region.

Overall, the article outlines the complex interplay of historical, political, and social factors that led to the Iranian Revolution and its lasting impact on Iran and its relations with the West.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations">
The article discusses the turbulent history of Iran–United States relations, which began in the mid-to-late 19th century and have been characterized by significant events and shifts in policy. Initially, the U.S. was viewed as a trustworthy ally by Iran, especially during the Qajar dynasty. However, relations soured dramatically after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which resulted in the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

Since April 7, 1980, the two nations have had no formal diplomatic relations, relying instead on third-party countries for communication. The U.S. has imposed a trade embargo on Iran since 1995, and relations further deteriorated after the U.S. withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, reinstating sanctions and initiating a "maximum pressure campaign" against Iran.

The article highlights the Iranian government's narrative of animosity towards the U.S., attributing it to U.S. support for Israel and perceived imperialistic ambitions. Conversely, the U.S. cites Iran's human rights abuses, its nuclear ambitions, and its support for terrorist organizations as reasons for the strained relations.

Public opinion in both countries reflects a deep-seated animosity, with a 2013 BBC poll indicating that only 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively, while a 2019 survey showed that 13% of Iranians have a favorable view of the U.S. The article also notes that relations have improved during periods of shared interests, such as during the Iraq War and the fight against ISIS.

Overall, the article outlines a complex and often adversarial relationship shaped by historical events, ideological differences, and geopolitical interests.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration">
The article discusses the Iran–United States relations during the first Trump administration (2017–2021), highlighting a significant shift from the previous administration's engagement approach to a more confrontational stance. Key points include:

1. **Policy Changes**: Trump implemented a travel ban affecting Iranian citizens and withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), initiating a maximum pressure campaign that included over 1,500 sanctions targeting Iran's economy, particularly its financial, oil, and shipping sectors.

2. **Iran's Response**: In reaction to U.S. actions, Iran threatened to resume unrestricted uranium enrichment and rejected negotiations with the Trump administration. Tensions escalated with incidents such as the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran and attacks on oil tankers.

3. **Major Escalations**: The assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020 by a U.S. drone strike led to Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq, heightening fears of war. The crisis continued with retaliatory strikes and accusations of Iranian interference in U.S. affairs.

4. **Diplomatic Isolation**: The U.S. faced strong resistance to its policies, even from allies, leading to diplomatic isolation. The maximum pressure campaign aimed to force Iran to renegotiate the nuclear agreement but resulted in increased hostility and unresolved disputes.

5. **Military and Economic Impact**: The sanctions severely damaged Iran's economy, leading to a sharp decline in oil exports and significant inflation. Iranian leaders, including President Rouhani, warned that any attempt to prevent Iran's oil exports would lead to broader regional conflict.

Overall, the article outlines a period marked by escalating tensions and a lack of diplomatic resolution, with both sides engaging in aggressive rhetoric and actions.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement finalized on July 14, 2015, between Iran and the P5+1 countries (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) along with the European Union. The JCPOA aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Key points of the JCPOA include:
- Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear activities, including limiting the number and type of centrifuges, the level of uranium enrichment, and the size of its enriched uranium stockpile.
- Key facilities such as Fordow, Natanz, and Arak were repurposed for civilian uses, and Iran accepted more intrusive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
- In return for compliance, Iran received relief from nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the UN, EU, and the U.S., although many U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue remained in place.

The agreement took effect on January 20, 2016, but faced criticism from various parties, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, leading to the re-imposition of sanctions that effectively nullified the economic benefits of the deal for Iran. Following the June 2025 Iran-Israel war, Iran officially announced the termination of the JCPOA on October 18, 2025.

The JCPOA was a culmination of extensive negotiations that began with an interim agreement in 2013, leading to a framework agreement in April 2015 and the final deal in July 2015. The agreement was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while allowing for peaceful nuclear energy development under strict regulations.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani">
The article discusses the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a high-ranking Iranian general, by a U.S. drone strike on January 3, 2020. Soleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful figure in Iran after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The strike occurred near Baghdad International Airport while Soleimani was en route to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.

Key points include:

1. **Context of the Assassination**: The strike was part of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, particularly following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions. The assassination was justified by U.S. officials as a necessary action to prevent an "imminent attack" and to protect U.S. personnel.

2. **Consequences**: The assassination led to heightened tensions, with Iranian leaders vowing revenge. In retaliation, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq shortly after the strike. The incident marked a significant escalation in U.S.-Iran relations.

3. **International Reactions**: The assassination was met with widespread concern from the international community, with calls for restraint and diplomacy. Critics, including the United Nations special rapporteur, argued that the strike likely violated international law.

4. **Political Implications**: The article notes that the assassination reflects a broader trend of eroding norms against targeted killings of foreign leaders. It also highlights the complex political landscape in the Middle East, where such actions can have far-reaching consequences.

5. **Historical Context**: The article provides background on U.S. and Iranian activities in Iraq since 2014, including the U.S. intervention against ISIS and the role of Iranian-backed militias.

Overall, the assassination of Soleimani is portrayed as a pivotal moment in U.S.-Iran relations, with significant implications for regional stability and international law.
