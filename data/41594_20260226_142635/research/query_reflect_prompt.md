YOUR TASK:
Evaluate coverage across these dimensions. For each, state COVERED or GAP with a brief note (1 sentence):

1. Base rate: Do we have historical frequency/distribution data for the outcome?
2. Resolution mechanism: Do we know the current state of the specific metric/event that determines resolution?
3. Key drivers: Do we have data on the main causal factors?
4. Current state: Do we have recent (last 7 days) news or data?
5. Contrarian: Do we have information supporting the less obvious outcome?

Then decide:
- If research is sufficient for a well-calibrated forecast: Write "Coverage: SUFFICIENT"
- If there are important gaps that would materially change a forecast: Write "Coverage: GAPS_FOUND" followed by 1-3 targeted queries to fill the most critical gaps

Only generate gap-fill queries for gaps that would materially affect a forecaster's prediction. Do not generate queries for nice-to-have information.

Use the same tagged format:
