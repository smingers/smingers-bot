**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence (large probability shifts):**

1. **Congressional briefing by Rubio and CIA Director Ratcliffe on Iran strike plans (Feb 24, 2026)** - Multiple credible sources (NYPost, others). This is a formal pre-strike notification step. Historically, such briefings precede action. Direct causal mechanism: administration preparing political cover. **Shifts probability UP significantly.**

2. **CBS News reporting that national security officials told Trump military was ready for strikes "as early as Saturday" (Feb 21, 2026)** - Highly credible source. This is the most direct evidence of imminent strike preparation. However, the strike did NOT occur on Feb 21 (we are now Feb 26 with no reported strike). **Partially discounted because the predicted strike didn't happen, but still shows high operational readiness. Net: moderate upward shift.**

3. **Two carrier strike groups deployed + 50+ aircraft moved to region + Azores/Crete bases (used in June 2025) now active** - Multiple credible sources (CBS, Aviationist, TWZ, RFERL). This is the largest U.S. military buildup in the Middle East since 2003. Direct causal mechanism: operational preparation for strikes. **Shifts probability UP significantly.**

4. **State Department partial evacuation of Lebanon embassy (Feb 24, 2026)** - Reported by multiple sources. Historically, embassy evacuations precede military action. This is a structural/institutional action that is difficult to reverse. **Shifts probability UP moderately-strongly.**

5. **Trump's State of the Union (Feb 24, 2026) explicitly citing three justifications for war with Iran** - Primary source. Trump publicly stated Iran is developing missiles capable of reaching the U.S., restarted nuclear program, and killed 32,000 protesters. This creates a public commitment that is politically costly to walk back. **Shifts probability UP moderately.**

6. **Witkoff stated Iran "probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material"** - Reported by NYPost citing Rubio's congressional briefing. If accurate, this creates urgency. However, this is a stated justification that may be exaggerated for political purposes. **Shifts probability UP moderately.**

**Moderate Evidence:**

7. **NYT reporting: Trump weighing initial limited strike, then regime change if no results** - Multiple secondary sources citing NYT. Consistent with other reporting. Suggests a concrete plan exists. **Shifts probability UP moderately.**

8. **Trump insiders creating "off-ramp" (limited enrichment for medical purposes)** - NYT via Raw Story. Suggests some within administration want to avoid strikes. **Shifts probability DOWN moderately.**

9. **Witkoff and Kushner reportedly urged Trump NOT to launch strikes** - Axios via Sky News Arabia. Two key Trump envoys opposing strikes is significant. However, Trump has overridden advisers before. **Shifts probability DOWN moderately.**

10. **General Caine reportedly warned of risks (munition shortages, no allied support, prolonged conflict)** - WaPo, WSJ, Axios. Trump denied this. If Caine's concerns are genuine, they represent a real constraint. **Shifts probability DOWN moderately.**

11. **Geneva talks scheduled for Feb 26 (today)** - Multiple sources. Active diplomacy creates a pathway to avoid strikes. Iran FM said agreement "within reach." **Shifts probability DOWN moderately.**

12. **Iran offered limited enrichment concessions** - Multiple sources. Iran is showing some flexibility, which may give Trump a diplomatic "win" without strikes. **Shifts probability DOWN moderately.**

13. **Trump advisers prefer Israel to strike first** - Politico via Charter97. If the preferred scenario is Israel striking first, U.S. direct strikes may be delayed. However, this could also mean U.S. strikes follow Israeli ones. **Ambiguous/slight downward shift for direct U.S. strikes in isolation.**

**Weak Evidence:**

14. **Sen. Thune and Cruz statements about regime change** - Political rhetoric from Republican senators. Not decision-makers. **Weak upward shift.**

15. **"Trump allies say strike is inevitable"** - Unnamed "close associates" per AL Masry Al Youm. Unverifiable. **Very weak upward shift.**

16. **AI model predictions** - No predictive value. **Disregarded.**

17. **Modern Diplomacy: anticipated Feb 1 strike didn't occur** - This is historical now. Shows Trump has already pulled back once. **Weak downward shift.**

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Remaining time:** February 26 to April 1, 2026 = **33 days remaining.**

If the timeframe were halved (~16 days to ~March 14): The probability would decrease significantly. The military buildup is in place, but the diplomatic track (Geneva talks today) would need to fail quickly, and Trump would need to make a rapid decision. The shorter window reduces the probability of all conditions aligning. Estimate: ~35-40%.

If the timeframe were doubled (~66 days to ~May 1): The probability would increase. More time for the diplomatic track to fail, for military assets to fully position (USS George H.W. Bush arrives mid-March), and for Trump to make a decision. The military buildup would be complete. Estimate: ~60-65%.

The 33-day window is actually quite significant given the pace of events. The USS George H.W. Bush arrives mid-March, which is within the window. The Geneva talks today (Feb 26) are a critical near-term decision point.

**(d) Justification**

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 44% (adjusted from 8.6% generic base rate due to extraordinary circumstances: prior U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025, massive military buildup, explicit presidential threats, operational signals).

**Key upward adjustments:**

1. **Congressional briefing (Feb 24) + State Dept Lebanon evacuation (Feb 24):** These are pre-strike institutional actions. The administration is preparing political and logistical cover. This is a strong signal. +5% to base.

2. **CBS News: military ready "as early as Saturday" (Feb 21):** The strike didn't happen Feb 21, but the readiness is confirmed. The delay doesn't negate the readiness. +3%.

3. **Azores/Crete bases active (same as June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer):** This is the most direct operational parallel to the last time the U.S. struck Iran. +5%.

4. **Trump SOTU (Feb 24) publicly committed to three justifications for war:** Political commitment that is costly to walk back. +3%.

5. **Two carrier strike groups fully deployed:** Unprecedented since 2003. +2%.

**Key downward adjustments:**

1. **Geneva talks occurring today (Feb 26):** Active diplomacy is the most immediate alternative to strikes. If Iran makes meaningful concessions today, strikes become less likely. -5%.

2. **Witkoff and Kushner (Trump's own envoys) urging against strikes:** These are Trump's most trusted advisers on Iran. Their opposition is significant. -4%.

3. **General Caine's reported concerns:** Even if Trump dismissed them publicly, real military constraints (munition shortages, no Arab base access) are structural. -3%.

4. **Trump explicitly decided against strikes in late January 2026:** He has already pulled back once. Pattern suggests he may do so again. -3%.

5. **Trump advisers prefer Israel to strike first:** If the preferred scenario involves Israel going first, direct U.S. strikes may be delayed beyond April 1. -2%.

6. **Only 33 days remaining:** Short window for all conditions to align. -2%.

**Net adjustment from 44% base:** +18% upward, -19% downward = approximately **43%**.

However, I need to reconsider the weight of the most recent evidence (Feb 24-26). The congressional briefing, Lebanon evacuation, SOTU commitments, and the fact that we're now at the "end of Trump's 10-15 day deadline" (stated Feb 19-20) are all very recent and significant. The Geneva talks today are the critical variable.

The scenario where Geneva talks fail today and Trump orders strikes within days is plausible. The scenario where Geneva talks produce enough of a framework for Trump to claim victory and delay strikes is also plausible.

**Final calibration:** Given the extraordinary military buildup, operational signals (Azores/Crete active, Lebanon evacuation), Trump's public commitments, and the imminent deadline, but also the active diplomatic track and internal opposition to strikes, I estimate approximately **47%** probability.

---

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view was 44%. The inside view evidence is roughly balanced with slight upward pressure from the most recent operational signals (congressional briefing, Lebanon evacuation, Azores/Crete activity, Trump's 10-15 day deadline expiring). The diplomatic track (Geneva talks today) is the primary countervailing force.

I'll set my final estimate at **47%**, reflecting:
- Very high operational readiness and pre-strike signals
- But genuine diplomatic activity that could provide an off-ramp
- Trump's demonstrated willingness to pull back at the last minute
- 33 days remaining is sufficient time for either outcome
- The question's resolution window ends April 1, which is before the USS George H.W. Bush fully arrives (mid-March), meaning the window captures the most dangerous period

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase:** Will the U.S. carry out a physical military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel between January 21 and April 1, 2026?
   - My analysis correctly focuses on this window. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** 44% (elevated from 8.6% generic due to extraordinary circumstances). My final prediction of 47% is rooted in this base rate with modest adjustments. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** "47 out of 100 times, the U.S. carries out a physical military attack against Iran before April 1, 2026." This is consistent with my analysis showing near-equal probability of strikes vs. diplomatic resolution. ✓

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - *Congressional briefing by Rubio/Ratcliffe on Feb 24 + State Dept Lebanon evacuation:* Verified by multiple credible sources. Pre-strike institutional steps. Valid.
   - *Azores/Crete bases active (same as Operation Midnight Hammer June 2025):* Verified by CBS News. Strong operational parallel. Valid.
   - *Witkoff/Kushner urging Trump against strikes + Geneva talks today:* Verified by Axios/Sky News Arabia. Significant countervailing force. Valid.
   - *Trump's 10-15 day deadline (stated Feb 19-20) now expiring:* Consistent with multiple sources. Creates urgency. Valid.
   - *Trump explicitly decided against strikes in late January:* Documented. Shows he can pull back. Valid.

5. **Blind spot:** The biggest scenario that would make my forecast look silly is if the Geneva talks today (Feb 26) produce a breakthrough framework agreement that Trump can declare a victory, leading to no strikes before April 1. This would push the true probability to ~15-20%, making my 47% look too high. Conversely, if strikes occurred within the next few days (before March 1), my 47% would look too low. I'll accept this uncertainty as inherent to the situation.

6. **Status quo outcome:** The status quo is "no U.S. attack on Iran" (the question has not yet resolved Yes). The world changes slowly, and Trump has already pulled back once. However, the current situation is genuinely volatile with a 33-day window and active military preparations. The status quo nudge is modest — perhaps -2% to -3%. But the operational signals are so strong that I won't fully retreat to the status quo.

**Final answer: 47%**

Probability: 47%
