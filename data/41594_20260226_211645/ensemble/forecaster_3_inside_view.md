Analysis:
1) **Paraphrase / resolution criteria (avoid bait-and-switch):**  
Will the U.S. conduct a **kinetic** military attack that **physically affects Iran’s territory or Iranian military personnel**, at any time **from now until before 1 Apr 2026** (resolution window began **Jan 21, 2026**)?

2) **(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; fact vs opinion)**

**The Aviationist (Feb 13, 2026)** – reports USS *Gerald R. Ford* ordered to Middle East; notes strain/availability issues; mentions Growlers and two-carrier posture.  
- **Quality:** Good on observable force posture; generally careful; not definitive on intent.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Facts = redeployment details; opinion = implications about “what action” likely.

**RFE/RL (Feb 11, 2026)** – describes “robust” Gulf buildup; 40k troops; air/missile defenses; mentions drone shootdown; experts interpret as pressure + scalable.  
- **Quality:** Solid; includes named experts; moderate-to-high reliability.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Facts = deployments and shootdown; opinions = expert interpretation.

**The War Zone (Feb 11, 2026)** – WSJ-sourced report that a second CSG told to spin up (likely *GHW Bush*), could arrive mid-March; notes current airpower limits for sustained ops; emphasizes signaling.  
- **Quality:** Good defense reporting; reliance on WSJ anonymous officials lowers certainty but still meaningful.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Facts = reported planning and force composition; analysis = “pressure tool,” sufficiency for sustained ops.

**AskNews – The Hill (Feb 26, 2026)** – Thune says if strikes occur they should aim at regime change; indicates expectation strikes possible soon.  
- **Quality:** High for the fact he said it; low-to-moderate predictive value (political positioning).  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly opinion/advocacy.

**AskNews – Politico-echoed piece (Feb 26, 2026)** – claims some Trump advisers prefer Israel strike first for politics; says joint operation still most likely; Geneva meeting Feb 26.  
- **Quality:** Mixed/unclear due to reprint/translation; but Politico as upstream is usually solid. Treat as **moderate**.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Anonymous-adviser claims; interpretive political analysis.

**AskNews – NYT-described reporting (multiple items Feb 23–26, 2026 via Times of Israel/Raw Story/RFI/RT Arabic summaries)** – key claims: Trump weighing **limited near-term strikes** to pressure Iran; “off-ramp” proposal (allow tiny medical enrichment); internal doubts about efficacy; possible escalation to regime-change later in 2026.  
- **Quality:** If genuinely NYT-sourced, this is **high-quality** on internal deliberations, though still contingent. Downstream summaries (RT Arabic, Raw Story) add noise; I weight the **core NYT claim** but discount embellishments.

**AskNews – CBS News / Yahoo syndication (Feb 19–20, 2026)** – “scores of warplanes” deploying; AIS signaling by *Ford*; officials say forces could be ready as early as that weekend; still no final decision.  
- **Quality:** High; CBS is strong for force-movement + sourced readiness claims.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Facts = observed flights/tracking and deployments; claims about “ready Saturday” are sourced (still probabilistic).

**AskNews – multiple international outlets (Feb 23–25, 2026)** – Trump public statements: prefers deal, but “very bad day” if no deal; denies generals warned against strike; SOTU rhetoric about protests, missiles, nukes. Iran says deal “within reach,” warns any strike is aggression.  
- **Quality:** High for direct quotes and scheduled talks; lower for interpreting internal military dissent (anonymous-sourced).  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual recounting of statements.

**Overall:** The best “actionable” evidence comes from **observable military posture (CBS, RFE/RL, Aviationist)** plus **credible reporting on White House deliberations (NYT references)**. Political takes (Thune, some reprints) are weaker.

3) **(b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system**

### Strong evidence (large potential shifts)
- **Large-scale, multi-domain force positioning** (2 carriers; surge of combat/support aircraft; missile defenses; destroyers) reported by **multiple independent outlets** (CBS, RFE/RL, Aviationist, TWZ).  
  *Mechanism:* reduces execution constraints and increases option-value for striking quickly.
- **Direct reporting that strike options are being actively deliberated with near-term readiness** (CBS readiness-as-soon-as-weekend; NYT-style reporting of “limited strike” consideration).  
  *Mechanism:* indicates this is not just generic deterrence.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- **Diplomatic “off-ramp” appears real and live** (Geneva talks scheduled Feb 26; Iranian FM says “within reach”; reports of compromise proposals like minimal medical enrichment).  
  *Mechanism:* provides a face-saving alternative that can delay/avoid kinetic action.
- **Internal executive-branch friction / military caution reports** (munition constraints, allied basing concerns, escalation risk).  
  *Mechanism:* raises decision threshold and can favor coercive posture without crossing into “attack.”

### Weak evidence (small shifts)
- **Domestic political signaling from Congress (e.g., Thune)** and media narratives about who should strike first (Israel vs US).  
  *Mechanism:* may shape sequencing/messaging, but weakly predictive of actual kinetic action within 34 days.
- **AI model “date predictions”** (RT Arabic novelty piece).  
  *Mechanism:* essentially not evidence.

4) **(c) Timeframe analysis**
- **Time left:** From **Feb 26, 2026 to Apr 1, 2026 ≈ 34 days**. Very short.
- **If timeframe were halved (~17 days):** probability would drop somewhat but remain elevated because many indicators point to an **early-March decision window** (Trump’s “10–15 day” language; current deployments already in motion).  
- **If timeframe were doubled (~68 days):** probability would rise materially because even if Geneva produces a temporary pause, the posture + unresolved nuclear dispute could cycle back to strikes.

5) **(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view = 55%)**
My outside view baseline (55%) already assumed “crisis + pre-strike indicators + precedent (June 2025)” but discounted for diplomacy and Trump’s prior hesitation.

**What moves me upward (pro-Yes):**
- **Convergence of readiness + signaling:** The combination of (i) two-carrier presence, (ii) mass aircraft movements, (iii) defensive batteries, and (iv) sourced claims that strikes could begin on short notice suggests the U.S. is not merely posturing. This is the clearest “capability + intent” alignment in the dataset provided.
- **Compressed decision timeline:** Trump’s publicly described short deadline (10–15 days) is a credible commitment device that often ends in either (a) a deal, or (b) action—within this question’s window.

**What moves me downward (pro-No):**
- **A plausible diplomatic off-ramp exists right now** (Geneva Feb 26; reports of a minimal-enrichment compromise). A face-saving “framework” deal is a historically common way to avoid imminent strikes even if it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.
- **High perceived escalation costs** (regional retaliation, Hormuz risk, force protection) plus reported military caution plausibly keeps the U.S. at “maximum pressure” without crossing into a new kinetic attack during this short horizon.
- **Sequencing risk:** reporting that some advisers may want Israel to strike first could push actual U.S. kinetic action beyond the window (or create ambiguity about responsibility).

**Net:** The evidence since the outside-view baseline is slightly more “imminence-coded” (CBS readiness, continued force flow, congressional briefings) but not decisive because diplomacy is active and an off-ramp is being built. I therefore nudge **up modestly**, not radically.

Probability calibration:
- **Outside view base rate (given): 55%.**
- **Inside-view update:** +5% for multi-source near-term readiness signals and force positioning; −2% for credible off-ramp/diplomacy signals and internal caution → **~58%**.

I interpret this as: under the current status quo (pressure + talks + forces in place), the most likely path is **either** a limited strike to coerce (Yes) **or** a thin deal that postpones strikes (No). The balance is slightly toward “Yes” because (1) forces are already flowing, and (2) the time window is short and aligned with the stated deadline.

Checklist:
1. **Criteria check:** Must be a **physical** U.S. attack affecting **Iranian territory or military personnel** before **Apr 1, 2026**; cyber/warning shots don’t count.  
2. **Outside view anchor:** 55% baseline used.  
3. **Consistency line:** **58 out of 100 times**, the U.S. conducts a qualifying kinetic attack on Iran before Apr 1, 2026.  
4. **Top evidence (3–5 items, <20 words each):**
   - Two-carrier posture + large air movements indicate real strike capacity in-theater.  
   - CBS/NYT-style reporting: strike readiness and active “limited strike” deliberations.  
   - Geneva talks/off-ramp proposals provide a viable escape valve.  
   - Escalation/force-protection concerns and allied basing politics raise strike threshold.  
5. **Blind spot:** A rapid “provocation/retaliation” spiral (proxy attack, mis-ID) could force strikes faster than expected → would raise probability.  
6. **Status quo bias check:** Default is continued pressure + talks; I kept probability <60% to respect that inertia.

Probability: 58%
