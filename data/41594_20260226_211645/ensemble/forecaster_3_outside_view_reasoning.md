**Analyzing outside views**

I need to rely on an outside view, using components sensibly for a prediction set for April 1, 2026, about 34 days away. The outside view should focus on base rates and reference classes instead of the latest inside information. Although the user mentions current analysis, it’s important to blend general historic context with recent events cautiously. I'll look at long-term trends of US actions toward sovereign states and adjust for the specific target and short timeframe.**Calculating attack probabilities**

For my reference class, I'm considering US attacks on sovereign nations, particularly in the Middle East, focusing on Iran. Historically, the rate for initiating attacks is about 8.6% per quarter. The time frame for this situation is roughly 70 days. Since it's currently 34 days left until April 1, I’ll use this as my focal point. I’ll compute the daily hazard rate and find that there's roughly a 3.3% probability of an attack in the remaining days and about 6.6% for the full window.**Adjusting for context with Iran**

I need to focus on US attacks against Iran specifically, as that's more relevant right now. Historically, the US has rarely attacked Iran—only in 1988, 2020, and 2025, giving me about two direct attacks over the past 45 years. Conditional on high-tension events, the probability might be higher. 

There’s also a sparse reference class for US attacks on Iran, except for 1988. Considering the context, the June 2025 attack suggests a chance for repeat actions within a year, similar to previous patterns in the Middle East.**Considering escalation probabilities**

Once conflict begins, repeated strikes become more likely, similar to Iraq in 1991 and then 2003. To apply an outside view, I could raise the initial probability from 3.3% to around 10-15% considering the escalation after the 2025 war. 

While avoiding current military buildup details, I have to consider background factors like past threats and crises. I'll settle on a 12% probability for the remaining 34 days based on historical antagonism between the US and Iran, even if it feels a bit high for a broader baseline.**Evaluating forecast sources**

The user requested an outside view, so I need to balance that with some context. Some forecasters estimate a 59% probability, which seems high compared to the base rate. I’ll conduct a source analysis, noting that while some Wikipedia entries are current, they can be edited. I’ll refer to summaries from reliable sources like Reuters to inform my understanding.

There are 34 days left, with historical initiation events being irregular. The unconditional rate is about 8.6% per quarter, and for this timeframe, it’s around 3.3%. While the outside view suggests a low baseline, given recent strikes and tensions, maybe I’ll settle on a 12.7% probability. I’ll need to discuss possible unknowns like false flags or limited strikes, making sure to base it on credible sources.
