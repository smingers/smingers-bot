Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological sampling, Feb 11 – 26 2026)

a. Aviationist 13 Feb 26: Factual reporting (carrier redeployment, extra EA-18Gs). Reputable niche defence site; details cross-confirmed by USN statements → good quality, factual.  
b. RFE/RL 11 Feb 26 & War Zone 11 Feb 26: Independent outlets, consistent facts on “robust” build-up and possible second CSG; both quote named Pentagon or WH officials. High reliability, factual.  
c. Large 25-26 Feb AskNews packet (The Hill, Politico, NYT, WaPo, J-Post, CBS, etc.): Main-stream US / Israeli media quoting identifiable senators, officials, leaked Situation-Room briefings. Quality varies by piece but the common facts—two CSGs in-theatre, Geneva talks 26 Feb, 10-15-day ultimatum, congressional briefings—are multiply corroborated → strong evidence. Opinions from unnamed “Trump advisers” or AI-model pieces are speculative and treated as weak.  
d. Modern Diplomacy 07 Feb 26 & FairObserver 14 Feb 26: Analytical/op-ed, anonymous authors; treated only for context (weak).  
e. CFR timeline: purely historical background.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong (moves probability a lot)  
• Confirmed two US carrier strike groups + 40 000 troops + Growlers & F-35s already inside CENTCOM; third CSG warned to “stand by”. (Aviationist, RFE/RL, War Zone, CBS) – shows hard capability in-place.  
• President Trump, VP Vance, SecState Rubio publicly threaten “limited strike in 10-15 days” if Geneva talks fail; June 2025 precedent proves Trump will authorise kinetic action. (NYT, CBS, J-Post, official transcripts).  
• Multiple independent reports of detailed target lists & Situation-Room planning briefings to Congress (NY Post, WaPo, WSJ).  

Moderate (moves some)  
• Active diplomatic channel: Geneva 26 Feb. Iran FM says deal “within reach”; US envoys push for off-ramp (Sky News Arabia, RFI).  
• Senior military caution – reported ammo shortage, ally base-access doubts (WaPo/Axios leaks).  
• Public opinion: only 18 % Americans back a strike (NY Post poll) – creates domestic headwind.  
• Expert/market consensus (Sentinel aggregator) ~59 % by 31 Mar – crowd wisdom but possibly hype-biased.

Weak  
• AI date-picking story, anonymous op-eds, partisan commentary.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 34.  If window halved to 17 days, probability falls roughly one-third because a second CSG would not arrive and Geneva results still pending.  If doubled to 68 days, probability rises to ~45 % as the military window stays open and diplomacy may fail.

4. Justification – from outside to inside view  
Outside view (reference class “US initiates strike on a sovereign state” scaled to 34 days) = 12.8 %.  
Adjust upwards for:  
+ Large, verified force-deployment (+1.0 log-odds)  
+ Explicit presidential deadline & recent precedent (+0.4 l-o)  
Adjust downwards for:  
– Ongoing real negotiations & some Iranian concessions (–0.4 l-o)  
– Documented Pentagon/al-lied caution & low US public support (–0.2 l-o)  
Net additions plus a nudge toward the 59 % market view (+0.35 l-o) give post-update odds ≈0.46 → P ≈32 %.

Inside-view narrative:  A strike is neither certain nor remote.  Trump has both the means and political inclination but has historically blinked when a last-minute face-saving deal appeared.  Geneva talks could supply that face-saver; failure would coincide with full arrival of the naval/air package in early March, still inside the window.  Thus roughly one-third of timelines end with at least one US bomb or missile hitting Iranian territory/personnel before 1 Apr 26.

Probability calibration
My inside-view probability that the United States carries out a qualifying physical attack on Iran before 1 April 2026 is 32 %.

Checklist:  
1. Restated question: “Between 21 Jan and 31 Mar 2026 inclusive, will US forces kinetically strike Iranian territory/personnel?” ✔  
2. Base rate used: 12.8 %. ✔  
3. Consistency line: “Roughly 32 out of 100 times, a US strike would occur in the remaining 34 days.” ✔  
4. Key evidence: (i) two CSGs already deployed; (ii) Trump 10-15-day ultimatum; (iii) June 2025 precedent; (iv) active Geneva talks; (v) Pentagon caution/leaks. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid Israeli solo raid triggering immediate US “defensive” intervention same night (would push probability higher). ✔  
6. Status-quo bias check: No strike so far; inertia favours ‘No’, hence a number below 50 % feels appropriate. ✔

Probability: 32%
