**Crafting probabilities for conflict**

I'm focusing on creating a superforecasting-style answer, considering an outside view probability of 12.8% for a U.S. strike on Iran before April 1, 2026. I need to analyze sources and weigh evidence, adjusting the inside view based on various factors, especially with the approaching timeframe. Current indicators suggest a potential increase in strike likelihood—experts are estimating a 59% chance by March 31. However, while we need to address the threats and military build-up, there are also ongoing diplomatic talks. So, a careful assessment is crucial!**Analyzing conflict triggers**

Today's February 26, and I'm diving into the triggers for a potential U.S. strike on Iran. Factors favoring action include a substantial military buildup with two carriers, threats from Trump within a limited timeframe, and political pressures for regime change. However, ongoing diplomatic talks and internal military caution weigh against it. Trump's unpredictability and low public support are also important considerations. Given strong military evidence, I estimate the probability of action may sit around 30-40%, with significant adjustments from the initial 13%. It’s a complex situation!**Calculating strike probabilities**

I’m estimating probabilities connected to a potential strike decision by Trump. The diplomatic track might reduce probabilities a bit, while his explicit timeline adds some weight. With a 34-day timeframe, the decision likelihood could be around 40%, but it might extend past April 1. I’ll assess outside factors, including military buildup and diplomatic progress. Ultimately, I calculate the final probability to be about 32%, with an error margin of ±10%. As I finalize, I’ll also analyze different timeframes to make sure everything is comprehensive!
