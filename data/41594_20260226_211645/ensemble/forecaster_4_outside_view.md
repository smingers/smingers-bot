Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia background articles (Iranian Revolution; Iran-US relations; JCPOA; first-term Trump relations).  
   • Quality: High on basic facts, moderate on recent events.  Well sourced, last‐edited 2026-02.  
   • Mostly factual chronologies; opinions limited to quoted officials.  

2. Wikipedia “United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites” (Operation Midnight Hammer, June 2025).  
   • Quality: Reasonably reliable summary of a widely covered, confirmed event.  Factual.  

3. CGTN timeline of January 2026 escalation.  
   • Chinese state-run outlet; ideological slant probable, but entries are cross-checkable.  Treat quoted dates/events as facts, interpretations as opinion.  

4. Wikipedia “2026 U.S. military buildup in the Middle East”.  
   • Crowd-edited; some statements lack citations.  Treat hard numbers (ship movements, dates) as tentative until corroborated; treat causal language as opinion.  

5. Jeffries-house.gov press release & TRTWorld article on a forthcoming House War-Powers vote.  
   • Primary sources for Congressional intent; factual on legislative scheduling and quotations.  

6. War Powers Resolution article.  Stable U.S. law; purely factual.  

7. Agent report: tally of every quarter since 1989 in which the U.S. opened kinetic hostilities against a sovereign state (12 quarters / 140, base rate ≈ 8.6 %).  
   • Methodology transparent, dates easily verified.  Provides a sound statistical baseline.  Assumes public acknowledgement of attacks; covert actions excluded.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Any new U.S. attack on any sovereign state”  (12 initiations in 140 quarters → 8.6 %/quarter).  Broad but data-rich; ignores target specificity.  
2. “U.S. attack on Iran” (1988 Praying Mantis; 2025 Midnight Hammer) → 2 initiations in 188 quarters (1.1 %/quarter).  Target-specific but data-poor (only two points).  
3. “Follow-on U.S. strike on a state it hit within the previous 12 months” (e.g., Syria 2017→2018; Iraq 1991→1993) – rough estimate 2 follow-ups in ~300 state-quarters (~0.7 %).  Even sparser.  

Suitability: class 1 is numerically robust but too generic; class 2 is narrowly on-point yet extremely small-n; class 3 adds the ‘recently struck’ feature but is still tiny.  Best practice is to start with class 1 for statistical stability, then adjust downward for “specifically Iran” (class 2).  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window remaining: 26 Feb → 1 Apr 2026 = 34 days ≈ 0.38 quarters.  
If the unconditional chance of initiation against Iran were truly 1.1 % per full quarter (class 2), the naïve probability over 0.38 quarters would be 0.38 × 1.1 % ≈ 0.4 %.  
If one instead used the broader 8.6 % figure, that would scale to ≈ 3.3 %.  The truth should lie between.  

(d) Justification for outside view  
• Very low long-run frequency of U.S. attacks on Iranian territory (2 in 47 years).  
• Even in the highly active post-Cold-War era, Iran has been the target in only 1 of the last 12 initiation quarters.  
• Congressional pushback (Khanna-Massie resolution) and the legal friction of the War Powers Act historically lower the odds of fresh action inside tight windows.  
• Although a build-up is under way, peacetime U.S. carrier deployments vastly outnumber actual strikes, so they do not, by themselves, overturn the baseline.  
• Expert/market anchor: Sentinel team’s 59 % for any U.S. strike by 31 Mar 2026 was posted 21 Jan — before Trump publicly said on 28 Jan he had “decided on his own not to launch,” and before Congress scheduled the War-Powers vote.  Markets look overstretched relative to historical base rates.  

Outside view calibration:

1. Start with class 2 prior: 1.1 % per 90-day quarter.  
2. Adjust for 34-day window: × 0.38 → 0.42 %.  
3. Up-adjust slightly (+0.3 pp) because Iran was struck only nine months ago, and repeat strikes within a year, while rare, are not unprecedented.  
4. Down-adjust (−0.1 pp) for impending Congressional constraint signal and Trump’s stated reluctance.  
Net outside-view probability ≈ 0.6 %.  

Round only as needed for clarity.
