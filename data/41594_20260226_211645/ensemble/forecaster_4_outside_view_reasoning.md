**Crafting source analysis**

I need to create an analysis of sources, focusing on an outside view baseline before considering internal factors. We have an agent report showing an 8.6% base rate for U.S. kinetic military actions against sovereign states. The specific question involves the likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran within 70 days, from January 21 to April 1, 2026. Today is February 26, so we have about 34 days left; however, I should base my analysis on historical data rather than current specifics, isolating facts from opinions in the evaluated sources.**Summarizing categories and reference classes**

I need to produce summaries for major categories related to U.S.-Iran relations. First, there are historical context articles, like those covering the Iranian Revolution and U.S. relations, which are high quality. Then there's past U.S.-Iran relations under Trump, Operation Midnight Hammer in June 2025, and various articles of moderate reliability from sources like Wikipedia and CGTN.

I’ll analyze the reliability of each source and reference a base rate of 8.6% for U.S. attacks on sovereign states, refining it specifically to U.S. attacks on Iran, which shows a low occurrence. We can consider instances of repeat attacks on the same adversary within a year as a useful reference class, with an expected rate of about 1% per quarter for my timeframe.**Establishing an attack probability**

I'm considering the likelihood of a U.S. attack on Middle Eastern states, like Iraq and Syria, where I've noted that about 8 out of 12 historical events targeted this region, giving a base rate of 5.7%. 

For the timeframe of January 21 to April 1, 2026, I’ll adjust this base rate since it's roughly 70 days rather than the typical 90-day quarter. I find that the probability for U.S. attacks on Iran might be around 1.5%, while factoring in the history of repeated attacks after initial strikes could bring this baseline up to roughly 4% to 5%. I’ll finalize the outside view calibration reflecting this.
