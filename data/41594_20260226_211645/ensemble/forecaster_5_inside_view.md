Analysis:

1. Title paraphrase & resolution rule (≤30 words)
“Will U.S. forces carry out any kinetic attack that physically hits Iranian territory or troops between now (26 Feb 2026) and 31 Mar 2026?  ‘Yes’ if they do.”

2. Outside-view anchor  
Reference class: post-Cold-War U.S. first-strikes on militarily capable regional states (Iraq ’91/’03, Serbia ’99, Libya ’11).  Frequency 4 / 35 years ≈ 11 % per year.  Scaling to a 35-day window ⇒ 1.1 %.  Small serial-correlation, congressional push-back, etc. ⇒ outside-view point estimate 1.3 %.

3. Source & evidence weighting  
(Representative sample; all dated 11–26 Feb 2026.)

Strong evidence  
• RFE/RL, CBS, War Zone, Aviationist – independently confirm two CSGs on station, a third spinning-up, extra THAAD/Patriot, B-2s on strip-alert → U.S. has the physical ability to strike quickly.  
• On-record presidential statements (Truth Social, State-of-the-Union): Trump sets 10- to 15-day deadline, threatens attack “far worse than June 2025”.  
• Briefing of the “Gang of Eight” on targeting options (NY Post, 24 Feb) → institutional preparation.

Moderate evidence  
• NYT, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg – anonymous officials: two-stage concept (limited strike then possible regime-change).  
• Senate/GOP leaders (Thune, Cruz) publicly frame strikes as desirable for regime change.  
• Sentinel crowd-forecast median 59 % for a strike by 31 Mar 2026.

Weak evidence  
• AI-model date-picking story; social-media rumor.  
• Opinion pieces claiming “inevitable” war or certain de-escalation.

Net tilt of evidence: large, multi-sourced, and directly causal toward readiness to strike; only single-sourced or speculative items argue the opposite.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining to deadline: 35.  
Probability is not linear; we are clearly in a “decision window.”  Halving the window to 17 days would cut the estimate only modestly (≈ 25 % → 20 %), because carriers and strike aircraft are already on station.  Doubling to 70 days (hypothetical extension) would raise it only slightly (≈ 25 % → 30 %); the political decision is front-loaded.

5. Inside-view adjustments  
a. Negotiations.  Fresh indirect talks open today (26 Feb).  Chance they yield a face-saving mini-deal that stops a strike ≈ 20 % (moderate evidence).  
b. Presidential calculus.  Trump has demonstrated willingness to strike Iran (Jun 2025) and publicly linked military action to protest suppression and nuclear issues; domestic public support is low (18 %), but his inner circle and key Senate allies are supportive.  
c. Military readiness & sunk-cost dynamic.  Deployments are expensive; once forces are massed, history (Iraq ’03, Libya ’11) shows ~40 % chance they are used.  
d. Bureaucratic caution: Joint Chiefs warn of ammo stocks and escalation; Congress preparing War-Powers vote.  Historically such friction succeeds in delaying about half of contemplated actions.  
e. Israeli factor.  Israel favours action and could provoke, but U.S. insiders reportedly prefer Washington to retain first-move control.

Fermi split  
- Probability talks succeed: 20 % ⇒ strike likelihood 5 % in that branch.  
- Talks fail/delay: 80 % ⇒ strike likelihood 40 % in that branch (limited or symbolic).  
Combined: 0.20 × 0.05 + 0.80 × 0.40 ≈ 0.33 (33 %).

Compared with the 1.3 % outside anchor, the current, exceptional force posture and presidential deadlines are sufficiently non-analogous to earlier cases to justify a ~25-fold upward shift.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 33 out of 100 times, the United States would launch at least one physical attack on Iran between 26 Feb and 31 Mar 2026.”

Checklist:
• Outside-view base: 1.3 %.  
• Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
  1. Two–soon three–carrier strike groups massed in CENTCOM.  
  2. Trump’s public 10–15-day ultimatum and June 2025 precedent.  
  3. Gang-of-Eight targeting briefing signals near-term decision.  
  4. Negotiations resume but issues gap remains huge.  
  5. Joint Chiefs ammunition/escalation warnings temper but don’t veto.  
• Blind-spot: sudden Iranian capitulation (or Khamenei death) producing a dramatic de-escalation before any strike.  Would cut probability below 10 %.  
• Status-quo bias check: absent new catalyst, inertia still favours no immediate war; hence probability stays well below 50 %.

Probability: 33%
