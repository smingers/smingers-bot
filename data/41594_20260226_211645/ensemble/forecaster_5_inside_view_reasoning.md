**Analyzing strike probabilities**

There have been past delays on expected strikes, like the one on February 1, which could happen again. With Trump’s political stance against war, upcoming elections may influence his decisions. There's a logistics factor of a 35-day timeframe, and expert assessments suggest a 59% probability of a strike. If I consider three scenarios: talks succeeding (40% chance), failing without a strike (30%), or failing with a strike (30%), I might conclude that overall, the probability sits around 30% to 35%. Let's also factor in negotiation challenges and the potential low success rate of talks.**Calculating strike probabilities**

I need to calculate the probability of a negotiation breakthrough by April 1, which seems to be at about 20%. If that breakthrough happens, the chance of a strike drops to around 5%. However, if negotiations fail (which is an 80% chance), I estimate a 40% strike probability within the following 35 days. So, multiplying those probabilities gives me about 32%. Adding the low strike chance from a breakthrough, I’ll estimate the overall probability at around 33%, potentially raising it to 38% considering upcoming logistics. Let’s get this analysis in order!
