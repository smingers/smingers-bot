Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order of publication)

1. Wikipedia: Iranian Revolution (1979) – High‐quality tertiary source; purely historical narrative, minimal bias risk; last substantive update 2026-01.  Contains no forward-looking claims, only background antagonism.

2. Wikipedia: Iran–US Relations – Same quality caveats as #1; long-timeframe historical sweep; no 2026 data in extract.

3. Wikipedia: Trump-era Iran-US relations (2017-21) – High-signal historical review of the most recent period of sharp escalation.  Opinion content is flagged; facts are well-sourced.

4. Wikipedia: JCPOA – Reliable chronology of the nuclear agreement’s life-cycle; factual, current to Oct-2025 termination.  Provides a clear structural driver (loss of diplomatic safety valve).

5. Wikipedia: Assassination of Qasem Soleimani – Fact-heavy, mainstream media-documented.

6. Wikipedia: US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites (Jun-2025) – First direct US attack on Iranian soil in decades; well referenced; important empirical data point.

7. CGTN timeline of Jan-2026 escalation – Chinese state media; factual chronology but potential anti-US framing.  Still, dates/troop movements are low-opinion, easy to cross-check.

8. Wikipedia: 2026 US military build-up in the Middle East – Early draft quality (citation gaps noted), but main troop‐movement facts echo independent media; treat cautiously.

9. House Democrats’ press release (Jeffries.house.gov, 2026-02-26) – Primary source for pending War-Powers vote; purely factual on Congressional intent.

10. TRT World article on same vote – Turkish public broadcaster; essentially an echo of #9; moderate anti-Trump framing.

11. Agent report on 35 yrs of US kinetic initiations – Transparent methodology, cites public chronologies; good quantitative anchor for base-rate work.

Overall: the only clearly opinion-heavy sources (#8, #10) are used only for descriptive facts (troop counts, pending legislation).  The rest are historical chronologies or primary documents.

(b) Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes

1. “Any US kinetic initiation against any state, per calendar quarter since 1989” (Agent report).  Pros: large N (140 quarters).  Cons: Over-broad; lumps together easy targets (e.g., Sudan) with peer-risk Iran.

2. “US kinetic initiation against medium-to-large regional powers since 1989” (examples: Iraq 1991/2003, Yugoslavia 1999, Libya 2011).  N≈4; low sample, but targets closer to Iran’s air-defence/nation-state capacity.

3. “US kinetic initiation specifically against Iran since 1979.”  N=1 (2025 bunker-buster raid).  Tiny sample, but obviously the most relevant.

I select class 2 as the main outside-view anchor: it is small enough to capture difficulty/risk yet large enough to yield a minimally meaningful frequency.

Counting: 4 initiations over 35 yrs → annual probability ≈ 11 % (4 ÷ 35).  Translating to a 35-day window (the remainder of this question) under a memory-less assumption:

P = 11 % * (35 days ÷ 365 days) ≈ 1.1 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Resolution window remaining: 35 days (26 Feb → 1 Apr 2026).  
• Historical pattern: US major strikes are seldom clustered this tightly (median gap between decision and execution in post-1990 examples is 4–12 weeks, but the *political* build-up is usually visible for months).  A 35-day horizon therefore captures only the tail-end of any escalation cycle already in motion.

(d) Justification of outside view

1. Base frequency for “US attacks a serious regional power” is ~11 % per *year* since 1989.  
2. No evidence that such events are seasonally bunched; scale occurrences roughly linearly to shorter windows.  
3. Although the presence of one attack on Iran inside the last calendar year (Jun-2025) hints at partial serial correlation, the historical record shows only one clear instance where the US struck the *same* target state twice inside 9 months (Syria 2017–2018); that suggests an only modest uplift, not an order-of-magnitude jump.  
4. Congress is actively moving to constrain presidential authority (#9/#10), another mild dampener on the unconditional probability in a short time window.  
5. Expert/market estimate quoted by Sentinel (59 % for strikes by 31 Mar 2026) is an *inside-view* assessment; for pure outside view we note only its existence and treat it as an informative but separate signal.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 1.1 % (linear scaling of class-2 annual rate).  
Adjustments:

+0.4 %  for the demonstrated *recent* propensity to strike Iran (serial-correlation uplift).  
–0.2 %  for impending Congressional War-Powers vote (historically such moves correlate with pauses or delays).  
Net ≈ 1.3 %.

Recognising base-rate uncertainty and low N, apply ±50 % confidence interval (0.65 %–1.95 %).  Adopt midpoint as point estimate.

Outside View Prediction:
1.3 %
