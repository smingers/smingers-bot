You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Question background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Additional fine-print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

Question metadata:
- Opened for forecasting: 2026-01-21T17:00:00Z
- Resolves: 2026-04-01T00:00:00Z
- Note: Unless the question title specifies otherwise, the Forecast Opening Date of 2026-01-21T17:00:00Z should be considered the start of the question's resolution window. Events before this date do not count toward resolution.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-26. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-26 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

## Summary: Iranian Revolution (Wikipedia)

**Note:** This article is a historical overview of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and does not contain direct information relevant to the question of a future U.S. attack on Iran. Its relevance is primarily as background context.

---

### Key Historical Facts

- **1953 CIA/MI6 Coup:** The U.S. and UK orchestrated the overthrow of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, reinstating Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch. American firms subsequently gained ~40% of Iranian oil profits, and the CIA helped fund and train SAVAK, Iran's secret police.

- **Shah's Reforms & Alienation:** The Shah's "White Revolution" (1963–1979) modernized Iran but alienated the clergy and traditional sectors. Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as a vocal critic and was exiled in 1964.

- **Revolution (1977–1979):** Anti-government protests began in October 1977, broadening into a mass uprising. The Shah left Iran on January 16, 1979; Khomeini returned February 1, 1979. By February 11, the monarchy collapsed. A referendum confirmed the Islamic Republic with 98% approval.

- **Post-Revolutionary Ideology:** The new government declared destruction of Israel a core objective, sought to undermine Sunni influence by supporting Shia political movements regionally, and adopted a strongly anti-Western posture — directly reversing the Shah-era alignment with the U.S.

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article establishes the **deep historical roots of U.S.-Iran antagonism**, rooted in the 1953 coup and the 1979 revolution. It explains why Iran's government views the U.S. with fundamental hostility, providing context for the current tensions described in the question's background.

## Summary: Iran–United States Relations (Wikipedia Article)

**Note:** This article appears to be a comprehensive Wikipedia entry on Iran-U.S. relations. The content was truncated before reaching the most recent events referenced in the question's background (2025-2026), so the summary reflects what was available.

---

### Historical Foundation
- Relations date to the mid-19th century, initially positive with the U.S. seen as a neutral "third force" against British and Russian colonial interests.
- The **1953 CIA/MI6-backed coup** overthrowing Prime Minister Mosaddegh is identified as a foundational grievance, reinstalling Shah Pahlavi and establishing SAVAK (secret police) with U.S. support. Many historians link this to the anti-American character of the 1979 revolution.

### Post-Revolution Hostility
- **No formal diplomatic relations since April 7, 1980**, following the 1979 revolution and hostage crisis. Pakistan and Switzerland serve as protecting powers respectively.
- In **2018**, Supreme Leader Khamenei formally banned direct talks with the U.S.

### Nuclear Dimension
- The U.S. *originally helped establish* Iran's nuclear program under Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" (1953), providing Iran's first reactor in 1967.
- The **2015 JCPOA** placed limits on Iran's nuclear program; sanctions were largely lifted in 2016.
- The **Trump administration withdrew** from the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed sanctions ("maximum pressure campaign"), after which Iran gradually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels.

### Public Opinion
- **2013 BBC poll:** 87% of Americans view Iran negatively (most unfavorable globally).
- **2019 IranPoll:** 86% of Iranians view the U.S. unfavorably (most unfavorable globally), though research suggests most Iranians hold positive views of the *American people*.
- **2018 Pew poll:** 39% of Americans consider limiting Iran's influence a top foreign policy priority.

### Key Structural Tensions Identified
- Iran cites U.S. support for Israel and attempts at "global dictatorship" as drivers of hostility.
- The U.S. cites the hostage crisis, human rights abuses, Iran's nuclear program, and support for proxy groups (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis).
- The article notes relations *improve* when interests overlap (e.g., countering Sunni militants/ISIS).

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration">
## Summary: Iran–U.S. Relations During the First Trump Administration (2017–2021)

### Overall Character of the Period
The first Trump administration marked a sharp break from Obama-era engagement, pursuing a **"maximum pressure" campaign** against Iran through extensive sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and ultimately military action. Despite escalating tensions, the period stopped short of full-scale war.

---

### Key Policy Actions by the U.S.

- **Travel Ban (January 2017):** Iranian citizens barred from entering the U.S.
- **JCPOA Withdrawal (May 2018):** Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and reimposed all previously lifted sanctions, eventually totaling **over 1,500 sanctions** targeting Iran's central bank, oil company, shipping lines, and foreign entities doing business with Iran.
- **IRGC Terrorist Designation (April 2019):** The U.S. designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a Foreign Terrorist Organization — the first time official armed units of a sovereign state were placed on such a list.
- **Coalition Building:** The administration strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Gulf states to counter Iranian regional influence, and cultivated relationships with Iranian opposition groups, including the MEK.

---

### Iranian Responses

- Threatened to resume **unrestricted uranium enrichment** and close the **Strait of Hormuz**
- Supreme Leader Khamenei **banned direct talks** with the U.S. (August 2018), declaring negotiations impossible with the Trump administration
- Iran's parliament designated U.S. forces and allies in the region as **terrorists** in response to the IRGC designation
- Iran launched a **military satellite** and was accused of **election interference** and **proxy attacks**

---

### Key Escalation Events (2019–2020)

- **2019 Tanker Attacks:** Oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf region; Iran was suspected of involvement
- **U.S. Drone Downing:** Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone; Trump **called off retaliatory airstrikes** at the last minute, opting instead for cyberattacks and additional sanctions
- **Saudi Oil Facility Strikes:** Iran was suspected of orchestrating strikes on Saudi Aramco facilities
- **K-1 Air Base Attack (December 2019):** A rocket attack killed a U.S. contractor, leading to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias and a subsequent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad
- **Assassination of Qasem Soleimani (January 3, 2020):** The U.S. killed Iran's top general in a drone strike in Iraq, prompting **Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq**. Iran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane during the crisis period.

---

### Diplomatic and Legal Dimensions

- The **International Court of Justice** provisionally ordered the U.S. to cancel sanctions (October 2018); the U.S. responded by **withdrawing from the 1955 Treaty of Amity** with Iran
- The **UN Security Council** rejected a U.S. proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran; only the Dominican Republic voted with the U.S.
- U.S. allies, including European nations, largely **refused to follow** the maximum pressure approach, leaving Washington diplomatically isolated on several fronts
- A **January 2019 U.S. intelligence assessment** concluded Iran was **not pursuing nuclear weapons**, contradicting some administration rhetoric

---

### Net Effect
The maximum pressure campaign severely damaged Iran's economy — crashing its currency, quadrupling inflation, and sharply reducing oil exports — but failed to bring Iran to the negotiating table. The period ended with relations deeply hostile and all major disputes unresolved.
</QuestionSource>

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">
## Summary: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)

### Overview
The JCPOA, finalized in Vienna on **July 14, 2015**, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany) and the EU, designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

### Key Provisions
- Iran agreed to reduce its low-enriched uranium stockpile by **97%** (from 10,000 kg to 300 kg) and cap enrichment at **3.67%** for 15 years
- Active centrifuges reduced to **6,104 units** (only 5,060 allowed to enrich), restricted to older IR-1 models at Natanz
- Key facilities at **Fordow, Natanz, and Arak** repurposed for civilian use
- Iran accepted more intrusive **IAEA monitoring**
- In exchange, Iran received relief from UN, EU, and U.S. nuclear-related sanctions (non-nuclear sanctions remained)

### Collapse of the Agreement
- The **U.S. withdrew in 2018**, reimposing sanctions under its "maximum pressure campaign," effectively nullifying the deal's economic provisions
- Following the **June 2025 Iran–Israel war**, Iran officially announced the **termination of the agreement on October 18, 2025**, after 10 years

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article confirms the JCPOA is now formally defunct, removing a key diplomatic framework that had previously constrained Iran's nuclear program and provided a channel for U.S.-Iran engagement.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani">
# Summary: Assassination of Qasem Soleimani

## The Strike

On **January 3, 2020**, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport that killed Iranian Major General **Qasem Soleimani**, commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. Also killed was **Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis**, deputy chairman of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces and commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah. Five other Iranians and Iraqis died in the strike.

## Justification and Legal Controversy

- The U.S. Pentagon justified the strike as necessary to stop an "imminent attack" and to protect U.S. personnel and deter further Iranian escalation.
- The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and other experts considered the strike a likely **violation of international law**.
- Iran called it **"state terrorism"**; Iraq called it a breach of bilateral security agreements and national sovereignty.

## Context and Background

- The strike occurred during the **2019–2022 Persian Gulf crisis**, following U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions.
- A **December 27, 2019 rocket attack** on K-1 Air Base killed an American contractor, triggering U.S. airstrikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah, which in turn prompted an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
- Both Presidents **Bush and Obama** had previously considered but rejected targeting Soleimani, fearing escalation to full-scale war.

## Soleimani's Significance

- Considered the **second most powerful person in Iran**, behind Supreme Leader Khamenei.
- Architect of Iran's foreign policy across Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Afghanistan.
- The Pentagon attributed "hundreds of American deaths" to Soleimani and his forces.

## Aftermath

- Iranian leaders vowed **"shattering revenge."**
- On **January 8, 2020**, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq — the first direct Iran-U.S. military engagement since 1988.
- That same day, the IRGC accidentally shot down **Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752**.
- The **Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution** to expel all foreign troops.
- Iran took its **fifth and final step** of reducing commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal.
- No further military exchanges occurred immediately after.

<Summary source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites">
## Summary: United States Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Sites (Operation Midnight Hammer)

### The Attack
On **June 22, 2025**, the U.S. Air Force and Navy struck three Iranian nuclear facilities — **Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan** — under the code name **Operation Midnight Hammer**. The attack used:
- **14 GBU-57A/B MOP "bunker buster" bombs** delivered by B-2 Spirit stealth bombers
- **Tomahawk cruise missiles** fired from a submarine
- U.S. F-35 and F-22 fighters entered Iranian airspace to draw surface-to-air missile fire (no launches detected)

This was the **first U.S. strike on Iranian territory since 1988**, and the first U.S. attack on an Iranian target since the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani.

### Context Within the Iran–Israel War
- The strikes were the **U.S.'s only offensive action** in the Iran–Israel war, which began June 13 with Israeli surprise strikes and ended with a **ceasefire on June 24, 2025**
- Israel reportedly lobbied heavily for U.S. involvement; Netanyahu and Ron Dermer spent approximately a week convincing Trump to participate, with the two leaders speaking almost daily
- Trump had initially planned to strike only Fordow; Netanyahu and Dermer persuaded him to include the other sites
- Trump's public announcement of a "two-week decision window" was reportedly **deliberate deception** to obscure the imminent attack

### Congressional and Public Opposition
- Senator Tim Kaine introduced a Senate resolution requiring Congressional authorization before military action against Iran — it was **defeated**
- Representatives Massie and Khanna introduced a parallel War Powers Resolution in the House
- Pre-strike polling showed **45% of Americans opposed** U.S. airstrikes on Iran, 30% were unsure, and only **25% supported** them
- A separate poll found **53% of Trump voters** opposed U.S. involvement in the Iran–Israel conflict
- Notable right-wing critics included Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson

### Iranian Preparations and Response
- Iran had **increased oil exports**, attempted to **cover Fordow's ventilation shafts with concrete**, and claimed nuclear material had been **evacuated** from Fordow and Natanz before the strike
- Iran responded by **attacking a U.S. base in Qatar**
- On **July 2**, Iran **suspended cooperation with the IAEA**

### Aftermath
- Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel the day after the strikes
- The effectiveness of the bunker busters against the deeply buried Fordow facility (80–90 meters underground) had been a subject of extended debate prior to the attack

## Summary: Iran–United States Relations (Wikipedia Article)

**Note:** This article appears to be a broad historical overview. The extracted content covers early history and does not appear to include sections on more recent developments (post-2018) that may be present in the full article.

---

### Overview
U.S.-Iran relations date to the mid-19th century, when the U.S. was viewed favorably by Iranians as a counterweight to British and Russian colonial influence. Relations remained broadly positive until the CIA-organized 1953 coup that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, ushering in a close U.S.-Shah alliance during the Cold War. The 1979 Islamic Revolution dramatically reversed this, and the two countries have had **no formal diplomatic relations since April 7, 1980**. Pakistan and Switzerland serve as protecting powers for Iran and the U.S., respectively.

### Key Structural Tensions
- Iran cites U.S. support for Israel and perceived global imperialism as drivers of hostility
- The U.S. points to the 1979–81 hostage crisis, human rights abuses, Iran's nuclear program, and its support for proxy groups (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis)
- In August 2018, Supreme Leader Khamenei **banned direct talks** with the U.S.
- The U.S. has maintained a **trade embargo since 1995**

### Nuclear Dimension
- The U.S. ironically *launched* Iran's nuclear program in 1953 under Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace"
- The 2015 JCPOA placed limits on Iran's nuclear activities; most sanctions were lifted in 2016
- The **Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018** and reimposed sanctions ("maximum pressure campaign"), after which Iran gradually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels

### Public Opinion (Polling Data)
- **2013 BBC poll:** Only 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively; 87% negatively — the most unfavorable view of Iran globally
- **2019 IranPoll survey:** 13% of Iranians view the U.S. favorably; 86% unfavorably — the most unfavorable view of the U.S. globally
- **2018 Pew poll:** 39% of Americans say limiting Iran's power should be a **top foreign policy priority**
- Research indicates most Iranians hold a *positive* view of the American *people*, though not the U.S. government

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
This article provides **historical and structural context** rather than direct evidence bearing on whether the U.S. will attack Iran before April 2026. It establishes the deep-rooted adversarial relationship, the nuclear program's trajectory, and the pattern of escalating U.S. pressure under Trump — all background factors relevant to assessing current risk.

## Summary: 2026 U.S. Military Buildup in the Middle East

**Note:** This article appears to be a Wikipedia-style entry that may be incomplete or partially sourced, as indicated by a "(source?)" notation within the text itself. Some claims may lack full verification.

### Core Deployment Facts
- Beginning late January 2026, the U.S. significantly expanded its military presence in the Middle East, deploying the **USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group** on January 26, 2026, alongside additional air, naval, and missile defense forces.
- This buildup was described as the **largest U.S. naval presence in/around the Middle East since the 2023 regional crisis began**.
- On **February 26, 2026**, Fox News reported the U.S. Fleet Headquarters in Bahrain was reduced to **fewer than 100 mission-critical personnel**, with all ships having left port — steps previously taken ahead of the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

### Iranian Responses
- Iran signaled **both diplomatic and military postures simultaneously**: Foreign Minister Araghchi was authorized to pursue "fair and equitable" talks; Ali Larijani was authorized to conduct negotiations; Iran offered to limit uranium enrichment to 20%.
- Simultaneously, Iran issued **strong military warnings**: IRGC commanders stated they had their "finger on the trigger," warned of "vengeful blows," and described a shift to an **offensive military doctrine**.
- On **February 5**, Iran deployed its Khorramshahr-4 long-range missile to an underground facility.
- On **February 16–17**, Iran conducted **IRGC naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz** and announced a **partial closure of the Strait** during live-fire exercises. Supreme Leader Khamenei rejected U.S. nuclear deal conditions and warned the U.S. Navy "could be sunk."
- Iran received **Russian military equipment** (MiG-29 jets, Mi-28NE gunships) and signed an order for Verba missile systems.
- State media reported Iran was **preparing graves at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra** for potential American casualties.

### U.S. Policy Posture
- Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** stated the U.S. was open to talks but required Iran to address its ballistic missile program and support for militant groups; he expressed **skepticism about a successful deal**.
- The U.S. imposed **fresh sanctions** in late January 2026 targeting Iranian officials and businessmen in response to the protest crackdown.
- Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** stated senior Iranian leaders were moving tens of millions of dollars abroad, characterizing this as the regime "abandoning ship."
- The **U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran** issued security alerts urging American citizens to leave the country in January and February 2026.

### Key Contextual Signal
The article explicitly notes that the reduction of personnel at Bahrain's Fleet Headquarters and the departure of ships from port **mirror steps taken ahead of the prior U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites**, suggesting these movements may be interpreted as precautionary pre-strike positioning.

## Summary: War Powers Resolution

**Overview**

The War Powers Resolution (1973) is a federal law designed to check the U.S. president's power to commit armed forces to conflict without Congressional consent. It requires the president to notify Congress within **48 hours** of committing forces to military action, and prohibits forces from remaining engaged for more than **60 days** (plus a 30-day withdrawal period) without either a Congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) or a formal declaration of war.

**Constitutional Basis**

War powers are constitutionally divided: Congress holds the power to declare war and raise/regulate armed forces (Article I, Section 8), while the president serves as Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2). The Resolution emerged from tensions over this "twilight zone" of concurrent authority.

**Historical Context**

- Passed in 1973 by a two-thirds Congressional majority, **overriding President Nixon's veto**, prompted by Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia during Vietnam.
- Has been invoked or tested in Lebanon (1982–83), the Gulf War (1991), Iraq (2002), and Libya (2011).
- President Obama's 2011 Libya operations were **contested** as potentially exceeding the 60-day limit without authorization.
- The 2017 U.S. Tomahawk missile strike on Syria's Shayrat airbase was noted by legal scholars as **potentially violating** the Resolution.

**Relevance to Forecasting Question**

The Resolution establishes the legal framework governing any potential U.S. military strike on Iran — the president could act unilaterally for up to 60 days before requiring Congressional authorization, though such action's legality would likely be contested.

## Summary: House Democrats to Force Vote on Khanna-Massie Iran War Powers Resolution

**Source:** Official website of Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (jeffries.house.gov)

**Key Facts:**

- House Democratic leadership — including Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark, Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, and ranking members of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, Armed Services, and China Competition committees — announced they will **force a floor vote on the bipartisan Khanna-Massie Iran War Powers Resolution** when Congress reconvenes.

- The resolution would **require the President to seek Congressional authorization before using military force against Iran**.

- Democratic leaders framed the move as both a constitutional and strategic concern, stating that military action against Iran "without a full understanding of all the attendant risks to our servicemembers and to escalation, is reckless" and would be **"unconstitutional without consultation with and authorization from Congress."**

- They acknowledged the Iranian regime's brutality, specifically referencing the **killing of thousands of protesters**, but argued this does not justify unilateral executive military action.

- The vote is described as an opportunity for **every House member to go on record** regarding support for military action against Iran without Congressional approval.

**Note:** The article also contains unrelated content about immigration rights resources for constituents, which is not relevant to the forecasting question.

## Summary: Democrats Move to Challenge Trump's Iran War Authority

**Key Development:** Rep. Gregory Meeks, alongside House Democratic leadership (Jeffries, Clark, Aguilar) and Reps. Himes, Smith, and Khanna, announced plans to force a House floor vote on the **Khanna-Massie War Powers Resolution** — a bipartisan measure requiring congressional authorization before Trump can launch military strikes on Iran.

**Core Argument of Supporters:** The Constitution grants Congress the authority to declare war, and any unilateral military action against Iran would be unconstitutional. Backers explicitly framed the resolution as *not* an endorsement of Iran, but a reaffirmation of congressional war powers. They also warned that military action without full understanding of risks to servicemembers and escalation potential would be "reckless."

**Opposition Within Congress:** Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mike Lawler (both previously opposed the resolution) argued it would undermine the U.S.'s ability to respond to Iranian threats.

**Broader Context Noted in Article:**
- A new round of **indirect U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations** took place in Geneva on the same day.
- There is a **significant U.S. military build-up** in the Persian Gulf region.
- Iran's **IRGC has conducted a series of recent military drills**.

The vote was set to be compelled when Congress reconvened the following week.

<Agent_report>
Query: Over the last 35 years, in how many discrete calendar quarters did the United States initiate kinetic military action against a sovereign state? List each operation with start date and target country, then compute the empirical quarterly base rate.
Below is an inventory of every instance since 1 January 1989 in which the United States opened kinetic hostilities against the regular armed forces, territory, or government personnel of an internationally-recognised sovereign state.  Each entry gives the moment the first shot was fired (local date), the quarter in which that date falls, and a short source note drawn from the material supplied.  Covert action, strikes on purely non-state actors, and operations conducted with the unambiguous invitation of the target government are excluded.

1. Operation Just Cause – Panama  
   • First strike: 20 Dec 1989 (Q4 1989)  
   • Target state: Republic of Panama  
   • Source: PBS “A Chronology of U.S. Military Interventions” (Pbs).

2. Operation Desert Storm – Iraq

Counting discrete quarters
Each listed operation marks the first quarter in which kinetic action was initiated.  Multiple actions in the same quarter (e.g., Afghanistan and Sudan in Q3 1998) count once.  Over the 35-year window 1 Jan 1989 – 31 Dec 2023 there are 140 calendar quarters.

Quarters in which an initiation occurred (chronological order):
• Q4 1989  
• Q1 1991  
• Q3 1994  
• Q3 1995  
• Q3 1998  
• Q1 1999  
• Q4 2001  
• Q1 2003  
• Q1 2011  
• Q3 2014  
• Q2 2017  
• Q2 2018  

Total = 12 distinct quarters.

Empirical quarterly base rate
Base rate = 12 initiation-quarters ÷ 140 total quarters  
           = 0.0857   ≈ 8.6 %

Interpretation
Historically, the United States has chosen to open kinetic hostilities against another sovereign state in roughly one out of every twelve calendar quarters since 1989.  Put differently, in any random three-month period the unconditional probability of a fresh U.S. attack on a state has been about 8–9 %.  Forecasters assessing the likelihood of U.S. action against Iran before 1 April 2026 may use this as a naive prior and then adjust for present-day situational factors.  The fact that only three initiation events have occurred in the last ten years (all Syria-related) suggests the recent tempo is somewhat lower than the long-run average, but the base-rate of 8.6 % provides a transparent empirical anchor.

Remaining gaps
• Very small, little-known cruise-missile or drone shots that were publicly acknowledged only years later could make the true count slightly higher.  
• The line between action against a state and action against non-state actors on its soil (e.g., Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia) is sometimes blurred; the list errs on the conservative side by including only clearly state-directed attacks.</Agent_report>
