QUESTION:
Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?

Type: binary

Background:
In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.

Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.

In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.

In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;

U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

[According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:

> Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

Resolution criteria:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Fine print:
To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.

If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">
## Summary: Iranian Revolution (Wikipedia)

**Note:** This article is a historical overview of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and does not contain direct information relevant to the question of a future U.S. attack on Iran. Its relevance is primarily as background context.

---

### Key Historical Facts

- **1953 CIA/MI6 Coup:** The U.S. and UK orchestrated the overthrow of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, reinstating Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch. American firms subsequently gained ~40% of Iranian oil profits, and the CIA helped fund and train SAVAK, Iran's secret police.

- **Shah's Reforms & Alienation:** The Shah's "White Revolution" (1963–1979) modernized Iran but alienated the clergy and traditional sectors. Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as a vocal critic and was exiled in 1964.

- **Revolution (1977–1979):** Anti-government protests began in October 1977, broadening into a mass uprising. The Shah left Iran on January 16, 1979; Khomeini returned February 1, 1979. By February 11, the monarchy collapsed. A referendum confirmed the Islamic Republic with 98% approval.

- **Post-Revolutionary Ideology:** The new government declared destruction of Israel a core objective, sought to undermine Sunni influence by supporting Shia political movements regionally, and adopted a strongly anti-Western posture — directly reversing the Shah-era alignment with the U.S.

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article establishes the **deep historical roots of U.S.-Iran antagonism**, rooted in the 1953 coup and the 1979 revolution. It explains why Iran's government views the U.S. with fundamental hostility, providing context for the current tensions described in the question's background.

## Summary: Iran–United States Relations (Wikipedia Article)

**Note:** This article appears to be a comprehensive Wikipedia entry on Iran-U.S. relations. The content was truncated before reaching the most recent events referenced in the question's background (2025-2026), so the summary reflects what was available.

---

### Historical Foundation
- Relations date to the mid-19th century, initially positive with the U.S. seen as a neutral "third force" against British and Russian colonial interests.
- The **1953 CIA/MI6-backed coup** overthrowing Prime Minister Mosaddegh is identified as a foundational grievance, reinstalling Shah Pahlavi and establishing SAVAK (secret police) with U.S. support. Many historians link this to the anti-American character of the 1979 revolution.

### Post-Revolution Hostility
- **No formal diplomatic relations since April 7, 1980**, following the 1979 revolution and hostage crisis. Pakistan and Switzerland serve as protecting powers respectively.
- In **2018**, Supreme Leader Khamenei formally banned direct talks with the U.S.

### Nuclear Dimension
- The U.S. *originally helped establish* Iran's nuclear program under Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" (1953), providing Iran's first reactor in 1967.
- The **2015 JCPOA** placed limits on Iran's nuclear program; sanctions were largely lifted in 2016.
- The **Trump administration withdrew** from the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed sanctions ("maximum pressure campaign"), after which Iran gradually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels.

### Public Opinion
- **2013 BBC poll:** 87% of Americans view Iran negatively (most unfavorable globally).
- **2019 IranPoll:** 86% of Iranians view the U.S. unfavorably (most unfavorable globally), though research suggests most Iranians hold positive views of the *American people*.
- **2018 Pew poll:** 39% of Americans consider limiting Iran's influence a top foreign policy priority.

### Key Structural Tensions Identified
- Iran cites U.S. support for Israel and attempts at "global dictatorship" as drivers of hostility.
- The U.S. cites the hostage crisis, human rights abuses, Iran's nuclear program, and support for proxy groups (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis).
- The article notes relations *improve* when interests overlap (e.g., countering Sunni militants/ISIS).

## Summary: Iran–U.S. Relations During the First Trump Administration (2017–2021)

### Overall Character of the Period
The first Trump administration marked a sharp break from Obama-era engagement, pursuing a **"maximum pressure" campaign** against Iran through extensive sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and ultimately military action. Despite escalating tensions, the period stopped short of full-scale war.

---

### Key Policy Actions by the U.S.

- **Travel Ban (January 2017):** Iranian citizens barred from entering the U.S.
- **JCPOA Withdrawal (May 2018):** Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and reimposed all previously lifted sanctions, eventually totaling **over 1,500 sanctions** targeting Iran's central bank, oil company, shipping lines, and foreign entities doing business with Iran.
- **IRGC Terrorist Designation (April 2019):** The U.S. designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a Foreign Terrorist Organization — the first time official armed units of a sovereign state were placed on such a list.
- **Coalition Building:** The administration strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Gulf states to counter Iranian regional influence, and cultivated relationships with Iranian opposition groups, including the MEK.

---

### Iranian Responses

- Threatened to resume **unrestricted uranium enrichment** and close the **Strait of Hormuz**
- Supreme Leader Khamenei **banned direct talks** with the U.S. (August 2018), declaring negotiations impossible with the Trump administration
- Iran's parliament designated U.S. forces and allies in the region as **terrorists** in response to the IRGC designation
- Iran launched a **military satellite** and was accused of **election interference** and **proxy attacks**

---

### Key Escalation Events (2019–2020)

- **2019 Tanker Attacks:** Oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf region; Iran was suspected of involvement
- **U.S. Drone Downing:** Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone; Trump **called off retaliatory airstrikes** at the last minute, opting instead for cyberattacks and additional sanctions
- **Saudi Oil Facility Strikes:** Iran was suspected of orchestrating strikes on Saudi Aramco facilities
- **K-1 Air Base Attack (December 2019):** A rocket attack killed a U.S. contractor, leading to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias and a subsequent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad
- **Assassination of Qasem Soleimani (January 3, 2020):** The U.S. killed Iran's top general in a drone strike in Iraq, prompting **Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq**. Iran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane during the crisis period.

---

### Diplomatic and Legal Dimensions

- The **International Court of Justice** provisionally ordered the U.S. to cancel sanctions (October 2018); the U.S. responded by **withdrawing from the 1955 Treaty of Amity** with Iran
- The **UN Security Council** rejected a U.S. proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran; only the Dominican Republic voted with the U.S.
- U.S. allies, including European nations, largely **refused to follow** the maximum pressure approach, leaving Washington diplomatically isolated on several fronts
- A **January 2019 U.S. intelligence assessment** concluded Iran was **not pursuing nuclear weapons**, contradicting some administration rhetoric

---

### Net Effect
The maximum pressure campaign severely damaged Iran's economy — crashing its currency, quadrupling inflation, and sharply reducing oil exports — but failed to bring Iran to the negotiating table. The period ended with relations deeply hostile and all major disputes unresolved.

<QuestionSource url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">
## Summary: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)

### Overview
The JCPOA, finalized in Vienna on **July 14, 2015**, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany) and the EU, designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

### Key Provisions
- Iran agreed to reduce its low-enriched uranium stockpile by **97%** (from 10,000 kg to 300 kg) and cap enrichment at **3.67%** for 15 years
- Active centrifuges reduced to **6,104 units** (only 5,060 allowed to enrich), restricted to older IR-1 models at Natanz
- Key facilities at **Fordow, Natanz, and Arak** repurposed for civilian use
- Iran accepted more intrusive **IAEA monitoring**
- In exchange, Iran received relief from UN, EU, and U.S. nuclear-related sanctions (non-nuclear sanctions remained)

### Collapse of the Agreement
- The **U.S. withdrew in 2018**, reimposing sanctions under its "maximum pressure campaign," effectively nullifying the deal's economic provisions
- Following the **June 2025 Iran–Israel war**, Iran officially announced the **termination of the agreement on October 18, 2025**, after 10 years

### Relevance to Forecasting Question
The article confirms the JCPOA is now formally defunct, removing a key diplomatic framework that had previously constrained Iran's nuclear program and provided a channel for U.S.-Iran engagement.

# Summary: Assassination of Qasem Soleimani

## The Strike

On **January 3, 2020**, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport that killed Iranian Major General **Qasem Soleimani**, commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. Also killed was **Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis**, deputy chairman of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces and commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah. Five other Iranians and Iraqis died in the strike.

## Justification and Legal Controversy

- The U.S. Pentagon justified the strike as necessary to stop an "imminent attack" and to protect U.S. personnel and deter further Iranian escalation.
- The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and other experts considered the strike a likely **violation of international law**.
- Iran called it **"state terrorism"**; Iraq called it a breach of bilateral security agreements and national sovereignty.

## Context and Background

- The strike occurred during the **2019–2022 Persian Gulf crisis**, following U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions.
- A **December 27, 2019 rocket attack** on K-1 Air Base killed an American contractor, triggering U.S. airstrikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah, which in turn prompted an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
- Both Presidents **Bush and Obama** had previously considered but rejected targeting Soleimani, fearing escalation to full-scale war.

## Soleimani's Significance

- Considered the **second most powerful person in Iran**, behind Supreme Leader Khamenei.
- Architect of Iran's foreign policy across Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Afghanistan.
- The Pentagon attributed "hundreds of American deaths" to Soleimani and his forces.

## Aftermath

- Iranian leaders vowed **"shattering revenge."**
- On **January 8, 2020**, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq — the first direct Iran-U.S. military engagement since 1988.
- That same day, the IRGC accidentally shot down **Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752**.
- The **Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution** to expel all foreign troops.
- Iran took its **fifth and final step** of reducing commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal.
- No further military exchanges occurred immediately after.

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the question and the pre-research context
2. Identify what information a skilled forecaster would need beyond what's already available
3. Generate 8 search queries to fill the remaining gaps

COVERAGE DIMENSIONS (ensure your queries collectively address these):
- Base rate: Historical frequency, distribution, or precedent for the outcome being forecast. How often has something like this happened before?
- Resolution mechanism: How exactly does this question resolve? What specific data source, metric, threshold, or event determines the outcome? What is the current state of that mechanism?
- Key drivers: The 1-3 most important causal factors that will determine the outcome. What moves this metric or makes this event more/less likely?
- Current state: Latest news, data points, or developments relevant to the question
- Contrarian check: Information that could support the less obvious outcome. What would make the unlikely scenario happen?

TYPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
- For binary "will X reach Y by Z" questions: Include a query for the historical base rate of X reaching Y in comparable timeframes. Also query the current trajectory/trend.
- For numeric questions: Query for recent values of the metric AND its primary upstream drivers. For financial metrics, query for upcoming scheduled events (data releases, FOMC meetings, earnings) before the resolution date.
- For multiple choice questions: Ensure at least one query is relevant to each substantive option. For catch-all/"other" options, query for the base rate of non-favored outcomes.

AVAILABLE TOOLS (only use tools listed here):
- Google: Keyword search. Write short queries (max 6 words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages. Best for reference pages, datasets, official reports.
- Google News: Keyword search over recent news articles. Max 6 words. Best for breaking news, recent events, and current developments.
- Agent: Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. Write a detailed, multi-part query of up to 3 sentences. Best for complex questions needing synthesis across sources, base rate computation, or multi-factor analysis. IMPORTANT: Use exactly one Agent query, tagged [HISTORICAL], for base rate or reference class research. Do not use Agent for current events.
- AskNews: Semantic (meaning-based) news search. Write a descriptive 1-2 sentence natural language query focusing on the underlying topic, key actors, and context. Include relevant scope: geography, industry, time period. Avoid ambiguous acronyms. Best for finding conceptually related coverage even without exact keyword matches.
- FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Use a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE", "CPIAUCSL") or a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate"). Returns historical data with computed statistics. Only use for economic/financial data.
