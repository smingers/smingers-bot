Ford Redeployed to Middle East Amid Iran Tensions\n**Source:** The Aviationist | **Date:** February 13, 2026 | **Author:** Kai Greet\n\n### Key Deployment Facts\n- The USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) has been ordered to deploy immediately to the Middle East, confirmed by Fox News' Jennifer Griffin on February 13, 2026.\n- This marks the carrier's **third Atlantic transit** of its current deployment, which began in late June 2025 \u2014 already its eighth month at sea.\n- The Ford had previously been redeployed to the Caribbean for Operations Southern Spear and Absolute Resolve before this new Middle East assignment.\n- The extended deployment will now likely last **10\u201311 months total**, pushing the carrier's homecoming to at least April or May 2026.\n- The Ford will join the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) already operating in the CENTCOM area of operations, creating a **two-carrier presence** in the region.\n\n### Strategic Context\n- The article notes it remains **\"unclear what action, if any, the U.S. intends to take against Iran.\"**\n- The article contrasts current naval posture with the 2003 Iraq War, when **six carriers** were simultaneously deployed; today's two-carrier deployment required extending an already near-complete voyage.\n- Additional EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft have been deployed to land bases in the region (specifically Muwaffaq Salti AB), described as particularly valuable assets for potential operations against Iran due to their SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) capabilities.\n\n### Readiness and Strain Concerns\n- Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Daryl Caudle expressed concern about extended deployments in January 2026, citing impacts on sailors' personal lives, maintenance contracts, and shipyard scheduling.\n- The Ford's planned 2026 refit will need to be pushed back, creating cascading effects on carrier availability cycles.\n- The U.S. Navy is currently operating with **10 active carriers**, following the USS Nimitz completing its final deployment and heading toward decommissioning.\n- The USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was identified as a potential follow-on deployment but had not yet completed necessary combat readiness exercises.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/us-military-deployment-gulf-iran-strikes/33675133.html\">\n## Summary: 'Robust' US Military Deployment To Gulf Ahead Of Possible Iran Strikes\n**Source:** RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty | **Date:** February 11, 2026\n\n### Key Facts & Military Deployment Details\n\n- The US is conducting **one of its largest-ever military buildups in the Persian Gulf**, described as \"robust\" by experts, featuring naval, defensive air defense, and offensive air components.\n- The buildup is **led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln** and its carrier strike group, supported by multi-role warships including USS Delbert D. Black, USS Mitscher, and USS McFaul \u2014 all capable of launching missile strikes.\n- **One of the strike group's jets shot down an Iranian drone** the week prior to publication.\n- On **February 10, Trump indicated he may dispatch a second aircraft carrier strike group** to the region if talks with Iran fail.\n- The region now hosts an estimated **40,000 US troops**, with CENTCOM's forward headquarters at Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.\n- The US has recently deployed additional **THAAD and Patriot missile defense batteries** to Gulf Arab nations and Jordan.\n- Experts note **B-2 strategic bombers** (as used in June 2025) could again be deployed from the US mainland or Diego Garcia.\n\n### Expert Opinions\n\n- **Amin Tarzi (Marine Corps War College):** The buildup serves as \"a point of pressure applied by the United States on Iran to come to a negotiated agreement,\" and is qualitatively significant despite being smaller in troop numbers than past Gulf deployments, due to advances in military capability.\n- **David Des Roches (Thayer Marshall Institute):** The current force is \"much smaller\" but \"much easier to scale up and scale down,\" reflecting a nimbler, more modern posture.\n- **Brian Carter (American Enterprise Institute/Critical Threats Project):** The buildup signals the US is \"very serious,\" and highlights an important asymmetry \u2014 US defensive capabilities are strong while Iran's are comparatively weak, a factor relevant to any future strikes.\n\n### Context\n\n- Trump reiterated in **late January** that Iran would face a \"far worse\" attack than the June 2025 strikes if it fails to reach a nuclear deal, and claimed a **\"massive armada\"** was heading toward Iran.\n- Iranian security forces **killed thousands of protesters** in January 2026, following protests triggered by the collapse of the Iranian currency in late December 2025.\n- A **diplomatic deal remains possible** and could still avert military confrontation, according to the article.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.twz.com/news-features/second-carrier-strike-group-ordered-to-spin-up-for-deployment-to-middle-east-report\">\n## Summary: Second Carrier Strike Group Ordered to Prepare for Middle East Deployment\n**Source:** The War Zone | **Date:** February 11, 2026 | **Author:** Howard Altman\n\n### Key Developments\n\n**Second Carrier Strike Group (CSG) Preparation:**\n- President Trump has reportedly ordered a second aircraft carrier strike group to prepare for a potential Middle East deployment, according to *The Wall Street Journal*, citing anonymous officials.\n- A deployment order \"could be issued in a matter of hours,\" per the Journal, though no order has yet been given and plans remain subject to change.\n- The USS George H.W. Bush, completing training exercises off Virginia's coast, is the likely candidate. Even if ordered immediately, it would likely not arrive until **mid-March** at the earliest.\n- The second CSG would join the **USS Abraham Lincoln CSG** already in the region.\n\n### Current Military Posture in the Region\n- Land-based assets include F-15E Strike Eagles, A-10s, E/A-18G Growlers, and F-35A fighters from Vermont Air National Guard (VANG) \u2014 the latter apparently en route to **Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan**.\n- At least **nine additional warships**, including Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, and **30,000+ troops** are positioned across Middle Eastern bases. Submarines are present but undisclosed.\n- The War Zone notes current tactical airpower is **insufficient for a major sustained operation**; a second CSG would provide significant reinforcement.\n\n### Trump's Stated Position (Post-Netanyahu Meeting)\n- Following a three-hour White House meeting with Israeli PM Netanyahu, Trump posted on Truth Social that he is **still pursuing a negotiated settlement** with Iran as a preference, but warned of military action if diplomacy fails.\n- Trump referenced the June attack on Iran's nuclear facilities (\"Midnight Hammer\") as a warning, stating: *\"Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.\"*\n- Netanyahu sought assurances that any deal would address Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions and missile stockpile.\n\n### Analytical Note from The War Zone\n- The carrier deployment speculation, even absent a final decision, serves as an **additional pressure tool** on Iran during ongoing negotiations.\n</Summary>\n\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Trump administration deliberates Iran strike February 2026\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Thune: Iran strikes should result in regime change**\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) stated on February 26, 2026, that any U.S. military strikes against Iran should aim for regime change to achieve transformative change in a country long considered hostile to the United States and its allies, particularly Israel. Thune emphasized that if action is taken, it must result in new leadership, saying, 'If you're going to take some sort of action, I think you want to achieve a result that actually brings about the transformational change that I think we want in the region.' His comments come amid heightened expectations that President Trump may order strikes against Iran in the coming days or weeks if negotiations led by special envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff fail to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has deployed destroyers and aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, and Mediterranean Sea in preparation for potential military action. Thune noted that while the president has not yet made a decision, contingency planning is underway, with national security interests\u2014including preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear capability and countering regional threats\u2014being prioritized. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed this sentiment, telling CNBC that Iran\u2019s regime is 'teetering' after a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters, and that the next six months could see the fall of Iran\u2019s, Venezuela\u2019s, and Cuba\u2019s regimes, leading to governments more aligned with the U.S.\u2014a shift Cruz described as 'the biggest geopolitical shift since the fall of the Berlin Wall.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 04:03 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5756532-trump-iran-strikes-regime-change/)\n\n**Washington Wants Israel To Strike Iran First**\nAdvisers to U.S. President Donald Trump believe it would be politically advantageous for Israel to conduct a military strike on Iran before the United States intervenes, according to two knowledgeable sources cited by Politico. White House officials reportedly stated that the 'political situation is budding' and emphasized that Israel's Iron Dome defense system does not provide full protection, increasing the risk of American casualties and significant political fallout. While Israel may prefer to act first, the most likely scenario remains a joint U.S.-Israeli operation. White House Deputy Press Secretary Anne Kelly cautioned against media speculation, stating, 'Only President Trump knows what he can do and what he can't do.' This comes amid heightened tensions, including new U.S. visa restrictions on Iranian officials following a violent crackdown on nationwide protests. On February 20, 2026, Trump publicly indicated he would consider limited strikes on Iran, citing Iran\u2019s imminent development of missiles capable of reaching the U.S., though he also expressed a preference for diplomacy. A U.S.-Iranian delegation meeting is scheduled for February 26, 2026, in Geneva to discuss Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 10:05 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f 97](https://charter97.org/en/news/2026/2/26/675004/)\n\n**'New York Times': Washington Counting on Limited Strikes Against Iran to Pressure It in Nuclear Negotiations**\nAccording to The New York Times, U.S. officials are skeptical about Iran's willingness to reach a nuclear deal, with limited strikes aimed at pressuring Iranian leaders to make concessions. While the primary goal of a potential strike is to damage Iran's nuclear facilities, it also carries significant symbolic weight. Several U.S. administration representatives stated that a strike would allow former President Donald Trump to declare victory over a long-standing adversary. The newspaper noted that senior officials hope such a strike could compel Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program, though some current and former officials remain doubtful about the strategy's effectiveness. Trump announced on February 20, 2026, that he was considering limited strikes against Iran. In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei warned on Monday, February 24, 2026, that any U.S. strike\u2014no matter how limited\u2014would be considered an aggressive act by Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 08:51 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1761481-%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%83-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%B2-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%BA%D8%B7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**Trump Allies: Iran Strike 'Inevitable' Regardless of Today's Negotiation Results**\nAccording to U.S. Senator Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the U.S. administration has provided Congress with clear evidence that Iran has resumed efforts to revive its nuclear program, which the U.S. considers a sufficient justification for military intervention. The Washington Post reports that former President Donald Trump has several military options available, including a limited operation to force Iran to accept U.S. terms, or a broader operation aimed at regime change if Tehran rejects a deal\u2014potentially including direct strikes on Iranian leadership. Senior Trump advisers reportedly favor Israel launching an initial air strike on Iran first, followed by monitoring Tehran\u2019s response, thereby allowing the U.S. to intervene in retaliation while securing public support for the military action. Close associates of Trump assert that a strike on Iran is 'inevitable,' regardless of the outcome of negotiations scheduled for Thursday, February 26, 2026.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 26, 2026 03:32 AM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4208406)\n\n**AI Models Predict U.S. Strike on Iran: Dates Range from February 28 to March 8, 2026**\nIn response to escalating regional tensions, four major artificial intelligence platforms\u2014Claude, Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT\u2014were asked to predict the exact date of a potential U.S. military strike on Iran. The question was posed amid real-world developments, including former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a 10- to 15-day deadline for Iran to reach a deal, and a significant U.S. military buildup in the region. The White House reaffirmed diplomacy as the primary option but emphasized readiness to use force, with the Geneva talks on Thursday considered a decisive moment. Claude initially refused to specify a date, warning predictions would be fabricated, but later suggested two probable dates: Saturday, March 7, or Sunday, March 8, 2026, with a 40\u201345% probability for a limited strike targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear and military infrastructure. Gemini provided a precise timeframe: between the evening of March 4 and the evening of March 6, 2026, with a high likelihood of a nighttime attack to maximize stealth from B-2 Spirit bombers and minimize detection of Tomahawk missiles. Grok initially predicted a strike on February 28, 2026, contingent on the failure of Geneva talks, and repeated the same date with caveats about possible diplomatic breakthroughs or proxy escalations. ChatGPT first suggested Sunday, March 1, 2026 (Israel time), but after deeper analysis revised its prediction to Tuesday, March 3, 2026 (U.S. time), noting that the event would be visible in Israel on the evening of Tuesday or early Wednesday, March 4, citing Trump\u2019s 10\u201315 day window from February 19 and the anticipated visit of Marco Rubio to Israel on February 28.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 12:43 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1761227-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A3%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-4-%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%AC-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3/)\n\n**Trump's Iran calculus: A final diplomatic gamble or a countdown to conflict? - analysis**\nOn February 24, 2026, US President Donald Trump delivered the longest State of the Union address in history\u2014107 minutes\u2014during which he outlined three primary justifications for a potential war with Iran: the killing of 32,000 protesters, the development of missiles capable of reaching the United States, and Iran\u2019s refusal to commit to not developing nuclear weapons. These claims align with Israel\u2019s strategic concerns regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, missile capabilities, and proxy forces. However, shortly before the speech, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi publicly stated on X/Twitter that Iran would not develop nuclear weapons, contradicting Trump\u2019s assertion. This discrepancy suggests Trump may be using his speech to signal that a clear, high-level commitment from Iran\u2014potentially even from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2014could prevent war and be framed as a personal diplomatic triumph. Despite this opening, the Trump administration has been preparing for military action, including requesting a 'lightning strike' plan that could end in a single night, though the Pentagon has struggled to deliver such a strategy. Senior military officials warn that any strike, no matter how swift, risks escalation and may not achieve decisive results, potentially even making Iran appear victorious. Arab diplomats caution that the US is 'climbing a very tall tree' and that Iran is unlikely to concede, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict. While the administration\u2019s recent actions suggest a leaning toward war, Trump may still be offering one final diplomatic opportunity. The true intent\u2014whether a final appeal or a prelude to conflict\u2014may be revealed within days.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 09:15 AM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-887889)\n\n**Trump: Iran's Missiles Can Strike the U.S.; Tehran Denounces 'Major Lies' in Response**\nU.S. President Donald Trump, in his State of the Union address on February 25, 2026, stated that all options remain open regarding Iran, accusing Iran of restarting its nuclear program and developing missiles capable of reaching the United States. He claimed Iran is responsible for attacks that killed American soldiers and civilians, and criticized Iran for not offering the 'secret words' \u2014 'we will never have a nuclear weapon' \u2014 despite previous warnings against rebuilding its weapons programs. Trump asserted that Iran is actively pursuing 'evil ambitions' and has already begun anew. In response, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei labeled the U.S. and Israeli claims about Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, as well as casualty figures from recent unrest, as a 'major campaign of lies and deception' against the Iranian people. He cited Joseph Goebbels\u2019 propaganda tactic of repeating falsehoods until they seem true, accusing the U.S. government and its allies, particularly the Israeli regime, of using this method to spread 'deliberate falsehoods' and demonize Iran. Baghaei emphasized that allegations regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program, its intercontinental ballistic missile, and the number of casualties from January disturbances are all part of a 'series of major lies' and warned against being deceived by such disinformation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 07:14 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642 \u0623\u0648\u0646\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0646](https://www.echoroukonline.com/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83)\n\n**US strikes 'obliterated' Iran nuclear programme, says Donald Trump**\nUS President Donald Trump claimed during his State of the Union Address on February 25, 2026, that US airstrikes\u2014specifically 'Operation Midnight Hammer'\u2014had 'obliterated' Iran's nuclear weapons program. He reiterated his preference for diplomacy but emphasized that Iran must commit to never developing nuclear weapons, warning that Iran is advancing missile capabilities that could reach the United States and Europe. Trump stated that Iran has not yet said the 'secret words': 'We will never have a nuclear weapon,' and insisted he would never allow Iran\u2014a nation he labeled the 'world's number one sponsor of terror'\u2014to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran denies nuclear weapons ambitions, asserting its program is for civilian use; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated Iran would never develop a nuclear weapon and confirmed that a proposal to resolve the issue is being prepared for discussion in Geneva. The next round of Iran-US talks is scheduled for February 26, 2026, in Geneva, Switzerland, with Oman's foreign minister confirming a 'positive push' to finalize a deal. US envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that Iran could be 'a week away' from producing industrial-grade bomb-making material, citing uranium enrichment up to 60%. Trump's remarks were framed within his 'peace through strength' doctrine, which advocates deterring adversaries through military dominance while pursuing negotiations from a position of strength.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2026 05:01 AM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://newsable.asianetnews.com/world/us-strikes-obliterated-iran-nuclear-programme-says-donald-trump-articleshow-fghdnwb)\n\n**DNC Chair: We Should 'Do Something' with Iran, Venezuela, But Not What Trump's Doing**\nDNC Chair Ken Martin stated on CNN's 'The Lead' that Democrats agree the U.S. should respond to the oppressive actions of the Iranian regime and the former regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, but emphasized that the current administration's approach\u2014characterized as 'callous' and 'unstrategic'\u2014is dangerous and shortsighted. Martin criticized President Trump's military actions, including the June 2025 strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and the operation to remove Maduro from power, arguing that they lack consultation with congressional leaders and strategic clarity. He affirmed that while Democrats support taking action against these regimes, the method must be calculated, consider risks, and involve broader strategic planning.

This occurred shortly after President Donald Trump claimed at a pre-State of the Union lunch that Iran 'desperately wants a deal' but refuses to say 'we won't build nuclear weapons.' The briefing came amid escalating tensions, with Trump dispatching special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to negotiate with Iran, following their prior success in brokering a Gaza peace deal. CIA Director Ratcliffe and Rubio emphasized the urgency, with Witkoff stating Iran was 'probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material.' Trump had previously threatened to bomb Iran in January 2026 after Tehran executed anti-regime protesters, though he paused the strike after Iran claimed to cancel 800 executions. The administration has not secured congressional authorization for military action, relying on the 90-day limit under the War Powers Resolution of 1973\u2014though Trump dismissed the law as 'fake and unconstitutional,' noting past presidents have ignored it. Polls show only 18% of Americans support a U.S. attack on Iran, with 70% opposing it. Trump has deployed two U.S. aircraft carrier groups to the region and previously authorized a single massive airstrike on three Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, ending a 12-day conflict initiated by Israeli strikes. Other expected attendees at the briefing included Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), and Representatives Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.).

He confirmed Iran's intent to resume talks with the U.S. in Geneva with the goal of achieving a 'fair and equitable agreement as soon as possible.' This comes ahead of expected negotiations between the two sides. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former President Donald Trump, sent a joint message urging President Trump not to launch military strikes against Iran, advocating instead for diplomatic efforts. According to Axios, both officials share concerns similar to those of senior military leaders about the risks of war. General Dan Coker, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has issued warnings to the Trump administration, citing insufficient ammunition, lack of allied support, and potential high casualties for U.S. and allied forces, as well as strain on air defenses and military exhaustion. These warnings were reported to have been raised during National Security Council meetings, with additional concerns echoed by other Pentagon officials. Despite this, President Trump dismissed media reports as 'deliberately false,' asserting that the U.S. could defeat Iran 'easily' in any conflict. In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that General Coker 'does not oppose war' but rather supports victory, stating that Coker 'knows only one thing: victory' and would carry out any military order. Trump also denied that Coker advised against strikes or limited attacks, saying he had read media reports suggesting such advice.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 06:53 PM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/world/1854973-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84)\n\n**Trump Warns Iran: No Deal Means 'Very Bad Day' for the Country and Its People**\nU.S. President Donald Trump warned on Monday, February 24, 2026, that if a deal with Iran is not reached, 'it will be a very bad day for Iran and its people,' reiterating that media reports about a potential war with Iran are 'fake news.' According to the article, General Dan Caine, the highest-ranking U.S. military official, reportedly cautioned in internal White House discussions that a military strike on Iran could lead to prolonged conflict and casualties in the Middle East, contrasting with his earlier support for operations in Venezuela. Trump denied reports that Caine opposed war, stating in Truth Social that Caine, like everyone else, prefers to avoid war but believes a military confrontation with Iran would be an easy victory. Trump emphasized that Caine knows Iran well and led Operation Midnight Hammer, a prior U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. He claimed Caine is focused only on how to win, not on avoiding action or limited strikes, and would lead if ordered. Trump reiterated that all media coverage of a potential war with Iran has been deliberately misrepresented. He stated he would prefer to reach a deal but warned that failure to do so would be disastrous for Iran and its people. Meanwhile, U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were scheduled to travel to Geneva on Thursday for nuclear program talks. The White House acknowledged only minor progress after the first round of talks, with a major sticking point being the U.S. demand that Iran completely halt uranium enrichment\u2014a condition Iran has resisted. The talks occur amid U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, the largest since the Iraq War, and Trump\u2019s announcement that he would decide within 10\u201315 days whether to use force. The State Department announced partial evacuation of embassy staff in Lebanon on Monday, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to visit Israel on Friday.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 24, 2026 06:21 AM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Trump-Jesli-nie-zawrzemy-porozumienia-to-bedzie-bardzo-zly-dzien-dla-Iranu-9088016.html)\n\n**President Donald Trump denies top U.S. officer warned of Iran strike risks**\nOn February 23, 2026, President Donald Trump denied reports that General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had warned of significant risks associated with a potential military strike against Iran, calling the claims '100% incorrect.' Trump asserted that Caine believes the U.S. could easily defeat Iran in any conflict and would lead military operations if ordered. This contradicts reports from The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Axios, which cited Caine\u2019s concerns about munition shortages, lack of allied support, potential U.S. and allied casualties, depletion of U.S. air defenses, and the risk of becoming entangled in a prolonged war. Trump also accused media outlets of deliberately spreading false information. He emphasized that he alone makes the final decision, stating that while he prefers a diplomatic deal, failure to reach one would result in a 'very bad day' for Iran. The U.S. has deployed a significant military presence in the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers and numerous warplanes, following Trump\u2019s prior strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.

Trump claimed the reports were false and misleading, stating that Caine, whom he described as highly knowledgeable about Iran, had never opposed striking Iran and was instead the architect of a 2025 plan to bomb Iran\u2019s three nuclear facilities (code-named 'Midnight Hammer'). According to Trump, Caine believed a military campaign against Iran would be a 'quick victory' and that he would lead it if ordered. Media outlets including Axios, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The Hill reported that Caine had expressed caution about large-scale military action due to risks of high U.S. casualties, low ammunition stockpiles, and ongoing commitments to Ukraine and Israel. All reports cited anonymous sources and did not state that Caine opposed war with Iran. Trump reiterated that he is the final decision-maker, prefers diplomacy, and would only resort to force if negotiations fail. He warned that failure to reach a deal would result in a 'very bad day' for Iran, though he emphasized the Iranian people are 'great and kind' and should not suffer. The U.S. and Iran continue nuclear talks, with envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner scheduled to meet Iranian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.

On February 23, 2026, Trump posted on Truth Social, calling the reports 'fake news' and asserting, 'The decision is mine.' He stated that Milley, like everyone else, does not want war, but believes a military strike against Iran would be a 'quick victory' if ordered. According to the Washington Post, Milley raised concerns during a White House meeting about the strain on U.S. ammunition stockpiles from supporting Israel and Ukraine, and warned that regional allies may not allow their bases to be used for attacks on Iran. Axios reported that Milley cautioned the operation could lead to a prolonged conflict. Despite Milley's cautious stance, Trump insisted Milley never opposed an attack or discussed a 'limited strike,' claiming Milley only knows 'how to win' and will lead decisively if ordered. Trump reiterated that all previous reporting on a potential Iran war was deliberately distorted, reaffirming, 'The final decision is mine. I believe reaching an agreement is far better than not. But if we fail to agree, that country (Iran) will have a very bad day.' This follows Trump's earlier warning on February 19, 2026, that 'bad things will happen' if nuclear talks fail, with a new round scheduled for February 26 in Geneva. The Joint Chiefs of Staff clarified that the Chairman provides military options and associated risks to civilian leaders, but these are classified and not publicly disclosed.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 11:07 PM\nSource:[\uad6d\ubbfc\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp)\n\n**Trump Says Military Decision on Iran Is His Alone and Prefers Diplomacy**\nU.S. President Donald Trump stated on February 23, 2026, in a post on Truth Social that the final decision on a potential military strike against Iran rests exclusively with him.

Trump dismissed reports of disagreement between himself and General Daniel Caine\u2014known as 'Razin'\u2014as '100% incorrect,' accusing the media of spreading 'fake news' without sources. He claimed Caine, while favoring avoidance of conflict, believes any military operation would be 'easily won' and that Caine 'knows how to win' and would lead any such action.

The meeting is seen as a final diplomatic effort to avoid military conflict amid escalating tensions. The U.S. has recently increased its military presence in the Middle East, and President Trump has publicly stated he is considering 'limited strikes' against Iran to force Tehran to resolve its long-standing nuclear program dispute. According to sources cited by The New York Times, Trump has signaled to his advisors that if diplomacy or initial, targeted military actions fail to compel Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, the U.S. may launch larger-scale attacks in the coming months\u2014potentially aiming at regime change. The potential targets include the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, nuclear facilities, and ballistic missile programs. Trump has not made a final decision but leans toward launching a preliminary strike in the coming days to send a strong signal. Even within the Trump administration, some officials question whether airstrikes alone can achieve strategic objectives. On the other hand, Iran has issued a more conciliatory tone: Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi stated that Tehran is willing to make further concessions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of U.S. sanctions and international recognition of its limited uranium enrichment for medical purposes. He also noted that the second round of indirect talks in Geneva last week had already established consensus on negotiation principles. Behind the scenes, both sides are exploring a potential compromise allowing Iran to conduct minimal uranium enrichment exclusively for medical research and treatment, as a possible path to avoid military conflict.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2026 09:40 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20260223-%E7%BE%8E%E6%96%B9%E8%AF%81%E5%AE%9E%E7%BE%8E%E4%BC%8A26%E6%97%A5%E5%86%8D%E6%AC%A1%E4%BC%9A%E8%B0%88-%E7%BA%BD%E6%97%B6-%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E6%8B%9F%E5%88%86%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E6%96%BD%E5%8E%8B-%E4%B8%8D%E6%8E%92%E9%99%A4%E6%89%A9%E5%A4%A7%E5%86%9B%E4%BA%8B%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8)\n\n**NY Times: Trump weighing initial limited Iran strike, but going for regime change if no results**\nAccording to The New York Times, U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike on Iran in the near term to pressure Tehran into meeting his nuclear demands.

The plan involves first conducting targeted strikes on Iran's nuclear and military facilities, followed by a broader military operation aimed at regime change if the initial strikes prove ineffective. Internal U.S. government sources indicated uncertainty about whether air strikes alone could achieve the desired objectives. The success of the proposed strategy remains uncertain, as it is unclear whether Iran would accept the proposal. Nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran, mediated by Oman, are ongoing, with the third round scheduled for February 26, 2026, in Geneva, Switzerland.

The report cites conversations with 'multiple American officials' who question the effectiveness of military action. As an alternative, a new proposal is being considered: allowing Iran a very limited nuclear enrichment program solely for medical research and treatments. This potential diplomatic exit strategy comes amid ongoing negotiations, with Iranian officials stating they are finalizing a 'draft plan' to submit to Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy, within days. The report notes that Trump had not yet made a final decision on a strike as of February 23, 2026.

This move is part of a major U.S. military buildup in the region, ordered by President Donald Trump, aimed at pressuring Iran to negotiate on its nuclear program. The 'armada' includes the Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which has been in the Arabian Sea since January. Over an eight-hour period on February 20, CBS News identified over 50 U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft\u2014including refueling, transport, surveillance, and strike aircraft like F-15, F-22, and F-35s\u2014flying from U.S. bases to the UK, continental Europe, and the Middle East. Aircraft were observed landing at U.K. bases and transiting near the Jordan-Saudi Arabia border, with some disappearing from radar. Bases in the Azores and Crete, previously used during Operation Midnight Hammer (June 2025), are now being utilized again, fueling speculation of imminent military action. Top national security officials have informed Trump that the U.S. military is prepared for potential strikes as soon as Saturday, though no final decision has been made. Trump stated on February 20: 'If they join us, that'll be great. If they don't join us, that'll be great, too. But it'll be a very different path... bad things will happen if it doesn't.'

This approach, observed during five rounds of talks in Muscat and Rome in spring 2025, included simultaneous headlines confirming negotiations, warning of war, and rejecting Trump\u2019s conditions\u2014all from state-aligned outlets like Tasnim and Kayhan. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acted under the supreme leader\u2019s command, and the IRGC unveiled the Khorramshahr-4 missile during the same period, mirroring Trump\u2019s June 2025 tactic of combining diplomacy with military threats. The author contends that unlike past contradictions driven by internal factionalism, today\u2019s signals are coordinated and serve a unified objective: maintaining strategic ambiguity to prevent a U.S. strike while preserving Iran\u2019s nuclear and asymmetric capabilities. The analysis notes three indicators of design: no leaks from the establishment, precise timing of contradictory messages, and convergence toward a single outcome\u2014preserving regime survival. Both Trump and Iran\u2019s leadership are locked in a stalemate: Trump cannot start a war due to his 'no more wars' political identity, and Khamenei cannot sign a real deal as it would dismantle Iran\u2019s deterrent, missile advantage, and proxy network. The author predicts a symbolic 'framework agreement' will be signed\u2014lowered enrichment, a token stockpile transfer, and weak monitoring\u2014allowing both sides to claim victory. However, the infrastructure will quietly rebuild. The author warns that unless the deal undermines the regime\u2019s internal structure, it will fail to produce lasting change. The analysis concludes with a caveat: Trump\u2019s unpredictable instincts may still disrupt the equilibrium, as demonstrated by his rapid shift from war threats to peace overtures in June 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 01:00 PM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-886455)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Secretary Admits Economic Sabotage Against Iran, Sparking Protests and Diplomatic Talks**\nScott Bessent, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, testified before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on February 5, 2026, confirming that the Trump administration orchestrated a deliberate shortage of U.S. dollars in Iran to trigger economic collapse and mass protests. He stated that the Treasury Department implemented a 'maximum pressure' campaign, which led to the collapse of Iran's economy in December 2025, including a major bank failure, central bank intervention, and soaring inflation. Bessent boasted that the resulting dollar scarcity prevented Iran from importing goods or weapons, calling it 'how you direct an economy.' He referenced prior warnings from March 2025 and a January 2026 speech at the World Economic Forum, drawing parallels to U.S. economic sabotage in Chile under Nixon. The article claims that the economic collapse coincided with a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and alleges that mercenaries funded by the CIA and Mossad were deployed to incite chaos\u2014though these claims were reportedly thwarted by Iranian resilience, Starlink blackouts, and public outrage over attacks on mosques. The article draws historical parallels to the 1953 Operation Ajax, which overthrew Iran\u2019s Prime Minister Mossadegh.

Iran insisted on maintaining leverage, refusing to discuss ballistic missiles or its resistance front against Israel. The talks ended 'for now' without details, but a follow-up session is scheduled.

The Israeli delegation, led by Major General Eyal Zamir and including Air Force Commander General Omer Tishler and Chief of Planning General Hadar Silberman, met with U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Coker. The Israeli sources stated that the talks aimed to clarify the implications of either launching a military strike on Iran or refraining from one, while also sharing updated intelligence. The five demands reportedly made by Trump include: (1) Iran must halt all nuclear enrichment activities; (2) dismantle all ballistic missile programs; (3) cease support for proxy groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis; (4) withdraw from regional conflicts; and (5) compensate for past attacks on U.S. and allied interests. Israeli sources believe Iran will not engage in negotiations on these demands, either jointly or individually, and view the current phase as one of 'deliberate delay'. The U.S. is reportedly considering two options: either proceed with military confrontation or retreat, which could reduce the threat to mere 'verbal escalation'. There is growing speculation about the reasons for the delay\u2014whether due to the need to mobilize additional troops or to prepare diplomatic cover for a future military move. Israeli sources warn that a last-minute U.S. retreat could lead to a 'more dangerous situation' in the Middle East, strengthening Iran\u2019s regional influence and cementing its status as a 'major global source of terrorism'. The report concludes that Israel sees this moment as a 'pivotal opportunity' to reshape regional power balances, with the recent high-level visits to Washington aimed at influencing the U.S. decision before the final moment.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:42 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/world/1850162-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%805-%D8%A7%D9%95%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A8-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%87%D8%A7)\n\n**Media: Trump May Be Deliberately Delaying, Building Forces Around Iran**\nAccording to reports from The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and Bloomberg, U.S. President Donald Trump has been informed that targeted strikes on Iran are unlikely to topple the Iranian government but could trigger a broader regional conflict. As a result, the White House is currently monitoring Iran\u2019s actions toward protesters before making a final decision on potential strikes and their scale. Advisers are urging Trump to accumulate additional military forces in the Middle East to resolve the Iranian issue definitively. Although Trump has not yet made a final decision, he has ordered U.S. military forces in the region to be placed on heightened readiness. U.S. and Middle Eastern officials believe Trump is deliberately delaying action while American forces are being deployed. A Qatari official stated that preparing for a full-scale strike would require at least five to seven days. Bloomberg warns that the likelihood of strikes will rise after the arrival of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in late January to early February, remaining high through the first half of 2026. Iran cannot address the root causes of protests, which may provide Trump with a pretext for military action. The New York Times suggests Trump is using the 'pause' to redeploy additional military assets, including fighter jets, attack aircraft, aerial refuelers, and air defense systems such as missile interceptors, to secure U.S. military bases in the region.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 02:09 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/politics/69450367/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on the latest reporting from February 2026, the Trump administration is actively deliberating military strikes against Iran while simultaneously engaging in last-ditch diplomatic negotiations in Geneva.

According to multiple sources, Trump has set a strict timeline of \"10 to 15 days, pretty much, maximum\" for reaching a resolution, warning that \"bad things\" will happen if Iran fails to comply [2][14][16].\n\nThe administration appears to be weighing a two-phase military strategy: initial targeted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) headquarters, and ballistic missile sites, potentially followed by larger-scale attacks aimed at regime change\u2014including targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself\u2014if diplomacy fails [9][10][13].\n\n## Military Buildup and Preparations\n\nThe United States has deployed its largest military presence to the Middle East since the 2003 Iraq invasion, suggesting preparations for a prolonged campaign rather than a single strike [10][19]. Current deployments include:\n\n- Two aircraft carrier strike groups (USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald Ford) [14][19]\n- Dozens of F-35, F-22, and F-16 fighter jets [19]\n- Aerial refueling tankers and guided-missile destroyers [19]\n- Air defense systems positioned throughout the region [19]\n- Pentagon personnel relocations to Europe as a precautionary measure [18]\n\nThis buildup coincides with closed-door briefings by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to congressional leaders, as the administration seeks political cover for potential military action [3].\n\n## Diplomatic Track: Geneva Negotiations\n\nDespite the military threats, indirect negotiations resumed in Geneva on February 26, 2026, between U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, mediated by Oman [2][9]. Iran has reportedly offered new concessions, including:\n- A temporary freeze on uranium enrichment (though not a complete halt or offsite transfer) [1]\n- Willingness to move some enriched uranium to Russia [20]\n- Proposal for minimal uranium enrichment strictly for medical purposes [9]\n- Agreement on \"guiding principles\" for future talks [17]\n\nHowever, significant gaps remain. The U.S. demands complete dismantling of key nuclear facilities and a permanent enrichment ban, while Iran insists on recognition of its right to peaceful nuclear technology and phased sanctions relief [1][2].\n\n## Internal Administration Dynamics\n\nWithin the Trump administration, opinions are divided. Some officials question whether airstrikes alone can achieve strategic objectives or regime change [9][10]. Vice President JD Vance has publicly stated that Iran must not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons, justifying potential military action [2].\n\nTrump himself has sent mixed signals, having claimed in summer 2025 that U.S. strikes had \"destroyed\" Iran's nuclear program\u2014a statement Democrats have accused of being misleading, given the current renewed threat assessments [3].\n\n## Iranian Response and Regional Implications\n\nIran has stated it does not seek war but will respond \"resolutely and appropriately\" if attacked, invoking its right to self-defense [5][6]. Specific Iranian threats include:\n- Striking U.S. assets in the region [14]\n- Disrupting shipping through the Strait of Hormuz (through which 20% of global seaborne oil passes) [19]\n- Mobilizing proxy networks in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen [19]\n- Potential \"devastating\" blows to U.S. aircraft carriers, according to Supreme Leader Khamenei [17]\n\nIsrael remains a critical factor, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushing for military action and coordinating closely with U.S. planners [5][7]. Israel views Iran's nuclear infrastructure as an existential threat and opposes any deal allowing Iran to retain enrichment capacity [10].\n\n## International Reactions\n\nThe European Union, through foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, has urged diplomatic solutions, stating \"We don't need another war in this region\" [12]. Russia has warned that attacking Iran would be \"playing with fire\" and confirmed conducting joint naval exercises with Iran in the Oman Sea [17][18].\n\nPoland's Prime Minister has urged citizens to leave Iran immediately, calling the conflict risk \"very realistic\" [18].\n\n## Critical Risks and Scenarios\n\nAnalysts warn of three potential scenarios [1][3]:\n1. **Breakthrough agreement**: A diplomatic deal allowing limited Iranian enrichment for medical purposes in exchange for sanctions relief\n2. **Prolonged stalemate**: Continued pressure with targeted sanctions and symbolic military moves\n3. **Military confrontation**: Either a limited strike escalating into broader regional war, or a deliberate regime change campaign\n\nExperts caution that even limited strikes could spiral out of control, triggering Iranian retaliation through proxy networks and potentially destabilizing global oil markets [1][5][6]. Former CIA Director David Petraeus has warned that military strikes would not guarantee regime collapse [6].\n\nThe situation remains extremely volatile, with the coming days representing what analysts describe as the \"last viable chance\" to avoid escalation before potential military action [6].\n</Asknews_articles>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/us-news/freedom-talk-war-risk-americas-iran-playbook/\">\n## Article Summary\n\n**Source & Nature:** This appears to be an opinion/analysis piece critiquing U.S. policy toward Iran.

Despite military forces being deployed, logistical chains aligned, and operational scenarios prepared, Washington halted action at the final stage.\n- The article characterizes this as a **tactical recalibration**, not a strategic retreat \u2014 the military option against Iran remains embedded in U.S. planning.\n\n---\n\n### Reasons for the Delay\n\nThe article identifies several factors behind Washington's decision to pause:\n\n1. **Regional diplomatic pressure:** The UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia urged Washington to allow backdoor diplomatic channels to operate.\n2. **Incomplete missile defense readiness:** U.S. planners view regional missile defense integration as insufficient to adequately protect Israel and regional partners from a large-scale Iranian response.\n3. **Alliance vulnerabilities:** Concerns about exposing U.S. security commitments if Iran retaliates broadly.\n4. **Domestic political constraints:** Fears of strategic exhaustion, energy market disruption, and prolonged military engagement reminiscent of earlier campaigns.\n5. **Russian and Turkish diplomatic initiatives:** Moscow and Ankara, alongside Qatar, reportedly engaged in mediation efforts.\n\n---\n\n### Diplomatic Track\n\n- Trump told reporters, **\"Hopefully we'll make a deal,\"** signaling openness to diplomacy.\n- Unnamed U.S. officials cited by the *Wall Street Journal* said airstrikes **\"aren't imminent,\"** while noting the need to protect U.S. forces and allies.\n- According to the **Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida** (citing an unnamed source), Russian President Putin presented proposals to Iran's Supreme National Security Council head **Ali Larijani** in Moscow, reportedly prompting Trump to \"postpone\" any military decision.\n- The reported **Russian proposal** includes:\n  - Rosatom removing and storing Iran's enriched nuclear fuel outside the country\n  - Rosatom managing limited uranium enrichment for civilian reactors within agreed limits\n  - Guarantees that Iran's ballistic missile program would not be used to initiate attacks against Israel or the U.S.\n- Core **U.S. demands** include limits on uranium enrichment and restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran maintains its nuclear program is purely peaceful.\n\n---\n\n### Other Notable Points\n\n- The U.S. has deployed additional **Patriot and THAAD air defense batteries** to Middle Eastern bases, maintaining military capacity even as immediate strike threats have eased.\n- The article notes **inconsistencies in U.S. rhetoric**: Washington claims to have already eliminated Iran's nuclear capabilities while simultaneously demanding Tehran abandon its program.\n- Western intelligence assessments cited in media reports indicate **no evidence Iran possesses nuclear weapons**, complicating arguments for immediate military action.\n- **Israel** has reportedly been selectively excluded from certain aspects of U.S. planning, generating unease in Jerusalem.\n- The article describes the situation as a **\"prolonged standoff\"** where pressure is maintained without crossing escalation thresholds, with negotiations functioning as risk management rather than genuine dispute resolution.\n- The window for potential military action has reportedly **shifted forward by weeks or months**.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cfr.org/timelines/us-relations-iran\">\n## Summary: U.S.-Iran Relations 1953\u20132026 (Council on Foreign Relations)\n\n**Note:** The article appears to have been cut off mid-sentence, ending around the 2001 Bonn Agreement section.
