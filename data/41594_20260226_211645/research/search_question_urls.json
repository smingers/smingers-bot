Its relevance is primarily as background context.\n\n---\n\n### Key Historical Facts\n\n- **1953 CIA/MI6 Coup:** The U.S. and UK orchestrated the overthrow of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, reinstating Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as an absolute monarch. American firms subsequently gained ~40% of Iranian oil profits, and the CIA helped fund and train SAVAK, Iran's secret police.\n\n- **Shah's Reforms & Alienation:** The Shah's \"White Revolution\" (1963\u20131979) modernized Iran but alienated the clergy and traditional sectors. Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as a vocal critic and was exiled in 1964.\n\n- **Revolution (1977\u20131979):** Anti-government protests began in October 1977, broadening into a mass uprising. The Shah left Iran on January 16, 1979; Khomeini returned February 1, 1979. By February 11, the monarchy collapsed. A referendum confirmed the Islamic Republic with 98% approval.\n\n- **Post-Revolutionary Ideology:** The new government declared destruction of Israel a core objective, sought to undermine Sunni influence by supporting Shia political movements regionally, and adopted a strongly anti-Western posture \u2014 directly reversing the Shah-era alignment with the U.S.\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question\nThe article establishes the **deep historical roots of U.S.-Iran antagonism**, rooted in the 1953 coup and the 1979 revolution. It explains why Iran's government views the U.S. with fundamental hostility, providing context for the current tensions described in the question's background.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations\">\n## Summary: Iran\u2013United States Relations (Wikipedia Article)\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be a comprehensive Wikipedia entry on Iran-U.S. relations. The content was truncated before reaching the most recent events referenced in the question's background (2025-2026), so the summary reflects what was available.\n\n---\n\n### Historical Foundation\n- Relations date to the mid-19th century, initially positive with the U.S. seen as a neutral \"third force\" against British and Russian colonial interests.\n- The **1953 CIA/MI6-backed coup** overthrowing Prime Minister Mosaddegh is identified as a foundational grievance, reinstalling Shah Pahlavi and establishing SAVAK (secret police) with U.S. support. Many historians link this to the anti-American character of the 1979 revolution.\n\n### Post-Revolution Hostility\n- **No formal diplomatic relations since April 7, 1980**, following the 1979 revolution and hostage crisis. Pakistan and Switzerland serve as protecting powers respectively.\n- In **2018**, Supreme Leader Khamenei formally banned direct talks with the U.S.\n\n### Nuclear Dimension\n- The U.S. *originally helped establish* Iran's nuclear program under Eisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace\" (1953), providing Iran's first reactor in 1967.\n- The **2015 JCPOA** placed limits on Iran's nuclear program; sanctions were largely lifted in 2016.\n- The **Trump administration withdrew** from the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed sanctions (\"maximum pressure campaign\"), after which Iran gradually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels.\n\n### Public Opinion\n- **2013 BBC poll:** 87% of Americans view Iran negatively (most unfavorable globally).\n- **2019 IranPoll:** 86% of Iranians view the U.S. unfavorably (most unfavorable globally), though research suggests most Iranians hold positive views of the *American people*.\n- **2018 Pew poll:** 39% of Americans consider limiting Iran's influence a top foreign policy priority.\n\n### Key Structural Tensions Identified\n- Iran cites U.S. support for Israel and attempts at \"global dictatorship\" as drivers of hostility.\n- The U.S. cites the hostage crisis, human rights abuses, Iran's nuclear program, and support for proxy groups (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis).\n- The article notes relations *improve* when interests overlap (e.g., countering Sunni militants/ISIS).\n\n---\n\n*The article does not cover the 2025 U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites referenced in the question's background, as the content was truncated before reaching that period.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration\">\n## Summary: Iran\u2013U.S. Relations During the First Trump Administration (2017\u20132021)\n\n### Overall Character of the Period\nThe first Trump administration marked a sharp break from Obama-era engagement, pursuing a **\"maximum pressure\" campaign** against Iran through extensive sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and ultimately military action. Despite escalating tensions, the period stopped short of full-scale war.\n\n---\n\n### Key Policy Actions by the U.S.\n\n- **Travel Ban (January 2017):** Iranian citizens barred from entering the U.S.\n- **JCPOA Withdrawal (May 2018):** Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and reimposed all previously lifted sanctions, eventually totaling **over 1,500 sanctions** targeting Iran's central bank, oil company, shipping lines, and foreign entities doing business with Iran.\n- **IRGC Terrorist Designation (April 2019):** The U.S. designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 the first time official armed units of a sovereign state were placed on such a list.\n- **Coalition Building:** The administration strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Gulf states to counter Iranian regional influence, and cultivated relationships with Iranian opposition groups, including the MEK.\n\n---\n\n### Iranian Responses\n\n- Threatened to resume **unrestricted uranium enrichment** and close the **Strait of Hormuz**\n- Supreme Leader Khamenei **banned direct talks** with the U.S. (August 2018), declaring negotiations impossible with the Trump administration\n- Iran's parliament designated U.S. forces and allies in the region as **terrorists** in response to the IRGC designation\n- Iran launched a **military satellite** and was accused of **election interference** and **proxy attacks**\n\n---\n\n### Key Escalation Events (2019\u20132020)\n\n- **2019 Tanker Attacks:** Oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf region; Iran was suspected of involvement\n- **U.S. Drone Downing:** Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone; Trump **called off retaliatory airstrikes** at the last minute, opting instead for cyberattacks and additional sanctions\n- **Saudi Oil Facility Strikes:** Iran was suspected of orchestrating strikes on Saudi Aramco facilities\n- **K-1 Air Base Attack (December 2019):** A rocket attack killed a U.S. contractor, leading to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias and a subsequent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad\n- **Assassination of Qasem Soleimani (January 3, 2020):** The U.S. killed Iran's top general in a drone strike in Iraq, prompting **Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq**. Iran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane during the crisis period.\n\n---\n\n### Diplomatic and Legal Dimensions\n\n- The **International Court of Justice** provisionally ordered the U.S. to cancel sanctions (October 2018); the U.S. responded by **withdrawing from the 1955 Treaty of Amity** with Iran\n- The **UN Security Council** rejected a U.S. proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran; only the Dominican Republic voted with the U.S.\n- U.S. allies, including European nations, largely **refused to follow** the maximum pressure approach, leaving Washington diplomatically isolated on several fronts\n- A **January 2019 U.S. intelligence assessment** concluded Iran was **not pursuing nuclear weapons**, contradicting some administration rhetoric\n\n---\n\n### Net Effect\nThe maximum pressure campaign severely damaged Iran's economy \u2014 crashing its currency, quadrupling inflation, and sharply reducing oil exports \u2014 but failed to bring Iran to the negotiating table. The period ended with relations deeply hostile and all major disputes unresolved.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action\">\n## Summary: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)\n\n### Overview\nThe JCPOA, finalized in Vienna on **July 14, 2015**, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany) and the EU, designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\n### Key Provisions\n- Iran agreed to reduce its low-enriched uranium stockpile by **97%** (from 10,000 kg to 300 kg) and cap enrichment at **3.67%** for 15 years\n- Active centrifuges reduced to **6,104 units** (only 5,060 allowed to enrich), restricted to older IR-1 models at Natanz\n- Key facilities at **Fordow, Natanz, and Arak** repurposed for civilian use\n- Iran accepted more intrusive **IAEA monitoring**\n- In exchange, Iran received relief from UN, EU, and U.S. nuclear-related sanctions (non-nuclear sanctions remained)\n\n### Collapse of the Agreement\n- The **U.S. withdrew in 2018**, reimposing sanctions under its \"maximum pressure campaign,\" effectively nullifying the deal's economic provisions\n- Following the **June 2025 Iran\u2013Israel war**, Iran officially announced the **termination of the agreement on October 18, 2025**, after 10 years\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question\nThe article confirms the JCPOA is now formally defunct, removing a key diplomatic framework that had previously constrained Iran's nuclear program and provided a channel for U.S.-Iran engagement.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani\">\n# Summary: Assassination of Qasem Soleimani\n\n## The Strike\n\nOn **January 3, 2020**, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport that killed Iranian Major General **Qasem Soleimani**, commander of the IRGC's Quds Force. Also killed was **Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis**, deputy chairman of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces and commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah. Five other Iranians and Iraqis died in the strike.\n\n## Justification and Legal Controversy\n\n- The U.S. Pentagon justified the strike as necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\" and to protect U.S. personnel and deter further Iranian escalation.\n- The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and other experts considered the strike a likely **violation of international law**.\n- Iran called it **\"state terrorism\"**; Iraq called it a breach of bilateral security agreements and national sovereignty.\n\n## Context and Background\n\n- The strike occurred during the **2019\u20132022 Persian Gulf crisis**, following U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions.\n- A **December 27, 2019 rocket attack** on K-1 Air Base killed an American contractor, triggering U.S. airstrikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah, which in turn prompted an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\n- Both Presidents **Bush and Obama** had previously considered but rejected targeting Soleimani, fearing escalation to full-scale war.\n\n## Soleimani's Significance\n\n- Considered the **second most powerful person in Iran**, behind Supreme Leader Khamenei.\n- Architect of Iran's foreign policy across Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Afghanistan.\n- The Pentagon attributed \"hundreds of American deaths\" to Soleimani and his forces.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n- Iranian leaders vowed **\"shattering revenge.\"**\n- On **January 8, 2020**, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq \u2014 the first direct Iran-U.S. military engagement since 1988.\n- That same day, the IRGC accidentally shot down **Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752**.\n- The **Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution** to expel all foreign troops.\n- Iran took its **fifth and final step** of reducing commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal.\n- No further military exchanges occurred immediately after.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
