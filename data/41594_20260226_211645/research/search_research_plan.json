  "plan_analysis": "The pre-research context supplies long-term background (1979 revolution, JCPOA collapse, 2025 war, December-2025 protests) but leaves operational forecasting gaps:\n1. Base rate: How often has the U.S. struck foreign (and specifically Iranian) territory in comparable timeframes? What are the typical lead-up indicators (carrier deployments, congressional votes, public warnings)?\n2. Resolution mechanism: Which sources would unambiguously confirm a physical U.S. strike and how have such events been reported in the past?\n3. Key drivers going forward: a) U.S. military posture in CENTCOM (assets in/near the Gulf), b) policy deliberations inside the Trump administration, c) evolution of Iran\u2019s internal unrest and any humanitarian rationales, d) diplomatic or congressional constraints that could block action.\n4. Current state: February-2026 troop movements, leaks about strike plans, protest casualty updates, any ongoing U.S.\u2013Iran (or U.S.\u2013Israel\u2013Gulf) negotiations.\n5. Contrarian check: Evidence of de-escalation\u2014back-channel talks, Pentagon or congressional push-back, or competing crises diverting U.S. attention.\n\nThe search strategy therefore pairs five historical queries (to build priors and understand precedent and constraints) with three current-news queries (to track near-term catalysts or inhibitors). One Agent [HISTORICAL] query synthesises a reference class base-rate across U.S. military operations.",
