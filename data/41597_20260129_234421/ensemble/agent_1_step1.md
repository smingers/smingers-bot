Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

1. **FDIC Failed Bank List (June 27, 2025)** - Primary official source showing 24 banks in the displayed excerpt with fund numbers 10523-10549. Last updated April 26, 2024, but article dated June 27, 2025. This is the authoritative source for bank failures. **Quality: Excellent (official government data)**

2. **FDIC Bank Failures Summary (undated)** - States 570 total failures from 2001-2026. Limited detail but provides aggregate context. **Quality: Good (official but incomplete excerpt)**

3. **Bankrate Article (December 20, 2025)** - Comprehensive historical data by Matthew Goldberg. Key facts:
   - 2025: 2 failures (Pulaski Savings Bank on Jan 17; Santa Anna National Bank on Jun 27)
   - 2024: 2 failures
   - 2023: 5 failures (including SVB, Signature, First Republic)
   - 2022: 0 failures
   - 2021: 0 failures
   - 2020: 4 failures (2 in Jan-Apr per other sources)
   - Total since Oct 2000: 572 failures
   **Quality: Excellent (detailed, recent, cross-references FDIC data)**

4. **San Francisco Fed Research (November 10, 2025)** - Discusses tariff impacts in April 2025 on bank stocks. Notes 572 total failures on FDIC list as of January 2026. Large banks showed stress signals but system remained resilient. **Quality: Excellent (Federal Reserve research, but focused on market stress not failures)**

5. **Morningstar Article (November 13, 2025)** - Discusses credit concerns, fraud incidents at Zions and Western Alliance, and bankruptcy write-downs. References 2023 crisis and "late-cycle accidents." DBRS expects higher delinquencies but sees regional banks as "well positioned to absorb higher loan losses." **Quality: Good (expert opinions from analysts, but speculative about future stress)**

6. **NY Fed Treasury Market Article (November 12, 2025)** - Discusses April 2025 liquidity stress around tariff announcements. Notes March 2023 "regional banking turmoil" as comparison point. **Quality: Excellent (Federal Reserve research, confirms April 2025 stress event)**

7. **Agent Report** - Provides Jan-Apr failure counts for 2012-2025:
   - 2025: 1 (Pulaski Savings Bank on Jan 17)
   - 2024: 1
   - 2023: 2 (SVB Mar 10, Signature Mar 12)

   - 2014: 6
   - 2013: 10
   - 2012: 25
   
   Also notes 2005-2006 had zero failures. Identifies 2009-2013 as Great Recession aftermath with highest Jan-Apr counts.
   **Quality: Good (synthesizes FDIC data, though some years 2001-2011 incomplete)**

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All Jan-Apr periods (2001-2025)** - Most comprehensive but includes crisis periods (2009-2013) that may not be representative of current environment.

2. **Post-crisis "normal" years (2014-2025)** - Excludes Great Recession aftermath. Jan-Apr counts: 6, 4, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1. Average: 1.75 failures per Jan-Apr period.

3. **Recent stable period (2018-2025, excluding 2023 crisis)** - Years: 2018(0), 2019(0), 2020(2), 2021(0), 2022(0), 2024(1), 2025(1). Average: 0.57 failures.

4. **Post-2023 crisis period (2024-2025)** - Only 2 years: 2024(1), 2025(1). Average: 1.0 failure.

**Most suitable reference class:** Post-crisis "normal" years (2014-2025) provides the best balance - it's recent enough to reflect current regulatory environment (post-Dodd-Frank), excludes the extreme Great Recession period, but includes enough data points (12 years) for statistical meaning. It also includes the 2023 crisis and its aftermath, which is relevant given we're forecasting for 2026.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** January 1 - April 30, 2026 (4 months). As of January 29, 2026, we are 8 days into the period with approximately 92 days remaining.

**Historical patterns for Jan-Apr periods (2014-2025):**
- Distribution: 0 failures (4 years), 1 failure (2 years), 2 failures (3 years), 3 failures (1 year), 4 failures (1 year), 6 failures (1 year)
- Median: 1.5 failures
- Mode: 0 failures
- 33% had 0 failures
- 17% had 1 failure
- 25% had 2 failures
- 25% had 3+ failures

**Seasonal patterns:** No clear evidence of seasonal concentration, though some stress events (2023 crisis) occurred in March.

**(d) Justification:**

**Current environment (as of Jan 29, 2026):**
- No failures have occurred yet in Jan 2026 (only 8 days have passed)
- The financial system experienced stress in April 2025 from tariff announcements, but Treasury markets and bank stocks recovered by late summer 2025
- Credit concerns emerged in late 2025 (fraud at Zions/Western Alliance, bankruptcies affecting JPMorgan, Fifth Third, First Citizens)
- DBRS expects "more delinquencies and loan losses in coming quarters" but sees banks as "well positioned to absorb" them
- The system has been through significant stress-testing since 2023 crisis; regulatory oversight is heightened
- Recent pattern: 2024 and 2025 each had exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure

**Key factors:**
1. **Base rate from suitable reference class (2014-2025):** Average of 1.75 Jan-Apr failures
2. **Recent trend (2024-2025):** Exactly 1 failure each year in Jan-Apr period
3. **Current stress indicators:** Moderate (credit concerns, but no systemic crisis signals)
4. **Time already elapsed:** 8 days into 122-day period with 0 failures so far
5. **Regulatory environment:** Heightened scrutiny post-2023 crisis likely catches problems earlier
6. **Expert opinions:** DBRS and Morningstar analysts expect stress but not crisis-level failures

**Distribution reasoning:**
- 0 failures: Plausible given no failures yet and 33% historical rate in reference class. However, credit stress indicators suggest some risk remains.
- 1 failure: Most likely given recent 2024-2025 pattern and median historical outcome
- 2 failures: Moderately likely given 25% historical rate and current credit concerns
- 3+ failures: Less likely absent crisis conditions, but 25% historical rate suggests non-negligible probability

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True probability vs. hedged projection:**
I must avoid both overconfidence (assigning 90%+ to single outcome) and excessive hedging (spreading probabilities too evenly). The historical data shows real variation, so uncertainty is warranted.

**(b) Previously established distributions:**
The 2014-2025 reference class provides an empirical distribution:
- 0 failures: 33% (4/12 years)
- 1 failure: 17% (2/12 years)  
- 2 failures: 25% (3/12 years)
- 3+ failures: 25% (3/12 years, specifically: 3, 4, and 6 failures)

**(c) Small probability differences:**
The difference between 40% and 50% is meaningful - it represents changing from 3:2 odds to even odds. I should be precise.

**(d) Rate of upsets:**
In the 2014-2025 period, "unexpected" outcomes (deviating from the 1-2 failure range) occurred 50% of the time (6/12 years had either 0 or 3+ failures). This suggests significant uncertainty remains appropriate. However, the 2024-2025 consecutive years of exactly 1 failure suggests some stability in the current regime.

**Calibration adjustments from base distribution:**

Starting with empirical 2014-2025 distribution (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%), I adjust for:

1. **Recent trend weight (+):** 2024-2025 both had exactly 1 failure → increase "1" probability
2. **Time elapsed (-):** 8 days with 0 failures → slight decrease in 3+ probability
3. **Credit stress indicators (+):** Moderate stress suggests avoiding overweight on "0"
4. **Expert consensus (neutral to +):** Expects stress but not crisis → supports 1-2 range

**Final calibration:**
- Shift ~10% from "0" to "1" (recent pattern is strong signal)
- Shift ~5% from "3+" to "2" (no crisis indicators, time elapsed)
- Result: Lower "0" and "3+" relative to base, higher "1" and maintain "2"

Outside View Prediction:
0: 26%
1: 38%
2: 24%
3+: 12%
