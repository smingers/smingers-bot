# Analysis

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources:**

1. **Bankrate Article (Dec 20, 2025)** - Comprehensive historical data showing 2 failures in 2025 (Pulaski Jan 17, Santa Anna Jun 27), 2 in 2024, 5 in 2023. Factual data sourced from FDIC. **Quality: Excellent - recent, factual, authoritative**

2. **FDIC Resources** - Official government data confirming 570-572 total failures since 2000. **Quality: Excellent - primary source**

**Current News (Jan 2026):**

3. **Globe and Mail Opinion (Jan 29, 2026)** - Chris Gay (former WSJ) reports $85B emergency Fed cash infusions to unnamed banks since Oct 2025, relaxed transaction limits in Dec, 30% Fed supervision staff cuts under Bowman. **Opinion piece but cites specific factual claims about Fed actions. Quality: Moderate-Good - concerning if factual, but single source**

4. **BaFin Warning (Jan 28, 2026)** - German regulator warns of "sudden corrections" risk in 2026, citing "fragile and uncertain" markets despite "buoyant" mood. Notes German banking sector "quite profitable." **Quality: Good - expert regulatory opinion, but focused on Germany/global markets**

5. **FSB Resolution Report (Jan 29, 2026)** - Reviews 2023 bank failures, confirms resolution frameworks in place, no new U.S. failures mentioned. **Quality: Excellent - international regulatory body assessment**

6. **FDIC Signage Rule (Jan 22, 2026)** - Administrative rule on ATM/digital signage. No relevance to failures. **Quality: N/A for this question**

**Brazilian Bank Context:**
7. **Banco Master Investigation (Jan 29, 2026)** - Brazilian bank liquidated Nov 2025, R$12B fraud investigation. Not a U.S. bank. **Quality: N/A - wrong jurisdiction**

**October 2025 Regional Bank Concerns:**
8. **Regional Bank Stress Articles (Oct 17-30, 2025)** - Multiple sources report fraud at Zions/Western Alliance, KBW Bank Index down 7%, JPMorgan CEO warning, but FDIC confirmed only 2 small failures in 2025 (assets <$70M). DBRS analysts expect "higher delinquencies" but banks "well positioned to absorb losses." **Quality: Good - documented market stress but no actual failures resulted**

9. **FDIC Acting Chair Hill (Oct 15, 2025)** - Announced expansion of nonbank bidders for failed banks, pre-qualification pilot launching Jan 2026. Indicates FDIC preparing for potential failures. **Quality: Good - factual regulatory development**

**Key Factual Findings:**
- **No U.S. bank failures reported in January 2026 so far** (as of Jan 29)
- Fed emergency lending and supervision cuts are concerning but unverified by multiple sources
- October 2025 stress did NOT result in failures
- Regulatory preparation for failures (Hill's changes) suggests awareness of risk

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical pattern stability (2024-2025)**: Two consecutive years with exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure each. This represents a stable post-2023-crisis equilibrium. **Impact: Strongly supports "1" outcome**

2. **Zero failures in Jan 2026 so far**: 8 days elapsed with no failures reduces probability of multiple failures in remaining 92 days, especially given failures tend to be discrete events. **Impact: Moderately reduces "3+" probability**

**Moderate Evidence:**
3. **October 2025 stress that didn't produce failures**: Market sold off 7%, fraud revelations occurred, yet no actual bank failures resulted. Suggests system resilience despite stress. **Impact: Moderately supports lower failure counts (0-1 range)**

4. **Fed emergency lending claims ($85B since Oct 2025)**: If true, indicates significant but contained stress at large banks. Single source (Globe and Mail opinion), unconfirmed. Large banks rarely fail outright due to TBTF. **Impact: Weak to moderate - raises uncertainty but unclear relevance to small/regional bank failures**

5. **FDIC preparation for failures (Hill's Oct 2025 announcement)**: Expanding nonbank bidders and pre-qualification pilot suggests FDIC expects potential failures. However, this is precautionary planning, not prediction. **Impact: Weak - indicates awareness but not imminent risk**

**Weak Evidence:**
6. **BaFin warning about global markets**: German regulator's concern about "sudden corrections" is generic, not U.S.-specific, and German banks are "quite profitable." **Impact: Minimal - too general**

7. **Fed supervision staff cuts**: 30% reduction is concerning for long-term oversight but unlikely to cause failures in 4-month window (Jan-Apr 2026). **Impact: Minimal for this timeframe**

**Evidence Not Considered:**
- Brazilian bank failures (wrong jurisdiction)
- FDIC signage rules (administrative)
- U.S. Bank payroll error (operational issue, not solvency)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: January 1 - April 30, 2026 (122 days total; 92 days remaining as of Jan 29)

**Already elapsed**: 8 days (6.6%) with 0 failures observed

**If timeframe halved (2 months instead of 4)**:
- Would significantly increase "0" probability (shorter window = less opportunity for failures)
- Historical data shows failures are discrete events, not evenly distributed
- Estimate: 0→40%, 1→40%, 2→15%, 3+→5%

**If timeframe doubled (8 months instead of 4)**:
- Would significantly increase "2" and "3+" probabilities
- More time for credit stress to materialize into failures
- Estimate: 0→15%, 1→30%, 2→30%, 3+→25%

**Temporal dynamics**: Bank failures are typically lagging indicators of financial stress. The Oct 2025 stress would most likely manifest in Q1-Q2 2026 if it leads to failures. We're in that window now.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point: Outside view base rate (2014-2025)**
- 0: 33%, 1: 17%, 2: 25%, 3+: 25%

**Key factors shifting prediction:**

1. **Strong recent pattern (2024-2025)**: Two consecutive years of exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure represents the most recent and relevant data. This is a more stable regime than the broader 2014-2025 period which includes the 2023 crisis outlier. **Shift: +20% to "1", -10% from "0", -5% from "2", -5% from "3+"**

2. **Time elapsed with no failures**: 8 days into period with zero failures reduces tail risk. While not highly diagnostic (only 6.6% of period), it does provide weak Bayesian update against "3+" scenarios. **Shift: -3% from "3+", +1% to "0", +2% to "1"**

3. **October 2025 stress that resolved without failures**: This is a critical data point. Market stress, fraud revelations, and credit concerns did NOT produce failures. This suggests either: (a) problems were contained/resolved, or (b) failures are lagging and coming in Q1 2026. Given 8 days with no failures, (a) seems more likely. **Shift: +5% to "0", -3% from "3+"**

4. **Unverified Fed emergency lending**: The $85B emergency lending claim is concerning but from single opinion source. If true, it suggests stress at large banks (which rarely fail). If false, it's noise. Given uncertainty, minimal weight. **Shift: +2% to "2" (hedge against unknown unknowns)**

5. **FDIC proactive preparation**: Hill's October announcement suggests FDIC awareness of risk, but this is prudent planning, not prediction. **Shift: Neutral, already captured in base rates**

**Net adjustments from base rate (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%):**
- 0: +6% → 39%
- 1: +23% → 40%
- 2: +2% → 27%
- 3+: -11% → 14%

**Sanity check**: The 2024-2025 pattern is the strongest signal. Both years had exactly 1 failure. The current environment shows stress indicators but no actual failures yet. The October stress resolved without failures. This justifies concentrating probability on 0-1 range while maintaining meaningful probability on 2-3+ given historical variance.

**Are current circumstances sufficiently different to override reference class?**
No. The 2014-2025 reference class includes the 2023 crisis and post-crisis period, which is highly relevant. Current circumstances (moderate credit stress, regulatory awareness, no failures yet) fit within this reference class. The adjustment toward "1" is justified by the strong recent pattern, not by circumstances being fundamentally different.

# Probability Calibration

**Initial distribution from outside view**: 0→39%, 1→40%, 2→27%, 3+→14%

**Calibration considerations:**

**(a) True probability vs. hedged projection**: My analysis genuinely supports concentration in the 0-1 range (79% combined). The recent pattern is strong, and no failures have occurred yet. However, the 21% assigned to 2-3+ reflects real historical variance and unresolved credit concerns. This is not excessive hedging.

**(b) Significance of small probability differences**: 
- 40% vs. 39% is essentially a tie, reflecting genuine uncertainty between "0" and "1"
- 27% for "2" represents 1-in-4 odds, which aligns with historical frequency (25% in base period)
- 14% for "3+" represents 1-in-7 odds, down from historical 25% due to current conditions

**(c) Blind spots and confidence adjustment**:

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Lagging failures from Oct 2025 stress**: If the Oct stress is still working through the system, failures could cluster in Feb-Mar 2026. This would push toward "2" or "3+".
2. **Unverified Fed emergency lending**: If the $85B claim is accurate and indicates hidden stress at multiple institutions, we could see cascading failures.
3. **Regulatory capacity**: If Fed supervision cuts are impacting real-time monitoring, problems could go undetected until failure.

**Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly**: A cluster of 3-4 regional bank failures in February-March 2026 due to delayed recognition of Oct 2025 credit problems, particularly in CRE or commercial lending portfolios.

**Confidence adjustment**: Given these blind spots center on underestimating tail risk, I should slightly increase "2" and "3+" at expense of "1":
- Shift -3% from "1" to "2" (+2%) and "3+" (+1%)

**Final calibrated distribution**:
- 0: 39%
- 1: 37%
- 2: 23%
- 3+: 1%

Wait - this doesn't sum to 100%. Let me recalculate:

Starting: 0→39%, 1→40%, 2→27%, 3+→14% (sums to 120%, error in my addition)

Let me recalculate from base rates properly:

**Base rate (2014-2025)**: 0→33%, 1→17%, 2→25%, 3+→25%

**Adjustments**:
- Recent pattern (2024-2025): +15% to "1", -8% from "0", -4% from "2", -3% from "3+"
- Time elapsed: +2% to "0", +1% to "1", -3% from "3+"
- Oct stress resolved: +3% to "0", -2% from "2", -1% from "3+"
- Blind spot hedge: -2% from "1", +1% to "2", +1% to "3+"

**Final calculation**:
- 0: 33% - 8% + 2% + 3% = 30%
- 1: 17% + 15% + 1% - 2% = 31%
- 2: 25% - 4% - 2% + 1% = 20%
- 3+: 25% - 3% - 3% - 1% + 1% = 19%

Sum check: 30 + 31 + 20 + 19 = 100% ✓

# Checklist

1. **Paraphrase**: Count U.S. bank failures Jan 1 - Apr 30, 2026, per FDIC Failed Bank List. Options: 0, 1, 2, or 3+ failures.

2. **Base rate alignment**: Started with 2014-2025 distribution (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%), adjusted moderately for recent pattern and current conditions. Final prediction (30%, 31%, 20%, 19%) remains rooted to this base.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = 0 or 1 (61% combined); Least likely = none clearly separated. This makes sense given recent 2024-2025 pattern of exactly 1 failure each year, but acknowledges historical variance.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - 2024-2025: exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure each year (strong pattern)
   - Zero failures in first 8 days of Jan 2026 (weak update)
   - Oct 2025 stress resolved without failures (moderate resilience signal)
   - Historical variance: 50% of 2014-2025 years had 0 or 3+ (uncertainty remains)
   - Unverified Fed emergency lending claims (potential hidden stress)

5. **Blind spot**: Lagging failures from Oct 2025 credit stress materializing in Feb-Mar 2026, producing 3-4 failures. Would make "3+" look underweighted. Partially addressed by maintaining 19% on "3+".

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
