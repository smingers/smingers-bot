(b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All years 2001-2025 (Jan-Apr failures):**
   - Most comprehensive but includes extreme crisis years (2009-2012) that may not be representative
   - Suitable if we believe current conditions could mirror any past scenario

2. **Post-crisis "normal" years (2014-2025, excluding 2023):**
   - Excludes Great Recession aftermath but includes recent experience
   - 2023 excluded due to SVB/Signature Bank crisis being atypical
   - Counts: 2014(6), 2015(4), 2016(2), 2017(3), 2018(0), 2019(0), 2020(2), 2021(0), 2022(0), 2024(1), 2025(1)
   - Average: ~1.7 failures per Jan-Apr period
   - Distribution: 0 failures (4 years), 1 failure (2 years), 2 failures (3 years), 3 failures (1 year), 4 failures (1 year), 6 failures (1 year)

3. **Recent stable period (2018-2022, 2024-2025):**
   - Most recent "normal" conditions
   - Counts: 2018(0), 2019(0), 2020(2), 2021(0), 2022(0), 2024(1), 2025(1)
   - Average: ~0.6 failures
   - Very low failure environment

4. **Last 3 years (2023-2025):**
   - Most recent but includes 2023 crisis
   - Counts: 2023(2), 2024(1), 2025(1)
   - Average: ~1.3 failures

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Post-crisis normal years (2014-2025, excluding 2023) provides the best balance. It captures the modern banking regulatory environment post-Dodd-Frank while excluding the unique 2023 crisis. Current macro conditions (late 2025/early 2026) show some stress signals but no acute crisis.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 1, 2026 to April 30, 2026 (120 days total)
- As of January 29, 2026: 91 days remaining
- 8 days have already passed with no reported failures

**Historical Jan-Apr Patterns (2014-2025, excluding 2023):**
- Zero failures: 36% of years (4/11)
- One failure: 18% of years (2/11)
- Two failures: 27% of years (3/11)
- Three failures: 9% of years (1/11)
- Four+ failures: 18% of years (2/11, with 4 and 6)

**Timing within Jan-Apr period:**
- 2025: Pulaski Savings Bank failed January 17 (early in period)
- 2024: Republic First Bank failed January 26 (late January)
- Historical pattern: Failures can occur at any point in the period

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- No strong evidence of clustering in specific months
- FDIC typically closes banks on Fridays to minimize disruption

(d) Justification:

**Current Environment Assessment (as of late January 2026):**

*Positive factors (suggesting lower failure risk):*
- Banking system has been relatively stable since 2023 crisis
- Only 2 small failures in 2025 (total assets ~$113M combined)
- FDIC insurance remains intact; no depositor losses
- 8 days into 2026 with no failures yet

*Concerning factors (suggesting elevated risk):*
- Morningstar article (Nov 2025) documents recent credit problems: bankruptcies affecting JPMorgan, Fifth Third, First Citizens; fraud at Zions and Western Alliance
- DBRS expects "more delinquencies and loan losses in coming quarters" from regional banks
- Jamie Dimon's "cockroach" comment suggests visible problems may indicate hidden issues
- April 2025 tariff announcement caused market stress, though markets recovered
- Trade policy uncertainty and its impact on bank borrowers
- Interest rate environment: Fed cut rates in 2025 but banks still dealing with underwater securities from 2022-2023 hiking cycle
- Regional banks showing stress signals (share price drops of 10-13% on single-day news)

*Base Rate from Reference Class:*
Using 2014-2025 (excluding 2023): 11 observations
- 0 failures: 4 times (36%)
- 1 failure: 2 times (18%)
- 2 failures: 3 times (27%)
- 3+ failures: 2 times (18%)

*Key Adjustments:*
1. **Credit quality concerns**: The Morningstar article's documentation of multiple credit events in late 2025 suggests stress is building. However, these affected larger banks that absorbed losses rather than failed.
2. **Small bank vulnerability**: Both 2025 failures were very small institutions (<$65M assets). Small community banks remain most vulnerable.
3. **No acute crisis**: Unlike 2023 (deposit runs) or 2008-2012 (systemic crisis), current environment shows stress but not panic.
4. **Time already elapsed**: 8 days into the period with no failures slightly reduces probability of higher counts.
5. **DBRS forward guidance**: Expert opinion from credit rating agency expecting deterioration suggests risk is elevated above recent 2024-2025 baseline.

The evidence suggests we're in a transitional period - not as benign as 2018-2022 (mostly zero failures) but not approaching crisis levels. The credit problems documented are real but manageable for the system. Most likely outcome is 0-2 failures of small institutions.

Outside view calibration:

Starting with the reference class base rates (2014-2025 ex-2023):
- 0: 36%
- 1: 18%
- 2: 27%
- 3+: 18%

**Calibration adjustments:**

1. **Recent trend toward fewer failures**: 2024-2025 averaged 1 failure each, suggesting the baseline may be shifting lower. This increases probability of 0-1 outcomes.

2. **Credit stress signals**: Multiple documented problems in late 2025 suggest risk is elevated above the 2024-2025 baseline but below 2014-2017 levels. This slightly increases probability of 1-2 outcomes relative to 0.

3. **Time elapsed**: 8 days with no failures provides weak evidence toward lower end of distribution, though not decisive given failures can cluster.

4. **Expert forward guidance**: DBRS expecting more losses suggests above-baseline risk, but their assessment is for "regional banks well positioned to absorb" - meaning stress without systemic failure risk.

5. **Size of recent failures**: The tiny size of 2025 failures ($50-65M assets) suggests any 2026 failures likely to be similarly small, numerous small banks remain vulnerable.

6. **Historical upset rate**: In this domain, upsets are relatively uncommon in stable periods. The 2023 crisis was a genuine surprise, but represented a unique confluence of factors (rapid rate hikes + concentrated deposits + poor risk management). Current conditions don't suggest similar tail risk.

**Probability distribution reasoning:**

- **0 failures**: Should be most likely given recent trend, but credit stress reduces this from 36% baseline to ~32%
- **1 failure**: Elevated from 18% baseline to ~35% given documented stress and pattern of small bank vulnerability
- **2 failures**: Slight reduction from 27% baseline to ~23% - possible but requires two separate situations to materialize
- **3+ failures**: Reduced from 18% baseline to ~10% - would require either a cluster of small bank failures or an unexpected shock

These probabilities reflect: (a) continuation of low-failure environment from 2024-2025, (b) modest elevation in risk from documented credit problems, (c) absence of systemic crisis indicators, (d) small bank vulnerability persisting.

Outside View Prediction:
0: 32%
1: 35%
2: 23%
3+: 10%
