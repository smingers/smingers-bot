Analysis:
1. Source Analysis:
 • FDIC Failed Bank List excerpts (dated Jun 27, 2025) and the FDIC statistical breakdown provide reliable historical counts of bank failures and their monthly distributions. The factual details (names, dates, counts) are directly from the FDIC and are the backbone of historical reference‐class data. They do not include any opinions.
 • The Bankrate article (Dec 20, 2025) gives a clear factual recounting of bank failures in 2025, showing two failures in that year, and provides a historical perspective from 2009–2025. Although it contains descriptive commentary, its numbers on the recent failure counts are fact‐checked against FDIC sources.
 • The San Francisco Fed article (Nov 2025) and the Morningstar article (Nov 2025) offer macroeconomic context and market commentary. They include expert opinions (e.g., from Jamie Dimon, Marc Rowan) that signal stress factors such as trade shocks and deposit-run concerns. These opinions are from well‐identified experts and thus are useful for understanding the broader risk environment.
 • The Liberty Street Economics piece (Nov 2025) further details market conditions, liquidity, and volatility. Its factual discussion of Treasury market metrics and comparison points (such as reference to March 2023 turmoil) help bracket the range of stress scenarios affecting banks.
 • The Agent Report synthesizing the historical counts (2001–2025) with macro explanation provides both quantitative benchmarks (notably the concentrated failures in crisis years) and a narrative context explaining why early‐year failure “spikes” occurred (e.g., during the Great Recession, post–housing downturn, COVID downturn, and the 2023 interest‐rate shock).

Overall, the FDIC sources are the most fact‐based while the financial commentary from the Fed and Morningstar adds important macro-financial context. All sources are recent (late 2025) and directly address past outcomes that inform our reference class for predicting 2026 outcomes.

2. Reference Class Analysis:
 • One reference class is the cluster of recent years (2020–2025) in which the January–April bank failure counts ranged between 0 and 2. This class is especially relevant because it reflects the current regime, post–COVID market stabilization, and heightened but not extreme interest‐rate environments.
 • A more “crisis” reference class is provided by the years during and immediately following the Great Recession and the housing crisis (e.g., 2012 with an exceptionally high count and 2013 with 10 failures). However, these crisis numbers seem less relevant given that systemic reforms and improved bank capitalizations have taken hold since then.
 • The most suitable reference class for forecasting Jan–April 2026 failures is the recent calm to moderately stressful period of 2020–2025, adjusted for current expert commentary about deposit-run dynamics and residual credit market pressures, but without anticipating a full-blown crisis.

3. Timeframe Analysis:
 The prediction covers bank failures occurring from January 1 to April 30, 2026. As today is January 29, 2026, approximately 3 more months remain until the outcome is finalized. Historical patterns over these 4-month early-year windows in the recent era (2020–2025) demonstrate low counts (0–2 failures in most years), with occasional small spikes when macro conditions (e.g., interest-rate hikes or market shocks) intervene.

4. Justification:
 Integrating the above, the base rate from recent years suggests that a single failure (or none) is the most common outcome. However, caution is warranted due to continuing macroeconomic risks: the lingering impact of recent interest-rate shocks, occasional depositor concerns, and market uncertainties highlighted in the Fed and Morningstar articles. While a severe crisis akin to 2012 or 2013 appears unlikely (since reforms and improved bank resiliency have taken hold), the possibility of one or two additional failures cannot be ruled out entirely.
 Given that for Jan–Apr periods in 2023 and 2020, we saw counts of 2, but also several instances of zero or one in adjacent years, the outside view prediction must hedge toward the less extreme outcomes. In particular, the “3+” option is reserved for true systemic stress events, which although possible, are less likely given the current environment and expert outlook.

Outside view calibration:
 Based on historical reference class (with 0–2 failures being the norm in the recent post-crisis period) plus expert indicators of moderate residual market stress (evidenced by past deposit-run incidents, yet improved capital buffers), the calibrated probabilities lean heavily on the 0 or 1 failure outcomes. Although the expert commentary does nudge us to allocate a modest probability to outcomes of 2 failures, the probability for 3+ failures remains low and is reserved for highly unexpected contagion events.
 Established distributions for early-year bank failures in recent years show a central tendency around 1; the risk of upsets (i.e., unexpected clustering leading to 3+ failures) is modest (perhaps on the order of a few percent). This leads us to allocate probabilities such that small probability shifts (e.g., from 90% to 99% certainty) are not overfit, keeping the projection relatively conservative.

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A ('0'): 48%
Option_B ('1'): 33%
Option_C ('2'): 14%
Option_D ('3+'): 5%
