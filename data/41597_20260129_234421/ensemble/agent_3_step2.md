Analysis:
(a) Source Analysis:
• Bankrate (Dec 20, 2025) and FDIC overviews provide hard, historical data on bank failures (e.g., 0–5 failures per early‐year period) with high reliability.
• Business Insider and San Francisco Fed sources offer additional historical context and expert comments (Dimon’s “cockroach” remark) – these opinions come from respected experts.
• The Asknews articles include several independent reports: the FSB Resolution Report (global regulatory reforms), articles on Banco Master investigations, and a Globe and Mail opinion warning of systemic strains. These range from strong evidence (multiple, reliable independent sources noting systemic stress signals and credit issues) to weaker evidence (anecdotal or opinion pieces with speculative connections).
• Some sources (e.g., the FDIC signage rule update or unrelated baseball scheduling) are non-relevant.
Overall, the factual historical data (via FDIC and Bankrate) is backed by expert opinions from reputable outlets (Morningstar, The Globe and Mail), with a mixture of clear data and expert interpretation.

(b) Evidence Analysis:
• Strong evidence: Historical Jan–Apr reference class for post-crisis years (excluding the crisis 2023) gives a baseline of 36% for 0, 18% for 1, 27% for 2, and 18% for 3+ failures.
• Moderate evidence: Recent reports (Morningstar, DBRS) highlight rising credit issues and stress among regional banks, shifting the expectation modestly toward at least one failure.
• Weak evidence: Anecdotal intra–period timing (8 days with no failure) offers limited downward adjustment.
These factors, taken together, support increasing the likelihood of a 1–failure event while not heavily favoring an outbreak of multiple simultaneous failures.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Prediction timeframe is January 1 to April 30, 2026 (approximately 120 days, with 91 days remaining as of today, January 29, 2026). If the timeframe were halved (e.g., Jan–Feb), chances for failures might drop because early months see fewer events; if doubled, additional time could allow a higher count with more room for delays and cascading stresses.

(d) Justification:
• Historical patterns (post-crisis 2014–2025 excluding atypical 2023) provide a baseline distribution: 0 (36%), 1 (18%), 2 (27%), 3+ (18%). 
• Recent elevated credit stress and expert signals (e.g., DBRS and Dimon’s “cockroach” analogy) push probability somewhat toward at least one failure.
• However, improvements seen in 2024–2025 (averaging around 1 failure) and 8 days into 2026 with no event support a tempered adjustment.
Thus, the calibration becomes: 0 failures lowered slightly to 32%, 1 failure increased to 35%, 2 failures decreased to 23%, and 3+ failures reduced to 10%.

Probability calibration:
Starting from an outside view with base rates from the relevant reference class, I applied moderate upward pressure for one failure due to indicators of stress and small bank vulnerability while acknowledging the absence of a full-blown crisis. This yields the adjusted distribution above.

Checklist:
1. Options and timeframe: Predicting 0, 1, 2, or 3+ US bank failures from Jan through Apr 2026; 120-day period.
2. Outside view base rate: Derived from post–crisis normal years (2014–2025, excluding 2023) – initially 36%, 18%, 27%, 18%.
3. Consistency check: Most likely = 1 failure; least likely = 3+ failures; aligns with analysis.
4. Key evidence (under 20 words each):
   – Historical early-year failure counts indicate small numbers.
   – Elevated credit stresses and expert warnings from multiple sources.
   – Recent minor failures in 2024–2025 and no failures in first 8 days of 2026.
5. Blind spot: A sudden market shock (e.g., rapid rate hikes triggering bank runs) could shift outcomes upward.
6. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100, remain within 0–100, no percent signs.
