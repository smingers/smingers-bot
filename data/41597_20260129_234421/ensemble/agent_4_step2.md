Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

1. FDIC Failed Bank List (primary dataset, updated continuously; last entry 27 Jun 2025). Purely factual, regulatory source; highest reliability; no opinions.
2. Bankrate 20 Dec 2025 article – journalist compiles FDIC data 2009-25. Facts mirror FDIC list; minor commentary; medium-high quality.
3. Business Insider 14 Mar 2025 – historical context, causes of 2023 failures, quotes academics. Facts largely FDIC-based; opinions from identifiable experts; medium quality.
4. JD Supra / GAO 6 Jan 2026 – GAO report on FHLBanks; factual; high quality for structural liquidity back-stop information.
5. Globe & Mail 29 Jan 2026 opinion – warns of systemic fragility, cites $85 bn NY-Fed liquidity injections and Fed staffing cuts. Author is financial journalist; data on liquidity injections un-corroborated elsewhere (so treated as single-source opinion).
6. AP 17 Oct 2025, BeInCrypto 17 Oct 2025 – document regional bank credit losses and equity sell-off; factual but dated; still relevant for trend.
7. JD Supra 28 Jan 2026 – FDIC signage rule; operational, not failure-related.
8. Local news (U.S. Bank payroll glitch, MLK-Day closures, U.S. Bank Stadium schedule) – operational or holiday pieces; irrelevant to solvency.
Overall: only the FDIC/Bankrate/Business Insider streams supply hard numbers on failures; macro-stress pieces (Globe & Mail, AP) give single-source or older signals of elevated risk.

(b) Evidence analysis (scored using rubric)

• Strong evidence
  – Historical frequency 2020-25: early-year (Jan-Apr) failures 0-2 in five of six years; structural reforms, high bank capital (multiple independent sources).  
  – FDIC list shows zero U.S. bank failures 1 Jan-28 Jan 2026.  
• Moderate evidence
  – 2023 crisis showed 3 large failures in March, demonstrating that clusters can happen quickly when rates rise (single period but recent).  
  – Opinion–backed data on NY-Fed $85 bn liquidity injections since Oct 2025 (single source; plausible but unconfirmed) suggests discreet stress.  
  – CRE delinquency >4.6 % (FDIC Risk Review, Oct 2025) – recognized tail-risk; indirect link to near-term failures.  
• Weak evidence
  – Headlines on regulatory staffing cuts, signage rule, holiday bank closures – speculative or irrelevant inside 90-day window.  
  – Foreign stories (Banco Master) – different jurisdiction.

Net direction: keeps base rate low but nudges tail up slightly.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days until 1 May 2026 resolution: 93.  
If window were halved (≈46 days), likelihood of any failure falls ~30-40 %; if doubled (to Aug 31), probabilities of 2 and 3+ would climb materially (roughly ×1.5), reflecting typical mid-year uptick.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
1. Base rate (2020-25 Jan-Apr):   P(0)=51, P(1)=34, P(2)=12, P(3+)=3.  
2. Up-risk factors: elevated CRE stress, evidence (even if single-source) of large-bank liquidity taps, lingering regional-bank equity weakness. Add ~4 pp to combined 2 & 3+ bucket.  
3. Down-risk factors: Zero failures year-to-date, stabilising policy rate path (Fed expected to hold), FHLBank/discount-window liquidity readily available. Subtract ~2 pp from ≥1 bucket.  
Resulting calibrated distribution (rounded):

Probability calibration
0 failures 45  
1 failure  34  
2 failures 15  
3 +     6  
(Sum = 100)

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: number of U.S. bank failures logged by FDIC from 1 Jan–30 Apr 2026: 0, 1, 2, or 3+.  
2. Outside view used: 48/33/14/5.  
3. Consistency: Most-likely = 0; least-likely = 3+ — aligns with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) 0 failures to date; b) 2020-25 Jan-Apr counts 0-2; c) CRE delinquency rising; d) unconfirmed $85 bn Fed liquidity support; e) ample back-stop liquidity (FHLB, BTFP).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden confidence shock (e.g., large-scale uninsured-deposit run) in March earnings season producing multiple closures >3; would raise 3+ materially.  
6. Technicalities: probs 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [45, 34, 15, 6]
