Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most relevant first)

1. FDIC Failed Bank List (primary data, updated continuously; last failure 27 Jun 2025). Pure fact; gold-standard reliability; no 2026 entries yet.
2. Bankrate 20 Dec 2025 recap of 2009-2025 failures. Secondary but fact-based, fully sourced to FDIC; separates data from author opinion (“few banks usually fail” – mild, non-expert opinion).
3. GAO 17 Dec 2025 report on FHLBanks. Factual statistics on bank borrowing and risk correlations; methodology described; high quality; indirectly relevant.
4. AP 17 Oct 2025 + BeInCrypto follow-ups on October regional-bank sell-off. Facts: loan write-offs, KBW index – reliable; opinions from Jamie Dimon, analysts (identified experts).
5. Globe & Mail 29 Jan 2026 opinion piece on “systemic fragility.” Largely commentary; facts quoted: NY Fed emergency cash injections ($85 B since Oct-25) – verifiable; author is experienced journalist but not a regulator.
6. JD Supra 22 & 29 Jan 2026 legal notes (FSB resolution report; FDIC signage rule). Authoritative but peripheral—no solvency signals.
7. Misc. holiday/ stadium / payroll-delay articles. Operational, not solvency-related; ignored for forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong
• FDIC data 2016-2025: Jan-Apr failures distribution = 0 (5/10 yrs), 1 (2/10), 2 (2/10), 3+ (1/10).  
• 29 days of 2026 elapsed with zero failures (direct evidence on the variable).

Moderate
• October-25 regional-bank stress (loan losses, KBW –7 %). Signals sectoral weakness but did not trigger failures.  
• $85 B NY Fed cash injections to large banks since Oct-25 – suggests pockets of liquidity strain.

Weak
• Opinion pieces warning of regulatory rollback, FDIC staffing cuts, CRE exposure. Causal chain plausible but timing uncertain (may materialise after April).

(c) Time-frame analysis
• Forecast window remaining: 92 days (Feb 1-Apr 30 2026).  
If the window were halved (46 days), my Poisson mean would drop roughly 50 %, pushing ‘0’ toward ~60 %.  
If doubled to eight months, mean would rise proportionally; ‘3+’ would overtake ‘0’.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments

1. Base-rate (outside view) Poisson(λ = 1.0) after 2016-2025 data → 37 / 37 / 18 / 8 %.  
2. Zero failures through 29 Jan knocks λ down ~10 % (historically only 27 % of Jan-Apr failures occur before 29 Jan).  
3. Credit-quality warnings (CRE, regional-bank write-offs, Fed liquidity) argue for fatter right tail; add 2 pp to ‘3+’, funded from ‘1’.  
4. Macro still stable, only two tiny failures in all 2024-25; this tempers any large upward shift.

Probability calibration (inside view)
‘0’ 45 — quiet first month + low 2024-25 totals  
‘1’ 30 — typical single small bank scenario  
‘2’ 17 — possibility of paired small/medium failures (e.g., 2025 pattern)  
‘3+’  8 — low-frequency clustering risk (cf. Mar 2023; Jan-Apr 2017)

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: number of U.S. banks closed by FDIC 1 Jan-30 Apr 2026: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3+.  
2. Outside view: 38 / 30 / 22 / 10 %.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = 0, least likely = 3+ – coherent with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 0 failures so far; (ii) 2016-25 Jan-Apr stats; (iii) Oct-25 loan-loss episode; (iv) NY Fed emergency funding; (v) only 2 small 2025 failures.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden CRE meltdown or rapid deposit run at a mid-size regional bank (SVB-style) in March could push tally to 3+, making probabilities too low on tail.  
6. Technicalities: Numbers 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [45, 30, 17, 8]
