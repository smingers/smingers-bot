Notes March 2023 \"regional banking turmoil\" as comparison point. **Quality: Excellent (Federal Reserve research, confirms April 2025 stress event)**\\n\\n7. **Agent Report** - Provides Jan-Apr failure counts for 2012-2025:\\n   - 2025: 1 (Pulaski Savings Bank on Jan 17)\\n   - 2024: 1\\n   - 2023: 2 (SVB Mar 10, Signature Mar 12)\\n   - 2022: 0\\n   - 2021: 0\\n   - 2020: 2\\n   - 2019: 0\\n   - 2018: 0\\n   - 2017: 3\\n   - 2016: 2\\n   - 2015: 4\\n   - 2014: 6\\n   - 2013: 10\\n   - 2012: 25\\n   \\n   Also notes 2005-2006 had zero failures. Identifies 2009-2013 as Great Recession aftermath with highest Jan-Apr counts.\\n   **Quality: Good (synthesizes FDIC data, though some years 2001-2011 incomplete)**\\n\\n**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**\\n\\n**Possible reference classes:**\\n\\n1. **All Jan-Apr periods (2001-2025)** - Most comprehensive but includes crisis periods (2009-2013) that may not be representative of current environment.\\n\\n2. **Post-crisis \"normal\" years (2014-2025)** - Excludes Great Recession aftermath. Jan-Apr counts: 6, 4, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1. Average: 1.75 failures per Jan-Apr period.\\n\\n3. **Recent stable period (2018-2025, excluding 2023 crisis)** - Years: 2018(0), 2019(0), 2020(2), 2021(0), 2022(0), 2024(1), 2025(1). Average: 0.57 failures.\\n\\n4. **Post-2023 crisis period (2024-2025)** - Only 2 years: 2024(1), 2025(1). Average: 1.0 failure.\\n\\n**Most suitable reference class:** Post-crisis \"normal\" years (2014-2025) provides the best balance - it\\'s recent enough to reflect current regulatory environment (post-Dodd-Frank), excludes the extreme Great Recession period, but includes enough data points (12 years) for statistical meaning. It also includes the 2023 crisis and its aftermath, which is relevant given we\\'re forecasting for 2026.\\n\\n**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**\\n\\n**Prediction timeframe:** January 1 - April 30, 2026 (4 months). As of January 29, 2026, we are 8 days into the period with approximately 92 days remaining.\\n\\n**Historical patterns for Jan-Apr periods (2014-2025):**\\n- Distribution: 0 failures (4 years), 1 failure (2 years), 2 failures (3 years), 3 failures (1 year), 4 failures (1 year), 6 failures (1 year)\\n- Median: 1.5 failures\\n- Mode: 0 failures\\n- 33% had 0 failures\\n- 17% had 1 failure\\n- 25% had 2 failures\\n- 25% had 3+ failures\\n\\n**Seasonal patterns:** No clear evidence of seasonal concentration, though some stress events (2023 crisis) occurred in March.\\n\\n**(d) Justification:**\\n\\n**Current environment (as of Jan 29, 2026):**\\n- No failures have occurred yet in Jan 2026 (only 8 days have passed)\\n- The financial system experienced stress in April 2025 from tariff announcements, but Treasury markets and bank stocks recovered by late summer 2025\\n- Credit concerns emerged in late 2025 (fraud at Zions/Western Alliance, bankruptcies affecting JPMorgan, Fifth Third, First Citizens)\\n- DBRS expects \"more delinquencies and loan losses in coming quarters\" but sees banks as \"well positioned to absorb\" them\\n- The system has been through significant stress-testing since 2023 crisis; regulatory oversight is heightened\\n- Recent pattern: 2024 and 2025 each had exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure\\n\\n**Key factors:**\\n1. **Base rate from suitable reference class (2014-2025):** Average of 1.75 Jan-Apr failures\\n2. **Recent trend (2024-2025):** Exactly 1 failure each year in Jan-Apr period\\n3. **Current stress indicators:** Moderate (credit concerns, but no systemic crisis signals)\\n4. **Time already elapsed:** 8 days into 122-day period with 0 failures so far\\n5. **Regulatory environment:** Heightened scrutiny post-2023 crisis likely catches problems earlier\\n6. **Expert opinions:** DBRS and Morningstar analysts expect stress but not crisis-level failures\\n\\n**Distribution reasoning:**\\n- 0 failures: Plausible given no failures yet and 33% historical rate in reference class. However, credit stress indicators suggest some risk remains.\\n- 1 failure: Most likely given recent 2024-2025 pattern and median historical outcome\\n- 2 failures: Moderately likely given 25% historical rate and current credit concerns\\n- 3+ failures: Less likely absent crisis conditions, but 25% historical rate suggests non-negligible probability\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\n**(a) True probability vs. hedged projection:**\\nI must avoid both overconfidence (assigning 90%+ to single outcome) and excessive hedging (spreading probabilities too evenly). The historical data shows real variation, so uncertainty is warranted.\\n\\n**(b) Previously established distributions:**\\nThe 2014-2025 reference class provides an empirical distribution:\\n- 0 failures: 33% (4/12 years)\\n- 1 failure: 17% (2/12 years)  \\n- 2 failures: 25% (3/12 years)\\n- 3+ failures: 25% (3/12 years, specifically: 3, 4, and 6 failures)\\n\\n**(c) Small probability differences:**\\nThe difference between 40% and 50% is meaningful - it represents changing from 3:2 odds to even odds. I should be precise.\\n\\n**(d) Rate of upsets:**\\nIn the 2014-2025 period, \"unexpected\" outcomes (deviating from the 1-2 failure range) occurred 50% of the time (6/12 years had either 0 or 3+ failures). This suggests significant uncertainty remains appropriate. However, the 2024-2025 consecutive years of exactly 1 failure suggests some stability in the current regime.\\n\\n**Calibration adjustments from base distribution:**\\n\\nStarting with empirical 2014-2025 distribution (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%), I adjust for:\\n\\n1. **Recent trend weight (+):** 2024-2025 both had exactly 1 failure \u2192 increase \"1\" probability\\n2. **Time elapsed (-):** 8 days with 0 failures \u2192 slight decrease in 3+ probability\\n3. **Credit stress indicators (+):** Moderate stress suggests avoiding overweight on \"0\"\\n4. **Expert consensus (neutral to +):** Expects stress but not crisis \u2192 supports 1-2 range\\n\\n**Final calibration:**\\n- Shift ~10% from \"0\" to \"1\" (recent pattern is strong signal)\\n- Shift ~5% from \"3+\" to \"2\" (no crisis indicators, time elapsed)\\n- Result: Lower \"0\" and \"3+\" relative to base, higher \"1\" and maintain \"2\"\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\n0: 26%\\n1: 38%\\n2: 24%\\n3+: 12%', step2_output='# Analysis\\n\\n## (a) Source Analysis\\n\\n**Primary Sources:**\\n\\n1. **Bankrate Article (Dec 20, 2025)** - Comprehensive historical data showing 2 failures in 2025 (Pulaski Jan 17, Santa Anna Jun 27), 2 in 2024, 5 in 2023. Factual data sourced from FDIC. **Quality: Excellent - recent, factual, authoritative**\\n\\n2. **FDIC Resources** - Official government data confirming 570-572 total failures since 2000. **Quality: Excellent - primary source**\\n\\n**Current News (Jan 2026):**\\n\\n3. **Globe and Mail Opinion (Jan 29, 2026)** - Chris Gay (former WSJ) reports $85B emergency Fed cash infusions to unnamed banks since Oct 2025, relaxed transaction limits in Dec, 30% Fed supervision staff cuts under Bowman. **Opinion piece but cites specific factual claims about Fed actions. Quality: Moderate-Good - concerning if factual, but single source**\\n\\n4. **BaFin Warning (Jan 28, 2026)** - German regulator warns of \"sudden corrections\" risk in 2026, citing \"fragile and uncertain\" markets despite \"buoyant\" mood. Notes German banking sector \"quite profitable.\" **Quality: Good - expert regulatory opinion, but focused on Germany/global markets**\\n\\n5. **FSB Resolution Report (Jan 29, 2026)** - Reviews 2023 bank failures, confirms resolution frameworks in place, no new U.S. failures mentioned. **Quality: Excellent - international regulatory body assessment**\\n\\n6. **FDIC Signage Rule (Jan 22, 2026)** - Administrative rule on ATM/digital signage. No relevance to failures. **Quality: N/A for this question**\\n\\n**Brazilian Bank Context:**\\n7. **Banco Master Investigation (Jan 29, 2026)** - Brazilian bank liquidated Nov 2025, R$12B fraud investigation. Not a U.S. bank. **Quality: N/A - wrong jurisdiction**\\n\\n**October 2025 Regional Bank Concerns:**\\n8. **Regional Bank Stress Articles (Oct 17-30, 2025)** - Multiple sources report fraud at Zions/Western Alliance, KBW Bank Index down 7%, JPMorgan CEO warning, but FDIC confirmed only 2 small failures in 2025 (assets <$70M). DBRS analysts expect \"higher delinquencies\" but banks \"well positioned to absorb losses.\" **Quality: Good - documented market stress but no actual failures resulted**\\n\\n9. **FDIC Acting Chair Hill (Oct 15, 2025)** - Announced expansion of nonbank bidders for failed banks, pre-qualification pilot launching Jan 2026. Indicates FDIC preparing for potential failures. **Quality: Good - factual regulatory development**\\n\\n**Key Factual Findings:**\\n- **No U.S. bank failures reported in January 2026 so far** (as of Jan 29)\\n- Fed emergency lending and supervision cuts are concerning but unverified by multiple sources\\n- October 2025 stress did NOT result in failures\\n- Regulatory preparation for failures (Hill\\'s changes) suggests awareness of risk\\n\\n## (b) Evidence Analysis\\n\\n**Strong Evidence:**\\n1. **Historical pattern stability (2024-2025)**: Two consecutive years with exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure each. This represents a stable post-2023-crisis equilibrium. **Impact: Strongly supports \"1\" outcome**\\n\\n2. **Zero failures in Jan 2026 so far**: 8 days elapsed with no failures reduces probability of multiple failures in remaining 92 days, especially given failures tend to be discrete events. **Impact: Moderately reduces \"3+\" probability**\\n\\n**Moderate Evidence:**\\n3. **October 2025 stress that didn\\'t produce failures**: Market sold off 7%, fraud revelations occurred, yet no actual bank failures resulted. Suggests system resilience despite stress. **Impact: Moderately supports lower failure counts (0-1 range)**\\n\\n4. **Fed emergency lending claims ($85B since Oct 2025)**: If true, indicates significant but contained stress at large banks. Single source (Globe and Mail opinion), unconfirmed. Large banks rarely fail outright due to TBTF. **Impact: Weak to moderate - raises uncertainty but unclear relevance to small/regional bank failures**\\n\\n5. **FDIC preparation for failures (Hill\\'s Oct 2025 announcement)**: Expanding nonbank bidders and pre-qualification pilot suggests FDIC expects potential failures. However, this is precautionary planning, not prediction. **Impact: Weak - indicates awareness but not imminent risk**\\n\\n**Weak Evidence:**\\n6. **BaFin warning about global markets**: German regulator\\'s concern about \"sudden corrections\" is generic, not U.S.-specific, and German banks are \"quite profitable.\" **Impact: Minimal - too general**\\n\\n7. **Fed supervision staff cuts**: 30% reduction is concerning for long-term oversight but unlikely to cause failures in 4-month window (Jan-Apr 2026). **Impact: Minimal for this timeframe**\\n\\n**Evidence Not Considered:**\\n- Brazilian bank failures (wrong jurisdiction)\\n- FDIC signage rules (administrative)\\n- U.S. Bank payroll error (operational issue, not solvency)\\n\\n## (c) Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n**Prediction window**: January 1 - April 30, 2026 (122 days total; 92 days remaining as of Jan 29)\\n\\n**Already elapsed**: 8 days (6.6%) with 0 failures observed\\n\\n**If timeframe halved (2 months instead of 4)**:\\n- Would significantly increase \"0\" probability (shorter window = less opportunity for failures)\\n- Historical data shows failures are discrete events, not evenly distributed\\n- Estimate: 0\u219240%, 1\u219240%, 2\u219215%, 3+\u21925%\\n\\n**If timeframe doubled (8 months instead of 4)**:\\n- Would significantly increase \"2\" and \"3+\" probabilities\\n- More time for credit stress to materialize into failures\\n- Estimate: 0\u219215%, 1\u219230%, 2\u219230%, 3+\u219225%\\n\\n**Temporal dynamics**: Bank failures are typically lagging indicators of financial stress. The Oct 2025 stress would most likely manifest in Q1-Q2 2026 if it leads to failures. We\\'re in that window now.\\n\\n## (d) Justification\\n\\n**Starting point: Outside view base rate (2014-2025)**\\n- 0: 33%, 1: 17%, 2: 25%, 3+: 25%\\n\\n**Key factors shifting prediction:**\\n\\n1. **Strong recent pattern (2024-2025)**: Two consecutive years of exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure represents the most recent and relevant data. This is a more stable regime than the broader 2014-2025 period which includes the 2023 crisis outlier. **Shift: +20% to \"1\", -10% from \"0\", -5% from \"2\", -5% from \"3+\"**\\n\\n2. **Time elapsed with no failures**: 8 days into period with zero failures reduces tail risk. While not highly diagnostic (only 6.6% of period), it does provide weak Bayesian update against \"3+\" scenarios. **Shift: -3% from \"3+\", +1% to \"0\", +2% to \"1\"**\\n\\n3. **October 2025 stress that resolved without failures**: This is a critical data point. Market stress, fraud revelations, and credit concerns did NOT produce failures. This suggests either: (a) problems were contained/resolved, or (b) failures are lagging and coming in Q1 2026. Given 8 days with no failures, (a) seems more likely. **Shift: +5% to \"0\", -3% from \"3+\"**\\n\\n4. **Unverified Fed emergency lending**: The $85B emergency lending claim is concerning but from single opinion source. If true, it suggests stress at large banks (which rarely fail). If false, it\\'s noise. Given uncertainty, minimal weight. **Shift: +2% to \"2\" (hedge against unknown unknowns)**\\n\\n5. **FDIC proactive preparation**: Hill\\'s October announcement suggests FDIC awareness of risk, but this is prudent planning, not prediction. **Shift: Neutral, already captured in base rates**\\n\\n**Net adjustments from base rate (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%):**\\n- 0: +6% \u2192 39%\\n- 1: +23% \u2192 40%\\n- 2: +2% \u2192 27%\\n- 3+: -11% \u2192 14%\\n\\n**Sanity check**: The 2024-2025 pattern is the strongest signal. Both years had exactly 1 failure. The current environment shows stress indicators but no actual failures yet. The October stress resolved without failures. This justifies concentrating probability on 0-1 range while maintaining meaningful probability on 2-3+ given historical variance.\\n\\n**Are current circumstances sufficiently different to override reference class?**\\nNo. The 2014-2025 reference class includes the 2023 crisis and post-crisis period, which is highly relevant. Current circumstances (moderate credit stress, regulatory awareness, no failures yet) fit within this reference class. The adjustment toward \"1\" is justified by the strong recent pattern, not by circumstances being fundamentally different.\\n\\n# Probability Calibration\\n\\n**Initial distribution from outside view**: 0\u219239%, 1\u219240%, 2\u219227%, 3+\u219214%\\n\\n**Calibration considerations:**\\n\\n**(a) True probability vs. hedged projection**: My analysis genuinely supports concentration in the 0-1 range (79% combined). The recent pattern is strong, and no failures have occurred yet. However, the 21% assigned to 2-3+ reflects real historical variance and unresolved credit concerns. This is not excessive hedging.\\n\\n**(b) Significance of small probability differences**: \\n- 40% vs. 39% is essentially a tie, reflecting genuine uncertainty between \"0\" and \"1\"\\n- 27% for \"2\" represents 1-in-4 odds, which aligns with historical frequency (25% in base period)\\n- 14% for \"3+\" represents 1-in-7 odds, down from historical 25% due to current conditions\\n\\n**(c) Blind spots and confidence adjustment**:\\n\\n**Potential blind spots:**\\n1. **Lagging failures from Oct 2025 stress**: If the Oct stress is still working through the system, failures could cluster in Feb-Mar 2026. This would push toward \"2\" or \"3+\".\\n2. **Unverified Fed emergency lending**: If the $85B claim is accurate and indicates hidden stress at multiple institutions, we could see cascading failures.\\n3. **Regulatory capacity**: If Fed supervision cuts are impacting real-time monitoring, problems could go undetected until failure.\\n\\n**Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly**: A cluster of 3-4 regional bank failures in February-March 2026 due to delayed recognition of Oct 2025 credit problems, particularly in CRE or commercial lending portfolios.\\n\\n**Confidence adjustment**: Given these blind spots center on underestimating tail risk, I should slightly increase \"2\" and \"3+\" at expense of \"1\":\\n- Shift -3% from \"1\" to \"2\" (+2%) and \"3+\" (+1%)\\n\\n**Final calibrated distribution**:\\n- 0: 39%\\n- 1: 37%\\n- 2: 23%\\n- 3+: 1%\\n\\nWait - this doesn\\'t sum to 100%. Let me recalculate:\\n\\nStarting: 0\u219239%, 1\u219240%, 2\u219227%, 3+\u219214% (sums to 120%, error in my addition)\\n\\nLet me recalculate from base rates properly:\\n\\n**Base rate (2014-2025)**: 0\u219233%, 1\u219217%, 2\u219225%, 3+\u219225%\\n\\n**Adjustments**:\\n- Recent pattern (2024-2025): +15% to \"1\", -8% from \"0\", -4% from \"2\", -3% from \"3+\"\\n- Time elapsed: +2% to \"0\", +1% to \"1\", -3% from \"3+\"\\n- Oct stress resolved: +3% to \"0\", -2% from \"2\", -1% from \"3+\"\\n- Blind spot hedge: -2% from \"1\", +1% to \"2\", +1% to \"3+\"\\n\\n**Final calculation**:\\n- 0: 33% - 8% + 2% + 3% = 30%\\n- 1: 17% + 15% + 1% - 2% = 31%\\n- 2: 25% - 4% - 2% + 1% = 20%\\n- 3+: 25% - 3% - 3% - 1% + 1% = 19%\\n\\nSum check: 30 + 31 + 20 + 19 = 100% \u2713\\n\\n# Checklist\\n\\n1. **Paraphrase**: Count U.S. bank failures Jan 1 - Apr 30, 2026, per FDIC Failed Bank List. Options: 0, 1, 2, or 3+ failures.\\n\\n2. **Base rate alignment**: Started with 2014-2025 distribution (33%, 17%, 25%, 25%), adjusted moderately for recent pattern and current conditions. Final prediction (30%, 31%, 20%, 19%) remains rooted to this base.\\n\\n3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = 0 or 1 (61% combined); Least likely = none clearly separated. This makes sense given recent 2024-2025 pattern of exactly 1 failure each year, but acknowledges historical variance.\\n\\n4. **Top evidence pieces**:\\n   - 2024-2025: exactly 1 Jan-Apr failure each year (strong pattern)\\n   - Zero failures in first 8 days of Jan 2026 (weak update)\\n   - Oct 2025 stress resolved without failures (moderate resilience signal)\\n   - Historical variance: 50% of 2014-2025 years had 0 or 3+ (uncertainty remains)\\n   - Unverified Fed emergency lending claims (potential hidden stress)\\n\\n5. **Blind spot**: Lagging failures from Oct 2025 credit stress materializing in Feb-Mar 2026, producing 3-4 failures. Would make \"3+\" look underweighted.

However, these affected larger banks that absorbed losses rather than failed.\\n2. **Small bank vulnerability**: Both 2025 failures were very small institutions (<$65M assets). Small community banks remain most vulnerable.\\n3. **No acute crisis**: Unlike 2023 (deposit runs) or 2008-2012 (systemic crisis), current environment shows stress but not panic.\\n4. **Time already elapsed**: 8 days into the period with no failures slightly reduces probability of higher counts.\\n5. **DBRS forward guidance**: Expert opinion from credit rating agency expecting deterioration suggests risk is elevated above recent 2024-2025 baseline.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests we\\'re in a transitional period - not as benign as 2018-2022 (mostly zero failures) but not approaching crisis levels. The credit problems documented are real but manageable for the system. Most likely outcome is 0-2 failures of small institutions.\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\nStarting with the reference class base rates (2014-2025 ex-2023):\\n- 0: 36%\\n- 1: 18%\\n- 2: 27%\\n- 3+: 18%\\n\\n**Calibration adjustments:**\\n\\n1. **Recent trend toward fewer failures**: 2024-2025 averaged 1 failure each, suggesting the baseline may be shifting lower. This increases probability of 0-1 outcomes.\\n\\n2. **Credit stress signals**: Multiple documented problems in late 2025 suggest risk is elevated above the 2024-2025 baseline but below 2014-2017 levels. This slightly increases probability of 1-2 outcomes relative to 0.\\n\\n3. **Time elapsed**: 8 days with no failures provides weak evidence toward lower end of distribution, though not decisive given failures can cluster.\\n\\n4. **Expert forward guidance**: DBRS expecting more losses suggests above-baseline risk, but their assessment is for \"regional banks well positioned to absorb\" - meaning stress without systemic failure risk.\\n\\n5. **Size of recent failures**: The tiny size of 2025 failures ($50-65M assets) suggests any 2026 failures likely to be similarly small, numerous small banks remain vulnerable.\\n\\n6. **Historical upset rate**: In this domain, upsets are relatively uncommon in stable periods. The 2023 crisis was a genuine surprise, but represented a unique confluence of factors (rapid rate hikes + concentrated deposits + poor risk management). Current conditions don\\'t suggest similar tail risk.\\n\\n**Probability distribution reasoning:**\\n\\n- **0 failures**: Should be most likely given recent trend, but credit stress reduces this from 36% baseline to ~32%\\n- **1 failure**: Elevated from 18% baseline to ~35% given documented stress and pattern of small bank vulnerability\\n- **2 failures**: Slight reduction from 27% baseline to ~23% - possible but requires two separate situations to materialize\\n- **3+ failures**: Reduced from 18% baseline to ~10% - would require either a cluster of small bank failures or an unexpected shock\\n\\nThese probabilities reflect: (a) continuation of low-failure environment from 2024-2025, (b) modest elevation in risk from documented credit problems, (c) absence of systemic crisis indicators, (d) small bank vulnerability persisting.\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\n0: 32%\\n1: 35%\\n2: 23%\\n3+: 10%', step2_output='Analysis:\\n\\n## (a) Source Analysis\\n\\n**Historical/Factual Sources:**\\n1. **Bankrate (20 Dec 2025)**: Journalistic summary of 2025 failures (2 banks: Pulaski Savings, Santa Anna National).

Source Analysis:\\n\\u2003\u2022 FDIC Failed Bank List excerpts (dated Jun 27, 2025) and the FDIC statistical breakdown provide reliable historical counts of bank failures and their monthly distributions. The factual details (names, dates, counts) are directly from the FDIC and are the backbone of historical reference\u2010class data. They do not include any opinions.\\n\\u2003\u2022 The Bankrate article (Dec 20, 2025) gives a clear factual recounting of bank failures in 2025, showing two failures in that year, and provides a historical perspective from 2009\u20132025. Although it contains descriptive commentary, its numbers on the recent failure counts are fact\u2010checked against FDIC sources.\\n\\u2003\u2022 The San Francisco Fed article (Nov 2025) and the Morningstar article (Nov 2025) offer macroeconomic context and market commentary. They include expert opinions (e.g., from Jamie Dimon, Marc Rowan) that signal stress factors such as trade shocks and deposit-run concerns. These opinions are from well\u2010identified experts and thus are useful for understanding the broader risk environment.\\n\\u2003\u2022 The Liberty Street Economics piece (Nov 2025) further details market conditions, liquidity, and volatility. Its factual discussion of Treasury market metrics and comparison points (such as reference to March 2023 turmoil) help bracket the range of stress scenarios affecting banks.\\n\\u2003\u2022 The Agent Report synthesizing the historical counts (2001\u20132025) with macro explanation provides both quantitative benchmarks (notably the concentrated failures in crisis years) and a narrative context explaining why early\u2010year failure \u201cspikes\u201d occurred (e.g., during the Great Recession, post\u2013housing downturn, COVID downturn, and the 2023 interest\u2010rate shock).\\n\\nOverall, the FDIC sources are the most fact\u2010based while the financial commentary from the Fed and Morningstar adds important macro-financial context. All sources are recent (late 2025) and directly address past outcomes that inform our reference class for predicting 2026 outcomes.\\n\\n2. Reference Class Analysis:\\n\\u2003\u2022 One reference class is the cluster of recent years (2020\u20132025) in which the January\u2013April bank failure counts ranged between 0 and 2. This class is especially relevant because it reflects the current regime, post\u2013COVID market stabilization, and heightened but not extreme interest\u2010rate environments.\\n\\u2003\u2022 A more \u201ccrisis\u201d reference class is provided by the years during and immediately following the Great Recession and the housing crisis (e.g., 2012 with an exceptionally high count and 2013 with 10 failures). However, these crisis numbers seem less relevant given that systemic reforms and improved bank capitalizations have taken hold since then.\\n\\u2003\u2022 The most suitable reference class for forecasting Jan\u2013April 2026 failures is the recent calm to moderately stressful period of 2020\u20132025, adjusted for current expert commentary about deposit-run dynamics and residual credit market pressures, but without anticipating a full-blown crisis.\\n\\n3. Timeframe Analysis:\\n\\u2003The prediction covers bank failures occurring from January 1 to April 30, 2026. As today is January 29, 2026, approximately 3 more months remain until the outcome is finalized. Historical patterns over these 4-month early-year windows in the recent era (2020\u20132025) demonstrate low counts (0\u20132 failures in most years), with occasional small spikes when macro conditions (e.g., interest-rate hikes or market shocks) intervene.\\n\\n4. Justification:\\n\\u2003Integrating the above, the base rate from recent years suggests that a single failure (or none) is the most common outcome. However, caution is warranted due to continuing macroeconomic risks: the lingering impact of recent interest-rate shocks, occasional depositor concerns, and market uncertainties highlighted in the Fed and Morningstar articles. While a severe crisis akin to 2012 or 2013 appears unlikely (since reforms and improved bank resiliency have taken hold), the possibility of one or two additional failures cannot be ruled out entirely.\\n\\u2003Given that for Jan\u2013Apr periods in 2023 and 2020, we saw counts of 2, but also several instances of zero or one in adjacent years, the outside view prediction must hedge toward the less extreme outcomes. In particular, the \u201c3+\u201d option is reserved for true systemic stress events, which although possible, are less likely given the current environment and expert outlook.\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\u2003Based on historical reference class (with 0\u20132 failures being the norm in the recent post-crisis period) plus expert indicators of moderate residual market stress (evidenced by past deposit-run incidents, yet improved capital buffers), the calibrated probabilities lean heavily on the 0 or 1 failure outcomes. Although the expert commentary does nudge us to allocate a modest probability to outcomes of 2 failures, the probability for 3+ failures remains low and is reserved for highly unexpected contagion events.\\n\\u2003Established distributions for early-year bank failures in recent years show a central tendency around 1; the risk of upsets (i.e., unexpected clustering leading to 3+ failures) is modest (perhaps on the order of a few percent). This leads us to allocate probabilities such that small probability shifts (e.g., from 90% to 99% certainty) are not overfit, keeping the projection relatively conservative.\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\nOption_A ('0'): 48%\\nOption_B ('1'): 33%\\nOption_C ('2'): 14%\\nOption_D ('3+'): 5%\", step2_output='Analysis:\\n(a) Source Analysis:\\n\u2022 Bankrate (Dec 20, 2025) and FDIC overviews provide hard, historical data on bank failures (e.g., 0\u20135 failures per early\u2010year period) with high reliability.\\n\u2022 Business Insider and San Francisco Fed sources offer additional historical context and expert comments (Dimon\u2019s \u201ccockroach\u201d remark) \u2013 these opinions come from respected experts.\\n\u2022 The Asknews articles include several independent reports: the FSB Resolution Report (global regulatory reforms), articles on Banco Master investigations, and a Globe and Mail opinion warning of systemic strains. These range from strong evidence (multiple, reliable independent sources noting systemic stress signals and credit issues) to weaker evidence (anecdotal or opinion pieces with speculative connections).\\n\u2022 Some sources (e.g., the FDIC signage rule update or unrelated baseball scheduling) are non-relevant.\\nOverall, the factual historical data (via FDIC and Bankrate) is backed by expert opinions from reputable outlets (Morningstar, The Globe and Mail), with a mixture of clear data and expert interpretation.\\n\\n(b) Evidence Analysis:\\n\u2022 Strong evidence: Historical Jan\u2013Apr reference class for post-crisis years (excluding the crisis 2023) gives a baseline of 36% for 0, 18% for 1, 27% for 2, and 18% for 3+ failures.\\n\u2022 Moderate evidence: Recent reports (Morningstar, DBRS) highlight rising credit issues and stress among regional banks, shifting the expectation modestly toward at least one failure.\\n\u2022 Weak evidence: Anecdotal intra\u2013period timing (8 days with no failure) offers limited downward adjustment.\\nThese factors, taken together, support increasing the likelihood of a 1\u2013failure event while not heavily favoring an outbreak of multiple simultaneous failures.\\n\\n(c) Timeframe Analysis:\\nPrediction timeframe is January 1 to April 30, 2026 (approximately 120 days, with 91 days remaining as of today, January 29, 2026). If the timeframe were halved (e.g., Jan\u2013Feb), chances for failures might drop because early months see fewer events; if doubled, additional time could allow a higher count with more room for delays and cascading stresses.\\n\\n(d) Justification:\\n\u2022 Historical patterns (post-crisis 2014\u20132025 excluding atypical 2023) provide a baseline distribution: 0 (36%), 1 (18%), 2 (27%), 3+ (18%). \\n\u2022 Recent elevated credit stress and expert signals (e.g., DBRS and Dimon\u2019s \u201ccockroach\u201d analogy) push probability somewhat toward at least one failure.\\n\u2022 However, improvements seen in 2024\u20132025 (averaging around 1 failure) and 8 days into 2026 with no event support a tempered adjustment.\\nThus, the calibration becomes: 0 failures lowered slightly to 32%, 1 failure increased to 35%, 2 failures decreased to 23%, and 3+ failures reduced to 10%.\\n\\nProbability calibration:\\nStarting from an outside view with base rates from the relevant reference class, I applied moderate upward pressure for one failure due to indicators of stress and small bank vulnerability while acknowledging the absence of a full-blown crisis. This yields the adjusted distribution above.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n1. Options and timeframe: Predicting 0, 1, 2, or 3+ US bank failures from Jan through Apr 2026; 120-day period.\\n2.

Large banks were more exposed to the trade shock than smaller banks.\n\n- **Indirect Exposure Mechanism:** Banks have little direct exposure to trade but may be affected through: (1) lending to borrowers heavily reliant on trade or with extensive foreign supply chains, and (2) broader economic effects of trade policy on all borrowers.\n\n## Analysis Methodology:\n\nThe study used event study methodology examining abnormal stock returns around the April 2, 2025 tariff announcement, controlling for systematic market-wide movements using banks' beta relative to the S&P 500 index.\n\n## Forward-Looking Implications:\n\n- Future trade shocks could raise the risk of financial stress as assessed by market participants\n- The full impact of trade policy on the economy remains uncertain, including effects on cash flows and business performance\n- The financial system remained resilient despite the shock\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/is-there-credit-storm-brewing-us-banks\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Is There a Credit Storm Brewing for US Banks?\"\n\n**Source:** Morningstar, Inc. | **Date:** November 13, 2025 | **Author:** Dan Lefkovitz\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Regional Bank Performance:** The Morningstar US Banks\u2014Regional Index experienced significant volatility over the past year, with postelection gains followed by sharp declines during tariff turmoil in March-April 2025, recovery, and then recent selloffs (September-October 2025).\n\n- **2023 Banking Crisis Reference:** \n  - March 2023: Silicon Valley Bank collapsed\n  - March 2023: Signature Bank failed\n  - May 2023: First Republic Bank failed (second-largest bank failure in US history)\n  - Both SVB and First Republic were top-10 constituents of the Morningstar US Banks\u2013Regional Index as of February 28, 2023\n  - Washington Mutual remains the largest-ever US bank failure (from 2008)\n\n- **Recent Credit Market Problems (2025):**\n  - Tricolor Holdings (subprime auto lender) filed for bankruptcy, causing write-downs at JPMorgan Chase and Fifth Third\n  - First Brands (auto supplier) bankruptcy affected First Citizens Bank\n  - Zions and Western Alliance disclosed they were victims of borrower fraud\n  - Zions' share price dropped 13% in a single day\n  - Western Alliance fell more than 10%\n\n## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:\n\n- **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase CEO):** \"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more\" - suggesting seemingly isolated issues could signal systemic problems\n\n- **Marc Rowan (Apollo CEO):** Referred to credit market issues as \"late-cycle accidents\"\n\n- **Rajiv Bhatia (Morningstar equity analyst):** Acknowledged Zions' write-down \"understandably raises questions about the firm's underwriting and risk management practices.\" The team was already modeling for higher charge-offs and provisioning.\n\n- **Morningstar DBRS (credit rating agency):** \n  - Expects more delinquencies and loan losses in coming quarters from regional banks\n  - Notes banks are tapping a Federal Reserve \"repo facility\" to ensure sufficient liquidity for short-term obligations\n  - Sees regional banks as \"well positioned to absorb higher loan losses\"\n  - Observed deterioration in private debt markets: \"Downgrades continue to outpace upgrades in private credit\"\n\n- **Michael Driscoll and John Mackerey (DBRS researchers):** \"Banks are involved in a confidence business\" and \"rapid withdrawal of funding\" can \"exacerbate existing issues\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Regional banks differ from \"money center\" banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup) by focusing on traditional retail and commercial banking with geographic limitations\n- U.S. Bancorp is the only regional bank with a wide Morningstar Economic Moat Rating and carries a 4-star \"buy\" rating\n- Many regional banks are viewed as no-moat businesses with High Morningstar Uncertainty Ratings\n- Much risky lending is done by NDFIs (nondepository financial institutions), to which banks have exposure\n- The 2023 banking crisis was attributed to poor risk management and concentrated depositor bases rather than systemic credit issues\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/11/how-has-treasury-market-liquidity-fared-in-2025/\">\n# Summary of \"How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Fared in 2025?\"\n\n**Source:** Liberty Street Economics (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)  \n**Date:** November 12, 2025  \n**Author:** Michael J.

No conflicting figures were observed across these sources.\n\nInformation still outstanding  \n\u2022 Numerical: the Jan-Apr subtotals for 2001-2004 and 2007-2011 remain to be mechanically counted.  \n\u2022 Narrative: macro context for 2001-2002 (mild recession and dot-com collapse) can be added once those early-year counts are known and if they exceed the 10-failure threshold (unlikely).\n\nRecommended next action  \nRun a final pivot on the FDIC CSV to populate the eleven missing integers.

The report confirms that foundational resolution frameworks are largely in place and highlights advancements in operational readiness, including the publication of a practices paper on transfer tools, the establishment of a task force on bail-in execution, and enhanced information sharing on funding in resolution. It also summarizes resolvability assessment results for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and central counterparties. Looking ahead, the FSB plans to conduct a peer review of public sector backstop funding mechanisms, publish a practices paper on funding resolution, and launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities.

According to Haddad, the inquiry will evaluate whether any mistakes were made by the Central Bank\u2019s own staff during the process. He made the statement in an interview with Acorda, Metr\u00f3poles, emphasizing that institutions must act transparently when issues arise. The Banco Master is at the center of a Federal Police investigation into a financial fraud scheme allegedly involving approximately R$ 12 billion in irregularly issued Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs). Daniel Vorcaro, the bank\u2019s founder, was arrested during a Federal Police operation. On the same day of Vorcaro\u2019s arrest, the Central Bank placed Banco Master under special administration and declared its extrajudicial liquidation, citing a severe liquidity crisis and the institution\u2019s compromised financial condition. The Central Bank also stated that Banco Master had violated regulations governing financial institutions within the National Financial System.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:49 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/haddad-confirma-investigacao-do-bc-para-apurar-falhas-no-caso-master)\n\n**Central Bank Launches Internal Probe into Banco Master's Extrajudicial Liquidation**\nThe Central Bank of Brazil (BC) has launched an internal investigation into the extrajudicial liquidation of Banco Master, conducted by the bank's internal oversight office (corregedoria) with full autonomy. The probe, initiated immediately after the liquidation in November 2025, aims to identify potential failures in supervision mechanisms and the technical team\u2019s monitoring of the institution\u2019s financial health, particularly regarding delays in detecting high-risk operations. The investigation is confidential and has no set completion date. Two directors from the Department of Banking Supervision (Desup)\u2014Belline Santana and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza\u2014resigned following the probe\u2019s launch. The case has drawn scrutiny from the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF), with the TCU ordering a review of liquidation documents. The BC initially filed appeals but withdrew them on January 12, 2026, after a meeting between TCU President Vital do R\u00eago Filho and BC President Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, allowing the TCU\u2019s review to proceed.

He highlights unusual $85-billion in emergency cash infusions from the New York Federal Reserve to unnamed 'too-big-to-fail' banks since October 2025, coupled with relaxed transaction limits in early December, suggesting possible distress at one or more major institutions. The article warns that these developments, combined with regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration, pose risks to financial stability. Michelle Bowman, the Fed\u2019s vice-chair of supervision, has announced a 30% reduction in Washington-based staff\u2014building on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s planned 10% cut\u2014claiming oversight will remain intact through the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes the move as 'taking more cops off of the Wall Street beat.' Bowman has also rebranded the Division of Supervision and Regulation as the 'business enablement group,' raising concerns about regulatory capture. Meanwhile, the Fed is revising its stress tests, which the previous chair Michael Barr warned would offer 'illusory comfort' in system resilience. Despite strong 2025 results, banks passed these tests under less rigorous standards than the prior year. The retreat from post-2008 regulations began under Trump 1.0 with the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which raised the asset threshold for strict oversight from $50-billion to $250-billion, reducing the number of highly regulated banks from 38 to 12\u2014actions many link to the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Gay warns that financial crises follow a cycle of easy credit, lax regulation, bubble formation, a Minsky moment, government bailouts, and new regulations\u2014only to repeat. He cautions that regulators often prepare for past crises, not emerging risks, while new risk agents inflate the next bubble. He cites economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff\u2019s warning from Their book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, noting that 'when an accident is waiting to happen, it usually does.' The shadow banking system and unpredictable 'black swans' remain persistent threats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-the-us-financial-system/)\n\n**FDIC Amends the Signage Requirements for Member Banks' ATMs and Digital Deposit Channels**\nOn January 22, 2026, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule amending signage requirements under 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5 to provide insured depository institutions with greater flexibility in displaying FDIC signage on digital deposit channels and ATMs. The rule allows banks to use varied colors, fonts, and text sizes for the FDIC official digital sign, requires its display on the homepage, login page, and the first page of the deposit account opening process, and limits non-deposit signage to pages primarily dedicated to non-deposit products. It also permits one-time notifications about third-party non-deposit products to auto-dismiss after three seconds. For ATMs and like devices, the rule clarifies signage requirements, including placement and visibility standards. Compliance is required by April 17, 2027. The FDIC previously delayed the compliance date for these provisions from January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2027, to allow time for rule development and to address implementation concerns. The delay did not apply to on-premise signage, which became effective on May 1, 2025. The final rule was informed by a notice of proposed rulemaking published in August 2025 and a public comment period ending October 20, 2025, with consideration given to public feedback, implementation and compliance costs, consumer benefits, and impacts on small banks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:49 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fdic-amends-the-signage-requirements-8049072/)\n\n**Buoyant markets face risk, warns Germany's 'party pooper' regulator**\nGermany's financial regulator, BaFin, warned on January 28, 2026, that financial markets face a growing risk of 'sudden corrections' in 2026 despite record valuations, citing geopolitical tensions, trade wars, high sovereign debt, and unprecedented political pressure on institutions. BaFin President Mark Branson described the current market mood as 'buoyant' but 'fragile and uncertain,' cautioning that 'the euphoric growth forecasts and sky-high valuations surrounding artificial intelligence will be substantiated in the medium term' remains an 'unresolved question.' Branson, referred to as the 'party pooper,' emphasized that 'at some point the party will be over,' highlighting risks from excessive risk-taking in private markets and lightly regulated financial vehicles. While noting that stable interest rates provide some room for maneuver and that the German banking sector remains 'quite profitable,' Branson stressed the need for institutions to prepare for potential shocks. BaFin will 'intensively' monitor credit risks for banks in 2026 and stated it is not 'alarmist' but urging proactive caution. The US Federal Reserve has faced increasing political pressure from President Donald Trump, raising concerns about central bank independence and international cooperation during crises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:49 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94A48WE)\n\n**FED INTEREST RATE ANNOUNCED!

The association claims these institutions misled thousands of conservative, vulnerable investors by portraying the CDBs as 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The petition states that the institutions and their advisors earned higher commissions from these sales while ignoring warning signs. Although the FGC protects investments up to R$250,000 per CPF, the case highlights that even seemingly secure fixed-income products carry risk. The ACP demands full restitution of losses not covered by the FGC, collective moral damages of R$100 million, a financial guarantee to secure the process outcome, a report on the number of affected investors, and official inquiries to the Central Bank and CVM. The action was later amended to include losses from Will Bank, whose liquidation was decreed on January 21, 2024, with the FGC\u2019s protection limited due to the conglomerate structure.

The report confirms that foundational resolution frameworks are largely in place and highlights advancements in operational readiness, including the publication of a practices paper on transfer tools, the establishment of a task force on bail-in execution, and enhanced information sharing on funding in resolution. It also summarizes resolvability assessment results for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and central counterparties. Looking ahead, the FSB plans to conduct a peer review of public sector backstop funding mechanisms, publish a practices paper on funding resolution, and launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities. Additionally, the FSB released an updated version of its 2021 good practices paper for crisis management groups (CMGs), incorporating a supplementary note on implementation observations following the 2023 bank failures, particularly regarding communication with host authorities not members of a CMG.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:02 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fsb-2025-resolution-report-7605597/)\n\n**Haddad Confirms Central Bank Investigation into Failures in Master Bank Case**\nBrazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad confirmed on January 29, 2026, that the Central Bank (BC) had opened an internal investigation to assess potential procedural failures in the handling of the case leading to the liquidation of Banco Master. According to Haddad, the inquiry will evaluate whether any mistakes were made by the Central Bank\u2019s own staff during the process. He made the statement in an interview with Acorda, Metr\u00f3poles, emphasizing that institutions must act transparently when issues arise. The Banco Master is at the center of a Federal Police investigation into a financial fraud scheme allegedly involving approximately R$ 12 billion in irregularly issued Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs). Daniel Vorcaro, the bank\u2019s founder, was arrested during a Federal Police operation. On the same day of Vorcaro\u2019s arrest, the Central Bank placed Banco Master under special administration and declared its extrajudicial liquidation, citing a severe liquidity crisis and the institution\u2019s compromised financial condition. The Central Bank also stated that Banco Master had violated regulations governing financial institutions within the National Financial System.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:49 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/haddad-confirma-investigacao-do-bc-para-apurar-falhas-no-caso-master)\n\n**Central Bank Launches Internal Probe into Banco Master's Extrajudicial Liquidation**\nThe Central Bank of Brazil (BC) has launched an internal investigation into the extrajudicial liquidation of Banco Master, conducted by the bank's internal oversight office (corregedoria) with full autonomy. The probe, initiated immediately after the liquidation in November 2025, aims to identify potential failures in supervision mechanisms and the technical team\u2019s monitoring of the institution\u2019s financial health, particularly regarding delays in detecting high-risk operations. The investigation is confidential and has no set completion date. Two directors from the Department of Banking Supervision (Desup)\u2014Belline Santana and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza\u2014resigned following the probe\u2019s launch. The case has drawn scrutiny from the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF), with the TCU ordering a review of liquidation documents. The BC initially filed appeals but withdrew them on January 12, 2026, after a meeting between TCU President Vital do R\u00eago Filho and BC President Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, allowing the TCU\u2019s review to proceed.

He highlights unusual $85-billion in emergency cash infusions from the New York Federal Reserve to unnamed 'too-big-to-fail' banks since October 2025, coupled with relaxed transaction limits in early December, suggesting possible distress at one or more major institutions. The article warns that these developments, combined with regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration, pose risks to financial stability. Michelle Bowman, the Fed\u2019s vice-chair of supervision, has announced a 30% reduction in Washington-based staff\u2014building on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s planned 10% cut\u2014claiming oversight will remain intact through the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes the move as 'taking more cops off of the Wall Street beat.' Bowman has also rebranded the Division of Supervision and Regulation as the 'business enablement group,' raising concerns about regulatory capture. Meanwhile, the Fed is revising its stress tests, which the previous chair Michael Barr warned would offer 'illusory comfort' in system resilience. Despite strong 2025 results, banks passed these tests under less rigorous standards than the prior year. The retreat from post-2008 regulations began under Trump 1.0 with the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which raised the asset threshold for strict oversight from $50-billion to $250-billion, reducing the number of highly regulated banks from 38 to 12\u2014actions many link to the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Gay warns that financial crises follow a cycle of easy credit, lax regulation, bubble formation, a Minsky moment, government bailouts, and new regulations\u2014only to repeat. He cautions that regulators often prepare for past crises, not emerging risks, while new risk agents inflate the next bubble. He cites economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff\u2019s warning from Their book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, noting that 'when an accident is waiting to happen, it usually does.' The shadow banking system and unpredictable 'black swans' remain persistent threats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-the-us-financial-system/)\n\n**FDIC Amends the Signage Requirements for Member Banks' ATMs and Digital Deposit Channels**\nOn January 22, 2026, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule amending signage requirements under 12 CFR 328.4 and 328.5 to provide insured depository institutions with greater flexibility in displaying FDIC signage on digital deposit channels and ATMs. The rule allows banks to use varied colors, fonts, and text sizes for the FDIC official digital sign, requires its display on the homepage, login page, and the first page of the deposit account opening process, and limits non-deposit signage to pages primarily dedicated to non-deposit products. It also permits one-time notifications about third-party non-deposit products to auto-dismiss after three seconds. For ATMs and like devices, the rule clarifies signage requirements, including placement and visibility standards. Compliance is required by April 17, 2027. The FDIC previously delayed the compliance date for these provisions from January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2027, to allow time for rule development and to address implementation concerns. The delay did not apply to on-premise signage, which became effective on May 1, 2025. The final rule was informed by a notice of proposed rulemaking published in August 2025 and a public comment period ending October 20, 2025, with consideration given to public feedback, implementation and compliance costs, consumer benefits, and impacts on small banks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:49 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fdic-amends-the-signage-requirements-8049072/)\n\n**Buoyant markets face risk, warns Germany's 'party pooper' regulator**\nGermany's financial regulator, BaFin, warned on January 28, 2026, that financial markets face a growing risk of 'sudden corrections' in 2026 despite record valuations, citing geopolitical tensions, trade wars, high sovereign debt, and unprecedented political pressure on institutions. BaFin President Mark Branson described the current market mood as 'buoyant' but 'fragile and uncertain,' cautioning that 'the euphoric growth forecasts and sky-high valuations surrounding artificial intelligence will be substantiated in the medium term' remains an 'unresolved question.' Branson, referred to as the 'party pooper,' emphasized that 'at some point the party will be over,' highlighting risks from excessive risk-taking in private markets and lightly regulated financial vehicles. While noting that stable interest rates provide some room for maneuver and that the German banking sector remains 'quite profitable,' Branson stressed the need for institutions to prepare for potential shocks. BaFin will 'intensively' monitor credit risks for banks in 2026 and stated it is not 'alarmist' but urging proactive caution.

The association claims these institutions misled thousands of conservative, vulnerable investors by portraying the CDBs as 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The petition states that the institutions and their advisors earned higher commissions from these sales while ignoring warning signs. Although the FGC protects investments up to R$250,000 per CPF, the case highlights that even seemingly secure fixed-income products carry risk. The ACP demands full restitution of losses not covered by the FGC, collective moral damages of R$100 million, a financial guarantee to secure the process outcome, a report on the number of affected investors, and official inquiries to the Central Bank and CVM. The action was later amended to include losses from Will Bank, whose liquidation was decreed on January 21, 2024, with the FGC\u2019s protection limited due to the conglomerate structure. According to consumer law expert Gabriel de Britto Silva, if proven, the institutions\u2019 failure to disclose risks and their aggressive promotion to vulnerable clients constitutes a breach of duty and grounds for compensation.

The case, filed on January 2, 2024, by the Brazilian Association for Consumer and Worker Defense (Abradecont), alleges that the firms engaged in 'aggressive marketing, misleading advertising, deceptive advisory, conflicts of interest, and coordinated systematic conduct' in promoting these high-risk investments. The association claims that thousands of conservative investors were misled into believing the CDBs were 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The action argues that the use of FGC coverage as a primary selling point masked significant risks tied to the issuer. The petition demands full restitution of losses, including amounts not covered by the FGC, individual and collective moral damages (set at R$100 million), a financial guarantee to secure potential liability, and detailed reports on affected consumers. Additional requests include regulatory disclosures from the Central Bank and a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). In a January 23 addendum, the case was expanded to include assets from Will Bank, which also faced extrajudicial liquidation on January 21, 2024, raising concerns about FGC coverage limits due to the conglomerate structure. Legal expert Gabriel de Britto Silva emphasized that brokers have a duty to provide clear, accurate, and sufficient information to consumers, and that failure to disclose risks\u2014especially to conservative investors\u2014constitutes a breach of service and grounds for compensation.

These include the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Banco Central de Chile, Bank of Canada, South African Reserve Bank, Banco de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, Central Bank of Brazil, Reserve Bank of Australia, and the European Central Bank. According to Barclays strategists, five central banks\u2014Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, Banco de M\u00e9xico, Central Bank of Brazil, and the Fed\u2014will likely hold rates steady. Two, the South African Reserve Bank and Banco Central de Chile, will each cut rates by 25 basis points. Only Colombia\u2019s Banco de la Rep\u00fablica is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points to curb rising demand pressures. Barclays notes that the six American economies involved\u2014U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia\u2014are facing economic slowdowns potentially driven by tight monetary policy. Bank of America Securities, Barclays, and Oxford Economics anticipate that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will reaffirm a pause in the rate-cutting cycle during his press conference, citing downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. Powell is expected to emphasize that his decisions are based solely on macroeconomic conditions and that he will serve out his Senate-confirmed term, which ends in May 2026. Oxford Economics projects that the next rate cut may not occur until June, as the current rate is near neutral and must remain stable to manage external risks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:26 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/economia/ocho-bancos-centrales-emitiran-decision-monetaria-proximos-10-dias-20260128-797300.html)\n\n**GAO Releases Report on the Importance of Federal Home Loan Banks**\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on December 17, 2025, titled 'Federal Home Loan Banks: Role During Financial Stress and Members' Borrowing Trends and Outcomes.' The report analyzes FHLBank borrowing trends from 2015 to June 2025, associations between borrowing and outcomes, policy considerations for reforms, and communication between FHLBanks and federal agencies during financial stress. It finds that FHLBanks are a reliable and consistent source of liquidity for banks of all sizes, playing an essential role in the U.S. banking system. As of June 2025, 93% of the 4,424 U.S. banks were FHLBank members. Over 75% of members borrowed from their FHLBank at least once between Q1 2015 and Q2 2025, with two-thirds of borrowers having outstanding borrowing each quarter. Borrowing rose 27% in Q1 2020 during the pandemic, peaking at $804 billion in Q1 2023 following banking failures, before returning to pre-pandemic levels of $450\u2013$550 billion by Q2 2025. Large banks (over $10 billion in assets), though only 3% of members, held nearly 75% of total borrowing and accounted for 84% of borrowing during crises. FHLBank borrowing was associated with increased lending by small banks\u20141% higher borrowing correlated with a 0.009% rise in total lending, 0.011% in residential lending, and 0.01% in commercial lending\u2014suggesting support for housing and community development. Higher borrowing was not linked to safety concerns; in fact, banks with higher FHLBank borrowing were less likely to fail or appear on the FDIC's Problem Bank List. Six concerns were identified: implied government guarantees, risk-taking incentives, cooperative structure favoring risky lending, the 'super lien' encouraging high-risk lending, collateral-based lending overlooking credit risk, and lack of transparency. GAO proposed eight reforms grouped into four areas: enhanced regulatory oversight (deemed duplicative), changes to payout structures after failures (noted as unnecessary and risky), replacing FHLBank lending with Federal Reserve lending (deemed impractical), and adjusting advance pricing (warned to disrupt liquidity roles and market competition). The report also highlights improved coordination between FHLBanks and the Federal Reserve since 2023, including increased engagement among regional banks and a new working group to improve interoperability. GAO concludes that FHLBanks are a critical, stable source of credit, with reforms posing significant unintended risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 01:40 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/gao-releases-report-on-the-importance-6167379/)\n\n**Regional Bank Collapse Risk: 3 Signs Your Savings Account Is Exposed**\nRegional banks face heightened risk of collapse in 2025 due to rising interest rates, increasing loan defaults, and regulatory scrutiny, with vulnerabilities amplified by their reliance on localized lending. Three key warning signs for depositors include: (1) falling stock prices, which signal eroding investor confidence and potential liquidity or profitability issues; (2) rising loan defaults, particularly in sectors like real estate or small business, which weaken the bank\u2019s balance sheet and may lead to tighter lending; and (3) withdrawal restrictions or unusual fees, which indicate liquidity problems and can trigger bank runs. While FDIC insurance protects deposits up to $250,000, delays in accessing insured funds can still disrupt financial stability, and those with balances above the limit face greater risk. The article emphasizes that regulatory intervention often occurs too late, and suggests proactive strategies such as diversifying deposits across multiple banks, keeping balances below FDIC limits, monitoring financial news, and maintaining accounts with larger national banks. The broader context includes challenges from digital banking competition, inflation, and shifting consumer behavior, which collectively threaten regional banking stability and, by extension, local economies. The article concludes that recognizing early warning signs is essential for safeguarding savings in an increasingly fragile financial environment.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 09:45 PM\nSource:[Saving Advice](https://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2025/11/24/10307731_regional-bank-collapse-risk-3-signs-your-savings-account-is-exposed.html)\n\n**Changes on the Horizon for Recovery and Resolution Planning**\nThe banking industry is facing potential changes in recovery and resolution planning, driven by shifting regulatory priorities following the 2023 regional bank failures. In response, the FDIC and OCC initially strengthened rules in 2024 and 2025, expanding requirements to more banks, increasing submission frequency, and demanding more detailed content. However, in October 2025, Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill signaled a reversal, suggesting a move away from extensive documentation toward greater focus on dynamic risk management and operational capabilities. Key proposed changes include shifting from the traditional bridge bank approach to prioritizing weekend sales, especially for Group A CIDIs (banks with $100 billion or more in assets), and allowing nonbank entities like private equity firms to participate in acquisition bidding. The OCC is proposing to rescind its recovery planning guidelines for national banks with $100 billion or more in assets, citing concerns about the practical utility of such plans and the burden of compliance. The OCC is also seeking input on whether to codify its Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFP) expectations for all OCC-regulated institutions. While the changes may reduce paperwork, institutions must still maintain strong operational resiliency, capital and liquidity strength, and risk management practices. Regulators are expected to increase emphasis on testing through tabletop exercises and simulations. Public filings from Group A CIDIs in July 2025 already reflect a shift toward alternative resolution strategies, including weekend sales, multiple-acquirer exits, and liquidation. These evolving proposals signal a broader deregulatory trend under the current administration aimed at reducing compliance costs while maintaining financial stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 06:13 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/changes-on-the-horizon-for-recovery-and-7620976/)\n\n**Troutman Pepper Locke Weekly Consumer Financial Services Newsletter - November 2025 # 2**\nThe Troutman Pepper Locke Weekly Consumer Financial Services Newsletter for November 2025, Issue #2, highlights key federal and state developments in consumer financial services. On November 7, the FDIC revised its Consumer Compliance Examination Manual, introducing new examination cycles (66\u201378 months, 54\u201366 months, or 24\u201336 months) based on asset size, with risk-based midpoint reviews for institutions on longer cycles and more frequent supervision for adversely rated institutions. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson emphasized AI\u2019s productivity gains and its mixed impact on employment and inflation, supporting the recent 25-basis-point rate cut and advocating for flexible policymaking amid uncertainty. Governor Stephen Miran projected that dollar-denominated stablecoins\u2014backed by the GENIUS Act\u2014could channel $1\u20133 trillion into U.S. Treasury bills by decade\u2019s end, lowering borrowing costs and the neutral interest rate (r-star), while urging policymakers to integrate these dynamics into forward-looking frameworks. Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Fed Chair Jerome Powell to disclose staffing reductions in the Division of Supervision and Regulation (from ~500 to 350), citing risks of weakened supervision and potential bank failures. Governor Christopher Waller clarified that 'skinny' master accounts will only be available to chartered depository institutions, limiting fintech access and reinforcing banking perimeter boundaries. The Federal Reserve finalized changes to its Large Financial Institution (LFI) rating system, redefining 'well managed' status and replacing automatic enforcement actions for Deficient-1 ratings with case-by-case assessments, though Governor Michael Barr dissented, warning of weakened safeguards. Comptroller Jonathan Gould advocated for defending federal preemption across the banking system through legal, political, and regulatory engagement. PYMNTS reported 333 public comments on the GENIUS Act framework, urging clarity on AML compliance, state oversight, and tiered obligations for stablecoin issuers. Politico reported Senate leaders preparing to question White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks on CFTC commissioner appointments and Trump family digital asset entanglements. The CFPB\u2019s information security program declined from level 4 to level 2 in the OIG audit, citing staffing losses, outdated software, and inadequate risk analysis, prompting six new corrective actions. NMLS released the MCR FV7 XML schema for mortgage reporting, with test submissions planned for January 2026 and office hours from November 2025 through April 2026. FHFA confirmed Freddie Mac met all housing goals, while Fannie Mae narrowly missed its single-family very low-income purchase goal but was not required to submit a formal Housing Plan. On the state level, Massachusetts AG Andrea Joy Campbell led a coalition of 25 attorneys general in suing the U.S. Department of Education to block a PSLF rule that could exclude nonprofits and state entities with 'substantial illegal purpose'\u2014a move criticized as overbroad and arbitrary. Pennsylvania AG Dave Sunday secured a $750,000 settlement with American Mint over deceptive subscription practices. California DFPI imposed a $100,000 penalty on Directions Equity for overcharging interest and poor recordkeeping, and ordered LSGT Services (Coinhub) to pay $675,000, including $105,000 in restitution, for violating digital asset laws, with additional enforcement actions against other kiosk operators.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:29 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/troutman-pepper-locke-weekly-consumer-8534773/)\n\n**GOP Senator Now Blasts Trump\u2019s FDIC Nominee, Demanding Investigation**\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, delivered a forceful rebuke during a Senate Banking Committee hearing to Travis Hill, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), demanding immediate action on a 2023 internal investigation that revealed 'pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination' across the agency. Kennedy stated, 'I\u2019ve had enough of this,' and warned that he would not support Hill\u2019s nomination unless a detailed report on reforms is delivered within 30 days, vowing to block the nomination until 'justice' is served for victims. Hill, who has served as acting chair and vice chair, defended the agency\u2019s ongoing cultural reform efforts, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts dismissed these assurances as lacking substance. The FDIC, created during the Great Depression to restore public trust in banking, faces mounting internal and external pressures: a 2023 probe triggered by whistleblower complaints exposed a toxic workplace culture, leading to the resignation of former Chairman Martin Gruenberg. Since late 2024, four small banks have failed, including Pulaski Savings Bank ($49.5M in assets) and The Santa Anna National Bank ($63.8M), with Santa Anna\u2019s collapse linked to suspected fraud and costing the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $23.7 million. The FDIC\u2019s latest Risk Review highlights growing risks in commercial real estate (CRE), with 31% of banks\u20141,374 institutions\u2014classified as CRE-concentrated and non-owner occupied CRE delinquency rising to 4.65% in Q1 2025, above pre-pandemic levels. Outgoing Chairman Gruenberg warned in January that risks are 'greater now' due to larger, more complex banks and uninsured deposits exceeding $7 trillion (over 40% of total deposits). The FDIC\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported in March that severe staffing shortages\u2014exacerbated by hundreds of layoffs under the Trump administration\u2014threaten the agency\u2019s ability to conduct required examinations in 2025, especially in cybersecurity and IT. Financial risk consultant Mayra Rodr\u00edguez Valladares told NPR that proposed cuts and even calls to abolish the FDIC as part of Project 2025 are 'sowing the seeds for the next financial crisis.' Despite the FDIC\u2019s insurance fund rising to $140.9 billion by March 2025, projections indicate it may fall to the statutory minimum of 1.35% by year-end, reducing its buffer. In October, the FDIC and the OCC proposed redefining 'unsafe or unsound practices' to focus on material threats like cyber and liquidity risks. Hill\u2019s confirmation remains uncertain, with Democrats expected to oppose him and Kennedy\u2019s support now conditional. The outcome will determine whether the FDIC can regain credibility and fulfill its mandate amid escalating systemic risks.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[FrankNez Media](https://franknezmedia.com/gop-senator-now-blasts-trumps-fdic-nominee-demanding-investigation/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=gop-senator-now-blasts-trumps-fdic-nominee-demanding-investigation)\n\n**Regional banks' bad loans spark concerns on Wall Street**\nWall Street is expressing growing concern over the financial health of regional banks following recent disclosures of bad loans and investments. Zions Bank, Western Alliance Bank, and investment bank Jefferies reported significant losses\u2014Zions wrote off $50 million in commercial and industrial loans, Western Alliance alleged fraud by Cantor Group V LLC, and Jefferies disclosed potential millions in losses from its dealings with bankrupt auto parts company First Brands. These revelations triggered sharp stock declines, with the KBW Bank Index down 7% in October 2025. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon amplified fears by warning, 'When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,' referencing potential systemic risks. The Federal Reserve also reported that banks accessed its overnight repo facilities for the second consecutive night\u2014only the second time since the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014indicating short-term liquidity stress. The current situation echoes the 2023 banking crisis, which saw the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and the fire-sale acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan Chase. While larger banks like Fifth Third Bank recorded a $178 million loss from the Tricolor auto dealership bankruptcy, executives at Deutsche Bank and other major institutions assert that credit portfolios remain strong and losses are contained. Despite regional banks' critical role in lending to small-to-medium enterprises and commercial real estate\u2014over 120 such banks have between $10 billion and $200 billion in assets\u2014regional institutions face higher risks due to less diversified revenue streams, particularly exposure to real estate and industrial loans. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $250,000 per account, and since its creation in 1933, no insured depositor has lost funds in a bank failure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/zions-bank-jefferies-western-alliance-regional-banks-dea767e001efc43070d4ebcdcfc99fe0)\n\n**October 17, 2025: The Beginning of the Regional Banks Crisis?**\nOn Friday, October 17, 2025, a significant market shift occurred as risk aversion spread from U.S. regional banks to global markets. European indices erased their weekly gains, with bank stocks declining sharply following a 6% drop in the U.S. regional bank index the previous day. The immediate trigger was revelations of fraudulent loans and irregularities at Zions and Western Alliance, evoking memories of the 2023 banking crisis. Markets interpreted these events through a broader lens of macroeconomic fragility, citing two major pressures: the imminent 100% tariff increase on Chinese imports, which threatens U.S. consumer spending and retailer margins, and a sharp 82% decline in net unauthorized immigration in the U.S. (as reported by the Dallas Fed from late 2024 to March 2025), undermining labor supply, entrepreneurship, and household repayment capacity\u2014key functions of regional banks. The article notes that regional banks are structurally vulnerable due to their reliance on local SMEs and residential real estate, limited access to deep capital markets, and sensitivity to local economic conditions. Despite the market sell-off and a 'risk-off' dynamic (including a yield curve inversion), the FDIC reported only two minor bank failures in 2025 (assets under $70M), indicating no systemic banking collapse. The crisis is primarily one of confidence, not solvency. Three key uncertainties remain: the scale of litigation-related losses, the scope of tariff implementation, and the future trajectory of immigration. If these pressures intensify, the October 17 event could mark the beginning of a broader credit stress. The article concludes with a proviso: 'What\u2019s bad for U.S. regional banks is bad for Bitcoin,' suggesting a broader risk-off sentiment affecting financial assets.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - France](https://fr.beincrypto.com/17-octobre-2025-debut-crash-banques-regionales/)\n\n**FDIC's Hill: Agency to expand nonbank participation in bidding on failed banks**\nActing FDIC Chairman Travis Hill announced that the FDIC will expand nonbank participation in bidding on failed banks to reduce financial strain on the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The agency is revising its bidding process to make it more competitive and flexible, as current eligibility criteria are too restrictive for large bank failures. Nonbanks, including private equity firms, now control significant capital pools that can be used in partnerships with banks to bid on entire institutions. To support this, the FDIC has developed a seller-financing program for nonbank bidders and a pre-qualification pilot process, set to launch in January 2026, involving firms that participated in the 2023 failures of Republic First Bank and Signature Bank, as well as other interested nonbank entities. Hill also highlighted that the 2023 failures created major short-term liquidity demands, prompting the FDIC to prepare for future crises by engaging the Federal Financing Bank to enable rapid asset securitization\u2014such as purchase money notes or leverage for asset purchases\u2014to facilitate large, complex transactions. Additionally, the FDIC is drafting revisions to its large bank resolution planning rule, aiming to codify recent FAQ changes that now require institutions to describe multiple feasible resolution strategies rather than mandating a bridge bank approach. The agency is also evaluating ways to shift focus from static plans to operational capabilities testing and enhanced engagement. These efforts follow recommendations from an American Bankers Association task force in August 2025 proposing reforms to the bank resolution process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[ABA Banking Journal](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2025/10/fdics-hill-agency-to-expand-nonbank-participation-in-bidding-on-failed-banks/)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n",
