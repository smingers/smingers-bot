The report confirms that foundational resolution frameworks are largely in place and highlights advancements in operational readiness, including the publication of a practices paper on transfer tools, the establishment of a task force on bail-in execution, and enhanced information sharing on funding in resolution. It also summarizes resolvability assessment results for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and central counterparties. Looking ahead, the FSB plans to conduct a peer review of public sector backstop funding mechanisms, publish a practices paper on funding resolution, and launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities.

According to Haddad, the inquiry will evaluate whether any mistakes were made by the Central Bank\u2019s own staff during the process. He made the statement in an interview with Acorda, Metr\u00f3poles, emphasizing that institutions must act transparently when issues arise. The Banco Master is at the center of a Federal Police investigation into a financial fraud scheme allegedly involving approximately R$ 12 billion in irregularly issued Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs). Daniel Vorcaro, the bank\u2019s founder, was arrested during a Federal Police operation. On the same day of Vorcaro\u2019s arrest, the Central Bank placed Banco Master under special administration and declared its extrajudicial liquidation, citing a severe liquidity crisis and the institution\u2019s compromised financial condition. The Central Bank also stated that Banco Master had violated regulations governing financial institutions within the National Financial System.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:49 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/haddad-confirma-investigacao-do-bc-para-apurar-falhas-no-caso-master)\n\n**Central Bank Launches Internal Probe into Banco Master's Extrajudicial Liquidation**\nThe Central Bank of Brazil (BC) has launched an internal investigation into the extrajudicial liquidation of Banco Master, conducted by the bank's internal oversight office (corregedoria) with full autonomy. The probe, initiated immediately after the liquidation in November 2025, aims to identify potential failures in supervision mechanisms and the technical team\u2019s monitoring of the institution\u2019s financial health, particularly regarding delays in detecting high-risk operations. The investigation is confidential and has no set completion date. Two directors from the Department of Banking Supervision (Desup)\u2014Belline Santana and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza\u2014resigned following the probe\u2019s launch. The case has drawn scrutiny from the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF), with the TCU ordering a review of liquidation documents. The BC initially filed appeals but withdrew them on January 12, 2026, after a meeting between TCU President Vital do R\u00eago Filho and BC President Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, allowing the TCU\u2019s review to proceed. The investigation seeks to clarify the circumstances leading to the bank\u2019s collapse and to strengthen internal governance and oversight at the Central Bank.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:38 PM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/economia/2026/01/7343181-banco-central-abre-investigacao-interna-sobre-liquidacao-do-master.html)\n\n**Opinion: Something is rotten in the state of the U.S. financial system**\nChris Gay, a former Wall Street Journal staffer and contributor to outlets including Forbes and Slate, argues in an opinion piece published by The Globe and Mail on January 29, 2026, that the U.S. financial system shows signs of systemic fragility. He highlights unusual $85-billion in emergency cash infusions from the New York Federal Reserve to unnamed 'too-big-to-fail' banks since October 2025, coupled with relaxed transaction limits in early December, suggesting possible distress at one or more major institutions. The article warns that these developments, combined with regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration, pose risks to financial stability. Michelle Bowman, the Fed\u2019s vice-chair of supervision, has announced a 30% reduction in Washington-based staff\u2014building on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s planned 10% cut\u2014claiming oversight will remain intact through the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes the move as 'taking more cops off of the Wall Street beat.' Bowman has also rebranded the Division of Supervision and Regulation as the 'business enablement group,' raising concerns about regulatory capture. Meanwhile, the Fed is revising its stress tests, which the previous chair Michael Barr warned would offer 'illusory comfort' in system resilience. Despite strong 2025 results, banks passed these tests under less rigorous standards than the prior year. The retreat from post-2008 regulations began under Trump 1.0 with the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which raised the asset threshold for strict oversight from $50-billion to $250-billion, reducing the number of highly regulated banks from 38 to 12\u2014actions many link to the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Gay warns that financial crises follow a cycle of easy credit, lax regulation, bubble formation, a Minsky moment, government bailouts, and new regulations\u2014only to repeat. He cautions that regulators often prepare for past crises, not emerging risks, while new risk agents inflate the next bubble. He cites economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff\u2019s warning from Their book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, noting that 'when an accident is waiting to happen, it usually does.'

It also permits one-time notifications about third-party non-deposit products to auto-dismiss after three seconds. For ATMs and like devices, the rule clarifies signage requirements, including placement and visibility standards. Compliance is required by April 17, 2027. The FDIC previously delayed the compliance date for these provisions from January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2027, to allow time for rule development and to address implementation concerns. The delay did not apply to on-premise signage, which became effective on May 1, 2025. The final rule was informed by a notice of proposed rulemaking published in August 2025 and a public comment period ending October 20, 2025, with consideration given to public feedback, implementation and compliance costs, consumer benefits, and impacts on small banks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:49 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fdic-amends-the-signage-requirements-8049072/)\n\n**Buoyant markets face risk, warns Germany's 'party pooper' regulator**\nGermany's financial regulator, BaFin, warned on January 28, 2026, that financial markets face a growing risk of 'sudden corrections' in 2026 despite record valuations, citing geopolitical tensions, trade wars, high sovereign debt, and unprecedented political pressure on institutions. BaFin President Mark Branson described the current market mood as 'buoyant' but 'fragile and uncertain,' cautioning that 'the euphoric growth forecasts and sky-high valuations surrounding artificial intelligence will be substantiated in the medium term' remains an 'unresolved question.' Branson, referred to as the 'party pooper,' emphasized that 'at some point the party will be over,' highlighting risks from excessive risk-taking in private markets and lightly regulated financial vehicles. While noting that stable interest rates provide some room for maneuver and that the German banking sector remains 'quite profitable,' Branson stressed the need for institutions to prepare for potential shocks. BaFin will 'intensively' monitor credit risks for banks in 2026 and stated it is not 'alarmist' but urging proactive caution. The US Federal Reserve has faced increasing political pressure from President Donald Trump, raising concerns about central bank independence and international cooperation during crises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:49 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94A48WE)\n\n**FED INTEREST RATE ANNOUNCED! What Will the January 2026 U.S. Central Bank Decision Be?**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) is set to announce its January 2026 interest rate decision today, a move that will serve as a key guide for global markets. The announcement, expected to influence the dollar index, gold prices, and cryptocurrency markets, has drawn widespread anticipation. Market participants are closely watching for signals on whether the FED will maintain current interest rates. The decision is being monitored by investors, particularly gold investors, who are awaiting critical insights ahead of the announcement. The FED's rate decision is scheduled for release on January 28, 2026, at 09:45 local time, according to Sabah.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Sabah](https://www.sabah.com.tr/trend/galeri/ekonomi/fed-faizi-aciklaniyor-ocak-2026-abd-merkez-bankasi-ocak-faiz-karari-ne-olur)\n\n**Consumer Group Sues Brokers Over Omission of Risks in Banco Master CDBs**\nThe Brazilian consumer advocacy group Abradecont filed a public civil action (ACP) on January 2, 2024, against three major financial institutions\u2014XP, BTG, and Nubank\u2014alleging that they engaged in aggressive marketing, deceptive advertising, and coordinated conduct in promoting Certificates of Bank Deposit (CDBs) issued by Banco Master. The association claims these institutions misled thousands of conservative, vulnerable investors by portraying the CDBs as 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The petition states that the institutions and their advisors earned higher commissions from these sales while ignoring warning signs. Although the FGC protects investments up to R$250,000 per CPF, the case highlights that even seemingly secure fixed-income products carry risk. The ACP demands full restitution of losses not covered by the FGC, collective moral damages of R$100 million, a financial guarantee to secure the process outcome, a report on the number of affected investors, and official inquiries to the Central Bank and CVM. The action was later amended to include losses from Will Bank, whose liquidation was decreed on January 21, 2024, with the FGC\u2019s protection limited due to the conglomerate structure. According to consumer law expert Gabriel de Britto Silva, if proven, the institutions\u2019 failure to disclose risks and their aggressive promotion to vulnerable clients constitutes a breach of duty and grounds for compensation. Nubank stated it ceased offering new Banco Master CDBs in 2024 and emphasized that it does not use investment advisors, maintaining full client autonomy and regulatory compliance. XP and BTG did not respond to requests for comment.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:00 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/financas/noticia/2026/01/28/acao-diz-que-corretoras-omitiram-risco-de-cdbs-emitidos-pelo-banco-master.ghtml)\n\n**FSB 2025 Resolution Report**\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has released its 2025 Resolution Report, assessing global progress in implementing resolution reforms for banks, insurers, and financial market infrastructures, and outlining priorities for strengthening global resolution frameworks and crisis preparedness in 2026.

BaFin President Mark Branson described the current market mood as 'buoyant' but 'fragile and uncertain,' cautioning that 'the euphoric growth forecasts and sky-high valuations surrounding artificial intelligence will be substantiated in the medium term' remains an 'unresolved question.' Branson, referred to as the 'party pooper,' emphasized that 'at some point the party will be over,' highlighting risks from excessive risk-taking in private markets and lightly regulated financial vehicles. While noting that stable interest rates provide some room for maneuver and that the German banking sector remains 'quite profitable,' Branson stressed the need for institutions to prepare for potential shocks. BaFin will 'intensively' monitor credit risks for banks in 2026 and stated it is not 'alarmist' but urging proactive caution. The US Federal Reserve has faced increasing political pressure from President Donald Trump, raising concerns about central bank independence and international cooperation during crises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:49 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94A48WE)\n\n**FED INTEREST RATE ANNOUNCED!

The association claims these institutions misled thousands of conservative, vulnerable investors by portraying the CDBs as 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The petition states that the institutions and their advisors earned higher commissions from these sales while ignoring warning signs. Although the FGC protects investments up to R$250,000 per CPF, the case highlights that even seemingly secure fixed-income products carry risk. The ACP demands full restitution of losses not covered by the FGC, collective moral damages of R$100 million, a financial guarantee to secure the process outcome, a report on the number of affected investors, and official inquiries to the Central Bank and CVM. The action was later amended to include losses from Will Bank, whose liquidation was decreed on January 21, 2024, with the FGC\u2019s protection limited due to the conglomerate structure. According to consumer law expert Gabriel de Britto Silva, if proven, the institutions\u2019 failure to disclose risks and their aggressive promotion to vulnerable clients constitutes a breach of duty and grounds for compensation. Nubank stated it ceased offering new Banco Master CDBs in 2024 and emphasized that it does not use investment advisors, maintaining full client autonomy and regulatory compliance.

The case, filed on January 2, 2024, by the Brazilian Association for Consumer and Worker Defense (Abradecont), alleges that the firms engaged in 'aggressive marketing, misleading advertising, deceptive advisory, conflicts of interest, and coordinated systematic conduct' in promoting these high-risk investments. The association claims that thousands of conservative investors were misled into believing the CDBs were 'safe' and 'fully guaranteed by the FGC (Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos)', despite clear financial deterioration at Banco Master, which had its extrajudicial liquidation decreed by the Central Bank on November 18, 2023. The action argues that the use of FGC coverage as a primary selling point masked significant risks tied to the issuer. The petition demands full restitution of losses, including amounts not covered by the FGC, individual and collective moral damages (set at R$100 million), a financial guarantee to secure potential liability, and detailed reports on affected consumers. Additional requests include regulatory disclosures from the Central Bank and a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). In a January 23 addendum, the case was expanded to include assets from Will Bank, which also faced extrajudicial liquidation on January 21, 2024, raising concerns about FGC coverage limits due to the conglomerate structure. Legal expert Gabriel de Britto Silva emphasized that brokers have a duty to provide clear, accurate, and sufficient information to consumers, and that failure to disclose risks\u2014especially to conservative investors\u2014constitutes a breach of service and grounds for compensation. Nubank stated it ceased offering new Banco Master CDBs in 2024 and emphasized its model of client autonomy via its app, adhering strictly to regulations.

These include the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Banco Central de Chile, Bank of Canada, South African Reserve Bank, Banco de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, Central Bank of Brazil, Reserve Bank of Australia, and the European Central Bank. According to Barclays strategists, five central banks\u2014Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, Banco de M\u00e9xico, Central Bank of Brazil, and the Fed\u2014will likely hold rates steady. Two, the South African Reserve Bank and Banco Central de Chile, will each cut rates by 25 basis points. Only Colombia\u2019s Banco de la Rep\u00fablica is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points to curb rising demand pressures. Barclays notes that the six American economies involved\u2014U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia\u2014are facing economic slowdowns potentially driven by tight monetary policy. Bank of America Securities, Barclays, and Oxford Economics anticipate that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will reaffirm a pause in the rate-cutting cycle during his press conference, citing downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. Powell is expected to emphasize that his decisions are based solely on macroeconomic conditions and that he will serve out his Senate-confirmed term, which ends in May 2026. Oxford Economics projects that the next rate cut may not occur until June, as the current rate is near neutral and must remain stable to manage external risks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:26 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/economia/ocho-bancos-centrales-emitiran-decision-monetaria-proximos-10-dias-20260128-797300.html)\n\n**GAO Releases Report on the Importance of Federal Home Loan Banks**\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on December 17, 2025, titled 'Federal Home Loan Banks: Role During Financial Stress and Members' Borrowing Trends and Outcomes.' The report analyzes FHLBank borrowing trends from 2015 to June 2025, associations between borrowing and outcomes, policy considerations for reforms, and communication between FHLBanks and federal agencies during financial stress. It finds that FHLBanks are a reliable and consistent source of liquidity for banks of all sizes, playing an essential role in the U.S. banking system. As of June 2025, 93% of the 4,424 U.S. banks were FHLBank members. Over 75% of members borrowed from their FHLBank at least once between Q1 2015 and Q2 2025, with two-thirds of borrowers having outstanding borrowing each quarter. Borrowing rose 27% in Q1 2020 during the pandemic, peaking at $804 billion in Q1 2023 following banking failures, before returning to pre-pandemic levels of $450\u2013$550 billion by Q2 2025. Large banks (over $10 billion in assets), though only 3% of members, held nearly 75% of total borrowing and accounted for 84% of borrowing during crises. FHLBank borrowing was associated with increased lending by small banks\u20141% higher borrowing correlated with a 0.009% rise in total lending, 0.011% in residential lending, and 0.01% in commercial lending\u2014suggesting support for housing and community development. Higher borrowing was not linked to safety concerns; in fact, banks with higher FHLBank borrowing were less likely to fail or appear on the FDIC's Problem Bank List. Six concerns were identified: implied government guarantees, risk-taking incentives, cooperative structure favoring risky lending, the 'super lien' encouraging high-risk lending, collateral-based lending overlooking credit risk, and lack of transparency. GAO proposed eight reforms grouped into four areas: enhanced regulatory oversight (deemed duplicative), changes to payout structures after failures (noted as unnecessary and risky), replacing FHLBank lending with Federal Reserve lending (deemed impractical), and adjusting advance pricing (warned to disrupt liquidity roles and market competition). The report also highlights improved coordination between FHLBanks and the Federal Reserve since 2023, including increased engagement among regional banks and a new working group to improve interoperability. GAO concludes that FHLBanks are a critical, stable source of credit, with reforms posing significant unintended risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 01:40 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/gao-releases-report-on-the-importance-6167379/)\n\n**Regional Bank Collapse Risk: 3 Signs Your Savings Account Is Exposed**\nRegional banks face heightened risk of collapse in 2025 due to rising interest rates, increasing loan defaults, and regulatory scrutiny, with vulnerabilities amplified by their reliance on localized lending. Three key warning signs for depositors include: (1) falling stock prices, which signal eroding investor confidence and potential liquidity or profitability issues; (2) rising loan defaults, particularly in sectors like real estate or small business, which weaken the bank\u2019s balance sheet and may lead to tighter lending; and (3) withdrawal restrictions or unusual fees, which indicate liquidity problems and can trigger bank runs. While FDIC insurance protects deposits up to $250,000, delays in accessing insured funds can still disrupt financial stability, and those with balances above the limit face greater risk. The article emphasizes that regulatory intervention often occurs too late, and suggests proactive strategies such as diversifying deposits across multiple banks, keeping balances below FDIC limits, monitoring financial news, and maintaining accounts with larger national banks. The broader context includes challenges from digital banking competition, inflation, and shifting consumer behavior, which collectively threaten regional banking stability and, by extension, local economies. The article concludes that recognizing early warning signs is essential for safeguarding savings in an increasingly fragile financial environment.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 09:45 PM\nSource:[Saving Advice](https://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2025/11/24/10307731_regional-bank-collapse-risk-3-signs-your-savings-account-is-exposed.html)\n\n**Changes on the Horizon for Recovery and Resolution Planning**\nThe banking industry is facing potential changes in recovery and resolution planning, driven by shifting regulatory priorities following the 2023 regional bank failures. In response, the FDIC and OCC initially strengthened rules in 2024 and 2025, expanding requirements to more banks, increasing submission frequency, and demanding more detailed content. However, in October 2025, Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill signaled a reversal, suggesting a move away from extensive documentation toward greater focus on dynamic risk management and operational capabilities. Key proposed changes include shifting from the traditional bridge bank approach to prioritizing weekend sales, especially for Group A CIDIs (banks with $100 billion or more in assets), and allowing nonbank entities like private equity firms to participate in acquisition bidding. The OCC is proposing to rescind its recovery planning guidelines for national banks with $100 billion or more in assets, citing concerns about the practical utility of such plans and the burden of compliance. The OCC is also seeking input on whether to codify its Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFP) expectations for all OCC-regulated institutions. While the changes may reduce paperwork, institutions must still maintain strong operational resiliency, capital and liquidity strength, and risk management practices. Regulators are expected to increase emphasis on testing through tabletop exercises and simulations. Public filings from Group A CIDIs in July 2025 already reflect a shift toward alternative resolution strategies, including weekend sales, multiple-acquirer exits, and liquidation. These evolving proposals signal a broader deregulatory trend under the current administration aimed at reducing compliance costs while maintaining financial stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 06:13 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/changes-on-the-horizon-for-recovery-and-7620976/)\n\n**Troutman Pepper Locke Weekly Consumer Financial Services Newsletter - November 2025 # 2**\nThe Troutman Pepper Locke Weekly Consumer Financial Services Newsletter for November 2025, Issue #2, highlights key federal and state developments in consumer financial services. On November 7, the FDIC revised its Consumer Compliance Examination Manual, introducing new examination cycles (66\u201378 months, 54\u201366 months, or 24\u201336 months) based on asset size, with risk-based midpoint reviews for institutions on longer cycles and more frequent supervision for adversely rated institutions. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson emphasized AI\u2019s productivity gains and its mixed impact on employment and inflation, supporting the recent 25-basis-point rate cut and advocating for flexible policymaking amid uncertainty. Governor Stephen Miran projected that dollar-denominated stablecoins\u2014backed by the GENIUS Act\u2014could channel $1\u20133 trillion into U.S. Treasury bills by decade\u2019s end, lowering borrowing costs and the neutral interest rate (r-star), while urging policymakers to integrate these dynamics into forward-looking frameworks. Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Fed Chair Jerome Powell to disclose staffing reductions in the Division of Supervision and Regulation (from ~500 to 350), citing risks of weakened supervision and potential bank failures. Governor Christopher Waller clarified that 'skinny' master accounts will only be available to chartered depository institutions, limiting fintech access and reinforcing banking perimeter boundaries. The Federal Reserve finalized changes to its Large Financial Institution (LFI) rating system, redefining 'well managed' status and replacing automatic enforcement actions for Deficient-1 ratings with case-by-case assessments, though Governor Michael Barr dissented, warning of weakened safeguards. Comptroller Jonathan Gould advocated for defending federal preemption across the banking system through legal, political, and regulatory engagement. PYMNTS reported 333 public comments on the GENIUS Act framework, urging clarity on AML compliance, state oversight, and tiered obligations for stablecoin issuers. Politico reported Senate leaders preparing to question White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks on CFTC commissioner appointments and Trump family digital asset entanglements. The CFPB\u2019s information security program declined from level 4 to level 2 in the OIG audit, citing staffing losses, outdated software, and inadequate risk analysis, prompting six new corrective actions. NMLS released the MCR FV7 XML schema for mortgage reporting, with test submissions planned for January 2026 and office hours from November 2025 through April 2026. FHFA confirmed Freddie Mac met all housing goals, while Fannie Mae narrowly missed its single-family very low-income purchase goal but was not required to submit a formal Housing Plan. On the state level, Massachusetts AG Andrea Joy Campbell led a coalition of 25 attorneys general in suing the U.S. Department of Education to block a PSLF rule that could exclude nonprofits and state entities with 'substantial illegal purpose'\u2014a move criticized as overbroad and arbitrary. Pennsylvania AG Dave Sunday secured a $750,000 settlement with American Mint over deceptive subscription practices. California DFPI imposed a $100,000 penalty on Directions Equity for overcharging interest and poor recordkeeping, and ordered LSGT Services (Coinhub) to pay $675,000, including $105,000 in restitution, for violating digital asset laws, with additional enforcement actions against other kiosk operators.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:29 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/troutman-pepper-locke-weekly-consumer-8534773/)\n\n**GOP Senator Now Blasts Trump\u2019s FDIC Nominee, Demanding Investigation**\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, delivered a forceful rebuke during a Senate Banking Committee hearing to Travis Hill, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), demanding immediate action on a 2023 internal investigation that revealed 'pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination' across the agency. Kennedy stated, 'I\u2019ve had enough of this,' and warned that he would not support Hill\u2019s nomination unless a detailed report on reforms is delivered within 30 days, vowing to block the nomination until 'justice' is served for victims. Hill, who has served as acting chair and vice chair, defended the agency\u2019s ongoing cultural reform efforts, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts dismissed these assurances as lacking substance. The FDIC, created during the Great Depression to restore public trust in banking, faces mounting internal and external pressures: a 2023 probe triggered by whistleblower complaints exposed a toxic workplace culture, leading to the resignation of former Chairman Martin Gruenberg. Since late 2024, four small banks have failed, including Pulaski Savings Bank ($49.5M in assets) and The Santa Anna National Bank ($63.8M), with Santa Anna\u2019s collapse linked to suspected fraud and costing the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $23.7 million. The FDIC\u2019s latest Risk Review highlights growing risks in commercial real estate (CRE), with 31% of banks\u20141,374 institutions\u2014classified as CRE-concentrated and non-owner occupied CRE delinquency rising to 4.65% in Q1 2025, above pre-pandemic levels. Outgoing Chairman Gruenberg warned in January that risks are 'greater now' due to larger, more complex banks and uninsured deposits exceeding $7 trillion (over 40% of total deposits). The FDIC\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported in March that severe staffing shortages\u2014exacerbated by hundreds of layoffs under the Trump administration\u2014threaten the agency\u2019s ability to conduct required examinations in 2025, especially in cybersecurity and IT. Financial risk consultant Mayra Rodr\u00edguez Valladares told NPR that proposed cuts and even calls to abolish the FDIC as part of Project 2025 are 'sowing the seeds for the next financial crisis.' Despite the FDIC\u2019s insurance fund rising to $140.9 billion by March 2025, projections indicate it may fall to the statutory minimum of 1.35% by year-end, reducing its buffer. In October, the FDIC and the OCC proposed redefining 'unsafe or unsound practices' to focus on material threats like cyber and liquidity risks. Hill\u2019s confirmation remains uncertain, with Democrats expected to oppose him and Kennedy\u2019s support now conditional. The outcome will determine whether the FDIC can regain credibility and fulfill its mandate amid escalating systemic risks.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[FrankNez Media](https://franknezmedia.com/gop-senator-now-blasts-trumps-fdic-nominee-demanding-investigation/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=gop-senator-now-blasts-trumps-fdic-nominee-demanding-investigation)\n\n**Regional banks' bad loans spark concerns on Wall Street**\nWall Street is expressing growing concern over the financial health of regional banks following recent disclosures of bad loans and investments. Zions Bank, Western Alliance Bank, and investment bank Jefferies reported significant losses\u2014Zions wrote off $50 million in commercial and industrial loans, Western Alliance alleged fraud by Cantor Group V LLC, and Jefferies disclosed potential millions in losses from its dealings with bankrupt auto parts company First Brands. These revelations triggered sharp stock declines, with the KBW Bank Index down 7% in October 2025. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon amplified fears by warning, 'When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,' referencing potential systemic risks. The Federal Reserve also reported that banks accessed its overnight repo facilities for the second consecutive night\u2014only the second time since the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014indicating short-term liquidity stress. The current situation echoes the 2023 banking crisis, which saw the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and the fire-sale acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan Chase. While larger banks like Fifth Third Bank recorded a $178 million loss from the Tricolor auto dealership bankruptcy, executives at Deutsche Bank and other major institutions assert that credit portfolios remain strong and losses are contained. Despite regional banks' critical role in lending to small-to-medium enterprises and commercial real estate\u2014over 120 such banks have between $10 billion and $200 billion in assets\u2014regional institutions face higher risks due to less diversified revenue streams, particularly exposure to real estate and industrial loans. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $250,000 per account, and since its creation in 1933, no insured depositor has lost funds in a bank failure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/zions-bank-jefferies-western-alliance-regional-banks-dea767e001efc43070d4ebcdcfc99fe0)\n\n**October 17, 2025: The Beginning of the Regional Banks Crisis?**\nOn Friday, October 17, 2025, a significant market shift occurred as risk aversion spread from U.S. regional banks to global markets. European indices erased their weekly gains, with bank stocks declining sharply following a 6% drop in the U.S. regional bank index the previous day. The immediate trigger was revelations of fraudulent loans and irregularities at Zions and Western Alliance, evoking memories of the 2023 banking crisis. Markets interpreted these events through a broader lens of macroeconomic fragility, citing two major pressures: the imminent 100% tariff increase on Chinese imports, which threatens U.S. consumer spending and retailer margins, and a sharp 82% decline in net unauthorized immigration in the U.S. (as reported by the Dallas Fed from late 2024 to March 2025), undermining labor supply, entrepreneurship, and household repayment capacity\u2014key functions of regional banks. The article notes that regional banks are structurally vulnerable due to their reliance on local SMEs and residential real estate, limited access to deep capital markets, and sensitivity to local economic conditions. Despite the market sell-off and a 'risk-off' dynamic (including a yield curve inversion), the FDIC reported only two minor bank failures in 2025 (assets under $70M), indicating no systemic banking collapse. The crisis is primarily one of confidence, not solvency. Three key uncertainties remain: the scale of litigation-related losses, the scope of tariff implementation, and the future trajectory of immigration. If these pressures intensify, the October 17 event could mark the beginning of a broader credit stress. The article concludes with a proviso: 'What\u2019s bad for U.S. regional banks is bad for Bitcoin,' suggesting a broader risk-off sentiment affecting financial assets.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - France](https://fr.beincrypto.com/17-octobre-2025-debut-crash-banques-regionales/)\n\n**FDIC's Hill: Agency to expand nonbank participation in bidding on failed banks**\nActing FDIC Chairman Travis Hill announced that the FDIC will expand nonbank participation in bidding on failed banks to reduce financial strain on the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The agency is revising its bidding process to make it more competitive and flexible, as current eligibility criteria are too restrictive for large bank failures. Nonbanks, including private equity firms, now control significant capital pools that can be used in partnerships with banks to bid on entire institutions. To support this, the FDIC has developed a seller-financing program for nonbank bidders and a pre-qualification pilot process, set to launch in January 2026, involving firms that participated in the 2023 failures of Republic First Bank and Signature Bank, as well as other interested nonbank entities. Hill also highlighted that the 2023 failures created major short-term liquidity demands, prompting the FDIC to prepare for future crises by engaging the Federal Financing Bank to enable rapid asset securitization\u2014such as purchase money notes or leverage for asset purchases\u2014to facilitate large, complex transactions. Additionally, the FDIC is drafting revisions to its large bank resolution planning rule, aiming to codify recent FAQ changes that now require institutions to describe multiple feasible resolution strategies rather than mandating a bridge bank approach. The agency is also evaluating ways to shift focus from static plans to operational capabilities testing and enhanced engagement. These efforts follow recommendations from an American Bankers Association task force in August 2025 proposing reforms to the bank resolution process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[ABA Banking Journal](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2025/10/fdics-hill-agency-to-expand-nonbank-participation-in-bidding-on-failed-banks/)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
