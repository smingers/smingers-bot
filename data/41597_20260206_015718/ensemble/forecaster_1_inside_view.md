# Analysis

## (a) Source Analysis

**FDIC Official Sources (Primary):**
- **Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust failure notice (Jan 30, 2026)**: Definitive factual source. FDIC is the authoritative body for U.S. bank failures. Documents first 2026 failure with specific details: $261.1M assets, $212.1M deposits, $19.7M DIF cost. **Quality: Highest. Date: Jan 30, 2026 (within prediction window).**

- **FDIC 2026 Bank Failures Summary (Jan 30, 2026)**: Official compilation showing 1 failure in January 2026. **Quality: Highest. Date: Jan 30, 2026.**

**Financial News Sources (Secondary):**
- **Benzinga (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports Metropolitan Capital failure with factual details matching FDIC. Includes Polymarket data showing 18% probability of another failure by March 31 - this is aggregated market opinion but from identifiable traders with money at stake. Notes stable market reaction (regional bank ETFs up). **Quality: High for facts, moderate for market sentiment. Date: Feb 2, 2026 (4 days old).**

- **Chicago Tribune (Feb 2, 2026)**: Confirms Metropolitan Capital as first 2026 failure, provides historical context (second Chicago failure in two consecutive years). Notes FDIC cost estimate. **Quality: High. Date: Feb 2, 2026.**

- **Coinfomania (Jan 31, 2026)**: Reports failure with regulatory quotes emphasizing isolation. Distinguishes between official statements (reliable) and social media speculation (unreliable). **Quality: Moderate - crypto-focused outlet but cites officials. Date: Jan 31, 2026.**

**Market/Economic Context:**
- **Bankrate (Dec 20, 2025)**: Historical context showing 2 failures in 2025 (Santa Anna, Pulaski), 2 in 2024, 5 in 2023 (including SVB). Notes failures are "common" with "a few annually." **Quality: High for historical data. Date: Pre-prediction window but relevant context.**

- **AskNews articles on central banks/economy (Feb 5-6, 2026)**: ECB and BoE holding rates, mixed economic signals, no direct U.S. bank stress indicators. Russian bank stress mentioned but irrelevant to U.S. question. **Quality: Moderate for macro context, not directly relevant. Date: Current.**

**Speculative/Promotional Sources:**
- **Bill Holter/"Mr. Gold" interview (Jan 27, 2026)**: Predicts systemic failure in gold/silver delivery leading to financial collapse by March 2026. This is extreme speculation from a precious metals promoter, not credible financial analysis. **Quality: Very low. Date: Jan 27, 2026.**

- **Turkish/Arabic articles on business failures**: Discuss non-U.S. bank/business failures, irrelevant to question. **Quality: Not applicable.**

**Key Factual Evidence:**
1. **Confirmed: 1 U.S. bank failure (Metropolitan Capital) on Jan 30, 2026** - Strong evidence, multiple independent sources
2. **Market reaction muted** - Regional bank ETFs rose post-failure - Moderate evidence of no contagion
3. **Polymarket: 18% probability of another failure by March 31** - Moderate evidence (market-based opinion)
4. **Historical pattern: 2024-2025 had 1 failure each in Jan-Apr** - Strong evidence for base rate
5. **No additional failures reported Feb 1-5** - Weak evidence (short timeframe)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **1 confirmed failure already occurred (Jan 30)**: Shifts probability mass away from "0" to 100% certainty we're at minimum "1". This is definitive.
- **Historical 2018-2025 pattern**: Jan-Apr failures were 0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1. Shows 50% of years had 0 failures, but we've already exceeded that. Of 4 years with failures, 3 had exactly 1 (2024, 2025, 2019 had first failure in May), only 1 had 2 (2020, 2023 both had 2). **Supports "1 total" as most likely, with "2 total" as secondary.**
- **Muted market reaction**: Banking ETFs rose post-failure, indicating market views this as isolated. **Supports lower probability of additional failures.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Polymarket 18% for another failure by March 31**: Market-aggregated opinion with money at stake. However, this excludes April, so true probability through April 30 should be higher (perhaps 20-25%). **Suggests "2 total" probability around 20-25%.**
- **CRE stress and unrealized losses**: $337B in unrealized securities losses system-wide (Q3 2025 FDIC data) creates vulnerability. However, this has been known for 18+ months without triggering widespread failures. **Moderately supports non-zero probability of additional failures.**
- **2023 clustering precedent**: SVB and Signature failed 2 days apart in March 2023, showing failures can cluster rapidly. **Supports non-negligible "2" or "3+" probability.**
- **Metropolitan Capital was small and idiosyncratic**: $261M assets, specific CRE/nursing home exposure. Not indicative of systemic issues. **Supports "1 total" as most likely.**

**Weak Evidence:**
- **FDIC published new resolution templates (Jan 2026)**: Could indicate preparation for failures, but also routine regulatory updates. Speculative connection.
- **Social media speculation**: Crypto influencers warning of contagion - not credible expert opinion, disregard.
- **Only 5 days into remaining 84-day window**: Too short to establish trend.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** January 1 - April 30, 2026 (120 days total)
- **Elapsed:** January 1 - February 5 (36 days, 30%)
- **Remaining:** February 6 - April 30 (84 days, 70%)

**Current Status:** 1 failure on day 30 of 120.

**If timeframe halved (60 days, ending ~March 1):**
- Would reduce exposure period by 50%, cutting tail risk significantly
- Polymarket's 18% by March 31 would be directly applicable
- Would increase "1 total" probability to ~60-65%, decrease "2" to ~20-25%, "3+" to ~10-15%

**If timeframe doubled (240 days, through August 31):**
- Would include full summer period when failures historically occur
- Would increase clustering risk and exposure to unforeseen events
- Would likely shift to: "1" ~35-40%, "2" ~30-35%, "3+" ~25-30%

**Critical insight:** 70% of window remains, but historical patterns show failures don't occur uniformly - they cluster. The next 8 weeks (through March) are critical given 2023 precedent.

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate (2018-2025 Jan-Apr):**
- 0 failures: 50% (4/8 years)
- 1 failure: 25% (2/8 years)
- 2 failures: 25% (2/8 years)
- 3+ failures: 0% (0/8 years)

**However, we've already observed 1 failure, so we need conditional probabilities:**

**Conditional on having 1 failure by early February, historical outcomes:**
- 2025: Had 1 in January, ended with 1 total (no additional)
- 2024: Had 0 in Jan-Feb, then 1 in April (not analogous)
- 2023: Had 0 in Jan-Feb, then 2 in March (not analogous)
- 2020: Had 1 in February, then 1 more in April (ended with 2 total)

**Most analogous year: 2025** - Had 1 failure in January, no additional through April. This supports "1 total" as baseline.

**Factors Shifting from Base Rate:**

*Toward "1 total" (no additional failures):*
1. **Metropolitan Capital was idiosyncratic** (small, specific CRE exposure) - not systemic
2. **Market reaction calm** - no contagion signals
3. **2025 precedent** - most recent comparable year
4. **Regulatory oversight heightened** post-2023

*Toward "2 total" (one more failure):*
1. **70% of window remains** - substantial time for another event
2. **2020 precedent** - similar early failure led to April failure
3. **CRE refinancing pressures ongoing** - sector stress persists
4. **Polymarket 18% by March 31** suggests ~20-25% through April
5. **Clustering tendency** - 2023 showed rapid clustering

*Toward "3+" total (two+ more failures):*
1. **2023 precedent** - 2 failures occurred within days
2. **Unrealized losses** - $337B system-wide vulnerability
3. **Tail risk** - unforeseen shocks possible

**Calibration Adjustments:**

Starting from outside view conditional on 1 failure:
- **"1 total"**: 2025 pattern suggests ~60-70% baseline
- **"2 total"**: 2020 pattern + Polymarket suggests ~20-30%
- **"3+ total"**: 2023 clustering + tail risk suggests ~10-15%

**Adjusting for evidence strength:**
- Strong evidence (muted market reaction, idiosyncratic nature) supports "1"
- Moderate evidence (time remaining, Polymarket, CRE stress) supports material "2" probability
- Weak evidence for "3+" but 2023 precedent prevents dismissing entirely

**Final calibration must account for:**
1. We're 30% through window - not trivial
2. Most recent analog (2025) had no additional failures
3. But 70% remains and clustering risk exists
4. Market pricing (18% by March 31) anchors "2" probability around 20-25% through April

# Probability Calibration

**Reasoning:**

Starting with conditional base rate (given 1 failure already):
- Most likely: "1 total" (no more) - 2025 pattern, idiosyncratic failure, calm markets
- Secondary: "2 total" (one more) - 70% time remains, Polymarket ~18-20%, clustering risk
- Tail: "3+ total" (two+ more) - 2023 precedent, cannot fully dismiss

**Calibration checks:**
- Is 55% for "1" too confident? No - it's the most recent precedent and strongest evidence points here
- Is 30% for "2" reasonable? Yes - Polymarket ~18% by March 31, extending through April adds ~5-10%, plus 2020 precedent
- Is 15% for "3+" too high? Possibly, but 2023 showed 2 simultaneous failures are possible, and systemic vulnerabilities exist

**Blind spot consideration:** If we see "3+", it would likely be due to:
1. Rapid contagion event (2023-style)
2. Unforeseen macro shock
3. Clustered CRE failures

This scenario is plausible but not indicated by current evidence. 15% captures this tail risk without overweighting it.

**Final distribution:**
- "0": 0% (already have 1 failure - impossible)
- "1": 55% (most likely - matches 2025, calm markets, idiosyncratic)
- "2": 30% (meaningful risk - time remains, Polymarket, clustering)
- "3+": 15% (tail risk - 2023 precedent, systemic vulnerabilities)

# Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Count U.S. bank failures Jan 1-Apr 30, 2026, per FDIC list. Options: 0, 1, 2, 3+. Already at 1 (Metropolitan Capital, Jan 30).

2. **Base rate:** 2018-2025 Jan-Apr: 50% had 0, 25% had 1, 25% had 2, 0% had 3+. Conditional on 1 by early Feb: 2025 stayed at 1, 2020 went to 2.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = "1" (no more failures); Least likely = "0" (impossible, already happened). Makes sense - matches recent pattern and calm market reaction.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 1 confirmed failure Jan 30 (Metropolitan Capital) - factual, definitive
   - Muted market reaction (bank ETFs up) - factual, indicates no contagion
   - 70% of prediction window remains - factual, increases exposure
   - Polymarket 18% for another by March 31 - market opinion with money at stake
   - 2025 had 1 Jan-Apr failure, no additional - strong historical analog

5. **Blind spot:** Rapid clustering event (like March 2023 SVB/Signature) triggered by unforeseen shock or CRE contagion. Would make "3+" more likely. This risk captured in 15% tail probability.

6. **Technical check:** 0 + 55 + 30 + 15 = 100 ✓

**Probabilities:** [0, 55, 30, 15]
