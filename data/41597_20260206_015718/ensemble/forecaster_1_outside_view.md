Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FDIC Official Sources:**
- **Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust failure notice (Jan 30, 2026)**: Primary authoritative source documenting the first 2026 failure. FDIC is the definitive source for U.S. bank failures. This is factual, not opinion.
- **FDIC Failed Bank Summary**: Historical reference showing bank failures 2001-2023, with concentration during 2008-2014 financial crisis. Factual data but incomplete extraction.

**News Articles (Feb 2026):**
- **Benzinga (Feb 2026)**: Reports Metropolitan Capital failure with specific details ($261.1M assets, $212.1M deposits, $19.7M cost to DIF). Includes Polymarket prediction market data showing 18% probability of another failure by March 31. Market opinion data (ETF performance) is factual; trader sentiment is aggregated opinion but from identifiable market participants.
- **TS2.tech (Feb 2026)**: Confirms Metropolitan Capital closure on Jan 31 (note: FDIC says Jan 30, minor discrepancy). Provides context on 2025 failures (Pulaski Savings Bank, Santa Anna National Bank). Factual reporting.
- **Maaal.com (Feb 6, 2026)**: Headline mentions first 2026 failure but content extraction incomplete. Limited utility.

**Promotional Content:**
- **ITM Trading (Feb 3, 2026)**: While confirming Metropolitan Capital failure facts, this is promotional content from a precious metals dealer. Claims about "systemic cracks," "imploding" CRE loans, and FDIC fund vulnerability are opinions designed to sell gold/silver. Should be discounted heavily except for basic facts.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive analysis citing FDIC data. Key factual findings:
- Only 1 failure Jan 1 - Feb 5, 2026 (Metropolitan Capital)
- Historical Jan-Apr failure counts 2010-2025 showing clear downward trend
- 2023 had 2 Jan-Apr failures (SVB, Signature - both March)
- 2024 had 1 (Republic First - April)
- 2025 had 1 (Pulaski - January)
- Identifies $337B unrealized securities losses system-wide (Q3 2025 FDIC data)
- Notes regulatory preparation for potential failures (FDIC deal templates published Jan 2026)

The agent report mixes factual FDIC data with analytical interpretation. Regulatory signals are factual; implications are reasoned analysis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Post-2018 "new normal" period (2018-2025)**: Most relevant. After post-crisis cleanup ended, failures became rare events. Jan-Apr counts: 0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1 (average 0.75/year, median 0.5).

2. **Post-SVB period (2023-2025)**: Captures recent elevated stress from rate shock. Jan-Apr counts: 2,1,1 (average 1.33/year). However, small sample size.

3. **Full post-crisis period (2013-2025)**: Broader but includes declining trend. Jan-Apr average ~3.2 failures, but heavily skewed by early years.

4. **2010-2012 crisis aftermath**: Not relevant - fundamentally different regulatory and economic environment.

**Selected Reference Class:** Post-2018 period (2018-2025) is most appropriate. This captures the current regulatory regime, post-crisis capital standards, and low-failure environment. The 2023 SVB/Signature failures were large but idiosyncratic events related to specific interest rate risk and crypto exposure.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** January 1 - April 30, 2026 (120 days total)
**Time Elapsed:** January 1 - February 5, 2026 (36 days, 30% of period)
**Time Remaining:** February 6 - April 30, 2026 (84 days, 70% of period)

**Historical Jan-Apr Patterns (2018-2025):**
- 2018: 0 failures
- 2019: 0 failures (first failure was May 31)
- 2020: 2 failures (Feb 14, Apr 3)
- 2021: 0 failures
- 2022: 0 failures
- 2023: 2 failures (both in March - SVB on 10th, Signature on 12th)
- 2024: 1 failure (April 26)
- 2025: 1 failure (January 17)

**Pattern Observations:**
- Failures cluster: When they occur, often multiple happen close together (2020: 2 within 7 weeks; 2023: 2 within 2 days)
- Timing varies: No strong monthly pattern, though March-April shows slight concentration
- Recent trend: 1 failure per year in 2024-2025

**Current Status:** 1 failure already occurred (Jan 30, 2026), matching the pace of 2024-2025.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Reference Class:**
Over 2018-2025 (8 years), Jan-Apr periods saw: 0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1 failures.
- 0 failures: 4 years (50%)
- 1 failure: 2 years (25%)
- 2 failures: 2 years (25%)
- 3+ failures: 0 years (0%)

**Adjustments for 2026 Context:**

*Factors suggesting lower additional failures:*
- Already had 1 failure; historically, years with failures rarely exceed 2 in Jan-Apr post-2018
- Metropolitan Capital was small ($261M assets) and idiosyncratic (CRE/nursing home exposure)
- Market reaction was muted (regional bank ETFs rose)
- FDIC fund remains well-capitalized
- Regulatory scrutiny heightened after 2023

*Factors suggesting potential additional failures:*
- $337B unrealized securities losses system-wide remain
- CRE refinancing pressures ongoing
- 70% of prediction window remains
- FDIC published new resolution templates (January 2026) suggesting preparation
- Failures can cluster (2023, 2020 examples)
- Polymarket pricing 18% chance of another failure by March 31

**Critical Insight:** We've already observed 1 failure. The question is whether we'll see 0, 1, or 2+ additional failures in the remaining 84 days.

Given the base rate and current conditions, the most likely outcome is 0 additional failures (final count: 1 total). However, the possibility of 1-2 more cannot be dismissed given clustering patterns and ongoing systemic pressures.

Outside view calibration:

**Baseline from Reference Class:**
Conditional on already having 1 failure by early February:
- 2020: Started with 1 in Feb, ended with 2 total (1 more in April)
- 2023: Had 0 in Jan-Feb, then 2 in March
- 2024: Had 0 in Jan-Feb, then 1 in April  
- 2025: Had 1 in January, ended with 1 total

Of the 4 years with Jan-Apr failures (2020, 2023, 2024, 2025), only 2020 exceeded 1 failure after having an early failure.

**Probability Calibration:**

Given we're at 1 failure with 70% of the window remaining:

- **0 total (meaning no more failures)**: This would match 2025 pattern. Most likely given the idiosyncratic nature of Metropolitan Capital's failure and muted market reaction. However, 70% of time remains, and clustering risk exists. **Estimate: 45-55%**

- **1 total (current status - no more)**: Already achieved. See above.

- **2 total (1 more failure)**: Would match 2020 pattern. CRE stress, unrealized losses, and clustering tendency support this. Polymarket's 18% for another failure by March 31 seems reasonable but slightly low given full April remains. **Estimate: 25-35%**

- **3+ total (2+ more failures)**: Would be unprecedented in post-2018 period. Only 2023 had 2 failures, and both occurred simultaneously. Multiple additional failures would require systemic stress not currently evident. **Estimate: 5-15%**

**Calibration Check:**
- Am I overconfident in "1 total"? The base rate shows 50% of years had 0 failures, but we've already deviated from that.
- Am I underweighting tail risk? 2023 showed 2 failures can happen suddenly.
- Polymarket's 18% for another failure by March 31 provides market-based anchor; extending through April 30 should increase this.

**Final Distribution Logic:**
- "1" (no more failures): 50% - most likely continuation of 2025 pattern
- "2" (one more): 30% - meaningful clustering risk, CRE pressures
- "0" (impossible - already have 1): 0%
- "3+" (two+ more): 20% - tail risk from systemic issues, cannot dismiss given 2023 precedent

Outside View Prediction:
0: 0%
1: 50%
2: 30%
3+: 20%
