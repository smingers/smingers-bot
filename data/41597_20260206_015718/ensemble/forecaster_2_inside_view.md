Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary/Regulatory Sources (High Quality):**
- **FDIC Failed Bank List & Metropolitan Capital Bank press release (Jan 30-31, 2026)**: Official regulatory source. Confirms exactly 1 failure in January 2026 (Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Chicago, $261M assets). Pure fact, no opinion. Highest quality.
- **FDIC 2026 Bank Failures Summary (Jan 30, 2026)**: Official data showing 1 failure in January 2026. Factual only.

**Financial News Outlets (Medium-High Quality):**
- **Bankrate (Dec 20, 2025)**: Historical context showing 2 failures each in 2024-2025, down from 5 in 2023. Facts sourced from FDIC. Notes that "a few failures typically happen each year" - this is editorial opinion but reflects historical pattern.
- **Benzinga (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports Metropolitan Capital failure and cites Polymarket prediction market showing 18% probability of another failure by March 31, 2026. The 18% figure is objective market data; interpretation is moderate quality.
- **Chicago Tribune (Feb 2, 2026)**: Detailed reporting on Metropolitan Capital failure, including specific loan issues ($4.5M skilled-nursing facility loan). Factual reporting with regulatory quotes.
- **Coinfomania (Jan 31, 2026)**: Reports Metropolitan Capital failure. Contains factual core from FDIC but includes speculative crypto-influencer commentary about "systemic stress" - opinions lack expert attribution and are promotional in nature. Low weight for opinions.

**Market/Economic Context (Moderate Quality):**
- **Multiple central bank articles (Feb 5-6, 2026)**: ECB and BoE holding rates, inflation concerns, economic slowdown signals. Relevant for macro stress but indirect connection to small bank failures. Moderate evidence of continued economic pressure.
- **US jobs/economic data (Feb 5, 2026)**: Rising jobless claims (231k vs 210k expected), job openings down to 6.5M from 7.5M. Signals weakening economy but not immediate bank stress. Weak-to-moderate evidence.

**Speculative/Low Quality:**
- **Russian bank failure articles**: Irrelevant to US context; disregard.
- **Precious metals volatility articles**: Gold/silver crash on Jan 29-30, 2026. Reflects broader market stress but no direct causal link to small US bank failures. Weak evidence.
- **Bill Holter prediction article (Jan 27, 2026)**: Predicts COMEX delivery failure by March 2026 leading to systemic collapse. Pure speculation from precious metals promoter, no expert consensus. Disregard.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **One confirmed failure already occurred (Jan 30, 2026)**: Metropolitan Capital Bank. This eliminates the "0" outcome and establishes we're in a year with at least some failure activity. (Strong - eliminates option)
- **Historical reference class (2016-2025)**: In years with ≥1 Jan-Apr failure, final counts were 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3. Mean conditional on ≥1 early failure ≈ 1.8. (Strong - establishes base rate)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Polymarket prediction (18% for another failure by March 31)**: Market-based forecast suggesting low probability of additional failures. Implies ~82% chance of exactly 1 total failure through March. (Moderate - informed consensus)
- **Market stability post-failure**: Banking ETFs rose 1-2% after Metropolitan Capital closure. No contagion signals, suggesting isolated incident. (Moderate - indicates containment)
- **Small bank characteristics**: Metropolitan Capital had $261M assets - very small. Failure due to idiosyncratic credit issue ($4.5M bad loan), not systemic stress. (Moderate - suggests isolation)
- **Economic headwinds**: Weakening labor market, CRE stress mentioned in supervisory reports, unrealized securities losses at banks. (Moderate - ongoing structural pressure)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Crypto influencer warnings**: Social media speculation about contagion lacks expert backing. (Weak - noise)
- **Precious metals volatility**: Reflects broader uncertainty but no direct mechanism to small bank failures. (Weak - tangential)
- **"No failures in 2025" claim in one source**: Contradicted by FDIC data showing 2 failures in 2025. (Disregard - factually wrong)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Remaining window**: Feb 5 - Apr 30, 2026 = 85 days (71% of Jan-Apr period remains)

**Historical timing patterns**: 
- Bank failures often cluster in March/April (SVB/Signature March 2023, Republic First April 2024)
- Supervisory actions typically follow quarterly reporting cycles (March 31 is Q1 end)
- The 85 remaining days represent the highest-risk period historically

**If timeframe were halved (42 days)**: Would increase confidence in "1" outcome to ~70%, as less time for additional supervisory actions. "2" would drop to ~20%, "3+" to ~10%.

**If timeframe were doubled (170 days, through July)**: Would shift distribution toward higher counts. "1" might drop to ~40%, "2" to ~35%, "3+" to ~25%, reflecting increased opportunity for additional failures.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate for full Jan-Apr period in 2016-2025 regime: Mean = 1.1 failures, distribution heavily weighted toward 0-1.

**Major shifts from outside view**:

1. **One failure already confirmed** → "0" is now impossible (was ~40% in outside view). This probability mass must redistribute.

2. **Conditional distribution given ≥1 early failure**: Only 2 historical precedents (2017, 2025) had failures by early February. Outcomes were 3 and 1 respectively. Small sample but suggests bimodal risk: either isolated incident (like 2025) or start of cluster (like 2017).

3. **Current evidence strongly favors isolation**:
   - Polymarket at 18% for additional failure signals informed consensus of containment
   - Market reaction (banking stocks up) shows no contagion fears
   - Failure cause was idiosyncratic (single bad loan), not systemic
   - No other banks showing acute distress signals in news

4. **Modest upside risk remains**:
   - 85 days remaining includes high-risk March/April period
   - Ongoing CRE stress and unrealized losses create latent vulnerability
   - 2017 precedent showed 3 total failures after early-year start
   - Economic weakness (rising jobless claims) adds background pressure

**Calibration logic**:
- Base case (1 total = no more failures): Strong evidence of isolation + Polymarket consensus + market stability. Raise from outside view's conditional 57% to ~65%.
- Moderate case (2 total = 1 more failure): Historical precedent (2/6 years with failures ended at 2) + remaining high-risk period + latent CRE stress. Keep near outside view at ~25%.
- High case (3+ total = 2+ more failures): Only 2017 precedent + tail risk from macro headwinds. Modest increase from outside view's 15% to ~10% given strong isolation evidence.

**Why shifts are justified**: The Metropolitan Capital failure appears genuinely idiosyncratic (bad loan, small bank, clean resolution, no contagion). This is materially different from 2023's rate-shock failures or 2017's cluster. Current circumstances more closely resemble 2024-2025 (isolated small bank issues) than 2017 (multiple weak banks failing). The Polymarket signal (82% no more failures) represents informed consensus and should carry weight.

## Probability Calibration

**Option "0"**: Impossible given confirmed January failure. **0%**

**Option "1"** (no additional failures):
- Polymarket consensus (~82% through March)
- Market stability signals
- Idiosyncratic failure characteristics
- But: 85 days remain, including historically high-risk March/April
- Calibrate to **65%** (up from outside view's 57% due to strong isolation evidence)

**Option "2"** (1 additional failure):
- Historical precedent: 2 of 6 failure-years ended at 2 total
- Remaining time includes Q1 reporting cycle
- Latent CRE/economic stress provides plausible pathway
- Calibrate to **25%** (near outside view's 28%)

**Option "3+"** (2+ additional failures):
- Only 2017 precedent (3 total)
- Would require either: (a) hidden cluster of weak banks, or (b) sudden systemic shock
- Current evidence argues against both
- But: tail risk from macro uncertainty, cannot rule out entirely
- Calibrate to **10%** (down from outside view's 15% given strong isolation evidence)

**Consistency check**: Most likely = "1" (65%); Least likely = "0" (0%) and "3+" (10%). This aligns with evidence showing isolated incident but non-zero risk of additional failures in remaining high-risk period.

**Blind spot**: If multiple small banks have hidden exposure to similar idiosyncratic risks (e.g., other troubled skilled-nursing facility loans, CRE concentration), supervisors might close 2-3 more in March/April. This would make "2" or "3+" correct. However, no current evidence suggests such a cluster exists, and banking system stress tests have improved since 2023.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Count US bank failures Jan 1 - Apr 30, 2026, per FDIC list. Options: 0, 1, 2, or 3+. One failure confirmed (Jan 30).

2. **Base rate**: Outside view for 2016-2025 Jan-Apr: mean 1.1, conditional on ≥1 early failure: 1-3 range. Current prediction anchored to this but adjusted for isolation evidence.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = "1" (65%); Least likely = "0" (impossible) and "3+" (10%). Aligns with isolated failure + modest tail risk.

4. **Key evidence**: (a) Metropolitan Capital failure idiosyncratic/isolated; (b) Polymarket 18% for more failures signals consensus; (c) Banking stocks stable post-failure; (d) 85 days remain in high-risk period; (e) No other acute distress signals visible.

5. **Blind spot**: Hidden cluster of weak small banks with similar exposures could trigger 2-3 more failures in March/April, making "2" or "3+" correct. Would shift ~15-20% from "1" to higher buckets.

6. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
