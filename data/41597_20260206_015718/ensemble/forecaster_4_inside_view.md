Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, material to the question)

1. FDIC Failed Bank List, Jan-30-2026 entry (Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust).
   • Primary, official, contemporaneous. Fact: 1 bank failure in 2026, closing date 30 Jan.

2. FDIC “2026 Bank Failures In Brief” page (30 Jan 26).
   • Same data, official. No opinion, only facts.

3. Chicago Tribune (2 Feb 26) & Coinfomania (31 Jan 26).
   • Local reporting on the same failure; factual details consistent with FDIC.  Minor opinion (“isolated event”) from regulators; regulators are credible.

4. Benzinga (2 Feb 26) summarising Polymarket odds.
   • Gives a market-based probability: 18 % chance of another failure by 31 Mar 26.  Market data are noisy but useful; methodology transparent.

5. Bankrate (20 Dec 25) & Yahoo Finance (14 Nov 25) – historical tallies 2001-2025.
   • Reliable, fact-based history; no forward opinion.

6. FDIC/S&C memo on resolution planning (Jan 26).
   • Procedural; indicates no acute systemic stress.  Weak direct relevance.

7. Macro/market stories (Asknews feed, Zero Hedge, etc.).
   • Contain opinions but not by banking-regulation experts; only indirectly relevant (macro backdrop).  Treated as weak evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• Official FDIC list shows exactly one failure so far (structural, definitive).
• Base-rate history 2016-2025: 0.7 failures on average in Jan-Apr (strong historical pattern).

Moderate evidence
• Polymarket traders price an 18 % chance of ≥1 additional failure by 31 Mar (independent, incentive-compatible signal).
• High-rate / flat-yield-curve environment continues, modestly elevating community-bank stress (logical causal link).

Weak evidence
• Media speculation about precious-metal turmoil, geopolitics, etc. – little causal connection to community-bank solvency over 3 months.

(c) Timeframe analysis
• Days until resolution: 86 (Feb 5 → Apr 30).
• If the window were halved (43 days) I would cut the “≥1 more failure” probability roughly one-third, since failures usually need weeks of supervisory preparation.
• If doubled (172 days) I would add ~40 % relative to current chance of additional failures.

(d) Justification / inside-view update
1. Conditioning on one failure already removes the 50 % historical likelihood of zero; remaining base-rate years with an early-year failure (2017, 2025) ended the period with exactly one. 
2. Community-bank fundamentals are weaker than in 2021-2022 but regulators are alert post-2023; most interest-rate risk has been recognised.
3. Incentive-weighted market (Polymarket) implies λ ≈ 0.10 failures / month for the near term.  Applying that over the remaining 2.8 months gives an expected 0.28 extra failures.
4. Poisson(0.28) → 21 % chance of exactly one more, 3 % chance of two or more.  I round upward slightly for model uncertainty and data-lag risk.
5. I retain a 1 % tail that FDIC later dates the Metropolitan failure to 2025 or delists it (very unlikely but preserves coherence).

Probability calibration
Final distribution (Jan 1 – Apr 30 2026 failures):

0 failures (list shows none).............1 %
1 failure (only Metropolitan)............74 %
2 failures................................20 %
3 or more failures........................5 %

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: 0, 1, 2, 3+ US bank failures with FDIC closing dates 1 Jan–30 Apr 2026.  
2. Base-rate (2016-25 Jan-Apr): 0 (50 %), 1 (30 %), 2 (20 %), 3+ (0 %).  
3. Consistency: Most likely = 1; least likely = 0. Makes sense.  
4. Key evidence: (a) FDIC list shows 1; (b) historical early-year failure years stayed at 1; (c) Polymarket 18 % by 31 Mar; (d) macro stress moderate, supervision tighter.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden deposit run at one regional bank triggering two‐to-three small companion closures in April. Would shift ‘3+’ up sharply.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0 and 100, no % sign.

Probabilities: [1, 74, 20, 5]
