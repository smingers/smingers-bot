Analysis
(a) Source analysis (key items only)

1. FDIC Failed-Bank List & 30 Jan 2026 Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust release – primary regulator, factual, dated inside window.  One confirmed failure (facts, no opinion).

2. FDIC “2026 bank-failures in brief” page, 30 Jan 2026 – corroborates single January failure; regulator source.

3. Bankrate recap 20 Dec 2025 – reliable consumer-finance site summarising historical failures through 2025.  Mostly data; the “few failures each year” sentence is opinion.

4. Polymarket market (resolved 31 Jan 2026) – credible prediction-market price history; shows traders put 18 % on another failure by 31 Mar 2026.  Forward-looking, but thinly capitalised compared with large financial markets.

5. Benzinga 2 Feb 2026 – reputable market-news desk; repeats FDIC facts, notes Polymarket odds, cites calm equity reaction.  Opinions limited to “isolated” characterisation.

6. Chicago Tribune 2 Feb 2026 – mainstream newspaper; factual background on Metropolitan failure.

7. Sullivan & Cromwell memo 4 Jan 2026 – law-firm note on FDIC resolution-planning update; policy/factual, no forecasts.

All other Asknews articles discuss macro or foreign developments—not directly predictive of U.S. bank failures in the next 85 days—hence weighted very lightly.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• FDIC list confirms exactly one failure as of 5 Feb 2026.  
• Post-2018 history: in 8 recent years Jan-Apr produced 0–2 failures except crisis 2023 (two).  Tail >2 has not occurred outside 2009–2013.

Moderate evidence
• Years that begin with a January failure (2020, 2023, 2025) finished Jan-Apr with either 1 or 2 total (1/3 vs 2/3).  
• Polymarket’s 18 % probability of ≥1 more failure by 31 Mar implies roughly 22-25 % by 30 Apr (simple time-extension).

Weak evidence
• Commentators calling Metropolitan “isolated”, macro chatter on CRE stress, precious-metal volatility, etc.  Provide colour but little quantified predictive power.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution window left: 85 days (≈ 2.8 months).  If that window were halved (42 days) I would raise “exactly 1” by ~8 pts and cut “2”/“3+” proportionally; if doubled (170 days) I would lower “1” 10-12 pts and raise “3+” 6-8 pts.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Base-rate after removing impossible “0” (from recent 8-year reference class conditioned on an early failure):  
1 = 33 %, 2 = 67 %, 3+ ≈ 0 %.

Adjustments:  
+ Market/ regulator narrative of idiosyncratic event → shifts weight from “2” to “1”.  
+ Prediction-market 18 % by 31 Mar → implies total probability of another failure ~25-30 % by 30 Apr; keeps some mass on “2”.  
+ CRE stress, still-elevated unrealised bond losses → small fat-tail for “3+”.  
Combining: upscale “1” to low-60s, “2” mid-20s, retain low-teens for “3+”.

Probability calibration
Option ‘0’ (0 additional failures): Impossible because one already occurred.  
Option ‘1’ (exactly 1 total): 62   
Option ‘2’ (exactly 2 total): 25   
Option ‘3+’ (three or more total): 13   
(Sum = 100)

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: count of U.S. FDIC-insured bank failures 1 Jan–30 Apr 2026: 0, 1, 2, 3+.  
2. Outside view used 2018-2025 Jan-Apr data after conditioning on early failure.  
3. Most likely = ‘1’; least likely = ‘0’ (impossible), then ‘3+’.  Consistent with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: one confirmed failure; conditional pattern of past early-failure years; Polymarket ~25 % chance extra; calm bank equity spreads; absence of medium-size bank stress headlines.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden CRE-linked failure of a regional ($10-50 bn) bank in March triggering knock-ons → would push outcome to ‘3+’.  I assign 13 % for this.  
6. Probabilities 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [0, 62, 25, 13]
