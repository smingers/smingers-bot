Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FDIC press release on Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust (30 Jan 2026) – primary regulator, entirely factual, confirms one 2026 failure within the scoring window.  
2. ITM-Trading blog post (3 Feb 2026) – promotional precious-metals vendor. Factual core (Metropolitan closure and balance-sheet data) is correct but the systemic-risk narrative is sales-driven opinion. Limited value.  
3. FDIC “Failed Bank Summary” historical table – regulator-compiled data, high factual reliability, covers 2001-2023. No forward-looking views.  
4. Maaal.com headline (6 Feb 2026) – content missing; cannot be used.  
5. Benzinga article (4 Feb 2026) – reputable market-news outlet. Facts match FDIC release. Includes Polymarket implied probability (18 % for another failure by 31 Mar 2026) – a data point from an identifiable prediction market.  
6. TS2.tech article (1 Feb 2026) – secondary summary, facts trace back to FDIC. Medium reliability.  
7. Agent report (5 Feb 2026) – compiles FDIC counts for 2010-2025 Jan-Apr window and surveys current supervisory/macroeconomic commentary. Uses public primary data; transparent methodology; treated as moderately reliable synthesis.

Factual content retained: the single 2026 failure, Jan-Apr counts for 2010-2025, Polymarket 18 % quote, macro commentary that CRE and unrealised losses remain head-winds. Opinion content (ITM’s “systemic cracks”, Benzinga’s “idiosyncratic story”) set aside except where echoed by regulators or markets.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes for “number of U.S. bank failures Jan-Apr”:  

1. 2000-2025 full sample (26 years) – includes extraordinary crisis years; base rate for 3+ is very high but arguably overstates 2026 risk.  
2. Post-GFC quiet period 2018-2025 (8 years) – banking environment, regulation and interest-rate regime closer to today.  
3. Conditional “years with ≥1 failure by 31 Jan” in 2016-2025 (4 years) – adjusts for the fact we already have the first failure.  

Suitability: #2 provides the most neutral outside view (recent regulatory regime, but before conditioning on the early failure). I adopt #2 as the main reference class, then apply a modest upward adjustment from #3.

Base-rate frequencies for 2018-2025 (Jan-Apr)  
0 failures – 50 % (4/8)  
1 failure – 25 % (2/8)  
2 failures – 25 % (2/8)  
3+ failures – 0 % (0/8)

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 5 Feb 2026. Days remaining until 30 Apr 2026: 85. Historically, when a second failure occurred in a “quiet” year (2020, 2023), it followed the first by 7-45 days and still fell inside the Jan-Apr window. Thus the bulk of additional-failure risk is front-loaded into the next six to eight weeks.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• The recent-years base rate alone would assign 50 % to “0”, 25 % to “1”, etc., but “0” is now impossible. Probabilities must be renormalised across the feasible outcomes (1, 2, 3+).  
• Conditional adjustment for the early-failure signal: Of the eight years 2018-2025, only three had an early failure (2020, 2023, 2025). Their distributions at period-end were:  
 – Exactly 1 failure: 1/3 years (2025)  
 – Exactly 2 failures: 2/3 years (2020, 2023)  
 – 3+ failures: 0/3 years  
 This suggests a rough 33 %/67 % split between “1” and “2”, still very low odds for “3+”.  
• Macro/supervisory context: CRE stress, unrealised securities losses and FDIC “ready-to-fail” preparations marginally raise tail risk, but market measures (Polymarket 18 % by 31 Mar; stable regional-bank equity/credit spreads) point to limited contagion expectations.  
• Combining the recent-years base rate with the early-failure conditional evidence and current market calm, I overweight “1” but give a meaningful (≈30-40 %) chance to at least one more small-bank failure, with most of that mass in the “exactly 2” bucket. The fat-tail scenario of 3+ remains possible if a mid-sized CRE-heavy bank tips over, yet still looks uncommon outside of crisis years, so I cap it below 20 %.

Outside view calibration:
1. Remove impossible outcome “0” (probability 0 %).  
2. Start from conditional frequencies after an early failure (≈33 %/67 %/0 %).  
3. Blend in (a) market-implied 18 % chance of any additional failure by 31 Mar, which loosely maps to about 25 % by 30 Apr, and (b) expert commentary that stresses are contained but non-negligible. That pulls probability of “no more failures” upward relative to the simple conditional base.  
4. Apply a small (≈10 %) tail to “3+” to reflect modest systemic-risk factors absent in 2018-2025.  
5. Normalise to 100 %.

Outside View Prediction:
Option '0': 0%  
Option '1': 55%  
Option '2': 28%  
Option '3+': 17%
