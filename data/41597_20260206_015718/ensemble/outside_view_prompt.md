You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
How many US banks will fail from January through April 2026?

Question background:
A [bank failure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-failure.asp) occurs when a bank is unable to meet its financial obligations because it lacks sufficient assets or liquidity. In the United States, the vast majority of banks are insured by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) (FDIC), which guarantees deposits up to \$250,000 and supervises the stability of the banking system.

Since October 1, 2000, the FDIC has comprehensively tracked failed banks under its insurance in the [FDIC Failed Bank List](https://www.fdic.gov/bank-failures/failed-bank-list). As of January 2026, 572 insured bank failures appear on the list.

The options are: ['0', '1', '2', '3+']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as the number of United States bank failures that occur on or after January 1, 2026, and before May 1, 2026.

The primary source for this question will be the [FDIC Failed Bank List](https://www.fdic.gov/bank-failures/failed-bank-list); however, credible sources may also be used if the FDIC's list appears to be incomplete.

## Summary of Article

**Key Facts:**
- The article's headline indicates there has been a first US bank failure of 2026, with the FDIC taking over to protect customer deposits.

**Limitation/Disclaimer:**
The extracted content appears to be incomplete or poorly formatted. The main body of the article about the US bank failure is not present in the provided text. Instead, the content shows:
- A list of other unrelated financial headlines (Saudi banks' profits, Saudi Awwal Bank results, SIMAH corporate identity launch, statements from BlackRock CEO and Mukesh Ambani about gold investment, and Bank of England interest rate decision)
- A timestamp of "6 February 2026 - 04:57 AM"

The headline suggests this article would contain information about a US bank failure in early 2026 (specifically around February 6, 2026 based on the timestamp), but the actual article content describing which bank failed, details about the failure, or FDIC actions is not included in the extracted text. To properly assess this information for forecasting purposes, the full article content would be needed.

## Summary of Article: First US Bank Failure of 2026

**Key Facts:**

1. **Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust** became the first U.S. bank to fail in 2026 after Illinois regulators shut down the small Chicago lender on **January 30, 2026**.

2. The FDIC stepped in as receiver and brokered a handoff to **First Independence Bank**, which assumed all deposits.

3. **Bank size and cost:**
   - Metropolitan had $261.1 million in assets and $212.1 million in deposits as of September 30, 2025
   - FDIC estimated the cleanup will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund **$19.7 million**

4. **Cause of failure:** Court records and commercial real estate reporting show Metropolitan spent years working through a $4.5 million loan tied to a troubled skilled-nursing facility. The bank alleged it was misled by the borrower's representations, indicating underwriting and due diligence issues.

5. **Historical context:** There were only **two nationwide bank failures in 2025**, both small, local institutions. This is Chicago's second bank failure in as many years.

**Market Opinions:**

1. **Polymarket traders** (prediction market data): Pricing in an **18% probability** of another U.S. bank failure by March 31, 2026.

2. **Market reaction:** The banking sector showed positive performance following the announcement:
   - SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE): up ~2%
   - SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE): up ~1.7%
   - Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF): up ~0.8%

3. The market is treating this as an idiosyncratic, small-bank credit story rather than the start of regional-bank contagion.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide FDIC failed bank entries from 1 Jan 2026 to 5 Feb 2026 and counts of U.S. bank failures occurring Jan-Apr each year 2010-2025; summarize any regulatory or market signals pointing to potential near-term failures
1. FDIC-reported failures from 1 Jan 2026 – 5 Feb 2026  
Only one U.S.-insured depository institution has failed in the period:  
• Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Chicago IL – closed 30 Jan 2026, $261.1 million in assets, $212.1 million in deposits; deposits and almost all assets assumed by First Independence Bank, Detroit MI; estimated cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) $19.7 million (FDIC “2026 Bank Failures” page, dated 30 Jan 2026; American Banker, 31 Jan 2026; Chicago Sun-Times, 31 Jan 2026).

No other FDIC failures are listed through the FDIC “in brief” log or the master Failed Bank List as of 5 Feb 2026.

2. Number of U.S. bank failures that occurred between 1 January and 30 April, 2010-2025  
Counts are derived by tallying closing dates in the public FDIC Failed Bank List for each year and cross-checking with the year-by-year tables published by Bankrate (which reproduce FDIC data) [Bankrate, 20 Dec 2025] and individual FDIC yearly pages. While day-to-day totals fluctuate slightly as receiverships are finalised, the FDIC numbers are considered definitive for regulatory purposes.

Year – Jan-Apr failures  
2010    64  
2011    39  
2012    22  
2013    10  
2014    9  
2015    4  
2016    2 (North Milwaukee State Bank, 11 Mar; Trust Company Bank, 29 Apr)  
2017    3 (Harvest Community 13 Jan; Seaway Bank 27 Jan; First NBC Bank 28 Apr)  
2018    0  
2019    0 (first 2019 failure was 31 May)  
2020    2 (Ericson State Bank 14 Feb; The First State Bank 3 Apr)  
2021    0  
2022    0  
2023    2 (Silicon Valley Bank 10 Mar; Signature Bank 12 Mar)  
2024    1 (Republic First Bank 26 Apr)  
2025    1 (Pulaski Savings Bank 17 Jan)

These figures show three clear phases:  
• Post-crisis clean-up (2010-2012) with very high early-year tallies;  
• Steady decline 2013-2017 as credit quality improved;  
• Near-dormant period 2018-2022, punctured by the ­mid-2023 trio of high-profile failures; low single-digit counts resumed in 2024-2025.

3. Regulatory and market signals of possible near-term stress

a. Persistent unrealised securities losses and CRE exposure  
The FDIC’s latest quarterly commentary (Q3-2025) cited roughly $337 billion of unrealised losses on banks’ securities portfolios system-wide, a legacy of the 2022-2023 rate shock (CryptoRank summary, 1 Feb 2026, citing the FDIC data). Those paper losses reduce flexibility for smaller and mid-size institutions if liquidity drains again. Commercial real-estate refinancing risk remains elevated, with about US$3 trillion of CRE loans still on bank balance-sheets (CryptoRank; Deloitte 2026 Banking Outlook).

b. Funding-cost squeeze and weaker earnings at regionals  
Fourth-quarter 2025 results from several regional banks showed margin compression and, in some cases, deposit runoff (Investopedia market briefing, 16 Jan 2026). While large universal banks reported solid trading income, mid-tier lenders emphasised cost-cutting and stock-buy-backs rather than growth, suggesting caution ahead of expected Fed easing later in 2026.

c. Regulators preparing for quicker resolutions  
The FDIC in January 2026 published public “deal templates” and expanded guidance for potential bidders in advance of failures (CUToday article, undated 2026). The agency says the materials are intended to accelerate whole-bank purchase-and-assumption (P&A) transactions, reflecting lessons from the protracted 2023 Silicon Valley Bank process. Earlier preparation indicates supervisors still see a non-zero probability of additional failures and want to minimise disruption.

d. Supervisory focus shifting to technology-driven risks  
U.K. MPs’ calls for AI-specific stress testing (Guardian, 20 Jan 2026; Banking Exchange, 21 Jan 2026) echo concerns U.S. regulators have aired informally: concentration of critical cloud/AI service providers and model herding could amplify shocks. While the remarks come from the U.K., global regulatory coordination means similar themes are likely to appear in upcoming U.S. supervisory guidance.

e. Market-price “canaries”  
The coincidence of Metropolitan Capital’s closure with a sharp unwinding in gold, silver and bitcoin prices (CryptoRank, 1 Feb 2026) highlights how even a small failure can exacerbate fragile sentiment when markets are already de-risking. Although one data point does not make a trend, it reinforces that liquidity conditions remain tight; further adverse asset-price moves could feed back into banks’ balance-sheets.

f. Macro backdrop for 2026  
Deloitte’s 2026 outlook foresees slower GDP growth (≈1.4 %), a steeper but still-inverted yield curve and only modest expansion in net-interest income, with deposit competition still intense. The report flags elevated household leverage and possible upticks in credit-card and student-loan delinquencies. Together, those indicators imply that thinly capitalised or poorly diversified lenders could face renewed pressure if rate cuts arrive more slowly than markets expect.

4. Information gaps and recommended follow-up

• Exact Jan-Apr failure tallies for 2010-2012 were reconstructed from contemporaneous FDIC lists but should be confirmed by running a filter on the FDIC failed-bank CSV (OpenSanctions hosts an updated copy).  
• Granular data on unrealised securities losses by bank-size group, and on wholesale-funding reliance, would allow a more targeted watch-list; these are available in the FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile and the Federal Reserve H.8 series.  
• No public enforcement actions against Metropolitan Capital Bank officers have yet been posted; monitor the FDIC Enforcement Decisions & Orders page for developments.  
• With only one 2026 failure so far, trend analysis is premature; monitoring weekly changes in the Fed’s “Deposits, small domestically chartered banks” series and secondary-market spreads on regional-bank bonds would provide forward indicators.

If higher precision or additional context is required, the following searches would help:  
• “FDIC failed banks CSV download” to pull the raw file and automate date-range counts.  
• “FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile Q3 2025 unrealized losses” for the latest hard numbers.  
• “Federal Reserve H.8 deposit data February 2026” for current deposit-outflow trends.  
• “Commercial real estate bank exam guidance 2026” to capture any new supervisory releases.  
• “FDIC enforcement order Metropolitan Capital Bank” to track post-failure investigations.

Overall, while U.S. bank-failure activity remains low compared with the post-GFC era, the combination of still-large mark-to-market losses, CRE repricing, and tight funding costs keeps smaller institutions vulnerable. Regulators’ push for faster resolutions and ongoing public-template releases suggest they are preparing for additional—though likely sporadic—failures in 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
