Analysis:
To gauge how many U.S. banks might fail between January-April 2026 we first need to confirm whether any failures have already occurred (Jan 1 – Feb 5 2026) and gather signals of additional stress. The most relevant information will therefore include:
• Updates to the FDIC Failed Bank List for 2026.  
• News reports of any banks closed or put into FDIC receivership this year.  
• Articles discussing imminent risk factors, enforcement actions, or analysts’ forecasts about further U.S. bank failures through spring 2026.
