Analysis:
The FDIC’s Failed Bank List is the authoritative source for whether a bank has “failed.”  From 2001-2025 there were 572 failures, but the distribution is extremely skewed: more than half occurred in 2009-2010 during the Global Financial Crisis.  In the last decade bank failures have been rare, yet clusters can still appear suddenly when interest-rate shocks or deposit runs hit.  In 2023 there were four high-profile failures (Silicon Valley, Signature, First Republic, Heartland Tri-State), three of which happened in March–May.  In 2024 only one small bank (Republic First, PA) failed on 4 / 26 / 2024.  Through 4 February 2026, no new entries appear on the FDIC list, so the running count for the Jan-Apr 2026 window is currently zero.

Key context needed:
• Whether any U.S. banks have already failed in Jan–Feb 2026.  
• How many failures typically occur between Jan-Apr in recent years (base rate).  
• Current macro/market stress indicators (e.g., unrealized bond losses, CRE exposure, funding pressure) that might trigger additional failures before 1 May 2026.  
• News or supervisory actions (FDIC, Fed, OCC) hinting at imminent resolutions or assisted mergers of weak banks.
