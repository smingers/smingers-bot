The ECB kept its deposit facility rate at 2.00%, main refinancing rate at 2.15%, and marginal lending rate at 2.40%. The decision followed a period of euro appreciation since January 2026, driven partly by a weakening dollar. Analysts noted that a stronger euro could suppress export growth and lower import costs, potentially affecting inflation. Some ECB officials, including French central bank governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, acknowledged assessing the euro's impact on policy without setting a formal exchange rate target. However, others, like Roberto Cobos Garcia of BBVA, stated that orderly euro strength would not trigger a dovish policy shift. The ECB emphasized its commitment to stabilizing inflation at 2% in the medium term.\u4e1c\u65b9\u6c47\u7406\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ba1\u7406 (CACEP Wealth Management) suggested the ECB might cut rates to 1.75% later in 2026 if inflation remains below expectations. The BoE also held its benchmark rate at 3.75%, with a 5:4 vote in favor of maintaining rates; four members supported a 25-basis-point cut. Since August 2024, the BoE has cut rates by 150 basis points, with the last reduction in December 2025. The BoE stated that further rate cuts remain possible if wage growth slows and helps control inflation. It emphasized balancing risks to achieve sustained inflation at 2% over the medium term. Anna Anthony, managing partner at EY UK, projected the UK would reach its 2% inflation target by mid-2026, with only one possible rate cut in April 2026. Economic indicators showed improvement: the UK manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in January 2026 from 50.6 in December 2025, the highest since August 2024. CPI rose to 3.4% in December 2025 from 3.2% in November, while services inflation climbed to 4.5%. Retailers reported rising food and non-food prices, with food inflation at 3.9% and fresh food at 4.4%. Consumer confidence and business sentiment also improved. Despite this, analysts noted inflation is still too high to justify aggressive easing, and labor and consumption markets remain weak. Following the BoE\u2019s announcement, the pound fell against the dollar.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 12:02 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202602053643133325.html)\n\n**Inflation and Dollar Projections to 2026, According to Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey**\nThe Central Bank released the latest Market Expectations Survey (REM), based on projections from 45 analysts. The survey forecasts that inflation in January 2026 will exceed 2%, with the average projection for the Consumer Price Index (IPC) at 2.4% and core inflation also at 2.4%. The official IPC will be reported by INDEC on Tuesday, February 10, 2026, using the same methodology as before, without implementing the new method previously announced. For February 2026, inflation is projected at 2.1%, rising slightly to 2.2% in March, followed by a gradual decline: 1.9% in April, 1.7% in May, 1.6% in June, and 1.5% in July. Regarding the exchange rate, the average projection estimates a nominal exchange rate of $1,475 per dollar in February 2026, rising to $1,750 by December 2026, representing an expected annual variation of 20.9%. The open unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2025 is estimated at 6.7%. The GDP for the fourth quarter of 2025 is projected to grow by 0.1% compared to the previous quarter, a decrease of -0.3 percentage points from the previous REM. Projections for the first and second quarters of 2026 anticipate growth of 0.9% and 1.0%, respectively. For 2026, real GDP growth is expected to reach 3.2%, surpassing the 2025 average. The projected annual trade surplus for goods is US$11,175 million.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 10:01 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/economia/a-cuanto-llegaran-el-dolar-y-la-inflacion-a-fin-de-2026-segun-las-consultoras-que-releva-el-banco-central.phtml)\n\n**BoE Dovish Tilt Knocks Sterling; Tech Rout Continues**\nThe Bank of England (BoE) maintained its Bank Rate at 3.75%, but a narrow 5\u20134 vote split revealed internal disagreement, with doves pushing for an immediate 25bp rate cut. Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized that inflation is on track to reach the 2% target by April\u2014about a year earlier than expected in November\u2014fueling market expectations of a March rate cut. Despite the hold, the dovish tone weakened sterling, making it the weakest performer. The broader market backdrop turned risk-off, driven by a tech rout in US equities and a surge in US job cuts: January's Challenger job cuts rose to 108k, the highest since 2009 and the largest since October 2025. This labor market signal has raised concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Risk-off sentiment boosted the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc, while the Euro held modest gains following the ECB\u2019s unchanged 2.00% deposit rate. The ECB maintained a data-dependent stance, with President Christine Lagarde noting balanced risks and stating that recent Euro appreciation is already priced in. Eurozone retail sales fell -0.5% mom in December, with discretionary spending dropping 1.2%, signaling persistent consumer weakness. In the US, initial jobless claims rose to 231k (vs. 210k expected), reinforcing concerns. Financial markets reacted with declines: FTSE down -0.93%, DAX -0.92%, CAC -0.55%, and Nikkei -0.88%. The EUR/GBP pair traded neutrally, with key support at 0.8623 and resistance at 0.8744; a break below 0.8618 could signal a reversal of the corrective rally from 0.8221, while a break above 0.8867 would suggest a reversal of the 2022\u20132024 decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 06:36 PM\nSource:[ActionForex](https://www.actionforex.com/action-insight/market-overview/628351-boe-dovish-tilt-knocks-sterling-tech-rout-continues/)\n\n**Dow Jones Top Markets Headlines at 1 PM ET: Bank of England, ECB Hold Rates, With Future Easing a Wild Card | U.S. ...**\nOn February 5, 2026, major global financial headlines highlighted divergent monetary policy paths, with the Bank of England and European Central Bank (ECB) holding interest rates steady, while future easing remains uncertain due to differing inflation outlooks. U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected, yet the labor market showed no major red flags. Investor anxiety persisted following a two-day tech sector rout, dragging the Nasdaq composite lower\u2014the worst two-day decline since April 2025\u2019s tariff turmoil. The U.S. economy lost nearly 1 million job openings in 2025, with December job openings falling to 6.5 million from 7.5 million in 2024, signaling weakening labor demand. Household spending rebound remains fragile, as December sales fell more than expected. In the U.K., long-term borrowing costs rose and the pound declined amid growing political uncertainty over Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s appointment of former ambassador Peter Mandelson. Silver prices plunged after a brief rebound, reflecting ongoing market volatility following a historic selloff. In Germany, factory orders surged 7.8% month-on-month in December, accelerating from November and indicating a strengthening industrial rebound. The U.S. and China are increasingly moving toward a 'messy divorce' over strategic sectors like semiconductors, food, and energy, now framed as national security issues. Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook emphasized inflation as a greater economic threat than a weakening labor market, suggesting she may oppose early rate cuts. U.S. economic data for January\u2014initial jobless claims, the jobs report, and the consumer price index\u2014will be released on February 11 and 13, respectively, after a brief delay. The U.S. has also formed strategic pacts with Mexico, the EU, and Japan to create a 'preferential trade zone' in critical minerals to counter China\u2019s dominance in the sector.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 06:35 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2026020511000/dow-jones-top-markets-headlines-at-1-pm-et-bank-of-england-ecb-hold-rates-with-future-easing-a-wild-card-us)\n\n**'The Super Bowl of jobs reports': Why does the Jan jobs report matter so much? By Investing.com**\nBank of America has labeled the January 2024 U.S. jobs report, released on February 11, 2024, as 'the Super Bowl of jobs reports' due to its outsized significance for financial markets and Federal Reserve policy. According to Shrut Mishra, U.S. economist at BofA, the labor market remains the key driver of Fed decisions. Job growth has already slowed due to a labor supply shock from tighter immigration policies and softer demand linked to tariff uncertainty and AI adoption. The January report is particularly complex because it includes annual revisions from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) benchmark and updates to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Birth-Death model, which estimates business formation. BofA forecasts a 'below consensus 45k' increase in nonfarm payrolls for January, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4%. Adjusting for expected downward revisions, job growth is likely 'steady at about 75k'. The bank estimates that payrolls as of March 2025 will be revised down by 800k\u2013850k (65k\u201370k/month), slightly less than the preliminary estimate of -911k, with most revisions occurring in the second half of 2024, particularly in leisure & hospitality, trade & transportation, and professional & business services. The updated Birth-Death model may add another 20k\u201330k downward revision to monthly jobs starting in April. For markets and policymakers, the most critical signals will be movement in the January unemployment rate, the scale and timing of revisions, and any outlier payroll figure significantly deviating from the estimated breakeven pace of 20,000 jobs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 02:28 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/the-super-bowl-of-jobs-reports-why-does-the-jan-jobs-report-matter-so-much-4488071)\n\n**Central Banks Shake Up Forex: Dollar Strengthens Amid Geopolitical Tensions and Diverging Rate Outlooks**\nThe strengthening of the U.S. dollar was driven by increased demand for safe-haven assets and the unwinding of hedges by non-residents, fueled by escalating geopolitical risks in the Middle East, rising oil prices, and concerns over a potential global economic slowdown. While gold's extreme volatility has made it less attractive as a safe haven, the dollar remains the primary refuge. The decline in EURUSD is linked to the worst stock market selloff in the U.S. since the April 'Liberation Day' rally, with non-residents holding over one-fifth of U.S. equities. Despite declining confidence in the dollar due to Donald Trump\u2019s policies, foreign investors continue to invest in U.S. markets due to stronger corporate earnings growth and dominant tech giants. To hedge risks, foreign investors sell dollars, which, combined with the S&P 500's drop, triggers long-position closures and increases demand for U.S. dollars (greenback). The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its deposit rate at 2%, unchanged since June, but recent data shows inflation in the eurozone slowed to 1.7% in January (lowest since September 2024) and core inflation to 2.2% (lowest since October 2021), potentially prompting a shift toward rate cuts. If ECB President Christine Lagarde signals a renewed easing cycle, EURUSD selling could accelerate. In contrast, the Bank of England is not concerned about the pound\u2019s strength despite high inflation and economic slowdown in the G7\u2019s highest inflation country; the market expects the key rate to remain at 3.75% in February and assigns a 70% probability of a cut in April, with any dovish signals likely accelerating GBPUSD sell-offs.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 11:48 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/analysis/article-200328768)\n\n**Inflation Expectations Soar as Central Bank Faces Tough Choice on Target Revision**\nFollowing the release of January inflation data, market expectations for year-end inflation have risen sharply, with the Central Bank's original target of 16% by year-end now widely considered unattainable. Prior to January, some economists and foreign analysts had projected inflation could fall below 20%, with expectations around 19% or 22-23%. However, after January's inflation figure, which came in near 5%, expectations have surged to 24%. As a result, the belief that inflation would fall below 20% has vanished. In parallel, interest rate expectations have also risen, with forecasts now pointing to year-end rates exceeding 30%. The Central Bank had previously indicated that inflation below 22% could allow rates to fall below 30%, but with inflation expectations now at 24%, even that scenario is no longer viable. Despite the shift, the Central Bank still maintains its 2026 target of 16%, arguing that with a 3-percentage-point margin of error, the target remains within reach. However, the January data has made a revision likely, and the upcoming inflation report on February 12 may trigger a formal adjustment. The Central Bank\u2019s January decision to cut the policy rate by 1 percentage point\u2014from 38% to 37%\u2014was seen as a cautious move amid high inflation. The March meeting\u2019s decision will depend on February\u2019s inflation data. A continued rise in inflation could jeopardize any rate cuts. There is strong pressure on the Central Bank to cut rates due to financial strain in the real sector, but rising inflation data threatens this path. The Bank\u2019s credibility is now at risk: if it fails to revise its target, it risks losing credibility; if it revises it, it may be seen as conceding defeat in the fight against inflation. Ultimately, the 16% target\u2014already under strain\u2014has been effectively invalidated by January\u2019s data, making a revision unavoidable, likely by the May inflation report. Despite official claims that the economic program remains on track, inflation is now projected to reach 31% by the end of 2025, with the best-case scenario for 2026 being around 25%. Thus, the economic program\u2019s success is increasingly in doubt.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 07:29 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-enflasyon-beklentileri-yukseliyor-19538740/)\n\n**War Against Ukraine a Failure for Putin: Kuleba Outlines Specific Arguments**\nAccording to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Russia's war against Ukraine has been a strategic failure for Vladimir Putin. In 2025, Russia suffered 480,000 military casualties (killed and wounded), yet managed to occupy only an additional 0.7% of Ukrainian territory. By January 2026, the pace of Russian advances had slowed significantly, with less than 0.04% of territory captured that month\u2014the lowest rate in nine months\u2014despite daily losses exceeding 1,000 soldiers. In the Donetska region, Russia captured an additional 21% of territory between January 2024 and January 2026, but this area is smaller than the portion controlled by Ukraine. Concurrently, Russia\u2019s economy shows signs of deterioration: regional budget deficits reached $21 billion in 2025\u2014eight times higher than in 2023. Production declined in 12 key sectors, with 15% more enterprises closing and another 10% near bankruptcy. Due to poor planning and sanctions, Russia could lose at least $25 billion in oil revenues in 2026. Meanwhile, Ukraine conducted 719 attacks on Russian military targets in 2025, causing $15 billion in damage. Kuleba stated, 'The war is returning to where it began\u2014in Russia. The sooner Putin loses illusions about achieving military success, the sooner peace efforts will succeed.' He emphasized that accelerating the war\u2019s end requires intensified sanctions, especially on Russia\u2019s 'shadow fleet' and energy sector, along with increased defense support for Ukraine.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:56 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/viyna-proti-ukrayini-proval-putina-sibiga-1770212258.html)\n\n**A Month Of Shock And Awe: These Were The Best And Worst Performing Assets In January**\nJanuary 2026 delivered a volatile yet broadly positive performance across global financial markets, marked by geopolitical shocks, sharp asset swings, and strong risk-on momentum. The S&P 500 briefly surpassed 7,000, ending the month +1.4% higher, driven by upbeat global economic data\u2014including a 14-month high in the US ISM services index (54.4), a decline in the US unemployment rate to 4.4%, and stronger-than-expected Euro Area growth (+0.3% in Q4). Geopolitical tensions significantly influenced markets: Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was captured by US forces on January 3, raising concerns over oil supply, though the broader market impact was limited. More consequential were escalating tensions with Iran, where Trump\u2019s warning of a 'massive Armada' heading to Iran on January 28 triggered a surge in Brent crude oil, which rose +16.2%\u2014its largest monthly gain since January 2022\u2014finishing at $70.69/bbl. Simultaneously, speculation over a US strike led to a temporary spike in oil prices, despite Trump later downplaying tensions. The Greenland issue intensified on January 14 and 17, with Trump asserting US national security interests and threatening tariffs on Europe unless Greenland was purchased, prompting a risk-off move that sent the S&P 500 down -2.1% on January 18. However, after Trump announced a framework for a Greenland deal on January 21 and canceled the tariffs, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 hitting another all-time high on January 27. Precious metals saw extraordinary volatility: gold posted its best monthly performance since September 1999 (+13.3%), reaching an intraday record of $5,595/oz on January 29 before plunging -8.95% on January 30\u2014the largest single-day drop since April 2013. Silver suffered an even sharper intraday fall of 36%, its worst since 1980. The US dollar weakened significantly, with the dollar index down -1.4% in January\u2014the biggest 4-day decline since Liberation Day turmoil in April 2025\u2014though Treasury Secretary Bessent reaffirmed the 'strong dollar policy' on January 29, helping stabilize the currency. The Federal Reserve faced scrutiny after the DOJ launched a criminal investigation into central bank independence, adding to safe-haven demand for gold. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s market saw major moves ahead of a snap election on February 8: JGBs sold off amid expectations of consumption tax cuts, pushing long-end yields to record highs\u201430-year yield at 3.86% (highest since launch), 10-year at 2.35% (highest since 1999)\u2014before closing at 3.63% and 2.24% respectively. The Bank of Japan maintained rates but raised its inflation outlook and signaled a hawkish bias. Despite the turbulence, all major global assets posted gains in USD terms, a rare occurrence noted by Deutsche Bank\u2019s Henry Allen. The month ended with heightened volatility, signaling that February is unlikely to be quiet.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:20 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/month-shock-and-awe-these-were-best-and-worst-performing-assets-january)\n\n**Russian Banks Fail to Break Profit Record in 2025 Amid Rising Credit Risks and Slower Lending Growth**\nRussian banks reported a net profit of \u20bd3.5 trillion in 2025, a 7.9% decrease from the 2023\u20132024 record of \u20bd3.8 trillion, according to the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). This result marks the weakest performance since 2023 but remained within the regulator's and market's expectations. The CBR attributed the decline to increased credit risk costs (CoR), higher provisions for loan losses, and slower growth in key lending segments. The sector's return on equity (ROE) fell to 18% from 23% in 2024. Corporate lending grew by 11.8% (to \u20bd102.8 trillion), below the 2024 growth rate of 18.1%, though within the CBR\u2019s projected range of 10\u201313%.

Unsecured lending contracted by 4.6% after a 11.3% rise in 2024, due to macroprudential constraints and high interest rates. Auto lending growth slowed to 17.5% from 51.7% in 2024. Bank funding remained stable: household deposits rose 16.2% (to \u20bd67 trillion), below the 2024 record of 27.7%, while corporate deposits grew 7.7%, partly due to reduced export revenues. The CBR noted deteriorating credit quality: corporate non-performing loans rose 0.9 percentage points over 11 months, unsecured loans with delinquency increased by 3.9 percentage points to 13% by January 1, 2026, and mortgage non-performing loans rose 0.7 percentage points to 1.7%, primarily from loans issued during the 'Subsidized Mortgage' period. Despite this, the CBR assessed risks as manageable, with high coverage of problem loans (91% for unsecured, 72% for mortgages including collateral). The CBR extended relief on reserve requirements for restructured loans to support borrowers.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:16 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/finances/03/02/2026/698123a49a79474fc6a9000c)\n\n**Dollar Distrust Unleashed Apocalypse on Precious Metals Market**\nThe week of January 29\u201330, 2026, witnessed an unprecedented market collapse in precious metals, with gold and silver experiencing their worst single-day declines since the 1980s. Gold dropped 9% on the spot market and 11.4% on the COMEX April futures contract\u2014the worst day since 1983, surpassed only by two 1980 crashes. Silver plummeted 26.3%, the second-worst day in history, trailing only March 27, 1980. This crash followed a 'parabolic' rally: gold rose from $3,300\u2013$3,400 in August 2025 to a peak of $5,595 on January 29, then closed at $4,849. Silver surged from under $40 in summer 2025 to a record $121 on January 29, then closed at $83. Platinum and palladium followed similar patterns. The rally was driven by declining trust in the U.S. dollar and speculative trading, with leverage amplifying price swings. The crash was primarily triggered by forced liquidation of highly leveraged long and short positions. A speculative theory suggests coordinated actions by major U.S. banks (market makers on COMEX), which traditionally hold short positions in gold and silver. Data from the Bank Participation Report shows a shift: from net short positions (32.5K contracts short, 6.5K long) on August 8 to near-neutral (15K short, 16K long) by January 6, 2026. This shift suggests banks exited their short positions during the rally but may have re-established them before the crash, potentially accelerating the collapse. The article attributes the crash to speculative frenzy and possible market manipulation, noting the event\u2019s historical significance.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:58 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/business/55988521-nedoverie-k-dollaru-vylilos-v-apokalipsis-na-rynke-zolota/)\n\n**First US Bank Failure Of 2026 Hits, But Another One Looks Unlikely, Polymarket Says**\nMetropolitan Capital Bank & Trust became the first U.S. bank to fail in 2026 after Illinois regulators closed it on January 30, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) appointed as receiver. The FDIC facilitated a clean transfer of all deposits to First Independence Bank, containing the resolution. The failure stemmed from a prolonged $4.5 million loan tied to a troubled skilled-nursing facility, which underwent multiple modifications and ended in a protracted court battle. The bank alleged it was misled by the borrower, pointing to underwriting and due diligence failures. The FDIC estimated the cleanup cost at $19.7 million, a significant amount for a bank with $261.1 million in assets and $212.1 million in deposits as of September 30, 2025. This marks the second bank failure in Chicago within two years, but market reactions suggest the event is seen as isolated\u2014specifically a small-bank credit issue rather than the beginning of a regional banking contagion. On Polymarket, traders assign an 18% probability to another U.S. bank failure by March 31, 2026, indicating a meaningful tail risk. Financial markets remain stable: the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rose ~2% to $70.16, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) gained ~1.7% to $64.64, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) increased ~0.8% to $53.85.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:35 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/prediction-markets/26/02/50314747/first-us-bank-failure-of-2026-hits-but-another-one-looks-unlikely-polymarket-says)\n\n**Chicago's Metropolitan Capital Bank becomes first U.S. bank failure of 2026**\nMetropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, a Chicago-based Universal Bank focused on small- and medium-sized businesses, became the first U.S. bank failure of 2026 after being closed on Friday by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) due to 'unsafe and unsound conditions and an impaired capital position.' The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as receiver and entered a purchase agreement with First Independence Bank, a Detroit-based state-chartered commercial bank founded in 1970 and the only African American-owned bank headquartered in Michigan. First Independence Bank reopened the failed institution under a new banner on Monday, assuming 'substantially all deposits' and $251 million in assets. The FDIC confirmed that no depositor will lose money, and estimated the failure will cost its Deposit Insurance Fund $19.7 million, though the actual cost may vary as retained assets are sold. Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust had $261 million in assets and $212 million in total deposits. This marks the second consecutive year Chicago has had the first bank failure in the U.S., following Pulaski Savings Bank\u2019s closure in January 2025. Prior to 2025, Chicago had not experienced a bank failure in nearly a decade. The article also references past Chicago bank failures, including Seaway Bank and Trust (2017) and Washington Federal Bank for Savings (2017), the latter involving a $31 million embezzlement scheme, criminal charges against 16 individuals\u2014including former Chicago Ald.

Bitcoin dropped below $80,000 for the first time since April 2025, marking a further decline after a series of macro-driven sell-offs, though it later recovered to above $78,000. Silver plunged approximately 30% on Friday\u2014the worst single-day drop since 1980\u2014while gold fell nearly 9%, with both metals still down over 3% on Monday, reinforcing a risk-off market mood. The synchronized selloff across equities, crypto, and metals reflected investor caution after months of strong gains in alternative assets. The partial federal government shutdown, triggered by Congress's failure to pass a funding bill before the deadline, added to market uncertainty. The Senate passed a spending package, but it required House approval, which was delayed until Monday; House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated the shutdown could be resolved by Tuesday. Investors are also preparing for a pivotal week of economic data, including the January US jobs report expected Friday, with economists forecasting a 55,000 increase in payrolls. Meanwhile, more than 100 S&P 500 companies are set to report earnings, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, with mixed market reactions despite strong results so far. Deutsche Bank strategists noted that overall earnings growth remains on track to be the strongest in four years, providing a supportive backdrop if companies meet high expectations.

Regulators cited weak capital and unsafe operating conditions as reasons for the shutdown, acting proactively to prevent further losses. The FDIC stepped in, transferring deposits to First Independence Bank, ensuring insured deposits remained fully protected and customers retained access to funds. Authorities managed assets behind the scenes, limiting contagion risks. Although the failure broke a streak of no bank collapses in 2025 and revived memories of the 2023 banking crisis, markets reacted cautiously but without panic: equities showed limited movement, bond markets remained stable, and banking indexes avoided sharp declines. Social media, particularly crypto influencers, amplified fears, linking the event to past crises and promoting decentralization narratives, though Bitcoin prices stayed range-bound. Regulators emphasized strong oversight, improved capital monitoring, and aggressive stress testing, signaling readiness for intervention. Officials maintained that the failure was isolated and contained, with no systemic crisis emerging. Confidence remained intact due to effective regulatory response, though vigilance is expected to increase throughout 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Coinfomania](https://coinfomania.com/first-us-bank-failure-2026-metropolitan-capital/)\n\n**Failure to Deliver Gold & Silver Calamity Coming**\nFinancial analyst Bill Holter, known as 'Mr. Gold,' predicts a systemic failure in the delivery of physical gold and silver on paper exchanges, warning that the current surge in demand is exposing structural weaknesses in the COMEX system. He notes that over 40 million ounces of silver were already standing for delivery in January 2026\u2014a non-delivery month\u2014far exceeding historical norms. Holter anticipates that by the start of March 2026, delivery commitments could reach 70\u201380 million ounces, potentially exhausting COMEX\u2019s inventory. He asserts that if a failure to deliver occurs, COMEX contracts lose all value, as a contract that cannot perform is worth zero. Holter warns that a failure in silver will immediately impact gold, which in turn will destabilize credit markets, as gold functions as the 'anti-dollar' and 'anti-US Treasury.' He attributes the crisis to rising metal prices, particularly in silver, and claims that major banks and dealers shorting metals are financially strained. Holter argues that the U.S. government\u2019s $38 trillion debt, if backed by 8,000 tons of U.S. gold, would require gold prices to reach approximately $200,000 per ounce. He concludes that a failure to deliver in March 2026 will trigger a collapse of the financial system, rendering credit unattainable and leading to a complete shutdown of the real economy\u2014what he describes as a 'Mad Max' scenario. These claims are based on a 39-minute interview published on January 27, 2026, by The Burning Platform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:29 PM\nSource:[The Burning Platform](https://www.theburningplatform.com/2026/01/27/failure-to-deliver-gold-silver-calamity-coming/)\n\n**Are The GDP Numbers (A)rtificially (I)nflated**\nThe U.S. economy in January 2026 exhibits a 'synthetic expansion' characterized by headline GDP growth of 2.1% to 2.3%, which is largely driven by a narrow concentration of high-technology capital expenditure ($602 billion infrastructure cycle) and a temporary fiscal boost from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which delivered a $150 billion windfall in tax refunds. Forensic analysis reveals that the 5.1% GDPNow estimate for Q4 2025 is a mechanical 'catch-up' effect from the 43-day federal government shutdown in late 2025, not genuine growth. The apparent improvement in the trade deficit was due to a 24.5% collapse in imports from tariffs and a surge in non-monetary gold exports, not domestic manufacturing strength. The 'tariff front-running' strategy in 2025 inflated imports, but by January 2026, this inventory overhang has peaked, signaling an impending 'CapEx cliff' if AI productivity gains fail to materialize. The unemployment rate of 4.4% is misleading, as it reflects labor force contraction and a correction of shutdown-related reporting errors, not job growth. A 'low-hire, low-fire' labor market stasis masks a 'white-collar recession' with entry-level unemployment for recent college graduates at 5.8% and tech-adjacent fields at 10%, driven by generative AI automating foundational tasks. Real-time inflation data from Truflation shows a drop to 2.11%, contrasting with the BLS-reported 2.7%\u20133.1% range, due to a 'carry-forward' imputation bias from the shutdown. The Federal Reserve's reliance on lagged data risks an unnecessarily restrictive policy stance. The economy's stability hinges on bridging the 'monetization gap' in AI productivity, with the true inflection point expected in 2027\u20132028. The eSLR Final Rule, effective April 1, 2026, reduces Tier 1 capital requirements for major bank subsidiaries by $219 billion, aiming to support Treasury market intermediation amid high federal debt. The primary risk is a 'CapEx cliff' or 'stagnation ripple' if structural weaknesses persist, threatening a technical recession in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 01:03 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@ndelucabiz/are-the-gdp-numbers-a-rtificially-i-nflated-c52f56d1b75d)\n\n**February Will Be Catastrophic!

Nearly 400 of these occurred between 2009 and 2011. No bank failures were reported in 2018 or during 2021\u20132022, but 2023 saw the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history: Silicon Valley Bank (March 10, 2023) and First Republic Bank (May 1, 2023), both acquired by larger institutions\u2014First Citizens Bank & Trust Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., respectively. In 2024, Republic Bank (April 26, 2024) was acquired by Fulton Bank, National Association, and The First National Bank of Lindsay (October 18, 2024) by First Bank & Trust Co. In 2025, the Santa Anna National Bank (June 27, 2025) was acquired by Coleman County State Bank, and Pulaski Savings Bank (January 17, 2025) by Millennium Bank. Other failures in recent years include Citizens Bank (November 3, 2023), Heartland Tri-State Bank (July 28, 2023), and several smaller banks in 2020 and 2019. When a bank fails, the FDIC protects depositors by insuring up to $250,000 per account holder, per institution, per ownership category. If a bank is not FDIC-insured, depositors become unsecured creditors and may lose funds. The FDIC steps in by either transferring assets to a new insured bank or issuing insured payments directly to depositors. The FDIC's BankFind tool allows consumers to verify a bank\u2019s insurance status. According to the article, there is no way to prevent a bank failure, but choosing an FDIC-insured bank with strong financials can protect funds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 10:01 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!
