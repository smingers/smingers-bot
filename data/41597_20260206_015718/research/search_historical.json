The FDIC stepped in as receiver and brokered a handoff to **First Independence Bank**, which assumed all deposits.\n\n3. **Bank size and cost:**\n   - Metropolitan had $261.1 million in assets and $212.1 million in deposits as of September 30, 2025\n   - FDIC estimated the cleanup will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund **$19.7 million**\n\n4. **Cause of failure:** Court records and commercial real estate reporting show Metropolitan spent years working through a $4.5 million loan tied to a troubled skilled-nursing facility. The bank alleged it was misled by the borrower's representations, indicating underwriting and due diligence issues.\n\n5. **Historical context:** There were only **two nationwide bank failures in 2025**, both small, local institutions. This is Chicago's second bank failure in as many years.\n\n**Market Opinions:**\n\n1. **Polymarket traders** (prediction market data): Pricing in an **18% probability** of another U.S. bank failure by March 31, 2026.\n\n2. **Market reaction:** The banking sector showed positive performance following the announcement:\n   - SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE): up ~2%\n   - SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE): up ~1.7%\n   - Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF): up ~0.8%\n\n3. The market is treating this as an idiosyncratic, small-bank credit story rather than the start of regional-bank contagion.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ts2.tech/en/first-u-s-bank-failure-of-2026-what-happened-after-metropolitan-capital-bank-trust-was-shut/\">\n# Summary of Article: First U.S. Bank Failure of 2026\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n- **Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust** was closed by U.S. regulators on Friday, January 31, 2026, marking the **first U.S. bank failure of 2026**\n- The bank had **$261.1 million in assets** and **$212.1 million in deposits** as of September 30, 2025\n- **First Independence Bank** acquired most of the failed bank's assets and deposits through a purchase-and-assumption deal\n- The FDIC estimates the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund at approximately **$19.7 million** (preliminary figure subject to change)\n- First Independence will assume nearly all deposits and take on around **$251 million in assets**\n- The failed bank's sole branch was scheduled to reopen as a First Independence location on Monday, February 2, 2026\n\n**Context on Recent Bank Failures:**\n\n- This follows **two smaller bank failures in 2025**\n- The two 2025 failures mentioned by name were:\n  - **Pulaski Savings Bank** (January 2025) - cost the insurance fund $28.5 million (about 58% of its assets)\n  - **The Santa Anna National Bank** in Texas\n- Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust is larger than the banks that failed in 2025\n\n**Financial Details:**\n\n- Q3 2025 data showed the bank had approximately $261 million in assets against $257 million in liabilities\n- Net equity capital ratio: **1.62%**\n- The bank had **$43 million borrowed** from the Federal Home Loan Bank system\n\n**Customer Impact:**\n\n- No depositor lost funds after the closure\n- Nearly all deposits were transferred regardless of amount\n- Depositors have immediate access to funds, with checks, ATMs, and debit cards remaining operational\n- Interest accrued through January 30 will be paid at existing rates\n- First Independence may change deposit rates and will notify customers; customers can withdraw funds without penalty until agreeing to new deposit contract\n\n**Source Attribution:**\nInformation attributed to FDIC, American Banker, and Coinfomania throughout the article.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide FDIC failed bank entries from 1 Jan 2026 to 5 Feb 2026 and counts of U.S. bank failures occurring Jan-Apr each year 2010-2025; summarize any regulatory or market signals pointing to potential near-term failures\n1. FDIC-reported failures from 1 Jan 2026 \u2013 5 Feb 2026  \nOnly one U.S.-insured depository institution has failed in the period:  \n\u2022 Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Chicago IL \u2013 closed 30 Jan 2026, $261.1 million in assets, $212.1 million in deposits; deposits and almost all assets assumed by First Independence Bank, Detroit MI; estimated cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) $19.7 million (FDIC \u201c2026 Bank Failures\u201d page, dated 30 Jan 2026; American Banker, 31 Jan 2026; Chicago Sun-Times, 31 Jan 2026).\n\nNo other FDIC failures are listed through the FDIC \u201cin brief\u201d log or the master Failed Bank List as of 5 Feb 2026.\n\n2. Number of U.S. bank failures that occurred between 1 January and 30 April, 2010-2025  \nCounts are derived by tallying closing dates in the public FDIC Failed Bank List for each year and cross-checking with the year-by-year tables published by Bankrate (which reproduce FDIC data) [Bankrate, 20 Dec 2025] and individual FDIC yearly pages. While day-to-day totals fluctuate slightly as receiverships are finalised, the FDIC numbers are considered definitive for regulatory purposes.\n\nYear \u2013 Jan-Apr failures  \n2010    64  \n2011    39  \n2012    22  \n2013    10  \n2014    9  \n2015    4  \n2016    2 (North Milwaukee State Bank, 11 Mar; Trust Company Bank, 29 Apr)  \n2017    3 (Harvest Community 13 Jan; Seaway Bank 27 Jan; First NBC Bank 28 Apr)  \n2018    0  \n2019    0 (first 2019 failure was 31 May)  \n2020    2 (Ericson State Bank 14 Feb; The First State Bank 3 Apr)  \n2021    0  \n2022    0  \n2023    2 (Silicon Valley Bank 10 Mar; Signature Bank 12 Mar)  \n2024    1 (Republic First Bank 26 Apr)  \n2025    1 (Pulaski Savings Bank 17 Jan)\n\nThese figures show three clear phases:  \n\u2022 Post-crisis clean-up (2010-2012) with very high early-year tallies;  \n\u2022 Steady decline 2013-2017 as credit quality improved;  \n\u2022 Near-dormant period 2018-2022, punctured by the \u00admid-2023 trio of high-profile failures; low single-digit counts resumed in 2024-2025.\n\n3. Regulatory and market signals of possible near-term stress\n\na. Persistent unrealised securities losses and CRE exposure  \nThe FDIC\u2019s latest quarterly commentary (Q3-2025) cited roughly $337 billion of unrealised losses on banks\u2019 securities portfolios system-wide, a legacy of the 2022-2023 rate shock (CryptoRank summary, 1 Feb 2026, citing the FDIC data). Those paper losses reduce flexibility for smaller and mid-size institutions if liquidity drains again. Commercial real-estate refinancing risk remains elevated, with about US$3 trillion of CRE loans still on bank balance-sheets (CryptoRank; Deloitte 2026 Banking Outlook).\n\nb. Funding-cost squeeze and weaker earnings at regionals  \nFourth-quarter 2025 results from several regional banks showed margin compression and, in some cases, deposit runoff (Investopedia market briefing, 16 Jan 2026). While large universal banks reported solid trading income, mid-tier lenders emphasised cost-cutting and stock-buy-backs rather than growth, suggesting caution ahead of expected Fed easing later in 2026.\n\nc. Regulators preparing for quicker resolutions  \nThe FDIC in January 2026 published public \u201cdeal templates\u201d and expanded guidance for potential bidders in advance of failures (CUToday article, undated 2026). The agency says the materials are intended to accelerate whole-bank purchase-and-assumption (P&A) transactions, reflecting lessons from the protracted 2023 Silicon Valley Bank process. Earlier preparation indicates supervisors still see a non-zero probability of additional failures and want to minimise disruption.\n\nd. Supervisory focus shifting to technology-driven risks  \nU.K. MPs\u2019 calls for AI-specific stress testing (Guardian, 20 Jan 2026; Banking Exchange, 21 Jan 2026) echo concerns U.S. regulators have aired informally: concentration of critical cloud/AI service providers and model herding could amplify shocks. While the remarks come from the U.K., global regulatory coordination means similar themes are likely to appear in upcoming U.S. supervisory guidance.\n\ne. Market-price \u201ccanaries\u201d  \nThe coincidence of Metropolitan Capital\u2019s closure with a sharp unwinding in gold, silver and bitcoin prices (CryptoRank, 1 Feb 2026) highlights how even a small failure can exacerbate fragile sentiment when markets are already de-risking. Although one data point does not make a trend, it reinforces that liquidity conditions remain tight; further adverse asset-price moves could feed back into banks\u2019 balance-sheets.\n\nf. Macro backdrop for 2026  \nDeloitte\u2019s 2026 outlook foresees slower GDP growth (\u22481.4 %), a steeper but still-inverted yield curve and only modest expansion in net-interest income, with deposit competition still intense. The report flags elevated household leverage and possible upticks in credit-card and student-loan delinquencies. Together, those indicators imply that thinly capitalised or poorly diversified lenders could face renewed pressure if rate cuts arrive more slowly than markets expect.\n\n4. Information gaps and recommended follow-up\n\n\u2022 Exact Jan-Apr failure tallies for 2010-2012 were reconstructed from contemporaneous FDIC lists but should be confirmed by running a filter on the FDIC failed-bank CSV (OpenSanctions hosts an updated copy).  \n\u2022 Granular data on unrealised securities losses by bank-size group, and on wholesale-funding reliance, would allow a more targeted watch-list; these are available in the FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile and the Federal Reserve H.8 series.  \n\u2022 No public enforcement actions against Metropolitan Capital Bank officers have yet been posted; monitor the FDIC Enforcement Decisions & Orders page for developments.  \n\u2022 With only one 2026 failure so far, trend analysis is premature; monitoring weekly changes in the Fed\u2019s \u201cDeposits, small domestically chartered banks\u201d series and secondary-market spreads on regional-bank bonds would provide forward indicators.\n\nIf higher precision or additional context is required, the following searches would help:  \n\u2022 \u201cFDIC failed banks CSV download\u201d to pull the raw file and automate date-range counts.  \n\u2022 \u201cFDIC Quarterly Banking Profile Q3 2025 unrealized losses\u201d for the latest hard numbers.  \n\u2022 \u201cFederal Reserve H.8 deposit data February 2026\u201d for current deposit-outflow trends.  \n\u2022 \u201cCommercial real estate bank exam guidance 2026\u201d to capture any new supervisory releases.  \n\u2022 \u201cFDIC enforcement order Metropolitan Capital Bank\u201d to track post-failure investigations.\n\nOverall, while U.S. bank-failure activity remains low compared with the post-GFC era, the combination of still-large mark-to-market losses, CRE repricing, and tight funding costs keeps smaller institutions vulnerable. Regulators\u2019 push for faster resolutions and ongoing public-template releases suggest they are preparing for additional\u2014though likely sporadic\u2014failures in 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
