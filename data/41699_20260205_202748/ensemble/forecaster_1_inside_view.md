## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Official January 2026 data confirmed**: 56.4 final (up from 52.9 in December)
   - Multiple independent sources confirm
   - Direct measurement of the variable in question
   - Shows two consecutive monthly increases (+1.9 Nov→Dec, +3.5 Dec→Jan)

2. **Professional forecast for February**: Morningstar consensus expects 54.3 preliminary (published January 30)
   - Single reliable source with clear timing
   - Suggests decline from January's 56.4
   - If accurate, February final likely around 54-56 range

3. **Structural economic headwinds identified by Fed official**: Fed Governor Cook (February 5) notes K-shaped economy, inflation above target, low-income strain
   - Named expert with institutional authority
   - Identifies persistent negative factors affecting sentiment
   - Directly relevant to consumer confidence drivers

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Conference Board divergence**: Shows dramatic decline while Michigan improved
   - Different methodology (labor market vs. household finances focus)
   - Suggests fragility in sentiment improvement
   - Conference Board at 12-year low creates negative backdrop

2. **Mixed consumer behavior signals**: Morgan Stanley survey shows sentiment improving but spending intentions weakening
   - Clear methodology, recent data (Jan 22-26)
   - Suggests sentiment improvement may not translate to sustained confidence
   - 6-month outlook deteriorating

3. **Major spending category weakness**: Car sales at 3-year low in January
   - Hard data, not survey-based
   - Shows actual consumer behavior lagging sentiment
   - Weather-affected but underlying concerns persist

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Historical 2025 pattern**: February→March 2025 showed -11.9% decline
   - Single data point, different economic context
   - 2025 showed persistent downward trend throughout Q1
   - May not be predictive of 2026 given recent momentum shift

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Today: February 5, 2026
- February final release: ~February 20, 2026 (15 days)
- March preliminary release: ~March 10, 2026 (33 days)
- Total horizon: ~5 weeks

**If timeframe halved (2.5 weeks):** Would only cover February preliminary release. Confidence would increase slightly as less time for unexpected shocks, but February data already has consensus forecast suggesting decline to 54.3.

**If timeframe doubled (10 weeks):** Would extend into April preliminary. Confidence would decrease significantly as more time allows for policy changes, economic shocks, or trend reversals. Seasonal effects (spring) might become relevant.

**Critical timing consideration**: The question compares March preliminary (early March survey) vs. February final (late February survey). This represents roughly 2-3 weeks of economic developments between survey periods.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting March > February (bullish case):**

1. **Recent momentum**: Two consecutive monthly increases totaling +5.4 points suggests potential trend reversal
   - However, this momentum may already be captured in February's expected reading

2. **Base effect**: Starting from historically low levels (mid-50s) provides room for recovery
   - Counterpoint: Has been at low levels for months without sustained recovery

3. **Inflation expectations declining**: January showed one-year inflation expectations at 4.0% (lowest in a year)
   - Moderate positive factor if trend continues

**Factors Supporting March ≤ February (bearish case):**

1. **Professional forecast suggests February decline**: Morningstar consensus at 54.3 preliminary (vs. 56.4 January final)
   - Strong evidence: If February final settles around 54-56, March needs to exceed that
   - This forecast was made before January final was known (published Jan 30), suggesting professional forecasters expected weakness

2. **Structural headwinds remain**: Fed official identifies persistent challenges
   - K-shaped economy with low-income strain
   - Inflation still above target (2.9% vs. 2.0%)
   - Labor market concerns
   - These factors unlikely to resolve in 5 weeks

3. **Actual consumer behavior lagging sentiment**: Car sales at 3-year low, spending intentions weakening
   - Suggests sentiment improvement is fragile and may not sustain
   - Hard data contradicting survey improvement

4. **Conference Board collapse**: Dramatic decline to 12-year low provides negative backdrop
   - While different methodology, creates overall pessimistic environment
   - Suggests labor market concerns (Conference Board's focus) are severe

5. **Historical Q1 vulnerability**: 2025 showed February-to-March as weakest Q1 transition
   - While weak evidence alone, combines with other bearish factors
   - Q1 often shows seasonal weakness in sentiment

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view of 43%, I need to adjust based on new information:

**Downward adjustments:**
- Morningstar forecast (54.3 for Feb preliminary) strongly suggests February final will be below January's 56.4: -8%
- Structural headwinds identified by Fed official unlikely to resolve quickly: -5%
- Hard data (car sales, spending intentions) contradicting sentiment improvement: -4%
- Conference Board collapse suggests fragility: -3%

**Upward adjustments:**
- Recent two-month momentum is real and confirmed: +5%
- Inflation expectations declining could support continued improvement: +3%

Net adjustment: -12% from outside view of 43% = 31%

**Scenario analysis:**
- Optimistic scenario (25% probability): February final comes in at 56.0+, March preliminary rises to 57-58 on continued momentum
- Base scenario (50% probability): February final drops to 54-55 range per forecast, March preliminary stays flat or declines slightly to 53-55
- Pessimistic scenario (25% probability): February final drops sharply to 52-53, March continues decline to 50-52

For March > February to occur, need optimistic scenario or base scenario with upward surprise. This suggests probability around 30-35%.

Probability calibration:

My outside view of 43% was based on limited information about professional forecasts. The Morningstar forecast of 54.3 for February preliminary (published before January final was known) is particularly significant - it suggests professional forecasters expected weakness even before seeing January's 56.4. This is strong evidence that February final will likely be in the 54-56 range.

For March preliminary to exceed February final, we would need either:
1. February final to come in very low (52-53) AND March to recover (unlikely given structural headwinds)
2. February final to hold at 55-56 AND March to continue upward momentum (possible but fighting against professional forecasts and hard data)

The combination of professional forecasts suggesting February weakness, structural economic headwinds, and hard data showing consumer behavior lagging sentiment creates a compelling bearish case. The recent momentum is real but appears fragile.

Adjusting to 32% probability accounts for:
- The real possibility that recent momentum continues (optimistic scenario)
- The professional forecast suggesting February decline
- Structural factors that are unlikely to improve in 5 weeks
- Historical pattern of Q1 weakness

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will March 2026 preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index exceed February 2026 final value? Resolution by March 10, 2026.

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view of 43% based on recent momentum vs. historical Q1 weakness. Inside view of 32% reflects professional forecasts suggesting February decline and structural headwinds.

3. **Consistency**: "32 out of 100 times, March preliminary exceeds February final." This aligns with a scenario where February likely declines per forecasts, and March faces headwinds to recovery.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Morningstar forecast: February preliminary at 54.3 (vs. 56.4 January final)
   - Fed Governor Cook: Structural headwinds persist (K-shaped economy, inflation above target)
   - Hard data: Car sales at 3-year low, spending intentions weakening despite sentiment improvement
   - Conference Board: Collapsed to 12-year low, suggesting fragility
   - Recent momentum: Two consecutive monthly increases (+5.4 points total)

5. **Blind spot**: If January's improvement represents a genuine turning point driven by factors I'm underweighting (e.g., political optimism, actual improvement in household finances), and February maintains strength around 56-57, then March could continue upward to 57-58. This would make my 32% look too pessimistic. However, professional forecasters with more resources also expect February weakness, which validates my caution.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory shows fragile recovery from very low levels. Status quo suggests continued volatility in the 52-56 range rather than sustained improvement. Given 5-week timeframe, major shifts unlikely. Slight nudge toward status quo (sideways movement) already incorporated in my 32% probability.

Probability: 32%
