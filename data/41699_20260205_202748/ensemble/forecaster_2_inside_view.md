Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **University of Michigan SCA (Jan 2026 final)**: Official source. January 2026 final = 56.4 (up from Dec 52.9, prelim 54.0). Joanne Hsu notes broad-based improvement but concerns about purchasing power and labor markets persist. **High credibility - primary source.**

2. **Morningstar (Jan 30, 2026)**: Market preview forecasting Feb 2026 preliminary at 54.3, citing 56.4 as December baseline (appears to confuse December vs January). **Moderate credibility - consensus forecast but contains dating confusion.**

3. **Together Planning (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reviews January improvement (+6.6% m/m) but notes 21.3% decline y/y. Highlights divergence between UMich (household finance focus) and Conference Board (labor market focus). Conference Board fell to 82.2 in January, lowest since May 2014. **Moderate credibility - secondary analysis.**

**Current News (Feb 2-5, 2026):**
4. **Fed Governor Lisa Cook (Feb 5, 2026)**: States inflation "still too hot" at 2.9% PCE, describes "K-shaped economy" with low-income households facing rising delinquencies and stagnant consumption. Black/youth unemployment rising since spring 2025. **Strong credibility - identifiable Fed official.**

5. **Morgan Stanley Survey (Jan 22-26, 2026)**: Consumer sentiment toward economy improved (+7 pts to -6%), household finances (+10 pts to +22%), but electronics/PC spending intentions weakened significantly. Low-income households at -21%, high-income at -12%. **Moderate credibility - identifiable methodology, specific timeframe.**

6. **Auto sales data (Jan 2026)**: Sales fell to 14.9M annualized rate (lowest in 3 years), down 7% from December's 16.1M. Weather and structural issues (expired EV credits, high prices, insurance costs) cited. **Strong evidence - hard data with clear mechanism.**

7. **Benzinga/Yahoo (Jan 23, 2026)**: Reports January UMich at 56.4, highlighting food deflation (eggs -26%, chicken -21-48%, sugar -16.6%). Notes sentiment remains 20%+ below year-ago. **Moderate credibility - corroborates official data with causal mechanism.**

**German Consumer Data (Jan 28, 2026):**
8. **GfK Germany**: February index rose to -24.1 (+2.8 pts), driven by minimum wage increase and falling inflation (1.8% in Dec 2025). Purchase intentions at highest since March 2022. **Weak relevance - different economy, but shows global pattern of modest improvement.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **January 2026 actual = 56.4**: Confirmed final reading establishes baseline. February final (resolution comparison point) unknown but typically ~2 points different from preliminary.
- **Auto sales collapse (Jan 2026)**: Hard data showing consumer spending weakness in major category. Directly impacts consumer confidence through wealth effect and employment concerns.
- **Fed official warning (Feb 5)**: Lisa Cook's "K-shaped economy" statement with specific data on low-income stress is recent (within resolution window) and from authoritative source.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Conference Board at 12-year low (Jan 2026)**: Different index but correlated with UMich; suggests underlying weakness. However, methodology differences (labor vs household focus) limit direct inference.
- **Morgan Stanley survey (late Jan)**: Shows sentiment improvement but spending intentions weakening—mixed signal. Sample methodology unclear but timing is relevant.
- **Food deflation trend**: Eggs down 26%, proteins falling sharply. Positive for purchasing power but effect on sentiment may lag actual price changes by weeks.
- **Consensus forecast ~54.3 for Feb preliminary**: If accurate, and Feb final ~56, March preliminary would need to exceed 56 to resolve Yes. Historical volatility makes this plausible but not favored.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **German consumer data**: Different economy, though shows modest improvement pattern globally. Limited applicability.
- **Tariff uncertainty mentions**: Noted in January but interviews concluded Jan 19, before additional tariff announcements. Current impact unclear.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 29 days (Feb 5 → March 6 preliminary release).

**February final baseline estimate**: If Morningstar's 54.3 preliminary forecast is accurate and historical preliminary-to-final adjustment (~+2 points) holds, February final ≈ 56-57 range. This would be roughly flat to slightly up from January's 56.4.

**March preliminary target**: Must exceed February final. If Feb final = 56, March prelim needs >56. If Feb final = 57, March prelim needs >57.

**Timeframe sensitivity**:
- **Halved (15 days)**: Would increase uncertainty—less time for economic data to shift sentiment, more weight on noise. Might nudge toward 50% (pure coin flip).
- **Doubled (60 days)**: Would allow more macro trends (labor market, inflation data, Fed policy) to materialize. Given current mixed signals, might slightly favor downside given Fed hawkishness and auto sales weakness.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 48%** (March > February historically in 48.9% of years since 1980)

**Factors suggesting downward adjustment:**
1. **Auto sales collapse**: Major consumer spending category down 7% m/m, lowest in 3 years. This is a contemporaneous shock not reflected in January sentiment data. **Weight: -3 percentage points.**

2. **Fed hawkishness**: Lisa Cook's Feb 5 statement emphasizes inflation still elevated, rates staying restrictive. This contradicts any "relief rally" narrative. **Weight: -2 percentage points.**

3. **K-shaped economy intensifying**: Low-income households (majority of population) facing rising delinquencies, stagnant consumption. January improvement was "broad-based" but magnitude smaller for lower incomes. **Weight: -2 percentage points.**

4. **Conference Board at 12-year low**: While different methodology, unprecedented weakness suggests underlying fragility. **Weight: -1 percentage point.**

**Factors suggesting upward adjustment:**
1. **Food deflation momentum**: Eggs down 26%, proteins falling sharply. This directly impacts perceived inflation and purchasing power. Effect may strengthen in February data. **Weight: +3 percentage points.**

2. **January momentum**: Two consecutive monthly increases (Dec→Jan) sometimes continues. However, historical autocorrelation is weak. **Weight: +1 percentage point.**

3. **Consensus expecting stability**: If Feb final ≈56 (flat from Jan), March only needs modest uptick. **Weight: +1 percentage point.**

**Net adjustment**: -3 percentage points from base rate of 48%.

**Structural consideration**: The current level (mid-50s) is historically depressed. Mean reversion suggests eventual recovery, but one-month horizon too short for reliable mean reversion. The 30-day window means macro trends (labor, Fed policy) haven't fully materialized in consumer psychology yet.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 48%, I apply:
- Downward pressure from auto sales shock, Fed hawkishness, income inequality stress, Conference Board weakness: -8 points
- Upward pressure from food deflation, momentum, consensus stability: +5 points
- Net adjustment: -3 points

**Calibrated probability: 45%**

This reflects:
- Slight tilt toward "No" (March ≤ February) given recent negative data
- Recognition that one-month changes remain highly noisy
- Acknowledgment that food deflation is a genuine positive force
- Conservative adjustment given mixed signals

**Sensitivity check**: 45% implies 11:9 odds against a March increase. This feels appropriate given:
- Base rate near 50-50
- Recent hard data (auto sales) pointing down
- Soft data (food prices) pointing up
- Net slightly negative but far from decisive

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will March 2026 preliminary UMich Consumer Sentiment exceed February 2026 final reading? Resolution by March 10, 2026.

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view 48% (historical Feb→Mar pattern). Final prediction 45% represents modest -3pt adjustment, staying close to base rate. ✓

3. **Consistency**: "45 out of 100 times, March preliminary sentiment exceeds February final." This aligns with near-toss-up odds given mixed current signals and high monthly volatility. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - January 2026 final at 56.4 (confirmed, establishes baseline)
   - Auto sales collapsed 7% in January to 3-year low (hard data, negative)
   - Food deflation accelerating: eggs -26%, proteins -20%+ (hard data, positive)
   - Fed's Cook warns inflation "too hot," K-shaped economy worsening (authoritative, negative)
   - Conference Board at 12-year low in January (correlated index, negative)

5. **Blind spot**: If February consumer spending data (released late Feb) shows unexpected strength despite auto sales weakness, sentiment could surge. Alternatively, if major tariff announcement or geopolitical shock occurs in late February, sentiment could crater. Either scenario would make 45% look poorly calibrated.

6. **Status quo**: January = 56.4. If February final ≈ 56-57 (flat), status quo suggests March preliminary also ≈ 56-57 (flat). This favors "No" outcome slightly, consistent with 45% prediction. ✓

Probability: 45%
