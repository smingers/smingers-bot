Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria / what is being asked  
This resolves **Yes** if **March 2026 preliminary** University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (released early March) is **greater than** the **February 2026 final** index (released late February), per the University of Michigan website.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what is fact vs opinion)

- University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (Jan 2026 final report; posted Jan 2026, latest official release)  
  - Quality: **Very high** (primary source; defines the metric used for resolution).  
  - Facts: Jan 2026 final sentiment **56.4** vs Dec 2025 **52.9**; inflation expectations (1-year **4.0%**); commentary that gains were broad-based; interviews ended Jan 19.  
  - Opinion/interpretation: Joanne Hsu’s interpretation about purchasing-power pressure, weakening labor market prospects, tariff uncertainty.

- Together Planning “Quarterly Economic Update” (Feb 2, 2026)  
  - Quality: **Moderate** (secondary synthesis; not a primary data producer).  
  - Facts (as cited): Jan sentiment modestly improved; holiday sales +4.1%; GDPNow raised; Conference Board confidence fell sharply.  
  - Opinions: Narrative connecting these indicators; methodology-differences explanation is plausible but not definitive.

- Morningstar week-ahead preview (Jan 30, 2026)  
  - Quality: **Moderate** (reputable financial press; but this is a calendar/consensus preview).  
  - Facts: It reports an **expected** Feb preliminary sentiment ~**54.3** (forecast, not actual).  
  - Key limitation: Forecast may be stale/variable; not the actual Michigan number.

- FRED UMCSENT series (latest values through Dec 2025 in provided extract)  
  - Quality: **High** (authoritative historical data distributor).  
  - Facts: Confirms late-2025 levels (e.g., Dec 2025 52.9) and downtrend into late 2025.  
  - Limitation: No forward-looking content.

- WSJ / National Jeweler (Conference Board confidence articles; Jan 2026 and Nov 2025 context)  
  - Quality: **High** for what they measure, but **indirect** for this question (different survey).  
  - Facts: Conference Board confidence dropped sharply to multi-year lows.  
  - Limitation: Different methodology; sometimes diverges materially from Michigan.

- AskNews / Reuters-style macro & sector pieces (Feb 2–5, 2026)  
  - Benzinga (Feb 5; Fed Gov. Lisa Cook remarks):  
    - Quality: **Moderate** (secondary reporting of identifiable Fed official).  
    - Facts: Cook says inflation still too hot; “K-shaped” strain; tariffs lifted core goods; markets expect no March rate change.  
    - Opinion: Cook’s risk framing; but it’s an identifiable policymaker view.
  - ISM services story (Feb 4):  
    - Quality: **Moderate** (summary of standard indicators).  
    - Facts: Services expansion continues; **prices** index higher; **new orders** down; employment softer.
  - Morningstar/MarketWatch car sales (Feb 4):  
    - Quality: **Moderate-high** (credible; concrete sector data).  
    - Facts: January car sales down; weather contributed; affordability/tariffs/insurance costs cited as ongoing headwinds.
  - Morgan Stanley AlphaWise survey summaries (Feb 2):  
    - Quality: **Moderate** (credible institution; but proprietary survey; not Michigan).  
    - Facts: Their sentiment measures improved; electronics spending intentions weakened.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (larger shifts)
- **Mechanics of what’s compared (March preliminary vs February final)**: February’s value is a *final* (often revised) while March is *preliminary* (noisy). This comparison can subtly disadvantage “Yes” if finals tend to revise upward. Evidence: **January revised up a lot** (54.0 prelim → 56.4 final).  
  - Weight: **Strong**, because it directly affects the threshold March must beat.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- **Consensus/preview expecting February preliminary to drop** (Morningstar expects ~54.3 vs Jan final 56.4). If February ends up lower, March can bounce; but if February final revises up, the bar rises again.  
  - Net: slightly **negative** for “Yes” because it signals deterioration *and* finals may revise upward.
- **Conference Board collapse** + multiple contemporaneous stories about weak expectations / K-shaped strain / affordability pressures. Even though it’s a different survey, it’s consistent with downside risk to household mood.  
  - Net: **negative** (but not “strong” because of survey differences).
- **Inflation/tariff-related cost pressure** (Fed Cook; ISM prices higher; tariff-related goods pressure) tends to depress Michigan sentiment via purchasing power and inflation expectations channels.  
  - Net: **negative**.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- **Car sales slump partly weather-driven**: could mean February sentiment weak for transitory reasons and March rebounds.  
  - Net: **slightly positive** for “Yes” (rebound potential), but weak because we don’t know how much Michigan respondents weight this and because weather also affects March if persistent.
- **GDPNow / earnings strength**: supportive macro backdrop for higher-income households, but Michigan sentiment lately seems more constrained by prices/purchasing power and labor-market anxiety.  
  - Net: small **positive** at best.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **2026-02-05**. Resolution by **2026-03-10**. Time left: ~**33 days**.  
- If timeframe were **halved (~16 days)**: we’d mostly be forecasting “how February final revises vs February prelim,” and “Yes” would hinge even more on revision mechanics; I’d likely move closer to **50/50** until seeing Feb prelim.  
- If timeframe were **doubled (~66 days)**: more time for genuine macro shifts (labor market/inflation) to move sentiment; given current headwinds, I’d likely drift a bit **below 50%** (more time for negatives to show up).

(d) Justification: updating the outside view (59%) to an inside view
Outside view (59%) leaned on the idea that sentiment may have bottomed (Nov→Jan improvement) and that month-to-month changes are near coin-flips with slight upward momentum.

Key inside-view adjustments:

1) Comparison structure disfavors “Yes” right now  
- We compare **March preliminary** (noisier; can be lower) to **February final** (can revise up).  
- January showed a **large upward revision**. If February also revises upward, March prelim must clear a higher hurdle.  
→ This pushes me **down** meaningfully from 59%.

2) Near-term macro narrative is mixed-to-negative for “March > Feb”  
- Fed messaging + ISM details imply **sticky inflation pressures** and **softening demand/employment** signals.  
- Multiple sources describe strain for lower/middle-income households (a key driver in Michigan commentary).  
→ This nudges **down** further.

3) Countervailing factor: if February is weather/auto-sales weak, March could bounce  
- A transitory February dip could make “Yes” more likely.  
→ This nudges **up** slightly, but I treat it as weaker evidence.

Net: I move from **59%** to a near-coinflip with a slight lean to **Yes**, but much smaller than the outside-view lean, because the *measurement/revision* asymmetry plus inflation/affordability headwinds likely dominate.

Probability calibration
- Outside view base rate (given): **59% Yes**
- Adjustments:
  - Revision/threshold asymmetry (March prelim vs Feb final; January revised up a lot): **-6 to -8 pts**
  - Near-term macro headwinds (inflation/tariffs, K-shaped strain, ISM prices up / orders down): **-2 to -4 pts**
  - Potential February weather-related softness allowing March rebound: **+1 to +3 pts**
- Inside-view estimate: **52% Yes**

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Yes if March 2026 *preliminary* Michigan sentiment index > February 2026 *final* index (Michigan website).”
2. Outside view base rate: 59% Yes.
3. Consistency check: “In 52 out of 100 cases, March prelim exceeds February final.” Plausible given month-to-month noise but higher Feb-final hurdle.
4. Key evidence:
   - January prelim→final revision was strongly upward (54.0→56.4), raising risk Feb final > expectations.
   - Forecasts/previews suggest February prelim may fall back toward mid-50s.
   - Inflation/cost pressure narrative (Fed Cook; ISM prices) + affordability strain weighs on sentiment.
   - Possible transitory February weakness (weather/auto sales) could allow March rebound.
5. Blind spot: A sudden, broad inflation-relief signal (e.g., sharp gasoline/food declines) or strong jobs surprise could lift March prelim well above Feb final (would push Yes much higher).
6. Status quo outcome: With short horizon and noisy prelim/final dynamics, staying near **50/50** is prudent.

Probability: 52%
