Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most-to-least relevant)

1. University of Michigan January-26 final release (56.4, +3.5 pts m/m).  
   • Factual statistical bulletin; highest-quality, dated 31 Jan-26.  
   • Describes breadth of January bounce and still-weak absolute level.

2. Morningstar “What’s happening this week” (30 Jan-26).  
   • Provides the street consensus for February-prelim (54.3).  
   • Reliable calendar/consensus aggregator; figure is a forecast, not fact.

3. Together Planning Quarterly Update (2 Feb-26).  
   • Cites Jan UMich improvement but stresses purchasing-power and labour worries.  
   • Commentary by RIA, moderate reliability.

4. WSJ & Conference Board note (27 Jan-26) and Benzinga / Fed Gov. Cook speech (5 Feb-26).  
   • Factual data: Conference Board confidence collapsed to 84.5 in Jan-26 (12-yr low).  
   • Opinion from identifiable experts (Fed Governor Cook, CB chief economist) that inflation, labour fragility and “K-shaped” economy are weighing on households.

5. ISM-services, car-sales, Morgan Stanley AlphaWise survey (2-4 Feb-26).  
   • Mixed: activity still expanding but demand/intentions for big-ticket items and autos falling.  
   • Single surveys, moderate reliability; point to weakening spending plans.

6. Remaining Asknews items (German/Thai/Russian data, etc.).  
   • Different geographies → weak relevance; ignored for forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong:  
• None – there is no hard February or March UMich reading yet.

Moderate:  
• Street/TradingEconomics consensus sees February prelim ~54.  
• Conference Board’s sharp January drop historically correlates (ρ≈0.55) with same-month UMich moves → tilts toward a February decline.  
• Auto sales crash & ISM new-orders softening provide plausible causal drag on sentiment.

Weak:  
• Fed speeches, equity-market strength, food-price disinflation – anecdotal, signal mixed.  
• January bounce itself (mean reversion) – could help March once February resets lower, but size uncertain.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time until resolution: ~33 days (Feb-5 → Mar-10).  
If horizon were halved (only to Feb-24) I would trim volatility assumptions and move 3 pts toward status-quo (lean “No”).  
If doubled (to Apr-10) I would widen error bars and drift 2 pts back toward 50%, because two readings (Mar prelim & final) often cancel.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (any month-to-month direction) = 52 % “up”.  
Key inside factors:

1. February very likely to print below January (market expects –2 pts); Conference Board collapse makes an even larger drop plausible.  (Raises probability March > Feb because hurdle will be lower.)   +3 pts

2. However, momentum in labour concerns, auto slump, tariff-linked price upticks and Fed “higher-for-longer” talk could keep March soft, preventing a rebound.   –5 pts

3. Typical final-revision pattern: prelim→final usually drifts +0.5-1 pt.  If Feb final revises up, hurdle gets slightly higher.   –2 pts

Net inside adjustment: –4 pts from the 52 % base.

Probability calibration
After balancing the modestly lower February bar against still-deteriorating fundamentals, I estimate:

Probability (March-26 preliminary UMich Consumer Sentiment > February-26 final): 48 %

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will March-26 prelim U-Mich sentiment exceed February-26 final? Decision on ~10 Mar-26.  
2. Base rate used: 52 % (random month-to-month “up”).  
3. Consistency: “48 times out of 100, March will beat February.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Street expects Feb drop to ~54; b) Conference Board crash hints at larger fall; c) Labour/auto weakness persists; d) Final revisions normally +0.5-1 pt upward.  
5. Blind-spot: A sharp mid-Feb stock-market rally & lower CPI print could lift March sentiment >3 pts, flipping outcome.  
6. Status-quo: Sentiment drifting lower for a year, so modest lean to continuation (No).

Probability: 48%
