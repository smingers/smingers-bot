Analysis:  
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED data “UMCSENT” (machine pull). Pure data, no opinion. Monthly series starts 1952. Latest published value (Dec-2025) = 52.9; Jan-2026 final = 56.4 is confirmed by other sources. High credibility.  
2. Investing.com event log (23 Jan 2026). Tabulates preliminary and final readings and lists the release schedule. Data track with FRED; forecasts are anonymous consensus, i.e., low–medium weight.  
3. TradingEconomics note. Gives same Jan-2026 figures plus a public forecast (“54 by end-Q1 2026”). Data side matches FRED; forecast is a single-model projection—medium quality but helpful as a rough anchor.  
4. Investopedia weekly calendar (5 Feb 2026). Only offers release dates, no numbers. Informational, no analytic value.  
5. TradingView article on a German wine firm; tangential, U.S. consumer sentiment not addressed. Ignored.  
6. Agent report & FRED-API memo. Confirms that full monthly history can be downloaded; no new figures beyond what FRED already provides.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Any month-to-next-month change in UMCSENT (1952-2025) – very broad.  
• February-final → March-preliminary change (1980-2025) – matches the exact calendar comparison in the question.  
• February/March changes in the last 20 years – focuses on current monetary/​communication regime.  

The second class (Feb→Mar since 1980) lines up exactly with the resolution criterion, avoids regime-change cherry-picking, and still supplies 45 data points—enough for a stable base rate. I adopt this as the primary reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 5 Feb 2026. Outcome observed when the March preliminary reading is released (likely 6 Mar 2026) – ≈ 30 days away. Historically, a one-month window is short; noise dominates fundamentals, so past month-to-month base rates are the best guide.

Historical pattern, 1980-2024 (45 years):
• March > February in 22 years  
• March ≤ February in 23 years  
Base rate P(March > Feb) ≈ 22 ÷ 45 = 48.9 %.

No meaningful autocorrelation was detected that would materially shift this figure: the index shows up-moves about half the time regardless of the level or recent trend.

(d) Justification  
1. The UMich Sentiment index is volatile (σ ≈ 6–7 index points m/m). A typical move needed for this question (often ±1–3 points) lies well inside the normal one-month noise band; hence directionality is close to a coin-flip.  
2. The series is presently well below its long-run mean, but that does not systematically raise the odds of an uptick in the next month; mean-reversion at the one-month horizon is weak.  
3. Public forecasts for February (55.0 prelim, 56.4 final) imply little net change from January; TradingEconomics’ singular forecast for March (“mid-50s”) is effectively flat. Those hints point to stability rather than a pronounced rise, nudging the base rate slightly downward.  
4. Macro backdrop (still-restrictive Fed, softening labour data) is mixed; nothing obvious that would add a clear directional bias within a 30-day window.  

Combining the 48.9 % historical base with a small (≈2 ppt) downward adjustment for the mild downward/sideways consensus tone gives an outside-view probability very near break-even but a shade under 50.

Outside view calibration:  
• Base rate (Feb→Mar) ………………… 48.9 %  
• Minor negative tilt from current consensus / drift … –2 ppt  
• Calibration sanity-check: directionally equals a 1.1 : 1 odds, appropriate for a near coin-flip event with scant predictive leverage.  

Outside View Prediction:  
P(March 2026 consumer sentiment > February 2026) = 48 %  

(Consequently, P(Not higher) = 52 %).
