Analysis
(a) Source analysis  
1. University of Michigan January-26 final press release (Jan-31) – primary source, hard data (56.4). High reliability, factual.  
2. FRED data page – historical series through Dec-25. High reliability, factual.  
3. Morningstar week-ahead note (Jan-30) – consensus forecast that the Feb-26 preliminary reading will be 54.3. Medium reliability (market survey, not yet realised).  
4. Together Planning “Quarterly Economic Update” (Feb-02) – commentary quoting both Michigan and Conference-Board data. Factual data are reliable; narrative is opinion.  
5. WSJ & Conference-Board January report (Jan-27) – factual 10-point collapse in Conference-Board index to 84.5. Good quality; different survey but often directionally correlated.  
6. Benzinga interview with Fed Gov. Cook (Feb-05) – policy maker’s assessment that inflation is still high and lower-income households are under strain. Reliable opinion from an identifiable expert.  
7. ISM services report (Feb-04, Anue) – factual PMI 53.8 and details. Medium reliability, indirect indicator of sentiment.  
8. Morgan Stanley Alphawise survey (Jan-22-26) – proprietary consumer survey; shows sentiment up but spending intentions down. Single source; moderate quality.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (↓ probability)  
• January Conference-Board index plunged 10 pts – historically the Michigan index often echoes large C-B moves within 1–2 months.  
Moderate evidence (↓)  
• Consensus forecast for Feb preliminary Michigan = 54.3 (-2.1 pts from Jan). If realised, March must climb back just to beat Feb.  
• Fed & NY-Fed commentary: still-elevated inflation and “K-shaped” labour market hurting lower-income consumers.  
Moderate evidence (↑)  
• Stock market making new highs; falling food inflation – typically supportive for sentiment.  
• Seasonality: in 46 years since 1980, March has exceeded February 25 times (54 %).  
Weak evidence (mixed)  
• ISM services still expanding; auto sales slump; Morgan-Stanley shows better overall sentiment but weak durable-goods intent.

Weighting: the Conference-Board plunge and expected February dip carry more weight than the mild seasonal tendency and market strength.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until outcome: ~30.  
If the horizon were halved (15 days, i.e., before Feb final is known) uncertainty would rise and I would widen the probability toward 50/50.  
If doubled (60 days) we would already know the Feb final and see early March labour-market and CPI prints; a confirmed Feb drop would push my probability further down into the high-30 % range.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate (Feb→Mar moves since 1980): 54 % “up”.  
Adjustments:  
• Likely lower February level (consensus 54.3 vs 56.4 Jan) means the bar for March to clear is modest, yet downward momentum is in place. (-7 pp)  
• Large contemporaneous fall in Conference-Board index and weaker high-frequency data (auto sales, electronics intentions). (-5 pp)  
• Positive offset from equity rally and easing food inflation. (+3 pp)  
Net inside-view estimate ≈ 45 %.

Probability calibration
Point estimate: 45 % chance the preliminary March-2026 Consumer Sentiment Index will exceed the final February-2026 reading.  
Distribution: I view 30-60 % as the 80 % confidence interval; true odds are unlikely to be far outside that band.

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Criterion: “Is March-26 preliminary UMich index > Feb-26 final?” – answered.  
2. Base rate 54 %.  
3. “45 out of 100 times, March beats February” – coherent.  
4. Key evidence: a) Forecast Feb prelim 54.3; b) Jan Conference-Board −10 pts; c) Equity rally, food-price relief; d) Historical 54 % up-rate; e) Fed warns of low-income strain.  
5. Blind-spot: An unexpected positive Feb payroll/CPI print lifts sentiment sharply in early March. Would raise Yes probability.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; only modest 10 pp shift from 55 %→45 %.

Probability: 45%
