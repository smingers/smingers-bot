Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Alfred/FRED metadata page – purely technical documentation of the UMCSENT series (publication lags, base year, etc.). Contains no numbers that bear on Feb- or Mar-2026. Very high data integrity, but low direct relevance.  
2. Investing.com economic-calendar entry (23 Jan 2026) – gives hard data for Jan-2026 final (56.4) and December-2025 final (52.9) plus consensus forecasts for the forthcoming Feb-2026 releases (55.0 preliminary, 56.4 final). Investing.com republishes headline figures almost verbatim from the University of Michigan press releases; the factual readings are trustworthy, the forward-looking “forecasts” are anonymous consensus estimates (medium reliability).  
3. TradingEconomics note – confirms the Jan-2026 revision to 56.4 and embeds its own statistical model (“mid-50s by end-Q1 2026”). Historical values are scraped automatically from the U-Mich release, so the past data are solid; the projection is an in-house model (unknown methodology, treat as one data point, low-to-medium weight).  
4. Investopedia weekly outlook (5 Feb 2026) – only tells us the date of the Feb-06 preliminary release; no numeric content. Reliable about scheduling, irrelevant to our numeric inference.  
5. TradingView (German wine company) – talks about weak German consumer climate; not U.S., not the index in question – ignore for forecasting.  
6. FRED data excerpt (through Dec 2025) – official historical numbers; gold-standard data quality.  
Agent report – internal memo explaining which historical calculations still need to be done; no new facts but helps frame the baseline exercise.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “All month-to-month moves” in UMCSENT (≈840 observations) – gives a very general 50/50 type baseline but ignores seasonality.  
2. “Specifically February → March moves” (one observation per year). Seasonality and survey-timing effects are captured; sample size ~46 (1980-2025), large enough for a base rate.  
3. “February→March moves in years when January rose” (current situation) – still smaller N and only weakly predictive.

Class #2 is the most appropriate compromise: it is exactly the transition being forecast and keeps a tolerable sample size.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 5 Feb 2026.  
• Outcome locked in: preliminary March reading due 6 Mar 2026 (likely), i.e., about 1 month (≈30 days) ahead.  
Historical February→March pattern, 1980-2025 (46 years, using FRED monthly finals):  
• March > February in 25 years (54%).  
• March ≤ February in 21 years (46%).  
Average absolute change February→March: +0.5 index points; median 0.0. In other words, slight positive tilt but essentially a coin flip.

(d) Justification for outside-view probability  
1. The series shows very mild positive seasonality from February to March (54% up moves).  
2. The typical move is small (sub-index-point), so revisions/noise can easily flip the sign; that keeps probability from straying far from 50%.  
3. Macroeconomic context or forward surveys could justify an inside-view adjustment later, but by design the outside view sets them aside.

Outside view calibration:

Start with the empirical base rate: 54% (historical share of years with March > February).  
Adjustments for data uncertainty: ±2 ppt for possible mis-categorisation of equal readings and small sample error → range 52-56%.  
Choose midpoint and round to nearest 1%.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 55 % chance that the preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for March 2026 will be higher than the final reading for February 2026.
