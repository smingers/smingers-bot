You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will U.S. consumer sentiment in March 2026 be higher than in February 2026?

Question background:
For decades, the University of Michigan has [tracked consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Consumer_Sentiment_Index) among the United States public. Broadly understood, [consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence) is meant to measure how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are feeling about the state of the economy at large as well as about their personal financial situation. High consumer confidence is thought to lead to increased spending, whereas low consumer confidence would lead to increased saving, in either case affecting the broader economy.

Michigan's [Consumer Sentiment Index](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php) is a monthly measure that is normalized to have had a value of 100 at the beginning of 1966. In recent years, the value has been considerably lower, and the index trended downward over the course of 2025. That said, the preliminary value for January 2026 (54.0) is higher than the final value for December 2025 (52.9).

<br />

Each month, the University of Michigan [releases](https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) a preliminary value during the beginning of the month and a final value during the end of the month.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if the preliminary value of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for March 2026 is greater than the final value of the Consumer Sentiment Index for February 2026, according to the data on the [University of Michigan website](https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/).

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve UMCSENT series; list Feb and Mar values back to 1980 and calculate the share of years when March > February; also summarize recent trend and forecasts for March 2026.
The original assignment asks for three deliverables:

1. A February/March panel of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) from 1980-present.  
2. The share of those years in which March > February.  
3. A short assessment of the most recent behaviour of the index and a quantitative outlook for March 2026.

What the current search results do – and do not – supply

A. Historical February/March data  
• The FRED “observations” HTML page confirms that the UMCSENT series is continuous back to November 1952 and that monthly values can be exported through the fredgraph.csv endpoint (fred.stlouisfed.org) but the CSV itself is not present in any search‐indexed page.  
• Only six of the 92 required data points (1980-02/03, 1981-02/03, 1982-02/03) are explicitly visible in snippets, plus the 2025-02 (64.7) and 2025-03 (57.0) values noted in earlier rounds. That leaves roughly 84 observations still missing. Without them the February/March table and the March-better-than-February frequency cannot be computed.

B. Recent trend  
• The index hit a cycle trough of 50.0 in June 2022, rebounded to 79.4 by March 2024, slid steadily through 2025 to 52.9 in December 2025 and edged up to 56.4 in January 2026 (fred.stlouisfed.org “Observations” panel; Investing.com event log, 23 Jan 2026).  
• Qualitatively, media coverage attributes the 2025 decline to renewed tariff fears and sticky inflation (CNBC, 14 Mar 2025). The modest January 2026 uptick is characterised as “a highest reading in four months, but still historically low” (WUHF, 9 Jan 2026).

C. Forward-looking March 2026 view  
• TradingEconomics’ calendar continues to be the only open-web source giving an explicit figure; it places the first-quarter 2026 UMich headline in the “mid-50s” range (TradingEconomics page dated 2 Jan 2026).  
• No Blue Chip, Bloomberg, or bank-research point forecasts surfaced in the present search set, and Deloitte’s Q4-2025 U.S. macro outlook, while detailed, stops at consumer-spending aggregates and never cites UMCSENT (Deloitte Insights, Q4 2025).

Sufficiency relative to the assignment

• Part 3 (trend and forecast) can be answered today with cited numbers and a single public forecast, although the outlook would benefit from at least one corroborating source.  
• Parts 1 and 2 cannot be completed because the bulk of the February/March history is still absent.

Information gaps that remain

1. The full UMCSENT history must be downloaded—either through:  
   • https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=UMCSENT (public but not indexed), or  
   • FRED’s API endpoint: https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=UMCSENT&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json.  
   Once obtained, filter Year ≥ 1980 and Month ∈ {2, 3}, pivot into a two-column table, and compute (March > February).  
2. A second quantitative forecast for March 2026 (e.g., Conference Board, Blue Chip, or a major bank) is still desirable for triangulation.

Feasibility of closing the gaps

• The CSV/API route is straightforward and free; Google simply does not crawl that file type. A manual or programmatic fetch is therefore necessary.  
• Additional forecasts are likely to reside behind paywalls. If open-source corroboration proves elusive, referencing the TradingEconomics figure with a caveat (“only public forecast located”) may be unavoidable.

Provisional deliverable based on current evidence

1. February/March values: incomplete (6 of 92 data points confirmed).  
2. Share of years with March > February: cannot yet be calculated.  
3. Recent pattern:  
   • June 2022 low: 50.0  
   • March 2024 rebound peak: 79.4  
   • Dec 2025: 52.9, Jan 2026 flash: 56.4 (FRED; Investing.com)  
   The index has retraced roughly half of its 2022-24 recovery and is now hovering in the mid-50s, still ~30 points below its long-run mean.  
   Outlook: TradingEconomics projects “mid-50s” for March 2026, implying little change from current levels and suggesting that sentiment is expected to stabilise rather than surge.

Next recommended actions

• Fetch the CSV/API file and complete the February/March panel immediately; compute the March-better-than-February statistic.  
• Run targeted queries for pay-walled consensus data or bank research (e.g., “Blue Chip Consumer Sentiment March 2026 pdf”) if access permits, or consider using professional terminals.

Until those steps are taken, the assignment remains only partially fulfilled.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
