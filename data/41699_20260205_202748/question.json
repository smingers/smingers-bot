    "description": "For decades, the University of Michigan has [tracked consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Consumer_Sentiment_Index) among the United States public. Broadly understood, [consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence) is meant to measure how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are feeling about the state of the economy at large as well as about their personal financial situation. High consumer confidence is thought to lead to increased spending, whereas low consumer confidence would lead to increased saving, in either case affecting the broader economy.\n\nMichigan's [Consumer Sentiment Index](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php) is a monthly measure that is normalized to have had a value of 100 at the beginning of 1966. In recent years, the value has been considerably lower, and the index trended downward over the course of 2025. That said, the preliminary value for January 2026 (54.0) is higher than the final value for December 2025 (52.9).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=concconf&v=202601231506V20230410&h=350&w=700&ref=/united-states/consumer-confidence&type=spline&d1=2023-01-01&d2=2026-01-31\" height=\"350\" width=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<br />\n\nEach month, the University of Michigan [releases](https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) a preliminary value during the beginning of the month and a final value during the end of the month.",

    "fine_print": "This question will resolve based on the preliminary value for March. It will use the latest available estimate for February published at that time.\n\nIf the resolution source becomes unavailable but the Consumer Sentiment Index numbers are published elsewhere, this question may resolve according to other credible sources. If the University of Michigan does not publish any Consumer Sentiment Index value for March before March 14, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.",
