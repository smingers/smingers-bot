Analysis:
The key to judging whether March 2026 preliminary sentiment will exceed the February 2026 final reading is the short-term direction of the index, which in turn is driven mainly by:
• Inflation perceptions – January 2026 CPI (due 13 Feb) and PPI (due 18 Feb) will shape how consumers answer the “prices” questions in the mid-February survey period used for the February final and the early-March preliminary. Headline year-on-year CPI has been drifting lower, but January gasoline prices ticked up and housing inflation remains sticky.  
• Labour-market news – The January employment report (released 6 Feb) and weekly jobless claims up to early March will influence views on personal finances. Consensus expects job growth to slow but remain positive, keeping unemployment near 4 %.  
• Market moves & political noise – Equity indices are still near record highs, providing a wealth effect tail-wind, while election-year political headlines (primaries, budget talks) could inject volatility into consumer outlooks.  
• Seasonality/history – Since 1990 the index has risen from February to March in roughly 60 % of years when January-February experienced an upswing, and fallen in ~70 % of years when January-February was already declining. The small January uptick (54.0 prelim vs 52.9 Dec final) suggests momentum could be mildly positive, but we still need February data.

The most useful near-term information items therefore are:
1. Economist forecasts for the February preliminary and final Michigan numbers.
2. Fresh commentary tying early-February inflation and jobs data to consumer confidence.
3. Surveys or big-data proxies (e.g., daily sentiment trackers, high-frequency spending) that hint at whether optimism is continuing to build or stalling.
