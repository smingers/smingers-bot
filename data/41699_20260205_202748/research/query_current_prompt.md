The forecasting question is:
Will U.S. consumer sentiment in March 2026 be higher than in February 2026?

Question background:
For decades, the University of Michigan has [tracked consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Consumer_Sentiment_Index) among the United States public. Broadly understood, [consumer confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence) is meant to measure how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are feeling about the state of the economy at large as well as about their personal financial situation. High consumer confidence is thought to lead to increased spending, whereas low consumer confidence would lead to increased saving, in either case affecting the broader economy.

Michigan's [Consumer Sentiment Index](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php) is a monthly measure that is normalized to have had a value of 100 at the beginning of 1966. In recent years, the value has been considerably lower, and the index trended downward over the course of 2025. That said, the preliminary value for January 2026 (54.0) is higher than the final value for December 2025 (52.9).
