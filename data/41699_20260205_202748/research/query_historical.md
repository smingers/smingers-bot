Analysis:
To assess whether March 2026 preliminary sentiment will exceed February 2026 final, the most useful context is:  
• The latest reported (early-February) preliminary reading for February 2026, so we know the hurdle.  
• How often sentiment has risen from February to March in the past (seasonality / base rate).  
• The longer-term trend over 2024-26 and any recent analyst commentary on what is driving changes.  
For the historical pattern we can use the UMCSENT series from FRED (monthly final readings) as a close proxy; this lets us compute the Feb→Mar change going back decades. Current-month news coverage will supply the February 2026 preliminary figure and market expectations.
