Speaking at the Economic Club of Miami, she supported the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) decision to hold rates steady, noting that personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation ended 2025 at 2.9%, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Cook attributed recent price pressures to a 'notable uptick' in core goods prices following tariff increases in 2025. She stressed the need for stronger evidence of sustainable disinflation before altering policy, warning that losing credibility could entrench higher inflation expectations. Cook also highlighted a growing 'K-shaped' or 'two-speed' economy, where higher-income households maintain robust spending while low- and moderate-income families face rising delinquencies, stagnant consumption, and worsening financial strain. She cited rising Black and youth unemployment rates since spring 2025, along with decades-long cost increases in housing, healthcare, and childcare, as key drivers of declining consumer sentiment. Despite strong GDP growth of 4.4% in Q3 2025, Cook warned that macroeconomic indicators do not reflect the lived reality of vulnerable households. While she remains optimistic about AI-driven productivity gains in the long term, she views current risks as tilted toward higher inflation, justifying a period of policy stability. Market expectations, as reflected in CME Group's FedWatch tool, indicate a 90.1% chance of no rate change in March 2026. In early 2026, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose 0.35% and 2.31%, respectively, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.25%. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 4.64% gain. On February 5, 2026, SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) closed down 0.48% at $686.19, and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) declined 1.75% to $605.75.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 12:55 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/economic-data/26/02/50407691/feds-lisa-cook-says-inflation-is-still-too-hot-and-a-k-shaped-economy-is-leaving-low-income-americans-behind)\n\n**Thai January headline CPI drops 0.66% y/y, below forecast By Reuters**\nThailand's annual headline consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.66% year-on-year in January 2026, marking the 10th consecutive month of deflation, according to the Commerce Ministry. This decline exceeded the Reuters poll forecast of a 0.40% drop and remained significantly below the Bank of Thailand's target range of 1% to 3%. The decrease was driven by lower energy prices and government measures aimed at reducing living costs. The core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and fresh food prices, rose 0.60% year-on-year. The ministry projected that headline inflation would remain negative in February and March before turning positive in March.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:55 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/thai-january-headline-cpi-drops-066-yy-below-forecast-4486456)\n\n**India and U.S. Reach New Tariff Agreement, Boosting Market Outlook Amid 'Threefold Positive' Momentum**\nIndia and the United States reached a new tariff agreement in early February, marking a major advancement in trade policy. The U.S. reduced tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%, below most Asian countries, in response to India\u2019s pledge to reduce Russian oil purchases and increase American imports. This development boosted market sentiment, pushing India\u2019s Sensex index up 2.54% on March 3. Analysts highlight three key drivers for India\u2019s stock market: fundamental strength, improving corporate earnings, and favorable policy changes. The trade policy uncertainty has been alleviated, and India\u2019s recent free trade agreement with the EU further supports export growth and industrial upgrading. India\u2019s economic growth remains the strongest among major economies, with corporate earnings accelerating. According to market data, most Indian industries are expected to maintain double-digit profit growth in 2026, with materials, industrial, and non-essential consumer sectors growing over 20%. The 2026-2027 Indian budget focuses on 'fiscal stability and infrastructure expansion,' introducing a zero-tax policy to attract foreign investment in data centers and AI infrastructure, while also boosting incentives for electronics manufacturing. These developments strengthen India\u2019s position in global supply chains. The Group\u2019s fund manager, Xiang Siying, recommends gradual investment in Indian funds to capture the rebound, particularly in industrial, export-oriented, infrastructure, and defense sectors. The combination of strong fundamentals, earnings momentum, and supportive policies suggests positive medium- to long-term outlook for India\u2019s equity market.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:20 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/124373/9310434)\n\n**U.S. Services Sector Growth Remains Strong in January, But Report Details Signal Emerging Concerns**\nThe U.S. services sector maintained robust expansion in January, with the ISM non-manufacturing index holding steady at 53.8\u2014meeting market expectations and reaching its highest level since October 2024. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, reflecting the sector\u2019s continued stable growth momentum in early Q1, despite underlying concerns. Business activity rose sharply to 57.4, the highest since October 2024, driven by 11 industries including healthcare, utilities, construction, and retail. However, five sectors\u2014transportation and warehousing\u2014remained in contraction. Demand indicators weakened: new orders fell to 53.1 from a one-year high, while export orders plunged to 45, the worst contraction since March 2023, attributed to geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies. S&P Global\u2019s PMI for U.S. services rose to 52.7, with the composite index at 53, signaling ongoing private sector expansion, though business confidence declined and consumer demand approached stagnation due to high living costs and weak sentiment. Inflation pressures resurfaced, with the ISM prices index climbing to 66.6\u2014the highest in three months\u2014driven by tariff-related costs and wage growth, despite competitive pricing limiting final price hikes. Supply chain conditions tightened, with supplier delivery times rising to 54.2, the highest since October 2024, partly due to harsh weather and snow disrupting logistics. Inventory levels dropped sharply to 45.1, the largest decline since mid-2025, reflecting post-holiday inventory drawdowns. Employment indicators softened: the ISM employment index fell to 50.3, just above expansion, while private payroll data showed weaker-than-expected job growth, indicating cautious hiring. Analysts warn that while the services sector continues to support moderate U.S. economic growth, weakening new orders, employment, and rising costs suggest Q1 growth momentum may further slow.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6332667)\n\n**Central Bank: Growth of Business and Consumer Activity Slowed Down**\nThe Central Bank of Russia reported on February 4, 2026, in its 'Regional Economy' report that the growth of business and consumer activity slowed in January. The report highlights regional and sectoral disparities: large state contracts supported production growth in machine building in the Volga region and energy equipment in the Urals, but private sector orders declined in these industries. Output decreased in coal mining and wood processing in Siberia, and demand for transportation and logistics services remained low in Central Russia. Consumer spending also slowed, with citizens reducing interest in major purchases across most regions, though demand in the tourism sector remained strong. Earlier the same day, Anton Tabakh, chief economist at 'Expert RA,' stated that a pause in the reduction of the key interest rate is likely in February\u2013March 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 04:45 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/economics/55998683-tsb-zamedlilsya-rost-delovoy-i-potrebitelskoy-aktivnosti/)\n\n**Car sales sputtered in icy January. Poor weather wasn't the only problem for auto dealers and the U.S. economy.**\nCar sales in the United States fell to their lowest level in three years in January 2026, dropping to an annualized rate of 14.9 million vehicles, a 7% decrease from 16.1 million in December 2025, according to Wards Intelligence. A major winter storm late in January contributed to the decline, but deeper structural issues are also at play. The expiration of a generous electric vehicle tax credit has prolonged the slump in non-fuel vehicle sales. Automakers have absorbed most tariff costs so far, but rising prices are expected to be passed on to consumers, who are already hesitant due to record-high vehicle prices. Insurance and repair costs have also surged, increasing the overall cost of vehicle ownership. Major automakers including Toyota (TM) and General Motors (GM) have warned of potential sales tapering in 2026. While car sales rose in 2025 for the third consecutive year, growth was driven primarily by high-income consumers benefiting from record stock market performance and high home values. Lower-income households, strained by inflation, bought fewer vehicles. Potential positive factors for 2026 include falling interest rates and a new tax break for car loan interest, which could reduce monthly payments and boost affordability. Weak January sales could negatively impact first-quarter GDP unless a strong rebound occurs in February and March. Car sales are a key indicator of consumer spending and overall economic health. According to Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, 'Stock-market performance could be important for vehicle sales this year,' as high-income consumers drive most new-vehicle purchases and vehicle purchases are among the most wealth-sensitive forms of spending.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:26 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20260204149/car-sales-sputtered-in-icy-january-poor-weather-wasnt-the-only-problem-for-auto-dealers-and-the-us-economy)\n\n**Central Bank Survey: Analysts Improve Rouble Forecast, Expect Dollar Below 100 for Three Years**\nAccording to the February 2026 macroeconomic survey by the Bank of Russia, economists surveyed from January 30 to February 3, 2026, revised their forecasts downward, expecting the average annual exchange rate of the US dollar to the Russian ruble (USD/RUB) to remain below \u20bd100 for at least the next three years. The new median forecasts are: \u20bd85 in 2026 (down from \u20bd90.3), \u20bd94.5 in 2027 (down from \u20bd97.6), and \u20bd98.9 in 2028 (down from \u20bd102). This represents a 3.1% to 5.8% reduction in forecasts compared to the December 2025 survey. Analysts anticipate a stronger ruble over the forecast horizon. The projected key interest rate remains unchanged at 14.1% for 2026, but is expected to rise to 10.4% in 2027 (up from 10.3%) and 9% in 2028 (up from 8.9%). Inflation forecasts were adjusted upward for 2026 to 5.3% (from 5.1%), with expectations of inflation returning to the target of 4% in 2027 (4.1%) and 2028 (4%). GDP growth forecasts remained unchanged: 1.1% in 2026, 1.7% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. The results reflect the median of 30 economists' projections from various institutions. The next survey is scheduled for March 6\u201310, 2026. As of February 4, 2026, the official exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Russia was \u20bd76.9817 per dollar.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:45 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/quote/news/article/6983451b9a79470a76c896b2)\n\n**Wealthy Americans spending more while poorer households face higher inflation, study finds**\nAccording to data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on February 3, 2026, higher-income Americans and college-educated households have significantly increased their spending since 2023, with incomes of $125,000 and above seeing a 2.3% inflation-adjusted spending rise, compared to 1.6% for middle-income households ($40,000\u2013$125,000) and just 0.9% for those earning below $40,000. Lower-income and rural households experienced higher inflation in the final quarter of 2025, particularly in essential goods like housing, groceries, and utilities. The data, drawn from 200,000 consumers tracked by Numerator and aligned with government retail sales figures, support the concept of a 'K-shaped economy,' where wealthier households drive consumption despite slowing hiring and job cuts in white-collar sectors. College-educated households saw their spending rise 4% by late 2024, while non-college households only regained their January 2023 spending level in November 2024. The New York Fed\u2019s economic heterogeneity indicators highlight growing inequality, with the top 20% of earners capturing 60% of national income (up from 54% in 1990\u201399) and 57% of spending (up from 53%) between 1990\u201399 and 2020\u20132025. A separate Dallas Fed study from November 2025 confirmed rising consumption and income inequality over three decades. The report suggests that the booming stock market has cushioned wealthier households from real estate downturns, while lower-income households face disproportionate inflationary pressures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:27 PM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-wealthy-americans-consumption-spending-inflation-economy/)\n\n**Morgan Stanley survey shows electronics spending intentions are worsening By Investing.com**\nA Morgan Stanley survey conducted from January 22\u201326, 2026, reveals that while U.S. consumer sentiment toward the economy and household finances improved\u2014rising seven points to -6% and ten points to +22%, respectively\u2014intentions to spend on consumer electronics and PCs weakened.

Low-income households showed a 5-point decline to -21%, and high-income households saw a 11-point drop to -12%, with spending plans reaching levels similar to those expected in March 2025. Woodring also stated that tariffs have minimal impact on purchasing decisions, with only 5% of respondents indicating they would reduce purchases due to tariffs.

The AlphaWise survey revealed a seven-point increase in economic sentiment to -6% and a ten-point rise in household financial sentiment to +22%, marking the largest monthly gains in seven months for economic sentiment and the highest since 2023 for financial sentiment. However, forward-looking spending intentions for consumer electronics dropped to -2% for the next month and -7% for personal computers, while six-month outlooks fell to -11% from -7% in November. Households with low income saw a 5-point decline to -21%, and high-income households experienced an 11-point drop to -12%, bringing their spending plans 'nearly in line with March 2025.' Analyst Eric Woodring noted that tariffs appear to have minimal impact on spending decisions, with only 5% of respondents (net) expecting to cut purchases due to tariffs. Morgan Stanley concluded that despite improving sentiment, electronics spending shows early signs of moderation, signaling potential headwinds for the sector in the coming months.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-3091595)\n\n**Consumer Sentiment in Germany 2026: Slight Improvements at Year's Start**\nAccording to GfK's analysis of consumer sentiment in Germany at the beginning of 2026, the overall consumer climate shows slight improvement. The consumer sentiment index rose by 2.8 points to -24.1 in February 2026 compared to the previous month, indicating a modest recovery, though still remaining at a low level. The income expectation indicator increased by 12 points to 5.1, which GfK attributes possibly to the minimum wage increase. The purchase intention indicator improved by 3.5 points to -4.0, the highest level since March 2022 when it reached -2.1. The economic outlook indicator for the next 12 months gained 5.4 points, reaching 6.6\u20148.2 points higher than in the same period of 2025. Inflation had decreased to 1.8% in December 2025, contributing slightly to the easing of sentiment. However, savings intentions remain high and stagnant. It is important to note that consumer sentiment refers to all private consumption expenditures, not just retail, which accounts for only about 30% of total private consumption. Purchase intention is a mood indicator that reflects whether consumers consider major purchases advisable, but actual purchases depend on both financial capability and perceived necessity, and specifically apply to durable goods requiring significant investment. According to GfK, the data reflects a cautious optimism, with underlying economic pressures still present.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[Caschys Blog](https://stadt-bremerhaven.de/konsumklima-2026-zum-jahresbeginn-mit-kleineren-lichtblicken/)\n\n**Consumer Sentiment in Germany Improves at Start of 2026 Amid Economic Uncertainty**\nThe consumer sentiment in Germany improved at the beginning of 2026, with the GfK market researchers and the N\u00fcrnberg Institut f\u00fcr Marktentscheidungen (NIM) reporting a rise in the consumer climate index to -24.1 points in February, up 2.8 points from the previous month. This improvement was driven by higher minimum wage and reduced inflation concerns, which boosted income expectations. The income expectation indicator rose by 12 points to 5.1 points in January, while the purchase intention indicator increased by 3.5 points to -4.0 points, the highest level since March 2022. Despite this positive trend, experts caution that the recovery remains fragile, as ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential escalation of trade conflicts could quickly reverse sentiment. The NIM consumer expert Rolf B\u00fcrkl noted that 'the current improvement stands on shaky ground.' Monthly surveys assess consumer sentiment based on income expectations, savings tendencies, and purchase intentions. Additionally, employment showed a slight improvement, with the labor market barometer reaching 100.1 points in January\u2014its sixth consecutive month above 100\u2014though job cuts continue, particularly in the automotive and metal industries, with no clear turnaround yet in sight.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:52 AM\nSource:[ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2026-01/konsum-klima-deutschland-anstieg-februar-gxe)\n\n**Consumer Sentiment in Germany Shows Slight Recovery at Start of 2026**\nThe consumer sentiment in Germany showed a slight improvement at the beginning of 2026, according to the GfK Consumer Climate Index released on January 28, 2026. The index rose by 2.8 points to -24.1 in February compared to the previous month, driven primarily by a significant jump in income expectations, which increased by 5.4 points to 6.6, and a moderate rise in purchasing intentions, which gained 3.5 points to -4.0\u2014its highest level since March 2022. The saving tendency remained largely unchanged. Rolf B\u00fcrkl from the N\u00fcrnberg Institute for Market Decisions (NIM) noted that while the index has partially recovered from its sharp decline in the prior month, the overall level remains low. He cautioned that ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential escalation of trade conflicts could quickly undermine the current improvement, calling the recovery 'on shaky ground.' The recent easing of inflation, which dropped to 1.8% in December 2025, is cited as a key factor behind the improved purchasing sentiment. Analysts interpret the two consecutive increases as signs that consumer confidence may signal a return to moderate economic growth after three years of stagnation or recession, with current projections estimating a 1% GDP growth for Germany in 2026.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:05 AM\nSource:[wallstreet:online](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/20423810-wirtschaft-verbraucherstimmung-erholt)\n\n**Consumer Confidence Rises: GfK Consumer Climate Signals Recovery**\nThe German consumer sentiment, measured by the GfK-NIM Consumer Climate Index, improved in February 2026, rising by 2.8 points to -24.1 points compared to the previous month, signaling a recovery despite still historically low levels. The improvement was primarily driven by a sharp increase in income expectations, which rose by 12 points to a positive 5.1 points, attributed to the minimum wage increase effective January 1, 2026, and declining inflation concerns. Inflation in Germany had fallen to 1.8% in December 2025, strengthening purchasing power.

Inflation expectations declined, with one-year projections falling to 4% (the lowest in a year) and longer-term expectations dropping to 3.3%. Concerns about tariffs have eased, and buying conditions for durable goods have improved, indicating sustained consumer willingness to spend despite high prices. However, overall sentiment levels remain very low according to both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, suggesting the rebound reflects marginal inflation relief and tariff easing rather than a fundamental improvement in purchasing power. Meanwhile, a potential rotation into mega-cap stocks is emerging: on January 24, 2026, large-cap growth stocks rose nearly 0.5%, while small- and mid-cap growth and value stocks declined by 1-2%. Relative and absolute performance scores show a slight turn, with five of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks reporting earnings this week, increasing the odds of upside if results are strong. Nonetheless, the rotation may be short-lived, and recent factor performance could persist into February and March, warranting patience and continued monitoring of market sentiment and factor leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:14 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-sentiment-trends-boost-reflation-odds-200673914)\n\n**U.S. Consumer Sentiment Hits 5-Month High in January 2026 as Inflation Fears Drop to 1-Year Low**\nThe University of Michigan's January 2026 Consumer Sentiment Index, revised to 56.4, marked the highest level in five months, surpassing the preliminary reading of 54.0 and December's 52.9. This marks the second consecutive monthly increase and the highest since August 2025. The rise is attributed to a significant decline in inflation expectations, which fell to a 13-month low of 4.0% for the 12-month outlook, down from 4.3% in December, and a long-term expectation of 3.3%, slightly up from 3.2% in December but still within the Federal Reserve's target range. A key driver of improved confidence is the sharp drop in food prices: sugar prices fell 16.6%, cooking oil by 11.1%, wheat by 10.9%, cheese by 7.5%, milk by 1.9%, eggs by 26% (after a 108% surge in March 2025), chicken breast by 21%, and chicken wings by 48%. According to Bank of America economist Sara Senatore, deflation is spreading across major agricultural products, with animal protein\u2014critical to restaurant chains like Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH), McDonald\u2019s (NASDAQ:MCD), and Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores (NASDAQ:CBRL)\u2014seeing the largest cost reductions. These chains may see improved profit margins in the second half of 2026 if deflation continues. Broad economic indicators suggest sustained growth without overheating: the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis raised Q3 GDP growth to 4.4% (from 4.3%), and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model forecasts 5.4% growth for Q4. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rose 2.8% year-on-year, matching the Fed\u2019s preferred core PCE measure. S&P Global\u2019s preliminary PMI data showed expansion in the U.S. private sector, with a composite index of 52.8 (above 50 indicates growth), services at 52.5, and manufacturing extending its streak of six consecutive months of expansion. S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson noted that while growth remains strong, the pace has slowed compared to the fall\u2019s faster expansion. Despite the overall improvement, consumer sentiment remains over 20% below its level one year earlier, according to Joanne Hsu, Director of the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 05:15 PM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50103626/1-5-1)\n\n**US Consumer Sentiment Hits 5-Month Highs As Inflation Worries Fall To 1-Year Low**\nU.S. consumer sentiment rose to 56.4 in January 2026, the highest level in five months, according to the University of Michigan's revised consumer sentiment index, up from December's 52.9 and the preliminary estimate of 54.0. The increase was broad-based, affecting all income levels, education groups, age brackets, and political affiliations, as noted by Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Despite this improvement, sentiment remains more than 20% below its level from a year earlier. A key driver of the improvement was a decline in inflation expectations: the one-year-ahead projection fell to 4.0% from 4.3% in December and marked the lowest level since January 2025. Long-term inflation expectations rose slightly to 3.3% from 3.2%. The drop in inflation expectations was largely fueled by deflation in food prices: sugar prices fell 16.6% year-over-year, oil dropped 11.1%, wheat declined 10.9%, cheese dropped 7.5%, milk saw a 1.9% deflation, retail eggs plunged 26% in January after peaking at +108% inflation in March 2025, chicken breast prices fell 21%, and wing prices dropped 48%. According to Bank of America economist Sara Senatore, deflation in agricultural commodities gained traction in Q4 2025. With animal proteins making up 25%\u201335% of restaurant input costs, chains like Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), McDonald's (MCD), and Cracker Barrel (CBRL) are expected to see margin improvements if deflation continues. Broader economic indicators also show strength: the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised Q3 GDP growth from 4.3% to 4.4%, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model forecasts 5.4% growth for Q4. The PCE price index rose 2.8% year-over-year in November, with core PCE also at 2.8%, matching expectations. S&P Global's flash PMI data showed the U.S. private sector expanding in January, with a composite index of 52.8 (above 50 indicates growth), services at 52.5, and manufacturing expanding for the sixth consecutive month. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, noted that while growth remains solid, the pace has cooled slightly compared to the fall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/economic-data/26/01/50102236/consumer-sentiment-university-of-michigan-january-2025-pmi-us-economy)\n\n**Consumers' economic outlook falls to lowest level since May**\nU.S. consumer sentiment has slipped to its lowest level since May, falling nearly three index points in the latest preliminary data from the University of Michigan\u2019s Index of Consumer Sentiment released Friday.  The index dropped to 55.4 in early September, down from 52.2 in April and May, the weakest reading since the Trump\u2011tariff announcement in April.  Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu noted that the decline was \"particularly strong\" among lower\u2011 and middle\u2011income households, and that consumers are \"continuing to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation,\" adding that personal finances have eased about 8% this month.  The survey also found that consumers expect unemployment to rise and feel a heightened risk of personal job loss over the next five years.  Job growth has slowed sharply: only 22,000 jobs were added in August, compared with 79,000 in July and a net loss of 13,000 in June.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised the March 2024\u2013March 2025 job addition figure down by 911,000.  Inflation continued to climb in August, and 60% of consumers mentioned Trump\u2019s trade war in unprompted comments, a figure unchanged from August.  The early data represents a 21% drop from September 2024.  Since last September, sentiment has hovered above 70 until February, when it fell to 64.7 and has since ranged between 61.7 and 52.2.  The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next week, which could provide relief and improve consumer confidence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!
