A February/March panel of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) from 1980-present.  \n2. The share of those years in which March > February.  \n3. A short assessment of the most recent behaviour of the index and a quantitative outlook for March 2026.\n\nWhat the current search results do \u2013 and do not \u2013 supply\n\nA. Historical February/March data  \n\u2022 The FRED \u201cobservations\u201d HTML page confirms that the UMCSENT series is continuous back to November 1952 and that monthly values can be exported through the fredgraph.csv endpoint (fred.stlouisfed.org) but the CSV itself is not present in any search\u2010indexed page.  \n\u2022 Only six of the 92 required data points (1980-02/03, 1981-02/03, 1982-02/03) are explicitly visible in snippets, plus the 2025-02 (64.7) and 2025-03 (57.0) values noted in earlier rounds. That leaves roughly 84 observations still missing. Without them the February/March table and the March-better-than-February frequency cannot be computed.\n\nB. Recent trend  \n\u2022 The index hit a cycle trough of 50.0 in June 2022, rebounded to 79.4 by March 2024, slid steadily through 2025 to 52.9 in December 2025 and edged up to 56.4 in January 2026 (fred.stlouisfed.org \u201cObservations\u201d panel; Investing.com event log, 23 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Qualitatively, media coverage attributes the 2025 decline to renewed tariff fears and sticky inflation (CNBC, 14 Mar 2025). The modest January 2026 uptick is characterised as \u201ca highest reading in four months, but still historically low\u201d (WUHF, 9 Jan 2026).\n\nC. Forward-looking March 2026 view  \n\u2022 TradingEconomics\u2019 calendar continues to be the only open-web source giving an explicit figure; it places the first-quarter 2026 UMich headline in the \u201cmid-50s\u201d range (TradingEconomics page dated 2 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 No Blue Chip, Bloomberg, or bank-research point forecasts surfaced in the present search set, and Deloitte\u2019s Q4-2025 U.S. macro outlook, while detailed, stops at consumer-spending aggregates and never cites UMCSENT (Deloitte Insights, Q4 2025).\n\nSufficiency relative to the assignment\n\n\u2022 Part 3 (trend and forecast) can be answered today with cited numbers and a single public forecast, although the outlook would benefit from at least one corroborating source.  \n\u2022 Parts 1 and 2 cannot be completed because the bulk of the February/March history is still absent.\n\nInformation gaps that remain\n\n1. The full UMCSENT history must be downloaded\u2014either through:  \n   \u2022 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=UMCSENT (public but not indexed), or  \n   \u2022 FRED\u2019s API endpoint: https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=UMCSENT&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json.  \n   Once obtained, filter Year \u2265 1980 and Month \u2208 {2, 3}, pivot into a two-column table, and compute (March > February).  \n2. A second quantitative forecast for March 2026 (e.g., Conference Board, Blue Chip, or a major bank) is still desirable for triangulation.\n\nFeasibility of closing the gaps\n\n\u2022 The CSV/API route is straightforward and free; Google simply does not crawl that file type. A manual or programmatic fetch is therefore necessary.  \n\u2022 Additional forecasts are likely to reside behind paywalls. If open-source corroboration proves elusive, referencing the TradingEconomics figure with a caveat (\u201conly public forecast located\u201d) may be unavoidable.\n\nProvisional deliverable based on current evidence\n\n1. February/March values: incomplete (6 of 92 data points confirmed).  \n2. Share of years with March > February: cannot yet be calculated.  \n3. Recent pattern:  \n   \u2022 June 2022 low: 50.0  \n   \u2022 March 2024 rebound peak: 79.4  \n   \u2022 Dec 2025: 52.9, Jan 2026 flash: 56.4 (FRED; Investing.com)  \n   The index has retraced roughly half of its 2022-24 recovery and is now hovering in the mid-50s, still ~30 points below its long-run mean.  \n   Outlook: TradingEconomics projects \u201cmid-50s\u201d for March 2026, implying little change from current levels and suggesting that sentiment is expected to stabilise rather than surge.\n\nNext recommended actions\n\n\u2022 Fetch the CSV/API file and complete the February/March panel immediately; compute the March-better-than-February statistic.  \n\u2022 Run targeted queries for pay-walled consensus data or bank research (e.g., \u201cBlue Chip Consumer Sentiment March 2026 pdf\u201d) if access permits, or consider using professional terminals.\n\nUntil those steps are taken, the assignment remains only partially fulfilled.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"UMCSENT\" query=\"UMCSENT\">\nFRED Economic Data: University of Michigan: Consumer Sentiment\nSeries ID: UMCSENT\nUnits: Index 1966:Q1=100\nFrequency: Monthly\nLatest observation: 52.90 (2025-12-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=58.85, min=51.00, max=74.00\n- 5-year: mean=66.41, min=50.00, max=88.30\n- 10-year: mean=79.66, min=50.00, max=101.40\n- All-time: mean=84.75, min=50.00, max=112.00 (since 1952-11-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +1.90 (+3.7%)\n- 3-month change: -2.20 (-4.0%)\n- 6-month change: -7.80 (-12.9%)\n- 12-month change: -21.10 (-28.5%)\n- Year-over-year: 52.90 vs 74.00 (-28.5%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly):\nDate,Value\n2025-01-01,71.70\n2025-02-01,64.70\n2025-03-01,57.00\n2025-04-01,52.20\n2025-05-01,52.20\n2025-06-01,60.70\n2025-07-01,61.70\n2025-08-01,58.20\n2025-09-01,55.10\n2025-10-01,53.60\n2025-11-01,51.00\n2025-12-01,52.90\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
