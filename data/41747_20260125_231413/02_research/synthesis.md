## Deep Research (AskNews)

As of the search results available (which cover news up to November 21, 2025), Eli Lilly had not yet reported its Q4 2025 financial results. The latest available data from the search results pertains to Q3 2025, which ended in September 2025. In Q3 2025, Zepbound (tirzepatide) generated $3.6 billion in revenue, as reported in October 2025 [7]. 

Eli Lilly typically releases its Q4 and full-year financial results in late January or early February. Given that the current date is January 25, 2026, it is likely that the Q4 2025 earnings report has been released by now. However, this report is not captured in the current search results because the articles we reviewed were all published before November 21, 2025. Therefore, we are unable to provide the reported global revenue for Zepbound in Q4 2025 based on the information in these sources.

To obtain the reported Q4 2025 revenue for Zepbound, I would need access to Eli Lilly's official earnings release or news reports covering it from late January 2026. Without such information, we cannot confirm the exact figure.

If you have access to Eli Lilly's investor relations website or recent financial news, you may find the reported numbers there.

**Russian Analogs of 'Ozempic' Show Threefold Sales Increase in 2025**
Sales of Russian domestic analogs of the drug 'Ozempic' increased nearly threefold in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the Center for the Development of Prospective Technologies (ЦРПТ), operator of the 'Chestny Znak' digital labeling system. In 2024, 1.7 million packages of domestic analogs were sold for 9.2 billion rubles; by 2025, sales rose to 6.1 million packages and revenue reached 35.2 billion rubles. Monthly sales grew from 282,000 packages in January 2025 to 810,000 by December, a nearly threefold increase. Sales in the first half of January 2026 were 17% higher than in the same period of 2025. The growth is attributed to increased domestic production: Russian pharmaceutical companies produced 11.7 million packages of drugs based on semaglutide and tirzepatide in 2025—ten times more than the total import volume of semaglutide-containing drugs from 2020 to 2023. The analogs, produced by Russian firms such as 'Geropharm', 'Promomed', and 'PSK Farma', are registered under 17 trade names as of early 2026. The Russian government authorized the production of these analogs without foreign patent holder consent until the end of 2026 to ensure domestic access to semaglutide. The average price of a domestic package rose from 5,454 rubles in 2024 to 5,763 rubles in 2025, compared to 7,800 rubles for the original imported Ozempic in 2023—reducing treatment costs by over 20%. The highest sales volumes per 10,000 people in 2025 were recorded in Saint Petersburg (807 packages), Moscow (755), Moscow Oblast (738), Krasnodar Krai (650), and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (580). In 2024, the most popular drugs by sales volume were nasal decongestants with xylometazoline, followed by ibuprofen-based painkillers and venous disease treatments with diosmin and hesperidin. Russians spent approximately 1.6 trillion rubles on medicines in 2024, with a 1.4% increase in units sold.

**2025 Preliminary Performance Review: Sustained High Growth and Strong Asset Quality**
The company released its 2025 preliminary performance report, showing continued high growth in profitability. In 2025, the company achieved revenue of 38.799 billion yuan, a 1.1% year-on-year increase, with a slight slowdown of 0.3 percentage points compared to the first three quarters. Net profit attributable to shareholders reached 19.03 billion yuan, up 12.1% year-on-year, down 2.5 percentage points from the first three quarters. Net interest income grew by 12.8%, accelerating by 2.9 percentage points compared to the first three quarters, driven by sustained asset growth and a stabilized net interest margin. However, non-interest income declined by 19.5% year-on-year, with other non-interest income falling 31%, a worsening of 6 percentage points from the first three quarters, primarily due to significant fair value losses in trading accounts amid heightened bond market volatility and reduced motivation to redeem existing bonds given strong net interest income growth. Fee and commission income rose 13.1%, up 0.5 percentage points from the first three quarters. Loan balances grew 14.3% year-on-year, with manufacturing, technology, green, and inclusive small business loans increasing 22.25%, 23.44%, 22.75%, and 17.06%, respectively, all exceeding the overall loan growth rate. Asset quality remains strong, with a non-performing loan ratio of 0.76%, overdue ratio of 0.62%, and 90-day overdue ratio of 0.53%, all stable compared to the end of September. The loan loss provision coverage ratio stood at 502%, down 11 percentage points from the end of September but still among the highest in the industry. The investment recommendation adjusts 2026-2027 net profit forecasts to 21.3 billion and 24.1 billion yuan (down from 23.3 billion and 27.3 billion yuan), with year-on-year growth of 12.0% and 13.2%, respectively. The current stock price corresponds to a 2026-2027 price-to-book ratio of 0.79x and 0.70x, maintaining an 'outperform market' rating. Risk factors include weaker-than-expected macroeconomic recovery, which could negatively impact net interest margin and asset quality.

**Cambridge Technology's 2025 Performance Forecast: Strong Growth Amid FX Headwinds and Strategic Expansion**
Cambridge Technology released its 2025 annual performance forecast, projecting a net profit attributable to shareholders of between 252 million and 278 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 51.19% to 66.79%, and a non-recurring net profit of 249 million to 275 million yuan, up 64.62% to 81.81%. The company's high-speed optical module business benefited from strong demand driven by AI and global data center expansion. The launch of the Jiashan new production base, capacity ramp-up at the Malaysia facility, and ongoing capacity planning have led to significant growth in order volume and shipment volume. Higher-margin, high-speed modules now represent a larger share of sales, improving overall gross margin. However, Q4 was negatively impacted by an estimated foreign exchange loss of 81.61 million yuan due to the Hong Kong dollar's depreciation against the US dollar, as most proceeds from Hong Kong IPO financing were held in HKD. Despite this, the full-year performance remains in line with the forecasted increase. The company has secured silicon photonics chip supply through partnerships with three suppliers via supply agreements or equity stakes, and has secured year-long supply contracts and sufficient inventory for critical components such as lasers and DSPs. Through JDM (Joint Design Manufacturing) partnerships with key North American clients and ongoing product validation with new customers, the company is preparing for large-scale shipments of 1.6T optical modules starting in Q1 2026, with 800G modules remaining the primary product in 2026. Analysts forecast revenue of 5.19 billion, 7.901 billion, and 11.437 billion yuan for 2025–2027, with EPS of 0.77, 2.67, and 4.37 yuan, and corresponding PE ratios of 147, 42, and 26. Despite Q4’s FX loss, the company’s long-term growth trajectory remains strong, leading to an upgraded forecast and a 'Buy' rating. Risks include macroeconomic volatility, R&D delays, intensified industry competition, weaker downstream demand, and slower-than-expected capacity expansion.

**Global 3D Printing Leader, Downstream Demand Approaching Breakout Phase**
The company is a global leader in 3D printing with a comprehensive vertical integration strategy, offering both metal and polymer 3D printing equipment, materials, proprietary software, and after-sales services. With a research and development intensity of 22.23% in the first three quarters of 2025, the company maintains technological leadership. In December 2025, it established a controlled joint venture with affiliated parties to strategically enter the 3C and civilian 3D printing service market, shifting its business model from equipment and material sales to a dual-driven approach of equipment/materials and service provision. Downstream demand is approaching a breakout point, with aerospace and 3C sectors serving as primary growth engines. In aerospace, the company's revenue from this sector reached nearly 50% in 2024, supported by its FS1521M ultra-large-scale equipment, which features XYZ axes exceeding 1.5 meters and up to 32 fiber lasers. Key client Feierkang has purchased approximately 40 units of the company’s metal 3D printing systems. In the 3C and civilian sectors, companies like Apple and Honor are rapidly adopting 3D-printed titanium alloy technology for precision components such as foldable phone hinges and smart wearable frames. The company’s robust product portfolio and technical capabilities position it to drive large-scale 3D printing adoption in consumer electronics. Additional applications in liquid cooling, embodied intelligence, and low-altitude economy further expand its long-term growth potential. Financially, the company is projected to achieve revenue of 691 million, 1.202 billion, and 1.623 billion RMB in 2025, 2026, and 2027, with year-on-year growth of 40.6%, 73.8%, and 35.0%, respectively. Net profit attributable to shareholders is forecasted at 72 million, 163 million, and 242 million RMB, growing by 7.3%, 125.5%, and 48.9% year-on-year. Using a price-to-sales (PS) valuation method, a 40x PS multiple for 2026 yields a target price of 116.06 RMB, with a 'Buy' rating. Key risks include slower-than-expected downstream adoption, raw material price volatility, technological obsolescence, geopolitical and exchange rate fluctuations, and risks from restricted share unlock.

**Obesity Fuels a $150 Billion Pharmaceutical Market, with Mexico as a Key Target**
The global pharmaceutical market for obesity treatments is projected to reach $150 billion by 2035, up from $105 billion forecasted in 2024, according to Morgan Stanley. This growth is driven by rising obesity rates—37% higher than a decade ago, with 1 in 8 people globally affected, per the World Health Organization. In Mexico, 7 out of 10 adults suffer from overweight or obesity, contributing to health costs of 82 to 98 billion pesos (around $5.1 billion USD) annually. The OECD estimates the pharmaceutical market for obesity treatments in Mexico could reach $200 million, yet only 4% of obese individuals currently receive pharmacological treatment. Investors and funds are shifting capital toward companies developing weight-control drugs, anticipating multi-billion-dollar returns. Key players include Eli Lilly, Roche, Amgen, Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, and Zealand Pharma. Pfizer acquired Metsera for approximately $7 billion, boosting its stock by over 5% in 2025. Eli Lilly, a U.S. leader in obesity drugs, reported 1.1 million active prescriptions for Mounjaro and Zepbound in the U.S., and in Mexico, it aims to treat over 250,000 patients with tirzepatide by 2025, with plans to triple that number by 2026. Eli Lilly’s stock rose over 45% in the past 12 months. In contrast, Novo Nordisk saw its market value drop 24.62% over the same period due to revised sales and profit forecasts, citing a slowdown in obesity treatment growth, especially in the U.S. Despite this, Novo Nordisk continues investing 80% of its $1 billion annual research budget in obesity, with semaglutide 2.4 mg showing up to 20% weight loss in one-third of patients. The company emphasizes that obesity is a chronic, non-communicable disease and faces challenges including widespread use of unregulated 'miracle' weight-loss products sold online for as little as $10–$60, which pose serious health risks such as brain damage, dependence, or death. Legally prescribed drugs in Mexico cost over 7,000 pesos per pen and require weekly administration, often for years, and are only available with a doctor’s prescription. The article highlights the tension between public health needs, pharmaceutical innovation, and the risks posed by unregulated alternatives.

**German Fund Managers Boost Infrastructure Stocks Ahead of Economic Recovery**
German equity fund managers are increasing their exposure to companies benefiting from Germany's anticipated economic recovery in 2026, the first year of noticeable growth since the Covid-19 pandemic. In the fourth quarter, funds surveyed by 'The Market NZZ' added or increased positions in infrastructure-related firms. Jens Ehrhardt of DJE Kapital boosted holdings in Hochtief, citing a sustained growth trend and favorable valuation, and added Nordex, noting strong new orders. He also entered Siemens Energy, citing high demand for gas turbines from data centers and power grids. Ehrhardt added Sartorius and Drägerwerk, the latter reporting a 5.3% revenue increase to 3.5 billion euros in 2025 (2 billion from medical tech, 1.5 billion from safety tech) and Ebit rising over 16% to 226 million euros. Christoph Gebert of Acatis Fair Value Deutschland ELM made Drägerwerk his largest holding after increasing stakes in Q2 2025; its share price rose from under 70 to over 85 euros. Gebert believes the stock is undervalued, trading at a discount of over 10% to its 2027 book value, with expected Ebit margin growth and 1–5% revenue growth in 2026, forecasting significant earnings growth. Gebert also added 2G Energy, a block heater and small gas power generator manufacturer, noting 10% real-term annual growth and a projected revenue increase from 400 million to 600 million euros by 2028. He also increased positions in Jungheinrich and SAF-Holland, both benefiting from economic recovery. Christian Krahe raised his stake in Jost-Werke, a truck coupling supplier, after the Möhrle family fully divested their 20% stake, removing a market overhang. Jost reported strong results, with 2025 revenue estimated at 1.5 billion euros (42% growth), though net profit is expected to fall due to integration costs from Hyva acquisition. Analysts project 20% annual revenue growth and 18% net profit growth by 2027, with a modest P/E of 12. Christian Reindl increased exposure to KSB, whose share price tripled from 300 to 1,000 euros in five years, and added Stabilus, a supplier of electric trunk and door systems, expecting a near-doubling of net profit to 47 million euros in 2026 despite a slight revenue dip. Reindl also expanded his position in another company poised to benefit from the German recovery, though the full details are only available in the complete article from 'The Market NZZ'.

**Kangpei Resubmits CBL-514 IND Application with Revised Indication to FDA for Subcutaneous Fat Reduction**
Kangpei (6919) announced on January 23, 2026, that it is resubmitting its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its new drug CBL-514 injection, combined with tirzepatide (Eli Lilly), to the U.S. FDA. The intended indication has been revised from 'weight management' to 'reduction of subcutaneous fat' following FDA feedback. The original Phase 2 clinical trial, CBL-0201WR, was completed and submitted to the FDA on December 24, 2025. The FDA advised that CBL-514 alone does not meet the criteria for weight management, prompting the company to modify the indication. The revised trial design remains unchanged: a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CBL-514 plus tirzepatide in obese or overweight subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint will be changes in abdominal subcutaneous fat volume and body weight measured by MRI. The trial plans to enroll 100–120 participants. The company has completed Phase 1 and is preparing to reapply for Phase 2 approval. Phase 3 and NDA are still pending. The company cited the global market shift toward reducing fat mass and preventing metabolic deterioration post-treatment as key drivers, noting that GLP-1 drugs like tirzepatide reduce fat cell size temporarily but not number, leading to rebound weight gain and metabolic decline after discontinuation. With tirzepatide's cumulative sales reaching approximately $24.8 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 and Morgan Stanley projecting the global weight-loss drug market to reach $150 billion by 2035 at a 25% CAGR, there is significant market potential for therapies targeting persistent fat reduction. The company emphasized that the clinical development timeline is subject to change and that no financial projections are disclosed. Investors are advised to proceed with caution due to the high risk and uncertainty inherent in drug development.

**Eli Lilly Soared by 39% in 2025, but Here's Another Healthcare Stock to Buy in 2026**
Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) delivered a 39% share gain in 2025, driven by strong performance in the high-growth obesity drug market, particularly through its tirzepatide-based products Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). The global obesity drug market is projected to reach nearly $100 billion by the end of the decade. While Eli Lilly leads the market, the article highlights Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) as a promising healthcare stock to consider for investment in 2026. Viking is developing VK2735, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist in late-stage clinical trials—injectable in phase 3 and oral in phase 2—designed to regulate blood sugar and appetite similarly to Lilly’s tirzepatide. Phase 2 trial results showed up to 14.7% body weight reduction after 13 weeks without a plateau. Although Viking has no commercialized products and faces risks in drug development and regulatory approval, the company could attract strategic partnerships or acquisition interest. The Motley Fool recommends both Novo Nordisk and Viking Therapeutics, noting that while Viking carries high risk due to its early stage, it offers substantial upside potential if successful.

**Intel Faces Major Sell-Off After Weak Guidance Despite Strong Q4 Earnings**
Intel faced a major setback in the U.S. stock market after releasing its quarterly earnings report on January 23, 2026, with its stock plunging over 11% in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance. While Intel reported Q4 2025 revenue of $13.67 billion (slightly above the $13.43 billion market estimate) and adjusted EPS of $0.15 (above the $0.09 forecast), the company projected Q1 2026 adjusted EPS of $0.00—well below the $0.08 consensus—and revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, below the $12.56 billion expectation. The adjusted gross margin was forecast at 34.5%, below the 36.5% analyst estimate. Intel CEO Patrick Pichette stated that 'demand is strong, but we are struggling with manufacturing yield,' adding that 'our execution needs to improve.' CFO David Zinsner confirmed that Q1 2026 supply would reach its 'lowest point,' citing insufficient inventory to meet seasonal demand. The company had exhausted most of its inventory in Q4 2025. Analysts warn that ongoing yield issues may lead to lost market share to AMD and long-term structural risks. Despite Intel’s prior stock surge—up 47% year-to-date and nearly 150% over 12 months—driven by optimism over data center growth, CEO reforms, and investments from the U.S. government, NVIDIA, and SoftBank, the weak outlook triggered a sharp correction. Meanwhile, the broader U.S. market rose: the S&P 500 gained 0.55%, the Nasdaq rose 0.91%, and major tech stocks like Meta (+5%), Tesla (+4%), and NVIDIA rose. Positive macro data—including a revised Q3 2025 GDP growth of 4.4% (vs. 4.3% forecast), lower-than-expected jobless claims, and stronger-than-expected unemployment data—boosted market sentiment. Additionally, President Trump’s remarks at the Davos Forum, where he ruled out tariffs on European nations over Greenland and signaled a framework for future agreements, eased geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s call for 'trillions of dollars' in global AI infrastructure investment amplified demand for semiconductor stocks. Chinese stocks also rallied: the Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index rose 1.58%, with Alibaba, Pony.ai, and Bilibili gaining over 5%, and JD.com, Li Auto, and NIO rising over 3%.

**2025 'Annual Report Season' Kicks Off with Strong Performance in Hard-Tech Sectors**
The 2025 'annual report season' for A-shares officially began with the release of the first annual report by Shenzhen-listed company Wohua Pharmaceutical. In 2025, Wohua Pharmaceutical reported revenue of 817 million yuan, a 6.96% increase year-on-year, and net profit attributable to shareholders of 95.7153 million yuan, up 162.93% year-on-year, with operating cash flow increasing 40.45%. The company also announced a cash dividend plan of 1.46 yuan per 10 shares (tax included) for the 2025 interim report, with plans for further stable dividends. As of January 22, 2026, Wind statistics show 569 companies have released annual performance forecasts, with 243 reporting positive results—42.71% of the total. Among them, 209 companies expect net profit exceeding 100 million yuan, and 130 expect a year-on-year increase of over 100%. For example, Huisheng Biological expects a median net profit increase of 1,355.24%, while Hocomm (a subsidiary of Midea) forecasts a 385.62% to 628.43% increase. According to Tian Lihui, director of the Institute of Financial Development at Nankai University, the strong performance reflects China's structural shift toward 'new growth drivers' and 'high-quality development,' with innovation and global competitiveness replacing traditional factor-driven growth. Key sectors like AI, computing power, semiconductors, and communication equipment are leading growth, with sub-sectors such as digital chip design and integrated circuit packaging and testing showing strong pre-announcement trends. Moer Technology, a newly listed company, expects revenue of 1.45 billion to 1.52 billion yuan (230.70% to 246.67% increase) and a narrowed loss of 950 million to 1.06 billion yuan (from 1.618 billion yuan loss in 2024), citing strong demand for high-performance GPUs in AI and improved market recognition. Bawei Storage, a leading storage module company, forecasts revenue of 10 to 12 billion yuan (49.36% to 79.23% increase) and net profit of 850 million to 1 billion yuan (427.19% to 520.22% increase), attributing growth to stabilized and rising storage prices from Q2 2025, project deliveries, and a new wafer-level advanced packaging project in Dongguan’s Songshan Lake, expected to contribute revenue by end-2026. Tian Lihui notes that the surge in hard-tech sectors results from the 'resonance' between global AI computing investment and China’s industrial upgrading strategy, marking a transition from quantitative to qualitative progress in supply chain self-reliance. Beyond hard tech, gold-related firms like Chifeng Gold and Zijin Mining also reported strong growth: Chifeng Gold expects net profit of 3 to 3.2 billion yuan (70% to 81% increase), while Zijin Mining forecasts 51 to 52 billion yuan (59% to 62% increase). Chaohong Ji also expects a 125% to 175% profit increase. As of February 15, 2026, 10 more companies, including Zhinanbiao and Xindao Technology, are scheduled to release annual reports before the Lunar New Year. Tian Lihui advises investors to shift focus from mere growth numbers to assessing growth quality, emphasizing sustainability, innovation value, and global business capability, particularly distinguishing between short-term cyclical gains and long-term trends driven by technological moats and market share. Key metrics for innovation include R&D intensity and the efficiency of converting R&D into core patents and products.

**Eli Lilly (LLY) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript**
Eli Lilly (LLY) reported strong Q3 2024 financial results, with revenue growing 42% excluding the olanzapine portfolio, driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound sales. Global Mounjaro sales reached $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $728 million internationally. Zepbound U.S. sales surpassed $1.2 billion, with 87% commercial formulary access as of October 1, 2024. Prescription volume for both drugs grew 25% sequentially. New product revenue increased by over $3 billion. Gross margin rose to 82.2%, supported by favorable product mix and higher realized prices. Operating income reached nearly $1.8 billion, while EPS was $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023, despite a $3.08 per share negative impact from acquired IPR&D charges. R&D expenses increased 13%, primarily due to investments in early- and late-stage development, with $2.8 billion in IPR&D charges from the Morphic Therapeutics acquisition. The company updated its 2024 revenue guidance to $45.4 billion to $46 billion, with the midpoint implying nearly 50% Q4 growth. Expected EPS is $12.05 to $12.55 (reported) and $13.02 to $13.52 (non-GAAP), reflecting $3.1 billion in IPR&D charges. Mounjaro and Zepbound supply is on track to exceed a 50% increase in sellable doses in H2 2024 vs. H2 2023. Key pipeline milestones include: 94% reduction in Type-2 diabetes risk and 23% sustained weight loss in pre-diabetic adults on tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-1); modified dosing for donanemab reduced ARIA-E incidence to 14% (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6); insulin efsitora alfa met all five Phase 3 primary endpoints with 40% lower severe hypoglycemia vs. insulin glargine (QWINT-1); and positive EMBER-3 data for imlunestrant in breast cancer, with an NDA submission planned by year-end. The company announced a $2 billion investment in Ireland and a separate $4.5 billion for the Lilly Medicine Foundry in Indiana, bringing total manufacturing expansion commitments since 2020 to over $20 billion. Capital returns totaled $1.6 billion via dividends and share repurchases. Regulatory approvals were received for Ebglyss (atopic dermatitis) in the U.S., Kisunla (early Alzheimer’s) in Japan and the U.K., and Omvoh gained first-line access at two of three major U.S. PBMs. Trulicity revenue declined 22% globally due to lower volume, partially offset by higher prices. U.S. channel inventory for Mounjaro and Zepbound decreased, reducing Q3 sales by a mid-single-digit percentage. Daniel Skovronsky stated, 'the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen,' supporting an upcoming supplemental FDA submission.

**GLP-1 Obesity Drugs Surpass Keytruda in Global Sales, Marking a Paradigm Shift**
In 2024, global sales of GLP-1 obesity drugs, including Eli Lilly's 'Mounjaro' and 'Zepbound' (tirzepatide) and Novo Nordisk's 'Wegovy' and 'Ozempic' (semaglutide), reached approximately $358 billion and $356 billion respectively, surpassing the $315 billion in sales of the long-standing top-selling immunotherapy cancer drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) by Merck (MSD). Although Keytruda remains the top-selling single product, the combined sales of GLP-1 obesity drugs now exceed Keytruda's revenue by about 13–14%, according to a report by Yujeung Investment Securities citing Bloomberg consensus. The report interprets this shift as a structural signal that the paradigm in treatment for obesity and metabolic diseases is reshaping the blockbuster drug landscape, previously dominated by cancer therapeutics. Sales of GLP-1 drugs are projected to reach around $850 billion in 2024, with Mounjaro expected to generate $450 billion and Wegovy $400 billion. Keytruda’s sales forecast for 2024 is below $350 billion. The report attributes the sustained dominance of obesity drugs to the introduction of oral formulations, such as Novo’s recently FDA-approved Wegovy tablets and Eli Lilly’s pending application for its oral version of tirzepatide, dubbed 'Oral Mounjaro'.

**Prediction: This Surprising Growth Stock Will Reach -- and Stay in -- the Trillion-Dollar Club in 2026.**
The article predicts that Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), a healthcare company, will become the first non-technology firm to join the 'trillion-dollar club'—defined as companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion—by 2026. While the club currently includes tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the article highlights Eli Lilly’s recent rise: it briefly touched $1 trillion in market cap in November 2025, becoming the first healthcare company to do so, before falling to approximately $904 billion. The prediction is based on Lilly’s strong growth in the weight loss drug market, driven by its drugs tirzepatide—marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss—which have generated blockbuster revenue. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the global weight loss drug market will grow from $28 billion to $95 billion by 2030 and exceed $100 billion, supporting the forecast. The article emphasizes that while market cap alone does not determine investment value, Lilly’s combination of stable revenue, dividends, and explosive growth in its weight-loss portfolio makes it a likely long-term contender for sustained trillion-dollar status.

**Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club by 2028**
Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has seen its market capitalization briefly exceed $1 trillion, driven by the success of its GLP-1 agonist drugs, tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. In the third quarter, tirzepatide generated $10.1 billion in revenue, accounting for 57% of Eli Lilly’s total revenue and contributing to a 54% year-over-year revenue increase. The drug surpassed Keytruda (Merck) to become the world’s best-selling medication. Since May 2022, Lilly’s stock has risen 633% over five years and 38% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500’s 87% five-year gain and 16% annual return. Analysts project the GLP-1 market could grow from $49 billion in 2025 to over $157 billion by 2035, though some forecasts are being revised downward due to 'price erosion'—notably, Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed in November 2025 to lower prices for Medicare patients. However, growth potential remains strong due to expanding global demand, especially in emerging markets like China, where obesity rates are projected to reach 65% by 2030. Additionally, new applications for GLP-1 drugs are emerging, including treatments for addiction, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and even pet obesity. Despite short-term pricing pressures, Eli Lilly is positioned as a market leader, with the potential to reach a $2 trillion market cap by 2028, according to the article’s author. The article is published by The Motley Fool and includes disclosures of stock positions in related companies.

**'Old Money' vs. 'New Rich': Lilly Rises, Novo Nordisk Falls, but the Ultimate Battle in the Weight-Loss Drug Race Is Far from Over**
Lilly and Novo Nordisk have become global market barometers, with their every move influencing investor sentiment. On November 21, 2025, Lilly surpassed the $1 trillion market cap milestone, becoming the first pharmaceutical company to join the 'trillion-dollar club,' even surpassing Walmart in market value. In contrast, Novo Nordisk, after briefly becoming Europe's top stock, saw its share price drop nearly 50% year-to-date, losing approximately $190 billion in market value. The volatility underscores how any news from either company—on financial guidance, clinical results, or pricing strategies—can trigger rapid market reassessment. Once the leader in weight-loss drugs, Novo Nordisk now faces fierce competition from Lilly, which has shifted from follower to challenger. The race is far from over. Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 drug, semaglutide, launched in 2021 for weight loss, initially dominated the market. Lilly responded in 2023 with tirzepatide, which gained approval for both diabetes and weight loss. The turning point came in May 2025, when Lilly’s SURMOUNT-5 trial showed tirzepatide achieved 20.2% average weight loss at week 72—significantly higher than semaglutide’s 13.7%—with a 1.47-fold relative weight reduction. This superiority translated into market share gains: in Q2 2025, tirzepatide sales ($85.8 billion) surpassed semaglutide ($80.3 billion), and in Q3, tirzepatide reached $101.03 billion versus semaglutide’s $88.62 billion. By Q3 2025, tirzepatide held 57.9% of U.S. prescription share, compared to semaglutide’s 41.7%. While semaglutide still leads in total revenue (254.62 billion USD vs. 248.37 billion USD), trend momentum favors Lilly. Lilly raised its 2025 revenue forecast to $630–635 billion, while Novo Nordisk repeatedly cut guidance, now projecting only 4–7% local currency operating profit growth—below its earlier 4–10% range. A key strategic divergence lies in pipeline diversification: Lilly’s multi-target approach includes Alzheimer’s drug donanemab, with projected sales rising from $465 million in 2024 to $3.2 billion by 2030. Novo Nordisk, reliant on semaglutide, is under pressure to expand beyond GLP-1. It has accelerated its oral semaglutide application after Lilly announced its oral GLP-1 orforglipron. In a bid to strengthen its pipeline, Novo Nordisk bid aggressively for Metsera but lost to Pfizer. This reflects broader strategic anxiety as the market shifts from a 'legacy vs. newcomer' rivalry to a more complex, multi-player competition. Novo Nordisk is undergoing frequent leadership changes and urgent strategic shifts, transitioning from market dominance to survival in a new era of therapeutic innovation.

**This Healthcare Company Just Touched $1 Trillion in Market Cap. Should You Invest $1,000?**
Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) became the first healthcare company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, briefly surpassing the threshold on November 21, 2025, during intraday trading, though its value dipped slightly to around $950 billion before rebounding to $1 trillion again on Monday, November 24, 2025. The company's shares have risen 38% in 2025 and 645% over the past five years. This surge is primarily driven by tirzepatide, a GLP-1 drug sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, which became the world’s best-selling drug in the third quarter of 2025, capturing 58% of the GLP-1 market. The global GLP-1 drug market, valued at $52 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to $187 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 17%. Additionally, in early November 2025, Eli Lilly struck a deal with the Trump administration to reduce prices for Medicare and Medicaid patients—cutting Zepbound’s cost from $1,000 to $299 per month—gaining a three-year tariff exemption and expanded access to 68 million Medicare and 71 million Medicaid beneficiaries, significantly increasing its potential patient base and revenue stream.

**Massive sales for weight loss drugs spur Eli Lilly's Q3**
Eli Lilly reported record-breaking Q3 2025 results, with total revenue surging 54% year-over-year to $17.6 billion—exceeding the Zacks consensus estimate of $16.01 billion by 9.91%. This growth was driven by strong demand for tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). Mounjaro generated $6.5 billion in Q3 2025, a 109% increase from the same quarter in 2024, while Zepbound sales rose 185% to $3.6 billion. Global demand for weight-loss drugs offset lower pricing, contributing to the robust performance. Lilly’s shares closed at $844.50 on October 30, 2025, up 3.6% from the prior day, with a market capitalization of $757 billion. Tirzepatide’s sales have surpassed MSD’s Keytruda, signaling a potential shift in the global pharmaceutical market leadership. In response, Lilly raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $63–63.5 billion, up from $62 billion. The results were notable amid CVS Caremark’s announcement to make Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy the preferred GLP-1RA treatment from July 2025. On the same day, Novo Nordisk entered a $9 billion bidding war for Metsera, a move Pfizer criticized as 'reckless'—Pfizer had already agreed to acquire Metsera in September. Metsera is developing longer-acting GLP-1RAs, which Novo aims to integrate into its Ozempic and Wegovy brands. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly plans to submit its oral GLP-1RA candidate, orforglipron, to the FDA for obesity approval in 2025, with a type 2 diabetes application expected in 2026. GlobalData forecasts orforglipron could reach $11 billion in sales by 2031.

**3 Things Investors Need to Know Ahead of Eli Lilly's Q3 Earnings Report | The Motley Fool**
Eli Lilly (LLY) is set to report third-quarter earnings on October 30, 2025, amid heightened investor scrutiny following a 10.7% stock decline from June 2024 to October 20, 2025. The company's rapid growth, driven by the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide—marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight management—has fueled a 32% revenue increase in 2024, with combined sales of the two drugs reaching $16.47 billion. In the first half of 2025, tirzepatide sales surged 121% year over year to $14.7 billion. However, concerns persist over generic and compounding pharmacy competition, though evidence suggests such threats remain limited. Despite strong performance, not all revenue streams are growing: Trulicity, a previously top-selling GLP-1 drug, is losing market share to Mounjaro, and Jardiance’s revenue is declining. Eli Lilly’s second-quarter revenue rose 38% year over year, but analysts at Goldman Sachs have downgraded global anti-obesity drug sales forecasts to $95 billion by 2030 from $130 billion. Tirzepatide’s superior efficacy comes with higher side effects—nausea—making it less tolerable than Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy. The stock trades at 35.8 times forward earnings, a premium valuation justified by a 122% EPS growth over three years. However, the company faces patent cliffs: Trulicity may lose exclusivity in the U.S. by 2027, risking biosimilar competition that could pressure Mounjaro sales. Off-label use could also erode Zepbound’s market. With the GLP-1 market maturing, sustained high growth rates may no longer be sustainable. If tirzepatide’s momentum slows, investors could face significant losses as the stock reverts to typical pharmaceutical industry growth rates.

**3 Things Investors Need to Know Ahead of Eli Lilly's Q3 Earnings Report**
Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) is set to release its third-quarter earnings on October 30, 2025, amid mixed investor sentiment. The company's stock rose 147.5% from late 2022 to mid-2024 due to strong performance of its tirzepatide-based drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight management), which generated combined sales of $16.47 billion in 2024—more than tripling year-over-year. In the first half of 2025, tirzepatide sales surged 121% year over year to $14.7 billion. Despite this, Eli Lilly's stock declined 10.7% from late June 2024 to October 20, 2025, due to concerns over unauthorized compounding pharmacies undercutting branded sales, though these fears appear unfounded given the robust sales growth. However, not all revenue streams are expanding: Trulicity, a GLP-1 diabetes drug, and Jardiance are losing market share. Patent expirations, particularly Trulicity’s U.S. exclusivity ending in 2027, could lead to biosimilar competition, threatening future sales. Additionally, tirzepatide’s side effects, such as nausea, make it less tolerable than Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, which could limit market share. Eli Lilly’s stock trades at a rich 35.8 times forward earnings, supported by a 122% EPS growth over the past three years. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have lowered their 2030 global anti-obesity drug market forecast to $95 billion from $130 billion, signaling potential growth deceleration. The Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor team did not include Eli Lilly in its current list of top 10 stocks to buy, warning that if tirzepatide’s growth stalls and the company reverts to typical pharma industry growth rates, investors could face significant losses.

**These 2 AI Stocks Could Surpass Oracle in Market Cap by 2030**
Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has transformed from a legacy database company into a key player in global AI infrastructure, with a $455 billion contracted backlog as of August 31, 2026, and a market cap exceeding $801 billion as of October 2025. Its cloud infrastructure revenue grew 54% year over year to $3.3 billion in Q1, driven by its AI database and multicloud strategy. However, Oracle missed analyst estimates for revenue and earnings, reported negative free cash flow, and plans $35 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2026, indicating a focus on long-term growth over short-term profits. Its reliance on large contracts, such as the $300 billion deal with OpenAI, exposes it to counterparty risk. Despite its strength, two companies—Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)—are seen as having higher growth potential. Palantir’s revenue rose 48% year over year to $1.03 billion in Q2, with a 46% operating margin and $569 million in adjusted free cash flow. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), built on ontology-based architecture and supported by client boot camps, has accelerated sales and delivered real-world efficiency gains. Government contracts, including a $10 billion, 10-year U.S. Army deal, provide sticky revenue. Palantir’s stock trades at 204.8 times forward earnings, but if it sustains over 30% revenue growth and 40%+ operating margins, it could surpass Oracle’s market cap by 2030. Eli Lilly’s revenue grew 38% to $15.6 billion in Q2, with non-GAAP EPS up 61% to $6.31. Its tirzepatide-based drugs—Mounjaro and Zepbound—generated $5.2 billion and $3.4 billion in revenue, respectively, and the company produced 1.6 times more doses in H1 2025 than in H1 2024. Tirzepatide’s cardiovascular benefits may expand insurance coverage, and its oral candidate orforglipron could drive rapid adoption. With a pipeline including donanemab and retatrutide, and market research forecasting $62 billion in annual tirzepatide revenue by 2030, Eli Lilly could grow revenue at over 20% annually and maintain margins above 40%, potentially surpassing Oracle’s market cap before 2030. The article concludes with a promotional note about The Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor service, which did not include Oracle in its top 10 recommended stocks.

### Worldline SA
. In April 2023, Crédit Agricole and Worldline enter into exclusive discussions to create a major player in merchant services in France. Both groups announce the contemplated creation of a joint company fully operational by 2025 combining Crédit Agricole’s merchant acquiring footprint, French market intimacy and distribution power with Worldline’s leading innovation, technology and global infrastructure. In January 2024, Crédit Agricole SA acquired a minority stake of 7%. On 13 June 2024, at Worldline's Annual General Meeting and as announced on 21 March 2024, the Board of Directors decided, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, to appoint Mr Wilfried Verstraete as Chairman of the Board of Directors. On September 30, Gilles Grapinet stepped down as CEO and director of the company and Worldline is looking for a new CEO who will work with the Board of Directors to determine a new strategic plan. Marc-Henri Desportes, previously Worldline Deputy CEO and Head of Merchant Services, is acting as interim CEO. In November 2024 it became public that Worldline considers selling its Mobility and e-Transactional Services (MTS) business. On March 1, 2025, Pierre-Antoine Vacheron [fr] was appointed CEO, succeeding Marc-Henri Desportes. In June 2025 a network of international press researchers, operating under the name "Dirty Payments", accused the company of handling billions of euros in fraudulent or unethical payments over decades, using subsidiaries. The German based Payone, of which Worldline SA held 60%, was accused in 2023 by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of dealing with high risk customers, prone to Money laundering. Payone, by its own account, then cut ties with these customers in summer 2023, but they were apparently just handed over to another Worldline subsidiary, according to the researchers. Dutch investigators accused the company of continuing to work with customers, who had been identified by Worldlines own risk assessment as problematic. The publication of the findings caused Worldlines share price on 25 June 2025 to fall by 21%

Worldline SA

. Worldline's revenue was divided, in 2024, as follows: Merchant services (73,1%) Financial services (19,4%) Mobility & transactional web services (7,5%) In spring 2017, Worldline developed in collaboration with the Belgian bank Belfius the first smartphone payment application in Belgium. Worldline also operates Saferpay. Chairman (since June 2024): Wilfried Verstraete CEO (since March 2025): Pierre-Antoine Vacheron List of main shareholders as of December 31, 2024. Worldline has come under criticism for maintaining its operations linked to Russia despite the country’s invasion of Ukraine. While the company states that its business in Russia accounts for only a small portion of its revenue and is operated from outside the country, this continued engagement has drawn scrutiny amid international efforts to isolate Russia economically. Critics argue that such actions contradict global sanctions and ethical considerations, as the war in Ukraine persists with devastating consequences for civilians.

### Tirzepatide
. These studies measured weight reduction after 72 weeks in 2,519 participants who received either 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepatide once weekly and 958 participants who received weekly placebo injections. In both trials, after 72 weeks of treatment, participants who received tirzepatide at all three dose levels experienced a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared to those who received placebo, and greater proportions of participants who received tirzepatide achieved at least 5% weight reduction compared to placebo. In August 2024, the SURMOUNT-1 three-year study (176-week treatment period) found that tirzepatide reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 94% in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight. A 2021 meta-analysis found that over one year of clinical use, tirzepatide was superior to dulaglutide, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine in improving blood sugar and obesity. In a phase III double-blind, randomized, controlled trial supported by Eli Lilly, nondiabetic adults with a body mass index of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, were randomized to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo. The mean percentage change in weight at week 72 was −15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], −15.9 to −14.2) with 5-mg weekly doses of tirzepatide, −19.5% (95% CI, −20.4 to −18.5) with 10-mg doses, and −20.9% (95% CI, −21.8 to −19.9) with 15-mg doses. Weight change in the placebo group was −3.1% (95% CI, −4.3 to −1.9). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for tirzepatide priority review designation. The FDA approved Mounjaro for use in the U.S. in 2022

Tirzepatide

. In July 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending granting a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Mounjaro, intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2022. In December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide (Zepbound) as the first medication to be used in the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The FDA granted the application for tirzepatide (Zepbound) fast track, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designations for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The FDA granted the approval of Zepbound to Eli Lilly. In the U.S., some compounding pharmacies prepare compounded versions of a drug on the FDA's drug shortages list if the compounded drug meets certain conditions detailed in federal law. The FDA declared a shortage of tirzepatide in December 2022. It declared the shortage over in October 2024, but enforcement was delayed until the end of 2024, after a lawsuit by compounding pharmacies challenged the declaration. The U.S. National Association of Boards of Pharmacy says there are tens of thousands of online pharmacies operating out of compliance with state and federal regulations or the association's recommendations. The FDA has not evaluated these for safety and effectiveness and they are thus considered not to have been shown to be safe or effective. In a phase III trial, tirzepatide demonstrated clinically significant benefits among participants with obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Over two years of follow-up, tirzepatide decreased participants' risk of major cardiovascular (CV) complications—a combined endpoint including urgent heart failure visits, hospitalizations, more frequent diuretic treatment, and CV mortality—by 38% compared to a placebo. An observational study on patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction reported that tirzepatide had a lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause death combined than sitagliptin. In a 72-week, phase IIIb open-label head-to-head trial of adults with obesity without diabetes, tirzepatide at the maximum tolerated dose produced greater mean weight loss than semaglutide and larger reductions in waist circumference, while gastrointestinal adverse events were the most common with both drugs

Tirzepatide

. After stopping treatment with tirzepatide for obesity, people on average regain more than half (53%) of the weight they lost during treatment within a year. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2024 found that tirzepatide demonstrates benefits in the management of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist
. During the 1980s, Jean-Pierre Raufman worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health for John Pisano, a biochemist who specialized in collecting venoms from various animals and looking for novel substances that could affect human physiology. In the course of this work, Raufman focused on investigating the Gila monster because he was curious about how it only eats once or twice per year. He found that Gila monster venom had biologically active molecules that provoked inflammation of the pancreas in test animals. In 1992, after learning of Raufman's findings, John Eng of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in New York City used the radioimmunoassay technique he had learned from Nobel laureate Rosalyn Sussman Yalow to isolate a novel substance from Gila monster venom. The new substance, which Eng called exendin-4, was similar to GLP-1 in that it reduced blood glucose in diabetic mice, but exendin-4 had a much longer half-life than GLP-1, whose extremely short half-life had defeated earlier attempts to turn it into a drug. Eng's employer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, had no interest in obtaining a drug patent on exendin-4, so Eng filed the patent application himself in 1993. He then spent three years searching for a pharmaceutical industry partner interested in commercializing exendin-4. In 1996, Amylin Pharmaceuticals licensed Eng's patent and created a synthetic version of exendin-4 called exenatide. In 2002, Eli Lilly entered into an alliance with Amylin to further develop exenatide and secure official approval to market the drug. Exenatide's 2005 approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was a landmark event that proved that targeting the GLP-1 receptor was a viable strategy and inspired other pharmaceutical companies to focus their research and development on that receptor. In 2011, Lilly and Amylin dissolved their partnership, with Amylin keeping the rights to exenatide. Meanwhile, Lilly had been awakened to the possibilities of this class of drugs and continued to develop newer drugs of the same class. The 2024 American Diabetes Association conference included presentations on at least 27 GLP-1 receptor agonists then in development

GLP-1 receptor agonist

. By July 2024, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide and Eli Lilly's tirzepatide were ranked among the most popular and lucrative drugs in the world. Novo Nordisk's successful rollout of semaglutide turned it into the most valuable company in Europe in 2024. Its market capitalization of $570 billion was larger than the entire economy of its home country of Denmark, its $2.3 billion income tax bill for 2023 made it the country's largest taxpayer, and its rapid growth drove nearly all of the expansion of Denmark's economy. By October 2024, tirzepatide had turned Eli Lilly into the world's most valuable drug company. A retrospective cohort study published in 2025 evaluated GLP-1 agonists' benefits and risks compared to other anti-diabetic medications. The study suggested that GLP-1 agonists reduced risks of substance use and psychotic disorders, seizures, neurocognitive disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias), coagulation disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, infectious diseases, and several respiratory conditions relative to nonusers. GLP1 poly-agonist peptides, dual and triple receptor agonists such as tirzepatide (GLP-1 + GIP) and retatrutide (GLP-1 + GIP + glucagon) and combinations like cagrilintide/semaglutide which combines semaglutide with a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, are under research for whether these offer an advantage over single receptor agonists. GLP-1 agonists have demonstrated cardioprotective effects when used to treat obesity, beyond their primary roles in glycemic control and weight reduction. GLP-1 agonists may be beneficial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In a retrospective study, GLP-1 exposure was associated with lower risks of specific types of obesity-associated cancers compared with insulin or metformin in people with type 2 diabetes. Compared to people using insulin, people taking GLP-1 agonists showed significant risk reduction in esophageal, colorectal, endometrial, gallbladder, kidney, liver, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer, as well as meningioma and multiple myeloma. Kidney cancers showed an increased risk with GLP-1 treatment relative to those treated with metformin

GLP-1 receptor agonist

. GLP-1 agonists have shown antidepressant and neuroprotective effects. They can also be used to treat the metabolic consequences of second-generation antipsychotics, such as obesity. GLP-1 agonists are under development for substance use disorder, a condition with few pharmacological treatment options. They reduce the self-administered intake of drugs and alcohol in non-human animals, though this effect has not been proven in humans. The mechanism of their addiction-reducing effect is unknown. GLP-1 agonists are also under investigation for the treatment of binge eating disorder, the most common eating disorder. Ross, Stuart A.; Ekoé, Jean-Marie (July 2010).

In 2024, 67% of the company's revenues came from the United States. Lilly was the first company to mass-produce both the polio vaccine, developed in 1955 by Jonas Salk, and insulin

. It was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA, including Humulin (insulin medication), Humalog (insulin lispro), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the U.S., Basaglar (insulin glargine). It achieved commercial success with major depressive disorder drugs Prozac (fluoxetine) (1986), Cymbalta (duloxetine) (2004), and its antipsychotic medication Zyprexa (olanzapine) (1996), all of which are now off patent and are manufactured by others as generic drugs. In 2005, Lilly brought exenatide to market—the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonists—followed by blockbuster drugs in the same class such as Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide) in 2022. The Lilly Endowment, a charitable foundation organized in 1937 by the founding family, owns 10% of the company.

### Bureau Veritas
Bureau Veritas is a French company specialized in testing, inspection and certification founded in 1828. It operates in a variety of sectors, including building and infrastructure (27% of revenue), agri-food and commodities (23% of revenue), marine and offshore (7% of revenue), industry (22% of revenue), certification (7% of revenue), consumer products (14% of revenue), and education. Bureau Veritas is present in 140 countries through a network of over 1,500 offices and laboratories, and 79,000 employees. Bureau Veritas generated $6.34 billion in revenue in 2024. Hinda Gharbi has been CEO of Bureau Veritas since June 2023. As of close of trade December 20th 2024, Bureau Veritas is a member of the CAC 40. Bureau Veritas was founded in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1828.

### Tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is an antidiabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and for weight loss. Tirzepatide is administered via subcutaneous injections (under the skin). In the United States, it is sold under the brand name Mounjaro for diabetes treatment and Zepbound for weight loss and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Tirzepatide is a gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) analog and a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, upper abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain. Developed by Eli Lilly and Company, tirzepatide was approved for treatment of diabetes in the U.S. in May 2022, in the European Union in September 2022, in Canada in November 2022, and in Australia in December 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it a first-in-class medication. The FDA approved it for weight loss in November 2023. Also in November 2023, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency revised the indication for tirzepatide (as Mounjaro) to include the treatment for weight management and weight loss. In December 2024, the FDA revised the indication for tirzepatide (as Zepbound) to include the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. In 2023, tirzepatide was the 110th-most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with more than six million prescriptions.

Also in November 2023, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency revised the indication for tirzepatide (as Mounjaro) to include the treatment for weight management and weight loss. In December 2024, the FDA revised the indication for tirzepatide (as Zepbound) to include the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. In 2023, tirzepatide was the 110th-most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with more than six million prescriptions. Tirzepatide (as Mounjaro) is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide (as Zepbound) is indicated, alongside a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for long-term weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Zepbound is also approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity. Tirzepatide is contraindicated for use in people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer and people with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2

### 2022–2025 video game industry layoffs
. On December 12, 2024, the Game Awards 2024 introduced the inaugural Game Changer Award, which was presented to Amir Satvat. He was recognized for his efforts in assisting individuals affected by job loss by helping them find new opportunities. The presentation of the award received a standing ovation and was noted as one of the most significant moments of the event. In 2025, Satvat received the Giving Award from Games for Change, an honor recognizing individuals, companies, or organizations making meaningful contributions to the community through initiatives such as fundraising, scholarships, and career support. He was also honored with the inaugural Industry Impact Award from Game Dev Heroes for helping thousands find work during one of the industry’s most difficult periods. Also that year, Satvat received the Unsung Hero Award at XDS 2025 in recognition of his contributions to community building, knowledge sharing, and support for professionals in external development and the wider video game industry. Unions are relatively rare in the video game industry. But after several public scandals involving abuse, sexism, layoffs, and overwork, some game workers have developed a keen interest in organization in the last few years. After starting the process in April, employees at Sega of America's Irvine, California headquarters filed to become unionized with the Communications Workers of America on July 10, 2023. In July, the union election was successfully won by the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS), with 91 votes in favor and 26 votes against. More than 200 positions in a range of areas, such as marketing, games as a service, localization, product development, and quality assurance, will be covered by the union. On October 6, 2023, Over 100 developers at Avalanche Studio Group unionized. After experiencing layoffs, some workers at CD Projekt Red formed a union on October 9, 2023. According to the union, these layoffs caused significant stress and insecurity among workers, leading to the need for better protection and representation. The union aims to provide more security, transparency, and a stronger voice for workers in times of crisis, believing that mass layoffs pose a threat to the gaming industry and that unionizing is crucial for preserving its potential. The union said its priority was to give CD Projekt Red staff a voice in company decision-making, with a view to increasing employment stability

. It also wants to help workers' voices be heard on working conditions "in the long run." On December 5, 2023, 300 Quality assurance workers at ZeniMax Media announced that they were organizing a union. Additionally, a labor neutrality agreement was announced in June 2023 by Microsoft and the Communication Workers of America (CWA). Under this deal, Activision Blizzard employees were entitled to freely form a union, and Microsoft promised to acknowledge and support that union. On March 8, 2024, 600 workers from Activision's QA team joined CWA, establishing the largest game developer union in North America. Despite the layoffs, studio closures, and cancellations of video game projects, as well as high inflation, the video game market continues to remain robust. Many investors and industry analysts believe that the video game industry will fully recover in 2025 and 2026 with major releases like Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter Wilds, Ghost of Yōtei, Doom: The Dark Ages, Pokemon Legends Z-A, and others. Investors also expect Nintendo to release its new hardware, which will boost video game sales and revenue. Executive Director of Circana (The NPD Group), Mat Piscatella, stated that consumer demand remains strong, but consumers are under pressure due to economic challenges. Some parts of the industry are already growing and in a healthy position, like mobile, and Piscatella believes that other segments will follow suit in 2025. According to a 2024 PwC report, the global gaming industry is expected to reach a value of $321 billion by 2026. Deloitte predicts that the share of theatrical box office revenues from video game intellectual property (IP) will double by 2025. Additionally, most major video streaming platforms are expected to include shows based on popular games. Another report by GlobalData suggests that the video games market could become a $300 billion industry by 2025. Factors contributing to this growth include mobile gaming and innovative offerings. Bain & Company predicts that global gaming revenue could surge by over 50% in the next five years. Mobile video games began growing in 2024, with U.S. mobile gamers spending over $28 billion that year. This marked a recovery for the industry after a two-year economic slowdown, surpassing the previous record set in 2021

2022–2025 video game industry layoffs

. Monopoly Go was the highest-grossing mobile game, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 led in console sales. Monopoly Go generated $2.7 billion alone. U.S. consumer spending on video games totaled $58.7 billion in 2024. The layoffs affected junior staff in greater numbers than other skill levels, and in some cases juniors were specifically targeted. As the industry was recruiting too few juniors to begin with, there are long term concerns for skills development, diversity, and the viability of the games industry as a career path for young developers. The layoffs were demoralising for juniors, and around a third of those who were laid off left the industry entirely. A level designer interviewed by PC Gamer commented that "As a Junior who put blood, sweat, and tears into obtaining my first role in the industry, I am now back again going in circles looking for roles that are junior level (which is non-existent as every job posting I see is either Senior, Principal, or Lead)." The number of junior positions available has been low for years, but fell dramatically during the period. In 2022, 9.4% of available games jobs in the United Kingdom were at the junior level. By 2023 this had fallen to 2.9%, with only 34 junior positions nationwide over the year. The junior figure had partially recovered to 7% by 2024, but there were no apprenticeships sector wide for the entire year. The few junior jobs available are fiercely competed for; XR Games advertised for four junior positions in 2024 and received 18,000 applications. Grads in Games, a major route into the industry for juniors in the UK, was placed on hiatus in 2024 due to the lack of entry level hiring. Industry support for the program had been in place for a decade but now "just doesn't exist". The industry's failure to hire and train new workers is exacerbating existing skills shortages at the senior level, as there are not enough staff progressing through the field and moving up to higher positions. A developer interviewed by DigiDay remarked that by recruiting only existing senior level talent, there may be "no new generation of seniors." In the UK in particular, the first wave of developers are now starting to retire, leaving fewer senior staff to train any new juniors. The current skills structure in the UK games industry is unsustainable
