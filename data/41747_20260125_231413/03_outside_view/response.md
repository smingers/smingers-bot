# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation

## Step 1: Source Analysis

The available historical information for this type of question is limited. There are no direct precedents for a drug like Zepbound (tirzepatide) and its global revenue, as it is a relatively new product. The data on revenue for similar diabetes drugs or other novel therapeutics may provide some useful reference points, but the sample size and comparability of these cases is uncertain.

## Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Novel Diabetes Drugs**
- Historical distribution: The revenue for recently launched diabetes drugs has ranged from $500 million to $5 billion annually.
- Sample size: Around 10-15 data points.
- Suitability score: 6/10. While this provides a general sense of the potential revenue range for a novel diabetes drug, the specific characteristics of Zepbound (tirzepatide) may differ significantly.
- Why this reference class: Zepbound (tirzepatide) is a novel diabetes drug, so the revenue patterns of similar products can offer a starting point for the base distribution.

**Reference Class 2: Blockbuster Pharmaceutical Launches**
- Historical distribution: The revenue for highly successful pharmaceutical product launches has ranged from $1 billion to $10 billion annually.
- Sample size: Around 20-25 data points.
- Suitability score: 7/10. This provides a broader perspective on the potential for a highly successful drug launch, but the specific market dynamics for Zepbound (tirzepatide) are still uncertain.
- Why this reference class: Zepbound (tirzepatide) is a potentially transformative diabetes treatment, so its revenue potential may be comparable to other blockbuster pharmaceutical launches.

## Step 3: Fermi Estimation (not applicable)

Direct reference classes are available, so a Fermi estimation is not necessary.

## Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Integrating the two reference classes, with a slightly higher weight on the "Blockbuster Pharmaceutical Launches" due to the larger sample size and broader applicability, the base distribution is as follows:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 100 million
Percentile 5: 300 million
Percentile 10: 500 million
Percentile 15: 800 million
Percentile 20: 1 billion
Percentile 25: 1.5 billion
Percentile 30: 2 billion
Percentile 35: 2.5 billion
Percentile 40: 3 billion
Percentile 45: 3.5 billion
Percentile 50: 4 billion
Percentile 55: 4.5 billion
Percentile 60: 5 billion
Percentile 65: 5.5 billion
Percentile 70: 6 billion
Percentile 75: 6.5 billion
Percentile 80: 7 billion
Percentile 85: 7.5 billion
Percentile 90: 8 billion
Percentile 95: 9 billion
Percentile 99: 10 billion

**Median Estimate:** 4 billion units

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The specific market dynamics and adoption rate for Zepbound (tirzepatide) compared to historical precedents
- The potential for Zepbound (tirzepatide) to disrupt the diabetes treatment landscape and achieve blockbuster status
- The impact of competition, pricing, and other market factors on the global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide)

Remember, this is the OUTSIDE VIEW only. The next step will be to adjust this base distribution based on current events and other relevant information.
