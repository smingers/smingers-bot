**Reasoning:**

Step 1: Source Analysis
- The most recent information available is from Q3 2025, which showed Zepbound (tirzepatide) revenue of $3.6 billion. This is relatively recent, but does not cover the full Q4 2025 period.
- The sources seem credible, coming from reputable news outlets. However, there is a potential bias in the reporting, as it focuses on the Russian market and domestic analogs rather than the global Zepbound sales.
- The information on the Russian market is not directly relevant to the global revenue forecast, and is likely already priced into the base distribution.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
- Strong Evidence: None
- Moderate Evidence: None
- Weak Evidence: 
  - The Q3 2025 revenue of $3.6 billion for Zepbound, which suggests the full-year 2025 revenue may be in the range of $12-15 billion.
  - The growth of Russian domestic analogs, which could indicate increased competition and pricing pressure on Zepbound.

Step 3: Direction of Update
- The Q3 2025 revenue of $3.6 billion suggests the full-year 2025 revenue may be in the range of $12-15 billion, which would be lower than the base distribution.
- The growth of Russian domestic analogs could put some downward pressure on Zepbound's global revenue, but the overall impact is unclear.

Step 4: Integration
- Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Adjust lower by ~20% to account for the potentially lower full-year 2025 revenue.
- Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Adjust lower by ~10% to reflect the moderate downward pressure from the Russian analog competition.
- Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Adjust lower by ~5% to account for the overall uncertainty.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles seem reasonable and within the given bounds.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are not overly large compared to the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The percentiles are monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I have focused on the current situation, key actors, their incentives, and recent developments. The available evidence suggests that the Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide) may be slightly lower than the base distribution, but the overall impact is uncertain.

The Q3 2025 revenue of $3.6 billion provides a moderate indication that the full-year 2025 revenue may be in the range of $12-15 billion, which would be lower than the base distribution. Additionally, the growth of Russian domestic analogs could put some downward pressure on Zepbound's global revenue, but the overall impact is unclear.

Given the uncertainty and the lack of strong evidence, I have adjusted the distribution with a relatively modest downward shift, focusing on the lower and middle percentiles. The upper percentiles have been adjusted to a lesser degree to account for the overall uncertainty.

My final adjusted distribution reflects this reasoning, with a median estimate of 2.8 units and a confidence level of 5 out of 10.
