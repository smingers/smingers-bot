## Reasoning

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The available evidence is quite limited, as the most recent information is from Q3 2025, and the Q4 2025 results have not yet been reported. The search results come from credible news sources, but they do not provide a clear, comprehensive picture of the Q4 2025 revenue outlook for Zepbound (tirzepatide).

The key limitations are:
- Lack of up-to-date information on the actual Q4 2025 revenue results
- Limited analysis and forecasts for the Q4 2025 period specifically
- Potential biases or incomplete information in the available sources

Given the lack of direct evidence on the Q4 2025 revenue, the base distribution likely has not fully incorporated the latest information and trends.

### Step 2: Evidence Classification

The available evidence is mostly WEAK, as it consists of historical data and trends rather than explicit forecasts or projections for Q4 2025. There is no STRONG or MODERATE evidence that can be used to adjust the base distribution.

### Step 3: Direction of Update

Without any clear evidence pointing to a specific direction, I will not make any significant adjustments to the base distribution. The available information is too limited to confidently shift the distribution higher or lower.

### Step 4: Integration

Given the lack of strong evidence, I will make only minor adjustments to the base distribution:

- Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Slightly lower the lower bound to reflect some uncertainty, but maintain the overall shape.
- Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Make minimal changes to the middle range to avoid overly altering the base distribution without clear justification.
- Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Slightly lower the upper bound to reflect the uncertainty, but maintain a relatively wide distribution.

### Step 5: Sanity Checks

1. **Extremity check:** The adjusted 1st and 99th percentiles seem reasonable as bounds, given the lack of strong evidence.
2. **Base rate anchor:** The adjustments made are relatively minor and do not significantly deviate from the base distribution.
3. **Update magnitude:** The adjustments are proportional to the weak evidence available.
4. **Monotonicity:** The adjusted percentiles are monotonically increasing.

### Step 6: Final Reasoning

As a contrarian forecaster, my role is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. However, the available information is quite limited, and I do not have a strong basis to make significant adjustments to the base distribution.

The key issue is the lack of Q4 2025 revenue data and forecasts. Without this, it is difficult to assess whether the base distribution is overly optimistic or pessimistic. There may be factors that the consensus is overlooking, but without more evidence, I cannot confidently identify them.

My adjustments are relatively minor, as I do not want to introduce unnecessary uncertainty or bias into the forecast without a clear justification. I have slightly lowered the lower and upper bounds to reflect the overall uncertainty, but the core shape of the distribution remains largely unchanged.

In summary, due to the limited information available, I am unable to make substantial contrarian adjustments to the base distribution. I have maintained a cautious approach, making only minor changes to account for the uncertainty surrounding the Q4 2025 revenue outlook for Zepbound (tirzepatide).
