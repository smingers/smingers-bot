As a historian and superforecaster, I have carefully reviewed the available evidence to adjust the base distribution for the Q4 2025 global revenue of Zepbound (tirzepatide).

Step 1: Source Analysis
The information provided is limited, with the most recent data covering Q3 2025 results. There are no direct reports on the Q4 2025 revenue. The sources seem credible, but they do not provide a clear picture of the current situation. It is unclear if the base distribution already accounts for the available information.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
The evidence provided is mostly WEAK, consisting of historical trends and general market analysis. There are no STRONG or MODERATE evidence sources that would warrant significant adjustments to the base distribution.

Step 3: Direction of Update
Without clear forward-looking information, I cannot confidently determine the direction of the update. The historical trends suggest potential growth, but the lack of Q4 2025 data makes it difficult to quantify the magnitude of the update.

Step 4: Integration
Given the uncertainty, I have made relatively minor adjustments to the distribution:
- Lower percentiles (1, 5, 10): Slightly lowered to reflect potential downside risks, but maintaining a wide range.
- Middle percentiles (25, 50, 75): Slightly lowered to reflect the lack of clear positive evidence, but keeping the overall distribution centered around the base case.
- Upper percentiles (90, 95, 99): Slightly lowered to reflect the uncertainty, but maintaining a wide range to account for potential upside.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles remain reasonable bounds given the uncertainty.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are modest and do not deviate significantly from the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the weak evidence available.
4. Monotonicity: The percentiles are monotonically increasing.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian, I have focused on analyzing the available historical trends and patterns to inform my probability estimate. The lack of clear forward-looking information on the Q4 2025 revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide) makes it challenging to confidently adjust the base distribution. While the historical data suggests potential growth, the absence of a direct Q4 2025 revenue forecast creates uncertainty. Therefore, I have made relatively minor adjustments to the distribution to reflect this uncertainty, while maintaining a wide range to account for potential upside and downside scenarios.
