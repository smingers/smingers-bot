# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation - Numeric Question

## Question
What will be the reported Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide)?

## Description
Tirzepatide is a novel diabetes medication developed by Eli Lilly and Company. It has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is marketed under the brand name Zepbound. This question is asking for an estimate of the global revenue that Zepbound will generate in Q4 2025.

## Resolution Criteria
The final answer should be a probability distribution that represents the forecaster's best estimate of the Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound, based solely on historical precedent and reference classes, without adjusting for current events or news.

## Bounds
Lower bound: 0, Upper bound: 100

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question would be Eli Lilly's financial reporting, which includes quarterly and annual revenue figures for their various products. This data is generally reliable and comprehensive, as Eli Lilly is a publicly traded company with strict financial reporting requirements.

However, there may be some systematic biases in the data, as revenue figures can be influenced by factors such as pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and competition. Additionally, Zepbound is a relatively new product, so the historical data may be limited.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Diabetes Medications**
- Historical distribution: Diabetes medications have a wide range of global revenues, from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of dollars per year.
- Sample size: There are dozens of diabetes medications on the market, with varying levels of success.
- Suitability score: 7/10. Diabetes medications are a relevant reference class, but Zepbound is a novel product, so its performance may differ from existing drugs.
- Why this reference class: Diabetes medications are the most direct comparison for Zepbound, as it is a treatment for the same condition.

**Reference Class 2: Newly Launched Pharmaceutical Products**
- Historical distribution: Newly launched pharmaceutical products can have a wide range of global revenues, depending on factors such as the size of the target market, the product's efficacy, and the level of competition.
- Sample size: There are hundreds of newly launched pharmaceutical products each year, with varying levels of success.
- Suitability score: 6/10. Newly launched pharmaceutical products are a relevant reference class, but the performance of Zepbound may differ from other drugs due to its unique characteristics.
- Why this reference class: Zepbound is a newly launched product, so its performance may be more similar to other newly launched pharmaceuticals than to established diabetes medications.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable, as we have identified relevant reference classes.

### Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores, we can construct the following base distribution:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 10
Percentile 5: 50
Percentile 10: 100
Percentile 15: 200
Percentile 20: 300
Percentile 25: 400
Percentile 30: 500
Percentile 35: 600
Percentile 40: 700
Percentile 45: 800
Percentile 50: 900
Percentile 55: 1000
Percentile 60: 1100
Percentile 65: 1200
Percentile 70: 1300
Percentile 75: 1400
Percentile 80: 1500
Percentile 85: 1600
Percentile 90: 1700
Percentile 95: 1800
Percentile 99: 1900

**Median Estimate:** 900 units

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The performance of Zepbound relative to other diabetes medications and newly launched pharmaceutical products
- The size of the target market and the level of competition in the diabetes treatment space
- The potential impact of future regulatory changes or market dynamics on Zepbound's revenue

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

I have a moderate level of confidence (7/10) in this base distribution, as I have identified relevant reference classes and integrated them to create a reasonable estimate. However, the limited historical data on Zepbound specifically introduces some uncertainty, and the performance of newly launched pharmaceutical products can be highly variable.
