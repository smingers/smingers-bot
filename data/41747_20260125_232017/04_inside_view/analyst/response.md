Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
- The most relevant information is from January 2026, which is very recent and captures the latest developments.
- The sources (Tengrinews.kz and RBC) appear to be credible and reputable news outlets.
- There is no clear indication of biases in the reporting.
- The base distribution does not seem to fully capture the recent positive news about Zepbound's revenue performance, so an adjustment is warranted.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
- The reports on Q1-Q3 2025 revenue ($9.3B) and projected full-year 2025 company revenue ($63-$63.5B) are considered STRONG evidence, as they are based on multiple independent sources and have a clear causal mechanism (strong sales performance).
- There is no MODERATE or WEAK evidence identified.

Step 3: Direction of Update
- The STRONG evidence on revenue performance points HIGHER, as it suggests Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue is likely to be at least $4B, based on the Q3 trends and international expansion.
- This evidence does not indicate a need to WIDEN or NARROW the distribution, as it primarily affects the overall level of the distribution.

Step 4: Integration
- The lower percentiles (1, 5, 10) are adjusted HIGHER by a relatively larger amount (up to 150%) to reflect the strong Q1-Q3 2025 revenue and the likelihood of a robust Q4 performance.
- The middle percentiles (25, 50, 75) are adjusted HIGHER by a moderate amount (up to 50%) to capture the overall upward shift in the distribution.
- The upper percentiles (90, 95, 99) are adjusted HIGHER by a smaller amount (up to 15%) to maintain a reasonable range and avoid overly optimistic projections.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 20 and 1950, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds for the Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments made are proportional to the strong evidence on recent revenue performance and do not deviate significantly from the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the lower percentiles seeing a larger upward shift.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution maintains monotonicity, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the recent positive news on Zepbound's revenue performance provides strong evidence to adjust the base distribution upward. The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue of $9.3B and the projected full-year 2025 company revenue of $63-$63.5B suggest that Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue is likely to be at least $4B, based on the Q3 trends and international expansion. This information, which is not fully captured in the base distribution, warrants an upward adjustment, particularly in the lower and middle percentiles. I have high confidence in this adjustment, as the evidence is recent, credible, and directly relevant to the question.
