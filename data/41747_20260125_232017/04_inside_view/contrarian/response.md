As a contrarian forecaster, I do not see strong evidence to significantly adjust the base distribution for Zepbound's (tirzepatide) Q4 2025 global revenue. The available information is limited, as Eli Lilly has not yet reported the actual Q4 2025 results.

The key factors I considered are:

1. **Incomplete Information**: The news articles provided only cover revenue trends up to Q3 2025, with projections for the full year 2025. There is no definitive data on the actual Q4 2025 global revenue.

2. **Uncertainty around Pricing and Supply**: While the Q3 2025 revenue and full-year projections indicate strong performance, the Q4 revenue could be impacted by factors like pricing adjustments and availability of supply to meet demand.

3. **Potential Competitive Dynamics**: The news about increased sales of Russian analogs of similar drugs suggests potential competitive pressures that could affect Zepbound's Q4 performance, but the magnitude of this impact is unclear.

4. **Lack of Consensus Narrative**: The available evidence does not point to a clear consensus on the expected Q4 2025 revenue for Zepbound. This lack of a dominant narrative makes it difficult to confidently adjust the base distribution.

Given the limited and uncertain nature of the current information, I do not feel there is a strong basis to significantly shift the base distribution. I have made minor adjustments to the lower and upper percentiles to account for the possibility of slightly better or worse performance, but the overall distribution remains largely unchanged.

My role as a contrarian forecaster is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the lack of definitive data and the potential for unexpected competitive dynamics make me cautious about making bold adjustments to the base distribution. I believe it is prudent to wait for the actual Q4 2025 results before making more substantial changes.
