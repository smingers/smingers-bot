Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
- The most relevant information is from late 2025, which is quite recent and close to the Q4 2025 timeframe in question.
- The sources appear to be credible, including Eli Lilly's financial reporting and reputable news outlets.
- There does not appear to be significant bias in the reporting, as the information aligns with Eli Lilly's broader business performance.
- The base distribution does not fully capture the recent strong sales growth and international expansion of Zepbound, so an adjustment is warranted.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
- The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue data and projected full-year 2025 company revenue are considered STRONG evidence, as they come directly from Eli Lilly's financial reporting and indicate a clear positive trend.
- The information on expected continued international expansion, such as China coverage from January 2026, is also STRONG evidence, as it suggests further growth opportunities for Zepbound.

Step 3: Direction of Update
- The STRONG evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, as the recent sales growth and expansion plans indicate a positive outlook for Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue.
- The magnitude of the shift is approximately 10-20% higher across the distribution, as the evidence suggests continued strong performance but does not indicate an extreme outlier scenario.

Step 4: Integration
- For the lower percentiles (1, 5, 10), the shift is towards the higher end of the base distribution, as the historical precedents and patterns suggest a more optimistic outlook for Zepbound's performance.
- For the middle percentiles (25, 50, 75), the shift is also towards the higher end, reflecting the overall positive trend in the company's financial results and growth prospects.
- For the upper percentiles (90, 95, 99), the shift is more modest, as the base distribution already accounts for the possibility of strong performance, and the current evidence does not indicate an extremely high-end scenario.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The adjusted 1st and 99th percentiles of 50 and 2000, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds given the historical context and current evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are generally in line with the base distribution, with the median estimate increasing by 100 units, which is proportionate to the evidence.
3. Update magnitude: The 10-20% increase across the distribution is appropriate given the strength of the evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution maintains monotonicity, with each percentile value being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian and superforecaster, I believe the recent strong sales growth and international expansion plans for Zepbound (tirzepatide) provide a solid foundation for a higher probability estimate compared to the base distribution. The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue data and projected full-year 2025 company performance indicate that Zepbound is gaining significant traction in the market, and the expected expansion into new regions like China further supports a positive outlook. While historical precedents are important, the current evidence suggests that Zepbound may outperform past analogous situations, especially given the product's unique therapeutic profile and Eli Lilly's strong execution. Therefore, I have adjusted the distribution to reflect a higher probability of stronger Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound.
