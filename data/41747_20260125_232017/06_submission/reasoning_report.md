# Outside View (Base Distribution) Estimation - Numeric Question

## Question
What will be the reported Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide)?

## Description
Tirzepatide is a novel diabetes medication developed by Eli Lilly and Company. It has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is marketed under the brand name Zepbound. This question is asking for an estimate of the global revenue that Zepbound will generate in Q4 2025.

## Resolution Criteria
The final answer should be a probability distribution that represents the forecaster's best estimate of the Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound, based solely on historical precedent and reference classes, without adjusting for current events or news.

## Bounds
Lower bound: 0, Upper bound: 100

## Your Task

### Step 1: Source Analysis

The primary data source for this question would be Eli Lilly's financial reporting, which includes quarterly and annual revenue figures for their various products. This data is generally reliable and comprehensive, as Eli Lilly is a publicly traded company with strict financial reporting requirements.

However, there may be some systematic biases in the data, as revenue figures can be influenced by factors such as pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and competition. Additionally, Zepbound is a relatively new product, so the historical data may be limited.

### Step 2: Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Diabetes Medications**
- Historical distribution: Diabetes medications have a wide range of global revenues, from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of dollars per year.
- Sample size: There are dozens of diabetes medications on the market, with varying levels of success.
- Suitability score: 7/10. Diabetes medications are a relevant reference class, but Zepbound is a novel product, so its performance may differ from existing drugs.
- Why this reference class: Diabetes medications are the most direct comparison for Zepbound, as it is a treatment for the same condition.

**Reference Class 2: Newly Launched Pharmaceutical Products**
- Historical distribution: Newly launched pharmaceutical products can have a wide range of global revenues, depending on factors such as the size of the target market, the product's efficacy, and the level of competition.
- Sample size: There are hundreds of newly launched pharmaceutical products each year, with varying levels of success.
- Suitability score: 6/10. Newly launched pharmaceutical products are a relevant reference class, but the performance of Zepbound may differ from other drugs due to its unique characteristics.
- Why this reference class: Zepbound is a newly launched product, so its performance may be more similar to other newly launched pharmaceuticals than to established diabetes medications.

### Step 3: Fermi Estimation (if applicable)

Not applicable, as we have identified relevant reference classes.

### Step 4: Base Distribution Integration

Weighting the reference classes by their suitability scores, we can construct the following base distribution:

**Distribution:**
Percentile 1: 10
Percentile 5: 50
Percentile 10: 100
Percentile 15: 200
Percentile 20: 300
Percentile 25: 400
Percentile 30: 500
Percentile 35: 600
Percentile 40: 700
Percentile 45: 800
Percentile 50: 900
Percentile 55: 1000
Percentile 60: 1100
Percentile 65: 1200
Percentile 70: 1300
Percentile 75: 1400
Percentile 80: 1500
Percentile 85: 1600
Percentile 90: 1700
Percentile 95: 1800
Percentile 99: 1900

**Median Estimate:** 900 units

**Confidence Level:** 7/10

**Key Uncertainties:**
- The performance of Zepbound relative to other diabetes medications and newly launched pharmaceutical products
- The size of the target market and the level of competition in the diabetes treatment space
- The potential impact of future regulatory changes or market dynamics on Zepbound's revenue

### Step 5: Confidence Assessment

I have a moderate level of confidence (7/10) in this base distribution, as I have identified relevant reference classes and integrated them to create a reasonable estimate. However, the limited historical data on Zepbound specifically introduces some uncertainty, and the performance of newly launched pharmaceutical products can be highly variable.

**Prediction:** 95000.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Recent reports of strong Q1-Q3 2025 revenue for Zepbound ($9.3B) and projected full-year 2025 company revenue of $63-$63.5B, indicating robust Q4 performance.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: None.
- Net direction: HIGHER

Percentile 85: 1650
Percentile 90: 1750
Percentile 95: 1850
Percentile 99: 1950

**Median Estimate:** 950 units

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
- The most relevant information is from January 2026, which is very recent and captures the latest developments.
- The sources (Tengrinews.kz and RBC) appear to be credible and reputable news outlets.
- There is no clear indication of biases in the reporting.
- The base distribution does not seem to fully capture the recent positive news about Zepbound's revenue performance, so an adjustment is warranted.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
- The reports on Q1-Q3 2025 revenue ($9.3B) and projected full-year 2025 company revenue ($63-$63.5B) are considered STRONG evidence, as they are based on multiple independent sources and have a clear causal mechanism (strong sales performance).
- There is no MODERATE or WEAK evidence identified.

Step 3: Direction of Update
- The STRONG evidence on revenue performance points HIGHER, as it suggests Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue is likely to be at least $4B, based on the Q3 trends and international expansion.
- This evidence does not indicate a need to WIDEN or NARROW the distribution, as it primarily affects the overall level of the distribution.

Step 4: Integration
- The lower percentiles (1, 5, 10) are adjusted HIGHER by a relatively larger amount (up to 150%) to reflect the strong Q1-Q3 2025 revenue and the likelihood of a robust Q4 performance.
- The middle percentiles (25, 50, 75) are adjusted HIGHER by a moderate amount (up to 50%) to capture the overall upward shift in the distribution.
- The upper percentiles (90, 95, 99) are adjusted HIGHER by a smaller amount (up to 15%) to maintain a reasonable range and avoid overly optimistic projections.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The 1st and 99th percentiles of 20 and 1950, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds for the Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments made are proportional to the strong evidence on recent revenue performance and do not deviate significantly from the base distribution.
3. Update magnitude: The adjustments are proportional to the strength of the evidence, with the lower percentiles seeing a larger upward shift.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution maintains monotonicity, with each percentile being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a geopolitical analyst and superforecaster, I believe the recent positive news on Zepbound's revenue performance provides strong evidence to adjust the base distribution upward. The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue of $9.3B and the projected full-year 2025 company revenue of $63-$63.5B suggest that Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue is likely to be at least $4B, based on the Q3 trends and international expansion. This information, which is not fully captured in the base distribution, warrants an upward adjustment, particularly in the lower and middle percentiles. I have high confidence in this adjustment, as the evidence is recent, credible, and directly relevant to the question.

**Prediction:** 100000.0%
**Weight:** 1.0

**Reasoning:**
**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong evidence pointing HIGHER: Recent strong sales growth of Zepbound (tirzepatide) in Q1-Q3 2025, projected full-year 2025 company revenue, and expected continued international expansion.
- Strong evidence pointing LOWER: None.
- Net direction: HIGHER

Percentile 80: 1600
Percentile 85: 1700
Percentile 90: 1800
Percentile 95: 1900
Percentile 99: 2000

**Median Estimate:** 1000 units

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 8

Reasoning:

Step 1: Source Analysis
- The most relevant information is from late 2025, which is quite recent and close to the Q4 2025 timeframe in question.
- The sources appear to be credible, including Eli Lilly's financial reporting and reputable news outlets.
- There does not appear to be significant bias in the reporting, as the information aligns with Eli Lilly's broader business performance.
- The base distribution does not fully capture the recent strong sales growth and international expansion of Zepbound, so an adjustment is warranted.

Step 2: Evidence Classification
- The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue data and projected full-year 2025 company revenue are considered STRONG evidence, as they come directly from Eli Lilly's financial reporting and indicate a clear positive trend.
- The information on expected continued international expansion, such as China coverage from January 2026, is also STRONG evidence, as it suggests further growth opportunities for Zepbound.

Step 3: Direction of Update
- The STRONG evidence points to a HIGHER shift in the distribution, as the recent sales growth and expansion plans indicate a positive outlook for Zepbound's Q4 2025 global revenue.
- The magnitude of the shift is approximately 10-20% higher across the distribution, as the evidence suggests continued strong performance but does not indicate an extreme outlier scenario.

Step 4: Integration
- For the lower percentiles (1, 5, 10), the shift is towards the higher end of the base distribution, as the historical precedents and patterns suggest a more optimistic outlook for Zepbound's performance.
- For the middle percentiles (25, 50, 75), the shift is also towards the higher end, reflecting the overall positive trend in the company's financial results and growth prospects.
- For the upper percentiles (90, 95, 99), the shift is more modest, as the base distribution already accounts for the possibility of strong performance, and the current evidence does not indicate an extremely high-end scenario.

Step 5: Sanity Checks
1. Extremity check: The adjusted 1st and 99th percentiles of 50 and 2000, respectively, appear to be reasonable bounds given the historical context and current evidence.
2. Base rate anchor: The adjustments are generally in line with the base distribution, with the median estimate increasing by 100 units, which is proportionate to the evidence.
3. Update magnitude: The 10-20% increase across the distribution is appropriate given the strength of the evidence.
4. Monotonicity: The adjusted distribution maintains monotonicity, with each percentile value being greater than or equal to the previous one.

Step 6: Final Reasoning
As a historian and superforecaster, I believe the recent strong sales growth and international expansion plans for Zepbound (tirzepatide) provide a solid foundation for a higher probability estimate compared to the base distribution. The Q1-Q3 2025 revenue data and projected full-year 2025 company performance indicate that Zepbound is gaining significant traction in the market, and the expected expansion into new regions like China further supports a positive outlook. While historical precedents are important, the current evidence suggests that Zepbound may outperform past analogous situations, especially given the product's unique therapeutic profile and Eli Lilly's strong execution. Therefore, I have adjusted the distribution to reflect a higher probability of stronger Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound.

**Confidence in Adjustment:** 5

As a contrarian forecaster, I do not see strong evidence to significantly adjust the base distribution for Zepbound's (tirzepatide) Q4 2025 global revenue. The available information is limited, as Eli Lilly has not yet reported the actual Q4 2025 results.

The key factors I considered are:

1. **Incomplete Information**: The news articles provided only cover revenue trends up to Q3 2025, with projections for the full year 2025. There is no definitive data on the actual Q4 2025 global revenue.

2. **Uncertainty around Pricing and Supply**: While the Q3 2025 revenue and full-year projections indicate strong performance, the Q4 revenue could be impacted by factors like pricing adjustments and availability of supply to meet demand.

3. **Potential Competitive Dynamics**: The news about increased sales of Russian analogs of similar drugs suggests potential competitive pressures that could affect Zepbound's Q4 performance, but the magnitude of this impact is unclear.

4. **Lack of Consensus Narrative**: The available evidence does not point to a clear consensus on the expected Q4 2025 revenue for Zepbound. This lack of a dominant narrative makes it difficult to confidently adjust the base distribution.

Given the limited and uncertain nature of the current information, I do not feel there is a strong basis to significantly shift the base distribution. I have made minor adjustments to the lower and upper percentiles to account for the possibility of slightly better or worse performance, but the overall distribution remains largely unchanged.

My role as a contrarian forecaster is to challenge the obvious narrative and identify potential blind spots. In this case, the lack of definitive data and the potential for unexpected competitive dynamics make me cautious about making bold adjustments to the base distribution. I believe it is prudent to wait for the actual Q4 2025 results before making more substantial changes.
