Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**FRED Database (fred.stlouisfed.org):** Provides historical data series on Brazilian interest rates through December 2025. High-quality archival source but contains no forecasts or analysis. Most recent data is current as of January 2026.

**Global-rates.com:** General educational content about the Selic rate mechanism. No current data or forecasts. Background information only.

**Trading Economics (tradingeconomics.com):** Reports current Selic rate at 15.00% as of January 2026, with inflation projections of 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027. Contains forecast of 14.50% by end of Q1 2026. This is a reputable aggregator of economic data. The forecast aligns with consensus expectations.

**Valor International (January 26, 2026):** Most recent and highly relevant. Reports consensus survey of 120 institutions showing 85% (102 institutions) expect COPOM to begin easing at the **March 18, 2026 meeting**. Digital options market shows 81.5% probability of holding at 15% in January. Named expert opinions include:
- BTG Pactual/Mansueto Almeida: Expects January cut (minority view)
- Werther Vervloet (Ace Capital): Expects hold in January, March cut likely
- Secemski (Barclays): Projects 25bp cut starting in March
- Lima (Polo Capital): Baseline of consecutive 50bp cuts to 12% end-cycle

**Valor International (December 15, 2025):** Reports COPOM maintained hawkish tone with 96.6% similarity to previous statement. Options market showed 49% chance of January hold, with majority expectation for cuts pushed to March 2026. Bruno Imaizumi (4 Intelligence) and André Loes (Vivest) both forecast first cut in March, with potential to reach 12.5%.

**Valor International (July 28, 2025):** Historical context showing all 123 institutions expected 15% hold. Multiple forecasts for 2026:
- Cecilia Machado (Bocom BBM): Cuts begin March 2026, falling to 12% by year-end 2026
- Daniel Xavier (ABC Brasil): Cuts begin Q2 2026, to 11.75% by year-end
- Marcelo Fonseca (Reag Investimentos): First cut possibly December 2025

**Perplexity Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis showing:
- Selic path: 13.75% (Feb 2023) → 10.50% (Jun 2024) → 15.00% (Aug 2025-present)
- Focus Survey consensus (Jan 2026): First 50bp cut in March 2026, placing rate at 14.50%
- Inflation: IPCA 4.5% y/y (mid-Jan 2026), expectations 4.02% for 2026
- Two independent sources (NeoFeed, TradingView) confirm March 50bp cut consensus

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: Brazilian monetary policy cycles (2016-present)**
The BCB has demonstrated consistent patterns: gradual cuts of 25-50bp per meeting during easing cycles, with terminal rates typically reaching 6-9% in low-inflation environments and 12-13% in higher-inflation periods. The 2023-2024 easing cycle saw six consecutive 50bp cuts before reversal.

**Reference Class 2: Emerging market central bank responses to inflation overshoots**
When inflation runs 1-1.5pp above target (current situation: 4.5% vs 3% target), EM central banks typically maintain restrictive policy for 2-4 quarters before beginning gradual easing.

**Reference Class 3: Consensus forecasts for near-term central bank decisions**
When 85% of surveyed institutions agree on timing and magnitude of rate moves, historical accuracy is high (>80%) for 6-8 week forecasts.

**Selected Reference Class:** Reference Class 3 is most suitable given the strong consensus (85% agreement), short timeframe (7 weeks), and specific institutional forecasts with named economists.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

The March 2026 Copom meeting is scheduled for **March 18, 2026**, which is **49 days** from today (January 28, 2026). This is an extremely short forecast horizon.

**Historical patterns:**
- COPOM typically signals policy shifts 1-2 meetings in advance through statement language
- December 2025 statement maintained hawkish tone (96.6% similarity), but markets interpreted this as allowing for March easing
- January 2026 meeting (just occurred) held rates at 15% as expected by 81.5% of market
- Brazilian rate cycles show typical cut increments of 25bp or 50bp
- The 2023-2024 easing cycle featured six consecutive 50bp cuts before pausing

**Recent trajectory:**
- Peak rate: 15.00% (reached August 2025, held through January 2026)
- Duration at peak: 6 months by March meeting
- Inflation trajectory: 4.7% (Oct 2025) → 4.5% (Jan 2026), moving toward 4.0% target for 2026

**(d) Justification:**

The convergence of evidence strongly supports a 50bp cut at the March 18, 2026 meeting:

1. **Overwhelming consensus:** 85% of 120 surveyed institutions expect the March meeting to begin the easing cycle
2. **Multiple independent forecasts:** Trading Economics (14.50%), Focus Survey median (14.50%), and named economists from major institutions all project 50bp cut
3. **Inflation dynamics:** IPCA has declined from 4.7% to 4.5%, with expectations of 4.0% for full-year 2026, creating room for easing
4. **Policy duration:** Six months at 15% provides sufficient restrictive period
5. **Historical precedent:** BCB's previous easing cycle (2023-2024) began with 50bp cuts and continued that pace
6. **Market pricing:** Options markets and fixed-income yields reflect March easing expectations

**Risk factors:**
- Services inflation remains elevated (noted by multiple analysts)
- Labor market resilience could delay cuts
- Exchange rate volatility (though recent appreciation helps)
- 2026 election-year fiscal expansion concerns
- Minority view (BTG Pactual) argued for earlier cuts, suggesting some downside risk to the rate

**Base case:** 14.50% (50bp cut from 15.00%)
**Alternative scenarios:**
- Hold at 15.00%: ~10-15% probability (if inflation data deteriorates or external shocks)
- 25bp cut to 14.75%: ~5-10% probability (more cautious approach)
- 75bp cut to 14.25%: <5% probability (would require dramatic inflation improvement)

Outside view calibration:

The consensus forecast is remarkably strong (85% agreement) with a very short timeframe (49 days). Historical accuracy of such strong consensus forecasts for near-term central bank decisions is typically 75-85%.

The distribution should be:
- **Heavily concentrated around 14.50%** (50bp cut consensus)
- **Secondary mode at 15.00%** (hold scenario, ~10-15% probability)
- **Tertiary possibility at 14.75%** (25bp cut, ~5-10% probability)
- **Long tail toward lower rates** (larger cuts if dramatic improvement, <5%)
- **Minimal probability above 15.00%** (hiking would contradict all current guidance, <1%)

The 90/10 confidence interval should span roughly 14.25% to 15.00%, capturing:
- P10: Aggressive easing scenario (75bp cut or signal of accelerated cuts)
- P90: Hold scenario with hawkish messaging

However, given the extremely strong consensus and short timeframe, the distribution should be relatively tight. The main uncertainty is whether the cut is 0bp, 25bp, or 50bp, not whether rates will be dramatically different.

**Calibration considerations:**
1. Central bank decisions are discrete (multiples of 25bp), creating natural clustering
2. The question asks for the "target rate," which is the announced policy rate after the meeting
3. Historical BCB behavior shows preference for 50bp moves during cycles
4. Current messaging (holding "for a fairly prolonged period") suggests March as earliest cut date
5. No major data releases between now and March 18 that could dramatically shift outlook
