**Key Factual Information vs. Opinions:**
- **Facts**: Selic at 15% since August 2025; IPCA at 4.5%; Target 3% ±1.5pp; March 18, 2026 meeting date; 85% consensus for March cuts
- **Expert Opinions**: Cut magnitude varies (25bp vs 50bp); year-end targets range 11.5%-12.75%

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Overwhelming consensus timing**: 85% of 120+ institutions expect March 2026 as first cut (multiple independent sources: Valor surveys, AskNews compilation, Focus Bulletin)
2. **Inflation trajectory**: IPCA declining from 4.7% → 4.5%, with 2026 expectations at 4.0-4.4% (Central Bank data, multiple sources)
3. **Historical BCB behavior**: Previous easing cycles featured 50bp increments consistently (FRED data, institutional memory)
4. **Duration at peak**: Six months at 15% by March meeting provides "prolonged period" mentioned in COPOM statements (factual timeline)

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Options market pricing**: 81.5% probability of January hold, implying March action (Valor, market-based)
2. **Statement language evolution**: December COPOM removed some hawkish elements while maintaining caution (Valor analysis)
3. **Labor market/services inflation**: Remains resilient, creating caution (multiple analyst mentions)
4. **Election year 2026**: Potential fiscal expansion concerns (analyst commentary)

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Individual analyst speculation**: Specific year-end targets vary widely (11.5%-13.25%)
2. **Exchange rate movements**: Dollar at R$5.20, but volatile (short-term indicator)
3. **U.S. Fed policy**: Expected to hold, but indirect impact (external factor)

**Evidence Weight on Cut Magnitude:**
- **50bp cut (to 14.50%)**: XP, Polo Capital, historical precedent, Focus Survey median
- **25bp cut (to 14.75%)**: Santander, Itaú (more cautious institutions)
- **Hold at 15.00%**: Minority view, ~10-15% probability per options markets

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 49 days from January 28, 2026 to March 18, 2026 meeting.

**If timeframe halved (24-25 days)**: Would be asking about a mid-February rate, which doesn't exist (no meeting). If interpreted as "next meeting" being sooner, confidence in 15.00% hold would increase to ~95%, as insufficient time for data/conditions to change.

**If timeframe doubled (98 days, ~May 2026)**: Would encompass two meetings (March + May). Confidence in easing would approach 95%+, with debate shifting to whether rate reaches 14.00% (two 50bp cuts) or 14.25-14.50% (one 50bp + one 25bp, or two 25bp cuts). The May meeting would almost certainly see rates below 15%.

**Short timeframe implications**: 
- High confidence in directional forecast (cut vs. hold)
- Magnitude uncertainty remains (25bp vs 50bp)
- Very low probability of surprises (hikes, 75bp+ cuts)
- Central bank communication already largely determined

## (d) Justification for Distribution

**Base Rate Anchoring**: Outside view suggested 14.50% as modal outcome with ~75-85% confidence, secondary mode at 15.00% (~10-15%), and 14.75% as tertiary (~5-10%).

**Current Evidence Strengthens This View:**

1. **Consensus Strength (Strong Evidence)**: 85% agreement among 120+ institutions is exceptionally high for a 7-week forecast. Historical accuracy of such consensus approaches 80-85%. This supports tight distribution around 14.50%.

2. **Inflation Dynamics (Strong Evidence)**: IPCA declining from 4.7% to 4.5% with expectations of 4.0-4.4% for 2026 provides clear justification for easing. This is not speculative—it's measured data showing disinflation consistent with BCB's "prolonged period" strategy succeeding.

3. **Historical Pattern Match (Strong Evidence)**: The 2023-2024 BCB easing cycle began with 50bp cuts and maintained that pace. Current conditions (6 months at peak, inflation declining toward target) closely mirror the conditions that preceded that cycle. Reference class remains highly analogous.

4. **Institutional Behavior (Moderate Evidence)**: BCB under Galípolo has maintained credibility through data-dependent approach. December statement's 96.6% similarity to prior statement, while maintaining hawkish tone, is consistent with March pivot (not signaling too early).

**Factors Supporting 50bp over 25bp:**
- Focus Survey median explicitly shows 14.50% (not 14.75%)
- XP and other major institutions forecast 50bp
- Historical BCB preference for 50bp increments during cycles
- Sufficient disinflation progress to justify standard cut size

**Factors Supporting Hold Scenario (15.00%):**
- Services inflation remains elevated
- Labor market resilience
- Election year fiscal concerns
- Minority but credible analyst views (Société Générale: <50% March probability)

**Risk of Larger Cuts (14.25% or below):**
- Would require 75bp+ cut, unprecedented in recent cycles
- No analyst forecasts suggest this
- Would signal panic about growth, unsupported by data

**Distribution Calibration Logic:**

The question asks for the **target Selic rate** at March 2026 meeting. This is a discrete variable (multiples of 25bp), creating natural clustering.

Given 85% consensus for March cuts and strong preference for 50bp:
- **Modal outcome**: 14.50% (50bp cut) - assign ~70% probability
- **Secondary outcome**: 15.00% (hold) - assign ~20% probability  
- **Tertiary outcome**: 14.75% (25bp cut) - assign ~8% probability
- **Tail outcomes**: 14.25% or below - assign ~2% probability

**Percentile Mapping:**
- P1-P5: Aggressive easing tail (14.00-14.25%)
- P10-P60: Modal 50bp cut outcome (14.50%)
- P70-P85: Hold scenario (15.00%)
- P90-P99: Defensive hold with potential hawkish signal (15.00%)

The distribution is bimodal (14.50% and 15.00%) with heavy weight on 14.50%, reflecting the strong consensus but acknowledging meaningful hold probability.

## Probability Calibration

**Central Scenario (70% probability)**: COPOM cuts 50bp to 14.50% at March 18 meeting
- Inflation continues declining toward 4.0-4.2% range
- Labor market shows modest softening
- Exchange rate remains stable around R$5.0-5.3
- Services inflation moderates slightly
- Statement signals gradual easing cycle ahead

**Alternative Scenario 1 (20% probability)**: COPOM holds at 15.00%
- Services inflation remains sticky above 5%
- Labor market shows unexpected strength
- Exchange rate volatility increases (dollar above R$5.5)
- External shocks (U.S. policy changes, geopolitical events)
- Statement emphasizes need for additional data before easing

**Alternative Scenario 2 (8% probability)**: COPOM cuts 25bp to 14.75%
- Mixed inflation signals (headline improving, core sticky)
- Committee opts for more cautious initial cut
- Signals data-dependent approach for subsequent meetings
- Compromise between doves and hawks on committee

**Tail Scenario (2% probability)**: COPOM cuts 75bp+ to 14.25% or below
- Dramatic inflation collapse or growth scare
- Major external crisis requiring aggressive easing
- Highly unlikely given current data and no analyst forecasts

**Confidence Assessment**: 
The 49-day timeframe and 85% institutional consensus provide high confidence in the directional call (cut vs. hold). The main uncertainty is magnitude (25bp vs 50bp), which is a relatively small range (25bp = 0.25 percentage points). The distribution should be tight but not overconfident, acknowledging that central banks can surprise.

**Calibration Check**: 
- Implied median: 14.50%
- Implied mean: ~14.55% (weighted by probabilities: 0.70×14.50 + 0.20×15.00 + 0.08×14.75 + 0.02×14.25 = 14.57%)
- This makes sense: slightly above modal outcome due to hold scenario pulling mean up

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Selic rate (%) set by Copom at March 18, 2026 meeting (49 days away)

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 14.50% as modal outcome (~75% confidence), with 15.00% hold (~15%) and 14.75% cut (~10%) as alternatives. Current analysis strengthens this view.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 14.50%; mean = 14.57%; aligns with 70% probability on 50bp cut scenario and 20% on hold scenario.

4. **Key evidence**: (1) 85% institutional consensus for March cuts; (2) IPCA declining 4.7%→4.5%; (3) Historical BCB 50bp cut preference; (4) Six months at 15% peak; (5) Focus Survey median 14.50%

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected external shock (U.S. tariff escalation, emerging market crisis, domestic political crisis) could force hold at 15.00% or even trigger emergency inter-meeting hike. This would push outcome UP (toward 15.00% or above), but probability <5% given current stability.
