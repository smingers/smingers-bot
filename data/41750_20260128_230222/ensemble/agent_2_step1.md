**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Brazilian Copom cutting cycles (2016-2020, 2023-2024):** Previous easing episodes show typical 50bp cuts in early stages. The 2023-24 cycle saw six consecutive 50bp cuts (Aug 2023-Mar 2024) from 13.75% to 10.75%. Suitability: High - same institution, similar inflation dynamics, recent history.

2. **Emerging market central bank first cuts after tightening cycles:** Broader class but less specific to Brazil's institutional behavior. Suitability: Medium - adds context but less precise.

3. **Copom decisions following extended holds:** After maintaining 15% for 6 months (Aug 2025-Jan 2026), historical pattern suggests deliberate first move. Suitability: Medium-high - captures current positioning.

**Most suitable reference class:** Brazilian Copom cutting cycles (2016-2020, 2023-2024), particularly the recent 2023-24 episode, as it reflects current institutional practice, similar inflation environment, and recent policy patterns.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** March 2026 Copom meeting (scheduled March 18, 2026) = 49 days from today (2026-01-28).

**Historical patterns over similar 2-month periods:**

From the recent cycle:
- January 2024 → March 2024: Two 50bp cuts (11.75% → 10.75%)
- November 2023 → January 2024: Two 50bp cuts (12.25% → 11.25%)
- In the 2023-24 easing cycle, every meeting delivered a 50bp cut until the pause

From the tightening cycle:
- November 2024 → January 2025: Likely one meeting with continuation
- March 2025 → May 2025: Two meetings, both delivered cuts (1.00pp then 0.50pp)

**Key observation:** When Copom begins a directional move (either tightening or easing), it typically maintains momentum for multiple consecutive meetings. The 6-month hold (Aug 2025-Jan 2026) suggests the Committee has been waiting for conditions to justify a directional change.

**(d) Justification for Outside View:**

**Baseline from reference class:** The 2023-24 easing cycle provides a strong template. After a period of elevated rates, Copom initiated cuts with consistent 50bp moves. Current situation parallels this: Selic at 15% (peak), inflation declining but above target (4.5% vs 3% target), and policy clearly in restrictive territory.

**Market consensus convergence:** The January 26, 2026 Valor survey showing 85% of 120 institutions expecting a March cut represents exceptional consensus. This isn't speculative - it's informed by:
1. Copom's own inflation projections (3.2% by Q3 2027)
2. Improving inflation trajectory (4.5% y/y in Jan 2026 vs higher readings in 2025)
3. Six-month hold providing credibility for next move
4. Historical pattern of 50bp initial cuts

**Expert opinion alignment:** Every major named expert (BTG Pactual, Ace Capital, Barclays, Vivest, ABC Brasil) expects easing to begin by March or shortly after. The debate has shifted from "whether" to "exactly when" (March vs April).

**Institutional behavior:** Copom's December 2025 statement showed 96.6% similarity to October - the highest ever recorded. This extreme consistency suggests the Committee was deliberately maintaining optionality while conditions evolved. The lack of statement change in January 2026 (held at 15%) aligns with market interpretation that March is the likely inflection point.

**Quantitative anchor:** Focus Survey median of 14.50% for end-Q1 2026, combined with the March 18 meeting being the only Q1 meeting remaining, directly points to a 50bp cut from 15.00% to 14.50%.

**Risk factors:**
- Upside (higher rate): Unexpected inflation surge, fiscal deterioration, or external shock could delay cuts
- Downside (lower rate): Sharper economic slowdown could prompt larger cut, though institutional practice favors gradual 50bp moves
- Status quo (15%): Possible if January-March data deteriorates, but only 15-19% probability per options markets

**Base rate from historical volatility:** Brazilian Selic has averaged 13.85% (1999-2026) with high volatility (2% to 45% range). However, in the modern inflation-targeting era (post-2016), rates have been more stable, typically ranging 2-14.5%. The current 15% represents the high end of recent policy ranges.

Outside view calibration:

The overwhelming consensus (85% of institutions, multiple expert sources, Focus Survey median) points to 14.50% as the modal outcome. However, I must account for:

1. **Uncertainty in timing:** While March is consensus, there's ~15-20% probability of a hold (per options markets), which would keep the rate at 15.00%.

2. **Uncertainty in magnitude:** The consensus assumes 50bp, but Copom could opt for:
   - 25bp cut → 14.75%
   - 50bp cut → 14.50% (consensus)
   - 75bp cut → 14.25% (unlikely but possible if data weakens sharply)

3. **Historical cutting patterns:** The 2023-24 cycle showed consistent 50bp moves, supporting the 14.50% forecast. However, the May 2025 meeting saw only 25bp, showing Copom can vary pace.

4. **Distribution shape:** Given the binary nature of monetary policy (cut vs hold) and the discrete 25bp increments:
   - Strong clustering around 14.50% (50bp cut scenario)
   - Secondary cluster at 15.00% (hold scenario)
   - Smaller probabilities at 14.75% (25bp cut) and 14.25% (75bp cut)

5. **Tail risk considerations:**
   - Lower tail (aggressive easing): Very unlikely below 14.00% as this would require 100bp+ cut, unprecedented in modern Copom practice
   - Upper tail (continued hold or hike): Rates above 15.00% would require either a hold or additional tightening, contradicting all expert consensus and inflation trajectory

6. **Calibration to established distributions:** The Focus Survey provides a market-based anchor. Options markets showing 81.5% hold probability in January (which occurred) suggest similar instruments for March would show ~70-85% probability of a cut.

**Percentile construction logic:**
- 10th percentile: Should capture the "hold plus possible small hike" scenario = 15.00%
- 20th percentile: Transition between hold and small cut = 14.75%-14.85%
- 40th percentile: Just below consensus, capturing 25bp cut scenario = 14.50%-14.60%
- 60th percentile: Consensus 50bp cut = 14.50%
- 80th percentile: Slightly more aggressive cut = 14.25%-14.40%
- 90th percentile: Tail scenario of larger cuts = 14.00%-14.25%

Given the discrete 25bp nature of rate decisions and strong consensus, the distribution should be relatively tight but account for the ~15-20% hold probability and small chance of variation in cut size.
