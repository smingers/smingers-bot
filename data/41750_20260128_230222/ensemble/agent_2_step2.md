Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources (Pre-January 2026):**

1. **Valor International (Dec 23, 2025)** - High quality financial publication. Survey of 120 market participants showing 74% expect first cut in March or later; 81 respondents specifically predict March. Multiple named economists (UBS BB, Santander, Société Générale, Itaú, Adam Capital) provide detailed forecasts. Consensus: 12% by end-2026. **Factual basis: Survey data. Expert opinions clearly attributed.**

2. **Valor International (May 6, 2025)** - Shows earlier expectations for rate path. Median forecast dropped to 14.75% for end-2025. First cut expected in December 2025 (this did not materialize). **Historical context showing expectation evolution.**

3. **Valor International (July 28, 2025)** - All 123 institutions expected 15% hold. Multiple economists projected March 2026 as first cut timing. **Factual: Unanimous survey results. Expert opinions attributed.**

4. **MercoPress (Jan 28, 2026)** - Contains outdated projections from an older bulletin (references 10.5% current Selic, which is incorrect). **Low reliability for current forecast - appears to be misdated or using old data.**

**Current Context Sources (January 27-28, 2026):**

5. **Multiple Brazilian sources (Portal Contabeis, Agência Brasil, InfoMoney, R7, G1, Terra, Estadão)** - All published Jan 27-28, 2026. Unanimous expectation: Selic maintained at 15% in January 28 meeting. **Strong consensus on March 2026 as first cut timing.** Key facts:
   - IPCA-15 rose 0.20% in January, 12-month cumulative 4.50%
   - Focus Bulletin: Selic projected at 12.25% end-2026
   - 34 of 37 institutions surveyed expect March start (Projeções Broadcast)
   - XP: Five 0.50pp cuts starting March → 12.5% by end-2026
   - JP Morgan: Six 1.00pp cuts per quarter → 11.50% by end-2026
   - Itaú: 0.25pp cut in March → 12.25% by end-2026
   - Bradesco/Itaú: Inflation forecast 3.2% for relevant horizon (Q3 2027)

**Factual basis: Multiple independent surveys converging. Expert forecasts clearly attributed to named institutions.**

6. **UOL (Jan 27, 2026)** - Reports 80%+ market agents expect 15% hold in January, cuts delayed to March. **Corroborates consensus.**

7. **E-Investidor (Dec 10, 2025)** - Copom maintained 15% in December meeting, market shifted expectations from January to March 2026 for first cut. **Factual: Official Copom decision and market reaction.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent sources (10+ articles) confirm March 2026 as consensus start date for cuts** - All major Brazilian financial publications and surveys converge on this timing
- **Focus Bulletin (official BC survey) projects 12.25% end-2026** - This is the authoritative market consensus, unchanged for 5 consecutive weeks
- **Structural factor: Copom's December 2025 minutes emphasized "prolonged period" at 15%** - Clear forward guidance against immediate cuts
- **Institutional forecasts show tight clustering:** Most major banks (XP, Itaú, Santander, BTG) expect March start with 25-50bp initial cut

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Inflation trending down but still elevated:** IPCA-15 at 4.50% (12-month), within tolerance but above 3% target
- **Economic activity showing gradual deceleration** - Supports case for easing but not urgent
- **Labor market remains tight** - Constrains aggressive easing
- **2026 election year concerns** - Fiscal expansion risk may limit cut depth
- **Exchange rate stabilization around R$5.20** - Reduces external pressure

**Weak Evidence:**
- **One dissenting view (Adam Capital's Cecílio) expects no cuts in 2026** - Outlier position, minimal market support
- **Variation in cut magnitude forecasts (25bp vs 50bp)** - Shows uncertainty about pace, not timing

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** March 2026 Copom meeting is approximately 5-6 weeks from today (January 28, 2026). Copom meets every 45 days, so the next meeting after January 28 is mid-March 2026.

**If timeframe halved (2-3 weeks):** Would be asking about February meeting, which doesn't exist. The January 28 decision just happened - market unanimously expected 15% hold. No possibility of cut before March.

**If timeframe doubled (10-12 weeks):** Would be asking about May 2026 meeting. By then, multiple cuts could have occurred. If March cut happens (50bp), May could see another 50bp cut to 13.5-14.0%. Distribution would shift significantly lower with wider uncertainty.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Adjustment:**
The outside view established 14.50% as the median (60th percentile), representing a 50bp cut from 15%. This aligns strongly with:

1. **Consensus convergence:** 81 of 120 respondents in December survey specifically named March for first cut
2. **Institutional forecasts:** XP (50bp cuts starting March), Santander (25bp in March after shifting from January), Itaú (25bp in March)
3. **Historical pattern:** Brazilian easing cycles typically begin with 25-50bp moves, not larger jumps
4. **Forward guidance:** Copom's December language ("prolonged period") ruled out January but left March open

**Key shifts from outside view:**
- **Tightening confidence intervals:** The convergence of independent sources (surveys, institutional forecasts, official guidance) reduces uncertainty. The 10th-90th percentile range of 14.00-15.00% captures realistic scenarios:
  - 15.00% (10-20% probability): No cut in March due to inflation surprise or external shock
  - 14.75% (20-30% probability): Conservative 25bp cut (Itaú scenario)
  - 14.50% (40-50% probability): Standard 50bp cut (XP, consensus scenario)
  - 14.25-14.00% (5-10% probability): Aggressive 75-100bp cut (unlikely given Copom's gradualism)

**Factors rendering reference class highly analogous:**
- Current cycle mirrors 2022-2024 pattern: prolonged hold at peak, gradual easing with clear signaling
- Inflation dynamics similar: above target but within tolerance, trending down
- External environment stable: No major shocks expected in 5-week window
- Institutional continuity: Same Copom structure and communication style

**Probability Calibration:**

Given the overwhelming consensus and clear forward guidance, I'm calibrating a tight distribution centered on 14.50%:

- **Modal outcome (14.50%):** 50bp cut represents market consensus, Focus Bulletin projection, and typical Copom gradualism
- **Conservative scenario (14.75%):** 25bp cut if Copom opts for extra caution (Itaú's view, ~25% probability)
- **Status quo (15.00%):** No cut if unexpected inflation data or external shock emerges (~15% probability)
- **Aggressive scenario (14.00-14.25%):** Larger cut if disinflation accelerates dramatically (~5% probability)

The distribution is intentionally asymmetric, with more probability mass on the downside (cuts) than upside (holds), reflecting the strong directional consensus while acknowledging execution uncertainty.

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable:** Selic rate (%) at March 2026 Copom meeting, approximately 5-6 weeks from now
   ✓ Analysis focuses precisely on this meeting and rate level

2. **Base rate:** Outside view median of 14.50% (50bp cut from 15%)
   ✓ Final prediction maintains this as central tendency, rooted in consensus surveys and institutional forecasts

3. **Consistency check:** 
   Implied median = 14.50%; mean ≈ 14.48% (slightly below median due to left tail from aggressive cut scenarios). Makes sense - reflects strong consensus for 50bp cut with slight probability of larger move.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Focus Bulletin: 12.25% end-2026 projection (unchanged 5 weeks) → implies March start
   - 81/120 market participants specifically named March in December survey
   - Multiple major banks (XP, Santander, Itaú) converged on March timing after January ruled out
   - Copom December minutes: "prolonged period" language consistent with March start, not January
   - IPCA-15 at 4.50% (within tolerance) supports gradual easing case

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** 
   Unexpected inflation spike in February data (released before March meeting) could force Copom to delay cuts, pushing outcome to 15.00%. This would make my 14.50% median look overconfident. However, given only 5-6 week window and current disinflation trend, probability is low (~15%).
