Analysis:
I reviewed several sources. The historical FRED data and related series tell us little about forecasts, but provide a robust reference class from Brazil’s long-term Selic series. Global Rates and Trading Economics articles offer descriptions of the mechanics and key levels; however, only the trading articles (especially Valor International and Trading Economics) give us actionable forward guidance. For example, Trading Economics identifies the current January 2026 rate as 15.00%, and several surveys (Valor International poll of institutions, Bloomberg/BCB Focus Survey as reported by NeoFeed and TradingView) now converge on the expectation that COPOM will begin easing in March 2026 by cutting by 50 basis points. In addition, expert opinions from BTG Pactual, Ace Capital, and 4 Intelligence all recognize that a trend reversal has been signaled by both the selector of moderation in COPOM language and market pricing. Meanwhile, a few dissenters mention the possibility of a more modest (25 bp) move or even delay, but these are in the minority.

The reference class analysis compares past episodes of similarly constrained monetary cycles. Recent history shows an easing cycle where cuts are modest and well signaled, with a median track commonly near a 50‐bp adjustment rather than a quick reversal. Given the consensus point of ~14.50% for March 2026 and consistent prior experience of gradual adjustments in Brazil’s interest rate cycle, this seems like the most apt reference class.

Timeframe: With today’s date being January 28, 2026, the March 2026 meeting is roughly one to two months away. Historical evidence on March decisions (in cycles of recent easing) shows that the typical magnitude of the first cut—especially in an environment where the central bank has been holding at 15%—is around 50 basis points. Market surveys now indicate a near‐majority expectation for a 50-bp move.

Justification:
All considered evidence—including market expectations, consensus survey results, and reputable economists’ assessments—point to the likelihood of a modest easing beginning in March 2026. Although a few sources allow for the possibility of a smaller adjustment, the central consensus is centered around a 50 bp cut from 15.00% to 14.50%. In setting a quantitative forecast distribution, we need to recognize that there is a non-negligible probability of either a smaller or postponed cut (thus preserving the current 15.00%) as well as a slightly more aggressive easing in a context of unexpectedly moderating inflation pressures. I am therefore constructing an uncertainty distribution that has its bulk around 14.50% while allowing for tails that extend as high as 15.00% and as low as 14.00%.

Outside view calibration:
(a) The median of published surveys and consensus is for a 50-bp cut (from 15.00% to 14.50%).
(b) I tether this forecast to historical moderations in Brazil’s monetary policy cycles where initial cuts are gentle and preset.
(c) Recognizing the possibility of an upset (e.g., if new inflation data or communication shifts occur), I allow for the distribution to span from a modest 25-bp move (resulting in 14.75%) down to a slightly deeper cut (possibly reaching 14.00%).
(d) The rate of unexpected outcomes in central bank decisions is low but not zero; therefore I set wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns, ensuring that the tails of the forecast are reasonably wide.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 14.00
Percentile 20: 14.25
Percentile 40: 14.40
Percentile 60: 14.50
Percentile 80: 14.75
Percentile 90: 15.00
