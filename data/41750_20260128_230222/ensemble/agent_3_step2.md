Analysis:
We are asked to forecast the target Selic rate (in percent) that Copom will set at its March 2026 meeting. Today’s date is January 28, 2026, so we have about 49 days until the policy outcome is known. Several high‐quality news articles and analyst surveys (from Valor International, InfoMoney, Agência Brasil, globo.com, and others) all emphasize that while the January 28 meeting held the Selic at 15%, almost all reliable expert opinions now expect the first rate cut to occur in March. The most common view is a 50‐basis point reduction—from 15.00% to 14.50%—with a few variations (some forecasting only a 25‐bp cut to 14.75% or – on rare occasions – an even more aggressive move to 14.25%) while a small minority still expect no immediate change.

(a) Source analysis:
– Several sources (Valor International, InfoMoney, Estadão, Terra, globo.com) are very recent (January 27–28, 2026) and include surveys covering over 120 market participants. They report that roughly 80–85% expect the first cut to start in March, with the new rate most often forecast to be 14.50% (a 50‐bp cut). These are high‐quality, expert‐based opinions.
– Historical articles (e.g., from July 2025) provide context from earlier tightening and easing cycles. Their reference to previous 50‐bp moves when conditions warranted lends additional weight.
– Most factual information (current Selic at 15%; inflation around 4.5% vs a 3% target; the Copom’s conservative stance, the Focus Survey median of 14.50% for the imminent cut) is well aligned.
– Opinions (from named experts at BTG Pactual, Santander, ABC Brasil, etc.) clearly support a March rate cut of 50bp, while on rare occasions a 25 bp cut or even a hold are mentioned.

(b) Evidence analysis:
Strong evidence:
 • Multiple independent, high‐quality sources (Valor, Estadão, globo.com) clearly show market consensus for a March cut.
 • Historical patterns from previous easing cycles (with typical 50‐bp moves) support a similar outcome.
 • The Focus survey median is nearly 14.50%, which is consistent with many expert views.
Moderate evidence:
 • Some analysts mention the possibility of a smaller (e.g., 25‐bp, to 14.75%) or more aggressive (75 bp to 14.25%) move, but these are outliers.
Weak evidence:
 • Anecdotal commentary about minor textual shifts in communication affects probability only slightly.
Thus, the weight of evidence pushes our forecast toward a 50‐bp cut yielding a target rate of approximately 14.50%. A nonzero probability is given for either no cut (15.00%) or a mildly different move.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
We are forecasting the Selic rate set at the March 2026 meeting (about 49 days from now). If the timeframe were halved (e.g., for the January meeting), the evidence already shows a hold at 15.00%. If doubled (e.g., by mid‐2026), we would expect further cuts. Hence, the March forecast lies between the January hold and the later year‐end median (around 12.25% per Focus). Our forecast is then specific to that first cut in the easing cycle.

(d) Justification:
• The current market consensus—with over 80% of surveyed experts expecting the first cut in March—strongly motivates the baseline move from 15.00% to 14.50%.
• Historical precedent indicates that once the cut cycle begins, a 50‐bp move is typical.
• The November–December minutes, the elevated current rate, and the persistent but declining inflation (still above 3% target) all support a cautious easing of exactly 50bps.
• The room for smaller (25bp) or larger (75bp) moves exists, but their probability is lower.
• Structural factors (such as the need to anchor inflation expectations and the steady pace of 25–50bp moves in previous cycles) support a narrow distribution mostly around 14.50%.

Probability calibration:
Combining the strong convergence in expert opinion and historical patterns, our inside view prediction yields a median forecast of 14.50% at the March 2026 meeting. However, there is a small chance (roughly 15–20%) that conditions might yield either no change (holding at 15.00%) or a slightly different cut size (an outcome around 14.75% or even an aggressive cut to 14.25%). Our distribution reflects these tails without predicting a drastic move, since the institutional behavior and current economic signals are clear.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Selic rate in percent set by Copom at the March 2026 meeting.
2. Outside view base rate: Historical cutting cycles where the first move was typically 50bp from a hold.
3. Consistency: Implied median = 14.50%; mean roughly similar. This aligns with our justification.
4. Key evidence:
 • High consensus from recent surveys pointing to March as the debut cut.
 • Historical pattern of 50bp adjustments.
 • Current inflation and economic signals.
5. Blind-spot: A sudden unexpected economic shock or fiscal deterioration that might force the committee to hold (or even hike) rather than cut rates; this would push the outcome upward toward 15.00%—a scenario we assign to the extreme upper tail.
