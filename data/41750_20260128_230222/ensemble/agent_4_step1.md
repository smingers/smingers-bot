Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. TradingEconomics page (updated Jan-2026).  Factual: Selic currently 15 percent; committee language emphasises “prolonged hold”.  Also provides model-based forecast (14.50 percent end-Q1-26).  Source is timely, data-driven and historically reliable.  
2. Valor International 26-Jan-2026 article.  Poll of 120 institutions + options-market probabilities.  85 percent of surveyed desks expect the first cut in March (mostly 25 bp or 50 bp).  Credible: named analysts, clear separation of fact (survey numbers) and opinion (economists’ views).  
3. Valor International 15-Dec-2025 article.  Shows how a persistently hawkish statement pushed consensus for the first cut to March-26.  Slightly older but still relevant for establishing the base case of “March = start of easing”.  
4. FRED landing page.  Purely historical data; no forward-looking information.  Quality high but not directly useful for the forecast horizon.  
5. Agent_report (compiled chronology + Focus survey excerpts).  Uses multiple primary sources (Agência Brasil communiqués, Focus survey) to reconstruct policy path and consensus.  I accept it as a concise secondary synthesis; underlying numbers cross-check with items 1 & 2.  

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Immediate past three tightening cycles in Brazil (2014-16, 2021-23, 2024-25).  
• First cut after a peak in other large EM inflation-targeters (Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia).  
Suitability: Brazil-specific cycles dominate because (i) the BCB meets only eight times per year, (ii) it often starts easing with a 50 bp step, and (iii) political/fiscal backdrop is idiosyncratic.  I therefore use “first cut after a Brazilian hiking cycle” as the main reference class.  In the last three cycles, the first cut size distribution was: 25 bp (1×), 50 bp (1×), 100 bp (1×).  Median = 50 bp.  

c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → 18 Mar 2026 Copom = 50 days.  In that span no CPI release can radically re-anchor expectations (Feb IPCA-15 on 11 Mar will be the last print).  Historically, Copom has rarely reversed guidance within two months unless a shock occurs.  Hence inertia (“status-quo”) still commands a material probability.  

d) Justification for outside view  
Base rate: 0 bp move (hold at 15 percent) = 50 percent, 50 bp cut = 33 percent, 25 bp cut = 10 percent, ≥75 bp cut or a hike = 7 percent.  
Adjustments from current information:  
• Markets/Focus survey give roughly 2:1 odds in favour of a cut vs hold.  That tilts weight to 50 bp and 25 bp outcomes.  
• Size: Copom prefers 50 bp increments when beginning or proceeding with an easing cycle (see 2023-24).  
• Political/fiscal noise ahead of October 2026 municipal elections argues for caution, keeping some mass on “no move”.  
• Tail-risk: external shock (Fed re-tightening, commodity spike) could force a hold or even a hike; conversely, a sudden disinflation print could open room for a 75 bp–100 bp cut, but both tails are low-probability (~5 percent combined).  

Outside view calibration:

I model a discrete mixture and translate it to percentiles of a quasi-continuous CDF:

• 15.25 % (one 25 bp hike) – 5 %  
• 15.00 % (hold) – 25 % cumulative  
• 14.75 % (25 bp cut) – 15 % → 40 % cumulative  
• 14.50 % (50 bp cut) – 45 % → 85 % cumulative  
• 14.25 % (75 bp cut) – 10 % → 95 % cumulative  
• 13.75 % (125 bp cut) – 5 % → 100 % cumulative  

Mapped to required percentiles (ascending order):

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 13.75  
Percentile 20: 14.25  
Percentile 40: 14.50  
Percentile 60: 14.75  
Percentile 80: 15.00  
Percentile 90: 15.25
