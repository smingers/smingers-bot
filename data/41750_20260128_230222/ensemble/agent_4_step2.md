Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, key factual nuggets vs. opinion)

a. Valor Internacional 23-Dec-2025: survey of 120 institutions (factual) shows 74 % expect first cut in March; end-2026 consensus 12 %.  Opinions from named economists (UBS BB, Santander, SocGen, Itaú) mostly favour March/April start, size 25–50 bp.  Recent, high-quality, multi-sourced – strong weight.

b. Valor Internacional 28-Jan-2026: Focus survey points to Selic 12.25 % end-2026; “most” expect March launch.  Purely survey data (factual) and analyst upgrades (opinion).  Current and reliable – strong.

c. Bundle of 8 Brazilian media pieces (27-28 Jan-2026, Estadão, InfoMoney, Agência Brasil, etc.): all report that January meeting is expected to hold at 15 % and that 80-90 % of surveyed desks look for a March cut, with split on size (XP 50 bp, Itaú 25 bp, JP Morgan 100 bp quarterly).  Cross-confirming, independent – strong.

d. MercoPress 28-Jan-2026 Focus bulletin: lists 2026 Selic median 9 %.  Quality fair (aggregates Focus), but underlying data one week old.  Still useful trend evidence – moderate.

e. Earlier Valor pieces (Jul & May-2025) plus B3 option data Aug-Sep-2025: show prior cycles and Copom’s preference for 50 bp steps when easing.  Historical, good quality – moderate.

No material foreign-currency articles mention Brazil; ignored.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong evidence
• Five independent surveys (Focus, Valor, Broadcast, B3 options) all put probability of first cut in March above 70 %.  
• Brazilian easing cycles (2016, 2020, 2023) started with a 50 bp move in two of three cases; committee composition unchanged since 2025 – structural.

Moderate evidence  
• Inflation expectations for relevant horizon (Q3-2027) at 3.2 % vs. 3 % target – close, gives Copom some leeway but not a green light.  
• Political/fiscal risk in an election year → argues for caution (hold or 25 bp).

Weak evidence  
• Single outlier views (Adam Capital: no cuts in 2026; XP: rapid 250 bp pace).  
• Exchange-rate volatility ahead of March – too early to call.

3. Time-frame analysis  
Decision in about 50 days.  If horizon were halved (25 days) probability of “no move” rises because less new inflation data; if doubled (100 days) odds would swing further toward larger cuts.

4. Justification for shifting base rate

Outside-view base (first cut after Brazilian hiking cycle):  
Hold 50 %, 25 bp cut 15 %, 50 bp cut 33 %, ≥75 bp 2 %.

Inside-view adjustments  
+25 pp to “some cut” given overwhelming survey consensus and improving inflation expectations.  
–10 pp to ≥75 bp given Copom’s demonstrated caution, still-elevated core inflation, and reduced quorum.  
Remainder distributed to 25 bp vs. 50 bp with tilt to 50 bp because 1) historical modal step, 2) verbal guidance signals “resilience weakening but inflation still high”.

Resulting subjective probabilities  
Hold 25 %  
25 bp cut (14.75 %) 25 %  
50 bp cut (14.50 %) 40 %  
75 bp cut (14.25 %) 5 %  
≥100 bp cut (≤14.00 %) 2 %  
Hike (≥15.25 %) 3 %

Probability calibration
Implied median ≈14.60 %; mean ≈14.65 %.  Matches justification: most mass between 14.50 % and 15 %, modest lower tail.

Checklist (abridged)

1. Target: Selic (%) set by Copom at March 2026 meeting.  
2. Outside base stated above.  
3. Implied median 14.60 %, mean 14.65 % – reasonable vs. factors.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 70-90 % of surveys see March cut; (ii) Copom historically starts with 50 bp; (iii) Inflation expectations ~3.2 %; (iv) Election-year fiscal risk keeps caution.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden disinflation shock (e.g., commodity collapse) before March could force a larger 75–100 bp cut – would push rate lower.
