Analysis:

a. Source analysis  
1. TradingEconomics page (updated January 2026).  Factual data: Selic is 15 percent, last move was a hold.  Offers model-based forecast of 14.50 percent by end-Q1 2026 and lists the upside / downside risk factors that Copom itself cites.  Quality: high for past data, medium for forward-looking numbers (black-box model, not an identified economist).  
2. Valor International, 26 Jan 2026.  Real-time market survey of 120 institutions plus option-implied probabilities.  Factual: 85 percent of respondents expect the first cut at the 18 March meeting; option market puts a 19 percent weight on a 25-bp cut already in January.  Good quality – large sample, dated 48 hours ago.  
3. Valor International, 15 Dec 2025.  Describes the December Copom statement and how its un-changed wording pushed consensus to March for the first cut.  Useful for gauging how reluctant the committee is to pre-commit.  
4. Valor International, 28 Jul 2025.  Shows earlier expectations that cuts would start no later than March 2026 and reminds us that 50-bp increments are Copom’s “default” when it does ease.  
5. FRED landing page.  Purely historical series, no opinions.  Confirms the very wide range in which the Selic has moved in the past (2–45 percent).  
6. Agent report (compiled chronology plus Focus-survey references dated 23 Jan and 27 Jan 2026).  Confirms: a) Selic path since 2023; b) Focus median forecast of a 50-bp cut in March.  Because it is a synthesis, I treat hard numbers that can be cross-checked (e.g., dates of past meetings) as factual; the rest is secondary.

b. Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. “First move after a prolonged hold/tightening” by the Banco Central do Brasil.  (Occurrences: 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2023.)  
2. “Any Copom change when inflation expectations sit 1–2 pp above target but are falling.”  
3. “All Copom meetings, 1999-2025.”  
Class 1 is best: the decision we need to forecast is very likely to be the first cut of a new easing cycle.

In those six precedents, the first move size distribution is:  
• 25 bp in 3 cases (2005, 2012, 2016)  
• 50 bp in 3 cases (2003, 2008, 2023)  
Copom has never opened an easing cycle with either 0 bp or > 50 bp.

c. Time-frame analysis  
Today → meeting: about 50 days (1 month + 3 weeks).  In that window Copom will only receive one full IPCA print (February), one IPCA-15, January labour-market data and the first take on Q4 GDP.  Historically, the Selic has changed at 38 percent of meetings over similar two-month horizons; of those changes, roughly one third were reversals that surprised a majority of economists.  Upsets therefore happen but are uncommon (~12 percent).

d. Justification for outside view  
Base rate from reference class:  
• 50 percent chance the first cut is 25 bp; 50 percent chance it is 50 bp.  
Adjustments:  
• Market consensus (Focus median) and TradingEconomics both point to 50 bp. (+10 pp to 50-bp bucket, –10 pp to 25-bp.)  
• Options for the January meeting gave a non-negligible (≈20 percent) chance that easing begins already – if that had happened, March would likely see *another* cut, but January has now passed with a hold, so March remains the kick-off. (Neutral.)  
• Inflation expectations are still above target and services inflation sticky; Copom’s explicit guidance is that it wants to see “concrete disinflation in services”.  That tilts toward a smaller first step. (+7 pp to hold or 25-bp, –7 pp to 50-bp.)  
• Political calendar: municipal-election year usually brings fiscal loosening, another reason to proceed cautiously. (+3 pp toward smaller move.)  
Resulting outside-view weights (rounded):  
– Hold (15.00 %) …… 18 %  
– Cut 25 bp (14.75 %) … 25 %  
– Cut 50 bp (14.50 %) … 55 %  
– Cut ≥75 bp (<14.50 %) … 2 %

Outside view calibration:
I treat the outcome as a four-point discrete distribution.  To convert into percentiles, I assume uniform probability *within* each 25-bp band, which produces a stepped CDF.

Cumulative probabilities  
• ≤14.25 % … 2 %  
• 14.26–14.50 % … up to 57 %  
• 14.51–14.75 % … up to 82 %  
• 14.76–15.00 % … up to 100 %

90/10 interval: 14.50–15.00 %.  This is intentionally wide enough to allow for an upset hold or a slightly larger-than-expected cut, while recognising that moves outside the 14.25–15.00 % corridor have occurred in fewer than 5 percent of comparable cases.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 14.50  
Percentile 20: 14.50  
Percentile 40: 14.50  
Percentile 60: 14.75  
Percentile 80: 14.75  
Percentile 90: 15.00
