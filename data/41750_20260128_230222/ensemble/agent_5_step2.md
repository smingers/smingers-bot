Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, † = opinion):
   • Valor, 23 Dec 2025 – Survey of 120 institutions; 74 % see first cut in March; end-2026 median 12 %.  Recent, large sample → high quality.†  
   • Valor, 28 Jan 2026 – Focus survey shows end-2026 12.25 %; equities already pricing March cut. High quality, almost real-time data.†  
   • InfoMoney, 28 Jan 2026 – Quotes XP, JP Morgan, Itaú. XP sees five 50 bp cuts (14.50 % in Mar); Itaú sees 25 bp (14.75 %). Identifiable experts → moderate quality.†  
   • Estadão, 27 Jan 2026 – Broadcast survey: 34 of 37 houses expect March cut; size not specified. High quality poll.  
   • Central-bank Focus Bulletin, 26 Jan 2026 – Median path embedded in several articles: 50 bp cut pencilled in for March. Official survey → high quality.  
   • MercoPress, 28 Jan 2026 – Says Selic is 10.5 %; contradicts all Brazilian sources → low quality, discarded.  
   • All January 27-28 pre-decision articles (G1, R7, Terra, UOL) agree: hold at 15 % now, cuts likely from March. Multiple independent reports → strong corroboration.  
   • Historical database (BCB/FRED) – Shows first-cut sizes since 1999; factual.

2. Evidence weighting
   Strong:  
     – Six historical easing cycles: first move always 25 bp or 50 bp.  
     – 34/37 Broadcast houses + Focus median project March start.  
     – Copom has signalled “restrictive for prolonged period” but never ruled out Q1 easing.  
   Moderate:  
     – XP (50 bp) vs Itaú (25 bp) split on pace.  
     – Sticky services inflation and tight labour market argue for caution.  
   Weak:  
     – Options market prices two weeks old; volatile.  
     – MercoPress outlier.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   Days until meeting: 50.  If horizon were halved (25 d) little macro data would change → probabilities scarcely move.  If doubled (100 d) two additional CPI prints & GDP data could push Copom toward faster easing, raising weight on 50 bp+ cuts by ~10 pp.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view base (first cut after long hold): 50 bp 50 %, 25 bp 50 %.  
   Adjustments:  
     +10 pp to 50 bp – Focus median & majority of sell-side houses.  
     −7 pp from 50 bp / +7 pp to 25 bp – Copom rhetoric, services CPI, election-year fiscal risk.  
     +3 pp to “hold” – Reduced quorum, desire to see more data.  
     Residual 2 pp allocated to ≥75 bp cut.  
   Final weights: 14.50 % (50 bp) 49 %; 14.75 % (25 bp) 27 %; 15.00 % (hold) 18 %; 14.25 % 5 %; 14.00 % 1 %.

Probability calibration

Mean ≈14.63 %; median 14.50 %.  Distribution has fat upper tail reflecting possibility of no cut.

Checklist:
1. Target: Selic rate set by Copom on 18-19 Mar 2026, percent per year.  
2. Base-rate stated above.  
3. Implied median 14.50 %, mean 14.63 % – consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) Focus survey 50 bp cut, b) Broadcast poll (34/37 expect March cut), c) Historical first-cut size limited to 25-50 bp, d) Copom hawkish language persists, e) Tight labour/service inflation.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden disinflation print in February drives 75 bp cut; would push outcome down sharply.
