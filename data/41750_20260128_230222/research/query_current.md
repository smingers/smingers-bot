Analysis:
To anticipate the target Selic rate that Brazil’s monetary-policy committee (Copom) will set in March 2026, I need the most up-to-date market expectations and Central Bank guidance. Relevant information includes:
• Current Selic level after the January 2026 meeting.  
• Forward guidance or minutes from Copom meetings.  
• Survey data such as the Focus report (Banco Central do Brasil) showing median forecasts for end-2026 or specifically March 2026.  
• Statements from BCB officials, inflation projections, and expectations for Brazil’s fiscal stance.  
• Commentary from major banks (Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, BTG Pactual), international institutions (IMF, Goldman Sachs), and fixed-income strategists about the Selic path.  
Collecting recent news articles (January 2026) and analyst reports will give the freshest consensus on where the Selic is expected to be by March 2026.
