Analysis:
The target Selic rate at the March-2026 Copom meeting will depend mainly on the direction and speed of Brazil’s current monetary-easing cycle that began in August 2023 (from 13.75 %).  By January 2026 the rate has already been cut several times (to 9 % in Dec-2025) amid falling headline inflation, a still-restrictive real rate, and a government commitment to a new fiscal framework.  Historically, once Copom starts an easing phase it tends to deliver 400–650 bp of cumulative cuts over 18–24 months unless inflation or fiscal risks re-accelerate (e.g., 2016-17 cycle: –775 bp; 2019-20: –250 bp cut then pause because of COVID).  Market surveys (e.g., BCB Focus) and forward-DI curves through Jan-2026 imply another 50–100 bp of easing by 1Q26, suggesting a possible Selic of 8.0 % or 8.5 %.  To build an outside-view distribution we therefore need:

• Exact path of Selic decisions from Aug-2023 to Jan-2026.  
• Inflation, activity and fiscal data over the same period.  
• Statements/minutes showing Copom’s reaction-function.  
• Analyst/Focus Survey forecasts made just before similar past meetings.  
• Historical size and spacing of cuts in prior cycles.  

Collecting these items will allow us to quantify the mean and variance of remaining cuts before March-2026 and compare them with past cycles, producing a more informed CDF for the target rate.
