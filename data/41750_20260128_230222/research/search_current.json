What to Expect from the Copom Decision**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) convened on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, to decide on the country's benchmark interest rate, the Selic. Market expectations indicated that the rate would be maintained at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006. Despite recent inflation deceleration, experts argue that inflation remains above the target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN) of 3% annually, with a tolerance of \u00b11.5 percentage points. The IPCA-15 index for January rose 0.20%, with a 12-month cumulative increase of 4.50%. The market is closely monitoring the Copom's communication for signals on a potential rate cut, which may begin at the next meeting in March 2026. According to the weekly Focus Bulletin from the Central Bank, the Selic rate is projected to end 2026 at 12.25% per year, signaling a gradual downward trajectory. The current decision provides a critical directional signal for monetary policy. The Selic rate is the primary tool used by the Central Bank to control inflation\u2014higher rates reduce consumption and help curb price increases but also raise borrowing costs, affecting households and businesses. Any change or maintenance of the rate is closely watched by economic agents and can trigger immediate market reactions in stocks, foreign exchange, consumption, and GDP growth.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Portal Contabeis](https://www.contabeis.com.br/noticias/74873/selic-vai-cair-veja-o-que-esperar-da-decisao-do-copom/)\n\n**Copom Begins Meeting to Decide on Brazil's Basic Interest Rate Amid Inflation Uncertainty**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) began its first meeting of 2026 on January 28, 2026, to decide on the Selic interest rate, which remains at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since July 2006. Market analysts expect the rate to be maintained at this peak level despite a recent decline in the U.S. dollar, which has stabilized around R$ 5.20. The rate has not been changed in the last four meetings, following seven consecutive increases from September 2024 to June 2025. The decision will be announced in the evening of January 28. The meeting is taking place with a reduced committee, as the mandates of directors Renato Gomes and Paulo Pichetti expired at the end of 2025, and President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has yet to submit nominations for replacements, which will only be done after the National Congress reconvenes in February. In the December meeting's minutes, Copom stated it would keep the Selic at 15% for an extended period to ensure inflation converges to the target, without specifying when cuts might begin. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain, requiring cautious monetary policy. While inflation has slowed, services prices continue to exert upward pressure. The latest Focus survey by the Central Bank shows inflation expectations for 2025 have dropped to 4.4% from 4.55% four weeks prior, still within the 1.5% tolerance band around the 3% target. The IPCA-15 (preliminary inflation index) rose 0.2% in October, with a 12-month cumulative rate of 4.5%, returning to the top of the target range. The full November IPCA data was released on January 28. The Selic rate is the benchmark for public debt and influences all other interest rates in the economy. It is the primary tool used by the Central Bank to control inflation through open market operations. Higher rates reduce demand, raise borrowing costs, and encourage savings, but can also slow economic growth. Lower rates typically make credit cheaper, stimulate consumption and production, and help reduce inflation. Copom meets every 45 days. The first day features technical presentations on domestic and global economic developments and financial markets. The second day is for deliberation and decision-making. Under the new continuous inflation targeting system effective since January 2025, the inflation target is 3% with a 1.5 percentage point tolerance band (1.5% to 4.5%). The target is assessed monthly based on 12-month inflation, with the evaluation period shifting forward each month\u2014e.g., February 2026 compares inflation from March 2025 onward. The Central Bank\u2019s latest Monetary Policy Report, released in late December 2025, maintained its 2026 inflation forecast at 3.5%, though this is expected to be revised. The next report, replacing the Inflation Report, will be released at the end of March 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:30 AM\nSource:[Home](https://odia.ig.com.br/economia/2026/01/7199601-copom-inicia-reuniao-para-definir-taxa-basica-de-juros.html)\n\n**With Reduced Quorum, Copom Decides on Maintaining Selic Rate**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) convened on January 28, 2026, for its first meeting of the year amid ongoing inflationary pressures despite a recent slowdown. The Selic rate, currently at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since July 2006\u2014was expected to be maintained, according to market analysts, following seven consecutive increases from September 2024 to June 2025 and no changes in the last four meetings. The decision was made under a reduced quorum, as the mandates of two directors\u2014Renato Gomes (Financial System Organization) and Paulo Pichetti (Economic Policy)\u2014expired at the end of 2025, with presidential nominations for replacements pending until the return of Congress in February. The Copom's December 2025 minutes indicated that the rate would remain at 15% for an extended period to ensure inflation converges to the target, without specifying when cuts might begin. Inflation remains uncertain: the preliminary IPCA-15 rose 0.2% in October, with a 12-month cumulative inflation of 4.5%, returning to the upper limit of the target range. The full November IPCA will be released on the same day. According to the latest Focus survey by the BC, inflation expectations for 2025 were revised downward to 4.4% from 4.55% four weeks prior, still slightly above the 3% target but within the 1.5 percentage point tolerance band (1.5% to 4.5%). The Selic rate, used as a benchmark for public debt and the broader economy, is managed via open market operations. While higher rates aim to cool demand and curb inflation by making credit more expensive, they can also slow economic growth. Conversely, lower rates stimulate credit, consumption, and production. Under the new continuous inflation targeting system introduced in January 2025, the target is 3% with a 1.5 percentage point tolerance, and the assessment is updated monthly based on the 12-month cumulative inflation. The Central Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report, released in December 2025, projected 2026 inflation at 3.5%, though this forecast may be revised. The next report will be released at the end of March 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:09 AM\nSource:[Ag\u00eancia Brasil](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2026-01/com-quorum-desfalcado-copom-decide-se-mantem-taxa-selic)\n\n**Market Expects Copom to Hold Rates at 15% in January 2026, with Cuts Set to Begin in March at Varying Paces**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate at 15% during its meeting on January 28, 2026, with market expectations shifting toward the start of rate cuts in March. Analysts from various institutions project different pacing: XP forecasts five consecutive 0.50 percentage point cuts starting in March, reaching 12.5% by the end of 2026; JP Morgan anticipates six cuts of 1.00 percentage point per quarter, ending at 11.50% by year-end; and Ita\u00fa expects a slower pace with a 0.25-point cut in March, reaching 12.25% by 2026. The Copom will assess economic data including inflation, labor market conditions, economic activity, and fiscal reform prospects, particularly the government\u2019s planned spending cuts starting in 2027. Market participants will closely monitor the language in the Copom\u2019s statement, with expectations that 'resili\u00eancia' (resilience) will be dropped from the description of economic activity, replaced by 'desacelera\u00e7\u00e3o apenas gradual' (gradual slowdown). The 'relevant horizon' for monetary policy\u2014projected to be the third quarter of 2027\u2014remains key, as the central bank aims to bring inflation to its target of 3%. Inflation closed 2025 at 4.26%, within the tolerance margin of 1.5 percentage points. Projections for the relevant horizon remain at 3.2% for Bradesco and Ita\u00fa, though XP expects a slight reduction to 3.1%. Economic instability linked to the 2026 elections, particularly currency volatility due to carry trade flows, is a major concern. Economists Roberto Simioni and Jos\u00e9 Alfaix emphasize that fiscal discipline is essential for effective monetary policy, as fiscal fragility can undermine inflation control and increase exchange rate risk, especially during election months (April\u2013July), when capital flows may reverse rapidly.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/economia/corte-juros-copom-previsao-selic-2026/)\n\n**Copom Sets New Interest Rate on 'Super Wednesday' with Expectation of Selic Rate Hold at 15%**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is set to announce the new basic interest rate on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, during a 'superquarta' event when both Brazil and the United States release their monetary policy decisions simultaneously. Analysts widely expect the Selic rate to remain unchanged at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014marking the fourth consecutive meeting with no change after a seven-meeting rate hike cycle that began in September 2024. The decision follows the Copom's previous stance in December 2025, which maintained the rate at 15% to align with the inflation target convergence strategy. The committee emphasized that while its primary goal remains price stability, the decision also aims to moderate economic activity fluctuations and support full employment. Directors stressed the need for caution due to high domestic and external uncertainty, indicating that future policy adjustments may be made if inflation or inflation expectations re-anchor. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to hold its rate steady in the 3.50%\u20133.75% range. Market projections from the Focus report show the Selic rate forecasted at 12.25% by the end of 2026\u2014unchanged for five consecutive weeks\u2014and 10.5% by the end of 2027\u2014unchanged for 50 consecutive weeks. The Selic rate, Brazil\u2019s primary tool for controlling inflation (measured by the IPCA), influences consumer credit, loans, and credit card interest, with higher rates discouraging spending and helping curb inflation. The current 15% rate is the highest in 20 years, following a series of rate hikes after a prior period of cuts that reduced the rate from 13.75% in August 2022 to 10.5% in May 2024.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/economia/copom-define-nova-taxa-de-juros-nesta-quarta-com-expectativa-de-manutencao-da-selic-em-15-28012026/)\n\n**In First 2026 Meeting, Copom Expected to Keep Interest Rate Stable at 15% Amid Inflation Concerns**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate unchanged at 15% per year during its first meeting of 2026\u2014the highest level in nearly 20 years. This would mark the fifth consecutive hold in the rate, according to market economists. The decision, announced after 6:00 PM, reflects the Central Bank's ongoing strategy to control inflation by maintaining high rates, despite signs of economic deceleration. Economists note that inflation remains above the target range of 1.5% to 4.5%, with the goal set at 3% under the continuous target system introduced in early 2025. The Central Bank evaluates future inflation projections, not current price changes, as rate adjustments take six to 18 months to fully impact the economy. As of now, the Bank is assessing inflation trends through the third quarter of 2027. Analysts such as S\u00e9rgio Samuel dos Santos of Sistema Ailos and Gustavo Sung of Suno Research emphasize that Copom should remain cautious, citing strong economic activity, a tight labor market with unemployment at historic lows, and the need for clearer signals before initiating rate cuts. The economy continues to operate above its potential without significantly increasing inflation, as indicated by a positive 'output gap' in the previous Copom minutes. Market forecasts project the first rate reduction to occur in March 2026, lowering the Selic to 14.5% per year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:01 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2026/01/28/na-primeira-reuniao-de-2026-copom-deve-manter-juro-estavel-em-15percent-ao-ano-maior-nivel-em-quase-20-anos.ghtml)\n\n**D\u00f3lar Opens Lower on First Day of Copom Meeting as Markets Await Interest Rate Decisions**\nThe Brazilian real opened lower on the first day of the Copom meeting to set the Selic rate, as markets awaited the 'Super Wednesday' of monetary policy decisions from both the Central Bank of Brazil and the U.S. Federal Reserve. Over 80% of market agents expect the Copom, led by Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, to maintain the Selic rate at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014due to recent signs of declining inflation (IPCA-15) and economic slowdown, which reflect the success of the Central Bank\u2019s anti-inflation strategy. The Copom is expected to delay rate cuts until the next meeting in March. Similarly, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to hold rates steady in the 3.75%\u20134% range, awaiting further economic indicators before resuming cuts. Gold stabilized near record highs of $5,105 per ounce (28.35 grams), having risen nearly 90% over the past 12 months, driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions from U.S. foreign policy. Brazil\u2019s stock market, represented by the Ibovespa, remained near record levels, closing up 0.08% at 178,720 points despite minor adjustments, with the index up 11% in January and 34% in 2025. Expectations of upcoming rate cuts have fueled investor optimism and sustained capital inflows.

Analysts anticipate that the Copom will maintain a cautious stance, avoiding explicit signals of future cuts but leaving room for flexibility in the next meeting. The market consensus, based on a Proje\u00e7\u00f5es Broadcast survey of 37 institutions, shows 34 expect rate cuts to begin in March, reflecting a shift from earlier expectations of cuts in January. Economists such as Rafaela Vit\u00f3ria (Banco Inter) and Felipe Sichel (Porto Asset) emphasize that the Copom is prioritizing data maturity, particularly on inflation, labor market trends, and the impact of the Income Tax (IR) reform. Sichel notes that while economic activity has shown strength, disinflation continues, and the committee is likely to begin discussing conditions under which current monetary restraint may be revised. The inflation forecast for the second quarter of 2027, previously projected at 3.2% by the Copom, may influence discussion, though individual member views remain opaque due to lack of transparency in Brazil compared to the U.S. The central bank\u2019s president, Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, has previously stated there is no 'arrow' or 'closed door' in the committee\u2019s decision-making, reinforcing the expectation of a non-committal yet open-ended communication.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 08:30 AM\nSource:[Estad\u00e3o](https://www.estadao.com.br/economia/copom-deve-manter-taxa-selic-em-15-quando-os-juros-devem-comecar-a-cair/)\n\n**Will Selic Be Cut? What to Expect from the Copom Decision**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) convened on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, to decide on the country's benchmark interest rate, the Selic. Market expectations indicated that the rate would be maintained at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006. Despite recent inflation deceleration, experts argue that inflation remains above the target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN) of 3% annually, with a tolerance of \u00b11.5 percentage points. The IPCA-15 index for January rose 0.20%, with a 12-month cumulative increase of 4.50%. The market is closely monitoring the Copom's communication for signals on a potential rate cut, which may begin at the next meeting in March 2026. According to the weekly Focus Bulletin from the Central Bank, the Selic rate is projected to end 2026 at 12.25% per year, signaling a gradual downward trajectory. The current decision provides a critical directional signal for monetary policy. The Selic rate is the primary tool used by the Central Bank to control inflation\u2014higher rates reduce consumption and help curb price increases but also raise borrowing costs, affecting households and businesses. Any change or maintenance of the rate is closely watched by economic agents and can trigger immediate market reactions in stocks, foreign exchange, consumption, and GDP growth.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Portal Contabeis](https://www.contabeis.com.br/noticias/74873/selic-vai-cair-veja-o-que-esperar-da-decisao-do-copom/)\n\n**Copom Begins Meeting to Decide on Brazil's Basic Interest Rate Amid Inflation Uncertainty**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) began its first meeting of 2026 on January 28, 2026, to decide on the Selic interest rate, which remains at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since July 2006. Market analysts expect the rate to be maintained at this peak level despite a recent decline in the U.S. dollar, which has stabilized around R$ 5.20. The rate has not been changed in the last four meetings, following seven consecutive increases from September 2024 to June 2025. The decision will be announced in the evening of January 28. The meeting is taking place with a reduced committee, as the mandates of directors Renato Gomes and Paulo Pichetti expired at the end of 2025, and President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has yet to submit nominations for replacements, which will only be done after the National Congress reconvenes in February. In the December meeting's minutes, Copom stated it would keep the Selic at 15% for an extended period to ensure inflation converges to the target, without specifying when cuts might begin. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain, requiring cautious monetary policy. While inflation has slowed, services prices continue to exert upward pressure. The latest Focus survey by the Central Bank shows inflation expectations for 2025 have dropped to 4.4% from 4.55% four weeks prior, still within the 1.5% tolerance band around the 3% target. The IPCA-15 (preliminary inflation index) rose 0.2% in October, with a 12-month cumulative rate of 4.5%, returning to the top of the target range. The full November IPCA data was released on January 28. The Selic rate is the benchmark for public debt and influences all other interest rates in the economy. It is the primary tool used by the Central Bank to control inflation through open market operations. Higher rates reduce demand, raise borrowing costs, and encourage savings, but can also slow economic growth. Lower rates typically make credit cheaper, stimulate consumption and production, and help reduce inflation. Copom meets every 45 days. The first day features technical presentations on domestic and global economic developments and financial markets. The second day is for deliberation and decision-making. Under the new continuous inflation targeting system effective since January 2025, the inflation target is 3% with a 1.5 percentage point tolerance band (1.5% to 4.5%). The target is assessed monthly based on 12-month inflation, with the evaluation period shifting forward each month\u2014e.g., February 2026 compares inflation from March 2025 onward. The Central Bank\u2019s latest Monetary Policy Report, released in late December 2025, maintained its 2026 inflation forecast at 3.5%, though this is expected to be revised. The next report, replacing the Inflation Report, will be released at the end of March 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:30 AM\nSource:[Home](https://odia.ig.com.br/economia/2026/01/7199601-copom-inicia-reuniao-para-definir-taxa-basica-de-juros.html)\n\n**With Reduced Quorum, Copom Decides on Maintaining Selic Rate**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) convened on January 28, 2026, for its first meeting of the year amid ongoing inflationary pressures despite a recent slowdown. The Selic rate, currently at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since July 2006\u2014was expected to be maintained, according to market analysts, following seven consecutive increases from September 2024 to June 2025 and no changes in the last four meetings. The decision was made under a reduced quorum, as the mandates of two directors\u2014Renato Gomes (Financial System Organization) and Paulo Pichetti (Economic Policy)\u2014expired at the end of 2025, with presidential nominations for replacements pending until the return of Congress in February. The Copom's December 2025 minutes indicated that the rate would remain at 15% for an extended period to ensure inflation converges to the target, without specifying when cuts might begin. Inflation remains uncertain: the preliminary IPCA-15 rose 0.2% in October, with a 12-month cumulative inflation of 4.5%, returning to the upper limit of the target range. The full November IPCA will be released on the same day. According to the latest Focus survey by the BC, inflation expectations for 2025 were revised downward to 4.4% from 4.55% four weeks prior, still slightly above the 3% target but within the 1.5 percentage point tolerance band (1.5% to 4.5%). The Selic rate, used as a benchmark for public debt and the broader economy, is managed via open market operations. While higher rates aim to cool demand and curb inflation by making credit more expensive, they can also slow economic growth. Conversely, lower rates stimulate credit, consumption, and production. Under the new continuous inflation targeting system introduced in January 2025, the target is 3% with a 1.5 percentage point tolerance, and the assessment is updated monthly based on the 12-month cumulative inflation. The Central Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report, released in December 2025, projected 2026 inflation at 3.5%, though this forecast may be revised. The next report will be released at the end of March 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:09 AM\nSource:[Ag\u00eancia Brasil](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2026-01/com-quorum-desfalcado-copom-decide-se-mantem-taxa-selic)\n\n**Market Expects Copom to Hold Rates at 15% in January 2026, with Cuts Set to Begin in March at Varying Paces**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate at 15% during its meeting on January 28, 2026, with market expectations shifting toward the start of rate cuts in March. Analysts from various institutions project different pacing: XP forecasts five consecutive 0.50 percentage point cuts starting in March, reaching 12.5% by the end of 2026; JP Morgan anticipates six cuts of 1.00 percentage point per quarter, ending at 11.50% by year-end; and Ita\u00fa expects a slower pace with a 0.25-point cut in March, reaching 12.25% by 2026. The Copom will assess economic data including inflation, labor market conditions, economic activity, and fiscal reform prospects, particularly the government\u2019s planned spending cuts starting in 2027. Market participants will closely monitor the language in the Copom\u2019s statement, with expectations that 'resili\u00eancia' (resilience) will be dropped from the description of economic activity, replaced by 'desacelera\u00e7\u00e3o apenas gradual' (gradual slowdown). The 'relevant horizon' for monetary policy\u2014projected to be the third quarter of 2027\u2014remains key, as the central bank aims to bring inflation to its target of 3%. Inflation closed 2025 at 4.26%, within the tolerance margin of 1.5 percentage points. Projections for the relevant horizon remain at 3.2% for Bradesco and Ita\u00fa, though XP expects a slight reduction to 3.1%. Economic instability linked to the 2026 elections, particularly currency volatility due to carry trade flows, is a major concern. Economists Roberto Simioni and Jos\u00e9 Alfaix emphasize that fiscal discipline is essential for effective monetary policy, as fiscal fragility can undermine inflation control and increase exchange rate risk, especially during election months (April\u2013July), when capital flows may reverse rapidly.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/economia/corte-juros-copom-previsao-selic-2026/)\n\n**Copom to Hold Selic Rate at 15% Without Explicit Signal of March Cut**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate at 15% on January 28, 2026, without explicitly signaling a rate cut in March. Market expectations reflect caution due to persistent inflation pressures, particularly in core and service sectors, and ongoing fiscal concerns. While some analysts and institutions anticipate the start of rate cuts in the first quarter, the majority of the market expects the Copom's statement to be less rigid but without a clear commitment to a March reduction, reinforcing a prolonged period of high interest rates. Economists, including Andr\u00e9 Matos of MA7 Neg\u00f3cios, emphasize that the tone of the statement\u2014particularly the focus on data dependence and concerns about unanchored inflation expectations\u2014will be more critical than the decision itself. The Ita\u00fa economists suggest the Copom may make subtle communication changes, such as removing the reminder that it could resume rate hikes if needed, thereby opening the door for a March cut. XP economists project the rate cut cycle will begin in the first quarter, with the Selic reaching 12.50% by the end of 2026. The weekly Focus Bulletin from the Central Bank also forecasts a 0.50 percentage point cut in March. The Selic rate influences all other interest rates in the economy, affecting consumer credit, business investment, employment, and inflation: lower rates reduce monthly payments, boost consumption and investment, and stimulate job creation, while higher rates have the opposite effect, cooling demand and moderating inflation.

Analysts widely expect the Selic rate to remain unchanged at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014marking the fourth consecutive meeting with no change after a seven-meeting rate hike cycle that began in September 2024. The decision follows the Copom's previous stance in December 2025, which maintained the rate at 15% to align with the inflation target convergence strategy. The committee emphasized that while its primary goal remains price stability, the decision also aims to moderate economic activity fluctuations and support full employment. Directors stressed the need for caution due to high domestic and external uncertainty, indicating that future policy adjustments may be made if inflation or inflation expectations re-anchor. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to hold its rate steady in the 3.50%\u20133.75% range. Market projections from the Focus report show the Selic rate forecasted at 12.25% by the end of 2026\u2014unchanged for five consecutive weeks\u2014and 10.5% by the end of 2027\u2014unchanged for 50 consecutive weeks. The Selic rate, Brazil\u2019s primary tool for controlling inflation (measured by the IPCA), influences consumer credit, loans, and credit card interest, with higher rates discouraging spending and helping curb inflation. The current 15% rate is the highest in 20 years, following a series of rate hikes after a prior period of cuts that reduced the rate from 13.75% in August 2022 to 10.5% in May 2024.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/economia/copom-define-nova-taxa-de-juros-nesta-quarta-com-expectativa-de-manutencao-da-selic-em-15-28012026/)\n\n**In First 2026 Meeting, Copom Expected to Keep Interest Rate Stable at 15% Amid Inflation Concerns**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate unchanged at 15% per year during its first meeting of 2026\u2014the highest level in nearly 20 years. This would mark the fifth consecutive hold in the rate, according to market economists. The decision, announced after 6:00 PM, reflects the Central Bank's ongoing strategy to control inflation by maintaining high rates, despite signs of economic deceleration. Economists note that inflation remains above the target range of 1.5% to 4.5%, with the goal set at 3% under the continuous target system introduced in early 2025. The Central Bank evaluates future inflation projections, not current price changes, as rate adjustments take six to 18 months to fully impact the economy. As of now, the Bank is assessing inflation trends through the third quarter of 2027. Analysts such as S\u00e9rgio Samuel dos Santos of Sistema Ailos and Gustavo Sung of Suno Research emphasize that Copom should remain cautious, citing strong economic activity, a tight labor market with unemployment at historic lows, and the need for clearer signals before initiating rate cuts. The economy continues to operate above its potential without significantly increasing inflation, as indicated by a positive 'output gap' in the previous Copom minutes. Market forecasts project the first rate reduction to occur in March 2026, lowering the Selic to 14.5% per year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:01 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2026/01/28/na-primeira-reuniao-de-2026-copom-deve-manter-juro-estavel-em-15percent-ao-ano-maior-nivel-em-quase-20-anos.ghtml)\n\n**D\u00f3lar Opens Lower on First Day of Copom Meeting as Markets Await Interest Rate Decisions**\nThe Brazilian real opened lower on the first day of the Copom meeting to set the Selic rate, as markets awaited the 'Super Wednesday' of monetary policy decisions from both the Central Bank of Brazil and the U.S. Federal Reserve. Over 80% of market agents expect the Copom, led by Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, to maintain the Selic rate at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014due to recent signs of declining inflation (IPCA-15) and economic slowdown, which reflect the success of the Central Bank\u2019s anti-inflation strategy. The Copom is expected to delay rate cuts until the next meeting in March. Similarly, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to hold rates steady in the 3.75%\u20134% range, awaiting further economic indicators before resuming cuts. Gold stabilized near record highs of $5,105 per ounce (28.35 grams), having risen nearly 90% over the past 12 months, driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions from U.S. foreign policy. Brazil\u2019s stock market, represented by the Ibovespa, remained near record levels, closing up 0.08% at 178,720 points despite minor adjustments, with the index up 11% in January and 34% in 2025.

The current Selic rate is 15% per year, the highest level since 2006, following seven consecutive increases since September 2024. In the previous meeting in December 2025, Copom maintained the rate at 15% for the fourth consecutive time, ending a cycle of seven rate hikes that began in September 2024. The committee stated that the decision aligns with the strategy of converging inflation toward its target, while also aiming to moderate economic activity fluctuations and support full employment. Despite high uncertainty\u2014both external and internal\u2014Copom opted for a cautious approach, keeping rates elevated and signaling it may resume tightening if inflation or inflation expectations become unanchored. Market projections from the Focus report, released by the Central Bank on January 26, 2026, show the benchmark rate expected to remain at 12.25% by the end of 2026 for the fifth consecutive week, and at 10.5% by the end of 2027 for the 50th consecutive week. The Selic rate is the primary tool for controlling the IPCA (National Consumer Price Index); higher rates increase borrowing costs, reduce consumption and production, and slow economic growth, thereby helping to curb inflation. The rate had previously been lowered from 13.75% in August 2022 to 10.5% in May 2024 through six consecutive 0.5 percentage point cuts and one 0.25 percentage point cut.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/economia/copom-comeca-nesta-terca-reuniao-para-definir-juros-com-expectativa-de-selic-em-15-27012026/)\n\n**Expectation for Copom Meeting Shifts from Rate Cuts to Verbal Signals**\nThe market expects no change in Brazil's Selic interest rate during the Copom meeting on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, instead focusing on the central bank's communication for signals of future rate cuts. This expectation follows a stronger-than-anticipated 0.7% increase in the Banco Central's Index of Economic Activity (IBC-Br) for November, nearly double the average forecast of 0.4%, which dashed hopes of a rate cut on the meeting day. With the Selic rate currently at 15%, and most economists surveyed in the BC's Focus Report expecting it to end the year at 12.25%, there is a projected 2.75 percentage point reduction available between March and December. The Copom faces challenges in communicating policy clearly, as verbal guidance is open to interpretation\u2014unlike fixed rate changes. The risk of ambiguous messaging was evident in a prior instance when a subtle shift confused the market. Economists stress the need for clarity, especially given the high cost of government debt, much of which is indexed to the Selic rate, and the fact that 2026 is an election year. Economist Andr\u00e9 Perfeito notes that if the central bank has room to cut, it should begin early to avoid political pressure for populist measures. A gradual reduction of 0.5 percentage points per meeting\u2014six meetings with one at 0.25 points\u2014would achieve the projected cut by December.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[GZH](https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/colunistas/marta-sfredo/noticia/2026/01/expectativa-para-reuniao-do-copom-volta-a-ser-de-palavras-em-vez-de-taxas-cmkud7lf502oh0168gy9axcqq.html)\n\n**Expectations of U.S. Rate Cuts and Anticipated Selic Decline Boost Ibovespa**\nThe Ibovespa index was boosted by expectations of further interest rate cuts in the United States and the anticipated start of a decline in Brazil's Selic rate. In China, iron ore closed down 0.92% in Dalian amid weaker-than-expected data, while oil fell up to 0.20% in international markets. Analyst Felipe Sant'Anna of Axia Investing noted a 'year-end party' in the market, driven by corporate dividend payments ahead of a new income tax law set to take effect in 2026, which may prompt companies to distribute dividends early to avoid future taxation. Investors are preparing for key economic releases, including Brazil\u2019s Copom meeting minutes and the Monetary Policy Report (RPM) on Thursday, as well as U.S. payroll data, the CPI inflation index, and interest rate decisions from the UK, Eurozone, and Japan. Federal Reserve officials are also expected to deliver speeches. The Focus bulletin showed slight downward revisions: the 2025 IPCA projection fell from 4.05% to 4.04%, 2026 IPCA from 4.16% to 4.10%, and the 12-month forward estimate from 4.05% to 4.04%. The Selic rate forecast for 2026 dropped from 12.25% to 12.13% annually. Silvio Campos Neto of Tend\u00eancias Consultoria emphasized that while awaiting the Copom and RPM reports, the Focus data\u2014particularly the reduced 2026 IPCA forecast\u2014supports expectations of a Selic rate cut starting in January. The IBC-Br for October posted a 0.25% decline from September, contrary to the median expectation of a 0.10% rise, signaling economic softening in the fourth quarter and reinforcing expectations of a rate cut.

The decision, which came without any signals of imminent rate cuts, was met with market expectations of a delay in the easing cycle, shifting the anticipated start of cuts from January 2026 to March 2026. The Copom revised its inflation projection for the second quarter of 2027 downward from 3.3% to 3.2%, reflecting a slightly more favorable outlook, while also updating its description of the labor market from 'dynamism' to 'resilience'. Despite these minor adjustments, the overall tone of the statement remained hawkish and conservative, with no indication of flexibility in the short term. Market analysts interpreted the lack of change in messaging as a sign that the central bank lacks confidence in initiating cuts in January. The decision reinforced the view that the central bank prioritizes prudence amid persistent inflationary pressures, anchored expectations, and ongoing domestic and global uncertainties. The market reacted with limited volatility, as the outcome was widely anticipated. The outlook for risk assets remains positive, with real estate funds and equities performing well, driven by expectations of future rate reductions. The statement did not mention political instability, which analysts viewed as a positive signal. Overall, the Copom's communication was consistent with its prior messaging, emphasizing that the current contractionary policy remains adequate, and that any future adjustments will depend on evolving data.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 11:23 PM\nSource:[E-Investidor](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/investimentos/copom-mantem-selic-15-cresce-aposta-corte-juros-marco-2026/)\n\n**Copom Concludes Final 2025 Meeting with Unchanged Selic Rate Amid Expectations of 2026 Cuts**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) concluded its final meeting of 2025 on December 10, 2025, with the Selic rate remaining unchanged at 15% per annum, as anticipated by financial market operators. The market, as reflected in the Central Bank's Focus Bulletin released on December 8, 2025, expected no change in the benchmark interest rate. Economist Gustavo Sung from Suno Research emphasized that Copom is maintaining a 'prudence strategy' amid economic slowdown and a resilient labor market, with continued pressure to control inflation. The committee's statement was firm, reiterating the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for an extended period. On the same day, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) also announced a 0.25 percentage point rate cut, maintaining the federal funds rate between 3.5% and 3.75%, leading to the term 'super Wednesday' due to the coinciding announcements. Analyst Jos\u00e9 Aureo Viana from Blue3 Investimentos warned that divergent signals\u2014such as a dovish Fed and a hawkish Copom\u2014could generate short-term volatility. Market projections, including those from Anbima\u2019s economist survey, suggest the first Selic rate cut may occur in March 2026, with a full reduction to 12% by year-end, while Suno Research anticipates a first cut in January 2026. Fiergs, however, projected a higher 13.25% by the end of 2026. Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin expressed confidence in an upcoming rate reduction, citing the falling dollar, the 2025 agricultural 'supersafra', and reduced tariff uncertainty with the U.S. as key factors, stating, 'The economy blossoms faster when interest rates fall.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[GZH](https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/economia/noticia/2025/12/copom-realiza-ultima-reuniao-do-ano-com-mercado-esperando-manutencao-da-selic-em-15-cmiyuhbrs00lu013ykthxosgf.html)\n\n**Jos\u00e9 Paulo Kupfer: After the Copom, analysts say one thing, traders do another**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) maintained the basic interest rate (Selic) at 15% per year on November 5, 2025, a decision that was unanimous among its members. Financial market analysts unanimously interpreted the Copom's communication as 'hawkish'\u2014indicating a tougher stance\u2014due to the use of the adverb 'bastante' (quite) in the phrase 'for a quite prolonged period,' signaling that the committee intends to keep interest rates high for an extended time. This marked a shift from prior expectations, which had anticipated the start of a rate-cutting cycle only in early 2026; the new outlook pushed those expectations to January, March, or even April 2026. Despite this hawkish tone, market indicators in the stock market showed contradictory signals, with stock prices moving in directions inconsistent with the expectation of sustained high interest rates. This divergence highlights a gap between analysts' interpretations and the actual behavior of market operators.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 05:44 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/colunas/jose-paulo-kupfer/2025/11/06/depois-do-copom-analistas-dizem-uma-coisa-e-operadores-fazem-outra.htm)\n\n**Bmg Analyst Says Copom Minutes Are Less Conservative, but Message Still Hard**\nThe minutes from the Copom meeting last week were interpreted by Bmg chief economist Fl\u00e1vio Serrano as signalling a slightly less conservative tone compared with the official communiqu\u00e9, yet the overall message remains firm and still rules out a Selic cut within the year. Serrano notes that the committee\u2019s confirmation of its baseline scenario gives \"comfort,\" but uncertainties remain. He argues that the central bank\u2019s stance is to keep the Selic at 15% to ensure inflation falls to the 3% target over time. Consequently, the probability of the BC easing policy in December has \"diminished a lot,\" and any shift would require an unexpected event by the final Copom meeting in 2025. Serrano highlights a strong labour market and the de\u2011anchoring of inflation expectations as key factors that will keep the committee\u2019s posture conservative. The Bmg baseline forecast expects the first cut in January 2026, reducing the Selic by 0.25 percentage point to 14.75%. However, the decision could be postponed to March if the labour market remains robust, service inflation stays high, and inflation expectations remain elevated. Serrano also believes that even the Fed\u2019s interest\u2011rate cycle or a continued dollar depreciation would not be enough to prompt an earlier easing in Brazil, as domestic conditions\u2014particularly a stronger real and the Fed cuts\u2014are not sufficient to create room for a December cut.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:45 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/financas/noticia/2025/09/23/ata-mostrou-copom-menos-conservador-mas-mensagem-ainda-dura-avalia-bmg.ghtml)\n\n**Copom Meeting Set for September 16, Market Anticipates 15% Selic Rate Maintenance**\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) will convene on Tuesday, 16\u202fSeptember to decide the level of Brazil\u2019s benchmark Selic rate, which is currently 15\u202f% per year.  The last meeting in July halted the Selic\u2019s rise after seven consecutive tightening sessions.  Copom will announce its decision on Wednesday, 17\u202fSeptember, and market participants expect the rate to stay at 15\u202f% at least until the end of the year.  In its latest communiqu\u00e9, Copom said it will \"continue to monitor the high\u2011rate cycle and assess the accumulated effects before deciding whether to keep the current rate for a prolonged period to ensure inflation converges to the target.\"  The committee cited a gradual slowdown in economic activity, a slow re\u2011anchoring of inflation expectations, and credit data that are consistent with the current policy cycle as reasons to maintain the rate.  Projections from Warren Investimentos anticipate the first rate cut in January\u202f2026 to 14.75\u202f%, while C6 Bank expects a cut in March\u202f2026 to 13\u202f%.  The market consensus is to keep the Selic at 15\u202f%, but analysts will closely watch Copom\u2019s communication for any sign of a change.  \"Acreditamos que o comit\u00ea vai fazer um pequeno ajuste na comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e afirmar que o cen\u00e1rio prescreve uma pol\u00edtica monet\u00e1ria em patamar significativamente contracionista por per\u00edodo prolongado \u2013 ao inv\u00e9s de per\u00edodo bastante prolongado \u2013 para assegurar a converg\u00eancia da infla\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 meta,\" said C6 Bank in a note.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 02:03 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/economia-br/copom-faz-reuniao-a-partir-desta-3a-mercado-espera-manutencao-da-taxa)\n\n**Pre\u2011market: Week to Feature Copom and Fed Meetings**\nThe article reports that investors are anticipating the upcoming meetings of Brazil\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  For Brazil, the consensus is that the Selic reference rate will remain at 15% per year at least until the end of 2025; options on Copom traded on B3 on 12 September showed a 95% probability of maintaining the current rate, which has been unchanged since 20 June.  In the United States, investors expect the Federal Reserve to resume interest\u2011rate cuts after the pause in December 2024.  The Fed Funds rate is currently 4.25%\u20114.50% per year, and most estimates call for a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut, with a 5% chance of a 0.50\u2011point cut.  The most common scenario projects a total 0.75\u2011point reduction by the end of 2025, potentially spread over three 0.25\u2011point cuts in September, October, and December, or a single 0.5\u2011point cut followed by a pause.  U.S. inflation remains above target, but employment is slowing faster than expected.  The August core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.1% YoY, matching July\u2019s reading and expectations.  Non\u2011farm payroll data for August showed 22,000 new jobs, while July\u2019s revised figure was 79,000, up from the preliminary 73,000.  A semi\u2011annual review of March\u2011March 2024\u20112025 revealed 911,000 fewer job openings than projected, a 50% higher shortfall than the 2024 median estimate of 600,000 and the largest since 2002; on average, the U.S. economy created 76,000 fewer jobs per month than expected.  These employment trends may justify more pronounced rate cuts by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.  The article concludes that, amid a weak calendar of indicators, investors remain focused on corporate news and interest\u2011rate expectations in both Brazil and the United States.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[Forbes Brasil](https://forbes.com.br/forbes-money/2025/09/pre-mercado-semana-tera-reunioes-do-copom-e-do-fed/)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
