Key drivers of growth include smartphone adoption, smart TVs, and advancements in AI and VR technologies that enhance user experience. On-demand streaming is a major growth segment, supported by cloud and network-attached storage solutions. The report highlights that subscription-based models currently dominate revenue, but advertising-based models are expected to grow significantly, especially in Asia. The media and entertainment vertical leads the market, while sports and esports are projected to grow fastest due to live broadcast demand. North America currently leads the market, but Asia is poised for rapid expansion due to rising internet and smartphone penetration. The report covers six key segments: component type (software and services), channel type (OTT, cable TV, IPTV, satellite TV), platform type (smartphones, smart TVs, gaming consoles, etc.), revenue model (subscription, advertising, transactional), vertical type (media, sports, etc.), and geographical regions.

Netflix reported 17.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2025, accelerating from 17.2% in Q3, with its operating margin expanding from 26.7% in 2024 to 29.5% in 2025, and management expects it to reach 31.5% in 2026. The company\u2019s advertising business more than doubled in 2025, reaching over $1.5 billion in revenue (3.3% of total), and is expected to roughly double again in 2026. Alphabet\u2019s revenue grew 16% year over year in Q3 2025, with its cloud computing segment growing 34% year over year and accounting for 15% of total revenue. Google Cloud\u2019s operating income surged 85% year over year to $3.6 billion. While both stocks have similar P/E ratios (33 for Alphabet, 34 for Netflix), Alphabet is viewed as the better long-term buy due to its diversified business model, broad-based double-digit growth across segments, and faster-growing, high-margin cloud business. Netflix, though growing rapidly, has a smaller advertising segment and faces significant risk from its $82.7 billion pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s assets, which represents about 23% of Netflix\u2019s market cap. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and carries substantial execution risk. The Motley Fool recommends Alphabet and Netflix, but notes that Alphabet\u2019s diversification and lack of a high-risk acquisition make it the superior choice for a 10-year hold.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/28/netflix-vs-alphabet-stock-which-is-the-better-grow/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=6335de69-7999-48f1-9b04-a01ac15c7fd7)\n\n**South Korea Video Streaming Market Size, Growth, Key Players, Latest Trends and Forecast 2033**\nThe South Korea video streaming market was valued at USD 1,997.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 4,023.6 million by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.09% from 2025 to 2033. Key drivers include rising high-speed internet access, increasing smartphone penetration, the global popularity of South Korean content (K-dramas and K-pop), competition from global streaming giants like Netflix, government support for digital infrastructure, consumer willingness to pay for premium content, and enhanced user engagement through social features. Major trends include the surge in subscription-based services, the rise of mobile streaming, increased investment in local content production, and a growing focus on user experience and advanced technologies such as AI and virtual reality. Market segmentation reveals that 'Solution' components (IPTV, Over-the-top, Pay TV) and 'Non-Linear Video Streaming' dominate, while subscription and hybrid revenue models are gaining traction. The Seoul Capital Area leads the regional market due to strong urban and digital infrastructure.

Discovery. The deal, which would create a dominant streaming entity with an estimated 428 million subscribers, faces significant antitrust scrutiny from U.S. and U.K. regulators, who fear reduced consumer choice, higher prices, and barriers to entry for competitors. Political interference, including commentary from former President Trump, has further complicated the regulatory outlook. Historical precedents\u2014such as the failed AOL-Time Warner merger and AT&T\u2019s problematic acquisition of Time Warner\u2014have heightened market skepticism about integration risks. Netflix\u2019s own recent performance has worsened sentiment: it reduced its 2026 revenue growth forecast from 13% to 11%, weakened operating margin guidance, and faced one-off tax payments in Brazil. A ten-for-one stock split in November 2025 coincided with the downturn, encouraging profit-taking. A competing all-cash offer from Paramount and Skydance, valued at $108 billion, has intensified pressure on Netflix to match terms, which could push its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 5.4 times\u2014threatening its investment-grade credit rating and triggering forced selling by covenant-bound institutions. Such leverage would likely halt Netflix\u2019s long-running share repurchase program, divert free cash flow to debt service (potentially consuming up to one-third of operating profit), and risk severe cuts to content budgets during a critical integration phase. Despite these risks, Warner\u2019s assets\u2014including HBO\u2019s prestige content, major franchises, and live sports rights to NHL and MLB\u2014offer long-term strategic value by enabling advertising-driven growth. Netflix is expected to accelerate its shift to lower-priced ad-supported plans ($7\u2013$9), aiming to boost combined subscription and ad revenue per user above $10, while raising ad-free pricing to $19\u2013$22. The Warner Bros. Discovery board is expected to make a final decision by April 2026, with antitrust reviews starting in March 2026 and potentially lasting 12\u201318 months, pushing closing into 2027. Every regulatory and financing development will continue to fuel volatility in Netflix\u2019s stock.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:44 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/netflix-slides-as-warner-deal-risk-starts-to-outweigh-the-streaming-growth-story-200673935)\n\n**Netflix Stock Falls 1.3% Amid Strong Earnings and Rising Analyst Targets**\nThe Netflix stock declined 1.3% during the NASDAQ session, falling to $84.61 at 20:08, with a low of $83.89, after opening at $85.35.

Key stocks in focus included Boeing (BA.N), which reported a fourth-quarter profit after prior losses, driven by the sale of its navigation software provider, increased aircraft production, and higher deliveries. American Airlines (AAL.O) rose 3.7% in pre-market trading, citing strong business travel recovery and high demand for premium services, projecting 2026 earnings above expectations. UPS (UPS.N) gained 4.1% as it forecast 2026 revenue growth, shifting focus from low-margin Amazon deliveries to higher-value shipments. UnitedHealth (UNH.N) reported adjusted 2026 earnings slightly above estimates, but its stock plunged over 12% due to lower-than-expected Medicare Advantage rate increases for 2027, dragging down Humana (HUM.N) and CVS Health (CVS.N) by 16% and 11%, respectively. General Motors (GM.N) rose 6.1% on strong EBIT growth in Q4, fueled by robust sales of affordable SUVs and pickups. Ford (F.N) and GM are negotiating with bankrupt auto parts supplier First Brands to potentially fund its survival during restructuring. Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) fell 1.2% despite Q4 profit and revenue growth, as 2026 revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. RTX (RTX.N) climbed 3.6% on strong revenue and profit from engine sales and high demand for aircraft maintenance services. Micron Technology (MU.O) announced plans to build a new memory chip plant in Singapore amid global chip shortages. Netflix (NFLX.O) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) faced scrutiny as over a dozen UK politicians urged the UK competition authority to review Netflix\u2019s bid for Warner Bros Discovery. The European Commission initiated two procedures to ensure Google (GOOGL.O) complies with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Cloudflare (NET.N) surged 11.5% in pre-market trading, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains, driven by investor enthusiasm for its AI agent Clawdbot. Pinterest (PINS.N) declined 2.2% as it announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce to reallocate resources toward AI development. Nucor (NUE.N) reported lower-than-expected Q4 earnings and revenue, pressured by rising costs impacting steel production margins.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:21 PM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/usa-les-valeurs-a-suivre-a-wall-street-actualise-20aa92fabc8289a295080d399d4b8b9d)\n\n**Can Netflix Still Become a $1 Trillion Company by 2030?**\nNetflix (NFLX) aims to achieve a $1 trillion market valuation by 2030, a goal set by executives in early 2025.

This downturn stems from a cautious 2026 outlook, driven by the end of favorable foreign-exchange effects (which added over $500 million in 2025) and limited room for further price hikes in key markets like the U.S. and Canada. Management now expects advertising revenue to reach $3 billion in 2026 and international revenue growth of 12%\u201314%, relying on subscriber expansion and ad sales. Although Netflix remains on track for its 2030 targets\u2014requiring only 11% annual revenue growth and modest margin expansion\u2014the $83 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery introduces financial risks, including higher debt and interest expenses. The company\u2019s current stock valuation at 27 times forward earnings, below the 40x multiple needed for a $1 trillion valuation, suggests a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, though market sentiment and valuation multiples remain key uncertainties.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:30 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/27/can-netflix-still-become-a-1-trillion-company-by-2/)\n\n**Netflix\u2019s Ad Revenue Surge in 2025: Attention, Not Subscriptions, Is the New Streaming Currency**\nIn 2025, Netflix more than doubled its advertising revenue, confirming that attention\u2014not subscriptions\u2014is becoming the core business model of streaming. The company, led by Ted Sarandos, launched ad-supported plans around 2022 to sustain profit margins as subscription growth plateaued. By 2025, ad revenue reached approximately $1.5 billion\u2014over 2.5 times the $600 million earned in 2024. Internal projections expect ad revenue to double again by 2026. Though Netflix entered the ad market later than competitors like YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, it compensated with advanced execution, including fine-grained audience segmentation and a highly attractive ad offering anchored in sustained user attention. Globally, Netflix has 325 million users, with 94 million on the ad-supported plan. In Mexico, over 24 million users have opted into watching ads. Internal data shows that among this group, 23% no longer watch free-to-air TV, 37% have stopped using YouTube, and 55% no longer use Amazon Prime\u2014even when it offers ads. Netflix is leveraging AI to deploy scene-based targeting, aligning ads with on-screen content (e.g., car ads during chases, food ads during meals) and enabling direct mobile engagement for immediate actions like purchases. Despite this, the company\u2019s most powerful asset remains its original content\u2014titles like *One Piece*, *Wednesday*, and the *Narnia* saga\u2014which drive audience loyalty and engagement. Netflix doesn\u2019t sell isolated ad space; it sells cultural context, environmental control, and guaranteed attention within a closed ecosystem. As user attention becomes scarcer, Netflix is redefining who controls the precise moment a brand can reach a consumer.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:18 AM\nSource:[El Heraldo de M\ufffdxico](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/opinion/2026/1/27/disculpe-le-voy-poner-un-anuncio-762967.html)\n\n**\"Global Video Streaming Market to Reach USD 2.23 Trillion by 2035\"**\nThe global video streaming market is projected to grow from USD 364.7 billion in 2025 to USD 2.23 trillion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.93%, according to a report published by ResearchAndMarkets.com on January 28, 2026.

(NASDAQ: FFIV) reported strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 on January 27, 2026, exceeding analyst expectations. The company recorded total revenue of $822 million, a 7% year-over-year increase, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $4.45, surpassing the projected $3.65. Following the announcement, F5's stock rose 1.11% in after-hours trading to $269.50. The results were driven primarily by a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue from systems, which reached $218 million, offsetting an 8% decline in software revenue to $192 million. Product revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $410 million, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit product revenue growth. The company improved its full-year 2026 forecast, now expecting revenue growth of 5-6% (up from 0-4%) and adjusted EPS in the range of $15.65\u2013$16.05 (up from $14.50\u2013$15.50). For Q2 2026, F5 anticipates revenue of $770\u2013$790 million and adjusted EPS of $3.34\u2013$3.46. The adjusted operating margin improved by 80 basis points year-over-year to 38.2%, contributing to a 16% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS. Geographically, the EMEA region led with a 24% year-over-year revenue growth, accounting for 31% of total revenue, while the Americas grew 2% and the Asia-Pacific region saw a slight decline. The company attributes strong EMEA performance to regulatory drivers like NIS2, GDPR, and DORA. Software revenue remains subscription-based, with 86% of software revenue coming from subscriptions. F5 highlighted three strategic trends: hybrid multi-cloud adoption, AI-driven enterprise transformation, and convergent platforms. The company also announced a $300 million share buyback in Q1 2026, representing 201% of its quarterly free cash flow. Risks include continued softness in software revenue, supply chain disruptions, competitive pressures in AI and cloud sectors, macroeconomic pressures, and compliance costs from new regulations. Despite a recent security incident, F5 reported minimal impact on demand, with rapid response and investments in security automation and product resilience.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:21 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/company-news/article-93CH-3083255)\n\n**Netflix Slides as Warner Deal Risk Starts to Outweigh the Streaming Growth Story**\nNetflix shares have declined over 30% from their peak, driven by growing investor concerns over the potential $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. The deal, which would create a dominant streaming entity with an estimated 428 million subscribers, faces significant antitrust scrutiny from U.S. and U.K. regulators, who fear reduced consumer choice, higher prices, and barriers to entry for competitors. Political interference, including commentary from former President Trump, has further complicated the regulatory outlook. Historical precedents\u2014such as the failed AOL-Time Warner merger and AT&T\u2019s problematic acquisition of Time Warner\u2014have heightened market skepticism about integration risks. Netflix\u2019s own recent performance has worsened sentiment: it reduced its 2026 revenue growth forecast from 13% to 11%, weakened operating margin guidance, and faced one-off tax payments in Brazil. A ten-for-one stock split in November 2025 coincided with the downturn, encouraging profit-taking. A competing all-cash offer from Paramount and Skydance, valued at $108 billion, has intensified pressure on Netflix to match terms, which could push its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 5.4 times\u2014threatening its investment-grade credit rating and triggering forced selling by covenant-bound institutions. Such leverage would likely halt Netflix\u2019s long-running share repurchase program, divert free cash flow to debt service (potentially consuming up to one-third of operating profit), and risk severe cuts to content budgets during a critical integration phase. Despite these risks, Warner\u2019s assets\u2014including HBO\u2019s prestige content, major franchises, and live sports rights to NHL and MLB\u2014offer long-term strategic value by enabling advertising-driven growth. Netflix is expected to accelerate its shift to lower-priced ad-supported plans ($7\u2013$9), aiming to boost combined subscription and ad revenue per user above $10, while raising ad-free pricing to $19\u2013$22. The Warner Bros. Discovery board is expected to make a final decision by April 2026, with antitrust reviews starting in March 2026 and potentially lasting 12\u201318 months, pushing closing into 2027. Every regulatory and financing development will continue to fuel volatility in Netflix\u2019s stock.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:44 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/netflix-slides-as-warner-deal-risk-starts-to-outweigh-the-streaming-growth-story-200673935)\n\n**Netflix Stock Falls 1.3% Amid Strong Earnings and Rising Analyst Targets**\nThe Netflix stock declined 1.3% during the NASDAQ session, falling to $84.61 at 20:08, with a low of $83.89, after opening at $85.35.

This downturn stems from a cautious 2026 outlook, driven by the end of favorable foreign-exchange effects (which added over $500 million in 2025) and limited room for further price hikes in key markets like the U.S. and Canada. Management now expects advertising revenue to reach $3 billion in 2026 and international revenue growth of 12%\u201314%, relying on subscriber expansion and ad sales. Although Netflix remains on track for its 2030 targets\u2014requiring only 11% annual revenue growth and modest margin expansion\u2014the $83 billion acquisition of Warner Bros.

The company, led by Ted Sarandos, launched ad-supported plans around 2022 to sustain profit margins as subscription growth plateaued. By 2025, ad revenue reached approximately $1.5 billion\u2014over 2.5 times the $600 million earned in 2024. Internal projections expect ad revenue to double again by 2026. Though Netflix entered the ad market later than competitors like YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, it compensated with advanced execution, including fine-grained audience segmentation and a highly attractive ad offering anchored in sustained user attention. Globally, Netflix has 325 million users, with 94 million on the ad-supported plan. In Mexico, over 24 million users have opted into watching ads. Internal data shows that among this group, 23% no longer watch free-to-air TV, 37% have stopped using YouTube, and 55% no longer use Amazon Prime\u2014even when it offers ads. Netflix is leveraging AI to deploy scene-based targeting, aligning ads with on-screen content (e.g., car ads during chases, food ads during meals) and enabling direct mobile engagement for immediate actions like purchases. Despite this, the company\u2019s most powerful asset remains its original content\u2014titles like *One Piece*, *Wednesday*, and the *Narnia* saga\u2014which drive audience loyalty and engagement. Netflix doesn\u2019t sell isolated ad space; it sells cultural context, environmental control, and guaranteed attention within a closed ecosystem. As user attention becomes scarcer, Netflix is redefining who controls the precise moment a brand can reach a consumer.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 06:18 AM\nSource:[El Heraldo de M\ufffdxico](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/opinion/2026/1/27/disculpe-le-voy-poner-un-anuncio-762967.html)\n\n**Wedbush Forecasts Netflix Ad Revenue to Double by 2026**\nAccording to Wedbush analysts, Netflix's ad business remains in its early stages, with significant long-term growth potential. The analysts forecast that ad revenue could at least double from 2025 to 2026, reaching approximately $3 billion, and possibly exceed that figure. Ad business has lower marginal costs compared to subscription revenue, which could boost overall gross margin and deliver a stronger leverage effect. To address slowing paid subscriber growth, Netflix launched its ad-supported subscription plan in November 2022, targeting price-sensitive consumers. In November 2025, Netflix revealed that the monthly active users (MAU) for its ad-supported tier had surpassed 190 million, indicating successful user base expansion and growing ad monetization capabilities. Despite strong fourth-quarter financial results that exceeded market expectations, Netflix's stock has remained weak, reflecting investor concerns over stagnant subscriber growth and high content spending potentially eroding profitability.

The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at $398.73 billion, with a strong financial health score of 2.97 (GOOD) according to InvestingPro. Streaming hours rose 2% in the second half of 2025, driven by a 9% increase in original content viewing, including the latest season of 'Stranger Things' and the documentary 'The Reckoning.' Advertising revenue grew 2.5 times in 2025, surpassing $1.5 billion by year-end, with projections to double in 2026 through AI-powered ad tools leveraging Netflix\u2019s intellectual property. Total revenue reached $45.18 billion in 2025, up 15.85%, with a 43% return on equity. For 2026, Netflix plans new features like live voting, moments, expanded gameplay via controllers, and enhanced discovery tools, supported by AI for campaign planning, workflow automation, and content recommendation.

Advertising revenue more than tripled, exceeding $1.5 billion. Netflix also reported an operating profit of $2.96 billion, a 30% increase year-over-year, above the analysts' forecast of $2.89 billion. For 2026, Netflix forecasts revenue growth of up to 14% to $51.7 billion and an operating margin of 31.5%. Despite these strong results, the company issued cautious guidance due to increased content investments and costs related to its acquisition of Warner Bros.

Despite solid quarterly performance, investor sentiment turned negative due to concerns over the company's 2026 outlook. Netflix projected Q1 revenue growth of 15.3% and full-year revenue growth of 13.3%, which falls within its previously stated range. The company's operating margin is expected to rise to 31.5% in 2026, up from 2025\u2019s level, and free cash flow is forecast at $11 billion, compared to $10.1 billion in 2025. However, the operating margin increase was below market expectations, and earnings per share guidance of $0.76 missed analysts' estimate of $0.82. The market reacted negatively: Netflix's stock fell more than 5% in post-market trading. Key concerns include rising costs from a $27.75 per share all-cash offer for Warner Brothers, which includes $275 million in additional expenses, and a 10% increase in programming spending. Advertising revenue growth is expected to accelerate, potentially pressuring margins, prompting Netflix to plan price increases. Although Netflix executives remain confident that Warner Brothers' back catalog will drive future subscriber and ad growth, the market has responded with skepticism\u2014its shares are down 25% over the past six months. The uncertainty surrounding the deal, combined with a risk-averse global market environment marked by Japanese bond sell-offs and geopolitical tensions tied to Donald Trump\u2019s shifting foreign policy, has amplified investor unease.

This growth is driven by membership expansion, pricing improvements, and a projected doubling of advertising revenue compared to 2025. The company expects operating margins to rise to 31.5% in 2026, up from 29.5% in 2025, despite $275 million in acquisition-related costs and a roughly 10% increase in content amortization, with higher growth anticipated in the first half of the year. Netflix anticipates stronger operating income growth in the second half of 2026. The company maintains a strategic focus on balancing reinvestment with profitability, operating with over 300 million global subscribers and a market capitalization of approximately $371.97 billion. Financially, Netflix exhibits strong health with a current ratio of 1.33, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.56, and an Altman Z-Score of 10.37.

Discovery Deal**\nNetflix is preparing to report its fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, January 20, 2026, after market close, with investors closely watching its ability to sustain revenue growth amid slowing U.S. subscriber momentum and expanding strategic ambitions. Analysts expect moderate improvements in earnings and revenue, driven by continued international subscriber growth, higher pricing, and increasing ad revenue. IG Bank estimates revenue at $11.97 billion, a 16.8% year-over-year increase, with net income projected at $2.39 billion (up 27.7%) and earnings per share at $0.55 (up 29.4%). Ad revenue is forecasted to reach $1.08 billion, reflecting rapid scaling of the ad-supported tier. Beyond the quarter, analysts predict 13% revenue growth for 2026, indicating confidence in Netflix\u2019s evolving business model. International markets continue to drive subscriber growth, with global users surpassing 327 million, while U.S. growth has slowed as the market matures. Netflix\u2019s focus has shifted toward average revenue per user (ARPU), operating margins, and cash flow, with leadership noting that price increases have been absorbed better than expected, supporting pricing power. The ad-supported model is a central theme, with the fourth quarter expected to show stronger ad spending and revenue growth, potentially solidifying Netflix\u2019s hybrid subscription-ad model. Content strategy remains a key factor, with emphasis on global non-English originals to boost engagement and retention. Three critical signals for investors are ARPU, operating margin and cash flow, and engagement and revenue trends. The proposed $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s streaming and studio assets is expected to overshadow profit discussions, offering access to major franchises like Friends, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter. The deal, facing competition from Paramount Skydance\u2019s $108.4 billion offer, is expected to undergo prolonged regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix shares have risen 5% over the past year, underperforming the broader market due to a one-time $619 million tax in Brazil. The unresolved acquisition is likely to remain a source of volatility, with options markets pricing in a 7.3% move in either direction. Analysts remain divided: five 'Buy' ratings and two 'Hold' ratings. Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese maintained a 'Buy' but lowered her price target to $115, citing growth from international expansion and advertising, balanced against execution and deal risks. Full-year 2026 revenue is projected at $51.6 billion, slightly above consensus, with earnings per share near $3.24. The average analyst price target is $124.80 (41.7% upside), while GuruFocus estimates a more conservative $96.44 (9.5% upside). The consensus rating is 'Moderate Buy,' reflecting cautious optimism about Netflix\u2019s fundamentals and its progress in strengthening revenue generation. Long-term investors may view recent stock weakness as a potential buying opportunity.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 10:17 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/sv/nyheter/2026/01/18/netflix-resultatforhandsvisning-investerare-tittar-pa-reklam-omsattning-och-warner-bros-affar/)\n\n**Netflix Fourth-Quarter 2025 Outlook: Investors Focus on Advertising, Churn, and Warner Bros. Deal**\nNetflix is preparing to report fourth-quarter 2025 financial results, with investors focusing on whether the streaming giant can sustain revenue growth amid cooling momentum in U.S. subscribers and expanding strategic ambitions. Analysts expect modest improvements in profit and revenue, driven by international subscriber growth, higher prices, and increasing advertising contributions. IG Bank forecasts revenue of $11.97 billion for the quarter, a 16.8% year-over-year increase, with net profit estimated at $2.39 billion (up 27.7%) and earnings per share expected to rise 29.4% to $0.55. Advertising revenue is projected at $1.08 billion, reflecting rapid scaling of the ad-supported tier. Analysts predict 13% revenue growth for Netflix in 2026, signaling confidence in its evolving business model. International markets continue to drive subscriber growth, with estimates suggesting around 10 million net new users added, bringing the global user base above 327 million. While U.S. growth has slowed due to market saturation and competition, pricing power and monetization per user have become key investor metrics. Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and expanded operating margins, supported by price hikes, sustained ad-tier momentum, and disciplined content spending. Investors will closely monitor engagement, churn, and the impact of price increases on retention. Management noted that price increases were better absorbed than expected, with minimal impact on churn\u2014confirmation in the fourth quarter would reinforce confidence in Netflix\u2019s pricing flexibility. Advertising is expected to be a central theme, with the fourth quarter\u2019s holiday ad period offering clearer signals on advertiser spending and ad revenue growth. The content strategy continues to shift toward global, non-English-language originals to boost engagement and scale efficiency. The proposed $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery assets\u2014encompassing titles like Friends, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter\u2014will likely overshadow the earnings call, with investors seeking strategic rationale, integration plans, and regulatory risk assessments. The deal faces competition from Paramount Skydance, which has offered $108.4 billion. Regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe is expected to be intense, with the process likely lasting months. Netflix shares have risen about 5% over the past year, underperforming the broader market after a $619 million Brazilian tax hit in Q3. The unresolved Warner Bros. deal is expected to remain a source of volatility, with options markets pricing in a post-earnings move of approximately 7.3%, slightly above the historical average of 6.6%. After the last earnings report, shares dropped 10.1%. Analysts remain divided: five 'Buy' ratings and two 'Hold' ratings. Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese maintained a 'Buy' rating but lowered her price target to $115, citing international growth and ad progress tempered by execution and deal risks. Full-year 2025 revenue is expected to reach $51.6 billion, slightly above consensus, with earnings per share around $3.24. The average one-year price target from 43 analysts is $124.80, implying a 41.7% upside from current levels. GuruFocus offers a more conservative one-year value of $96.44, indicating a potential upside of about 9.5%. The consensus analyst rating remains 'Moderate Buy,' reflecting cautious optimism, with long-term investors viewing recent share weakness as a potential buying opportunity.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 10:17 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/nl/nieuws/2026/01/18/netflix-cijfers-vooruitblik-investeerders-kijken-naar-advertenties-verloop-en-warner-bros-deal/)\n\n**Netflix\u2019s Quarterly Report: Analysts Focus on Advertising Growth, Margins, and Strategic Expansion**\nNetflix is set to release its third-quarter 2025 financial results, following a 3.27% gain the previous day, closing at $1,238.56 and marking a 40% year-to-date increase. The stock peaked at $1,339 in late June before dropping over 8% amid investor concerns about overheating. Pre-market trading on the day of the report added another 0.30%. Over the past six consecutive quarters, Netflix has exceeded revenue and earnings-per-share expectations. For Q3 2025, analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast a 17.1% revenue growth, with total revenue expected to reach $11.51 billion and earnings per share estimated at $6.96. Annual revenue projections hover around $45 billion, driven primarily by anticipated advertising growth. In Q2 2025, revenue rose 16% year-over-year to approximately $11.08 billion, confirming sustained momentum. The focus will shift from subscriber counts to engagement metrics and advertising monetization. According to Filippo Diodovich, Senior Market Strategist at IG Italia, the emphasis is now on revenue growth, margins, advertising performance, and content effectiveness rather than subscriber numbers alone. Netflix\u2019s ad-supported strategy aims to reduce churn by offering a lower-cost option and generate ad revenue. Although Netflix no longer publicly discloses subscriber numbers, FactSet estimates a 4.3 million increase in subscribers for the quarter, with a significant portion from the ad-tier plan. Advertising revenue remains a small share of total revenue but is expected to grow steadily. A key development is Netflix\u2019s recent partnership with Amazon Ads, enabling Amazon\u2019s programmatic platform to access Netflix\u2019s audience, effective in Q4 2025. Netflix has set ambitious internal goals: doubling revenue by 2030, reaching a $1 trillion market cap, 400 million global subscribers, and tripling annual operating income from current levels of ~$10.4 billion. Alicia Reese of Wedbush Strategies stated, 'The ad engine at Netflix is starting to roar,' noting that ad revenue could become Netflix\u2019s primary income source by 2026. Diodovich anticipates that discussions will center on margin expansion and cash flow generation, emphasizing that Netflix must demonstrate that higher costs (content production, marketing, technology) are offset by stronger monetization, especially through ad-tier subscriptions. The company is also expanding into gaming, with plans to launch TV-based games during the holidays to boost engagement, though gaming remains non-core for revenue at this stage.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 09:35 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Italia](https://it.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/netflix-oggi-la-trimestrale-le-previsioni-degli-analisti-3049898)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
