- **Expert opinions:** 
  - Elina Ribakova (Kyiv School of Economics): Expects cuts to social spending, believes sanctions pressure should increase.
  - Chris Weafer (Macro-Advisory, Moscow-based analyst): **"Putin and the Kremlin are increasingly open to a peace deal soon due to growing economic pressure"** - This is speculation about openness to negotiation, not departure from presidency.
- **Quality:** High - specific economic data with named expert attribution. Note: Economic pressure doesn't directly translate to presidential departure.

**Moscow Times (September 18, 2025):**
- **Factual content:** Dmitry Kozak resigned as deputy chief of staff for "personal reasons," NYT reported he lost favor after objecting to 2022 Ukraine invasion.
- **Quality:** Medium-high - reports personnel change but doesn't indicate presidential instability.

**CNN (November 7, 2025):**
- **Factual content:** Lavrov absent from Security Council meeting Nov 5, Peskov denied reshuffle rumors Nov 7, Oreshkin appointed to lead G20 delegation instead of Lavrov, Budapest summit with Trump collapsed.
- **Quality:** High - documents specific events but Kremlin explicitly denied any change in Lavrov's status.

**Perplexity Agent Report:**
- **Factual content:** Comprehensive timeline of Putin's tenure, constitutional succession mechanisms (Art. 92-93), current term expires May 7, 2030, Mishustin is current PM.
- **Expert opinions:** CIA Director William Burns and MI6 chief Richard Moore stated "no evidence" Putin preparing exit (Legion Magazine, April 2025). Levada Center polling: 85% approval December 2025.
- **Quality:** High - synthesizes multiple credible sources with specific citations to intelligence assessments.

**Key factual baseline:** Putin's current term runs until May 7, 2030. Constitutional mechanisms for early departure are: (1) resignation, (2) sustained health inability, (3) impeachment (requiring two-thirds majorities in both chambers plus court concurrence). United Russia controls sufficient votes to block impeachment.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Russian/Soviet leaders leaving office early (1917-present):**
   - Only one voluntary early departure: Yeltsin (Dec 31, 1999) - resigned 6 months early
   - Deaths in office: Lenin, Stalin, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko
   - No impeachments ever
   - Suitability: **Medium** - small sample size (n≈10-12), different political systems

2. **Authoritarian leaders with constitutional term limits globally (2000-2026):**
   - Most either: (a) change constitution to extend terms, (b) serve full terms, (c) die in office, or (d) are overthrown
   - Very few voluntary early departures in stable authoritarian systems
   - Suitability: **Medium-High** - larger sample, but diverse contexts

3. **Putin's own historical behavior:**
   - Served every day of every term/role since 1999 (27 years)
   - Changed constitution rather than leave office (2020)
   - Zero precedent of early departure
   - Suitability: **High** - most directly relevant, though n=1

4. **Leaders who recently changed constitutions to extend rule:**
   - Xi Jinping (China, 2018), Alassane Ouattara (Côte d'Ivoire, 2020), Alpha Condé (Guinea, 2020 - later overthrown)
   - Pattern: constitutional changes indicate intention to stay, not leave
   - Suitability: **High** - directly comparable recent behavior

**Selected reference class:** Putin's own historical pattern combined with leaders who changed constitutions to extend rule. This suggests someone highly committed to remaining in power who has invested significant political capital (2020 referendum) to ensure legal continuity.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** From January 28, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **93 days** (approximately 3 months)

**Historical patterns over 3-month periods:**
- No Russian/Soviet leader has left office within a 3-month window except through death (sudden) or planned transition (Yeltsin announced resignation only days before)
- Putin has never taken extended absence or shown public incapacity in any 3-month period over 27 years
- The 2020 constitutional changes were specifically designed to keep Putin in office until 2036

**Recent developments (past 6 months from Jan 28, 2026):**
- Economic pressure mounting (DW article, September 2025)
- Personnel changes: Kozak resignation (September 2025), Lavrov absence rumors denied (November 2025)
- High approval ratings: 85% (Levada, December 2025)
- No credible reports of health crisis, coup plotting, or resignation plans

## (d) Justification

**Integrating factors for outside view:**

1. **Constitutional-legal framework:** Putin's term runs until 2030. Early departure requires either voluntary resignation, proven health incapacity, or impeachment. The 2020 amendments were specifically crafted to enable him to serve until 2036, demonstrating long-term intent.

2. **Historical precedent:** In 27 years of power, Putin has never departed early from any position. The only Russian leader to resign early (Yeltsin) did so after negotiating successor protections. Putin already has lifetime immunity, reducing resignation incentives.

3. **Current political stability:** 
   - Parliamentary control: United Russia blocks impeachment
   - Security apparatus: No credible reports of FSB/military defection
   - Public support: 85% approval (though state-influenced)
   - Elite cohesion: Personnel changes (Kozak, Lavrov rumors) show normal churn, not systemic crisis

4. **Intelligence assessments:** CIA and MI6 chiefs explicitly stated "no evidence" of exit planning (April 2025) - this is the most recent expert opinion from entities with access to classified information.

5. **Health speculation:** Persistent rumors but zero verifiable evidence. Western intelligence actively denies serious illness claims. No documented hospitalizations or extended absences.

6. **Economic pressure:** While mounting (budget deficit, sanctions), expert Chris Weafer suggests this makes Putin "open to peace deal," not resignation. Economic crisis alone rarely causes authoritarian departures without elite defection or popular uprising - neither is evident.

7. **Short timeframe:** 93 days is extremely short for political transitions in stable authoritarian systems. Even planned successions take months of visible preparation.

**Base rate calculation:**
- Putin's personal precedent: 0 early departures in 27 years across ~108 quarters = 0% per quarter
- Russian/Soviet leaders: 1 early resignation (Yeltsin) in ~30 leader-terms over 109 years, with most terms being 4-10 years. Yeltsin's resignation was in a 6-month window but was announced only days before. For a specific 3-month window: extremely rare, perhaps 0.1-0.5% historically
- Leaders who changed constitutions to extend rule: Very few leave voluntarily within years of the change, let alone months

## Outside view calibration:

The sources provide several anchors:

1. **Intelligence assessment anchor:** "No evidence" from CIA/MI6 (April 2025) suggests probability near zero from the perspective of agencies with the best information access.

2. **Historical frequency:** Even being generous and assuming one early departure per 100 leader-years in authoritarian systems, over a 3-month period this yields ~0.25% base rate.

3. **Putin-specific pattern:** 0 departures in 108 quarters = strong prior against departure in any given quarter.

4. **Recent constitutional investment:** The 2020 referendum represents massive political capital spent to stay in power. Departing within 6 years of that investment is highly unlikely.

**Calibration considerations:**

- **Black swan events:** Sudden death, stroke, heart attack are possible but: (a) no evidence of health crisis, (b) Putin is 73, not extraordinarily old, (c) has extensive medical team suggesting good monitoring.

- **Coup risk:** Personnel changes don't indicate imminent coup. Elite coups require coordination; no evidence exists. Even if plotted, execution within 93 days is unlikely.

- **Voluntary resignation:** Would require either: (a) health crisis forcing it, (b) negotiated succession. No preparation visible for either.

**Probability bounds:**
- Lower bound: Not zero (unexpected events always possible): >0.1%
- Upper bound: Should not exceed historical base rate for authoritarian leaders + small adjustment for age/stress: <3%
- Central estimate: Given strong negative evidence (intelligence assessments, no health crisis, high approval, constitutional commitment, zero historical precedent), probability should be very low.

**Calibration to true probability:**
The question asks for true probability, not hedged estimate. The evidence strongly points to continuation:
- 85% approval rating
- Intelligence agencies see no exit planning  
- No verifiable health crisis
- Constitutional framework designed for 2036
- 27-year pattern of never leaving early
- Only 93 days timeframe

A well-calibrated forecast should reflect that this is a very low probability event, likely in the 0.5-2% range. Given the strength of negative evidence and short timeframe, I lean toward the lower end.

Outside View Prediction:
**1%**

This reflects: (a) the extremely low historical base rate of authoritarian leaders who recently changed constitutions leaving office within months, (b) Putin's unbroken 27-year pattern of serving full terms, (c) explicit intelligence assessments of no exit planning, (d) absence of verifiable health crisis or elite revolt indicators, (e) the very short 93-day timeframe, while (f) acknowledging non-zero probability of black swan events (sudden death, unforeseen medical emergency, or rapid coup) that cannot be completely ruled out.
