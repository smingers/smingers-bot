## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (large prediction shifts):**

1. **Putin conducting normal presidential duties on January 28, 2026** (Peskov statements): Multiple meetings scheduled for today/tomorrow (al-Sharaa, Shmelëva reports). This is direct, contemporaneous evidence of Putin functioning as President on the day of this forecast.
   - **Direction:** Strongly against departure before May 1, 2026.

2. **Expert analysis explicitly stating no genuine successor preparation** (NEST Centre, September 2025): Identifiable experts (Pastukhov, Petrov) state transition designed for 2030, Putin retaining "full control," no successor being groomed.
   - **Direction:** Strongly against departure before May 1, 2026.

3. **Constitutional framework and recent behavior** (Outside view + September 2025 Putin speech): 2020 amendments allow rule until 2036; Putin discussing post-2036 succession in September 2025.
   - **Direction:** Strongly against departure before May 1, 2026.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Active diplomatic engagement** (ISW, Al Jazeera, BBC, January 2026): Putin meeting US envoys, negotiating Ukraine peace terms, engaging with Syrian leadership. This shows ongoing presidential activity.
   - **Direction:** Against departure before May 1, 2026.

2. **Glukhovsky assessment** (January 28, 2026): Kremlin critic states Putin "does everything to avoid having a clear successor."
   - **Direction:** Against departure before May 1, 2026.
   - **Note:** Oppositional source, but aligns with other evidence.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Kadyrov health speculation**: While extensively reported, this concerns Chechen regional succession, not Putin's presidency. No direct causal link to Putin leaving office.
   - **Direction:** Neutral/irrelevant.

2. **Economic pressure** (Outside view, September 2025): Expert Chris Weafer suggested Putin "open to peace deal" due to economic pressure, not resignation.
   - **Direction:** Neutral - economic stress doesn't directly predict presidential departure in authoritarian systems without elite defection.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** January 28, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **93 days** (3.1 months)

**If timeframe halved to ~46 days (mid-March 2026):**
- Probability would decrease slightly (perhaps 0.5-0.7%) because shorter window means less time for unexpected events (sudden health crisis, coup).
- However, the evidence is so strong against departure that the change would be minimal.

**If timeframe doubled to ~186 days (late July 2026):**
- Probability would increase moderately (perhaps 2-3%) because:
  - More time for black swan health events
  - 2026 State Duma elections (mentioned in NEST Centre article) could theoretically trigger unexpected political dynamics
  - Longer window for unforeseen coup attempts
- However, even 6 months is short for authoritarian transitions without visible preparation.

**Key temporal factor:** The NEST Centre article explicitly identifies the 2026 State Duma elections as an "important stage" in a transition process designed to complete by **2030**, not 2026. This suggests any political reshuffling in 2026 would be within Putin's continued presidency, not a departure from it.

## (d) Justification

**Factors shifting from outside view base rate (1%):**

**Factors arguing for LOWER probability (<1%):**

1. **Contemporaneous evidence of active presidency (January 28, 2026):** Putin is conducting normal presidential business TODAY. He has scheduled meetings tomorrow (al-Sharaa). This is the strongest possible evidence against imminent departure - we have real-time confirmation he is functioning as President at the start of the prediction window.

2. **Expert consensus on 2030 timeline:** The NEST Centre analysis (September 2025) by identifiable Russian politics experts explicitly states the transition process is designed for completion by 2030, with Putin retaining "full control" and no genuine successor. This directly contradicts any scenario where Putin leaves before May 2026.

3. **No visible succession preparation:** Unlike Yeltsin's 1999 resignation (which involved months of visible preparation, Yeltsin's declining health, and Putin's appointment as PM in August 1999 before December resignation), there is zero evidence of succession mechanics being activated.

4. **Constitutional investment:** Putin spent massive political capital on the 2020 referendum to enable rule until 2036. Departing 6 years later (and only 4.25 months into the prediction window) would render this investment pointless.

**Factors arguing for HIGHER probability (>1%):**

1. **Age and health uncertainty:** Putin is 73. While no verified health crisis exists, sudden medical events (stroke, heart attack) become more probable with age. However, the outside view already incorporated this via base rates for leaders in this age range.

2. **Ukraine war stress:** The ongoing conflict creates potential for unexpected developments (major battlefield loss, elite defection). However, current evidence (January 2026 negotiations) shows Putin actively managing the situation, not being overwhelmed by it.

**Calibration decision:**

The contemporaneous evidence (Putin functioning as President on January 28, 2026) combined with expert analysis stating no succession preparation until 2030 provides **stronger negative evidence** than the outside view base rate already incorporated. The outside view used historical patterns of authoritarian leaders who changed constitutions; the current evidence shows Putin specifically is following this pattern with explicit 2030 timeline.

However, I must be cautious about overconfidence. The outside view base rate of 1% already reflects very low probability. Moving significantly below this (e.g., to 0.3%) would require near-certainty, which is inappropriate given:
- Black swan events (sudden death) remain possible
- Intelligence assessments (CIA/MI6 "no evidence") are from April 2025, now 9 months old
- Authoritarian systems can collapse rapidly once elite defection begins

**Calibrated adjustment:** The strong contemporaneous evidence and expert consensus on 2030 timeline warrant a **slight decrease** from the 1% outside view, but not a dramatic one. The evidence confirms the outside view rather than contradicting it.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate from outside view:** 1%

**Adjustment factors:**
- **Strong negative evidence** (Putin functioning today, expert consensus on 2030, no succession prep): -0.3%
- **Maintaining uncertainty floor** (black swan events, age-related health risks): +0.1%

**Calibrated inside view:** 0.8%

**Reasoning:** The inside view evidence strongly confirms the outside view base rate. Putin is demonstrably functioning as President today (January 28, 2026), expert analysis explicitly states transition designed for 2030, and no succession mechanisms are visible. However, I maintain probability above 0.5% because:
1. Sudden health events cannot be ruled out at age 73
2. Rapid authoritarian collapses, while rare, do occur
3. 93 days is enough time for unforeseen black swan events

**Probability check:** "0.8 out of 100 times, Putin ceases to be President before May 1, 2026" = 1 in 125 odds. This feels appropriate given the overwhelming evidence against departure but acknowledging non-zero tail risks.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Putin cease being Russian President between now (Jan 28, 2026) and May 1, 2026 (93 days)?
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria (any cessation: death, resignation, removal, incapacity).

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 1% based on authoritarian leaders who changed constitutions + Putin's 27-year pattern.
   - ✓ Inside view (0.8%) is rooted to this base rate with modest adjustment justified by contemporaneous evidence.

3. **Consistency:** "0.8 out of 100 times, Putin ceases to be President before May 1, 2026."
   - ✓ This makes sense: extremely rare event, but not impossible given age and authoritarian system risks.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Putin conducting presidential meetings on January 28, 2026 (today) - factually verified
   - Expert analysis (NEST Centre) stating transition designed for 2030, not 2026 - identifiable experts
   - No visible succession preparation or health crisis - confirmed by intelligence assessments (April 2025)
   - Constitutional framework allows rule until 2036 - factual
   - ✓ All evidence pieces are factually valid and consistently point in same direction.

5. **Blind spot:** Sudden catastrophic health event (massive stroke, heart attack) that incapacitates Putin within 93 days. While no evidence suggests imminent health crisis, this remains the most plausible scenario for my forecast to be wrong. If this occurred, probability should have been 2-3% rather than 0.8%.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is Putin remaining President through his term (until 2030). The current situation shows low volatility (normal diplomatic activity, no elite defection signals, high approval ratings). This reinforces keeping probability very low.

Probability: 0.8%
