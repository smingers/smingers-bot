- **Relevance**: Most comprehensive assessment; expert consensus is Putin extremely likely to remain

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Russian/Soviet leaders leaving office early (1917-present)**
   - Deaths in office: Lenin (1924), Stalin (1953), Brezhnev (1982), Andropov (1984), Chernenko (1985)
   - Voluntary resignation: Yeltsin (1999) - only one case
   - Forced removal: None via constitutional means
   - **Suitability**: Medium - Limited sample, different political systems
   - **Base rate**: ~1 voluntary early exit in 25 years of post-Soviet presidency = ~4% per year, or ~5% over 15 months

2. **Authoritarian leaders with constitutional term resets globally**
   - Examples: Xi Jinping (China, 2018 term limits removed), Nazarbayev (Kazakhstan, ruled 1990-2019, resigned voluntarily), Mugabe (Zimbabwe, forced out 2017), various Central Asian leaders
   - **Suitability**: Medium-High - Similar political structures
   - **Base rate**: Rare for leaders to leave voluntarily mid-term after securing legal ability to continue; usually exit via death, coup, or revolution

3. **Putin's specific tenure pattern (2000-2026)**
   - Has never resigned or shown intention to resign early
   - Engineered legal changes to maintain power (2008 PM role, 2020 term reset)
   - **Suitability**: High - Most specific to individual
   - **Base rate**: 0 early exits in 26 years; demonstrated pattern of power retention

4. **Leaders under economic stress maintaining power**
   - Venezuela (Maduro), North Korea (Kim dynasty), Iran (various leaders), Zimbabwe (Mugabe until 2017)
   - **Suitability**: Medium - Shows economic crisis alone rarely causes departure
   - **Base rate**: High survival rate despite economic pressure when security apparatus loyal

**Most suitable reference class**: Combination of #2 (authoritarian leaders with term resets) and #3 (Putin's specific pattern), weighted toward #3 given individual-specific nature of question.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 93 days (January 28, 2026 to May 1, 2026) = ~3 months

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Putin has governed continuously since August 1999 (26.5 years)
- In any given 3-month period over 26 years, he has never left office early
- The only Russian/Soviet leader to resign voluntarily (Yeltsin) did so after extended health problems and explicit succession planning with Putin as chosen successor
- Recent 3-month periods show:
  - Economic stress (Sep-Nov 2025) → policy adjustments but no leadership change
  - Personnel changes (Kozak resignation Sep 2025, Lavrov absence Nov 2025) → managed transitions, not instability
  - High approval ratings maintained (85% Dec 2025)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Current term doesn't expire until May 2030 (4+ years away)
- No elections scheduled before May 1, 2026
- Constitutional mechanisms (impeachment) require lengthy process incompatible with 3-month window
- No evidence of succession planning or transition preparation

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Legal framework**: The 2020 constitutional amendments created an explicit legal pathway for Putin to remain until 2036. He is only ~2 years into a 6-year term ending in 2030. There is no legal pressure for departure.

**Historical precedent**: In 26+ years of Putin's leadership, there has been zero instances of voluntary early resignation, health-based stepping down, or forced removal. The only post-Soviet precedent (Yeltsin 1999) involved explicit succession planning with a chosen successor—no evidence of this exists now.

**Current conditions vs. historical triggers**:
- **Health**: Western intelligence (CIA, MI6) explicitly states "no evidence" of serious illness as of 2025. While rumors persist, they are unsubstantiated.
- **Elite consensus**: Recent personnel changes (Kozak, Lavrov speculation) show managed transitions, not fractures. No credible reports of coup plotting or organized opposition within security services.
- **Economic pressure**: While significant (4.2T ruble deficit, VAT increases), expert Chris Weafer discusses this as pressure toward policy change (peace deal), not regime change. Historical cases (Venezuela, Iran, North Korea) show economic stress alone rarely topples leaders with loyal security apparatus.
- **Public pressure**: 85% approval rating (Levada, Dec 2025) suggests no mass mobilization threat.
- **Constitutional mechanisms**: Impeachment requires 2/3 supermajority in both chambers—United Russia controls blocking share. Virtually impossible in 3-month window.

**Mechanisms for departure by May 1, 2026**:
1. **Sudden death**: Actuarially, Putin (age ~73 in 2026) has ~2-3% annual mortality risk for his age/gender; over 3 months ≈ 0.5-0.75%
2. **Catastrophic health event**: Unsubstantiated by intelligence; adds perhaps 0.5-1%
3. **Coup/forced removal**: Low probability given security control; perhaps 1-2%
4. **Voluntary resignation**: No evidence of planning; perhaps 0.5-1%
5. **Impeachment**: Virtually impossible in 3 months; <0.5%

**Aggregate probability**: Summing these pathways suggests 3-5% chance of departure by May 1, 2026.

**Tethering to source data**:
- Reference class of authoritarian leaders with term resets: very low annual exit rate (<5%)
- Putin-specific pattern: 0% over 26 years
- Expert consensus (CIA, MI6, analysts): "overwhelmingly likely to remain"
- 3-month window is only 0.95% of Putin's 26-year tenure—extremely short timeframe

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from the most relevant reference class (Putin's own 26-year pattern) is 0%. However, this must be adjusted upward to account for:

1. **Non-zero actuarial risk**: Even healthy 73-year-olds face ~0.6% quarterly mortality
2. **Black swan events**: Unforeseen health crises, accidents, or political shocks
3. **Epistemic humility**: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence for low-probability events

However, adjustments should be modest because:
- Expert intelligence assessments explicitly state no evidence of health problems or exit planning
- All structural factors (legal, political, security, public opinion) favor continuation
- The 3-month window is exceptionally short for political transitions requiring coordination
- Recent events (economic stress, personnel changes) show managed adaptation, not crisis

**Calibration considerations**:
- 1% would imply 1-in-100 odds—roughly consistent with actuarial death risk alone
- 5% would imply 1-in-20 odds—seems too high given explicit intelligence assessments of health and stability
- 2-3% range accounts for death risk plus modest probability of unforeseen events

**Tethering**: The Perplexity report's conclusion that Putin is "overwhelmingly likely to remain" suggests probability of departure well below 10%. Expert consensus and structural analysis point to low single digits.
