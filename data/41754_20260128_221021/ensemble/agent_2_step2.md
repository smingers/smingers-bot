Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

**Historical/Context Sources:**
1. **CSIS Event (2008)**: Historical event announcement about Medvedev succession - not relevant to 2026 question.
2. **ISW Article (Jan 24, 2026)**: High-quality military analysis showing Putin actively engaged in negotiations on Jan 22-23, 2026. Shows Putin functioning as president with no indication of departure. **Factual**: Meeting details, delegation compositions. **Opinion**: ISW's assessment of Kremlin manipulation tactics.
3. **NEST Centre Report (Sept 16, 2025)**: Academic analysis by Pastukhov & Petrov describing Putin's transition plan designed to complete by **2030**, not 2026. **Key fact**: No genuine successor being prepared; Putin retains "full control" while altering system. **Opinion**: Comparison to late Stalinist period.
4. **Al Jazeera (Jan 25, 2026)**: Recent reporting on Abu Dhabi peace talks. **Factual**: Talks occurred, delegations present. **Opinions from identifiable sources**: Igor Novikov (former Zelenskyy adviser) and Oleksandr Khara (Centre for Defence Strategies) both skeptical but discussing war end, not Putin's presidency.
5. **Small Wars Journal (Jan 1, 2026)**: Analysis of Russia's Africa operations - no relevance to Putin's presidency status.
6. **BBC (Jan 15, 2026)**: Ukraine energy crisis reporting. **Factual**: Emergency declaration, power outages. **Opinions**: Trump's comments about Zelenskyy, Peskov's response. No indication of Putin departure.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 2026):**
7. **Dmitry Glukhovsky interview (Jan 28, 2026)**: Russian critic states "Putin does everything to avoid having a clear successor." **Opinion from identifiable source** but confirms no succession imminent.
8. **Multiple Peskov statements (Jan 28, 2026)**: Putin receiving reports, conducting meetings with Syrian leader al-Sharaa. **Strong factual evidence**: Putin actively functioning as president on Jan 28, 2026.
9. **Kadyrov health reports (Jan 11-27, 2026)**: Multiple sources report Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in critical condition with kidney failure, succession planning underway. **Factual**: Kadyrov hospitalized, son Adam in accident. **Relevance**: This is about Kadyrov, not Putin - Putin remains president throughout.
10. **Putin succession speech (Sept 18, 2025)**: Putin discussing future successors from war veterans, constitutional amendments allowing tenure until 2036. **Factual**: Putin planning long-term, no indication of near-term departure.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence AGAINST Putin ceasing to be president before May 1, 2026:**
- **Multiple independent sources (Peskov statements, ISW, BBC, Al Jazeera)** confirm Putin actively functioning as president on Jan 22-28, 2026 - conducting diplomatic meetings, receiving reports, engaging in peace negotiations
- **Structural/institutional factors**: NEST Centre analysis confirms transition plan designed for 2030 completion, constitutional amendments allow Putin to remain until 2036, no successor being prepared
- **Historical patterns**: Authoritarian leaders with Putin's level of control rarely exit within 3-month windows absent acute crises

**Moderate Evidence AGAINST:**
- **Glukhovsky's expert opinion**: Putin deliberately avoiding clear successor indicates intention to remain
- **Economic pressures and elite dissent**: Present but insufficient to force exit in 3-month timeframe based on historical patterns

**Weak Evidence FOR (extremely minimal):**
- **Kadyrov health crisis**: While creating succession uncertainty in Chechnya, this is a regional matter and doesn't directly threaten Putin's presidency. If anything, it demonstrates Putin's continued control over succession planning even for subordinates.
- **Speculative health rumors**: No credible, verifiable evidence of Putin's incapacitation

**Evidence Weight Assessment:**
The overwhelming weight of evidence points to Putin actively serving as president with no credible indicators of imminent departure. The timeframe is critically short (3 months), and all recent evidence (within days of today's date) shows Putin functioning normally.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Current timeframe**: January 28, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **93 days / ~3 months**

**If halved to 1.5 months**: Would slightly decrease probability - even less time for any crisis to develop and resolve with Putin's departure.

**If doubled to 6 months**: Would moderately increase probability - more time for potential health crisis, elite coup, or unexpected events. However, still extremely unlikely given:
- No credible succession planning for near-term
- Putin's demonstrated control and active functioning
- Structural barriers to sudden leadership change

The short timeframe is crucial - sudden leadership changes in stable authoritarian regimes over 3-month periods are exceptionally rare absent visible crisis triggers, none of which are currently present.

## (d) Justification:

**Factors maintaining low base rate:**
1. **Recent confirmatory evidence (Jan 22-28, 2026)**: Putin conducting high-level diplomatic meetings, receiving reports, functioning normally as president within the past week
2. **Institutional design**: NEST Centre analysis explicitly states transition planned for 2030, constitutional framework allows tenure until 2036
3. **No credible succession mechanism**: Glukhovsky confirms Putin avoiding clear successor
4. **Historical precedent**: Zero cases of Russian presidents departing within 3-month windows absent acute visible crises

**Factors that could increase probability (but are absent):**
- Credible health crisis reports (not present for Putin, only Kadyrov)
- Elite coup indicators (not present)
- Mass protests or political instability (not present)
- Constitutional crisis or impeachment proceedings (not present)

**Adjustment from 1.3% outside view:**
The recent evidence (within days of today) showing Putin actively functioning actually strengthens the outside view. However, I must account for:
- **Black swan potential**: Sudden health events, assassinations, or unforeseen crises can occur
- **Information opacity**: Russia's authoritarian system could conceal developing crises
- **3-month window**: While short, not impossible for sudden events

The evidence does not warrant increasing from the 1.3% base rate. If anything, the very recent confirmatory evidence (Jan 28, 2026) of Putin's active functioning suggests the probability should remain at or slightly below this level.

## Probability Calibration:

Starting from 1.3% outside view base rate:

**Adjustments:**
- Recent evidence of Putin functioning normally (Jan 28, 2026): -0.2% (strengthens status quo)
- Short 3-month timeframe: No adjustment (already factored in base rate)
- Kadyrov crisis creating regional instability: +0.1% (minimal indirect risk)
- Information opacity in authoritarian regime: +0.3% (accounting for unknown unknowns)

**Final calibration**: 1.5%

This reflects:
- 98.5% confidence Putin remains president (odds of ~66:1)
- 1.5% accounting for black swan events, hidden health crises, or unforeseen circumstances
- Appropriate humility given information limitations in authoritarian systems

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Putin cease being Russian President between now (Jan 28, 2026) and May 1, 2026 (93 days)?
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria

2. **Base rate**: 1.3% from outside view
   - ✓ Final prediction (1.5%) rooted in this base rate with minimal adjustment

3. **Consistency**: "1.5 out of 100 times, Putin ceases to be president within 93 days despite actively functioning as president, having constitutional protection until 2036, and no credible succession plan."
   - ✓ Makes sense given extreme rarity of such events and current evidence

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Putin conducting diplomatic meetings Jan 22-28, 2026 (factual, strong)
   - NEST Centre: transition designed for 2030, no successor prepared (factual, strong)
   - Constitutional amendments allow tenure until 2036 (factual, strong)
   - Glukhovsky: Putin avoiding clear successor (expert opinion, moderate)
   - Zero historical precedent for 3-month departures absent visible crisis (strong)
   - ✓ All verified as factually sound

5. **Blind spot**: Sudden severe health crisis (stroke, heart attack) concealed initially then forcing resignation. This could increase probability to 5-8% if credible evidence emerged, but none exists currently.

6. **Status quo**: Putin remains president - extremely stable situation with 93-day window. Recent evidence (within week) confirms status quo strongly maintained.
   - ✓ Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated

Probability: 1.5%
