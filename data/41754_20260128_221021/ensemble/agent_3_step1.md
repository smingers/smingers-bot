Analysis:
1. Source analysis:
 • Europarl Think Tank (May 27, 2020): This institutional report details the constitutional amendments initiated by Putin that reset presidential term limits. Its factual reporting—about the legislative process and referendum details—is strong and objective. It does not include opinions beyond basic assessments of legality and political intent.
 • Al Jazeera summary (undated, summarizing actions from early 2020–2021): This piece provides facts (e.g., signing of the law, extension of potential tenure) but suffers from formatting and clarity issues. Its core factual content aligns with other independent accounts.
 • NPR Article (July 1, 2020): A clear, well-sourced report describing the referendum results and constitutional changes. It distinguishes between hard facts (ballot percentages, term reset) and contextual comments (opinions on legitimacy), making it a reliable factual anchor.
 • DW Economic Woes article (Sept 2025): This source presents both factual economic indicators (rising deficits, falling oil revenue, reduced GDP growth) and expert opinions (e.g., from Elina Ribakova, Chris Weafer) forecasting that economic stress might eventually pressure the Kremlin. However, direct linkage to a presidency change is not claimed; the discussion is about underlying economic pressures.
 • The Moscow Times article (Sept 18, 2025): It reports Dmitry Kozak’s resignation. While this is a tangible personnel shift, it is presented as part of internal reshuffling – not a coup or movement against Putin’s presidency. Its factual content regarding dates and roles is solid, though it is more of an indicator of minor administrative change.
 • CNN report (Nov 07, 2025): This covers the unusual absence of Sergey Lavrov from a meeting, contextualizing it as normal within Kremlin patterns. It explains that brief absences do not portend political upheaval. Its mix of reported facts and the Kremlin’s denials adds moderate credibility.
 • The composite Agent Report (synthesizing historical tenure, constitutional details, legal pathways, expert opinions, and health rumors) is useful because it integrates multiple sources, outlining legally defined pathways (resignation, health incapacity, impeachment, elite coup) and noting that none have compelling evidence to suggest a near-term end to Putin’s presidency.
 In all, the factual backbone across these sources is robust, with expert opinions identified when available. The primary objective facts—constitutional adjustments, procedural rules (Articles 92 and 93), and historical precedent—categorically support the view that only extraordinary circumstances (a severe health collapse, a sudden elite revolt, or mass public upheaval) would change the outcome.

2. Reference class analysis:
 • One class is authoritarian incumbents with extended tenures; historically, authoritarian leaders in regimes with controlled political systems (and with constitutional amendments favoring continuity) rarely lose office unexpectedly unless a catastrophic event occurs.
 • Another reference class is post-Soviet Russian leaders: while some, like Yeltsin, resigned before term end, Putin’s institutional environment (legal mechanisms, controlled elections, elite loyalty) makes his early departure much less likely.
 Among these, the authoritarian-incumbent class is most suitable because it encapsulates the systemic barriers to an early exit even when economic or political pressures arise.

3. Timeframe analysis:
 The prediction timeframe spans from today (January 28, 2026) to May 1, 2026 – roughly a three‐month period. Historically, significant leadership changes in Russian presidency occur either suddenly in times of national crisis or as part of an orchestrated transition with ample lead time. In stable authoritarian regimes, sudden exits outside of crises (e.g., severe health issues or overt elite coups) over a short span such as three months are exceptionally rare.

4. Justification:
 Integrating the above factors:
  – The constitutional framework (Articles 92 and 93) provides legal exit paths, but these require either a catastrophic health event, enormous elite conspiracy, or mass popular protest—all of which lack credible, concrete indicators currently.
  – Expert analyses (e.g., assessments by Western intelligence and specialized commentators) uniformly indicate no credible evidence that Putin intends to or will be forced to step down before May 1, 2026.
  – Historical precedent shows that political transitions under similar regimes rarely occur in such calm periods without an acute trigger.
  – Although economic and minor elite dissent signals exist (e.g., DW economic pressures, Kozak’s resignation), these factors alone are insufficient to force a presidential exit within a three‐month horizon.
 Thus, the aggregate external evidence drives an externally calibrated prediction that makes an early exit before May 1, 2026 extremely unlikely.

Outside view calibration:
 • The sources provide indirect base rates for leadership turnover in similar authoritarian regimes, which are very low absent crises.
 • Experts, quoting intelligence sources and internal party dynamics, consistently rate the probability of an early exit (via resignation, health crisis, impeachment, or coup) as almost negligible.
 • Considering that Putin’s legal adjustments and overwhelming control through loyalist institutions have so far ensured continuity—and with no verifiable indication of a breaking point impending within the next three months—the base rate probability of his exit in this period can be anchored below 2%.
 • Small differences matter: If, for example, we assign a 1% chance to such a rare event, then even a slight deviation upward (say, 2–3%) would represent very significant odds in context. In this case, credible sources and historical patterns strongly favor odds on the low side.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 1.3% probability (to a 1% significance level) that Vladimir Putin will cease to be the President of the Russian Federation before May 1, 2026.
