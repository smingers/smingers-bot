Analysis:
We framed the forecasting question as “Will Vladimir Putin cease to be the President of the Russian Federation before May 1, 2026?” This covers a 93‐day period from January 28, 2026. Our outside view draws on historical reference classes and institutional factors: over more than 26 years Putin has managed to remain in power through constitutional changes in 2020 that effectively allow him to serve until 2036; there has never been an early exit in his tenure, and established procedures (impeachment, coup or voluntary resignation) have been all but absent. The current news from sources such as ISW, the Nest Centre analysis, and expert quotes in the Asknews articles confirm that while there is ongoing succession chatter and some concerns (as seen in debates on potential successors and comments about “avoiding a clear successor”), none of these sources present a credible mechanism that would force Putin out between now and May 1, 2026.

(a) Source analysis:
 – The CSIS event announcement and Nest Centre article (both historical/review analysis) consistently emphasize that current transitions serve to modify the system rather than prepare a genuine successor.
 – The ISW assessment and Al Jazeera, BBC, and Reuters pieces indicate active negotiations over the Ukraine conflict that show Putin’s active role as President.
 – The Asknews articles recount multiple reported discussions on succession and health, but despite colorful language in outlets like Focus, RIA, and Neue Zürcher Zeitung, direct evidence from experts (e.g., CIA Director Burns, MI6’s Moore, and polling records showing high approval) and structural-legal factors (2020 amendments, the improbability of impeachment given the supermajority requirement) support the view that the regime is built to last.
Overall, the independent reputable sources (BBC, Reuters, ISW) and expert assessments indicate strong institutional inertia, even as anecdotal rumors wind their way through the media.

(b) Evidence analysis:
 – Strong evidence: Putin’s record (zero early exits over 26+ years), legal framework (2020 constitutional changes) and expert opinions (CIA, MI6, Levada Center) support a very low probability of departure.
 – Moderate evidence: Speculative health concerns and remarks such as “Putin does everything to avoid having a clear successor” add a very minor tail-risk.
 – Weak evidence: Stories from some tabloids or low-context speculation about succession in Chechnya do not meaningfully shift the overall picture.
Thus, while there is an unavoidable base risk (primarily from the actuarial likelihood of a sudden health event or an unforeseen coup), this remains very low in a 3‐month window.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
 – Prediction timeframe is 93 days (January 28 – May 1, 2026). Over such a short period, historical precedent plus the strong legal-institutional framework make an early exit extremely unlikely. If the window were halved, our forecast probability would drop further; if doubled (to 6 months), it might only increase marginally because even a six-month period is very short compared to Putin’s historical pattern.

(d) Justification:
 – The legal mechanisms from 2020 allow Putin to continue until 2036.
 – Historical precedent is nearly 0% for early exits in his 26-year tenure.
 – Intelligence assessments and national polling (≈85% approval) provide additional support.
 – While rumors and succession debates appear in the media, they stem more from elite maneuvering and should not be seen as genuine signals of destabilization.
Each of these factors reinforces our outside view base rate, adjusted only slightly for natural attrition risk (sudden health event, coup, or resignation) within a short 3-month window. The final inside view prediction remains very low.

Probability calibration:
Based on the above, our base rate from historical precedent is effectively near 0%, adjusted upward modestly by an actuarial risk and low-probability black swan events. This yields an inside view probability on the order of 3%—meaning that 3 out of 100 times, we’d expect Putin to cease being President by May 1, 2026.

Checklist:
1. Title & Resolution: “Will Putin cease to be President before May 1, 2026?” within 93 days. Our variables and timeframe align exactly.
2. Outside View Base Rate: Historically near 0%; adjusted to ~3% given minor exogenous risks.
3. Consistency Check: “3 out of 100 times, Putin ceases to be President before May 1, 2026.” This aligns with our structured reasoning.
4. Key Evidence:
 • Putin’s continuous tenure (26+ years, zero early exits).
 • Legal framework (2020 constitutional amendments).
 • Expert assessments (CIA, MI6, Levada polling) indicating stability.
5. Blind-spot Statement: A sudden, catastrophic health collapse or unexpected coup would render our forecast overly optimistic—this would likely shift probabilities upward.
6. Status Quo Outcome: The regime’s historical inertia and structural regime protections favor status quo, supporting a very low adjustment.

Probability: 3%
