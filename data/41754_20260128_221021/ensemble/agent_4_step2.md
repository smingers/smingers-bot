Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. Asknews packet (28 Jan 2026, multiple Russian & international wires).  
   • Facts: Kremlin diary shows Putin meeting Syrian president, hearing reports, sending greetings. Peskov dismisses rumours of Ukrainian draft peace documents.  
   • Opinions: Kremlin critic Glukhovsky (“Putin avoids a clear successor”) – identifiable but exiled novelist, not insider. Reiterovich (UA polit-analyst) calls US optimism “fantastical”.  
   • Quality: Mixed. Official wires (RIA, TASS, Anadolu, RBC) reliable on “who met whom” diary items; low on evaluative truth. Commentary pieces are opinion.

2. ISW campaign assessment (24 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Putin chaired Moscow meeting with US envoys; Russian demands in talks.  
   • Opinion: ISW analytic line that Kremlin is stalling. Good methodological transparency; moderate quality.

3. BBC (15 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Russian strikes, Zelensky emergency decree, Trump/Peskov quotes.  
   • Opinion: None material to Putin tenure. High editorial reliability.

4. Small Wars Journal (1 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Russian deployments in Africa; historic timeline.  
   • Opinion: Authors foresee “peak Russia”. Academic piece; moderate quality, not germane to Kremlin stability before May.

5. Pastukhov & Petrov report (16 Sep 2025, New Eurasian Strategies).  
   • Facts: Personnel reshuffles 2023-25, creation of veterans’ bodies.  
   • Opinion: Regime entering “autopilot”. Well-known Russian political scientists; moderate to high credibility.

6. Legacy CSIS event blurb (≈2008). Obsolete for forecast window.

(b) Evidence weighting toward “Putin leaves office before 1 May 2026”

Strong evidence (pushes probability downward)  
S1. Structural entrenchment: 2020 “zeroing” amendment + near-total elite control; removal requires coup/health shock. (Multiple legal sources)  
S2. Observable activity: Daily Kremlin agenda, foreign meetings, public addresses in Jan 2026 show Putin physically active and in command (RIA, TASS, Anadolu, ISW).  

Moderate evidence (both directions)  
M1. Active war & sanctions raise coup stress modestly above baseline (ISW, BBC) – upward.  
M2. No groomed successor; personalised regime often brittle if sudden health failure occurs (Pastukhov report, Glukhovsky interview) – upward.  
M3. Persistent but unverified health rumour mill; zero confirmation from hard sources; actuarial age 73 (generic life-table) – small upward.

Weak evidence  
W1. Chechen leader Kadyrov’s illness; could ripple but highly indirect – negligible.  
W2. Speculative Western media on “near peace deal” or “Putin immortality” – ignored.

Net evidence balance: strong downward forces dominate; moderate upward forces add ~1-2 pp.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until deadline: 94 (0.26 yr).  
Halving to 47 days would almost halve probability (≈2 %).  
Doubling to ~6 months would roughly double to 7-8 %, still low because risk growth is roughly linear at this horizon for ageing/coup processes.

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (long-serving personalist autocrats) for 0.26 yr: 3 %.  
Adjustments:  
–0.5 pp for clear evidence of routine functioning & elite cohesion (S2).  
+1 pp for elevated stress from war plus age/rumours (M1+M3).  
Net +0.5 pp ⇒ 3.5 %, rounded to 4 %.  
Current context therefore remains highly analogous to reference class; no factor large enough to override it.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 4 out of every 100 parallel universes between now and 1 May 2026 end with Putin no longer president.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement: Will Putin stop being RF president before 1 May 2026 (94 days left)?  
2. Base rate 3 %.  
3. Consistency check: “4/100 times Putin leaves office” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Entrenched constitutional & security control (down).  
   – Active public schedule in Jan 2026 (down).  
   – Ongoing war increases coup stress (up).  
   – Unconfirmed health rumours, age 73 (up).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden medical event (stroke/assassination) already tomorrow; would swing probability but is inherently unpredictable.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; short window and present stability justify it.

Probability: 4%
