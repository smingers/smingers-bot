Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
  
1. European Parliament Think-Tank brief (May 2020).  
   • Facts: chronology and content of the 2020 constitutional amendments.  
   • Opinion: warns of “growing risk” of backlash; clearly labelled.  
   • Quality: high—non-partisan research arm of EU legislature; cites primary Russian documents.  

2. Al-Jazeera / Human-Rights portal (Apr 2021 law).  
   • Facts: Putin signed statute resetting term count; past referendum result (78 %).  
   • Opinion: critics call it a “power grab” (attributed, not anonymous).  
   • Quality: mainstream international outlet; facts cross-check with Russian gazette.  

3. NPR (July 2020).  
   • Facts: final referendum figures, list of amendments.  
   • Opinion: opposition claims of fraud flagged as such.  
   • Quality: reputable U.S. public broadcaster; good factual accuracy.  

4. DW (Sept 2025).  
   • Facts: deficit, VAT hike, falling oil revenue, defence spending.  
   • Opinions: economists Ribakova & Weafer speculate budget pressure could move Kremlin toward peace. Identifiable experts.  
   • Quality: high; data sourced to Russian Finance Ministry and IMF.  

5. The Moscow Times (18 Sept 2025).  
   • Facts: resignation of Dmitry Kozak, Kremlin confirmation.  
   • Opinion: NYT claim that Kozak fell out over Ukraine is attributed.  
   • Quality: respected independent Russian outlet; factual element easily verifiable.  

6. CNN (7 Nov 2025).  
   • Facts: Lavrov’s absence, Putin decree naming Oreshkin, Peskov denial.  
   • Opinion: none beyond noting speculation.  
   • Quality: mainstream international media; relies on official documents & on-record statements.  

7. Agent_report (synthesised 28 Jan 2026).  
   • Collates open-source information, quotes Archigos-type statistics and Levada polling.  
   • Opinion: provides probability narrative; author is unnamed but data points are checkable.  
   • Quality: useful compendium; treat analytic judgements cautiously, treat cited facts as pointers to originals.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes (all post-1945, unless noted otherwise):  
1. Personalist/authoritarian leaders in power >10 years (N≈110).  
   – Annual exit hazard ≈ 6 % (Geddes et al. 2018).  
   – Suitability: captures regime type and tenure length; ignores wartime stress.  

2. Same group, but leaders actively conducting a large interstate war (N≈25).  
   – Annual hazard rises to ≈ 10 % (data from Croco & Weeks 2022).  
   – Suitability: add current Ukraine context.  

3. Russian/Soviet heads of state since 1917 (N=12 individuals, 29 leader-years after Stalin).  
   – Annual hazard 14 % (4 of 29 years ended with death or resignation: Lenin 24, Stalin 53, Khrushchev 64, Yeltsin 99).  
   – Suitability: small N, regime forms differ; still culturally proximate.  

Class 2 best balances sample size and situation similarity: autocrat, long tenure, engaged in major war.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

• Time remaining to 1 May 2026: 94 days (≈0.26 years).  
• If annual hazard in reference class = 10 %, naïve base rate for 0.26 y ≈ 1 – (1 – 0.10)^0.26 ≈ 2.6 %.  
• History of unexpected Russian leadership exits within a three-month window: once in 29 observed years (Yeltsin 1999) ⇒ 3.4 %. Both figures provide a comparable 2-4 % baseline.

(d) Justification / outside-view adjustments  

Up-risk factors relative to baseline  
1. Age & health: Putin is 73; actuarial one-year mortality for Russian males age 73 ≈ 3.5 %, with most risk compressed into cardiovascular events that could strike suddenly.  
2. Ongoing war and sanctions raise elite and economic stress; Archigos data show coups more likely in wartime failures.  
3. Heightened rumour-mongering and some elite churn (Shoigu moved 2024, Kozak exited 2025) show mild cracks.  

Down-risk / stabilising factors  
1. Constitutional reset, near-total parliamentary control, loyal security organs; impeachment route practically closed.  
2. Levada December 2025 approval 85 %—low protest potential in 90-day horizon.  
3. No verified medical episodes, public schedule remains active; absence of succession “training” signals no planned resignation.  
4. Key anniversaries/public events before May 1 (e.g., Victory Day prep) incentivise continuity.

Net adjustment  
Start with 2.6 % baseline.  
+1 % for actuarial health risk above average autocrat age.  
+1 % for elevated wartime coup hazard (though no current plot evidence).  
–0.5 % for strong institutional & security grip.  
Rounded result: 4 % chance that Putin will cease to be president before 1 May 2026.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: Reference-class actuarial/coup data ≈ 2-4 % for a quarter-year horizon.  
• No market-based prediction prices to tether (PredictIt & Polymarket delisted Russia risk).  
• Expert commentary (e.g., CIA’s Burns, MI6’s Moore, multiple think-tank notes) repeatedly stress “very low but non-zero” probability of sudden exit within a year—consistent with 5-10 % annually, i.e., 1-3 % per quarter.  
• My 4 % sits slightly above pure statistical base, reflecting extra wartime stress yet guarding against over-weighting unverified rumours.  
• 4 % corresponds to odds of 24:1—emphasises that departure is possible but unlikely.

Outside View Prediction:
4 % probability that Vladimir Putin will cease to be President of the Russian Federation before 1 May 2026.
