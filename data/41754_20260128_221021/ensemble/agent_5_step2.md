Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, Jan–Sept 2025 → 28 Jan 2026)

1. Pastukhov & Petrov (NES-Centre, 16 Sep 2025) – think-tank report, factual personnel moves + opinion that Putin intends to stay until 2030.  Good quality, identifiable authors.  Mostly analysis, few verifiable facts.
2. Aftonbladet (18 Sep 2025) – Swedish tabloid quoting Tass/Putin speech about “future cadres”.  Low-moderate reliability; facts (speech & 2020 amendment) check out, health/speculation is opinion.
3. ISW daily campaign assessment (24 Jan 2026) – reputable US think-tank, well-sourced military/diplomatic facts, minimal speculation.  Confirms Putin still performing head-of-state tasks.
4. Al-Jazeera (25 Jan 2026) – mainstream outlet; reports Abu Dhabi talks + Ukrainian expert scepticism.  Factual meeting dates; opinions clearly attributed.
5. BBC (15 Jan 2026) – mainstream outlet; quotes Zelensky, Trump, Peskov.  Confirms Putin still recognised president; contains attributed opinions.
6. AskNews bundle (27-28 Jan 2026) – mostly Russian state outlets (TASS, RIA, RBC) plus Focus (Germany) and Anadolu.  Facts: Kremlin diary shows Putin holding meetings 27-28 Jan.  Glukhovsky interview is identifiable opinion that Putin avoids naming successor.
7. Small Wars Journal (1 Jan 2026) – academic journal; Russia in Africa, tangential to leadership issue.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “Putin leaves office by 1 May 2026”)

Strong evidence – weighs against exit
• Structural dominance: 2020 constitution reset; United Russia/Duma, siloviki loyalty (multiple sources) – hard to change quickly.

Moderate evidence – slight upward pressure
• Wartime stress & sanctions (ISW, BBC, Al-Jazeera) raise historical coup/death hazard for entrenched autocrats.
• Age/health actuarial risk (73-year-old Russian male ≈ 3½ % annual natural-death risk).

Weak evidence – minimal impact
• Succession speculation (Focus/Glukhovsky, Aftonbladet) with no concrete medical data.
• Rumour mill over Kadyrov illustrates regional instability, not federal succession.

Net: strong stabilising factors dominate.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window remaining: 94 days (~0.26 yr).
If window were halved to 47 days, probability would fall roughly by half (risk proportional to time) → ~1½ %.
If doubled to 188 days (to Aug 2026), probability would roughly double to ~6 %, assuming no new shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (long-tenure wartime autocrats) for a quarter-year: 2.6 %.
Add +0.8 % for actuarial death risk above generic autocrat average (older than mean).
Add +0.4 % for elevated coup hazard in an inconclusive four-year war.
Subtract –0.5 % for exceptional institutional control (constitution reset, security organs, elite fragmentation low, public schedule dense).
Rounded final: 3 %.

Even modest shifts (±1 percentage-point) materially alter odds (from 33 : 1 to 24 : 1), so I keep estimate tight.

Probability calibration
I would expect that in 3 of 100 parallel worlds Vladimir Putin is no longer President of Russia by 1 May 2026, and in 97 of 100 he still is.

Checklist:
1. Question restated: “Will Putin stop being Russian President before 1 May 2026 (94 days left)?”
2. Base rate used: 2.6 % quarterly exit for long-tenure wartime autocrats.
3. Consistency: “3 out of 100 times, Putin exits within next 94 days.” Sounds plausible.
4. Key evidence:
   • 2020 amendment lets Putin rule to 2036 (strong, status-quo).
   • Active public schedule 27-28 Jan 2026 (strong, contradicts health rumours).
   • Age 73 actuarial death risk (moderate, increases hazard).
   • Ongoing costly war historically raises coup risk (moderate).
5. Blind-spot: Sudden medical event (stroke/assassination) triggering transfer of power before May would up-end forecast.
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; given short timeframe, inertia is powerful.

Probability: 3%
