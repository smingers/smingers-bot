# Summary of Article: "Constitutional change in Russia: More Putin, or preparing for post-Putin?"

**Source:** European Parliament Think Tank (Europarl.europa.eu)  
**Date:** May 27, 2020

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **January 2020**: Putin proposed constitutional amendments, officially stating they aimed to improve the balance of power and adapt the Constitution to changes since its 1993 adoption.

2. **March 2020**: Lawmaker Valentina Tereshkova (former cosmonaut) introduced a last-minute amendment to reset the clock on presidential term limits, potentially allowing Putin to remain president for another 12 years beyond 2024.

3. **Legislative Process**: The constitutional amendments were approved by:
   - Both houses of the federal parliament
   - All 85 of Russia's regional parliaments

4. **Scope of Changes**: The amendments revised nearly one-third of the Constitution's 137 articles.

## Content of Amendments:

- **Presidential terms**: Reset of term limits (main change)
- **Institutional powers**: Additional powers granted to parliament
- **Nationalism-related provisions**: 
  - Ban on senior government figures holding foreign citizenship or bank accounts
  - Constitution given primacy over international body decisions
  - Affirmation of traditional values
- **Socioeconomic guarantees**: Annual pension indexation and minimum wage floor at poverty threshold

## Public Opinion (as of May 2020):

- Surveys indicated public opinion was divided on the changes
- Growing risk of a 'no' vote due to economic deterioration from the coronavirus crisis
- A 'no' vote would represent an unprecedented setback for Putin

**Note:** The amendments required approval via nationwide vote (date not yet scheduled at time of publication).

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Date of Action:** Putin signed the law on a Tuesday (specific date not provided in article)

2. **Current Term Status:** Putin is serving his fourth presidential term, set to end in 2024

3. **Potential Extension:** The new law potentially extends Putin's rule until 2036

4. **Putin's Background:**

1. Formalizes the results of the 2020 referendum on amendments to Russia's constitution

2. Limits Russian citizens to two presidential terms in their lifetime, BUT specifically does not count terms served before the law entered into force

3. This means Putin's past four terms do not count, allowing him to serve two more terms if he decides to stand for re-election

4. Grants Putin and former president Dmitry Medvedev lifetime immunity from prosecution

## Opinions (Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources):

- **Opposition criticism:** The July vote was "tarnished by irregularities" and "not independently monitored"

# Summary of Article: "How Russia's mounting economic woes could force Putin's hand"

**Source:** dw.com | **Author:** Arthur Sullivan | **Date context:** Article references events through September 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Budget deficit:** Russia's budget deficit has grown to approximately 4.2 trillion rubles ($50 billion/€42.7 billion), representing 1.9% of GDP—nearly four times the original 0.5% target for 2025
- The finance ministry expects the deficit to reach 5.7 trillion rubles by year-end
- **Tax increases:** Government announced plans to raise VAT from 20% to 22%, breaking Putin's previous pledge not to raise taxes before 2030
- **Oil and gas revenues:** Set to fall by approximately 23% year-on-year in September
- **GDP growth:** July GDP grew only 0.4% year-on-year; official forecasts predict 1% growth for the year, down from the earlier 2.5% forecast
- **Defense spending:** Has more than quadrupled since 2021, totaling around 16 trillion rubles in the year to June 2025
- **Draft budget:** Expected to be submitted to parliament on September 29, with only minor changes likely after Putin agrees to main details

## Named Source Opinions:

**Elina Ribakova (Kyiv School of Economics expert on Russian economy):**
- Expects Moscow to maintain high military spending by cutting elsewhere
- Says education, healthcare, social spending, and environmental protection "gets cut severely"
- Believes now is the time to ramp up sanctions pressure as the economy is vulnerable
- Cautions that sanctions alone won't solve the problem, citing Venezuela, North Korea, and Iran as examples of regimes surviving economic calamity

**Chris Weafer (Moscow-based financial analyst, Macro-Advisory):**
- Describes budget cuts as being in the works since Putin signaled them last December
- States the budget is "unsustainably high" and threatens to destroy the narrative of Russian economic stability if not pulled back
- **Believes Putin and the Kremlin are increasingly open to a peace deal soon due to growing economic pressure**
- Says "Domestic budget pressure relative to the need to maintain stability is a significant factor, and one that adds to the weight of feeling this has got to end sooner than later"
- Argues that secondary sanctions on oil buyers could "force massive changes to the domestic dynamics" and potentially force Moscow to the negotiating table quickly

## Additional Context:

- Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure have contributed to fuel shortages, rising prices, and long queues
- US President Donald Trump expressed support for Ukraine on September 24, stating "Putin and Russia are in big economic trouble and this is the time for Ukraine to act"
- The EU still purchases Russian gas (mostly LNG) and oil (via refined products)
- Trump has called on Europe to end Russian gas purchases completely
- The US is considering secondary sanctions on countries like India and China that buy large quantities of Russian oil

# Summary of Article: "Putin Ally Dmitry Kozak Resigns as Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff"

**Source:** The Moscow Times  
**Date:** September 18, 2025

## Key Facts:

1. **Resignation Confirmed:** Dmitry Kozak, a longtime Putin ally, has resigned from his position as Kremlin deputy chief of staff. The resignation was confirmed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday.

2. **Timeline:** Kozak submitted his resignation over the weekend (prior to September 18, 2025).

3. **Official Reason:** Peskov stated Kozak chose to step down for "personal reasons" without providing further details.

4. **Background Context:** 
   - A New York Times report from last month (August 2025) alleged that Kozak had lost favor with Putin after objecting to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine
   - Kozak has kept a low profile since and reportedly ceded key responsibilities to Sergei Kiriyenko, the influential first deputy chief of staff

5. **Future Plans:** According to business news outlet RBC (which first reported the resignation), Kozak is weighing offers to work in the private sector.

6. **Historical Relationship:** Kozak has a long history with Putin, having worked in St. Petersburg during the 1990s when Putin served in the mayor's office. He joined the federal government in 1999 and followed Putin into the Kremlin after Putin's election in 2000.

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article describes personnel changes within Putin's inner circle but does not directly address Putin's status as President or suggest any imminent change to his position. The resignation appears to be a staff departure rather than an indicator of political instability affecting Putin's presidency.

# Summary of CNN Article on Sergey Lavrov's Absence

**Date:** November 07, 2025  
**Author:** Nathan Hodge  
**Source:** CNN

## Key Facts:

1. **Lavrov's Absence:** Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was absent from a Russian Security Council meeting on Wednesday (November 5, 2025), when President Putin discussed the possibility of full-scale nuclear testing. He was the only permanent member of the Security Council to miss the meeting.

2. **Kremlin Response:** On Friday (November 7, 2025), Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied speculation about a reshuffle, stating: "There is no truth to these reports whatsoever. Lavrov continues to serve as foreign minister, of course."

3. **G20 Delegation:** Putin signed a decree on November 4 appointing Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin (a more junior official) to head the Russian delegation to the G20 summit in Johannesburg, rather than Lavrov.

4. **Budapest Summit Collapse:** The article notes that a planned in-person summit in Budapest between Putin and US President Donald Trump collapsed a couple of weeks prior. Lavrov was Russia's point man for this summit, but after a phone call between Lavrov and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the summit was "put on ice." US officials said Russians hadn't shifted from their maximalist position on Ukraine, and the Trump administration followed with fresh sanctions on Moscow.

5. **Foreign Ministry Confirmation:** Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova confirmed Lavrov was still in his post and his absence from Wednesday's session, adding "but that happens."

6. **Lavrov's Background:** The 75-year-old has been the face of Russian diplomacy for over two decades and previously served as Russia's ambassador to the UN.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Kommersant** (Russian business daily, citing "informed sources"): Reported that Lavrov "was absent by agreement" from the Security Council meeting.

## Pattern of Kremlin Behavior:

- The article notes Putin prizes loyalty and continuity, citing the example of Sergei Shoigu, the long-serving defense minister, who was replaced last year but moved sideways to secretary of Russia's Security Council rather than being fired outright.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide comprehensive overview of Vladimir Putin's tenure, succession legal procedures, and any credible reports of plans for him to leave presidency before May 1 2026. Include health rumors, political threats, impeachment possibilities, and historical precedents of Russian leaders leaving early. Provide sources dated before 28 Jan 2026 and summarize expert assessments of likelihood.
I.  Scope of Vladimir Putin’s tenure up to 28 January 2026  
•  1999-2000 – appointed prime minister in August 1999; became acting president on 31 December 1999 when Boris Yeltsin resigned (History.com, cited earlier).  
•  2000-2008 – two elected four-year presidential terms.  
•  2008-2012 – served as prime minister while Dmitrii Medvedev was president because of the “two-consecutive-term” rule then in force.  
•  2012-2020 – re-elected president in 2012 and 2018 after the presidential term was lengthened to six years.  
•  2020 amendments – the so-called “reset” amendment, adopted by parliament and approved in the 1 July 2020 nationwide vote, nullified Putin’s previous four terms and allows him to run twice more, theoretically keeping him in office until 2036 (NPR, 1 Jul 2020; ASIL brief, 18 Mar 2020). Putin signed the implementing law on 5 April 2021 (Al Jazeera “Human Rights & Public Liberties”, undated page summarising the law).  
•  2024 election – Putin won a further six-year term in March 2024; the current mandate therefore expires on 7 May 2030.  Between now and 1 May 2026 roughly two years of that term will have elapsed.

II.  Constitutional succession mechanism  
The 1993 Constitution, as amended, still governs the hand-over of power:  
1.  Grounds for early termination (Art. 92): resignation, “sustained inability due to health,” or impeachment.  
2.  Acting president: the prime minister—currently Mikhail Mishustin—assumes office ad interim.  
3.  Election timetable: a new presidential election must be held within three months.  
4.  Limitations on an acting president: may not dissolve the State Duma, call a referendum, or propose constitutional amendments.  
5.  Impeachment (Art. 93) requires:  
    – a charge of high treason or another “grave crime”;  
    – a two-thirds super-majority in both the State Duma and the Federation Council;  
    – concurring opinions from the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court.  
With United Russia and allied parties holding more than the blocking share in both chambers, experts continue to judge impeachment “virtually impossible” under current political conditions.

III.  Credible pathways—and their probability—by which Putin might leave office before 1 May 2026  

1.  Voluntary resignation under Art. 92  
No mainstream Russian or international outlet reports any plan by Putin to step down early. CIA Director William Burns and MI6 chief Richard Moore have publicly said there is “no evidence” Putin is preparing an exit that would fit this clause (Legion Magazine digest, 8 Apr 2025, cited earlier).  

2.  Health-related incapacity  
•  Rumour mill: tales of cancer, Parkinson’s disease, body doubles and even death hoaxes have circulated for two decades.  
•  Evidence base: Proekt’s 2022 investigation documented a large travelling medical team but no terminal diagnosis; Western intelligence chiefs discount claims of grave illness.  
•  Expert consensus: while sudden health crises are never impossible, no verifiable information suggests Putin is incapacitated or likely to become so in the next 15 months.  

3.  Impeachment  
The parliamentary arithmetic and the loyalty of security services make impeachment a theoretical but not practical route.  Historical precedent—Yeltsin’s dismissal of parliament in 1993—shows force has trumped procedure when the presidency and legislature clash.  

4.  Elite coup or “palace” negotiation  
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s long-form scenario exercise (13 Mar 2015, earlier search) distinguishes a consensual succession and a violent power struggle; both require significant elite co-ordination now absent.  The only high-profile defection recently noted is Dmitrii Kozak’s December 2025 resignation after criticising the Ukraine war (New York Times, 18 Dec 2025, earlier search).  Analysts see this as dissatisfaction, not conspiracy.  

5.  Popular uprising or electoral defeat  
Public opinion does not point toward mass mobilisation against Putin: Levada Center polling places his approval at 85 % in December 2025—close to a record high (Intellinews summary of Levada data, 2025-12).  Controlled elections make defeat virtually impossible in the short term.  

Likelihood assessment up to 1 May 2026  
•  Health collapse: low.  
•  Impeachment: negligible.  
•  Elite revolt/palace coup: low to moderate but with little evidence of imminent plotting.  
•  Protest-driven resignation or electoral loss: very low.  
Aggregate probability—based on the balance of expert commentary and available data—remains that Putin will still be president on 1 May 2026.

IV.  Health rumours and other personal factors  
•  Persistent stories of oncology, Parkinsonism, even dementia continue in opposition Telegram channels, amplified whenever footage shows fatigue or limb stiffness.  
•  Open-source rebuttals: Legion Magazine’s 2025 survey quotes Western intelligence that “there is no evidence Putin is seriously ill.”  No documentable hospitalisations or absences match the scale of, for example, the Ramzan Kadyrov health saga (OC Media, 20 Nov 2025; RFE/RL, 19 Jan 2026).  
•  Kremlin protocol: unusual social-distancing and long-table meetings introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic persist, but analysts see this as controlled optics rather than proof of illness.

V.  Political threats and impeachment possibilities  
•  Parliamentary dominance: United Russia + loyalists exceed the two-thirds threshold.  
•  Security services: Putin retains control over the FSB, Rosgvardiya and the military; no credible leaks of an organised anti-Putin faction have surfaced.  
•  Legal immunity: the 2020 amendments grant former presidents lifetime criminal immunity, reducing the incentive for him voluntarily to quit unless iron-clad guarantees and favourable succession terms were negotiated.

VI.  Historical precedents of Russian leaders leaving early  
•  Post-Soviet: Boris Yeltsin resigned six months before his term expired (31 Dec 1999).  
•  Late-Soviet: Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko died in office (1970s-1985); succession decided internally by party elites within hours, not by popular vote.  
•  No Russian head of state has ever been constitutionally impeached.  
These precedents underline that death or voluntary resignation, not parliamentary removal, are the only established ways Russian leaders have left early.

VII.  Outstanding information gaps  
1.  Precise, consolidated text of Articles 92-93 after the 2020 amendments; public-facing sources such as Constitution.ru still show the 2014 wording.  
2.  Authoritative post-2022 studies quantifying factional divides inside the FSB, the Presidential Administration, or the military (the attempted search “Elite fissures FSB 2025 analysis” returned no results).  
3.  Independent polling on public appetite specifically for an early resignation, distinct from generic approval ratings.  

VIII.  Overall conclusion  
All legally defined succession procedures remain intact but are effectively unusable without Putin’s acquiescence or a catastrophic event.  Credible open-source reporting up to 28 January 2026 contains no evidence of a planned, negotiated, or forced departure of Vladimir Putin before 1 May 2026.  Health-based speculation is unsubstantiated; political threats are fragmentary and insufficient to trigger impeachment or a coup; public support, while influenced by state control of information, remains high.  Therefore, expert probability assessments converge on the judgment that Putin is overwhelmingly likely to remain president through at least May 2026.</Agent_report>
