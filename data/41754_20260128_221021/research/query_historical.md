Analysis:
The forecast hinges on whether Vladimir Putin will leave the presidency (by resignation, dismissal, death, incapacity, coup, etc.) before 1 May 2026.  To build an outside-view baseline we need:  
1. Legal/constitutional facts governing his current term length and pathways for early removal (2020 constitutional “zeroing” amendment, impeachment rules, succession order).  
2. Empirical precedents—how past Russian/Soviet leaders have exited power and under what conditions.  
3. Recent, well-sourced reporting (2023-Jan 2026) on health, political stability, elite unrest, war outcomes, election irregularities, or rumors of resignation/coup that might increase exit probability.  
4. Expert analyses or probability assessments made prior to today.  
These strands will let us compare historical frequencies and present-day pressures to judge the chance of Putin ceasing to be president before the deadline.
