Anton Vaino - Presidential administration leader\n2. Sergei Kiriyenko - First deputy of presidential administration\n3. Dmitry Mironov - Chief personnel officer for law enforcement\n4. Alexei Dyumin - Described as \"key figure\" in transition scenario\n5. Dmitry Patrushev - Deputy Prime Minister (son of Nikolai Patrushev)\n6. Denis Manturov - Government member\n7. Andrei Belousov - Minister of Defence\n8. Vladimir Yakushev - Secretary of United Russia Party's General Council\n9. Mikhail Kuznetsov - Head of Executive Committee of All-Russia People's Front\n10. Sergei Sobyanin - Mayor of Moscow, senior leader of State Council\n11. Igor Krasnov - Prosecutor General\n\n**Timeline and Milestones:**\n- 2026 State Duma elections identified as \"important stage in the transition process\"\n- Elections will include veterans of the war with Ukraine\n- Overall transition intended to complete by 2030 presidential election\n\n**Institutional Changes:**\n- April 2023: Putin created state fund \"Defenders of the Fatherland\" (headed by his niece Anna Tsivileva)\n- March 2025: Established Commission on Veterans of Combat Operations within State Council (chaired by Astrakhan governor Igor Babushkin)\n- These steps described as \"beginning of the recruitment of a new elite\"\n\n**Power Redistribution Details:**\n- Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin's position being weakened through promotion of Denis Manturov to First Deputy Prime Minister\n- Igor Shuvalov appointed to chair working group coordinating development institutions\n- Shuvalov's group controls spending up to 30 trillion roubles ($373.5 billion as of August 2025) - more than half of all national project funds and roughly three-quarters of all state expenditure\n- This creates overlap and dilutes Mishustin's authority\n\n**Characterization of System:**\nThe report describes the transition as switching the system to \"autopilot mode\"\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThe article explicitly states the transition process is designed to be completed by 2030, with Putin retaining \"full control\" while altering the system configuration rather than handing over power. The analysis emphasizes there is **no genuine successor** being prepared, which suggests Putin intends to remain as President through the timeframe in question (before May 1, 2026).\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be analytical/opinion piece from a think tank rather than breaking news, though it cites specific factual personnel changes and institutional developments from 2024-2025.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/25/not-optimistic-in-ukraine-scepticism-surrounds-russia-war-peace-talks\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Not optimistic: In Ukraine, scepticism surrounds peace talks\"\n\n**Source:** Al Jazeera  \n**Author:** Nils Adler\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi (Friday-Saturday):** Ukrainian, Russian, United States, and Emirati officials held US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with newly appointed Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Moscow. The meeting will focus on bilateral economic ties and the situation in the Middle East, including the fate of Russian military bases in Syria. Peskov emphasized that 'bilateral relations are experiencing noticeable progress following the change in leadership in Syria.' When asked about the fate of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Peskov stated, 'No comment on this matter.' The visit marks Sharaa's second trip to Russia since assuming power in late January 2025, following the overthrow of Assad's regime on December 8, 2024, after rebels seized control of Damascus. The announcement of Sharaa\u2019s presidency was made on January 29, 2025, by the Syrian Operations Directorate, according to SANA news agency.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:24 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85/3813179)\n\n**Putin to Receive Report from Sirius Head Elena Shmel\u00ebva on Wednesday**\nOn Wednesday, January 28, 2026, Russian President Vladimir Putin will receive a report from Elena Shmel\u00ebva, the head of the 'Sirius' educational center, according to Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov.

The two leaders are expected to discuss the state and prospects of bilateral relations across political, economic, and humanitarian fields, as well as the current situation in the Middle East. This meeting follows a previous high-level encounter on October 15, 2025, in the Kremlin, marking al-Sharaa\u2019s first in-person meeting with Putin after the change of power in Syria. During that meeting, both leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, including Russian military bases in Syria, energy and transport projects, tourism, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, with Damascus expressing interest in wheat, food, and medical supplies. Putin emphasized the long-standing, friendly, and non-political nature of Russian-Syrian relations, praising the October parliamentary elections in Syria as a success promoting national unity. Al-Sharaa affirmed the deep historical ties between the two nations and expressed intent to restart comprehensive bilateral relations, introducing Russia to the 'new Syria.' The transition followed the December 8, 2024, capture of Damascus by opposition forces, leading to the resignation of Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa was declared transitional president on January 29, 2025, with presidential elections scheduled for four years later. A constructive phone call between Putin and al-Sharaa occurred in mid-February 2025, confirming continued engagement on practical cooperation.

Reiterovich dismissed the idea as 'somewhat fantastical,' noting the implausibility of Putin traveling to Kyiv or Zelenskyy to Moscow, and stated that 'Americans are presenting desired outcomes as reality.' The reports stemmed from talks held in Abu Dhabi (UAE) on January 23\u201324, 2026, involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, which Zelenskyy described as constructive, focusing on potential war-ending parameters.

The successor must keep Chechnya under the control of the Kremlin. - News.yam.md**\nDiscussions about the future leadership of Chechnya have intensified amid growing reports of declining health of Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic. According to sources close to the Kremlin and the United Russia party, as reported by the investigative publication IStories, Moscow is treating the situation with the utmost seriousness. The primary concern is ensuring that Kadyrov\u2019s successor maintains Chechnya\u2019s control under the Kremlin. The article, published by YamNews on January 27, 2026, highlights that the transition planning is underway to preserve political stability and loyalty within the region.

Rumors spread in late December 2025 that Kadyrov's health had rapidly deteriorated, with reports of kidney failure, leading to treatment in Moscow and later in Grosny at the family-owned hospital. Multiple family members and doctors were said to have gathered at his bedside, signaling severe concern. Shortly after Kadyrov posted a video to dispel rumors of his imminent death, a serious traffic accident occurred involving his 18-year-old son, Adam Kadyrow. Adam was in the first vehicle of a convoy that crashed into another car and a barrier after running a red light in Grosny's Putin district; all three occupants were injured, and at least one person died. A 'flying ambulance' from Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations was dispatched to Moscow the same evening, raising speculation about the severity of Adam's injuries or the need for precaution. The lack of an official accident report, heightened security at the hospital, and overall urgency suggest deep anxiety within Chechen leadership. Adam, seen as a potential successor to his father, is only 18 and lacks the experience to assume power. Kadyrov\u2019s other sons, Achmat and Selimchan, are considered either too soft or too brutal, while his daughters manage the family\u2019s economic empire. Despite President Putin\u2019s long-standing support for Kadyrov\u2019s regime, Moscow appears hesitant to guarantee the family\u2019s dynastic succession. Factions within Russian security structures are pushing for a non-family successor. The accident and Kadyrov\u2019s uncertain health have triggered instability, with various figures seeking to exploit the power vacuum. Although Kadyrov remains in control, the incident reveals the fragility of both his personal authority and Chechnya\u2019s precarious stability.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 10:45 AM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/international/tschetschenien-ungwissheit-nach-autounfall-von-ramsan-kadyrows-kronprinz-ld.1920825)\n\n**Coup d'\u00c9tat for Putin: His Heir Apparent on the Brink of Death**\nRamzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of the Chechen Republic and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reportedly hospitalized in Grozny with a severe health condition, including renal failure, according to unconfirmed intelligence sources from Ukraine. The Russian government has not officially confirmed the reports. Despite posting recent videos on social media showing him engaged in daily activities, observers note a significant change in his appearance and a noticeable weight loss over recent months. In December 2025, Kadyrov admitted to suffering from 'nervous depression,' attributing it to the stress of Chechen forces' involvement in the war in Ukraine. He also stated his intention to run for re-election in 2026, but only if the Kremlin explicitly supports his continuation in office. His health crisis has intensified speculation about the future of governance in Chechnya, where his rule has long rested on a tacit agreement with Moscow following the assassination of his father, Akhmat Kadyrov, after the Chechen wars. His regime is marked by violent repression of dissent, unwavering loyalty to the Kremlin, and a public image of strength. Preparations for a post-Kadyrov era appear underway: in early 2026, he appointed his 20-year-old son Akhmet as interim Deputy Prime Minister, a move seen as an effort to establish a family succession, despite Russian law barring him from holding the top post. Compounding the instability, Kadyrov\u2019s 18-year-old son Adam was critically injured in a car accident in Grozny, hospitalized unconscious and transferred to intensive care before regaining consciousness. The circumstances remain unconfirmed, further deepening uncertainty around one of Russia\u2019s most powerful and controversial families.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 08:31 AM\nSource:[jforum.fr](https://www.jforum.fr/coup-dure-pour-poutine-son-dauphin-est-a-larticle-de-la-mort.html)\n\n**Kadyrov\u2019s Plane and MCHS Medical Jet Flew to Moscow After Son\u2019s High-Profile Accident**\nOn the evening of January 16, 2026, two aircraft departed from Grozny en route to Moscow following a high-profile traffic accident involving Adam Kadyrov, the son of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. One was Kadyrov\u2019s personal Airbus ACJ319 (RA-73417), which had arrived from Dubai and was traveling toward the Caspian Sea before heading to Moscow, according to Flightradar24. The other was an AN-148 medical aircraft (RA-61717) operated by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Situations (MCHS), equipped with six medical evacuation modules\u2014classified as a 'flying hospital' by RussianPlanes. The accident, reported by the NIYSO movement, occurred when Adam Kadyrov\u2019s convoy was traveling at high speed and collided with an obstacle, resulting in multiple injuries. While the exact condition of Adam Kadyrov remains unconfirmed, the incident caused significant public concern. This event coincides with ongoing speculation about Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s deteriorating health: on January 11, 2026, the General Staff of the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Kadyrov had experienced kidney failure. He had been hospitalized in his private clinic in Chechnya, where members of his extended family (teyp) gathered from abroad, according to intelligence sources. A succession process has intensified, with potential successors including Prime Minister Magomed Daudov, commander of the Akhmat unit Ap\u0442\u0438 Alaudinov, and Kadyrov\u2019s eldest son, Ahmat. Kadyrov\u2019s health had previously worsened on December 5, 2025, leading to the cancellation of his annual direct line with Chechen residents. In 2024, Novaya Gazeta reported that Kadyrov had suffered from pancreatic necrosis\u2014a condition with an 80% mortality rate\u2014for over five years. Despite this, his condition stabilized in 2024. On May 6, 2025, Kadyrov announced he had requested Russian President Vladimir Putin to remove him from office\u2014his fourth such request since 2016, all previously rejected.

Multiple sources, including the NIYSO movement, confirm the incident involved a high-speed convoy that collided after encountering an obstacle, resulting in several injuries, though Adam\u2019s condition has drawn the most attention. No reliable information about his current health status is available.

The 49-year-old Kadyrov is reportedly receiving dialysis treatment at a private clinic in Chechnya due to kidney failure, though doctors have stated they cannot make any definitive predictions about his condition. His wife and all 12 children are currently gathered around him, with additional family members abroad attempting to return. His declining health, which has been a subject of speculation since two years prior, has intensified due to his rare public appearances\u2014his most recent one, over a week prior, showed him using a cane and appearing weak. This health crisis has triggered early speculation about succession. Three main factions are emerging: Apti Alaudinov, the 'favorite of the Kremlin' and commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces, who is seen as a bridge between regional elites and the Russian Defense Ministry and has been featured frequently on federal television; Kadyrov's two eldest sons, Akhmat Kadyrov (20) and Adam Kadyrov (18), both appointed to multiple ministerial roles and having met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though their youth raises questions about their ability to command public reverence like their father; and Magomed Daudov, the Chairman of the Chechen Parliament, known as 'the Elder,' who controls internal security and represents institutional continuity but lacks the military charisma of Alaudinov. Kadyrov\u2019s 12 children are all from his legal wife, Medni Kadyrova, despite rumors of multiple wives or mistresses, which remain unconfirmed in public records.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 02:03 AM\nSource:[app.myzaker.com](http://app.myzaker.com/news/article.php?pk=696454428e9f0973cb0f504c)\n\n**Kadyrov's Health Deteriorates Significantly: Succession Process Intensifies**\nRamzan Kadyrov's health has significantly deteriorated, according to sources cited by Interfax, which reported that he is suffering from kidney failure and undergoing dialysis.

The process of selecting a successor for the Chechen leader has intensified due to his critical condition. The Kremlin is reportedly considering three candidates: Chechen Prime Minister Magomed Daudov, commander of the special forces unit 'Akhmat' Apti Alaudinov, and Akhmat Kadyrov, the eldest son of Ramzan Kadyrov. This is not the first time Kadyrov has faced serious health issues; in December 2025, he was hospitalized in Moscow and reportedly underwent emergency resuscitation before a meeting with Vladimir Putin. Earlier, in 2024, 'Novaya Gazeta' reported that Kadyrov suffered from necrotizing pancreatitis, and since 2019, he has undergone regular medical procedures, including surgeries. In February 2026, he temporarily transferred power to the prime minister, citing illness and receiving intravenous drips for two days. In January 2020, he also temporarily stepped down due to 'temporary inability to work.'

In a speech to parliament cited by Newsweek and the state\u2011controlled agency Tass, Putin said, 'Vi m\u00e5ste leta efter, hitta och lyfta fram folk som of\u00f6rskr\u00e4ckt tj\u00e4nar moderlandet och som varit villiga att riskera sin h\u00e4lsa och till och med sina liv' and added, 'S\u00e5dana m\u00e4nniskor ska befordras till ledarskapspositioner. De kommer bli v\u00e5ra eftertr\u00e4dare.' The piece notes that since the war began in February\u202f2022, more than 1.5\u202fmillion Russians have in some way taken part in the conflict, and that the war has continued for an additional nine months. It speculates on Putin\u2019s health, citing a video in which he said, 'm\u00e4nskliga organ kan st\u00e4ndigt transplanteras s\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor kan bli yngre, kanske till och med od\u00f6dliga', and a reply from Xi Jinping that 'folk i slutet av \u00e5rhundradet kan bli 150 \u00e5r'.
