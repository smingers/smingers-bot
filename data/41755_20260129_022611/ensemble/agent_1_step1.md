## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **BOJ rate-hike cycles (historical)**: Limited applicability - BOJ has rarely hiked rates in modern era; previous normalization attempts (2000, 2006-2007) were aborted quickly

2. **Current BOJ normalization cycle (Mar 2024-present)**: Most relevant
   - 4 hikes in 22 months (Mar 2024, Jul 2024, Jan 2025, Dec 2025)
   - Average interval: ~5.5 months between hikes
   - Pattern shows gradual, data-dependent approach
   - One pause (Jan 2026) after December hike

3. **Major central bank normalization cycles**: Moderately relevant
   - BOJ explicitly more gradual than Fed/ECB
   - Policy divergence is key feature
   - Limited comparability due to Japan's unique deflation history

**Selected Reference Class**: Current BOJ normalization cycle (Mar 2024-present) is most suitable because:
- Most recent and relevant behavioral data
- Captures BOJ's stated "gradual" approach
- Reflects current economic conditions and constraints

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: Jan 29, 2026 to Apr 30, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**BOJ Meeting Schedule in Timeframe**:
Based on typical BOJ schedule (8 meetings/year, roughly every 6-7 weeks):
- Jan 22-23, 2026: COMPLETED (held at 0.75%)
- Next likely meetings: Mid-March 2026, Late April/Early May 2026

**Historical Pattern Analysis**:
- Mar 2024 → Jul 2024: 4.5 months
- Jul 2024 → Jan 2025: 6 months  
- Jan 2025 → Dec 2025: 11 months
- Dec 2025 → Jan 2026: 1 month (HOLD)

**Pattern**: Intervals are lengthening, suggesting BOJ is slowing pace. The January 2026 hold after December 2025 hike indicates desire to assess impact.

**3-Month Forward Historical Precedent**:
- After Jan 2025 hike: No hike for 11 months
- After Jul 2024 hike: No hike for 6 months
- After Mar 2024 move: Hike in 4.5 months

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Low Probability**:

1. **Recent Hold Signal**: Jan 2026 meeting held rates despite one dissenter wanting hike, indicating majority wants to pause

2. **BOJ's Stated Approach**: Governor Ueda consistently emphasizes "gradual" normalization and "meeting by meeting" decisions; forward guidance says "could rise further" (conditional, not committal)

3. **Economic Headwinds**: 
   - Inflation moderating (Tokyo headline fell to 2.0% in Dec)
   - Industrial production declining
   - Q3 GDP contracted 2.3%
   - Political uncertainty (February 2026 snap election)

4. **Expert Consensus Timing**: 
   - Bloomberg survey: 48% expect July, only 17% expect April
   - ING: October 2026 base case
   - Most forecasters cluster around mid-2026 or later

5. **Historical Spacing**: After December 2025 hike, only 1 month passed before January hold. Typical spacing is 4-11 months.

**Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability**:

1. **Yen Weakness**: USD/JPY around 154-157; if breaches 160, could force action (State Street scenario)

2. **Persistent Inflation**: Above 2% target for 44 months; core at 2.6%

3. **Wage Growth**: Labor unions planning 5%+ wage growth

4. **Dissenting Vote**: January meeting had one member (Takata) wanting immediate hike

5. **Fiscal Stimulus**: Large stimulus package could fuel inflation

6. **BOJ Optionality**: Two potential meetings in timeframe (March, possibly late April)

**Probability Calibration Factors**:

- **Base rate from spacing**: If we assume 5-6 month average interval, probability of hike within 3 months ≈ 50% of that interval = ~25-30%
- **Expert survey anchor**: Only 17% of Bloomberg respondents expect April (the only month fully within timeframe)
- **Conditional scenarios**: Higher probability (30-40%) if yen weakens sharply; lower (5-10%) if economic data deteriorates
- **Recent behavior**: January hold after December hike suggests BOJ wants 2-3+ months minimum to assess

**Integration**: The most reliable anchor is the Bloomberg survey showing only 17% expect April. However, this doesn't account for a possible March meeting. Adding March possibility and considering yen-weakness scenarios, but weighted heavily by the January hold signal and BOJ's explicit gradualism, suggests probability in the 20-30% range.

Outside view calibration:

The strongest quantitative anchor is the Bloomberg survey of 52 economists (Jan 16, 2026):
- 17% expect April hike
- 17% expect June hike  
- 48% expect July hike

Since the question asks about "before May 1, 2026," this would capture April hikes but not late-April/early-May meetings that conclude after May 1.

However, I must adjust this baseline because:

**Upward adjustments**:
1. Survey was conducted before Jan 22-23 meeting; the 8-1 vote with one dissenter wanting immediate hike suggests some hawkish pressure
2. There's likely a March meeting not fully priced into "April" responses
3. Yen weakness scenario (currently 154-157, risk of breaching 160) could accelerate timeline
4. Survey may underweight tail risks

**Downward adjustments**:
1. January hold after December hike is strong signal of pause
2. BOJ's explicit "gradual" guidance and Ueda's "meeting by meeting" language suggests reactive, not proactive policy
3. Economic data moderating (inflation cooling, production declining)
4. Political calendar (February election) creates caution
5. Historical pattern shows lengthening intervals between hikes

**Probability reasoning**:
- If we take 17% (April survey result) as baseline
- Add ~8-10% for March meeting possibility  
- Add ~3-5% for yen-crisis scenario forcing early action
- Subtract ~5-7% for January hold signal and economic moderation
- Net adjustment: 17% + 8% + 4% - 6% = 23%

**Cross-check with base rates**:
- In 22 months (Mar 2024-Jan 2026), BOJ hiked 4 times = 18% monthly probability
- Over 3 months: 1 - (0.82)^3 = 47%
- But this assumes independence; recent hold suggests lower conditional probability
- Adjusted for recent hold and gradualism: ~25-30%

The convergence around 23-28% from multiple approaches suggests this range is reasonable.

Outside View Prediction:
26%
