## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **BOJ Minutes (Jan 28)**: All members agreed further hikes appropriate; real rates "significantly negative" - Direct from official source, clear policy direction
2. **Market Pricing**: 80% probability for April hike per swap market - Identifiable, actionable market signal with real money backing
3. **Dissenting Vote**: Takata wanted immediate hike in January - Official voting record shows hawkish pressure within board
4. **Yen Weakness Pattern**: Approached 160, now 153-154; BOJ explicitly concerned about inflation impact - Clear causal mechanism linking FX to policy

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **OCBC Forecast**: March hike possible due to 5%+ wage demands - Single credible institutional source with logical reasoning
2. **Oxford Economics**: Adding 1-2 hikes, could move earlier - Institutional forecast with conditional logic
3. **December Minutes Language**: One member advocated hikes "every few months" - Shows internal debate but not consensus
4. **Inflation Persistence**: 2.1% core, 4 years above target - Established trend but moderating

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Diamond Online Opinion**: "April probability significantly increased" - Analysis without specific data backing
2. **Market Speculation**: Various sources citing "positioning for March/April" - Anecdotal interpretation of BOJ signals
3. **Reuters Strategic Interpretation**: BOJ "strategically presented data" - Speculative reading of intentions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Jan 29, 2026 to Apr 30, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**BOJ Meeting Schedule**:
- Jan 22-23: COMPLETED (held)
- Likely March meeting: ~Mid-March (45 days from now)
- Possible late April meeting: Could conclude before or after May 1

**If Timeframe Halved (1.5 months to ~Mar 15)**:
- Only captures potential March meeting
- Probability would drop to ~15-20% (single meeting opportunity, less time for yen crisis)

**If Timeframe Doubled (6 months to ~Jul 31)**:
- Captures March, April, June, July meetings
- Bloomberg survey shows 48% expect July
- Probability would rise to ~65-75% (aligns with majority expert consensus)

## (d) Justification

**Critical Shift from Outside View (26%)**:

The January 28, 2026 release of December meeting minutes represents **new, material information** not available when outside view was established:

**Major Upward Factors:**

1. **Unanimous Agreement on Further Hikes**: All 9 board members agreed rates should rise if conditions met - this is stronger consensus than previously known. The question is timing, not direction.

2. **Market Pricing Spike**: 80% probability for April (before May 1) per swap market is **dramatically higher** than the 17% from Bloomberg survey. This represents:
   - Real money positioning
   - Post-minutes reaction
   - More recent information incorporation

3. **"Every Few Months" Guidance**: One member explicitly advocated this pace. Given December hike, "every few months" points to March/April timeframe.

4. **Yen Crisis Risk Elevated**: At 153-154, closer to intervention threshold (160). Finance Minister signaled coordination with US. If breaches 160, emergency hike becomes likely.

5. **Takata's Dissent**: Wanting immediate hike in January shows at least 1/9 of board believes conditions already met. As data evolves, others may join.

**Moderate Downward Factors:**

1. **January Hold Signal**: 8-1 vote to hold shows majority wants pause, but this was only 1 month after December hike
2. **Political Timing**: February election creates near-term caution
3. **Inflation Moderating**: Tokyo headline at 2.0%, though core remains 2.6%

**Probability Shift Justification:**

The 80% swap market probability is the most actionable signal, but must be tempered because:
- Markets can be wrong
- Reflects April specifically, not March
- Could include some late-April meetings that conclude after May 1

However, the combination of:
- Unanimous board agreement on direction
- "Every few months" suggested pace (3 months from Dec = March)
- Strong market conviction
- Elevated yen risk
- OCBC economist explicitly forecasting March

...suggests the outside view 26% is too conservative given **new information**.

Reasonable adjustment: 26% → 45-50%

The swap market's 80% seems too high (likely includes some May meetings, possible overreaction), but the Bloomberg survey's 17% for April is now stale (pre-minutes).

## Probability Calibration

**Starting Point**: Outside view 26%

**Adjustment Logic**:
1. Swap market 80% probability is strongest single signal (+25%)
2. Unanimous board agreement on further hikes (+8%)
3. "Every few months" guidance from December points to March (+7%)
4. OCBC economist explicitly forecasting March (+5%)
5. January hold was only 1 month after December, not indicative of long pause (-3%)
6. Political caution from February election (-2%)
7. Uncertainty about exact meeting dates near May 1 deadline (-5%)

**Net Adjustment**: +35 percentage points

However, this seems too mechanical. Better approach:

**Calibrated Estimate**:
- Swap market at 80% for "before April" is likely inflated but directionally correct
- Bloomberg 17% for April is outdated (pre-minutes)
- Truth likely between these: ~45-55% range
- Given uncertainty about:
  - Exact meeting schedule
  - Whether late-April meeting concludes before May 1
  - Yen trajectory
  - Political factors

**Final Calibration**: 48%

This reflects:
- Strong probability of March or April meeting with hike decision
- Meaningful risk that meeting occurs but concludes after May 1
- Balance between market conviction (80%) and survey skepticism (17%)
- Recognition that unanimous board support for "further hikes" is powerful signal

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will BOJ raise policy rate from current 0.75% before May 1, 2026? (91 days)

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view 26% based on Bloomberg survey (17% April) + historical spacing. Final 48% represents significant upward revision justified by Dec minutes release showing unanimous board support and 80% market pricing.

3. **Consistency**: "48 out of 100 times, BOJ raises rates before May 1, 2026" - This reflects roughly even odds with slight tilt toward hike, consistent with strong board consensus but uncertainty on exact timing/meeting schedule.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BOJ Dec minutes: All members support further hikes if conditions met (verified official source)
   - Swap market: 80% probability before April (verified market pricing)
   - Board member: Advocated "every few months" pace (verified from minutes)
   - OCBC economist: Explicitly forecasts March hike (verified institutional source)
   - Takata dissent: Wanted immediate January hike (verified voting record)

5. **Blind spot**: BOJ could prioritize political neutrality around February 8 election more than markets expect, delaying until after political clarity emerges. This would push timing to late April/May, potentially missing the May 1 deadline. Would shift probability down to 30-35%.

6. **Status quo**: Current rate is 0.75% (held in January). However, "status quo" for BOJ is gradual normalization cycle, not indefinite hold. The 3-month window captures 1-2 meetings in an active hiking cycle, so moderate volatility expected.

Probability: 48%
