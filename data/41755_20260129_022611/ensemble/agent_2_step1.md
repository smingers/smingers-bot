## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **BOJ rate hike cycles historically**: Limited applicability - Japan's unique deflationary history and 30-year period of near-zero/negative rates makes historical BOJ cycles poor comparators

2. **Current BOJ normalization cycle (2024-2026)**: Most relevant - we have 4 data points:
   - March 2024: First exit from negative rates
   - July 2024: Hike to 0.25% (4 months later)
   - January 2025: Hike to 0.50% (6 months later)
   - December 2025: Hike to 0.75% (11 months later)
   - January 2026: Hold at 0.75% (1 month later)
   
   Pattern shows increasing intervals between hikes (4→6→11 months)

3. **Central bank rate-hike cycles globally (2022-2024)**: Limited applicability - other central banks moved much faster; BOJ is unique in hiking while others pause/cut

4. **Expert forecast accuracy for BOJ**: The December 2025 hike had 86-94% probability assigned and occurred; January 2026 hold was unanimous expectation and occurred. Recent expert forecasts have been accurate.

**Selected reference class**: Current BOJ normalization cycle (2024-2026) combined with expert consensus forecasts, given their recent accuracy.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: Today is January 29, 2026. Question resolves May 1, 2026 = **92 days** or approximately **3 months**.

**Scheduled BOJ meetings before May 1, 2026:**
- March 18-19, 2026
- April (typically late April, e.g., April 24-25)

So there are **2 potential decision dates** within the timeframe.

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- Most recent decision (January 2026): Held after only 1 month from previous hike
- Pattern shows BOJ increasingly spacing out hikes: 4→6→11 months between actions
- BOJ has never hiked at consecutive meetings in this cycle
- Governor Ueda emphasized "meeting by meeting" approach and being "still a long way to the neutral rate"

**Expert consensus timing:**
- 48% expect July 2026 (outside timeframe)
- 17% expect April 2026 (within timeframe)
- 17% expect June 2026 (outside timeframe)
- Only 34% total expect action within or near the timeframe

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting a hike before May 1, 2026:**

1. **Inflation persistence**: 44 consecutive months above 2% target, core at 2.6%
2. **Real rates still very low**: BOJ and dissenting member Takata emphasize accommodation remains excessive
3. **Wage growth**: Major unions planning 5%+ wage increases
4. **Yen weakness**: USD/JPY around 154-157, potential intervention concerns if weakens further toward 160
5. **Forward guidance**: BOJ said rates "could rise further" if conditions evolve as projected
6. **Upgraded forecasts**: FY2026 GDP raised to 1.0%, core inflation to 1.9%
7. **April timing**: 17% of economists expect April hike

**Factors against a hike before May 1, 2026:**

1. **Just hiked in December**: Only 1 month ago, BOJ typically waits longer between moves
2. **Spacing pattern**: Intervals have been lengthening (4→6→11 months), suggesting next move is further out
3. **January hold**: BOJ explicitly chose to pause in January despite having option to hike
4. **Majority consensus**: 48% expect July, only 17% expect April - **66% expect no action before June**
5. **Near-term inflation decline**: ING expects headline below 2% soon due to energy subsidies and base effects
6. **Assessment period**: BOJ wants to evaluate impact of previous hikes before proceeding
7. **Political context**: February 2026 snap election may create caution
8. **Governor Ueda's language**: Emphasized "still a long way to neutral," suggesting gradualism
9. **Economic weakness**: Q3 GDP contracted 2.3%, industrial production down 2.6%
10. **Recent accuracy of consensus**: The 52-economist Bloomberg survey has been accurate; only 34% see action by June

**Integration:**

The BOJ has established a pattern of very gradual normalization with increasing intervals between hikes. Having just held in January 2026 after a December 2025 hike, the probability of action in the next 3 months is low. The institution has signaled it wants to assess the impact of its rapid-by-Japanese-standards tightening (85bp in 10 months). 

While yen weakness and persistent inflation create upside risk, the overwhelming expert consensus (66% expecting no action before June) and the BOJ's demonstrated patience argue against a hike before May 1. The April meeting represents the only realistic opportunity, but only 17% of experts expect it.

The 8-1 vote in January (with the dissent favoring a hike) shows the Board is not in urgent mode. If conditions deteriorate significantly (yen to 160+, inflation acceleration), April becomes more likely, but the base case remains a longer pause.

## Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to source data:**
- Bloomberg survey: 17% expect April (within timeframe), 48% July, 17% June
- Implied probability from survey: ~17-20% for action before May 1
- ING: "October most likely" (outside timeframe)
- State Street: "one hike in 2026" with base case not specifying timing before mid-year
- Trading Economics: Projects 0.75% through Q1 2026 (March 31), then 1.00% in 2027

**Calibration considerations:**
- Expert consensus has been accurate recently (December hike, January hold)
- Only 1 of 2 possible meetings (April) seems plausible; March too soon after January hold
- 17% is roughly 1-in-6 odds, which feels appropriate for a scenario requiring either:
  - Accelerated timeline due to yen crisis (possible but not base case)
  - BOJ surprising markets with April hike (low probability given pattern)

**Adjustment factors:**
- Upward: Yen weakness X-factor, persistent inflation, one dissenter already voting for hike
- Downward: Strong consensus against near-term action, lengthening intervals, just held in January, economic weakness

The 17% figure from the Bloomberg survey of 52 economists represents a reasonable anchor. Given the additional context of the January hold and the BOJ's demonstrated gradualism, a slight downward adjustment is warranted, but not dramatically so, as the yen risk remains real.

Outside View Prediction:
**14%**
