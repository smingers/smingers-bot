## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **December minutes unanimous on continued hikes**: Multiple independent sources confirm all board members agreed further hikes appropriate if conditions permit. This establishes institutional consensus. (Strong structural factor)
- **Real interest rates "significantly negative"**: Official BoJ assessment that current 0.75% remains far below neutral (1-2.5% range) and below inflation (2.1% core CPI Dec 2025). Clear causal mechanism for further tightening. (Strong structural)
- **Yen weakness concern**: Yen approached 160/USD in early Jan, raising import costs and inflation risks. Multiple board members cited this as requiring timely rate action. Historical precedent: BoJ often responds to yen crises. (Strong causal mechanism)
- **Spring wage negotiations**: Major unions demanding 5%+ wage increases in 2026 negotiations (results typically finalized by mid-March). This is a structural driver BoJ explicitly monitors. (Strong, with clear timing implications)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Swap market pricing 80% by April**: Reflects aggregated expectations but markets have been wrong before. Shows strong consensus shift toward earlier action. (Moderate—market-based)
- **Upgraded inflation forecasts**: BoJ raised FY2026 core CPI to 1.9% from 1.8%, suggesting growing confidence in sustained inflation. (Moderate—directional signal)
- **Takata dissent in January**: One board member already advocated immediate hike to 1.0%, showing hawkish minority exists. (Moderate—shows range of views)
- **Multiple analyst forecasts for March/April**: Citigroup, some Japanese sources cite March or April as likely. But these are opinions, not facts. (Moderate—expert opinion)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Election timing (8 Feb 2026)**: Snap election could delay action, but historically BoJ has hiked during political transitions when economic conditions warrant. (Weak—speculative political constraint)
- **Ueda's "mildly dovish" tone in January**: Interpreted as not accelerating timeline, but didn't rule out near-term action either. (Weak—ambiguous signal)

**Evidence Against Near-Term Hike:**
- **Historical pattern**: 0/4 previous hikes occurred within 3 months of prior move; median gap 6-7 months. (Strong historical pattern)
- **Bloomberg survey**: Only 17% of economists expect April, 48% July. Expert consensus leans later. (Moderate—but survey was mid-January, before minutes released)
- **Recent hike in December**: Just 6 weeks ago; BoJ typically waits to assess impact. (Moderate institutional pattern)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: Today (29 Jan 2026) to 1 May 2026 = **92 days (3.0 months)**

**BoJ meetings in window**: 
- March 2026 meeting (likely mid-March, ~45 days away)
- April 2026 meeting (likely late April, ~85 days away)

**If timeframe halved (to mid-March, ~45 days)**:
Probability would drop significantly to ~15-20%. Too soon after December hike, election just concluded, spring wage data incomplete. Historical precedent strongly against sub-2-month gaps.

**If timeframe doubled (to late July, ~6 months)**:
Probability would increase to ~65-75%. This aligns with historical 6-7 month median gap, Bloomberg survey plurality (48% expect July), and allows full assessment of spring wage outcomes and Q1 GDP data.

**Key timing factors**:
- Spring wage negotiation results finalized mid-March
- February election (8 Feb) creates ~2-week political buffer
- March meeting (~45 days) is earliest plausible, April meeting (~85 days) more likely
- BoJ historically cautious about rapid successive moves

## (d) Justification for Shifting Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 29%** (based on historical BoJ behavior and economist surveys)

**Factors supporting significant upward adjustment (+15-20 ppts):**

1. **Unprecedented yen crisis intensity**: The approach to 160/USD and subsequent intervention speculation represents a more acute currency crisis than previous hiking cycles. December minutes explicitly cite this as requiring "timely" action—language not seen in prior cycles. This makes current circumstances materially different from reference class.

2. **Unanimous board hawkishness**: Unlike previous cycles where dissent delayed action, December minutes show 100% agreement on need for continued hikes, with one member already advocating immediate action. This institutional consensus is stronger than historical norm.

3. **Structural inflation entrenchment**: Four consecutive years above 2% target, with BoJ explicitly stating underlying inflation is becoming embedded through wage-price spirals. This is the first genuine exit from deflation in 30 years—making historical reference class less analogous.

4. **Market pricing divergence from history**: 80% swap market probability for April represents strongest forward signal in modern BoJ history. While markets can be wrong, this level of conviction suggests information not captured in historical patterns.

5. **Real rate urgency**: At -1.35% real rate (0.75% policy vs 2.1% inflation), BoJ is further behind curve than at comparable points in 2006-07 cycle, creating stronger urgency.

**Factors supporting modest downward adjustment (-5-10 ppts):**

1. **Historical institutional inertia**: BoJ has never hiked within 3 months of previous move. Institutional culture favors gradualism. This is a strong structural constraint.

2. **Recent action**: December hike just 6 weeks ago; BoJ typically waits to assess lagged effects (6-12 months).

3. **Election timing**: While weak constraint, 8 Feb election creates political complexity for early-March action.

4. **Economist survey**: Only 34% expect hike before May in Bloomberg survey (though survey predates minutes release).

**Net adjustment**: +15-20 ppts (upward factors) -5-10 ppts (downward factors) = **+10 ppts net**

**Justification for magnitude**: Current circumstances differ materially from historical reference class in three key ways:
- Yen crisis is more acute (intervention-level weakness)
- Board consensus is stronger (unanimous, with hawkish dissent)
- Inflation entrenchment is unprecedented (genuine deflation exit vs. prior false starts)

However, institutional inertia remains powerful constraint. A +10 ppt adjustment (from 29% to 39%) reflects that while current factors make near-term action more likely than historical base rate suggests, the BoJ's deeply embedded gradualism prevents a larger shift.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate**: 29% (from outside view)
**Adjusted probability**: 29% + 10% = **39%**

**Calibration checks**:
- 39% implies roughly 2-in-5 chance—this feels appropriate given strong hawkish signals but powerful institutional constraints
- If I'm wrong, most likely because either: (a) BoJ waits for March wage data and acts in April meeting (just missing May 1 deadline), or (b) institutional gradualism proves even stronger than current signals suggest
- 39% vs 29%: The 10 ppt increase reflects that swap markets, December minutes, and yen crisis represent genuinely new information not fully captured in historical patterns, but I'm not willing to abandon institutional precedent entirely
- Compared to market pricing (80%), I'm significantly more conservative, reflecting skepticism that markets fully appreciate BoJ's historical gradualism

**Final calibration: 39%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will BoJ raise policy rate above current 0.75% before May 1, 2026 (92 days)? Two meetings possible: March and April.

2. **Base rate consistency**: Started at 29% from historical BoJ gaps and surveys. Final 39% represents modest upward shift based on current yen crisis, unanimous hawkish minutes, and market pricing, while respecting institutional gradualism.

3. **Consistency check**: "39 out of 100 times, BoJ raises rates in March or April 2026 meeting despite just hiking in December." This aligns with view that circumstances are unusually pressing but institutional inertia remains powerful.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - December minutes show unanimous support for continued hikes with real rates "significantly negative"
   - Swap markets price 80% probability of April hike, strongest forward signal in BoJ history
   - Yen approached 160/USD crisis level, with explicit BoJ concern about inflation passthrough
   - Spring wage negotiations demanding 5%+ increases, key BoJ trigger
   - Historical precedent: 0/4 prior hikes within 3 months, median 6-7 month gap

5. **Blind spot**: Most likely to be wrong if BoJ waits for complete March wage data and acts in late-April meeting that technically occurs before May 1 but just barely. Also could underestimate if yen resumes sharp decline toward 165, forcing emergency action.

6. **Status quo**: Status quo is "no hike"—BoJ just moved in December. World changes slowly; institutional momentum favors waiting. However, yen/inflation dynamics are unusually volatile, reducing status quo pull. Net: modest nudge toward status quo already incorporated in conservative 39% vs market's 80%.

Probability: 39%
