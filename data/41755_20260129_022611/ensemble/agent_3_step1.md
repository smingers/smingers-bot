Analysis:
• Source Analysis:
 – The CNBC article (Dec 18, 2025) explains that the BOJ raised rates in December 2025 to 0.75% amid high inflation and weakened economic growth. It cites data (e.g., 86.4% probability in LSEG data) and expert opinions (from Allianz Global Investors, BoJ governor comments) that provide concrete figures and market context. Its factual details about the December rate hike are reliable.
 – The Investing.com summary (Jan 23, 2026) provides a brief data table of recent BOJ decisions, confirming that on January 22, 2026, the BOJ kept rates at 0.75%. Although the format is fragmented, it remains a useful factual record.
 – The Trading Economics article reinforces the current rate level and provides historical patterns (record highs/record lows) and forward-looking statements from the BOJ (“could rise further”) that are fact‐based, while also incorporating consensus analyst views.
 – The ING THINK piece gives a clear picture of economic indicators (inflation, GDP forecasts, and wage growth expectations) and consolidates expert opinions on the likely timing of the next rate hike. It explicitly notes that the most likely timing for the next hike is in the second half of 2026, with only a subset of experts (about 17%) indicating an acceleration as early as April if adverse currency moves occur.
 – The Marketpulse article and The Japan Times piece provide additional context by reporting unanimous market expectations at recent meetings and polling a group of 52 economists—most expecting the next hike to occur in July 2026 (48% of economists) though some name April (17%) or June (17%) as possibilities. 
 – The Agent report offers a chronological record of rate adjustments since March 2024 and summarizes the current consensus on future hikes. Its detailed chronology provides a factual baseline for assessing whether another move might occur before May 2026.
In all cases, the core factual details (meeting dates, rate change amounts, vote tallies when available) are reliably reported; expert opinions on forward guidance are clearly identified and come from reputable economists and institutions.

• Reference Class Analysis:
 – One possible reference class is the earlier Japanese monetary policy normalization cycle (e.g., the transition from negative to positive rates) wherein rate hikes occurred intermittently over months.
 – Another is the consensus of recent surveys and market expectations, where multiple surveys (Japan Times, Bloomberg survey of 52 economists, ING Think opinions) indicate a base case where the next hike is likely later in the year—most frequently in July.
 – A third reference class would be the reactive events where external shocks (such as a rapid yen weakness) accelerated policy moves. This class is more conditional and less common.
Among these, the survey-based and historical cycle reference class (with most experts predicting a mid/late 2026 move) is most directly relevant to assessing whether a hike occurs before May 1, 2026.

• Timeframe Analysis:
 – Today is January 29, 2026, and the forecasting question asks about a rate hike “before May 1, 2026,” i.e. within roughly the next 3 months.
 – Historically, after the BOJ’s December 2025 move, the January 2026 meeting confirmed no change. In recent rate normalization cycles in Japan, the BOJ has typically taken several months between successive adjustments. 
 – Surveys cited in the sources indicate that while a small minority (about 17% of economists) expect an accelerated move (e.g., in April), the majority expect the next rate increase in July 2026.

• Justification:
 – Considering the historical context of measured pace following the December 2025 hike, the detailed record showing no change in January 2026, and the wide-ranging assessments with the consensus leaning towards a mid‑year (July 2026) move, the outlook for a rate hike before May 1, 2026 appears relatively low.
 – However, there is an upside risk: if the yen were to weaken sharply or wage pressures unexpectedly intensify, policy makers might feel compelled to move sooner—reflected in the minority opinions (≈17%).
 – All sources corroborate a base assumption that the normalization process is proceeding but at a “glacial pace” unless triggered by significant economic or currency shocks. Given that the prevailing conditions (moderate inflation and gradual policy tightening) do not strongly indicate an imminent acceleration, the historical and survey evidence supports a low probability of an early hike before May 1.

Outside view calibration:
 – Base-rate estimates from the consensus surveys point to a single forthcoming hike likely in mid‑2026 (approximately 48% chance for July, with only a 17% chance indicated for April, and 17% for June). 
 – Only the April timing would qualify as “before May 1,” so roughly 17% of experts see an early move, though additional cautious considerations (e.g., absence of an extreme catalyst) suggest even that minority might be overestimating.
 – Considering the overall historical pattern of measured policy normalization and the low probability of a strong triggering shock in the coming 3 months, calibrating the true probability should be modest. Even with a slight risk premium for adverse currency moves, the probability remains significantly lower than 50%.
 – Based on this synthesis, a calibrated outside view probability of roughly 17% (give or take a couple of percentage points) for a BOJ rate hike before May 1, 2026 seems appropriate in reflecting the consensus and historical precedent.

Outside View Prediction:
I assign a 17% probability (to within ±1%) that the Bank of Japan will raise its policy interest rate again before May 1, 2026.
