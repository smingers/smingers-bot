Analysis:
We are asked to forecast whether the BOJ will raise its policy rate again before May 1, 2026. The historical normalization cycle shows that BOJ hikes have been very gradual with increasing spacing (e.g., 4 months then 6 then 11). Today is January 29, 2026 and the next two meetings (in March and April) are potential opportunities. Most surveys (e.g., Bloomberg’s survey of 52 economists) show only about 17% of forecasters expecting a hike in April; many favor a move later (June or July). Given that the January meeting held at 0.75% and the BOJ’s comments emphasizing “assessment” and “data gathering” rather than accelerating rates, the evidence supports a low likelihood of another hike before May 1.

(a) Source analysis: 
• Trading Economics (Jan 2026) and NHK: factual reporting of the January hold at 0.75% with an 8–1 vote, with detailed BOJ guidance but no immediacy toward a hike.
• Oxford Economics and ING THINK (Jan 2026) provide forecasts with some scenarios suggesting later hikes (October or mid‐2026), while one dissenting BOJ member and some market analysts foresee the possibility of an earlier rate move if yen weakness worsens.
• Reuters and Investment platforms (e.g., Investing.com, Market Screener) reporting on BOJ minutes and governor comments indicate that, though conditions such as persistent inflation and yen depreciation exist, the Board is not rushing and is methodical.
• Multiple Asknews articles (from The Epoch Times, JP, and others) confirm that while some market chatter—in particular, signals from Governor Ueda—has raised the possibility of an April move, the extent of consensus is limited and relies on an “if” scenario.

Overall, factual details (vote breakdowns, current rate, and official minutes) are reliable, while opinion pieces and survey data from Bloomberg, Reuters, and agency expectations (17% chance for April) provide identifiable expert viewpoints.

(b) Evidence analysis:
• Strong evidence: The precise meeting minutes and vote breakdown from Trading Economics and the Asknews articles showing an 8–1 vote; Bloomberg survey data indicating roughly a 17% chance; these establish that although inflation and yen pressures exist, the BOJ’s gradualist historical approach and its “wait-and-see” stance strongly weigh against an immediate rate change.
• Moderate evidence: Oxford Economics and ING THINK forecast scenarios that point to hikes later in the year but acknowledge the risk of an accelerated move if yen depreciation worsens.
• Weak evidence: Anecdotal market chatter and speculative “next meeting” timing based solely on a few dissenting voices.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
The prediction timeframe is from January 29, 2026, to May 1, 2026 – roughly 92 days (about 3 months). There are two critical BOJ policy meetings available (likely in March and April). Should this timeframe be halved (i.e., only a month remains), the chance of a rate hike would drop further due to insufficient time for conditions to materially shift; if doubled (6 months), the probability would rise considerably as more meetings and data points would become available.

(d) Justification:
The most compelling factors influencing the low probability include:
1. The BOJ’s recent decision to hold the rate in January despite an 8–1 vote (with dissent favoring a hike) indicates cautious incrementalism.
2. The historical pattern of longer intervals between hikes in this normalization cycle (4, 6, then 11 months) suggests that another hike so quickly is atypical.
3. Consensus surveys (Bloomberg’s 52 economists) and multiple expert forecasts – while a minority (around 17%) argue for a near-term move – mostly expect a delay until later in 2026.
4. Structural indicators (persistent but only modestly rising inflation, recent yen weakness that has not yet breached extreme thresholds) underpin a “wait-and-see” approach.

Collectively, these factors justify adjusting the outside view base rate (near 14%–17% chance) downward slightly given the measured policy stance and the evidence favoring a more prolonged evaluation period.

Probability calibration
Based on the strong consensus of gradualism and the low probability indicated by multiple expert sources (approximately 17% from surveys) and our analysis of structural factors and historical patterns, I adjust the inside view for a rate hike before May 1, 2026 to about 14%. In other words, 14 out of 100 times I expect the BOJ to raise rates before that date.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Forecast the likelihood that, by May 1, 2026 (≈3 months), the BOJ raises its rate again.
2. Base rate: Prior data and current consensus indicate a low (≈14%–17%) probability.
3. Consistency: "14 out of 100 times, the BOJ raises its rate before May 1, 2026." This aligns with historical gradualism and current data.
4. Key evidence:
   – BOJ’s January 2026 minutes (8–1 vote to hold).
   – Bloomberg survey (17% for an April hike).
   – Historical spaced-out pattern of rate hikes in the current cycle.
5. Blind-spot: A rapid deterioration (e.g., sudden yen collapse or runaway inflation) could force an unexpected hike; if this occurs, my probability would be too low.
6. Status quo: Recent data and incremental policy changes support continuity, with minimal short-term surprises.

Probability: 14%
