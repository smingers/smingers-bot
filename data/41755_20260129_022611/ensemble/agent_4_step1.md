Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CNBC (18 Dec 2025).  Factual: the BoJ lifted the policy-balance rate to 0.75 % and inflation has exceeded 2 % for 44 months.  Opinion: Allianz GI CIO, ING, BofA give forward-looking rate-path guesses (identify authors— good quality but opinion).  High-quality mainstream outlet; facts cross-checked elsewhere.  
2. Investing.com calendar extract (23 Jan 2026).  Purely factual table of meeting dates and announced rates; minimal interpretation.  Reliable for the narrow data it covers.  
3. TradingEconomics.com (Jan 2026).  Factual: 0.75 % rate, vote 8-1, long time-series averages.  Opinion: house forecast that rate stays flat through 2026.  Data are scraped from BoJ releases; quality moderate-to-high.  
4. ING Think (Jan 2026).  Factual macro data on inflation, IP, retail sales.  Opinion: house view of next hike in Oct 2026.  ING is a reputable research shop; nevertheless forward projections are opinion.  
5. MarketPulse (Dec 2025).  Factual reporting of market-implied hike probability, Tankan numbers.  Opinion: analyst view that gradual hikes will continue.  Medium quality.  
6. Japan Times (16 Jan 2026).  Factual: Bloomberg survey of 52 economists— 0 % expect a Jan hike; 17 % April; 17 % June; 48 % July.  Good “wisdom-of-crowds” indicator.  
7. Agent report (compiled 29 Jan 2026).  Aggregates official BoJ statements (facts) and several private forecasts (opinions).  Reasonable secondary source.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Potential reference classes  
1. All BoJ policy-rate cycles since 1990.  Suitability: very small N but tailored to same institution & political constraints.  
2. All G-7 central-bank hiking cycles since 1990.  Larger N, but structural differences (BoJ typically much slower).  
3. Any advanced-economy central bank operating near the zero lower bound that has just exited negative rates (e.g., ECB 2022, SNB 2022).  Small sample but closest macro circumstances.

Chosen class: “Individual BoJ hiking decisions once a hike has just occurred.”  Despite small N, it directly reflects the unique institutional conservatism of the BoJ.

Empirical base rate from that class  
• 2006-07 cycle: Aug-2000 → no further hike within 3 m; Jul-2006 → next hike 7 m later; after Feb-2007 no hike for 17 y.  
• 2024-26 cycle: Mar-2024 → 4 m lag; Jul-2024 → 6 m; Jan-2025 → 11 m.  
Total observations: 4 completed “gaps”; 0/4 hikes occurred within 3 m of the previous one.  Crude base-rate ≈ 0 %.

Recognising small-sample noise, widen reference class to “BoJ hikes within 4 mths.”  Then 1/4 = 25 %.  Use that as an approximate upper-bound.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → 1 May 2026 = 93 days (≈ 3.1 months).  Within that window the BoJ will probably hold two scheduled meetings— mid-March and late-April.  Historically the BoJ has required a median 6–7 months between moves, making a sub-4-month turn-around uncommon.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• Institutional inertia: the BoJ is the slowest-moving G-7 central bank, with no historical precedent for back-to-back hikes inside three months.  
• Political calendar: a snap lower-house election is set for late-Feb 2026; BoJ traditionally avoids tightening immediately before or after elections.  
• Economists’ consensus (fact, not insider view): only 17 % in the Bloomberg poll think April 2026 is the timing; 34 % see any hike before May 1.  Market-implied probabilities are not far from that.  Consensus is a useful anchor for an outside view.  
• Adding a modest penalty for forecast herding and the 0/4 historical record, the raw base-rate of 25 % is probably too high; conversely, the survey’s 34 % could be inflated by recency bias from the Dec-2025 hike.  A middle-ground, slightly below the survey, seems reasonable.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor 1: Historical BoJ gap pattern → 0-25 % range.  
Anchor 2: Economist survey → 34 % chance by April.  
Blend: give double weight to the hard historical base (institutional behaviour), single weight to consensus.

Weighted mean = (2 × 0.25 + 0.34) / 3 ≈ 0.28 → 28 %.  
Adjust ±3 ppts for uncertainty due to tiny historical sample → 25-31 %.

Chosen outside-view probability = 29 %.

Outside View Prediction:
29 % chance that the Bank of Japan will raise its policy interest rate again before 1 May 2026.
