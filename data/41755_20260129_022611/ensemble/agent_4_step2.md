Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. TradingEconomics (29 Jan 2026 update) – factual data on current 0.75 % policy rate, vote split, historical series; high quality, timely.  
2. Oxford Economics note (Jan 2026) – reputable forecaster; baseline “final” hike mid-2026, but flags rising odds of earlier move; clearly separates facts vs. projection.  
3. NHK World, Nikkei, Reuters Japanese-language pieces (23-28 Jan 2026) – primary domestic news; provide meeting outcomes, upgraded GDP/CPI forecasts, Governor Ueda’s remarks. Reliable for hard facts, cautious on interpretations.  
4. Citigroup call in Economic Times (late-Jan 2026) – identifiable strategist, gives scenarios of up to three hikes; opinion but from credible market participant.  
5. ING Think (2 Jan 2026) – house economist; still sees next hike Oct-2026; useful as dissenting expert view.  
6. Swap-market commentary (Epoch Times / Investing.com etc., 28 Jan 2026) – quotes OIS pricing ≈ 80 % chance of 1 % policy rate by April; objective market data, though venue quality mixed.  
7. BoJ December-minutes release (28 Jan 2026) – primary document; confirms board view that real rates “significantly negative”, mentions some members envisage hikes “every few months”; strongest direct signal.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• December-minutes & 8-1 January vote show internal willingness; dissent for immediate +25 bp.  
• Yen weakness > 150/$ and 10-yr JGB yield 2.3 % create clear inflation pass-through risk, historically prompting BoJ action (2006, 2024 episodes).  
Moderate evidence  
• Market-implied probability (OIS, swaps) ≈ 70-80 % for 1 % by Apr; forward rates embed risk premium.  
• Snap election 8 Feb likely followed by larger fiscal stimulus, raising inflation expectations.  
• Spring wage negotiations start late-Feb; early indications (Rengo 5 % pay-rise demand) supportive of tightening.  
Weak/offsetting evidence  
• BoJ’s gradualist culture – average gap between 2024-25 hikes was 6.5 months.  
• Core-CPI forecast for FY-2026 only 1.9 %; still below explicit 2 % midpoint.  
• ING, majority of economist polls still place next hike July-2026 or later.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until window closes: 92.  Two scheduled policy meetings remain (18-19 Mar & 28-29 Apr).  If horizon were halved (46 days, only March meeting), probability would fall to ~25 %.  If doubled to 184 days (to Aug-2026), probability would rise to ~70 %.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (consensus surveys, BoJ past pacing) = 17 %.  
Up-pressure adjustments:  
+12  pp  Strong FX-inflation linkage & yen near 160/$ (historically a trigger).  
+10  pp  BoJ minutes: call for hikes “every few months”, real rates “significantly negative”; one dissent already.  
+6  pp   Derivative-market pricing & broad analyst shift to April possibility.  
Down-pressure adjustments:  
-5  pp  Institutional caution & need to see full spring wage data (arrive mid-Mar).  
-4  pp  Core-CPI forecast still < 2 %, giving doves cover to wait.  
Net shift: +19  pp ⇒ 17 % → 36 %.  Rounded to a cleaner 40 % to reflect residual tail risk of an emergency meeting and modelling uncertainty.  

Consistency: “In roughly 40 out of 100 comparable worlds the BoJ lifts the policy rate above 0.75 % before 1 May 2026.”  This balances a plausible but not dominant early-hike scenario against the inertia of BoJ tradition.

Probability calibration  
Final inside-view estimate = 40 % chance of at least one additional BoJ policy-rate increase (to ≥1 %) on or before 30 Apr 2026 inclusive.

Checklist:  
1. Event = BoJ raises policy rate again before 1 May 2026 (≈ 3 months).  
2. Base rate 17 %, final 40 % anchored to it.  
3. “40/100 times BoJ hikes by 1 May 2026” – coherent.  
4. Key evidence: a) Yen near 160/$; b) BoJ minutes cite need for hikes “every few months”; c) 8-1 vote with dissent; d) OIS pricing 80 % by Apr.  
5. Blind spot: Sharp yen rebound to <145/$ plus weak spring wages could remove urgency; would push true odds <20 %.  
6. Status-quo (no hike) still majority‐likely and supported by BoJ caution; small upward adjustment from base guard-railed to avoid over-reacting.  

Probability: 40%
