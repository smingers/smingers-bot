Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CNBC, 18 Dec 2025 – Straight‐news report written before the December 2025 hike.  Offers verifiable data (market‐implied probabilities, inflation, JGB yields) and attributed opinions from AllianzGI, ING, BofA, MFS.  Factual quality: high; opinions: mixed quality—only the banks’ house views are forward-looking conjecture.  
2. Investing.com data table, 23 Jan 2026 – Purely factual: meeting dates and resulting policy rate.  Good for chronology; no commentary.  
3. TradingEconomics, 23 Jan 2026 – Combines BoJ communiqué excerpts (factual) with the firm’s own macro projections (opinion).  Useful for historical averages.  
4. ING THINK note, early-Jan 2026 – Sell-side research piece; numbers on Tokyo CPI, IP, etc. are factual; ING’s timing call (next hike October 2026) is opinion.  
5. Marketpulse, mid-Dec 2025 – Preview piece written before the December hike; contains accurate market-implied odds and macro data; forward-looking statements are opinion.  
6. Japan Times, 16 Jan 2026 – Report of a Bloomberg economist survey.  The survey statistics (48 % expect July hike, etc.) are factual; any narrative around them is journalistic opinion.  
7. Agent report – Collates rate-change history 2023-26 with citations.  The dated rate decisions are factual; the synthesis of “consensus” is a secondary interpretation but still useful.

Overall: for a purely “outside” (base-rate) view the factual chronology of hikes (sources 2, 3, 7) matters most; the forward-looking house views (sources 1, 4, 5, 6) are not used at this stage.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. All BoJ policy-rate behaviour since 1999.  
2. BoJ behaviour once it starts a tightening cycle (Mar 2024–present).  
3. Early-cycle behaviour of other G-7 central banks after exiting the zero or negative bound.  

Class 1 captures long-run Japanese conservatism but averages over 17 zero-rate years (very few hikes).  Class 3 suffers from cross-country structural differences.  Class 2 isolates the current regime (post-NIRP, inflation finally above target) and therefore balances sample size with relevance.  I adopt Class 2.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Forecast window: 29 Jan 2026 → 1 May 2026 = 93 days ≈ 3.1 months.  
• Within the current cycle (19 Mar 2024 → 29 Jan 2026 = 22 months) we have 4 hikes.  
  – Average interval between hikes: 170 days (≈ 5.6 months).  
  – Minimum interval observed: 122 days (Mar → Jul 2024).  
• Number of 3-month blocks in the period: 22 months / 3 ≈ 7.3.  Four of those blocks contained at least one hike → empirical hit-rate 4⁄7.3 ≈ 55 %.  
• Translating to a simple Poisson-process hazard: λ ≈ 4 hikes / 22 months = 0.18 hikes · month⁻¹.  Probability of ≥1 hike in 3.1 months = 1 – e^(-λ·3.1) = 1 – e^(-0.56) ≈ 43 %.

(d) Justification  
The BoJ since March 2024 is running a very slow, “quarter-speed” hiking process relative to peers.  If we model hikes as a random, memoryless event whose frequency is characterised by the realised 0.18 hikes per month, an outside observer with no extra information would assign roughly a low-40s percent chance of one more move during any forthcoming three-month window.  This base rate neither factors in the known snap election (likely dampening odds) nor the economists’ July-centric consensus (also dampening odds).  Those will be used at an “inside-view” stage, not here.  For the outside view we stay with the historical frequency estimate, with a modest uncertainty adjustment (±10 pp) because only four data points underpin λ.

Outside view calibration:
• Raw Poisson-based probability for a 93-day window: 43 %.  
• Data-sparsity/ regime-shift uncertainty: widen by ±10 pp → plausible 33 – 53 % band.  
• Centre of band (rounded to nearest whole percent) = 43 %.

Outside View Prediction:
43 % chance that the Bank of Japan raises its policy interest rate again before 1 May 2026.
