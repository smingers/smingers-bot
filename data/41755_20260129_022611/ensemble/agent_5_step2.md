Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (abbreviated to the most policy-relevant items)

1. BoJ January-26 communiqué & minutes (NHK World, Investing.com JP, Market Screener, Reuters JP, Epoch Times quoting Reuters)  
   • Date: 22-23 Jan 2026 decisions, minutes released 28 Jan 2026.  
   • Factual: rate = 0.75 %, vote 8-1, inflation/GDP forecasts raised, board language that more hikes “if outlook realised”.  
   • Opinion: journalists’ inference that March/April hike is likely.  High source quality for facts; opinion quality moderate.

2. OIS/swap market pricing (Reuters, Bloomberg surveys as reported by Epoch Times, Japan Times, Economic Times)  
   • 80 % implied probability of a 25 bp hike by April; 90 % of swaps price ≥1 % by December.  
   • Market data are objective; interpretation by reporters is opinion.  High quality for factual probabilities.

3. Sell-side research  
   • Oxford Economics (Jan 2026): baseline final hike to 1 % mid-2026, but “one-to-two” earlier possible.  
   • Citigroup (Jan 2026): up to three hikes in 2026, first as early as April.  
   • ING THINK (Jan 2026): next hike most likely Oct-2026.  
   • All are identifiable experts; quality moderate (track records mixed).

4. TradingEconomics snapshot (Jan-26 2026)  
   • Confirms current 0.75 %, history of two hikes in 2025.  Purely factual, high quality.

5. Background macro items (Nikkei, JP Morgan PB, OCBC)  
   • Headline CPI easing to 2 %, but core still 2.6 %; yen briefly touched 160/$; Shunto wage demands >5 %.  
   • Mostly factual; opinions (e.g., “BoJ behind the curve”) are moderate strength.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Evidence favouring “Yes – hike before 1 May 2026”
Strong
• Market-implied odds: 80 % chance of ≥1 hike by April (multiple independent data vendors).  
• Structural fact: real policy rate still ≈ –1 %, BoJ states rate below neutral (1 – 2.5 %) and will “continue normalising”.

Moderate
• Board dissent (Takata) and minutes noting “few-months interval” cadence. This historically preceded previous hikes by ≤2 meetings.  
• Persistent yen weakness (¥153–160/$) adding cost-push pressure; board explicitly cites FX risk to inflation.  
• Spring wage negotiations: labour unions asking >5 % rises, matching BoJ’s condition for “virtuous cycle”.

Weak
• Political cover: snap election ends 8 Feb 2026, potentially freeing BoJ to move – speculative.

Evidence favouring “No – hold until after 1 May 2026”
Moderate
• Headline CPI trending below 2 % in near term; ING and about half of Bloomberg-survey economists project next move July-26 or later.  
• Historical cadence: average gap between hikes since Mar-24 is 5.6 months; March meeting would fall at 3.0 months, shorter than any gap so far.

Weak
• Possible yen rebound if U.S./Japan intervene; could relieve pressure to hike.  
• BoJ culture of caution; Ueda stresses need to “see full wage data”.

Net weighting: two strong + three moderate on “Yes” vs two moderate on “No” ⇒ tilt  +17 pp relative to 43 % base rate (see justification).

(c) Timeframe
Forecast window: 29 Jan → 01 May 2026 = 93 days (≈3.1 months) and includes two scheduled MPMs (18-19 Mar, 27-28 Apr).  
If window were halved (to mid-Mar) probability falls to ~35 % (hike at March meeting only).  
If doubled (to early Aug) probability rises to ~80 % as July MPM enters window.

(d) Justification / adjustment from base rate 43 %
+15 pp: market-implied 80 % odds are historically one of the best single predictors of near-term G-7 rate moves.  
+5 pp: real rate deeply negative & BoJ’s own guidance (“continue if outlook realised”) – structural.  
+2 pp: board dissent and pattern of action within two meetings.  
–5 pp: inflation dip and BoJ’s slow cadence make sub-four-month gap unprecedented.  
Total adjustment: +17 pp ⇒ 60 %.

Probability calibration
I assign a 60 % chance that the Bank of Japan will raise its policy interest rate at or before the April 27-28 2026 MPM, i.e., before 1 May 2026.  This corresponds to odds of 3:2 in favour.  I will update ±10 pp if (a) February CPI (released mid-Mar) prints ≤1.5 % y/y (downward) or (b) USD/JPY again breaches ¥160 before the March meeting (upward).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between now (29 Jan 26) and 1 May 26 will BoJ lift policy rate above 0.75 %?”  
2. Base rate: 43 % (four hikes in 22 months → λ = 0.18 / mo).  
3. Consistency: “About 60 times in 100, BoJ hikes once more in next three months.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) swap market 80 % April pricing; (ii) BoJ minutes cite further hikes, real rate –1 %; (iii) yen near 160/$; (iv) board dissent 8-1; (v) CPI still ≥2 % core.  
5. Blind-spot: A sharp yen rebound to <¥145 and inflation dive <1.5 % could stay BoJ’s hand – would cut probability to ~30 %.  
6. Status-quo bias check: holding rates is still plausible; probability kept well below market-implied 80 % to reflect BoJ conservatism and short historical sample.

Probability: 60%
