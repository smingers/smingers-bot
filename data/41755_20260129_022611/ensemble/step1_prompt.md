# Summary of CNBC Article: "Bank of Japan is poised to raise rates to a 30-year high despite economic weakness"

**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**Author:** Lim Hui Jie

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Current Meeting:** The Bank of Japan began its last policy meeting of the year on Thursday, with a decision expected Friday
- **Expected Rate Hike:** Rates anticipated to rise to 0.75% — the highest since 1995
- **Probability:** LSEG data shows an 86.4% probability of a rate hike
- **Inflation:** Has run above the BOJ's target for 44 consecutive months
- **Economic Contraction:** Revised Q3 GDP showed Japan's economy contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 2.3% on an annualized basis
- **Yen Performance:** Trading around 154-157 against the dollar since November; weakened over 2.5% since PM Takaichi took office in October
- **Bond Yields:** 10-year Japanese government bonds hovering near 18-year highs at 1.971%
- **Borrowing Cost Projections:** If benchmark yields rise to 2.5%, Japan's interest payments could jump to 16.1 trillion yen in fiscal 2028 compared to 7.9 trillion yen in fiscal 2024

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Gregor MA Hirt** (Global Multi-Asset CIO, Allianz Global Investors): Market reaction will depend on the nuances of BOJ communication; signals around the neutral/terminal rate and comments on yen weakness will be important to watch
- **Governor Kazuo Ueda:** Said earlier this month it was difficult to estimate the terminal rate; the BOJ pegs it at 1% to 2.5%; stated the BOJ must guide policy without clarity on where exactly the neutral rate lies
- **ING (Dutch bank):** While the market largely expects another hike in June 2026, it's more likely the BOJ will next raise rates only in October
- **Bank of America:** Estimates a hike in June, while not entirely discounting a fast-forward to April if the yen weakens rapidly; expects the central bank to bring the terminal rate to 1.5% by end 2027
- **MFS' Ang:** There are some risks to Japan's policy normalization path (including U.S. economic slowdown and escalating China-Japan tensions), but it would take a "material shock" to veer the BOJ away from its rate trajectory; expects the yen to stay between 150 and 160 against the dollar next year

## Additional Context:

- Japan began policy normalization last year, abandoning the world's only negative interest rate regime that had been in place since 2016
- Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi initially opposed rate hikes during her leadership contest but has since softened her stance
- Japan has unleashed its largest stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy
- Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama has not ruled out forex market intervention

# Summary of ING THINK Article on Bank of Japan Rate Policy

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Recent Economic Data:**

- USD/JPY ended 2025 at 156.63

**GDP Forecasts:**
- Expected Q4 rebound of 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, annualized (after 2.3% contraction in Q3)

## Analyst Opinions and Forecasts (ING - Named Source):

**Rate Hike Timing:**
- **Most likely timing for next rate hike: October 2026** (second half of 2026)
- Could potentially move forward to Q2 2026 if fiscal health concerns arise and JPY weakens further
- Expected 25 basis point hike in October
- Policy rate may reach as high as 1.50% by end of 2027

**Rationale for Delayed Timing:**
- Headline inflation expected to drop below 2% in coming months
- Core inflation expected to decelerate toward 2% due to base effects
- BoJ likely to assess impact of previous rate hikes before proceeding
- BoJ will wait to confirm core inflation remains above 2% and outpaces headline inflation

**Supporting Factors for Future Tightening:**
- Major labor unions planning wage growth over 5%
- Strong corporate earnings expected to support solid wage growth
- Government shopping voucher and cash payout programs expected to stimulate consumption
- Core inflation expected to remain above 2% due to strong wage growth and government aid

**Currency Expectations:**
- USD/JPY expected to appreciate modestly in first half of 2026 as US-Japan interest rate differentials narrow
- Gradual Federal Reserve rate cuts in first half of 2026 may strengthen JPY toward 150
- JPY expected to remain range-bound in near term

## Information from BoJ Meeting Minutes (December):

- Some board members noted real interest rate remains very low
- Central bank needs to adjust degree of monetary accommodation
- One member argued BoJ should adjust policy with intervals of a few months
- Overall board stance shifted toward more hawkish position, but pace will remain slow

## Additional Context:

- Inflation decline driven by renewed energy subsidies, stable rice prices, and low petroleum costs
- Government increasing winter energy subsidies
- Manufacturing decline in November viewed as likely temporary

# Summary of Article: "BoJ preview: Interest rate hike baked in, what's next for the JPY (further appreciation)?"

**Source:** Marketpulse  
**Author:** Kelvin Wong, Senior Market Analyst

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Market Expectations:** Markets assign a ~94% probability to a 25 basis point BoJ rate hike to 0.75% (as of the article's publication date)

2. **Timing:** The expected hike would occur on Friday, December 19, which would bring the overnight policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years

3. **Previous Rate Action:** This would be the second hike in the year, following an 11-month pause since January's hike

4. **Historical Context:** If executed, this would mark the first instance since the BoJ adopted its two-day meeting format in 1998 that it and the Federal Reserve move policy rates in opposite directions within the same month

5. **Economic Indicators:**
   - Q4 Tankan business sentiment survey for large manufacturing companies rose to almost a 3-year high at 15.0
   - Consumer sentiment rose to a 19-month high of 37.50 in November 2025 (improved since April 2025)

   - Additional support levels at 153.70 and 152.95
   - Resistance levels at 156.60 and 157.00/157.15

## Key Opinions:

**From the analyst (Kelvin Wong):**
- The BoJ is likely to continue its gradual interest rate hike cycle into 2026
- Policy divergence favors JPY structurally, as the BoJ is the only major central bank tightening while the Fed eases
- USD/JPY near-term bias is bearish, with technicals signaling fading upside momentum

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a chronological list of every Bank of Japan policy interest-rate change from January 2023 through January 2026, including meeting dates, new rates, vote tallies, and key forward-guidance language; then summarize economists’ consensus on further hikes as of January 2026.
Chronological record of Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy-rate changes, 1 Jan 2023 – 31 Jan 2026  

1. 18–19 Mar 2024 Monetary Policy Meeting (decision released 19 Mar 2024)  
   • New policy-balance rate band widened from –0.10 % to “around 0 % – +0.10 %,” formally terminating the Negative Interest-Rate Policy (NIRP) and Yield-Curve Control (YCC) (Al Jazeera, 19 Mar 2024).  
   • Vote Not reported in Al Jazeera or Kyodo copy retrieved; the BOJ PDF “Monetary Policy Decisions (19 Mar 2024)” is available but requires manual extraction.  
   • Key forward guidance Statement said accommodative financial conditions “will be maintained for the time being,” but the Bank “will not hesitate to take additional measures if a virtuous wage-price cycle strengthens” (Al Jazeera, 19 Mar 2024).  

2. 30–31 Jul 2024 Monetary Policy Meeting (decision 31 Jul 2024)  
   • New rate Short-term target raised to +0.25 % from the 0–0.10 % range—first positive-rate hike in 17 years (Japan Times, 31 Jul 2024).  
   • Vote Vote split not given in Japan Times article; BOJ’s “Decisions at the July 2024 MPM” PDF is cited by the central-bank site but has not yet been parsed.  
   • Forward guidance The statement stressed that “real interest rates remain significantly negative” and pledged to cut JGB purchases by half through March 2026, with another review scheduled for June 2025 (Japan Times, 31 Jul 2024).

3. 22–24 Jan 2025 MPM (decision 24 Jan 2025*)  
   • New rate Target corridor lifted 25 bp to 0.40 – 0.50 % (“about 0.5 %”) (AP News & FXStreet, 24 Jan 2025).  
   • Vote 8 – 1; Policy Board member Toyoaki Nakamura dissented, preferring to wait for additional earnings data (FXStreet, 23 Jan 2025).  
   • Forward guidance Governor Ueda: “still a long way to the neutral rate,” policy will be decided “meeting by meeting” (FXStreet, 23 Jan 2025).

4. 18–19 Dec 2025 MPM (decision 19 Dec 2025)  
   • New rate Raised another 25 bp to +0.75 %, the highest since 1995 (Japan Times, 19 Dec 2025; CNBC, 19 Dec 2025).  
   • Vote Unanimous 9 – 0, confirmed by minutes released 28 Jan 2026 (NHK World summary cited by nippon.com, 28 Jan 2026).  
   • Forward guidance Stated that “real yields are still low” and that the BOJ “stands ready to tighten further should the wage-price cycle strengthen” (Reuters excerpts via CNBC, 19 Dec 2025).

(*News agencies date the decision 24 Jan because of time-zone conventions.)

No policy-rate action occurred during calendar 2023. The 22–23 Jan 2026 meeting left the rate unchanged at 0.75 % (8–1 vote) and therefore is outside the list of “changes,” but its forward-looking remarks inform the consensus discussion (CNBC, 23 Jan 2026).

Economists’ consensus on further moves as of end-January 2026  

• Bloomberg survey of 52 economists (16 Jan 2026) – median expectation: one more 25 bp hike by July 2026; inter-quartile window April–October 2026 (Japan Times, 16 Jan 2026).  
• State Street Global Markets (comment 23 Jan 2026) – base case: one hike in 2026 and one in 2027 to a 1.25 % terminal rate; if USD/JPY breaches ¥160 two hikes in 2026 are pencilled in (CNBC, 23 Jan 2026).  
• ING Think-ING note (Jan 2026) – projects a single 25 bp increase in 2H 2026; terminal 1.50 % by end-2027.  
• Oxford Economics flash comment (24 Jan 2026) – baseline still one hike to 1 % in mid-2026, with “one or two more” under review given yen weakness and looser fiscal policy.  

Synthesis: After four rate increases totalling roughly 85 bp since March 2024, the consensus remains that normalization will proceed at a glacial pace. Almost all forecasters cluster around one additional 25 bp move—lifting the policy rate to 1.0 %—sometime in mid-2026. Upside risk stems from a weaker yen or stronger wage settlements; downside risk from political pressure for easier policy ahead of the February 2026 snap election.

Information gaps that remain  

• Precise vote tallies for the 19 Mar 2024 and 31 Jul 2024 decisions.  
• Verbatim forward-guidance paragraphs for those two statements (only headline summaries are captured in open-source media).  

Both items should reside in the BOJ primary PDFs already identified:  
– “Monetary Policy Decisions (19 Mar 2024)”  
– “Decisions at the July 2024 Monetary Policy Meeting”  

Extracting the tables labelled “Votes” and the sections headed “Outlook and forward guidance” from these documents would complete the record and provide primary-source verification for every entry.</Agent_report>
