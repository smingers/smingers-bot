Analysis:
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) turned its short-term policy rate positive in 2025 after nearly a decade of negative rates. Since then, market participants have debated how quickly the BOJ will “normalize” policy amid still-modest inflation and a fragile growth outlook. To judge whether another hike will occur before May 1 2026, the most relevant information includes:
• Statements from Governor Kazuo Ueda or other Policy Board members about the pace of further normalization.  
• Outcomes and summaries of the January 22-23 2026 Monetary Policy Meeting as well as any hints for the April 2026 meeting.  
• Market pricing of overnight index swaps or futures implying the probability of a hike by April 2026.  
• Economic data (wage negotiations, inflation, yen FX moves) influencing the BOJ’s reaction function.  
• Commentary from major banks and think-tanks revising their forecasts after the January 2026 meeting.
