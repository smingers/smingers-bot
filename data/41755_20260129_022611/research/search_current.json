Despite raising the policy rate to 0.75%\u2014its highest level in 30 years\u2014the BOJ's nine-member policy board remains prepared to continue raising rates, as real interest rates remain 'significantly negative,' signaling still-easy financial conditions. All members agreed that future hikes depend on progress toward growth targets and inflation outlooks. Some members expressed caution, while others emphasized that persistent inflation is becoming more entrenched due to firms passing wage and input cost increases to consumers. A key concern is the weakening yen, which raises import costs and intensifies inflationary pressure. One member noted that the yen\u2019s depreciation and rising long-term yields stem from policy rates being too low relative to inflation, and that timely rate hikes could curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. The yen briefly approached 160 JPY per USD in early January, then rebounded over 3% to around 153 JPY/USD amid speculation of potential U.S.-Japan interest rate coordination\u2014a possible precursor to official intervention. On inflation, core CPI reached 2.1% in December 2025, sustaining four consecutive years above the BOJ\u2019s 2% target. While the board unanimously approved rate hikes, views differed on inflation progress: some members, including Hajime Takata and Naoki Tamura, believed Japan had already reached or was nearing price stability, taking a more optimistic stance than the official statement. Takata had previously advocated for faster rate hikes in January 2026, but lacked support. Market expectations now suggest a potential rate hike before July 2026, with over 75% of analysts forecasting a rate of 1% or higher by September.

Despite raising the policy rate to 0.75%\u2014the highest in 30 years\u2014the BOJ's nine-member policy board remains prepared to continue tightening monetary policy. Several committee members noted that the real interest rate remains 'significantly negative,' implying that financial conditions are still accommodative. All members agreed that future rate decisions will depend on progress toward economic growth targets and inflation outlooks. While some members advocate caution, others stress that persistent inflation is driven by firms passing on wage and input cost increases to consumers. A key concern is the weakening yen, which raises import costs and exacerbates inflationary pressures, especially amid rising wages and prices. One member suggested a gradual tightening every few months, given that the current rate remains far below the neutral level. Another emphasized the need to assess broader indicators, including anecdotal evidence, to determine whether a sustained wage-price spiral has taken hold. The minutes also reflect concern over the yen\u2019s depreciation, which has increased living costs and become a central issue ahead of Japan\u2019s February 8 general election. Although exchange rate management is not a direct policy goal, members acknowledged that yen depreciation impacts inflation and potential inflation. One member argued that timely rate hikes could curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. The yen briefly approached 160 JPY per USD in early January, then rebounded over 3% in two days to around 153 JPY/USD, possibly due to speculation of potential US-Japan interest rate coordination (a signal of official intervention). On inflation, core CPI reached 2.1% in December 2025, exceeding the BOJ\u2019s 2% target for four consecutive years. Some members, including Hajime Takata and Naoki Tamura, expressed optimism that Japan has achieved or is near price stability, more so than the official statement. Takata had previously urged rapid rate hikes in January but lacked support. Market expectations now suggest a likely rate hike in the coming months, with Reuters surveying analysts predicting a hike by July, over 75% forecasting rates to reach 1% or higher by September. The swap market assigns an 80% probability to a rate increase to 1.0% before April, citing concerns that yen weakness will accelerate inflation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:36 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/1/28/n14686171.htm)\n\n**NY's View: BOJ May Plan Additional Rate Hike in March or April**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided at its January 22\u201323, 2026, monetary policy meeting to maintain its policy interest rate\u2014the target for the unsecured overnight call rate\u2014at 0.75%, with a majority vote of 8 in favor and 1 against. In its outlook report, the BOJ raised its projections for real GDP growth in fiscal year 2026 to a +1.0% year-on-year increase and increased its core CPI forecast from +1.8% (as of October 2025) to +1.9%. The BOJ reiterated that, given extremely low real interest rates and if current economic and inflation outlooks materialize, it will continue to raise policy rates in response to further improvements in economic and price conditions. The sole dissenting vote came from Sh\u014d Takata, a governor who proposed raising rates to 1.0%, but his proposal was rejected by a majority. Takata argued that the inflation target has been largely achieved and that domestic inflation upside risks are high, given the global economic recovery. The BOJ reaffirmed its projection that underlying inflation rates will remain aligned with the inflation target in the second half of its forecast period, which ends in fiscal year 2027. Market participants are now speculating that the BOJ is positioning itself for an additional rate hike in March or April 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-1400525)\n\n**BoJ's 'Quiet Transformation': Governor Ueda's January 2026 Press Conference Signals High Likelihood of April Rate Hike**\nThe Bank of Japan's January 2026 policy meeting, led by Governor Kazuo Ueda, maintained the policy interest rate at 0.75%, consistent with market expectations. While Ueda stated that the likelihood of achieving the 2% inflation target had increased compared to the October outlook report, he did not indicate an earlier-than-expected timing for the next rate hike. The governor expressed caution regarding the rapid depreciation of the yen, noting its growing impact on domestic prices, but offered no new policy specifics. On long-term interest rates, Ueda acknowledged they were rising 'at a very fast pace,' yet avoided committing to specific measures\u2014whether through flexible government bond purchases or a review of quantitative tightening (QT) pace\u2014stating only that the Bank would closely monitor developments in coordination with the government, respecting each institution\u2019s role. Despite the market interpreting the tone as mildly dovish, the Bank\u2019s cautious language\u2014particularly the emphasis on assessing whether current monetary tightening is hindering sustained wage and price growth\u2014suggests a potential shift toward a more hawkish stance. As a result, the probability of a rate hike in April has significantly increased, though the Bank's current tools may still be insufficient to halt the yen\u2019s downward trend. Four key points from the governor\u2019s press conference indicate the Bank may be preparing for a rate increase as early as April 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://diamond.jp/articles/-/382591)\n\n**Rising Interest Rates Expected in Japan, Financial Stocks Rise**\nAccording to the minutes from the Bank of Japan's December 2024 meeting, policymakers unanimously agreed that further interest rate hikes are necessary, with some emphasizing the role of the weak yen in underlying inflation and the timing of the next rate increase. The Bank of Japan had raised its policy rate to 0.75%\u2014its highest level in 30 years\u2014by the end of 2024, but still considers the current rate too low and plans to continue raising borrowing costs, which remain at a low level. All participants at the December meeting believed that given Japan's very low real interest rates, further rate hikes would be appropriate if economic growth and inflation proceed as expected. Although currency market volatility is not the primary goal of monetary policy, the Bank of Japan must consider how yen depreciation affects prices and core inflation. One policymaker stated that the weak yen and rising long-term interest rates are partly due to the policy rate being significantly below inflation, and raising rates promptly could help curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. On January 28, 2026, Japanese stocks opened lower, with most financial stocks declining despite expectations of future rate hikes: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0.5%, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group dropped 1.2%, while Mizuho Financial Group rose 0.7%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:41 AM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260128701022-430701)\n\n**BOJ Officials Signal More Caution on Yen Risk to Inflation**\nBank of Japan (BOJ) policy board members have expressed growing caution about the inflationary risks posed by the yen's depreciation, according to meeting minutes from the December 18\u201319, 2025, session released on January 28, 2026. The yen weakened to nearly 160 per dollar\u2014its weakest level since July 2024\u2014prompting concerns over potential government intervention, possibly coordinated with the U.S., though such action has eased downward pressure. While the final decision on intervention rests with Japan\u2019s finance ministry, the BOJ emphasized close monitoring of the currency. Some board members noted that as firms increasingly raise wages and prices, a weaker yen could fuel inflation through higher import costs and shift inflation expectations. This concern comes amid the BOJ\u2019s December 2025 decision to raise its policy rate to a three-decade high of 0.75%, reflecting increased confidence in wage growth. However, the yen\u2019s continued decline since then complicates inflation assessments, as cost-push inflation and reduced household purchasing power conflict with the central bank\u2019s demand-led growth targets. The minutes also highlighted concerns about rising long-term interest rates, particularly the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield, which reached a 27-year high of 2.38%. Market attention has intensified due to sharp JGB volatility, driven by fears over fiscal policy, including Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s plan to suspend the sales tax on food and beverages\u2014a move she insists will not be deficit-financed. If her Liberal Democratic Party wins the upcoming lower house election, it could gain stronger momentum to implement aggressive economic policies. One BOJ member argued that the current policy rate may be too low relative to inflation, stating that timely rate hikes could curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. Markets are now reassessing the timing of the next BOJ rate hike, following a hold in the bank\u2019s first 2026 decision after the December increase.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:02 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/boj-officials-signal-more-caution-on-yen-risk-to-inflation-ce7e5bd9d98cf025)\n\n**Yen Rises to 152-Dollar Level Amid Japan-U.S. Coordination Signals After G7 Meeting**\nOn January 27, 2026, the Japanese yen briefly strengthened to a level of 152 yen per dollar in the foreign exchange market\u2014the first time since November 7, 2025, over three months earlier. This rise followed remarks by Finance Minister Satsuki Kataoka during a press briefing after the G7 Finance Ministers' Meeting, in which she stated that Japan would 'closely coordinate with U.S. authorities as necessary' and take appropriate action. The statement rekindled market expectations of coordinated intervention between Japanese and U.S. monetary authorities, driving yen demand. This follows a previous peak of 159 yen per dollar during a press conference by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on January 23, 2026, marking a rise of over 6 yen in just three trading days. Market sentiment shifted after speculation that the U.S. authorities had conducted rate checks following Ueda\u2019s comments, with analysts interpreting this as evidence of joint efforts to prevent excessive yen depreciation, thereby triggering a sharp yen appreciation. On January 26, 2026, Finance Ministry official Jun Miyamura declined to comment on rate checks, stating, 'I have no intention of responding.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:41 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB269UF0W6A120C2000000/)\n\n**BOJ\u2019s Strategic CPI Presentation: Balancing Inflation Signals Amid Yen Volatility**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its current monetary policy at the January 22\u201323, 2024, policy meeting, consistent with market expectations. Despite having recently raised rates to 0.75%\u2014breaking the 0.5% barrier for the first time in 30 years\u2014no immediate policy change occurred, influenced by political neutrality concerns following Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dji's announcement of a House of Representatives dissolution. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda refrained from making market-moving statements during his press conference. Initially, media reports (e.g., Bloomberg, Kyodo News) anticipated a downward revision to the 2026 fiscal year CPI core (excluding fresh food) forecast due to government anti-inflation measures like the end of temporary gasoline tax and utility cost relief. However, later reports (e.g., Reuters, Nikkei, Bloomberg) shifted to a hawkish tone, suggesting upward revisions to both GDP and CPI core forecasts, citing yen depreciation and wage-price pass-through pressures. Ultimately, the BOJ's January 23 outlook report revised the 2026 fiscal year CPI core forecast upward to +1.9% from +1.8%, and the underlying 'core inflation rate' was also upwardly revised for 2025, 2026, and 2027. The article argues this 'presentation' of data\u2014emphasizing the gradual rise in core inflation despite near-term CPI dips\u2014was strategically designed to signal potential future rate hikes without triggering premature market expectations. The author concludes that the BOJ\u2019s future rate hike timing will largely depend on foreign exchange market movements, with further yen depreciation increasing the likelihood of a rate hike, while yen appreciation could delay or reduce the need for additional tightening.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:28 AM\nSource:[JP](https://jp.reuters.com/opinion/forex-forum/O6MRUFIGSJLFDPNLPYLHVTD6MA-2026-01-27/)\n\n**BOJ Minutes: Future Rate Hikes to Balance Inflation and Economic Growth**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) released its December 2025 meeting minutes on January 28, 2026, indicating that future interest rate hikes will be guided by a balance between inflation and economic growth.

Despite raising the policy rate to 0.75%\u2014the highest in 30 years\u2014the BOJ's nine-member policy board remains prepared to continue tightening monetary policy. Several committee members noted that the real interest rate remains 'significantly negative,' implying that financial conditions are still accommodative. All members agreed that future rate decisions will depend on progress toward economic growth targets and inflation outlooks. While some members advocate caution, others stress that persistent inflation is driven by firms passing on wage and input cost increases to consumers. A key concern is the weakening yen, which raises import costs and exacerbates inflationary pressures, especially amid rising wages and prices. One member suggested a gradual tightening every few months, given that the current rate remains far below the neutral level. Another emphasized the need to assess broader indicators, including anecdotal evidence, to determine whether a sustained wage-price spiral has taken hold. The minutes also reflect concern over the yen\u2019s depreciation, which has increased living costs and become a central issue ahead of Japan\u2019s February 8 general election. Although exchange rate management is not a direct policy goal, members acknowledged that yen depreciation impacts inflation and potential inflation. One member argued that timely rate hikes could curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. The yen briefly approached 160 JPY per USD in early January, then rebounded over 3% in two days to around 153 JPY/USD, possibly due to speculation of potential US-Japan interest rate coordination (a signal of official intervention). On inflation, core CPI reached 2.1% in December 2025, exceeding the BOJ\u2019s 2% target for four consecutive years. Some members, including Hajime Takata and Naoki Tamura, expressed optimism that Japan has achieved or is near price stability, more so than the official statement. Takata had previously urged rapid rate hikes in January but lacked support. Market expectations now suggest a likely rate hike in the coming months, with Reuters surveying analysts predicting a hike by July, over 75% forecasting rates to reach 1% or higher by September. The swap market assigns an 80% probability to a rate increase to 1.0% before April, citing concerns that yen weakness will accelerate inflation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:36 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/1/28/n14686171.htm)\n\n**NY's View: BOJ May Plan Additional Rate Hike in March or April**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided at its January 22\u201323, 2026, monetary policy meeting to maintain its policy interest rate\u2014the target for the unsecured overnight call rate\u2014at 0.75%, with a majority vote of 8 in favor and 1 against. In its outlook report, the BOJ raised its projections for real GDP growth in fiscal year 2026 to a +1.0% year-on-year increase and increased its core CPI forecast from +1.8% (as of October 2025) to +1.9%. The BOJ reiterated that, given extremely low real interest rates and if current economic and inflation outlooks materialize, it will continue to raise policy rates in response to further improvements in economic and price conditions. The sole dissenting vote came from Sh\u014d Takata, a governor who proposed raising rates to 1.0%, but his proposal was rejected by a majority. Takata argued that the inflation target has been largely achieved and that domestic inflation upside risks are high, given the global economic recovery. The BOJ reaffirmed its projection that underlying inflation rates will remain aligned with the inflation target in the second half of its forecast period, which ends in fiscal year 2027. Market participants are now speculating that the BOJ is positioning itself for an additional rate hike in March or April 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-1400525)\n\n**BoJ's 'Quiet Transformation': Governor Ueda's January 2026 Press Conference Signals High Likelihood of April Rate Hike**\nThe Bank of Japan's January 2026 policy meeting, led by Governor Kazuo Ueda, maintained the policy interest rate at 0.75%, consistent with market expectations. While Ueda stated that the likelihood of achieving the 2% inflation target had increased compared to the October outlook report, he did not indicate an earlier-than-expected timing for the next rate hike. The governor expressed caution regarding the rapid depreciation of the yen, noting its growing impact on domestic prices, but offered no new policy specifics. On long-term interest rates, Ueda acknowledged they were rising 'at a very fast pace,' yet avoided committing to specific measures\u2014whether through flexible government bond purchases or a review of quantitative tightening (QT) pace\u2014stating only that the Bank would closely monitor developments in coordination with the government, respecting each institution\u2019s role. Despite the market interpreting the tone as mildly dovish, the Bank\u2019s cautious language\u2014particularly the emphasis on assessing whether current monetary tightening is hindering sustained wage and price growth\u2014suggests a potential shift toward a more hawkish stance. As a result, the probability of a rate hike in April has significantly increased, though the Bank's current tools may still be insufficient to halt the yen\u2019s downward trend. Four key points from the governor\u2019s press conference indicate the Bank may be preparing for a rate increase as early as April 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://diamond.jp/articles/-/382591)\n\n**Rising Interest Rates Expected in Japan, Financial Stocks Rise**\nAccording to the minutes from the Bank of Japan's December 2024 meeting, policymakers unanimously agreed that further interest rate hikes are necessary, with some emphasizing the role of the weak yen in underlying inflation and the timing of the next rate increase. The Bank of Japan had raised its policy rate to 0.75%\u2014its highest level in 30 years\u2014by the end of 2024, but still considers the current rate too low and plans to continue raising borrowing costs, which remain at a low level. All participants at the December meeting believed that given Japan's very low real interest rates, further rate hikes would be appropriate if economic growth and inflation proceed as expected. Although currency market volatility is not the primary goal of monetary policy, the Bank of Japan must consider how yen depreciation affects prices and core inflation. One policymaker stated that the weak yen and rising long-term interest rates are partly due to the policy rate being significantly below inflation, and raising rates promptly could help curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. On January 28, 2026, Japanese stocks opened lower, with most financial stocks declining despite expectations of future rate hikes: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0.5%, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group dropped 1.2%, while Mizuho Financial Group rose 0.7%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:41 AM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260128701022-430701)\n\n**BOJ Officials Signal More Caution on Yen Risk to Inflation**\nBank of Japan (BOJ) policy board members have expressed growing caution about the inflationary risks posed by the yen's depreciation, according to meeting minutes from the December 18\u201319, 2025, session released on January 28, 2026. The yen weakened to nearly 160 per dollar\u2014its weakest level since July 2024\u2014prompting concerns over potential government intervention, possibly coordinated with the U.S., though such action has eased downward pressure. While the final decision on intervention rests with Japan\u2019s finance ministry, the BOJ emphasized close monitoring of the currency. Some board members noted that as firms increasingly raise wages and prices, a weaker yen could fuel inflation through higher import costs and shift inflation expectations. This concern comes amid the BOJ\u2019s December 2025 decision to raise its policy rate to a three-decade high of 0.75%, reflecting increased confidence in wage growth. However, the yen\u2019s continued decline since then complicates inflation assessments, as cost-push inflation and reduced household purchasing power conflict with the central bank\u2019s demand-led growth targets. The minutes also highlighted concerns about rising long-term interest rates, particularly the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield, which reached a 27-year high of 2.38%. Market attention has intensified due to sharp JGB volatility, driven by fears over fiscal policy, including Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s plan to suspend the sales tax on food and beverages\u2014a move she insists will not be deficit-financed. If her Liberal Democratic Party wins the upcoming lower house election, it could gain stronger momentum to implement aggressive economic policies. One BOJ member argued that the current policy rate may be too low relative to inflation, stating that timely rate hikes could curb future inflation and stabilize long-term yields. Markets are now reassessing the timing of the next BOJ rate hike, following a hold in the bank\u2019s first 2026 decision after the December increase.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:02 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/boj-officials-signal-more-caution-on-yen-risk-to-inflation-ce7e5bd9d98cf025)\n\n**BoJ Meeting Minutes: Officials Discuss Conditions for Further Interest Rate Increases**\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) stated in its meeting minutes from December 18\u201319, 2025, that it will continue raising interest rates if economic forecasts materialize. The minutes, released on January 28, 2026, revealed that most BoJ members agreed the central bank should not predefine the pace of rate hikes and should instead assess economic conditions, inflation, and market developments at each meeting. Officials also shared the view that monetary conditions would remain accommodative despite the December rate increase. One member cautioned that delaying another rate hike could be risky due to the impact of exchange rates on inflation.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:58 AM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/estadao-conteudo/2026/01/27/bojata-em-reuniao-de-dezembro-membros-discutem-condicoes-para-novos-aumentos-de-juros.htm)\n\n**Qiang Jing: Yen\u2019s Short-Term Weakness Likely to Persist Despite Intervention Risks**\nFollowing the Bank of Japan's interest rate decision, the Japanese yen experienced two sharp rallies, with USD/JPY dropping from a high of 159.20 to around 154. Market speculation about a potential joint foreign exchange intervention by Japan's Ministry of Finance and the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2014seen as a precursor to coordinated action\u2014has heightened. The author, Qiang Jing, a Hong Kong economist at OCBC, noted that while intervention risks may limit further yen depreciation, fundamental macroeconomic factors continue to weigh on the currency, making a short-term reversal of the yen's weakness unlikely. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dchi announced the dissolution of the Diet and a snap general election on February 8, 2026, to pave the way for larger fiscal stimulus, raising concerns over worsening government finances\u2014particularly her proposal to exempt food consumption tax for two years. The Bank of Japan maintained its policy rate at 0.75% with an 8-1 vote, in line with market expectations. While the statement showed slightly hawkish signals, Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments were interpreted as mildly dovish. Post-meeting, market expectations for a rate hike in April rose from 66% to over 70%, with terminal rate forecasts also increasing. Qiang Jing's research team believes the BOJ has the conditions to raise rates by 25 basis points in March, driven by strong wage demands in spring labor negotiations\u2014averaging over 5%\u2014which may prompt action before final outcomes are confirmed. A rate hike would bring the policy rate to 1%, reaching the lower end of the neutral rate range (1%\u20132.5%), though real interest rates would remain deeply negative. In the short term, if a U.S.-Japan joint intervention occurs, it could trigger yen short-covering, pushing USD/JPY below 150, but sustained yen strength would require a clear shift toward a hawkish BOJ stance and concrete evidence that rising long-term Japanese government bond yields are driving capital repatriation. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 09:20 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F/article/20260128/s00004/1769529882276/%E5%A7%9C%E9%9D%9C-%E6%97%A5%E5%9C%93%E7%9F%AD%E6%9C%9F%E9%9B%A3%E6%89%AD%E8%BD%89%E5%BC%B1%E5%8B%A2)\n\n**Yen Rises to 152-Dollar Level Amid Japan-U.S. Coordination Signals After G7 Meeting**\nOn January 27, 2026, the Japanese yen briefly strengthened to a level of 152 yen per dollar in the foreign exchange market\u2014the first time since November 7, 2025, over three months earlier. This rise followed remarks by Finance Minister Satsuki Kataoka during a press briefing after the G7 Finance Ministers' Meeting, in which she stated that Japan would 'closely coordinate with U.S. authorities as necessary' and take appropriate action. The statement rekindled market expectations of coordinated intervention between Japanese and U.S. monetary authorities, driving yen demand. This follows a previous peak of 159 yen per dollar during a press conference by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on January 23, 2026, marking a rise of over 6 yen in just three trading days. Market sentiment shifted after speculation that the U.S. authorities had conducted rate checks following Ueda\u2019s comments, with analysts interpreting this as evidence of joint efforts to prevent excessive yen depreciation, thereby triggering a sharp yen appreciation. On January 26, 2026, Finance Ministry official Jun Miyamura declined to comment on rate checks, stating, 'I have no intention of responding.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:41 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB269UF0W6A120C2000000/)\n\n**BOJ\u2019s Strategic CPI Presentation: Balancing Inflation Signals Amid Yen Volatility**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its current monetary policy at the January 22\u201323, 2024, policy meeting, consistent with market expectations. Despite having recently raised rates to 0.75%\u2014breaking the 0.5% barrier for the first time in 30 years\u2014no immediate policy change occurred, influenced by political neutrality concerns following Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dji's announcement of a House of Representatives dissolution. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda refrained from making market-moving statements during his press conference. Initially, media reports (e.g., Bloomberg, Kyodo News) anticipated a downward revision to the 2026 fiscal year CPI core (excluding fresh food) forecast due to government anti-inflation measures like the end of temporary gasoline tax and utility cost relief. However, later reports (e.g., Reuters, Nikkei, Bloomberg) shifted to a hawkish tone, suggesting upward revisions to both GDP and CPI core forecasts, citing yen depreciation and wage-price pass-through pressures. Ultimately, the BOJ's January 23 outlook report revised the 2026 fiscal year CPI core forecast upward to +1.9% from +1.8%, and the underlying 'core inflation rate' was also upwardly revised for 2025, 2026, and 2027. The article argues this 'presentation' of data\u2014emphasizing the gradual rise in core inflation despite near-term CPI dips\u2014was strategically designed to signal potential future rate hikes without triggering premature market expectations. The author concludes that the BOJ\u2019s future rate hike timing will largely depend on foreign exchange market movements, with further yen depreciation increasing the likelihood of a rate hike, while yen appreciation could delay or reduce the need for additional tightening.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:28 AM\nSource:[JP](https://jp.reuters.com/opinion/forex-forum/O6MRUFIGSJLFDPNLPYLHVTD6MA-2026-01-27/)\n\n**Ueda of BOJ Promises Continued Interest Rate Hikes Amid Rising Wages and Inflation**\nKazuo Ueda, Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), stated on Monday that the central bank will continue raising interest rates if wages, economic growth, and inflation continue to evolve in line with its projections. Speaking at a banking conference, Ueda emphasized that the Japanese economy remains resilient and that wages and prices are likely to 'moderately rise together.' This aligns with his remarks following the BOJ\u2019s December meeting, when the central bank raised rates by 25 basis points to a 30-year high\u2014the third rate hike since the BOJ began its unprecedented monetary tightening cycle in 2024. Ueda noted that monetary conditions remain favorable and that further rate increases are probable if inflation and economic trends align with BOJ forecasts. The BOJ is scheduled to meet on January 22\u201323, 2026, during which it will also update its economic projections. Despite Ueda\u2019s comments, the Japanese yen continued to weaken, pressured by growing concerns over Japan\u2019s fiscal health. The yen\u2019s depreciation fuels higher inflation and may compel the BOJ to raise rates further. Market attention is also focused on whether Tokyo will intervene in foreign exchange markets to support the yen.

While the yen fell 1.4% against the dollar post-meeting, analysts and insiders suggest the BOJ's cautious language is strategic, preserving flexibility while demonstrating resolve to continue tightening. Former BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai projects three additional rate hikes to 1.5%, including one in June or July 2026, citing embedded inflation. JP Morgan and other sources also anticipate a possible hike as early as April 2026, contingent on upcoming data. The BOJ revised its outlook upward on global growth and dismissed U.S. tariff concerns, reaffirming its commitment to raising rates. Ueda emphasized that real interest rates remain 'very low' and that financial conditions have not tightened significantly, underscoring economic resilience. A key driver of future hikes is the weakening yen, which threatens to fuel inflation via higher import costs. Two BOJ board members dissented, arguing that underlying inflation has already reached or is near the 2% target. Labor shortages and government spending could further pressure inflation. The next policy meeting on January 22\u201323, 2026, will deliver updated growth and price forecasts, which may confirm whether the BOJ is behind the curve.

The BOJ revised its outlook upward on global growth and declared the era of U.S. tariff risks over, reinforcing its commitment to raising rates. Ueda noted the policy rate still has 'some more distance' to reach the lower bound of its neutral range (1.0%\u20132.5%), indicating room for further increases. Additional hawkish signals include concerns over inflationary pressure from a weak yen, which Ueda said could be pushing up import costs and affecting underlying inflation. Two board members dissented, arguing underlying inflation has already reached or will soon reach the 2% target. Labor shortages and government spending are expected to further fuel inflation. The next policy meeting on January 22\u201323, 2026, will provide early signals, with upgraded inflation forecasts potentially accelerating the pace of tightening. The yen fell 1.4% against the dollar post-meeting, prompting Finance Minister warnings of possible market intervention.

This move reflects Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s effort to normalize monetary policy after years of near-zero rates and unconventional easing. The hike, widely expected by analysts and 90% of economists surveyed by Reuters, signals the BOJ\u2019s confidence that sustained wage growth will keep inflation durably near its 2% target. While the new rate remains low by global standards, it moves closer to the BOJ\u2019s estimated neutral range of 1% to 2.5%. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect further rate hikes, possibly in July\u2013September 2026, contingent on economic recovery from a recent soft patch. Despite not releasing updated neutral rate estimates, Ueda is expected to emphasize the bank\u2019s readiness for additional hikes while remaining non-committal on pace and magnitude. The decision follows the BOJ\u2019s end of a decade-long stimulus program and two prior rate increases. Rising business confidence, strong wage growth, persistent inflation above target due to high food costs, and a weakening yen\u2014driving up import prices\u2014have bolstered support for the hike. Government officials, including Toshihiro Nagahama, acknowledge that exchange rate dynamics significantly influence BOJ policy, with the administration reportedly accepting the rate increase to prevent the weak yen from undermining fiscal stimulus effectiveness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-japan-set-to-raise-interest-rates-to-30year-high-4416249)\n\n**Bank of Japan Poised to Raise Rates to 30-Year High Amid Normalization Push**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to raise its short-term policy rate to 0.75% from 0.5% in its two-day meeting ending Friday, December 18, 2025\u2014the first increase since January 2024. This would mark the highest level since 1995, when Japan was recovering from a burst asset bubble and entering a prolonged deflationary period. The move is a key step in Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s effort to normalize monetary policy after decades of ultra-loose measures and near-zero interest rates. Market participants are closely watching Ueda\u2019s post-meeting press conference for signals on the pace and scale of future hikes, which could influence global financial conditions by affecting the yen\u2019s attractiveness as a funding currency. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect the BOJ to maintain loose financial conditions despite the hike, with further normalization likely in July\u2013September 2026 if the economy continues recovering from its current slowdown. A Reuters survey found that 90% of economists expect the BOJ to raise rates to 0.75% by December 2025, with over two-thirds forecasting rates reaching at least 1.0% by September 2026. The current 0.75% rate would bring borrowing costs close to the BOJ\u2019s estimated neutral range of 1% to 2.5%, though the central bank will not release updated estimates of this neutral level. Instead, Ueda is expected to emphasize the bank\u2019s willingness to continue raising rates without committing to a specific pace. The BOJ ended its decade-long stimulus program in 2024 and raised rates twice, most recently to 0.5%. Recent data show a four-year high in business sentiment and continued plans for strong wage increases, indicating economic resilience despite ongoing U.S. tariffs. Persistent inflation\u2014driven by elevated food prices\u2014has kept inflation above the 2% target for nearly four years, prompting more BOJ policymakers to support rate hikes to avoid lagging behind inflation risks. Recent yen depreciation has also helped convince Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who had been hesitant, that further rate increases are necessary, as a weak yen could undermine the effectiveness of the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus. Toshihiro Nagahama, a government advisor and known reflationist, stated on December 17, 2025, that exchange rates significantly influence BOJ decisions.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/bank-of-japan-steht-vor-zinserhoehung-auf-30-jahres-hoch-ce7d50dcd088f027)\n\n**Here's what to watch out for in the Bank of Japan's latest interest rate decision By Investing.com**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to unanimously raise its policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75% during its December 18\u201319 meeting, marking the first time in approximately three decades that borrowing costs reach this level. Analysts at BofA Securities, including Takayasu Kudo and Shusuke Yamada, note that a 90% market probability for a hike makes the move anticipated, with BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda having pre-announced the possibility earlier in December by stating the central bank would weigh the 'pros and cons' of a rate increase. Ueda signaled that conditions for a hike may now be in place, citing fading impacts from U.S. tariffs and confidence in Japan\u2019s economic rebound from a third-quarter contraction. Labor unions, particularly Rengo\u2014the largest union group representing 7 million members\u2014have called for wage increases of 5% or more in 2026, continuing a trend that contributed to the largest wage rise in over 30 years in 2025. BofA analysts believe the BOJ will likely cite anecdotal evidence of aggressive corporate wage-setting as a factor supporting sustained price stability. The policy statement is expected to retain the current baseline economic outlook, including the forecast that tariffs will slow global growth, but will acknowledge that downside risks and uncertainties have diminished. Inflation forecasts\u2014projecting a drop below 2% annually before rebounding in the second half of 2026\u2014are expected to remain unchanged. A key focus will be the BOJ\u2019s assessment of the 'neutral' interest rate, currently estimated between 1% and 2.5%; analysts predict the central bank may raise its lower bound estimate, which would clarify future rate hike intentions starting in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 14, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/heres-what-to-watch-out-for-in-the-bank-of-japans-latest-interest-rate-decision-4406273)\n\n**Bank of Japan Poised for Rate Hike Amid Rising Economic Confidence | Business**\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) is considering raising interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy amid rising economic confidence.
