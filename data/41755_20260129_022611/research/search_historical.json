Policy\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Recent Economic Data:**\n- Tokyo headline inflation eased to 2.0% year-on-year in December (down from 2.7% in November, below market consensus of 2.3%)\n- Core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy) slowed to 2.6% in December (from 2.8% in November)\n- Industrial production declined 2.6% month-on-month in November (worse than market consensus of -2.0%)\n- Auto production fell 7.2% in November (first decline in four months)\n- Retail sales rose 0.6% month-on-month in December (third consecutive month of growth)\n- Auto sales down 2.6% in December (following 9.6% gain in October)\n- USD/JPY ended 2025 at 156.63\n\n**GDP Forecasts:**\n- Expected Q4 rebound of 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, annualized (after 2.3% contraction in Q3)\n\n## Analyst Opinions and Forecasts (ING - Named Source):\n\n**Rate Hike Timing:**\n- **Most likely timing for next rate hike: October 2026** (second half of 2026)\n- Could potentially move forward to Q2 2026 if fiscal health concerns arise and JPY weakens further\n- Expected 25 basis point hike in October\n- Policy rate may reach as high as 1.50% by end of 2027\n\n**Rationale for Delayed Timing:**\n- Headline inflation expected to drop below 2% in coming months\n- Core inflation expected to decelerate toward 2% due to base effects\n- BoJ likely to assess impact of previous rate hikes before proceeding\n- BoJ will wait to confirm core inflation remains above 2% and outpaces headline inflation\n\n**Supporting Factors for Future Tightening:**\n- Major labor unions planning wage growth over 5%\n- Strong corporate earnings expected to support solid wage growth\n- Government shopping voucher and cash payout programs expected to stimulate consumption\n- Core inflation expected to remain above 2% due to strong wage growth and government aid\n\n**Currency Expectations:**\n- USD/JPY expected to appreciate modestly in first half of 2026 as US-Japan interest rate differentials narrow\n- Gradual Federal Reserve rate cuts in first half of 2026 may strengthen JPY toward 150\n- JPY expected to remain range-bound in near term\n\n## Information from BoJ Meeting Minutes (December):\n\n- Some board members noted real interest rate remains very low\n- Central bank needs to adjust degree of monetary accommodation\n- One member argued BoJ should adjust policy with intervals of a few months\n- Overall board stance shifted toward more hawkish position, but pace will remain slow\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Inflation decline driven by renewed energy subsidies, stable rice prices, and low petroleum costs\n- Government increasing winter energy subsidies\n- Manufacturing decline in November viewed as likely temporary\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

what's next for the JPY (further appreciation)?\"\n\n**Source:** Marketpulse  \n**Author:** Kelvin Wong, Senior Market Analyst\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Market Expectations:** Markets assign a ~94% probability to a 25 basis point BoJ rate hike to 0.75% (as of the article's publication date)\n\n2. **Timing:** The expected hike would occur on Friday, December 19, which would bring the overnight policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years\n\n3. **Previous Rate Action:** This would be the second hike in the year, following an 11-month pause since January's hike\n\n4. **Historical Context:** If executed, this would mark the first instance since the BoJ adopted its two-day meeting format in 1998 that it and the Federal Reserve move policy rates in opposite directions within the same month\n\n5. **Economic Indicators:**\n   - Q4 Tankan business sentiment survey for large manufacturing companies rose to almost a 3-year high at 15.0\n   - Consumer sentiment rose to a 19-month high of 37.50 in November 2025 (improved since April 2025)\n   - 1-year overnight-indexed swap rate increased to 0.84% as of December 16, 2025\n\n6. **Technical Analysis on USD/JPY:**\n   - USD/JPY reached a 10-month high of 157.90 on November 20, 2025\n   - Key short-term pivotal resistance at 156.10\n   - Near-term support at 154.40\n   - Additional support levels at 153.70 and 152.95\n   - Resistance levels at 156.60 and 157.00/157.15\n\n## Key Opinions:\n\n**From the analyst (Kelvin Wong):**\n- The BoJ is likely to continue its gradual interest rate hike cycle into 2026\n- Policy divergence favors JPY structurally, as the BoJ is the only major central bank tightening while the Fed eases\n- USD/JPY near-term bias is bearish, with technicals signaling fading upside momentum\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2026/01/16/economy/boj-rate-hike-july/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** The Japan Times

meeting:** January 22-23, 2026\n- **Unanimous prediction:** All 52 respondents expect the BOJ to keep rates unchanged at 0.75% at the January meeting\n- **Inflation context:** Japan has seen inflation averaging above the 2% target for the past four calendar years\n\n## Timing Expectations for Next Rate Hike:\n\n- **July 2026:** 48% of economists (most popular choice by wide margin)\n- **April 2026:** 17% of economists\n- **June 2026:** 17% of economists\n\n## Key Opinions:\n\n- **General consensus:** Most BOJ watchers believe Governor Kazuo Ueda and colleagues have been slow in raising interest rates\n- **Base case scenario:** The next rate hike is expected to be several months away\n- **X-factor identified:** The exchange rate (yen weakness) could force the BOJ to act faster than the base case scenarios suggest\n- **Rationale for yen as X-factor:** A weaker yen would add to existing price pressures in an economy already experiencing above-target inflation\n\n---\n\n*Note: The

should the wage-price cycle strengthen\u201d (Reuters excerpts via CNBC, 19 Dec 2025).\n\n(*News agencies date the decision 24 Jan because of time-zone conventions.)\n\nNo policy-rate action occurred during calendar 2023. The 22\u201323 Jan 2026 meeting left the rate unchanged at 0.75 % (8\u20131 vote) and therefore is outside the list of \u201cchanges,\u201d but its forward-looking remarks inform the consensus discussion (CNBC, 23 Jan 2026).\n\nEconomists\u2019 consensus on further moves as of end-January 2026  \n\n\u2022 Bloomberg survey of 52 economists (16 Jan 2026) \u2013 median expectation: one more 25 bp hike by July 2026; inter-quartile window April\u2013October 2026 (Japan Times, 16 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 State Street Global Markets (comment 23 Jan 2026) \u2013 base case: one hike in 2026 and one in 2027 to a 1.25 % terminal rate; if USD/JPY breaches \u00a5160 two hikes in 2026 are pencilled in (CNBC, 23 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 ING Think-ING note (Jan 2026) \u2013 projects a single 25 bp increase in 2H 2026; terminal 1.50 % by end-2027.  \n\u2022 Oxford Economics flash comment (24 Jan 2026) \u2013 baseline still one hike to 1 % in mid-2026, with \u201cone or two more\u201d under review given yen weakness and looser fiscal policy.  \n\nSynthesis: After four rate increases totalling roughly 85 bp since March 2024, the consensus remains that normalization will proceed at a glacial pace. Almost all forecasters cluster around one additional 25 bp move\u2014lifting the policy rate to 1.0 %\u2014sometime in mid-2026. Upside risk stems from a weaker yen or stronger wage settlements; downside risk from political pressure for easier policy ahead of the February 2026 snap election.\n\nInformation gaps that remain  \n\n\u2022 Precise vote tallies for the 19 Mar 2024 and 31 Jul 2024 decisions.  \n\u2022 Verbatim forward-guidance paragraphs for those two statements (only headline summaries are captured in open-source media).  \n\nBoth items should reside in the BOJ primary PDFs already identified:  \n\u2013 \u201cMonetary Policy Decisions (19 Mar 2024)\u201d  \n\u2013 \u201cDecisions at the July 2024 Monetary Policy Meeting\u201d  \n\nExtracting the tables labelled \u201cVotes\u201d and the sections headed \u201cOutlook and forward guidance\u201d from these documents would complete the record and provide primary-source verification for every entry.</Agent_report>\n"
