**(a) Source Analysis:**

**RBC-Ukraine (January 2026):**
This article describes a January 2026 UN Security Council meeting where US representative Dorothy Shea accused China of facilitating Russian aggression. However, the accusations focus on "dual-use goods" and "components" found in Russian weapons, not explicitly "lethal military aid." China's representative specifically denied supplying "lethal weapons." This is a factual report of statements made, but the distinction between dual-use goods and lethal military aid is critical for resolution.

**POLITICO (September 2024):**
Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell made explicit statements that China is providing materials "being applied directly to the Russian war machine" and that these are "not dual-use capabilities." This represents a significant escalation in rhetoric. Campbell is a senior, identifiable official making factual claims about Chinese support. This is highly relevant as it suggests the US was moving toward public accusations of lethal aid by September 2024.

**USCC Report (July 2025, covering through November 2025):**
This comprehensive timeline shows:
- China repeatedly denied providing lethal weapons (November 2025)
- G7 foreign ministers condemned China's provision of "weapons and dual-use components" (November 2025)
- EU officials accused China of "fueling Russia's war" (November 2025)
- Reports of Chinese-made rocket systems destroyed in Ukraine (November 2025)

Notably, while international actors made accusations, the timeline doesn't show explicit US government statements calling it "lethal military aid" during this period.

**PBS News (February 2023):**
This describes US warnings that China was "considering" providing lethal support - a prospective warning, not an accusation of actual supply. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield called it a potential "red line." This is clearly a warning about future actions, not an accusation of past actions.

**NBC News (March 2023):**
Provides context that initial intelligence about China "considering" lethal aid came from Russian officials. US officials explicitly stated "We actually don't know" how serious China was and had "NOT seen evidence of actual movement." This confirms 2023 statements were warnings, not accusations of actual supply.

**VOA News (April 2024):**
Blinken expressed concern about "dual-use items" including microchips and machine tools. While serious, this doesn't constitute an accusation of "lethal military aid" - the language carefully distinguishes dual-use from lethal weapons.

**Agent Report (Comprehensive Timeline):**
This detailed timeline is extremely valuable and distinguishes between:
- **Warnings about potential future aid** (March 2022 - April 2024)
- **Assertions of dual-use supply** (February 2024 onward)
- **Assertions of lethal aid** (September 2024 onward)

Key findings:
1. **September 10, 2024**: Kurt Campbell first asserted China was providing items "applied directly to the Russian war machine" - "not dual-use capabilities"
2. **October 18, 2024**: Treasury sanctioned Chinese drone manufacturers for producing Garpiya UAVs delivered to Russia
3. **December 23, 2025**: Treasury explicitly stated drones were "designed, developed and produced at PRC-based factories... before transferring the drones to Russia"

The agent report identifies that explicit US accusations of lethal weapons supply began in **September 2024** with Campbell's statements and were formalized through Treasury sanctions in **October 2024** and **December 2025**.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: US public accusations of major powers violating international norms**
- The US has historically been willing to publicly accuse adversaries (Iran, North Korea, Russia) of weapons transfers
- However, with China, the economic interdependence creates hesitancy
- The gradual escalation from warnings (2022-2023) to dual-use accusations (2024) to lethal aid accusations (late 2024) suggests a pattern of increasing willingness

**Reference Class 2: Evolution of US rhetoric on China-Russia military cooperation**
- The timeline shows a clear progression: warnings → dual-use concerns → lethal aid accusations
- This progression took approximately 2.5 years (March 2022 to September 2024)
- Once the threshold was crossed in September 2024, subsequent statements and sanctions reinforced the accusation

**Reference Class 3: US government statements about Chinese military support already made**
- Campbell's September 2024 statements
- October 2024 Treasury sanctions on drone manufacturers
- December 2025 Treasury sanctions explicitly detailing weapons production and transfer
- January 2026 UN statements (though focused on dual-use language)

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Reference Class 3 is most relevant because the question asks about whether the US *will* make such an accusation before May 1, 2026, and the evidence strongly suggests **the US has already made such accusations** starting in September 2024 and continuing through December 2025.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** From today (January 29, 2026) to May 1, 2026 = **92 days** (approximately 3 months)

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- September 10, 2024: Campbell's explicit statement about non-dual-use military aid
- October 18, 2024: Treasury sanctions on Chinese drone manufacturers (lethal weapons)
- December 23, 2025: Treasury press releases (JY2651 and JY2785) explicitly stating Chinese factories produced and transferred drones to Russia, and describing "advanced weapons, components, and ammunition"
- January 2026: UN statements (though these reverted to dual-use language)

The pattern shows that explicit accusations of lethal military aid have been made multiple times since September 2024, with the most explicit and formal accusations coming in the December 23, 2025 Treasury sanctions.

**(d) Justification:**

The critical question is whether the US has **already** publicly accused China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia. Based on the evidence:

**Strong evidence that accusations have already been made:**
1. Kurt Campbell (Deputy Secretary of State) explicitly stated in September 2024 that China was providing materials "not dual-use capabilities" but items "applied directly to the Russian war machine"
2. Treasury Department sanctioned Chinese companies in October 2024 for producing Garpiya attack UAVs delivered to Russia
3. Treasury press releases on December 23, 2025 (JY2651 and JY2785) explicitly stated:
   - Drones were "designed, developed and produced at PRC-based factories... before transferring the drones to Russia for use against Ukraine"
   - Chinese entities were supplying "advanced weapons, components, and ammunition"

**The language "lethal military aid":**
The question asks about "lethal military aid" specifically. The evidence shows:
- Attack drones (Garpiya UAVs) are unambiguously lethal military weapons
- Treasury explicitly described "advanced weapons" and "ammunition"
- Campbell stated these were not dual-use but directly applied to Russia's war machine

**Potential ambiguity:**
- Some recent statements (January 2026 UN) reverted to "dual-use" language
- China continues to deny providing lethal weapons
- The exact phrase "lethal military aid" may not have been used verbatim

However, describing the production and transfer of attack drones designed for use against Ukraine, and sanctioning companies for providing "advanced weapons" and "ammunition," constitutes a public accusation of supplying lethal military aid in substance, even if the exact phrase wasn't always used.

**Given that we are already past the point where such accusations were made (September 2024 - December 2025), the question becomes whether these past statements satisfy the resolution criteria, or whether a new, additional accusation before May 1, 2026 is required.**

If past accusations count: The probability is essentially 100% because it has already happened.

If only new accusations from January 29, 2026 forward count: Given the pattern of escalating rhetoric, Treasury sanctions in December 2025, and only 92 days remaining, the probability of at least one additional public statement is still very high (70-85%). The US has established a pattern of making such accusations and has institutional mechanisms (Treasury sanctions, State Department statements) that could easily produce additional public accusations in the next 3 months.

Outside view calibration:

The key calibration question is: **Has the US already publicly accused China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia?**

Based on the evidence:
- Treasury Department press release JY2651 (December 23, 2025) explicitly states Chinese-produced drones were "transferred to Russia for use against Ukraine"
- Treasury press release JY2785 (December 23, 2025) describes Chinese entities supplying "advanced weapons, components, and ammunition"
- Kurt Campbell (September 2024) stated China was providing non-dual-use items "applied directly to the Russian war machine"

These statements, particularly the Treasury sanctions documentation, constitute public accusations that China supplied lethal military aid. Attack drones are lethal weapons, and Treasury explicitly documented their production in China and transfer to Russia.

**Tethering to source data:**
The agent report conclusively identifies that "public U.S. government communications that accuse China of lethal-weapons deliveries to Russia first appear in September 2024 and are corroborated by Treasury sanctions in October 2024 and December 2025."

**Calibration consideration:**
If the resolution criteria require only that such an accusation be made publicly by the US government before May 1, 2026 (not specifically after today's date), then the accusation has already occurred with very high confidence (95-99%).

If the criteria require a new accusation from January 29, 2026 forward, the probability is lower but still substantial (70-85%) given:
- Only 92 days remain
- The US has established a pattern of such accusations
- Treasury and State Department have active programs monitoring this issue
- Recent January 2026 UN statements show continued US focus on the issue

However, the most natural reading of "Before May 1, 2026, will the United States publicly accuse..." is whether such an accusation will have been made by that date, not whether it will be made between now and that date.

Given the explicit Treasury documentation from December 23, 2025 describing Chinese production and transfer of weapons to Russia, I assess with high confidence that the US has already made such accusations.
