Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

**Historical Context Sources (Pre-2026):**

1. **RFE/RL (May 2024)**: British Defense Secretary Shapps claimed China was sending lethal aid, but U.S. National Security Adviser Sullivan directly contradicted this hours later, stating "We have not seen that to date." This establishes that as of May 2024, the U.S. explicitly denied China was providing lethal aid. High-quality source, clear contradiction of British claims.

2. **Business Insider (September 2024)**: Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell stated China is providing "very substantial" support that is "not dual-use capabilities" but "component pieces" for Russia's war machine. The article explicitly states this was "the first time a US official has said China is directly providing lethal aid to Russia." This is a **critical data point** - a named, senior U.S. official making an explicit accusation in September 2024.

3. **BBC (February 2023)**: Secretary Blinken said the U.S. has information China is "considering supplying" lethal support - this is prospective warning, not accusation of actual supply.

4. **CFR (July 2025)**: Ukrainian intelligence accused China of supplying materials to Russian factories, but these were **Ukrainian** accusations, not U.S. accusations. China denied providing lethal weapons.

5. **BBC (September 2025)**: Trump accused Xi of "conspiring" with Putin and Kim, but this is vague political rhetoric. The article notes China has been "accused by the West" of aiding Russia through dual-use materials, but doesn't cite specific U.S. accusations of lethal aid.

**Current Information Sources (January 2026):**

6. **Telegraph Investigation (January 28, 2026)**: Multiple sources cite Telegraph reporting that China supplied $10.3 billion in equipment including CNC machines for producing Oreshnik missiles, microchips ($4.9B), ball bearings, piezoelectric crystals, and optical sights. These are identified as items on the restricted export list. However, these articles are **media investigations and Ukrainian intelligence claims**, not direct U.S. government accusations. The articles do not quote any U.S. officials making accusations.

7. **Budanov Statement (January 21, 2026)**: Former Ukrainian intelligence chief stated at Davos that "China has not supplied any weapons to Russia since the start of the war" but has supplied critical technologies. This directly contradicts the notion of lethal weapons supply.

8. **Kyiv Independent Investigation (December 2025)**: Reports China secretly purchased Russian weapons since 2023 for its own use (Taiwan preparation), not that China supplied Russia. This is reverse direction.

9. **G7 Statement (November 2025)**: G7 foreign ministers accused China of supplying "weapons and dual-use goods" to Russia. China's spokesperson Lin Jian denied this, stating China "never provided lethal weapons to any party." The question is whether the U.S. specifically made this accusation as part of G7, or if this was a collective statement.

**Critical Gap**: The January 2026 articles about Telegraph's investigation do **not** cite any U.S. government officials making accusations. They cite Ukrainian intelligence, Telegraph journalists, and analysts, but no identifiable U.S. government spokesperson or official.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Kurt Campbell statement (September 2024)**: Deputy Secretary of State explicitly said China is providing support that is "not dual-use capabilities" but components for Russia's war machine. Business Insider characterized this as "the first time a US official has said China is directly providing lethal aid." This is a named, senior U.S. official making a clear accusation. However, the exact phrase "lethal military aid" may not have been used.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **G7 Statement (November 2025)**: Accused China of supplying "weapons and dual-use goods." If the U.S. was part of this statement, it represents a public accusation. However, collective statements are less clear than unilateral U.S. statements.
- **Pattern of escalation**: Clear progression from warnings (2023) to dual-use accusations (2024) to stronger language (late 2024-2025).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Telegraph investigation (January 2026)**: While detailed, this is media reporting and Ukrainian intelligence, not U.S. government accusations.
- **Trump rhetoric (September 2025)**: Vague political statements about "conspiring" don't constitute specific accusations of lethal military aid.
- **Treasury sanctions**: The outside view analysis mentions Treasury sanctions in October 2024 and December 2025, but these are not cited in the current information sources I have access to. I cannot verify these claims.

**Counter-Evidence:**
- **Sullivan contradiction (May 2024)**: U.S. explicitly denied China was providing lethal aid as of May 2024.
- **Budanov statement (January 2026)**: Ukrainian intelligence chief stated China has not supplied weapons to Russia.
- **China's consistent denials**: Every time accused, China denies providing lethal weapons.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: January 29, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **92 days** (approximately 3 months)

**Key question**: Has the U.S. already made such an accusation, or is the question asking about future accusations?

The resolution criteria states "Before May 1, 2026, will the United States publicly accuse..." This phrasing suggests we're asking whether such an accusation will have been made by that date, including past accusations.

**If timeframe were halved (46 days)**: Would slightly reduce probability of a new accusation being made, but wouldn't change assessment of whether past accusations count.

**If timeframe were doubled (184 days)**: Would increase probability of a new accusation, but primary question remains whether past statements qualify.

## (d) Justification:

**Critical interpretation question**: Does Kurt Campbell's September 2024 statement constitute a public U.S. accusation that China is supplying lethal military aid to Russia?

**Arguments it does qualify:**
1. Campbell is Deputy Secretary of State (senior official)
2. He explicitly stated the support is "not dual-use capabilities"
3. Business Insider characterized it as "the first time a US official has said China is directly providing lethal aid"
4. This was a public statement to reporters

**Arguments it doesn't qualify:**
1. The exact phrase "lethal military aid" may not have been used
2. Campbell said "component pieces" which could be interpreted as not complete weapons systems
3. China has consistently denied providing lethal weapons
4. Sullivan explicitly contradicted similar claims in May 2024
5. Budanov (January 2026) stated China has not supplied weapons

**Resolution criteria ambiguity**: The question asks about "lethal military aid" which could mean:
- Complete weapons systems (guns, missiles, drones)
- Components specifically for lethal weapons
- Any support that enables lethal operations

The Campbell statement appears to fall in the middle category - components for weapons, but described as "not dual-use" (implying specifically for military/lethal use).

**Base rate adjustment**: The outside view predicted 94% based on the assumption that Campbell's statement and Treasury sanctions constituted such accusations. However, reviewing the primary sources:
- Campbell's statement is ambiguous about whether it constitutes "lethal military aid"
- I cannot verify the Treasury sanctions claims in my current information
- The most recent statement from Ukrainian intelligence (Budanov, January 2026) contradicts the notion China supplied weapons
- The Telegraph investigation (January 2026) does not cite U.S. government accusations

**Significant uncertainty factors:**
1. Whether Campbell's statement qualifies as accusing China of "lethal military aid"
2. Whether Treasury sanctions (mentioned in outside view but not verified in my sources) exist and constitute accusations
3. Whether G7 statements count as U.S. accusations
4. Whether new accusations will emerge in the next 92 days

## Probability Calibration:

The outside view of 94% appears **overconfident** based on my source analysis. The key evidence is:

1. **Campbell's September 2024 statement**: This is the strongest evidence, but it's ambiguous whether "component pieces" for Russia's war machine that are "not dual-use" constitutes "lethal military aid" in the sense the question intends.

2. **Lack of clear, unambiguous U.S. accusations in 2025-2026**: The January 2026 sources cite media investigations and Ukrainian intelligence, but no identifiable U.S. government officials making accusations.

3. **Contradictory evidence**: Sullivan's May 2024 denial and Budanov's January 2026 statement that China hasn't supplied weapons create doubt.

**Calibration considerations:**
- 90% probability means 9:1 odds - extremely confident
- 70% probability means 7:3 odds - confident but acknowledging significant uncertainty
- 50% probability means even odds - maximum uncertainty

Given:
- Campbell's statement likely qualifies as an accusation (though ambiguous)
- 92 days remain for potential new accusations
- Pattern of escalating rhetoric
- But also significant contradictory evidence and lack of recent clear accusations

I assess the probability at **65-75%**, with the central estimate at **70%**.

This reflects:
- Moderate confidence that Campbell's statement qualifies (~60% of the probability)
- Moderate probability of new accusations in next 92 days (~10% additional)
- Significant uncertainty about interpretation and evidence gaps

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia before May 1, 2026?
2. **Base rate**: Outside view was 94%, but this appears overconfident given source analysis showing ambiguous evidence.
3. **Consistency**: "70 out of 100 times, the U.S. publicly accuses China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia before May 1, 2026." This seems reasonable given Campbell's statement and remaining time.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Campbell's September 2024 statement about non-dual-use components; (2) Pattern of escalating U.S. rhetoric 2022-2024; (3) 92 days remaining for new statements; (4) Contradictory evidence from Sullivan and Budanov; (5) Lack of clear 2025-2026 U.S. accusations in available sources.
5. **Blind spot**: Campbell's statement is more explicit than I'm interpreting, or Treasury sanctions documentation exists that clearly constitutes accusations, making my forecast too low.
6. **Status quo**: Current status appears to be ambiguous statements and media reporting without clear, recent U.S. government accusations, suggesting modest probability rather than high confidence.

Probability: 70%
