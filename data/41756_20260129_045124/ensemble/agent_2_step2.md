Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources (Pre-2026):**

1. **RFE/RL (May 23, 2024)**: British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps claimed "lethal aid is now, or will be, flowing from China to Russia," but U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan directly contradicted this hours later, stating "We have not seen that to date." This establishes the U.S. position as of May 2024 was explicit denial of lethal aid transfers. High-quality source with direct quotes from named officials.

2. **Business Insider (September 11, 2024)**: Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell stated China is providing "very substantial" support that consists of "component pieces" helping "sustain, build, and diversify various elements of the Russian war machine" and explicitly said these are "not dual-use capabilities." The article characterizes this as "the first time a US official has said China is directly providing lethal aid." However, reading Campbell's exact words carefully, he describes "component pieces" rather than finished weapons. Moderate-quality source with direct quotes.

3. **BBC (February 20, 2023)**: Secretary Blinken warned China was "considering supplying lethal support" (future tense, not accusation of current transfers). High-quality source but describes warnings, not accusations of completed transfers.

4. **CFR Article (July 7, 2025)**: Documents Ukrainian intelligence allegations from May 26, 2025, that China supplies "tooling machines, special chemical products, gunpowder, and components" to Russian defense factories. Crucially, these are **Ukrainian** accusations, not U.S. accusations. High-quality source but wrong attributing party.

5. **BBC (September 3, 2025)**: Trump accused Xi of "conspiring against the US" with Putin and Kim but made no specific lethal aid accusation. The article notes "China has been accused by the West of aiding Russia's war effort through supply of dual-use materials" without specifying U.S. as the accuser. Moderate quality but lacks specificity.

**January 2026 Sources (Critical Period):**

6. **Telegraph Investigation (January 28, 2026)**: Multiple articles cite a Telegraph report revealing China supplied $10.3 billion in equipment to Russia, including CNC machines for producing Oreshnik missiles, microchips ($4.9B), bearings ($130M), piezoelectric crystals ($97M), and optical sights ($42M). These are characterized as dual-use items and production equipment, not finished weapons. The investigation appears to be journalistic rather than based on U.S. government statements. High-quality investigative journalism but **not a U.S. government accusation**.

7. **Budanov Statement (January 21, 2026)**: Former Ukrainian intelligence chief stated at Davos that "China has not supplied any weapons to Russia since the start of the war" but has supplied critical technologies. This is a **Ukrainian** official explicitly denying weapons transfers while confirming dual-use technology. High-quality source but contradicts the resolution criteria.

8. **Kyiv Independent (December 8, 2025)**: Reports China secretly purchased Russian weapons since 2023 for its own airborne troops (reverse direction - China buying from Russia, not supplying). Not relevant to question.

9. **Multiple October 2025 Sources**: Zelenskyy accused Western nations (including China, U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea) of supplying components found in Russian weapons. These are **Ukrainian** accusations, not U.S. accusations. The sources note China has "strict export controls" and components reach Russia via third countries.

10. **G7 Statement (November 13, 2025)**: G7 foreign ministers accused China of supplying "weapons and dual-use goods" to Russia. China's Foreign Ministry denied this. However, this is a **G7 collective statement**, not specifically a U.S. public accusation, though the U.S. is part of G7.

11. **U.S. Deputy Ambassador Shea (December 2025, RBC-Ukraine)**: Said Chinese components are found in Russian drones and demanded Beijing stop exporting dual-use goods. This describes components/dual-use goods, not "lethal military aid" as finished weapons.

**Factual vs. Opinion Assessment:**
- **Facts**: Campbell's September 2024 statement about "component pieces"; Sullivan's May 2024 denial; Telegraph's documentation of specific equipment transfers; Budanov's January 2026 denial of weapons transfers
- **Opinions**: Characterizations of whether components constitute "lethal aid"; assessments of China's strategic intentions

**Critical Gap**: None of the January 2026 sources document a **U.S. government official** making a **public accusation** that China is supplying **lethal military aid** (finished weapons/ammunition) to Russia. The Telegraph investigation and subsequent media coverage focus on dual-use equipment and components, not weapons.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Against Resolution):**
- Budanov's explicit statement (January 21, 2026) that China has NOT supplied weapons to Russia, only technology/components. This is from a named, senior Ukrainian intelligence official with direct knowledge, speaking at a major international forum just 8 days before today's date.
- The Telegraph investigation (January 28, 2026 - yesterday) focuses entirely on production equipment, components, and dual-use goods, not finished weapons, and does not cite U.S. government accusations.

**Moderate Evidence (Against Resolution):**
- Historical pattern: When the U.S. makes lethal aid accusations, they are typically direct and unambiguous (e.g., Iran supplying drones to Russia, DPRK supplying artillery shells). The current discourse remains focused on "dual-use," "components," and "production equipment."
- The September 2024 Campbell statement was the closest to an accusation but still described "component pieces" rather than weapons systems.

**Weak Evidence (For Resolution):**
- The G7 November 2025 statement included "weapons" but was collective, not specifically a U.S. accusation.
- Increasing media attention to Chinese support might pressure U.S. officials to make stronger statements.

**Weak Evidence (Against Resolution):**
- Only 62 days remain until May 1, 2026 (not 93 as stated in outside view - correction needed).
- No identifiable U.S. government statement in the most recent news cycle (last 8 days) despite major Telegraph revelations.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Corrected Timeframe**: January 29, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 92 days = approximately 3.0 months or 1.0 quarter.

**Current Trajectory**: The latest major investigation (Telegraph, January 28) was covered extensively in media but did not trigger a U.S. government accusation of lethal aid. The most recent identified Ukrainian official (Budanov, January 21) explicitly denied weapons transfers.

**If Timeframe Halved (46 days, to mid-March 2026)**:
Probability would decrease to ~25-30%. Less time for new intelligence revelations or policy shifts. Status quo (dual-use rhetoric) more likely to persist.

**If Timeframe Doubled (184 days, to August 2026)**:
Probability would increase to ~55-65%. More opportunities for: (1) new intelligence becoming public, (2) escalatory events in Ukraine triggering stronger U.S. responses, (3) political pressure in U.S. election cycle, (4) cumulative evidence reaching threshold for policy shift.

## (d) Justification for Adjustment from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate**: 41% (one quarter, based on historical accusation frequency)

**Major Downward Adjustments:**

1. **Budanov's January 21 Statement (-15 pts)**: A senior intelligence official with access to classified information explicitly stated China has not supplied weapons. This is strong, recent evidence directly contradicting the resolution criteria.

2. **Telegraph Investigation Framing (-10 pts)**: The most significant recent investigation (January 28) focused entirely on production equipment and components, not weapons. If the evidence supported a lethal aid accusation, we would expect U.S. officials to have seized on this high-profile report.

3. **Historical Pattern Specificity (-5 pts)**: The U.S. has been willing to accuse Iran (drones) and DPRK (artillery) of lethal aid to Russia using clear, unambiguous language. The persistent use of "dual-use" and "components" terminology regarding China suggests deliberate policy restraint.

4. **Time Pressure (-5 pts)**: With only 92 days remaining and no accusation following major revelations yesterday, the window is narrowing.

**Minor Upward Adjustments:**

1. **G7 Precedent (+3 pts)**: The November 2025 G7 statement used "weapons" language, suggesting international pressure for stronger characterization.

2. **Escalation Risk (+2 pts)**: If Russia uses Chinese-supplied equipment in a particularly devastating attack, political pressure might force a policy shift.

**Net Adjustment**: 41% - 15% - 10% - 5% - 5% + 3% + 2% = **11%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate of 41%, the cumulative evidence suggests substantial downward revision:

- The most recent, credible intelligence assessment (Budanov, 8 days ago) explicitly denies weapons transfers
- The most recent major investigation (Telegraph, 1 day ago) focuses on production equipment, not weapons
- No U.S. government response to Telegraph revelations despite extensive media coverage
- Persistent use of "dual-use" language indicates policy restraint
- Only 92 days remaining in window

The question requires a **public U.S. accusation** of **lethal military aid**. The evidence strongly suggests:
1. Current U.S. policy distinguishes between production support (acknowledged) and weapons transfers (not accused)
2. Recent Ukrainian intelligence assessments support this distinction
3. No apparent catalyst for policy shift in remaining timeframe

**Final Calibrated Prediction: 11%**

This reflects:
- ~5% baseline chance of unexpected intelligence revelation or major escalatory event
- ~6% chance of gradual policy evolution crossing rhetorical threshold
- Recognition that 11 out of 100 similar scenarios would produce an accusation, which feels appropriately conservative given the evidence

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid (weapons/ammunition, not just components) to Russia before May 1, 2026? (92 days remaining)

2. **Base rate consistency**: Outside view was 41% per quarter for any lethal-aid accusation during major conflicts. Current circumstances show: (a) explicit recent denial by allied intelligence, (b) persistent dual-use framing, (c) no U.S. response to major revelations, warranting substantial downward revision to 11%.

3. **Consistency check**: "11 out of 100 times, the U.S. publicly accuses China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia by May 1, 2026." Given Budanov's explicit denial 8 days ago and persistent dual-use framing, this feels appropriately low but not dismissive of tail risks.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Budanov (Jan 21): "China has not supplied any weapons to Russia" - contradicts resolution
   - Telegraph (Jan 28): $10.3B in production equipment/components, not weapons - supports dual-use framing
   - No U.S. government statement following Telegraph revelations - suggests policy restraint
   - Historical pattern: U.S. uses clear "lethal aid" language for Iran/DPRK but not China - indicates deliberate distinction
   - 92 days remaining with no apparent catalyst for policy shift

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major Russian attack using identifiably Chinese-origin weapons (not components) with significant civilian casualties, forcing U.S. political response. Or declassification of intelligence showing direct weapons shipments. Would increase probability to 35-40%.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is dual-use/components rhetoric without lethal aid accusation. This has persisted for 16+ months despite escalating Chinese support. Strong inertia suggests continuation. Slight additional nudge toward status quo already incorporated in low probability.

Probability: 11%
