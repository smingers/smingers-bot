Analysis:
We are forecasting whether, before May 1, 2026 (approximately 92 days from today, January 29, 2026), the US will publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia. In our work we split the analysis as follows:

(a) Source Analysis – We reviewed several current and historical reports:
 • The May 2024 RFE/RL report shows a British claim and immediate US pushback—but it mostly discussed dual‐use inputs, not “lethal” aid.
 • A September 2024 Business Insider piece quoted Deputy Secretary Campbell saying China was supplying “very substantial” support that goes beyond typical dual-use trade. That stronger language—though not using the phrase “lethal military aid” explicitly—marked the first time a senior US official framed China’s supply in clearly military terms.
 • Earlier undated statements (e.g., from February 2023 and NBC in March 2023) warned about future “lethal” support, but they stopped short of an actual public accusation.
 • More recent (January 2026) Asknews articles, especially multiple Telegraph investigations, document that US Treasury sanctions (issued in October 2024 and December 2025) have attached labels to Chinese-supplied components—including attack UAV systems and precision weaponry—that evidence a US view on Chinese supplies crossing into the lethal realm.
Quality and Dates: The investigative reports (Telegraph, Business Insider) and official Treasury releases (October 2024 and December 2025) are high quality and up to date; they collectively suggest an evolving, escalating US official narrative. Although China denies such “lethal” transfers, independent intelligence and these sanctions documents are factual anchors.

(b) Evidence Analysis – Weighting factors:
 • Strong evidence: Two Treasury sanction events (October 2024 and December 2025) which link Chinese-sourced equipment (like CNC attack drones) to Russian lethal capability; plus Campbell’s explicit strong language from September 2024.
 • Moderate evidence: The persistent US concern over dual-use items evolving in tone with warnings from senior officials and the historical escalation pattern.
 • Weak evidence: Some ambiguous statements or discussions that use “dual-use” language without clear escalation.
Together, the weight of independent, reliable sources consistently points toward US officials having made (or being on track to soon make) a public accusation that falls under the resolution criteria.

(c) Timeframe Analysis – Our window is 92 days (about three months) until the definitive cutoff (May 1, 2026). If the timeframe were halved, less opportunity would exist for any further public statements, which might lower the probability. If the timeframe were doubled, we’d expect the chain of events and further official clarifications to make the accusation even likelier. In the current ~3-month period, the momentum from Treasury actions and already strong statements gives us a high chance—but not near certainty—given the sometimes cautious US diplomacy.

(d) Justification – The three most compelling factors are:
 1. The Treasury sanctions (October 2024 and December 2025) explicitly connect Chinese-supplied equipment to Russia’s lethal weapon production.
 2. Deputy Secretary Campbell’s statement in September 2024, where he described China’s contributions as more than dual-use support.
 3. The continuous escalation in US rhetoric evidenced over the 2022–2025 period, which suggests that by January 2026 the process of making a clear public accusation is well underway.
These factors shift our outside view base rate significantly away from a “status quo” careful deflection toward a concrete US accusation, even if some debate remains over the exact phrasing. They convince us that, with over 90 days remaining, a high likelihood exists that the eventual US public statement will meet the “lethal military aid” standard.

Probability calibration:
Given the strong and multiple independent lines of evidence, along with clear historical escalation and structural factors (sanctions and formal Treasury communications), I estimate that 73% out of 100 times, before May 1, 2026, the United States will publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia. A ±10% shift would be material – for instance, had the sanctions not been issued or if US diplomatic language remained vague, our probability might have fallen to the mid-60s; conversely, additional clear and explicit statements would push the probability closer to 80%.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the US, before May 1, 2026, publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia?” (92-day window)
2. Base rate: The reference class of past public accusations in similar military/diplomatic disputes supports our probability.
3. Consistency check: “73 out of 100 times, the US publicly accuses China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia by May 1, 2026.”
4. Key evidence:
 – Treasury sanctions linking Chinese equipment to lethal weapons (October 2024; December 2025).
 – Campbell’s aggressive September 2024 statement.
 – Historical escalation in bilateral US statements.
5. Blind-spot: The most likely scenario to make this forecast look silly would be if US officials decide to reframe the discussion under “dual-use” language only—thus, avoiding an explicit “lethal aid” accusation—which would lower the odds.
6. Status quo: Given persistent diplomatic caution and historical incremental shifts, our probability still comfortably favors an eventual explicit accusation in the remaining time period.

Probability: 73%
