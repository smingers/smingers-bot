Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. RBC-Ukraine (Dec 2025, UN Security Council)  
   • Facts: U.S. Deputy Ambassador Dorothy Shea said Chinese components are found in Russian drones and other weapons; demanded Beijing stop exporting dual-use goods.  
   • Opinion: Rhetorical condemnation; no explicit claim that China ships finished, lethal weapons.  
   • Quality: Primary quotation from an on-record U.S. diplomat carried by a mainstream newswire – moderate-to-high reliability on what was said, low certainty that the wording meets the question’s “lethal aid” bar.

2. POLITICO (10 Sep 2024)  
   • Facts: Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters China is giving Russia “very substantial” help that is “being applied directly to the Russian war machine” and “not dual-use.”  
   • Opinion: Campbell’s judgement on scale/danger; factual element is that a senior U.S. official uttered this.  
   • Quality: Well-sourced; POLITICO regularly travels with U.S. officials.  Good transcript fidelity.

3. U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission report (18 Jul 2025)  
   • Facts: Lists G7, EU and Ukrainian accusations that China is fuelling Russia’s war; notes repeated PRC denials.  
   • Opinion: Commission staff frame the trend as worrisome.  
   • Quality: Congressional research arm – high factual reliability; however, compiles secondary sources and does not itself constitute an executive-branch accusation.

4. PBS (19 Feb 2023) & NBC (3 Mar 2023)  
   • Facts: Blinken, Burns warned China was considering lethal aid; intel gleaned from Russian sources.  
   • Quality: Direct quotes, but only warnings of hypothetical future transfers.

5. VOA (26 Apr 2024)  
   • Facts: Blinken in Beijing criticised dual-use exports; threatened sanctions.  
   • Quality: Government broadcast quoting the Secretary; again stops short of saying China has already sent lethal arms.

6. Agent report (chronology through 23 Dec 2025)  
   • Facts: Compiles every identifiable public U.S. statement.  Indicates first explicit lethal-aid accusation 10 Sep 2024; Treasury sanctions in Oct 2024 & Dec 2025 cite delivery of Chinese-made UAVs to Russia.  
   • Quality: Carefully sourced; some primary documents still to be located, but the sanctions releases can be verified on home.treasury.gov.  High utility for base-rate counting.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. “Instances since 2000 in which the U.S. publicly accused another great power (China or Russia) of supplying lethal arms to an adversary.”  (Very small N ≈ 1–3 → unstable.)  
2. “Instances since 2000 in which the U.S. publicly accused any state of providing lethal arms to a belligerent it is sanctioning (e.g., Iran to Houthis & Hamas; DPRK to Russia).”  (N ≈ 15–25 → better.)  
3. “Frequency, per quarter, of new arms-supply accusations issued by the U.S. during an ongoing major war (Iraq 2003-11, Syria 2011-, Ukraine 2022-).”  (Dozens of datapoints, most comparable time pressure.)  

I choose class 3: quarterly probability that the U.S. issues at least one public accusation of lethal-arms transfers against a third country during a high-priority conflict.  This covers repeated statements against Iran (to proxies), DPRK (to Russia), Sudan (to South Sudan), etc., and is broad enough to give a stable base rate.

Empirical sketch:  
• 2003-11 Iraq: ~4 accusations/8 yrs → 0.12 per quarter.  
• 2014-21 Syria: ~16 accusations/28 qtrs → 0.57 per quarter.  
• 2022-25 Ukraine (non-China targets): Iran (drones), DPRK (artillery), Belarus (munitions) → 6 accusations/12 qtrs → 0.50 per quarter.  

Mean ≈ 0.40 per quarter that the U.S. singles out at least one state for lethal-aid accusations once a war is under way.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 May 2026: 93 days ≈ 1.0 quarter.  
If the base quarterly probability for “any target” is 0.40, what about China specifically?  The U.S. has already crossed the rhetorical Rubicon once (Sept 2024) and reinforced it (Treasury sanctions Oct 2024 & Dec 2025).  Since first crossing, China has been accused in 2 of the last 5 quarters → empirical per-quarter rate 0.40 as well.

(d) Justification for outside view  
• Status quo outcome: the U.S. has talked about dual-use items almost continuously; lethal-aid language surfaced twice in the last 16 months, establishing a precedent.  
• The war in Ukraine continues unabated; each new Russian offensive or Ukrainian strike tends to trigger fresh sanctions/briefings.  
• Political incentives: a U.S. election year heightens willingness to “name and shame” Beijing; bipartisan pressure in Congress is strong.  
• Accusation can take many forms acceptable to the resolver (White-House press briefing, State-Dept press release, Treasury sanctions notice).  The marginal cost is low.  
• Counter-considerations: Washington may judge that repeating the charge adds little leverage and prefer to work privately—or may save new revelations for a sanctions roll-out after May 1.

Combining: Historical base-rate 0.40 per quarter.  No strong evidence that the next 93 days are unusually quiet or unusually busy.  On an outside-view only (before examining any fresh January-2026 intel leaks, etc.) I retain that mean but widen for uncertainty (±10 pts).

Outside view calibration:

Starting point: 40 %.  
Up-weight (+5 pts) because precedent against China already exists (should marginally raise recurrence chances).  
Down-weight (–5 pts) because the resolver has not yet deemed prior statements sufficient—suggesting the bar may be stricter (e.g., needs Presidential or Secretary-level, explicit “lethal weapons” wording).  
Net: 40 %.  Apply a 0–10 pt fudge for general uncertainty → 41 % seems reasonable.

Outside View Prediction:
41 % (±1 %).
