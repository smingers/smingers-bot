Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological highlights)

1. BBC (20 Feb 2023) – High-quality public broadcaster.  Reports Blinken’s warning that China was “considering” lethal support.  Factual, but only discusses a hypothetical.  Weight: weak-to-moderate.

2. RFE/RL (23 May 2024) – Reputable, U.S-funded.  Contrasts UK defence-secretary claim of “lethal aid” with Sullivan’s explicit denial.  Factual, first-hand quotes.  Weight: strong (shows U.S. still pulling its punch mid-2024).

3. Politico / Business Insider (11 Sep 2024) – Mainstream outlets.  Quote Deputy-Secretary of State Kurt Campbell saying China is providing “very substantial” help “not dual-use”.  Interpretation that this equals “lethal aid” is journalistic; Campbell never used the word “weapons / ammunition”.  Weight: moderate.

4. Treasury sanctions packages (Oct 2024, Dec 2025 – referenced in articles) – Primary-source documents list Chinese entities for “support to Russia’s military-industrial base”, but language stops at “dual-use items”.  Weight: strong for mounting evidence, weak for lethal-aid accusation.

5. G7 statement (13 Nov 2025) – Multilateral communiqué accusing China of supplying “weapons and dual-use goods”.  Not a unilateral U.S. accusation.  Weight: moderate.

6. The Telegraph investigation + 15 derivative reports (28 Jan 2026) – Single British newspaper citing Ukrainian intel that China supplied CNC machines, chips etc.  Evidence points to production inputs, not finished weapons.  No new U.S. statement.  Quality: mixed (good record, but anonymous intel).  Weight: moderate at best.

7. Budanov (21 Jan 2026) – Former Ukrainian intel chief saying China has provided no weapons.  Identifiable expert making the opposite claim.  Weight: moderate (shows dispute).

Overall quality: we have many reputable outlets, but the only clearly identifiable U.S. official quote arguably crossing the “lethal” line (Campbell) is ambiguous enough that the resolver has not counted it.  No uncontested, formal U.S. accusation yet.

(b) Evidence weighing

Strong
• Historical pattern: U.S. warnings often graduate to public accusations once intel confidence ≥ ~80 % (e.g., Iran→Houthis drones 2019).  
• Institutional friction: bipartisan Congress pressing Treasury/State to “name and shame” Chinese suppliers.

Moderate
• Campbell 09/24 and G7 11/25 statements – show momentum but fall short of explicit “lethal weapons” phrasing by the U.S. alone.  
• Growing open-source evidence of Chinese machine-tool / drone-part exports.

Weak
• UK May 24 claim (explicitly rejected by U.S.).  
• Telegraph hypersonic-missile story – relies on Ukrainian intel, not corroborated by U.S. yet.  
• Budanov denial – single contrary voice, could be political signalling.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Days remaining to 1 May 2026: ≈ 93.  
If the window were halved (≈ 46 days) I would drop probability ~10 pp because the admin would need to act very soon.  
If doubled (≈ 186 days) I would add ~10 pp – more time for either new sanctions package or high-level speech.

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustment

Base rate (derived from past three-month windows after sustained warnings in comparable cases: Iran→Syria, DPRK→Russia): ~40 %.

Shifters upward  
+10 pp  Mounting trade data and allied pressure (Telegraph, G7) raise odds U.S. will “call it out”.  
+7 pp Congressional China hawks likely to exploit any fresh intel snapshots.  
Shifters downward  
−5 pp Trump administration has oscillated: rhetorical flare-ups but reluctance to formalise accusations that would trigger mandatory CAATSA sanctions on Beijing.  
−2 pp One clear opportunity (Campbell 2024) was not considered sufficient by resolvers, hinting the bar is high (must say “weapons / ammunition”, not “components”).  

Net shift: +10 pp → 50 % inside view, add small optimism (momentum) → 55 %.

Probability calibration

“I expect that in 55 out of 100 comparable worlds the United States issues a public statement or official document, before 1 May 2026, explicitly accusing China of supplying lethal weapons or munitions to Russia.”

Checklist:

1. Restated question: Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of supplying lethal weapons to Russia before 1 May 2026?  
2. Base rate 40 %; final 55 % rooted in that.  
3. Consistency: “55 times out of 100…” – passes sanity check.  
4. Key evidence: (a) Campbell Sept 24 quote; (b) G7 Nov 25 wording; (c) Telegraph Jan 26 data; (d) U.S. precedent of escalating warnings→accusations; (e) Trump admin’s mixed incentives.  
5. Blind spot: A sudden U.S.–China thaw (e.g., Taiwan talks breakthrough) could freeze rhetoric, cutting probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo bias considered – still more likely than not the U.S. continues incremental approach rather than leap to full accusation.

Probability: 55%
