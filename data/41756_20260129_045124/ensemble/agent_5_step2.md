Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order – all dates UTC)

1. BBC 20 Feb 2023 – Blinken said China was “considering” giving lethal support.  Factual quotes from Sec-State; reliable, but only a warning (opinion: U.S. concern).
2. RFE/RL 23 May 2024 – UK Defence Secretary claimed China is sending lethal aid; Jake Sullivan immediately denied.  Both officials quoted verbatim; high quality; shows U.S. reluctance to accuse.
3. Politico 11 Sep 2024 – Deputy Sec-State Kurt Campbell spoke of “very substantial” Chinese help “not dual-use.”  Single senior source; moderate evidence of shift.
4. CFR recap 7 Jul 2025 – Ukrainian intel alleged Chinese supplies; U.S. not involved.  Information is second-hand; weak for our criteria.
5. BBC 3 Sep 2025 – Trump social-media accusation; private capacity, not official U.S. accusation; low weight.
6. Treasury sanctions release (23 Dec 2025, mentioned in ask-news digest) – U.S. sanctioned three Chinese entities for “weapons, components and ammunition supplied to Russia.”  Primary-source document; strong factual evidence that the executive branch already judged lethal aid occurred, but the language was embedded in a sanctions notice, not a stand-alone public accusation and adjudicators have signalled this has not met the bar yet.
7-14. Telegraph-based cluster 28 Jan 2026 – Multiple outlets summarise Telegraph investigation that China provided $10.3 bn in machinery for hypersonic missiles.  Independent media, data from Ukrainian intel & Import Genius; moderate quality, indirect link (dual-use, not finished weapons).
15. Budanov speech 21 Jan 2026 – Ukrainian spymaster says China has NOT supplied weapons.  Identifiable expert, but statement cuts against the proposition.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong:
• December 2025 U.S. sanctions language naming Chinese “weapons” transfers – shows internal executive concurrence that lethal aid exists.
• Repeat pattern: U.S. usually moves from sanctions → explicit public accusation within 4–6 months (Iran Shahed drones 2022, DPRK shells 2023).

Moderate:
• Politico interview (Sep 2024) – first senior-level hint beyond dual-use.
• Multilateral pressure – G7 November 2025 statement blaming China.
• Telegraph investigation (Jan 2026) – fresh, detailed evidence China enabling missile production.

Weak:
• Budanov denial (could be diplomatic signalling).
• Trump Truth-Social post (not an official statement).
• UK May 2024 claim – already discounted by Washington.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time remaining: 93 days (≈3 months).  If the window were halved to 46 days I would cut probability by ~15 pp (bureaucratic lag).  If doubled to 6 months I would add ~10 pp (more time for accusation).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Starting outside base rate (derived earlier): 72 %.

Downward pressures (-):
• White House has so far resisted using “lethal aid” wording despite sanctions (-6 pp).
• Bid to preserve limited China-U.S. cooperation on fentanyl, AI & climate before U.S. election season (-4 pp).
• Budanov’s public denial suggests some evidence may still be ambiguous (-2 pp).

Upward pressures (+):
• Sanctions wording already crossed key legal threshold; public accusation now mainly a diplomatic choice (+6 pp).
• Multilateral chorus (G7, EU) lowers marginal cost of U.S. going public (+4 pp).
• Two high-profile events before 1 May: State Dept. annual Arms-Control report (April) and G7 Foreign Ministers’ meeting (mid-April) – classic venues for unveilings (+4 pp).

Net adjustment: –8 pp from the 72 % base → 64 %.

Probability calibration
My inside-view point estimate: 64 % that between today (29 Jan 2026) and 1 May 2026 the United States (executive-branch spokesperson, President, Sec-State, Sec-Defense, or Treasury/NSC press podium) will explicitly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will the U.S., before 1 May 2026, openly charge China with supplying lethal weapons to Russia?”  
2. Base rate recorded at 72 %.  
3. Consistency – “In 64 of 100 similar worlds, a public U.S. accusation occurs before the deadline.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Dec 2025 sanctions citing Chinese weapons.  
   • Historical escalation pattern after sanctions.  
   • G7 Nov 2025 accusation.  
   • Ongoing media investigations exposing transfers.  
   • White House caution so far.  
5. Blind-spot – A sudden U.S.-China thaw (e.g., major Taiwan détente) freezes the Ukraine issue, delaying any accusation past May; would slash probability to <25 %.  
6. Status-quo bias check – Silence has persisted 23 months; inertia argues modest tilt toward No, hence my downgrade from base rate.

Probability: 64%
