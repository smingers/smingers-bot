Analysis:
The key to this forecast is whether, before 1 May 2026, any authoritative U.S. government source (White House, State Department, Pentagon, Director of National Intelligence, etc.) makes a public claim that China has supplied lethal (i.e., deadly) military assistance to Russia. Relevant signals include: 1) official press briefings or statements; 2) testimony to Congress; 3) sanctions announcements citing such transfers; 4) intelligence disclosures; 5) investigative journalism citing U.S. officials on-the-record. Therefore, I need up-to-date reporting on U.S.-China-Russia arms issues and any new U.S. government assertions made in late-2025/early-2026. Searches should combine terms like “U.S. accuse China lethal aid Russia” or “U.S. sanctions China arms Russia” and scan both general web and news databases for January 2026 items.
