Analysis:
The key to answering the forecast is establishing whether, up to now (29 Jan 2026), Washington has ever said publicly that China has actually supplied lethal military aid—not merely “considered” or “might”—to Russia.  The outside view will therefore rely on:
• A timeline of U.S. government statements (White House, State Dept., Pentagon, intelligence leaks) mentioning Chinese “lethal aid,” “weapons,” “ammunition,” or “military equipment” delivered to Russia.  
• Any U.S. sanctions press-releases or Treasury designations that explicitly say Chinese entities provided lethal hardware.  
• Media coverage summarising U.S. accusations or the lack thereof (2022–2026).  
Collecting these data points will show the historical baseline: so far the U.S. has mostly warned of “considering” shipments, imposed export-control sanctions on dual-use components, but has it ever crossed the line into saying “China is supplying lethal weapons”?  That establishes how frequently (or rarely) such an accusation occurs and informs the probability of one happening before 1 May 2026.
