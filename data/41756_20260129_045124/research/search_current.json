The exports include precision computer numerical control (CNC) machines and specialized equipment used in manufacturing warheads and missile bodies. One such machine was identified by Ukrainian military intelligence at the Votkinsk Machine-Building Plant, a key Russian missile program facility producing Oreshnik, Iskander-M, and Topol-M systems, which is currently under sanctions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan. The value of China\u2019s dual-use equipment and technology exported to Russia is estimated at approximately $10.3 billion, according to the report. Additional exports include electronic chips and memory units valued at around $4.9 billion, ball bearings worth $130 million (critical for space applications), and piezoelectric crystals valued at $97 million, used in radar systems and electronic warfare platforms. These items fall under restricted export categories for Russia by a coalition of 39 Western nations, but China has not joined these sanctions, enabling Moscow to circumvent restrictions through direct shipments or intermediaries in third countries. Between 2022 and 2025, China exported at least $3.1 billion in equipment to Russia, with the actual figure likely higher due to third-party transit routes and intermediary companies. In January 2026, Russia used an Oreshnik missile to strike Lviv, Ukraine, reaching speeds of about 8,000 miles per hour and hitting its target in under 20 minutes. The system can carry up to six independently targetable warheads and is claimed by Russian sources to be uninterceptable. Western analysts warn it poses a strategic threat to Ukraine and NATO members. Ukrainian officials described the missile as more of a psychological weapon against Europe than a battlefield tool, noting Russia possesses only 3\u20134 units, with plans to begin serial production in 2026 at a rate of at least five units annually.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 01:30 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2026/1/28/2933422/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B7-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%83-)\n\n**China Supplies Russia with Critical Components for Oreshnik Missile Production \u2014 The Telegraph**\nAccording to a report by The Telegraph published on January 28, 2026, China has supplied Russia with critical components for the production of the Oreshnik missile and other advanced weaponry, totaling at least $10.3 billion in technology and equipment.

According to The Telegraph and Ukrainian intelligence, China supplied advanced computer numerical control (CNC) machines, precision cutting tools, and other components valued at $10.3 billion, enabling Russia to produce high-precision long-range weapons used in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Key equipment, including 'carousel' CNC machines for metal cutting and sharpening, was delivered to the 'Votkinsk Plant' in Udmurtia, which produces 'Oreshnik' (range: 5,500 km), 'Iskander-M' (700\u20131,000 km), and 'Topol-M' (10,500\u201312,000 km) missiles. Additional supplies included microchips ($4.9 billion), bearings ($130 million), piezoelectric crystals for radars ($97 million), telescopic sights ($42 million), and key testing instruments like multimeters and oscilloscopes. Ukrainian analysts confirm that Russia lacked the capability to produce or procure these components domestically, with 50 critical items missing from its domestic supply chain. China\u2019s role as a non-sanctioning supplier and transit hub has been vital in sustaining Russia\u2019s war effort. In 2022\u20132023, China delivered $3.1 billion worth of machinery to Russian defense plants. The 'Oreshnik' missile was first used in 2024, striking a facility in Dnipro; a second strike occurred in January 2026 near Lviv, confirmed by Ukraine\u2019s SBU through debris analysis. The Votkinsk Plant, located 1,400 km from Ukraine, has not been targeted by Ukrainian drones but experienced a factory explosion in August 2023. Analysts suggest two European air defense systems could potentially intercept 'Oreshnik', though Russian MoD claims 'Oreshnik' support vehicles are now deployed on Belarusian test ranges.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:21 PM\nSource:[\u0424\u041e\u041a\u0423\u0421](https://focus.ua/voennye-novosti/741868-raketa-oreshnik-vs-rf-stroitsya-s-pomoshchyu-kitaya-detali)\n\n**China and Russia Jointly Produce 'Oreshnik': How Beijing Supplies Critical Technologies**\nChina is supplying Russia with critical technology and equipment for the production of hypersonic missiles, including the 'Oreshnik' missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads, according to a Telegraph investigation. On January 1, Russian forces launched an 'Oreshnik' missile at Lviv, Ukraine, traveling at over 8,000 miles per hour\u2014just 40 miles from the Polish border. The missile can carry up to six warheads and has been used in combat only twice. Russia relies on specialized machinery, including Chinese computer-controlled lathe-turning machines, to manufacture high-precision components for these weapons. Ukrainian intelligence discovered one such machine at the state-owned Votkinsk Plant, which produces 'Oreshnik', 'Iskander-M', and 'Topol-M' missiles. China has supplied Russia with equipment and technology worth approximately $10.3 billion, including microchips, memory boards ($4.9 billion), ball bearings, piezoelectric crystals for radars, telescopic sights, and measuring instruments. Experts note that China's advanced machinery has allowed Russia to circumvent Western sanctions, boost hypersonic missile production, and enhance national defense. Michael Kofman, a Russia and Ukraine defense expert, stated that China's ability to produce high-precision machines now fully meets Russia\u2019s needs, despite Western dominance in this sector. Analysts highlight that many deliveries are routed through third countries, complicating tracking and enabling evasion of international sanctions. Over the first three years of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China delivered machinery worth more than $3.1 billion to Moscow. This technological support poses a greater threat to Ukraine and the West than individual deliveries of artillery shells or drones. Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun affirmed during a video conference with Russian official Andrei Belousov that Beijing and Moscow must 'jointly strengthen their capability to counter various risks and challenges and unite to make a positive contribution to global security and stability.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:55 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/zbroya/kitay-i-rossiya-vmeste-proizvodyat-oreshnik-kak-pekin-postavlyaet-kriticheskie-tehnologii-3009734.html)\n\n**China Supplies Russia with Critical Equipment for Hypersonic Weapons, Enabling War Effort Despite Sanctions**\nAccording to The Telegraph, China has supplied Russia with advanced manufacturing equipment, including computer-controlled (CNC) machine tools, critical for producing hypersonic weapons such as the 'Oreshnik' missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

China has provided Russia with equipment and components worth at least $10.3 billion, including microchips, memory boards ($4.9 billion), bearings ($130 million), piezoelectric crystals ($97 million), and telescopic sights ($42 million), all vital for precision weapons and aircraft production. These goods fall under a list of 50 high-priority exports banned by 39 countries, including the US and UK, but China has not imposed such sanctions. The Telegraph notes that China\u2019s exports have enabled Vladimir Putin to circumvent Western sanctions, boost Russia\u2019s military self-sufficiency, and sustain its war in Ukraine. Analysts, including Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment and Nick Reynolds of the UK\u2019s Defence Analysis Centre, emphasize that China\u2019s industrial ecosystem far outpaces Russia\u2019s, making Chinese imports essential for Russia\u2019s defense industry. Over the first three years of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China shipped at least $3.1 billion in machine tools to Russia. The article argues that this technological support is more strategically damaging than the short-term impact of hundreds of Iranian drones. Additionally, China has supplied testing equipment like multimeters and oscilloscopes to ensure weapon functionality. A 2025 investigation found that Chinese firms directly supplied at least $55 million to Russia\u2019s military drone industry between 2023 and 2024, with actual figures likely higher due to hidden trade through third countries to evade sanctions.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:33 AM\nSource:[ZN.UA](https://zn.ua/ukr/war/kitaj-postachaje-rf-obladnannja-dlja-hiperzvukovoji-zbroji-tipu-orjeshnik-the-telegraph.html)\n\n**China Supplies Russia with Critical Military Technology, Fueling Oreshnik Missile Production \u2013 The Telegraph**\nAccording to a report by 'The Telegraph' published on January 28, 2026, China has supplied Russia with advanced military technology worth at least $10.3 billion, significantly aiding Russia\u2019s production of the Oreshnik missile.

The exports include precision computer numerical control (CNC) machines and specialized equipment used in manufacturing warheads and missile bodies. One such machine was identified by Ukrainian military intelligence at the Votkinsk Machine-Building Plant, a key Russian missile program facility producing Oreshnik, Iskander-M, and Topol-M systems, which is currently under sanctions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan. The value of China\u2019s dual-use equipment and technology exported to Russia is estimated at approximately $10.3 billion, according to the report. Additional exports include electronic chips and memory units valued at around $4.9 billion, ball bearings worth $130 million (critical for space applications), and piezoelectric crystals valued at $97 million, used in radar systems and electronic warfare platforms. These items fall under restricted export categories for Russia by a coalition of 39 Western nations, but China has not joined these sanctions, enabling Moscow to circumvent restrictions through direct shipments or intermediaries in third countries. Between 2022 and 2025, China exported at least $3.1 billion in equipment to Russia, with the actual figure likely higher due to third-party transit routes and intermediary companies. In January 2026, Russia used an Oreshnik missile to strike Lviv, Ukraine, reaching speeds of about 8,000 miles per hour and hitting its target in under 20 minutes. The system can carry up to six independently targetable warheads and is claimed by Russian sources to be uninterceptable. Western analysts warn it poses a strategic threat to Ukraine and NATO members.

The article notes that Russia launched the 'Oreshnik' missile toward Lviv, Ukraine, in early January 2024, located just 64 kilometers from the Polish border. The missile, used in combat only twice, can deploy up to six warheads during flight to strike multiple targets. The production of such warheads relies on advanced machinery, with a key component being a Chinese-made turret lathe used at the state-owned factory in Votkinsk\u2014sanctioned by the UK, US, EU, and Japan\u2014which produces 'Oreshnik', 'Iskander-M', and 'Topol-M' missiles. The Telegraph reports that China has sent $10.3 billion in high-priority technology and modern equipment to Russia, including $4.9 billion in microchips and memory boards, $130 million in bearings, and $97 million in piezoelectric crystals for radar and electronic warfare systems. Senior Carnegie Foundation analyst Michael Kofman stated that without China as a logistical and technological conduit, sustaining Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine would be extremely difficult. Over the first three years of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, China supplied at least $3.1 billion in machinery. Additionally, Chinese firms delivered at least $55 million in components for military drones to Russia between 2023 and 2024.

According to The Telegraph and Ukrainian intelligence, China supplied advanced computer numerical control (CNC) machines, precision cutting tools, and other components valued at $10.3 billion, enabling Russia to produce high-precision long-range weapons used in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Key equipment, including 'carousel' CNC machines for metal cutting and sharpening, was delivered to the 'Votkinsk Plant' in Udmurtia, which produces 'Oreshnik' (range: 5,500 km), 'Iskander-M' (700\u20131,000 km), and 'Topol-M' (10,500\u201312,000 km) missiles. Additional supplies included microchips ($4.9 billion), bearings ($130 million), piezoelectric crystals for radars ($97 million), telescopic sights ($42 million), and key testing instruments like multimeters and oscilloscopes. Ukrainian analysts confirm that Russia lacked the capability to produce or procure these components domestically, with 50 critical items missing from its domestic supply chain. China\u2019s role as a non-sanctioning supplier and transit hub has been vital in sustaining Russia\u2019s war effort. In 2022\u20132023, China delivered $3.1 billion worth of machinery to Russian defense plants. The 'Oreshnik' missile was first used in 2024, striking a facility in Dnipro; a second strike occurred in January 2026 near Lviv, confirmed by Ukraine\u2019s SBU through debris analysis. The Votkinsk Plant, located 1,400 km from Ukraine, has not been targeted by Ukrainian drones but experienced a factory explosion in August 2023.

The missile can carry up to six warheads and has been used in combat only twice. Russia relies on specialized machinery, including Chinese computer-controlled lathe-turning machines, to manufacture high-precision components for these weapons. Ukrainian intelligence discovered one such machine at the state-owned Votkinsk Plant, which produces 'Oreshnik', 'Iskander-M', and 'Topol-M' missiles. China has supplied Russia with equipment and technology worth approximately $10.3 billion, including microchips, memory boards ($4.9 billion), ball bearings, piezoelectric crystals for radars, telescopic sights, and measuring instruments. Experts note that China's advanced machinery has allowed Russia to circumvent Western sanctions, boost hypersonic missile production, and enhance national defense. Michael Kofman, a Russia and Ukraine defense expert, stated that China's ability to produce high-precision machines now fully meets Russia\u2019s needs, despite Western dominance in this sector. Analysts highlight that many deliveries are routed through third countries, complicating tracking and enabling evasion of international sanctions. Over the first three years of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China delivered machinery worth more than $3.1 billion to Moscow. This technological support poses a greater threat to Ukraine and the West than individual deliveries of artillery shells or drones.

Despite this, Budanov asserted that China has profited significantly from Western sanctions on Russia by supplying critical technologies such as electronics, microchips, and machinery\u2014essential for Russia\u2019s weapons production\u2014due to Moscow\u2019s isolation from Western tech. He emphasized that Russia became a reliable customer for China, paying significantly higher prices than other nations, enabling China to earn super-profits. According to Budanov, this economic dependency has allowed China to increase its influence over the Kremlin. 'The more sanctions worked from outside, the more Russia was slipping into China\u2019s hands, which is now openly visible,' he said. He also noted that while there has been a transfer of military technologies between the two countries, no actual weapons have been transferred from China to Russia. Budanov described China as effectively 'consuming' the aggressor state, a reality that Russian citizens can no longer ignore. This statement was reported by Dialog.UA, which also noted Budanov\u2019s prior visit to the U.S. for negotiations and his perceived influence on Ukraine\u2019s diplomatic positioning.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/world/327444_1768943446)\n\n**Despite Sanctions: Secret Russia-China Arms Deals Revealed as China Arms for Taiwan Invasion**\nAccording to a 'Kyiv Independent' investigation, China has secretly purchased Russian weapons since 2023, including aircraft, armored vehicles, and ammunition, to equip its airborne troops. The purchases, which circumvent international sanctions, involve direct payments to Russian defense firms listed under sanctions. The weapons are tailored for airborne operations, such as paratrooper deployment, and align with production and testing timelines suggesting a potential invasion of Taiwan in 2027\u2014coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and a key political year for Chinese President Xi Jinping. The cooperation began shortly after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with China\u2019s first request in April 2022 and a Russian demonstration of airborne equipment for a Chinese delegation in April 2023. The report identifies 40 Chinese military personnel and defense officials who traveled to Russia during the war to negotiate deals. Evidence comes from leaked Russian documents published by the hacker group 'Black Moon', including internal correspondence, contracts, flight data, and copies of Chinese officers\u2019 passports. A former NATO intelligence officer stated, 'The Ukraine crisis is an opportunity for China to profit from Russia\u2019s distress.' Analysts note this deepens the strategic military partnership between China and Russia, enhancing China\u2019s military readiness while providing critical revenue to Russia\u2019s war-damaged defense industry.

Three weeks later, Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSMTC) instructed Rosoboronexport, the state-owned arms exporter, to present Russian airborne combat vehicles to a Chinese delegation. The delegation visited Moscow in April 2023, marking one of several meetings that led to multiple military agreements between China and Russia post-war, benefiting sanctioned Russian arms manufacturers through arms exports to China. China receives weapons and equipment in return, intended for the People's Liberation Army Airborne Corps, which is enhancing its capabilities in preparation for a potential invasion of Taiwan. Additional reports from December 2, 2024, indicate China has supplied Russia with dual-use materials, including tires, aramid fibers, rubber, and fuel additives, critical for sustaining Russian military operations. Ukrainian economic security experts estimate China exported $61.6 million worth of tires, fibers, and rubber to Russia in 2024. Russia used approximately 70 sorties of Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft against Ukraine between 2023 and 2024. Experts, including Roman Steblivskyi from the Ukrainian Economic Security Association, state that without Chinese supply chains, Russia could not maintain sufficient military production. Of 9 tire suppliers, 1 was sanctioned by the U.S.; of 10 aramid fiber suppliers, 2 were sanctioned; of 10 rubber suppliers, 2 were sanctioned; and none of the suppliers of fatty acids and fuel additives were sanctioned. Ukrainian officials note that the U.S. has paused secondary sanctions on China, and the EU is still adjusting its sanctions framework. They emphasize the need for expanded sanctions and stronger enforcement, especially as Chinese-made CNC machine tools, microelectronics, and other components are critical to Russia\u2019s military industry. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service reported that China provided satellite imagery used by Russia to target strategic facilities in Ukraine, including foreign investment sites. Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy, have criticized China for its silence and support, with Zelenskyy stating, 'Without China, Putin is nothing.' In September 2024, Reuters reported that at least six Chinese drone experts visited Russia since the second quarter to assist IEMZ Kupol, a state-owned arms manufacturer, in developing military drones. The company also received Chinese-made attack and reconnaissance drones. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence Directorate (HUR) stated that 60% to 65% of electronic components in Russian suicide drones come from China, signaling a shift from Western reliance. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 07, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84%E6%AA%A2%E7%B4%A2/%E8%A6%81%E8%81%9E%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/20251207-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E7%A7%98%E5%AF%86%E8%B3%BC%E8%B2%B7%E4%BF%84%E7%BE%85%E6%96%AF%E8%BB%8D%E5%82%99%E4%BB%A5%E6%8F%90%E9%AB%98%E5%85%A5%E4%BE%B5%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%88%B0%E5%8A%9B)\n\n**Sanctions aren't enough to shut down the Moscow-Tehran black market for war**\nOn October 5, 2025, Russia launched a barrage of 549 drones and missiles at Lviv, Ukraine, killing five people and disrupting power for tens of thousands. These weapons, though produced in a Russian arms factory 500 miles east of Moscow, relied on Iranian blueprints, Russian materials, and Western technology. A $1.75 billion deal in 2023 allowed Russia to import thousands of Iranian Shahed UAVs and develop domestic production capabilities, achieving up to 90% self-sufficiency in manufacturing and assembly at the Alabuga facility. Russia has since engineered Russian jet-powered variants of the Shahed-238 for kamikaze attacks. However, it still imports critical components like advanced sensors and microcomputers, including microprocessors from American companies such as Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that the October 5 attack contained over 100,000 foreign-made parts, many from U.S. and NATO sources. A 2024 investigation revealed over 200,000 illicit shipments of microelectronics entered Russia between 2022 and early 2024. Iran and Russia have intensified cooperation since 2023, using illicit shipping networks, front companies, and sanctions evasion schemes to build a shadow defense-industrial economy funded by oil sales. In July 2025, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned over 50 individuals and 50 vessels linked to Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani\u2019s network, which operated from the UAE, used ships to smuggle dual-use components, weapons, and oil across the Caspian Sea, and involved at least 20 countries. Despite prior sanctions in January 2023 and subsequent actions, U.S. efforts to disrupt these supply chains have failed. The geographic scope and resilience of this cooperation demonstrate the limitations of traditional sanctions in stopping the flow of critical dual-use components. Without stronger enforcement, including closer coordination with allies in Europe and Central Asia, secondary sanctions, and port access restrictions, this model of joint weapons development and smuggling is likely to expand. Russia and Iran may replicate this system with other adversaries like China or North Korea, and Russia may help Iran revive smuggling routes to proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024. The war in Ukraine has taught Iran and Russia that they can bypass Western markets by creating a self-sustaining shadow economy. Failure to develop new interdiction strategies risks undermining U.S. interests in future conflicts.

On November 13, 2025, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China has 'always acted openly and honestly,' never provided lethal weapons to any party in the conflict, and strictly controls exports of dual-use items. The G7, in a joint statement following a meeting in Canada, accused China of supplying weapons and dual-use goods to Russia, which they claim enables Moscow to sustain its aggressive war. Despite China's official neutrality and refusal to label either side as aggressor or victim, analysts note a significant increase in trade between China and Russia since the full-scale invasion began. In particular, Chinese exports of optical fiber cables and lithium-ion batteries to Russian drone manufacturers surged in summer 2025, enabling Moscow to enhance its drone production and operational effectiveness. These developments, according to experts, highlight a close economic and industrial partnership between Russian and Chinese producers that provides Russia with a strategic military advantage. China has also become Russia's primary supplier of electronics and dual-use components, especially under intensified Western sanctions.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/politics-news/kitaj-zavzhdi-die-vidkrito-i-chesno-pekin-zaperechiv-zvinuvachennya-g7-u-postachanni-rosii-zbroi-ta-komplektuyuchih.htm)\n\n**China Denies G7 Accusations of Supplying Russia with Weapons and Dual-Use Goods**\nChina has rejected allegations by the G7 foreign ministers that it supplied lethal weapons or dual-use goods to Russia, calling the claims baseless and an attempt to shift blame for the ongoing war in Ukraine. On November 13, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China has 'always acted openly and honestly,' never supplied lethal weapons to any party in the conflict, and strictly controls exports of dual-use products. The G7 had issued a joint statement after a meeting in Canada, accusing China, North Korea, and Iran of providing military assistance to Russia, which they claim enables Moscow\u2019s continued aggression. Despite China\u2019s official neutrality and refusal to label either side as aggressor or victim, and its withdrawal from active diplomatic efforts to end the war since last year, trade with Russia has surged since the full-scale invasion began. Chinese factories have significantly increased exports of drone components, including fiber-optic cables and lithium-ion batteries, to Russian manufacturers\u2014especially during summer 2025\u2014enabling Moscow to enhance its drone warfare capabilities. Analysts note that this rapid export growth demonstrates a close operational partnership between Russian and Chinese producers, giving Russia a strategic military advantage. As reported by OBOZREVATEL, Russia relies increasingly on allies like China amid intensified Western sanctions, benefiting from economic support and energy sales revenue.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 05:47 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/politics-news/kitaj-vsegda-dejstvuet-otkryito-i-chestno-pekin-oproverg-obvineniya-g7-v-postavkah-rossii-oruzhiya-i-komplektuyuschih.htm)\n\n**Zelenskyy Condemns Western Nations for Supplying Russia with Weapon Components**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly criticized Western nations on October 7, 2025, accusing them of undermining Ukraine by continuing to export components used in Russian weapons production. According to Zelenskyy, Ukrainian forces have identified parts from China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the UK in Russian missiles and 'Geranium' drones, including American electronics and British flight control microprocessors. He claimed that Ukraine and its partners possess detailed records of these exports and called on the implicated countries to halt the supply of critical components for missiles and drones, warning of new sanctions against entities and individuals aiding Russia. Zelenskyy emphasized that the supply is not limited to 'a few dozen parts' but involves 'hundreds of thousands' of components, framing it as pure commercial trade, and asserted that stopping these exports would prevent Putin from continuing the war. However, this accusation is not new\u2014Ukraine has repeatedly raised similar concerns since 2023. Investigations, including one by *Europe New Post* in March 2025, revealed that Russia continues to acquire Western electronic components and chips despite sanctions, with at least 16 parts in a Kh-101 cruise missile traced to U.S. and Swiss suppliers such as Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, and Maxim Integrated. A September 2025 report by CNN confirmed that components found in Russian missiles were 'recently manufactured,' indicating Western export controls are ineffective at tracking component flows. Despite Zelenskyy\u2019s repeated complaints, Western nations continue exporting such parts. The claim that China is supplying Russia with drone parts is also misleading\u2014China has strict export controls, and the components used by both sides in Ukraine are sourced via third countries. The article notes that Western nations, particularly the UK, have historically served as smuggling channels for Ukraine, with the UK spending $252 million in 2024 to purchase drones for Ukraine. UK officials admitted they were less concerned about 'Chinese component risks' than about the high cost and poor quality of alternatives. The article concludes that Zelenskyy\u2019s demand for a halt to Western exports is unrealistic and reflects a naive belief that Western powers would prioritize Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty over their own strategic and economic interests, especially given that the war has become a testing ground for Western weapons and a source of profit.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8nG5IF6der0)\n\n**Zelenskyy Accuses Foreign Nations of Supplying Components to Russian Weapons Amid Escalating Attacks**\nOn October 5, 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia used over 50 missiles, including 'Kinzhal' hypersonic missiles, and approximately 500 attack drones in a large-scale aerial assault on multiple Ukrainian regions. He attributed the situation to foreign support for Russia, asserting that Russian weapons contain components from U.S., Chinese, British, German, Swiss, Japanese, South Korean, and Dutch companies. Zelenskyy stated that each 'Kinzhal' missile contains 96 foreign-made parts and that the 500 drones include over 100,000 foreign components. He specifically cited U.S. firms for supplying electronic components for Russian missiles and 'Geranium' drones, and British firms for producing microprocessors used in Russian drone flight control systems. Zelenskyy announced Ukraine\u2019s intent to impose new sanctions on individuals aiding Russia and submitted a plan to restrict supply chains to international partners, calling for a coordinated response at the upcoming G7 sanctions coordination meeting. He emphasized that stopping the flow of critical components\u2014numbering in the tens of thousands\u2014is essential to reducing Ukraine\u2019s threat level. In response, the UK Department for Business and Trade stated it has implemented the 'strictest package of sanctions' and banned exports of thousands of goods, including those highlighted by Ukraine. Zelenskyy has repeatedly made statements targeting China, claiming Russia is entirely dependent on China and urging Beijing to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion, while criticizing China for remaining silent. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, responded on September 24, 2025, reaffirming China\u2019s objective and impartial stance since the start of the crisis, advocating for peace and dialogue, and noting that this position is widely recognized by the international community.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8nFnCx2yLX6)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
