Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**January 2026 AskNews Articles (Multiple sources, Jan 28-29, 2026):**
These are the most recent and relevant sources. Key facts:
- **The Telegraph (Jan 28, 2026)** allegedly reported China supplied specialized machinery for Oreshnik missile production
- **Institute for the Study of War (ISW) (Jan 28, 2026)** reported Chinese deliveries enabled enhanced drone production
- **Chinese MFA spokesperson Gao Jiakun (Jan 29, 2026)** denied all allegations, stating China "does not provide military support to any side"
- Multiple sources cite discovery of Chinese CNC lathes at Votkinsk plant producing missiles

**Critical Assessment:** These are reports ABOUT allegations, not direct US government accusations. The Telegraph article and ISW analysis are third-party assessments. No direct quote from a US government official accusing China of providing lethal military aid appears in these sources. China's denial is a factual statement but doesn't constitute evidence of a US accusation.

**October 2025 Atlantic Council Article:**
Treasury Secretary Bessent raised concerns about Chinese drone components and promised "photo evidence soon." This is a statement of concern and planned evidence release, not a formal accusation meeting resolution criteria. The article conflates dual-use components with lethal aid.

**September 2024 Business Insider/Financial Times:**
Deputy Secretary Campbell stated China provides "component pieces" to help "sustain, build, and diversify" Russia's war machine. The article characterizes this as "the first time" a US official said China is providing lethal aid. However, Campbell's actual quoted words refer to "component pieces" - not finished lethal weapons systems like missiles, armed drones, or ammunition. This is the strongest statement to date but remains ambiguous on whether it meets the resolution criteria requiring "specific about the type of lethal aid."

**Other Historical Sources (2023-2025):**
Multiple sources document US warnings and concerns but consistently include caveats like "we have not yet seen it" or focus on dual-use items rather than lethal weapons.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against Resolution:**
- **35+ months of warnings without formal accusation** (February 2023 - January 2026): Despite strong diplomatic incentives to make such accusations, the US has maintained distinction between dual-use and lethal aid. This pattern is highly significant.
- **Consistent official caveats**: Every major US statement through January 2026 has included explicit language about not seeing actual lethal weapon transfers, as documented in the agent report.
- **China's specific denials**: While self-serving, China has consistently and specifically denied providing "lethal weapons" (distinct from dual-use items), and the US has not contradicted these denials with accusations.

**Moderate Evidence Against Resolution:**
- **Short timeframe remaining**: Only 92 days (January 29 - May 1, 2026) with no recent escalation in US rhetoric suggesting imminent accusation.
- **Focus on dual-use items**: Recent reporting (October 2025 - January 2026) continues to emphasize dual-use components, CNC lathes, and industrial support rather than finished lethal systems.

**Weak Evidence For Resolution:**
- **Campbell September 2024 statement**: Could potentially be characterized as meeting criteria, but ambiguous language about "component pieces" rather than specific lethal weapons types.
- **ISW January 2026 report**: Third-party analysis suggesting Chinese support for weapons production, but not a US government accusation.
- **Bessent's promised evidence**: October 2025 announcement of forthcoming photo evidence could materialize into formal accusation, but 3+ months have passed without follow-up.

**Weak Evidence Against Resolution:**
- **Trump administration unpredictability**: New administration might take harder line, but no evidence of policy shift in first month.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current Timeframe:** 92 days (January 29 - May 1, 2026)

**If Halved (46 days):** Would decrease probability to ~5%. Insufficient time for intelligence gathering, interagency coordination, and diplomatic preparation needed for such a significant accusation.

**If Doubled (184 days):** Would increase probability to ~15-18%. More time allows for:
- Bessent's promised evidence to materialize
- New administration to establish China policy
- Accumulation of additional evidence
- Potential recharacterization of existing statements

The short timeframe is a significant constraint. Major diplomatic accusations typically require:
1. Intelligence confirmation (ongoing)
2. Interagency coordination (weeks)
3. Alliance consultation (weeks)
4. Strategic timing consideration (variable)

With only 92 days and no recent escalation in rhetoric, the probability remains low.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Adjustment:**

My outside view base rate of 9% was based on:
- Historical pattern of warnings evolving to accusations (Iran: 3-4 months, North Korea: ~6 months)
- China case: 35+ months with no accusation (strong negative indicator)

**Current Information Impact:**

The January 2026 sources provide **weak evidence** that marginally increases probability:
1. ISW report and Telegraph article suggest intensifying Chinese support, but these are third-party analyses, not US accusations
2. China's denials confirm the issue remains active in diplomatic discourse
3. No new US government statements constitute formal accusations

**Critical Gap:** The resolution criteria require the US government to "publicly accuse" China with specifics about lethal aid type and corroborating detail. None of the January 2026 sources contain such a statement. The ISW report and Telegraph article are analysis/reporting about Chinese support, not US government accusations.

**Factors Preventing Large Shift from Base Rate:**

1. **Pattern consistency**: 35-month pattern of non-accusation remains unchanged
2. **No new US statements**: January 2026 sources contain no new US government accusations, only third-party reporting
3. **Definitional clarity maintained**: US continues distinguishing dual-use from lethal aid
4. **Strategic considerations**: US-China relationship management likely constrains accusations absent overwhelming evidence

**Small Upward Adjustment Justified:**

The January 2026 reporting suggests:
- Increased media/analyst attention to Chinese support
- Potential evidence accumulation (CNC lathes at Votkinsk)
- ISW (respected think tank) making stronger claims

This marginally increases the probability that:
1. Evidence might reach threshold for US accusation
2. Bessent's promised evidence might materialize
3. Campbell's September 2024 statement might be clarified/recharacterized

However, these remain speculative. The absence of any new US government statement in January 2026 is notable.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting Point:** 9% (outside view)

**Adjustments:**
- January 2026 third-party reporting (ISW, Telegraph): +2% (weak evidence of intensifying support)
- Continued absence of US government accusations: -1% (reinforces pattern)
- Short timeframe (92 days): -1% (insufficient time for typical accusation process)

**Net Adjustment:** 0% (conflicting weak signals cancel out)

**Calibrated Prediction:** 9%

**Confidence Check:**
- 9 out of 100 times, this scenario would produce a US accusation within 92 days
- This aligns with: Very strong historical pattern against accusation, but acknowledging small probability of rapid policy shift or evidence emergence
- A 10% shift to 19% would imply 1-in-5 odds, which seems too high given 35-month pattern
- A 10% shift to 0% would ignore genuine uncertainty about Campbell statement interpretation and possible evidence emergence

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will US publicly accuse China of supplying specific lethal military aid (ammunition, missiles, armed drones, tanks, jets) to Russia with corroborating details before May 1, 2026?

2. **Base rate:** 9% from outside view based on 35-month pattern of warnings without accusations despite strong incentives and short timeframe remaining.

3. **Consistency:** "9 out of 100 times, the US publicly accuses China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia within 92 days despite 35 months of prior warnings without accusation." This aligns with very low but non-zero probability.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 35+ months of warnings without formal accusation (strong negative)
   - All US statements through Jan 2026 include caveats about not seeing lethal transfers (strong negative)
   - January 2026 third-party reports suggest intensifying support but contain no US accusations (weak positive)
   - Campbell Sept 2024 statement ambiguous on meeting resolution criteria (weak positive)
   - Only 92 days remaining with no rhetoric escalation (moderate negative)

5. **Blind spot:** Campbell's September 2024 statement could be officially clarified/recharacterized as meeting resolution criteria, or Bessent's promised evidence could materialize quickly into formal accusation. This could shift probability to 30-40%.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is continued warnings about dual-use support without crossing threshold to accusing China of lethal military aid. Given 35-month pattern and strategic US-China relationship considerations, status quo is highly likely to persist through May 1, 2026.

Probability: 9%
