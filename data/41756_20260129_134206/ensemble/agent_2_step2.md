Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Historical Sources (Pre-2026):**
- **Atlantic Council (Oct 2025):** Opinion piece citing Treasury Secretary Bessent's concerns about Chinese drone components. Factual core: U.S. officials estimate China provides "nearly 80%" of dual-use items. No formal accusation of lethal aid. Moderate reliability on quotes, but advocacy-oriented analysis.
- **Business Insider (Sep 2024):** Reports Deputy SecState Kurt Campbell stating China provides "very substantial" support that is "not dual-use capabilities" but "component pieces." This is the strongest pre-2026 statement, but still frames support as components rather than complete lethal systems. High reliability for direct quotes.
- **Global Times (Apr 2025):** Chinese state media reporting official denials. Factual for understanding China's position but no independent evidentiary value.

**January 2026 Sources (Current):**
- **Telegraph/ISW Reports (Jan 28-29, 2026):** Multiple articles cite Telegraph analysis claiming China supplied specialized machinery, CNC lathes, and equipment enabling production of Oreshnik missiles and Shahed drones. ISW report states these deliveries enabled Moscow to enhance drone production. **Critical distinction:** These are reports about Chinese exports enabling Russian production, not U.S. government accusations.
- **Chinese MFA Responses (Jan 29, 2026):** Multiple sources quote spokesperson Gao Jiakun/Gao Zijun denying allegations, stating China "does not fuel the fire" and "does not provide military support to any side." These are responses to media reports, not U.S. government accusations.
- **German/European Media (Jan 28, 2026):** Focus and N-tv articles cite the Telegraph analysis and ISW findings about $3+ billion in machinery exports. These are third-party analyses, not U.S. government statements.
- **U.S. Government Statements (Jan 2026):** The UN Security Council meeting (Jan 13, 2026) shows U.S. Deputy Ambassador condemning Russia's Oreshnik launch but **no mention of Chinese supply**. No other U.S. government accusations identified in January 2026 sources.

**Evidence Quality Assessment:** The January 2026 news cycle shows significant media/think-tank reporting about Chinese equipment enabling Russian missile production, but **zero U.S. government accusations** meeting the resolution criteria. All U.S. statements remain at the "concern" or "warning" level.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence Against Resolution:**
- **Four-year pattern of restraint:** Despite continuous intelligence about Chinese support since 2022, the U.S. has never crossed from "warnings" to "accusations" regarding lethal aid.
- **January 2026 missed opportunity:** The Telegraph/ISW reports (Jan 28) provided perfect justification for a U.S. accusation if one were planned. The U.S. remained silent, suggesting deliberate policy restraint.
- **High diplomatic cost:** A formal accusation would trigger severe U.S.-China crisis, potentially derailing trade relations, Taiwan policy coordination, and North Korea negotiations. The threshold for such a move is extremely high.

**Moderate Evidence Against Resolution:**
- **Campbell's Sep 2024 statement ambiguity:** Even the strongest prior statement (Campbell calling support "not dual-use") still referred to "component pieces" rather than complete weapons systems. This suggests U.S. policy carefully avoids the "lethal aid" characterization.
- **Chinese response pattern:** Beijing's Jan 29 denials were responses to media reports, not U.S. accusations, indicating no recent U.S. escalation.

**Weak Evidence For Resolution:**
- **Increased media attention:** The Jan 2026 reporting surge could precede government action, as media sometimes leads official statements.
- **Election year politics:** 2026 midterm considerations might incentivize tough China rhetoric.

**Evidence Weight:** The strong evidence heavily favors non-resolution. The moderate evidence reinforces this. Weak evidence for resolution is insufficient to overcome the established pattern.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Remaining time:** 92 days (until May 1, 2026)

**Timeframe considerations:**
- **If halved (46 days):** Would reduce probability by ~30-40%, as less time for policy shifts or new evidence to emerge.
- **If doubled (184 days):** Would increase probability by ~50-70%, as more time allows for intelligence declassification, interagency coordination, and strategic timing around diplomatic events.

**Critical windows:**
- Next 30 days: If U.S. were planning an accusation based on Jan 28 reports, announcement would likely come in February.
- Days 30-60: G-7 or NATO summits could provide platform for coordinated accusation.
- Days 60-92: Increasingly unlikely as May 1 deadline approaches without prior diplomatic preparation.

**(d) Justification:**

**Base rate adjustment reasoning:**

Starting from outside view of 4%, I must evaluate whether January 2026 circumstances warrant significant shifts:

**Factors suggesting increase:**
1. Substantial new reporting (Telegraph/ISW) about Chinese machinery enabling Oreshnik production
2. Media cycle creating political pressure for U.S. response
3. Precedent: Iran drone accusations followed similar media→government pattern in 2022

**Factors suggesting decrease:**
1. **Critical:** U.S. government silence in response to Jan 28 reports despite perfect opportunity
2. Four-year pattern shows extreme reluctance to escalate rhetoric to "accusation"
3. China is fundamentally different from Iran—peer competitor status makes accusations far costlier
4. No indication of imminent policy shift in available sources

**Net assessment:** The January 2026 reporting represents a "test moment" that the U.S. explicitly declined. If the Administration were prepared to make an accusation, the Telegraph evidence would have triggered it. The silence is strong negative evidence.

However, the reporting does establish that sufficient evidence exists for an accusation if political will emerged. This prevents dropping probability to near-zero.

**Calibrated adjustment:** The base rate of 4% should decrease slightly to account for the "failed test moment" but not dramatically, as 92 days still allows for policy shifts. Adjust to 3-5% range.

**Probability Calibration:**

My outside view established 4% based on historical China-specific patterns. January 2026 evidence shows:
- No U.S. government escalation despite new reporting
- Continued pattern of restraint
- High diplomatic costs remain unchanged
- But evidence base for potential accusation has strengthened

The "failed test moment" of Jan 28-29 is significant negative evidence, suggesting the threshold for accusation remains unmet despite available intelligence. However, 92 days is sufficient time for policy recalibration if circumstances change (e.g., major battlefield development, domestic political pressure, or Chinese policy shift).

Balancing these factors:
- Base rate: 4%
- January silence: -1 to -2 percentage points
- Remaining time window: +0.5 to +1 percentage points
- Evidence availability: +0.5 percentage points

**Final calibrated probability: 3%**

This reflects:
- Low baseline probability from historical restraint pattern
- Negative update from January non-response
- Recognition that sufficient time remains for unlikely but possible policy shift
- Acknowledgment that accusation remains within realm of possibility given evidence base

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Will U.S. government publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid (ammunition, missiles, drones, tanks, jets) to Russia before May 1, 2026, with specific details?
2. **Base rate:** 4% from China-specific historical patterns; final prediction (3%) remains anchored to this with modest downward adjustment.
3. **Consistency:** "3 out of 100 times, the U.S. publicly accuses China of supplying lethal aid to Russia in a 92-day window." This aligns with rare-event status and four-year non-escalation pattern.
4. **Key evidence:**
   - Four-year pattern: zero accusations despite continuous intelligence
   - Jan 28-29 "test moment": U.S. silent despite new reporting
   - High diplomatic cost: peer-competitor status unlike Iran precedent
   - 92-day window: sufficient for unlikely policy shift
   - Campbell Sep 2024: strongest statement still avoided "lethal aid" label
5. **Blind spot:** Major battlefield escalation (e.g., Chinese personnel casualties in Ukraine, direct PLA involvement, or captured intact Chinese weapons systems) could force immediate U.S. response. This could raise probability to 15-25%.
6. **Status quo:** Strong status quo bias favors continued restraint. Four years of non-escalation suggests institutional inertia. 92-day timeframe is short for major policy reversal absent crisis trigger.

Probability: 3%
