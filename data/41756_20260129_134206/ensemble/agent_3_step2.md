Analysis:
We are evaluating whether, before May 1, 2026, the U.S. government will make a public accusation—by a U.S. official—that China supplied lethal military aid (ammunition, missiles, armed drones, tanks, fighter jets, etc.) to Russia in its war against Ukraine. The resolution requires that the accusation be specific about the type of lethal aid and include corroborating detail (e.g., specifying items and providing evidence).

(a) Source analysis:
• Atlantic Council (October 23, 2025): Reports that Treasury Secretary Bessent expressed concern over Chinese drone components with a promise to release photo evidence; this shows a warning about dual-use components rather than a formal accusation about lethal aid. The source is a respected think‐tank analysis, mixing factual citations with opinion.
• Business Insider (September 11, 2024): Reports that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell made strong statements, saying China’s support is “not dual‐use” but “substantial,” with language implying “direct” lethal aid. However, even this account refers to “component pieces” rather than complete weapon systems as defined in the resolution. The report is from a well‐known outlet but remains ambiguous on meeting the resolution criteria.
• Asknews Articles (January 2026 batch): Multiple news pieces report that Chinese officials rebut allegations that they supplied components (such as those used in Russian “Oreshnik” missiles) and that warnings have been issued. None confirm that U.S. officials have formally and publicly accused China with the specific detail required (i.e., listing actual lethal items with corroboration).
• Additional sources (SCMP, Global Times, Al Jazeera, etc.): Do not report on any U.S. formal accusation. Instead, they document U.S. warnings, Chinese denials, and discussions of disputed “dual-use” items.
The overall quality is high for systematic official documentation (e.g., the USCC Timeline note) and multiple reputable outlets, all indicating that over the past three years the U.S. has not crossed from cautionary warnings, focusing mostly on components of ambiguous lethality, to a clear, formal accusation that meets the strict resolution criteria.

(b) Evidence analysis:
• Strong evidence: The consistent historical pattern over 2022–2026 where U.S. officials have expressed concerns over Chinese dual-use components but have refrained from issuing a detailed public accusation citing specific lethal arms. (High predictive power.)
• Moderate evidence: The Business Insider account of Campbell’s remarks suggests a push toward more direct language; however, these remarks refer to aiding the Russian war machine with “component pieces” rather than complete systems like fighter jets or tanks.
• Weak evidence: Anecdotal and opinion articles, including various January 2026 media reports, restate Chinese denials and refer to intelligence involving parts of the production chain; none show that a shift into a formal U.S. public accusation has actually occurred or is imminent.
Overall, the evidence points strongly toward diplomatic restraint given the high stakes in U.S.–China relations and the requirement that the accusation meet precise criteria.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
Our prediction timeframe is from today, January 29, 2026, to May 1, 2026—a roughly 3‐month window. Historically, despite ongoing tensions and near‐misses over the past 3+ years, there has been no clear formal public accusation by a U.S. official publicly stating that China supplied lethal military aid as per the required definition. If the window were doubled (i.e., 6 months), there might be slightly more chance if conditions change dramatically; if it were halved (i.e., 1.5 months), the likelihood would further diminish given the inertia in diplomatic strategy.

(d) Justification:
Key factors shifting our base rate include:
1. A long-established diplomatic pattern where the U.S. has continuously framed its concerns in terms of dual-use components rather than overt “lethal” weapons supply that meets the resolution’s specifics.
2. Strategic considerations: A public accusation would represent a significant escalation, likely sparking a major diplomatic fallout with China. Thus, U.S. officials have displayed a clear institutional incentive to avoid such a statement.
3. The resolution’s requirement for specific detail on lethal aid (like naming missiles, tanks, etc.) has never been met—even in cases where warnings were issued, the language used has remained vague or limited to “components.”
4. Although there is mounting evidence and rising tensions (reflected in some January 2026 media reports), none have yet forced the U.S. hand to escalate to a fully detailed public accusation.
Given the long period (nearly 3.5 years so far) with zero qualifying accusations, our base rate for an event this quarter is extremely low—perhaps around 0–1.25% in an out-of-window annualization. Even with slight upward adjustments offered by political pressure and recent near-miss language, the overall probability remains in the low single digits.

Probability calibration:
We start with a base rate of virtually 0% from historical patterns. Adjustments for rising tension and potential unexpected shifts add an incremental 2–4 percentage points. Combining these factors leads to an inside-view probability of about 4% that before May 1, 2026, the U.S. will publicly accuse China, in the precise, detailed manner required by the resolution.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid (specific types with corroboration) to Russia before May 1, 2026?” Our analysis aligns exactly with this.
2. Base rate: Zero qualifying accusations over 3+ years → extremely low base rate.
3. Consistency: “4 out of 100 times, a U.S. public accusation meeting the resolution criteria occurs.” This is consistent with historical patterns.
4. Key evidence (in <20 words each):
   • Consistent U.S. warnings focus on dual-use components, not fully lethal systems.
   • High strategic costs deter the formal public accusation.
   • Business Insider’s Campbell comment does not meet full criteria.
5. Blind-spot: A sudden, unanticipated geopolitical shock (e.g., dramatic new intelligence or rapid escalation) might force an accusation, shifting odds upward.
6. Status quo: U.S. diplomatic behavior has changed little; a nudge toward status quo supports a low probability.

Probability: 4%
