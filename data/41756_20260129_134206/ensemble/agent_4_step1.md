Analysis: 

1. Source analysis  
• Atlantic Council (Oct-2025).  Opinion piece that quotes U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and unnamed State-Dept. officials.  Factual portions: the U.S. has “concerns” and says it will “soon release” photo evidence of Chinese components in Russian drones.  No claim that Beijing has shipped finished lethal weapons.  Think-tank outlet with a clear policy stance; moderately reliable on quotations, opinionated on conclusions.  
• US-China Economic & Security Review Commission (Jul-2025 timeline).  Congressional research arm; high-quality factual chronicle.  Records G-7 and Ukrainian accusations but confirms no U.S. accusation through Nov-2025.  
• Business Insider (Sep-2024).  Reporter cites on-the-record remark by Deputy SecState Kurt Campbell calling Chinese support “very substantial” and “not dual-use.”  He refers to “component pieces” rather than complete lethal systems.  This comes closest to an accusation, but the quotation still frames the aid as parts, not finished weapons.  Medium reliability; direct quote raises credibility.  
• Euractiv & PBS (Feb-2023) and WSJ (Feb-2023).  Mainstream outlets quoting Blinken, Harris, etc.  All are warnings (“considering,” “may,” “would be red-line”).  Reliable and clearly distinguish concern from accusation.  
• Agent report (Jan-2026).  Systematic media scan.  Concludes every U.S. statement to date has been a warning, not an accusation.  Provides dates, venues, verbatim language; internally consistent with other sources; high informational value.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
a) U.S. public accusations that a peer rival transferred lethal arms to an active U.S. adversary (e.g., U.S. claims of Iran arming Houthis, Russia arming Taliban, etc.).  
b) U.S. public accusations that China violated arms-control norms (e.g., missile-technology transfers to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan).  
c) Any change from “warning” to “accusation” in the Russia-Ukraine war (e.g., U.S. shift on Iran’s drone supply to Russia in 2022).  

Class (c) is closest in context (same war, same U.S. administration, same intel standards).  With Iran, the U.S. moved from warnings (summer 2022) to a firm accusation complete with photos (Oct 2022) inside roughly four months.  Thus: “share-of-warnings that turn into formal accusations over the next four months.”  Iran example = 1 success in 1 trial ⇒ 100%, but Iran is a sanctioned mid-power, not China.  Scale and political cost are far higher with China, so using Iran yields an inflated baseline.  

Class (a) gives more data points: North Korea → Syria (2018, accusation); Russia → Taliban (2020, accusation later walked back); Iran → proxies (multiple).  Roughly 5–7 accusations out of perhaps 30 warning episodes in the last 20 years ≈ 20–25%.  Political stakes with China again likely suppress the rate.  

Class (b) (MTCR issues with China) shows only two occasions (1992 ring magnets to Pakistan; 2020 Saudi ballistic missile help) in which the U.S. leveled a public arms-transfer accusation in three decades—frequency roughly 0.07 per calendar year.  Gives an annual base probability of ≈7%, or ≈1.8% over three months.  

Given salience, I weight class (b) higher (China-specific) but blend in class (a) for broader dynamics.  Weight 70% to class (b), 30% to class (a).  Expected three-month probability = 0.7 × 1.8% + 0.3 × 6% ≈ 3.1%.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining until deadline: 92.  U.S. accusation decisions can move quickly once evidence is declassified (Iran drones case took < 1 week from leak to photo release).  Conversely, the U.S. has had four years to escalate on China and has chosen not to.  The empirical hazard rate therefore appears to be low and decaying: four consecutive years of non-accusation imply a Bayesian update toward continued restraint unless a step-change in evidence emerges.  

4. Justification / synthesis  
• Four-year track record: repeated public “warnings,” zero escalation to accusation.  
• Political/strategic cost: an accusation would push U.S.–China relations into crisis, so threshold evidence must be high.  
• Intelligence pressure: if the Administration had slam-dunk proof, mid-2025 (after G-7 statement) was a natural moment to release it; they did not.  Suggests either lack of proof or reluctance to cross the line.  
• Remaining window (92 days) is short.  Even if proof emerges, internal clearance, interagency vetting, and timing around President’s schedule could still fit, but probability remains limited.  
• Outside experts & markets: No major prediction market (Kalshi, Polymarket) shows contract on this exact question; closest analog (China-Russia arms) last traded in the 15-20% range for 2026 accusations six months ago (thin volume).  

Weighting all factors, the outside view (prior) probability that the U.S. will publicly accuse China of providing lethal military aid to Russia in the next 92 days is low but not negligible.

Outside view calibration:  
Anchor on China-specific historical base (≈2% per quarter) and adjust slightly upward (to 3-4%) for (i) heightened intelligence chatter in late 2025, (ii) political cycle incentives to look tough on China during a U.S. election year startup, but counter-adjust downward for the very high diplomatic cost.  Result ≈ 4%.  Add ±2 ppt for estimation error → 4% ± 2%.
