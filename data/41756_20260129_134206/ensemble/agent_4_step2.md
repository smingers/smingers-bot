Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first – only factual elements kept):

1. Asknews compilation, 28-29 Jan 2026 – Mainly non-US media (Telegraph, ISW, Focus, NV, T-online, etc.) repeating claims that Chinese CNC machines, drone parts and missile tooling are found in Russia. Quality: mixed (some professional outlets, some tabloids). No U-S-government statement => indirect evidence only.

2. RFI, 27 Jan 2026 – Report on Sino-Russian defence-minister call. Repeats “Western governments have accused…”, but cites no new U-S statement. Reliable public broadcaster; still only background.

3. The Hill, 13 Jan 2026 – U-S deputy UN ambassador condemns Russian missile launch; China not mentioned. Irrelevant for criterion.

4. Atlantic Council blog, 23 Oct 2025 – Quotes Treasury Secretary Bessent promising forthcoming photo evidence that Chinese drone components reach Russia; specifies ≥80 % of sanctioned dual-use items from China. Good think-tank quality, but still “concern”, not accusation of lethal aid.

5. G-7 FM statement (11–13 Nov 2025, via several outlets) – Says China supplies “weapons and dual-use goods”, but wording is collective, unspecific, and not accompanied by corroborating detail. Because the forecast requires a U-S-government accusation that includes the type of lethal aid plus some detail, this still falls short.

6. Business Insider / FT, 11 Sep 2024 – Kurt Campbell said China is giving “very substantial” support, “not dual-use”, but offered no concrete system nor proof. Close, but again fails the resolution bar.

Overall: to date no public U-S accusation meets the question’s threshold.

(b) Evidence analysis (weights refer to likelihood of an accusation appearing in the next 3 months)

Strong evidence pushing TOWARD a “Yes”
• Structural: Russia’s war effort is increasingly dependent on Chinese supply (multiple independent analytic sources). – structural, hard to reverse → Strong.
• Political: bipartisan China-hawk atmosphere in Washington, intensified under President Trump; Congress pressing for tougher stance. – structural/political → Moderate-Strong.
• Pre-positioned promise by Treasury Secretary (Oct 2025) to publish photographic evidence. If released, an accusation would likely accompany it. – Moderate.

Strong evidence pushing TOWARD a “No”
• Historical pattern 2022-Jan 2026: 0/≈25 major public warnings have crossed the accusation threshold despite steady rumours and pressure. – Strong.
• Intelligence-sharing norm: US often prefers sanctions & quiet diplomacy over public intel releases when evidence is partly signal-sensitive (e.g., Iran–Yemen, NK–Russia precedents). – Moderate-Strong.
• Only 93 days remain; lead-time for declassifying imagery, inter-agency clearance, and NSC deliberation can exceed two months. – Moderate.

Weak / noise
• European or Ukrainian officials issuing their own accusations (weak unless mirrored by US).
• Alleged battlefield finds of Chinese ordnance (unverified chains of custody).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days until deadline: 93 (~3 months).  If the window were doubled to six months I would raise probability by ~5-7 ppt (more time for evidence build-up and policy process).  If halved to 6-7 weeks I would drop probability to ~10 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside view baseline (historical frequency since Feb 2022): ≈0/4 years → 12 %.

Adjust upward:
+4 ppt  Growing tangible evidence (CNC machines, Type-63 rockets) that could be packaged as “smoking gun”.
+3 ppt  Trump administration & Congress signalling harder line on China in 2026 mid-term cycle.
+3 ppt  Bessent’s announced intention to publish photos (signals at least some material is already held).

Adjust downward:
-2 ppt  Short procedural window for declassification and diplomatic calculus (avoid driving Beijing closer to Moscow/Iran).
Net shift +8 ppt → 20 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 20 out of 100 times in comparable situations the US would publicly accuse China with the specificity required before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – Will US Gov, by 1 May 2026, name specific Chinese lethal aid to Russia with corroborating detail?  
2. Base rate: 12 %.  
3. Consistency: “20 of 100 times, US issues such an accusation.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) 0 accusations in 4 years despite repeated rumours.  
   b) Oct 2025 Bessent promise of photo proof.  
   c) Surge in Chinese machinery & drone-part finds Jan 2026.  
   d) Political appetite in Washington to confront Beijing.  
5. Blind spot: A dramatic single event (e.g., downed Chinese-made strike drone clearly labelled) producing undeniable proof and forcing rapid US statement. Would push probability much higher.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – pattern of warnings without accusation still dominant.

Probability: 20%
