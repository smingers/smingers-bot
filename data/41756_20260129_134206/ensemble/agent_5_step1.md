Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Atlantic Council (Oct 23 2025)  
   • Factual nuggets: Treasury Sec. Bessent said Chinese components were found in Russian drones; promise of forthcoming “photo evidence.”  
   • Opinion: Author calls China’s support “integral.”  
   • Quality: Atlantic Council is a respected Western think-tank but the piece is an op-ed.  Factual quotations from named U.S. officials are reliable; the author’s interpretation is not a government accusation that meets the question’s bar.

2. U.S.–China Economic & Security Review Commission time-line (USCC, Jul 18 2025)  
   • Factual: Logs all official PRC and third-party statements through Nov 30 2025; explicitly notes an absence of any U.S. accusation of lethal aid.  
   • Quality: Congressional research arm with a reputation for meticulous sourcing; high reliability.

3. Business Insider (Sep 11 2024)  
   • Factual: Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said China was providing “very substantial” support, “not dual-use,” to Russia.  
   • Ambiguity: Campbell named “component pieces,” but did not specify complete lethal systems.  
   • Quality: Mainstream outlet citing an on-the-record senior official; useful but not definitive under the question’s criterion that the accusation must list specific lethal items with corroborating detail.

4. Euractiv (Feb 22 2023) & 5. PBS (Feb 19 2023) & 6. Wall Street Journal (Feb 19 2023)  
   • All three record high-level U.S. warnings that China was “considering” lethal transfers.  No claim that transfers had occurred.  
   • Quality: Major news organisations quoting cabinet officials; reliable for what was actually said.

7. Agent report (29 Jan 2026)  
   • Exhaustive sweep of public U.S. statements 2022-2026; concludes every remark to date has been a warning, not an accusation.  
   • Quality: Secondary synthesis but internally consistent with primary sources above.

Conclusion from sources: To date there is no public U.S. accusation that satisfies the resolution wording (specific lethal item + corroborating detail).  All statements are either deterrent warnings or relate to dual-use parts.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Potential classes considered:  
1. U.S. public accusations that Iran/North Korea supplied lethal weapons to belligerents (e.g., Iran → Houthis/Hezbollah; DPRK → Russia 2023).  
2. U.S. public accusations that a peer competitor (US-China-Russia tier) supplied lethal arms to a U.S. adversary.  The only close analogue in the last 30 years is U.S. accusation that Russia supplied missiles/drones to Iran-allied forces or that China supplied weapons to Sudan (2000s).  
3. Months-since-warning to first public accusation in past proxy wars (e.g., Iran drones to Russia: first U.S. warning Apr 2022, public accusation Jul 2022 → ~3 months).

Suitability: Class 2 is the closest—accusing a nuclear-armed peer of arming another U.S. adversary is rare, politically costly, and evidence threshold is high.  Frequency of such events over three-month windows in the 21st century is extremely low (<5%).  We therefore use Class 2 as the baseline.

(c) Time-frame analysis  

• Time until deadline: 29 Jan → 01 May 2026 = 93 days.  
• Empirical hazard: Two-year period since the first U.S. warnings (Feb 2023) = ~24 months with zero qualifying accusations.  Naïvely, monthly hazard h ≈ 0/24 = 0; but to avoid zero-probability, assume a thin but non-zero prior.  
• Comparable episodes (Iran→Russia, DPRK→Russia): once officials had strong intelligence, accusations followed within 2-4 months.  The fact that 23 months have passed without such an accusation against China suggests either (a) the evidence threshold not met, or (b) political decision not to escalate.

(d) Justification for outside-view probability  

1. Base rate (reference class): Peer-on-peer lethal-aid accusations are rare—roughly one every 10-15 years.  Over any given 3-month window, baseline ≈ 2%.  
2. Adjustment upward:  
   • Recent uptick in U.S. rhetoric (Treasury Sec. promise of photos, Oct 2025).  Indicates the administration believes it has some evidence.  +4 ppt.  
   • G7 collectively accused China of weapons transfers (Nov 2025).  Multilateral statement reduces political cost for unilateral U.S. move.  +3 ppt.  
3. Adjustment downward:  
   • The accusation must include “specific lethal aid” and “corroborating detail.”  Campbell’s 2024 remark shows the bar is high and still unmet 16 months later.  −2 ppt.  
   • Only 93 days remain.  Even if evidence exists, diplomatic incentives (ongoing climate talks, Taiwan crisis management) may counsel waiting for a bigger reveal (e.g., at the July 2026 NATO summit), i.e., after this question closes.  −3 ppt.

Net outside-view probability ≈ 2 % + 4 % + 3 % – 2 % – 3 % = 4 %.

Outside view calibration:
• The figure is anchored to the low historical base rate of U.S. peer-level arms accusations, then modestly raised to reflect increasingly pointed multilateral rhetoric and hints of evidence.  
• 4 % implies odds of 1:24—low but not impossible, matching the observed rarity.  
• Sensitivity test: even if we doubled the monthly hazard because of the October-November 2025 signals, the cumulative chance over 3 months would still be <10 %.  Therefore 4 % is appropriately conservative yet non-zero.

Outside View Prediction:
4 % (±1 %) chance that, before 1 May 2026, the United States will publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia.
