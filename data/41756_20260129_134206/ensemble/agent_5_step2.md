Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological highlights, factual vs opinion, quality)

1. Business Insider – 11 Sep 2024  
   • FACT: Dep. Sec. State Kurt Campbell said China is giving “very substantial” non-dual-use “component pieces” to Russia.  
   • OPINION: ISW comment on China’s “balancing act”.  
   • Quality: Named, on-the-record senior official → high, but no specific lethal system named.

2. Atlantic Council blog – 23 Oct 2025  
   • FACT: Treasury Sec. Bessent promised to publish photos showing Chinese drone parts in Russia.  
   • OPINION: Author calls Chinese help “integral”.  
   • Quality: Think-tank op-ed quoting cabinet official → moderate–high.

3. G7 statement (covered by several outlets) – 13 Nov 2025  
   • FACT: G7 ministers alleged China supplies weapons & dual-use goods to Russia.  
   • Quality: Multilateral official communiqué → high, yet not a U.S.-only accusation and no specific item list.

4. Type-63 launcher story & Chinese denial – 21 Nov 2025 (RFI, Izvestia)  
   • FACT: Ukraine said it destroyed a Chinese-made rocket launcher used by Russia; U.S. did not comment.  
   • Quality: Single-source Ukrainian claim, no U.S. corroboration → weak for our resolution.

5. Telegraph/ISW “Oreshnik” package – 28 Jan 2026 (+ many reprints)  
   • FACT: ISW says Chinese CNC machines enable Russian hypersonic missile output; Telegraph says China “supplied… components”.  
   • OPINION: Focus/Telegraph language “deadly threat”.  
   • Quality: Investigative media & respected think-tank → moderate, but still no U.S. government statement.

6. U.S. statements Jan 2026 – search sweep (Asknews)  
   • FACT: No January 2026 U.S. official quoted accusing China of lethal aid; only Chinese denials noted.  
   • Quality: Negative evidence; suggests no accusation yet.

(b) Evidence weighting against the resolution

Strong evidence (toward “No”)  
• 23 months of public U.S. warnings without crossing the accusation threshold (structural pattern).  
• Trump administration currently prioritises Russia-Ukraine peace talks; blaming China risks complicating that diplomacy.

Moderate evidence (toward “Yes”)  
• Treasury Sec. promise of photo evidence (Oct 2025) indicates the U.S. may already hold proof.  
• G7 collective charge lowers diplomatic cost for a unilateral U.S. reveal.  
• ISW & Telegraph January 2026 reports keep issue in headlines, raising pressure on Washington.

Weak evidence  
• Ukrainian and Finnish claims of Chinese weapons/components—anecdotal, no U.S. confirmation.  
• Media speculation that photographs will be released “soon”.

Net: strong anti-resolution evidence outweighs moderate pro-resolution evidence.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days remaining: 93 (≈3 months).  
If the window were doubled to 6 months I would raise the probability by ~50 % relative (e.g., from 8 % → 12 %).  
If halved to 45 days I would cut it roughly in half (8 % → 4 %), reflecting low but rising monthly hazard.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline (peer-on-peer lethal-aid accusations) = 4 %.  
Upside adjustments  
+2 pp U.S. cabinet official already hinted at imminent evidence (Bessent).  
+2 pp G7 precedent & mounting allied pressure.  
Downside adjustments  
-1 pp 93-day horizon is short; bureaucratic/de-classification lag is real.  
-1 pp Trump administration signalling (focus on Russia, Iran, trade) suggests reluctance to open an additional China front now.

Final inside-view probability: 4 % + 2 + 2 – 1 – 1 = 6 - 8 %.  
I choose 8 % to reflect the slight momentum of January media attention and the possibility that the promised photos surface before 1 May.

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 8 times in 100 similar three-month windows the U.S. would make a qualifying public accusation against China.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will U.S. publicly accuse China of delivering specific lethal weapons to Russia before 1 May 2026?  
2. Base rate used: 4 % over 3 months.  
3. Consistency: “In 8 out of 100 trials the accusation occurs.”  
4. Key evidence: 
   • 23 months of non-accusatory warnings.  
   • Oct 2025 Bessent promise of photos.  
   • Nov 2025 G7 arms allegation.  
   • Jan 2026 ISW/Telegraph missile-component report.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden battlefield find (e.g., downed Chinese-made missile) forces immediate U.S. briefing; would swing odds sharply upward.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; outcome remains “No” barring new smoking-gun.

Probability: 8%
