Analysis:
The key to resolving the question is whether, since the start of 2026, any U-S government body or senior official has moved from “warning China not to” or “expressing concern” to a direct, detailed allegation that Beijing has actually shipped specific lethal items (e.g., artillery shells, missiles, drones) to Russia.  The most likely sources would be:
• State Department/DOD press briefings or sanctions notices  
• Remarks by the President, Secretary of State, Defense Secretary, or National Security Council spokesperson  
• Declassified intelligence releases to the press or Congress  

So the immediate research need is to scan late-2025 through January-2026 coverage, Congressional testimony, and official press conferences for any explicit U-S statement saying China has supplied such matériel.  Key terms are “accuses,” “providing weapons,” “lethal aid,” plus “artillery,” “drones,” etc., together with “China” and “Russia.”  Because generic “concerns,” “fears,” or “could do so” language would not satisfy the resolution criteria, we must locate news citing a concrete U-S allegation that China already transferred arms.
