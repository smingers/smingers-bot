The forecasting question is:
Before May 1, 2026, will the United States publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia?

Question background:
Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations, led by the United States, have warned China against providing lethal military aid to Russia. While China has provided significant economic and diplomatic support to Moscow, it has so far officially refrained from supplying weaponry. In a November 2025 (meeting)[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-president-xi-meets-with-russias-prime-minister-mishustin-2025-11-04/], China and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to "defend shared security interests," and China faces increasing US pressure over its trade and technology sectors. The U.S. Department of Defense 2025 (Annual Report To Congress)[https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/23/2003849070/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-TO-CONGRESS-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2025.PDF] assessed that China "has stopped short of providing Russia with lethal aid." A decision by Beijing to supply arms would represent a major escalation.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as "Yes" if before May 1, 2026, the government of the United States publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of supplying Russia with lethal military aid for use in its war against Ukraine. 'Lethal military aid' includes items such as ammunition, missiles, armed drones, tanks, and fighter jets. It does not include non-lethal equipment like uniforms, body armor, or general-purpose vehicles. Any accusation must be specific about the type of lethal aid and provide some corroborating detail, not just general accusations or expressions of concern.
