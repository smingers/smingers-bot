You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Before May 1, 2026, will the United States publicly accuse China of supplying lethal military aid to Russia?

Question background:
Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations, led by the United States, have warned China against providing lethal military aid to Russia. While China has provided significant economic and diplomatic support to Moscow, it has so far officially refrained from supplying weaponry. In a November 2025 (meeting)[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-president-xi-meets-with-russias-prime-minister-mishustin-2025-11-04/], China and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to "defend shared security interests," and China faces increasing US pressure over its trade and technology sectors. The U.S. Department of Defense 2025 (Annual Report To Congress)[https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/23/2003849070/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-TO-CONGRESS-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2025.PDF] assessed that China "has stopped short of providing Russia with lethal aid." A decision by Beijing to supply arms would represent a major escalation.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as "Yes" if before May 1, 2026, the government of the United States publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of supplying Russia with lethal military aid for use in its war against Ukraine. 'Lethal military aid' includes items such as ammunition, missiles, armed drones, tanks, and fighter jets. It does not include non-lethal equipment like uniforms, body armor, or general-purpose vehicles. Any accusation must be specific about the type of lethal aid and provide some corroborating detail, not just general accusations or expressions of concern.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
