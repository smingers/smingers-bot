The representative dismissed accusations of supporting Russia's war as 'shifting responsibility onto China.' The claims originated from an article published by The Telegraph on January 28, 2026, which alleged that China supplied Russia with specialized machinery, tools, and high-tech equipment used in the production of Oreshnik missiles and Shahed drones. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on January 28, 2026, that these Chinese deliveries enabled Moscow to enhance and expand the production of strike drones for attacks on Ukrainian military logistics in near and middle rear areas.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:08 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/geopolitics/rakety-oreshnik-kitay-oproverg-informaciyu-o-podderzhke-rossiyskogo-proizvodstva-50579478.html)\n\n**China Denies Allegations of Supplying Components for Russian 'Oreshnik' Missiles**\nChina strongly rejected Western media reports alleging that Chinese components were supplied to Russia for the production of the 'Oreshnik' ballistic missile.

Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, MFA spokesperson Gao Jiakun emphasized China's 'consistent and clear' position on the so-called 'Ukrainian crisis,' stating, 'China does not fuel the fire and does not exploit this conflict for gain.' He dismissed the allegations as an attempt to shift responsibility for Russian aggression onto a third party and said Beijing 'categorically rejects' such approaches. Officially, China maintains neutrality in the war and provides no direct military aid to either Ukraine or Russia. Earlier reports indicated that China helped Russia circumvent sanctions to produce the hypersonic nuclear 'Oreshnik' missile, citing the discovery of Chinese computer numerical control (CNC) lathes at the Votkinsk plant, which also manufactures 'Iskander-M' and 'Topol-M' missiles. These machines enabled Russia to increase production of precision weaponry. Despite this, China has cautiously approached military support for Russia since the full-scale invasion, with Ukrainian and European officials noting that China declined some Russian requests. In early 2023, China considered sending 122-mm and 152-mm shells to Russia, but no large-scale delivery occurred. In 2023, Ukrainian forces discovered Chinese-made mortar shells near Melitopol in southern Ukraine, though it remains unclear whether they were transferred directly from China or via third countries.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:06 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/svit/kitay-otvetil-na-obvinenie-v-postavke-detaley-dlya-rossiyskih-raket-oreshnik-3010598.html)\n\n**China Responds to Allegations of Supplying Components for Russian 'Oreshnik' Missiles**\nChina strongly rejected Western media reports alleging that Chinese components were supplied to Russia for the production of the 'Oreshnik' ballistic missile.

He explicitly rejected attempts to hold China responsible, saying, 'China's position is consistent and clear: we are not fueling the fire, not taking advantage of the situation, and certainly not accepting the shifting of responsibility.'

Meanwhile, multiple balloons from Belarus entered Polish airspace, likely carried by wind, prompting temporary flight restrictions in eastern Poland; Poland and the EU accuse Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating migrant flows to pressure the West. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for Europe to embrace power politics, urging it to become a true power to protect its values. The Kremlin unexpectedly invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Moscow, a move seen as potentially strategic. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that China remains a critical supplier of weapons to Russia, including Shahed drones and Oreshnik missiles, with $10.3 billion in technology exports to Russia in an unspecified period. Greenpeace criticized France for continuing to import enriched uranium from Russia despite the war, highlighting reliance on Rosatom, which it calls a criminal war enterprise. In Germany, calls for tactical nuclear weapons resurfaced, with military and political figures arguing that conventional arms are insufficient to deter Putin, though others like Joschka Fischer oppose the idea on legal grounds. The German government plans to acquire military-critical pipeline assets from Sunoco, a US firm linked to Donald Trump, to ensure military fuel supply. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig proposed harsher penalties for 'disposable agents' linked to foreign powers, citing sabotage cases tied to Russia. In Ukraine, three people were killed in Russian drone attacks in Zaporizhzhia, and Zelenskyy warned of an impending large-scale Russian offensive. Merz reaffirmed Germany's support for Ukraine, including a \u20ac160 million winter aid package and delivery of energy infrastructure, defense systems, and vehicles. The US stated that territorial disputes in Donbas are the last unresolved issue in peace talks, with no involvement from former Trump envoys. A Russian court sentenced a teenager to seven years for allegedly preparing a terrorist attack on a defense ministry building, though the case lacks independent verification. Merz reiterated that Germany is not a mediator in the conflict, emphasizing that Ukraine and Russia must negotiate directly. The US also confirmed that the only open issue in peace talks is territorial control in eastern Ukraine. In Kharkiv, Russian drones set a passenger train on fire, with over 100 people on board, including soldiers, prompting strong condemnation from Zelenskyy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:01 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/10-50-Kallas-Russland-meint-es-nicht-ernst-mit-dem-Frieden-article23143824.html)\n\n**China Turns Putin's Hypersonic Missiles into Deadly Threat**\nChina has supplied Russia with critical components and technologies essential for its advanced hypersonic missiles, according to a 'Telegraph' analysis. The Russian hypersonic missile Oreshnik, which has been repeatedly deployed by the Kremlin against targets in Ukraine\u2014including an attack on Lviv in early January, located just kilometers from the Polish border\u2014can release up to six warheads during flight to strike multiple targets. The analysis reveals that China has exported machinery valued at over $3 billion to Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, along with microchips, ball bearings, and other precision technology used in weapons systems and fighter jets. A source cited by 'Focus' stated, 'Without China's support, Russia would have difficulty sustaining this war.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 01:27 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/erst-china-verwandelt-putins-hyperschallraketen-in-toedliche-bedrohung_906120df-c91b-43fd-820f-0709419059b2.html?x-bf-placeholder=true)\n\n**A New Turn in the SVO: Russia's Strategic Advantage Amid Escalating Middle East Tensions**\nAccording to insider sources, a major escalation is looming in the Middle East, where a confrontation between the United States and Iran\u2014now involving China\u2014could escalate into a full-scale conflict. This crisis, the sources claim, may fundamentally alter the context of Russia's Special Military Operation (SVO) in Ukraine. In early January 2026, the U.S. and Israel attempted to provoke a coup in Iran, turning economic protests into street clashes; although Donald Trump withdrew his threats, a U.S. aircraft carrier group remains near Iranian waters. China has openly entered the conflict, with 16 Chinese super-heavy military aircraft arriving in Tehran within 48 hours, carrying supplies to strengthen Iran\u2019s defense\u2014seen as a sign of a new phase in great power competition. Sources suggest this conflict benefits Russia by diverting critical U.S. resources. Moscow, though officially restrained, is expected to support allied Iran, especially given China\u2019s backing\u2014described as 'the world\u2019s largest army.' Insiders predict a U.S. strike on Iran could occur in the coming weeks, potentially triggering a new phase in Ukraine, with Russia leveraging support from its allies. Russia also holds unique military advantages, including combat-tested hypersonic weapons, the 'Burevestnik' nuclear missile, deep-sea vehicles, and space systems. When these capabilities are deployed at maximum strength in Ukraine, the situation could overshadow even the Iran conflict. The outcome of the Ukrainian war, according to the sources, will determine Russia\u2019s ability to project power globally and intimidate the U.S.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:03 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/grjadjot-novyj-povorot-svo-ukraine-nikto-i-ne-vspomnit-za-rossiju-vystupit-samaja-bolshaja-armija-v-mire_1536412)\n\n**Zelensky demands to meet Putin as casualties near 2m in biggest losses since WW2**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a face-to-face meeting to negotiate a peace deal, as the war enters its fourth year. The conflict has resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, with Russia suffering approximately 1.2 million casualties (killed, wounded, or missing) and Ukraine reporting over 140,000 casualties, including around 46,000 Ukrainian troops lost since the invasion began on February 24, 2022. Despite Russia\u2019s territorial gains in the Donbas region and control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\u2014Europe\u2019s largest\u2014Ukraine refuses to cede either. Trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi in January 2026, involving the US, Ukraine, and Russia, ended without breakthroughs, though American officials suggested a potential summit could follow. Kyiv\u2019s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stated that only direct leadership talks can resolve the core issues. Recent Russian attacks have targeted civilians, including a deadly drone strike on a train in Kharkiv that killed at least four and a bombardment of Kyiv that left a four-year-old orphaned. Zelensky condemned the attacks as 'an act of terrorism.' Additionally, reports indicate Russia is collaborating with China to develop nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles, using Chinese-made machinery to produce new warheads. Both sides continue to downplay casualty figures, with Russia no longer publishing its death toll since September 2022.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:41 AM\nSource:[The Irish Sun](https://www.thesun.ie/news/16451960/zelensky-demands-putin-face-to-face-peace-talks/)\n\n**'We Are Not Pouring Oil on the Fire': China Denies Supporting Russia's Oreshnik Production**\nChina has denied allegations of supporting Russia's production of the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missiles and Shahed drones, stating that its position on the Ukrainian crisis is 'consistent and clear': 'We are not pouring oil on the fire and are not using this conflict to gain advantage,' according to a Chinese government representative.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that China remains a critical supplier of weapons to Russia, including Shahed drones and Oreshnik missiles, with $10.3 billion in technology exports to Russia in an unspecified period. Greenpeace criticized France for continuing to import enriched uranium from Russia despite the war, highlighting reliance on Rosatom, which it calls a criminal war enterprise. In Germany, calls for tactical nuclear weapons resurfaced, with military and political figures arguing that conventional arms are insufficient to deter Putin, though others like Joschka Fischer oppose the idea on legal grounds. The German government plans to acquire military-critical pipeline assets from Sunoco, a US firm linked to Donald Trump, to ensure military fuel supply. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig proposed harsher penalties for 'disposable agents' linked to foreign powers, citing sabotage cases tied to Russia. In Ukraine, three people were killed in Russian drone attacks in Zaporizhzhia, and Zelenskyy warned of an impending large-scale Russian offensive. Merz reaffirmed Germany's support for Ukraine, including a \u20ac160 million winter aid package and delivery of energy infrastructure, defense systems, and vehicles. The US stated that territorial disputes in Donbas are the last unresolved issue in peace talks, with no involvement from former Trump envoys. A Russian court sentenced a teenager to seven years for allegedly preparing a terrorist attack on a defense ministry building, though the case lacks independent verification. Merz reiterated that Germany is not a mediator in the conflict, emphasizing that Ukraine and Russia must negotiate directly. The US also confirmed that the only open issue in peace talks is territorial control in eastern Ukraine. In Kharkiv, Russian drones set a passenger train on fire, with over 100 people on board, including soldiers, prompting strong condemnation from Zelenskyy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:01 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/10-50-Kallas-Russland-meint-es-nicht-ernst-mit-dem-Frieden-article23143824.html)\n\n**Ukraine War Live Updates: Lithuania Buys German Panzerbridges, Merz Backs Ukraine, Russia Accused of Escalation**\nLitauen has agreed to purchase twelve Leguan armored bridge-laying vehicles from German manufacturer KNDS Deutschland for approximately 210 million euros to strengthen its defense capabilities. The vehicles enable rapid crossing of natural and artificial obstacles, enhancing both Lithuanian and NATO's eastern flank security. Lithuania, bordering Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, views the war in Ukraine as a direct threat. The country is intensifying military buildup, including acquiring Leopard 2 tanks from Germany and hosting a permanent Bundeswehr armored brigade. In Germany, Chancellor Friedrich Merz reaffirmed support for Ukraine, pledging 160 million euros in a winter package for energy infrastructure and supplying air defense systems, drones, armored vehicles, and munitions. He emphasized that Europe must speak the language of power politics to assert itself. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that Russia does not take peace talks seriously, citing continued attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy grid and the use of military personnel without negotiation mandates. Meanwhile, Belarusian balloons entered Polish airspace, raising concerns over coordinated migrant pressure. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that China remains a key supplier of weapons to Russia, including Oreshnik missiles and Shahed long-range drones. Greenpeace criticized France for continuing to import uranium from Russia, calling it complicity in Russia\u2019s war effort. In Germany, calls for tactical nuclear weapons have resurfaced due to concerns over U.S. reliability and Russian aggression, though some officials oppose such a move. The German government plans to acquire military-relevant pipeline assets from Sunoco-owned TanQuid to secure defense infrastructure. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig proposed harsher penalties for 'disposable agents' linked to foreign powers, citing sabotage cases tied to Russia. In Ukraine, Russian drone strikes killed three in Zaporizhzhia and destroyed homes; President Zelenskyy warned of a major new offensive. The U.S. stated that territorial issues in Donetsk remain the last open point in peace talks. A Russian court sentenced a teenager to seven years for allegedly planning a terrorist attack on a defense ministry building, though the claims are unverified. Merz reiterated Germany\u2019s position: it is not a mediator in the conflict, and direct talks between Ukraine and Russia are essential.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:01 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/11-50-Litauen-beschafft-Panzerbruecken-von-deutschem-Hersteller-article23143824.html)\n\n**China Turns Putin's Hypersonic Missiles into Deadly Threat**\nChina has supplied Russia with critical components and technologies essential for its advanced hypersonic missiles, according to a 'Telegraph' analysis. The Russian hypersonic missile Oreshnik, which has been repeatedly deployed by the Kremlin against targets in Ukraine\u2014including an attack on Lviv in early January, located just kilometers from the Polish border\u2014can release up to six warheads during flight to strike multiple targets. The analysis reveals that China has exported machinery valued at over $3 billion to Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, along with microchips, ball bearings, and other precision technology used in weapons systems and fighter jets. A source cited by 'Focus' stated, 'Without China's support, Russia would have difficulty sustaining this war.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 01:27 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/erst-china-verwandelt-putins-hyperschallraketen-in-toedliche-bedrohung_906120df-c91b-43fd-820f-0709419059b2.html?x-bf-placeholder=true)\n\n**A New Turn in the SVO: Russia's Strategic Advantage Amid Escalating Middle East Tensions**\nAccording to insider sources, a major escalation is looming in the Middle East, where a confrontation between the United States and Iran\u2014now involving China\u2014could escalate into a full-scale conflict. This crisis, the sources claim, may fundamentally alter the context of Russia's Special Military Operation (SVO) in Ukraine. In early January 2026, the U.S. and Israel attempted to provoke a coup in Iran, turning economic protests into street clashes; although Donald Trump withdrew his threats, a U.S. aircraft carrier group remains near Iranian waters. China has openly entered the conflict, with 16 Chinese super-heavy military aircraft arriving in Tehran within 48 hours, carrying supplies to strengthen Iran\u2019s defense\u2014seen as a sign of a new phase in great power competition. Sources suggest this conflict benefits Russia by diverting critical U.S. resources. Moscow, though officially restrained, is expected to support allied Iran, especially given China\u2019s backing\u2014described as 'the world\u2019s largest army.' Insiders predict a U.S. strike on Iran could occur in the coming weeks, potentially triggering a new phase in Ukraine, with Russia leveraging support from its allies. Russia also holds unique military advantages, including combat-tested hypersonic weapons, the 'Burevestnik' nuclear missile, deep-sea vehicles, and space systems. When these capabilities are deployed at maximum strength in Ukraine, the situation could overshadow even the Iran conflict. The outcome of the Ukrainian war, according to the sources, will determine Russia\u2019s ability to project power globally and intimidate the U.S.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:03 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/grjadjot-novyj-povorot-svo-ukraine-nikto-i-ne-vspomnit-za-rossiju-vystupit-samaja-bolshaja-armija-v-mire_1536412)\n\n**Zelensky demands to meet Putin as casualties near 2m in biggest losses since WW2**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a face-to-face meeting to negotiate a peace deal, as the war enters its fourth year. The conflict has resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, with Russia suffering approximately 1.2 million casualties (killed, wounded, or missing) and Ukraine reporting over 140,000 casualties, including around 46,000 Ukrainian troops lost since the invasion began on February 24, 2022. Despite Russia\u2019s territorial gains in the Donbas region and control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\u2014Europe\u2019s largest\u2014Ukraine refuses to cede either. Trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi in January 2026, involving the US, Ukraine, and Russia, ended without breakthroughs, though American officials suggested a potential summit could follow. Kyiv\u2019s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stated that only direct leadership talks can resolve the core issues. Recent Russian attacks have targeted civilians, including a deadly drone strike on a train in Kharkiv that killed at least four and a bombardment of Kyiv that left a four-year-old orphaned. Zelensky condemned the attacks as 'an act of terrorism.' Additionally, reports indicate Russia is collaborating with China to develop nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles, using Chinese-made machinery to produce new warheads. Both sides continue to downplay casualty figures, with Russia no longer publishing its death toll since September 2022.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:41 AM\nSource:[The Irish Sun](https://www.thesun.ie/news/16451960/zelensky-demands-putin-face-to-face-peace-talks/)\n\n**China and Russia Strengthen Strategic Coordination Amid Ukraine War and Arctic Tensions**\nOn January 27, 2026, Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun held a video conference with Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, emphasizing the need for enhanced strategic cooperation between the two nations. Dong stated that China is willing to work with Russia to implement key consensus from the two heads of state, strengthen strategic coordination, deepen cooperation, improve communication mechanisms, and jointly enhance capabilities to address various risks and challenges, thereby contributing positive energy to global security and stability. The Chinese state media report did not mention the Ukraine conflict. Russia\u2019s defense ministry welcomed the steady development of the 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between the two countries. Belousov noted in a statement that the cases of Venezuela and Iran demonstrate the necessity for both defense departments to continuously assess the security situation and take appropriate measures. The call took place after recent direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in Abu Dhabi, which focused on a U.S.-proposed resolution to the war in Ukraine, which began in 2022. China has maintained a close partnership with Russia, consistently adopting a neutral stance on the war and never condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. Western governments have accused China of providing critical economic support to Russia, including military-related components for defense industry use, to sustain its war effort. Further consultations among Russia, Ukraine, and the United States are expected to continue in Abu Dhabi on January 28, 2026. Additionally, U.S. President Trump cited growing Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic as a strategic threat, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to control Greenland.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:24 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/20260127-%E4%B8%AD%E4%BF%84%E9%98%B2%E9%95%B7%E8%A6%96%E9%A0%BB%E9%80%9A%E8%A9%B1-%E4%BF%84%E6%96%B9-%E5%A7%94%E5%85%A7%E7%91%9E%E6%8B%89%E5%92%8C%E4%BC%8A%E6%9C%97%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%8B%E5%AD%90%E8%A1%A8%E6%98%8E%E4%BF%84%E4%B8%AD%E9%9C%80%E4%B8%8D%E6%96%B7%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E5%BD%A2%E5%8B%A2%E4%B8%A6%E6%8E%A1%E5%8F%96%E9%81%A9%E7%95%B6%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95)\n\n**US accuses Russia of 'dangerous and inexplicable escalation' of war in Ukraine as Trump seeks peace**\nThe United States accused Russia of a 'dangerous and inexplicable escalation' in its war in Ukraine during an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting on January 13, 2026. U.S. Deputy Ambassador Tammy Bruce condemned Russia\u2019s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile near Ukraine\u2019s border with NATO ally Poland, calling it a provocative act that risks expanding the conflict. She highlighted the staggering casualties and intensifying attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, including a large-scale drone and missile assault using hypersonic weapons. The attack occurred amid diplomatic progress toward a U.S.-led peace deal and as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled support for tough sanctions against Russia. Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia blamed Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the deadlock, threatening continued military action until Ukraine accepts 'realistic conditions.' Ukraine\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is now more vulnerable than at any point since 2022, with a slowing economy and declining oil revenues, and dismissed Moscow\u2019s image of strength as 'smoke and mirrors.' European leaders also denounced the Oreshnik strike as 'escalatory and unacceptable.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 12:16 AM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/us-russia-ukraine-war-escalation/)\n\n**China Denies Supplying Lethal Weapons Amid Reports of Chinese-Made Rockets in Ukraine War**\nUkraine reported destroying a Chinese-made Type 63 130mm self-propelled multiple rocket launcher used by Russian forces, prompting China's Foreign Ministry to respond on November 21, 2025. Spokesperson Mao Ning stated, 'I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. However, I must emphasize that China has never provided lethal weapons to any party involved in the conflict and strictly controls dual-use items.' The Type 63 rocket launcher, designed in 1963 and mass-produced for Chinese military use, has reportedly appeared on the battlefield despite Beijing\u2019s denial. Meanwhile, Finnish Defense Minister Harri Haakinen told AFP on November 19, 2025, that China-Russia cooperation 'has gone too far,' accusing Beijing of providing 'substantial funding' to Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Haakinen added that China is contributing military components, engaging in defense industry collaboration, and organizing large-scale joint military exercises in the Arctic, Antarctic, Indo-Pacific, and Europe. These claims were made during a Nordic defense ministers' meeting in Helsinki.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 03:30 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB/20251121-%E4%BF%84%E7%83%8F%E6%88%B0%E5%A0%B4%E7%8F%BE%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%88%B6%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8-%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%A8%B1%E6%9C%AA%E5%90%91%E4%BB%BB%E4%B8%80%E6%96%B9%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B%E8%87%B4%E5%91%BD%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8)\n\n**China Denies Allegations of Supplying Weapons to Ukraine Conflict Sides**\nOn November 21, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxing stated during a briefing that China has never supplied lethal weapons to any party involved in the conflict in Ukraine and strictly controls the export of dual-use goods.

Despite China's official neutrality and refusal to label either side as aggressor or victim, analysts note a significant increase in trade between China and Russia since the full-scale invasion began. In particular, Chinese exports of optical fiber cables and lithium-ion batteries to Russian drone manufacturers surged in summer 2025, enabling Moscow to enhance its drone production and operational effectiveness. These developments, according to experts, highlight a close economic and industrial partnership between Russian and Chinese producers that provides Russia with a strategic military advantage.

Alexandrov said, 'There is evidence that Russia and China have engaged in highly coordinated satellite reconnaissance over Ukrainian territory to further explore strategic strike targets,' and added, 'As we have seen in recent months, these targets may belong to foreign investors.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and local officials reported that in August 2025, Russian missiles struck a U.S.-owned electronics factory in western Ukraine, injuring 15 people.
