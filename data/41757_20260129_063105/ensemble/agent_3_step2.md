Analysis:
We’re asked to forecast whether the FDA will grant approval for zilebesiran for hypertension before May 1, 2026. Today is January 29, 2026, so we have about 92 days. The available sources include several high‐quality publications (American Heart Association, Pharmacy Times, FierceBiotech, Nature, and corporate press releases from Roche/Alnylam) reporting on clinical trial data and the progress of the Phase 2 and the beginning of the Phase 3 (ZENITH) trial. The factual details show that while earlier Phase 2 data (KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2) were promising in certain populations, Phase 2 KARDIA-3 results were mixed overall—with the subgroup of patients on diuretics showing a larger effect—but did not meet statistical significance in the overall population. Today’s key point is that the global Phase 3 CVOT (ZENITH), which is an event-driven trial enrolling ~11,000 patients, is just being initiated as of January 29, 2026. There is no record or disclosure that an NDA has been filed, and the company’s filings (FY-2023 10-K and subsequent agent reports) indicate that NDA timing is “to be determined” with an expectation for a multi-year process. Additionally, no expedited regulatory designations are apparent that would allow a 3-month review period. Thus, all strong evidence—structural requirements of a CVOT, the need for statistically significant clinical endpoints and lengthy FDA review timelines (6–10 months at minimum)—points to the approval being extremely unlikely within 92 days.

Probability calibration:
Given that our reference class for CVOT-based NDA submissions and approvals in hypertension almost always takes several years from the start of Phase 3, and that there is no secret fast-track or hidden NDA filing reported, the chance of FDA approval before May 1, 2026 is extraordinarily tiny. Even the most generous possibility—a hidden NDA filing plus an unprecedented FDA review completed in <3 months—is virtually unheard of. Our base rate, set by historical experience in similar situations, is essentially near 0%; hence we assign it a probability roughly around 0.1% (i.e., 1 in 1,000 odds).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Predict if the FDA will approve zilebesiran for hypertension before May 1, 2026 (within ~3 months) based on clinical and regulatory data.
2. Base rate: Historically, CVOTs and NDA processes in such settings require years—not days.
3. Consistency: “0.1 out of 100 times, FDA approval happens before May 1, 2026.” This is consistent with our multi-factor justification.
4. Key Evidence:
   • Phase 3 ZENITH trial just initiated today.
   • No NDA filed or expedited designation reported.
   • Historical CVOT processes in hypertension take 3–5 years.
5. Blind-spot: A hidden NDA or dramatic FDA policy change would undermine our forecast, but there is no indication for such an event.
6. Status quo: With the slow nature of regulatory science, a near-zero change toward a rapid review is most likely.

Probability: 0.1%
