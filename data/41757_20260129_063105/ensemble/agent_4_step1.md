Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. STAT, 30 Aug 2025 (Elaine Chen) – Independent journalism. Reports that the KARDIA-3 Phase 2 study failed to reach its prespecified statistical threshold; the 300 mg dose lowered office SBP −5 mm Hg vs placebo at 3 m, −3.9 mm Hg at 6 m. Factual data are reliable (conference presentation). Opinion: “raises questions about the benefit” – a reporter’s interpretation.  
2. Roche press release, 30 Aug 2025 – Company communication; high-factual accuracy on study design, less so on clinical significance. Confirms plan to start an 11 000-patient Phase 3 CVOT (ZENITH) “by end-2025.” Opinions from Roche CMO are promotional.  
3. AHA newsroom, 11 Nov 2023 – Reputable medical society. Confirms Phase 2 KARDIA-1 met endpoints and gives quantitative BP reductions. Minimal opinion bias.  
4. BioPharma Dive, 5 Mar 2024 – Trade press summarising KARDIA-2 top line; quotes analyst Myles Minter on the need for ≥5 mm Hg reduction. Reliable for topline facts; analyst opinion noted.  
5. Review article in Arterial Hypertension, 2023 – Peer-reviewed but secondary; reiterates Phase 1 data. No regulatory facts.  
6. Applied Clinical Trials, 29 Jan 2026 – Trade press. States that recruitment for ZENITH has begun; repeats earlier Phase 2 facts. Reliable on trial start.  
7. Agent-report (synthesised from SEC filings, press releases, FDA programs) – Compiles public-domain documents. Quality high but should be treated as secondary compilation; most dates cross-check with primary sources above.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All investigational cardiovascular drugs that have reached Phase 2 (base-rate FDA approval ≈ 12 % per BIO/PhRMA 2011-2020 dataset).  
• Cardiovascular drugs that start an outcomes Phase 3 but have not yet enrolled; median time to approval 5–6 years; chance of approval within 1 year of Phase 3 start ≈ <1 %.  
• Drugs for essential hypertension in the last 25 years; very few approvals, all required at least one completed outcomes study; none approved within <3 years of Phase 3 start.  
The third class is the closest analogue and is chosen.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining until 1 May 2026: 93 days.  
Typical timeline from Phase 3 trial activation → New Drug Application (NDA) submission: 2–4 years (patient accrual, follow-up, data cleaning). FDA review: 10 months standard, 6 months priority. Thus, even if ZENITH miraculously finished tomorrow and the NDA were filed instantly with priority review, first-cycle action would land no earlier than late 2026. No evidence of a prior rolling NDA or accelerated-approval strategy is present.

(d) Justification for outside view  
Status-quo pathway: ZENITH just opened; no NDA submitted. Hypertension does not qualify for surrogate-endpoint accelerated approval. FDA has not granted Fast-Track/Breakthrough status (none announced). A manufacturing technology meeting (ETP) occurred only in Dec 2025, consistent with pre-pivotal work. Across the reference class, the empirical frequency of an approval within three months of Phase 3 initiation is effectively nil; the only imaginable routes (e.g., earlier hidden pivotal data set, priority review voucher) have no supporting evidence. To allow for deep uncertainty (e.g., undisclosed rolling submission, policy change, or error in public information) we assign a very small but non-zero probability.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline: Phase 2 cardiovascular asset eventual approval ≈ 12 %.  
Adjustment for “by 1 May 2026” (93 days): historical likelihood <1 % (≈0/300 comparable cases). Multiply: 0.12 × 0.01 ≈ 0.0012 (0.12 %).  
Add 0.3 pp for black-swan possibilities (undisclosed filing, regulatory exception).  
Subtract 0.1 pp for recent marginal Phase 2 efficacy signal (KARDIA-3 underwhelming).  
Calibrated outside-view probability ≈ 0.5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 0.5 % probability that the FDA will approve zilebesiran for hypertension before 1 May 2026.
