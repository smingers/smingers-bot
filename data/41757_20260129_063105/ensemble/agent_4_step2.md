Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. American Heart Association press release (Nov 2023): peer-reviewed Phase 2 KARDIA-1 data; factual, high quality; no regulatory claims.  
2. Pharmacy Times (29 Jan 2026): trade journal recap of KARDIA-1/2; confirms drug remains in Phase 2; no mention of FDA filing.  
3. Actr.amegroups review (2025): scholarly narrative of mechanism and Phase 2 data; clearly states “not yet tested beyond Phase 2.”  
4. FierceBiotech (1 Sep 2025): reputable industry site; confirms mixed Phase 2 results and plan to “take into Phase 3 later this year.”  
5. Benzinga (1 Oct 2025) & FinanzNachrichten (1 Sep 2025): corporate news quoting Alnylam/Roche; first patient dosed in global Phase 3 ZENITH CV-outcomes trial; pivotal study just beginning.  
6. SciTechDaily/ JAMA article (28 Jan 2026): publication of KARDIA-2 (Phase 2) combination data; still mid-stage.  
No source provides evidence of (i) an NDA submission, (ii) Fast-Track/Breakthrough/Accelerated-Approval status, or (iii) an FDA advisory-committee date. All opinions of benefit come from investigators or company executives, identifiable but aspirational.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (against approval)  
• Structural: FDA almost never approves first-in-class antihypertensives without completed Phase 3 CV-outcomes data.  
• Historical: median time from Phase 3 start to approval in CV drugs ≈ 5 years (n≈40 since 2000).  
Moderate evidence (for approval) – essentially none. No surrogate-endpoint pathway is available for routine hypertension.  
Weak evidence (ambiguous)  
• Positive Phase 2 efficacy and safety; shows plausibility but not sufficiency for approval.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 May 2026: 93. Typical NDA review (Priority) ≈ 180 days after filing; Standard ≈ 300 days. No NDA filed → impossible on normal timelines.  
If the horizon were doubled to 186 days (Aug 2026), probability might rise to ~3 %. If halved to 46 days (mid-Mar 2026), probability falls to ~0.5 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (late-Phase-2 CV drug winning FDA nod within 3 months): ~1 %.  
Adjust downward because:  
• Phase 3 ZENITH only just dosed first patient—regulatory package cannot exist. (Strong)  
• No expedited designations; hypertension not eligible for surrogate-endpoint accelerated approval. (Strong)  
• No public FDA meeting dates, no NDA acceptance, no priority-review voucher, nothing on FDA’s calendar. (Strong)  
Small upward nudge (≤ +0.2 pp) for tail-risk scenarios (e.g., unnoticed limited-population approval or breakthrough precedent), but these require both a radical policy shift and new data disclosure—highly implausible in 93 days.  
Net result: 1 % → 0.8 %.

Probability calibration  
I expect that 1 out of 125 similar situations would culminate in approval inside three months; 124 would not.

Checklist:  
1. Will FDA approve Zilebesiran for hypertension by 1 May 2026? (93 days left)  
2. Base rate: 1 % (late-Phase-2 CV drugs → approval ≤ 3 m).  
3. Consistency: “0.8 out of 100 times, approval occurs.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Phase 3 just started (strong).  
   – No NDA filed (strong).  
   – No expedited regulatory designations (strong).  
   – Hypertension approvals require outcomes data (strong).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden FDA policy change allowing BP surrogate for accelerated approval based on Phase 2; would raise odds sharply.  
6. Status-quo bias favors non-approval.

Probability: 1%
