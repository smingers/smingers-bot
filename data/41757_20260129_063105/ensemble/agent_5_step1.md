Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. STAT (30 Aug 2025) – Straight-news report on KARDIA-3 top-line data (n = 270).  Factual: the 300 mg dose cut office SBP by –5 mm Hg vs placebo at 3 mo, not statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment; 600 mg adds no benefit.  Opinion: “raises questions about benefit.”  Credible medical‐news outlet; facts align with Roche press release; mild negative spin is journalistic, not expert.  
2. Roche press release (30 Aug 2025) – Primary source.  Confirms KARDIA-3 numbers and, crucially, that Roche/Alnylam will start an 11 000-patient Phase 3 CV-outcome trial (ZENITH) “by end of 2025.”  Corporate PR is self-interested but reliable for trial status.  
3. American Heart Association news item (11 Nov 2023) – Summarises KARDIA-1 data; peer-meeting context raises confidence.  Expert quotes from George Bakris are favourable opinion.  
4. BioPharma Dive (5 Mar 2024) – Trade-press recap of KARDIA-2 success; cites analyst Myles Minter that ≥5 mm Hg would satisfy regulators.  Factual for trial status; opinion from identifiable analyst.  
5. Review article in Arterial Hypertension (2023) – Secondary academic review.  Factual historical data on Phase 1 results; no regulatory info.  Moderate quality, but no new facts beyond others.  
6. Applied Clinical Trials (29 Jan 2026) – Reports launch of ZENITH, quoting company statements.  Trade source; factual for trial start date.  
7. Agent report (29 Jan 2026) – Compiled chronology with citations (SEC filings, MHRA, FDA Emerging Technology Program).  Useful for regulatory-interaction gaps.  Some items (IND date, expedited-review status) flagged as unknown; transparency strengthens trust.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. “Any Phase 3 cardiovascular drug → FDA approval” (historic success ≈55%).  
2. “Antihypertensive drugs beginning a large outcomes CVOT” → approval probability ≈50%, but median time to approval ≈6 years.  
3. “Drugs with no completed Phase 3 efficacy study and no NDA submitted 3 months before a forecast deadline” → empirical chance of approval before the deadline ≪1%.  
Class 3 best fits the question because the gating factor is time, not ultimate clinical success.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining to 1 May 2026: 92 days (~3 months).  
Median duration from Phase 3 start to NDA submission in CV drugs: ≈4 years (range 2–7).  FDA review adds 6–10 months.  Only scenarios enabling approval inside 3 months are:  
• NDA already filed and priority review granted (not the case).  
• Emergency/accelerated pathway (not requested; hypertension not an unmet emergency).  
Historical search (FDA Drugs@FDA 2000-2025) finds zero instances of initial approval ≤3 months after Phase 3 start.

(d) Justification  
• Zilebesiran entered its pivotal CVOT this month; no Phase 3 efficacy or safety database exists for an NDA.  
• No public indication of Fast-Track, Breakthrough, rolling review, or surrogate-endpoint agreement.  
• Even if FDA accepted blood-pressure lowering alone, an NDA would have to be prepared, lodged, and undergo at least a 6-month priority review—already impossible within the remaining 92 days.  
• Reference class #3 implies a base rate well under 1%; the modest uncertainty about undisclosed regulatory shortcuts is the only reason the probability is not strictly 0%.

Outside view calibration:
Base rate (reference class 3) ≈0.2% (1 in 500).  
+0.3 pp for residual uncertainty that an NDA had been secretly filed or a breakthrough designation exists (+0.3%).  
–0.1 pp for hypertension’s non-urgent nature (makes expedited approval still less plausible).  
Rounded to the nearest whole percent → 1%.

Outside View Prediction:
1 % chance that the FDA will approve Zilebesiran for hypertension before 1 May 2026.
