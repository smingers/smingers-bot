Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant to the resolution criteria)

1. AHA press release (11-Nov-2023) – Peer-meeting summary of Phase 2 KARDIA-1.  Factual efficacy & safety data; pro-drug quotes from Dr Bakris (expert opinion, but dated).  High quality, but old.

2. Pharmacy Times article (29-Jan-2026) – Trade press recap of KARDIA-1/-2.  Confirms drug is still “investigational” and gives no hint of an FDA filing.  Reliable for status-quo.

3. SciTechDaily / JAMA paper (28-Jan-2026) – Publication of Phase 2 KARDIA-2 (663 pts).  Good methodology; again labels drug “investigational”; no regulatory plans mentioned.

4. Benzinga (1-Oct-2025) & thepharmadata (2-Sep-2025) – Company statements that ZENITH (global 11 000-patient Phase 3 CV-outcome trial) has just started dosing.  Primary but self-interested sources; highly credible on trial status.

5. FinanzNachrichten & Fierce Biotech (Sep-2025) – Trade press: Roche/Alnylam intend to begin Phase 3 after “mixed” Phase 2.  Corroborates #4.

6. AskNews “time.news” (Nov-2025) – Opinion piece noting “two concerns” about zilebesiran.  Weak factual value.

7. No source in Jan-2026 (FDA tracker, SEC, press release, clinicaltrials.gov) shows an IND amendment, NDA submission, Fast-Track, Breakthrough, or Priority Review for zilebesiran.

All pulmonary-arterial-hypertension (PAH) and cardiomyopathy items are off-topic to systemic-hypertension indication and are ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis (using requested weighting)

Strong evidence, lowering approval odds
• Structural: FDA cannot legally approve before an NDA is accepted and reviewed (minimum 6 months Priority).  No NDA exists.  (Multiple public trackers & company statements concur.)
• Time history: No CV drug has ever gone from Phase 3 start to approval in <3 months.

Moderate evidence, neutral/slightly positive
• Drug has shown acceptable Phase 2 safety/efficacy and entered a large Phase 3 CVOT (suggests long-term corporate commitment, eventual approval plausible).

Weak evidence, positive
• Enthusiastic investigator/analyst quotes (“game-changing”, “breakthrough”) without regulatory content.

Net weight: overwhelmingly against approval within the window.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time remaining to deadline: 92 days (~3 months).
If the deadline were doubled to 6 months the legal-process constraint would still preclude approval (minimum 6-month review + 60-day filing clock).  Probability would rise only marginally (~1 → 2 %).  If halved to 6 weeks the probability falls effectively to 0 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (drugs that have not yet filed an NDA 3 months before deadline) ≈0.2 %.

Current facts further confirm:
• No NDA filed → approval impossible unless an undisclosed rolling submission already accepted (implausible—FDA dockets are public, companies normally announce).
• No expedited pathway publicly granted; hypertension is not an orphan/rare/oncology indication.
• Launch of a mega-outcome trial this month means pivotal efficacy data are years away.

Residual (very small) uncertainty: conceivably a secret NDA for a narrow resistant-hypertension sub-population accompanied by real-time review.  I assign 0.3 % to that tail.

Combining: 0.2 % base + 0.3 % tail ≈ 0.5 %.

Rounded to whole percent for clarity with the platform format → 1 % (slightly conservative upward to avoid presenting absolute impossibility).

Probability calibration:

“I expect that 1 out of 100 comparable situations ends with FDA approval of zilebesiran for hypertension before 1 May 2026.”

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase: “FDA approved zilebesiran for systemic hypertension by 1-May-2026 (about 3 months away).”

2. Base rate stated (0.2 %); final tied to it.

3. Consistency check done (1/100).

4. Key evidence
   – No NDA on public record (strong, structural).
   – Phase 3 only just started (strong).
   – FDA review minimum 6 months (strong).
   – No expedited designation announced (moderate).
   – Company language continues to call drug “investigational” (moderate).

5. Blind-spot: secret rolling NDA already accepted with priority review and based on BP surrogate.  Would raise probability to perhaps 10 %, but requires unprecedented FDA stance.

6. Status-quo favors “No” and short timeframe magnifies that.

Probability: 1%
