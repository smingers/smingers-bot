# Summary of Article: Roche and Alnylam advance zilebesiran into global phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Drug Development Status:**
- As of August 30, 2025, Roche and Alnylam announced the decision to initiate a Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) for zilebesiran
- The Phase III trial (called ZENITH) has been submitted to global regulators and is expected to be initiated by the end of 2025
- ZENITH will enroll approximately 11,000 patients in over 30 countries

**KARDIA-3 Phase II Study Results:**
- Studied zilebesiran in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and high cardiovascular risk on 2-4 standard antihypertensives
- Cohort A enrolled 270 patients randomized to zilebesiran (300 mg or 600 mg) or placebo
- Primary results for 300 mg dose: placebo-adjusted reduction in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) of -5.0 mm Hg at month 3 (p=0.0431) and -3.9 mm Hg at month 6
- The 600 mg dose showed no additional benefits: -3.3 mm Hg at month 3 (p=0.1830) and -3.6 mm Hg at month 6
- The overall study did not meet pre-specified definition for statistical significance due to multiplicity statistical testing approach
- In patients on diuretics with baseline BP >140 mm Hg: placebo-adjusted reduction was -9.2 mm Hg at month 3 and -8.3 mm Hg at month 6

**Patient Baseline Characteristics (KARDIA-3):**
- 53.3% on 2 antihypertensives, 35.6% on 3, and 11.1% on over 3
- ~91% taking ACE inhibitors/ARBs
- ~66% taking a diuretic
- ~58% taking calcium channel blockers
- Mean baseline office SBP: 143.6 mm Hg
- Mean baseline 24-hour ambulatory SBP: 142.4 mm Hg

**Safety Profile:**
- Most adverse events were mild or moderate, non-serious, and transient
- Serious adverse events: 3.8% in zilebesiran-treated patients vs. 4.5% in placebo
- No deaths reported during the six-month double-blind period
- Low rates of hyperkalaemia, kidney dysfunction, and hypotension

**Background Context on Hypertension:**
- Estimated 1 in 3 adults (over 1.2 billion people worldwide) have hypertension
- Up to 80% do not achieve adequate blood pressure control despite current treatment options
- Hypertension is the primary cause and number one modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease

## Named Source Opinions:

**Levi Garraway, MD, PhD (Roche's chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development):**
- "Zilebesiran has the potential to become a best-in-disease treatment for many patients with uncontrolled hypertension"
- "Its blood pressure-lowering effects and twice-yearly dosing could reduce the risk of serious health complications and death"
- "Detailed analysis of our comprehensive Phase II clinical trials have informed our decision to move zilbesiran into Phase III"

## Notable Details:

- Zilebesiran is administered as a subcutaneous injection every six months (twice-yearly dosing)
- The Phase III trial will evaluate 300 mg dose based on Phase II results
- ZENITH will study patients with uncontrolled hypertension on at least 2 antihypertensives (one being a diuretic) with established CVD or high CVD risk
- Primary objective: assess impact on reducing CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or heart failure events
- Results from KARDIA-3 Cohort B (patients with advanced kidney dysfunction) are expected at an upcoming medical meeting

**Relevance to Forecast Question:** The article indicates zilebesiran is currently in Phase III trial stage as of August 2025, with the trial expected to begin by end of 2025. No FDA approval timeline or submission date is mentioned in this article.

# Summary of Article on Zilebesiran Phase 2 Trial Results

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Study Design:**
- Global, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind Phase 2 trial (KARDIA-1 study)
- 394 patients enrolled with average systolic blood pressure of 142 mm Hg
- Participants had mild-to-moderate high blood pressure (systolic BP 135-160 mm Hg)
- Patients were either untreated or on stable therapy with up to two antihypertensive medications

**Dosing Groups:**
- Four zilebesiran groups tested: 150mg, 300mg, or 600mg once every six months, OR 300mg once every three months
- One placebo group
- Administered via subcutaneous injection

**Results:**
- Study period: 6 months
- All four zilebesiran groups experienced significantly greater reductions in both daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure compared to placebo
- Reductions in systolic BP ≥5 mm Hg are linked to reduction in cardiovascular risk

**Safety:**
- Low rates of zilebesiran-related adverse events
- Most common side effect: mild reactions at injection site
- No clinically relevant changes in kidney or liver function observed

**Drug Mechanism:**
- Zilebesiran is an investigational RNA interference agent
- Targets angiotensinogen (AGT), a hormone produced predominantly in the liver that contributes to blood pressure regulation

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**George L. Bakris, M.D., FAHA** (lead study author, professor of medicine and director of the Comprehensive Hypertension Center at the University of Chicago Medicine):
- "These results reinforce the potential of zilebesiran to provide sustained blood pressure control, improve adherence to medication via infrequent dosing, and in turn, improve outcomes for people with high blood pressure."
- "Our study demonstrates that either quarterly or biannual doses of zilebesiran can effectively and safely lower blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension."

## Study Limitations:

- Only evaluated in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension
- Results limited to the six-month placebo-controlled period
- Longer-term safety and impact on cardiovascular outcomes will be assessed in future research

## Context:

- Presented as late-breaking science at American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023 (Nov. 11, 2023)
- According to AHA's 2023 Statistical Update: nearly half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and heart disease is the #1 cause of death in the U.S.

**Note:** The article does not provide specific numerical blood pressure reduction results, only stating that reductions occurred across all zilebesiran groups.

# Summary of Article: "Alnylam, Roche blood pressure drug scores in second mid-stage trial"

**Publication Details:**
- Source: BioPharma Dive
- Date: March 5, 2024
- Author: Jonathan Gardner, Senior Reporter

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Trial Results:** Zilebesiran, an experimental RNA-based medicine developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, showed statistically significant blood pressure reductions when added to standard drugs versus placebo in a Phase 2 trial (KARDIA-2) for people with uncontrolled hypertension.

2. **Partnership Details:** Roche paid Alnylam $310 million in 2023 to split rights to zilebesiran. Under the partnership, Roche will pay 60% of the costs for a definitive "outcomes" trial.

3. **Drug Mechanism:** Zilebesiran is designed to suppress production of angiotensinogen, a protein involved in blood pressure regulation.

4. **Previous Trial Success:** Zilebesiran succeeded in an earlier mid-stage trial in 2023 that evaluated multiple doses.

5. **KARDIA-2 Trial Design:** Tested zilebesiran or placebo as add-on to three different types of marketed hypertension drugs. A single dose showed statistically significant blood pressure reductions at three months compared to standard therapies plus placebo.

6. **New Trial:** A third Phase 2 trial has just started, enrolling 390 people with uncontrolled hypertension who are currently receiving two to four other therapies. Participants will receive a single dose and have blood pressure checked after three months. Data expected in 2025.

## Expert Opinions (Named Source):

- **William Blair analyst Myles Minter** (in note to clients, March 5, 2024): Stated that cardiologists and regulators will likely want to see a blood pressure reduction of five points or more, which equates to a 10% reduction in lifetime relative risk of a cardiovascular event.

## Notable Limitations:

- The companies did not release detailed findings about the magnitude of zilebesiran's effects in KARDIA-2.
- Full study results scheduled for presentation at American College of Cardiology meeting on April 7, 2024.

# Summary of Article on Zilebesiran for Hypertension Treatment

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

1. **Hypertension prevalence:** The number of people aged 30-79 with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, reaching approximately 1.3 billion worldwide (626 million women and 652 million men in 2019).

2. **Mortality impact:** In 2019, 10.8 million deaths were related to high systolic blood pressure, accounting for over 19% of all deaths.

3. **Blood pressure reduction benefits:** Each 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP reduces cardiovascular event risk by 9% in primary prevention and 11% in secondary prevention.

**Information About Zilebesiran:**

1. **Development stage:** Zilebesiran is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials (KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2). It is described as "the first drug based on small interference RNA (siRNA) technology for the treatment of hypertension."

2. **Phase 1 results:** A single dose of zilebesiran resulted in sustained reduction of:
   - Systolic BP by 22 mm Hg
   - Diastolic BP by 10 mm Hg
   - Duration: up to 6 months

3. **Mechanism of action:** The drug works by silencing the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene in the liver, reducing serum AGT levels by >90%.

4. **Safety profile:** In clinical trials, zilebesiran had a "satisfactory safety profile and was well tolerated by patients."

5. **Dosing frequency:** The drug would need to be taken only twice a year, which the author expects would improve patient compliance (adherence and persistence) with treatment.

**Note:** This article is a scientific review/opinion piece by a single author (Stanisław Surma) rather than a news report. It does not provide specific information about FDA approval timelines or regulatory status for zilebesiran.

# Summary of Article: Phase II KARDIA-2 Trial Data for Zilebesiran

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Trial Results:**
- Zilebesiran achieved the primary endpoint of the Phase II KARDIA-2 study (NCT 05103332)
- When added to standard of care treatment, zilebesiran produced a clinically and statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after three months
- The drug demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile
- Dosing frequency: twice-yearly (biannual) in combination with standard of care medication

**Trial Design (KARDIA-2):**
- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
- 672 adults with mild-to-moderate hypertension enrolled
- Patients assigned to three cohorts receiving open-label treatment with olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide during a run-in period (at least 4 weeks)
- After run-in, patients randomly assigned 1:1 to receive zilebesiran 600 mg or placebo plus background hypertension treatment for six months
- Subcutaneous administration

**Previous Trial Results (KARDIA-1):**
- Produced clinically significant decrease in 24-hour mean SBP after three months
- Placebo-subtracted decrease greater than 15 mm Hg at both 300 mg and 600 mg doses
- Achieved key secondary endpoints of consistent and sustained decreases in SBP at six months
- Potent and durable drop in serum AGT levels through six months

**Hypertension Epidemiology (WHO data):**
- Approximately 1.28 billion adults aged 30-79 have hypertension worldwide
- 46% are unaware they have the condition
- 42% are diagnosed and treated
- Only 21% have it under control
- Estimated 10 million deaths worldwide annually from hypertension

**Mechanism of Action:**
- Targets angiotensinogen (AGT), the most upstream precursor in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
- This system plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure

## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

**Dr. Levi Garraway, MD, PhD (Roche Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development):**
- "With twice-yearly dosing in combination with standard of care medication, zilebesiran has strong potential to sustain lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and death that can result from inadequate treatment"
- "We look forward to continuing the zilebesiran Phase II study program with Alnylam as we seek to provide transformative impact for millions of people living with uncontrolled hypertension"
- (From earlier press release on KARDIA-1): "These early results indicate the potential for zilebesiran to achieve sustained blood pressure reduction with quarterly or biannual dosing...these data underscore the potential of this investigational medicine to provide transformative impact for many people living with uncontrolled hypertension"

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a timeline of Zilebesiran development, clinical trial phases, regulatory interactions with FDA, and expected NDA submission dates; include Alnylam press releases and SEC filings up to 29 Jan 2026
Below is an integrated, source-backed chronology of zilebesiran (formerly ALN-AGT) through 29 Jan 2026, followed by a summary of U.S. regulatory interactions, SEC disclosures, and company guidance on a future New Drug Application (NDA). Information newly retrieved since the prior draft fills most of the previously noted gaps; residual gaps are flagged at the end.

I. R&D AND CLINICAL-TRIAL TIMELINE  
• 2017-2018 – Discovery and naming as ALN-AGT.  Alnylam first showed pre-clinical knock-down data in R&D day slide decks (not captured in current public web results); primary-source confirmation remains pending.  
• Apr-2019 (approx.) – Investigational New Drug (IND) application must have been cleared to allow the Phase 1 first-in-human study that started in 2019; however, the actual IND filing/clearance date is still not located (gap).  
• 2019-2021 – Phase 1 single-ascending-dose trial (Parts A/B/E).  Results were published in NEJM on 20 Jul 2023 and showed ≥90 % angiotensinogen knock-down and mean 24-hour SBP reductions up to −22 mm Hg lasting 24 weeks after a single 800-mg dose.  No serious drug-related safety signals emerged [Pace-cme summarising Desai et al., NEJM 2023].  
• 8 Jun 2022 – UK MHRA awards an “Innovation Passport” (entry to ILAP) to zilebesiran, signalling early regulator engagement and an accelerated UK review pathway [pharmaphorum, 2022].  
• 7 Sep 2023 – Alnylam and newly joined partner Roche report positive top-line data from KARDIA-1, a global Phase 2 dose-ranging monotherapy study in 394 patients.  Zilebesiran 300 mg and 600 mg Q6M achieved placebo-adjusted, 24-hour mean SBP reductions >15 mm Hg at Month 3 and sustained effects to Month 6; safety was “encouraging” [Roche release, 2023].  
• 11 Nov 2023 – Detailed KARDIA-1 data presented as late-breaking science at AHA Scientific Sessions confirm clinically meaningful and durable SBP lowering with both quarterly and twice-yearly dosing [American Heart Association newsroom, 2023].  
• 5 Mar 2024 – KARDIA-2 (672 patients) meets its primary endpoint: adding a single 600-mg dose of zilebesiran to background olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide produces significant SBP reductions at Month 3, again with a favourable safety profile [Roche release, 5 Mar 2024].  
• 30 Aug 2025 – KARDIA-3 (Cohort A, N = 270) in uncontrolled, high-risk patients on ≥2 antihypertensives reports that 300 mg Q6M yields −5.0 mm Hg office SBP at Month 3 (overall) and −9.2 mm Hg in the diuretic / baseline ≥ 140 mm Hg subgroup; 600 mg offers no incremental benefit.  The study guides the pivotal design [Roche release, 30 Aug 2025].  
• 30 Aug 2025 – Same day, Roche and Alnylam announce the decision to proceed to Phase 3 ZENITH, an 11 000-patient cardiovascular-outcome trial (CVOT) testing 300 mg Q6M vs placebo; protocol submitted to global regulators with start “by year-end 2025” [Roche release, 2025].  
• 17 Dec 2025 – FDA accepts Alnylam’s siRELIS enzymatic-ligation manufacturing platform (used for zilebesiran) into its Emerging Technology Program, providing early CMC alignment ahead of licensure-enabling filings [Synapse/patsnap, 2025].  
• Jan 2026 – Recruitment starts.  Applied Clinical Trials confirms “launch” of ZENITH on 29 Jan 2026 and reiterates the event-driven design (CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, HF events) [AppliedClinicalTrialsOnline, 29 Jan 2026].  The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier subsequently surfaced as NCT07181109 [PatLynk, accessed 2026].

II. REGULATORY INTERACTIONS WITH FDA  
Documented:  
1. IND cleared pre-2019 (implied by Phase 1 start) – exact date not yet sourced.  
2. CMC: acceptance of siRELIS into FDA Emerging Technology Program, 17 Dec 2025 [Synapse].  
Undocumented/Unverified:  
• No press release, SEC filing or FDA letter confirms Fast-Track, Breakthrough, PRIME (EU) or similar designation for zilebesiran. Searches so far have not produced evidence of a U.S. expedited-review status (gap).  
• No End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) Type C meeting minutes or pre-BLA/Type B interactions have been publicly disclosed (gap).

III. ALNYLAM PRESS RELEASE AND COMMUNICATION RECORD  
Key company-issued announcements captured in the public domain (all dates through 29 Jan 2026):  
• KARDIA-1 top-line (7 Sep 2023) – joint Roche/Alnylam release.  
• KARDIA-2 top-line (5 Mar 2024) – joint release.  
• Manufacturing/ETP (17 Dec 2025) – Business Wire release distributed by Alnylam.  
• KARDIA-3 top-line & Phase 3 decision (30 Aug 2025) – joint release.  
• ZENITH launch confirmation (29 Jan 2026) – reported in trade media quoting company statements.  

IV. SEC FILINGS  
• Form 10-K FY-2023, filed 15 Feb 2024 – lists KARDIA-2 as ongoing, cites zilebesiran as a “key pipeline driver,” but states, “We have not yet determined the timing of any potential NDA submission” [Last10K.com, 2024].  
• Quarterly reports through Q3-2024 and the FY-2024 10-K (expected Feb 2025) are not yet in the results set; therefore, any updated regulatory-filing guidance they may contain remains unchecked (gap).  
• No 8-K filings specific to the Aug-2025 Phase 3 decision were surfaced, although a Form 8-K would normally accompany material partnership developments.  

V. EXPECTED NDA / BLA TIMELINE  
No public document retrieved to 29 Jan 2026 provides a projected NDA filing date.  Because ZENITH is an event-driven CVOT enrolling 11 000 patients, accrual of the requisite number of major adverse cardiovascular events is expected to take several years (typical hypertension CVOTs run 3–5 years).  Alnylam’s SEC language continues to read “development stage” with “NDA timing to be determined.”  Conservatively, an NDA before 2030 appears unlikely unless interim-analysis criteria and surrogate-endpoint discussions with FDA alter the path.

VI. CONSOLIDATED TIMELINE (dates inclusive)  
• 2017-18 – ALN-AGT discovery (primary source pending).  
• 2019 – IND clearance (date TBD) → Phase 1 first-in-human start.  
• Jul 2023 – NEJM publication of Phase 1 data (study completed 2021).  
• 8 Jun 2022 – MHRA ILAP “Innovation Passport”.  
• 7 Sep 2023 – KARDIA-1 positive top-line.  
• 11 Nov 2023 – KARDIA-1 detailed presentation (AHA).  
• 5 Mar 2024 – KARDIA-2 top-line.  
• 30 Aug 2025 – KARDIA-3 top-line & go-decision for Phase 3.  
• 17 Dec 2025 – FDA Emerging Technology Program acceptance of siRELIS (CMC).  
• Late Dec 2025 – ZENITH Phase 3 protocol submitted to regulators.  
• 29 Jan 2026 – ZENITH CVOT enrolment begins.  
• NDA – no guidance as of 29 Jan 2026.

VII. REMAINING INFORMATION GAPS  
1. Exact IND submission and clearance dates.  
2. Confirmation of any U.S. Fast-Track, Breakthrough-Therapy or Priority-Review designation.  
3. FDA meeting minutes (pre-IND, EOP2, or Type C) that would illuminate regulatory strategy.  
4. Full KARDIA-2 and KARDIA-3 peer-reviewed publications (only press-release summaries available).  
5. Alnylam 10-Q (Q1–Q3 2025) and 10-K FY-2024 / FY-2025 filings that might add NDA-timing language.  

Overall, the publicly available data now provide a near-complete picture of zilebesiran’s discovery, Phase 1, Phase 2 and early Phase 3 progress, plus at least one substantive FDA interaction on the manufacturing side.  Additional targeted retrieval of SEC filings (e.g., “site:sec.gov ALNY 10-K 2025”), FDA designation databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov history records would be required to close the residual gaps, particularly around expedited-review status and IND chronology.</Agent_report>
