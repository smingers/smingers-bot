    "description": "This question tracks whether the FDA issues a formal approval for Zilebesiran (ALN-AGT), a first-in-class siRNA therapy, for hypertension before May 1, 2026. Approval would mark the first RNA interference therapy for a high-prevalence cardiovascular condition, shifting the treatment paradigm from daily pills to biannual injections.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"499d66f22c3e2c36\"}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves to Yes if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants marketing approval to Zilebesiran (also known as ALN-AGT) for the treatment of hypertension at any point after the launch of this question and before May 1, 2026. Resolution will be determined by the official FDA 'Novel Drug Approvals' [list for 2026](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/novel-drug-approvals-fda/novel-drug-approvals-2026) or an official press release or announcement from the FDA or the drug's developers (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Roche).",
    "fine_print": "Approval refers to a formal FDA decision allowing the drug to be marketed in the United States; a 'Complete Response Letter' (CRL) or a recommendation for approval by an advisory committee does not constitute approval. If the drug is approved for a different primary indication but not for hypertension, the question resolves to No. If the FDA database and the manufacturer's press release provide conflicting dates for the approval, the date listed on the official FDA approval letter shall take precedence.",
