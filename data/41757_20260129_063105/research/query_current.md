Analysis:
Zilebesiran (ALN-AGT) is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals’ RNA-interference therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen for hypertension.  As of late-2025 the drug had completed the phase-2 KARDIA-1 study with encouraging blood-pressure reductions and was recruiting for the phase-2 KARDIA-2 combination trial.  No phase-3 trials, NDA submission, FDA priority/fast-track designation, or advisory-committee scheduling have yet been reported publicly.  To assess the likelihood of FDA approval before 1 May 2026, the most relevant near-term signals are:
• Announcement of a pivotal phase-3 program and its expected completion dates  
• Any FDA breakthrough/fast-track designation, rolling submission, or NDA filing acceptance  
• Partnership or licensing news suggesting accelerated timelines  

Therefore, the current information we need to locate is (1) whether Alnylam has initiated or finished a phase-3 study, (2) whether an NDA has been or is planned to be submitted, and (3) any FDA interactions or guidance on review timelines.
