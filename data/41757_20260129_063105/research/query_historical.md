Analysis:
To judge the probability of FDA approval before 1 May 2026 I will need (a) the current regulatory status of Zilebesiran (e.g., whether an NDA has been or is expected to be filed, fast-track designations, trial phase, partnership announcements), (b) historical development milestones and clinical results, and (c) precedents for recent FDA review times for comparable hypertension drugs and other Alnylam siRNA products. Searches should therefore target authoritative press releases, SEC filings, clinical-trial announcements, FDA documents and high-quality news coverage from 2020-2026.
