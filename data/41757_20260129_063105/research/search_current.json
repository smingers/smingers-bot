The approval, announced on January 27, 2026, in Milan by MSD, follows the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) designation of sotatercept as a Priority Medicine (PRIME) and an orphan drug, along with AIFA\u2019s recognition of its innovation status. PAH is a rare, progressive disease affecting the pulmonary vasculature, leading to vessel thickening, increased resistance to blood flow, and right ventricular failure. It has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5\u20137 years post-diagnosis, affecting approximately 3,500 people in Italy and 400,000 globally, predominantly women of reproductive age (4:1 ratio). Sotatercept, an inhibitor of the activin signaling pathway, is the first therapy to target the root biological cause of PAH by inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation, potentially reversing disease progression. Clinical evidence from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial showed a 41-meter improvement in the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and an 84% reduction in clinical worsening compared to standard therapy. The ZENITH trial in high-risk patients demonstrated a 76% reduction in a composite endpoint of death, lung transplant, or hospitalization, leading to early trial termination due to clear clinical benefit. The drug is administered subcutaneously every three weeks and can be self-managed at home. Experts, including Professor Nazzareno Gali\u00e8 and Dr. Stefano Ghio, emphasize that sotatercept represents a paradigm shift, as it directly targets vascular remodeling rather than just modulating downstream pathways. AIFA\u2019s decision, approved by its Board on December 15, 2025, awaits publication in the Official Gazette to become effective. MSD highlighted its broader commitment to innovation, with over 50 new drugs in Phase 2 and more than 30 in Phase 3 development, including both therapies and vaccines.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[Provincia di Cremona](https://www.laprovinciacr.it/news/italia-e-mondo/566065/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-via-libera-dell-aifa-a-un-nuovo-farmaco.html)\n\n**Sotatercept: A Groundbreaking Therapy for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Says MSD's Luppi**\nNicoletta Luppi, President and CEO of MSD Italy, stated that sotatercept is a 'true and certified innovation' recognized by the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Italy's AIFA. She emphasized that sotatercept is the first drug in a new class capable of targeting the root cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), potentially causing the disease to regress and improving patients' health. The drug has been approved for reimbursement in adults with PAH, marking a significant advancement. Luppi highlighted that PAH, though rare, demands the same dedication and passion in research and treatment. She noted that since patients are often young, the therapy aims to restore a significantly better quality of life. The drug is backed by extensive clinical data, including four Phase III trials\u2014two of which were halted early due to superior outcomes compared to the current standard of care. Luppi affirmed that MSD will continue researching potential new indications and developing other drugs in this therapeutic area, stressing the need for collaboration with public and private institutions, and for leveraging digital and technological innovation to shorten diagnosis time and enhance therapy and prevention.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 03:44 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/salute/luppi-msd-sotatercept-farmaco-innovativo-per-ipertensione-polmonare_1zZ0cz8up0rY6U0c7xTnmO)\n\n**Aifa Approves Reimbursement for New Drug Sotatercept in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension**\nThe Italian Medicines Agency (Aifa) has approved reimbursement for Sotatercept, a first-in-class biological drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a progressive and disabling disease affecting approximately 3,500 people annually in Italy, primarily women. The drug, which acts directly on the biological mechanisms underlying the disease by targeting pulmonary vascular remodeling, has received Priority Medicine (Prime) and orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Aifa recognized its innovation, and the decision will become operational upon publication in the Official Gazette. The European approval, expected in August 2024, is supported by the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, which showed an 84% reduction in the risk of clinical worsening, and the ZENITH trial, which demonstrated a 76% reduction in the composite endpoint of death, lung transplant, or hospitalization due to PAH worsening. Unlike existing therapies that only improve symptoms and functional capacity, Sotatercept directly addresses pathological vascular remodeling. Administered subcutaneously every three weeks and suitable for home use, it corrects imbalances in signaling pathways driving abnormal cell proliferation. According to Nicoletta Luppi, President and CEO of MSD Italy, the drug was already available under compassionate use since May 2024, and its reimbursement access marks a new phase, offering the potential to improve quality of life, extend life expectancy, and reduce the need for extreme outcomes such as lung transplantation.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 03:32 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/ansacom/notizie/canale_saluteebenessere/Msd/2026/01/27/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-ok-aifa-a-rimborsabilita-nuovo-farmaco_a6a3e2e5-3adf-401b-bc70-15945cc24ca2.html)\n\n**Innovative Drug for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Approved in Italy: How Sotatercept Works**\nMSD has announced that the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has approved the reimbursement of sotatercept, a first-in-class biological drug, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients (WHO functional class II to III) who have already been treated with triple therapy for at least six months. The drug, produced in Italy as stated by Nicoletta Luppi, CEO and President of MSD Italy, belongs to a novel class of medicines known as activin signal inhibitors and is the first therapy to directly target the underlying biological mechanisms of PAH, thereby altering the disease's progression. According to Luppi, 'this innovation is now available to Italian patients, who, with proper diagnosis and under specialist supervision, will have an additional opportunity to manage this condition.' She emphasized MSD\u2019s significant investment in research\u2014nearly 18 billion USD annually\u2014making it the world\u2019s leading biopharmaceutical company in research intensity, particularly in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as rare diseases. In Italy, approximately 3,500 people are estimated to live with PAH, predominantly women, with diagnosis often delayed due to early symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue that mimic other cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Stefano Ghio, Director of the Cardiomyopathy and Transplantation Unit and Pulmonary Hypertension at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia and President of the Italian Pulmonary Hypertension Network (Iphnet), explained that the disease is challenging due to its rarity and lack of recognition, leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses. He stressed that early treatment is crucial, as the risk lies in both missed and misdiagnoses. Sotatercept is administered subcutaneously every three weeks and can be self-managed at home after proper training. Clinical trials have demonstrated its safety and efficacy, with 'dramatic impact on disease progression,' including patients no longer needing lung transplant. Ghio confirmed that 'patients previously on the transplant waiting list have seen benefits so significant that transplantation is no longer required.' Luppi concluded by expressing the hope that the therapy will be made available to patients in need as soon as possible.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:47 PM\nSource:[Lapresse](https://www.lapresse.it/video/2026/01/27/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-arriva-in-italia-il-primo-farmaco-innovativo-ecco-come-agisce/)\n\n**Aifa Approves Reimbursement for Innovative Biologic Sotatercept in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension**\nThe Italian Medicines Agency (Aifa) has approved the reimbursement of sotatercept, a first-in-class biological therapy, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class II to III who have previously received at least six months of triple therapy.

The approval, announced on January 27, 2026, in Milan by MSD, follows the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) designation of sotatercept as a Priority Medicine (PRIME) and an orphan drug, along with AIFA\u2019s recognition of its innovation status. PAH is a rare, progressive disease affecting the pulmonary vasculature, leading to vessel thickening, increased resistance to blood flow, and right ventricular failure. It has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5\u20137 years post-diagnosis, affecting approximately 3,500 people in Italy and 400,000 globally, predominantly women of reproductive age (4:1 ratio). Sotatercept, an inhibitor of the activin signaling pathway, is the first therapy to target the root biological cause of PAH by inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation, potentially reversing disease progression. Clinical evidence from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial showed a 41-meter improvement in the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and an 84% reduction in clinical worsening compared to standard therapy. The ZENITH trial in high-risk patients demonstrated a 76% reduction in a composite endpoint of death, lung transplant, or hospitalization, leading to early trial termination due to clear clinical benefit. The drug is administered subcutaneously every three weeks and can be self-managed at home. Experts, including Professor Nazzareno Gali\u00e8 and Dr. Stefano Ghio, emphasize that sotatercept represents a paradigm shift, as it directly targets vascular remodeling rather than just modulating downstream pathways. AIFA\u2019s decision, approved by its Board on December 15, 2025, awaits publication in the Official Gazette to become effective. MSD highlighted its broader commitment to innovation, with over 50 new drugs in Phase 2 and more than 30 in Phase 3 development, including both therapies and vaccines.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[Provincia di Cremona](https://www.laprovinciacr.it/news/italia-e-mondo/566065/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-via-libera-dell-aifa-a-un-nuovo-farmaco.html)\n\n**Sotatercept: A Groundbreaking Therapy for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Says MSD's Luppi**\nNicoletta Luppi, President and CEO of MSD Italy, stated that sotatercept is a 'true and certified innovation' recognized by the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Italy's AIFA. She emphasized that sotatercept is the first drug in a new class capable of targeting the root cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), potentially causing the disease to regress and improving patients' health. The drug has been approved for reimbursement in adults with PAH, marking a significant advancement. Luppi highlighted that PAH, though rare, demands the same dedication and passion in research and treatment. She noted that since patients are often young, the therapy aims to restore a significantly better quality of life. The drug is backed by extensive clinical data, including four Phase III trials\u2014two of which were halted early due to superior outcomes compared to the current standard of care. Luppi affirmed that MSD will continue researching potential new indications and developing other drugs in this therapeutic area, stressing the need for collaboration with public and private institutions, and for leveraging digital and technological innovation to shorten diagnosis time and enhance therapy and prevention.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 03:44 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/salute/luppi-msd-sotatercept-farmaco-innovativo-per-ipertensione-polmonare_1zZ0cz8up0rY6U0c7xTnmO)\n\n**Aifa Approves Reimbursement for New Drug Sotatercept in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension**\nThe Italian Medicines Agency (Aifa) has approved reimbursement for Sotatercept, a first-in-class biological drug for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a progressive and disabling disease affecting approximately 3,500 people annually in Italy, primarily women. The drug, which acts directly on the biological mechanisms underlying the disease by targeting pulmonary vascular remodeling, has received Priority Medicine (Prime) and orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Aifa recognized its innovation, and the decision will become operational upon publication in the Official Gazette. The European approval, expected in August 2024, is supported by the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, which showed an 84% reduction in the risk of clinical worsening, and the ZENITH trial, which demonstrated a 76% reduction in the composite endpoint of death, lung transplant, or hospitalization due to PAH worsening. Unlike existing therapies that only improve symptoms and functional capacity, Sotatercept directly addresses pathological vascular remodeling. Administered subcutaneously every three weeks and suitable for home use, it corrects imbalances in signaling pathways driving abnormal cell proliferation. According to Nicoletta Luppi, President and CEO of MSD Italy, the drug was already available under compassionate use since May 2024, and its reimbursement access marks a new phase, offering the potential to improve quality of life, extend life expectancy, and reduce the need for extreme outcomes such as lung transplantation.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 03:32 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/ansacom/notizie/canale_saluteebenessere/Msd/2026/01/27/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-ok-aifa-a-rimborsabilita-nuovo-farmaco_a6a3e2e5-3adf-401b-bc70-15945cc24ca2.html)\n\n**Innovative Drug for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Approved in Italy: How Sotatercept Works**\nMSD has announced that the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has approved the reimbursement of sotatercept, a first-in-class biological drug, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients (WHO functional class II to III) who have already been treated with triple therapy for at least six months. The drug, produced in Italy as stated by Nicoletta Luppi, CEO and President of MSD Italy, belongs to a novel class of medicines known as activin signal inhibitors and is the first therapy to directly target the underlying biological mechanisms of PAH, thereby altering the disease's progression. According to Luppi, 'this innovation is now available to Italian patients, who, with proper diagnosis and under specialist supervision, will have an additional opportunity to manage this condition.' She emphasized MSD\u2019s significant investment in research\u2014nearly 18 billion USD annually\u2014making it the world\u2019s leading biopharmaceutical company in research intensity, particularly in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as rare diseases. In Italy, approximately 3,500 people are estimated to live with PAH, predominantly women, with diagnosis often delayed due to early symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue that mimic other cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Stefano Ghio, Director of the Cardiomyopathy and Transplantation Unit and Pulmonary Hypertension at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia and President of the Italian Pulmonary Hypertension Network (Iphnet), explained that the disease is challenging due to its rarity and lack of recognition, leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses. He stressed that early treatment is crucial, as the risk lies in both missed and misdiagnoses. Sotatercept is administered subcutaneously every three weeks and can be self-managed at home after proper training. Clinical trials have demonstrated its safety and efficacy, with 'dramatic impact on disease progression,' including patients no longer needing lung transplant. Ghio confirmed that 'patients previously on the transplant waiting list have seen benefits so significant that transplantation is no longer required.' Luppi concluded by expressing the hope that the therapy will be made available to patients in need as soon as possible.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:47 PM\nSource:[Lapresse](https://www.lapresse.it/video/2026/01/27/ipertensione-arteriosa-polmonare-arriva-in-italia-il-primo-farmaco-innovativo-ecco-come-agisce/)\n\n**Aifa Approves Reimbursement for Innovative Biologic Sotatercept in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension**\nThe Italian Medicines Agency (Aifa) has approved the reimbursement of sotatercept, a first-in-class biological therapy, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class II to III who have previously received at least six months of triple therapy.

The international research team conducted early-phase clinical trials across four centers in the UK, involving 107 patients with hypertension. Of these, 80 received a single injection of zilebesiran (200 mg or 800 mg), while 32 received a placebo. Results showed a significant and sustained reduction in systolic blood pressure: more than 10 mm Hg at the 200 mg dose and over 20 mm Hg at the 800 mg dose, lasting for six months. The drug works by inhibiting the production of angiotensin, a hormone that constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. According to researchers, no new class of antihypertensive drugs has been registered in the past 17 years, making this a breakthrough. The treatment offers improved blood pressure control for up to 24 hours, with effects lasting up to six months after one injection. Experts note that over half of hypertensive patients discontinue medication due to pill burden, leading to inconsistent control and increased risks of stroke, dementia, and heart attacks.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 12:15 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2026/01/odna-inyekciya-yaka-znizhuye-tisk-na-pivroku)\n\n**Zilebesiran: New Hope for High Blood Pressure? - TIme News**\nA recent clinical trial evaluating zilebesiran, a subcutaneously administered drug, in combination with first-line oral antihypertensive medications for hypertension management has come under scrutiny.

For years, treatment options were limited to established classes such as RAAS inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), and beta-blockers, with alpha-blockers only listed as reserve medications. This lack of innovation has particularly affected patients with resistant hypertension or medication intolerances. However, recent years have seen significant research into interventional blood pressure reduction methods, including renal denervation and Barostim. Most notably, new studies have been published on drugs from novel substance classes: aprocitentan, a dual endothelin antagonist; zilebesiran, an RNA interference therapeutic agent; and baxdrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor. Clinical trials, including the phase 3 PRECISION trial for aprocitentan and phase 2 trials for baxdrostat, have demonstrated promising results in treating resistant hypertension. These developments represent a potential breakthrough in hypertension management, offering new hope for patients with limited treatment options.

(NASDAQ: ALNY) has initiated the global Phase 3 ZENITH trial (Zilebesiran Cardiovascular Outcome Study in Hypertension), dosing the first patient in a pivotal study evaluating zilebesiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic, for reducing major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The trial, a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) (NCT07181109), will enroll approximately 11,000 patients across 35 countries. Participants will receive either zilebesiran (300 mg) administered subcutaneously every six months or placebo, and will have uncontrolled hypertension with established cardiovascular disease or high risk for CV disease despite treatment with at least two antihypertensive medications. The primary endpoint is the reduction in risk of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or heart failure (hospitalization for HF or urgent HF visit) compared to placebo. Zilebesiran targets liver-expressed angiotensinogen (AGT), the most upstream precursor in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), offering the potential for sustained, 24-hour blood pressure control with biannual dosing. Weinong Guo, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, Clinical Research at Alnylam, stated that the first patient dosed marks a major milestone in advancing zilebesiran as a potential treatment for patients with high unmet need. Earlier, in August 2024, Alnylam presented data from KARDIA-3 Cohort A at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in Madrid, Spain, with results from Cohort B to be presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 11:36 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/10/47964559/alnylam-begins-global-phase-3-trial-testing-new-hypertension-drug-zilebesiran-doses-first-patient-in)\n\n**Novel drug candidates for hard-to-treat hypertension vie for blockbuster positioning**\nNearly 1.3\u202fbillion people worldwide have high blood pressure, and about 10\u202f% of patients remain uncontrolled despite multiple approved antihypertensives. At the ESC Congress, drug developers highlighted new agents that lower blood pressure when added to existing therapy. AstraZeneca\u2019s baxdrostat, a selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor, was tested in a phase\u202fIII trial with 796 patients on two or more antihypertensives. At 12\u202fweeks, the placebo\u2011adjusted systolic BP reduction was \u20138.7\u202fmm\u202fHg with 1\u202fmg and \u20139.8\u202fmm\u202fHg with 2\u202fmg. A ~10\u202fmm\u202fHg improvement is linked to a 20\u202f% reduction in cardiovascular events, according to AstraZeneca\u2019s Sharon\u202fBarr. Common adverse events were hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypotension, muscle spasms and dizziness; discontinuation due to hyperkalaemia was low. Clinician\u2011scientists Tomasz\u202fGuzik and Maciej\u202fTomaszewski noted that the class\u2011predictable adverse effects suggest a favourable risk\u2011benefit balance, especially for the 1\u202fmg dose with disciplined monitoring. The data support baxdrostat as a promising adjunct; AstraZeneca plans to file for regulatory approval later this year and expects sales above US$5\u202fbillion. The company is also testing baxdrostat in combination with its SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (Farxiga) in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure, aiming to address comorbid conditions early. Other selective aldosterone synthase inhibitors, such as Mineralys\u2019s lorundrostat and Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s vicadrostat, are in phase\u202fIII trials. Alnylam and Roche\u2019s RNAi\u2011based angiotensinogen inhibitor zilebesiran showed a placebo\u2011adjusted systolic BP reduction of \u20135.0\u202fmm\u202fHg at 3\u202fmonths and \u20133.9\u202fmm\u202fHg at 6\u202fmonths in a phase\u202fII KARDIA\u20113 trial, with a greater benefit of \u20139.2\u202fmm\u202fHg in patients on diuretics. The oligonucleotide was safe, with mostly mild or moderate adverse events. Roche and Alnylam plan to advance zilebesiran to phase\u202fIII. Idorsia\u2019s endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan received FDA approval last year, with a placebo\u2011adjusted \u20133.8\u202fmm\u202fHg benefit after 4\u202fweeks.\n\nKey quotes: 'We're very encouraged about the potential of baxdrostat to become a meaningful new medicine for patients with hard\u2011to\u2011treat hypertension,' said Sharon\u202fBarr.

The trial will enroll about 11,000 patients in more than 30 countries by the end of 2025, pending regulatory approval. Zilebesiran targets liver\u2011expressed angiotensinogen (AGT) and is administered subcutaneously every six months, offering a long\u2011acting alternative to daily RAAS inhibitors. In KARDIA\u20113, the 300\u202fmg dose produced a mean office systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction of 3.9\u202fmmHg at month\u202f3 and 3.9\u202fmmHg at month\u202f6, while the 600\u202fmg dose did not show additional benefit, indicating 300\u202fmg as the optimal dose. Patients with baseline SBP\u202f\u2265\u202f140\u202fmmHg on a diuretic plus another antihypertensive experienced reductions of \u2265\u202f8\u202fmmHg sustained for six months. Biomarker improvements included lower NT\u2011proBNP and urinary albumin\u2011to\u2011creatinine ratio (UACR). Adverse events were mild\u2011to\u2011moderate and non\u2011serious, with low rates of hyperkalemia, kidney dysfunction, and hypotension. Alnylam\u2019s Chief Research and Development Officer, Pushkal\u00a0Garg, said, 'The KARDIA\u20113 results demonstrate that a single dose of zilebesiran provides continuous blood\u2011pressure control over 24\u202fhours for up to six months, while also improving cardiac and renal biomarkers.' Clinical investigator Neha\u00a0Pagidipati added, 'Patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite multiple background therapies are at the highest risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. The KARDIA\u20113 data support zilebesiran\u2019s potential to achieve sustained, clinically meaningful blood\u2011pressure reductions in high\u2011risk patients.' Hypertension affects an estimated 1.3\u202fbillion people worldwide, with more than half untreated or inadequately controlled; modest SBP reductions of 5\u202fmmHg can lower major cardiovascular event risk by 10\u201315%. ZENITH will focus on hard cardiovascular outcomes rather than surrogate endpoints, aiming to establish zilebesiran\u2019s role in reducing morbidity and mortality in high\u2011risk patients.

A third sub\u2011study in the mid\u2011stage program showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure at month\u202f3 that persisted through month\u202f6, but the effect did not reach the statistical significance threshold set by the companies. The Phase\u20113 trial\u2019s goal is to identify the patient subgroup that could benefit most from Zilebesiran. Roche and Alnylam said the move to a late\u2011phase study is based on the overall mid\u2011stage program, noting that two prior sub\u2011studies had met their primary objectives. The new trial is expected to begin later this year. Zilebesiran is a twice\u2011annual therapy that exploits a natural cellular process of gene silencing\u2014RNA interference\u2014to target the genes responsible for hypertension. The companies highlighted this mechanism in their statement: 'Zilebesiran ist eine zweimal j\u00e4hrlich verabreichte Therapie, die sich einen nat\u00fcrlichen zellul\u00e4ren Prozess des Gen\u2011Silencing zunutze macht, die Bek\u00e4mpfung der Krankheit durch Beeinflussung der sie verursachenden Gene.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 01, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[FinanzNachrichten.de](https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2025-09/66318165-roche-will-phase-3-studie-fuer-neues-bluthochdruckmittel-starten-015.htm)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
