Bakris, M.D., FAHA** (lead study author, professor of medicine and director of the Comprehensive Hypertension Center at the University of Chicago Medicine):\n- \"These results reinforce the potential of zilebesiran to provide sustained blood pressure control, improve adherence to medication via infrequent dosing, and in turn, improve outcomes for people with high blood pressure.\"\n- \"Our study demonstrates that either quarterly or biannual doses of zilebesiran can effectively and safely lower blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\"\n\n## Study Limitations:\n\n- Only evaluated in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension\n- Results limited to the six-month placebo-controlled period\n- Longer-term safety and impact on cardiovascular outcomes will be assessed in future research\n\n## Context:\n\n- Presented as late-breaking science at American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023 (Nov. 11, 2023)\n- According to AHA's 2023 Statistical Update: nearly half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and heart disease is the #1 cause of death in the U.S.\n\n**Note:** The article does not provide specific numerical blood pressure reduction results, only stating that reductions occurred across all zilebesiran groups.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/alnylam-roche-hypertension-drug-study-results-zilebesiran/709303/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Alnylam, Roche blood pressure drug scores in second mid-stage trial\"\n\n**Publication Details:**\n- Source: BioPharma Dive\n- Date: March 5, 2024\n- Author: Jonathan Gardner, Senior Reporter\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Trial Results:** Zilebesiran, an experimental RNA-based medicine developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, showed statistically significant blood pressure reductions when added to standard drugs versus placebo in a Phase 2 trial (KARDIA-2) for people with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n2. **Partnership Details:** Roche paid Alnylam $310 million in 2023 to split rights to zilebesiran. Under the partnership, Roche will pay 60% of the costs for a definitive \"outcomes\" trial.\n\n3. **Drug Mechanism:** Zilebesiran is designed to suppress production of angiotensinogen, a protein involved in blood pressure regulation.\n\n4. **Previous Trial Success:** Zilebesiran succeeded in an earlier mid-stage trial in 2023 that evaluated multiple doses.\n\n5. **KARDIA-2 Trial Design:** Tested zilebesiran or placebo as add-on to three different types of marketed hypertension drugs. A single dose showed statistically significant blood pressure reductions at three months compared to standard therapies plus placebo.\n\n6. **New Trial:** A third Phase 2 trial has just started, enrolling 390 people with uncontrolled hypertension who are currently receiving two to four other therapies. Participants will receive a single dose and have blood pressure checked after three months. Data expected in 2025.\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Source):\n\n- **William Blair analyst Myles Minter** (in note to clients, March 5, 2024): Stated that cardiologists and regulators will likely want to see a blood pressure reduction of five points or more, which equates to a 10% reduction in lifetime relative risk of a cardiovascular event.\n\n## Notable Limitations:\n\n- The companies did not release detailed findings about the magnitude of zilebesiran's effects in KARDIA-2.\n- Full study results scheduled for presentation at American College of Cardiology meeting on April 7, 2024.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://journals.viamedica.pl/arterial_hypertension/article/view/98623\">\n# Summary of Article on Zilebesiran for Hypertension Treatment\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n1. **Hypertension prevalence:** The number of people aged 30-79 with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, reaching approximately 1.3 billion worldwide (626 million women and 652 million men in 2019).\n\n2. **Mortality impact:** In 2019, 10.8 million deaths were related to high systolic blood pressure, accounting for over 19% of all deaths.\n\n3. **Blood pressure reduction benefits:** Each 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP reduces cardiovascular event risk by 9% in primary prevention and 11% in secondary prevention.\n\n**Information About Zilebesiran:**\n\n1. **Development stage:** Zilebesiran is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials (KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2). It is described as \"the first drug based on small interference RNA (siRNA) technology for the treatment of hypertension.\"\n\n2. **Phase 1 results:** A single dose of zilebesiran resulted in sustained reduction of:\n   - Systolic BP by 22 mm Hg\n   - Diastolic BP by 10 mm Hg\n   - Duration: up to 6 months\n\n3. **Mechanism of action:** The drug works by silencing the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene in the liver, reducing serum AGT levels by >90%.\n\n4. **Safety profile:** In clinical trials, zilebesiran had a \"satisfactory safety profile and was well tolerated by patients.\"\n\n5. **Dosing frequency:** The drug would need to be taken only twice a year, which the author expects would improve patient compliance (adherence and persistence) with treatment.\n\n**Note:** This article is a scientific review/opinion piece by a single author (Stanis\u0142aw Surma) rather than a news report.

Information newly retrieved since the prior draft fills most of the previously noted gaps; residual gaps are flagged at the end.\n\nI. R&D AND CLINICAL-TRIAL TIMELINE  \n\u2022 2017-2018 \u2013 Discovery and naming as ALN-AGT.  Alnylam first showed pre-clinical knock-down data in R&D day slide decks (not captured in current public web results); primary-source confirmation remains pending.  \n\u2022 Apr-2019 (approx.) \u2013 Investigational New Drug (IND) application must have been cleared to allow the Phase 1 first-in-human study that started in 2019; however, the actual IND filing/clearance date is still not located (gap).  \n\u2022 2019-2021 \u2013 Phase 1 single-ascending-dose trial (Parts A/B/E).  Results were published in NEJM on 20 Jul 2023 and showed \u226590 % angiotensinogen knock-down and mean 24-hour SBP reductions up to \u221222 mm Hg lasting 24 weeks after a single 800-mg dose.  No serious drug-related safety signals emerged [Pace-cme summarising Desai et al., NEJM 2023].  \n\u2022 8 Jun 2022 \u2013 UK MHRA awards an \u201cInnovation Passport\u201d (entry to ILAP) to zilebesiran, signalling early regulator engagement and an accelerated UK review pathway [pharmaphorum, 2022].  \n\u2022 7 Sep 2023 \u2013 Alnylam and newly joined partner Roche report positive top-line data from KARDIA-1, a global Phase 2 dose-ranging monotherapy study in 394 patients.  Zilebesiran 300 mg and 600 mg Q6M achieved placebo-adjusted, 24-hour mean SBP reductions >15 mm Hg at Month 3 and sustained effects to Month 6; safety was \u201cencouraging\u201d [Roche release, 2023].  \n\u2022 11 Nov 2023 \u2013 Detailed KARDIA-1 data presented as late-breaking science at AHA Scientific Sessions confirm clinically meaningful and durable SBP lowering with both quarterly and twice-yearly dosing [American Heart Association newsroom, 2023].  \n\u2022 5 Mar 2024 \u2013 KARDIA-2 (672 patients) meets its primary endpoint: adding a single 600-mg dose of zilebesiran to background olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide produces significant SBP reductions at Month 3, again with a favourable safety profile [Roche release, 5 Mar 2024].  \n\u2022 30 Aug 2025 \u2013 KARDIA-3 (Cohort A, N = 270) in uncontrolled, high-risk patients on \u22652 antihypertensives reports that 300 mg Q6M yields \u22125.0 mm Hg office SBP at Month 3 (overall) and \u22129.2 mm Hg in the diuretic / baseline \u2265 140 mm Hg subgroup; 600 mg offers no incremental benefit.  The study guides the pivotal design [Roche release, 30 Aug 2025].  \n\u2022 30 Aug 2025 \u2013 Same day, Roche and Alnylam announce the decision to proceed to Phase 3 ZENITH, an 11 000-patient cardiovascular-outcome trial (CVOT) testing 300 mg Q6M vs placebo; protocol submitted to global regulators with start \u201cby year-end 2025\u201d [Roche release, 2025].  \n\u2022 17 Dec 2025 \u2013 FDA accepts Alnylam\u2019s siRELIS enzymatic-ligation manufacturing platform (used for zilebesiran) into its Emerging Technology Program, providing early CMC alignment ahead of licensure-enabling filings [Synapse/patsnap, 2025].  \n\u2022 Jan 2026 \u2013 Recruitment starts.  Applied Clinical Trials confirms \u201claunch\u201d of ZENITH on 29 Jan 2026 and reiterates the event-driven design (CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, HF events) [AppliedClinicalTrialsOnline, 29 Jan 2026].  The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier subsequently surfaced as NCT07181109 [PatLynk, accessed 2026].\n\nII. REGULATORY INTERACTIONS WITH FDA  \nDocumented:  \n1. IND cleared pre-2019 (implied by Phase 1 start) \u2013 exact date not yet sourced.  \n2. CMC: acceptance of siRELIS into FDA Emerging Technology Program, 17 Dec 2025 [Synapse].  \nUndocumented/Unverified:  \n\u2022 No press release, SEC filing or FDA letter confirms Fast-Track, Breakthrough, PRIME (EU) or similar designation for zilebesiran. Searches so far have not produced evidence of a U.S. expedited-review status (gap).  \n\u2022 No End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) Type C meeting minutes or pre-BLA/Type B interactions have been publicly disclosed (gap).\n\nIII. ALNYLAM PRESS RELEASE AND COMMUNICATION RECORD  \nKey company-issued announcements captured in the public domain (all dates through 29 Jan 2026):  \n\u2022 KARDIA-1 top-line (7 Sep 2023) \u2013 joint Roche/Alnylam release.  \n\u2022 KARDIA-2 top-line (5 Mar 2024) \u2013 joint release.  \n\u2022 Manufacturing/ETP (17 Dec 2025) \u2013 Business Wire release distributed by Alnylam.  \n\u2022 KARDIA-3 top-line & Phase 3 decision (30 Aug 2025) \u2013 joint release.  \n\u2022 ZENITH launch confirmation (29 Jan 2026) \u2013 reported in trade media quoting company statements.  \n\nIV. SEC FILINGS  \n\u2022 Form 10-K FY-2023, filed 15 Feb 2024 \u2013 lists KARDIA-2 as ongoing, cites zilebesiran as a \u201ckey pipeline driver,\u201d but states, \u201cWe have not yet determined the timing of any potential NDA submission\u201d [Last10K.com, 2024].  \n\u2022 Quarterly reports through Q3-2024 and the FY-2024 10-K (expected Feb 2025) are not yet in the results set; therefore, any updated regulatory-filing guidance they may contain remains unchecked (gap).  \n\u2022 No 8-K filings specific to the Aug-2025 Phase 3 decision were surfaced, although a Form 8-K would normally accompany material partnership developments.  \n\nV. EXPECTED NDA / BLA TIMELINE  \nNo public document retrieved to 29 Jan 2026 provides a projected NDA filing date.  Because ZENITH is an event-driven CVOT enrolling 11 000 patients, accrual of the requisite number of major adverse cardiovascular events is expected to take several years (typical hypertension CVOTs run 3\u20135 years).  Alnylam\u2019s SEC language continues to read \u201cdevelopment stage\u201d with \u201cNDA timing to be determined.\u201d  Conservatively, an NDA before 2030 appears unlikely unless interim-analysis criteria and surrogate-endpoint discussions with FDA alter the path.\n\nVI. CONSOLIDATED TIMELINE (dates inclusive)  \n\u2022 2017-18 \u2013 ALN-AGT discovery (primary source pending).  \n\u2022 2019 \u2013 IND clearance (date TBD) \u2192 Phase 1 first-in-human start.  \n\u2022 Jul 2023 \u2013 NEJM publication of Phase 1 data (study completed 2021).  \n\u2022 8 Jun 2022 \u2013 MHRA ILAP \u201cInnovation Passport\u201d.  \n\u2022 7 Sep 2023 \u2013 KARDIA-1 positive top-line.  \n\u2022 11 Nov 2023 \u2013 KARDIA-1 detailed presentation (AHA).  \n\u2022 5 Mar 2024 \u2013 KARDIA-2 top-line.  \n\u2022 30 Aug 2025 \u2013 KARDIA-3 top-line & go-decision for Phase 3.  \n\u2022 17 Dec 2025 \u2013 FDA Emerging Technology Program acceptance of siRELIS (CMC).  \n\u2022 Late Dec 2025 \u2013 ZENITH Phase 3 protocol submitted to regulators.  \n\u2022 29 Jan 2026 \u2013 ZENITH CVOT enrolment begins.  \n\u2022 NDA \u2013 no guidance as of 29 Jan 2026.\n\nVII. REMAINING INFORMATION GAPS  \n1. Exact IND submission and clearance dates.  \n2. Confirmation of any U.S. Fast-Track, Breakthrough-Therapy or Priority-Review designation.  \n3. FDA meeting minutes (pre-IND, EOP2, or Type C) that would illuminate regulatory strategy.  \n4. Full KARDIA-2 and KARDIA-3 peer-reviewed publications (only press-release summaries available).  \n5. Alnylam 10-Q (Q1\u2013Q3 2025) and 10-K FY-2024 / FY-2025 filings that might add NDA-timing language.  \n\nOverall, the publicly available data now provide a near-complete picture of zilebesiran\u2019s discovery, Phase 1, Phase 2 and early Phase 3 progress, plus at least one substantive FDA interaction on the manufacturing side.  Additional targeted retrieval of SEC filings (e.g., \u201csite:sec.gov ALNY 10-K 2025\u201d), FDA designation databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov history records would be required to close the residual gaps, particularly around expedited-review status and IND chronology.</Agent_report>\n"
