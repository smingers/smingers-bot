Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Summaries (KSAT, The Diplomat, Vatican News - January 27, 2026):**
- **Quality:** High - Multiple independent news sources reporting same events
- **Date:** January 27-28, 2026 (current/recent)
- **Key Facts:** North Korea launched ballistic missiles on January 27, 2026 (~350km range). This was the second test in January 2026 (first on January 4). Articles explicitly state: "Pyongyang has not crossed the red line – conducting a seventh nuclear test" and note the country "appears to be intent on beefing up its nuclear capabilities further."
- **Opinion vs Fact:** Factual missile launch data; expert speculation about future intentions.

**Hans India (November 5, 2025):**
- **Quality:** Medium - Reports South Korean Defense Intelligence Agency assessment
- **Date:** November 5, 2025 (3 months old)
- **Key Facts:** South Korean intelligence assesses North Korea "ready to promptly conduct its 7th nuclear test if leader Kim Jong-un decides to proceed" using Tunnel No. 3 at Punggye-ri.
- **Opinion vs Fact:** This is an intelligence assessment (expert opinion from identifiable source: ROK Defense Intelligence Agency) stating readiness, not imminent action.

**BBC (March 8, 2022):**
- **Quality:** High - Established news source with satellite imagery analysis
- **Date:** March 8, 2022 (nearly 4 years old)
- **Key Facts:** Satellite imagery showed "very early signs of activity" at Punggye-ri including construction. Analysts noted it could take "months, if not years" before site ready.
- **Relevance:** Historical context only; subsequent sources confirm site has been ready since 2020-2022.

**CSIS Beyond Parallel (January 18, 2024):**
- **Quality:** High - Specialized Korea analysis with satellite imagery
- **Date:** January 18, 2024 (1 year old)
- **Key Facts:** Recent activity shows "typical facility caretaker maintenance." Assessment: "The recent activity does not suggest imminent preparations for a seventh nuclear test."
- **Expert Opinion:** Clear identifiable expert assessment that maintenance ≠ imminent test preparation.

**AskNews Articles (January 27-28, 2026):**
- **Quality:** High - Multiple international sources reporting same event
- **Date:** January 27-28, 2026 (current)
- **Key Facts:** Kim Jong-un announced plans to reveal "next step" in nuclear deterrence at upcoming Workers' Party Congress (scheduled February 2026). Recent missile test of "large-caliber multiple rocket launcher" (4 missiles, 358km range). Kim emphasized this is about strengthening deterrence, not initiating conflict.
- **Expert Opinion:** Lee Ho-ryung (Korea Institute for Defense Analyses) expects Kim to "declare that North Korea's nuclear capability has now reached its peak" - suggesting focus on operational capability rather than testing.
- **Critical Detail:** IAEA article (December 25, 2025) states: "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports no evidence of preparations for new nuclear tests."

**North Korean Media Reports (January 27-28, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Medium-High - Direct statements from Kim Jong-un via KCNA
- **Key Facts:** Kim supervised rocket launcher test, stated purpose is "strengthening nuclear deterrence" and that building "reliable offensive capabilities" is "constant line of national defense policy." He will reveal plans at February 2026 congress.
- **Interpretation:** These are political statements about strategic direction, not announcements of imminent nuclear tests.

**Satellite/Technical Reports (November-December 2025):**
- **Quality:** High - Technical analysis with specific details
- **Date:** November-December 2025 (1-2 months old)
- **Key Facts:** Upgrades to missile engine testing facilities (horizontal test platform for solid-fuel engines, new shelter installed late November 2024). Activity near vertical platform for liquid-fuel engines.
- **Relevance:** These relate to missile development, not nuclear testing at Punggye-ri.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against Near-Term Test:**
1. **IAEA Assessment (December 25, 2025):** "No evidence of preparations for new nuclear tests" - This is the most authoritative monitoring body, with recent assessment (5 weeks ago). This is strong negative evidence.
2. **CSIS Analysis (January 2024):** Only "caretaker maintenance" observed, "does not suggest imminent preparations" - Specialized monitoring group with satellite imagery expertise.
3. **Historical Pattern:** 110+ months without testing despite technical readiness since 2020-2022 demonstrates strong revealed preference against testing.

**Moderate Evidence Against Near-Term Test:**
1. **Kim's Recent Statements (January 27-28, 2026):** Focus on "strengthening deterrence" and revealing plans at February congress suggests strategic announcement rather than imminent test. If test were planned for next 3 months, unlikely to preview at congress first.
2. **Short Timeframe:** 92 days represents only 25% of year; historically low testing period (winter/early spring).
3. **Expert Assessment Context:** Lee Ho-ryung suggests Kim will declare nuclear capability has "reached its peak" - implies focus on operational deployment rather than additional testing.

**Moderate Evidence For Potential Test:**
1. **ROK Intelligence (November 2025):** Assessment that test could occur "promptly" if Kim decides, using Tunnel No. 3. However, this states capability, not intent or imminent indicators.
2. **Workers' Party Congress (February 2026):** Major political event where Kim will reveal "next step" - could theoretically include test announcement, though more likely policy direction.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Recent missile tests - These are routine and don't correlate with nuclear testing historically.
2. Facility maintenance - Maintaining readiness ≠ imminent use.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 29, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **92 days** (3.0 months)

**If Halved (46 days / 1.5 months):**
Would reduce probability to ~5-6%. Even shorter window makes political decision + final preparations + execution highly unlikely, especially with no current indicators.

**If Doubled (184 days / 6 months):**
Would increase probability to ~18-22%. Longer window allows for: February congress decisions to materialize, geopolitical developments to shift calculus, and more time for preparation indicators to emerge if test planned.

**Timeframe Sensitivity:** The probability is moderately sensitive to timeframe because:
- No imminent indicators exist now
- Political decision appears to be the binding constraint, not technical readiness
- Longer windows allow more opportunities for political calculus to shift

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate:** 12% (for this 92-day window)

**Current Information Impact:**

**Downward Pressure (-3 to -5 percentage points):**

1. **IAEA "No Evidence" Statement (December 25, 2025):** This is critical new information not available in outside view analysis. The authoritative monitoring body seeing no preparations 5 weeks ago is strong negative evidence. The IAEA has satellite monitoring, seismic networks, and intelligence sharing - their assessment carries significant weight.

2. **Kim's Strategic Messaging (January 27-28, 2026):** The framing of "revealing next step at February congress" suggests policy announcements rather than imminent action. Historically, North Korea announces tests after conducting them, not before. Previewing strategic direction at congress suggests longer-term planning horizon.

3. **Expert Interpretation Shift:** Lee Ho-ryung's assessment that Kim will declare capability has "reached its peak" implies shifting from development phase (which required testing) to operational deployment phase (which doesn't).

**Upward Pressure (+1 to +2 percentage points):**

1. **February Congress as Catalyst:** Major political event could theoretically serve as backdrop for test, though timing would be unusual (tests typically follow major announcements, not precede them).

2. **Maintained Readiness:** ROK intelligence confirms capability exists and can be executed "promptly" - reduces technical barriers if political decision made.

**Net Assessment:**
The IAEA's recent "no evidence" statement is the most significant new information. This isn't just absence of evidence - it's the authoritative monitoring body explicitly stating they see no preparations. Combined with Kim's strategic messaging suggesting policy announcements rather than imminent tests, this warrants downward adjustment.

However, the maintained capability and upcoming political event prevent adjustment to very low probabilities. The 9-year pattern of restraint could theoretically break at any time if political calculus shifts.

**Adjustment:** -3 percentage points from 12% baseline

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 12% for this 92-day window:

**Downward adjustments:**
- IAEA "no evidence" statement (December 2025): -2%
- Kim's strategic messaging framing (January 2026): -1%
- Expert interpretation of "peak capability" rhetoric: -0.5%

**Upward adjustments:**
- February congress as potential catalyst: +1%
- Maintained technical readiness: +0.5%

**Net adjustment:** -2%

**Calibrated probability:** 10%

This reflects:
- Technical capability exists and is maintained (high confidence)
- No current indicators of imminent test (high confidence from IAEA)
- Strong 9-year pattern of restraint despite capability (high confidence)
- Short 92-day window in historically low-testing period (moderate confidence)
- Political calculus could shift, but no evidence it has (moderate confidence)

10% represents roughly 1-in-10 odds. This acknowledges meaningful possibility given maintained capability and upcoming political events, while reflecting the strong evidence against imminent testing and the persistent pattern of restraint.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test between January 29 and May 1, 2026 (92 days), confirmed by credible sources like CTBTO/IAEA?

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view established 12% for this window; inside view calibrates to 10% based on recent IAEA assessment and Kim's strategic messaging - modest downward adjustment rooted in new evidence.

3. **Consistency check:** "10 out of 100 times in similar 3-month windows with maintained capability but no imminent indicators and 9-year restraint pattern, North Korea conducts a nuclear test." This seems reasonable given the tension between capability and demonstrated restraint.

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - IAEA stated "no evidence of preparations" as of December 25, 2025 (verified, authoritative)
   - ROK intelligence confirms Tunnel No. 3 ready but states capability, not intent (verified, November 2025)
   - Kim's January 27-28 statements frame "next step" as February congress announcement (verified, multiple sources)
   - 110+ month gap since last test despite 4+ years of technical readiness (verified, historical fact)
   - CSIS analysis shows only maintenance activity, not preparation signatures (verified, January 2024)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Rapid geopolitical crisis (e.g., major US-China confrontation, collapse of Russia-Ukraine situation, acute Korean Peninsula tension) could shift Kim's calculus dramatically. A test could serve as demonstration of resolve or bargaining chip. This scenario could push probability to 25-30%, but no current indicators suggest such crisis is imminent.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is "no test" - this has been the state for 110+ months. Given world changes slowly and this 92-day window is brief, status quo bias supports the 10% probability. The volatility is moderate (upcoming congress, geopolitical uncertainty) but not extreme.

Probability: 10%
