Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CRS chronology (thru Mar 2020) – Factual recap of the 2016-20 cycle: six nuclear tests by 2017, moratorium announced 2018, renewed short-range missile testing 2019-20.  High-quality, non-partisan; no opinions about future tests.  
2. Columbia Law School page – No substantive data; ignored.  
3. Arms Control Association chronology (to 2022) – Reliable factual timeline of diplomacy; opinion that Pyongyang “dramatically increased” missile tests after 2021.  Good quality; little forward-looking judgment.  
4. Defence Post 26 Aug 2025 – Reports SK President Lee’s claim DPRK can build 10-20 bombs/yr.  Statement by head of state (credible for capabilities, less so for intentions).  No direct prediction of a test.  
5. Newsweek 2024 article (citing 38 North, IAEA, Pacific Forum) – Factual imagery of Yongbyon expansion.  Expert opinion (Alberque) that a “statement” test could occur “within the next year”.  Mixed reporting/opinion; imagery data are solid, speculative timing is expert conjecture.  
6. CSIS/Beyond Parallel 18 Jan 2024 – Detailed satellite analysis of Punggye-ri.  Authors (Bermudez/Cha) judge site is ready but see “no indication of imminent preparations”.  High technical credibility.  
7. Agent report (synthesises CTBTO, IAEA, 38 North, think-tank briefs) – Accurate historical test list; captures consensus that technical readiness exists while decision is political.  Uses named expert sources; suitable.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “All months 2006-2025” (240 months, 6 tests) → base monthly event rate 2.5 %; 3-month window ≈ 7.4 %.  
2. “Active testing period 2006-2017” (132 months, 6 tests) → 3-month window ≈ 13.6 %.  Probably overstates current risk because we have been in a nine-year pause.  
3. “Years following a pause ≥ 4 yrs” (only one precedent: first test in 2006 after a decades-long pause) – sample too small.  

Class 1 best matches today’s context (long dormant phase included) and has a reasonable sample size.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 29 Jan → 01 May 2026 = 93 days ≈ 0.25 yr.  
In nine calendar years since the last detonation (2018-2026 YTD), zero nuclear tests occurred, implying an empirical annual rate ≤ 0.11 (1 event would have produced 0.11/yr).  A Poisson rate of 0.05 - 0.10 per year is consistent with observing zero events over nine years (35-59 % likelihood).  With λ ≈ 0.08 yr⁻¹, the outside-view probability in 0.25 yr is 1 – e^(-0.02) ≈ 2 %.  

Seasonality check: historical test months – Jan, Feb, May, Sep(x2), Oct.  Two of six tests (33 %) happened in the upcoming Jan-Apr window, slightly above uniform expectation (4/12 ≈ 33 %), so no strong seasonal effect.

(d) Justification  
• The only robust statistic is frequency: 6 tests in 20 years, none for the last 8.4 years.  
• Expert commentary agrees that capability exists but finds no preparatory activity signalling an imminent blast (CSIS 2024; IAEA 2025).  
• Political incentives (validate new warheads, leverage U.S. election outcome) are cited, yet these are qualitative and have failed to trigger a test for almost a decade.  
• Given the very short 3-month horizon, even a relatively “high” annual hazard (say 10 %) still converts to a small absolute probability (< 3 %).  
• No market-based odds are available to anchor on, so the empirical base rate dominates the outside view.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline using reference class 1: 7 - 8 % (3-month window over 2006-2025).  
Adjustment for nine-year hiatus (empirical λ ≈ 0.05-0.10) pushes figure down to 2 - 3 %.  
Mild upward tweak (+1 ppt) for the fact that technical readiness is confirmed (raises hazard slightly compared with an average post-2017 month).  
Resulting calibrated outside-view probability: 4 %.

Outside View Prediction:
4 %
