Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological/high-utility selection)

1. KSAT/AP & The Diplomat (27 Jan 2026) – real-time reporting of short-range ballistic-missile launches.  Factual flight data are reliable (military radars; AP, The Diplomat have good fact-checking).  No mention of nuclear-test activity; expert comments (“Pyongyang has not crossed the red line”) are informed opinion but not primary evidence.

2. January-2026 “Asknews” packet – multiple KCNA-based stories on Kim’s 27-28 Jan missile demonstration and promise to unveil the “next step” in nuclear deterrence at the Workers’ Party congress (early Feb).  KCNA is primary for regime intent statements but heavily propagandistic; facts such as launch timing/number corroborated by ROK/Japan radars → factual.  Intent statements are weak-to-moderate evidence unless echoed by independent imagery.

3. IAEA DG Grossi interview (25 Dec 2025) – states the agency sees “no sign of nuclear-test preparations.”  Source is highly reliable; message is a snapshot six weeks old.

4. DAPA/South-Korean intelligence brief to parliament (5 Nov 2025) – “Tunnel 3 ready, test could occur quickly if Kim decides.”  Government intelligence: methodology undisclosed, but historically accurate on technical readiness.  Indicates capability, not intent.

5. Beyond Parallel / CSIS imagery report (18 Jan 2024) – routine maintenance at Punggye-ri, no imminent signatures.  High-quality, named imagery analysts.

Overall: we have high-confidence evidence of (i) sustained technical readiness, (ii) recent political rhetoric, (iii) continued absence (as yet) of the distinct pre-test logistics surge usually seen days–weeks before a shot.

(b) Evidence analysis (graded)

Strong-positive
• Re-opened, maintained Tunnel 3; multiple independent intel bodies (ROK DIA, U.S. IC, CSIS) concur that the site can support a test on short notice.  (Structural, hard to reverse.)

Moderate-positive
• Political window: first Workers’ Party congress in 5 yrs (early Feb).  Historical pattern (2013, 2016) of using high-profile domestic events to frame nuclear tests.
• 2026 uptick in missile activity (two salvos in January) – typical pre-nuclear-test signalling cycle.

Moderate-negative
• IAEA & open-source imagery up to late-Dec-2025 show no preparatory activity; previous six tests all displayed 7-14 days of intensified movement (fresh spoil piles, cables, larger security perimeter).

Weak-positive
• Kim’s KCNA pledge to announce “next-stage nuclear deterrence”—ambiguous; might refer to doctrinal change or delivery-system focus rather than an underground blast.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days remaining: 92 (≈3.0 months).  Halving window to 46 days would cut probability materially (to ~25 %) because logistic/communications activity would need to begin almost immediately to meet historic prep timelines.  Doubling window to 6 months (to 1 Aug 2026) would raise probability to ~55 %, as technical readiness would persist and additional political triggers could arise.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view (40 %) was calibrated from: six DPRK tests in 20 yrs (annual base ≈30 %), adjusted upward for eight-year hiatus + intelligence assessment of readiness.

Inside-view shifts:
+0.15 odds factor (party-congress & January missile tempo)  
−0.12 odds factor (no satellite/IAEA signs within 2 weeks of congress; historic logistic signatures missing)  
Net: negligible change.  The decisive variable is Kim’s political calculus, for which current public data give mixed signals.  Absent fresh imagery in the next fortnight, likelihood declines quickly.

Probability calibration
Using the above updates I estimate the odds at 0.64, i.e.:

Probability: 39 %

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will DPRK detonate a nuclear device before 00:00 UTC 1 May 2026?”  
2. Base rate – 30 %/yr ⇒ 10 %/quarter, uplifted to 40 % for post-2018 context & readiness.  
3. Consistency – “In ~39 of 100 similar 3-month windows, a DPRK test would occur.”  
4. Key evidence (i) Tunnel 3 test-ready; (ii) Party congress Feb 2026; (iii) Jan missile surge; (iv) IAEA sees no prep; (v) historic 7–14 day activity absent.  
5. Blind-spot – Kim orders a “zero-notice” test using stockpiled gear, evading typical prep signatures.  Would push probability >70 %.  
6. Status-quo – Eight-year pause persists; inertia favors “no test,” hence slight lean toward lower than outside-view.

Probability: 39%
