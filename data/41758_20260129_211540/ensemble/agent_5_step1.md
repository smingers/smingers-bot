Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CRS “North Korea Chronology 2016-2020” (U.S. Congressional Research Service – non-partisan, factual).  
   • Facts: six DPRK nuclear tests between 2006-2017; none after 2017 (through Mar-2020).  
   • Opinions: author’s suggestion that the “diplomatic phase may be ending”; we treat as context only.  
   • Quality: high – CRS is widely cited and footnoted.  

2. Columbia Law School webpage stub – no factual content → ignored.  

3. Arms Control Association chronology, 1985-2022 (NGO with long track-record).  
   • Facts: confirms six test dates, describes cycles of diplomacy vs. testing.  
   • Opinions: “Pyongyang continues to stonewall” (editorial); excluded from quantitative work.  
   • Quality: good for dates/events; neutral standpoint.  

4. The Defense Post, 26 Aug 2025.  
   • Facts: S. Korean President claims DPRK can now produce 10-20 warheads/yr; arsenal ≈ 50.  
   • Opinions: presidential assessment that sanctions “failed” – we treat cautiously.  
   • Quality: moderate; relies on political statement rather than independent verification.  

5. Newsweek, 2024.  
   • Facts: 38 North imagery shows Yongbyon expansion; “Punggye-ri remains prepared”.  
   • Opinions: analysts Alberque/Yeo speculate a “statement test”; clearly labelled as expert views.  
   • Quality: mixed (secondary journalism) but cites respected imagery outfit 38 North.  

6. CSIS / Beyond Parallel, 18 Jan 2024.  
   • Facts: low-level activity at Punggye-ri; tunnel 3 ready since 2020.  
   • Opinion: authors judge no “imminent” test.  
   • Quality: high – primary imagery analysts with public methodology.  

7. Agent report (synthesises CTBTO, IAEA, 38 North, CSIS, think-tank papers up to mid-2025).  
   • Facts: CTBTO yields, tunnel status, IAEA statement that site “remains prepared”.  
   • Opinions: multiple expert probability statements (e.g., “high-risk window”).  
   • Quality: good aggregation; individual claims traceable to reputable bodies.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. “Any DPRK nuclear test in a given calendar quarter” (since first test, Q4-2006 → Q4-2025 = 81 quarters; 6 tests). Base rate = 6/81 ≈ 7.4 %.  
2. “Any DPRK nuclear test in a 92-day window” (match remaining horizon). Because tests are discrete events, quarter-length approximation suffices; exact 92-day window gives same order of magnitude.  
3. More recent phase only (2018-2025): 0 tests in 32 quarters → 0 % base.  
Assessment: Class 1 is broader and avoids over-fitting to the 2018-2025 pause; Class 3 probably understates true risk because technical capability & strategic incentives persist. Class 1 taken as primary outside-view reference.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining until resolution: 29 Jan → 1 May 2026 = 92 days ≈ 0.25 years.  
Historical pattern: 6 tests spread unevenly—clusters (2016-2017, two tests in nine months) followed by long gaps (2017-2026, >8 years so far). Poisson assumption from Class 1 (λ ≈ 0.295 tests/yr) yields expected tests in next 0.25 yr: λt ≈ 0.074 → baseline probability ≈ 7.1 %. (e–λt ≈ 0.928; 1 – that ≈ 0.072).  

(d) Justification  
• Base-rate calculation (7 %) provides an objective starting point.  
• Temporal clustering indicates positive contagion (tests tend to come in spurts). Because we are 8+ years into a lull, hazard rate may be lower than the 2006-2025 mean. That argues for nudging the baseline slightly downward.  
• Conversely, technical readiness (Tunnel 3 restored, IAEA & CTBTO statements that the site is “prepared”) shows capacity is available; this pushes against lowering the figure too much but is already partly reflected in the long-run average (since DPRK generally keeps the ability to test).  
• The 92-day window is short compared with typical political lead-times between signalling and an actual underground detonation (past tests were usually preceded by weeks of detectable preparations). CSIS imagery as late as Jan 2024 found no “imminent” signs; no newer imagery showing last-minute work is in the record. That makes a test in the next three months less likely than the quarter average.  
• No expert source cited places a specific probability on “by May 2026”; qualitative wording ranges from “distinct possibility” to “high-risk window,” which is compatible with anything between ~15-50 % over a multi-year span—not directly applicable to a 3-month slice.  

Balancing these, I lower the Poisson baseline modestly to account for the ongoing lull and the absence of immediate test-site activity, yielding an outside-view estimate just under the raw 7 %.  

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: Poisson base rate ≈ 7 %.  
Adjustments:  
– Lack of short-term activity (-1 pp)  
– Tunnel 3 technically ready (+0.5 pp)  
Net ≈ 6.5 %. Round to the nearest whole percent to reflect 1 % resolution.  

Outside View Prediction:
6 % chance that North Korea will conduct a nuclear test before 1 May 2026.
