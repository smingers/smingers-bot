Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, newest first – dates UTC)

1. KSAT/AP 27 Jan 2026 – Factual report of SRBM launches; no nuclear-test activity mentioned.  High-quality wire service; purely descriptive (facts).  
2. The Diplomat 27 Jan 2026 – Same launch, adds analysts’ opinion that DPRK “has not crossed the red line of a 7th nuclear test.”  Authoritative niche outlet; analysts unnamed → opinion moderate-weight.  
3. Vatican News 27 Jan 2026 – Duplicate facts on missile launch; no nuclear test data.  Reliable but secondary.  
4. Ten AskNews items 27-28 Jan 2026 – Quotes KCNA about unveiling “next-stage nuclear plans” at February WPK congress.  Facts: missile test & rhetoric; Opinions: Kim’s threats, Lee Ho-ryung’s view that capability “has peaked.”  All state-media-driven; quality moderate, rhetoric prone to exaggeration.  
5. IAEA interview 25 Dec 2025 – Director-General Grossi: “no signs of preparations for new nuclear tests.”  Strong, identifiable expert statement.  
6. South-Korean Defence Intel leaks 5 Nov 2025 (multiple outlets) – DPRK “ready to test quickly if Kim orders.”  Primary intel but via political briefing → moderate quality; possible bias toward threat inflation.  
7. CSIS/Beyond Parallel imagery 18 Jan 2024 – Low-level caretaker activity at Punggye-ri; “does not suggest imminent test.”  Public method, high quality but 1 yr old.  
Earlier historical sources (CRS, Arms Control, etc.) only used for base rate.

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong-weight evidence against near-term test  
  – IAEA (Grossi) finds no test preparation (independent, technical).  
  – No open-source imagery (public or allied) showing spoil piles, new tunnel sealing, or cable runs normally seen weeks before past tests.  
• Moderate-weight evidence for higher risk  
  – SK intelligence: tunnel #3 ready, test can happen “in a short time.”  
  – Political calendar: first WPK congress in 5 yr (early Feb 2026) gives incentive for dramatic act.  
  – Eight-year test lull increases pressure to prove credibility.  
• Weak evidence both ways  
  – Kim’s bellicose rhetoric in KCNA (routine).  
  – Missile launch tempo (correlates weakly with nuclear tests historically).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time left: 92 days.  If the window were halved (46 d) I’d drop the probability roughly 40 % (to ~5 %).  If doubled (184 d) I would add ~3-4 pp (to ~12 %), assuming hazard rate roughly constant once beyond May.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view Poisson base rate for any 92-day window 2006-2025 = 7 %.  
−1 pp: Eight-year lull suggests lower baseline hazard.  
+1 pp: Political “show-piece” event (Feb congress).  
+1 pp: Tunnel #3 technically ready; SK intel claims rapid execution possible.  
−0.5 pp: IAEA sees no preparatory activity; historic tests show visible work ≥3-4 weeks beforehand.  
Net shift ≈ +1 pp → 8 % rounded.  This means: 8 of 100 similar windows would see a DPRK nuclear test.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that North Korea detonates a nuclear device (confirmed by CTBTO/IAEA) before 00:00 UTC 1 May 2026: 8 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will DPRK carry out a confirmed nuclear test between now (29 Jan 2026) and 1 May 2026?”  
2. Base rate 92-day window: 7 %.  
3. Consistency: “8 out of 100 times, DPRK would test in the next 92 days.” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • IAEA sees no preparations (−).  
   • Tunnel #3 long-ready per SK intel (+).  
   • Feb-26 party congress creates incentive (+).  
   • No fresh imagery of site activity (−).  
   • 8-year hiatus lowers hazard (−).  
5. Blind-spot: Covert new tunnel tested with minimal external prep, defeating commercial imagery; would raise real odds above 20 %.  
6. Status-quo: No test since 2017; inertia favours “No.”  Short window reinforces.

Probability: 8%
