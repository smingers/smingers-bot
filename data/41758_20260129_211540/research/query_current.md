Analysis:
North Korea has not conducted an underground nuclear explosion since September 2017, but multiple intelligence and commercial-satellite reports since 2022 indicate intermittent excavation and restoration work at the Punggye-ri test site, especially at the previously unused Tunnel 3 (and activity at Tunnel 4 in 2024-Q4).  Throughout 2025, South Korean and U.S. officials repeated assessments that the DPRK was technically “ready to test at any time.”  However, no test occurred, possibly because Pyongyang prioritized ballistic-missile demonstrations (solid-fuel ICBMs and SLBMs) and sought to avoid crossing China’s and Russia’s informal red lines while securing sanctions relief.  
Key things to look for in the very latest coverage (January 2026):  
• Fresh satellite imagery (Maxar, Planet, 38 North, CSIS Beyond Parallel) showing whether new spoil piles, snow melt patterns, or increased vehicle traffic imply an imminent test.  
• Statements from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff or the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command about abnormal seismic events or venting activity.  
• CTBTO/IMS waveform or radionuclide station alerts or comments.  
• Diplomatic context: any upcoming U.S.–ROK exercises, UNSC deliberations, or DPRK constitutional or Party-plenum dates that might serve as trigger points for a demonstration.  
Up-to-the-minute articles and expert commentary published in January 2026 will therefore be most informative for assessing whether a test is likely in the remaining three months before the May 1, 2026 deadline.
