Analysis:
To estimate the likelihood that the DPRK will conduct a nuclear test before 1 May 2026 I need a sound outside-view baseline: 1) how frequently North Korea has tested in the past and under what circumstances; 2) observable signs that preceded earlier tests (e.g., activity at Punggye-ri); 3) evidence of recent tunnel restoration, fissile-material production, or official statements hinting at an imminent test.  Historical coverage of the six nuclear tests from 2006-2017, reports by the CTBTO and IAEA on North Korea’s capabilities, plus 2022-2026 satellite imagery analyses by 38 North / CSIS will provide the most relevant context.  Therefore I first need general historical timelines, then the latest reportage on test-site activity, and finally a synthesized technical overview.
