According to state media KCNA, Kim Jong Un stated the congress would clarify plans to strengthen the country's nuclear deterrent. This follows a recent test on January 27, 2026, of a 'large-caliber multiple rocket launcher' that fired four projectiles, reaching a target over 358 kilometers away, as reported by KCNA.

Kim Jong Un described the test as 'of great importance' for enhancing strategic deterrence and warned that the results would cause 'deep moral suffering' and pose a serious threat to any force attempting military confrontation. This test marked the second missile launch by Pyongyang in January 2026, following a salvo on January 4, shortly before the South Korean president\u2019s departure for a summit in China. The recent surge in military testing is seen by analysts as aimed at improving precision strike capabilities, challenging U.S. and South Korean deterrence, and potentially preparing for arms exports to Russia.

The test involved four rockets that struck a maritime target 358.5 km from the launch site, according to the Korean Workers' Party newspaper. Kim Jong-un emphasized that the test was significant for enhancing strategic deterrence, stating that the system's new features\u2014such as improved mobility, intelligence, precision, and autonomous guidance\u2014make it highly effective for special attack use. He claimed that no other nation will match this technology in the near future, asserting that the test demonstrates North Korea's advanced military capabilities. Kim reiterated that the purpose of these developments is to strengthen nuclear deterrence, not to initiate conflict. He warned that the test would be a 'serious concern' for any military adversary, as the system possesses 'extremely destructive and massive attack capabilities' for deterrence. The test is seen as part of preparations for the upcoming 9th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, expected in February 2026, which will set the country's political direction for the next five years. The launch was detected by South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, which reported the missile flew approximately 350 km. Experts, including Hong Min of the Korea Institute for National Unification and Lim Eul-chul of Kyungnam University, interpreted the 358.5 km range as capable of reaching key South Korean military bases, including the 3rd Army Headquarters in Gyeongju, and noted the precision in reporting the distance as a psychological warfare tactic. Kim Jong-un was accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju-ae, Kim Jong-sik, First Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party Central Committee, and Jang Chang-ha, Director of the Missile General Bureau.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:35 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260128_0003492640)\n\n**North Korea Reports Test Launch of Upgraded Rocket Artillery, Kim Jong-un Highlights Enhanced Nuclear Deterrence**\nNorth Korean state media reported on January 28, 2026, that Kim Jong-un personally attended the test launch of an upgraded large-caliber multiple rocket launcher (referred to as a 'rocket artillery' system) on January 27, 2026, over the East Sea. According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the test involved four projectiles that struck a maritime target 358.5 km away. The launch was described as a verification of the new system's effectiveness, with Kim Jong-un emphasizing that the upgraded system's autonomous precision guidance, mobility, intelligence, and accuracy have been significantly enhanced. He stated that the system's technological advancements make it uniquely superior and that no other nation will match this capability in the near future. Kim declared that the purpose of these activities is to further strengthen North Korea's nuclear deterrence. The test launch also featured Kim\u2019s daughter, Ju-ae, alongside senior officials including Kim Jong-sik, First Vice Minister of the Workers' Party's Military Industry Department, and Jang Chang-ha, Director of the Missile General Bureau. The event is widely interpreted as a strategic move to demonstrate military progress ahead of the upcoming 9th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, expected in February 2026, and to reinforce internal unity. It may also reflect North Korea's response to recent U.S. defense strategy shifts, including the new National Defense Strategy (NDS) that emphasizes South Korea\u2019s expanded defense responsibilities. The South Korean military confirmed the launch of a missile approximately 350 km, which was assessed as a 600mm super-large caliber rocket artillery system.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:24 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202601280824001)\n\n**North Korea Confirms Test Launch of Large-Caliber Multiple Rocket Launcher System**\nNorth Korea confirmed on January 27, 2026, the successful test launch of a large-caliber multiple rocket launcher system into the Sea of Japan, conducted the previous day to verify its 'effectiveness.'

Kim Jong Un, accompanied by senior officials, conducted a test firing of a large-caliber multiple rocket launcher, launching four missiles that reached a target over 358 km away, according to him. The missiles were fired toward the Sea of Japan, with two landing outside North Korea\u2019s exclusive economic zone, as reported by Japan\u2019s Jiji Press citing defense ministry sources. Kim declared the test 'of great importance' for enhancing the country\u2019s strategic deterrence, stating the results would inflict 'deep moral suffering and serious threats' on any forces attempting military confrontation. This marked the second missile test in January, following a salvo hours before the South Korean president\u2019s departure for China for a summit. The test occurred the day after a high-level visit to Seoul by Elbridge Colby, the third-highest-ranking official at the U.S. Pentagon, who praised South Korea as a 'model ally.' North Korea has intensified missile testing in recent years, with analysts suggesting these tests aim to improve precision strike capabilities, challenge the U.S. and South Korea, and potentially prepare for arms exports to Russia.

Analysis by the South Korean news site 'NK Pro', based on images from Planet Labs, shows the installation of a new expandable shelter over the horizontal test platform for solid-fuel rocket engines. The shelter, installed in late November 2024, consists of three sliding layers that allow the front section to retract, enabling full access to the test area and easier engine loading compared to the previous fixed concrete structure. Construction began in early October, shortly after North Korea announced completion of the ninth and final test of a high-thrust solid-fuel engine made from carbon-fiber composite materials. The new shelter now covers most of the platform, offering full protection to personnel during preparation. This development follows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s September 2024 visit to a research lab, where he confirmed the new engine is ready for use in the intercontinental ballistic missiles 'Hwasong-19' and 'Hwasong-20'. While Hwasong-19 has been successfully tested once in October 2024, Hwasong-20 has not yet been tested, suggesting the upgrades may be part of preparations for its first launch. The South Korean site also speculates the changes could relate to new engines for a potential 'Hwasong-21' missile, smaller engines for second and third stages, or the long-standing goal of developing a sea-launched intercontinental missile, a project still unrealized since 2021. Additionally, satellite images show new activity near a vertical test platform for liquid-fuel engines, including a new access road and a fuel/oxidizer storage building, indicating ongoing work and possible testing related to North Korea\u2019s struggling military satellite launch program. A large red truck seen near the vertical platform on December 9, 2025, resembling one used during Kim\u2019s 2017 test, strengthens the likelihood of imminent tests.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 05:12 PM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5303118)\n\n**Suspicious Rocket Tests in North Korea: Satellites Reveal the Truth**\nRecent satellite images reveal extensive updates to North Korea's long-range ballistic missile engine testing facilities, indicating preparations for further missile tests.
