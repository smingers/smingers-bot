Stated that previous efforts to deter North Korea and apply sanctions have failed to stop nuclear program development\n  - Characterized himself as implementing a \"dovish\" approach compared to his predecessor\n  - Indicated South Korea is committed to conventional weapons deterrence\n  - Noted his efforts to ease provocative measures, such as ending loudspeaker broadcasts across the military frontier\n\n- **President Donald Trump:** Expressed hope to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again\n\n## Context:\n\nThe statements were made during President Lee's visit to the United States and after talks with President Trump.\n\n**Note:** This article does not directly address whether a nuclear test is planned or likely, but provides context on North Korea's nuclear weapons production capabilities and stockpile.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-expanding-major-nuclear-site-analysts-11096983\">\n# Summary of Article: \"North Korea 'expanding' major nuclear site: Analysts\"\n\n## Key Facts and Measurements:\n\n1. **Yongbyon Nuclear Site Expansion**: Satellite imagery shows North Korea expanded construction at the Yongbyon nuclear site over the past two months (according to 38 North project analysts from the Stimson Center nonprofit).\n\n2. **Nuclear Material Capacity**: Experts estimate Pyongyang likely has enough highly enriched nuclear material for up to 90 nuclear bombs and is thought to have assembled 50 nuclear weapons.\n\n3. **Site Infrastructure**: \n   - Yongbyon hosts a 5 megawatt power nuclear reactor\n   - An experimental light-water reactor is being built but not yet operational\n   - Six heat exchanges (needed to cool centrifuges) have been installed since September near the main building of a suspected enrichment site\n   - A vehicle shed has been added and an enclosed passageway now connects buildings\n\n4. **Recent Activity**: A suspected uranium enrichment site at Yongbyon \"has become the most active since the start of 2025\" (according to 38 North analysts).\n\n5. **Historical Context**: \n   - UN Security Council has leveled sanctions at North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs since 2006\n   - North Korea is the only country that has carried out full nuclear tests this century\n   - Last nuclear test mentioned indirectly (article doesn't specify when North Korea last tested)\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **William Alberque** (former head of NATO's nuclear non-proliferation center, currently with Pacific Forum nonprofit):\n   - Yongbyon is \"foundational\" and \"the core of their entire program\"\n   - North Korea may carry out a \"statement\" nuclear test comparable to China's final nuclear test in 1996 within the next year to show off its progress\n\n2. **Rafael Grossi** (IAEA head):\n   - Said in June the watchdog was monitoring construction of a new building at Yongbyon similar to an area of the Kangson enrichment plant\n   - \"The undeclared enrichment facilities at both Kangson and Yongbyon are of serious concern\"\n   - Said there was no evidence of major changes at North Korea's Punggye-ri test site in the northeast, but that the area \"remains prepared to support a nuclear test\"\n\n3. **Andrew Yeo** (senior fellow, Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies):\n   - \"The modernization and expansion of the Yongbyon nuclear facility underscore just how far we've moved from the era of DPRK summitry during Trump's first administration\"\n   - Kim now has \"little appetite\" for talks with the U.S. that would limit the country's nuclear potential\n   - \"The site's ongoing modernization and expansion will help accelerate North Korea's uranium enrichment capacity, enabling the country to increase its stockpile of nuclear warheads at a faster pace\"\n   - \"It's unlikely that Kim would offer it [Yongbyon] up in future talks with the United States\"\n\n4. **Kim Jong Un** (North Korea's supreme leader):\n   - Said while touring a nuclear site in January that 2025 was a \"crucial year\" for the country's weapons programs\n   - Said Pyongyang would beef up its nuclear forces\n   - Said the country's scientists and workers had achieved \"remarkable successes\" in producing weapons-grade nuclear materials\n\n5. **Kim Yo Jong** (Kim Jong Un's sister, senior official):\n   - Said in July that the \"personal relationship\" between Trump and Kim \"is not bad\"\n\n## Other Relevant Context:\n\n- Observers believe Russia has been helping North Korea with its weapons development\n- North Korea sent thousands of troops to Russia's Kursk region last year\n- Russia and North Korea inked a strategic partnership in June 2024\n- Diplomatic efforts with the U.S. have stalled; North Korea has insisted it will not denuclearize\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://beyondparallel.csis.org/recent-activity-observed-at-punggye-ri-nuclear-test-facility/\">\n## Summary of \"Recent Activity Observed at Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility\"\n\n**Source:** Beyond Parallel (CSIS Korea Chair)  \n**Date:** January 18, 2024  \n**Authors:** Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., Victor Cha, Jennifer Jun\n\n### Key Facts and Observations:\n\n**Facility Status:**\n- Satellite imagery from January 2024 shows low-level activity at North Korea's Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility at three locations: the northern Main Administrative and Support Area, the Yongam-dong Command Center, and the Kuok-tong Support Area\n- Since 2020, both the United States and South Korea have assessed that North Korea has completed all required preparations for conducting a seventh nuclear test from Tunnel No. 3\n- The reasons why North Korea has not yet conducted the long-anticipated seventh nuclear test are unknown\n\n**Specific Activity Observed (January 16, 2024 imagery):**\n- Main Administrative and Support Area: courtyard cleared of snow (compared to January 5), three formations of personnel visible, road to Tunnel No. 3 cleared, evidence of light vehicle traffic\n- Tunnel No. 3 (South Portal): Main access road is clear with evidence of probable light vehicle traffic\n- Tunnels No. 2 and 4: No recent vehicle or personnel tracks observed; portals remain collapsed. Despite 2023 speculation about Tunnel No. 4 reopening, this has not occurred\n- Tunnel No. 1: No activity; abandoned since North Korea's first nuclear test on October 9, 2006\n- Command Center and Support areas: Evidence of light vehicle traffic and snow clearing, consistent with typical facility caretaker maintenance\n\n**Expert Assessment:**\n- The activity indicates North Korea has undertaken a \"concerted commitment to maintaining the progress achieved in reenabling Tunnel No. 3\"\n- **However, the recent activity \"does not suggest imminent preparations for a seventh nuclear test\"**\n- The actual decision to conduct a seventh nuclear test rests entirely with Kim Jong-un\n- Concerns are heightened due to North Korea's provocative ballistic missile tests and a January 16, 2024 statement ordering abolishment of \"the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country of the DPRK\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Summarize DPRK nuclear tests, test-site activity since 2018, and current expert assessments of likelihood of a new test before May 2026, citing CTBTO, IAEA, 38 North, and think-tank reports\nSummary of the DPRK\u2019s six nuclear tests (2006-2017)\n\n\u2022 9 Oct 2006 \u2013 first underground test at Punggye-ri. CTBTO IMS stations registered a magnitude 4.1\u20134.3 event; xenon-133 was later detected, confirming a nuclear explosion of roughly 1 kt yield (CTBTO, 2006 DPRK Announced Nuclear Test).  \n\u2022 25 May 2009 \u2013 second test; seismic data indicated a few-kiloton yield and a magnitude 4.7 event (Open Nuclear Network Backgrounder).  \n\u2022 12 Feb 2013 \u2013 third test; DPRK claimed a \u201csmaller, lighter\u201d device. Yield estimates centre on 6-7 kt (ONN).  \n\u2022 6 Jan 2016 \u2013 fourth test; DPRK declared it had detonated an \u201cH-bomb\u201d. Seismic signature (~magnitude 4.8) and yield (~7-10 kt) were consistent with a boosted-fission device, not a full two-stage thermonuclear weapon (SIPRI expert comment, 2016).  \n\u2022 9 Sep 2016 \u2013 fifth test; characterised by Pyongyang as a \u201cstandardised nuclear warhead\u201d. Independent analyses put the yield in the 10-20 kt range (ONN).  \n\u2022 3 Sep 2017 \u2013 sixth and largest test. CTBTO recorded a magnitude 6.1 shock; most open-source estimates place the yield between 120 kt and 250 kt, consistent with a two-stage thermonuclear design (CTBTO, September 2017 DPRK Nuclear Test; ONN).\n\nNo nuclear explosions have been detected since 2017, meaning the DPRK has observed its longest pause between tests.\n\nStatus of the Punggye-ri test site and related facilities since 2018\n\n\u2022 May 2018 \u2013 In the run-up to the Singapore summit, the DPRK theatrically \u201cdemolished\u201d the entrances to all four tunnels at Punggye-ri in front of invited journalists. CTBTO analysts noted at the time that only an on-site inspection could confirm irreversible closure (IndepthNews, 13 May 2018).  \n\u2022 2020-2021 \u2013 Commercial imagery showed that Tunnel No. 3 (the \u201cSouth Portal\u201d) was being re-excavated. US and ROK intelligence chiefs publicly stated that preparations for a seventh test were \u201ccomplete\u201d by mid-2022.  \n\u2022 Jan 2024 \u2013 High-resolution images analysed by CSIS/Beyond Parallel revealed snow clearance, personnel formations and light vehicle traffic at the Main Administrative Area, the new south-portal entrance and support compounds. The activity was assessed as routine caretaker work \u201cnot suggestive of imminent preparations\u201d but demonstrating Pyongyang\u2019s \u201cconcerted commitment to maintaining the progress achieved in reenabling Tunnel No. 3\u201d (Beyond Parallel, 18 Jan 2024).  \n\u2022 Throughout 2023-2024 \u2013 No further work was detected at the collapsed North and West Portals (Tunnels 2 & 4), and Tunnel 1 remains abandoned (Beyond Parallel, 2024).  \n\u2022 Yongbyon complex \u2013 38 North imagery (quoted by Newsweek, July 2024) shows construction of a new building with dimensions similar to the Kangson enrichment plant and installation of six heat exchangers, indicating probable expansion of uranium-enrichment capacity.  \n\u2022 IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told the Board of Governors on 9 June 2025 that Yongbyon\u2019s new building \u201chas dimensions and features similar to the Kangson enrichment plant\u201d and that Punggye-ri \u201cremains prepared to support a nuclear test\u201d, although no major changes were then visible (IAEA Introductory Statement, 2025).\n\nCurrent expert assessments of the likelihood of a new test before May 2026\n\n\u2022 CSIS Korea Chair analysts Joseph Bermudez Jr. et al. conclude that, while technical preparations are complete, decisions rest \u201centirely in the hands of Kim Jong Un\u201d; January 2024 imagery gave \u201cno indication of imminent preparations\u201d (Beyond Parallel, 2024).  \n\u2022 38 North/Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists authors Hans Kristensen and Matt Korda note that North Korea\u2019s 2021 five-year plan calls for \u201csuper-sized\u201d and \u201ctactical\u201d nuclear warheads, objectives that are hard to validate without additional testing, keeping the option to resume testing \u201cvery much alive\u201d (Bulletin, 15 July 2024).  \n\u2022 The Institute for Security & Development Policy argues that domestic political milestones (for example, showing technological progress before the 2025 Korean Workers\u2019 Party congress) and the 2024-2025 US election cycle create incentives for a demonstration test; it judges that \u201cthe window between late-2024 and 2026 is high-risk\u201d (ISDP Issue Brief, 2023).  \n\u2022 Newsweek quotes Pacific Forum\u2019s William Alberque in July 2024 as saying that Pyongyang \u201cmay carry out a \u2018statement\u2019 nuclear test comparable to China\u2019s final 1996 test within the next year to show off its progress\u201d (Newsweek, 2024).  \n\u2022 The Wavell Room assessment (May 2023) calls a seventh test \u201cnot a matter of if, but when\u201d, forecasting that the device would likely be higher-yield than 2017 and signal abandonment of the 2018 testing moratorium.  \n\u2022 Earlier polling of ten experts by 19FortyFive (Aug 2022) produced a range of views; most saw a test within the next 12-18 months as \u201cmore likely than not\u201d given the political pay-offs, although this has yet to materialise.  \n\u2022 Despite the absence of fresh tunnelling since early-2023, CTBTO\u2019s 24/7 seismic and radionuclide network remains capable of immediate detection. The organisation continues to register small aftershocks at the site but no explosive events (CTBTO 2017 page, updated).  \nSynthesis:  The technical capability to test again exists; Tunnel 3 is serviceable and logistics routes are intact. Strategic incentives\u2014validating miniaturised tactical warheads, larger thermonuclear designs or a \u201cdual-capable\u201d political message\u2014persist.  Most independent experts therefore treat a seventh test by May 2026 as a distinct possibility, with many judging the probability as \u201chigh\u201d if domestic or external triggers arise, but no open-source imagery or agency report points to an imminent test as of mid-2025.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\n1. Up-to-date high-resolution imagery from 38 North for the second half of 2024 and early 2025 was not retrieved; this would show whether excavation or new spoil piles have resumed.  \n2. No explicit probability estimates (e.g., percentage likelihood) by IAEA, CTBTO or allied intelligence for the 2025-2026 horizon were publicly available.  \n3. Open sources provide little insight into the status of Tunnel 4, rumoured in 2023 to be under refurbishment.  \n4. There is limited detail on possible nuclear-device assembly buildings and logistical movements outside the immediate Punggye-ri perimeter.\n\nAdditional targeted searches focused on \u201c38 North Punggye-ri August 2024\u201d, \u201cROK intelligence seventh test 2025\u201d or \u201cUS Indo-Pacom assessment DPRK nuclear test\u201d could clarify these points, but the core analytical picture\u2014technical readiness, political calculus and expert judgments\u2014can already be drawn from the sources above.\n\nOverall conclusion\n\n\u2022 The DPRK remains the only state to have conducted nuclear tests in the 21st century, with six explosions between 2006 and 2017 culminating in a likely thermonuclear device.  \n\u2022 After a symbolic 2018 demolition, Pyongyang has re-readied Tunnel 3 and maintains the site; satellite data through January 2024 show caretaker activity but no final pre-test signatures.  \n\u2022 Both the IAEA and CTBTO assess that the site \u201cremains prepared\u201d for another detonation, and 38 North/CSIS concur.  \n\u2022 Think-tank and academic analyses broadly expect at least one test during the current five-year plan (2021-2025) or before May 2026, should Kim Jong Un seek to validate new warhead designs or maximise political leverage.  \n\u2022 There is, however, no publicly visible countdown: the decision is political, not technical, and open-source indicators of a forthcoming test (fresh spoil, cabling to the portal, large troop deployments) have not yet appeared.</Agent_report>\n"
