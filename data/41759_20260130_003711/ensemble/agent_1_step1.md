Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FX Empire (January 2026):**
Provides current policy rate of 10.5% (unchanged in January 2026). High-quality financial data source. Reports that markets expected a cut to 10%, indicating the hold was a surprise. Key facts: inflation at 5.6% (December), within 5-7% target range; GDP growth 3.7% in Q1-FY26; reserves expected to exceed $18 billion. This is factual reporting with clear attribution to SBP's MPC.

**SBP Data Tables Page (January 29, 2026):**
Index page only, confirming data is maintained but not providing actual values. Limited utility beyond confirming official source availability.

**Trading Economics (January 2026):**
Reiterates 10.5% current rate. Provides forecasts: 10.00% by end of Q1 2026, trending to 7.00% in 2027. These are model-based projections from Trading Economics, not expert opinions. Historical context valuable (average 11.63% since 1992, range 5.75%-22%).

**Express Tribune - June 2025:**
Reports policy rate held at 11% in June 2025. Inflation at 3.5% (May 2025), GDP growth 2.7% for FY25. Reserves at $11.7 billion. This is historical context showing the rate before the December 2025 cut.

**Express Tribune - May 2025:**
Reports 100bp cut from 12% to 11% effective May 6, 2025. Inflation had collapsed to 0.3% in April 2025. Current account surplus of $1.2 billion. CEO Mohammed Sohail (identifiable expert) noted the cut was larger than market expectations.

**The Nation - September 2025:**
Reports rate held at 11% in September 2025, with inflation at 3% (August). Flood-driven economic challenges cited as reason for caution. MPC noted real interest rate "adequately positive."

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive timeline showing: rate peaked at 22% (July 2023), then cut cycle began June 2024 (to 19%), continued through November 2024 (to 12%), January 2025 (to 11%), held May-September 2025, cut December 2025 (to 10.5%), held January 2026. IMF MPCC requires real rate between 0% and +5%. Currently real rate ~+4.9% (10.5% policy minus 5.6% inflation). Agent analysis is well-sourced and factual.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **SBP policy rate changes during easing cycles (2016, 2019-2020, 2024-2026):** Most relevant. Shows how SBP adjusts rates when inflation normalizes.

2. **Emerging market central bank easing cycles under IMF programs:** Relevant for understanding constraints and typical pace.

3. **Historical SBP rate levels during stable inflation periods:** The 5.75% low (May 2016) and 11.63% long-term average provide anchors.

**Most suitable:** SBP's current easing cycle (2024-2026) with IMF constraints, as it directly applies to the timeframe and captures the specific dynamics of inflation normalization, IMF conditionality, and economic recovery.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 91 days (January 30 to May 1, 2026)

**MPC meeting schedule:** Next meeting March 9, 2026, likely one more before May 1.

**Historical patterns in similar periods:**

- **December 2024 to March 2025 (3 months):** Rate cut from 12% to 11% (-100bp)
- **May to September 2025 (4 months):** Rate held at 11% (0bp)
- **September to December 2025 (3 months):** Rate cut from 11% to 10.5% (-50bp)
- **December 2025 to January 2026 (1 month):** Rate held at 10.5% (0bp)

Pattern shows: SBP has become more cautious, with smaller cuts and longer holds. The pace of easing has slowed significantly as the rate approaches more normal levels.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors supporting further cuts:**
- Inflation stable within 5-7% target range
- Real rate at +4.9% is quite restrictive for an economy targeting 3.75-4.75% GDP growth
- Historical average of 11.63% suggests 10.5% is still elevated
- Trading Economics forecasts 10% by Q1 2026 end
- SBP's easing bias evident from 2024-2025 cycle

**Key factors limiting cuts:**
- IMF MPCC lower bound of 0% real rate (with 5-7% inflation, minimum policy rate ~5-7%)
- Current account deficit widening
- Need to maintain FX reserve building
- Global uncertainties (oil prices, geopolitical tensions)
- SBP's recent pattern of caution (held January 2026 despite market expecting cut)
- Real rate must stay "adequately positive"

**Most likely scenario:** 
Given 91 days and likely 1-2 MPC meetings, expect 0-100bp of cuts. The January hold suggests SBP is comfortable at 10.5% for now. March meeting might deliver 25-50bp cut if inflation remains contained. The rate is unlikely to fall below 9.5% (which would risk breaching IMF constraints if inflation rises) or stay above 11% (which would contradict the easing cycle).

**Base case:** 10.0% (one 50bp cut by May 1)
**Range:** 9.5% to 10.5%

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:

1. **Central tendency around 10-10.5%:** The January hold and cautious easing pattern suggest limited movement. One 25-50bp cut is most probable.

2. **Lower bound around 9.5%:** This would require two aggressive cuts totaling 100bp, unlikely given recent caution and IMF constraints. Below 9.5% would push real rates dangerously low if inflation rises.

3. **Upper bound at 11%:** Would require a rate hike, which contradicts the easing cycle. Only a major shock (currency crisis, inflation spike) would trigger this, probability <5%.

4. **Asymmetric distribution:** Slightly more probability mass on the downside (9.5-10%) than upside (10.5-11%) given easing bias, but the January hold suggests status quo has meaningful probability.

5. **Historical volatility:** In stable periods, SBP typically moves in 25-50bp increments. The 100bp cut in May 2025 was exceptional (responding to 0.3% inflation). Current 5.6% inflation is more normal.

6. **Unknown unknowns:** External shocks (oil price spike, geopolitical crisis, IMF program disruption) could shift outcomes. The hint suggests 5-25% range, implying some tail risk exists but is bounded.

Setting 90/10 confidence interval: 9.75% to 10.75%
- 10th percentile: 9.75% (two 25bp cuts plus some probability of aggressive easing)
- 90th percentile: 10.75% (small probability of 25bp hike or minimal easing)
