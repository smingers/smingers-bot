Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Express Tribune (Jan 26, 2026):** Reports SBP held policy rate at 10.5% on Jan 26, 2026. High-quality local source with direct MPC statement quotes. **Factual:** inflation 5.6% (Dec), GDP growth 3.7% (Q1-FY26), reserves $16.1B. **Opinion:** Governor Jameel Ahmad states rate is "adequately positive" - this is an authoritative expert opinion from the decision-maker. Business community opinions (FPCCI) are identifiable but represent stakeholder advocacy, not analysis.

**Money Rediff (Jan 26, 2026):** Confirms 10.5% hold, contrary to market expectations of 0.5-1% cut. **Factual:** core inflation 7.4%, forex reserves $16.1B, projected to reach $20.2B by end-2026. Trade deficit widening. MPC statement directly quoted. Reliable financial news aggregator.

**Economic Times (Date unclear, appears Sept 2025):** Reports rate held at 11% for fourth consecutive time. **Factual:** 1,100bp cuts since June 2024 from 22% peak, inflation 5.6% in Sept from 3.6% in Aug due to floods. This is historical context - the article predates the Dec 2025 cut to 10.5%.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 28-29, 2026):** Multiple sources confirm 10.5% rate as of late January. PSX article (Jan 29) notes SBP held rate at 10.5% citing CPI 5.6% and core inflation 7.4%. Dawn editorial (Jan 28) discusses CRR reduction by 100bp while holding rate - this is **strong factual evidence** of a liquidity injection without rate cut, suggesting SBP is using alternative tools. ProPakistani (Jan 23) predicted 50bp cut - this was proven wrong, showing market expectations were dovish but SBP surprised hawkish.

**Historical articles (Sept-Dec 2025):** Express Tribune (Dec 12) and GEO TV show IMF warning against premature easing, with all 12 analysts expecting rate hold at 11% in Dec meeting. However, rate was actually cut to 10.5% in Dec, showing SBP was slightly more dovish than expected. Sept articles show floods creating inflation concerns.

**Key Expert Opinions (identifiable):**
- Governor Jameel Ahmad: Rate "adequately positive" (Jan 2026) - authoritative
- IMF: Policy must be "appropriately tight and data-dependent" (Dec 2025) - binding constraint
- Sana Tawfik (Arif Habib Ltd): Premature cuts risk rupee weakness (Dec 2025) - credible analyst

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **SBP held at 10.5% in Jan 2026 despite market expecting cuts** - Multiple independent sources (Express Tribune, Money Rediff, PSX reports). This demonstrates a more hawkish stance than markets anticipated, suggesting caution prevails. Directly relevant to May 2026 outcome.

2. **IMF constraints on real interest rate** - IMF requires "appropriately tight" policy with real rate 0-5%. With inflation at 5.6%, minimum effective rate is ~5.6%, maximum ~10.6%. Current 10.5% is at upper bound. This structural constraint limits downside.

3. **Core inflation sticky at 7.4%** - Significantly above headline 5.6%. SBP explicitly cited this in Jan decision. Historical pattern shows SBP targets core inflation, suggesting less room to cut than headline inflation alone would suggest.

4. **CRR reduction instead of rate cut** - SBP reduced cash reserve requirement by 100bp (Jan 2026) to inject Rs300-315B liquidity while holding rates. This reveals SBP's strategy: use alternative tools before cutting rates further. Suggests rate cuts will be delayed/limited.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Easing cycle pattern** - 1,100bp cuts from June 2024 to Jan 2026, but pace slowing dramatically (100bp in Dec 2025, 0bp in Jan 2026). Trend suggests continued easing but at decelerating pace.

2. **Current account deficit widening** - $1.2B in H1-FY26, trade deficit expanding due to rising imports. This external vulnerability limits room for aggressive easing that could pressure rupee.

3. **Forex reserves building** - $16.1B current, projected $18B+ by June 2026. Positive factor supporting potential easing, but growth rate modest.

4. **GDP growth revised up to 3.75-4.75%** - Stronger than expected growth reduces urgency for stimulus, supporting cautious approach.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Trading Economics forecast of 10% by Q1-2026 end - Model-based, not expert consensus, and already contradicted by Jan hold.

2. Business community calls for 350bp cut to 7% - Stakeholder advocacy, not objective analysis.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 91 days (Jan 30 to May 1, 2026)

**MPC meeting schedule:** Meetings typically every 6-8 weeks. Next likely meetings: early/mid-March 2026, possibly late April 2026. Expect 1-2 policy decisions before May 1.

**If timeframe halved (45 days to mid-March):** Would capture only one MPC meeting. Probability distribution would narrow significantly around 10.5% (status quo) with small probability of single 25bp cut to 10.25%. Range: 10.25-10.5%.

**If timeframe doubled (182 days to late July 2026):** Would capture 3-4 MPC meetings. Distribution would widen substantially. Could see cumulative 100-150bp cuts if inflation remains benign, bringing rate to 9-9.5%. However, IMF constraints and seasonal inflation patterns (food prices typically rise in summer) would limit aggressive easing. Range: 9.0-10.5%.

**Historical 3-month patterns:**
- Dec 2024-Mar 2025: 100bp cut (but from higher 12% base, inflation collapsing)
- May-Aug 2025: 0bp (held at 11%)
- Sept-Dec 2025: 50bp cut (from 11% to 10.5%)
- Dec 2025-Jan 2026: 0bp (held at 10.5%)

Recent pattern shows SBP moving cautiously with extended holds between cuts. The Jan 2026 hold after Dec cut suggests next move unlikely before March at earliest.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting cuts (pushing toward 9.5-10%):**
- Inflation within 5-7% target range for 7+ months
- Real rate at +4.9% is restrictive for emerging market
- Easing cycle established since June 2024
- GDP growth improving, reducing stagflation risk

**Factors limiting cuts (pushing toward 10.5-11%):**
- **Jan 2026 surprise hold** - SBP demonstrated hawkish preference despite market dovish expectations. This is the strongest recent signal.
- **Core inflation at 7.4%** - Stickier than headline, SBP's stated concern
- **IMF binding constraint** - Real rate must stay positive, limiting floor to ~5.5-6% given inflation
- **CRR reduction strategy** - SBP using alternative tools, preserving rate ammunition
- **Current account pressures** - Deficit widening, limiting aggressive easing
- **Pattern of extended holds** - SBP held Sept-Dec 2025, held again Jan 2026

**Key insight:** The Jan 2026 hold is pivotal. Markets expected 50-75bp cut; SBP delivered 0bp. This reveals SBP's reaction function has shifted more hawkish than market models. The use of CRR reduction shows SBP wants to ease financial conditions without cutting rates yet.

**Base rate recalibration:** Original outside view suggested 9.75-10.75% range with median 10.25%. However, Jan 2026 hold materially changes the picture. SBP is clearly comfortable at 10.5% and willing to surprise markets hawkish. This shifts distribution upward.

**Most likely scenario for May 1, 2026:**
- March meeting: 25bp cut to 10.25% (if inflation data remains benign) OR hold at 10.5% (if any inflation uptick)
- April meeting (if occurs): Hold or another 25bp cut
- **Modal outcome: 10.25%** (single 25bp cut)
- **Secondary mode: 10.5%** (no cuts, status quo)

**Tail scenarios:**
- **Upside (10.75-11%):** Requires inflation shock or currency crisis. Low probability <10%.
- **Downside (9.5-9.75%):** Requires aggressive 75-100bp easing. Given Jan hold, this seems inconsistent with SBP's revealed preferences. Probability <15%.

Probability calibration:

**Distribution construction:**

The Jan 2026 hold fundamentally shifts the distribution rightward (higher rates). Key probability masses:

1. **10.5% (status quo):** ~35% probability
   - No cuts in remaining period
   - SBP maintains "wait and see" given core inflation concerns
   - Consistent with recent pattern of extended holds

2. **10.25% (one 25bp cut):** ~30% probability
   - Single cautious cut in March or April
   - Inflation remains stable, SBP gains confidence
   - Most likely active change scenario

3. **10.0% (two 25bp cuts or one 50bp cut):** ~20% probability
   - Requires inflation declining further or external pressures easing
   - Two meetings both delivering cuts seems optimistic given Jan hold
   - 50bp cut in single meeting contradicts cautious pattern

4. **10.75% (one 25bp hike):** ~5% probability
   - Inflation surprise or currency crisis
   - IMF pressure to tighten
   - Low but non-zero given global uncertainties

5. **9.75% or below (75bp+ cuts):** ~5% probability
   - Requires dramatic shift in SBP stance
   - Inconsistent with Jan 2026 revealed preferences
   - Would risk IMF program

6. **11.0% or above (50bp+ hikes):** ~5% probability
   - Major economic shock
   - Extreme tail scenario

**Percentile assignments:**

Given 91-day timeframe with likely 1-2 decisions, and strong evidence of SBP caution, distribution should be:
- Concentrated around 10.25-10.5% (65% probability)
- Modest left tail to 9.75-10.0% (20% probability)
- Small right tail to 10.75-11.0% (10% probability)
- Extreme tails <5% each

The distribution is slightly left-skewed (easing bias) but much less than market expectations, reflecting SBP's demonstrated hawkish surprise in Jan 2026.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** SBP policy rate (percent) on May 1, 2026, 11:59 PM UTC - 91 days forward

2. **Outside view base rate:** Historical easing cycles suggested 9.75-10.75% range, but Jan 2026 hawkish hold shifts this to 10.0-10.75%

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 10.375%; mean = 10.35%; aligns with "cautious single cut or status quo" justification

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Jan 2026 hold at 10.5% despite market expecting 50-75bp cut (factually confirmed, multiple sources)
   - Core inflation sticky at 7.4% vs headline 5.6% (SBP official statement)
   - CRR reduction instead of rate cut shows alternative easing strategy (SBP announcement)
   - IMF requires "appropriately tight" policy with real rate constraints (IMF review document)
   - Pattern of extended holds: Sept-Dec 2025 (50bp), Dec-Jan 2026 (0bp) shows deceleration

5. **Blind-spot:** If inflation collapses below 4% (similar to April 2025's 0.3%), SBP could deliver aggressive 75-100bp cuts, pushing rate to 9.5-9.75%. This would make forecast look too conservative. However, current 5.6% inflation with sticky 7.4% core makes this scenario unlikely (<10% probability).
