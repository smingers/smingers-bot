Date: Current synthesis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent SBP easing cycle (2024-2025)**
- From peak 22% (July 2023) to 10.5% (December 2025)
- Pattern: Aggressive cuts when inflation collapsed, then cautious holds
- Suitability: High - most relevant recent behavior

**Reference Class 2: Historical policy rate stability periods**
- Average rate 11.6% (1992-2026)
- Typical holding periods: 3-6 months between changes
- Suitability: Medium - provides long-term context but less relevant given current IMF program

**Reference Class 3: IMF program compliance periods**
- Real rate must stay 0% to +5% (MPCC constraint)
- Current: 10.5% policy rate, ~5-7% inflation target → real rate ~3.5-5.5%
- Suitability: Very high - binding constraint on policy decisions

**Chosen Reference Class:** IMF program compliance with real rate constraints, contextualized by the recent easing cycle pattern.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Horizon:** 3 months and 1 day (January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026)

**Scheduled MPC Meetings:** Next meeting March 9, 2026 (per FXEmpire). Likely one more meeting in April before May 1.

**Historical 3-month patterns:**
- September-December 2025: One 50bp cut (11% → 10.5%)
- June-September 2025: Hold at 11%
- March-June 2025: Hold at 11%
- December 2024-March 2025: One 100bp cut (12% → 11%)

Pattern: In stable inflation environments, SBP makes 0-1 rate changes per quarter, typically 50-100bp when cutting.

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Stability (10.5% baseline):**

1. **IMF Constraint:** With inflation projected at 5-7%, a policy rate of 10.5% yields real rate of 3.5-5.5%, comfortably within the MPCC corridor. Moving below 10% risks breaching the lower bound if inflation rises.

2. **Recent Hold Decision:** January 2026 MPC surprised markets by holding at 10.5% despite expectations of a cut to 10%. The rationale emphasized "adequately positive" real rates and supporting growth while maintaining price stability.

3. **Inflation Trajectory:** Inflation at 5.6% (December) is near the middle of the 5-7% target range. Unlike early 2025 when inflation was abnormally low (0.3-3.5%), current levels don't create urgent pressure for cuts.

4. **External Sector Concerns:** Current account deficit widening, though reserves building. Cautious stance warranted.

**Factors Supporting Further Cuts (toward 10% or below):**

1. **Market Expectations:** Trading Economics forecasts 10% by end Q1 2026, suggesting another 50bp cut is anticipated.

2. **Easing Cycle Momentum:** SBP cut rates by 1,150bp from peak (22% to 10.5%). Historical easing cycles often continue until real rates normalize around +2-3%.

3. **Growth Support:** GDP growth targets of 3.75-4.75% for FY26 may benefit from lower rates.

4. **Two Meetings Remaining:** March and likely April meetings provide opportunities for 1-2 cuts of 25-50bp each.

**Most Likely Scenario:** One 25-50bp cut between now and May 1, bringing rate to 10-10.25%, or holding at 10.5%. The IMF constraint and recent surprise hold suggest caution will dominate, making aggressive cuts unlikely.

## Outside view calibration:

**Base Rate:** 10.5% (current as of January 2026)

**Historical Volatility:** Over 3-month periods during stable phases, changes of 0-100bp are typical. The December 2025 cut of 50bp after 6 months of holds suggests measured easing.

**Distribution Shape Considerations:**

1. **Lower Bound Constraint:** Below 10% becomes increasingly unlikely due to IMF real rate floor. With 5-7% inflation, rates below 9.5% would risk negative real rates.

2. **Upper Bound Constraint:** Increases are extremely unlikely given disinflation success and easing cycle momentum. The probability of returning above 11% is near zero.

3. **Central Tendency:** Most likely outcomes cluster around 10-10.5%, representing either a hold or one modest cut.

4. **Tail Risks:** 
   - Downside: Unexpected inflation collapse or external shock → aggressive cuts to 9-9.5%
   - Upside: Inflation spike or currency crisis → emergency hold at 10.5% or slight increase to 11%

**Calibration Anchors:**
- 50th percentile: 10.25% (one 25bp cut)
- 80% confidence interval: 9.75% to 10.75%
- 90% confidence interval: 9.5% to 11%

The distribution should be slightly left-skewed (more probability of cuts than hikes) but with a hard floor around 9.5% due to IMF constraints.
