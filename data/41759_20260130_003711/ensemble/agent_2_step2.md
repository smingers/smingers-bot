Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **Express Tribune (Jan 26, 2026)** - Reports SBP held rate at 10.5% on Jan 26. Named sources: Governor Jameel Ahmad, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh. Factual: rate=10.5%, inflation=5.6% Dec 2025, core=7.4%, reserves=$16.1bn. Opinion: Business community wanted 350bp cut (identifiable source, but advocacy position).

2. **Rediff/Money (Jan 26, 2026)** - Confirms 10.5% hold. Factual: forex reserves $16.1bn (Jan 16), projected $20.2bn by end-2026. Core inflation 7.4% (higher than headline 5.6%). Opinion: "market expected 0.5-1% cut" (anonymous, low weight).

3. **Economic Times (date unclear, refers to "fourth consecutive hold at 11%")** - CRITICAL DISCREPANCY: This appears to be from September 2025 based on context (mentions August inflation 5.6% from 3.6%, floods). Not current. Rate was 11% then, now 10.5%.

4. **Dawn (Jan 28, 2026)** - "Prudent stimulus" article confirms 10.5% hold, CRR cut by 100bp. Factual: Rs300-315bn liquidity injection expected. Opinion: unnamed analysts say "impact will be modest" (weak evidence).

5. **ProPakistani (Jan 23, 2026)** - Pre-decision Reuters poll: 7/10 analysts expected 50bp cut to 10.5%, 2/10 expected 75bp cut, 1/10 no change. This was BEFORE the Jan 26 decision—the SBP surprised by holding.

6. **Express Tribune (Dec 2025)** - IMF warned against premature easing. All 12 analysts polled expected hold at 11%. Inflation 6.1% Nov 2025.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Sep 2025: Rate held at 11% (third consecutive hold) due to flood concerns
- Dec 2025: IMF second review warned against premature easing
- Jan 26, 2026: Rate held at 10.5% (implies a cut occurred between Sep-Jan, likely 50bp in Nov/Dec)
- Next MPC: March 9, 2026 (approximately 42 days before May 1 resolution)

**Critical Correction:** The outside view baseline assumed rate=10.5% as of Jan 26, which is CORRECT per multiple current sources.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG Evidence:**
1. **SBP held at 10.5% on Jan 26 despite market expecting cuts** (Express Tribune, Rediff) - Shows MPC is more hawkish than markets anticipated. The surprise hold + CRR cut suggests they want liquidity without rate cuts.

2. **Core inflation at 7.4% vs headline 5.6%** (multiple sources) - Core above headline indicates persistent underlying pressure. SBP targets 5-7% range; core exceeds this.

3. **IMF programme constraints** (Dec 2025 articles) - IMF explicitly warned against premature easing. The $7bn programme includes monetary policy conditions. Strong institutional constraint.

4. **Only one MPC meeting before resolution** (March 9) - Structural constraint limiting maximum possible change to ~150bp historically (90th percentile).

**MODERATE Evidence:**
1. **Current account deficit widening** (Jan articles: $1.2bn H1, trade deficit growing) - Suggests external vulnerability, argues for caution on easing.

2. **Real policy rate ≈+4.8%** (10.5% nominal vs ~5.6% inflation) - High positive real rate gives room for cuts, but MPC just demonstrated reluctance.

3. **Reserves building to $18bn by June** (SBP projection) - Positive for external stability, reduces crisis risk that would force hikes.

4. **Business community pressure for cuts** (FPCCI demanding 7% rate) - Political/economic pressure exists, but SBP just resisted it.

**WEAK Evidence:**
1. **Market expectations were wrong** (Jan 23 poll vs Jan 26 outcome) - Suggests analyst forecasts have limited predictive power currently.

2. **CRR cut as substitute for rate cut** - Novel policy mix; unclear if this presages future rate cuts or replaces them.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**92 days to resolution (Jan 30 → May 1, 2026)**

Next scheduled MPC: March 9, 2026 (38 days away, 53 days before resolution)

**Single-meeting horizon implications:**
- Historical 90th percentile move = 150bp
- Modal move when rate held despite cut expectations = 0bp (next meeting often holds too)
- If timeframe halved (46 days): Would still include March 9 MPC, minimal impact
- If timeframe doubled (184 days): Would include 2-3 MPCs, materially wider distribution (90/10 could be 8.5-12.5%)

**Critical insight:** The Jan 26 surprise hold despite market expectations shifts the distribution. If MPC had cut 50bp as expected, the base case for May 1 would be 9.5-10.5%. The actual hold suggests they're more concerned about inflation persistence than markets believed.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Factors arguing for LESS easing than outside view:**
1. **Recent surprise hold** - MPC demonstrated hawkishness by resisting market/business pressure on Jan 26
2. **Core inflation at 7.4%** - Above target ceiling, sticky
3. **IMF conditionality** - Active constraint on aggressive easing
4. **External account deterioration** - CA deficit widening argues for caution

**Factors arguing for MORE easing:**
1. **Headline inflation in-target at 5.6%** - Within 5-7% band
2. **High real rate** - At +4.8%, among highest in emerging markets
3. **Growth concerns** - GDP revised up but still modest 3.75-4.75%
4. **Political pressure** - Business community vocal

**Net assessment:** The Jan 26 surprise hold is a strong signal that the MPC is prioritizing inflation control over growth stimulus. The outside view's 40% probability of no change seems too LOW given this recent demonstration of hawkishness. The 50% probability of cuts should be reduced, and within cuts, the 50bp scenario should dominate over 100bp.

**Revised probability structure:**
- 50% hold at 10.5% (up from 40%)
- 35% cut 50bp to 10.0% (down from 40% across all cuts)
- 10% cut 100bp to 9.5% (rare, requires major disinflation)
- 5% hike 50bp to 11.0% (tail risk: external shock, rupee crisis)

However, I must also consider that the CRR cut might signal the MPC is preparing for rate cuts but wanted to see more data first. March 9 MPC will have Feb inflation data. If inflation stays at 5.6% or falls, a March cut becomes likely.

**Balancing view:** 45% hold, 40% single 50bp cut, 10% deeper cuts, 5% hike.

## Probability Calibration

Given the evidence:

**Most likely outcome: 10.5%** (45% - status quo from Jan 26 holds through May 1)

**Second most likely: 10.0%** (40% - single 50bp cut at March 9 MPC)

**Lower tail scenarios:**
- 9.5% (8%) - Two 50bp cuts or one 100bp cut; requires strong disinflation + IMF flexibility
- 9.0% (2%) - Aggressive easing; very unlikely given recent MPC behavior

**Upper tail scenarios:**
- 11.0% (4%) - External shock (oil spike, rupee crisis, geopolitical)
- 11.5%+ (1%) - Severe crisis requiring emergency hike

**Distribution construction:**
- P10: 9.5% (captures 10% probability of aggressive easing)
- P20: 10.0% (captures cumulative 20% in cut territory)
- P40: 10.0% (median slightly below mode due to cut probability)
- P60: 10.5% (mode)
- P80: 10.5% (heavy mass at status quo)
- P90: 11.0% (captures 10% upper tail)

Adjusting for smooth CDF and ensuring consistency:

Checklist:
1. Target: SBP policy rate on May 1, 2026, in percent
2. Outside view: 40% hold/50% cut/10% hike; adjusting to 45%/45%/10% given Jan 26 surprise hold
3. Implied median=10.25%, mean≈10.3%; consistent with slight easing bias but significant hold probability
4. Key evidence: (i)Jan 26 surprise hold despite market expectations, (ii)Core inflation 7.4% above target, (iii)IMF warning against premature easing, (iv)Only one MPC before resolution, (v)CRR cut as alternative stimulus
5. Blind spot: Severe rupee crisis forcing emergency hike to 12%+; or rapid disinflation allowing aggressive cuts to 9%. Both low probability but would make forecast look miscalibrated.
