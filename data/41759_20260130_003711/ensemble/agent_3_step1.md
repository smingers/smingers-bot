Analysis:
We start by reviewing the sources. The FXEmpire and Trading Economics articles (summaries [1] and [3]) provide clear, recent numerical data as of January 2026, showing the SBP’s policy rate at 10.5 percent. These sources also report that despite market expectations of a cut – after previous rate cuts in 2024‐2025 – the January decision was to hold at 10.5 percent. The Express Tribune and The Nation stories from mid-2025 (summaries [4] and [5]) document the progression from 11 percent in early 2025 to a 50–bp cut in December 2025, bringing the rate to 10.5 percent. Their detailed reviews of historical trends and the SBP’s rationale (including discussion of inflation stability, external pressures, and IMF conditionality) increase our confidence that the factual information (e.g., dates, rate moves, and IMF influences) is reliable. The SBP data index page [2] further confirms that the historical data is maintained and updated regularly.

For reference class analysis, we can compare the near‐term behavior of the SBP policy rate to:
• Its recent cycle (late 2024/early 2025), where disinflation permitted gradual cuts only once sufficient real rates were achieved.
• Other emerging-market central banks facing IMF conditionality, where even in easing cycles the cuts are limited to avoid breaching the lower real‐rate bound.
In our context – three months from today (January 30 to May 1, 2026) – the historical precedent is for cautious adjustments (often on the order of 25 to 50 basis points) once the inflation outlook is secure, and the IMF’s “adequately positive” real rate requirement is met.

The timeframe is about three months ahead. In similar past periods, the SBP has made adjustments (cut or hold) that range within roughly 50 basis points in either direction. At present, inflation is inside the 5–7 percent target and the real rate is around +5 percent, leaving little slack for a large further cut and also suggesting that a hiker (in case of a sudden inflation uptick) is possible but less likely given stable inflation numbers and other economic indicators.

The justification integrates these factors: The recent decision to hold at 10.5 percent, a previous cut from 11 percent in December 2025, and market forecasts (with Trading Economics suggesting a near-term level of roughly 10.0–10.5 percent) make a modest move more likely than a dramatic one. The IMF “real rate corridor” (ensuring the ex‐ante real rate neither falls below 0 nor exceeds about +5 percentage points) further constrains dramatic actions. It is quite plausible that in the next three months the SBP may decide on a modest cut (if disinflation continues) or possibly maintain the rate if external conditions warrant caution. In addition, unexpected external shocks or a slight pickup in inflation could push policy a bit higher. In our overall view, outcomes will likely lie within a relatively narrow band near the current 10.5 percent level.

Outside view calibration:
We are forecasting a true probability distribution. Our reference class includes similar emerging-market central bank actions where central banks tend to make modest adjustments (often ±25–50 bp) over a three‐month period when inflation is well behaved. Over this horizon, historical “upset” outcomes (a large cut or sharp hike) are relatively rare—perhaps on the order of 10–20 percent probability in the context of moderate external surprises. Small percentile shifts would noticeably affect a narrow distribution, so we set a 90/10 range wide enough (roughly 75–100 basis point spread) to account for unknowns, though the bulk of probability mass is near the 10.25–10.5 percent level.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 9.75
Percentile 20: 9.90
Percentile 40: 10.10
Percentile 60: 10.30
Percentile 80: 10.50
Percentile 90: 10.70

This distribution reflects a modest likelihood of further easing if disinflation persists (leading to lower percentiles) and some risk of upward moves if inflation or external pressures cause a policy tightening, with the median outcome gravitating toward around 10.3–10.5 percent by May 1, 2026.
