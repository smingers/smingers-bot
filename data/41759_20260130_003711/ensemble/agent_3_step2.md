Analysis:
We are asked to forecast the SBP’s target policy rate (in percent) on May 1, 2026, using official published Monetary Policy Statements. On January 26, 2026 the SBP held its target at 10.5% despite mixed market expectations for a cut. Our outside view notes that during the recent easing cycle—from a peak near 22% in mid‐2024 to 10.5% by early 2026—the SBP has moved cautiously, partly because its real rate (given an inflation target of 5–7%) must remain sufficiently positive to meet IMF constraints. Several reliable sources (Express Tribune, Rediff, GEO TV) confirm facts such as current inflation around 5.6%, a stable medium‐term inflation target range, and modest GDP growth expectations. Although a portion of market surveys had expected further cuts (with some citing 50–75 basis points reductions), the SBP’s recent messaging (“adequately positive” real rate and the need to stabilize external vulnerabilities) supports a cautious insight. Over the 3‑month prediction horizon (January 30–May 1, 2026), there are likely one or two MPC meetings. Under the IMF’s constraints and in view of stabilized inflation, rapid further easing (i.e. cuts of 50–100bps) seems unlikely. Instead, one modest cut of around 25bps, or even a hold at 10.5%, appears most plausible. 

(a) Source Analysis:
• The Express Tribune, GEO TV, and Rediff articles (January 2026) provide current factual details on a 10.5% policy rate, inflation at 5.6% (headline)/7.4% (core), and official statements stressing price stability. Their quality is high and factual.
• Several market surveys and Reuters polls (e.g. the “SBP Likely to Cut Policy Rate Next Week” and “SBP may hold rate at 11%” articles) offer opinions from analysts; however, the central bank’s own communication favors stability.
• Historical reports on previous rate cuts (from 2024–2025) show a tendency for measured (25–50bps) easing in periods of stabilized inflation and constrained external factors.
In essence, while some expert opinions lean toward a cut, the weight of strong institutional constraints and recent central bank communication suggests only modest further easing is likely.

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong evidence comes from multiple independent articles confirming a current rate of 10.5% and emphasizing adherence to an inflation target of 5–7% with an appropriate real rate. Moderate evidence arises from market surveys forecasting cuts, but these are tempered by the SBP’s recent actions and IMF guidelines. Weak evidence includes anecdotal market sentiment from industry leaders calling for deeper cuts—a view not supported by the central bank’s explicit rationale.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
Our forecasting horizon is exactly 3 months (from January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026). With two MPC meetings likely in March and April, even if a rate cut occurs it would be modest (around 25bps). If the horizon were halved (1.5 months), we might expect no change given policy inertia, whereas if doubled (6 months) the cumulative easing might be more pronounced.

(d) Justification:
The most compelling factors are:
1. The SBP’s explicit decision on January 26, 2026 to hold at 10.5%, reflecting its view that the real rate is “adequately positive.”
2. IMF and internal MPCC constraints that discourage lowering nominal rates too far below 10% in an environment with 5–7% inflation.
3. Consistency with recent historical patterns where modest cuts (mostly 25–50bps) occur only when there is a clear need to further stimulate growth.
4. Mixed market expectations tempered by clear central bank messaging.
Thus, our outside view base rate remains 10.5%, with the possibility of a modest 25bps cut yielding a median estimate of about 10.25%.

Probability calibration:
Even considering some market pressure for a rate reduction, we assign most probability mass near 10.25% with tails reflecting either a hold at 10.5% (or slightly above) if inflation surprises upward or a deeper cut (down to about 9.5%) if growth stalls unexpectedly. The distribution reflects a narrow range because of the constraints imposed by the IMF program and the SBP’s cautious approach.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: SBP’s policy rate on May 1, 2026 (in percent).
2. Outside view base rate: 10.5%.
3. Consistency check: Implied median = 10.25%; mean roughly similar. This is consistent with a modest cut.
4. Key evidence:
   • Recent SBP decision holding at 10.5%.
   • IMF/MPCC constraints needing a positive real rate.
   • Historical modest adjustments in similar periods.
5. Blind spot: A surprise external shock (e.g., a sharp deterioration in external prices or a currency crisis) could force a more aggressive cut, pushing the rate toward 9.5% or lower.
