Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, abridged):
   • SBP Monetary Policy Statement (26 Jan 2026). Primary document; highest quality; establishes policy rate 10.5 percent. Factual.  
   • Express Tribune, Dawn, Rediff, Geo TV, etc. (26–29 Jan 2026). Independent local media repeating the same 10.5 percent figure and quoting the SBP governor/MPC. High reliability for facts; opinions from business lobbies are advocacy.  
   • Trading-Economics/Arif Habib survey. Model/market expectations—moderate quality, forward-looking.  
   • Earlier Reuters polls & IMF staff reports (Sep–Dec 2025). High quality; give IMF conditionality and show SBP’s bias toward tight stance.  
   • Flood-impact and PSX articles. Contain macro context; factual elements credible, but geopolitical conjecture is weak evidence for May-rate.  
   Net result: multiple independent, reliable sources confirm the starting point (10.5 percent) and the current macro narrative; no reliable source predicts a hike before May.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted):
   Strong evidence  
   • Historical pattern: When headline CPI sits inside the 5-7 percent band and real rate > +3 percent, SBP almost always cuts once (0–50 bp) in the following quarter.  
   • IMF programme obliges SBP to keep a positive real rate, effectively capping cumulative cuts near 100 bp unless inflation plunges.  
   Moderate evidence  
   • Market curve implies one 50 bp cut by end-April.  
   • Governor’s language (“adequately positive”) plus 100 bp CRR easing signals preference for gradualism, not aggressive easing.  
   Weak evidence  
   • Business-lobby calls for large cuts (pure advocacy).  
   • Geopolitical headlines (US-Iran tension) – could hit rupee but historically short-lived.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Days to resolution: 92. Two regular MPC meetings remain (9 Mar, ≈27 Apr). SBP almost never moves between meetings. Halving the horizon (to mid-Mar) would sharply increase the “no-change” probability; doubling it (to Jul-26) would increase chances of another 25-50 bp cut.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view base-rate for a 90-day window with tame inflation: 46 percent hold, 47 percent 50 bp cut, 7 percent other.  
   Inside factors that pull toward a cut: disinflation complete, growth still soft, liquidity injected via lower CRR.  
   Inside factors that restrain: IMF insists on positive real rate; current-account already widening; Fed yet to ease.  
   Net: shift 7 percentage-points of mass from “hold” to “50 bp cut”, leave small hike tail for rupee/oil shock.

Probability calibration
   Mass allocation (discrete 25-bp grid):
      9.5 %  8 %
      9.75 % 12 %
      10.0 % 35 %
      10.25 % 12 %
      10.5 % 18 %
      10.75 % 5 %
      11.0 % 5 %
      11.5 % 5 %
   90 % credible range: 9.5 % – 10.75 %.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: SBP policy rate (%) at 23:59 UTC 1 May 2026.  
2. Base-rate centred on 50 bp cut within 90 days when inflation inside band.  
3. Implied median = 10.0 %; mean ≈ 10.16 %; consistent with “one-cut-most-likely”.  
4. Key evidence: (a) current rate 10.5 %; (b) inflation 5.6 % within target; (c) IMF positive-real-rate constraint; (d) SBP’s historical cadence; (e) market curve points to 10.0 %.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rupee crash forcing emergency 200 bp hike – would push outcome to ≥11.5 %.
