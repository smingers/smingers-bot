Key factors expected to pressure the ruble include stagnating export revenues due to lower oil prices, gradual recovery of imports after a prolonged pause, a reduction in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange sales linked to the National Wealth Fund (NWF) operations, and a decline in the key interest rate. The analysts noted that forecasting the ruble's movement in the current 'new reality' remains highly complex, with risks skewed toward a stronger ruble under the baseline scenario. SberCIB revised its 2026 dollar forecast downward by \u20bd10 due to improved geopolitical conditions and export volume projections, now expecting the dollar to reach \u20bd80 in February and \u20bd90 by year-end, with the yuan at \u20bd13.2. Four scenarios were outlined based on combinations of external conditions (positive or challenging) and domestic policy (softening or conservative). In the most optimistic case (positive external, soft domestic policy), the dollar is expected to reach \u20bd99. In a negative external, soft domestic policy scenario, the rate would be \u20bd94.5. A positive external, conservative domestic policy scenario leads to \u20bd96. The most pessimistic scenario (negative external, conservative domestic policy) projects a strong ruble at \u20bd84.

The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**Despite Projections: Central Bank May Not Cut Key Rate at Upcoming Meetings**\nDespite widespread expectations, the Central Bank of Russia may not lower its key interest rate at its upcoming meetings on February 13 and March 20, 2026, according to a report by 'Roscongress' which forecasts continued tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, expert opinions vary: Financial analyst Mikhail Belyaev argues that inflation in Russia is non-monetary in nature, driven by pricing behavior of trading organizations, and that effective antitrust enforcement\u2014such as empowering the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to curb excessive price hikes\u2014is essential. Without such measures, inflation will persist. He warns that maintaining a high key rate of 16% annually will stifle business growth due to limited credit access, effectively placing an economic straitjacket on the economy, potentially leading to a survival of only state-supported or subsidized firms. Meanwhile, Georgy Ostapkovich, head of the Center for Conjointure Research at HSE University, challenges the 'Roscongress' forecast, citing a 1.72% cumulative inflation rate from January 1 to 19, suggesting January inflation could exceed 2%\u2014the highest in 10\u201315 years. He also notes that public inflation expectations are around 13.5\u201314.5%, which, per economic theory, justifies maintaining the current rate. However, he highlights signs of economic stagnation and recessionary trends, especially in the civilian sector, driven by the high rate. Ostapkovich believes the Central Bank may choose to prioritize economic stability over inflation control and could symbolically cut the rate by 0.25 percentage points at the February meeting, signaling a shift in policy. He emphasizes that the February decision will be difficult and advocates for supporting the economy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:28 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/economics/2026/01/29/vopreki-prognozam-cb-mozhet-ne-ponizit-klyuchevuyu-stavku-na-blizhayshikh-zasedaniyakh.html)\n\n**RBI to keep interest rates steady at 5.25% through 2026**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep its key policy rate steady at 5.25% through 2026, according to a Reuters poll of 70 economists, with 59 (over 80%) forecasting no change at the February 4\u20136 Monetary Policy Committee meeting. This decision follows a cumulative 125 basis point reduction in benchmark borrowing costs since February 2025, but inflation remains well below the target range, and economic growth\u2014projected at 7.4% this fiscal year and 6.7% next\u2014is being driven primarily by government spending rather than private investment. Despite rate cuts, monetary transmission remains weak, with banks citing liquidity shortages and an inability to lower deposit rates. The rupee has fallen to a record low of 91.9650 against the dollar, pressured by around $4 billion in foreign investor outflows from Indian equities in early 2026. To counter this, the RBI has injected over $23 billion in liquidity through bond purchases, foreign exchange swaps, and repo operations. Economists like Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership argue the RBI should now focus on ensuring policy ease reaches the broader economy. Inflation is expected to average 2.1% in the current fiscal year and rise to 4.0% in the next. Some analysts, including Anil Bhansali of Finrex Treasury Advisors, warn that currency interventions may have drained liquidity, undermining the impact of previous rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:10 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/rbi-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-at-5-25-through-2026-ce7e5bdeda8bf525)\n\n**Big Earnings Day Sandwich Fed's Interest Rate Decision**\nOn January 28, 2026, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its meeting with a monetary policy statement at 2pm ET and a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. No changes to the current 3.50-3.75% federal funds rate are expected. However, the press conference follows a criminal investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice against Powell over $2.5 billion spent on Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell has labeled the action as 'unprecedented' and part of a broader political attack by President Trump, who previously accused Powell of misusing funds, while Powell countered that the president conflated financial figures. Stephen Miran, a Fed governor on loan from the White House and serving as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, is expected to be the only voting member to support a 50 basis-point rate cut today, having previously advocated for 150 bps of cuts in 2026, bringing the rate to 2.00-2.25%\u201450 bps below the current 2.7% inflation rate. Since September 2024, the federal funds rate has declined 175 bps from a peak of 5.25-5.50%, but analysts expect only one or two 25 bps cuts in 2026 unless inflation or labor market conditions shift. In earnings news, Starbucks (SBUX) missed earnings by $0.02 per share but beat revenue estimates by 2.82% to $9.92 billion, driving a 7.5% pre-market gain. AT&T (T) beat estimates by 4 cents to 52 cents per share with revenue up 2.24% to $33.47 billion, marking its third earnings beat in five quarters. V.F. Corp. (VFC) reported a 34.9% earnings beat at $0.58 per share and revenue up 4.26% to $2.88 billion, though a cautious Q4 outlook led to a -5% pre-market drop despite a +12% year-to-date gain. Progressive (PGR) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) beat estimates by +5.2% and +1.6%, respectively, with PGR shares up slightly and ADP down -2.9% before the market open. After the close, Microsoft (MSFT) is expected to report a 20.1% year-over-year earnings increase and 15.2% revenue growth, with shares up over $40 since a recent low. Tesla (TSLA) is projected to report a -38.4% earnings decline and -2.2% revenue drop, continuing its streak of three misses in the last four quarters. IBM (IBM) is expected to grow earnings by 10.5% and revenue by 9.4%, extending its 11-quarter streak of earnings beats, with shares flat year to date but up 30% from a year ago.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-earnings-day-sandwich-feds-interest-rate-decision)\n\n**Gold Price May Reach $10,000 in 2026 Amid Dovish Policy Expectations and Geopolitical Tensions**\nAccording to SBG Securities analyst Adrian Hammond, gold prices could reach $10,000 per ounce in 2026 if monetary policy becomes more accommodative and geopolitical factors continue to drive dollar weakness. Hammond states that gold is now in a 'final stage' where macroeconomic factors\u2014not mining leverage\u2014are driving its momentum. He notes that the investment advantage of holding physical gold over gold stocks has diminished, as returns are already 'in the money,' and further price appreciation offers little additional leverage. While high-cost miners like Harmony Gold (NYSE:HMY) and Sibanye Stillwater (JO:SSWJ) maintain some leverage, the broader sector faces rising risks due to cost inflation, capital expenditures exceeding inflation, increased M&A activity, and rising resource nationalism. Although Hammond sees 20\u201330% further upside in gold prices, he maintains a neutral stance on gold mining stocks. The primary driver of gold's rise is expectations of U.S. rate cuts\u2014currently priced in at two cuts in 2026, but Hammond sees potential for three, which could push gold to $7,000 by year-end under SBG\u2019s base scenario, and up to $10,000 if the Fed adopts a more dovish stance. However, he warns that holding rates steady would lead to a more cautious outcome, with dollar weakness already impacting U.S. inflation and energy prices potentially worsening it. He also expresses a constructive view on crude oil, cautioning that rising energy prices could fuel inflation and ultimately work against gold if prices rise too far beyond fundamentals. He warns of a risk of overvaluation, where excessive easing narratives could lead to a sharp correction if policy remains tighter than expected. Despite this, he does not foresee a steep drop, as long-term inflation remains structurally supportive of gold. The greater near-term risk lies in a divergence\u2014where the Fed maintains a cautious stance while political pressure pushes gold prices higher. Central bank demand continues to support gold, with global reserves increasing by 45 tons in November and China\u2019s official gold holdings projected to reach a record 2,304 tons by Q3 2025. The People\u2019s Bank of China has been adding gold monthly, now accounting for 8.5% of its total reserves. Investment flows are also supportive: gold ETFs are expected to add about 16 million ounces in 2025, and speculative positions on COMEX have grown stronger, with net long exposure surging toward year-end. Hammond notes that despite more hawkish interest rate expectations compared to last year, recent price gains have been reinforced by dollar weakness and rising global political risk. While short-term corrections remain possible if tensions ease or policy stays restrictive, the broader trend remains upward.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:44 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/commodities-news/article-1399100)\n\n**Copom Sets New Interest Rate on 'Super Wednesday' with Expectation of Selic Rate Hold at 15%**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is set to announce the new basic interest rate on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, during a 'superquarta' event when both Brazil and the United States release their monetary policy decisions simultaneously. Analysts widely expect the Selic rate to remain unchanged at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014marking the fourth consecutive meeting with no change after a seven-meeting rate hike cycle that began in September 2024. The decision follows the Copom's previous stance in December 2025, which maintained the rate at 15% to align with the inflation target convergence strategy. The committee emphasized that while its primary goal remains price stability, the decision also aims to moderate economic activity fluctuations and support full employment. Directors stressed the need for caution due to high domestic and external uncertainty, indicating that future policy adjustments may be made if inflation or inflation expectations re-anchor. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to hold its rate steady in the 3.50%\u20133.75% range. Market projections from the Focus report show the Selic rate forecasted at 12.25% by the end of 2026\u2014unchanged for five consecutive weeks\u2014and 10.5% by the end of 2027\u2014unchanged for 50 consecutive weeks. The Selic rate, Brazil\u2019s primary tool for controlling inflation (measured by the IPCA), influences consumer credit, loans, and credit card interest, with higher rates discouraging spending and helping curb inflation. The current 15% rate is the highest in 20 years, following a series of rate hikes after a prior period of cuts that reduced the rate from 13.75% in August 2022 to 10.5% in May 2024.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/economia/copom-define-nova-taxa-de-juros-nesta-quarta-com-expectativa-de-manutencao-da-selic-em-15-28012026/)\n\n**Prudent stimulus**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained its policy interest rate at 10.5% while reducing the cash reserve requirement (CRR) by 100 basis points\u2014bringing the average CRR down to 5% on a fortnightly basis and 3% on a daily basis. This 'tight money, high liquidity' policy signals a strategic recalibration toward supporting economic growth, despite high inflation targets. The CRR reduction is expected to free up Rs300-315 billion in additional lending capacity for banks, with the SBP indicating confidence in the inflation outlook as average inflation remains within the 5-7% target range. The bank has revised its economic growth projection upward by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75-4.75%. However, analysts caution that the impact on credit uptake and growth will likely be modest due to banks' risk aversion and weak private sector demand for expensive credit in a sluggish economy. The current account deficit widened to $1.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, reflecting declining exports and shrinking foreign private and official flows, despite being contained within the 0-1% of GDP target due to strong remittances and stable commodity prices. Fiscal vulnerabilities persist, with a growing shortfall in tax collection, even as interest payment burdens decrease. Growth remains reliant on consumption fueled by earlier monetary easing and remittances, not productivity or competitiveness. The SBP\u2019s decision to hold rates steady reflects a preference for consolidating recent economic stabilization gains, given the fragile and uneven recovery.

According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**PSX sheds over 6,000 points as US-Iran fears hit sentiment**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 6,000 points on January 29, 2026, dropping to a session low of 181,961.14, a decline of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%), after reaching a high of 188,923.39 earlier in the day. The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**Despite Projections: Central Bank May Not Cut Key Rate at Upcoming Meetings**\nDespite widespread expectations, the Central Bank of Russia may not lower its key interest rate at its upcoming meetings on February 13 and March 20, 2026, according to a report by 'Roscongress' which forecasts continued tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, expert opinions vary: Financial analyst Mikhail Belyaev argues that inflation in Russia is non-monetary in nature, driven by pricing behavior of trading organizations, and that effective antitrust enforcement\u2014such as empowering the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to curb excessive price hikes\u2014is essential. Without such measures, inflation will persist. He warns that maintaining a high key rate of 16% annually will stifle business growth due to limited credit access, effectively placing an economic straitjacket on the economy, potentially leading to a survival of only state-supported or subsidized firms. Meanwhile, Georgy Ostapkovich, head of the Center for Conjointure Research at HSE University, challenges the 'Roscongress' forecast, citing a 1.72% cumulative inflation rate from January 1 to 19, suggesting January inflation could exceed 2%\u2014the highest in 10\u201315 years. He also notes that public inflation expectations are around 13.5\u201314.5%, which, per economic theory, justifies maintaining the current rate. However, he highlights signs of economic stagnation and recessionary trends, especially in the civilian sector, driven by the high rate. Ostapkovich believes the Central Bank may choose to prioritize economic stability over inflation control and could symbolically cut the rate by 0.25 percentage points at the February meeting, signaling a shift in policy. He emphasizes that the February decision will be difficult and advocates for supporting the economy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:28 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/economics/2026/01/29/vopreki-prognozam-cb-mozhet-ne-ponizit-klyuchevuyu-stavku-na-blizhayshikh-zasedaniyakh.html)\n\n**What Should Be the Size of the BC's March Interest Rate Cut? Analysts Weigh In**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) signaled on January 29, 2026, that the cycle of interest rate cuts will begin in March, following its unanimous decision to keep the Selic rate unchanged at 15% per year. This decision, which reflects reduced inflationary pressure, marks the first step after nearly two years of rate hikes that raised the Selic from 10.75% in May 2024 to 15% since June of the previous year. Analysts have offered diverse forecasts for the magnitude of the first cut in March. Fernanda Guardado (BNP Paribas) predicts a cautious start with a 0.25 percentage point cut in March and 0.50 in the next meeting, expecting the Selic to reach 12% by year-end. Fernando Gon\u00e7alves (Ita\u00fa) believes the cut could be either 0.25 or 0.50 points, depending on inflation and exchange rate data, with the market likely pricing a middle path. Alberto Ramos (Goldman Sachs) sees the Copom as more dovish than expected, with the key question being whether the first cut will be 0.25 or 0.50 points. Gustavo Pessoa (Legacy Capital) is more optimistic, forecasting an initial 0.50-point cut and a 'large cycle' of reductions, driven by the central bank's use of the term 'serenity' in its statement. Lu\u00eds Ot\u00e1vio Leal (G5 Partners) expects a cut to 14.50% in March and a final rate of 12.50% by year-end, citing high real interest rates (10.74% past IPCA, 10.99% projected). S\u00e9rgio Goldenstein (Eytse Estrat\u00e9gia) also predicts a 0.50-point cut, noting the Copom\u2019s softened tone, including the removal of language requiring a significantly contractionary policy for a prolonged period and the absence of a commitment to re-tighten if needed. The central bank explicitly stated that the process of monetary policy easing begins in March.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/financas/noticia/2026/01/29/qual-deve-ser-o-corte-nos-juros-que-o-bc-promete-fazer-em-marco-analistas-respondem.ghtml)\n\n**RBI to keep interest rates steady at 5.25% through 2026**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep its key policy rate steady at 5.25% through 2026, according to a Reuters poll of 70 economists, with 59 (over 80%) forecasting no change at the February 4\u20136 Monetary Policy Committee meeting. This decision follows a cumulative 125 basis point reduction in benchmark borrowing costs since February 2025, but inflation remains well below the target range, and economic growth\u2014projected at 7.4% this fiscal year and 6.7% next\u2014is being driven primarily by government spending rather than private investment. Despite rate cuts, monetary transmission remains weak, with banks citing liquidity shortages and an inability to lower deposit rates. The rupee has fallen to a record low of 91.9650 against the dollar, pressured by around $4 billion in foreign investor outflows from Indian equities in early 2026. To counter this, the RBI has injected over $23 billion in liquidity through bond purchases, foreign exchange swaps, and repo operations. Economists like Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership argue the RBI should now focus on ensuring policy ease reaches the broader economy. Inflation is expected to average 2.1% in the current fiscal year and rise to 4.0% in the next. Some analysts, including Anil Bhansali of Finrex Treasury Advisors, warn that currency interventions may have drained liquidity, undermining the impact of previous rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:10 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/rbi-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-at-5-25-through-2026-ce7e5bdeda8bf525)\n\n**Big Earnings Day Sandwich Fed's Interest Rate Decision**\nOn January 28, 2026, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its meeting with a monetary policy statement at 2pm ET and a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. No changes to the current 3.50-3.75% federal funds rate are expected. However, the press conference follows a criminal investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice against Powell over $2.5 billion spent on Federal Reserve building renovations. Powell has labeled the action as 'unprecedented' and part of a broader political attack by President Trump, who previously accused Powell of misusing funds, while Powell countered that the president conflated financial figures. Stephen Miran, a Fed governor on loan from the White House and serving as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, is expected to be the only voting member to support a 50 basis-point rate cut today, having previously advocated for 150 bps of cuts in 2026, bringing the rate to 2.00-2.25%\u201450 bps below the current 2.7% inflation rate. Since September 2024, the federal funds rate has declined 175 bps from a peak of 5.25-5.50%, but analysts expect only one or two 25 bps cuts in 2026 unless inflation or labor market conditions shift. In earnings news, Starbucks (SBUX) missed earnings by $0.02 per share but beat revenue estimates by 2.82% to $9.92 billion, driving a 7.5% pre-market gain. AT&T (T) beat estimates by 4 cents to 52 cents per share with revenue up 2.24% to $33.47 billion, marking its third earnings beat in five quarters. V.F. Corp. (VFC) reported a 34.9% earnings beat at $0.58 per share and revenue up 4.26% to $2.88 billion, though a cautious Q4 outlook led to a -5% pre-market drop despite a +12% year-to-date gain. Progressive (PGR) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) beat estimates by +5.2% and +1.6%, respectively, with PGR shares up slightly and ADP down -2.9% before the market open. After the close, Microsoft (MSFT) is expected to report a 20.1% year-over-year earnings increase and 15.2% revenue growth, with shares up over $40 since a recent low. Tesla (TSLA) is projected to report a -38.4% earnings decline and -2.2% revenue drop, continuing its streak of three misses in the last four quarters. IBM (IBM) is expected to grow earnings by 10.5% and revenue by 9.4%, extending its 11-quarter streak of earnings beats, with shares flat year to date but up 30% from a year ago.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-earnings-day-sandwich-feds-interest-rate-decision)\n\n**Gold Price May Reach $10,000 in 2026 Amid Dovish Policy Expectations and Geopolitical Tensions**\nAccording to SBG Securities analyst Adrian Hammond, gold prices could reach $10,000 per ounce in 2026 if monetary policy becomes more accommodative and geopolitical factors continue to drive dollar weakness. Hammond states that gold is now in a 'final stage' where macroeconomic factors\u2014not mining leverage\u2014are driving its momentum. He notes that the investment advantage of holding physical gold over gold stocks has diminished, as returns are already 'in the money,' and further price appreciation offers little additional leverage. While high-cost miners like Harmony Gold (NYSE:HMY) and Sibanye Stillwater (JO:SSWJ) maintain some leverage, the broader sector faces rising risks due to cost inflation, capital expenditures exceeding inflation, increased M&A activity, and rising resource nationalism. Although Hammond sees 20\u201330% further upside in gold prices, he maintains a neutral stance on gold mining stocks. The primary driver of gold's rise is expectations of U.S. rate cuts\u2014currently priced in at two cuts in 2026, but Hammond sees potential for three, which could push gold to $7,000 by year-end under SBG\u2019s base scenario, and up to $10,000 if the Fed adopts a more dovish stance. However, he warns that holding rates steady would lead to a more cautious outcome, with dollar weakness already impacting U.S. inflation and energy prices potentially worsening it. He also expresses a constructive view on crude oil, cautioning that rising energy prices could fuel inflation and ultimately work against gold if prices rise too far beyond fundamentals. He warns of a risk of overvaluation, where excessive easing narratives could lead to a sharp correction if policy remains tighter than expected. Despite this, he does not foresee a steep drop, as long-term inflation remains structurally supportive of gold. The greater near-term risk lies in a divergence\u2014where the Fed maintains a cautious stance while political pressure pushes gold prices higher. Central bank demand continues to support gold, with global reserves increasing by 45 tons in November and China\u2019s official gold holdings projected to reach a record 2,304 tons by Q3 2025. The People\u2019s Bank of China has been adding gold monthly, now accounting for 8.5% of its total reserves. Investment flows are also supportive: gold ETFs are expected to add about 16 million ounces in 2025, and speculative positions on COMEX have grown stronger, with net long exposure surging toward year-end. Hammond notes that despite more hawkish interest rate expectations compared to last year, recent price gains have been reinforced by dollar weakness and rising global political risk. While short-term corrections remain possible if tensions ease or policy stays restrictive, the broader trend remains upward.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:44 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/commodities-news/article-1399100)\n\n**Copom Sets New Interest Rate on 'Super Wednesday' with Expectation of Selic Rate Hold at 15%**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is set to announce the new basic interest rate on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, during a 'superquarta' event when both Brazil and the United States release their monetary policy decisions simultaneously. Analysts widely expect the Selic rate to remain unchanged at 15% per year\u2014the highest level since 2006\u2014marking the fourth consecutive meeting with no change after a seven-meeting rate hike cycle that began in September 2024. The decision follows the Copom's previous stance in December 2025, which maintained the rate at 15% to align with the inflation target convergence strategy. The committee emphasized that while its primary goal remains price stability, the decision also aims to moderate economic activity fluctuations and support full employment. Directors stressed the need for caution due to high domestic and external uncertainty, indicating that future policy adjustments may be made if inflation or inflation expectations re-anchor. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to hold its rate steady in the 3.50%\u20133.75% range. Market projections from the Focus report show the Selic rate forecasted at 12.25% by the end of 2026\u2014unchanged for five consecutive weeks\u2014and 10.5% by the end of 2027\u2014unchanged for 50 consecutive weeks. The Selic rate, Brazil\u2019s primary tool for controlling inflation (measured by the IPCA), influences consumer credit, loans, and credit card interest, with higher rates discouraging spending and helping curb inflation. The current 15% rate is the highest in 20 years, following a series of rate hikes after a prior period of cuts that reduced the rate from 13.75% in August 2022 to 10.5% in May 2024.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/economia/copom-define-nova-taxa-de-juros-nesta-quarta-com-expectativa-de-manutencao-da-selic-em-15-28012026/)\n\n**Prudent stimulus**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained its policy interest rate at 10.5% while reducing the cash reserve requirement (CRR) by 100 basis points\u2014bringing the average CRR down to 5% on a fortnightly basis and 3% on a daily basis. This 'tight money, high liquidity' policy signals a strategic recalibration toward supporting economic growth, despite high inflation targets. The CRR reduction is expected to free up Rs300-315 billion in additional lending capacity for banks, with the SBP indicating confidence in the inflation outlook as average inflation remains within the 5-7% target range. The bank has revised its economic growth projection upward by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75-4.75%. However, analysts caution that the impact on credit uptake and growth will likely be modest due to banks' risk aversion and weak private sector demand for expensive credit in a sluggish economy. The current account deficit widened to $1.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, reflecting declining exports and shrinking foreign private and official flows, despite being contained within the 0-1% of GDP target due to strong remittances and stable commodity prices. Fiscal vulnerabilities persist, with a growing shortfall in tax collection, even as interest payment burdens decrease. Growth remains reliant on consumption fueled by earlier monetary easing and remittances, not productivity or competitiveness. The SBP\u2019s decision to hold rates steady reflects a preference for consolidating recent economic stabilization gains, given the fragile and uneven recovery.

The Monetary Policy Committee cited the need to balance economic growth with risks from persistent internal and external vulnerabilities. Core inflation remained high at 7.4% (vs. headline inflation of 5.6% in December), and economic growth projections were revised upward due to productivity gains, making a rate cut potentially risky for overheating. The government\u2019s fiscal position is weak, with FBR tax collections falling short of targets, and a widening trade deficit poses current account pressure. However, high remittances and favorable global commodity prices are currently mitigating these risks. Instead of cutting rates, the SBP reduced the average Cash Reserve Requirement for banks from 6% to 5%, aiming to increase credit availability and inject liquidity without broad monetary easing that could threaten price stability or foreign exchange reserves\u2014projected to exceed $18 billion by June 2026. The decision reflects cautious optimism, prioritizing consolidation of recent macroeconomic gains over further stimulus, and aims to build a durable foundation for growth while shielding against external shocks from global conflict and shifting trade policies by major economies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 09:23 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2589388/unchanged-policy-rate-4)\n\n**SBP Likely to Cut Policy Rate Next Week**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points (bps) at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on Monday, January 23, 2026, according to a Reuters poll. Seven out of ten analysts forecast a 50bps reduction, two predict a 75bps cut, and one expects rates to remain unchanged, with the median forecast aligning with a 50bps decrease. If implemented, the policy rate would fall to 10.5 percent. Since mid-2024, the SBP has cumulatively reduced rates by 1,150bps. Analysts cite moderating inflation, higher foreign exchange reserves, and an improved balance of payments outlook as key drivers for the anticipated cut. Some analysts suggest conditions are favorable for a faster easing cycle, while others caution against premature easing due to risks from global tensions and potential fuel price volatility. The International Monetary Fund has also warned Pakistan against premature monetary easing under its $7 billion loan program. The SBP confirmed that inflation remained within its 5-7 percent target range from July to November 2025 but cautioned that core inflation remains sticky and headline inflation could rise temporarily.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 10:07 AM\nSource:[ProPakistani](https://propakistani.pk/2026/01/23/sbp-likely-to-cut-policy-rate-next-week/)\n\n**State Bank may hold rate at 11% as IMF flags risks**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 11% in its upcoming meeting, according to a Reuters poll of 12 analysts, all of whom forecast no rate cut.

The SBP\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee maintained the benchmark interest rate unchanged in its last meeting, reflecting caution amid inflationary pressures despite a generally stable trend since May 2025. Analysts and independent economists also ruled out a rate cut, citing rising inflation and the central bank\u2019s focus on macroeconomic stability. The World Bank projected Pakistan\u2019s GDP growth at 2.6% for FY26, reflecting subdued expectations amid structural challenges. Governor Ahmed highlighted that the SBP has built up foreign exchange reserves by purchasing approximately $20 billion from the interbank market over the past three years, calling it a 'carefully planned move' that strengthened the country\u2019s economic position. On trade, he noted increased US buyer interest in Pakistani textiles despite a 19% tariff on their products, particularly as Indian textiles face a 50% tariff in the US. However, he acknowledged that high domestic production and energy costs remain significant barriers to exporters fully capitalizing on this opportunity, requiring time and policy support to realize benefits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 01:50 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1947335)\n\n**UPDATE 2-Pakistan holds key policy rate for third straight time as floods stoke inflation fears | Business**\nPakistan\u2019s central bank kept its key policy rate unchanged at 11% for a third consecutive meeting, signalling a pause in monetary easing as it weighs the inflationary impact of flood\u2011damaged crops against a fragile economic recovery.  The decision follows a sharp 1,100\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut since June 2024, when the rate stood at a record 22% after inflation peaked near 40% in 2023.  The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stated the economy is on a 'significantly stronger footing' to absorb the flood fallout, but warned that crop losses and supply\u2011chain disruptions could \"push up headline inflation and the current account deficit from earlier expectation in FY26.\"  Inflation eased to 3% in August from 4.1% in July, yet the SBP projects it may breach its 5\u20117% target range for most of the second half of the 2026 financial year before returning to the range in 2027.  The bank also noted that food\u2011price pressures could be partly offset by recent electricity\u2011tariff cuts.  Floods in Punjab have killed over 950 people, displaced 4.5\u202fmillion, and disrupted supply chains, raising concerns that the temporary yet significant flood\u2011induced supply shock could \"push up headline inflation and the current account deficit from earlier expectation in FY26.\"  The SBP forecasts 2026 GDP growth near the lower end of its 3.25\u20114.25% forecast range and expects foreign reserves to rise to about $15.5\u202fbillion by December.  Analysts in a Reuters poll largely anticipated a hold, with only one predicting a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut.  Fawad Basir, head of research at KTrade, said the SBP\u2019s cautious stance reflects a mindful approach to potential repercussions for the exchange rate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3628552-update-2-pakistan-holds-key-policy-rate-for-third-straight-time-as-floods-stoke-inflation-fears)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
