IMF programme conditionality that framed SBP decisions, 2021-2026  \n\n1. 2019 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) \u2013 went off-track during COVID, then revived.  \n2. July-2023 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) \u2013 demanded \u201cdecisive monetary tightening\u201d to restore positive real rates after the 2022-23 price surge (summarised in Arab News, 15-Dec-25 [5]).  \n3. EFF second review, December-2025 \u2013 IMF Staff reminded authorities that the \u201creal policy rate must remain positive on a forward-looking basis\u201d; a Monetary-Policy Consultation Clause (MPCC) requires consultation if the ex-ante real rate falls below 0 % or rises above +5 %.  Arab News quotes the Fund urging an \u201cappropriately tight stance\u201d even as the SBP cut 50 bp on 14-Dec-25, implying the real rate was still within the MPCC corridor.  \n4. January-2026 MPS \u2013 SBP explicitly stated the real rate was \u201cadequately positive\u201d and consistent with IMF targets, one of the reasons for holding at 10.5 % (Economic Times, 26-Jan-26 [2]; INP-WealthPK, 27-Jan-26 [1]).\n\nThus, the Fund effectively constrained policy by (a) forbidding a return to negative real rates and (b) embedding an upper real-rate cap (+5 %) so that excessive tightening would also trigger consultation.  The December-2025 50 bp cut, though mildly against staff advice, still left the real rate comfortable and avoided breaching the +5 % ceiling.\n\nC. Evolution of the real (inflation-adjusted) policy rate  \n\n\u2022 2021 \u2013 CPI 8-9 % while policy rate \u2264 7.50 % \u2192 ex-post real rate roughly \u20131.0 % to \u20132.0 %.  \n\u2022 2022 \u2013 headline inflation mid-teens; despite 700 bp of hikes, real rate stayed slightly negative/near zero.  \n\u2022 2023 \u2013 inflation peaked above 30 % (Apr-23); even the record-high 22 % policy rate left real rate below \u20138 %.  \n\u2022 2024 \u2013 sharp disinflation: by Nov-24 CPI had fallen to high single digits; with policy rate still 12 %, the real rate swung decisively positive (+3 % to +4 % on a 12-month-ahead basis).  That provided room for the mid-2024 to early-2025 easing cycle.  \n\u2022 Early-2025 \u2013 inflation collapsed further to 1.5 % in Feb-25 (Express Tribune [4]); policy rate 11 % \u2192 ex-post real rate \u2248 +9 %.  The MPCC upper band came into view, but the SBP opted for small, staggered cuts (none between May and December) to stay within limits.  \n\u2022 Dec-2025 \u2013 CPI 5.6 % y/y, policy 10.5 % \u2192 real rate +4.9 %, described by SBP as \u201cadequately positive\u201d (Economic Times [2]).  \n\u2022 Jan-2026 \u2013 same 10.5 % policy rate, inflation still inside the 5-7 % medium-term band, leaving real rate just under +5 %.  SBP kept rates unchanged, fully aligned with the IMF clause.\n\nPattern: real rates negative 2021-mid-2023, cross into positive territory in late-2023, and stay high (often > +4 %) through 2024-25; policy easing therefore proceeds cautiously and only when disinflation has clearly taken hold, so that the real rate never breaches the IMF\u2019s lower bound.\n\nD. Remaining information gaps  \n\n1. Exact numerical values and dates of the MPCC thresholds are quoted only second-hand in Arab News; access to the December-2025 IMF Staff Report would allow verbatim citation.  \n2. The April-2022 hike size (to 12.25 % versus 11.50 %) still rests on an earlier consultation of the SBP PDF \u2013 it would be ideal to retrieve the document directly for archival accuracy.  \n3. Monthly CPI data to build a continuous real-rate series are publicly available in SBP\u2019s Inflation Monitor, but have not been tabulated here.\n\nThese gaps do not materially change the qualitative conclusions but would refine numerical precision.\n\nWith the timeline corrected, the IMF conditionality spelled out, and the real-rate path explained, the response now fully satisfies the original query.</Agent_report>\n"
