Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FXEmpire (January 2026):** Reports the most recent MPC decision from January 26, 2026. Despite metadata showing 2023, the content clearly describes January 2026 events (current policy rate at 10.5%, inflation at 5.6% in December). High-quality factual data directly from SBP's latest monetary policy statement. The source provides key metrics: inflation within 5-7% target, GDP growth at 3.7% YoY, and FX reserves at $16.1 billion trending toward $18 billion by June 2026.

**CEIC Data (November 2025):** Historical data aggregator showing policy rate at 12.00% in November 2025. This creates a discrepancy with other sources that suggest the rate was already lower by late 2025. The historical range (6.25% to 23.00%) provides useful context but the November 2025 figure appears outdated or incorrect given subsequent reports.

**World Bank Open Data:** Incomplete extraction with no actionable data for forecasting. Can be disregarded.

**Dawn (January 26, 2026 - two versions):** Highly credible Pakistani newspaper providing detailed coverage of the January 26, 2026 MPC decision. Confirms 10.5% policy rate maintained, contrary to market expectations of a cut. Critical factual detail: the previous meeting (December 15, 2025) cut rates by 50bp to 10.5% from 11.0%. This establishes the recent trajectory. The source quotes SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed and provides comprehensive economic context.

**Dunya News (January 26, 2026):** Corroborates Dawn's reporting on the January 26 decision. Adds important forward-looking statement: SBP expects inflation to "temporarily exceed" the 5-7% target for a few months in 2026 before stabilizing. Also notes the CRR reduction from 6% to 5%, signaling accommodative bias despite rate hold.

**Agent Report:** Provides fragmentary historical timeline but acknowledges massive data gaps. Most useful finding: confirms the December 15, 2025 rate was 11.0% (cut by 50bp to 10.5%). Historical context shows peak of 22% in June 2023 and a dramatic easing cycle through 2024-2025. The report notes 27 of 33 MPC meetings lack documented rate changes, limiting historical pattern analysis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Pakistan's post-crisis easing cycles (2008-2009, 2019-2020)**
After periods of high inflation and tight monetary policy, Pakistan typically eases 300-500bp over 12-18 months when inflation stabilizes. However, these cycles occurred under different IMF program structures and inflation dynamics.

**Reference Class 2: Emerging market central banks with IMF programs and inflation targeting (2020-2025)**
Countries like Egypt, Sri Lanka, and Argentina under IMF programs typically maintain real positive rates (policy rate minus inflation) of 2-5% to ensure external stability and meet program conditions. Current Pakistan real rate: 10.5% - 5.6% = 4.9%, within this range.

**Reference Class 3: Pakistan's 2024-2026 easing cycle (most suitable)**
From peak of 22% (June 2023) to 10.5% (January 2026) = 1,150bp reduction over 31 months. The cycle has shown:
- Aggressive initial cuts (150-200bp) when inflation fell sharply
- Gradual moderation (50-100bp cuts) as rates approached neutral
- Recent pause despite market expectations, suggesting SBP is nearing terminal rate

This reference class is most suitable because it captures current IMF program constraints, inflation dynamics, and central bank reaction function.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 93 days (January 29 to May 1, 2026)

**Scheduled MPC meetings before May 1, 2026:**
- March 9, 2026 (40 days away)
- Likely one more meeting in late April 2026

**Historical patterns over 3-month periods (2024-2025):**
- The easing cycle has shown 0-100bp cuts per meeting
- Recent trend: 50bp cut (December 2025), then hold (January 2026)
- Average cut per meeting in late 2025: approximately 50bp
- SBP has never cut more than 150bp in a single meeting

**Key factors for next 3 months:**
1. **Inflation trajectory:** Currently 5.6%, expected to temporarily exceed 7% before stabilizing
2. **IMF review:** Expected in Feb-March 2026, typically requires maintaining tight monetary conditions
3. **FX reserves:** Building toward $18bn target, reducing pressure for tight policy
4. **Real rate:** At 4.9%, still positive and restrictive
5. **Market expectations:** Were wrong in January (expected cut, got hold), suggesting SBP more hawkish than anticipated

## (d) Justification for Outside View

The most likely scenario involves 0-2 rate cuts of 25-50bp each before May 1, 2026, resulting in a terminal rate between 9.5% and 10.5%.

**Bullish case for deeper cuts (toward 9.0-9.5%):**
- Inflation within target, growth accelerating (3.7% YoY)
- CRR reduction signals accommodative bias
- FX reserves improving, reducing external vulnerability
- Historical pattern suggests continued gradual easing

**Bearish case for holding/minimal cuts (toward 10.5%):**
- SBP just surprised markets by holding in January despite expectations
- Inflation expected to temporarily exceed 7% target
- IMF review in Q1 2026 typically constrains policy flexibility
- Real rate of 4.9% already accommodative by EM standards
- Governor's emphasis on "price stability" suggests caution

**Central scenario (10.0%):**
- One 50bp cut at March 9 meeting, reaching 10.0%
- Hold in late April given inflation concerns
- Consistent with gradual approach and IMF coordination

The uncertainty range is relatively narrow (9.0-11.0%) because:
1. SBP is clearly in late-stage easing, not tightening
2. Dramatic moves (>100bp) are unprecedented in this cycle
3. The 10.5% hold in January suggests terminal rate is close
4. IMF program constrains policy space

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:

1. **Central tendency around 10.0-10.5%:** The January hold was significant, suggesting SBP views 10.5% as close to appropriate. However, with 93 days and 2 MPC meetings remaining, one 50bp cut is more likely than not.

2. **Asymmetric risks:** Slightly higher probability of rates staying at 10.5% (no cuts) than falling to 9.5% (two 50bp cuts), because:
   - SBP just demonstrated hawkish surprise
   - Inflation expected to temporarily rise
   - IMF review creates inertia

3. **Tail risks are limited:**
   - Lower tail (8.5-9.0%): Would require aggressive 150-200bp cutting, inconsistent with recent cautious approach and inflation concerns. Probability <10%.
   - Upper tail (11.0-11.5%): Would require rate hike, extremely unlikely given easing cycle and improving fundamentals. Probability <5%.

4. **Historical volatility:** Pakistan's policy rate showed 200-300bp quarterly moves during crisis (2022-2023) but only 50-100bp in stabilization phase (2024-2026). Current environment is stabilization, not crisis.

5. **Tethering to established patterns:**
   - The 50bp cut increments have been standard in recent meetings
   - Zero cuts in 93 days is plausible (20-25% probability)
   - One cut of 50bp is most likely (50% probability)
   - Two cuts totaling 100bp is possible but less likely (20% probability)
   - More than 100bp in cuts is very unlikely (<5% probability)

6. **90/10 confidence interval:** Should span roughly 9.5% to 11.0%, representing a 150bp range. This accounts for:
   - Possibility of no action (10.5%)
   - Possibility of two standard cuts (9.5%)
   - Small probability of non-standard moves or external shocks
