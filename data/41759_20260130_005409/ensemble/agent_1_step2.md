## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources on Pakistan (High Quality, Current):**

1. **Tribune.com.pk (January 26, 2026)**: Factual report on SBP's January 26 MPC decision maintaining 10.5% rate. Key facts: inflation 5.6% (Dec 2025), GDP growth 3.75-4.75% projected, forex reserves $16.1bn. Named source: Governor Jameel Ahmad. Industry opinion from FPCCI (Atif Ikram Sheikh) demanding 350bp cut - this is advocacy, not prediction. **Quality: Excellent for facts, opinions clearly attributed.**

2. **Dawn.com (January 26, 2026)**: Corroborates Tribune reporting. Adds crucial detail: previous meeting (Dec 15, 2025) cut 50bp to reach 10.5%. Core inflation at 7.4% (higher than headline). Market survey by Topline Securities showed majority expected cut - SBP surprised hawkish. **Quality: Excellent, Pakistan's leading English newspaper.**

3. **Brecorder.com (January 26, 2026)**: Third independent confirmation of Jan 26 hold at 10.5%. Adds market expectations detail: Arif Habib Limited expected 75bp cut (43.5% of survey), Reuters poll showed 7/10 analysts expected 50bp cut. Governor projects inflation could exceed 7% in H2 FY26. **Quality: Excellent for establishing consensus surprise.**

**Secondary/Contextual Sources:**

4. **J.P. Morgan (January 16, 2026)**: US Fed analysis only - not relevant to SBP. Michael Feroli expects Fed hold through 2026. **Quality: High but irrelevant.**

5. **Bankrate (January 6, 2026)**: US mortgage rate forecasts - not relevant. **Quality: Irrelevant.**

6. **AskNews articles**: Predominantly covering US Fed (Jan 29 hold at 3.5-3.75%), India RBI (Feb 4-6 meeting expected), Poland RPP (rate cut expectations), Germany growth forecasts. **None directly address SBP.** The India RBI coverage shows 42% of CEOs expect 25bp cut in next 6 months, but RBI has already cut 125bp since Feb 2025 - different cycle stage than Pakistan. **Quality: High but geographically irrelevant.**

**Key Factual Findings:**
- Current rate: 10.5% (as of Jan 26, 2026)
- Previous cut: 50bp on Dec 15, 2025 (from 11.0% to 10.5%)
- Inflation: 5.6% headline, 7.4% core (Dec 2025)
- Expected inflation trajectory: May temporarily exceed 7% in coming months
- GDP growth: 3.7% YoY (Q1 FY26), projected 3.75-4.75%
- FX reserves: $16.1bn, trending to $18bn by June 2026
- Real rate: 10.5% - 5.6% = 4.9%

**Expert Opinions (Named, Credible):**
- **Governor Jameel Ahmad**: Emphasizes "adequately positive" real rate to stabilize inflation in 5-7% target
- **Market consensus (Jan 2026)**: Expected cuts but was wrong - SBP more hawkish than anticipated

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Major Impact on Forecast):**

1. **January 26 hawkish surprise (multiple sources)**: SBP held rates despite 80%+ market expectation of 50-75bp cut. This is a revealed preference showing SBP's true reaction function is more conservative than market pricing. **Impact: Significantly reduces probability of aggressive cutting before May 1.**

2. **Governor's forward guidance**: Statement that real rate is "adequately positive" at current 4.9% suggests limited room for cuts. Projection that inflation will "temporarily exceed 7%" creates explicit rationale for caution. **Impact: Shifts distribution toward fewer/smaller cuts.**

3. **Recent cutting pace deceleration**: From aggressive 100-150bp cuts in mid-2025 to 50bp (Dec 2025) to 0bp (Jan 2026). This is a clear pattern of approaching terminal rate. **Impact: Strong evidence cycle is ending, not continuing at previous pace.**

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Time to resolution (93 days, ~2 MPC meetings)**: Limited time constrains total possible movement. Even if SBP resumes cutting, only 2 decision points remain. Historical pattern shows 50bp as standard increment. **Impact: Narrows distribution range to roughly 9.5-10.5%.**

5. **IMF program dynamics**: Pakistan under Extended Fund Facility requires maintaining macroeconomic stability. Typical IMF reviews in Q1. While not explicitly mentioned in sources, this is structural constraint on aggressive easing. **Impact: Moderate constraint on dovish scenarios.**

6. **FX reserve improvement**: $16.1bn trending to $18bn reduces balance of payments pressure that previously necessitated tight policy. **Impact: Modest support for continued gradual easing.**

**Weak Evidence:**

7. **Industry advocacy for lower rates**: FPCCI demanding 7% rate is political pressure, not predictive. Central banks typically resist such pressure under IMF programs. **Impact: Minimal - noise not signal.**

8. **Core vs headline inflation divergence**: Core at 7.4% vs headline 5.6% suggests underlying price pressures remain. **Impact: Small hawkish tilt but already reflected in Governor's statements.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe: 93 days (Jan 29 - May 1, 2026)**

**Scheduled MPC meetings:**
- Next meeting: Likely early-to-mid March 2026 (40-45 days)
- Following meeting: Late April 2026 (85-90 days)
- Total: 2 decision points

**Scenario Analysis by Timeframe:**

**If timeframe halved to ~45 days (1 meeting):**
- Distribution would collapse toward 10.0-10.5%
- Single meeting allows maximum one 50bp cut
- Percentile 10-90 range: 10.0-10.5% (50bp spread vs current 150bp)
- Higher probability of no change (40%+) given January surprise

**If timeframe doubled to ~180 days (4 meetings):**
- Distribution would widen toward 9.0-11.0%
- Four meetings allow cumulative 100-200bp movement
- More time for inflation data to evolve, potentially justifying deeper cuts
- Also more time for external shocks (IMF review outcomes, global commodity prices)
- Percentile 10-90 range: 9.0-10.5% (150bp spread, asymmetric)
- Lower probability mass at 10.5% (only 15-20%) as continued hold over 6 months unlikely

**Key timeframe insight**: With only 2 meetings, the distribution must be relatively concentrated. Each meeting can deliver 0bp, 25bp, or 50bp cuts (larger moves unprecedented in this cycle). This creates discrete probability mass at:
- 10.5% (no cuts)
- 10.0% (one 50bp cut)
- 9.75% (one 50bp + one 25bp cut)
- 9.5% (two 50bp cuts)

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Baseline Recap:**
- Central tendency: 10.0-10.5%
- One 50bp cut most likely (50% probability)
- Zero cuts plausible (20-25%)
- Two cuts possible (20%)

**Adjustment Factors:**

**Factor 1: January Hawkish Surprise (Strong Evidence)**
The January 26 hold, contrary to 80%+ market expectations, is the single most important new information. This reveals:
- SBP's reaction function is more conservative than markets understood
- Governor prioritizes inflation stability over growth stimulus
- The "adequately positive" real rate language suggests 4.9% is near optimal, not excessive

**Implication**: Increases probability of 10.5% outcome (no cuts) from 25% to 35-40%. Reduces probability of two cuts from 20% to 10-15%.

**Factor 2: Inflation Forward Guidance (Strong Evidence)**
Governor's explicit statement that inflation will "temporarily exceed 7%" in coming months creates policy constraint. Central banks typically don't cut aggressively into rising inflation, even if temporary.

**Implication**: Further supports holding at 10.5% or limiting to single 50bp cut. Reduces tail probability of reaching 9.5% or below.

**Factor 3: Cycle Maturity (Strong Evidence)**
The deceleration pattern (100bp → 50bp → 0bp) is classic late-cycle behavior. Reference class of EM easing cycles shows final 100-150bp typically delivered over 6-9 months with long pauses.

**Implication**: Even if cutting resumes, pace will be 25-50bp per meeting maximum. Supports concentration of probability mass between 9.75-10.5%.

**Factor 4: Limited Time Horizon (Moderate Evidence)**
Only 93 days with 2 meetings constrains total movement. This is mechanical but important.

**Implication**: Tightens distribution. The 10th-90th percentile range should be ~100-125bp, not 150bp as initially estimated.

**Counterbalancing Factors:**
- FX reserve improvement and growth acceleration (3.7% YoY) do support continued gradual easing
- One 50bp cut in March remains base case given these fundamentals
- Complete freeze at 10.5% through May would be surprising given improving macro conditions

**Net Assessment:**
The January hawkish surprise is sufficiently significant to shift the distribution ~25bp higher (more hawkish) than the initial outside view. The modal outcome shifts from 10.0% to 10.25-10.5%, but one cut to 10.0% remains highly plausible (40-45% probability).

## Probability Calibration

**Discrete Outcome Probabilities:**
- 10.5% (no cuts): 40%
- 10.25% (one 25bp cut): 15%
- 10.0% (one 50bp cut): 30%
- 9.75% (one 50bp + one 25bp): 10%
- 9.5% (two 50bp cuts): 4%
- Below 9.5%: 1%

**Rationale for Distribution Shape:**

**Central Mass (10.0-10.5%, ~85% probability):**
The January hold demonstrated SBP's conservatism, but fundamentals (improving FX reserves, growth within target, inflation within range) still support one cut. The March meeting is 40+ days away, allowing time for February inflation data and IMF review. One 50bp cut to 10.0% balances these factors.

**Lower Tail (9.5-9.75%, ~15% probability):**
Two cuts (100bp total) would require:
1. March inflation data coming in well below 5.6% (unlikely given "temporarily exceed 7%" guidance)
2. Successful IMF review with explicit accommodation blessing
3. External shock (oil price collapse, major Fed dovish pivot)
This scenario is possible but low probability given January's revealed hawkishness.

**Upper Tail (Above 10.5%, <1% probability):**
A rate hike is virtually impossible given:
- Easing cycle clearly established
- Inflation within 5-7% target band
- No external crisis (FX reserves building, not depleting)
The only path to 11.0%+ would be an unforeseen crisis (e.g., IMF program collapse, major currency crisis), which has <1% probability in 93 days given current stability.

**Percentile Mapping:**

Given the discrete nature of 25bp increments and the concentration around 10.0-10.5%, the distribution is relatively flat between these values with sharper drop-offs at the tails:

- **1st percentile**: 9.25% (extreme dovish scenario - three 50bp cuts or equivalent, <1% probability)
- **5th percentile**: 9.5% (two 50bp cuts, requires very dovish surprises)
- **10th percentile**: 9.75% (aggressive cutting resumes)
- **20th percentile**: 10.0% (one 50bp cut, lower end of main probability mass)
- **40th percentile**: 10.0% (modal outcome with one cut)
- **60th percentile**: 10.5% (no cuts, hawkish continuation)
- **80th percentile**: 10.5% (strong probability mass at this level)
- **90th percentile**: 10.5% (very unlikely to go higher)
- **95th percentile**: 10.75% (one 25bp hike, crisis scenario)
- **99th percentile**: 11.0% (major unforeseen crisis requiring tightening)

**Calibration Notes:**
1. The 40-60 percentile spread (10.0-10.5%) captures the core uncertainty: will SBP cut once or hold?
2. The relatively flat distribution between 10.0-10.5% reflects genuine uncertainty between these two most likely outcomes
3. The 10-90 range of 9.75-10.5% (75bp spread) is narrower than typical forecasts but appropriate given: (a) only 2 meetings, (b) 25-50bp standard increments, (c) late-cycle dynamics
4. Asymmetry is moderate: slightly fatter lower tail (dovish surprise) than upper tail (hawkish surprise/crisis), but not extreme given January's hawkish revelation

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: SBP policy rate (%) effective May 1, 2026, per official SBP Monetary Policy Statement

2. **Outside view**: Established 10.0-10.5% central range with one 50bp cut as base case; adjusted 25bp higher (more hawkish) due to January surprise

3. **Consistency**: Implied median ≈10.25%, mean ≈10.2%; aligns with "likely one cut or hold" narrative and January hawkish signal

4. **Key evidence**: (1) Jan 26 hawkish hold vs market expectations, (2) Governor guidance on inflation "temporarily exceeding 7%", (3) Cutting pace deceleration (100→50→0bp), (4) Only 2 meetings remaining, (5) Real rate at 4.9% deemed "adequately positive"

5. **Blind spot**: IMF review in Feb-March explicitly encourages faster easing to support growth, combined with benign inflation data, leading to two 50bp cuts → outcome 9.5%. This would make forecast look too conservative. Alternatively, unexpected inflation spike or external crisis forces hold → outcome stays 10.5%, making lower percentiles too dovish.
