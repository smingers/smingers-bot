Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FXEmpire (January 2026):**
- **Quality:** High - Financial data aggregator with real-time policy rate tracking
- **Key Facts:** Current rate 10.5% (unchanged January 2026), inflation 5.6% (December), GDP growth 3.7% Q1-FY26, reserves building to $18B by FY26-end
- **Opinion vs. Fact:** Factual reporting of MPC decision; projections are official SBP forecasts, not external opinions
- **Date:** January 25, 2026 (current, highly relevant)

**CEIC Data (November 2025):**
- **Quality:** Medium-High - Economic database provider
- **Key Facts:** Policy rate 12.00% in November 2025, historical range 6.25%-23.00%
- **Issue:** Conflicting with other sources showing 10.5% in January 2026. This appears to be outdated or using a different rate definition (reverse repo vs. policy rate)
- **Date:** November 2025 (recent but superseded)

**Dawn News (January 26, 2026) - Two articles:**
- **Quality:** High - Pakistan's leading English newspaper, direct reporting of SBP decisions
- **Key Facts:** Rate held at 10.5% (January 26, 2026), previous cut of 50bp to 10.5% in December 2025, inflation 5.6%, core inflation 7.4%, reserves $16.1B
- **Expert Opinion:** SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed's rationale for holding rates
- **Date:** January 26, 2026 (most current available)

**Dunya News (January 26, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Medium-High - Major Pakistani news outlet
- **Key Facts:** Confirms 10.5% hold, market expected 50-100bp cut, CRR reduced from 6% to 5%
- **Expert Opinion:** Topline Securities (brokerage) market expectations
- **Date:** January 26, 2026 (current)

**Agent Report:**
- **Quality:** Medium - Comprehensive timeline attempt but with significant data gaps
- **Key Facts:** Confirms 10.5% as of January 26, 2026; previous rate 11.0% in December 2025; historical peak 22% (June 2023)
- **Limitations:** Missing 27 of 33 MPC meetings' detailed data from 2022-2026
- **Date:** Compiled from historical sources through January 2026

**Resolution of CEIC Discrepancy:** The 12% figure from CEIC appears to be either: (1) using a different rate definition, (2) outdated data, or (3) a data error. All primary Pakistani sources (Dawn, Dunya, FXEmpire) consistently report 10.5% as the current policy rate in January 2026.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Pakistani rate cycles post-crisis (2023-2026):**
   - Peak: 22% (June 2023) during acute crisis
   - Easing cycle: 22% → 10.5% over 18 months (June 2023 - January 2026)
   - Average monthly cut during easing: ~64bp/month
   - **Suitability:** High - most relevant recent context

2. **Pakistani monetary policy in stable/recovery periods:**
   - Historical average: 11.6% (1992-2026)
   - Historical low: 5.75% (May 2016)
   - **Suitability:** Medium - useful for terminal rate expectations

3. **Emerging market central banks with IMF programs:**
   - Typically maintain positive real rates during program compliance
   - **Suitability:** Medium - provides constraints on how low rates can go

4. **SBP rate-hold periods:**
   - Current hold: January 2026 (after December 2025 cut)
   - Previous hold: January 2024 at 22%
   - **Suitability:** Medium - indicates SBP can pause for multiple meetings

**Selected Reference Class:** Pakistani rate cycle 2023-2026, supplemented by historical averages and IMF program constraints.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 93 days (January 29, 2026 → May 1, 2026)

**Scheduled MPC Meetings Before May 1:**
- March 9, 2026 (confirmed)
- Likely one more in late April (based on ~6-8 week meeting frequency)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar 3-Month Periods:**

*Recent easing cycle (2024-2025):*
- The easing from 22% began in June 2024 (cut to 20.5%, -150bp)
- Subsequent cuts appear gradual but data gaps prevent precise tracking
- December 2025: Cut of 50bp (11.0% → 10.5%)
- January 2026: Hold at 10.5%

*Rate Movement Characteristics:*
- When cutting: Moves of 50-150bp per meeting
- Recent preference: 50bp increments (December 2025)
- Can hold for multiple consecutive meetings when uncertain

**Current Economic Context (January 2026):**
- Inflation: 5.6% (within 5-7% target range)
- Core inflation: 7.4% (elevated)
- Real policy rate: ~4.9% (10.5% - 5.6%)
- GDP growth: Improving (3.7% Q1-FY26)
- Reserves: Building ($16.1B, target $18B by June)
- IMF program: Active EFF/RSF with reviews ongoing

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Factors Supporting Further Cuts (Dovish Scenario):**
1. Inflation within target range (5.6% vs. 5-7% target)
2. Market expectations for cuts (50-100bp anticipated in January, unmet)
3. Historical easing trajectory from 22% peak suggests continued normalization
4. Economic growth recovery supports lower rates
5. Reserves building provides external stability cushion
6. Distance from historical average (11.6%) and low (5.75%) suggests room to cut

**Factors Supporting Hold/Limited Cuts (Hawkish Scenario):**
1. Core inflation elevated at 7.4% (above headline)
2. SBP explicitly stated inflation may "temporarily exceed" 7% in 2026
3. Real rate of ~4.9% already quite accommodative
4. IMF program compliance requires maintaining positive real rates
5. Current account deficit widening ($1.2B in H1-FY26)
6. Fiscal challenges (revenue shortfall Rs 329B)
7. Recent hold (January 2026) despite market expectations suggests caution
8. Global uncertainty (tariffs, geopolitical risks) mentioned as concerns

**Base Case Reasoning:**
- The SBP surprised markets by holding in January despite expectations for cuts
- This signals greater caution than markets anticipated
- However, the overall trajectory remains dovish given the 1,150bp of cuts since June 2023
- With 2 potential MPC meetings before May 1, the most likely path is 0-2 cuts of 50bp each
- Range: 9.5% (two 50bp cuts) to 10.5% (continued hold)
- Central tendency: 10.0% (one 50bp cut at March meeting, hold in April)

**Tail Risks:**
- **Upside (higher rates):** Inflation spike, external shock, IMF program disruption → rates rise back to 11-12%
- **Downside (lower rates):** Rapid disinflation, economic weakness → accelerated cuts to 8-9%

The January hold suggests the SBP is prioritizing price stability over growth, making aggressive cuts (>100bp total) unlikely. However, with inflation controlled and growth recovering, maintaining 10.5% through May also seems unlikely given the easing bias.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring Points:**
1. **Current rate:** 10.5% (January 26, 2026)
2. **Historical average:** 11.6%
3. **Recent low in easing cycle:** 10.5% (current)
4. **Absolute historical low:** 5.75%
5. **Expected inflation range:** 5-7% (may temporarily exceed 7%)

**Meeting Scenarios (2 meetings: March 9, April ~20):**

| Scenario | March Action | April Action | May 1 Rate | Probability Estimate |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Continued hold | 0bp | 0bp | 10.5% | 25% |
| One cut | -50bp | 0bp | 10.0% | 35% |
| Two cuts | -50bp | -50bp | 9.5% | 20% |
| Larger cut(s) | -75bp or more | varies | 9.0-9.75% | 10% |
| Rate increase | +25-50bp | varies | 10.75-11.5% | 5% |
| Aggressive cuts | -100bp+ | -50bp+ | 8.5-9.0% | 5% |

**Distribution Shaping Considerations:**
- The January hold creates inertia toward 10.0-10.5% range
- SBP's cautious tone suggests avoiding aggressive moves
- IMF program compliance constrains downside
- Core inflation at 7.4% limits aggressive easing
- 90% confidence interval should span ~2.5 percentage points

**Calibration Logic:**
- **10th percentile (pessimistic/hawkish):** Inflation resurges or external shock → rate increase to 11.0%
- **20th percentile:** Continued hold through May → 10.5%
- **40th percentile:** One cut by May → 10.0%
- **60th percentile:** One cut executed, second likely → 9.75%
- **80th percentile:** Two cuts executed → 9.5%
- **90th percentile (optimistic/dovish):** Rapid disinflation enables three cuts → 9.0%

This distribution reflects:
- Central tendency around 9.75-10.0% (one to two cuts)
- Asymmetric tails (slightly wider upside given recent hold surprise)
- Recognition that SBP can move in 50bp increments or hold
- Accounting for unknown unknowns (fiscal crisis, external shock, IMF review outcomes)

Outside View Calibration:

The current policy rate is 10.5% as of January 26, 2026. With approximately 93 days until May 1, 2026, and two likely MPC meetings (March 9 and late April), the SBP has opportunities to adjust rates.

The January hold despite market expectations for cuts signals caution, but the overall easing trajectory from the 22% peak suggests continued normalization. Core inflation at 7.4% and IMF program requirements limit aggressive easing, while controlled headline inflation (5.6%) and improving growth support gradual cuts.

The most probable outcome is one 50bp cut (→10.0%), with meaningful probability of either a hold (10.5%) or two cuts (→9.5%). Tail risks include inflation/external shocks pushing rates higher (10.75-11.5%) or rapid disinflation enabling more aggressive cuts (8.5-9.25%).

Setting a 90/10 confidence interval of 9.0-11.0% captures the range of plausible outcomes while accounting for unknown unknowns in Pakistan's volatile economic environment.
