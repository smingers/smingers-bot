Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Pakistan Sources (High Quality, Recent):**
- **Dawn, Express Tribune, Brecorder (Jan 26, 2026)**: Major Pakistani outlets reporting SBP held policy rate at 10.5% on Jan 26. Factual: CPI at 5.6% (Dec 2025), core inflation 7.4%, GDP growth 3.7% (Q1 FY26), forex reserves $16.1bn. SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad (named source) stated real policy rate is "adequately positive" to stabilize inflation in 5-7% target range. High credibility.

- **Market expectations (Jan 26)**: Arif Habib Limited survey showed 43.5% expected 75bp cut, 39.1% expected 50bp cut, only 17.4% expected hold. Reuters poll: 7/10 analysts expected 50bp cut. This represents opinion/speculation, not facts. The surprise hold suggests MPC is more hawkish than market consensus.

- **Industry reaction**: FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh demanded 350bp cut to 7%. This is advocacy, not analysis. Weak evidentiary value.

**Historical Context (Medium Quality):**
- **Agent chronology**: Documents the easing cycle from 22% peak (Sep 2023) through multiple cuts to current 10.5%. Shows pattern: aggressive cuts mid-2024 (150bp June cut), then deceleration (50bp Dec 2025), then pause (Jan 2026). This suggests the MPC is approaching terminal rate. Moderate evidence.

**Global Central Bank Context (Low Relevance):**
- Multiple articles about US Fed, Polish RPP, Indian RBI, German economy. These provide no direct information about SBP decisions. The only weak parallel: global central banks are pausing/slowing easing cycles as inflation stabilizes. Minimal evidentiary value for SBP specifically.

**Key Factual Gaps:**
- No sources mention the next MPC meeting date beyond "one and a half months" from Jan 26 (suggesting early-to-mid March).
- No economist forecasts specifically for May 2026 SBP rate.
- IMF program status unclear from sources (though agent report mentions ongoing engagement).

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Recent pause signals terminal rate approaching** (Jan 26 hold despite market expecting cuts): The MPC's willingness to disappoint market expectations indicates conviction that 10.5% is close to appropriate. Governor's statement that real rate is "adequately positive" suggests limited room for further cuts. This is structural evidence of policy stance shift.

2. **Inflation within target band (5.6%)**: With CPI at the lower end of 5-7% target and projected to remain there through 2027, there's no inflation pressure for further cuts. However, core inflation at 7.4% provides justification for maintaining real positive rates. Strong evidence for cautious easing.

3. **Real policy rate at +490bp**: With policy at 10.5% and CPI at 5.6%, the real rate is exceptionally high by historical standards. The outside view reference class shows this typically leads to further cuts over 3-month windows (median -50bp). Strong evidence for continued easing, but pace matters.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Economic growth improving (3.75-4.75% projection)**: Stronger growth reduces urgency for aggressive easing. The upward revision from earlier estimates suggests economy can handle current rates. Moderate evidence for slower cuts.

2. **Forex reserves building ($16.1bn → $18bn by June)**: Strengthening external position reduces balance-of-payments constraints on monetary policy. Allows MPC more flexibility to cut if desired. Moderate evidence for easing potential.

3. **Historical pattern of 50bp increments**: Recent cuts have been 50bp steps. If MPC cuts again, 50bp is most likely magnitude. Moderate evidence for step-size.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Industry pressure for cuts**: FPCCI demanding 350bp cut to 7% is advocacy without analytical backing. Markets wanted cuts in January but were wrong. Weak evidence.

2. **Global central bank trends**: Other emerging markets pausing easing cycles, but each has unique circumstances. Weak parallel.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeline to May 1, 2026:** 93 days from Jan 29, 2026.

**MPC Meeting Schedule:**
- Last meeting: Jan 26, 2026
- Typical interval: 6-8 weeks
- Expected next meeting: Early-to-mid March 2026 (likely March 9 based on "one and a half months" comment)
- Possible second meeting: Late April 2026 (50-60% probability given typical cadence)

**Scenario Analysis:**
- **One meeting scenario (March only)**: If April meeting doesn't occur or is after May 1, then March decision determines May 1 rate. Single decision point increases hold probability.
- **Two meeting scenario (March + April)**: Two opportunities for adjustment. Historical pattern shows consecutive holds are common once terminal rate is approached, but so are gradual 50bp steps.

**If timeframe halved (46 days to mid-March):**
Would capture only the March meeting. Probability distribution would shift toward hold (40%) and single 50bp cut (45%), with very low probability of two cuts.

**If timeframe doubled (186 days to late July):**
Would capture 3-4 meetings. Much higher probability of multiple cuts totaling 100-150bp, bringing rate toward 9.0-9.5%. The easing cycle would likely conclude within this extended window.

## (d) Justification & Distribution Shift from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rates (from reference class):**
- 90% CI: 9.0% to 11.5%
- Modal outcome: 10.0% (one 50bp cut)
- Two cuts (9.5%): 20%
- One cut (10.0%): 40%
- Hold (10.5%): 30%
- One hike (11.0%): 8%

**Key Factors Requiring Adjustment:**

1. **January pause was a genuine surprise**: The outside view was calibrated before knowing the Jan 26 decision. The fact that MPC held despite overwhelming market expectations for a cut is NEW information suggesting:
   - MPC is more hawkish than historical pattern
   - 10.5% may already be near terminal rate
   - Governor's "adequately positive" language suggests comfort with current stance
   
   **Impact:** Shift probability mass from "two cuts" and "one cut" toward "hold" and reduce tail probability of hikes.

2. **Core inflation still elevated at 7.4%**: While headline is in-target, core inflation persistence justifies MPC caution. This wasn't fully weighted in outside view.
   
   **Impact:** Reinforces higher probability of hold or single cut vs. aggressive easing.

3. **Meeting calendar uncertainty**: If only one meeting occurs before May 1, the decision tree simplifies. Even with two meetings, consecutive cuts are less likely given the January pause.
   
   **Impact:** Compress distribution around 10.0-10.5% range.

4. **Fiscal/IMF constraints**: While not explicitly detailed in sources, the revenue shortfall (Rs 329bn) and ongoing IMF program likely constrain aggressive easing. This is a structural factor.
   
   **Impact:** Small shift away from aggressive cuts.

**Revised Probability Assessment:**

Given the January surprise hold and MPC's stated comfort with current stance, I adjust:

- **Hold at 10.5%**: 35% → 45% (up 10pp)
  - MPC may wait for more data before resuming cuts
  - Core inflation justifies pause
  - One meeting scenario increases hold probability

- **One cut to 10.0%**: 40% → 35% (down 5pp)
  - Still most likely active scenario
  - March meeting could deliver 50bp cut
  - Aligns with gradual approach

- **Two cuts to 9.5%**: 20% → 12% (down 8pp)
  - Requires two meetings AND two consecutive cuts
  - January pause makes consecutive cuts less likely
  - Still possible if inflation drops sharply

- **One hike to 11.0%**: 8% → 5% (down 3pp)
  - Forex reserves improving reduces crisis risk
  - Inflation in-target
  - Lower tail risk

- **Extreme outcomes (≤9.0% or ≥11.5%)**: 2% → 3% (up 1pp)
  - Slight increase to capture unknown unknowns
  - Could include: rupee crisis (up), deflation surprise (down), political pressure (down)

**Distribution Construction:**

Working backward from probabilities:
- 10.5% (hold): 45%
- 10.0% (one cut): 35%
- 9.5% (two cuts): 12%
- 11.0% (one hike): 5%
- Tails (9.0%, 11.5%, extremes): 3%

Cumulative distribution:
- Below 9.5%: ~2%
- 9.5%: ~14%
- 10.0%: ~49%
- 10.5%: ~94%
- 11.0%: ~99%
- Above 11.0%: ~1%

Mapping to percentiles (using 0.5% increments for granularity):

Probability calibration:

**Percentile 1 (1% below)**: Extreme dovish scenario - multiple aggressive cuts or external shock requiring stimulus. Rate: **8.5%**

**Percentile 5 (5% below)**: Two 50bp cuts occur (9.5%) plus small tail below. Rate: **9.0%**

**Percentile 10 (10% below)**: Primarily captures the 9.5% outcome (two cuts). Rate: **9.5%**

**Percentile 20 (20% below)**: Still in the two-cut scenario, approaching one-cut boundary. Rate: **9.5%**

**Percentile 40 (40% below)**: Solidly in one-cut scenario (10.0%). Rate: **10.0%**

**Percentile 60 (60% below)**: Transition from one-cut to hold. Rate: **10.0%**

**Percentile 80 (80% below)**: Firmly in hold scenario (10.5%). Rate: **10.5%**

**Percentile 90 (90% below)**: Upper end of hold, approaching hike territory. Rate: **10.5%**

**Percentile 95 (95% below)**: One hike scenario (11.0%). Rate: **11.0%**

**Percentile 99 (99% below)**: Extreme hawkish scenario - multiple hikes or inflation shock. Rate: **11.5%**

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: SBP policy rate (%) effective May 1, 2026, per official MPC statements.

2. **Outside view anchor**: Reference class median -50bp over 3 months with current macro setup; adjusted upward given Jan 26 surprise hold.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 10.0-10.5% (between one cut and hold); mean ≈ 10.15%. This aligns with justification that MPC is approaching terminal rate but may deliver one final 50bp cut.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Jan 26 hold despite market expecting cuts (MPC more hawkish than anticipated)
   - Governor stated real rate "adequately positive" (comfort with current stance)
   - Core inflation 7.4% vs headline 5.6% (justifies caution)
   - Forex reserves building to $18bn (external stability supports gradual approach)
   - Historical 50bp increment pattern (if cut occurs, likely 50bp)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: **Rupee crisis or external shock** (e.g., oil price spike, geopolitical event, sudden capital outflows) forces emergency hikes despite current stability. This would push outcome UP to 11.0-12.0%. Probability ~3-5%, partially captured in upper tail.
