Analysis:
We begin by reviewing the ranked sources. Fxempire and Dawn (with corroboration from Dunya News and the Agent Report) show that as of January 26–29, 2026 the SBP’s policy rate was held at 10.5 percent. The Fxempire article (dated January 25, 2026 but describing January 2026 events) emphasizes that despite market expectations for a cut, the central bank maintained its rate at 10.5 percent. Dawn’s detailed report of January 26, 2026 adds that although surveys had anticipated a reduction, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prioritized an unchanged stance given inflation (currently around 5.6 percent and projected to remain within the 5–7 percent range), improving GDP growth, and external stability. The Agent Report, while mostly focused on a comprehensive timeline across 2022–2026, confirms the January 26 decision with a rate of 10.5 percent and reminds us that at least one further policy meeting (scheduled for March 9, 2026) remains before our eventual target date of May 1, 2026.

For these sources, the factual information is clear and consistent regarding the latest value (10.5 percent) and the underlying macroeconomic conditions. Opinions expressed are by known financial news agencies and directly reference official SBP releases or MPC circulars, lending them considerable reliability.

Reference class analysis:
We can view this forecast through several lenses:
• The recent history of SBP policy decisions (with a trend from a higher rate in 2024 to a more accommodative rate in late 2025/early 2026).
• Emerging market central banks that, when inflation is near target and growth is moderate, have tended to hold rates or adjust only modestly over a few months.
• The specific environment in Pakistan where inflation is low and external buffers (forex reserves) are supportive.
Of these, using the recent announcement and the expectation that only small adjustments are likely over the next couple of MPC meetings (with one meeting on March 9 ahead of our May 1 target) is the most appropriate reference class.

Timeframe analysis:
Our horizon is from today, January 29, 2026, until May 1, 2026 – roughly a three‐month period (about 90 days). In previous cycles in similar stable inflation environments the SBP has tended to make only small adjustments (in the order of 25 to 50 basis points, if any) over that interval, unless external or fiscal factors dramatically deteriorate or improve. Given the current stable, even slightly improving outlook—and the clear communication by the SBP that inflation will continue to remain in its target—the opportunity for abrupt moves appears limited.

Justification:
Integrating these points, the external view is built on a reliable, recent consensus that the SBP is deliberately keeping rates at a level supportive for sustainable growth while keeping inflation in check. Although there is the risk of a slight easing if economic conditions continue to improve (or a slight hike if any inflationary pressure unexpectedly builds), the balance of evidence from multiple high‐quality sources suggests that any move away from 10.5 percent by May 1, 2026 is likely to be modest. We therefore anchor our prediction to a median value very near 10.5 percent, while allowing for approximately ±0.5 percentage point uncertainty over our short horizon due to usual policy variability and unexpected shocks.

Outside view calibration:
In formulating our distribution we consider that:
• The current consensus value is 10.5 percent.
• Historical behavior of the SBP in similar circumstances has shown only minor adjustments within a three‐month horizon.
• There remains a roughly 10–15 percent chance that an unforeseen external or domestic shock could lead to a 25–50 basis point move away from 10.5 percent.
• Our distribution is set wide enough (approximately ±0.5 percentage points) to capture these “unknown unknowns” while still being centered on the prevailing stance.
