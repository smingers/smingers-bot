Analysis:
We are asked to forecast the SBP target policy rate (in percent) in effect as of 11:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2026. Multiple high‐quality sources (Dawn, The Express Tribune, Brecorder) confirm that as of January 26, 2026 the SBP’s policy rate stands at 10.5%. Recent historical context shows that Pakistan’s easing cycle—from a crisis peak around 22% in mid‐2023—has reflected steady downward moves. Although the market expected a 50–100‐bps cut in January, the MPC surprised everyone by holding at 10.5%. With roughly 90 days (January 29 to May 1, 2026) remaining and two additional MPC meetings (one in early March and one in late April) likely, our forecasting must balance several factors.

(a) Source Analysis:
• Dawn, Express Tribune, and Brecorder (all dated January 26, 2026) report the current policy rate at 10.5%. These are high‐quality, fact‐based news sources and provide the recent official decision with expert commentary.
• Market surveys (e.g., Arif Habib Limited) indicated expectations for a rate cut (in the order of 50bps–75bps), but the decision’s holding suggests SBP is exercising caution.
• Historical reference classes from 2023–2026 show an easing trend from peaks very much in excess of current levels, yet the pace is moderate now due to improving inflation (headline about 5.6% but core near 7.4%), and the SBP’s declared concern for price stability.
• Opinions from industry experts (e.g., FPCCI figures) are less influential than the official stance but indicate diverse market pressure.
Overall, the factual information – the current rate, recent trends, and underlying economic indicators (inflation in the 5–7% range, improving GDP growth, rising reserves) – dominate the picture.

(b) Evidence Analysis:
• Strong evidence: The official announcements (Dawn, Tribune) of a 10.5% rate and the MPC’s verbal justification for pausing further cuts. Historical easing cycles support a gradual reduction.
• Moderate evidence: Market surveys and analyst expectations that, even though not realized in January, suggest that given the persistently lower inflation, one or two 50bps cuts may occur in the next two meetings.
• Weak evidence: Some anecdotal industry calls for larger cuts. However, the risk management mindset already displayed (holding rates despite market pressure) suggests SBP will be careful.
Thus, our central view incorporates a moderate 50bps cut in one meeting (bringing the rate to 10.0%) with a reasonable chance of no further reduction or possibly a second modest cut (to 9.5%). There is also a small probability for a mild rate hike if inflation pressures or external risks worsen.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
The prediction horizon is 93 days (from January 29 to May 1, 2026). With two MPC meetings likely before resolution, the outcome depends on evolving inflation, growth updates, and external pressures. If the timeframe were halved, we would expect little change beyond the current 10.5% hold; if doubled, there might be more cuts as economic conditions evolve. Here, with two meetings over 3 months, our uncertainty remains moderate—reflected in a 90/10 interval spanning about 2 percentage points.

(d) Justification:
The most compelling factors are:
1. The current official hold at 10.5% with explicit justification to support price stability (strong evidence).
2. Headline inflation is around 5.6%, but core inflation is still above target, so aggressive easing is constrained.
3. Historical easing from crisis levels suggests gradual rate reduction, yet the SBP’s caution (as seen in January 2026) implies further cuts will be modest.
4. The regulatory/IMF framework and current fiscal challenges (e.g., current account deficit, revenue shortfall) impose limits on how low rates can go.
Altogether, our outside view base rate from recent history is around 10.5%, with an expectation of one modest 50bps reduction leading to around 10.0% (or possibly a second cut to 9.5%) in the next two meetings. Tail risks include a small chance of a rate hike (if inflation surprises upward) or aggressive easing if growth significantly weakens.

Probability calibration
Given two potential MPC meetings:
• Scenario 1 – No change at both meetings: Final rate remains at 10.5% (≈25% chance).
• Scenario 2 – One 50bps cut (likely in March) and hold in April: Final rate 10.0% (≈35% chance).
• Scenario 3 – Two consecutive 50bps cuts: Final rate 9.5% (≈20% chance).
• Scenario 4 – A more dovish environment prompts an extra 25bps cut (or 75bps total): Final rate around 9.0% (≈10% chance).
• Scenario 5 – Unexpected inflationary pressures force a slight rate increase: Around 10.75–11.0% (≈5% chance).
• Other tail scenarios (either aggressive cuts below 9.0% or hikes above 11.0%) are assigned minor probabilities.
One’s median view is approximately 10.0%–10.0% (the weight of one cut versus hold).

Checklist:
1. Target: SBP policy rate at May 1, 2026 in percent.
2. Base rate: Current official rate of 10.5% with historical easing trajectory.
3. Consistency check: Implied median ≈10.0%; mean ≈10.0%–10.25% – consistent with cautious gradual easing.
4. Top evidence:
 – Official hold at 10.5% (strong).
 – Market expectations for modest cut(s) (moderate).
 – Core inflation above target limiting aggressive cuts (strong).
5. Blind-spot: A sudden inflation spike (e.g., due to external shocks) could force an increase toward 11%+.
