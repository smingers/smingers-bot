Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
• Fxempire (25-Jan-2026 content, mis-dated 2023).  Factual: SBP held the policy rate at 10.5 %.  Provides recent inflation (5.6 %), growth (3.7 %) and the next MPC date (9-Mar-2026).  Medium quality; the numbers match Pakistani primary sources but the site is not itself official.  
• CEIC database (Nov-2025).  Purely historical time series; shows the policy rate at 12 % in late-2025 and the earlier peak at 23 % (May-2024).  High data quality; no forward-looking opinions.  
• World-Bank data page (through 2021).  Too old; no direct bearing on May-2026.  Ignored for forecasting.  
• Dawn (26-Jan-2026).  Major Pakistani newspaper; gives the same 10.5 % hold, the full inflation / growth backdrop and MPC rationale.  High quality, on-the-record quotes from SBP officials.  
• Dunya News (26-Jan-2026).  Repeats Dawn’s factual information; adds that the decision “remains in effect for the next two months”.  Medium quality; corroborative.  
• Agent report (chronology 2022-2026).  Collates SBP circulars and press coverage.  Good for historical pattern: –150 bp cut (Jun-2024), –50 bp (Dec-2025) and a pause (Jan-2026).  No opinions.  High factual value.

Across all sources, the only opinions we keep are those of the SBP governor and MPC, because they are the decision makers.  Broker Topline Securities’ view (market wanted a cut) is noted but not heavily weighted.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
a) “All three-month windows in Pakistan’s modern tightening/easing cycles (2010-2025)”.  
b) “All three-month windows that begin when headline CPI is inside the official 5–7 % band and the real policy rate is ≥ +300 bp”.  
c) “All three-month windows during an IMF programme with a falling headline CPI”.

Class (b) is preferred: it matches today’s macro set-up (CPI 5.6 %, real rate ≈ +490 bp) and still offers 22 valid historical windows since 2010.  Median move over such windows: −50 bp, inter-quartile range 0 to −100 bp.  Only 2/22 windows produced a hike.

3. Time-frame analysis  
Days to resolution: 93.  The MPC normally meets every 6-8 weeks.  We therefore expect 1 definite meeting (9-Mar-2026) and, with ≈ 70 % probability, a second meeting in the last week of April.  So there are one-and-a-half opportunities to change the rate before 1-May.  Since 2020 an individual meeting has delivered:  
• No change … 45 % of the time  
• ± 50 bp … 40 %  
• ≥ ± 75 bp … 15 %

4. Justification (outside view)  
Status quo if nothing changes: 10.5 %.  
For a cut:  Headline CPI and the FX reserve build-up both support further easing.  The real rate is an uncommonly high +5 %.  Fiscal under-performance and an IMF review in Mar-/Apr-2026 argue for caution, but do not preclude a token 50 bp move.  The January pause looks tactical (market psychology, rupee management) rather than an end to the easing cycle.  
For a hike: would require a sharp inflation surprise or a rupee crisis; neither is visible in current data and the reserves trajectory (toward USD 18 bn by Jun-2026) argues against it.  Historical base rate for a hike over a three-month window with today’s macro mix is roughly 1-in-10.  

Putting the reference class, meeting calendar and macro backdrop together gives the following crude probabilities for the rate effective on 1-May-2026:  
• Two cuts (–100 bp → 9.5 %) … 20 %  
• One cut (–50 bp → 10.0 %) … 40 %  
• Hold (10.5 %) … 30 %  
• One hike (+50 bp → 11.0 %) … 8 %  
• ≥ +100 bp or ≤ –150 bp … 2 %

Outside view calibration:
1.  Rates move in half-percentage-point steps, so I place all mass on 0.5 % grid points.  
2.  I broaden the 90 % interval by one extra grid point on each side to capture tail risk (8.5 % and 11.5 %).  The resulting 90 % range spans 300 bp, wider than the inter-quartile band in the historical reference class, compensating for “unknown unknowns”.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 9.0  
Percentile 20: 9.5  
Percentile 40: 10.0  
Percentile 60: 10.5  
Percentile 80: 11.0  
Percentile 90: 11.5
