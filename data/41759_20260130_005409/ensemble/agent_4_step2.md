Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

a) Dawn, Express Tribune, Brecorder – 26 Jan 2026  
   • Factual: SBP kept the policy rate at 10.5 percent; last move was a 50 bp cut on 15 Dec 2025.  
   • Quality: High – all quote the official Monetary Policy Statement and governor’s press briefing.  
   • Opinions: Market surveys expected a cut; industry groups want bigger cuts.

b) AskNews scrape – no Pakistan-specific material; kept only to verify the global backdrop (Fed on hold, RBI cautious, etc.).  Quality low-to-neutral for this question because it is indirect.

c) No contradictory reports were found after 26 Jan 2026.  SBP publishes every 6–8 weeks; next meetings should fall around 9 Mar 2026 and late-Apr 2026.

Conclusion: only one firmly dated, official level data point (10.5 percent); other “sources” are noise for this forecast.

2. Evidence analysis (strength rating)

Strong  
• Official SBP statement: current rate 10.5 percent; inflation 5–7 percent target, “real policy rate adequately positive”.

Moderate  
• Historical pattern: when inflation is within target, SBP typically changes rate by 25–50 bp per meeting at most, and very rarely more than 100 bp over three months.  
• Market/industry pressure for cuts: surveys before the Jan meeting showed 80 percent expected at least a 50 bp cut.

Weak  
• Global central-bank easing bias (Fed, RBI, NBP) – relevant but only loosely connected to SBP decisions.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution: 29 Jan → 01 May 2026 ≈ 93 days; two MPC decisions.  Halving the horizon (to mid-Mar) would greatly raise the probability of “no change” because only one meeting would be left; doubling (to Aug 2026) would materially widen the lower tail (< 9.5 percent) as more easing becomes plausible.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside view base rate = status quo 10.5 percent with ±25 bp volatility per meeting.  
Key inside-view factors shifting probability toward mild easing:  
• Inflation currently at 5.6 percent (centre of target band) and expected to stay benign.  
• Private-sector, industry and analyst pressure for single-digit rates.  
• SBP already began an easing cycle (50 bp cut in Dec 2025).  
Offsetting factors (keeping cuts limited):  
• Governor’s warning that inflation could tick above 7 percent “for some months”.  
• Comfortable but not abundant FX reserves; SBP historically cautious when reserves < 3-month import cover.  

Net effect: median rate slips 20–30 bp below today’s 10.5 percent, but probability of no move still the single largest bucket.  Small right-tail weight (rate hike) is kept for a commodity-price shock or rupee wobble.

Probability calibration  
Total mass allocated:  
• 9.5 percent 3 %  
• 9.75 percent 7 %  
• 10.0 percent 17 %  
• 10.25 percent 25 %  
• 10.5 percent 35 %  
• 10.75 percent 8 %  
• 11.0 percent 5 %

Checklist:
1. Target variable: SBP policy rate (%) at 23:59 UTC, 1 May 2026.  
2. Base rate: 10.5 percent (current).  
3. Consistency: median ≈ 10.3 %; mean ≈ 10.35 %; aligns with “slight-easing” narrative.  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Official MPS 26 Jan 2026 (10.5 %).  
   • Inflation 5.6 %, inside 5–7 % band.  
   • December 50 bp cut signals easing bias.  
   • Market survey showed desire for cuts (missed in Jan).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rupee crisis forcing an emergency hike (> 200 bp) – would drive rate well above my 99th percentile (upside risk).
