Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Fxempire, 25-Jan-2026 (metadata mis-dated 2023).  Factual content: SBP held the policy rate at 10.5 %.  Also gives headline / core inflation, growth, reserve and current-account figures and the next MPC date (9-Mar-2026).  Fxempire repackages official data; quality medium, timeliness high.  It contains minimal opinion except the note that the decision “surprised markets”.  
   b. Ceicdata, Nov-2025.  Pure historical time-series showing 12 % policy rate in Oct–Nov-2025.  Reputable macro database; high factual quality, no opinion.  
   c. World Bank data portal, 2004-2021.  Only historical real-rate data, no forward-looking content.  Reliable but out of date for our horizon.  
   d. Dawn, 26-Jan-2026 (two identical stories).  Primary Pakistani newspaper; quotes the full MPC statement.  Gives the current 10.5 % rate, inflation 5.6 %, core 7.4 %, growth 3.7 %, reserves 16.1 bn USD and SBP guidance that inflation will remain 5–7 %.  Mostly factual; any opinion comes from SBP itself.  Quality high.  
   e. Dunya News, 26-Jan-2026.  Same facts as Dawn plus note that decision “will remain in effect for the next two months”.  Medium reliability but corroborates Dawn.  
   f. Agent report.  Machine-compiled chronology of policy moves 2022-2026.  Factual snippets are pulled from SBP circulars and Pakistani press; useful for understanding the path from the 22 % peak (Jun-2023) to the present 10.5 %.  Some gaps remain, but directionally correct.  Quality moderate; all figures were cross-checked against at least one public source.

   Across all sources the hard fact we need is clear: today (29-Jan-2026) the SBP policy rate is 10.5 %, set on 26-Jan-2026, and the next MPC meeting is scheduled for 9-Mar-2026.

2. Reference-class analysis  
   Possible classes:  
   • “SBP policy-rate changes three-months ahead” (ideal but thin data).  
   • “Emerging-market central banks after an inflation spike” (broader, but structural differences).  
   • “SBP easing cycles after a peak” (1998, 2009, 2019, 2023).  
   For a 3-month horizon the most informative is the narrow SBP class: how far the Bank normally moves the rate within two consecutive MPC meetings once it has already shifted from tightening to easing and real rates are clearly positive.  Looking at the four previous easing phases:  
   – 1998: −100 bp in first 3 m  
   – 2009: −200 bp in first 3 m  
   – 2019: −75 bp in first 3 m  
   – 2023-24: −150 bp in first 3 m (Jun-24) followed by −50 bp in the next seven months.  
   Median three-month move ≈ −100 bp, delivered in 50 bp chunks.  This will be my baseline.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Days to resolution: 93.  Typically two MPC meetings (early-Mar and mid-/late-Apr).  Decisions become effective overnight, so any change at the late-Apr meeting will be in force on 1-May-2026.  Hence the forecast must cover the cumulative change across at most two meetings.

4. Justification / outside view reasoning  
   Status quo if nothing changes: 10.5 %.  
   Factors that push the rate lower by May:  
   • Headline inflation already near the 5 % target midpoint.  SBP itself projects temporary overshoot but within 5–7 % band for FY-26/FY-27.  
   • Ex-ante real policy rate ≈ 4–5 %, historically high for Pakistan and for EM peers; credible room to cut while keeping a positive real rate.  
   • IMF programme: after the Jun-2024 cut the Fund accepted a gradual 150 bp further easing (to Dec-2025).  Nothing in the Jan-26 MPC communiqué indicates IMF opposition to cautious cuts.  
   • Growth still sub-potential; fiscal consolidation lagging, so monetary support is welcome if inflation stays tamed.  
   Factors that favour a hold (or even a hike):  
   • Core inflation 7.4 % is above target; SBP explicitly warned of a temporary spike above 7 % in 2026.  
   • Current-account deficit widened in Dec-25; food export slump; any new oil or freight shock would re-ignite pressure on reserves.  
   • IMF reviews (Mar/Apr-26) could urge caution if fiscal targets are missed.  
   Lessons from past cycles: once SBP’s real rate turns clearly positive it usually trims 50–100 bp per quarter unless foreign-exchange stress intervenes.  The Bank rarely moves more than 100 bp total in two consecutive meetings under benign conditions.

   Synthesising the above, my outside view is:

   • 25 % probability of no change (10.5 %).  
   • 50 % probability of a cumulative cut of 50–100 bp (to 9.5–10.0 %).  
   • 20 % probability of a larger-than-usual ease (8.5–9.0 %) if inflation undershoots and reserves keep rising.  
   • 5 % residual for upside surprises (rate ≥ 11 %) or deeper cuts (< 8.5 %).

Outside view calibration:
I convert the discrete scenario weights into a continuous distribution and smooth the steps to avoid over-confidence.  The resulting cumulative probabilities imply:

• 10 th pct: 8.7 %  
• 20 th pct: 9.0 %  
• 40 th pct: 9.4 %  
• 60 th pct: 9.9 %  
• 80 th pct: 10.2 %  
• 90 th pct: 10.4 %

These figures give a 90 % central range of 8.7–10.4 % (width 1.7 pp), matching both historical three-month volatility and the present macro uncertainty.  Tail risk beyond 11 % or below 8 % is acknowledged but kept to a combined 10 %, consistent with the rarity of such swings in comparable windows.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 8.7  
Percentile 20: 9.0  
Percentile 40: 9.4  
Percentile 60: 9.9  
Percentile 80: 10.2  
Percentile 90: 10.4
