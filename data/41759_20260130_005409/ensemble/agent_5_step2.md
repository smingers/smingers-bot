Analysis
1. Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion)  
• Dawn / Express-Tribune / Business Recorder, 26 Jan 2026 – identical MPC-day reporting; high-credibility national dailies directly quoting the SBP statement.  Hard facts: policy rate 10.5 percent, headline CPI 5.6 percent, core 7.4 percent, reserves 16.1 billion USD, growth 3.7 percent.  Opinions limited to SBP officials and industry groups.  
• Tribune & Dawn market-expectations polls – factual: majority of analysts expected a cut.  Opinion: businessmen call for larger cuts (clearly labelled).  
• FxEmpire, CEIC – historical time-series only; useful for trend cross-check.  
• Asknews bundle – entirely about the Fed, Poland, India or Germany; no direct bearing on Pakistani policy.  Ignored for rate projection but confirms global easing bias.  

2. Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• SBP has already shifted to an easing stance (150 bp cuts since Jun 2025).  
• Ex-ante real policy rate ≈ 4–5 percent – far above Pakistan’s long-run neutral (~2 percent).  
Moderate evidence  
• SBP forward guidance: inflation to stay inside 5–7 percent band; “real rate adequately positive”.  
• Reserves improving (projected 18 billion USD by Jun 2026) reduces FX-stability constraint.  
• Consensus mis-timed January decision – shows MPC caution; implies preference for staggered, not aggressive, easing.  
Weak evidence  
• Domestic lobbies clamouring for large (>300 bp) cuts – politically noisy, historically low predictive value.  
• Global central banks discussing cuts – only indirectly relevant to SBP.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 93.  Two MPC meetings are scheduled (early-Mar, mid-/late-Apr).  If horizon were halved (≈45 d, one meeting) I would expect only 0–50 bp easing; if doubled (≈180 d, four meetings) median would fall toward 9.0 percent with fatter lower tail.

4. Outside-view baseline  
Reference class: SBP easing cycles once real rate turns clearly positive (1998, 2009, 2019, 2023).  Median three-month move: −100 bp delivered in 50-bp steps.  Baseline therefore 9.5–10.0 percent by 1 May 2026.

5. Inside-view adjustments  
Upward pressures: core CPI still 7 percent+, possible current-account wobble, IMF review March.  Downward pressures: headline CPI already near 5 percent, reserves rising, positive real rate, global easing narrative.  Net effect: trim baseline probability of full −100 bp to 35 percent, raise weight on smaller −50 bp or zero move.

Probability calibration
Scenario weights  
• No change (10.5 percent) – 30 percent  
• Minus 50 bp (10.0 percent) – 35 percent  
• Minus 100 bp (9.5 percent) – 25 percent  
• Deeper cut (8.5–9.0 percent) – 7 percent  
• Rate ≥11 percent (tightening shock) – 3 percent  

Converted to continuous percentiles (linear interpolation inside bins, long tails outside) yields:

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 8.2
Percentile 5: 8.7
Percentile 10: 8.9
Percentile 20: 9.3
Percentile 40: 9.6
Percentile 60: 9.9
Percentile 80: 10.3
Percentile 90: 10.6
Percentile 95: 11.1
Percentile 99: 12.0

Checklist  
1. Target variable: SBP policy rate, percent, in force 1 May 2026 23:59 UTC.  
2. Outside-view base: median −75 bp in three months ⇒ 9.75 percent.  
3. Consistency: implied median 9.75 %, mean 9.86 % – matches narrative of modest easing.  
4. Key evidence: a) current rate 10.5 %, b) CPI 5.6 %, c) SBP guidance real rate “adequately positive”, d) historical -100 bp three-month median, e) reserves uptrend.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rupee sell-off forcing emergency hike – would push outcome above 11 percent.
