# Summary of Article: Pakistan Policy Rate

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Current Policy Rate:**
- Pakistan's policy rate (State Bank of Pakistan: Reverse Repo Rate) was **12.00% per annum in November 2025**
- This remained unchanged from October 2025 (also 12.00% pa)

**Historical Range:**
- **Minimum rate:** 6.25% (December 2017)
- **Maximum rate:** 23.00% (May 2024)
- Data frequency: Monthly, covering February 1992 to November 2025

**Data Source:**
- Content source: Ceicdata
- Resolution based on State Bank of Pakistan reverse repo rate

## Context:

The article provides comparative policy rates across numerous countries as of late 2025, showing Pakistan's 12.00% rate in the context of global monetary policy. The data shows Pakistan experienced significant rate volatility, with rates reaching as high as 23% in May 2024 before declining to the current 12% level.

The article also includes various other Pakistani economic indicators (government finance, trade balance, etc.) but these are supplementary to the main policy rate data.

**Note:** This article provides historical data through November 2025 but does not contain forecasts, opinions, or projections about what the policy rate will be as of May 1, 2026.

# Summary of Article: SBP Policy Rate Decision (January 26, 2026)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Policy Rate Decision:**
- The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its key policy rate at **10.5%** on January 26, 2026
- This decision surprised market expectations, as a majority of participants surveyed by Topline Securities expected a rate cut

**Inflation Metrics:**
- Headline inflation: **5.6%** in December 2025
- Core inflation: **7.4%** (described as "steadied around a higher level")
- Medium-term inflation target range: **5-7%**

**Current Account and Trade:**
- Current account deficit: **$244 million** in December 2025
- First half FY 2026 cumulative deficit: **$1.2 billion**
- Weak exports driven by sharp drop in food exports (particularly rice)
- High-value-added (HVA) textile exports remained resilient
- Workers' remittances and ICT services showed sustained growth

**Economic Growth:**
- Real GDP growth: **3.7%** year-on-year for Q1 FY 2026 (provisional)
- Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) growth: **8%** (October 2025) and **10.4%** (November 2025) year-on-year
- LSM growth for July-November FY 2026: **6%**
- **Revised GDP growth projection for FY 2026: 3.75-4.75%** (improved from earlier estimates)
- Expected further strengthening in FY 2027

**Foreign Exchange Reserves:**
- SBP forex reserves: **$16.1 billion** as of January 16, 2026 (surpassed end-December target)
- Expected to surpass **$18 billion by June 2026**
- Projected to rise further in FY 2027, nearing the 3-month import cover benchmark

**Fiscal Metrics:**
- Federal Board of Revenue tax revenues grew by only **9.5%** (well below last year's 26% pace and annual target)
- Revenue shortfall: **Rs 329 billion**
- Broad money growth: **16.3%** by early January 2026
- Private sector credit expansion: **Rs 578 billion** during FY 2026 (till January 9)

**Current Account Projections:**
- Expected to be contained in the range of **0-1% of GDP** in FY 2026

## Key Rationale from MPC:

The Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold the policy rate unchanged based on:
1. Inflation and current account being "broadly unchanged"
2. Improved outlook for economic growth
3. Need to ensure price stability and sustainable economic growth
4. Maintaining real policy rate to stabilize inflation within target range

## Risks Noted:
- Global trade fragmentation and geopolitical uncertainty
- Achieving annual primary surplus target remains challenging
- Need for sustained fiscal consolidation and discipline
- Elevated global tariff uncertainty and volatile commodity prices (per IMF)

## Context:
- This follows a previous MPC meeting where the rate was reduced by 50 basis points to 10.5%
- The decision emphasizes coordinated monetary and fiscal policy, along with structural reforms

3. Business Recorder “SBP holds policy rate at 10.5 %” and Dawn “SBP maintains policy rate at 10.5 pc” (both 26-Jan-2026).  

Status: only 6 of the 33 MPC meetings in 2022-26 have numeric rate data; 27 meetings still require extraction of “before/after/Δ” from the individual Monetary Policy Statements or the companion DMMD circulars.

B) CPI inflation (headline YoY, national, base 2016-17)  

No month-end CPI percentages for Jan-2022 through Jan-2026 were recovered in the current crawl.  The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics publishes the required figure each month in its CPI press release and the accompanying “Annexure-1” Excel file, but none of those files were captured.  Hence the entire 49-observation time-series is still missing.

Status: IMF timeline is now complete for all actions actually confirmed by the Fund through Dec-2025.  Two key gaps remain:  
• the Executive Board date (and any disbursement amount) for the 2nd SBA review, due before programme expiry in Apr-2024;  
• the 2026 EFF/RSF Board reviews (the programme runs until Sep-2027, so at least two reviews fall in calendar-2026).

Summary of remaining information gaps  

1. Monetary policy column: numeric rate data for 27 meetings (Jan-2022 → Oct-2025) are absent.  Each corresponding MPS PDF or DMMD circular must be scraped.  
2. CPI column: all 49 monthly YoY inflation prints for Jan-2022 → Jan-2026 are missing.  They reside in PBS “Annexure-1” Excel files or HTML tables.  
3. IMF column: missing Board approval date for the final SBA review (expected Apr-2024) and all Board reviews falling in 2026 under the EFF/RSF.

Until those three blocks are filled, the user-requested “timeline with exact dates and percentages” cannot be produced in final form.

Recommended next data-collection steps (in order of impact)

A. Download every Monetary Policy Statement PDF (sbp.org.pk/m_policy/mon.asp) and/or the parallel DMMD circulars for 2022-25; extract “policy rate before, after, Δ”.  
B. Retrieve PBS CPI press releases or Annexure-1 spreadsheets for each month; record the “National CPI (2016-17 base) YoY %”.  
C. Monitor IMF.org press releases for Pakistan after 1-Apr-2024 to capture: (i) Board completion of SBA 2nd review; (ii) 2026 EFF/RSF reviews.

Once those datasets are populated, the full, gap-free timeline for 2022-2026 can be assembled exactly as the user requested.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.
- Always start with a smaller number (more negative if negative) and then increase from there
