Analysis:
The key to forecasting the SBP policy rate on 1 May 2026 is understanding (a) SBP’s reaction function to inflation, external-sector stress and IMF conditionality, and (b) how frequently and by how much it tends to change the rate.  Useful historical context therefore includes:  
• The full sequence of policy-rate announcements from 2018-2025, especially the 2023 hike to 22 % that remained in place through most of 2024, the gradual easing that started once headline CPI moved back into the 15-10 % range, and any changes during 2025.  
• Correlations between year-on-year CPI, the current-account balance, the PKR/USD level and each Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision.  
• Timing of IMF reviews (e.g., the 2023 SBA and the 2024–27 EFF) and the prior-actions they imposed on SBP.  
• Typical spacing of MPC meetings (roughly every six weeks, with unscheduled meetings in crises).  
By compiling these data points we can build an outside-view distribution: SBP rarely moves rates by less than 100 bp and often keeps them unchanged for several meetings once a tightening cycle peaks; historically, end-of-tightening cuts begin 6-12 months after headline inflation falls decisively below the policy rate.  Knowing where inflation and the rupee stand as of early 2026, relative to the last MPC meeting before 1 May, will anchor a probabilistic forecast for that date.
