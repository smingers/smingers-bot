The Fed's post-meeting statement cited solid economic growth, stable unemployment, and persistently elevated inflation. Chair Jerome Powell noted 'clear improvement in the outlook for growth' and observed that inflation performed 'about as expected,' with labor market data suggesting stabilization. Despite this, Wall Street economists remain optimistic about multiple rate cuts this year. David Mericle of Goldman Sachs forecasts a 25 basis point cut in June and another in September, citing core PCE inflation remaining near 3% through mid-year. Andrew Hollenhorst of Citigroup expects 75 basis points in cuts\u201425bp each in March, July, and September\u2014based on a low threshold for action if unemployment rises or inflation slows sustainably. Marc Giannoni of Barclays maintains a forecast of two 25bp cuts, contingent on inflation moderating.

First Cut Expected in February**\nThe Polish Monetary Policy Council (RPP) has not cut interest rates in January 2026, but analysts predict the first reduction could occur as early as February. Pekao analysts forecast three rate cuts in 2026, bringing the rate down to 3.25%, with the first cut expected at the February 3\u20134 meeting. They argue that while inflation is expected to fall faster than consensus, the window for cuts is narrow, as disinflationary effects from rate hikes will be offset by inflationary impacts from future rate cuts by mid-year. Pekao projects 2026 annual inflation at 1.9%, driven by low food prices, strong energy price control, continued service sector disinflation, and cheap goods from China. However, they anticipate inflation will stabilize around 2.2% by year-end, with a slight rise in 2027 due to base effects and normalization of food and fuel prices. Alior Bank also expects rates to reach 3.25% in 2026, while ING predicts the first cut in March, citing a shift in rhetoric from NBP President Adam Glapi\u0144ski, who stated inflation reduction is 'sustainable'. mBank analysts consider March more likely due to strong inflation projections and signals from the President, though some RPP members remain open to a February move. PKO BP, however, expects rates to end the year at 3.50%, arguing that inflationary upside surprises are diminishing due to already low inflation, increasing the likelihood the cycle ends at 3.5%.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 10:55 PM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,151003,32562983,prognozuja-obnizki-stop-procentowych-kiedy-pierwsze-ciecie.html)\n\n**Labor Market Stability Keeps Fed on Hold: Market Predicts No Rate Cuts**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting on January 28, 2026, with market consensus nearly unanimous in expecting no interest rate cuts. With inflation declining only marginally and employment remaining stable, the Fed has reached a consensus to pause its rate-cutting cycle. The likelihood of no rate cut was projected at 97.2% by CME FedWatch, and economist Nick Timiraos predicted the benchmark rate would remain unchanged, with only minor adjustments to the policy statement. A key indicator will be whether the Fed retains the phrase 'further adjustments'\u2014a sign of potential long-term pause. Future rate cuts will depend on which of two risks\u2014labor market deterioration or persistent inflation\u2014materializes first. Unemployment is stabilizing, while inflation remains at 2.8%, above the 2% target, preventing consensus. Some officials argue to ignore one-time effects like tariffs, believing underlying inflation is near target, while others emphasize official data, seeing continued price pressures. Despite White House pressure to accelerate cuts, most Fed officials favor waiting for more compelling evidence. Timiraos noted that a clear deterioration in the labor market would be necessary to justify rate cuts before mid-year. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026, making the successor race a new focal point. Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock, has surged as the top contender, with market odds approaching 50%, surpassing former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Chair Kevin Hassett. Rieder\u2019s rise is attributed to Trump\u2019s public praise and positive internal White House assessments. However, Wall Street remains cautious, as Trump\u2019s emphasis on loyalty may hinder Rieder\u2019s candidacy. If appointed, Rieder would be one of the few Fed chairs without a PhD, relying instead on market experience.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:10 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20260129000902-260301)\n\n**Berlin Cuts Growth Forecast for 2026 Amid Slow Recovery from Fiscal Stimulus**\nThe German government revised its 2026 economic growth forecast downward to 1%, down from 1.3% projected in autumn 2025, citing that expected economic impulses from last year's large-scale fiscal stimulus package did not materialize as quickly or as strongly as anticipated. According to Economy Minister Katherina Reiche, the 'budgetary bazooka'\u2014a multi-hundred-billion-euro plan to modernize defense and infrastructure\u2014was expected to drive recovery in 2026 after a 0.2% growth in 2025 and two consecutive recession years. The plan is projected to account for about two-thirds of 2026's growth, driven by private and public consumption. However, the revision is not surprising, according to economist Felix Schmidt of Berenberg, who cited a sluggish start to the year, supported by the Ifo Institute's January business climate index. Schmidt emphasized that accompanying reforms are necessary to prevent the increased state spending from becoming a costly short-term boom. Reiche defended the government\u2019s support for businesses and households but highlighted the persistently difficult global economic environment, particularly due to rising U.S. tariffs affecting Germany\u2019s export model. Exports to the U.S., Germany\u2019s former top trading partner, fell 9.4% between January and November 2025 compared to 2024. Reiche also noted 'a clear recovery' in the industrial sector, with growth in production and equipment orders. For 2027, the government revised its forecast from 1.4% to 1.3% of GDP.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 02:26 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94AX8CQ)\n\n**Budget 2026 Countdown: Economic Survey to be tabled in Parliament on January 29, Key growth and inflation signals to watch**\nIndia's Economic Survey 2026 will be presented in Parliament on January 29, 2026, ahead of the Union Budget 2026, which will be delivered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2026. The survey, prepared annually by the Department of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, provides a comprehensive analysis of the Indian economy's performance in the previous financial year, including macroeconomic indicators such as real GDP growth, inflation, tax revenues, and export performance. Markets are closely monitoring the survey for potential upward revisions to GDP growth forecasts for FY26, which could signal strong economic momentum. Inflation trends, influenced by volatile commodity prices and domestic demand, are expected to inform the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy outlook. Sector-wise, the survey will highlight performance in agriculture, banking, manufacturing, and services\u2014key indicators that may foreshadow upcoming budgetary measures such as continued or expanded Minimum Support Price (MSP) payouts, credit-offtake policies, and job creation goals. Export performance, particularly in sectors like textiles and engineering goods, is expected to benefit from anticipated progress on the India-EU Free Trade Agreement. The survey will also assess rupee stability, the trade deficit, and potential tax incentives to be continued or expanded in the upcoming budget.

The Fed's post-meeting statement cited solid economic growth, stable unemployment, and persistently elevated inflation. Chair Jerome Powell noted 'clear improvement in the outlook for growth' and observed that inflation performed 'about as expected,' with labor market data suggesting stabilization. Despite this, Wall Street economists remain optimistic about multiple rate cuts this year. David Mericle of Goldman Sachs forecasts a 25 basis point cut in June and another in September, citing core PCE inflation remaining near 3% through mid-year. Andrew Hollenhorst of Citigroup expects 75 basis points in cuts\u201425bp each in March, July, and September\u2014based on a low threshold for action if unemployment rises or inflation slows sustainably. Marc Giannoni of Barclays maintains a forecast of two 25bp cuts, contingent on inflation moderating.

The survey includes projected GDP growth estimates for the current fiscal year (FY26) and the upcoming fiscal year (FY27), summarizing the nation's economic development and short- and medium-term outlook. Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran will later explain key policy reforms, including issues such as rupee depreciation and geopolitical volatility. Sitharaman, who will present the 15th Union Budget of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government on February 1, 2026, made history as the first woman to present the Union Budget for nine consecutive years. Prime Minister Modi described this milestone as a 'proud moment' in India's parliamentary history. The Budget Session, lasting 65 days across 30 sittings, began on January 28 and will be held in two phases: the first phase runs until February 13, and the second phase is scheduled from March 9 to April 2. The session will adjourn on February 13 to allow parliamentary committees to examine ministry-wise Demands for Grants. This will be the second full budget since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a third consecutive term in 2024. Over the past decade, India has strengthened its foundation across major sectors, establishing a robust base for future growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:52 AM\nSource:[Zee News](https://zeenews.india.com/economy/fm-sitharaman-tables-economic-survey-2026-in-parliament-3011573.html)\n\n**Budget 2026 expectations LIVE Updates: Economic Survey presentation today, just days ahead of Budget speech | Mint**\nThe Economic Survey 2025-26 is set to be presented in Parliament on 29 January 2026, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivering the Union Budget 2026 speech on 1 February 2026, marking the first time in over a decade that the Budget will be presented on a Sunday.

Other areas such as healthcare, tourism, agriculture, and logistics are also likely to see allocations. In Budget 2025, Sitharaman introduced a tax cut for income up to \u20b912 lakh, increased the non-taxable income under the new tax regime to \u20b912.75 lakh for salaried individuals, and announced the New Income Tax Act, 2025, effective from 1 April 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:46 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/budget/expectations/budget-2026-expectations-live-updates-income-tax-changes-latest-news-29-january-india-economic-survey-sitharaman-pm-modi-11769654178199.html)\n\n**India's Economy Forecast Out Soon, Will Sitharaman Meet Income Tax Expectations In Budget? | LIVE**\nThe Economic Survey 2025-26 was tabled in Parliament on January 29, 2026, at 11:00 AM by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, followed by a press briefing by Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran. The Survey, traditionally released the day before the Union Budget 2026-27, provides a comprehensive assessment of India\u2019s economic performance for the financial year April 2025\u2013March 2026, analyzing growth trends, inflation dynamics, public finances, external risks, and sectoral developments. It sets the macroeconomic foundation for the upcoming Budget, signaling the government\u2019s policy direction amid global uncertainty and domestic opportunities. Industry leaders are closely watching for income tax relief, infrastructure push, support for MSMEs, affordable housing, and incentives for sectors like artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure, clean technology, and real estate. Rajesh Sharma of Capri Global emphasized the role of Non-Banking Financial Companies in extending credit and supporting consumption, particularly in underserved markets. Nikunj Saraf of Choice Wealth called for fiscal sustainability, tax simplification, and targeted relief to boost consumption and investment. Badal Yagnik of Colliers India advocated for updated affordable housing criteria in Tier-I cities and measures to deepen retail participation in REITs and SM-REITs, alongside sustainability incentives. The Budget Session, spanning 65 days with 30 sittings, will conclude on April 2, with a recess from February 13 to March 9 for Parliamentary Standing Committees to examine Demands for Grants. Nine Bills, including amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and Securities Markets Code, are under consideration.

First Cut Expected in February**\nThe Polish Monetary Policy Council (RPP) has not cut interest rates in January 2026, but analysts predict the first reduction could occur as early as February. Pekao analysts forecast three rate cuts in 2026, bringing the rate down to 3.25%, with the first cut expected at the February 3\u20134 meeting. They argue that while inflation is expected to fall faster than consensus, the window for cuts is narrow, as disinflationary effects from rate hikes will be offset by inflationary impacts from future rate cuts by mid-year. Pekao projects 2026 annual inflation at 1.9%, driven by low food prices, strong energy price control, continued service sector disinflation, and cheap goods from China. However, they anticipate inflation will stabilize around 2.2% by year-end, with a slight rise in 2027 due to base effects and normalization of food and fuel prices. Alior Bank also expects rates to reach 3.25% in 2026, while ING predicts the first cut in March, citing a shift in rhetoric from NBP President Adam Glapi\u0144ski, who stated inflation reduction is 'sustainable'. mBank analysts consider March more likely due to strong inflation projections and signals from the President, though some RPP members remain open to a February move. PKO BP, however, expects rates to end the year at 3.50%, arguing that inflationary upside surprises are diminishing due to already low inflation, increasing the likelihood the cycle ends at 3.5%.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 10:55 PM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,151003,32562983,prognozuja-obnizki-stop-procentowych-kiedy-pierwsze-ciecie.html)\n\n**Labor Market Stability Keeps Fed on Hold: Market Predicts No Rate Cuts**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting on January 28, 2026, with market consensus nearly unanimous in expecting no interest rate cuts. With inflation declining only marginally and employment remaining stable, the Fed has reached a consensus to pause its rate-cutting cycle. The likelihood of no rate cut was projected at 97.2% by CME FedWatch, and economist Nick Timiraos predicted the benchmark rate would remain unchanged, with only minor adjustments to the policy statement. A key indicator will be whether the Fed retains the phrase 'further adjustments'\u2014a sign of potential long-term pause. Future rate cuts will depend on which of two risks\u2014labor market deterioration or persistent inflation\u2014materializes first. Unemployment is stabilizing, while inflation remains at 2.8%, above the 2% target, preventing consensus. Some officials argue to ignore one-time effects like tariffs, believing underlying inflation is near target, while others emphasize official data, seeing continued price pressures. Despite White House pressure to accelerate cuts, most Fed officials favor waiting for more compelling evidence. Timiraos noted that a clear deterioration in the labor market would be necessary to justify rate cuts before mid-year. Meanwhile, Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026, making the successor race a new focal point. Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock, has surged as the top contender, with market odds approaching 50%, surpassing former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Chair Kevin Hassett. Rieder\u2019s rise is attributed to Trump\u2019s public praise and positive internal White House assessments. However, Wall Street remains cautious, as Trump\u2019s emphasis on loyalty may hinder Rieder\u2019s candidacy. If appointed, Rieder would be one of the few Fed chairs without a PhD, relying instead on market experience.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:10 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20260129000902-260301)\n\n**Berlin Cuts Growth Forecast for 2026 Amid Slow Recovery from Fiscal Stimulus**\nThe German government revised its 2026 economic growth forecast downward to 1%, down from 1.3% projected in autumn 2025, citing that expected economic impulses from last year's large-scale fiscal stimulus package did not materialize as quickly or as strongly as anticipated. According to Economy Minister Katherina Reiche, the 'budgetary bazooka'\u2014a multi-hundred-billion-euro plan to modernize defense and infrastructure\u2014was expected to drive recovery in 2026 after a 0.2% growth in 2025 and two consecutive recession years. The plan is projected to account for about two-thirds of 2026's growth, driven by private and public consumption. However, the revision is not surprising, according to economist Felix Schmidt of Berenberg, who cited a sluggish start to the year, supported by the Ifo Institute's January business climate index. Schmidt emphasized that accompanying reforms are necessary to prevent the increased state spending from becoming a costly short-term boom. Reiche defended the government\u2019s support for businesses and households but highlighted the persistently difficult global economic environment, particularly due to rising U.S. tariffs affecting Germany\u2019s export model. Exports to the U.S., Germany\u2019s former top trading partner, fell 9.4% between January and November 2025 compared to 2024. Reiche also noted 'a clear recovery' in the industrial sector, with growth in production and equipment orders. For 2027, the government revised its forecast from 1.4% to 1.3% of GDP.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 02:26 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94AX8CQ)\n\n**Budget 2026 Countdown: Economic Survey to be tabled in Parliament on January 29, Key growth and inflation signals to watch**\nIndia's Economic Survey 2026 will be presented in Parliament on January 29, 2026, ahead of the Union Budget 2026, which will be delivered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2026.

Another 28.9% believe the RBI will hold rates steady, while 26.7% anticipate a cut of 25\u201350 bps. Some respondents expect cuts of 50\u2013100 bps or above 100 bps. The survey includes executives from very large corporates (above Rs 3000 crore), large corporates (Rs 500 crore to Rs 3000 crore), and MSMEs (Rs 500 crore and below). On January 22, a separate Moneycontrol poll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads, and fund managers indicated that the RBI\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to maintain the current interest rate stance in its February 2026 policy review, citing higher growth and inflation averaging around the 4% medium-term target. However, a minority of experts expect a 25 bps rate cut. The MPC is scheduled to meet from February 4 to February 6 for its bi-monthly review. Since February 2025, the RBI has reduced the repo rate by 125 bps\u201425 bps in February and April, 50 bps in June, and 25 bps in December\u2014while keeping rates unchanged in August and October.

This marks a significant decline from the peak of 18.4% in February 2023, with average annual inflation rates of 5.1% in 2021, 14.4% in 2022, and 11.4% in 2023. Inflation is projected to remain around 3.6% in 2024 and 2025. Citi Handlowego economists forecast that CPI could fall below 2% in the first half of 2026, though they remain uncertain about the sustainability of this downward trend in the longer term. The current low inflation is attributed to interest rates maintained near 6% for over a year, but the outlook may worsen due to upcoming rate cuts below 4%, strong economic growth, and lack of fiscal tightening, potentially reversing the decline in the second half of 2026. The first official inflation data for January will be released on February 13, 2026, with the February data and final January figures following on March 13. This delay is due to a basket recalibration and a new COICOP 2018 classification, complicating forecasts. Citi economists predict that rate cuts are likely in March, though a February cut cannot be ruled out, as RPP members' tone has become more dovish. The Monetary Policy Council (RPP) maintained the reference rate at 4.0% in the previous week, consistent with market expectations, following a 175 basis point reduction since May 2025. While the NBP governor's tone remained unchanged, RPP members have increasingly emphasized room for further cuts, with Henryk Wnorowski suggesting a cut in March and a potential rate below 3.5%, and Ludwik Kotecki acknowledging the possibility of a February cut, citing increasingly optimistic inflation prospects.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 01:30 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/gospodarka/inflacja-w-polsce-najnizsza-od-lat-ekonomisci-prognozuja-dalsze-spadki/g6vvxd2)\n\n**Economists Forecast Interest Rate Cuts in 2026 Amid Slowing Inflation and Strong Growth Outlook**\nAccording to Aliora economists, Poland's economy is expected to grow by approximately 3.8% year-on-year (rdr) in 2026, supported by stable private consumption growth (3.4% rdr) and a significant acceleration in investments (8.9% rdr). Favorable conditions include a strong labor market, declining interest rates, improved external demand, and active utilization of EU funds. Additional support is anticipated from moderate economic recovery in Germany, reinforced by planned fiscal stimulus. Inflation is projected to decline to a 2.6% average annual CPI in 2026, down from 3.6% in 2025, with the balance of risks slightly tilted toward deeper disinflation. Economists forecast up to three interest rate cuts totaling 75 basis points in 2026, bringing the NBP's reference rate down to 3.25% by the first half of the year. On January 13\u201314, 2026, the NBP's Monetary Policy Council maintained all interest rates unchanged at 4.0%, consistent with market expectations. Despite falling interest rates benefiting bonds in the previous year, the outlook for the bond market in 2026 is seen as more challenging than in 2025 due to sustained economic growth and inflation returning to central bank targets. The potential for further declines in bond yields appears limited, especially on the long end of the yield curve, with fiscal factors\u2014such as high borrowing needs\u2014playing an increasingly important role in valuations.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 02:56 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/gospodarka/nie-bylo-obnizki-stop-spokojnie-ekonomisci-mowia-ile-ich-bedzie-w-tym-roku/7ykcnkq)\n\n**RPP Holds Interest Rates Steady in January, Pausing Monetary Easing Cycle**\nThe Monetary Policy Council (RPP) of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) decided on January 14, 2026, to maintain interest rates at the unchanged level, confirming economists' expectations. This marks a pause in the ongoing monetary easing cycle, following six consecutive rate reductions since May 2025, which have lowered the policy rate by 175 basis points from its peak in spring 2025. The decision reflects the need to assess the economic impact of previous cuts, particularly as inflation has declined to 2.5%\u2014the NBP's target\u2014due to base effects and falling global energy prices. The current reference rate of 4.00% is below the 26-year median of 4.25%, suggesting the policy may already be slightly expansionary. Economists predict the cycle will end between 3.00% and 3.75% by mid-2026, with only one to three more 25-basis-point cuts expected. Lower rates benefit borrowers, especially those with variable-rate mortgages taken before 2022, and reduce government financing costs. However, they also reduce returns on savings and bonds, limiting safe investment options. Despite this, real interest rates remain positive (ex post), as the reference rate exceeds the previous 12-month CPI inflation. The Council's decision will be detailed in an official statement released at 16:00, with further explanation from NBP President Adam Glapi\u0144ski at a press conference on Thursday. The next meeting is scheduled for February 3\u20134, 2026.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 01:37 PM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/RPP-wcisnela-pauze-Stopy-procentowe-w-styczniu-2026-pozostaja-bez-zmian-9068128.html)\n\n**Interest Rate Cuts in January 2026? RPP Decision May Surprise Markets**\nPoland's National Bank's Monetary Policy Council (RPP) may unexpectedly lower interest rates in January 2026, despite earlier signals of a pause. According to Adam Antoniak, economist at ING Bank \u015al\u0105ski, there is approximately a 35% chance of a rate cut, driven by unexpectedly low inflation in December 2025, which fell to 2.4% year-on-year, down from 2.5% in November. This marks a significant shift from previous expectations, as RPP members acknowledged during post-Christmas discussions that a rate reduction could be on the table. Although the baseline scenario remains unchanged rates, the RPP's historical sensitivity to real-time inflation data increases the likelihood of a surprise decision. Antoniak forecasts three rate cuts in 2026, reducing the reference rate from 4.0% to 3.25%, with inflation expected to remain below the National Bank of Poland\u2019s (NBP) target of 2.5% at least through mid-2026. He also warns that additional cuts may occur if inflation falls further than expected, emphasizing that the RPP remains highly responsive to current macroeconomic data.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 11:03 AM\nSource:[superbiz.se.pl](https://superbiz.se.pl/wiadomosci/obnizka-stop-procentowych-w-styczniu-analityk-ocenia-szanse-aa-1g5D-uPce-iZzk.html)\n\n**Market Expects RPP to Pause Rate Cuts in January, Marking End of Monetary Easing Cycle**\nThe market consensus expects the Polish Monetary Policy Council (RPP) to pause its series of interest rate cuts in January 2026, with most economists forecasting no change in the policy rate at 4.00% until at least March, and possibly until April. This follows six consecutive rate reductions by the National Bank of Poland (NBP), lowering the reference rate from 5.75% to 4.00% since May 2025, marking the end of a 'non-cycle' of monetary easing. The current 4.00% rate is likely below the neutral level\u2014historically median at 4.25% over the past 26 years\u2014and may now signal mildly expansionary policy. Market expectations, reflected in FRA 3x6 and 6x9 contracts, suggest a future rate of around 3.60% in three months and 3.45% in six months, implying only one or two more 25-basis-point cuts are likely before the cycle concludes, possibly by mid-2026. However, uncertainty remains, as the RPP has not confirmed a pause. While December statements from RPP members hinted at a break, recent comments from I. D\u0105browski suggest balanced odds for another cut. Arguments for a pause include the lack of new inflation data in January and February, pending revisions to the CPI basket in March, and the fact that December CPI fell slightly below the 2.5% target at 2.4%. Inflation forecasts for 2026, as per the latest NBP survey, average 2.6%, within the 2.0\u20133.3% acceptable range around the 2.5% target, reducing pressure for further cuts. Additionally, the RPP\u2019s composition will change in January with Marcin Zarzecki replacing Cezary Kochalski, though his monetary policy views are not yet widely known. The next RPP meeting is scheduled for January 3\u20134, followed by meetings in March and April. The NBP does not publish decisions at a fixed time, but typically releases them around 15:00, with a press conference scheduled for Thursday at 15:00. The August meeting, traditionally a two-day decisional session, will not take place this year.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Co-zrobi-RPP-Rynek-zaklada-przerwe-w-niecyklu-obnizek-stop-9066953.html)\n\n**Mark Zandi predicts three Fed rate cuts before June as job market weakens**\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, predicts that the Federal Reserve will implement three interest rate cuts before June 2026, each of 0.25 percentage points, citing a weakening job market, uncertain inflation signals, and growing political pressure. He argues that sluggish hiring\u2014driven by businesses' hesitation due to recent trade and immigration policy changes\u2014will lead to rising unemployment, which will compel the Fed to cut rates earlier and more aggressively than market expectations suggest. Current market pricing, based on CME FedWatch data, reflects only two rate cuts, with one possible in April and another in September. Fed officials, as shown in the December 2025 FOMC dot plot, are even more cautious, projecting just one cut for all of 2026, and that decision was closely divided. Zandi attributes the urgency to political influence, noting that President Donald Trump, now back in office, has already appointed three of seven Fed governors (Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, and Stephen Miran), and is expected to appoint a new Fed governor in January 2026 and a new Fed chair in May 2026. Zandi warns that Trump\u2019s push for lower rates, especially ahead of midterm elections, threatens the independence of the Federal Reserve. He emphasizes that the current political alignment increases pressure for faster rate cuts, which could shift market expectations rapidly. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 27\u201328, 2026, but traders currently assign only a 13.8% chance of a rate cut then.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mark-zandi-3-fed-rate-cuts-in-first-half-26/)\n\n**Economist Mark Zandi sees the Fed surprising with three rate cuts in first half of 2026**\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts the Federal Reserve will implement three 0.25 percentage point interest rate cuts by mid-2026, driven by a persistently weak labor market, uncertainty over inflation, and increasing political pressure. Zandi argues that businesses will remain hesitant to hire until they feel confident about shifting trade and immigration policies, leading to insufficient job growth and rising unemployment\u2014conditions that will compel the Fed to act. This forecast contrasts with market expectations, which anticipate only two cuts (with the first likely in April and the second in September), and the Fed officials\u2019 own projections, which indicate just one cut for the entire year. Zandi highlights the potential for President Donald Trump to reshape the Federal Reserve\u2019s leadership by appointing additional loyalists, including a new chair in May 2026, which could erode Fed independence. He warns that political pressure will intensify ahead of the midterm elections, further pushing the Fed toward aggressive rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 27\u201328, 2026, with market odds of a rate cut at only 13.8%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/economist-mark-zandi-sees-the-fed-surprising-with-three-rate-cuts-in-first-half-of-2026-.html)\n\n**Federal Reserve May Cut Rates Twice in 2026: Wall Street Forecasts, with January First Cut in Focus**\nThe Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday, in line with market expectations. Although labeled as an 'hawkish cut,' the overall tone was less restrictive than previously feared, leading some observers to describe it as 'hawkish underperformance.' Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that current interest rates are in a good position to handle economic changes and noted that recent labor market data may have overestimated monthly job gains by about 60,000. The Fed's 'dot plot' showed a median forecast of only one 25-basis-point rate cut in 2026, unchanged from September. However, the Fed emphasized that future cuts' timing and magnitude will depend on economic developments. Despite the Fed's cautious stance, most Wall Street banks still expect two 25-basis-point cuts in 2026, totaling 50 basis points, though they differ on timing. Citigroup forecasts cuts in January and March; Morgan Stanley predicts January and April. Morgan Stanley expects the first cut in January, while UBS also forecasts one cut in Q1. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Barclays anticipate two cuts, likely in March and June. Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Economist David Mericle highlighted that the Fed's acknowledgment of overestimated job growth and its dovish comments on labor markets and inflation progress contributed to a more dovish market reaction. Notably, the dot plot reflects a 2026 forecast of one cut, but this could shift after Powell's departure in May 2026, with potential replacement Kevin Hassett seen as more inclined toward aggressive easing. According to LSEG data, traders expect about 55.5 basis points of cuts by end-2026. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for January 27\u201328, 2026. CME FedWatch shows a 24.4% probability of a January 2026 rate cut and a 75.6% probability of no change. A few banks, including Standard Chartered, maintain a 'no-cut' stance for 2026. HSBC also predicts the Fed will hold rates steady at 3.5%-3.75% through 2026 and 2027, citing Powell's open-ended comments on future cuts and ongoing risks to the outlook.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 03:29 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202512123589973728.html)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
