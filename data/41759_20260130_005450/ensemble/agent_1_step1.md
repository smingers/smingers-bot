  - CRR cut from 6% to 5% announced (100bp liquidity injection)
  - Real policy rate described as "adequately positive on forward-looking basis"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Pakistani policy rate changes during IMF programs (2019-2026):**
   - Highly suitable: Current $7bn EFF program active through 2027
   - IMF conditionality requires positive real rates
   - Pattern: Rates held or cut gradually when inflation stabilizes

2. **Emerging market central banks in disinflation phases:**
   - Moderately suitable: General EM behavior
   - Less specific to Pakistan's unique constraints

3. **SBP easing cycles historically:**
   - Suitable: Shows typical pace and magnitude
   - 2024-2025 cycle: -1,550bp over 19 months (~80bp/month average)
   - But easing typically slows as rates approach neutral

**Most Suitable: Pakistani policy rate during current IMF program with disinflation context**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**Expected MPC Meetings in Period:**
Based on historical pattern (roughly every 6-8 weeks):
- Likely 1-2 meetings between now and May 1, 2026
- Possible dates: Mid-March 2026, potentially late April 2026

**Historical Pattern Analysis (Recent Easing Cycle):**

From Agent Report, post-peak easing decisions:
- June 2024: -150bp
- July 2024: -150bp  
- September 2024: -150bp
- November 2024: -250bp
- December 2024: -200bp
- January 2025: -100bp
- March 2025: 0bp (hold)
- October 2025: Rate at 10.50%
- January 2026: 0bp (hold)

**Pattern Observations:**
1. Easing pace has decelerated significantly (from 150-250bp cuts to holds)
2. Two consecutive holds (March 2025, January 2026) suggest approaching terminal rate
3. When SBP describes real rate as "adequately positive," typically signals pause
4. Historical 3-month windows during easing cycles show 0-300bp total movement

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Key Factors Supporting Limited Further Easing:**

1. **IMF Program Constraints:** Conditionality requires positive real rates. With inflation at 5.6% and core at 7.4%, current 10.5% nominal rate yields ~4.9% real rate (vs headline) or ~3.1% (vs core). IMF review in May 2026 creates incentive to maintain credibility.

2. **Forward Guidance:** SBP explicitly stated rate is "adequately positive on forward-looking basis" and held in January 2026 despite market expectations of cuts. This signals approaching terminal rate.

3. **Inflation Risks:** MPC flagged commodity volatility, wheat prices, energy tariffs as upside risks. Core inflation at 7.4% (above target band) suggests caution warranted.

4. **Easing Cycle Stage:** -1,550bp cumulative easing suggests substantial accommodation already delivered. Diminishing returns and approaching neutral rate.

5. **Alternative Easing:** 100bp CRR cut provides liquidity without cutting policy rate, suggesting SBP prefers non-rate tools currently.

**Factors Supporting Further Cuts:**

1. **Disinflation Success:** Headline inflation within 5-7% target band
2. **Growth Support:** GDP growth upgraded to 3.75-4.75%, but still modest
3. **Market Expectations:** Pre-January meeting, 80% expected cuts
4. **Regional Context:** Real rates still high by EM standards

**Most Likely Scenarios for May 1, 2026:**

**Base Case (60% probability):** 0-50bp additional easing
- One meeting with 0-50bp cut, or hold at 10.5%
- Range: 10.00-10.50%

**Moderate Easing (25% probability):** 75-100bp easing  
- Two meetings with cuts, or one larger cut
- Range: 9.50-10.00%

**Status Quo (10% probability):** Rate unchanged at 10.50%
- If inflation surprises upward or external shock occurs

**Aggressive Easing (5% probability):** >100bp easing
- Would require significant positive surprise on inflation/external front
- Range: <9.50%

Outside view calibration:

Given the analysis above, I need to construct a distribution that:

1. **Centers around 10.0-10.5%:** The January 2026 hold at 10.5% and forward guidance suggesting adequacy of current stance point to limited movement. However, the 3-month window allows for 1-2 potential meetings.

2. **Accounts for easing bias:** The easing cycle is ongoing but decelerating. Market expectations lean toward further cuts despite the January hold. The CRR cut suggests SBP wants easier conditions but may prefer non-rate tools.

3. **Reflects IMF constraints:** The May 2026 IMF review creates a floor around maintaining positive real rates. With core inflation at 7.4%, rates below 9.0% would compress real rates significantly.

4. **Incorporates uncertainty:** Inflation could surprise (either direction), external shocks possible, political/fiscal risks noted by MPC.

5. **Historical precedent:** During previous easing cycles, 3-month windows showed 0-150bp movement when approaching terminal rate. The current context (two holds in recent meetings, explicit "adequate" language) suggests lower end of this range.

**Distribution Construction:**

- **10th percentile:** Must account for upside surprise scenario (rate hike or larger-than-expected hold). Given inflation risks flagged, 10.50% (unchanged) is reasonable floor for 10th percentile, but I should allow for possibility of a small hike if inflation surprises. Set at 10.50%.

- **20th percentile:** Status quo or minimal movement. 10.25-10.50% range.

- **40th percentile:** Small cut scenario (25-50bp). Around 10.00-10.25%.

- **60th percentile (median):** Base case with 50bp cut or hold plus small cut. Around 9.75-10.00%.

- **80th percentile:** More aggressive easing (75-100bp total). Around 9.50%.

- **90th percentile:** Tail scenario with aggressive easing or multiple cuts. Around 9.00-9.25%.

The distribution should be somewhat right-skewed (toward higher rates) given the explicit forward guidance and recent holds, but with meaningful probability mass in the 9.5-10.5% range.

**Calibration checks:**
- Range spans ~1.5-2.0 percentage points (reasonable for 3-month EM policy rate uncertainty)
- Mode around 10.0% aligns with base case of modest further easing
- 80% confidence interval (P10-P90) of roughly 10.5% to 9.25% = 125bp range seems appropriate given historical volatility and current uncertainty
- Median below current rate reflects easing bias but not dramatically so
