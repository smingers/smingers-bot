## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large shifts warranted):**

1. **Recent Policy Hold Despite Market Expectations (Jan 26, 2026):** SBP held at 10.5% when 82.6% of market expected cuts. MPC explicitly stated real rate "adequately positive" for medium-term target. This is strong evidence of terminal rate proximity.
   - **Direction:** Supports minimal further easing (0-50bp)
   - **Weight:** Very high - most recent official action contradicts easing expectations

2. **IMF Program Constraints:** $7B EFF through 2027 with conditionality requiring positive real rates. With core inflation at 7.4% (from agent report), current 10.5% rate yields only 3.1% real rate vs core.
   - **Direction:** Creates floor around 9.5-10% (below this, real rates become inadequate)
   - **Weight:** High - structural constraint, not easily changed

3. **Inflation Trajectory Stabilization:** Headline inflation at 5.6% (Dec 2025), within 5-7% target band. Multiple sources (S&P, SBP, Topline) project inflation remaining 5-7% range through 2026-27.
   - **Direction:** Supports gradual easing but not aggressive cuts
   - **Weight:** High - consistent across multiple independent forecasters

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate shifts):**

4. **"Mid-2026" Easing Timeline:** Both Pakbanker and Nerdherd (citing Topline Securities) reference "gradual reduction in interest rates by mid-2026."
   - **Direction:** Supports 25-75bp cuts by May 1, 2026
   - **Weight:** Moderate - identified source (Topline) but not official guidance
   - **Issue:** May 1 is early-to-mid 2026, so timing alignment uncertain

5. **Alternative Policy Tools Deployed:** 100bp CRR cut (from 6% to 5%) provides liquidity without rate cuts.
   - **Direction:** Suggests SBP prefers non-rate easing currently
   - **Weight:** Moderate - indicates policy preference but doesn't preclude rate cuts

6. **Economic Growth Momentum:** GDP growth upgraded to 3.75-4.75% (FY26), stronger than expected.
   - **Direction:** Mixed - supports easing (less need for restrictive policy) but also reduces urgency
   - **Weight:** Moderate - growth still modest by historical standards

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Small adjustments):**

7. **Business Community Pressure:** FPCCI calling for 7% rate (350bp cut from 10.5%).
   - **Direction:** Supports aggressive easing
   - **Weight:** Very weak - advocacy position, not neutral analysis; SBP demonstrated independence by holding despite pressure

8. **Market Survey Expectations:** Pre-January meeting, 82.6% expected cuts.
   - **Direction:** Supported easing
   - **Weight:** Weak - already proven wrong by actual decision; suggests market may overestimate easing pace

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 30 to May 1, 2026 = 91 days (13 weeks, ~3 months)

**Expected MPC Meetings:**
Based on historical 6-8 week intervals:
- **Most likely:** 2 meetings (mid-March, late April)
- **Possible:** 1 meeting (if schedule shifts) or 3 meetings (if accelerated)

**If Timeframe Halved (45 days to mid-March):**
- Only 0-1 meetings likely
- Prediction would shift RIGHT (higher rates): 10th percentile → 10.25%, median → 10.0-10.25%, 90th → 9.75%
- Less time for easing cycle to progress

**If Timeframe Doubled (182 days to late July):**
- Likely 3-4 meetings
- Prediction would shift LEFT (lower rates): 10th percentile → 10.0%, median → 9.25-9.5%, 90th → 8.5%
- "Mid-2026 easing" timeline would be fully incorporated
- More meetings allow cumulative cuts of 100-150bp

## (d) Justification for Distribution

**Key Factors Shifting Outside View:**

1. **January 2026 Hold is Game-Changer:** The outside view suggested 60% probability of 0-50bp easing based on historical patterns. However, the actual hold on Jan 26 despite strong market expectations (82.6% expected cuts) is NEW information suggesting:
   - Terminal rate closer than markets anticipated
   - SBP prioritizing inflation credibility over growth support
   - **Shift:** Increases probability mass at 10.0-10.5% range

2. **"Adequately Positive" Forward Guidance:** This explicit language is dovish-neutral, not hawkish, but signals satisfaction with current stance. Historical precedent: when SBP uses this language, holds or small cuts (25bp) follow.
   - **Shift:** Reduces probability of >75bp total easing

3. **IMF Review Timing:** May 2026 IMF review creates incentive to maintain credible positive real rates through April. With core inflation at 7.4%, rates below 9.5% compress real rates to <2%, risking IMF concerns.
   - **Shift:** Creates effective floor at 9.5% for 80-90th percentile

4. **Mid-2026 Easing References:** Multiple sources reference easing "by mid-2026" but May 1 is early-to-mid. This suggests:
   - If easing comes, likely starts March/April
   - Total magnitude limited to 50-100bp by May 1
   - **Shift:** Supports 9.5-10.25% median range

5. **Dual Uncertainty:** 
   - **Upside (higher rates):** Inflation could surprise upward (commodity shocks, wheat prices mentioned as risks)
   - **Downside (lower rates):** Growth could weaken more than expected, prompting faster easing
   - **Shift:** Widens distribution tails slightly

**Why Current Circumstances Differ from Base Reference Class:**

The outside view was calibrated on "approaching terminal rate" historical patterns showing 0-150bp movement in 3-month windows. Current circumstances are MORE restrictive:
- Explicit "adequate" language wasn't present in all historical episodes
- IMF program timing (review in May) is specific constraint
- Recent hold despite market expectations shows SBP more hawkish than anticipated

**However**, circumstances aren't SO different to warrant dramatic shift. The easing cycle is ongoing (not reversed), inflation is on target, and "mid-2026 easing" references suggest movement is still expected.

## Probability Calibration

**Distribution Construction Logic:**

**10th Percentile (10.5%):** 
- Represents scenario where SBP holds through May 1 or cuts minimally (0-25bp)
- Probability: ~10% that no meaningful easing occurs
- Justification: January hold + "adequate" language + potential inflation surprises

**20th Percentile (10.25%):**
- One 25bp cut in March or April
- Probability: ~10% (cumulative 20%) of minimal easing
- Justification: Most conservative easing scenario

**40th Percentile (10.0%):**
- Two 25bp cuts OR one 50bp cut
- Probability: ~20% (cumulative 40%) 
- Justification: Moderate easing aligned with "gradual" language

**60th Percentile (Median: 9.75%):**
- 75bp total easing (e.g., 50bp + 25bp across two meetings)
- Probability: Central scenario
- Justification: Balances January hold signal with mid-2026 easing references

**80th Percentile (9.5%):**
- 100bp total easing (e.g., two 50bp cuts)
- Probability: ~20% (from 60th to 80th)
- Justification: More aggressive easing if inflation remains benign; approaches IMF floor

**90th Percentile (9.25%):**
- 125bp total easing (e.g., 50bp + 50bp + 25bp if three meetings occur)
- Probability: ~10% tail scenario
- Justification: Optimistic scenario with accelerated easing schedule

**Distribution Characteristics:**
- **Mode:** ~10.0% (most likely single outcome)
- **Median:** 9.75% (50% probability above/below)
- **Mean:** ~9.85% (slightly above median due to right skew)
- **Right skew:** Reflects higher probability of holds/minimal cuts than aggressive easing
- **90% confidence interval:** 10.5% to 9.25% (125bp range) - appropriately wide for 3-month EM policy uncertainty

**Sanity Checks:**
1. ✓ Range (10.5% to 9.25% = 125bp) reasonable for 3-month window with 1-2 meetings
2. ✓ Median (9.75%) implies 75bp easing - aligned with "gradual mid-2026" narrative
3. ✓ Distribution respects IMF floor (~9.5%) at 80th percentile
4. ✓ Recent hold incorporated via elevated probability mass at 10.0-10.5%
5. ✓ Wider tails than outside view to account for "unknown unknowns"

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** SBP policy rate (%) on May 1, 2026, 11:59 PM UTC (91 days from now)

2. **Outside view:** 10th: 10.50%, Median: 9.75%, 90th: 9.25% - established from historical easing cycle patterns approaching terminal rate

3. **Consistency:** Implied median = 9.75%; mean ≈ 9.85%. Makes sense: 75bp easing over 3 months with 1-2 meetings aligns with "gradual mid-2026" guidance while respecting January hold signal.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Jan 26 hold at 10.5% despite 82.6% market expecting cuts (strong signal of terminal rate proximity)
   - "Adequately positive" forward guidance suggests satisfaction with current stance
   - IMF May 2026 review creates floor around 9.5% (core inflation 7.4% requires >2% real rate)
   - Multiple sources reference "mid-2026" easing timeline (May 1 is early-mid, suggests 50-100bp by then)
   - Core inflation 7.4% vs headline 5.6% shows stickiness requiring caution

5. **Blind-spot:** Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly: **Unexpected external shock** (geopolitical crisis, commodity price spike, currency crisis) forcing SBP to hold or hike. This would push outcome UP (toward 10.5-11.0%). Probability: ~5-10%. Alternatively, **faster-than-expected disinflation** allowing aggressive easing could push DOWN (toward 8.5-9.0%), but less likely given core inflation stickiness.
