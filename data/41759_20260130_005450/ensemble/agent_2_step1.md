## Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **CEIC Data (November 2025)**: High-quality data aggregator showing policy rate at 12.00% in November 2025, unchanged from October. Provides historical context (min 6.25% in Dec 2017, max 23.00% in May 2024). Factual, no opinions.

2. **TradingView (April 2024)**: Contains outdated information (10.5% rate) and confusing commentary mixing different time periods. Low reliability for current forecasting.

3. **SBP Website Index (January 29, 2026)**: Navigation page only, confirms data availability but provides no actual values. Limited utility.

4. **Aaj English TV (January 26, 2026)**: Reports current rate at 10.5% and upcoming MPC meeting. Survey data shows 80% expect rate cut (majority 50bp). **Opinion quality: Low** - survey respondents and analysts unnamed/unattributed.

5. **The Express Tribune (September 6, 2025)**: Historical article about September 2025 meeting expectations. Topline Securities (named source) expected status quo due to flood-related inflation risks. **Opinion quality: Medium** - named institutional source but dated.

6. **The Nation (January 26, 2026)**: Reports 10.5% current rate with expectations of 50-100bp cut. Lists supporting factors (stable reserves, moderating inflation, rising remittances). **Opinion quality: Medium** - general economist consensus but not attributed to specific experts.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive timeline from 2020-2026 with meeting-by-meeting rate changes. Key facts:
- Rate peaked at 22% (June 2023)
- Easing cycle began June 2024 (20.50%)
- January 27, 2025: Cut to 12.00%
- March 10, 2025: Held at 12.00%
- By October 2025: Cut to 10.50%
- **January 26, 2026: Held at 10.50%** (most recent decision)

Critical forward guidance from Jan 26, 2026 MPS:
- Real policy rate "adequately positive on a forward-looking basis"
- Inflation projected 5-7% for FY-26 and FY-27
- Growth upgraded to 3.75-4.75%
- CRR cut by 100bp (liquidity injection signal)
- IMF program on track with third review in May 2026

## Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Pakistani easing cycles (2020-2021, 2024-2026)**: After the COVID emergency cuts (13.25% → 7% over 3 months), SBP held at 7% for 14 months before normalizing. Current cycle: 22% → 10.50% over 19 months (June 2024-January 2026).

2. **Emerging market central banks under IMF programs**: Typically maintain positive real rates (nominal rate > inflation) as conditionality. With inflation at 5-7% and rate at 10.50%, real rate is +3.5 to +5.5%.

3. **SBP behavior in final approach to neutral rate**: Historical neutral rate estimates for Pakistan range 6-8%. The pace of cuts typically slows as rates approach neutral.

**Most suitable reference class**: Current easing cycle (June 2024-present) combined with IMF program constraints, as this captures both the disinflation trajectory and external conditionality framework.

## Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction horizon**: January 30, 2026 → May 1, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**MPC meeting schedule**: SBP typically meets every 6-8 weeks. Expected meetings before May 1:
- Mid-March 2026 (~6 weeks from Jan 26)
- Late April 2026 (~6 weeks after March meeting)

So **1-2 policy meetings** will occur before the resolution date.

**Historical patterns over similar 3-month periods during easing cycles:**

- June-September 2024: 20.50% → 17.50% (-300bp over 3 meetings)
- September-December 2024: 17.50% → 13.00% (-450bp over 3 meetings)  
- December 2024-January 2025: 13.00% → 12.00% (-100bp, 1 meeting)
- January-March 2025: 12.00% → 12.00% (hold)
- Late 2025 (estimated): 12.00% → 10.50% (-150bp over ~3-4 months)

**Pattern observation**: Easing pace has decelerated significantly. Early cuts were 150-250bp; recent cuts are 0-100bp per meeting.

## Justification

**Key factors supporting limited further easing:**

1. **SBP's explicit guidance**: "Real policy rate is adequately positive on a forward-looking basis" signals satisfaction with current stance. The CRR cut provides liquidity stimulus without lowering rates.

2. **IMF conditionality**: Third review in May 2026 requires maintaining positive real rates. With inflation at 5-7%, a rate above 8-9% is likely minimum acceptable.

3. **Inflation risks**: Core inflation at 7.4% (stickier than headline). Temporary upticks expected mid-2026 as base effects fade. Energy tariff adjustments remain a risk.

4. **Historical approach to neutral**: As rates near estimated neutral (6-8%), central banks typically pause or slow. At 10.50%, SBP is likely 2-4 percentage points above neutral.

5. **Recent hold decision**: January 26 hold after a 50bp cut in late 2025 suggests increased caution.

**Most likely scenario**: 0-2 cuts of 25-50bp each before May 1, resulting in a rate between 9.50% and 10.50%.

**Tail risks:**
- **Upside**: Inflation surprise, fiscal slippage, or external shock could trigger hold or even reversal (low probability given trajectory)
- **Downside**: Aggressive easing to stimulate growth if inflation remains subdued (constrained by IMF program)

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should center around 10.00-10.50% with the following considerations:

1. **Status quo bias**: The January 26 hold at 10.50% creates a strong anchor. If no cuts occur (20-30% probability), rate remains 10.50%.

2. **Single 25-50bp cut scenario** (40-50% probability): Results in 10.00-10.25% range. This aligns with gradual approach as rates near neutral.

3. **Two cuts totaling 50-100bp** (20-30% probability): Results in 9.50-10.00% range. Requires sustained disinflation and IMF flexibility.

4. **More aggressive easing** (<10% probability): Would push below 9.50%, but constrained by IMF program and real rate requirements.

5. **Rate increase** (<5% probability): Would require significant inflation or external shock.

The 90/10 confidence interval should span roughly 9.00% to 11.00% to account for:
- Uncertainty in number of meetings (could be 1 or 2)
- Size of potential cuts (0, 25, or 50bp per meeting)
- Unexpected shocks (positive or negative)
- IMF review outcomes

Historical volatility during easing cycles suggests 150-200bp range is reasonable for a 3-month window, though current trajectory suggests lower volatility given proximity to neutral rate.
