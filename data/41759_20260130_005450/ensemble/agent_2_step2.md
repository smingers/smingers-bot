## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**

1. **Express Tribune (26 Jan 2026)**: Major Pakistani newspaper reporting SBP held rate at 10.5% on 26 Jan 2026. Factual content: current rate, inflation at 5.6% (Dec 2025), GDP growth 3.7% (Q1), reserves at $16.1bn. Opinion content: Business community disappointment (FPCCI President named), market survey showing 82.6% expected cuts. **Quality: High for facts, moderate for opinions (identifiable sources).**

2. **Pakbanker (29 Jan 2026)**: Reports S&P Global and SBP projections. Factual: Inflation 5.1% (2026), 5.6% (2027); GDP growth 3.5% (FY26), 4.4% (FY27). Contains statement about "gradual reduction in interest rates by mid-2026" but unclear if this is S&P's view or speculation. **Quality: Moderate (secondary synthesis).**

3. **NERDHERD (23 Jan 2026)**: Topline Securities forecasts. Factual: PKR projections, remittances $41.2bn expected. Key statement: "Inflation could ease to around 7%, allowing for a gradual reduction in interest rates by mid-2026." **Quality: Moderate (single analyst firm opinion).**

4. **Express Tribune (15 Sep 2025)**: Historical context - rate held at 11% due to flood disruption. Shows SBP's cautious approach to supply shocks. **Quality: High for historical context.**

5. **Express Tribune (29 Jul 2025)**: Pre-meeting analysis when rate was 11%. Shows real rate was 7.8% (highest regionally). Business demands for 6% rate. **Quality: High for context, weak for forward guidance (outdated).**

6. **AskNews - News18 (28 Jan 2026)**: Reports S&P Global projections aligning with SBP estimates. Inflation 5.1% (2026), 5.6% (2027). Current account deficit 0.5% (2026). **Quality: Moderate (confirms other sources).**

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- Current rate: 10.5% (as of 26 Jan 2026)
- Last cut: 50bp on 15 Dec 2025
- Inflation: 5.6% (Dec 2025), projected 5.1-5.6% for 2026
- Real rate: ~450-500bp (10.5% minus 5.6%)
- Reserves: $16.1bn, projected >$18bn by June 2026
- IMF target: 5-7% inflation range

**Expert Opinions (Identifiable):**
- Topline Securities: Expects gradual rate cuts by mid-2026
- S&P Global: Inflation to stabilize in 5-7% range
- Business community (FPCCI): Demanded 350bp cut (rejected by SBP)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **SBP's 26 Jan 2026 hold decision despite market expectations** - Multiple sources confirm 80%+ of economists expected a cut, but SBP held. This signals heightened caution and suggests slower easing pace than market anticipated. The MPC statement emphasized "adequately positive real rate" needed to stabilize inflation in 5-7% range.

2. **Real rate currently 450-500bp** - With policy rate at 10.5% and inflation at 5.6%, the real rate exceeds typical EM norms (3-4%). However, SBP's explicit guidance is that this level is "adequate" not "excessive," suggesting limited urgency to cut aggressively.

3. **IMF program compliance** - Pakistan is under EFF/RSF. IMF typically requires positive real rates until inflation durably reaches target. With inflation only recently entering the 5-7% band and having spiked to 6.1% in November, the SBP likely faces IMF pressure to maintain restrictive stance.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Market pricing and T-bill yields** - Treasury bills falling to single digits suggests market expects at least one more cut. However, the surprise hold in January indicates market may be front-running too aggressively.

2. **Next MPC meeting timing** - Only one scheduled meeting (mid-March 2026) before 1 May 2026 resolution. This limits the mechanical opportunity for change to a single decision point.

3. **Analyst forecasts of "mid-2026" cuts** - Multiple sources (Topline, NERDHERD) reference mid-2026 for rate reductions. May 1 sits at the boundary of "mid-2026," suggesting cuts may commence around that time but not necessarily before.

4. **Historical 50bp step pattern** - Last three moves were 50bp increments. If SBP cuts in March, 50bp would bring rate to 10.0%.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Business community demands** - While vocal, the FPCCI's call for 7% rate was explicitly rejected. This represents lobbying pressure, not policy signal.

2. **Flood risks** - September 2025 floods caused caution, but current sources don't indicate renewed supply disruptions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Days to resolution:** 92 days (30 Jan to 1 May 2026)

**Meeting schedule:** Realistically only ONE MPC meeting before resolution (mid-March, ~45 days out). 

**If timeframe halved (46 days):** Would likely catch the March meeting. Probability of "no change" would increase to ~40% as SBP just held in January and typically waits 6-8 weeks between moves. Single-cut scenario (to 10.0%) would be ~50%.

**If timeframe doubled (184 days, ~6 months):** Would capture 2-3 additional meetings (May, July). Probability distribution would shift significantly lower - likely 8.5-9.5% range as median, reflecting cumulative 100-200bp of cuts as inflation stabilizes and IMF review (May) concludes favorably.

**Critical insight:** The resolution date (1 May) falls in an awkward window - likely AFTER the March meeting but BEFORE the next meeting. This creates a binary scenario: either the March meeting cuts (and rate changes) or it doesn't (and rate stays 10.5%).

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline:** Median –75bp (to 9.75%), IQR 0 to –150bp (9.0-10.5%)

**Pakistan-specific factors warranting adjustment UPWARD (toward status quo):**

1. **January hold was a hawkish surprise** - 80%+ of economists expected a cut; SBP held. This reveals the MPC is more cautious than consensus. The statement emphasized maintaining "adequately positive" real rates, not reducing them.

2. **Only one meeting window** - Unlike the reference class (which assumes continuous decision-making), Pakistan has discrete 6-8 week intervals. The March meeting is the ONLY opportunity for change before resolution.

3. **IMF review in May 2026** - The next major IMF assessment occurs around the resolution date. SBP historically tightens policy discipline before reviews. This creates incentive to hold until after the review.

4. **Inflation only recently stabilized** - December 2025 was 5.6%, but November was 6.1%. The SBP likely wants 2-3 more months of data showing sustained disinflation before cutting.

5. **"Mid-2026" guidance** - Multiple analyst sources reference mid-2026 for cuts. May 1 is the START of mid-2026, suggesting cuts may commence in May/June meetings, not before.

**Factors warranting adjustment DOWNWARD (toward cuts):**

1. **Real rate is very high** - At 450-500bp, Pakistan's real rate exceeds most EM peers. Economic growth is modest (3.5-4%), suggesting room to ease.

2. **Market pricing** - T-bill yields and market expectations indicate at least one cut is anticipated.

3. **Historical easing cycle** - Pakistan cut 50bp in December; typically once a cycle starts, it continues (though January's hold interrupted this).

**Net assessment:** The January hold was a strong signal that SBP is prioritizing caution over market expectations. The single-meeting constraint before resolution means the outcome is largely binary: either a 50bp cut in March (to 10.0%) or no change (stays 10.5%). Given the hawkish surprise in January and "mid-2026" guidance, I weight the probability of "no change" higher than the reference class median would suggest.

## Probability Calibration

**Scenario probabilities:**

1. **No change (10.5%):** 50% - SBP holds in March, citing need for more data on inflation sustainability, IMF review proximity, or external uncertainties. This is MUCH higher than the reference class because of the January surprise and single-meeting constraint.

2. **Single 50bp cut (10.0%):** 40% - SBP cuts in March meeting, following historical 50bp step pattern, as inflation data through Feb/Mar confirms stabilization in 5-7% band.

3. **Single 100bp cut (9.5%):** 5% - Aggressive cut if inflation falls sharply or external conditions (oil prices, remittances) improve dramatically. Low probability given January's caution.

4. **Two cuts totaling 100bp (9.5%):** 3% - Would require an emergency inter-meeting cut or a second meeting squeezed in before May 1. Mechanically unlikely.

5. **Hike (11.0%+):** 2% - Only if major shock (currency crisis, food inflation spike, geopolitical event). Tail risk.

**Distribution construction:**
- Median: 10.25% (weighted average of 10.5% and 10.0% scenarios)
- Mode: 10.5% (most likely single outcome)
- Mean: ~10.2% (slightly below median due to small downside tail)

I'll construct percentiles to reflect:
- High probability mass at 10.0% and 10.5%
- Small downside tail to 9.0-9.5% (aggressive easing)
- Tiny upside tail to 11.0%+ (shock scenario)
- Wide 10/90 interval (9.3% to 10.8%) to reflect genuine uncertainty

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** SBP policy rate on 1 May 2026, in percent, based on official SBP statements.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Median –75bp from 10.5% = 9.75%; IQR 9.0-10.5%. My final prediction shifts UPWARD due to January hawkish hold and single-meeting constraint.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 10.25%; mean = 10.2%. This makes sense given 50% weight on status quo (10.5%) and 40% on single cut (10.0%), with small downside tail pulling mean slightly below median.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - SBP held on 26 Jan despite 80%+ expecting cut (hawkish surprise) ✓
   - Only one MPC meeting (March) before 1 May resolution ✓
   - Real rate at 450-500bp deemed "adequate" by SBP statement ✓
   - Multiple analysts cite "mid-2026" for cuts; May 1 is boundary ✓
   - IMF review in May creates incentive to hold until after ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** If February/March inflation data shows unexpected decline to 4.5% or below, AND external conditions (oil, rupee) improve sharply, SBP might cut 100bp in March to avoid over-tightening. This would push outcome to 9.5%, making my 10.0-10.5% concentration look too conservative. Probability: ~8%.
