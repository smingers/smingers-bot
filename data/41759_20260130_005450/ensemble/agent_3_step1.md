Analysis:
1. Source analysis:
 • The CEIC Data article (November 2025) is purely historical and data‐driven, showing the policy rate at 12.00% in November 2025. It is reliable for historical context but offers no forward guidance.
 • The TradingView summary (dated April 2024) presents a mix of current rate observations (10.5% at the time) and a commentary that infers a possible high rate (22%), though that “22%” view appears outdated and inconsistent. Its factual data is less current for our January 2026 forecast.
 • The SBP website summary (last updated January 29, 2026) simply indicates the continued tracking of historical rates without offering a fresh decision—its quality is high but it does not give a definitive forward-looking number.
 • The Aaj English TV and The Nation articles, both from January 26, 2026, provide up‐to‐the‐minute market expectations and report that the MPC decided to keep the rate at 10.5% at the session on January 26, 2026. They include survey data and expert commentary, and although opinions are present, they are based on surveillance of incoming economic data (inflation, treasury yields, remittance inflows).
 • The integrated Agent report is highly detailed, including a comprehensive meeting-by-meeting history from 2020 through the January 2026 meeting, inflation trends, IMF programme considerations, and the forward guidance from the January 26 Monetary Policy Statement. It is detailed and based on primary documents and reliable press reports. Its clear description of the factors (moderate inflation expectations within 5–7%, liquidity moves, and stable macro fundamentals) underlines a bias toward a soft stance with only limited intervention expected in the near-term.

2. Reference class analysis:
 Potential reference classes include:
  – Historical SBP policy rate adjustments during disinflation-led easing cycles (as seen in the 2024–2025 cycle).
  – Emerging market central banks with similar macro conditions and IMF programmes.
  – Recent forward guidance patterns in Pakistan as documented in the January 2026 statement.
 The most suitable class is the recent cycle, as detailed in the Agent report: after an aggressive easing cycle leading to 10.5%, the MPC’s January 26 decision to hold with explicit forward guidance to “support growth” and maintain a sufficiently positive real rate suggests only modest moves are anticipated over the next three months.

3. Timeframe analysis:
 The target resolution is May 1, 2026, which is approximately 95 days (or about three months) after the January 26 decision. Historically, after a series of aggressive cuts (ending in late 2025), the MPC’s subsequent meetings have tended to make only moderate adjustments unless external shocks occur. In the present cycle, with inflation projected to remain inside a 5–7% band and macro fundamentals appearing stable, extreme moves (either large cuts or hikes) over this short horizon seem unlikely.

4. Justification:
 Combining the information from the reliable January 26 sources and detailed historical context, the current policy rate stands at 10.5%. The forward guidance in the January 26 Monetary Policy Statement suggests that, if macro data remain broadly in line with expectations (target inflation, moderate GDP growth, stable external conditions), there is little need for aggressive rate changes over the next three months. However, inherent uncertainties (such as potential volatility in global commodity prices, domestic shocks, or fluctuations in inflation when the base effect washes out) mean that small adjustments—either a slight cut or a modest hike—cannot be ruled out.
 Thus, the forecasting challenge is to provide a calibrated probability distribution that reflects modest variation around the current 10.5%, with a relatively narrow 90/10 interval reflecting the predictable central path but allowing for the “unknown unknowns” of an emerging market environment.

Outside view calibration:
 (a) Our distribution aims to represent the full uncertainty over a three‐month horizon, with probabilities reflecting modest changes. We tether our distribution to the historical pattern observed in the current disinflation cycle and the recent MPC communications.
 (b) Given the typical error rate and the fact that policy decisions are relatively well‐anchored by forward guidance in Pakistan’s current environment, we expect only small deviations from 10.5%.
 (c) A 90/10 interval is appropriate given the main risk factors; the tails represent scenarios where either external shocks force an unexpected cut (around 10.0%) or inflationary pressures force a modest hike (up to around 11.25%).
 (d) Historically in this domain, upsets are infrequent over a three‐month window when forward guidance is explicit, so the distribution is relatively narrow.
