Analysis:
We start from the most recent SBP decision (January 26, 2026) when the policy rate was held at 10.5%. Several reputable sources (Express Tribune, Nation, and internal SBP guidance) confirm that over the last few meetings the SBP has cut rates gradually in an easing cycle that began in mid‐2024 and that the latest decision was a hold. The SBP’s official guidance (real policy rate “adequately positive” with an inflation target of 5–7%) and the constraints imposed by the IMF program indicate there isn’t room for large further cuts. Historical reference shows that when rates near neutral (roughly 6–8%) the pace of cuts slows markedly. Given that only one to two MPC meetings lie between today (January 30, 2026) and the resolution date (May 1, 2026) – each likely to offer a cut in the range of 25 bps if an easing event happens – the most plausible outcomes are: a hold (at 10.5%), one cut (approximately 10.25%), or a double cut (around 10.0%). In our reference class this three‐month period during an easing cycle has witnessed modest moves (0–100 bps total), and we weight the probabilities roughly as 30% for no change, 50% for one 25–50 bps cut, and 20% for two cuts.

Source analysis:
• The Express Tribune and Nation articles (from late 2025 and early January 2026) provide firm data on the 10.5% rate and include pre‐decision surveys (although opinions vary, they are less weighty than the SBP’s own communication).
• Internal SBP guidance and official statements (cited in recent agent reports) are high‐quality evidence that mention inflation projections and discuss a “real policy rate” that supports only modest cuts.
• Historical data on previous easing cycles in Pakistan show a consistent pattern of gradually reducing the rate as it nears the neutral level.
Thus, strong evidence (multiple reliable, dated sources and structural constraints from the IMF program) supports a modest move.

Evidence analysis:
– Strong evidence: SBP’s explicit communication (“real policy rate is adequately positive”) plus IMF program conditions.
– Moderate evidence: Historical rates during easing cycles and external surveys suggesting a bias toward a 25 bps cut.
– Weak evidence: Anecdotal opinions of some business leaders (calling for larger cuts) are not adopted because they are not backed by official policy or structural constraints.

Timeframe analysis:
We are forecasting the policy rate in effect at 11:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2026 – approximately 91 days from today (January 30, 2026). In a shorter timeframe (say, half as long) one might expect less room for any cut, while a doubled horizon would allow for further easing. However, given the near‐term guidance and the scheduled MPC meetings (likely only two meetings remain), any further movement is expected to be small (0–2 cuts).

Justification:
The combination of a recent hold at 10.5%, the gradual deceleration of rate cuts as the neutral rate is approached, and the constraints imposed by the inflation outlook (5–7%) and IMF conditions indicate that any move by May 1, 2026 is likely to be modest. Our outside view reference class (recent easing cycles in Pakistan under similar circumstances) supports a scenario featuring either a hold or a single 25–50 bps cut—a probability-weighted mean around 10.25%. Tail risks include an unlikely aggressive easing (e.g. two 50 bps cuts, pushing the rate to 9.5%) or a reversal if inflation fails to decelerate (holding at 10.5% or even a potential increase, though the latter is very unlikely given current guidance).

Probability calibration:
We assign roughly a 30% chance for no change (10.5%), about a 50% chance for one cut (bringing the rate to about 10.25%), and around a 20% chance for two modest cuts (bringing the rate to about 10.0%). Allowing for tail events, we set a wide 90/10 range from 9.5% to 11.0%.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: SBP target policy rate (in percent) at 11:59 PM UTC May 1, 2026.
2. Outside view base rate: Recent easing cycle in Pakistan showing 0–100 bps changes over similar 3‐month periods.
3. Consistency check: Implied median ≈10.25%; mean ≈10.28%—consistent with gradual easing from 10.5%.
4. Top evidence: SBP’s official guidance, historical pace of cuts, and IMF structural constraints.
5. Blind-spot: A significant inflation shock forcing either a hold or larger cut—this would shift the outcome upward if rates are held or downward if more aggressive easing were required.
