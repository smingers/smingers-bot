Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
a. Express Tribune (26 Jan 2026): Factual report of the latest MPC decision – rate held at 10.5 %.  Inflation, reserves, current-account, and forward guidance are quoted from the official Monetary Policy Statement (MPS).  High quality; no speculation.  
b. Pakbanker (29 Jan 2026): Desk note summarising S&P and SBP macro projections (growth 3.5-4.5 %, inflation 5-7 %).  Reliable for the projections but contains no direct rate call.  Moderate value.  
c. Nerdherd (23 Jan 2026): Brokerage outlook (Topline Securities) that “gradual rate cuts by mid-2026” are possible.  Identifiable source but clearly opinion.  Weak-to-moderate.  
d. Express Tribune (15 Sep 2025) & (29 Jul 2025): Historical rate holds at 11 % and political pressure for deeper cuts.  Useful only for pattern recognition; otherwise dated.  
e. SBP primary documents (January-2026 MPS, referenced in a., online): definitive statement that the real policy rate is already “adequately positive” and that the next review is in 6-7 weeks.  Highest quality.  
f. All other Asknews articles are about other countries’ central banks and provide only background on the global rate environment (weak evidence for Pakistan).

2. Evidence analysis (strength in brackets)  
• Current policy rate is 10.5 % with explicit SBP guidance that stance is “appropriate” (strong).  
• Headline CPI has slipped to 5.6 % and SBP forecasts 5-7 % through FY 26, leaving a real rate of about +5 pp (strong).  
• Market surveys before the Jan-26 meeting showed a majority expected a 50-75 bp cut, yet the MPC opted to pause (moderate, suggests Committee caution).  
• Business lobbies continue to demand aggressive easing (weak—they have demanded this for 18 months with little impact).  
• External position improving: reserves 16.1 bn USD, CAD 0-1 % GDP (moderate, reduces hike risk).  
Net read-through: the Committee is biased to ease eventually, but its revealed preference is gradualism.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution ≈ 92 (three MPC meetings likely: early Mar, mid-Apr, late May/early Jun).  Only the first two can affect the 1 May fix.  Halving the horizon (46 d) would almost rule out more than one small move; doubling it would add a third meeting and widen the low-tail probabilities.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view baseline = “rate stays where it is” because over any random 3-month window in the last 10 years SBP has changed the policy rate only 35 % of the time, usually ±25-75 bp.  
Inside-view factors shifting down:  
• Core/headline inflation now comfortably inside target; external balances benign.  
• Political and corporate pressure to lower borrowing costs before the FY 27 budget.  
Inside-view factors pushing up/holding:  
• SBP has just surprised dovishly-positioned markets by pausing; it signalled that the real rate is already sufficiently positive.  
• Near-term food-price risks (late-winter wheat procurement) and exchange-rate drift could momentarily lift CPI, making a big cut imprudent.  
Net effect: modest easing bias, but a one-step 50 bp cut by April is the modal case; anything larger needs a second consecutive cut and therefore carries lower odds.  A surprise hike is only credible if the rupee comes under sudden pressure.

Probability calibration

a. Status-quo if trend continues: 10.5 %.  
b. 90/10 interval kept deliberately wide (8.5–11.5 %) for emerging-market shock risk.  
c. Mean = 10.3 %, median ≈ 10.25 %; matches narrative of a small tilt toward easing.

Checklist:
1. Target: SBP policy rate (%) in force 1 May 2026 23:59 UTC.  
2. Outside view base rate = 10.5 %.  
3. Implied median = 10.25 %, mean = 10.3 % – consistent with “one small cut most likely”.  
4. Key evidence: a) Jan-26 hold at 10.5 %. b) Inflation 5.6 % within 5-7 % target. c) SBP guidance: real rate already positive. d) Market had expected a cut but was over-ruled.  
5. Blind-spot: sharp PKR depreciation before March forcing an emergency hike (+).
