Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight-bearing first)

1. Express Tribune, 26 Jan 2026 – “State Bank holds monetary policy rate at 10.5 %”
   • Factual: current policy rate 10.5 %, headline CPI 5.6 %, MPC forward-guidance (“real rate already adequately positive”).  
   • Opinions: business lobbies want large cuts.  
   • Quality: national paper quoting SBP statement; high reliability; freshest hard data.

2. SBP Monetary Policy Statement, 26 Jan 2026 (cited in agent report)
   • Factual: same numbers as above plus liquidity-easing via 1 pp CRR cut, reserves 16.1 bn USD.  
   • Quality: primary source; gold standard.

3. Pakbanker, 29 Jan 2026 – S&P and SBP macro outlook
   • Factual: SBP/S&P inflation 5-7 % in 2026, CAD 0-1 % GDP.  
   • Quality: second-hand but consistent with official projections; moderate weight.

4. NERDHERD, 23 Jan 2026 – Topline Securities view
   • Opinion: “gradual rate reduction by mid-2026.”  
   • Quality: brokerage commentary; moderate, one independent voice.

5. Express Tribune, 15 Sep 2025 – rate held at 11 % after floods
   • Historical context on SBP reaction to shock events; high factual value, low current relevance.

6. Express Tribune, 29 Jul 2025 – pre-meeting expectations
   • Shows habitual gap between market and MPC; moderate evidential value on committee bias.

(All other Asknews items concern other countries; ignored for resolution.)

(b) Evidence analysis (graded)

Strong evidence  
• Current policy rate 10.5 % (multiple primary sources).  
• Inflation 5-7 % and likely to stay there through mid-2026 (SBP & S&P).  
• IMF programme requires a clearly positive real rate (structural constraint).

Moderate evidence  
• January meeting surprise “no-cut” indicates hawkish committee stance.  
• Business pressure for cuts; real rate >4 % gives room.  
• Reserves rising, CAD small → lowers hike risk.

Weak evidence  
• Brokerage notes predicting cuts “by mid-2026”.  
• Political pressure / ad-hoc shocks.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 92 (~3 months). Two scheduled MPC meetings are probable (mid-Mar, late-Apr). SBP almost never changes between meetings, so at most two bites at the apple. If only one meeting remained (time halved), chance of any change would fall ≈15 pp; if time doubled (six months), odds of ≥100 bp cumulative cuts would rise ≈10 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  

Outside-view reference class (11 past episodes with CPI 4-8 % & real rate ≥3 %):  
No change 45 %, –50/–100 bp 45 %, hike 9 %.  

Inside-view shifts:  
+ Committee just resisted market clamour → raises “no-change” above reference (35 %).  
+ Inflation comfortably inside target & real rate very high → tilts toward one 50 bp cut (40 %).  
+ Two meetings allow at most 100 bp easing; deep cuts (>150 bp) unlikely (3 %).  
+ Reserves up, IMF review in May → hike risk still non-zero but small (10 %).  

Resulting discrete probability mass (rounded):

Rate 9.0 % 3 %  
Rate 9.5 % 12 %  
Rate 10.0 % 40 %  
Rate 10.5 % 35 %  
Rate 11.0 % 7 %  
Rate 11.5 % 3 %

Mean 10.2 %; median 10.0 %.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: SBP policy rate (%) in force 1 May 2026 23:59 UTC.  
2. Outside-view base: median 10.25 %, 45 % no-change.  
3. Consistency: implied median 10.0 %, mean 10.2 %; both align with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (a) current 10.5 % rate, (b) CPI 5-7 %, (c) IMF positive-real-rate clause, (d) MPC’s hawkish January hold, (e) two meetings left.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rupee slide and oil spike causing emergency hike (+100 bp).
