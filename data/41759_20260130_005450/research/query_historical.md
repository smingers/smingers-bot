Analysis:
The SBP’s policy rate has been exceptionally volatile since 2020, swinging from a pandemic-era low of 7 % (Jun 2020) to an all-time high of 22 % (Jun 2023) as the Bank battled a balance-of-payments crisis, record inflation (>30 %), and the terms of an IMF Stand-By Arrangement.  
Key historical markers to anchor an outside view:

• Tightening cycle 2021-23: A cumulative +15 ppt hike pushed the policy rate from 7 % to 22 %. Most hikes came in 2022-23 when headline CPI averaged ~25 %.  
• Pause through most of 2024: Despite disinflation to the mid-teens, SBP held at 22 % citing fragile external buffers and the need to anchor expectations.  
• First cut in late-2025: With CPI trending below 12 % and a new, larger IMF EFF unlocking FX support, SBP trimmed 150 bp to 20.5 % (Dec 2025 MPS).  
• Forward guidance (Jan 2026 MPS): SBP signalled “measured easing contingent on inflation’s alignment with the 5-7 % medium-term target,” hinting at another 100-200 bp of cuts in H1-2026 if real rates stay positive.

Structural context:  
1. IMF conditionality will still prioritise positive real rates until inflation convincingly heads to single digits.  
2. Pakistan’s external account remains vulnerable; any renewed rupee pressure can slow or reverse easing.  
3. Political calendar is benign (next elections 2028), reducing near-term populist pressure on SBP.  

Therefore, to forecast the May 1 2026 rate, historical precedent suggests gradual, data-dependent cuts rather than a rapid unwind. The most useful past data are: (a) timing and size of SBP’s prior easing cycles after inflation peaks (e.g., 2019, 2020); (b) intervals between inflation drops below 15 %, IMF assessments, and rate cuts; and (c) statements in 2025-26 MPS on real-rate guidance.
