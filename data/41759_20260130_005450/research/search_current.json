Headline inflation eased to **5.6% in December 2025** from 6.1% in November.\n\n3. **Economic Growth:** \n   - Real GDP growth was provisionally reported at **3.7% for Q1** of the current fiscal year\n   - Economic growth projected to range between **3.75-4.75%** for the current fiscal year\n   - Growth driven mainly by industry and agriculture sectors\n\n4. **Current Account:**\n   - Current account deficit stood at **$244 million in December 2025**\n   - Total of **$1.2 billion in the first half** of the current fiscal year\n   - Supported by higher remittances and ICT exports\n\n5. **Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Stand at **$16.1 billion** and expected to exceed **$18 billion by June**\n\n6. **Private Sector Credit:** Net borrowing increased by **Rs 578 billion**, reflecting improved business confidence\n\n7. **Fiscal Performance:** FBR revenue in December rose by **7.3%** but fell short of target, creating a shortfall of **Rs 329 billion**\n\n8. **Other Adjustments:** The SBP reduced the rate for banks to deposit cash by 1%, setting it at **5%**\n\n## Market Expectations (Pre-Decision):\n\nAccording to an Arif Habib Limited pre-Monetary Policy Statement survey:\n- **43.5%** of participants expected a 75 basis points cut\n- **39.1%** anticipated a 50 bps reduction\n- Only **17.4%** expected no change\n\nThis indicated broad market consensus favored a rate cut.\n\n## Industry/Business Community Opinions:\n\n**Atif Ikram Sheikh (FPCCI President):** Described the decision as \"counterproductive and strictly disappointing.\" The business community had demanded a **350 bps cut to bring the policy rate to 7%**. Argued that core inflation had stabilized around 5% for several months and that high borrowing costs are driving industrial closures.\n\n**Saquib Fayyaz Magoon (FPCCI Senior Vice President):** Stated that with inflation around 5.6%, the policy rate should ideally fall between **7.6-9.6%** under standard global benchmarks.\n\n**Various Industry Associations:** Multiple trade bodies (Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry, SITE Association of Industry) expressed disappointment, arguing the decision was disconnected from economic realities and detrimental to industrial revival and export competitiveness.\n\n## SBP's Rationale:\n\nThe MPC assessed the \"real policy rate to be adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5-7% over the medium term.\" The decision aimed to ensure price stability and support sustainable economic growth, with the committee noting that outlooks for inflation and current account were broadly unchanged while economic growth outlook had improved significantly.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://pakbanker.com/pakistan-economic-outlook-2026-27-moderate-growth-controlled-inflation-and-stable-external-balances/\">\n# Article Summary: Pakistan Economic Outlook 2026\u201327\n\n**Source:** Pakbanker  \n**Date:** January 29, 2026  \n**Author:** webdesk\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Inflation Projections:\n- **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** Projects Pakistan's inflation will moderate to **5.1% in 2026**, with a slight increase to **5.6% in 2027**\n- **State Bank of Pakistan (SBP):** Expects inflation to stay within a **5\u20137% range** over the same period\n\n### Current Account Deficit:\n- **S&P:** Projects a current account deficit of **0.5% of GDP in 2026**, widening to **1.3% in 2027**\n- **SBP:** Anticipates a more conservative range of **0\u20131% of GDP for FY 26**\n\n### GDP Growth:\n- **S&P:** Forecasts real GDP growth of **3.5% in FY 26**, strengthening to **4.4% in FY 27**\n- **SBP:** Projects a slightly broader range of **3.75\u20134.75% for FY 26**\n\n## Key Contextual Information:\n\nThe article describes Pakistan's economic outlook as stable and moderate, with both S&P Global Market Intelligence and the State Bank of Pakistan providing projections indicating:\n- Controlled inflationary pressures\n- Manageable external balances\n- Resilient economic growth\n\nFactors supporting this growth include domestic consumption, ongoing structural reforms, and gradual improvements in external trade dynamics.\n\n## Note on Relevance to Question:\n\n**Important:** This article does **not** provide information about the State Bank of Pakistan's target policy rate (also known as the Policy Rate).

Key factors expected to pressure the ruble include stagnating export revenues due to lower oil prices, gradual recovery of imports after a prolonged pause, a reduction in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange sales linked to the National Wealth Fund (NWF) operations, and a decline in the key interest rate. The analysts noted that forecasting the ruble's movement in the current 'new reality' remains highly complex, with risks skewed toward a stronger ruble under the baseline scenario. SberCIB revised its 2026 dollar forecast downward by \u20bd10 due to improved geopolitical conditions and export volume projections, now expecting the dollar to reach \u20bd80 in February and \u20bd90 by year-end, with the yuan at \u20bd13.2. Four scenarios were outlined based on combinations of external conditions (positive or challenging) and domestic policy (softening or conservative). In the most optimistic case (positive external, soft domestic policy), the dollar is expected to reach \u20bd99. In a negative external, soft domestic policy scenario, the rate would be \u20bd94.5. A positive external, conservative domestic policy scenario leads to \u20bd96. The most pessimistic scenario (negative external, conservative domestic policy) projects a strong ruble at \u20bd84.

Market consensus remains unchanged on two rate cuts for 2026, despite Fed Chair Powell\u2019s more hawkish tone, due to the upcoming May 2026 appointment of a new Fed Chair. Max Stainton of Fidelity International anticipates no further rate cuts under Powell\u2019s remaining tenure, as the Fed perceives a balanced risk between inflation and labor market conditions. However, he forecasts three rate cuts in the second half of 2026, driven by the new Chair\u2019s likely dovish stance. Stainton also emphasizes the importance of Fed independence amid political scrutiny, including a DOJ subpoena and the Lisa Cook case before the Supreme Court. He recommends a global balanced strategy incorporating alternative assets and commodities amid expected rate cuts. Lin Cheong-Kit of Charles Schwab HK highlights that the Fed\u2019s data-driven policy remains intact, with inflation cooling to 2.7% in December 2025 and unemployment stable at 4.4%, but no significant shifts in labor or inflation are expected to trigger rate changes before May 2026. He stresses that Fed independence is as critical as the interest rate path for market confidence. Jean Boivin of BlackRock Institute identifies three key points: the Fed\u2019s hawkish statement (removing mention of downside employment risks), continued expectation of two 0.25% cuts in 2026 (with first cut likely in July), and the potential for the new Chair to override current policy signals. Ray Sharma-Ong of Aberdeen Standard expects no rate cuts under Powell, but a more dovish path under the new Chair, influenced by weakening labor market indicators and expectations of a Trump-appointed dovish nominee. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to a strong dollar and ruled out foreign exchange intervention to support the yen. Daniel Siluk of Janus Henderson noted the Fed\u2019s confidence in labor market stability and economic resilience, despite inflation being 'slightly elevated,' with a data-driven, patient approach prevailing. Morgan Stanley Asia-Pacific Chief Market Strategist Hsu Cheung-tai expects the Fed to hold rates steady through at least the first half of 2026, citing uncertainty around the transitory nature of tariff-driven inflation. He also notes that strong earnings from U.S. tech firms and a depreciating dollar could boost capital flows into Asia, supporting equities and fixed income markets in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:55 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/4076662/%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%AF%E8%B5%B0%E5%8B%A2%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%8C%E9%81%94%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E7%B1%B2%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E5%8C%85%E5%90%AB%E5%8F%A6%E9%A1%9E%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E5%8E%9F%E7%89%A9%E6%96%99%E7%9A%84%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%B9%B3%E8%A1%A1%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E3%80%80%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E7%9C%8B%E6%B8%85%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E5%B0%8D%E8%81%AF%E5%84%B2%E5%B1%80%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E8%B5%B0%E5%90%91%E8%A8%80%E8%AB%96%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8D%E6%96%B7%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%EF%BC%89)\n\n**BC: IPCA 12M projection for Q3 2027 remains at 3.2% amid elevated inflation risks**\nOn January 28, 2026, the Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) unanimously maintained the Selic interest rate at 15.0%. This decision was expected by 36 out of 37 institutions surveyed by Proje\u00e7\u00f5es Broadcast, a real-time news system of Grupo Estado. The committee cited elevated risks to inflation, both upward and downward, as the primary justification. Upward risks include prolonged inflation expectation derailing, stronger-than-expected resilience in service inflation due to a more positive output gap, and a combination of external and internal economic policies leading to greater inflationary impact\u2014such as a persistently depreciated exchange rate. Downward risks include a sharper-than-projected domestic economic slowdown, a more pronounced global slowdown due to trade shocks and heightened uncertainty, and a decline in commodity prices with disinflationary effects. The exchange rate used in the committee\u2019s projections remained at R$ 5.35. The median Focus projection for the 2026 IPCA inflation rate decreased from 4.16% to 4.00%, while the 2027 projection stayed at 3.80%. The Copom revised its projection for cumulative IPCA in 2026 from 3.5% to 3.4%. All projections are based on the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate, the Selic path embedded in the Focus report, and oil prices following the forward curve for about six months before increasing by 2% annually thereafter. In this reference scenario, the Copom adjusted its projection for free prices inflation in 2026 from 3.6% to 3.5% and kept it at 3.1% for the third quarter of 2027. The projection for administered prices decreased from 3.2% to 3.0% in 2026 and increased from 3.2% to 3.3% in the relevant horizon (Q3 2027).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 10:04 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/estadao-conteudo/2026/01/28/bc-projecao-de-ipca-12m-no-3-tri-de-2027-horizonte-relevante-segue-em-32.htm)\n\n**Budget expectations 2026: SBI Research sees fiscal discipline holding amid global churn, capex to stay growth anchor - The Times of India**\nSBI Research's pre-Budget assessment for Union Budget 2026-27 projects India will maintain macroeconomic stability despite a fragile global environment marked by geopolitical tensions, volatile financial markets, and a surge in commodity prices. The report forecasts nominal GDP growth of 10.5\u201311% for FY27, leading to a projected fiscal deficit of 4.2% of GDP, though it warns that the new GDP series could alter fiscal calculations. A slower nominal growth could pressure tax revenues, necessitating improved expenditure planning. The report suggests GST rationalization and potential reductions in marginal personal income tax rates to support the tax base. Central government net borrowing is expected at Rs 11.7 trillion with repayments of Rs 4.87 trillion, while state gross borrowings may rise to Rs 12.6 trillion with Rs 4.2 trillion in repayments. SBI Research emphasizes the need for increased OMOs by the RBI to manage liquidity as market borrowings grow. Over the next five fiscal years, gross market borrowing is estimated at Rs 93.8\u201395.2 lakh crore, averaging Rs 18\u201319 lakh crore annually\u2014significantly above current levels\u2014making alternative borrowing sources like small savings essential. Public capital expenditure is expected to exceed Rs 12 lakh crore in FY27, a 10% year-on-year increase, serving as a key growth anchor. While tax revenues are projected to grow modestly and non-tax revenues are expected to remain flat, sustained capex is seen as critical to sustaining domestic demand and crowding in private investment. The Centre\u2019s medium-term fiscal consolidation path aims to reduce central government debt-to-GDP from 57.1% in FY25 to 56.1% in FY26 and further to about 50% by March 2031, assuming no major external shocks. The report urges states to adopt scenario-based, medium-term debt-to-GSDP trajectories aligned with realistic growth and development needs, rather than relying solely on annual deficit targets. On taxation, it recommends tax parity between interest on deposits and capital gains, shorter lock-in periods for tax-saving fixed deposits, and a higher TDS threshold on savings account interest to boost household financial savings. It also calls for reforms in insurance and pensions, citing that 69% of IRDAI complaints in FY25 were related to claims, with delays in settlements. The report highlights a 93% protection gap in natural disaster coverage between 1991 and 2025, advocating for a public-private disaster risk pool. It further recommends transitioning to a risk-based capital framework in insurance, replacing static, formula-driven solvency margins with a dynamic, risk-aligned approach. Despite global turbulence, SBI Research reaffirms India as a bright spot due to strong macro fundamentals, with the challenge for Budget 2026-27 being to balance fiscal consolidation with growth imperatives in an uncertain global context.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-expectations-2026-sbi-research-sees-fiscal-discipline-holding-amid-global-churn-capex-to-stay-growth-anchor/articleshow/127709123.cms)\n\n**Agenda of the Day: Fed, Copom, and 2026 PAF Highlight Market Focus**\nThe economic agenda for Wednesday, January 28, 2026, centers on key monetary policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Brazil\u2019s Central Bank (BC), and the Bank of Canada, alongside critical domestic data releases. The Brazilian Central Bank (BC) will announce the weekly foreign exchange flow for the week ending January 23, 2026, reporting a net inflow of US$ 2.215 billion, driven by US$ 2.524 billion in financial account inflows and US$ 309 million in commercial outflows. The Secretariat of the National Treasury will release the December 2025 Public Debt Report and the 2026 Annual Financing Plan (PAF), with the Federal Public Debt (DPF) ending November 2025 at R$ 8.480 trillion\u2014up 2.75% from the previous month and above the PAF\u2019s projected range. The Central Bank of Brazil\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) will announce its decision on the Selic rate at 18:30, with 112 of 120 surveyed institutions expecting a hold at 15% until March 17, 2026, and 102 (85%) forecasting the start of rate cuts in the following meeting on March 18. The Bank of Canada is expected to maintain its interest rate at 2.25%. The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) will release weekly crude oil and gasoline stock data for the week ending January 23, 2026, showing a 3.602 million barrel increase in crude and a 5.977 million liter rise in gasoline inventories. The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its monetary policy decision at 16:00 (Bras\u00edlia time), with expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 16:30. Domestic indicators include the FGV\u2019s January 2026 Industrial Transformation Survey, with the Industrial Confidence Index (ICI) rising 3.8 points to 92.9 in December 2025, and the CNI\u2019s January 2026 Construction Industry Survey, showing a rise in expectations for new projects (51.1 from 49.2) and employment (51.0 from 49.8), signaling optimism for early 2026. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is in Panama for the Latin American Economic Forum, participating in official sessions, a visit to the Cocol\u00ed Locks, bilateral meetings, and receiving an honor, before returning to Bras\u00edlia by 23:55.

The focus is instead on whether Fed\u59d4\u5458's\u5206\u6b67 (divergence) has improved or worsened. Recent data\u2014such as the unemployment rate falling to 4.4%, continuing claims declining, and monthly personal consumption and real personal consumption growth at 0.5% and 0.3% respectively\u2014support holding rates steady to gain time for observation. Although the personal savings rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, suggesting consumption may be subsidized by savings, the overall economic picture justifies a pause. The market now prices in a potential rate cut only by July 2026. Looking ahead, the Fed\u2019s rate path is expected to enter a period of bidirectional but slightly bearish volatility by 2026, as fiscal and monetary policies appear to have limited room for expansion. The Fed\u2019s dual mandate\u2014balancing employment and inflation\u2014remains challenging: growth is solid but inflation has not clearly declined. This dynamic is central to the Fed\u2019s 2026 rate projections. The 2-year Treasury yield, currently at 3.6%, is historically neither high nor low\u2014close to the 40-year average of 3.7% (excluding the 1970s oil crisis era), but significantly below the 5.2% peak in 2023. This 'awkward' yield level is not attractive for investors: too high for risk appetite, too low to satisfy return needs. Historical returns from the MSCI World Index (developed markets) over 10, 15, 20, and 25 years average 9.1%, 8.9%, 7.5%, and 5.7% respectively\u2014outperforming short-term bond yields. Thus, diversified global asset allocation remains a viable strategy for superior returns, even without strong market outlooks.

According to the IMF report published by Tengrinews.kz, Kazakhstan's economy is projected to grow by 6.2% in 2025, up from approximately 5% in 2023\u20132024, driven by increased oil production, loose fiscal policy, expanded quasi-fiscal activities by state-owned companies, and rapid consumer credit growth. Inflation remains persistently high at 12\u201312.5%, more than double the National Bank\u2019s target. The IMF identifies key risks including high inflation, rising household debt from consumer lending, soft fiscal policy with large transfers from the National Fund, expansion of state company quasi-fiscal operations, and external uncertainty, particularly the potential decline in global oil prices. Despite tightening monetary policy, its impact is partially offset by excess liquidity and large government programs. The IMF notes clear signs of economic overheating, with strong domestic demand and external factors pushing inflation well above target. The current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4% of GDP in 2025 due to rising imports, fueled by investments and state support programs. The IMF recommends maintaining a tight monetary policy until inflation stabilizes, potentially raising the base rate, accelerating fiscal consolidation, reducing quasi-fiscal activities, limiting procyclical spending, and advancing structural reforms to reduce state involvement and boost the private sector. In the medium term, growth is forecast to slow to 3\u20133.5%, with inflation gradually declining and reaching the 5% target only by 2030. The National Bank of Kazakhstan maintained its base rate at 18% annually with a \u00b11 percentage point corridor, signaling it is likely to remain unchanged until the end of the first half of 2026. Kazakhstan remains the top performer in the CIS for real GDP growth, according to the IMF\u2019s October 2025 assessment.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:42 AM\nSource:[Tengrinews.kz](https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/mvf-predupredil-ob-ugroze-peregreva-ekonomiki-kazahstana-591310/)\n\n**Capital market firm projects strengthening of Pakistans macroeconomic outlook**\nS&P Global Market Intelligence has projected a strengthening of Pakistan's macroeconomic outlook for fiscal years 2026 (FY26) and 2027 (FY27), aligning with the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) estimates. Real GDP growth is forecast at 3.5% in FY26 and 4.4% in FY27, driven by stronger-than-expected momentum in commodity-producing sectors and spillover effects into services. This exceeds the International Monetary Fund's revised projection of 3.2% growth for 2025-26, down from its prior estimate of 3.6%. On the external front, the SBP projects the current account deficit to remain within 0-1% of GDP in FY26, with foreign exchange reserves expected to surpass USD 18 billion by June 2026 and approach three months of import cover in FY27. S&P projects a current account deficit of 0.5% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027, with risks noted due to 'elevated global tariff uncertainty, volatile commodity prices, and geopolitical fragmentation.' Inflation is expected to stabilize within the SBP's 5-7% target range over the next two years, after briefly exceeding the upper bound in 2026. S&P forecasts inflation at 5.1% in 2026 and 5.6% in 2027, with a caveat on downside risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:45 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/capital-market-firm-projects-strengthening-of-pakistans-macroeconomic-outlook-9860717.html)\n\n**T-Investments Identify 4 Scenarios for Dollar to Reach \u20bd95 by Year-End 2026**\nAnalysts at 'T-Investments' updated their 2026 outlook, forecasting a moderate weakening of the Russian ruble, with an average annual exchange rate of \u20bd90 for the dollar and a projected end-of-year rate of \u20bd95. Key factors expected to pressure the ruble include stagnating export revenues due to lower oil prices, gradual recovery of imports after a prolonged pause, a reduction in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange sales linked to the National Wealth Fund (NWF) operations, and a decline in the key interest rate. The analysts noted that forecasting the ruble's movement in the current 'new reality' remains highly complex, with risks skewed toward a stronger ruble under the baseline scenario. SberCIB revised its 2026 dollar forecast downward by \u20bd10 due to improved geopolitical conditions and export volume projections, now expecting the dollar to reach \u20bd80 in February and \u20bd90 by year-end, with the yuan at \u20bd13.2. Four scenarios were outlined based on combinations of external conditions (positive or challenging) and domestic policy (softening or conservative). In the most optimistic case (positive external, soft domestic policy), the dollar is expected to reach \u20bd99. In a negative external, soft domestic policy scenario, the rate would be \u20bd94.5. A positive external, conservative domestic policy scenario leads to \u20bd96. The most pessimistic scenario (negative external, conservative domestic policy) projects a strong ruble at \u20bd84.

Market consensus remains unchanged on two rate cuts for 2026, despite Fed Chair Powell\u2019s more hawkish tone, due to the upcoming May 2026 appointment of a new Fed Chair. Max Stainton of Fidelity International anticipates no further rate cuts under Powell\u2019s remaining tenure, as the Fed perceives a balanced risk between inflation and labor market conditions. However, he forecasts three rate cuts in the second half of 2026, driven by the new Chair\u2019s likely dovish stance. Stainton also emphasizes the importance of Fed independence amid political scrutiny, including a DOJ subpoena and the Lisa Cook case before the Supreme Court. He recommends a global balanced strategy incorporating alternative assets and commodities amid expected rate cuts. Lin Cheong-Kit of Charles Schwab HK highlights that the Fed\u2019s data-driven policy remains intact, with inflation cooling to 2.7% in December 2025 and unemployment stable at 4.4%, but no significant shifts in labor or inflation are expected to trigger rate changes before May 2026. He stresses that Fed independence is as critical as the interest rate path for market confidence. Jean Boivin of BlackRock Institute identifies three key points: the Fed\u2019s hawkish statement (removing mention of downside employment risks), continued expectation of two 0.25% cuts in 2026 (with first cut likely in July), and the potential for the new Chair to override current policy signals. Ray Sharma-Ong of Aberdeen Standard expects no rate cuts under Powell, but a more dovish path under the new Chair, influenced by weakening labor market indicators and expectations of a Trump-appointed dovish nominee. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to a strong dollar and ruled out foreign exchange intervention to support the yen. Daniel Siluk of Janus Henderson noted the Fed\u2019s confidence in labor market stability and economic resilience, despite inflation being 'slightly elevated,' with a data-driven, patient approach prevailing. Morgan Stanley Asia-Pacific Chief Market Strategist Hsu Cheung-tai expects the Fed to hold rates steady through at least the first half of 2026, citing uncertainty around the transitory nature of tariff-driven inflation. He also notes that strong earnings from U.S. tech firms and a depreciating dollar could boost capital flows into Asia, supporting equities and fixed income markets in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:55 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/4076662/%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%AF%E8%B5%B0%E5%8B%A2%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%8C%E9%81%94%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E7%B1%B2%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E5%8C%85%E5%90%AB%E5%8F%A6%E9%A1%9E%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E5%8E%9F%E7%89%A9%E6%96%99%E7%9A%84%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%B9%B3%E8%A1%A1%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E3%80%80%E4%B8%80%E6%96%87%E7%9C%8B%E6%B8%85%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E5%B0%8D%E8%81%AF%E5%84%B2%E5%B1%80%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E8%B5%B0%E5%90%91%E8%A8%80%E8%AB%96%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8D%E6%96%B7%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%EF%BC%89)\n\n**BC: IPCA 12M projection for Q3 2027 remains at 3.2% amid elevated inflation risks**\nOn January 28, 2026, the Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) unanimously maintained the Selic interest rate at 15.0%. This decision was expected by 36 out of 37 institutions surveyed by Proje\u00e7\u00f5es Broadcast, a real-time news system of Grupo Estado. The committee cited elevated risks to inflation, both upward and downward, as the primary justification. Upward risks include prolonged inflation expectation derailing, stronger-than-expected resilience in service inflation due to a more positive output gap, and a combination of external and internal economic policies leading to greater inflationary impact\u2014such as a persistently depreciated exchange rate. Downward risks include a sharper-than-projected domestic economic slowdown, a more pronounced global slowdown due to trade shocks and heightened uncertainty, and a decline in commodity prices with disinflationary effects. The exchange rate used in the committee\u2019s projections remained at R$ 5.35. The median Focus projection for the 2026 IPCA inflation rate decreased from 4.16% to 4.00%, while the 2027 projection stayed at 3.80%. The Copom revised its projection for cumulative IPCA in 2026 from 3.5% to 3.4%. All projections are based on the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate, the Selic path embedded in the Focus report, and oil prices following the forward curve for about six months before increasing by 2% annually thereafter. In this reference scenario, the Copom adjusted its projection for free prices inflation in 2026 from 3.6% to 3.5% and kept it at 3.1% for the third quarter of 2027. The projection for administered prices decreased from 3.2% to 3.0% in 2026 and increased from 3.2% to 3.3% in the relevant horizon (Q3 2027).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 10:04 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/estadao-conteudo/2026/01/28/bc-projecao-de-ipca-12m-no-3-tri-de-2027-horizonte-relevante-segue-em-32.htm)\n\n**BC Maintains Selic Rate at 15% but Signals March Cuts**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) maintained the benchmark interest rate (Selic) at 15.00% per year during its meeting on January 28, 2026, marking the fifth consecutive meeting with no change. The committee stated that the current strategy of keeping interest rates at this level for an extended period remains appropriate to ensure inflation converges to its target. Copom anticipates beginning monetary policy easing in its next meeting on March 17\u201318, 2026, but emphasized it will maintain restrictive measures as needed to ensure inflation convergence. A survey by Valor Econ\u00f4mico, which polled 120 financial institutions, found that 112 expected no rate change, while only 8 anticipated a cut\u20145 expecting a 0.25 percentage point reduction and 3 a 0.50 point reduction. Market data from January 27 showed the probability of a 0.25-point cut rising from 15% to 23%, while the likelihood of a 0.50-point cut remained at 1%. Inflation indicators continue to show moderation, but remain above target. Inflation expectations for 2026 and 2027 from the Focus survey remain at 4.0% and 3.8%, respectively, while Copom\u2019s projection for the third quarter of 2027 is 3.2% in the reference scenario. Risks to inflation remain elevated, including upside risks such as prolonged inflation expectation de-anchoring, stronger-than-expected service inflation due to a positive output gap, and adverse domestic and foreign policy combinations. Downside risks include a sharper-than-expected domestic economic slowdown, a more pronounced global slowdown from trade shocks, and falling commodity prices. The committee stressed ongoing caution due to geopolitical tensions, uncertain external conditions, and domestic fiscal policy impacts. The current environment is characterized by de-anchored expectations, elevated inflation forecasts, economic resilience, and labor market pressures. The decision to maintain the rate is deemed compatible with the goal of price stability and supports economic activity stabilization and full employment. The committee reaffirmed that the current strategy is appropriate, and that any future easing will depend on evolving data and confidence in achieving the inflation target over the relevant policy horizon.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:31 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/financas/noticia/2026/01/28/bc-mantem-taxa-selic-em-15percent-pela-quinta-vez.ghtml)\n\n**Budget expectations 2026: SBI Research sees fiscal discipline holding amid global churn, capex to stay growth anchor - The Times of India**\nSBI Research's pre-Budget assessment for Union Budget 2026-27 projects India will maintain macroeconomic stability despite a fragile global environment marked by geopolitical tensions, volatile financial markets, and a surge in commodity prices. The report forecasts nominal GDP growth of 10.5\u201311% for FY27, leading to a projected fiscal deficit of 4.2% of GDP, though it warns that the new GDP series could alter fiscal calculations. A slower nominal growth could pressure tax revenues, necessitating improved expenditure planning. The report suggests GST rationalization and potential reductions in marginal personal income tax rates to support the tax base. Central government net borrowing is expected at Rs 11.7 trillion with repayments of Rs 4.87 trillion, while state gross borrowings may rise to Rs 12.6 trillion with Rs 4.2 trillion in repayments. SBI Research emphasizes the need for increased OMOs by the RBI to manage liquidity as market borrowings grow. Over the next five fiscal years, gross market borrowing is estimated at Rs 93.8\u201395.2 lakh crore, averaging Rs 18\u201319 lakh crore annually\u2014significantly above current levels\u2014making alternative borrowing sources like small savings essential. Public capital expenditure is expected to exceed Rs 12 lakh crore in FY27, a 10% year-on-year increase, serving as a key growth anchor. While tax revenues are projected to grow modestly and non-tax revenues are expected to remain flat, sustained capex is seen as critical to sustaining domestic demand and crowding in private investment. The Centre\u2019s medium-term fiscal consolidation path aims to reduce central government debt-to-GDP from 57.1% in FY25 to 56.1% in FY26 and further to about 50% by March 2031, assuming no major external shocks. The report urges states to adopt scenario-based, medium-term debt-to-GSDP trajectories aligned with realistic growth and development needs, rather than relying solely on annual deficit targets. On taxation, it recommends tax parity between interest on deposits and capital gains, shorter lock-in periods for tax-saving fixed deposits, and a higher TDS threshold on savings account interest to boost household financial savings. It also calls for reforms in insurance and pensions, citing that 69% of IRDAI complaints in FY25 were related to claims, with delays in settlements. The report highlights a 93% protection gap in natural disaster coverage between 1991 and 2025, advocating for a public-private disaster risk pool. It further recommends transitioning to a risk-based capital framework in insurance, replacing static, formula-driven solvency margins with a dynamic, risk-aligned approach. Despite global turbulence, SBI Research reaffirms India as a bright spot due to strong macro fundamentals, with the challenge for Budget 2026-27 being to balance fiscal consolidation with growth imperatives in an uncertain global context.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-expectations-2026-sbi-research-sees-fiscal-discipline-holding-amid-global-churn-capex-to-stay-growth-anchor/articleshow/127709123.cms)\n\n**Agenda of the Day: Fed, Copom, and 2026 PAF Highlight Market Focus**\nThe economic agenda for Wednesday, January 28, 2026, centers on key monetary policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Brazil\u2019s Central Bank (BC), and the Bank of Canada, alongside critical domestic data releases. The Brazilian Central Bank (BC) will announce the weekly foreign exchange flow for the week ending January 23, 2026, reporting a net inflow of US$ 2.215 billion, driven by US$ 2.524 billion in financial account inflows and US$ 309 million in commercial outflows. The Secretariat of the National Treasury will release the December 2025 Public Debt Report and the 2026 Annual Financing Plan (PAF), with the Federal Public Debt (DPF) ending November 2025 at R$ 8.480 trillion\u2014up 2.75% from the previous month and above the PAF\u2019s projected range. The Central Bank of Brazil\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) will announce its decision on the Selic rate at 18:30, with 112 of 120 surveyed institutions expecting a hold at 15% until March 17, 2026, and 102 (85%) forecasting the start of rate cuts in the following meeting on March 18. The Bank of Canada is expected to maintain its interest rate at 2.25%. The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) will release weekly crude oil and gasoline stock data for the week ending January 23, 2026, showing a 3.602 million barrel increase in crude and a 5.977 million liter rise in gasoline inventories. The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its monetary policy decision at 16:00 (Bras\u00edlia time), with expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 16:30. Domestic indicators include the FGV\u2019s January 2026 Industrial Transformation Survey, with the Industrial Confidence Index (ICI) rising 3.8 points to 92.9 in December 2025, and the CNI\u2019s January 2026 Construction Industry Survey, showing a rise in expectations for new projects (51.1 from 49.2) and employment (51.0 from 49.8), signaling optimism for early 2026. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is in Panama for the Latin American Economic Forum, participating in official sessions, a visit to the Cocol\u00ed Locks, bilateral meetings, and receiving an honor, before returning to Bras\u00edlia by 23:55.

The focus is instead on whether Fed\u59d4\u5458's\u5206\u6b67 (divergence) has improved or worsened. Recent data\u2014such as the unemployment rate falling to 4.4%, continuing claims declining, and monthly personal consumption and real personal consumption growth at 0.5% and 0.3% respectively\u2014support holding rates steady to gain time for observation. Although the personal savings rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, suggesting consumption may be subsidized by savings, the overall economic picture justifies a pause. The market now prices in a potential rate cut only by July 2026. Looking ahead, the Fed\u2019s rate path is expected to enter a period of bidirectional but slightly bearish volatility by 2026, as fiscal and monetary policies appear to have limited room for expansion. The Fed\u2019s dual mandate\u2014balancing employment and inflation\u2014remains challenging: growth is solid but inflation has not clearly declined. This dynamic is central to the Fed\u2019s 2026 rate projections. The 2-year Treasury yield, currently at 3.6%, is historically neither high nor low\u2014close to the 40-year average of 3.7% (excluding the 1970s oil crisis era), but significantly below the 5.2% peak in 2023. This 'awkward' yield level is not attractive for investors: too high for risk appetite, too low to satisfy return needs. Historical returns from the MSCI World Index (developed markets) over 10, 15, 20, and 25 years average 9.1%, 8.9%, 7.5%, and 5.7% respectively\u2014outperforming short-term bond yields. Thus, diversified global asset allocation remains a viable strategy for superior returns, even without strong market outlooks. The article concludes that 2026 is still an appropriate time for global asset allocation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:53 AM\nSource:[wealth.hket.com](https://wealth.hket.com/article/4076155/%E7%BE%8E%E8%81%AF%E5%84%B2%E6%88%967%E6%9C%88%E6%89%8D%E6%B8%9B%E6%81%AF%E3%80%80%E8%A7%80%E5%AF%9F%E5%A7%94%E5%93%A1%E5%88%86%E6%AD%A7%E7%8B%80%E6%B3%81%E6%9B%B4%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81)\n\n**IMF Warns of Economic Overheating in Kazakhstan Amid High Inflation and Growth Risks**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of economic overheating in Kazakhstan, citing rising inflation and unsustainable growth trends.

This expectation aligns with federal funds futures pricing, indicating that both Wall Street professionals and economists do not believe the next Fed chair will fully comply with presidential demands for drastic rate cuts. The average forecast is for two 25-basis-point cuts in 2026, bringing the federal funds rate target range down to 3.0%\u20133.25%, where it is expected to remain through 2027. Since beginning his second term, Trump has consistently pressured current Fed Chair Powell to lower rates significantly, advocating for U.S. rates to be among the lowest globally and even suggesting a target of 1%. At an inflation rate of approximately 2%, this would imply negative real interest rates. Additionally, in January 2026, the U.S. consumer confidence index unexpectedly plummeted to its lowest level since May 2014, falling from a revised 94.2 to 84.5, below all economist forecasts. The decline in the forward-looking component reached its lowest level since April 2025, while the current conditions index hit a five-year low. This sharp drop in consumer confidence reinforced expectations of two rate cuts in 2026, leading to a decline in short-term Treasury yields and reigniting a steepening trend in the yield curve. The market is now caught in a dynamic between persistent inflation pressures, slowing job growth, and expectations of a monetary policy pivot, with the consumer confidence collapse becoming the key driver reversing recent bond market trends. On the currency front, the USD/JPY fell sharply to a 13-week low near 152.70, pressured by trade tensions, concerns over Fed independence, and growing expectations of Japanese intervention. The USD/CAD dropped below the 1.3600 level, hitting a six-month low near 1.3590, driven by a broad-based decline in the dollar index, which fell near a four-year low, and a surge in oil prices. Gold surged to a new all-time high near 5260, supported by a weak dollar, fears of a U.S. government shutdown, and ongoing trade tensions boosting safe-haven demand. Key upcoming data include Germany\u2019s February Gfk consumer confidence index, the U.S. September wholesale inventory final reading, Canada\u2019s central bank interest rate decision, and the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s rate announcement.

The IMF revised its 2025-26 growth forecast for India upward to 7.3%, aligning with the National Statistics Office's (NSO) advance estimate of 7.4% GDP growth. This upward revision is attributed to stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter and robust momentum in the fourth quarter of 2025. Inflation in India is expected to return to near-target levels in 2025 due to subdued food prices, consistent with RBI forecasts. Global GDP growth is projected at 3.3% for 2025, 2024, and 2026, with the US expected to grow at 2.1% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, and China at 5% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Despite stable growth projections, the IMF warns of downside risks, including a potential AI bubble. If expectations for AI-driven productivity gains are overly optimistic, a sharp decline in high-tech investment, reduced AI adoption spending, and a prolonged stock market correction\u2014particularly in tech-heavy markets\u2014could trigger negative wealth effects, reduce business dynamism, and lead to capital and labor reallocation costs. These shocks could spread globally through trade and tighter financial conditions. The report also highlights risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical developments, urging globally coordinated policies to enhance medium-term growth, including strengthening the EU single market, implementing credible fiscal consolidation in the US, and advancing structural reforms in China to improve social protection and reduce industrial policy distortions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 01:44 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-continue-to-be-fastest-growing-major-economy-imf-101768850903945.html)\n\n**IMF Expects Global Growth to Stabilize at 3.3% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2027 Amid Technology-Driven Momentum**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global economic growth to remain stable at 3.3% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2027, consistent with its earlier 2025 forecast of 3.3%. The IMF attributes this stability to a balance between negative headwinds\u2014such as shifting trade policies\u2014and strong positive drivers, particularly technology-driven investment, including artificial intelligence, especially in North America and Asia. Regional growth is expected to accelerate in the Middle East and Central Asia, rising from 3.7% in 2025 to 4.0% in 2027, fueled by higher oil production, strong domestic demand, and ongoing reforms. Global inflation is projected to decline gradually\u2014from 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027\u2014with the U.S. experiencing a slower convergence to target compared to other major economies. The IMF assumes that elevated tariffs will not be implemented beyond their expiration dates, maintaining the effective U.S. tariff rate at 18.5% (down slightly from 18.7% in October 2025), while the global average remains at 3.5%. Global trade volume is expected to dip to 2.6% in 2026 before rebounding to 3.1% in 2027, driven by pre-emptive trade adjustments and adaptation to new policies. The report warns that heightened geopolitical tensions\u2014especially in the Middle East, Ukraine, Asia, or Latin America\u2014could trigger widespread negative shocks through disrupted shipping, supply chains, and air travel. It also cautions that high fiscal deficits and large public debts could pressure long-term interest rates and financial conditions. Conversely, rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, supported by investments in physical and digital infrastructure, could boost productivity and raise global growth by up to 0.3 percentage points in 2026 and by 0.1 to 0.8 percentage points annually in the medium term, depending on adoption speed and global readiness. The IMF calls for clear policy focus on restoring fiscal space, ensuring price stability, financial stability, reducing uncertainty, and implementing structural reforms without delay. Central banks are urged to adapt policies to maintain price stability, with gradual interest rate reductions possible in countries where inflation is near target and risks remain under control, while caution is advised in countries with persistently high inflation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 09:38 AM\nSource:[Addustour newspaper (\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631)](https://www.addustour.com/articles/1542905)\n\n**IMF sees room for big rate cut**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts up to a 50-basis-point reduction in the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) policy rate by the first quarter of 2026, citing a favorable inflation outlook and emerging downside risks to growth. The IMF's baseline projection assumes another 50-bps cut, bringing the real interest rate toward the lower bound of its estimated natural rate range. With headline inflation below the midpoint of the 2\u20134% target band, inflation expectations anchored, and a projected negative output gap in 2025, the IMF deems the accommodative monetary stance appropriate. However, it stresses that policy must remain data-driven, with the BSP guided by new information on inflation, the output gap, and two-sided inflation risks. The IMF urges vigilance on financial conditions and liquidity risks, particularly when adjusting banks\u2019 reserve requirements. Clear communication is emphasized, with praise for the BSP\u2019s inclusion of alternative scenarios in its latest Monetary Policy Report. On exchange rates, the IMF supports the BSP\u2019s role as a shock absorber amid global volatility, noting that the exchange rate should continue to function flexibly. While foreign exchange intervention may be warranted in cases of sharp depreciation posing inflation risks, the IMF cautions against overuse due to the Philippines\u2019 occasionally shallow forex markets and the nonlinear impact of exchange rate swings on inflation expectations. Intervention should be temporary and not replace macroeconomic policy adjustments, especially given the country\u2019s weaker external position. Frequent intervention, the IMF warns, could hinder market development, create moral hazard, and undermine the inflation-targeting regime. Philippine authorities agree on the room for a more accommodative stance, citing weaker growth prospects\u2014partly due to governance concerns affecting infrastructure spending and business confidence\u2014and a benign inflation outlook. The BSP\u2019s Monetary Board reduced the target reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% at its December 11, 2025, meeting, marking the 200-basis-point easing since the cycle began in August 2024. The BSP maintains a data-dependent approach, continuously evaluating estimates and monitoring emerging risks. The authorities confirm that foreign exchange intervention remains limited to cases of sharp, large-scale depreciation that threaten inflation and inflation expectations, affirming that the forex market remains deep and liquid.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[philstar.com](https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/12/27/2496893/imf-sees-room-big-rate-cut)\n\n**IMF projects more BSP rate cuts in Q1 2026**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) may implement an additional 50 basis point reduction in its key overnight borrowing rate by the first quarter of 2026, bringing the rate down to 4.0 percent. This projection is based on a favorable inflation outlook, with inflation expected to return to the midpoint of the BSP\u2019s 2\u20134 percent target band. The IMF stated that such a move would push the real interest rate toward the lower bound of its estimated natural rate range. The fund emphasized that any decision should remain data-dependent, noting 'prevailing uncertainties around the output gap and the natural rate and two-sided risks to inflation.' It affirmed that the projected accommodative stance is appropriate given headline inflation below the target midpoint, anchored expectations, and an emerging negative output gap in 2025. The IMF also stressed the importance of clear and effective communication to manage market expectations. This outlook follows the BSP\u2019s recent 0.25 percentage point cut to 4.5 percent at its final policy meeting of 2025, part of a cumulative 200 basis point easing since August 2024. Governor Eli Remolona Jr. cautioned that further cuts, if any, would likely be limited to a single 0.25 percentage point reduction to avoid market concerns. The IMF also noted that local authorities see room for a more accommodative stance due to weaker growth prospects, partly driven by governance concerns affecting business confidence and infrastructure implementation, alongside a benign inflation outlook.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 26, 2025 06:41 PM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://business.inquirer.net/566451/imf-projects-more-bsp-rate-cuts-in-q1-2026)\n\n**IMF Outlines Optimistic Outlook for Turkey: Growth Forecast at 3.5% and Inflation Decline Expected**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that Turkey's economy is expected to grow by 3.5% by the end of the year, expressing optimism about inflation. According to the IMF, Turkey's economy will maintain strong growth in the near term, with inflation gradually declining. The Fund highlighted that the country's monetary policy framework has achieved significant progress, though challenging conditions persist due to the use of multiple policy tools, which have complicated the Turkish Central Bank's (TCMB) communication and influenced inflation expectations. The IMF noted that policymakers' commitment to maintaining growth while reducing inflation has yielded measurable results, including a gradual decline in inflation, increased confidence in the lira, and recovery in reserves. While risks remain high, they have decreased compared to the previous year. The TCMB's strategy of maintaining high real interest rates to limit financial risks and the narrowing budget deficit\u2014identified as a factor suppressing inflation\u2014were emphasized. However, the slow pace of disinflation has prolonged the economy's vulnerability to shocks from investor behavior, global risk appetite, or energy prices, increasing the costs and risks to stability. The IMF stressed the need for a more balanced and sustainable path, prioritizing stronger fiscal tightening, a stricter monetary policy, and cautious income policies. Although this approach may slow growth in the short term, it could enhance labor and product markets and protect vulnerable groups, ultimately boosting growth potential. The IMF cited indicators such as the narrowing budget deficit, disinflation, positive real interest rates, lira stability, growth outlook, improvement in the current account deficit, and reserve increases as evidence that 'cautious economic policies have achieved significant successes.' The Fund projected that GDP growth will remain strong and inflation will continue to decline gradually in the short term. It also forecasted that by 2026, policy interest rates would ease and looser fiscal policy would support domestic demand, lifting growth to 3.7%. Inflation is expected to reach around 33% by the end of 2025, with a gradual decline driven by moderate wage growth and disinflation, reducing inertia-driven pressure on prices. The IMF emphasized that additional policy steps are needed for inflation to align with TCMB targets and to enhance resilience to shocks. It recommended continuing this year's fiscal tightening, maintaining the importance of revenue-increasing measures and expenditure constraints. Despite the strong results of Turkey's monetary policy framework, the IMF noted that the use of multiple tools under difficult conditions has created communication challenges. It underscored the necessity of a clear policy framework focused on policy rates and higher real interest rates for the TCMB to achieve its inflation targets. The Fund also called for limiting excessive exchange rate volatility that could negatively affect inflation expectations. While financial sector resilience remains strong and authorities have demonstrated quick, decisive intervention capacity in market stress, close monitoring of foreign exchange liquidity risks and continued strengthening of regulatory frameworks are required.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 07:34 AM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/imf-turkiye-icin-buyume-beklentisini-acikladi-enflasyon-icin-iyimser-982093h.htm)\n\n**IMF warns of rising inflation, current account deficit**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of rising inflation and a widening current account deficit in Pakistan, projecting the country\u2019s CPI-based average inflation rate to rise from 4.5% in 2024 to 6% in 2025, and the current account balance to shift from a 0.5% surplus to a 0.4% deficit. These projections are described as tentative due to the unassessed impact of anticipated summer 2025 floods. Globally, the IMF forecasts world trade volume growth at 2.9% in 2025\u201326, below the 3.5% growth in 2024, due to persistent trade fragmentation. Advanced economies are expected to grow at 1.5% on average, with the United States slowing to 2%, while emerging market and developing economies are projected to moderate to just above 4%. Global inflation is forecast to decline to 4.2% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026. The IMF highlighted downside risks, including prolonged policy uncertainty, escalating protectionism (including non-tariff barriers), and restrictive immigration policies that could reduce growth, particularly in ageing economies. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial fragilities are expected to interact with rising borrowing costs, increasing rollover risks for sovereigns. The Fund urged member countries to address fiscal strains, citing lower growth, higher real interest rates, elevated debt, and new spending demands (e.g., defence). It warned that reduced official aid flows leave low-income countries especially vulnerable, with job shortages potentially fueling social unrest among youth. Central bank credibility is under pressure, and the IMF cautioned that loss of trust could undermine inflation expectations. It advised restoring confidence through predictable, transparent monetary policy focused on price stability, stabilizing trade, reducing uncertainty, and rebuilding fiscal space. Long-term recommendations include investing in innovation, productivity, multilateral cooperation, private enterprise, and broad-based policies such as education, infrastructure, and smart regulation over costly sectoral subsidies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 06:49 AM\nSource:[dawn.com](https://www.dawn.com/news/1948980/imf-warns-of-rising-inflation-current-account-deficit)\n\n**'IMF Raises Global Growth Outlook to 3.2% for 2025 Amid Shifting Monetary Policies and Regional Recovery'**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global economic growth forecasts in its October 2025 report, increasing the 2025 projection to 3.2% from 2.8% in its April 2025 spring assessment, and raising 2026 growth to 3.1%. The improvement reflects stronger outlooks for advanced economies (up 0.2% in 2025 and 0.1% in 2026) and emerging and developing economies (up 0.5% in 2025 and 0.1% in 2026). Growth is expected to reach 3.3% in 2024, 3.2% in 2025, and 3.1% in 2026, with global GDP growth at 2.6% in both 2025 and 2026, down from 2.8% in 2024. The IMF notes that these rates remain below the pre-pandemic average of 3.7%. The report identifies 2025 as a transitional phase marked by trade tensions, uncertainty, and divergent monetary policy paths among major economies. The U.S. is projected to grow at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, the Eurozone at 1.2% and 1.1%, Japan at 1.1% and 0.6%, China at 4.8% and 4.2%, and India at 6.6% and 6.2%. Inflation is expected to decline globally from 5.8% in 2024 to 4.2% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026, with advanced economies seeing 2.5% and 2.2%, and emerging markets at 5.3% and 4.7%. The U.S. federal funds rate is expected to fall to 3.5\u20133.75% by end-2025 and stabilize at 2.75\u20133% by 2028. The Eurozone rate is projected to stabilize near 2%, while Japan continues gradual rate hikes to 1.5% on average. Public debt is expected to rise in the U.S. from 122% of GDP in 2024 to 143% by 2030, and in the Eurozone from 87% to 92%. In emerging markets, debt is projected to increase from below 70% to 82% of GDP by 2030. Oil prices are forecast to decline from $79.17 in 2024 to $68.92 in 2025 and $65.84 in 2026. Non-oil commodity prices are expected to fall faster than previously projected due to lower food and beverage prices. Growth in the Middle East and North Africa is projected to rise from 2.1% in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026, driven by increased oil investment, economic recovery in importers, and stable energy prices. The broader Middle East and Central Asia region is expected to grow at 3.5% in 2025 and 3.8% in 2026 due to government investment and improved regional trade.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 03:27 PM\nSource:[Alwasat News](https://alwasat.ly/news/economy/494214)\n\n**IMF Projects Lower Growth and Higher Inflation for Argentina**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its economic projections for Argentina, forecasting annual inflation to reach 18%-23% by the end of 2024, up from a previous estimate of 28%\u2014aligning closely with the REM's projection of 29.8%. For 2025, the IMF expects a significant drop in inflation to 10%. Economic growth is projected to slow, with the unemployment rate declining from 7.5% of the economically active population in 2024 to 6.6% in 2025. The current account deficit is expected to be 1.2% of GDP in 2024, improving to 0.4% by 2026. Globally, the IMF projects world growth to decelerate from 3.3% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. The report highlights heightened uncertainty in global trade policy, noting that protectionist measures have so far had limited impact on economic activity and prices. In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is projected at 2.4% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, remaining among the lowest in emerging markets. For emerging markets and developing economies, growth is expected to moderate from 4.3% in 2024 to 4.0% in 2026. China\u2019s GDP growth is forecast at 4.8% in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025; Brazil is expected to grow 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.
