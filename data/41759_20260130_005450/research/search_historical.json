The article appears to be a data compilation from an economic database (CEIC) rather than an analytical piece.\n\n**Note:** This article provides historical data through November 2025 but does not contain any forecasts, expert opinions, or analysis regarding future policy rate movements toward May 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ECONOMICS-PKINTR/\">\n# Summary of Article: Pakistan Interest Rate Historical Data (TradingView)\n\n**Source:** TradingView  \n**Content Date:** April 22, 2024\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Current Policy Rate (as of article date):** 10.5%\n   - The article states that Pakistan's interest rate is 10.5% \"at the moment\" and has remained at 10.5% for at least the previous two months\n\n2. **Historical Range:**\n   - **Highest:** 22.00% on May 31, 2024\n   - **Lowest:** 5.75% on December 31, 2017\n\n3. **Key Data Points Referenced:**\n   - Last release observation period: January 26, 2026\n   - Next release: Not specified\n   - Forecast: Not provided\n\n4. **Background Information:**\n   - Since May 23, 2015, the discount ceiling rate was replaced by the \"SBP Policy rate\" as the official interest rate\n   - Interest rate decisions are made by the State Bank of Pakistan\n\n## Opinions (Source Reliability Unclear):\n\nThe article includes what appears to be a commentary or user opinion (labeled \"Monetary Policy Apr 24\") stating:\n- Belief that the SBP will keep the policy rate unchanged at 22% in an upcoming MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) meeting\n- Reasoning cited: Inflation has been decreasing month-by-month due to lower food inflation, which has greater weightage in Pakistan's national CPI\n\n**Note:** There appears to be an inconsistency in the article between the stated current rate (10.5%) and the opinion referencing a 22% rate, which may reflect different time periods or data quality issues in the source material.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/index2.asp\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n## Source\nState Bank of Pakistan (sbp.org.pk)\n\n## Key Information Relevant to the Question\n\n**Policy Rate:**\n- The article mentions \"SBP Policy Rate\" at the bottom of the page, but does not provide a specific numerical value or date for the current or future policy rate.\n\n**Relevant Data Tables:**\n- \"Interests Rate Corridor of SBP- History\" - Last updated: **January 29, 2026**\n\nThis table could potentially contain historical policy rate information, but the specific values are not provided in the extracted web content.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis appears to be a data tables index/navigation page from the State Bank of Pakistan website rather than a substantive article.

The SBP\u2019s own \u201cKey Rates\u201d page shows 10.50 % as of 28 Jan 2026, matching the rate preserved at the January 2026 MPC meeting (SBP CTV page, accessed 29 Jan 26).\n\nFirst meeting of 2026  \n\u2022 26 Jan 26   0 \u2192 10.50 \u2014 rate held, described in SBP press statement and multiple outlets (TradingEconomics, 26 Jan 26; Economic Times, 29 Jan 26).\n\n2.  Inflation developments, 2020-2025 and outlook  \n\nAnnual average CPI inflation (PBS series collated by Macrotrends)  \n2020  9.7 % | 2021  9.5 % | 2022 19.9 % | 2023 30.8 % | 2024 \u224812.6 % (preliminary).\n\nHigh-frequency extremes and turning-points  \n\u2022 Peak 37.97 % y/y in May 2023 (TradingEconomics).  \n\u2022 Rapid disinflation: headline CPI slowed to 4.1 % y/y by Dec 2024; bounced to 5.6 % in Dec 2025 but remained inside the SBP\u2019s 5-7 % medium-term target (TradingEconomics & SBP MPS excerpts).  \n\u2022 Core inflation is stickier at about 7.4 % y/y (Economic Times, 29 Jan 26).  \n\nKey drivers of the down-shift in 2024-25 cited by the SBP: favourable base effects as earlier energy-tariff hikes dropped out, lower global commodity prices, a broadly stable rupee and tight fiscal/monetary settings.\n\nForward path (MPS 26 Jan 26): the MPC expects average inflation to stay within 5-7 % through FY-26 and FY-27, though month-on-month prints could rise temporarily when the low 2024 base washes out.\n\n3.  Pakistan\u2019s IMF programmes, 2020-2026  \n\n\u2022 39-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) approved Jul 2019 for SDR 4.268 bn (US$6 bn).  Six reviews were completed; programme went off-track early 2022.  \n\u2022 9-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for SDR 2.25 bn approved 12 Jul 2023; both quarterly reviews cleared by Mar 2024 with US$1.9 bn disbursed.  \n\u2022 Current arrangement: a 37-month US$7 bn EFF plus a US$1.3 bn Resilience & Sustainability Facility (RSF) approved 25 Sep 2024.  Board first review on 9 May 2025 unlocked ~US$1 bn; second review on 21 Dec 2025 released another US$1.2 bn (Economic Times, 23 Apr 25 cited in earlier draft).  A third review mission is pencilled in for May 2026.  Undrawn access \u2248US$4.8 bn.\n\nConditionality focuses on: maintaining positive real interest rates, keeping primary fiscal balance in surplus, cost-recovery energy tariffs, and exchange-rate flexibility.\n\n4.  Key guidance in the Monetary Policy Statement of 26 January 2026  \n\nPolicy decision: rate kept at 10.50 %, with the MPC stating that \u201cthe real policy rate is adequately positive on a forward-looking basis.\u201d (TradingEconomics, 26 Jan 26; Economic Times, 29 Jan 26).  \n\nInflation outlook: projected to average within the 5-7 % band in FY-26 and FY-27; temporary bumps expected mid-2026 as favourable base effects fade.  \n\nGrowth: FY-26 GDP growth upgraded to 3.75-4.75 % after a 3.7 % y/y expansion in Q1-FY26 (TradingEconomics).  \n\nExternal sector: current-account deficit seen at 0-1 % of GDP; SBP reserves forecast above US$18 bn by June 2026, helped by IMF/EADB inflows and ongoing inter-bank FX purchases (Economic Times, 29 Jan 26).  \n\nLiquidity signal: the SBP announced a 100 bp cut in the average Cash-Reserve Requirement (CRR) for banks \u2014 from 6 % to 5 % \u2014 effective 30 Jan 2026, with a 3 % daily floor (Mettis Global, 27 Jan 26; ProPakistani, 26 Jan 26).  The move is expected to release roughly PKR 300-315 bn in fresh liquidity to support private-sector credit.  \n\nRisk matrix flagged by the MPC:  volatility in global commodity prices, domestic wheat prices, possible energy\u2010tariff adjustments, and fiscal slippage that might endanger the on-going IMF programme.\n\n5.  What the new material clarifies  \n\n\u2022 The Mettis Global dispatch of 10 Mar 2025 removes the last uncertainty around the first post-January-2025 meeting, confirming the policy rate remained 12 %.  \n\u2022 The SBP \u201cCTV\u201d (key-rates) page corroborates that the rate had indeed fallen to 10.50 % by late-2025.  \n\u2022 The CRR circular reported by Mettis Global on 27 Jan 2026 confirms operational follow-through on the liquidity measure alluded to in the MPS.\n\n6.  Remaining information gaps  \n\na.  Official MPS PDFs (or press releases) for the 05 May, 16 Jun, 30 Jul, 15 Sep and 27 Oct 2025 meetings are still required to document the exact size and dating of the cuts that lowered the policy rate from 12 % to 10.50 %.  \n\nb.  The PBS has not yet released its final downloadable CPI bulletin for December 2025; provisional figures (5.6 % y/y) rely on TradingEconomics\u2019 scrape of the PBS press note.  \n\nc.  While the CRR reduction is confirmed by news reports, the underlying SBP BSD (Banking Policy & Regulation) circular would be useful for the permanent record.\n\nThe outstanding items do not affect the directional conclusions above but would be needed for a fully audited dataset.</Agent_report>\n"
