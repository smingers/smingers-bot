(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Inflation control remains primary SBP objective
2. Gradual economic stabilization
3. Balanced approach between growth and price stability

Checklist:
1. Target: SBP policy rate on May 1, 2026, in percent
2. Base Rate: Historical average around 11.63%
3. Consistency Check: Median around 10.5-11.5, aligned with current trends
4. Key Evidence:
   - Current 10.5% policy rate
   - Inflation within 5-7% range
   - Cautious monetary policy approach
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected global economic shock pushing rates dramatically up/down

Probability Calibration:
- Conservative approach maintaining proximity to current rate
- Slight upward bias due to potential inflationary pressures
- Asymmetric distribution reflecting economic uncertainty

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 7.5
Percentile 5: 8.5
Percentile 10: 9.0
Percentile 20: 9.5
Percentile 40: 10.5
Percentile 60: 11.5
Percentile 80: 12.5
Percentile 90: 13.5
Percentile 95: 14.5
Percentile 99: 15.5

Rationale: The distribution centers around the current 10.5% policy rate, with wider intervals to capture potential economic fluctuations. The asymmetric shape reflects the cautious monetary policy approach and the potential for gradual adjustments.
