Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 8.5

Percentile 40: 10.5
Percentile 60: 11.5
Percentile 80: 12.5
Percentile 90: 13.5

Rationale for Distribution:
- Centered around current 10.5% rate
- Slight upward skew to account for potential inflationary pressures
- Asymmetric distribution reflects economic uncertainty
- Respects the hint about being between 5.0 and 25.0
- Captures potential rate adjustment scenarios

The prediction suggests a cautious monetary policy with a moderate likelihood of slight rate increases, reflecting the SBP's balanced approach to economic management.
