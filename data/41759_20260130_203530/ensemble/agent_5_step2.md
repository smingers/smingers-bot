Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. Fitch Solutions (Jan 27, 2026):
- Factual Information: Current policy rate 10.5%, inflation exceeding 5-7% target
- Expert Opinions: Expects rate cuts in FY 2026/27
- Source Quality: Moderate (analysis/forecast piece)

2. Dawn Article (Jan 30, 2026):
- Factual Information: Policy rate at 10.5%, inflation 5.6%, core inflation 7.4%
- Expert Opinions: MPC expecting GDP growth 3.75-4.75%
- Source Quality: High (primary source with official data)

3. Tribune Article (Jan 26, 2026):
- Factual Information: Matches other sources on policy rate and inflation
- Expert Opinions: 
  * Market expectations of potential rate cuts
  * Business community demanding rate reductions
- Source Quality: Moderate

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Consistent reporting of current 10.5% policy rate across multiple sources
- SBP's focus on maintaining inflation within 5-7% target range
- Modest but stable economic growth projections

Moderate Evidence:
- Business community pressure for rate cuts
- Potential easing of inflation in coming months
- Improved economic stability indicators

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative market expectations about future rate movements
- Geopolitical uncertainties

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Horizon: Approximately 3 months (May 1, 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Likely more conservative, less room for significant policy changes
- If timeframe doubled: More potential for structural monetary policy shifts

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Inflation stabilization efforts
2. Cautious monetary policy approach
3. Moderate economic growth
4. External economic pressures
5. Business sector expectations

The current context suggests a careful, incremental approach to monetary policy, with a slight bias towards potential modest rate reductions.

Probability Calibration:
- Maintaining stability is a primary SBP objective
- Gradual approach to monetary policy changes
- Balancing inflation control with economic growth

Checklist:
1. Target: SBP policy rate on May 1, 2026, in percent
2. Base Rate: Historical average around 11.63%
3. Consistency Check: Median ~10.5-11.5, aligned with current rate and economic conditions
4. Key Evidence:
   - Stable 10.5% current rate
   - Inflation within target range
   - Moderate economic growth
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected external economic shock pushing rates significantly up/down

Distribution:
Percentile 1: 7.5
Percentile 5: 8.0
Percentile 10: 8.5
Percentile 20: 9.5
Percentile 40: 10.5
Percentile 60: 11.5
Percentile 80: 12.5
Percentile 90: 13.5
Percentile 95: 14.5
Percentile 99: 15.5

Rationale:
- Centered around current 10.5% rate
- Wide distribution to account for potential economic uncertainties
- Slight upward skew to reflect potential inflationary pressures
- 90% confidence interval between 8.5% and 13.5%
- Most likely scenario around 10.5-11.5%

The distribution reflects the SBP's cautious monetary approach, potential for modest adjustments, and the need to balance inflation control with economic growth.
