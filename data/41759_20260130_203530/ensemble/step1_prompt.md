<Agent_report>
Query: Analyze historical State Bank of Pakistan policy rate decisions, current economic challenges, and potential future monetary policy scenarios for 2026
The State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) monetary policy landscape for 2026 reveals a complex economic scenario characterized by cautious stabilization and strategic policy management. As of January 2026, the central bank has maintained its policy rate at 10.5%, signaling a nuanced approach to economic recovery and inflation control.

Economic Growth Outlook:
According to the SBP, Pakistan's real GDP growth is projected to be between 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year 2026, a significant improvement from previous years. The World Bank's projection is slightly more conservative at 3.4%. The growth is primarily driven by domestic-oriented sectors, particularly industry and agriculture. Large-scale manufacturing showed promising growth, with 8.0% in October and 10.4% in November 2025, resulting in a cumulative growth of 6.0% during July-November FY 26.

Inflation Dynamics:
Headline inflation has moderated to 5.6% year-on-year in December 2025, aligning with the central bank's expectations. However, core inflation remains sticky at around 7.4%. The SBP anticipates inflation to stabilize within the 5-7% target range over the medium term, though with potential risks from global commodity price volatility and domestic wheat prices.

Monetary Policy Strategy:
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has opted to maintain the policy rate at 10.5%, defying market expectations of a rate cut. This decision reflects a cautious approach to ensure price stability and sustainable economic growth. The central bank views the current real policy rate as adequately positive to manage inflation.

External Sector Developments:
The current account deficit stood at $244 million in December 2025, with a cumulative deficit of $1.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. Workers' remittances and ICT services exports have helped contain the overall deficit. Foreign exchange reserves have improved, reaching $16.1 billion as of January 16, 2026, with projections to exceed $18 billion by June 2026.

Fiscal and Monetary Challenges:
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax revenues grew by 9.5% in the first half of FY 26, significantly lower than the previous year's 26% growth. The government faces challenges in achieving the annual primary surplus target. Broad money (M2) growth has picked up to 16.3%, driven by increased private sector credit and government borrowing.

Key Risks and Considerations:
1. Persistent core inflation
2. Widening trade deficit
3. Dependence on external financing
4. Potential volatility in global commodity prices

Structural Recommendations:
The SBP emphasizes the need for:
- Sustained fiscal discipline
- Structural reforms
- Broadening the tax base
- Privatization of loss-making state-owned enterprises

International Perspective:
S&P Global Market Intelligence projects a current account deficit of 0.5% in 2026, slightly differing from the SBP's outlook. The agency notes potential risks from global tariff uncertainty and geopolitical fragmentation.

Conclusion:
Pakistan's economic trajectory in 2026 demonstrates cautious optimism. The State Bank of Pakistan is navigating a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and maintaining price stability. While macroeconomic indicators show improvement, structural challenges persist that require comprehensive and sustained policy interventions.

The analysis is based on sources including the State Bank of Pakistan's official statements, news reports from Dawn, The Express Tribune, and international economic analysis from S&P Global Market Intelligence and the World Bank.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
