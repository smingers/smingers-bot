Analysis:
To forecast the State Bank of Pakistan's target policy rate for May 1, 2026, I'll need to research current economic conditions, inflation trends, monetary policy stance, and potential future economic challenges facing Pakistan. Key areas of focus will include:

1. Current policy rate and recent monetary policy decisions
2. Inflation trajectory and projections
3. Economic growth forecasts
4. International economic factors (global interest rates, IMF interactions)
5. Domestic fiscal and monetary policy trends

The research should aim to understand the SBP's likely approach to balancing inflation control with economic growth stimulation over the next two years. Given Pakistan's complex economic environment, this will require examining multiple economic indicators and policy signals.
