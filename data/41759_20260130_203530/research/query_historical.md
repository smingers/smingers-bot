Analysis:
This forecasting question requires understanding the historical trajectory of Pakistan's monetary policy and the State Bank of Pakistan's approach to setting policy rates. The key contextual factors will likely include Pakistan's recent inflation trends, economic stability, international monetary conditions, and the SBP's historical rate-setting behavior. Given the volatility of Pakistan's economic environment, this forecast will depend on projecting macroeconomic conditions and potential policy responses two years into the future.

An outside view approach would involve:
1. Examining historical policy rate trends
2. Understanding current economic challenges
3. Tracking recent monetary policy statements
4. Analyzing global economic forecasts that might impact Pakistan

The goal is to develop a probabilistic estimate of the policy rate based on current economic indicators and potential future scenarios.
