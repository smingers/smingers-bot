Speaking to business leaders in Islamabad, Sharif credited the military with resolving critical economic challenges, including eliminating petrol smuggling and stabilizing the sugar industry, and described the relationship as a 'partnership' that places the civilian government in a subservient but collaborative role. This acknowledgment follows a 2025 constitutional overhaul that elevated Munir to Field Marshal and created the position of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF), granting him control over all military branches and nuclear command. Sharif also claimed that the unprecedented civil-military unity would soon leave India 'astonished' and 'puzzled,' asserting that Pakistan is on track to become a global economic power. In support of this shift, he announced a reduction in industrial electricity tariffs by Rs 4.4 per unit and export refinance rates from 7.5% to 4.5%. The government has also introduced 'blue passports' for top exporters, designating them as 'ambassadors at large' to promote export-led growth. Despite these moves, critics argue that Sharif\u2019s remarks confirm the near-total erosion of the distinction between military and civilian power in Pakistan by 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:07 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/hybrid-confession-pm-sharif-admits-military-is-pakistans-true-economic-engine-exclusive-details-9868773.html)\n\n**PM Announces Rs 4.04 Per Unit Power Tariff Cut For Industry, Incentives For Exporters**\nPrime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif announced significant economic relief measures for Pakistan's industrial and export sectors on January 30, 2026. The government reduced electricity tariffs by Rs 4.04 per unit and wheeling charges to less than Rs 9 for industries. The export refinance scheme rate was cut from 7.5% to 4.5%, with Rs 1,052 billion allocated for the scheme\u2014Rs 900 billion already utilized. Exporters awarded in the 2024-25 fiscal year received two-year blue passports as an incentive. The PM emphasized that export-led growth is essential for Pakistan\u2019s economic revival, stating, 'There is no other way forward. Export-led growth is the only solution for Pakistan's economic future.' He reiterated that future foreign direct investment (FDI) would be restricted to export-oriented projects to boost foreign exchange and strengthen reserves. He credited the stabilization of the economy\u2014marked by inflation dropping to single digits, the policy rate reduced to 10.5%, and foreign exchange reserves doubling (partly due to support from China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar)\u2014to collective efforts, including those of the Chief of Defence Forces and Field Marshal General Asim Munir. The PM also highlighted enforcement actions against sugar mills, which generated Rs 50 billion in additional tax revenue, and the control of petroleum product smuggling, which added Rs 125 billion annually via the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL), attributing this success to strict orders by Field Marshal Munir. The government aims to increase IT exports from $3 billion to $30 billion within five years, with Minister for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja praised for her leadership. The PM urged banks to increase lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify the economy and end the boom-and-bust cycle. He also warned industries against tax evasion, stressing compliance and enforcement. The Commerce Minister affirmed that Pakistan is regaining international recognition due to the PM\u2019s vision and engagement with the business community. Awards were presented to the top 30 exporters and leading bankers at the ceremony.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 01:12 PM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/pm-announces-rs-404-per-unit-power-tariff-cu-2128286.html)\n\n**Pakistan's sharply shrinking economic sovereignty - Asia Times**\nPakistan's economic sovereignty is sharply declining despite temporary stabilization, according to an Asia Times analysis published on January 30, 2026. Although macroeconomic indicators have improved\u2014with growth projected at 3% for fiscal year 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, inflation cooled, and foreign exchange reserves rising to approximately US$15.9 billion\u2014the foundation remains fragile. The improvement is largely due to austerity measures, import restrictions, tax hikes, and reliance on IMF programs and bilateral loans rather than sustainable productivity or export growth. Public debt remains high at 70\u201380% of GDP, with a heavy concentration of short- to medium-term liabilities requiring constant refinancing, which erodes policy autonomy. Export performance has deteriorated, falling from 16% of GDP in the 1990s to 10.4% in 2024, signaling a long-term decline in industrial competitiveness. Multinational corporations have increasingly exited Pakistan\u2014Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, Shell, Microsoft, Uber, Yamaha, Total, and Telenor\u2014citing high taxes, profit repatriation restrictions, and political risk, leading to reduced foreign investment, technology transfer, and integration into global value chains. Militant violence has intensified, with 699 attacks recorded in 2025 (a 34% increase), resulting in 1,034 deaths and 1,366 injuries, increasing economic risk premiums and diverting state resources from development to security. The creation of a special police unit to protect Chinese nationals and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) assets underscores the deepening dependence on China, which provides financial relief but not structural reform. The country remains highly vulnerable to external shocks\u2014oil price spikes, remittance declines, or political instability\u2014due to its reliance on rollover financing. As a result, Pakistan is increasingly seen as a structurally high-risk economy by global markets, capable of crisis management but unable to generate sustainable growth or exert meaningful regional influence. The core issue is the persistent conflation of short-term liquidity with long-term economic capacity, leading to a slow erosion of state capacity with potentially disastrous regional consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:47 AM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2026/01/pakistans-sharply-shrinking-economic-sovereignty/)\n\n**Pakistan has become a stable economy: PM Shehbaz**\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared on January 30, 2026, that Pakistan's economy had become 'stable', stating this 'without any hesitation' during an address to major exporters and business figures. He credited the government's efforts for bringing inflation down to 'single digits' and reducing the policy rate to 10.5%, a significant improvement from the previous 21.5\u201322% policy rate and soaring inflation levels. The PM recalled the challenging economic conditions of the past, when uncertainty was widespread, and acknowledged that industrialists and businessmen had faced these difficulties head-on. He expressed hope that Pakistan was now on a path to progress. The statement was made in a speech reported by Dawn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:07 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969891)\n\n**Budget At Economic Crossroads**\nIndia's economic outlook is at a critical juncture, according to HSBC's chief India economist Pranjul Bhandari, as growth signals remain mixed. Real GDP growth has been strong, and credit growth is rising, particularly in sectors like defence, electronics, power, and metals. However, nominal GDP growth is weak, foreign inflows are insufficient to cover the trade deficit, and recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data show signs of slowing momentum after a strong start. The robust growth in 2025 was driven largely by one-time factors\u2014favorable rains, falling oil prices, moderating inflation, and policy easing such as tax cuts and interest rate reductions\u2014which are now largely behind. The key challenge for 2026 is transitioning from informal-sector recovery to formal-sector revival, with capital expenditure (capex) showing early signs of recovery but not yet broad-based. Fiscal policy remains tight, with the central government aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.2% of GDP in FY27 (down from 4.4% in FY26), through continued consolidation and infrastructure spending retention. State government debt ratios are projected to rise due to lack of fiscal discipline, though the 3% fiscal ceiling may begin to constrain state borrowing. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with inflation projected just under the 4% target, allowing room for easing if growth weakens. A combination of tight fiscal and easy monetary policy could benefit bonds, equities, and the rupee, especially after a year of underperformance relative to other emerging markets. However, sustained economic momentum depends on structural reforms: deregulation at central and state levels, reduction of customs duties and non-tariff barriers (e.g., quality control orders), and deeper trade integration with the West and East. Policy transparency, stability, and predictability are critical to lowering investment risks and improving returns. The report concludes that while short-term policy balance can provide a temporary boost, long-term growth hinges on reform implementation and a stable, predictable policy environment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:32 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/column/budget-at-economic-crossroads/20260130.htm)\n\n**Is China's economic policy too cautious?**\nChina's economic policy in 2026 is expected to remain cautious, despite strong performance in 2025, with GDP growth projected at 5%. The economy demonstrated resilience through robust manufacturing output, expanding exports\u2014particularly to Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Global South\u2014and avoidance of financial instability, even amid a fifth consecutive year of property market downturn. China accounts for roughly 30% of global manufacturing value-added and dominates supply chains in electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panels. However, persistent deflationary pressures, with producer prices falling for over three years due to excess capacity, highlight weak domestic consumption. The trade surplus now exceeds $1 trillion, reflecting overreliance on external demand. At the 2025 Central Economic Work Conference, Chinese leaders emphasized caution, prioritizing 'high-quality development,' stability, and risk management over growth targets in the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026\u201330). Domestic consumption will be boosted through targeted subsidies and service-sector expansion, while the property downturn will be managed via inventory absorption and selective financial support. Fiscal and monetary policy will remain expansionary in form but conservative in intent, aiming for around 4.5% GDP growth\u2014policy-supported, not self-sustaining. Structural challenges include overcapacity, 'involution' (fierce competition eroding profits), a shrinking population due to decades of strict family planning, and limited success from pronatalist policies. Geopolitical tensions with the US and Europe, including US actions affecting allies like Venezuela, constrain China\u2019s strategic room for maneuver. Military escalation over Taiwan would carry high costs, and achieving the 2035 goal of becoming a 'moderately developed' economy may be unrealistic given current demographic and geopolitical conditions. While resilience has provided time, the balance between stability and bold reform\u2014particularly in consumption, market discipline, and international relations\u2014will determine whether 2026 marks a durable transition or entrenched stagnation. According to Lee Jong-Wha, former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, China must avoid excessive caution that entrenches imbalances and instead act with shrewdness, boldness, and flexibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:43 PM\nSource:[interest.co.nz](https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/136981/lee-jong-wha-advises-chinas-leaders-take-advantage-its-resilience-address)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**CF40 Report: China's Economy Expected to Show Further Marginal Improvement in 2026, Recommends More Substantial Cuts to Policy Rates**\nThe China Financial Forty (CF40) released its Q4 2025 macroeconomic policy report, forecasting that China's economic performance in 2026 is likely to show further marginal improvement under sufficient countercyclical policy support. The report emphasizes that monetary policy is paramount, serving as the key driver for activating the economy's internal growth momentum. CF40 senior researcher Zhang Bin stated that standard economic recoveries typically begin with financial markets and expectations, then spread to corporate profits, consumption, and labor markets. Under robust countercyclical policies, China\u2019s real GDP growth in 2026 could reach around 5.0%, with nominal GDP growth potentially improving to approximately 4.5%. External conditions are expected to marginally improve, with stable demand from major developed economies and a likely stabilization in Sino-U.S. trade relations. Domestically, China remains in a recovery phase, and 2026 marks the start of the '14th Five-Year Plan' period, supporting the continuation of proactive fiscal policy and moderately accommodative monetary policy. Fiscal policy should maintain broad fiscal expenditure growth exceeding nominal GDP growth; in 2025, broad fiscal spending was about 40 trillion yuan, and in 2026, it should reach no less than 42 trillion yuan, requiring sustained high levels of borrowing and government spending. Monetary policy must achieve two changes: altering future expectations and making economic calculations favorable for businesses and households\u2014ensuring investment profitability exceeds financing costs and home purchase costs do not significantly exceed rental costs. Key steps include the central bank\u2019s firm commitment to inflation targets and a more substantial reduction in policy rates, including the 7-day reverse repo rate, deposit rates, and the Loan Prime Rate (LPR). CF40 member Huang Yiping highlighted the persistent 'supply surplus, weak demand' issue as a major macroeconomic challenge, both short- and long-term. He recommended: (1) allowing markets to play a decisive role in resource allocation, particularly by regulating local government behavior; (2) boosting consumption through higher household income and improved social security; (3) expanding the service sector to stimulate consumption and employment; and (4) achieving high-level openness and rethinking the external economic policy framework for joint growth with economic partners.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:07 AM\nSource:[\u8d22\u7ecf\u7f51](http://economy.caijing.com.cn/20260128/5139525.shtml)\n\n**'Hybrid' Confession: PM Sharif Admits Military Is Pakistan's True Economic Engine | Exclusive Details**\nOn January 30, 2026, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made a rare public admission that Pakistan operates under a 'hybrid regime' in which the military, led by Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, is the true engine of the country's economic survival.

The statement was made in a speech reported by Dawn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:07 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969891)\n\n**Budget At Economic Crossroads**\nIndia's economic outlook is at a critical juncture, according to HSBC's chief India economist Pranjul Bhandari, as growth signals remain mixed. Real GDP growth has been strong, and credit growth is rising, particularly in sectors like defence, electronics, power, and metals. However, nominal GDP growth is weak, foreign inflows are insufficient to cover the trade deficit, and recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data show signs of slowing momentum after a strong start. The robust growth in 2025 was driven largely by one-time factors\u2014favorable rains, falling oil prices, moderating inflation, and policy easing such as tax cuts and interest rate reductions\u2014which are now largely behind. The key challenge for 2026 is transitioning from informal-sector recovery to formal-sector revival, with capital expenditure (capex) showing early signs of recovery but not yet broad-based. Fiscal policy remains tight, with the central government aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.2% of GDP in FY27 (down from 4.4% in FY26), through continued consolidation and infrastructure spending retention. State government debt ratios are projected to rise due to lack of fiscal discipline, though the 3% fiscal ceiling may begin to constrain state borrowing. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with inflation projected just under the 4% target, allowing room for easing if growth weakens. A combination of tight fiscal and easy monetary policy could benefit bonds, equities, and the rupee, especially after a year of underperformance relative to other emerging markets. However, sustained economic momentum depends on structural reforms: deregulation at central and state levels, reduction of customs duties and non-tariff barriers (e.g., quality control orders), and deeper trade integration with the West and East. Policy transparency, stability, and predictability are critical to lowering investment risks and improving returns. The report concludes that while short-term policy balance can provide a temporary boost, long-term growth hinges on reform implementation and a stable, predictable policy environment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:32 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/column/budget-at-economic-crossroads/20260130.htm)\n\n**Is China's economic policy too cautious?**\nChina's economic policy in 2026 is expected to remain cautious, despite strong performance in 2025, with GDP growth projected at 5%. The economy demonstrated resilience through robust manufacturing output, expanding exports\u2014particularly to Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Global South\u2014and avoidance of financial instability, even amid a fifth consecutive year of property market downturn. China accounts for roughly 30% of global manufacturing value-added and dominates supply chains in electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panels. However, persistent deflationary pressures, with producer prices falling for over three years due to excess capacity, highlight weak domestic consumption. The trade surplus now exceeds $1 trillion, reflecting overreliance on external demand. At the 2025 Central Economic Work Conference, Chinese leaders emphasized caution, prioritizing 'high-quality development,' stability, and risk management over growth targets in the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026\u201330). Domestic consumption will be boosted through targeted subsidies and service-sector expansion, while the property downturn will be managed via inventory absorption and selective financial support. Fiscal and monetary policy will remain expansionary in form but conservative in intent, aiming for around 4.5% GDP growth\u2014policy-supported, not self-sustaining. Structural challenges include overcapacity, 'involution' (fierce competition eroding profits), a shrinking population due to decades of strict family planning, and limited success from pronatalist policies. Geopolitical tensions with the US and Europe, including US actions affecting allies like Venezuela, constrain China\u2019s strategic room for maneuver. Military escalation over Taiwan would carry high costs, and achieving the 2035 goal of becoming a 'moderately developed' economy may be unrealistic given current demographic and geopolitical conditions. While resilience has provided time, the balance between stability and bold reform\u2014particularly in consumption, market discipline, and international relations\u2014will determine whether 2026 marks a durable transition or entrenched stagnation. According to Lee Jong-Wha, former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, China must avoid excessive caution that entrenches imbalances and instead act with shrewdness, boldness, and flexibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:43 PM\nSource:[interest.co.nz](https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/136981/lee-jong-wha-advises-chinas-leaders-take-advantage-its-resilience-address)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**PSX sheds over 6,000 points as US-Iran fears hit sentiment**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 6,000 points on January 29, 2026, dropping to a session low of 181,961.14, a decline of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%), after reaching a high of 188,923.39 earlier in the day. The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**CF40 Report: China's Economy Expected to Show Further Marginal Improvement in 2026, Recommends More Substantial Cuts to Policy Rates**\nThe China Financial Forty (CF40) released its Q4 2025 macroeconomic policy report, forecasting that China's economic performance in 2026 is likely to show further marginal improvement under sufficient countercyclical policy support. The report emphasizes that monetary policy is paramount, serving as the key driver for activating the economy's internal growth momentum. CF40 senior researcher Zhang Bin stated that standard economic recoveries typically begin with financial markets and expectations, then spread to corporate profits, consumption, and labor markets. Under robust countercyclical policies, China\u2019s real GDP growth in 2026 could reach around 5.0%, with nominal GDP growth potentially improving to approximately 4.5%. External conditions are expected to marginally improve, with stable demand from major developed economies and a likely stabilization in Sino-U.S. trade relations. Domestically, China remains in a recovery phase, and 2026 marks the start of the '14th Five-Year Plan' period, supporting the continuation of proactive fiscal policy and moderately accommodative monetary policy. Fiscal policy should maintain broad fiscal expenditure growth exceeding nominal GDP growth; in 2025, broad fiscal spending was about 40 trillion yuan, and in 2026, it should reach no less than 42 trillion yuan, requiring sustained high levels of borrowing and government spending. Monetary policy must achieve two changes: altering future expectations and making economic calculations favorable for businesses and households\u2014ensuring investment profitability exceeds financing costs and home purchase costs do not significantly exceed rental costs. Key steps include the central bank\u2019s firm commitment to inflation targets and a more substantial reduction in policy rates, including the 7-day reverse repo rate, deposit rates, and the Loan Prime Rate (LPR). CF40 member Huang Yiping highlighted the persistent 'supply surplus, weak demand' issue as a major macroeconomic challenge, both short- and long-term. He recommended: (1) allowing markets to play a decisive role in resource allocation, particularly by regulating local government behavior; (2) boosting consumption through higher household income and improved social security; (3) expanding the service sector to stimulate consumption and employment; and (4) achieving high-level openness and rethinking the external economic policy framework for joint growth with economic partners.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:07 AM\nSource:[\u8d22\u7ecf\u7f51](http://economy.caijing.com.cn/20260128/5139525.shtml)\n\n**Economic Survey 2026: Comprehensive Overview of India's Economy Ahead of Union Budget**\nThe Economic Survey 2026, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in both houses of Parliament on January 29, 2026, serves as a key pre-budget assessment of India's economic condition. Prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs and presented by Chief Economic Adviser V. Ananth Narayan, the report was released one day before the Union Budget, marking a shift from the traditional timing. The survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the previous financial year, forecasts for the upcoming year, growth indicators, inflation projections, employment, trade, and fiscal health. It highlights India\u2019s economic performance amid global political and economic challenges, noting that private investment, consumer confidence, and rural demand were key growth drivers. The report emphasizes the need for quality employment to fully leverage India\u2019s demographic dividend, with a focus on reskilling, upskilling, labor flexibility, and welfare to boost job creation. It underscores the importance of a strategic trade roadmap to counter protectionism and enhance competitiveness in global supply chains. India\u2019s external sector resilience is reflected in a foreign exchange reserve of $640.3 billion, covering 90% of external debt. The survey notes a decline in global inflation after its 2022 peak, with India\u2019s retail inflation easing due to government measures, though food prices remained affected by supply chain and weather factors. Over the past five years, the government has prioritized infrastructure development\u2014physical, digital, and social\u2014public expenditure, and public-private partnerships to advance the 'Viksit Bharat @2047' vision. Financial institutions are highlighted as critical in enabling economic growth, with monetary policy influencing financial intermediation. The manufacturing sector is filling gaps left by developed nations, though challenges remain in geopolitical tensions and trade policy. The report details sector-wise performance across agriculture, industry, and services, identifying key contributors and challenges. It reaffirms the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047 through strong, inclusive, and low-carbon growth, despite ongoing challenges in renewable energy deployment and international financing. The survey also addresses the dual impact of AI on global labor markets, urging policymakers to consider its implications, manage disruptions, and ensure fairness, calling for institutional action to address the transformative potential of AI.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:17 AM\nSource:[Hindustan](https://www.livehindustan.com/business/economic-survey-2026-a-complete-picture-of-the-economy-before-the-budget-with-a-focus-on-these-10-key-points-201769656220626.html)\n\n**Beyond stabilization: The next challenge for Pakistan\u2019s economy**\nPakistan's economy has achieved significant stabilization, according to Dr. Aqdas Afzal, as major macroeconomic indicators show marked improvement since 2023. Inflation, which peaked at 38% in May 2023, had declined to 6.1% by November 2025, aided by falling international oil prices\u2014Brent crude dropped from $97 in September 2023 to around $62\u2014and the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) tight monetary policy, guided by the Taylor Rule and responsive to U.S. Federal Reserve rate changes. The SBP recently cut rates by 50 basis points following a U.S. rate reduction, signaling policy flexibility. Externally, Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2 billion (0.5% of GDP) in FY2025\u2014the best performance in 14 years\u2014compared to a $17.5 billion deficit in FY2022, and foreign exchange reserves rose to nearly $16 billion, up from below $3 billion in February 2023. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit narrowed to -5.4% of GDP in FY2025, a 2.5 percentage point improvement from FY2022, and the country achieved a primary fiscal surplus of 2.4%, a critical step toward reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. Despite these gains, the economy remains in a state of 'unstable stability,' vulnerable to shocks. Economic growth remains weak, failing to generate the 1.5 million jobs annually needed to absorb Pakistan\u2019s growing population of nearly 5 million new entrants. To address this, policymakers must shift from stabilization to fostering resilient, inclusive growth by prioritizing youth-centered strategies, such as promoting entrepreneurship, modernizing education in science and technology, and expanding skills training\u2014similar to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030. The writer emphasizes that the next challenge is to transition from rescue to sustainable growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[arabnews.pk](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2628082)\n\n**Post-IMF Future**\nPakistan is beginning to plan for a post-IMF future, as noted in an article published on January 13, 2026, by The Nation. Although the economy has achieved a degree of stability under the current IMF programme, the country cannot rely indefinitely on external financing. The article emphasizes that Pakistan must become self-sustaining by generating sufficient domestic revenue and fostering conditions for broad-based economic growth. Cabinet bodies have proposed urgent reforms, including improving the ease of doing business, restructuring and rationalizing tariffs\u2014especially in energy pricing and trade duties\u2014and doubling exports to $60 billion within three years. Currently, Pakistan exports approximately $30\u201332 billion annually, making the $60 billion target highly ambitious. Despite the difficulty, the article affirms that the reform direction is correct. The core challenge lies in a fragmented policy environment: overlapping laws, inconsistent regulations, and a complex web of taxes, duties, and tariffs introduced for short-term revenue, creating a hostile climate for business. High taxation, legal uncertainty, volatile policies, some of the highest fuel and electricity prices in the region, unreliable energy supply, and among the highest personal tax rates in comparable economies further deter enterprise. The solution, the article argues, is not grand infrastructure or elaborate plans, but a focused, high-powered effort to consolidate laws, taxes, and tariffs into a single, coherent, and predictable policy framework. Business growth must be made easier, not harder. The central issue is fundamentally legal and policy-based, not investment or infrastructure-related.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 01:06 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/13-Jan-2026/post-imf-future)\n\n**The year ahead**\nPakistan enters 2026 facing three persistent challenges: resurgent terrorism, economic fragility, and the erosion of fundamental rights. Terrorism remains a pressing threat, evidenced by suicide bombings in Bannu, North Waziristan, and near Islamabad\u2019s district courts, as well as ongoing violence in Balochistan, demonstrating that attacks are no longer geographically limited or restricted to symbolic targets. However, counterterrorism efforts continue to prioritize force over reform, with weak policing, prosecution, local governance, and political engagement in conflict-affected areas. Without addressing these systemic gaps, 2026 risks repeating cycles of condemnation, announcements of investigations, and ignored root causes. The economy presents a slower but equally dangerous crisis: while the sale of a majority stake in Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was celebrated as a breakthrough, it underscores the rarity of decisive action. Long-term economic recovery requires broadening the tax base, reforming loss-making state enterprises, and ensuring policy predictability\u2014none of which have been achieved. Without these, 2026 may see another year of short-term fixes, reliance on external aid, and stagnation. Most corrosive is the shrinking civic space: over the past year, prolonged internet shutdowns, restrictions on public assembly, pressure on journalists, legal actions against dissent, censorship of media, blocking of digital platforms, and intimidation of human rights organizations became routine. These measures suppress criticism but erode accountability and deepen public mistrust, particularly among youth. A state relying on control rather than consent undermines its own governance capacity and risks provoking the instability it seeks to prevent. Key institutions will be critical in 2026: Parliament must become a genuine forum for debate and law scrutiny, not post-hoc justification; the judiciary must act with consistency and independence; economic decisions must be clear, consistent, and applied equally; security policy must be under civilian authority, not emergency rule; and the executive must recognize that coercion-based order is fragile. The country has repeatedly relied on control; it must now prioritize governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 12:07 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1964423)\n\n**Navigating 2026**\nPakistan faces a pivotal moment in 2026 as economic, political, security, and public health challenges converge. Economic stability remains fragile, with foreign exchange reserves at approximately $14.5 billion\u2014largely sustained by foreign aid rather than strong export performance\u2014despite a projected 3.2% GDP growth for the current financial year. Structural issues persist, including inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises and a tax base expansion that has failed to deliver results. Experts stress that consistent, transparent reforms are essential to build fiscal credibility and attract diversified investment. Politically, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif leads a strong coalition, but ongoing pressure from the PTI, though limited in scale compared to past protests led by Imran Khan, continues to unsettle investors and disrupt urban life due to inconsistent government responses to protests. Security threats remain high, with active militant groups such as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Daesh, and Baloch separatists sustaining long-running conflicts. Despite improved ties with the US and a defense pact with Saudi Arabia, analysts warn of a 'moderate likelihood' of armed conflict with India, whose increasingly belligerent foreign policy\u2014marked by public refusal to engage diplomatically with Pakistan\u2014keeps global nuclear war concerns at peak levels. In public health, Pakistan is near eradication of polio, but a $2 billion funding gap threatens progress, forcing reliance on self-financing for vaccination and awareness campaigns. The decisions made in 2026 will determine Pakistan\u2019s long-term trajectory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 03:12 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2584840/navigating-2026)\n\n**Test of intent and direction \u2013 Pakistan & Gulf Economist**\nPakistan\u2019s economy in 2025 stands at a critical juncture between crisis and opportunity, according to the Pakistan & Gulf Economist. Inflation data comes from the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024\u201325 (Ministry of Finance), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) Consumer Price Index, and Trading Economics. Energy remains a decisive factor, with ongoing reform efforts and persistent inefficiencies. Circular debt, though partially managed, continues to strain public finances and industrial productivity. Energy tariffs have been adjusted to reduce fiscal losses, but this has increased production costs for export-oriented industries. Meanwhile, momentum is growing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and decentralized power, which could reduce import dependence and enhance energy security if sustained, though the pace and inclusiveness of this transition remain uncertain. Structural reform is increasingly emphasized in policy discourse, with recognized priorities including reforming state-owned enterprises, broadening the tax base, improving governance, and ensuring policy continuity\u2014yet implementation remains slow due to political economy constraints. Socially, poverty levels are stabilizing but remain high, and inequality is visible; social protection programs are critical but limited by fiscal constraints. The central challenge is aligning economic reform with social justice to ensure inclusive and durable growth. The economy is no longer in free fall but not yet on firm ground. Sustainable growth depends on shifting from consumption-led, debt-dependent models to productivity-driven, export-oriented, and innovation-based development\u2014requiring political consensus, institutional strength, and long-term vision beyond electoral cycles. The year 2025 is not defined by breakthroughs but by technical, politically difficult choices that will shape the nation\u2019s future. The outcome hinges not on external conditions but on Pakistan\u2019s ability to reform itself.

This was achieved through consistent monetary tightening by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2024, followed by a measured rate cut of 100 basis points in January 2025, signaling the end of the worst inflationary phase. The decline in inflation, supported by falling global commodity prices, improved domestic food supply, and anchored expectations, led to recovering purchasing power and rising consumer confidence across urban and rural areas. The external position strengthened due to policy coherence between fiscal and monetary authorities, enabling timely disbursements from the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility. This improved credibility allowed the government to negotiate better rollover terms for bilateral and multilateral debt, easing 2026 repayment pressure. GDP growth for 2025 was modest at 2.7% (IMF estimate), but the composition of growth improved: agriculture rebounded with better wheat, cotton, and rice output; industry revived in Q3 due to small-scale manufacturing and infrastructure-linked construction; and export sectors like textiles and pharmaceuticals benefited from stable energy and exchange rates. Investor confidence returned, evidenced by a rising Pakistan Stock Exchange, foreign portfolio inflows, narrowing sovereign risk spreads, and a stable rupee. Looking ahead, the IMF and World Bank project 2026 GDP growth above 3%, with inflation expected to remain below 5%, allowing room for further monetary easing. However, structural challenges\u2014low productivity, limited fiscal space, and climate vulnerabilities\u2014remain. Sustaining progress depends on maintaining policy consistency, accelerating structural reforms, and empowering private enterprise.

Advanced economies face rising debt, aging populations, and political gridlock, while emerging markets, though benefiting from a weaker US dollar, are experiencing growing strain. A Project Syndicate article challenges the notion of benign conditions, arguing that climate vulnerabilities (e.g., Pakistan), pandemic aftereffects, and protectionism have created a more precarious global economy. The IMF\u2019s October 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report projects global growth slowing from 3.3% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2026, citing uncertainty and protectionism as headwinds, despite a slight improvement from earlier forecasts. For Pakistan, real GDP growth is projected at 3.4% for 2017\u20132026 (including 2025\u20132026), only slightly above population growth, with 2030 projections at 4.5%, still modest. The report notes that recent floods are not factored into current projections. The article attributes rising debt distress in emerging economies to overboard austerity, high interest payments, and insufficient multilateral support, including limited IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocation. It critiques neoliberal policies\u2014privatization, deregulation, free trade, and fiscal austerity\u2014arguing that market mechanisms have failed to deliver growth, especially in developing nations, and calls for a revival of government-led industrial policy and public purpose to address systemic failures. The World Bank\u2019s early 1990s assessment, which claimed nonmarket mechanisms failed, is now questioned, as market-led policies have not fulfilled their promise over the past three decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 04:23 PM\nSource:[Pakistan Today](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/10/19/a-difficult-and-uncertain-global-economic-outlook/)\n\n**Decades of fiscal mismanagement push Pakistan toward economic collapse**\nPakistan's economy faces severe structural challenges due to decades of fiscal mismanagement, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in its Annual Report on the State of the Economy 2024-25. The report projects GDP growth between 3.25% and 4.25% for fiscal year 2026, with inflation expected to remain in the 5-7% range and the current account deficit near 0-1% of GDP, indicating external stability. However, recent floods in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have damaged agricultural land, risking new supply chain disruptions and inflation. While reconstruction spending may temporarily boost growth, it threatens to widen Pakistan's already fragile fiscal gap. The SBP identifies low domestic savings\u2014among the lowest in developing economies\u2014as a core weakness, driven by low income levels, fiscal imbalances, and weak financial intermediation. Consumption accounts for 92% of GDP, making growth unsustainable and reliant on remittances and foreign borrowing. Government revenues are insufficient to cover interest payments, fueling a 'debt spiral' that limits funding for social and development programs. State-owned enterprises incur massive losses, and public borrowing crowds out credit for the private sector. Nearly one-third of Pakistanis remain outside the formal financial system, relying on informal mechanisms like gold, livestock, and ROSCAs. Religious reservations toward interest-based banking and poor financial literacy hinder financial inclusion. With 65% of the population under 30 and nearly 44% living in poverty, the SBP urges the government to prioritize education, skill-building, and technology investment to break the cycle of low savings and high debt, as reported by The Express Tribune.
