As of January 2026, the central bank has maintained its policy rate at 10.5%, signaling a nuanced approach to economic recovery and inflation control.\n\nEconomic Growth Outlook:\nAccording to the SBP, Pakistan's real GDP growth is projected to be between 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year 2026, a significant improvement from previous years. The World Bank's projection is slightly more conservative at 3.4%. The growth is primarily driven by domestic-oriented sectors, particularly industry and agriculture. Large-scale manufacturing showed promising growth, with 8.0% in October and 10.4% in November 2025, resulting in a cumulative growth of 6.0% during July-November FY 26.\n\nInflation Dynamics:\nHeadline inflation has moderated to 5.6% year-on-year in December 2025, aligning with the central bank's expectations. However, core inflation remains sticky at around 7.4%. The SBP anticipates inflation to stabilize within the 5-7% target range over the medium term, though with potential risks from global commodity price volatility and domestic wheat prices.\n\nMonetary Policy Strategy:\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has opted to maintain the policy rate at 10.5%, defying market expectations of a rate cut. This decision reflects a cautious approach to ensure price stability and sustainable economic growth. The central bank views the current real policy rate as adequately positive to manage inflation.\n\nExternal Sector Developments:\nThe current account deficit stood at $244 million in December 2025, with a cumulative deficit of $1.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. Workers' remittances and ICT services exports have helped contain the overall deficit. Foreign exchange reserves have improved, reaching $16.1 billion as of January 16, 2026, with projections to exceed $18 billion by June 2026.\n\nFiscal and Monetary Challenges:\nFederal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax revenues grew by 9.5% in the first half of FY 26, significantly lower than the previous year's 26% growth. The government faces challenges in achieving the annual primary surplus target. Broad money (M2) growth has picked up to 16.3%, driven by increased private sector credit and government borrowing.\n\nKey Risks and Considerations:\n1. Persistent core inflation\n2. Widening trade deficit\n3. Dependence on external financing\n4. Potential volatility in global commodity prices\n\nStructural Recommendations:\nThe SBP emphasizes the need for:\n- Sustained fiscal discipline\n- Structural reforms\n- Broadening the tax base\n- Privatization of loss-making state-owned enterprises\n\nInternational Perspective:\nS&P Global Market Intelligence projects a current account deficit of 0.5% in 2026, slightly differing from the SBP's outlook. The agency notes potential risks from global tariff uncertainty and geopolitical fragmentation.\n\nConclusion:\nPakistan's economic trajectory in 2026 demonstrates cautious optimism. The State Bank of Pakistan is navigating a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and maintaining price stability. While macroeconomic indicators show improvement, structural challenges persist that require comprehensive and sustained policy interventions.\n\nThe analysis is based on sources including the State Bank of Pakistan's official statements, news reports from Dawn, The Express Tribune, and international economic analysis from S&P Global Market Intelligence and the World Bank.</Agent_report>\n"
