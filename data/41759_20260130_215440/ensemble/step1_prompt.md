Summary of the article on Pakistan's monetary policy:

Key Facts and Statistics:
1. Current Policy Rate: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has reduced its benchmark policy rate from 22% to 11% as of May 2025.

   - Potentially reintroduce volatility
   - Undermine recent economic stabilization efforts

Potential Inflationary Risks:

- Focus on structural reforms
- Consolidate recent economic gains
- Await improvements in:

The article suggests the SBP should be cautious and hold its current policy rate, allowing recent monetary actions to take full effect before considering further cuts.

Query: Analyze State Bank of Pakistan's monetary policy strategy, key economic indicators influencing policy rate decisions in 2026, and potential range of policy rate based on current economic conditions and inflation trends
Based on the comprehensive search results, here's a detailed analysis of the State Bank of Pakistan's monetary policy strategy and key economic indicators for 2026:

Monetary Policy Strategy:
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is maintaining a cautious yet strategic approach to monetary policy in 2026. As of January 26, 2026, the central bank has kept its key policy rate steady at 10.5%, surprising market expectations of a potential rate cut. According to the SBP's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) statement, this decision is underpinned by several key considerations:

1. Inflation Outlook:
- Headline inflation has eased to 5.6% in December 2025, within the target range of 5-7%

- The SBP projects inflation to remain within the 5-7% target range through FY 2026 and FY 2027

2. Economic Growth Projections:
- Real GDP growth is projected between 3.75-4.75% for the current fiscal year
- First quarter GDP growth was reported at 3.7%, driven by industry and agriculture sectors
- Large-scale manufacturing showed growth of 6% during July-November 2025

3. External Economic Conditions:
- Current account deficit stood at $244 million in December 2025
- Total current account deficit for the first half of FY 2026 was $1.2 billion

Policy Rate and Monetary Stance:

- Continued fiscal consolidation
- Structural reforms
- Careful management of inflation and external balances

3. Potential Policy Risks:

- Sharper-than-expected domestic demand pickup

Future Outlook:

- Continued economic recovery
- Gradual improvement in business and consumer confidence
- Potential for monetary easing if inflation remains stable
- Focus on coordinated monetary and fiscal policies

Recommendations from Economic Experts:
- Gradual monetary easing
- Continued focus on structural reforms

The central bank's current strategy reflects a balanced approach, prioritizing macroeconomic stability while creating conditions for sustainable economic growth.

Potential Information Gaps:

- Comprehensive analysis of potential structural reform impacts</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
