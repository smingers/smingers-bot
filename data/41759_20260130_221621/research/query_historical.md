Analysis:
This forecasting question requires understanding the historical trajectory of Pakistan's monetary policy and the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) approach to setting policy rates. Key contextual factors include Pakistan's recent economic challenges such as high inflation, currency depreciation, and macroeconomic instability. The policy rate is a critical tool for managing these economic pressures, so forecasting its future value demands examining recent SBP rate decisions, inflation trends, and potential economic recovery scenarios.

The current global economic environment, including potential shifts in US Federal Reserve policy, international commodity prices, and Pakistan's IMF program compliance, will likely influence the SBP's future rate decisions. Historical patterns suggest the central bank uses the policy rate to balance inflation control with economic growth stimulation.
