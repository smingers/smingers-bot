Shiller, Nobel Prize in Economics, emphasized the need for individuals to protect themselves from inflation risk, beyond relying solely on central bank interest rate adjustments. In Mexico, the Banco de M\u00e9xico (Banxico) is closely monitoring two key factors in setting monetary policy: inflation expectations and exchange rate dynamics. On inflation, two main concerns are debated: first, the rise in the share of workers earning the minimum wage\u2014from 30% to nearly 55% over the past seven years\u2014has increased disposable income and may fuel inflation, though some argue that higher productivity and increased working hours mitigate this effect, supported by a slight contraction in real wage and average income in late 2025. Second, new tariffs on countries without trade agreements (particularly in Asia) could raise consumer prices due to high import dependency, though others believe the tariff increases are marginal and thus have limited impact. Regarding the exchange rate, a key concern is the risk of peso depreciation if Banxico lowers rates while the U.S. Federal Reserve does not, reducing the interest rate differential and potentially weakening investor appetite. Some believe the recent dollar weakness and strong macroeconomic fundamentals in Mexico will prevent exchange rate pressure, while others warn that uncertainty around PEMEX debt, fiscal deficit targets, and potential credit rating downgrades could trigger volatility. The upcoming decision on whether Banxico pauses or continues its rate-cutting path is not purely technical\u2014it carries significant implications for inflation, exchange rates, and household financial well-being.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:45 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/finanzaspersonales/inflacion-tasa-referencia-20260130-797544.html)\n\n**Pakistan has become a stable economy: PM Shehbaz**\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared on January 30, 2026, that Pakistan's economy had become 'stable', stating this 'without any hesitation' during an address to major exporters and business figures. He credited the government's efforts for bringing inflation down to 'single digits' and reducing the policy rate to 10.5%, a significant improvement from the previous 21.5\u201322% policy rate and soaring inflation levels. The PM recalled the challenging economic conditions of the past, when uncertainty was widespread, and acknowledged that industrialists and businessmen had faced these difficulties head-on. He expressed hope that Pakistan was now on a path to progress. The statement was made in a speech reported by Dawn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:07 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969891)\n\n**Economic Analyst: U.S. Federal Reserve Independence at Stake**\nAhmed Najm, an economic analyst, stated that the U.S. economy is in a delicate phase marked by apparent resilience amid hidden inflationary pressures. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady at 3.50% to 3.75% comes at a time when questions are growing about the central bank's independence and the impact of political conflicts on the U.S. dollar's stability. During a Zoom interview on the 'Money and Business' program aired by 'Extra News', Najm provided a comprehensive analysis of the future of the U.S. dollar, stock market performance, and bond trends amid global volatility. He noted that while the U.S. economy remains resilient despite tight monetary policy, inflation has not been fully resolved. Najm warned that the full effects of Trump's trade war have not yet surfaced in inflation data, and higher inflation levels are expected in the near future, potentially forcing the Fed to maintain high interest rates longer. He highlighted that the U.S. dollar's share in global central bank reserves declined by 1% in 2025 and lost another 0.5% in early 2026. Najm criticized political rhetoric describing the dollar as a 'yo-yo' tool, stating such language increases investor anxiety and drives demand for alternative safe havens. He cautioned that the dollar may no longer serve as a reliable store of value and warned of potential U.S. government intervention in monetary policy to devalue the currency. Regarding global stock markets, Najm noted that the technology sector continues to lead earnings but cautioned against excessive valuation inflation, comparing the current environment to the 'dot-com bubble' with companies spending billions on development without tangible profits, posing significant risks. He also pointed to a growing global shift toward alternative currencies like the yuan and euro, especially in oil trade, and acknowledged the challenges of creating a unified currency for the BRICS bloc due to economic disparities. However, he affirmed that the 'shift away' from dollar dominance has already begun and could accelerate over the next five years. Najm concluded by noting rising U.S. bond yields, reflecting market concerns about the size of U.S. debt and the risk of another government shutdown without swift political agreements, which would further pressure the U.S. budget and credit rating.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 11:03 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2026/1/30/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83/7286414)\n\n**Uruguayan Agroexport Sector Endorses Exchange Rate Signals but Urges Competitiveness Agenda**\nThe president of the Uruguayan Rural Association (ARU), Rafael Ferber, stated that the announcement of recent monetary measures has already triggered a notable recovery in the exchange rate, reversing a concerning decline. He emphasized that these steps\u2014alongside potential actions by the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU), such as revising LRM interest rates or intervening in the market\u2014were correct and must be sustained. Mar\u00eda Laura Rodr\u00edguez, head of economics and sustainability at the Union of Uruguayan Exporters (UEU), called the economic team's intervention 'very necessary' to prevent further exchange rate misalignment. She highlighted the importance of the early meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) and the 100 basis point reduction in the Monetary Policy Rate (TPM), noting a positive market reaction, though she stressed that additional measures were needed for greater impact. Rodr\u00edguez pointed out that Uruguay's dollar depreciation in 2024 exceeded that of other countries, indicating local market factors at play, and warned that export competitiveness and profitability have already been negatively affected in an accumulative way. Ferber attributed the current economic challenges to fiscal deficits, stagnant growth, and global conditions, noting that peso costs are now highly problematic. He expressed cautious optimism, citing the government\u2019s inflation target of 4.5% and its intent to defend it, which could help stabilize the dollar. Reflecting on a recent two-hour meeting with Economy and Finance Minister Gabriel Oddone, Ferber acknowledged the limited tools available but emphasized that structural reforms are not on the government\u2019s agenda. He warned that if international dollar trends persist\u2014especially as highlighted by former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2014the country faces ongoing competitiveness and cost challenges. Ferber advocated for monthly fuel price reviews, arguing that the current bimonthly system fails to reflect timely international price changes, citing a 25% drop in refinery prices and a 4% drop in diesel prices in 2025. While acknowledging the transparency of the new methodology, he criticized the delayed adjustment. He called for structural measures, including revising subsidies for supergas and productive diesel, noting these are not currently on the policy agenda.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:11 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/uruguay/el-sector-agroexportador-avala-las-senales-cambiarias-pero-presiona-una-agenda-competitividad-n6240272)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**PSX sheds over 6,000 points as US-Iran fears hit sentiment**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 6,000 points on January 29, 2026, dropping to a session low of 181,961.14, a decline of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%), after reaching a high of 188,923.39 earlier in the day. The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**Rebuilding reserves**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan kept interest rates unchanged in January 2026, surprising some observers, as it signaled that the battle against inflation has been won, but the effort to rebuild foreign exchange reserves remains ongoing. Since July 2023, Pakistan faced a severe economic crisis, narrowly avoiding sovereign default, which was averted by a $6 billion bailout from the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Inflation peaked at 38% year-on-year in May 2023, and the rupee lost nearly two-thirds of its value between 2021 and 2023. Two IMF programs followed: a Stand-by Arrangement in July 2023 and an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 2024, which remains active. At the start of the EFF, Pakistan\u2019s Net International Reserves (NIR) were negative $11 billion, indicating liabilities exceeded reserves. The IMF targeted a return to positive reserves by 2028. By September 2025, NIR had improved to negative $6.6 billion, and by June 2026, they were projected at negative $4.8 billion\u2014progress, but still negative. The State Bank has been aggressively buying dollars from banks, sometimes exceeding IMF targets, such as purchasing over $1 billion monthly in September and October 2025. Despite this, the reserve rebuilding process is expected to continue for another 12 to 18 months. The State Bank cited rising economic momentum and a widening trade deficit due to increased imports as reasons for caution, noting a $1.2 billion current account deficit from July to December 2025. Although manageable, the risk of a resurgence in the trade deficit threatening reserves remains high. The Bank\u2019s decision to hold rates steady reflects its focus on stabilizing external accounts, as economic growth forecasts were upgraded to 3.75\u20134.75% for FY26, with potential for further strengthening in FY27.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:48 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969666)\n\n**RBI to keep interest rates steady at 5.25% through 2026**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep its key policy rate steady at 5.25% through 2026, according to a Reuters poll of 70 economists, with 59 (over 80%) forecasting no change at the February 4\u20136 Monetary Policy Committee meeting. This decision follows a cumulative 125 basis point reduction in benchmark borrowing costs since February 2025, but inflation remains well below the target range, and economic growth\u2014projected at 7.4% this fiscal year and 6.7% next\u2014is being driven primarily by government spending rather than private investment. Despite rate cuts, monetary transmission remains weak, with banks citing liquidity shortages and an inability to lower deposit rates. The rupee has fallen to a record low of 91.9650 against the dollar, pressured by around $4 billion in foreign investor outflows from Indian equities in early 2026. To counter this, the RBI has injected over $23 billion in liquidity through bond purchases, foreign exchange swaps, and repo operations. Economists like Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership argue the RBI should now focus on ensuring policy ease reaches the broader economy. Inflation is expected to average 2.1% in the current fiscal year and rise to 4.0% in the next. Some analysts, including Anil Bhansali of Finrex Treasury Advisors, warn that currency interventions may have drained liquidity, undermining the impact of previous rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:10 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/rbi-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-at-5-25-through-2026-ce7e5bdeda8bf525)\n\n**Inflation and Reference Rate: Key Economic Challenges for Mexico in 2026**\nRobert J.

Najm concluded by noting rising U.S. bond yields, reflecting market concerns about the size of U.S. debt and the risk of another government shutdown without swift political agreements, which would further pressure the U.S. budget and credit rating.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 11:03 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2026/1/30/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83/7286414)\n\n**Uruguayan Agroexport Sector Endorses Exchange Rate Signals but Urges Competitiveness Agenda**\nThe president of the Uruguayan Rural Association (ARU), Rafael Ferber, stated that the announcement of recent monetary measures has already triggered a notable recovery in the exchange rate, reversing a concerning decline. He emphasized that these steps\u2014alongside potential actions by the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU), such as revising LRM interest rates or intervening in the market\u2014were correct and must be sustained. Mar\u00eda Laura Rodr\u00edguez, head of economics and sustainability at the Union of Uruguayan Exporters (UEU), called the economic team's intervention 'very necessary' to prevent further exchange rate misalignment. She highlighted the importance of the early meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) and the 100 basis point reduction in the Monetary Policy Rate (TPM), noting a positive market reaction, though she stressed that additional measures were needed for greater impact. Rodr\u00edguez pointed out that Uruguay's dollar depreciation in 2024 exceeded that of other countries, indicating local market factors at play, and warned that export competitiveness and profitability have already been negatively affected in an accumulative way. Ferber attributed the current economic challenges to fiscal deficits, stagnant growth, and global conditions, noting that peso costs are now highly problematic. He expressed cautious optimism, citing the government\u2019s inflation target of 4.5% and its intent to defend it, which could help stabilize the dollar. Reflecting on a recent two-hour meeting with Economy and Finance Minister Gabriel Oddone, Ferber acknowledged the limited tools available but emphasized that structural reforms are not on the government\u2019s agenda. He warned that if international dollar trends persist\u2014especially as highlighted by former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2014the country faces ongoing competitiveness and cost challenges. Ferber advocated for monthly fuel price reviews, arguing that the current bimonthly system fails to reflect timely international price changes, citing a 25% drop in refinery prices and a 4% drop in diesel prices in 2025. While acknowledging the transparency of the new methodology, he criticized the delayed adjustment. He called for structural measures, including revising subsidies for supergas and productive diesel, noting these are not currently on the policy agenda.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:11 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/uruguay/el-sector-agroexportador-avala-las-senales-cambiarias-pero-presiona-una-agenda-competitividad-n6240272)\n\n**NBU Lowers Policy Rate: Banker Explains Impact on Loans and Deposits**\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reduced its key policy rate from 15.5% to 15%, marking the beginning of a potential trend toward further reductions under favorable economic conditions. According to Dmitry Zamotayev, Director of the Retail Business Department at Globus Bank, this adjustment is modest but positive in the current context. He expects modest declines in both deposit and loan interest rates, with deposit rates likely remaining in the 13% to 14.5% annual range. Loan rates may follow with a lag, potentially decreasing by 0.5\u20131 percentage point once the policy rate reaches 14\u201314.5%. Zamotayev highlighted that ongoing damage to Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure is creating economic challenges: small and medium businesses operate irregularly on generators, while large enterprises face significant power shortages. These disruptions increase risks of inflation, with forecasts suggesting consumer prices could rise by over 1% in January\u2014far above the previous expectation of 0.3\u20130.5%. The inflationary pressure is driven by rising costs in fuel, energy-intensive food products, consumer goods (especially those supporting energy autonomy), and logistics. Moreover, reduced supply under high demand is a key factor pushing prices upward. Despite the rate cut, the NBU cited stable disinflationary pressure and reduced external financing risks as the basis for starting a monetary easing cycle. However, energy-related disruptions and low base effects are expected to cause moderate inflation acceleration in the second half of the year, leading to a projected inflation rate of 7.5% by the end of 2026.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/economics/finance/oblikova-stavka-nbu-shcho-bude-z-depozitami-v-ukrajini-2026-roci-bankir-poyasniv-13270554.html)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports.

The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth.

Despite low transaction volumes, housing prices have shown a divergence from volume, supported by strong economic growth driven by AI, which has also fueled record-high stock market performance. According to Xu Jiaxin, Executive Director of the Housing & Real Estate Planning Research Office at Zhushang Real Estate, the linkage between the stock and housing markets is closely tied to the People's Bank of China's selective credit control policies. With AI expected to continue driving growth into 2026, the central bank faces a critical challenge in balancing monetary policy\u2014either too loose could trigger a rebound in housing prices, undermining anti-speculation efforts. Meanwhile, Lai Zhi-chang, Public Relations Officer at Dajia Housing Research Office, notes that average new home prices in 2025 have doubled compared to 2016, and major banks\u2019 average interest rates remain high. This has significantly increased the homebuying burden, especially as wage growth lags behind housing prices and inflation. Unlike 2016, which saw weak economic growth (1.51%) and the implementation of the Real Estate Consolidation Tax, 2025 features strong economic momentum, yet housing transactions are constrained by tight monetary policy. Despite this, hot money from the booming stock market is circulating, prompting concerns about a potential post-control rebound. As a result, the market is shifting toward a buyer\u2019s market\u2014a rare opportunity in the past decade. However, Xu warns that if the central bank misjudges its policy stance, both liquidity and confidence could surge, leading to a rapid rise in prices and undermining the effectiveness of current housing regulations. With mortgage rates now averaging over 2.5%, and many banks no longer allowing refinancing for those only paying grace periods, the ability of buyers to sustain 'stepping-on-toes' purchases is questionable. Without early recognition of these risks, households may face severe financial challenges in the future.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5621/9296303)\n\n**Rebuilding reserves**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan kept interest rates unchanged in January 2026, surprising some observers, as it signaled that the battle against inflation has been won, but the effort to rebuild foreign exchange reserves remains ongoing. Since July 2023, Pakistan faced a severe economic crisis, narrowly avoiding sovereign default, which was averted by a $6 billion bailout from the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Inflation peaked at 38% year-on-year in May 2023, and the rupee lost nearly two-thirds of its value between 2021 and 2023. Two IMF programs followed: a Stand-by Arrangement in July 2023 and an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 2024, which remains active. At the start of the EFF, Pakistan\u2019s Net International Reserves (NIR) were negative $11 billion, indicating liabilities exceeded reserves. The IMF targeted a return to positive reserves by 2028. By September 2025, NIR had improved to negative $6.6 billion, and by June 2026, they were projected at negative $4.8 billion\u2014progress, but still negative. The State Bank has been aggressively buying dollars from banks, sometimes exceeding IMF targets, such as purchasing over $1 billion monthly in September and October 2025. Despite this, the reserve rebuilding process is expected to continue for another 12 to 18 months. The State Bank cited rising economic momentum and a widening trade deficit due to increased imports as reasons for caution, noting a $1.2 billion current account deficit from July to December 2025. Although manageable, the risk of a resurgence in the trade deficit threatening reserves remains high. The Bank\u2019s decision to hold rates steady reflects its focus on stabilizing external accounts, as economic growth forecasts were upgraded to 3.75\u20134.75% for FY26, with potential for further strengthening in FY27.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:48 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969666)\n\n**RBI to keep interest rates steady at 5.25% through 2026**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep its key policy rate steady at 5.25% through 2026, according to a Reuters poll of 70 economists, with 59 (over 80%) forecasting no change at the February 4\u20136 Monetary Policy Committee meeting. This decision follows a cumulative 125 basis point reduction in benchmark borrowing costs since February 2025, but inflation remains well below the target range, and economic growth\u2014projected at 7.4% this fiscal year and 6.7% next\u2014is being driven primarily by government spending rather than private investment. Despite rate cuts, monetary transmission remains weak, with banks citing liquidity shortages and an inability to lower deposit rates. The rupee has fallen to a record low of 91.9650 against the dollar, pressured by around $4 billion in foreign investor outflows from Indian equities in early 2026. To counter this, the RBI has injected over $23 billion in liquidity through bond purchases, foreign exchange swaps, and repo operations. Economists like Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership argue the RBI should now focus on ensuring policy ease reaches the broader economy. Inflation is expected to average 2.1% in the current fiscal year and rise to 4.0% in the next. Some analysts, including Anil Bhansali of Finrex Treasury Advisors, warn that currency interventions may have drained liquidity, undermining the impact of previous rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:10 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/rbi-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-at-5-25-through-2026-ce7e5bdeda8bf525)\n\n**Monetary Policy Needs Softening**\nThe article argues that monetary policy in Pakistan needs to be softened, despite recent marginal rate reductions. Trade and industry have long criticized the current stance, and while the reduction aligns with global trends\u2014most central banks, both developed and developing, have recently lowered rates\u2014it was poorly timed. Inflation hit a low of 0.3% in April 2025, making that the ideal moment for a cut, but by November 2025, inflation had risen to 6.2%, indicating a reversal in the inflationary trend. This shift strengthens the argument that demand-contracting monetary policy is ineffective against cost-push inflation and may have unintended side effects, consistent with Goodhart's Law. The Taylor Rule, a widely used empirical guideline for setting policy rates based on inflation and output gaps, suggests that Pakistan\u2019s fragile recovery stage demands a significantly lower policy rate. Although monetary policy influences both inflation and output in the short run, as seen in Pakistan, it faces challenges due to time lags, inadequate data, and technical capacity in developing economies. While lower rates would ease public debt servicing, the banking sector may suffer from reduced interest spreads, though it is expected to absorb the impact. The article emphasizes that monetary policy should be selectively used, with real variables like production better addressed through supply-side reforms. The Laffer Curve theory is cited to support the idea that excessively high taxes reduce revenue and growth. Ultimately, public confidence and expectations\u2014highlighted by Keynesian insights\u2014are critical for sustainable economic success. The author, Saghir Mushtaq, an economist at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, concludes that a more accommodative monetary policy is both necessary and expected by industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/01-Jan-2026/monetary-policy-needs-softening)\n\n**Rate cut too meagre to address major challenges, industry leaders complain**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.50% on December 16, 2025, prompting mixed reactions. The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) welcomed the move as 'cautious and measured,' noting it would lower borrowing costs, support business activity, and promote sustainable economic growth without destabilizing the economy. OICCI Secretary General Abdul Aleem stated the gradual approach allows businesses to plan investments with greater confidence. In contrast, local business leaders strongly criticized the cut as insufficient and ineffective. KCCI President Muhammad Rehan Hanif called it a 'token adjustment' that fails to address Pakistan's fragile economy, emphasizing that high borrowing costs persist despite declining inflation. He highlighted that regional economies like China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka maintain single-digit interest rates, enabling competitive industrial growth. FPCCI\u2019s Saquib Fayyaz Magoon echoed this, stating the reduction would not boost exports or investment under current conditions and urged the SBP to bring rates down to single digits. Business leaders from the SITE Association of Industry, Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association, and other trade bodies stressed that high interest rates, combined with excessive energy tariffs, fuel prices, taxation, and exchange rate volatility, are stifling production, forcing capacity underutilization, and increasing unemployment. Diwan Fakhruddin noted SMEs are especially affected, with new industries halted and existing ones operating below capacity. He and others demanded an immediate, substantial rate cut aligned with ground realities. Saleem Valimohammad warned that without a move to single-digit rates, business growth and economic expansion will remain severely constrained.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 02:02 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1961376)\n\n**Caution for now**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its key policy rate at 11% for the fourth consecutive monetary policy review since May, citing the need to preserve price stability amid rising inflation. Headline CPI inflation increased to 5.6% in September from 3% in August, while core inflation remained steady at 7.3%, indicating persistent underlying inflationary pressures. Despite some strengthening fundamentals, risks to the fragile economic recovery persist, particularly in the external sector, which remains supported by strong remittance inflows\u2014surpassing $38 billion in FY25\u2014and import restrictions, even as exports stagnate and foreign private and official inflows remain limited. These remittances helped boost foreign exchange reserves to $14.5 billion, with the SBP purchasing $20 billion in dollars from the market over the past two years to stabilize the exchange rate. The central bank\u2019s cautious stance reflects deeper structural issues, including the inverse relationship between growth driven by imported consumption and recurring balance-of-payments crises. Although the economy is projected to grow by around 4% this year despite flood-related losses, any policy missteps could jeopardize hard-won stability. While the SBP\u2019s decision was expected, trade bodies like the FPCCI criticized it as anti-growth and anti-investment, citing high borrowing costs relative to regional peers. However, elevated interest rates are not the sole cause of weak private investment; structural challenges such as punitive tax rates, high energy costs, policy inconsistency, and government budget constraints have played a larger role. Without comprehensive business reforms, even significant rate cuts would likely fail to stimulate investment. The SBP\u2019s caution is justified: easing too soon could trigger inflation, deplete reserves, and force future rate hikes, undermining economic stability. As the article concludes, 'Do we really want to follow that path? Clearly not.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 02:53 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1951913)\n\n**SBP & Monetary Policy**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) faces significant challenges in formulating monetary policy due to elevated uncertainty from ambiguous administrative policies, political interference, and external pressures. Despite constitutional protections\u2014strengthened during the PTI government\u2014that aim to limit politicization of the central bank, the SBP remains constrained in its ability to ease rates or stimulate growth. Persistent inflation, driven by repeated rupee devaluations and supply chain disruptions post-COVID, led to sharp rate hikes; while inflation has moderated to 4-5%, it remains above target. The economy is now slowing, with rising poverty (over 45%) and unemployment, declining exports (textiles fell 11% month-on-month in August 2025), and a deteriorating current account. The government\u2019s expansion of the state sector, coercive taxation, and unsustainable populist projects have crowded out the private sector, reduced competitiveness, and driven foreign investment away. The August/September floods and a new U.S.-initiated tariff war\u2014causing a 6% global trade decline per WTO data\u2014have worsened economic instability. Fiscal policy is equally problematic, with endless government borrowing and non-sustainable projects undermining investor confidence and threatening financial stability. The SBP is caught in a dilemma: easing rates could fuel inflation, but maintaining tight policy risks deepening recession. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and with India add further risk. Despite these pressures, the SBP has maintained a cautious, data-driven approach, prioritizing price stability and employment as mandated, and resisting political interference. The author, Dr. Kamal Monnoo, emphasizes that constitutional safeguards for the SBP are critical to ensuring long-term economic stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/09-Oct-2025/sbp-monetary-policy)\n\n**Rate cut unlikely this month, says SBP governor**\nState Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmed stated that an interest rate cut is unlikely in the upcoming monetary policy announcement on October 27, 2025, due to uncertainty surrounding inflation and ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a Bloomberg interview, he emphasized that any policy rate adjustment will depend on the outcome of IMF talks and the economic impact of recent floods. Inflation rose to 5.6% in September 2025 from 3% in August, partly due to flood-related disruptions, and may temporarily exceed the SBP\u2019s medium-term target range of 5% to 7% in early 2026, though it is expected to remain within the range on average during the current and next fiscal years. The SBP\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee maintained the benchmark interest rate unchanged in its last meeting, reflecting caution amid inflationary pressures despite a generally stable trend since May 2025. Analysts and independent economists also ruled out a rate cut, citing rising inflation and the central bank\u2019s focus on macroeconomic stability. The World Bank projected Pakistan\u2019s GDP growth at 2.6% for FY26, reflecting subdued expectations amid structural challenges. Governor Ahmed highlighted that the SBP has built up foreign exchange reserves by purchasing approximately $20 billion from the interbank market over the past three years, calling it a 'carefully planned move' that strengthened the country\u2019s economic position. On trade, he noted increased US buyer interest in Pakistani textiles despite a 19% tariff on their products, particularly as Indian textiles face a 50% tariff in the US. However, he acknowledged that high domestic production and energy costs remain significant barriers to exporters fully capitalizing on this opportunity, requiring time and policy support to realize benefits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 01:50 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1947335)\n\n**Pakistan's Central Bank: Interest Rate Cuts Hinge on IMF Review**\nPakistan's central bank governor, Jamil Ahmed, stated that the country's monetary policy remains 'extremely cautious' despite an extended period of interest rate hikes. He emphasized that renewed inflation pressures from recent devastating floods and external financing risks could delay further easing of monetary policy and interest rate cuts. Although inflation may temporarily exceed the medium-term target range of 5% to 7% in early 2026, it is expected to average within the target over the current and next fiscal years. These comments come ahead of the October 27 monetary policy meeting and during a second review visit by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) team assessing a $7 billion loan program. In the previous month, the central bank held the benchmark interest rate steady for the third consecutive meeting following severe monsoon rains that killed over 1,000 people and displaced 4.2 million. The central bank's key interest rate stands at 11%. The floods damaged approximately 8% of the country's agricultural land, contributing to rising food prices. U.S. tariffs and global supply chain disruptions are also affecting Pakistan\u2019s growth outlook. Governor Ahmed affirmed that the central bank\u2019s tight monetary policy has been effective in controlling inflation, stating, 'The interest rate is positive \u2014 significantly positive \u2014 and this type of tight policy has contributed to controlling inflation.' He added that fiscal and monetary coordination shows 'good progress.' Pakistan\u2019s economy is recovering after narrowly avoiding sovereign default two years ago, with IMF financing helping the government service its debt and bolster foreign exchange reserves. The economy is projected to grow by 4.2% in the fiscal year starting in July 2025, up from 2.7% the previous year, and inflation has declined from a record high of 38% in 2023, creating room for the central bank to reduce rates to 11%.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 12:03 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/10/7/pakistan-central-bank-interest-rate-imf)\n\n**SBP Links Future Interest Rate Cuts to IMF Review Outcome**\nGovernor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Jameel Ahmad, stated that further interest rate cuts will depend on the outcome of the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and the economic impact of the 2024 monsoon floods, despite inflation showing signs of stability. Speaking to Bloomberg, Ahmad emphasized the central bank's caution, noting that renewed price pressures from floods and external funding risks could limit additional monetary easing. He projected that inflation may temporarily exceed the 5%-7% target range in early 2026 but will remain within it on average over the current and next fiscal years. The SBP maintained its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the third consecutive meeting following catastrophic floods that killed over 1,000 people, displaced 4.2 million, and damaged 8% of cropped land, driving up food prices. Ahmad credited the tight monetary policy for bringing inflation under control, noting the real policy rate remains substantially positive and that coordination between monetary and fiscal policy is progressing well. Pakistan\u2019s economy, which narrowly avoided default two years ago, is regaining stability with IMF funding supporting debt repayment and reserve building. The economy is projected to grow 4.2% in FY2025, up from 2.7% in FY2024, while inflation has dropped from a record 38% in 2023 to 11% after the SBP halved its policy rate. The IMF program is 'progressing well,' with Pakistan outperforming targets on foreign exchange reserves. The SBP has bolstered reserves by purchasing $20 billion from the interbank market over the past three years, a move Ahmad described as 'strategic,' ensuring that recent $500 million Eurobond repayments did not strain reserves. Reserves have grown nearly fivefold from their 2023 low of $3 billion, and the Pakistani rupee has remained stable since 2024, making it Asia\u2019s most stable currency according to Bloomberg\u2019s regional index. Ahmad also highlighted improved trade and investment ties with the U.S., noting Pakistan\u2019s 19% export tariff to the U.S. is now the lowest in South Asia, boosting textile exports and attracting international buyer inquiries. The U.S. has shown interest in Pakistan\u2019s oil and mining sectors, with a Washington investor conference scheduled for later this month to attract American investment. Additionally, the government is advancing plans to legalize cryptocurrency, which Ahmad said will ensure tighter regulation and reduce risks through proper vetting of new entrants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 07:09 AM\nSource:[ProPakistani](https://propakistani.pk/?p=933306)\n\n**SBP keeps policy rate unchanged amid flood-driven economic challenges**\nOn September 15, 2025, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced that its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 percent, as stated in a statement: 'The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting held on September 15, 2025.' The decision follows a review of the economic outlook amid a severe flood crisis that limits room for a rate cut. SBP data show headline inflation at 3 percent in August and a current account deficit of $240 million in July. Despite stable inflation, the floods have created significant economic challenges, prompting a cautious stance. In June 2025, the MPC also kept the rate at 11 percent after noting inflation at 3.5 percent year\u2011on\u2011year in May and a slight decline in core inflation. The committee also noted a sharp rebound in global oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and easing US\u2011China trade frictions.
