Although macroeconomic indicators have improved\u2014with growth projected at 3% for fiscal year 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, inflation cooled, and foreign exchange reserves rising to approximately US$15.9 billion\u2014the foundation remains fragile. The improvement is largely due to austerity measures, import restrictions, tax hikes, and reliance on IMF programs and bilateral loans rather than sustainable productivity or export growth. Public debt remains high at 70\u201380% of GDP, with a heavy concentration of short- to medium-term liabilities requiring constant refinancing, which erodes policy autonomy. Export performance has deteriorated, falling from 16% of GDP in the 1990s to 10.4% in 2024, signaling a long-term decline in industrial competitiveness. Multinational corporations have increasingly exited Pakistan\u2014Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, Shell, Microsoft, Uber, Yamaha, Total, and Telenor\u2014citing high taxes, profit repatriation restrictions, and political risk, leading to reduced foreign investment, technology transfer, and integration into global value chains. Militant violence has intensified, with 699 attacks recorded in 2025 (a 34% increase), resulting in 1,034 deaths and 1,366 injuries, increasing economic risk premiums and diverting state resources from development to security. The creation of a special police unit to protect Chinese nationals and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) assets underscores the deepening dependence on China, which provides financial relief but not structural reform. The country remains highly vulnerable to external shocks\u2014oil price spikes, remittance declines, or political instability\u2014due to its reliance on rollover financing. As a result, Pakistan is increasingly seen as a structurally high-risk economy by global markets, capable of crisis management but unable to generate sustainable growth or exert meaningful regional influence. The core issue is the persistent conflation of short-term liquidity with long-term economic capacity, leading to a slow erosion of state capacity with potentially disastrous regional consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:47 AM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2026/01/pakistans-sharply-shrinking-economic-sovereignty/)\n\n**Pakistan has become a stable economy: PM Shehbaz**\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared on January 30, 2026, that Pakistan's economy had become 'stable', stating this 'without any hesitation' during an address to major exporters and business figures. He credited the government's efforts for bringing inflation down to 'single digits' and reducing the policy rate to 10.5%, a significant improvement from the previous 21.5\u201322% policy rate and soaring inflation levels. The PM recalled the challenging economic conditions of the past, when uncertainty was widespread, and acknowledged that industrialists and businessmen had faced these difficulties head-on. He expressed hope that Pakistan was now on a path to progress. The statement was made in a speech reported by Dawn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:07 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969891)\n\n**Budget At Economic Crossroads**\nIndia's economic outlook is at a critical juncture, according to HSBC's chief India economist Pranjul Bhandari, as growth signals remain mixed. Real GDP growth has been strong, and credit growth is rising, particularly in sectors like defence, electronics, power, and metals. However, nominal GDP growth is weak, foreign inflows are insufficient to cover the trade deficit, and recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data show signs of slowing momentum after a strong start. The robust growth in 2025 was driven largely by one-time factors\u2014favorable rains, falling oil prices, moderating inflation, and policy easing such as tax cuts and interest rate reductions\u2014which are now largely behind. The key challenge for 2026 is transitioning from informal-sector recovery to formal-sector revival, with capital expenditure (capex) showing early signs of recovery but not yet broad-based. Fiscal policy remains tight, with the central government aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.2% of GDP in FY27 (down from 4.4% in FY26), through continued consolidation and infrastructure spending retention. State government debt ratios are projected to rise due to lack of fiscal discipline, though the 3% fiscal ceiling may begin to constrain state borrowing. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with inflation projected just under the 4% target, allowing room for easing if growth weakens. A combination of tight fiscal and easy monetary policy could benefit bonds, equities, and the rupee, especially after a year of underperformance relative to other emerging markets. However, sustained economic momentum depends on structural reforms: deregulation at central and state levels, reduction of customs duties and non-tariff barriers (e.g., quality control orders), and deeper trade integration with the West and East. Policy transparency, stability, and predictability are critical to lowering investment risks and improving returns. The report concludes that while short-term policy balance can provide a temporary boost, long-term growth hinges on reform implementation and a stable, predictable policy environment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:32 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/column/budget-at-economic-crossroads/20260130.htm)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**RBI's Next Monetary Policy 2026 Hinges on Budget 2026 After Fed Holds Rates**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve decided not to cut interest rates in its January 2026 monetary policy meeting, maintaining rates near 3.6%. This decision, which likely displeased U.S. President Donald Trump who had pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates, reflects the Fed's stance of waiting for clearer signals on growth and inflation before adjusting rates. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is closely watching domestic economic conditions ahead of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from February 4 to 6, 2026, with results expected on February 6. Analysts, including Vinod Nayar of Geojit Financial Services, expect no rate cuts in the immediate next policy meeting, but anticipate at least one reduction in 2026. The timing will depend on the government\u2019s borrowing plans, capital expenditure pace, and fiscal data in the Union Budget 2026. The fiscal deficit for FY27 is projected to be around 4.2% of GDP, slightly lower than FY26\u2019s 4.4%. Capital expenditure is expected to grow by approximately 9% in FY27, potentially reaching 17% higher than the previous year. If fiscal consolidation is prioritized, stable bond yields, controlled inflation, and improved liquidity transmission could boost confidence in future rate cuts. However, concerns remain over the Indian rupee\u2019s weakening trend below its long-term average, exacerbated by attractive global bond yields\u2014Japan at 2-3% and the U.S. at around 4%. Analysts emphasize that with global conditions stable and the Fed holding rates, India\u2019s monetary policy will increasingly depend on domestic factors. Positive fiscal discipline, moderate borrowing, and growth-oriented capital spending could strengthen the RBI\u2019s confidence in adopting a more accommodative policy later.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:43 AM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/budget/budget-2026-fed-has-not-cut-rate-now-rbi-next-monetary-policy-will-depend-on-budget-2026-article-2354042.html)\n\n**PSX sheds over 6,000 points as US-Iran fears hit sentiment**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 6,000 points on January 29, 2026, dropping to a session low of 181,961.14, a decline of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%), after reaching a high of 188,923.39 earlier in the day. The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**Real GDP growth to be 6.8% to 7.2% in FY27: Economic Survey projects steady growth despite global uncertainties - The Tribune**\nThe Economic Survey 2026-2027, tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29, 2026, projects real GDP growth for the financial year 2027 in the range of 6.8% to 7.2%, reflecting steady growth despite global uncertainties. The survey attributes this outlook to the cumulative impact of recent policy reforms, strong domestic drivers, and anchored macroeconomic stability, with the balance of risks around growth described as 'broadly even.' While FY26 was marked by external challenges\u2014including heightened global trade tensions, high penal tariffs, and weakened business confidence\u2014the government responded with key reforms such as GST rationalization, deregulation, and compliance simplification. FY27 is expected to be a year of adjustment, with domestic demand and investment gaining strength. Globally, growth is projected to remain modest, inflation is trending downward, and monetary policies are expected to become more accommodative, though downside risks persist\u2014particularly if the artificial intelligence boom fails to deliver expected productivity gains, potentially triggering financial contagion. For India, external conditions translate into uncertainty rather than immediate stress; slow growth in key trading partners, tariff disruptions, and capital flow volatility may intermittently affect exports and investor sentiment. However, ongoing trade negotiations with the United States are expected to conclude in FY27, potentially reducing external uncertainty. The domestic economy remains resilient, with inflation at historically low levels, healthy balance sheets across households, firms, and banks, and continued public investment supporting activity. Consumption demand is resilient, and private investment intentions are improving. Exports remain robust: merchandise and services exports reached a record $825.3 billion in FY25, with merchandise exports growing 2.4% from April to December 2025 and services exports rising 6.5% during the same period. Despite a 5.9% increase in merchandise imports, the trade deficit was offset by strong services performance. Remittances, which consistently exceed gross FDI inflows, remain a critical pillar of external stability, contributing to a moderate current account deficit of 0.8% of GDP in H1FY26.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/real-gdp-growth-to-be-6-8-to-7-2-in-fy27-economic-survey-projects-steady-growth-despite-global-uncertainties/)\n\n**Economic Survey 2026: What to expect and why it's important**\nThe Economic Survey 2026 was tabled in Parliament on January 29, 2026, under the guidance of Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, serving as the government\u2019s annual comprehensive analysis of India\u2019s economic performance. While it does not announce new policies, the Survey provides the critical economic framework for interpreting the upcoming Union Budget 2026-27. It evaluates India\u2019s economic trajectory in FY25, highlighting strong growth driven by investment activity, services expansion, and government capital spending, with early estimates suggesting performance exceeded prior projections. The Survey assesses the sustainability of this growth, focusing on key sectors including manufacturing, construction, trade, financial services, and the digital economy. Inflation trends, influenced by food price pressures, weather disruptions, and global commodity volatility, are analyzed alongside household consumption responses and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy challenges. Employment and job creation trends across formal and informal sectors, regional disparities, and labor participation\u2014particularly in rural areas\u2014are scrutinized. Fiscal health is examined, with attention to revenue mobilization, fiscal deficit trajectory, and fiscal space for new initiatives amid commitments to capital expenditure and welfare schemes. Sectoral performance in agriculture, manufacturing, services, infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare, and education is reviewed. The Survey also outlines forward-looking reform opportunities in taxation, investment climate, innovation, digital governance, and public sector efficiency, emphasizing resilient supply chains, trade integration, technology-driven productivity, and inclusive growth. As a data-backed assessment, the Survey shapes expectations for the Union Budget and guides economic policy discourse for the year ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:54 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/economic-survey-2026-what-to-expect-and-why-its-important-2859578-2026-01-29)\n\n**PM Announces Rs 4.04 Per Unit Power Tariff Cut For Industry, Incentives For Exporters**\nPrime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif announced significant economic relief measures for Pakistan's industrial and export sectors on January 30, 2026. The government reduced electricity tariffs by Rs 4.04 per unit and wheeling charges to less than Rs 9 for industries. The export refinance scheme rate was cut from 7.5% to 4.5%, with Rs 1,052 billion allocated for the scheme\u2014Rs 900 billion already utilized. Exporters awarded in the 2024-25 fiscal year received two-year blue passports as an incentive. The PM emphasized that export-led growth is essential for Pakistan\u2019s economic revival, stating, 'There is no other way forward. Export-led growth is the only solution for Pakistan's economic future.' He reiterated that future foreign direct investment (FDI) would be restricted to export-oriented projects to boost foreign exchange and strengthen reserves. He credited the stabilization of the economy\u2014marked by inflation dropping to single digits, the policy rate reduced to 10.5%, and foreign exchange reserves doubling (partly due to support from China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar)\u2014to collective efforts, including those of the Chief of Defence Forces and Field Marshal General Asim Munir. The PM also highlighted enforcement actions against sugar mills, which generated Rs 50 billion in additional tax revenue, and the control of petroleum product smuggling, which added Rs 125 billion annually via the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL), attributing this success to strict orders by Field Marshal Munir. The government aims to increase IT exports from $3 billion to $30 billion within five years, with Minister for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja praised for her leadership. The PM urged banks to increase lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify the economy and end the boom-and-bust cycle. He also warned industries against tax evasion, stressing compliance and enforcement. The Commerce Minister affirmed that Pakistan is regaining international recognition due to the PM\u2019s vision and engagement with the business community.

Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with inflation projected just under the 4% target, allowing room for easing if growth weakens. A combination of tight fiscal and easy monetary policy could benefit bonds, equities, and the rupee, especially after a year of underperformance relative to other emerging markets. However, sustained economic momentum depends on structural reforms: deregulation at central and state levels, reduction of customs duties and non-tariff barriers (e.g., quality control orders), and deeper trade integration with the West and East. Policy transparency, stability, and predictability are critical to lowering investment risks and improving returns. The report concludes that while short-term policy balance can provide a temporary boost, long-term growth hinges on reform implementation and a stable, predictable policy environment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:32 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/column/budget-at-economic-crossroads/20260130.htm)\n\n**PSX plunges over 6,000 points amid rising US-Iran tensions**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a sharp decline on January 29, 2026, with the KSE-100 Index losing over 6,000 points, falling from a peak of 188,923.39 to a low of 181,961.14, a drop of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%). This plunge was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to economic analysts, 'Investor sentiment turned negative amid fears of a potential military confrontation between the two countries.' The situation intensified after former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating that time was running out for diplomacy, while highlighting the deployment of a U.S. naval strike group in the region and calling for renewed talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had previously maintained its policy rate at 10.5% for two months, noting that December\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) was 5.6%, in line with expectations, and core inflation remained stable at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) acknowledged strong growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) but expressed concern over a widening trade deficit due to increased imports and weaker exports. Remittances were cited as a stabilizing factor for the current account, and favorable global commodity prices were seen as a positive development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Pakistan Global](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/29-Jan-2026/psx-plunges-over-6000-points-amid-rising-us-iran-tensions/)\n\n**RBI's Next Monetary Policy 2026 Hinges on Budget 2026 After Fed Holds Rates**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve decided not to cut interest rates in its January 2026 monetary policy meeting, maintaining rates near 3.6%. This decision, which likely displeased U.S. President Donald Trump who had pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates, reflects the Fed's stance of waiting for clearer signals on growth and inflation before adjusting rates. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is closely watching domestic economic conditions ahead of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from February 4 to 6, 2026, with results expected on February 6. Analysts, including Vinod Nayar of Geojit Financial Services, expect no rate cuts in the immediate next policy meeting, but anticipate at least one reduction in 2026. The timing will depend on the government\u2019s borrowing plans, capital expenditure pace, and fiscal data in the Union Budget 2026. The fiscal deficit for FY27 is projected to be around 4.2% of GDP, slightly lower than FY26\u2019s 4.4%. Capital expenditure is expected to grow by approximately 9% in FY27, potentially reaching 17% higher than the previous year. If fiscal consolidation is prioritized, stable bond yields, controlled inflation, and improved liquidity transmission could boost confidence in future rate cuts. However, concerns remain over the Indian rupee\u2019s weakening trend below its long-term average, exacerbated by attractive global bond yields\u2014Japan at 2-3% and the U.S. at around 4%. Analysts emphasize that with global conditions stable and the Fed holding rates, India\u2019s monetary policy will increasingly depend on domestic factors. Positive fiscal discipline, moderate borrowing, and growth-oriented capital spending could strengthen the RBI\u2019s confidence in adopting a more accommodative policy later.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:43 AM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/budget/budget-2026-fed-has-not-cut-rate-now-rbi-next-monetary-policy-will-depend-on-budget-2026-article-2354042.html)\n\n**PSX sheds over 6,000 points as US-Iran fears hit sentiment**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 6,000 points on January 29, 2026, dropping to a session low of 181,961.14, a decline of 6,419.24 points (-3.41%), after reaching a high of 188,923.39 earlier in the day. The market decline was driven by heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with US President Donald Trump warning Iran that time was running out to avoid military action, citing a naval strike group in the region and urging negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. According to AAH Soomro, an independent investment and economic analyst, the market was 'jittering owing to potential Iran and US conflict' and 'a lesser-than-expected earnings result in FFC [Fauji Fertiliser Company]' caused the market to lose 3,500 points in a short period. Soomro described the drop as 'a good and timely correction' given a lackluster earnings season and the need for consolidation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had kept the policy rate unchanged at 10.5% for two months, citing headline CPI of 5.6% in December as in line with expectations and core inflation at 7.4%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted stronger-than-expected high-frequency activity, a wider trade deficit due to higher imports, softer exports, and a contained current account supported by remittances and benign global commodity prices. Despite unchanged inflation and external outlooks, the MPC judged it prudent to hold rates to anchor price stability and support sustainable growth. On the prior day, Wednesday, January 28, the KSE-100 had risen 177.53 points (0.09%) to close at 188,380.39, trading between 189,183.88 and 188,179.51.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/647857-psx-sheds-over-6000-points-as-us-iran-fears-hit-sentiment)\n\n**Real GDP growth to be 6.8% to 7.2% in FY27: Economic Survey projects steady growth despite global uncertainties - The Tribune**\nThe Economic Survey 2026-2027, tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29, 2026, projects real GDP growth for the financial year 2027 in the range of 6.8% to 7.2%, reflecting steady growth despite global uncertainties. The survey attributes this outlook to the cumulative impact of recent policy reforms, strong domestic drivers, and anchored macroeconomic stability, with the balance of risks around growth described as 'broadly even.' While FY26 was marked by external challenges\u2014including heightened global trade tensions, high penal tariffs, and weakened business confidence\u2014the government responded with key reforms such as GST rationalization, deregulation, and compliance simplification. FY27 is expected to be a year of adjustment, with domestic demand and investment gaining strength. Globally, growth is projected to remain modest, inflation is trending downward, and monetary policies are expected to become more accommodative, though downside risks persist\u2014particularly if the artificial intelligence boom fails to deliver expected productivity gains, potentially triggering financial contagion. For India, external conditions translate into uncertainty rather than immediate stress; slow growth in key trading partners, tariff disruptions, and capital flow volatility may intermittently affect exports and investor sentiment. However, ongoing trade negotiations with the United States are expected to conclude in FY27, potentially reducing external uncertainty. The domestic economy remains resilient, with inflation at historically low levels, healthy balance sheets across households, firms, and banks, and continued public investment supporting activity. Consumption demand is resilient, and private investment intentions are improving. Exports remain robust: merchandise and services exports reached a record $825.3 billion in FY25, with merchandise exports growing 2.4% from April to December 2025 and services exports rising 6.5% during the same period. Despite a 5.9% increase in merchandise imports, the trade deficit was offset by strong services performance. Remittances, which consistently exceed gross FDI inflows, remain a critical pillar of external stability, contributing to a moderate current account deficit of 0.8% of GDP in H1FY26.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/real-gdp-growth-to-be-6-8-to-7-2-in-fy27-economic-survey-projects-steady-growth-despite-global-uncertainties/)\n\n**Economic Survey 2026: What to expect and why it's important**\nThe Economic Survey 2026 was tabled in Parliament on January 29, 2026, under the guidance of Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, serving as the government\u2019s annual comprehensive analysis of India\u2019s economic performance. While it does not announce new policies, the Survey provides the critical economic framework for interpreting the upcoming Union Budget 2026-27. It evaluates India\u2019s economic trajectory in FY25, highlighting strong growth driven by investment activity, services expansion, and government capital spending, with early estimates suggesting performance exceeded prior projections. The Survey assesses the sustainability of this growth, focusing on key sectors including manufacturing, construction, trade, financial services, and the digital economy. Inflation trends, influenced by food price pressures, weather disruptions, and global commodity volatility, are analyzed alongside household consumption responses and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy challenges. Employment and job creation trends across formal and informal sectors, regional disparities, and labor participation\u2014particularly in rural areas\u2014are scrutinized. Fiscal health is examined, with attention to revenue mobilization, fiscal deficit trajectory, and fiscal space for new initiatives amid commitments to capital expenditure and welfare schemes. Sectoral performance in agriculture, manufacturing, services, infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare, and education is reviewed. The Survey also outlines forward-looking reform opportunities in taxation, investment climate, innovation, digital governance, and public sector efficiency, emphasizing resilient supply chains, trade integration, technology-driven productivity, and inclusive growth. As a data-backed assessment, the Survey shapes expectations for the Union Budget and guides economic policy discourse for the year ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:54 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/economic-survey-2026-what-to-expect-and-why-its-important-2859578-2026-01-29)\n\n**Rebuilding reserves**\nThe State Bank of Pakistan kept interest rates unchanged in January 2026, surprising some observers, as it signaled that the battle against inflation has been won, but the effort to rebuild foreign exchange reserves remains ongoing. Since July 2023, Pakistan faced a severe economic crisis, narrowly avoiding sovereign default, which was averted by a $6 billion bailout from the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Inflation peaked at 38% year-on-year in May 2023, and the rupee lost nearly two-thirds of its value between 2021 and 2023. Two IMF programs followed: a Stand-by Arrangement in July 2023 and an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 2024, which remains active. At the start of the EFF, Pakistan\u2019s Net International Reserves (NIR) were negative $11 billion, indicating liabilities exceeded reserves. The IMF targeted a return to positive reserves by 2028. By September 2025, NIR had improved to negative $6.6 billion, and by June 2026, they were projected at negative $4.8 billion\u2014progress, but still negative. The State Bank has been aggressively buying dollars from banks, sometimes exceeding IMF targets, such as purchasing over $1 billion monthly in September and October 2025. Despite this, the reserve rebuilding process is expected to continue for another 12 to 18 months. The State Bank cited rising economic momentum and a widening trade deficit due to increased imports as reasons for caution, noting a $1.2 billion current account deficit from July to December 2025. Although manageable, the risk of a resurgence in the trade deficit threatening reserves remains high. The Bank\u2019s decision to hold rates steady reflects its focus on stabilizing external accounts, as economic growth forecasts were upgraded to 3.75\u20134.75% for FY26, with potential for further strengthening in FY27.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:48 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1969666)\n\n**Pakistan to seek flexibility on IMF loans ahead of next budget**\nPakistan is preparing to seek a 'lenient attitude' from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and renegotiate the remaining terms of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.4 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), aiming to complete the programme by September 2027. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, is scheduled to meet IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on January 21, 2026, to discuss the request. The government seeks fiscal flexibility for the 2026\u201327 budget, citing economic challenges including a 43% decline in foreign direct investment and a current account deficit of $1.2 billion in the first half of the fiscal year (July\u2013Dec 2025). The economy is projected to grow at close to 4% GDP, surpassing the IMF\u2019s revised forecast of 3.25\u20133.5%, though the current account deficit is expected to remain between $2.2 and $2.3 billion by June 2026, with exports around $32 billion and imports between $72 and $76 billion. Remittances are projected at $42 billion. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is struggling to meet revised tax targets, prompting the government to consider raising the petroleum levy. Four key proposals are under discussion: export-led growth, boosting investment via the Special Investment Facilitation Council, reducing power tariffs to enhance industrial competitiveness, and offering tax incentives. The government has proposed gradually reducing the manufacturing sector\u2019s super tax from 35% to 5% over four years, with full abolition in the fifth year if a primary surplus is achieved. The minimum income threshold for super tax is to be raised from Rs200 million to Rs500 million, and the 10% super tax threshold from Rs500 million to Rs1.5 billion. The government also seeks to cut the policy rate in light of declining inflation and to set specific lending targets for banks to boost private sector credit, especially for SMEs. The IMF\u2019s third review mission is expected in February or March 2026 to assess progress and release the fourth tranche of the EFF. Approval of the new industrial policy, including tax reforms, remains pending with the IMF.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 07:34 AM\nSource:[GEO TV](https://www.geo.tv/latest/646128-pakistan-to-seek-flexibility-on-imf-loans-ahead-of-next-budget)\n\n**Beyond stabilization: The next challenge for Pakistan\u2019s economy**\nPakistan's economy has achieved significant stabilization, according to Dr. Aqdas Afzal, as major macroeconomic indicators show marked improvement since 2023. Inflation, which peaked at 38% in May 2023, had declined to 6.1% by November 2025, aided by falling international oil prices\u2014Brent crude dropped from $97 in September 2023 to around $62\u2014and the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) tight monetary policy, guided by the Taylor Rule and responsive to U.S. Federal Reserve rate changes. The SBP recently cut rates by 50 basis points following a U.S. rate reduction, signaling policy flexibility. Externally, Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2 billion (0.5% of GDP) in FY2025\u2014the best performance in 14 years\u2014compared to a $17.5 billion deficit in FY2022, and foreign exchange reserves rose to nearly $16 billion, up from below $3 billion in February 2023. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit narrowed to -5.4% of GDP in FY2025, a 2.5 percentage point improvement from FY2022, and the country achieved a primary fiscal surplus of 2.4%, a critical step toward reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. Despite these gains, the economy remains in a state of 'unstable stability,' vulnerable to shocks. Economic growth remains weak, failing to generate the 1.5 million jobs annually needed to absorb Pakistan\u2019s growing population of nearly 5 million new entrants. To address this, policymakers must shift from stabilization to fostering resilient, inclusive growth by prioritizing youth-centered strategies, such as promoting entrepreneurship, modernizing education in science and technology, and expanding skills training\u2014similar to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030. The writer emphasizes that the next challenge is to transition from rescue to sustainable growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[arabnews.pk](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2628082)\n\n**Pakistan's Current Account Deficit to Worsen in FY27: World Bank**\nAccording to the World Bank's latest Global Economic Prospects report, Pakistan's current account deficit is projected to widen in fiscal year 2026\u201327 due to rising imports and a return of remittances to normal levels, increasing external financing pressures. The World Bank forecasts Pakistan's economic growth at 3 percent for the current fiscal year\u20140.1 percentage points lower than its June 2025 projection and below the government\u2019s 4.2 percent target. Growth is expected to improve to 3.4 percent in FY27. The report attributes this improvement to agricultural recovery following recent floods and ongoing reconstruction activities, as well as easing inflation driven by lower food prices. Despite recent interest rate cuts, monetary policy remains cautious. The report warns that higher U.S. tariffs could harm Pakistan\u2019s exports, while trade sanctions and policy uncertainty may negatively impact the regional economy. Positive signs include increased industrial activity and higher bank lending. Globally, economic growth is projected at 2.6 percent in 2026 and 2.7 percent in 2027, with the World Bank noting that the living standards gap between developing and advanced economies continues to widen.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 06:30 PM\nSource:[ProPakistani](https://propakistani.pk/2026/01/13/pakistans-current-account-deficit-to-worsen-in-fy27-world-bank/)\n\n**Monetary Policy Needs Softening**\nThe article argues that monetary policy in Pakistan needs to be softened, despite recent marginal rate reductions. Trade and industry have long criticized the current stance, and while the reduction aligns with global trends\u2014most central banks, both developed and developing, have recently lowered rates\u2014it was poorly timed. Inflation hit a low of 0.3% in April 2025, making that the ideal moment for a cut, but by November 2025, inflation had risen to 6.2%, indicating a reversal in the inflationary trend. This shift strengthens the argument that demand-contracting monetary policy is ineffective against cost-push inflation and may have unintended side effects, consistent with Goodhart's Law. The Taylor Rule, a widely used empirical guideline for setting policy rates based on inflation and output gaps, suggests that Pakistan\u2019s fragile recovery stage demands a significantly lower policy rate. Although monetary policy influences both inflation and output in the short run, as seen in Pakistan, it faces challenges due to time lags, inadequate data, and technical capacity in developing economies. While lower rates would ease public debt servicing, the banking sector may suffer from reduced interest spreads, though it is expected to absorb the impact. The article emphasizes that monetary policy should be selectively used, with real variables like production better addressed through supply-side reforms. The Laffer Curve theory is cited to support the idea that excessively high taxes reduce revenue and growth. Ultimately, public confidence and expectations\u2014highlighted by Keynesian insights\u2014are critical for sustainable economic success. The author, Saghir Mushtaq, an economist at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, concludes that a more accommodative monetary policy is both necessary and expected by industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/01-Jan-2026/monetary-policy-needs-softening)\n\n**Renewed economic confidence \u2013 Pakistan & Gulf Economist**\nPakistan's economy showed significant improvement in 2025, marked by a dramatic decline in inflation, which fell from double digits in 2023 to a low of 0.3% in April 2025\u2014the lowest in nearly ten years. This was achieved through consistent monetary tightening by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2024, followed by a measured rate cut of 100 basis points in January 2025, signaling the end of the worst inflationary phase. The decline in inflation, supported by falling global commodity prices, improved domestic food supply, and anchored expectations, led to recovering purchasing power and rising consumer confidence across urban and rural areas. The external position strengthened due to policy coherence between fiscal and monetary authorities, enabling timely disbursements from the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility. This improved credibility allowed the government to negotiate better rollover terms for bilateral and multilateral debt, easing 2026 repayment pressure. GDP growth for 2025 was modest at 2.7% (IMF estimate), but the composition of growth improved: agriculture rebounded with better wheat, cotton, and rice output; industry revived in Q3 due to small-scale manufacturing and infrastructure-linked construction; and export sectors like textiles and pharmaceuticals benefited from stable energy and exchange rates. Investor confidence returned, evidenced by a rising Pakistan Stock Exchange, foreign portfolio inflows, narrowing sovereign risk spreads, and a stable rupee. Looking ahead, the IMF and World Bank project 2026 GDP growth above 3%, with inflation expected to remain below 5%, allowing room for further monetary easing. However, structural challenges\u2014low productivity, limited fiscal space, and climate vulnerabilities\u2014remain.

This improvement is attributed to favorable global trends, including increased oil output from OPEC+ as production cuts are unwound, which benefits oil exporters, and low energy prices, robust remittances, and a strong tourism sector, which support oil importers like Pakistan. Jihad Azour, Director of the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department, stated that growth is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2026, with inflation remaining moderate due to lower food and energy prices and tight monetary policies. The IMF's latest Regional Economic Outlook Report forecasts Pakistan\u2019s GDP to reach 4.5% over the next five years. The Fund acknowledged progress on economic reforms, noting improvements in financial stability, positive trends in remittances and the current account position during fiscal year 2024-25, and a decline in inflation earlier in 2025 due to lower food and energy prices. However, the report warns that inflation may rise in 2025-26 as energy subsidies end and electricity tariffs normalize. Structural reforms in energy and tax sectors have stabilized revenue and improved investor confidence, with continued efforts expected to boost growth and resilience. The IMF also cautioned that severe floods in the third quarter of 2025 could negatively impact growth, inflation, and the current account balance, though the scale remains uncertain. Regional tensions are also seen as a potential drag on growth across the region, including Pakistan. Despite these risks, the IMF affirmed that Pakistan\u2019s economy is showing steady recovery and resilience, with gradual improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals. The Fund emphasized that with consistent reform implementation\u2014especially in energy pricing and fiscal management\u2014Pakistan\u2019s medium-term growth outlook remains positive and expected to accelerate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[ProPakistani](https://propakistani.pk/?p=938839)\n\n**IMF warns of rising inflation, current account deficit**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected Pakistan's economic growth at 3.6% for the current fiscal year, higher than the World Bank's 2.6% forecast, though this estimate does not yet account for the economic impact of the 2025 summer floods, which remain under assessment. The IMF's World Economic Outlook (October 2025) report projects global growth to slow to 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, down from 3.3% in 2024, with advanced economies growing at about 1.5% in 2025\u201326 (the U.S. at 2%) and emerging markets and developing economies moderating to just above 4%.

World trade volume is forecast to grow at 2.9% annually in 2025\u201326, slightly below the 3.5% rate in 2024, due to persistent trade fragmentation. The IMF warned of downside risks, including prolonged policy uncertainty, protectionist measures (including non-tariff barriers), restrictive immigration policies, fiscal vulnerabilities, financial market fragilities, and potential abrupt repricing of tech stocks if AI-driven productivity gains disappoint. Pakistan\u2019s inflation is projected to rise to 6% from 4.5% in the prior year, and its current account balance is expected to shift from a 0.5% surplus to a 0.4% deficit. The Fund emphasized that low-income countries face heightened vulnerability due to reduced official aid flows, with unemployment and lack of opportunity risking social unrest. Central bank credibility is under pressure, and the IMF urged policies to restore confidence, stabilize trade, reduce uncertainty, rebuild fiscal space, maintain independent yet transparent monetary policy, and prioritize long-term investments in innovation, productivity, education, infrastructure, and multilateral cooperation over costly subsidies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:49 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1948980)\n\n**IMF forecasts economic growth for Pakistan**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released its Outlook Report, forecasting positive economic growth for Pakistan.

The World Bank notes that as an oil-importing nation, Pakistan remains vulnerable to global energy price volatility and tariff shocks, which exacerbate currency pressures and inflation [9][12]. This has widened the current account deficit (16.1% of GDP projected for 2026) [12].\n\n2. **Debt Burden and Fiscal Constraints**  \n   Public debt remains critically high, with emerging economies like Pakistan carrying their highest debt levels in 50+ years [9][11]. Fiscal buffers are thin, limiting the government's ability to stimulate the economy or fund social programs [11][12].\n\n3. **Structural Unemployment and Inequality**  \n   Despite regional growth projections (3.6% for Middle East/North Africa/Afghanistan/Pakistan region) [7][8], wealth disparities are worsening. Per capita income growth is lagging, and approximately 16% of Pakistanis live below $4.20/day [12][16]. Labor markets struggle to absorb 1.2 billion young entrants forecasted across developing economies this decade [8][12].\n\n### Monetary Policy Trends\n1. **Climate-Focused Industrial Policy**  \n   A landmark Rs 100 billion ($360M) electric vehicle (EV) subsidy program (2025-2030) is central to Pakistan's strategy [16]. Backed by the IMF, it includes:\n   - Rs 50,000 subsidies per electric 2/3-wheeler\n   - Charging infrastructure investments\n   - Battery-swapping systems  \n   *Goal*: 30% EV penetration by 2030 to cut fuel imports and emissions [16].\n\n2. **External Sector Stabilization Efforts**  \n   The State Bank of Pakistan is prioritizing:\n   - Foreign reserve accumulation via projects like the Reko Diq copper-gold mine (developed with Barrick Mining) to boost exports [3]\n   - Gradual liberalization of exchange controls under IMF guidance [16]\n\n3. **Regionally Coordinated Approach**  \n   Pakistan is aligning with MENAP (Middle East/North Africa/Afghanistan/Pakistan) initiatives focused on:\n   - Private investment attraction [9][13]\n   - Digital transformation to counter demographic pressures [9][11]\n   - Cross-border infrastructure partnerships (e.g., with GCC nations) [13]\n\n### Conflicting Perspectives & Limitations\n- **Optimism**: World Bank projections (3.6% regional growth in 2026) cite diversification efforts and IMF reforms as tailwinds [7][8][16].  \n- **Pessimism**: Algerian Central Bank Governor Talb warns that geopolitical tensions and trade tariffs could derail recovery [9][11].  \n- **Data Gaps**: Recent granular data on inflation, forex reserves, and manufacturing output remains limited since most reports predate January 2026 [3][7][12][16].\n\nIn summary, Pakistan's 2026 economy balances ambitious green industrialization against entrenched inflation, debt, and inequality challenges, with monetary policy tightly linked to IMF programs and regional cooperation. For real-time indicators (e.g., Q1 2026 inflation figures), specialized financial database searches would be needed.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
