## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **April measurements 2010-2025** - Most direct reference class
   - Captures seasonal peak behavior specifically for April
   - Accounts for month-specific patterns
   - Most suitable for this forecast

2. **Annual increases 2015-2025** - Recent acceleration period
   - Shows trend in growth rate
   - OEHHA notes ~2.5 ppm/year recent trend
   - Useful for understanding momentum

3. **Monthly sequential changes December→April** - Seasonal transition
   - December 2025 is known (427.49 ppm)
   - Need to add typical Dec-Apr seasonal increase
   - Captures intra-year dynamics

**Selected Reference Class:** April measurements 2010-2025, supplemented by December 2025→April 2026 seasonal pattern analysis.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** ~90 days from January 30, 2026 to April 2026 measurement

**Historical April Patterns:**
From the sources:
- May 2025: 430.2 ppm (peak season)
- December 2025: 427.49 ppm (post-autumn low)
- April typically falls during Northern Hemisphere spring peak

**Seasonal Dynamics:**
- CO2 peaks in spring (April-May) due to Northern Hemisphere winter decomposition
- Lowest in autumn (September-October) after summer plant growth
- April is near the annual maximum

**Recent Growth Rates:**
- 2023-2024: +3.58 ppm (record, El Niño driven)
- 2024-2025: ~2.09-2.26 ppm (La Niña moderation)
- Long-term recent: ~2.5 ppm/year average

**December 2025 to April 2026 Expected Change:**
- Seasonal increase from winter low to spring peak: typically 3-4 ppm based on NASA's description of the sawtooth pattern
- December 2025: 427.49 ppm
- Expected April 2026 baseline: 427.49 + 3.0 to 4.0 = 430.5-431.5 ppm

## (d) Justification

**Base Calculation:**
Starting from December 2025 (427.49 ppm), I need to account for:

1. **Seasonal increase (Dec→Apr):** The NASA source clearly states CO2 is "highest in spring" with a sawtooth pattern. The May 2025 measurement of 430.2 ppm represents a peak. Working backward, April 2025 would be slightly below this, perhaps 429.5-430.0 ppm. If December 2024 was 425.40 ppm, the Dec-Apr seasonal increase was approximately 4.0-4.6 ppm.

2. **Year-over-year growth:** The Met Office predicts moderated growth in 2025 due to La Niña (2.26 ppm annual). However, December 2024→2025 showed only 2.09 ppm growth, suggesting the La Niña effect is real. For April 2025→2026, I expect similar moderation: approximately 2.0-2.5 ppm year-over-year increase.

3. **Combining factors:**
   - December 2025: 427.49 ppm
   - Add seasonal increase: +3.5 to 4.5 ppm → 431.0-432.0 ppm
   - This represents the April 2026 peak expectation

4. **Cross-check with year-over-year:**
   - April 2025 estimate: ~429.8 ppm (slightly below May 2025's 430.2)
   - Add annual growth of 2.0-2.5 ppm → 431.8-432.3 ppm
   - This aligns well with the seasonal calculation

**Central estimate:** 431.5-432.0 ppm

**Uncertainty factors:**
- ENSO variability (La Niña may persist or weaken)
- Volcanic/wildfire emissions unpredictability
- Measurement uncertainty (±0.1-0.2 ppm typical)
- Political disruption risk (observatory closure mentioned but unlikely by April)
- Seasonal pattern variation year-to-year

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Known Data:**
- December 2025: 427.49 ppm (certain)
- May 2025: 430.2 ppm (certain)
- April typically 0.2-0.5 ppm below May peak

**Distribution Shape:**
Given the strong seasonal forcing and well-understood growth trends, this should be a relatively tight distribution. However, I need to account for:
- Natural variability in seasonal amplitude (±0.5 ppm)
- Growth rate uncertainty (La Niña strength, emission variations: ±0.5 ppm)
- Measurement/interpolation uncertainty (±0.2 ppm)

**Historical Upset Rate:**
CO2 measurements are highly predictable with well-understood physics. Major upsets (like the 2023-2024 El Niño spike) are rare but possible. The 2022 eruption caused data gaps but not measurement errors. Upset rate is low (~5% for >1 ppm deviation from trend).

**90% Confidence Interval Construction:**
- Central estimate: 431.8 ppm
- 10th percentile: Should account for weaker seasonal peak + slower growth = 430.5 ppm
- 90th percentile: Should account for stronger seasonal peak + faster growth = 433.0 ppm
- Range: 2.5 ppm (reasonable given historical variability)

**Intermediate Percentiles:**
Assuming approximately normal distribution around 431.8 ppm with σ ≈ 0.8 ppm:
- 10th: 431.8 - 1.28σ = 430.8 ppm
- 20th: 431.8 - 0.84σ = 431.1 ppm
- 40th: 431.8 - 0.25σ = 431.6 ppm
- 60th: 431.8 + 0.25σ = 432.0 ppm
- 80th: 431.8 + 0.84σ = 432.5 ppm
- 90th: 431.8 + 1.28σ = 432.8 ppm

Rounding to one decimal place for precision appropriate to measurement uncertainty.
