Analysis:
• Source Analysis:
  – The Met Office forecast (June 2025 article) provided an annual average CO₂ concentration for 2025 of about 426.6 ppm along with a predicted annual increase of roughly 2.3 ppm. This source is authoritative and authored by recognized climate scientists. Its factual elements include annual averages and expected ENSO influences affecting CO₂ growth.
  – The Tech Explorist article (June 2025) reported that May 2025 reached 430.2 ppm—the first seasonal peak above 430. This concrete measurement, sourced from NOAA and Scripps with expert quotes, is reliable for recent monthly values.
  – The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory summary gives the most recent monthly measurement for December 2025 as 427.49 ppm and describes the method and seasonal adjustments. Being NOAA’s own report makes this source highly credible.
  – The Agent Report concerning the retrieval of the Mauna Loa CO₂ monthly series confirms that the monthly means (including 2025) are available and that the data series has been updated. It is factual and details data quality caveats.
  
• Reference Class Analysis:
  Several reference classes are relevant:
  - Historical annual trends at Mauna Loa over recent years (with annual increases in the range of 2–3.5 ppm).
  - The seasonal cycle, where spring months (April–May) typically register the highest CO₂ values. For example, May 2025 averaged 430.2 ppm.
  - Short‐term monthly progression (e.g. December 2025 at 427.49 ppm rising to a spring peak resembling the previous cycle’s increase of roughly 4.5–5 ppm from December to May).
  The most suitable reference class here is the combination of the recent seasonal cycle observed at Mauna Loa (accounting for month‐to‐month movement) and the annual growth trend.

• Timeframe Analysis:
  The prediction target is for April 2026, approximately three months from today (January 30, 2026), with the full month's data finalized by May 1, 2026. Historical patterns indicate that during the late winter to spring transition, CO₂ measurements tend to rise as the seasonal cycle progresses toward the spring peak; in recent records, the increase from December to May has been in the order of 4.5–5 ppm.

• Justification:
  Combining the sources we see that the December 2025 value is 427.49 ppm and the previous seasonal cycle (from December to the peak month, May) increased by roughly 4.8 ppm (with May 2025 at 430.2 ppm versus perhaps an expected seasonal peak around 432–433 ppm in 2026 when accounting for the annual growth). The Met Office forecast indicates an annual growth of about 2.3 ppm, which when added to the 2025 annual average (426.6 ppm) gives an approximate 2026 annual average of 428.9 ppm. With a seasonal amplitude of about 3.6 ppm above the annual average (as in 2025, where 430.2 ppm was about 3.6 ppm over 426.6 ppm), a simple extrapolation suggests a spring (April) value in 2026 in the low-to-mid 432 ppm range. However, noting that April tends to be slightly below the absolute maximum (typically reached in May) a modest downward adjustment (around 1 ppm) appears appropriate. Thus, a point estimate around 431.3 ppm emerges. Given typical uncertainties—a combination of slight variability in the seasonal progression and the influence of ENSO conditions—a calibrated probability interval with wide 90/10 bounds is warranted.

Outside view calibration:
Recognizing natural variability and the potential for small unexpected adjustments due to short‐term climate fluctuations, I set a distribution that spreads over roughly a 4–5 ppm range. I incorporate past data variability (typically a few tenths of a ppm month‐to‐month but 1–2 ppm uncertainty on a seasonal scale) and uncertainty from measurement interpolation in early 2026. This results in a 90% confidence interval that is sufficiently wide to cover unknown unknowns without being overconfident.
