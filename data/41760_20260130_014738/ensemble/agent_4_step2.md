Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)  
  a. NOAA GML “Trends in CO₂” (updated 5 Jan 2026).  Primary data owner, gives December 2025 global mean 427.49 ppm.  Factual, very high quality, no opinions.  
  b. NASA Earth-Indicators page (25 Sep 2025).  Cites Mauna Loa December 2025 value 427 ppm; essentially confirms NOAA number.  High quality.  
  c. SmithsonianMag (20 Jun 2025).  Reports May 2025 Mauna Loa 430.2 ppm and year-to-year jump of 3.58 ppm (2023→2024).  Factual values trace to NOAA/Scripps; moderate–high quality.  
  d. Met Office/Carbon Brief article (June 2025, not in extract but referenced) forecasting 2025 annual growth ≈ 2.3 ppm.  Methodology published, expert source; moderate evidence.  
  e. Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Doomsday Clock statement (Jan 2026).  Notes 2024 jump 3.5 ppm and political threat to NOAA observations.  Factual jump is corroborated by NOAA; the threat is opinion.  Mixed quality (facts reliable, opinion discounted).  

2. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
  Strong:  
  • Multi-decadal Mauna Loa seasonal cycle – April is always 2.5 – 3.5 ppm above December.  
  • Long-term growth trend 2015-2025 averages 2.4 ppm y⁻¹.  
  Moderate:  
  • 2024 exceptional increase of 3.5 ppm shows upper tail of plausible growth.  
  • Expert (Met Office) outlook of slightly smaller 2025–26 growth (~2.3 ppm).  
  Weak:  
  • Possible interruption of NOAA funding.  No operational cut yet; Scripps would likely continue.  

3. Time-frame analysis  
  Target is April 2026, three full months away (≈ 90 days).  Halving the horizon (mid-March) would lower the seasonal uplift by ~1 ppm; doubling (end-July) would include the post-peak draw-down of ~1.5 ppm.  Thus the mean would shift down about 1 ppm in either direction.  

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
  Outside-view base rate:  
  • December 2025 level 427.5 ppm.  
  • Mean recent seasonal rise Dec → Apr = +2.8 ppm (2019-2025 average).  
  • Expected April 2026 if no growth: 430.3 ppm.  
  Annual growth component: median 2.4 ppm y⁻¹.  Add 0.8 ppm (one-third of year) = +0.8 ppm.  
  Baseline point ≈ 431.1 ppm.  

  Inside-view tweaks:  
  +0.5 ppm  (El Niño conditions lingered through early 2025 and usually add ≈0.3 ppm to growth; some carry-over likely).  
  –0.1 ppm  (2024 jump was extreme; regression toward mean probable).  
  Net point estimate ≈ 431.5 ppm → choose 432.0 ppm as clearer central value.  

  Uncertainty:  
  • Inter-annual growth SD ≈ 0.6 ppm.  
  • Seasonal-cycle SD for Apr ≈ 0.25 ppm.  
  • Potential measurement/operational risk equivalent to ±0.3 ppm.  
  Combine → σ ≈ 0.75 ppm.  90 % interval ≈ ±1.6 ppm.  Clip to hint bounds 420–435 ppm.  

Probability calibration
Implied median 432.2 ppm; mean 432.1 ppm.  This is consistent with past peaks (May 25 = 430.2 ppm) plus expected growth.

Checklist:
1. Target: Mauna Loa monthly mean CO₂, April 2026, ppm.  
2. Base rate: 431.1 ppm.  
3. Consistency: median 432.2; mean 432.1; plausible vs history.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Dec 25 value 427.5 ppm.  
   – Seasonal rise Dec-Apr ≈ 2.8 ppm.  
   – Long-term growth 2.4 ppm y⁻¹.  
   – 2024 spike indicates high tail but regression likely.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden large tropical‐fire or ENSO-amplified jump adding >1 ppm extra; would push outcome above 434 ppm.
