Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

   • NOAA GML “Trends in CO₂” page (updated 5 Jan 2026).  Primary, quality-controlled Mauna Loa and global data through Dec 2025.  Pure fact, no opinion.  Strong.

   • NOAA Mauna Loa daily data portal (last modified 24 Jan 2026).  Confirms data collection continues.  Fact only.  Strong.

   • Met Office forecast press note (Dec 2025, reported by Carbon Brief & Tech Explorist).  Predicts 2025–26 global growth 2.26 ± 0.56 ppm, expects transition to weak La Niña.  Method described, long track-record.  Moderate–strong.

   • NASA Earth-indicator page (Sep 2025).  Restates 427 ppm Dec 2025, explains seasonal cycle.  Secondary but reliable.  Moderate.

   • Smithsonian (Jan 2025) & Sydney Morning Herald (Jan 2026) articles.  Quote Scripps/NOAA numbers, note record 3.6 ppm jump 2023–24.  Journalistic, factual elements OK, opinions mostly commentary.  Weak–moderate.

   • Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Jan 2026) on possible NOAA cutbacks.  Opinion piece; funding threat real but data still flowing 30 Jan 2026.  Weak short-term relevance.

   • Volcano / weather notices (Jan 2026).  Unrelated to atmospheric CO₂ at 4000 m, no discernible effect.  Ignored.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)

   Strong evidence  
   – NOAA time-series shows April 2025 mean 428.98 ppm; decade-long mean growth ≈ 2.4 ppm yr⁻¹.  
   – ENSO link: El Niño years add ~0.5 ppm; La Niña subtracts ~0.3 ppm (Friedlingstein et al. 2022, confirmed in Met Office update).

   Moderate evidence  
   – Met Office 2026 forecast: 2.26 ± 0.56 ppm global rise.  
   – Record 2024 growth (3.6 ppm) unlikely to repeat; regression to mean expected.  
   – Data continuity likely—NOAA portal live; Scripps parallel program provides redundancy.

   Weak evidence  
   – Political funding threats; could lapse publication but not measurement (batteries plus Scripps).  
   – Volcano SO₂ or Hawaiian snow events: negligible for global CO₂ over 3 months.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Today → target midpoint (15 Apr 2026) ≈ 76 days.  In this window the seasonal ramp normally adds 0.8 ± 0.1 ppm.  If timeframe halved, seasonal component uncertainty dominates; distribution width would shrink about 20 %.  If doubled (predict Oct 2026) anthropogenic growth plus ENSO state changes would enlarge σ by ~40 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  

   Baseline (outside view):  
     April 2025 = 428.98 ppm.  Mean long-term growth = +2.4 ppm → naive 431.4 ppm.

   Adjustments:  
     – Weak La Niña expected (−0.3 ppm) → 431.1 ppm.  
     – Continuing fossil-fuel emissions slightly elevated versus 2010s (+0.1 ppm) → 431.2 ppm.  
     – Measurement calibration drift (±0.1 ppm) → no mean shift, adds variance.  

   Uncertainty (1-sigma):  
     Anthropogenic growth 0.55 ppm (Met Office)  
     ENSO / carbon-cycle noise 0.35 ppm  
     Calibration / sampling 0.10 ppm  
     Combined (quadrature) 0.66 ppm; inflate 25 % for fat tails → 0.83 ppm.

   Resulting distribution: Normal(μ = 431.2 ppm, σ = 0.83 ppm), truncated to 420–435 ppm (no practical effect).

Probability calibration

   Mean ≈ median ≈ 431.2 ppm.  90 % interval 429.8–432.6 ppm aligns with historical outliers (~10 % of years exceed 1.6 ppm from mean).

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Mauna Loa April 2026 monthly mean CO₂, ppm.  
2. Outside-view base rate: April YoY rise 2.4 ppm.  
3. Consistency check: implied median = 431.2, mean = 431.2, fits justification.  
4. Key evidence (20 words each)  
   – NOAA April 2025 value 428.98 ppm.  
   – Decade average growth 2.4 ppm yr⁻¹.  
   – Met Office forecast 2.26 ppm rise, La Niña.  
   – ENSO modulation −0.3 ppm for La Niña springs.  
5. Blind-spot: Instrument shutdown in March 2026; Scripps backup fails → data gap or biased low, pushing outcome undefined or low.
