Analysis:
To forecast the April 2026 monthly average at Mauna Loa, I need:
• The most recent reported monthly averages (Dec 2025–Jan 2026) to establish the current baseline.  
• The year-over-year growth rate (ppm per year) seen in 2023-2025, since CO₂ at Mauna Loa has risen ~2-3 ppm annually but can vary with El Niño/La Niña, wildfires, and economic factors.  
• April values from previous years (e.g., Apr 2023, Apr 2024, Apr 2025) to capture the seasonal cycle and quantify the typical February-to-April rise (usually +1 to +2 ppm).  
Recent news releases, NOAA/Scripps updates, or scientific commentary specifically mentioning preliminary 2026 data or updated growth-rate analyses would be most useful.
