Analysis:
The task is to forecast the April 2026 monthly‐mean CO₂ concentration at Mauna Loa.  
For a baseline (outside‐view) estimate we need:  
• The April values for (at least) the last 10–15 years to see the regular seasonal peak just before the annual maximum in May.  
• Year-over-year growth rates (April-to-April) that have recently averaged ≈ 2–3 ppm, with short-term boosts from El Niño years (e.g., 2016, 2023–24).  
• Any anomalies caused by the 2022-23 instrumentation outage at Mauna Loa (data were back-filled from Maunakea) to confirm continuity.  
Collecting those historical April means plus the linear trend or, better, a regression with a seasonal component, will give the most relevant context for an outside-view projection of April 2026.
