Forecasting Question:
What will be the monthly average CO2 concentration (in ppm) recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory for April 2026?

Question background:
Encyclopedia Britannica [Keeling Curve](https://www.britannica.com/science/Keeling-Curve): "Keeling Curve, graph showing seasonal and annual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since 1958 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The graph, which was devised by American climate scientist Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, charts the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere. It is the longest uninterrupted instrumental record of atmospheric CO2 in the world, and it is commonly regarded as one of the best and most recognizable products of a long-term scientific study. The curve is considered by many scientists to be a trustworthy measure of CO2 in the middle layers of the troposphere, and it has been interpreted by many climate scientists as a warning signal for global warming."
