Seismic tremor persisted, featuring recurring pulses several times per hour, some lasting over an hour, and about two earthquakes were located beneath the summit. Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) emissions were last measured at 1,550 tonnes per day on January 14, 2026, within the typical range of 1,000\u20135,000 tonnes/day during eruptive pauses\u2014significantly lower than during active lava fountaining episodes. No significant activity has been detected along K\u012blauea\u2019s East Rift Zone or Southwest Rift Zone, with seismicity and ground deformation remaining very low and SO\u2082 emissions below detection limits. Based on current summit inflation rates, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) forecasts the onset of episode 42 lava fountaining between February 9 and 20, 2026, though this window will be refined with additional data.

The III level of danger, classified as red, has been declared. According to the center, cold Arctic air invading from northern Europe, combined with clear skies and high pressure, will cause nighttime temperatures to fall to -20\u00b0C to -27\u00b0C across the region (down to -25\u00b0C in Kyiv), with isolated areas reaching extreme cold of -30\u00b0C. Daytime temperatures are expected to remain between -15\u00b0C and -22\u00b0C. The cold is forecast to gradually weaken from February 4\u20135, starting in the west and southwest. The extreme weather conditions are expected to disrupt energy and utility services, as well as transportation networks, including road, rail, and electric transit. Climate data for 2025 in Kyiv revealed it was the sixth warmest year on record, with an average annual temperature 1.4\u00b0C above the norm. The calendar autumn of 2025 was also the sixth warmest since 1881, with a mean monthly temperature of 10.5\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C above the climatological average.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:57 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/zhizn-stolitsyi/do-30-gradusov-moroza-kiev-i-oblast-nakroet-arkticheskij-holod-nazvana-opasnaya-data.htm)\n\n**Netherlands' 10 hottest years all in this century; 2025 was exceptionally sunny, dry**\nThe Netherlands experienced its 10 warmest years on record all within this century, with 2025 being the second sunniest year since records began in 1965, receiving 137 watts of sunshine per square meter\u2014just behind 2022\u2019s 138 watts. The average temperature in De Bilt was 11.4\u00b0C, making 2025 the sixth warmest year since records started, and it recorded the highest number of mild days (207 days with temperatures \u226515\u00b0C). The average summer temperature reached 18.5\u00b0C, a level that historically occurred once every 20 years in cooler climates but now happens every two years. Between 2000 and 2025, the Netherlands warmed by 1\u00b0C, or 0.4\u00b0C per decade\u2014exceeding the KNMI\u2019s 2023 projections of 0.33\u20130.35\u00b0C per decade. Global CO2 emissions rose again in 2025, with China as the largest emitter and the EU exceeding the global per capita average. The KNMI warned that if current trends continue, global warming will reach 1.5\u00b0C by 2029, jeopardizing the Paris Agreement goal. The cause of increased sunshine remains uncertain, with possible explanations including reduced air pollution, climate-driven weather pattern shifts, or a weakening Gulf Stream, though no definitive cause has been identified. The excess sunshine contributed to increased evaporation and drought, with 2025 recording only 673 mm of rainfall\u2014178 mm below the average of 851 mm.

Spring was exceptionally sunny, with nearly a quarter more sunshine than average, according to the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI)\u2019s 2025 climate overview. On average, 120 watts of solar radiation per square meter are expected annually, but in 2025, this reached 137 watts\u2014up from 138 watts in 2022. KNMI climate scientist Peter Siegmund stated that no definitive explanation has yet been found for the excess sunshine. One possible cause is reduced air pollution leading to fewer clouds, though this would also imply less fog, which contradicts observed conditions. Another hypothesis involves the weakening of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, potentially increasing southerly winds. Alternatively, the surplus could simply be due to random variation, as sunshine levels in 2021 and 2024 were consistent with predictions. The excess sunshine contributed to record dryness in parts of the country\u2014particularly Zeeland, which ranked among the top three driest years ever, alongside 2022 and 1976\u2014while Groningen saw only slightly drier conditions. The KNMI notes that increased evaporation from the extra sun has led to drought risks. On the positive side, solar panel output rose by a quarter compared to the previous year, with solar energy generation in the Netherlands reaching over 30 billion kilowatt-hours in 2025\u2014up from nearly zero in just over a decade. Meanwhile, the national average temperature in 2025 was 11.4\u00b0C, one degree warmer than around 2000, and 2025 ranked sixth among the warmest years on record, following 2023, 2024, 2014, 2020, and 2022.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/klimaatraadsel-de-zon-schijnt-te-veel-in-nederland-350-uur-meer-in-2025-dan-voorzien~b4d1bb53/)\n\n**USGS Volcano Notice - DOI-USGS-HVO-2026-01-28T18:39:06+00:00**\nThe Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu eruption of K\u012blauea is currently paused, with intermittent glow visible from both the north and south vents overnight.

Heavy snow reported in Hawaii this week.**\nHawaii experienced its first 2026 winter storm, resulting in up to 10 inches of snowfall on the summits of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, according to the National Weather Service. The snow, which occurred on January 5, 2026, was forecasted with a winter storm warning, including 5\u201310 inches of snow, strong winds, and significant rime icing. Despite Hawaii\u2019s tropical reputation, snow on its volcanic peaks is not uncommon, averaging five to eight occurrences annually, primarily during the wet season from October to April. Mauna Kea, standing over 13,000 feet, has a subarctic climate and has recorded the coldest temperature in Hawaii\u201412\u00b0F on May 17, 1979. The snowfall was caused by a 'kona low' storm system, a term derived from the Hawaiian word for 'western side' and 'low' meaning storm, which brings rising air, clouds, and precipitation. The storm also triggered flooding, high winds, water rescues, and high surf advisories on the eastern coasts, with the system expected to dissipate by January 7, 2026, according to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Tyler Roys.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 07:24 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2026/01/07/heavy-snow-reported-hawaii/88063725007/)\n\n**CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Timelapse of snow accumulation on Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano**\nTimelapse footage captured snow accumulating at the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, Earth's largest active volcano, located on the Island of Hawaii, on January 5, 2026.

Observations from Mauna\u202fLoa show atmospheric CO\u2082 growth rate rose 86\u202f% in 2023 versus 2022, the highest since 1958. The decline in carbon uptake was 30\u202f% driven by extreme heat that sparked massive forest fires in Canada and droughts in the Amazon, releasing roughly the same amount of carbon as North American fossil\u2011fuel emissions. Amazon deforestation data from MapBiomas show a loss of 52\u202fmillion hectares of native vegetation between 1985 and 2024, a 13\u202f% reduction approaching the 20\u201125\u202f% threshold that would push the biome into a runaway loss. Global CO\u2082 concentration reached a new record of 422.7\u202fppm in 2024, up 3.75\u202fppm from 2023, the largest annual increase on record.
