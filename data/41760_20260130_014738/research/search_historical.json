Betts, Chris D. Jones, Ralph Keeling, Jeff R. Knight, James O. Pope and Caroline Sandford\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### 2025 Forecast\n- **2025 annual average CO2 concentration forecast:** 426.6 \u00b1 0.6 ppm at Mauna Loa\n- **Predicted annual increase (2024 to 2025):** 2.26 \u00b1 0.56 ppm\n- **Without La Ni\u00f1a influence:** The increase would be 2.41 ppm (slightly higher)\n- This forecast increase is predicted to be the **12th largest on record**, with uncertainty range between 5th and 33rd largest\n\n### 2023-2024 Record\n- **CO2 rise between 2023 and 2024:** 3.58 ppm - the **largest annual increase in the 67-year Mauna Loa record**\n- This exceptional increase was driven by weaker carbon uptake due to El Ni\u00f1o conditions\n\n### Historical Context\n- CO2 concentrations have **increased by over 50% since the industrial revolution**\n- The increase would have been **almost twice as large** without natural absorption by plants and oceans\n- The Mauna Loa record dates back to **1958**\n\n### Decadal Trends\nTable 1 shows average annual CO2 rises have been increasing over six decades (specific decadal values appear to be referenced but not fully extracted in the content)\n\n## Key Mechanisms Explained:\n\n### Natural Carbon Sinks\n- Natural sinks (plants and oceans) remove some CO2 from the atmosphere but vary in strength year-to-year\n- **El Ni\u00f1o conditions:** Typically weaken natural carbon sinks (hotter, drier tropical conditions) \u2192 faster CO2 rise\n- **La Ni\u00f1a conditions:** Typically strengthen natural carbon sinks \u2192 slower CO2 rise\n\n### Current ENSO Status\n- ENSO currently close to **La Ni\u00f1a thresholds**, which is expected to cause temporary strengthening of carbon sinks\n- This explains why 2024-2025 increase is forecast to be smaller than the 2023-2024 record increase\n\n### Forecast Methodology\n- The Met Office forecast accounts for both anthropogenic emissions and ENSO-related climate variability\n- Uses observed correlation between annual CO2 rise and sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index)\n\n## Climate Policy Context:\n\n### Paris Agreement Compatibility\n- The forecast annual CO2 rise is **too high to be compatible with IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C scenarios**\n- IPCC 6th Assessment Report included 3 scenarios with at least 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C:\n  - C1-IMP-LD (low demand for resources)\n  - C1-IMP-REN (focus on renewables)\n  - C1-IMP-SP (sustainable development pathways)\n- All 1.5\u00b0C scenarios require CO2 rise to **slow to zero within the next two decades**\n\n### Emissions Trends\n- Human-caused emissions reached a **new record high in 2024**\n- Long-term: rate of CO2 rise increase slowed around **2012** due to slowing rise in global emissions\n- Temporary slowing in **2020** due to COVID-19 pandemic reductions in transport and energy production\n\n## Reliability Note:\nThis is an official forecast from the Met Office, a reputable national meteorological service, with named scientists and clear methodology based on observed correlations with ENSO patterns.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.techexplorist.com/atmospheric-co%E2%82%82-hits-record-levels-stark-warning-mauna-loa/99700/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Atmospheric CO\u2082 hits record levels\u2014A stark warning from Mauna Loa\"\n\n**Source:** Tech Explorist  \n**Date:** June 06, 2025  \n**Author:** Pranjal Malewar\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **May 2025 CO\u2082 Measurement:** Carbon dioxide concentrations surpassed 430 ppm during their seasonal peak for the first time in history. The May 2025 monthly average was **430.2 ppm** at Mauna Loa Observatory.\n\n2. **Year-over-Year Increase:** This represents an increase of **3.5 ppm** from May 2024 measurements (according to Scripps Institution of Oceanography). NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory reported a similar rise of **3.6 ppm**.\n\n3. **Historical Context:** The Mauna Loa Observatory has been tracking CO\u2082 trends since 1958, when Charles David Keeling first identified seasonal fluctuations and yearly increases. NOAA joined the monitoring effort in 1974.\n\n4. **Disruptions:** The 2022 Mauna Loa eruption temporarily halted observations, but scientists resumed measurements using backup systems and alternative monitoring sites at Maunakea.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Ralph Keeling** (director of the Scripps CO\u2082 Program): \"Another year, another record. It's sad.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- CO\u2082 levels vary globally\u2014stations in the Southern Hemisphere have not yet reached 430 ppm due to different seasonal cycles.\n- NOAA's global sampling network and Scripps' 14 global stations help identify sources and sinks of CO\u2082.\n- The monitoring effort is supported by the National Science Foundation, Schmidt Sciences, and Earth Networks.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/\">\n# Summary of NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory Article on CO2 Trends\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Recent Monthly Measurements:**\n   - December 2025: 427.49 ppm\n   - December 2024: 425.40 ppm\n   - Year-over-year increase: 2.09 ppm\n\n2. **About the Mauna Loa Record:**\n   - Longest record of direct atmospheric CO2 measurements\n   - Started by C. David Keeling (Scripps Institution) in March 1958\n   - NOAA began parallel measurements in May 1974\n   - Measurements taken at 3400 m altitude in northern subtropics\n\n3. **Measurement Methodology:**\n   - Monthly means are averages of daily means\n   - Daily means are based on hourly averages\n   - Only \"background\" conditions are included in measurements\n   - Data reported as dry air mole fraction in parts per million (ppm)\n   - Red lines/symbols show monthly mean values\n   - Black lines/symbols show values corrected for average seasonal cycle\n   - Seasonal cycle correction uses moving average of seven adjacent seasonal cycles\n   - Last year of data is preliminary pending recalibrations and quality control\n\n4. **Important Note:**\n   - The Mauna Loa data may not be identical to globally averaged CO2 concentration at the surface due to its specific location and altitude\n\n## Relevance to Question:\nThe article provides the most recent available data point (December 2025: 427.49 ppm) which can serve as a baseline for projecting April 2026 levels, though no explicit forecast or projection is provided in the article itself.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.mongabay.com/short-article/trumps-budget-would-end-7-decades-of-climate-data-collection/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trump's budget would end 7 decades of climate data collection\"\n\n**Source:** Conservation news  \n**Date:** July 23, 2025  \n**Authors:** Andy Ball, Marta Kasztelan\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Mauna Loa Observatory specifications:**\n   - Located on the Big Island of Hawai'i\n   - Elevation: 3,397 meters (11,135 feet)\n   - Has been collecting atmospheric CO2 data since 1958 (nearly 70 years of continuous data)\n   - Provides the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO2 levels in the world\n\n2. **Historical CO2 measurements:**\n   - 1958: 315 parts per million (ppm)\n   - 2024: Nearly 427 ppm\n   - Last time Earth had similar CO2 levels was roughly 3 million years ago, when sea levels were more than 24 meters (80 feet) higher than today\n\n3. **Budget proposal impact:**\n   - Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget for NOAA would cut funding for Mauna Loa Observatory\n   - NOAA operates four observatories that collect CO2 data globally; all four would be closed under the proposed budget\n   - More than a dozen observatories, national labs, and institutes total are proposed for closure\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **Rick Spinrad (former NOAA administrator):**\n   - Expressed concern about proposed lab closures\n   - Noted that facilities monitor extreme weather events and air pollution, which can help save lives\n   - Specifically mentioned concerns about closure of: Pacific Marine Environmental Lab (Seattle), National Severe Storms Lab (Norman, Oklahoma), Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab, Air Resources Lab, and Global Monitoring Lab (Boulder, Colorado)\n\n2. **Ralph Keeling (professor of climate science at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, son of Charles Keeling):**\n   - Stated: \"The NOAA effort is really the backbone of the global effort to track greenhouse gases\"\n   - Said: \"We need to do everything we can do make sure these stations don't close\"\n\n## Context:\nThe article focuses on the proposed closure of Mauna Loa Observatory, which provided data for the famous Keeling Curve showing seven decades of atmospheric CO2 concentration trends.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://oehha.ca.gov/climate-change/epic-2022/climate-change-drivers/atmospheric-greenhouse-gas-concentrations\">\n# Summary of OEHHA Article on Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations\n\n**Publication Date:** September 09, 2022\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Carbon Dioxide Concentration Trends at Mauna Loa:\n- **Historical baseline:** 315 ppm annual average in 1958\n- **2024 level:** 425 ppm annual average\n- **Overall increase:** 110 ppm over 66 years (1958-2024)\n\n### Rate of Increase:\n- **Long-term average (past 6 decades):** 1.6 ppm per year\n- **Recent acceleration (last 5 years):** approximately 2.5 ppm per year\n\n### Seasonal Patterns:\n- CO2 concentrations **decrease** in spring through late summer (plants absorb CO2)\n- CO2 concentrations **increase** in autumn through late winter (plant decay releases CO2)\n\n### Geographic Context:\n- California monitoring sites show slightly higher levels than Mauna Loa due to latitudinal gradient (CO2 levels increase moving north from the equator)\n- Monitoring locations mentioned: Mauna Loa Hawaii (1958-2024), La Jolla (1957-2024), Point Arena (1999-2011), Trinidad Head (2002-2017)\n\n### Historical Context:\n- Pre-industrial levels (around Industrial Revolution): approximately 280 ppm\n- Reached 400 ppm milestone in 2015\n\n## Important Contextual Information:\n- CO2 remains in the atmosphere for centuries, meaning atmospheric levels can remain high even if emissions decline or stop\n- Other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide) also continue to increase globally and in California\n\n**Note:** This article provides data through 2024, but was published in September 2022, suggesting the 2024 figures may be projections or the content source date may not reflect when all data in the article was compiled.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth/explore/earth-indicators/carbon-dioxide/\">\n## Summary of NASA Science Article on Carbon Dioxide (September 25, 2025)\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Latest Measurements:**\n- **427 ppm** recorded in December 2025 at Mauna Loa Observatory\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- CO2 has increased more than 50% since the start of industrial times (18th century)\n- Current levels are 150% of 1750 values (1.5 times the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago)\n- The ice age increase occurred over thousands of years, while current increases have happened in decades\n- Satellite measurements show CO2 rising from 365 ppm in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022\n\n**Seasonal Patterns:**\n- CO2 levels follow an annual cycle, creating a \"sawtooth pattern\"\n- **Atmospheric CO2 is highest in spring, lowest in autumn** (Northern Hemisphere)\n- This seasonal variation is caused by photosynthesis cycles on a global scale\n- In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants draw in CO2 for growth, lowering atmospheric levels\n- In northern autumn, plant decomposition releases CO2 back to the atmosphere\n- Southern Hemisphere shows opposite pattern (spring growth in September, winter decomposition in March), but Northern Hemisphere dominates the global pattern due to greater land mass and vegetation\n\n**Data Source Information:**\n- Ground measurements from NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958\n- Satellite measurements from AIRS instrument measure mid-troposphere (8-12 km above ground)\n- \"Parts per million\" refers to CO2 molecules per million molecules of dry air\n\n**Attribution:**\n- The upward trend is primarily linked to burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)\n- Other sources include wildfires and volcanic eruptions\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Monthly Mauna Loa CO2 2010-2025 with April subset\nThe user ultimately needs two concrete products:\n\nA. The complete series of monthly mean CO\u2082 mole fractions measured at Mauna Loa from January 2010 through December 2025 (192 rows).  \nB. A subset containing only the 16 April means from April 2010 to April 2025.\n\nWhat the current search results supply\n\n1. Location and format of the authoritative file  \n   \u2022 NOAA-GML distributes \u201cMauna Loa CO\u2082 monthly mean data\u201d in both text and CSV form (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html). The file is the long-standing co2_mm_mlo.txt / .csv that begins in 1958 and is updated monthly. It contains four numeric columns (year, month, decimal date, average) plus several flag columns [NOAA Trends page].  \n   \u2022 Scripps provides an almost identical record, \u201cmonthly_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv\u201d, also beginning in 1958, via its data portal (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu; see the station page returned in the results).  \n   Either file is suitable; NOAA is preferred when only one provider is requested.\n\n2. Coverage through 2025 is already present  \n   \u2022 The NOAA Trends home page is showing monthly bars through at least December 2025 (e.g., the graph caption \u201cDecember 2025 427.49 ppm\u201d) [NOAA trends front page].  \n   \u2022 CO2.Earth reports NOAA\u2019s February 2025 value (427.09 ppm) and notes a last update of 5 Mar 2025, confirming that the underlying CSV has advanced into 2025 [CO2.Earth datasets page].  \n   Consequently it is virtually certain that all twelve 2025 rows are now embedded in the downloadable file.\n\n3. Access is friction-free  \n   The CSV/text links on the NOAA page are open access; a simple browser download or a scripted fetch (curl, wget, Python requests, etc.) will deliver the file in seconds. The Scripps file is likewise open (and mirrored by many third-party repositories such as DataHub and DASL, also included in the search results).\n\n4. Data-quality flags to keep in mind  \n   \u2022 Monthly means flagged \u221299.99 are missing; NOAA rewrites them after a short filling/interpolation procedure.  \n   \u2022 The Mauna Loa eruption in November 2022 forced several weeks of downtime. NOAA filled the January\u2013November 2023 gap by borrowing data from a Maunakea surrogate site; the numerical values are fine but still marked \u201cinterpolated\u201d in the CSV.  \n   \u2022 All 2025 values remain \u201cpreliminary\u201d until the routine flask recalibration sweep is done; this status will be noted in the header of the file.\n\nWhat is still missing\n\nThe search results confirm source, format, and coverage but do NOT expose the actual numeric rows. Without downloading the file we cannot list:\n\n   \u2022 the 192 monthly means for 2010-01 \u2026 2025-12, and  \n   \u2022 the 16 April means for 2010-04 \u2026 2025-04.\n\nThose two tables are precisely what the user requested, so a retrieval step is still required.\n\nRecommended next step (no further background research needed)\n\n1. Download the latest copy of co2_mm_mlo.csv from  \n   https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.csv  (linked on the NOAA Trends page).\n\n2. Load it into any tabular tool (Excel, R, Python/pandas).  \n   Example in pandas:  \n\n      import pandas as pd  \n      url = \"https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.csv\"  \n      df = pd.read_csv(url, comment=\"#\", header=None,  \n                       names=[\"year\",\"month\",\"decimal\",\"average\",\"interp\",\"trend\",\"days\"])  \n      subset = df.query(\"2010 <= year <= 2025\")  \n      april   = subset[subset.month == 4]\n\n3. Export or copy-paste  \n   \u2022 subset.to_csv(\"MLO_CO2_2010_2025_monthly.csv\", index=False)  \n   \u2022 april.to_csv(\"MLO_CO2_April_2010_2025.csv\", index=False)\n\nAfter that extraction, the user will possess the exact values requested.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll contextual information\u2014data provenance, file location, coverage confirmation, quality caveats\u2014has now been assembled from the search results (NOAA Trends page, Scripps data portal, CO2.Earth display). The sole remaining gap is retrieval of the numbers themselves, which can be filled in one automatic download. No additional literature or background sources are required; only the data fetch remains.</Agent_report>\n"
