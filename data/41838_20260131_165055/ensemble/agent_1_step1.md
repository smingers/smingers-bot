Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Historical Data (Q4 2024):**
- **Captide.ai summary**: Reports Alphabet's 2024 full-year results showing EMEA represented 29% of total revenues ($350B total = ~$101.5B EMEA annually). This is authoritative financial data from official earnings reports.
- **10-K document**: Extraction failed due to formatting issues, limiting direct access to geographic breakdowns.

**Q3 2025 Performance Indicators:**
- **Barchart.com (Oct 22, 2025)**: Forward-looking article expecting Q3 2025 EPS of $2.27, up 7.1% YoY. Discusses global performance but no EMEA specifics. This is speculative analyst consensus.
- **CNBC (Nov 18, 2025)**: Reports Alphabet stock hit all-time high following Gemini 3 AI launch on Nov 17, 2025. Positive sentiment indicator but no revenue data.

**Consensus Estimate:**
- **Agent Report**: Cites Yahoo Finance consensus of $32.4B for Q4 2025 EMEA revenues. This is a single-source analyst estimate requiring validation. The report notes lack of quarterly historical data to calculate Q4/Q3 seasonal lifts.

**Related Corporate Performance (Limited Relevance):**
- Multiple articles about other companies (ManpowerGroup, Electrolux, Adidas, etc.) provide context on EMEA market conditions but don't directly inform Alphabet's performance.
- **Meta Platforms article (Jan 31, 2026)**: Shows Meta's Q4 2025 advertising revenue grew 24%, with Q1 2026 guidance suggesting 30% growth. This indicates strong digital advertising market conditions that could benefit Alphabet.

**Key Expert Opinion:**
- **Agent Report**: Notes CFO Anat Ashkenazi flagged "potential FX tail-wind to revenues in Q4" due to euro strengthening versus USD (Motley Fool transcript, Nov 27, 2025). This is material guidance from management.

**Quality Assessment:**
- High quality: Official 2024 results, management guidance on FX
- Medium quality: Yahoo Finance consensus ($32.4B), Meta performance data
- Low quality: Failed 10-K extraction, tangential corporate reports

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Alphabet's EMEA Q4/Q3 Sequential Growth Pattern**
   - Agent report indicates typical holiday-driven Q4 spike
   - Estimated ~9% Q3-to-Q4 lift in 2024 (assuming stable 29% regional mix)
   - Limitation: Lack of verified quarterly data for 2020-2024

2. **Alphabet's EMEA Year-over-Year Growth Rate**
   - 2023 EMEA: $91.0B → 2024 EMEA: $102.1B = 12.2% YoY growth
   - If Q4 2024 EMEA ≈ $26.8B (29% of Q4 total ~$92.5B), then 12% growth → Q4 2025 ≈ $30.0B
   - This seems conservative given strong AI momentum

3. **Alphabet's Global Constant-Currency Growth Applied to EMEA**
   - 2024 constant-currency growth: 15% globally
   - Q3 2025 showed continued double-digit growth momentum
   - EMEA historically tracks global growth closely

4. **Digital Advertising Market Growth in EMEA**
   - Meta's 24% Q4 2025 ad revenue growth suggests robust market
   - Alphabet typically captures similar or better growth in search/YouTube

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of #2 (EMEA YoY growth) and #3 (global constant-currency trends), adjusted for Q4 seasonality and management guidance on FX tailwinds.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q4 2025 (October 1 - December 31, 2025) - already completed, awaiting Feb 4, 2026 earnings release.

**Historical Q4 Patterns:**
- Q4 consistently strongest quarter due to holiday advertising spend
- EMEA follows this pattern with retail, e-commerce, and brand advertising peaks
- Q4 2024 benefited from U.S. election advertising (CFO noted this creates tough comps for Q4 2026)

**2025 Context:**
- Gemini 3 AI launched Nov 17, 2025 - potential revenue catalyst in late Q4
- CFO guidance: FX tailwind from euro strength vs USD
- Stock hit all-time high in November 2025 on AI optimism
- Meta's strong Q4 performance suggests healthy digital ad market

## (d) Justification

**Base Case Calculation:**
- Q4 2024 EMEA estimated: $26.8B (29% of ~$92.5B global Q4 revenue)
- Historical EMEA growth: 12.2% (2023→2024)
- Expected Q4 2025 growth factors:
  - Strong AI momentum (Gemini 3 launch)
  - FX tailwind (euro strength)
  - Robust digital ad market (Meta +24%)
  - Google Cloud continued 28%+ growth
  - Holiday seasonality

**Growth Scenario Analysis:**
- Conservative (10% YoY): $26.8B × 1.10 = $29.5B
- Base case (13-15% YoY): $26.8B × 1.14 = $30.6B
- Optimistic (17-18% YoY): $26.8B × 1.175 = $31.5B
- Analyst consensus: $32.4B (implies 21% growth - aggressive but possible with AI surge)

**Constant-Currency Adjustment:**
CFO noted FX tailwind, meaning reported USD revenues benefit from stronger euro. Constant-currency removes this benefit, so constant-currency EMEA revenue should be slightly lower than reported figures. This suggests the $32.4B consensus might be for reported revenue, requiring ~1-3% downward adjustment for constant-currency.

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Exact magnitude of FX impact
- Timing of Gemini 3 revenue contribution (late November launch)
- European macro conditions (not explicitly addressed)
- Cloud vs advertising mix in EMEA

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Historical Performance:**
The 2024 EMEA growth of 12.2% provides a strong baseline. However, 2025 shows acceleration:
- Global constant-currency growth was 15% in 2024
- Q3 2025 maintained double-digit growth momentum
- AI investments driving both Cloud (+28%) and advertising efficiency

**Distribution Shape Considerations:**
- Central tendency: $30.5B-$31.5B range (14-17% growth)
- Downside risks: European economic slowdown, delayed AI monetization → $29B-$30B
- Upside potential: Stronger AI adoption, market share gains from competitors → $32B-$33B
- The $32.4B consensus appears optimistic but within plausible range

**Calibration for Constant-Currency:**
Since CFO mentioned FX tailwinds, reported revenue will be boosted by currency effects. Constant-currency removes this, suggesting:
- If reported EMEA is $32.4B with 2-3% FX benefit
- Constant-currency would be $31.5B-$31.8B

**90/10 Confidence Interval:**
- P10 (pessimistic): Significant European weakness or AI monetization delays → $29.0B
- P50 (median): Strong but not exceptional performance → $31.0B
- P90 (optimistic): AI surge, market share gains, strong holiday season → $33.5B

**Percentile Calibration:**
Given the hint that answers should be between $28B-$35B, my distribution should span this range while concentrating probability in the $30B-$32B zone based on:
- Historical 12% growth baseline
- AI-driven acceleration
- Strong Q4 seasonality
- FX considerations for constant-currency
