- CFO guidance on Q3 call: FX tailwind expected in Q4 2025 as euro strengthened vs. dollar

**AskNews Deep Research:**
- Confirms no official Q4 2025 data available as of Jan 31, 2026 (earnings Feb 4, 2026)
- Multiple corporate earnings from other companies (ManpowerGroup, Electrolux, etc.) show mixed EMEA performance but not directly relevant to Alphabet

**Quality Assessment:**
- Historical 2024 data: High quality (investor relations)
- Yahoo Finance consensus ($32.4B): Medium quality (single source, unverified)
- Agent seasonal analysis: Medium-high quality (logical, based on historical patterns)
- FX tailwind guidance: High quality (direct CFO statement)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Alphabet EMEA Q4 revenue 2020-2024**: Most specific, captures company-specific dynamics, regional trends, and seasonal patterns.

2. **Big Tech EMEA revenue growth rates**: Broader but potentially useful for industry trends (Microsoft, Meta, Amazon regional performance).

3. **Global digital advertising market EMEA**: Captures market-level dynamics but too broad given Alphabet's diversified revenue (Cloud, subscriptions).

**Selected Reference Class:** Alphabet EMEA Q4 revenue 2020-2024 is most suitable due to:
- Direct historical precedent
- Captures company-specific execution
- Reflects regional economic conditions
- Includes seasonal advertising patterns

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q4 2025 (Oct 1 - Dec 31, 2025), resolving Feb 4, 2026 (4 days from now).

**Historical EMEA Annual Revenue:**
- 2020: $55.4B (YCharts)
- 2021: $79.1B (+42.8% YoY)
- 2022: $82.1B (+3.8% YoY)
- 2023: $91.0B (+10.8% YoY)
- 2024: $102.1B (+12.2% YoY, 29% of total)

**Q4 Patterns:**
- Q4 typically represents 27-30% of annual revenue due to holiday advertising
- Assuming 29% Q4 share (2024 full-year mix):
  - 2024 Q4 EMEA: ~$29.6B (29% of $102.1B)
  - If Q4 is stronger (30% share): ~$30.6B

**Sequential Q3→Q4 Lift:**
- Agent report suggests ~9% historical lift
- Advertising seasonality supports 8-12% sequential growth

**2025 Growth Trajectory:**
- Q3 2025 showed strong performance (Alphabet hit all-time highs Nov 2025)
- AI momentum (Gemini 3 launch) driving optimism
- FX tailwind from stronger euro vs. dollar
- Yahoo consensus: $32.4B for Q4 2025

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
If 2024 Q4 EMEA was ~$29.6B and we apply:
- Conservative 8% YoY growth: $32.0B
- Moderate 12% YoY growth: $33.2B
- Aggressive 15% YoY growth (matching 2024 full-year constant currency): $34.0B

**Adjustments:**
1. **FX Tailwind**: CFO noted euro strength provides Q4 tailwind, supporting constant-currency revenue growth
2. **AI Momentum**: Gemini 3 launch (Nov 17) and record stock prices suggest strong Q4 execution
3. **Seasonal Strength**: Q4 2025 includes full holiday season, historically Alphabet's strongest quarter
4. **Yahoo Consensus**: $32.4B aligns with 9% YoY growth, reasonable but potentially conservative given momentum

**Constant Currency Consideration:**
The question asks for constant-currency revenues, which removes FX effects. While CFO noted FX tailwind for *reported* revenue, constant-currency figures would show underlying business growth without currency benefits. This suggests actual constant-currency growth might be slightly lower than reported growth.

**Expected Range:**
- Lower bound (10th percentile): $30.5B (3% growth, accounts for unexpected weakness)
- Central estimate: $32.0-33.0B (8-11% growth)
- Upper bound (90th percentile): $34.5B (17% growth, captures AI acceleration)

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Anchoring:**
Starting with 2024 Q4 EMEA baseline of ~$29.6B, I need to construct a distribution reflecting:
1. Historical growth volatility (3.8% to 42.8% YoY, though 2021 was post-pandemic anomaly)
2. Recent stable growth (10-12% range 2023-2024)
3. Current momentum indicators (positive)
4. Uncertainty factors (4 days to resolution, limited public data)

**Percentile Logic:**
- P10 (pessimistic): Unexpected weakness, macro headwinds, ~3% growth → $30.5B
- P20: Below-consensus, ~6% growth → $31.5B
- P40: Slightly below consensus, ~8% growth → $32.0B
- P60: At/above consensus, ~11% growth → $32.9B
- P80: Strong execution, ~14% growth → $33.7B
- P90 (optimistic): AI acceleration, ~17% growth → $34.6B

**Calibration Checks:**
- Hint range: $28B-$35B. My distribution ($30.5B-$34.6B) sits comfortably within this, appropriately avoiding extreme tails.
- Yahoo consensus ($32.4B) falls between my P40-P60, reflecting moderate confidence.
- Width of 90% CI (~$4.1B, or 13% of central estimate) accounts for remaining uncertainty with 4 days to resolution.
- Historical volatility supports this range given stable 2023-2024 growth patterns.

**Rate of Upsets:**
Tech earnings typically have ~70-80% accuracy within ±5% of consensus. Given strong recent momentum and short timeframe, I weight toward consensus-aligned outcomes while maintaining reasonable tail risk.
