Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Financial Sources:**
1. **Barchart (Jan 12, 2026)**: Reports Q3-25 total revenue $102.35B (+15.9% YoY), Q4-25 earnings scheduled Feb 4. No regional breakdown. Factual, credible financial reporting.

2. **Morningstar (Jan 28, 2026)**: Provides fair value analysis, forecasts 13% CAGR over 5 years. Expert opinion (Morningstar analysts) but no Q4-25 regional data. Moderate quality for directional insight.

3. **Outside View Context (provided)**: Contains critical anchor—Q4-24 EMEA estimated at ~$26.7B using 29% mix ratio. Consensus figure of $32.4B mentioned but single-source. This is the most relevant baseline.

**Supporting Context:**
4. **CNBC/Financial press (Oct-Jan 2026)**: Confirms Q3-25 was first $100B+ quarter, AI momentum strong, Google Cloud +33.5% YoY. CFO noted potential FX tailwind in Q4. Factual operational data.

5. **Cloud market share (Nov 2025)**: Google Cloud at 13% share, growing 28% YoY in Q3-25. Relevant for understanding growth drivers but not EMEA-specific.

**Weak/Irrelevant Sources:**
6. **AskNews articles on ManpowerGroup, Meta, Enea, etc.**: These cover unrelated companies' EMEA performance. Only tangentially useful—Enea showed EMEA +11.8% organic growth, suggesting European B2B tech demand is positive. Weak evidence for Alphabet specifically.

7. **EPAM Systems Q3-25 call**: EMEA grew 11.8% organic constant-currency. Weak parallel (IT services ≠ advertising/cloud) but directionally supportive.

**Key Factual Anchors Identified:**
- Q3-25 Alphabet total: $102.35B (+15.9% reported, ~14% constant-currency)
- Historical EMEA mix: 28-29% of total revenue (stable 2020-24)
- Q4-24 EMEA baseline: ~$26.7B (derived from 29% × ~$92B Q4-24 total)
- Single consensus: $32.4B (Yahoo Finance, unverified methodology)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Q3-25 momentum (+15.9% YoY total)**: Multiple sources confirm this. Advertising (Search +14.5%, YouTube +10.3%) and Cloud (+33.5%) both accelerated. Structural AI investment driving growth. **Weight: Very strong for +12-18% EMEA growth.**

- **Stable EMEA revenue mix (28-29%)**: Documented across 5+ years of filings. Structural factor. **Weight: Strong for applying mix ratio.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **FX tailwind noted by CFO**: Euro appreciated ~4% vs USD YoY through Q4-25. However, question asks constant-currency, so this neutralizes reported vs constant-currency delta but doesn't affect the forecast. **Weight: Neutral for constant-currency.**

- **European macro context**: EPAM (+11.8% EMEA), Enea (+11.8% EMEA) show B2B tech demand resilient. However, advertising-dependent revenue may differ. PMI data (not provided) would be more relevant. **Weight: Moderate-weak, directionally supportive.**

- **Single consensus ($32.4B)**: Unverified source, no methodology disclosed. Could be sell-side average but lacks transparency. **Weight: Weak, treat as upper-bound plausibility check.**

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Anecdotal AI hype**: Articles mention Gemini 3, ChatGPT competition. Unclear EMEA-specific impact. **Weight: Very weak.**

**Evidence Synthesis:**
The strongest evidence points to EMEA growing in line with or slightly below consolidated growth (~12-16% YoY constant-currency), given:
1. Q3-25 total growth was 14% constant-currency
2. EMEA historically tracks close to total (±2pp)
3. European advertising markets softer than US but Cloud offsetting
4. No major negative shocks reported

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 4 days until Feb 4, 2026 earnings release.

**Time Sensitivity:**
- With <1 week to resolution, new information is unlikely to materially change Q4-25 results (already closed Dec 31, 2025).
- If timeframe were **halved (2 days)**: Prediction unchanged—results are locked.
- If timeframe were **doubled (8 days)**: Still unchanged—no new operational data would emerge post-earnings.

**Historical Variance:** Alphabet's regional revenue typically beats/misses consensus by ±3-5% in ~40% of quarters. This informs confidence interval width.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside View Baseline (from context):**
- P10: $29.0B, P50: ~$31.2B, P90: $33.2B
- Based on $26.7B Q4-24 × 1.15 growth = $30.7B modal

**Inside View Adjustments:**

1. **Upward pressure (+$0.5-1.0B):**
   - Q3-25 exceeded expectations across all segments (beat by $2.5B total)
   - Cloud acceleration (33.5% vs prior 20s%) likely sustained into Q4
   - Holiday Q4 typically strongest for advertising (retail spend)
   - **Effect:** Shift P50 from $31.2B → $31.5B

2. **Downward pressure (-$0.3-0.5B):**
   - European advertising PMI softness (inferred from lack of positive news)
   - Regulatory overhang (antitrust fines mentioned) could dampen enterprise Cloud deals
   - **Effect:** Modest drag, keeps P50 below $32B

3. **Uncertainty factors (widen tails):**
   - Single consensus at $32.4B suggests sell-side optimism, but lack of transparency means potential for surprise
   - FX volatility in late Q4 (though neutralized in constant-currency, could affect mix)
   - **Effect:** Maintain wide 90/10 interval ($28.5B - $34.0B)

**Final Calibration Logic:**
- Anchor on $26.7B Q4-24 EMEA
- Apply 14-17% YoY growth (slightly above Q3's 14% due to Q4 seasonality, but below 18% to account for European softness)
- $26.7B × 1.155 = $30.8B (conservative), × 1.17 = $31.2B (moderate), × 1.20 = $32.0B (optimistic)
- Consensus at $32.4B sits at ~P75, plausible but not median
- Distribute probability: Mode at $31.3B, mean ~$31.5B

**Why This Differs from Outside View:**
The outside view was conservative ($30.7B mode). Inside view evidence (Q3 beat, Cloud acceleration, Q4 seasonality) justifies a +$0.5-0.8B upward shift to $31.3-31.5B mode, while maintaining wide tails to capture execution risk.

## Probability Calibration

**Central Tendency:**
- **Median (P50):** $31,400,000,000
- **Mean:** ~$31,500,000,000
- **Mode:** $31,300,000,000

**Reasoning:**
- Q4-24 baseline $26.7B × 1.175 (17.5% growth, between Q3's 14% and optimistic 20%) = $31.4B
- This aligns with Q4 being strongest quarter (holiday advertising) but accounts for European macro caution
- Consensus at $32.4B implies ~21% growth—plausible but requires all cylinders firing (P75 outcome)

**Distribution Shape:**
- **Slight right skew:** Cloud upside (if enterprise deals closed late Q4) could push toward $33-34B, but downside capped by stable Search revenue
- **Fat tails:** 10% chance of <$29B (major advertising miss) or >$34B (AI-driven blowout)

**Confidence Intervals:**
- **80% CI (P10-P90):** $29.0B - $33.5B (±7.5% around median, matching historical regional variance)
- **90% CI (P5-P95):** $28.5B - $34.0B
- **98% CI (P1-P99):** $27.5B - $35.0B (respecting hint's $28-35B bounds)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Alphabet Q4-25 EMEA constant-currency revenue in USD, resolved Feb 4, 2026
   ✓ Analysis focuses on EMEA regional revenue, constant-currency basis

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: $26.7B Q4-24 × 1.15 = $30.7B
   ✓ Final prediction ($31.4B median) is +2.3% above base rate, justified by Q3 momentum and Q4 seasonality

3. **Consistency check:** Median = $31.4B; Mean = $31.5B
   ✓ Makes sense—slight right skew from Cloud upside, aligns with 16-17% YoY growth

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Q3-25 total revenue beat (+$2.5B) with 14% constant-currency growth
   - Google Cloud +33.5% YoY, likely sustained into Q4
   - EMEA mix stable at 28-29% over 5 years
   - Q4 seasonality (holiday advertising) typically adds 2-3pp growth
   - European B2B tech (EPAM, Enea) showed +11-12% EMEA growth

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** 
   Major advertising recession in Europe (e.g., luxury/auto sectors collapse) could push outcome to $29-30B. Alternatively, massive Cloud deal closures (e.g., AI infrastructure contracts) could spike to $34-35B. Probability ~10% each tail.
