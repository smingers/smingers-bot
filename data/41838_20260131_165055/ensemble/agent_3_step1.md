Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what we know, and how reliable it is)
1) **Captide.ai summary of Alphabet Q4 2024** (secondary summary; pertains to FY2024 mix)  
   - **What it says (facts):** FY2024 revenue $350.0B; constant-currency growth 15%; geographic mix: **US 49%, EMEA 29%, APAC 16%, Other Americas 6%**.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Secondary summarization (not a primary filing). The geographic mix is plausible and directionally useful as a **base-rate anchor**, but I treat precise percentages cautiously.

2) **Alphabet 2024 10-K PDF (corrupted extraction)**  
   - **What it provides:** Nothing usable due to garbling.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Would have been primary-source; unusable here.

3) **Last10K landing page**  
   - **What it provides:** No filing content; no forecast-relevant facts.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Not useful.

4) **Yahoo Finance earnings-live article (Dec 12, 2025)**  
   - **What it provides:** Macro/other-company earnings context; explicitly not Alphabet regional revenue.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Not relevant for the numeric target.

5) **Barchart preview (Oct 22, 2025)**  
   - **What it says:** Broad EPS expectations for Q3’25; not geography.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Weak relevance (no EMEA revenue).

6) **CNBC market article (Nov 18, 2025)**  
   - **What it says (fact):** Alphabet stock hit highs tied to Gemini 3 rollout sentiment.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Sentiment indicator only; no direct mapping to EMEA revenue.

7) **Agent report (compiled research)**  
   - **Key factual nugget:** **Single-source Street consensus for “Revenues – EMEA” in Q4’25 = $32.4B (Yahoo Finance)**.  
   - **Other facts:** YCharts annual EMEA totals (2019–2024; 2024 EMEA $102.1B).  
   - **Quality/limits:** The $32.4B is **not corroborated** by a second estimates vendor (FactSet/Bloomberg/Visible Alpha). Annual EMEA totals are helpful for scale but **don’t pin down Q4 seasonality**.

8) **AskNews article set / deep research note**  
   - **What it says (fact):** Alphabet hasn’t yet reported Q4’25 at the time of those articles; no public EMEA constant-currency figure.  
   - **Quality/limits:** Correct but doesn’t advance quantification.

**Bottom line from sources:** The only direct Q4’25 EMEA numeric “estimate” we have is **$32.4B (single-source consensus)**; everything else is scale/seasonality context.

### (b) Reference class analysis (what past analogs fit best?)
I see three plausible reference classes:

1) **Alphabet EMEA quarterly revenue level (recent years), Q4 specifically**  
   - Best match in theory, because it directly targets “Q4 EMEA.”  
   - Problem: we *don’t* have the quarterly EMEA table in the provided sources.

2) **Alphabet total quarterly revenue × typical EMEA share (≈ high-20%s)**  
   - Good practical proxy when quarterly EMEA data is missing.  
   - Uses a stable-ish geographic mix (EMEA ~29% in FY2024 per Captide; annual EMEA totals also suggest a high-20% share).

3) **Street consensus for Q4’25 EMEA revenue (the $32.4B figure)**  
   - Highly relevant if trustworthy (it is a direct forecast of the target).  
   - Main weakness: **single-source, unverified**.

**Most suitable choice:** a **hybrid of (2) and (3)**—tether the center to the $32.4B consensus, but sanity-check it against “total revenue scale × EMEA share” and keep uncertainty wider due to lack of corroboration and unknown constant-currency methodology details.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-01-31  
- **Resolution:** 2026-02-04  
- **Time left:** ~4 days  
This is effectively a **nowcast**: uncertainty is dominated less by macro drift and more by (i) how accurate consensus is, and (ii) any last-minute surprises in ad demand, cloud, or reporting definitions (especially “constant-currency” by region).

Seasonality: Alphabet tends to have a **strong Q4** (holiday advertising). That normally pushes Q4 above Q3, supporting an EMEA Q4 number that is elevated versus a “flat quarterly average” implied by annual totals.

---

### (d) Justification (outside-view point estimate logic)
1) **Scale check from annual EMEA total:** YCharts shows **FY2024 EMEA ~$102.1B**, implying an average quarter of ~$25.5B if flat. But Q4 is typically the peak quarter, so Q4 should be **materially above** that average—consistent with the platform’s hint range **$28B–$35B**.

2) **Mix check from FY2024 share:** If EMEA is about **~29%** of total revenue (Captide), then for Q4’25:
   - If Alphabet Q4 total revenue is plausibly in the **~$110B-ish** neighborhood (given reported commentary that Q3’25 was the first $100B+ quarter and Q4 is often higher), then:
   - EMEA ≈ 0.28–0.30 × $110B ≈ **$30.8B–$33.0B**.
   This puts the “mechanical” outside-view range right around the consensus center.

3) **Consensus anchor:** The one explicit estimate we have is **$32.4B** (Yahoo Finance via agent report). Given the above scale/mix check, **$32.4B looks plausible**, so I use it as the distribution’s center—but I widen tails because it’s uncorroborated and because “constant-currency revenues by region” can have definitional/rounding quirks.

**Outside-view central tendency:** ~**$32.4B–$32.6B** for Q4’25 EMEA constant-currency revenues.

---

Outside view calibration:

- **Distribution goal:** capture a realistic range, not a razor-thin “consensus equals truth” view.  
- **Key uncertainty drivers:**
  1) **Unverified consensus** (single source).
  2) **Region-mix drift** (EMEA share could be 27–30% in a given quarter).
  3) **Q4 ad seasonality variability** (strong but not perfectly stable).
  4) **Constant-currency construction** (company methodology could create small but meaningful differences vs “reported”).
- **Tethering:** center the median near $32.4B; set a fairly wide 10–90 interval (~$5–6B span) while staying within the hint bounds.
