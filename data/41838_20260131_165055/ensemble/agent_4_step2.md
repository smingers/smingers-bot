Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most weight-bearing first)

1. Alphabet Q3-2025 earnings release (Oct 29 2025) – primary filing, audited. 102350000000 total revenue, no regional CC numbers, but shows yoy growth and confirms Q3 mix trends. Factual, high quality.
2. Captide.ai summary of Alphabet FY-2024 10-K – secondary, but cites the 10-K table: EMEA 102100000000 for 2024 (29 % of total). Credible but not primary; medium quality.
3. Street consensus screen grab (Yahoo Finance, downloaded Jan 30 2026) – only place with an explicit “Q4-2025 EMEA constant-currency revenue” estimate of 32400000000. Methodology opaque; single source; medium quality.
4. Barchart, Morningstar, InvestingChannel previews (Jan 12–30 2026) – give expected total Q4 revenue around 110–112 B and discuss drivers (advertising, cloud). Reliable outlets; figures are analyst consensus, not audited. Medium quality.
5. Asknews meta-search (Jan 31 2026) – confirms no leak of regional numbers yet. Weak factual content but useful negative evidence (no contrary numbers).

Opinion vs fact: only the numeric totals, mix ratios, and consensus medians are treated as fact; bullish/bearish commentary is ignored.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• Alphabet’s historical geographic mix is remarkably stable (EMEA 28–30 % of total for the last eight years).  
• Q4 is seasonally 8–12 % above the quarterly average for both total and EMEA revenues every year since 2018.

Moderate evidence  
• Single-vendor consensus value 32400000000.  
• Analyst total-revenue consensus 110–112 B implying 31–33 B for EMEA if share holds.  
• USD weakened 2 % against EUR and GBP in Q4, slightly inflating reported but stripped out in constant-currency; impact small.

Weak evidence  
• Qualitative chatter about “AI search cannibalising ad clicks in Europe” (no numbers).  
• Possible one-off EMEA fines or accrual reversals (immaterial historically).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 4 days. 95 % of fundamental uncertainty (ad demand, FX methodology) is already locked in. If the horizon were doubled to eight days, variance would hardly change; if halved to two days, the same.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: apply 29 % share to 110500000000 midpoint total-revenue consensus ⇒ 32000000000.  
Inside-view tweaks:  
+0.8 B for slightly higher ad spend in EMEA (Meta and retail data show stronger holiday push).  
−0.4 B for tougher FX baseline in CC calculation (EUR strength versus USD).  
Net shift +0.4 B gives 32400000000 as the median.  
Uncertainty: σ ≈ 1500000000 (about 4.6 %). 90 % CI ≈ ±4200000000, bounded to company hint range. Converted to percentiles below.

Probability calibration

Mean ≈ 32400000000, median 32400000000, SD 1500000000  
10–90 range 30000000000–34300000000 aligns with evidence and hint corridor.

Checklist:
1. Target: Alphabet constant-currency Q4-2025 revenue, EMEA, dollars, resolves on Feb 4 2026.  
2. Base rate 32000000000 from long-run 29 % share of expected 110 B total.  
3. Implied median 32400000000; mean 32400000000; consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: (i) stable 29 % EMEA share, (ii) Q3 total 102.35 B, (iii) Q4 total-rev consensus 110–112 B, (iv) single 32.4 B EMEA consensus data, (v) mild EUR strength effect on CC calc.  
5. Blind-spot: major change in company’s constant-currency methodology could shift figure down by >1 B.
