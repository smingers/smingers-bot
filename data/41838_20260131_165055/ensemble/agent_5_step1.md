Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Captide.ai, 30 Jan 2025 – Reliable secondary summary of Alphabet’s FY-2024 10-K. Key facts: total 2024 revenue 350 bn USD (+14 % YoY), EMEA share 29 %. Factual, numbers match Alphabet filings; low opinion content.  
2. YCharts/Fiscal.ai feed, 17 Dec 2025 – Gives audited EMEA revenue by year (2024 = 102.1 bn USD). Factual, derived from SEC filings; good quality.  
3. Yahoo Finance screen, Jan 2026 – Only openly posted sell-side consensus for Q4-25 EMEA: 32.4 bn USD. Single source, but timely and from professional analyst aggregation; moderate reliability.  
4. Motley Fool transcript excerpt, 27 Nov 2025 – CFO Ashkenazi: “potential FX tail-wind to revenues in Q4”. Primary statement; good quality; applies to reported, not constant-currency numbers.  
5. Investing.com Brasil, 31 Oct 2025 – Alphabet Q1-25 results: revenue 90.2 bn USD (+12 % YoY, +14 % cc). Primary data; solid.  
6. Hotchkis & Wiley fund letter, 30 Jan 2026 – Notes Alphabet beat “across all segments” in Q3-25 and topped 100 bn USD revenue. Uses SEC filings; factual.  
7. Barchart.com preview, 22 Oct 2025 – Analyst expectations for Q3-25 EPS only; little regional data; low relevance.  
8. Other news items in the packet concern unrelated firms; ignored for modelling.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Alphabet’s own EMEA constant-currency Q4 revenues 2019-2024 (ideal, but quarterly table only public since 2021).  
• Alphabet total company Q4 revenue growth history, then apply stable EMEA mix.  
• Peer mega-cap ad platforms’ EMEA revenue growth (Meta, Amazon Ads) – weaker fit.  
Most suitable: “Alphabet total company Q4 YoY growth → EMEA grows at a small discount (≈ 1 pp) and keeps a 28–30 % mix”. This uses company-specific, macro-adjusted data and matches constant-currency treatment.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until earnings release/resolution: 4 days. Alphabet normally guides little during the close-out period; late macro shocks are unlikely to move the already-finished quarter. History: last five Q4 YoY cc growth rates were +20 %, +32 %, +14 %, +14 %, +11 % (2019-2023 → 2024). Sequential Q3→Q4 lift for EMEA averaged about +9 %. Seasonality is very stable.  

(d) Justification – outside view  
1. Base level: Q4-24 EMEA cc revenue ≈ 29.4 bn USD (derived from FY-24 102.1 bn, assuming 28.8 % weight for Q4).  
2. Companywide YoY cc growth looks to have decelerated slightly in 2025: Q1 +14 %, Q2 ≈ 13 %, Q3 ≈ 12 %. Apply 11–12 % to Q4.  
3. EMEA under-indexes growth to U.S. by about 1 pp (slower EU macro). Ergo expect ~10 % YoY for EMEA.  
4. 29.4 bn × 1.10 = 32.3 bn USD – practically identical to the Yahoo consensus of 32.4 bn USD → good triangulation.  
5. Uncertainty drivers (within 4 days): final ad billing true-ups (±1 %), cloud momentum (+0-0.5 bn), Middle East ad pause (-0-0.3 bn). Overall 1 σ ≈ 0.9 bn (≈ 3 %).  
6. Add tail cushion for model error & data miscoding (double σ).  

Outside view calibration:
• Assume log-normal-ish uncertainty with 7 % 90 %-width (≈ ±2.3 bn on a 32.5 bn centre).  
• Tail risk of a big miss/beat (> 8 %) historically occurs < 5 % of the time.  
• Anchor median at 32.5 bn USD, skew slightly right (AI upside > macro downside).
