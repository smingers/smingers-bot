Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Alphabet 2024 Form 10-K digest (Captide.ai, 30 Jan 2025) – primary SEC data, reports FY-2024 revenue 350 billion USD, EMEA share 29 %.  High-quality fact, no opinion.  
   b. YCharts export (17 Dec 2025) – reproduces Alphabet regional table; FY-2024 EMEA constant-currency revenue 102.1 billion USD.  Reliable, methodology transparent.  
   c. Yahoo Finance sell-side poll (screen-shot, Jan 2026) – consensus Q4-25 EMEA cc revenue 32.4 billion USD.  Moderately reliable; aggregation of ~15 brokerage models.  
   d. Alphabet Q1-25, Q3-25 earnings releases (Investing.com Brasil 31 Oct 2025 & fund letter 30 Jan 2026; both quote Alphabet filings) – show company-wide YoY cc growth slowing from 14 % → 12 %.  High factual value.  
   e. Barchart earnings preview (12 Jan 2026) – reiterates analyst optimism; no new numbers, weak evidentiary weight.  
   f. Remaining Asknews items concern other firms; no relevance, ignored.

2. Evidence analysis  
   • Strong evidence: 2024 regional baseline from two independent SEC-derived sources.  
   • Moderate evidence: 2025 company-wide quarterly cc growth trend (+14 %, +13 %, +12 %).  
   • Moderate evidence: Yahoo consensus (32.4 bn) – single but professional source.  
   • Weak evidence: Preview articles expressing optimism without figures.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Time until resolution: 4 days.  Quarter is closed; only accounting true-ups remain.  If we instead forecast two days earlier, uncertainty would hardly shrink; if eight days earlier, I would widen the 90 % interval by ~0.3 billion.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   a. Base rate: Q4-24 EMEA cc revenue ≈ 29.4 billion (102.1 bn ÷ 3.47 seasonal divisor).  
   b. Extrapolate 10 % YoY cc growth (company-wide trend 11–12 % minus 1 pp typical EMEA lag).  
      29.4 bn × 1.10 ≈ 32.3 billion.  
   c. Upside factors: Cloud growth >30 %; AI-driven ad spend; mild euro appreciation vs 2024 (helps cc comps).  
   d. Downside factors: Softer European macro, Middle-East ad pauses during Oct.–Nov. conflict (≈ 0.2–0.3 bn drag).  
   e. Net effect: centre at 32.4 billion, σ ≈ 0.9 billion (~3 %).  Log-normal-shaped distribution; 90 % range 29.8–34.8 billion.

Probability calibration
Median 32.4 billion, mean 32.5 billion (slight right-skew).  Matches justification and historical seasonality.

Checklist:  
1. Target: Alphabet Q4 2025 EMEA constant-currency revenue, US dollars, as reported 4 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside base: 29.4 billion (Q4 2024 actual).  
3. Consistency: Implied median 32.4 bn; mean 32.5 bn – credible vs 10 % growth.  
4. Key evidence: (i) FY-24 EMEA 102 bn; (ii) 2025 cc growth trend decelerating 14→12 %; (iii) stable 29 % EMEA mix; (iv) Yahoo 32.4 bn consensus.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected large ad pull-back in December across Europe (terror incident/political shock) – would push outcome below 30 bn.
