Query: Retrieve consensus estimates and historical Q4/Q3 lift for Alphabet EMEA revenue; summarise seasonal pattern since 2020 and any management guidance given on Q3-25 call
The new batch of sources moves the ball forward on only one of the four data needs in the user’s brief.

1. Consensus estimate for Q4-25 EMEA revenue  
  • Still just a single openly-available number: Yahoo Finance shows Street consensus at US $32.4 billion for “Revenues – EMEA” in Q4-25. No other free site surfaced a regional forecast, and neither Market-Screener nor Sherwood News breaks out geography.  
  • Result: one un-corroborated consensus figure (Yahoo Finance, prior round). Additional pay-wall sources (Bloomberg, FactSet, Visible Alpha) are still required for validation.

2. Historical Q4-over-Q3 lift in EMEA revenue  
  • YCharts now provides audited *annual* EMEA totals: 2019 $50.6 bn; 2020 $55.4 bn; 2021 $79.1 bn; 2022 $82.1 bn; 2023 $91.0 bn; 2024 $102.1 bn (data feed: Fiscal.ai, last updated 17 Dec 2025) [YCharts].  
  • However, annual figures cannot be used to compute a Q4/Q3 sequential lift. For that, Note 13 of every Form 10-Q is still the sole authoritative source, and none of the links exposed the quarterly table in HTML or PDF.  
  • Result: the Q4/Q3 percentage change remains unavailable for 2020-23. The only calculable data point continues to be the approximated +9 % lift from Q3-24 to Q4-24 (assumed steady 29 % regional mix), which is *not* a primary-source number.

3. Seasonal pattern in EMEA revenue since 2020  
  • All qualitative evidence is unchanged: EMEA follows Alphabet’s classic advertising seasonality—strongest in Q4 (holiday advertising), softest in Q1—with a smaller mid-year uptick in Q3. CNBC’s earnings coverage for Q1-20 and Q3-25, as well as Alphabet’s own commentary about “holiday-driven strength” (multiple earlier sources), reinforce that view.  
  • The new YCharts series confirms the upward skew each calendar year but remains annual, so precise intra-year percentages are still missing.

4. Management guidance specific to EMEA on the Q3-25 earnings call  
  • No additional transcript excerpt mentions Europe, Middle East or Africa. The only region-relevant forward-looking statements located so far are:  
      – CFO Anat Ashkenazi flagged a “potential FX tail-wind to revenues in Q4” as the euro strengthened versus the U.S. dollar (Motley Fool transcript, 27 Nov 2025).  
      – She also cautioned that U.S. election-related ad comps in Q4-24 would create tougher growth comparisons two years out, with an implied softer outlook for non-U.S. (including EMEA) ad markets in Q4-26.  
  • There is still zero commentary on European macro, vertical demand, or cloud adoption in the call excerpts found.

Comprehensive answer to the original query (what we can state now):

• Consensus estimate – Alphabet EMEA revenue Q4-25: US $32.4 bn (single-source, Yahoo Finance).  
• Historical Q4/Q3 lift – precise data absent; only an indicative +9 % sequential rise from Q3-24 to Q4-24 can be inferred by applying a stable 29 % EMEA share to consolidated revenue (company filings), but this is an approximation.  
• Seasonal pattern since 2020 – consistent holiday-led spike in Q4, trough in Q1, moderate recovery in Q2-Q3, corroborated qualitatively by CNBC’s Q1-20 report and every annual revenue tallied by YCharts.  
• Management guidance on Q3-25 call – FX tail-wind expected in Q4-25; longer-term head-wind in Q4-26 as U.S. election comps normalise. No explicit EMEA demand commentary.

Remaining gaps that prevent a fully quantitative answer:

1. Quarterly EMEA revenue for each period Q1-20 through Q3-25 (needed to compute actual Q4/Q3 lifts).  
2. At least one independent consensus source to corroborate or challenge the Yahoo Finance US $32.4 bn estimate.  
3. The full, unabridged Q3-25 transcript (Google IR site or FactSet) to ensure no latent EMEA comments were missed.

Next research steps:

a) Download every Alphabet Form 10-Q from EDGAR, open Note 13 and extract the “Revenue by geography” table for each quarter; then calculate the exact Q4/Q3 change for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.  
b) Access a professional consensus platform (Bloomberg, FactSet, Visible Alpha) that maintains broker-model regional splits; pull the mean and median EMEA revenue forecast for Q4-25.  
c) Run keyword filters (“EMEA”, “Europe”, “U.K.”, “Germany”, “Middle East”) against the *full* Q3-25 call transcript to confirm whether any granular commentary exists.

Until those documents are secured, the numeric component of the brief cannot be finalised; nonetheless, all publicly-available qualitative insights and the only accessible quantitative figures are summarised above.</Agent_report>

Query: What will Alphabet's Q4 2025 constant-currency revenues be in these global regions? (EMEA)
Here are the relevant news articles:

**ManpowerGroup Q4 Earnings Call Highlights**
ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results showing stabilization and sequential improvement in key metrics, with revenue of $4.7 billion in organic constant currency growth of 2% and system-wide revenue of $5.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $100 million, with a margin of 2.1%, matching the prior year and aligning with guidance. CEO Jonas Prising noted strengthening trends in key markets like the U.S. and France, though he cautioned against declaring a broad-based recovery. Engagement levels remained steady despite cautious client hiring. Manpower revenue grew 5% organically, Experis declined 6% (improving from 7% in Q3), and Talent Solutions declined 4% (improving from 8%). Gross profit margin was 16.3%, slightly below guidance due to lower permanent recruitment in Europe, where perm demand remains historically low. Cost discipline was emphasized, with a 4% constant currency reduction in SG&A and Northern Europe achieving positive operating profit for the first time in five quarters. Regional performance varied: Italy showed 7% days-adjusted growth and strong margins; France improved from -4% to -2% monthly decline; Germany declined 22% days-adjusted but with expected improvement in Q1 2026; the U.S. saw a 1% revenue decline but stronger-than-expected performance in MSP and Manpower; APME grew 6% with Japan up 7%. AI and digitization initiatives, including PowerSuite (used in 90% of operations) and an AI Recruiter Toolkit, drove a 7% increase in placement rates. Executives highlighted client interest in flexible work models and AI-driven workforce transformation. The company reaffirmed a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 4.5% to 5%, with expected year-over-year improvement over the next four years. For Q1 2026, ManpowerGroup guided EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 and constant currency revenue between a 1% decline and 3% growth (midpoint: 1% growth). The full-year global tax rate is estimated at 45%, excluding benefits from the unextended U.S. Workers' Opportunity Tax Credit.

**Meta Platforms Could Do the Unthinkable to Google This Year**
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported a 24% revenue increase in Q4 2025 to $59.9 billion, with net income rising 9% to $22.8 billion ($8.88 per share), despite margin pressure from increased spending. The company issued first-quarter 2026 guidance of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion in revenue, representing a 30% year-over-year increase, including a 4% foreign currency tailwind—its fastest quarterly growth in five years. Meta's advertising revenue, which accounted for $196.2 billion of its $201 billion total 2025 revenue, grew 22% in 2025. CFO Susan Li attributed this growth to AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and generative AI tools for advertisers. Based on Q1 guidance, Meta’s ad revenue could reach $251.1 billion in 2026. Alphabet’s advertising revenue through Q3 2025 was $161.4 billion, and if it grows 12% in Q4, it would total $222 billion for 2025. Projected 12% growth in 2026 would yield $248.7 billion, slightly below Meta’s forecast. However, Alphabet’s total ad revenue—including YouTube and Google Network—exceeds $300 billion, giving it a current advantage. Despite this, Meta has outgrown Alphabet in revenue growth over nearly every quarter of the last decade, except during the post-pandemic period. The article argues that Meta’s social media-based advertising model, enhanced by AI, gives it a strategic edge in the AI era, potentially enabling it to surpass Alphabet’s entire advertising business within a few years. While Alphabet has responded to AI competition with Google Gemini and AI overviews in search, Meta’s proactive use of AI in ad targeting and creation is seen as a growth driver. The article concludes that Meta is well-positioned to become the world’s largest advertising business and a market-beater in 2026 and beyond.

**Enea AB (FRA:EED5) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Record Prof**
Enea AB (FRA:EED5) reported its highest Q4 profitability in four years, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%, reflecting strong financial management. The company saw significant growth in core products, with Deep Packet Inspection rising nearly 20% and Traffic Management increasing over 30%. Enea successfully contained a cyber incident in Q4 without financial loss or customer disruption, underscoring its cybersecurity resilience. The company also signed 10 new customers across EMEA, North America, and Asia Pacific, signaling market expansion. A new strategic focus on market acceleration, vertical expansion, and product evolution was announced to drive future growth. However, net sales declined by 5% in Q4 2025 due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, primarily from a 20% appreciation of the Swedish krona against the US dollar over the past year. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital decreased, attributed to volatile financial net positions—SEK41 million positive in Q4 2024 versus SEK6 million negative in Q4 2025—linked to currency fluctuations. Despite large announced contracts, revenue growth was not realized in Q4, indicating challenges in order-to-revenue conversion. The company cited the need to restructure its sales organization into a more customer-centric model as the primary growth constraint, though market dynamics remain positive. CEO Teemu Salmi noted increasing customer interest in Swedish firms due to data sovereignty concerns amid geopolitical tensions, positioning Enea as a trusted alternative to US and Israeli competitors. CFO Ulf Stigberg explained that rising net working capital is due to business mix, particularly longer payment cycles in certain development areas, with ongoing efforts to mitigate this trend.

**Increased Investor Optimism Lifted Alphabet (GOOGL) in Q4**
Hotchkis & Wiley Global Value Fund reported a 3.80% return in the fourth quarter of 2025, outperforming the MSCI World Value Index's 3.34%. The Fund's year-to-date return was 23.77%, compared to 20.79% for the Index, driven by positive stock selection. The Fund remained overweight in non-US equities, where international stocks outperformed US stocks in 2025, though the valuation gap remained stable. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was highlighted as a leading contributor in the Fund's performance. The company’s stock returned 7.33% in one month and gained 65.79% over the past 52 weeks, closing at $338.25 per share on January 29, 2026, with a market capitalization of $4.097 trillion. Strong third-quarter 2025 results, which beat expectations across all segments, boosted investor confidence, particularly in Alphabet’s ability to monetize AI opportunities. Google’s new AI products reportedly captured significant market share from OpenAI’s ChatGPT in consumer chatbot usage. Alphabet achieved its first-ever $100 billion in quarterly revenue in Q3 2025. The company ranked fourth among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, with 243 hedge fund portfolios holding it at the end of Q3 2025—up from 219 in Q2. While the Fund acknowledges Alphabet’s strong position, it believes certain other AI stocks offer greater upside with lower downside risk. The article also references a free report on undervalued AI stocks benefiting from Trump-era tariffs and onshoring trends.

**Swatch Starts 2026 with Strong Momentum Despite 2025 Challenges**
Swatch Group reported a 6% decline in group revenue to 6.3 billion Swiss francs in 2025, following a 15% drop in 2024, with the highest-ever revenue of 8.7 billion francs recorded in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by weak demand in China, a strong Swiss franc causing a 308 million franc negative currency impact, and a significant drop in operating profit (EBIT) from 304 million to 135 million francs, and net profit from 250 million to 25 million francs. Despite this, the company reported positive momentum in the second half of 2025, with a 4.7% revenue increase in local currencies, accelerating to 7.2% in the fourth quarter across all price segments. Growth was particularly strong in North America, where revenue rose nearly 20% in constant currency, and also in India, the Middle East, and Poland. China, Hong Kong, and Macau saw recovery in the second half of 2025, returning to growth in local currency. Swatch Group maintained its dividend at 4.50 Swiss francs per share despite the profit decline, signaling confidence in future recovery. The company avoided layoffs and short-time work to remain prepared for growth, using idle staff for R&D. The stock rose nearly 10% to over 175 Swiss francs on January 30, 2026, rebounding from a low of 130 francs in summer 2025. CEO Nick Hayek expressed optimism for 2026, forecasting positive revenue and volume growth and improved profitability, citing renewed global market dynamism.

**Adidas Posts Record 2025 Revenues of €24.8 Billion and Announces €1 Billion Buyback**
Adidas reported record revenues of €24.8 billion for 2025, a 13% increase at constant exchange rates (10% including the Yeezy sales comparison effect from 2024), despite a negative impact from currency fluctuations exceeding €1 billion. The company's performance was driven by strong margins: the gross margin improved to 50.8% in the fourth quarter (up 100 basis points) and reached 51.6% for the full year, up 80 basis points year-on-year, despite headwinds such as higher tariffs and unfavorable exchange rates. Operating profit more than doubled to €1.64 billion in Q4 and reached €2.056 billion for the full year, with an operating margin of 8.3%, up 2.6 percentage points. Growth was double-digit across all markets and channels, supported by a sales mix increasingly focused on full-price selling. In response to the strong results, Adidas's board announced a share buyback program of up to €1 billion starting in February 2026, funded by internal cash flow and aimed at canceling the repurchased shares, signaling confidence to the market. Analysts at Barclays described the Q4 results as a 'slight beat' overall, with revenues and margins exceeding Bloomberg consensus estimates, particularly highlighting the gross margin of 50.8%, about 90 basis points above expectations, attributed to healthy full-price sales that offset currency and tariff impacts. The EBIT margin of 2.8% in Q4 also surpassed the expected 2.4%, and Barclays viewed the buyback as a positive signal of confidence, especially given the stock's performance over the past 12 months.

**Electrolux Q4 2025 Results: Cost Reductions Drive Margin Expansion Despite Regional Challenges**
Electrolux AB (OTC:0MDT) saw its stock rise 22.64% after reporting fourth-quarter 2025 results on January 30, 2026, driven by significant margin expansion and successful cost-reduction initiatives, despite regional challenges. The company reported a net revenue of 35.112 million SEK for Q4 2025, down from 37.968 million SEK in Q4 2024 due to a negative currency impact of -8.9%, though organic growth remained positive at 2.0% (down from 11.5% in the prior year). The operating result improved sharply to 1.517 million SEK (4.3% margin) from 1.052 million SEK (2.8% margin) in Q4 2024. Cash flow from operations after investments reached 5.179 million SEK, nearly double the 2.660 million SEK in Q4 2024, primarily due to working capital optimization, especially inventory management. Regionally, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia (EMEA) delivered 3.6% organic sales growth and a 6.3% operating margin (up from 3.7% in Q4 2024), while Latin America posted 4.1% organic growth and a strong 11.5% margin (up from 8.0%). In contrast, North America faced a 1.7% organic sales decline and an operating loss of 312 million SEK (vs. a 45 million SEK profit in Q4 2024), attributed to higher U.S. tariffs and adverse exchange rates. Electrolux achieved a 4 billion SEK cost reduction in 2025, exceeding its 3.5–4.0 billion SEK target, through product cost optimization, sourcing from lower-cost countries, and global scale advantages. For the full year 2025, organic revenue was 131.282 million SEK (3.9% growth), and operating profit rose to 3.7 billion SEK (2.8% margin) from 1.1 billion SEK (0.8% margin) in 2024. Sustainability goals were advanced, with 45% of the 85% Scope 1 & 2 emissions target and 33% of the 42% Scope 3 target achieved. For 2026, Electrolux forecasts neutral-to-negative market conditions in North America, neutral in Europe and Brazil, with expected positive contributions from volume, price, and product mix. The company aims 3.5–4.0 billion SEK in cost efficiency measures and projects 4 billion SEK in investments, focusing on customer experience and marketing. The CFO, Therese Friberg, highlighted improved liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.0x (down from 3.4x in 2024), supporting investment-grade credit standing. Electrolux is restructuring operations to enhance customer focus, clarify roles, and reduce duplication to boost efficiency.

**ManpowerGroup Inc (MAN) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Naviga**
ManpowerGroup Inc (MAN) reported Q4 2025 earnings with a revenue of $4.7 billion, reflecting a 2% organic constant currency growth, signaling stabilization in revenue trends. The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.1%, driven by improving demand in core markets, particularly in the US and France, where resilience was noted despite political and budget uncertainty. The Manpower brand grew for three consecutive quarters and six quarters in the US, while the diversified multi-brand portfolio continued to perform well. Cost discipline remained a priority, with a 4% constant currency reduction in SG&A expenses, contributing to improved profitability. However, challenges persist: permanent recruitment activity was weaker than expected in Europe, leading to a 30 basis point decline in gross profit margin. Experis declined by 6%, and Talent Solutions by 4%. The company reported a negative earnings per share of $0.29 for the full year, with a 38% constant currency decrease in adjusted EPS. Free cash flow turned negative at $161 million, compared to a $258 million inflow in the prior year. In the Q&A, CEO Jonas Prising emphasized the company’s AI integration through PowerSuite and Sophie AI, aiming to become an AI-enabled global people business, with expected EBITDA margin improvements over the next four years even in a moderate recovery. CFO Jack McGinnis highlighted ongoing progress in France, stability in the US, and strong momentum in Italy. The company expects continued improvement in cash flow and balance sheet management in 2026. Demand for flexible workers remains strong, with both clients and candidates valuing adaptability. AI is seen as more disruptive to white-collar roles, while blue-collar roles are more resilient.

**Weaker Dollar Hits Safilo's 2025 Revenue, but Margins Grew**
Safilo Group reported a 1% decline in preliminary 2025 sales to 983.4 million euros, primarily due to the weakening U.S. dollar against the euro. At constant exchange rates, sales rose 1.8%. In the fourth quarter, sales fell 4.6% to 225 million euros, but increased 0.4% at constant exchange. The company attributed growth to strong performance in Smith’s sports products and the continued expansion of its contemporary and lifestyle portfolios, with key brands including Carrera, David Beckham, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, Boss, Kate Spade, and Carolina Herrera playing a significant role in key markets and distribution channels. North America saw a 7% sales drop in Q4, but a 1.5% increase at constant exchange, driven by wholesale growth and a rebound in Smith’s retail sales, while Blenders remained weak in direct-to-consumer. For 2025, North America was down 2.6% but up 1.8% at constant exchange. Europe edged down 0.1% in Q4 due to lower volumes, the deconsolidation of Lenti (sold in June 2025), and delivery phasing, but revenue grew 2.3% in 2025, with mid-single-digit organic growth in prescription frames. Asia-Pacific sales dropped 17.4% in Q4, or 11.5% at constant exchange, while the rest of the world rose 3.9% at constant exchange. In 2025, Asia-Pacific was up 1.3% and the rest of the world down 10%. Safilo reported improved margins: fourth-quarter gross margin reached 61.9% (up 240 basis points YoY), full-year gross margin was 60.9% (up 120 bps). EBITDA margin in Q4 was 6.7% (up 120 bps), and full-year 2025 EBITDA margin reached 10.8% (up 280 bps), driven by price adjustments in North America, shifting sourcing outside China, and favorable price/mix dynamics. Free cash flow for 2025 was 55 million euros, including 11.9 million euros from the Lenti disposal, and net debt stood at 46 million euros after a 18 million euro share buyback. In December 2025, Safilo acquired 25% of Inspecs Group for approximately 21.7 million pounds. The company stated it remains focused on organic growth and selective acquisitions in 2026 amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, aiming to strengthen profitability and cash generation to create sustainable long-term value.

**ALTEN Reports 2025 Annual Revenue: Decline Amid Sectoral Shifts and Signs of Stabilization**
ALTEN reported its 2025 annual revenue results, showing a year-end decline of -1.1% overall, with +4.3% growth in France and -3.7% outside France. At constant perimeter and exchange rates, the decline was -4.5% (-3.6% in France, -4.9% outside France). In the fourth quarter, revenue reached €1,023 million, down -0.35% compared to Q4 2024. Organic decline at constant data was -2.2% (-2.4% in France, -2.2% outside France). The decline was primarily driven by a 16% drop in the Automotive sector, with smaller declines in Telecoms, Other Industries, Electronics, and Public Sector. In contrast, Defense/Safety, Naval, and Energy sectors showed significant growth. The fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations, with Aerospace and Banking/Finance sectors returning to growth. Southern Europe continued strong growth, while Eastern Europe and APAC remained stable. Other regions, except the UK, Benelux, and Nordics, showed gradual improvement. The improved Q4 performance is expected to boost the operating margin to exceed 8.1% of revenue in 2025, as previously estimated on October 23, 2025. The company also completed several acquisitions: a life sciences firm in the US and India (€7.5M, 120 consultants), an embedded software firm in India (€5.2M, 270 consultants), a digital transformation firm in Spain and Latin America (€19M, 300 consultants), and a life sciences firm in France and Belgium (€20.5M, 190 consultants). Activity is gradually stabilizing across sectors, with Aerospace and Banking/Finance already showing growth in Q4 2025. The first half of 2026 will confirm this trend. Annual results for 2025 will be published on Tuesday, February 24, 2026, with a conference on Wednesday, February 25, 2026. ALTEN, a global leader in engineering and IT services, operates in industrial, telecom, and tertiary sectors. The stock is listed on Euronext Paris (ISIN FR0000071946), part of the SBF 120, IT CAC 50, and MIDCAP 100 indices, and eligible for SRD. ALTEN uses alternative performance indicators (non-IFRS) to supplement IFRS metrics, assessing intrinsic performance by excluding currency and consolidation perimeter effects. Constant data growth is calculated by removing the impact of exchange rate changes and consolidation perimeter shifts.

**Ferragamo, Revenues Down 2% in Q4 Amid Weakness in Europe**
Ferragamo reported preliminary consolidated revenues of 282 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2025, a 2% decrease at constant exchange rates compared to the same period in 2024, which aligns closely with the Visible Alpha consensus of 284 million euros. The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel drove performance, accelerating compared to the prior quarter and showing positive trends across all regions, while the wholesale channel experienced a double-digit decline due to a strategic shift toward key customers and a more selective distribution model. Sales in North America grew by 2% at constant exchange rates, while revenues in the EMEA region fell by 10.9% and in Asia-Pacific by 2.3%, though signs of improvement were noted in Korea, China, and Southeast Asia. Ferragamo stated that in 2026 it will focus on consolidating current momentum, fully developing its new brand positioning, and reviewing its retail distribution network, a period during which the company has remained without a CEO for nearly a year.

**Midwich Group Returns to Growth in Second Half of 2025**
Midwich Group plc (LON:MIDW), a global specialist in audiovisual distribution, reported on Tuesday, January 20, 2026, that full-year 2025 revenues are expected to reach approximately £1.3 billion, in line with 2024 levels but showing a return to growth in the second half of the year. Adjusted pre-tax profit is expected to be in line with the Board’s prior expectations of £30 million, with gross margins broadly consistent with the previous year. At constant currency, continuing revenues were slightly below 2024 levels, with organic revenues about 1.5% lower, combining a roughly 3% decline in the first half with a 0.5% increase in the second half. The UK and Ireland segment, accounting for about 40% of group revenues, grew by approximately 7% year-on-year, driven by new supplier launches and increased market share. Revenues in the EMEA region declined by about 5.5% at constant currency, with a 7% drop in the first half and a 4% decline in the second half, affected by weakness in the German corporate market and delayed purchasing decisions in the education sector awaiting federal funding, now approved with projects set to begin in 2026. North American operations saw a revenue decline of approximately 5% at constant currency, impacted by tariff uncertainty and planned transitions to new technical suppliers. The Group generated strong cash flow in 2025, exceeding 100% of adjusted EBITDA—above the long-term target range of 70–80%. Net adjusted debt as of December 31, 2025, was approximately £130 million, slightly lower than at December 2024, representing about 2.3 times adjusted EBITDA. CEO Stephen Fenby noted that despite a challenging year for the sector, the company implemented initiatives to improve future performance, including developing new supplier and customer relationships and pursuing operational efficiencies.

EPAM Systems Inc. reported strong third-quarter 2025 financial results, with revenue reaching $1.394 billion, a 19.4% year-over-year increase on a reported basis and 7.1% organic constant currency growth, exceeding expectations. The company achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year organic constant currency growth, driven by demand in AI-native services, data, and cloud modernization.

EPAM launched its AI Run Transform strategy, a unified AI framework combining AI innovation, business transformation, and AI-native engineering.

**Alphabet's Q1 2025 Results Reveal Strong AI Demand and Profitability Across Cloud, Ads, and Consumer Products**
The first-quarter 2025 financial results from Alphabet (Google's parent company) reveal strong evidence of growing global demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue reached $90.2 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase (14% in constant currency), driven by double-digit growth in Google Search, YouTube advertising, subscriptions, and Google Cloud—all fueled by AI innovations. Google Cloud revenue surged 28% to $12.3 billion, with significant growth in AI infrastructure, platform services, and generative AI solutions, indicating rising corporate adoption of AI. Operating profit rose 20% to $30.6 billion, with an operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that AI investments are already enhancing efficiency and profitability. Net profit increased 46% to $34.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share grew 49% to $2.81. The company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, highlighted the launch of Gemini 2.5, described as Alphabet’s most advanced AI model to date, underpinning future innovation. Consumer adoption is also rising, with Alphabet surpassing 270 million paid subscriptions across YouTube and Google One, driven by AI-powered features. On April 23, 2025, the board approved a $70 billion share repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share, signaling confidence in sustained cash flow and long-term value creation in the AI era. These results reinforce Alphabet’s strategic leadership in both AI infrastructure and consumer-facing applications, with a diversified revenue model that includes cloud, advertising, subscriptions, and strategic investments. The company’s ability to scale AI across multiple business lines while expanding margins underscores its competitive advantage. The broader AI landscape among hyperscalers—Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—shows distinct strategies: Google’s full-stack integration, Microsoft’s enterprise focus via OpenAI and Azure, and Amazon’s AWS dominance—creating a dynamic, overlapping competition. Despite risks like regulatory challenges, slower corporate adoption, and technological obsolescence, Alphabet’s performance indicates these risks are currently manageable. The company’s robust financials, strong cash generation, and sustained double-digit growth across key segments confirm that AI is no longer experimental but a core engine of revenue, efficiency, and shareholder value. The results suggest that AI-driven growth is both scalable and profitable, with hyperscalers consolidating power through massive infrastructure investments, data advantages, and network effects. Investors are increasingly confident, as demonstrated by capital allocation decisions and the company’s continued commitment to AI investment despite short-term margin pressure.

**Paris Pre-Market: CAC 40 on the Brink of Historic High Amid Positive Global Sentiment and Strong Corporate Results**
The Paris stock market is expected to open higher on October 21, 2025, with the CAC 40 poised to surpass its previous historical high of 8,259.19 points set on May 10, 2024, and its annual peak of 8,257.88 points on March 3, 2024. Positive sentiment is driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s indication that he may reduce tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing resumes soybean purchases, and by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks that U.S.-China relations have 'de-escalated,' with a planned meeting scheduled with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Additionally, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, suggested the U.S. government shutdown could end this week. On Wall Street, major indices rose: the S&P 500 gained 1.07% to 6,735 points, the Nasdaq surged 1.37% to 22,990 points, and the Dow Jones increased 1.12% to 46,706 points. Key corporate updates include Planisware reporting a 5.7% year-on-year revenue increase to €49.6 million in Q3 2025, with constant currency growth at +9% and a 10.3% year-to-date increase. The company reaffirmed its 2025 targets: 10% constant currency revenue growth, ~36% adjusted EBITDA margin, and ~80% cash conversion ratio. Eurofins reported organic revenue growth of 4.2% in Q3 2025, with total revenue of €5.415 billion for the first nine months, up 5.3% year-on-year, and confirmed its 2025 and 2027 financial goals. Getlink saw a 1% constant currency revenue growth in Q3 to €472 million, confirming its 2025 EBITDA target of €780–830 million. OVHcloud achieved €1.0846 billion in revenue in 2025, a 9.3% increase at comparable data, with EBITDA margin rising to 40.4% and net profit of €0.4 million, up from a net loss of €10.3 million in 2024. Interparfums reported a 1.6% increase in Q3 revenue at constant currencies (€261.7 million), with nine-month revenue at €710 million (constant currencies), up 4.4% year-on-year. Edenred and Visa announced a strategic partnership to enhance payment ecosystems, with Edenred’s Q3 revenue growing 8.2% year-on-year to €667 million. BNP Paribas faced a U.S. jury verdict finding it complicit in Sudan-related atrocities due to transactions financing the regime’s military, prompting the bank to announce an appeal. Analysts issued revised ratings: MedioBanca downgraded BNP Paribas to 'neutral' (target: €80.30), Cantor downgraded Ubisoft to 'underperform' (target: €7.10), Bernstein initiated 'outperform' on Exail (target: €150) and Interparfums (target: €37.70), adjusted Forvia to 'market perform' (€10), raised Sartorius Stedim to 'buy' (€236), and reduced Vinci to 'outperform' (€139).

Guerbet reported first‑half 2025 consolidated results with revenue of 387.8 M€, a 5.4 % decline at constant currency (TCC) and comparable scope, mainly due to a contraction of French sales following the March 2024 supply‑chain reform.

The company’s net equity stood at 376 M€, down from 394 M€ a year earlier, and net debt fell to 353.3 M€. Management revised 2025 financial targets to a slight revenue decline of about –1 % at TCC, EBITDA margin of 12‑13 % and a slightly negative free cash flow, citing ongoing French market challenges and pricing pressures. A senior executive quoted: 'Les résultats du premier semestre 2025, sont très en deçà de nos attentes.' The statement underscores the need for rapid corrective action, as noted by Hugues Lecat, chairman, who highlighted the importance of sales recovery, interventional imaging growth, margin discipline and cash generation.

1. Alphabet has not yet released its official Q4 2025 earnings report (scheduled for February 4, 2026) [12][13]
2. Current analyst previews and news coverage [1][2][3][16] focus on global segment performance (Search, YouTube, Cloud) rather than geographic breakdowns
3. While reports indicate favorable FX impacts contributing to global results [1][3], no regional constant-currency figures are disclosed
4. The EMEA region is not specifically discussed in any earnings previews within the analyzed documents

For verified EMEA regional data, please refer to:
- Alphabet's investor relations site after February 4 earnings release
- SEC Form 8-K filing for complete segment reporting
- Supplementary financial schedules typically issued with earnings

Until official release, this remains non-public information not available through news sources.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
