Analysis:
To estimate Alphabet’s Q4-2025 constant-currency revenue for EMEA I need three kinds of current information:

1. Management signals since the Q3-2025 earnings call  
   • Any qualitative guidance or numeric “out-look” comments about regional growth, paid-clicks, CPC, or FX headwinds/tailwinds given in late-October 2025 or at subsequent conferences or SEC filings.  
   • Indications of how advertising demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa trended during the holiday quarter (e.g., comments on Black Friday/Cyber-Monday search volumes, retail vertical strength, YouTube momentum, cloud uptake in EMEA, etc.).

2. Sell-side & industry forecasts for Q4-2025  
   • Consensus models from firms such as Morgan Stanley, Bernstein, Barclays, or JPMorgan that often break out “Google Advertising” and “EMEA” constant-currency figures.  
   • Digital-ad-spend trackers (IAB Europe, WARC, eMarketer) that may give updated YoY growth expectations for the region through December 2025.  
   • Any pre-earnings “whisper numbers” or preview notes published in January 2026.

3. Macroeconomic and regulatory context  
   • Euro-area, U.K., and Middle-East GDP and retail-sales prints for Oct-Dec 2025 to gauge advertiser sentiment.  
   • Effects of the Digital Markets Act, U.K. CMA investigations, or regional privacy fines that might have altered monetisation in Q4.  
   • Currency moves: although results are reported “constant currency,” large intra-quarter swings can still change advertiser budgets and hence revenue.

Current news articles, analyst notes, and Alphabet statements covering these topics will provide the most direct inputs for building a distribution around the eventual Q4-2025 EMEA constant-currency revenue figure.
