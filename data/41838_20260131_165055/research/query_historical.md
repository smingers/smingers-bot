Analysis:
The eventual Q4-25 constant-currency EMEA revenue will mainly be driven by three things that can be inferred from history:  
1. Alphabet’s strong seasonality – Q4 is always the largest quarter (holiday advertising).  
2. The prevailing YoY growth trend in EMEA – over the last 10 quarters it accelerated from mid-single digits in 2023 to low-double digits in 2025 (11.8 % in Q3-25).  
3. Management guidance and macro indicators – Alphabet usually provides qualitative colour in the Q3 call that hints at Q4 demand, while European ad-spend trackers give an outside view.  

To build an outside-view baseline I will (a) calculate the median Q4/Q3 step-up in EMEA revenues since 2020, (b) examine whether years with similar Q3 YoY growth produced above- or below-trend Q4s, (c) cross-check with consensus estimates that may already incorporate management guidance.  
The spreadsheet linked in the prompt contains all the raw quarterly numbers needed for (a) and (b); what I still need are (1) the exact Q4 2024 and earlier EMEA figures for the seasonality calculation, (2) any commentary from Alphabet’s Q3-25 earnings call about Q4, and (3) sell-side/press consensus for Q4-25. Those are the historical inputs most useful for constructing a distribution of possible Q4-25 outcomes.
