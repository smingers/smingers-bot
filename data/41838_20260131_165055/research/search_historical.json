Consensus estimate for Q4-25 EMEA revenue  \n  \u2022 Still just a single openly-available number: Yahoo Finance shows Street consensus at US $32.4 billion for \u201cRevenues \u2013 EMEA\u201d in Q4-25. No other free site surfaced a regional forecast, and neither Market-Screener nor Sherwood News breaks out geography.  \n  \u2022 Result: one un-corroborated consensus figure (Yahoo Finance, prior round). Additional pay-wall sources (Bloomberg, FactSet, Visible Alpha) are still required for validation.\n\n2. Historical Q4-over-Q3 lift in EMEA revenue  \n  \u2022 YCharts now provides audited *annual* EMEA totals: 2019 $50.6 bn; 2020 $55.4 bn; 2021 $79.1 bn; 2022 $82.1 bn; 2023 $91.0 bn; 2024 $102.1 bn (data feed: Fiscal.ai, last updated 17 Dec 2025) [YCharts].  \n  \u2022 However, annual figures cannot be used to compute a Q4/Q3 sequential lift. For that, Note 13 of every Form 10-Q is still the sole authoritative source, and none of the links exposed the quarterly table in HTML or PDF.  \n  \u2022 Result: the Q4/Q3 percentage change remains unavailable for 2020-23. The only calculable data point continues to be the approximated +9 % lift from Q3-24 to Q4-24 (assumed steady 29 % regional mix), which is *not* a primary-source number.\n\n3. Seasonal pattern in EMEA revenue since 2020  \n  \u2022 All qualitative evidence is unchanged: EMEA follows Alphabet\u2019s classic advertising seasonality\u2014strongest in Q4 (holiday advertising), softest in Q1\u2014with a smaller mid-year uptick in Q3. CNBC\u2019s earnings coverage for Q1-20 and Q3-25, as well as Alphabet\u2019s own commentary about \u201choliday-driven strength\u201d (multiple earlier sources), reinforce that view.  \n  \u2022 The new YCharts series confirms the upward skew each calendar year but remains annual, so precise intra-year percentages are still missing.\n\n4. Management guidance specific to EMEA on the Q3-25 earnings call  \n  \u2022 No additional transcript excerpt mentions Europe, Middle East or Africa. The only region-relevant forward-looking statements located so far are:  \n      \u2013 CFO Anat Ashkenazi flagged a \u201cpotential FX tail-wind to revenues in Q4\u201d as the euro strengthened versus the U.S. dollar (Motley Fool transcript, 27 Nov 2025).  \n      \u2013 She also cautioned that U.S. election-related ad comps in Q4-24 would create tougher growth comparisons two years out, with an implied softer outlook for non-U.S. (including EMEA) ad markets in Q4-26.  \n  \u2022 There is still zero commentary on European macro, vertical demand, or cloud adoption in the call excerpts found.\n\nComprehensive answer to the original query (what we can state now):\n\n\u2022 Consensus estimate \u2013 Alphabet EMEA revenue Q4-25: US $32.4 bn (single-source, Yahoo Finance).  \n\u2022 Historical Q4/Q3 lift \u2013 precise data absent; only an indicative +9 % sequential rise from Q3-24 to Q4-24 can be inferred by applying a stable 29 % EMEA share to consolidated revenue (company filings), but this is an approximation.  \n\u2022 Seasonal pattern since 2020 \u2013 consistent holiday-led spike in Q4, trough in Q1, moderate recovery in Q2-Q3, corroborated qualitatively by CNBC\u2019s Q1-20 report and every annual revenue tallied by YCharts.  \n\u2022 Management guidance on Q3-25 call \u2013 FX tail-wind expected in Q4-25; longer-term head-wind in Q4-26 as U.S. election comps normalise. No explicit EMEA demand commentary.\n\nRemaining gaps that prevent a fully quantitative answer:\n\n1. Quarterly EMEA revenue for each period Q1-20 through Q3-25 (needed to compute actual Q4/Q3 lifts).  \n2. At least one independent consensus source to corroborate or challenge the Yahoo Finance US $32.4 bn estimate.  \n3. The full, unabridged Q3-25 transcript (Google IR site or FactSet) to ensure no latent EMEA comments were missed.\n\nNext research steps:\n\na) Download every Alphabet Form 10-Q from EDGAR, open Note 13 and extract the \u201cRevenue by geography\u201d table for each quarter; then calculate the exact Q4/Q3 change for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.  \nb) Access a professional consensus platform (Bloomberg, FactSet, Visible Alpha) that maintains broker-model regional splits; pull the mean and median EMEA revenue forecast for Q4-25.  \nc) Run keyword filters (\u201cEMEA\u201d, \u201cEurope\u201d, \u201cU.K.\u201d, \u201cGermany\u201d, \u201cMiddle East\u201d) against the *full* Q3-25 call transcript to confirm whether any granular commentary exists.\n\nUntil those documents are secured, the numeric component of the brief cannot be finalised; nonetheless, all publicly-available qualitative insights and the only accessible quantitative figures are summarised above.</Agent_report>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: What will Alphabet's Q4 2025 constant-currency revenues be in these global regions? (EMEA)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**ManpowerGroup Q4 Earnings Call Highlights**\nManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) reported fourth-quarter 2025 results showing stabilization and sequential improvement in key metrics, with revenue of $4.7 billion in organic constant currency growth of 2% and system-wide revenue of $5.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $100 million, with a margin of 2.1%, matching the prior year and aligning with guidance. CEO Jonas Prising noted strengthening trends in key markets like the U.S. and France, though he cautioned against declaring a broad-based recovery. Engagement levels remained steady despite cautious client hiring. Manpower revenue grew 5% organically, Experis declined 6% (improving from 7% in Q3), and Talent Solutions declined 4% (improving from 8%). Gross profit margin was 16.3%, slightly below guidance due to lower permanent recruitment in Europe, where perm demand remains historically low. Cost discipline was emphasized, with a 4% constant currency reduction in SG&A and Northern Europe achieving positive operating profit for the first time in five quarters. Regional performance varied: Italy showed 7% days-adjusted growth and strong margins; France improved from -4% to -2% monthly decline; Germany declined 22% days-adjusted but with expected improvement in Q1 2026; the U.S. saw a 1% revenue decline but stronger-than-expected performance in MSP and Manpower; APME grew 6% with Japan up 7%. AI and digitization initiatives, including PowerSuite (used in 90% of operations) and an AI Recruiter Toolkit, drove a 7% increase in placement rates. Executives highlighted client interest in flexible work models and AI-driven workforce transformation. The company reaffirmed a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 4.5% to 5%, with expected year-over-year improvement over the next four years. For Q1 2026, ManpowerGroup guided EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 and constant currency revenue between a 1% decline and 3% growth (midpoint: 1% growth). The full-year global tax rate is estimated at 45%, excluding benefits from the unextended U.S. Workers' Opportunity Tax Credit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:06 AM\nSource:[Defense World](https://www.defenseworld.net/2026/01/31/manpowergroup-q4-earnings-call-highlights.html)\n\n**Meta Platforms Could Do the Unthinkable to Google This Year**\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported a 24% revenue increase in Q4 2025 to $59.9 billion, with net income rising 9% to $22.8 billion ($8.88 per share), despite margin pressure from increased spending. The company issued first-quarter 2026 guidance of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion in revenue, representing a 30% year-over-year increase, including a 4% foreign currency tailwind\u2014its fastest quarterly growth in five years. Meta's advertising revenue, which accounted for $196.2 billion of its $201 billion total 2025 revenue, grew 22% in 2025. CFO Susan Li attributed this growth to AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and generative AI tools for advertisers. Based on Q1 guidance, Meta\u2019s ad revenue could reach $251.1 billion in 2026. Alphabet\u2019s advertising revenue through Q3 2025 was $161.4 billion, and if it grows 12% in Q4, it would total $222 billion for 2025. Projected 12% growth in 2026 would yield $248.7 billion, slightly below Meta\u2019s forecast. However, Alphabet\u2019s total ad revenue\u2014including YouTube and Google Network\u2014exceeds $300 billion, giving it a current advantage. Despite this, Meta has outgrown Alphabet in revenue growth over nearly every quarter of the last decade, except during the post-pandemic period. The article argues that Meta\u2019s social media-based advertising model, enhanced by AI, gives it a strategic edge in the AI era, potentially enabling it to surpass Alphabet\u2019s entire advertising business within a few years. While Alphabet has responded to AI competition with Google Gemini and AI overviews in search, Meta\u2019s proactive use of AI in ad targeting and creation is seen as a growth driver. The article concludes that Meta is well-positioned to become the world\u2019s largest advertising business and a market-beater in 2026 and beyond.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:50 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms-could-do-unthinkable-google-year)\n\n**Enea AB (FRA:EED5) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Record Prof**\nEnea AB (FRA:EED5) reported its highest Q4 profitability in four years, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%, reflecting strong financial management. The company saw significant growth in core products, with Deep Packet Inspection rising nearly 20% and Traffic Management increasing over 30%. Enea successfully contained a cyber incident in Q4 without financial loss or customer disruption, underscoring its cybersecurity resilience. The company also signed 10 new customers across EMEA, North America, and Asia Pacific, signaling market expansion. A new strategic focus on market acceleration, vertical expansion, and product evolution was announced to drive future growth. However, net sales declined by 5% in Q4 2025 due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, primarily from a 20% appreciation of the Swedish krona against the US dollar over the past year. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital decreased, attributed to volatile financial net positions\u2014SEK41 million positive in Q4 2024 versus SEK6 million negative in Q4 2025\u2014linked to currency fluctuations. Despite large announced contracts, revenue growth was not realized in Q4, indicating challenges in order-to-revenue conversion. The company cited the need to restructure its sales organization into a more customer-centric model as the primary growth constraint, though market dynamics remain positive. CEO Teemu Salmi noted increasing customer interest in Swedish firms due to data sovereignty concerns amid geopolitical tensions, positioning Enea as a trusted alternative to US and Israeli competitors. CFO Ulf Stigberg explained that rising net working capital is due to business mix, particularly longer payment cycles in certain development areas, with ongoing efforts to mitigate this trend.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:01 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8568184/enea-ab-fraeed5-q4-2025-earnings-call-highlights-record-profitability-amid-currency-challenges)\n\n**Increased Investor Optimism Lifted Alphabet (GOOGL) in Q4**\nHotchkis & Wiley Global Value Fund reported a 3.80% return in the fourth quarter of 2025, outperforming the MSCI World Value Index's 3.34%. The Fund's year-to-date return was 23.77%, compared to 20.79% for the Index, driven by positive stock selection. The Fund remained overweight in non-US equities, where international stocks outperformed US stocks in 2025, though the valuation gap remained stable. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was highlighted as a leading contributor in the Fund's performance. The company\u2019s stock returned 7.33% in one month and gained 65.79% over the past 52 weeks, closing at $338.25 per share on January 29, 2026, with a market capitalization of $4.097 trillion. Strong third-quarter 2025 results, which beat expectations across all segments, boosted investor confidence, particularly in Alphabet\u2019s ability to monetize AI opportunities. Google\u2019s new AI products reportedly captured significant market share from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in consumer chatbot usage. Alphabet achieved its first-ever $100 billion in quarterly revenue in Q3 2025. The company ranked fourth among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, with 243 hedge fund portfolios holding it at the end of Q3 2025\u2014up from 219 in Q2.

The decline was primarily driven by weak demand in China, a strong Swiss franc causing a 308 million franc negative currency impact, and a significant drop in operating profit (EBIT) from 304 million to 135 million francs, and net profit from 250 million to 25 million francs. Despite this, the company reported positive momentum in the second half of 2025, with a 4.7% revenue increase in local currencies, accelerating to 7.2% in the fourth quarter across all price segments. Growth was particularly strong in North America, where revenue rose nearly 20% in constant currency, and also in India, the Middle East, and Poland. China, Hong Kong, and Macau saw recovery in the second half of 2025, returning to growth in local currency. Swatch Group maintained its dividend at 4.50 Swiss francs per share despite the profit decline, signaling confidence in future recovery. The company avoided layoffs and short-time work to remain prepared for growth, using idle staff for R&D. The stock rose nearly 10% to over 175 Swiss francs on January 30, 2026, rebounding from a low of 130 francs in summer 2025.

The company's performance was driven by strong margins: the gross margin improved to 50.8% in the fourth quarter (up 100 basis points) and reached 51.6% for the full year, up 80 basis points year-on-year, despite headwinds such as higher tariffs and unfavorable exchange rates. Operating profit more than doubled to \u20ac1.64 billion in Q4 and reached \u20ac2.056 billion for the full year, with an operating margin of 8.3%, up 2.6 percentage points. Growth was double-digit across all markets and channels, supported by a sales mix increasingly focused on full-price selling. In response to the strong results, Adidas's board announced a share buyback program of up to \u20ac1 billion starting in February 2026, funded by internal cash flow and aimed at canceling the repurchased shares, signaling confidence to the market. Analysts at Barclays described the Q4 results as a 'slight beat' overall, with revenues and margins exceeding Bloomberg consensus estimates, particularly highlighting the gross margin of 50.8%, about 90 basis points above expectations, attributed to healthy full-price sales that offset currency and tariff impacts. The EBIT margin of 2.8% in Q4 also surpassed the expected 2.4%, and Barclays viewed the buyback as a positive signal of confidence, especially given the stock's performance over the past 12 months.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:23 AM\nSource:[Milano Finanza](https://www.milanofinanza.it/fashion/adidas-corre-nel-2025-ricavi-record-a-24-8-miliardi-13-e-buyback-da-1-miliardo-202601301157111361)\n\n**Electrolux Q4 2025 Results: Cost Reductions Drive Margin Expansion Despite Regional Challenges**\nElectrolux AB (OTC:0MDT) saw its stock rise 22.64% after reporting fourth-quarter 2025 results on January 30, 2026, driven by significant margin expansion and successful cost-reduction initiatives, despite regional challenges. The company reported a net revenue of 35.112 million SEK for Q4 2025, down from 37.968 million SEK in Q4 2024 due to a negative currency impact of -8.9%, though organic growth remained positive at 2.0% (down from 11.5% in the prior year). The operating result improved sharply to 1.517 million SEK (4.3% margin) from 1.052 million SEK (2.8% margin) in Q4 2024. Cash flow from operations after investments reached 5.179 million SEK, nearly double the 2.660 million SEK in Q4 2024, primarily due to working capital optimization, especially inventory management. Regionally, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia (EMEA) delivered 3.6% organic sales growth and a 6.3% operating margin (up from 3.7% in Q4 2024), while Latin America posted 4.1% organic growth and a strong 11.5% margin (up from 8.0%). In contrast, North America faced a 1.7% organic sales decline and an operating loss of 312 million SEK (vs. a 45 million SEK profit in Q4 2024), attributed to higher U.S. tariffs and adverse exchange rates. Electrolux achieved a 4 billion SEK cost reduction in 2025, exceeding its 3.5\u20134.0 billion SEK target, through product cost optimization, sourcing from lower-cost countries, and global scale advantages. For the full year 2025, organic revenue was 131.282 million SEK (3.9% growth), and operating profit rose to 3.7 billion SEK (2.8% margin) from 1.1 billion SEK (0.8% margin) in 2024. Sustainability goals were advanced, with 45% of the 85% Scope 1 & 2 emissions target and 33% of the 42% Scope 3 target achieved. For 2026, Electrolux forecasts neutral-to-negative market conditions in North America, neutral in Europe and Brazil, with expected positive contributions from volume, price, and product mix. The company aims 3.5\u20134.0 billion SEK in cost efficiency measures and projects 4 billion SEK in investments, focusing on customer experience and marketing. The CFO, Therese Friberg, highlighted improved liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.0x (down from 3.4x in 2024), supporting investment-grade credit standing.

The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.1%, driven by improving demand in core markets, particularly in the US and France, where resilience was noted despite political and budget uncertainty. The Manpower brand grew for three consecutive quarters and six quarters in the US, while the diversified multi-brand portfolio continued to perform well. Cost discipline remained a priority, with a 4% constant currency reduction in SG&A expenses, contributing to improved profitability. However, challenges persist: permanent recruitment activity was weaker than expected in Europe, leading to a 30 basis point decline in gross profit margin. Experis declined by 6%, and Talent Solutions by 4%. The company reported a negative earnings per share of $0.29 for the full year, with a 38% constant currency decrease in adjusted EPS. Free cash flow turned negative at $161 million, compared to a $258 million inflow in the prior year. In the Q&A, CEO Jonas Prising emphasized the company\u2019s AI integration through PowerSuite and Sophie AI, aiming to become an AI-enabled global people business, with expected EBITDA margin improvements over the next four years even in a moderate recovery. CFO Jack McGinnis highlighted ongoing progress in France, stability in the US, and strong momentum in Italy. The company expects continued improvement in cash flow and balance sheet management in 2026. Demand for flexible workers remains strong, with both clients and candidates valuing adaptability. AI is seen as more disruptive to white-collar roles, while blue-collar roles are more resilient.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:06 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8564324/manpowergroup-inc-man-q4-2025-earnings-call-highlights-navigating-growth-and-challenges-in-a-dynamic-market)\n\n**Weaker Dollar Hits Safilo's 2025 Revenue, but Margins Grew**\nSafilo Group reported a 1% decline in preliminary 2025 sales to 983.4 million euros, primarily due to the weakening U.S. dollar against the euro. At constant exchange rates, sales rose 1.8%. In the fourth quarter, sales fell 4.6% to 225 million euros, but increased 0.4% at constant exchange. The company attributed growth to strong performance in Smith\u2019s sports products and the continued expansion of its contemporary and lifestyle portfolios, with key brands including Carrera, David Beckham, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, Boss, Kate Spade, and Carolina Herrera playing a significant role in key markets and distribution channels. North America saw a 7% sales drop in Q4, but a 1.5% increase at constant exchange, driven by wholesale growth and a rebound in Smith\u2019s retail sales, while Blenders remained weak in direct-to-consumer. For 2025, North America was down 2.6% but up 1.8% at constant exchange. Europe edged down 0.1% in Q4 due to lower volumes, the deconsolidation of Lenti (sold in June 2025), and delivery phasing, but revenue grew 2.3% in 2025, with mid-single-digit organic growth in prescription frames. Asia-Pacific sales dropped 17.4% in Q4, or 11.5% at constant exchange, while the rest of the world rose 3.9% at constant exchange. In 2025, Asia-Pacific was up 1.3% and the rest of the world down 10%. Safilo reported improved margins: fourth-quarter gross margin reached 61.9% (up 240 basis points YoY), full-year gross margin was 60.9% (up 120 bps). EBITDA margin in Q4 was 6.7% (up 120 bps), and full-year 2025 EBITDA margin reached 10.8% (up 280 bps), driven by price adjustments in North America, shifting sourcing outside China, and favorable price/mix dynamics. Free cash flow for 2025 was 55 million euros, including 11.9 million euros from the Lenti disposal, and net debt stood at 46 million euros after a 18 million euro share buyback. In December 2025, Safilo acquired 25% of Inspecs Group for approximately 21.7 million pounds. The company stated it remains focused on organic growth and selective acquisitions in 2026 amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, aiming to strengthen profitability and cash generation to create sustainable long-term value.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:17 PM\nSource:[WWD](https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/weaker-dollar-impacts-safilo-2025-revenue-margins-grow-1238530963/)\n\n**ALTEN Reports 2025 Annual Revenue: Decline Amid Sectoral Shifts and Signs of Stabilization**\nALTEN reported its 2025 annual revenue results, showing a year-end decline of -1.1% overall, with +4.3% growth in France and -3.7% outside France. At constant perimeter and exchange rates, the decline was -4.5% (-3.6% in France, -4.9% outside France). In the fourth quarter, revenue reached \u20ac1,023 million, down -0.35% compared to Q4 2024. Organic decline at constant data was -2.2% (-2.4% in France, -2.2% outside France). The decline was primarily driven by a 16% drop in the Automotive sector, with smaller declines in Telecoms, Other Industries, Electronics, and Public Sector. In contrast, Defense/Safety, Naval, and Energy sectors showed significant growth. The fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations, with Aerospace and Banking/Finance sectors returning to growth. Southern Europe continued strong growth, while Eastern Europe and APAC remained stable. Other regions, except the UK, Benelux, and Nordics, showed gradual improvement. The improved Q4 performance is expected to boost the operating margin to exceed 8.1% of revenue in 2025, as previously estimated on October 23, 2025. The company also completed several acquisitions: a life sciences firm in the US and India (\u20ac7.5M, 120 consultants), an embedded software firm in India (\u20ac5.2M, 270 consultants), a digital transformation firm in Spain and Latin America (\u20ac19M, 300 consultants), and a life sciences firm in France and Belgium (\u20ac20.5M, 190 consultants). Activity is gradually stabilizing across sectors, with Aerospace and Banking/Finance already showing growth in Q4 2025. The first half of 2026 will confirm this trend.

Revenue reached $90.2 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase (14% in constant currency), driven by double-digit growth in Google Search, YouTube advertising, subscriptions, and Google Cloud\u2014all fueled by AI innovations. Google Cloud revenue surged 28% to $12.3 billion, with significant growth in AI infrastructure, platform services, and generative AI solutions, indicating rising corporate adoption of AI. Operating profit rose 20% to $30.6 billion, with an operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that AI investments are already enhancing efficiency and profitability. Net profit increased 46% to $34.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share grew 49% to $2.81. The company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, highlighted the launch of Gemini 2.5, described as Alphabet\u2019s most advanced AI model to date, underpinning future innovation. Consumer adoption is also rising, with Alphabet surpassing 270 million paid subscriptions across YouTube and Google One, driven by AI-powered features. On April 23, 2025, the board approved a $70 billion share repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share, signaling confidence in sustained cash flow and long-term value creation in the AI era. These results reinforce Alphabet\u2019s strategic leadership in both AI infrastructure and consumer-facing applications, with a diversified revenue model that includes cloud, advertising, subscriptions, and strategic investments. The company\u2019s ability to scale AI across multiple business lines while expanding margins underscores its competitive advantage. The broader AI landscape among hyperscalers\u2014Google, Microsoft, and Amazon\u2014shows distinct strategies: Google\u2019s full-stack integration, Microsoft\u2019s enterprise focus via OpenAI and Azure, and Amazon\u2019s AWS dominance\u2014creating a dynamic, overlapping competition. Despite risks like regulatory challenges, slower corporate adoption, and technological obsolescence, Alphabet\u2019s performance indicates these risks are currently manageable. The company\u2019s robust financials, strong cash generation, and sustained double-digit growth across key segments confirm that AI is no longer experimental but a core engine of revenue, efficiency, and shareholder value. The results suggest that AI-driven growth is both scalable and profitable, with hyperscalers consolidating power through massive infrastructure investments, data advantages, and network effects. Investors are increasingly confident, as demonstrated by capital allocation decisions and the company\u2019s continued commitment to AI investment despite short-term margin pressure.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:25 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/analysis/o-que-o-balanco-da-alphabet-revela-sobre-a-demanda-por-ia-200473745)\n\n**Paris Pre-Market: CAC 40 on the Brink of Historic High Amid Positive Global Sentiment and Strong Corporate Results**\nThe Paris stock market is expected to open higher on October 21, 2025, with the CAC 40 poised to surpass its previous historical high of 8,259.19 points set on May 10, 2024, and its annual peak of 8,257.88 points on March 3, 2024.
