## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST RENEWAL:**

1. **Multiple Independent Sources Confirm No US Response** (Today, Feb 1)
   - Asharq Al-Awsat: "no formal action has followed"
   - South China Morning Post: Russia received "no substantive reaction"
   - AFP: "Washington never formally responded"
   - Firstpost (Jan 20): Lavrov stated "no focused talks"
   - **Weight**: This is the most critical evidence - 4+ months after Putin's proposal, with 4 days remaining, no formal US acceptance exists

2. **Legal/Structural Impossibility of Formal Extension**
   - VCDNP (Jan 14): "New START cannot be extended - it only permitted one five-year extension, which was already used in 2021"
   - State Dept fact sheet confirms extension through Feb 4, 2026
   - Any arrangement must be NEW treaty (requires Senate ratification) or informal political commitment
   - **Weight**: Strong - establishes that even if agreement reached, it cannot be a formal "renewal" of New START

3. **Trump's Explicit Statements**
   - "If it expires, it expires" (multiple sources, Jan 2026)
   - "We'll make a better deal" (AGI, Feb 1)
   - White House: Trump will decide "on his own timeline" (Asharq Al-Awsat, Feb 1)
   - **Weight**: Strong - indicates lack of urgency and willingness to let treaty lapse

4. **Expert Consensus on Absence of Negotiations**
   - Shizuka Kuramitsu (ACA): "absence of formal negotiations" (Jan 27)
   - Daryl Kimball (ACA): Trump lacks "coherent strategy" (Feb 1)
   - Jon Wolfsthal (FAS): criticized "failing to act on low-hanging fruit" (Feb 1)
   - **Weight**: Strong - multiple identifiable experts from authoritative institutions confirm no progress

5. **Time Constraint**
   - Only 4 days remaining (Feb 1 to Feb 5)
   - Historical pattern: 2021 extension finalized within 48 hours of Biden taking office
   - Current pattern: 4+ months since Putin proposal with no movement
   - **Weight**: Strong - time window virtually closed

**MODERATE EVIDENCE AGAINST:**

1. **Verification Regime Collapsed**
   - No inspections since 2020 (6 years)
   - Russia suspended participation Feb 2023
   - Dr. Sokov: verification restoration "very low" likelihood
   - **Weight**: Moderate - makes any informal arrangement less credible/verifiable

2. **Geopolitical Context**
   - Ukraine war ongoing (multiple sources)
   - No unified European perspective (Berghofer, Jan 27)
   - Russia developing weapons outside treaty scope (Burevestnik, Poseidon)
   - **Weight**: Moderate - creates obstacles but doesn't directly prevent informal arrangement

**WEAK EVIDENCE FOR RENEWAL:**

1. **Putin's Proposal Exists**
   - Sept 22, 2025 proposal for one-year informal adherence
   - Would extend to Feb 5, 2027 (meets resolution criteria timeframe)
   - **Weight**: Weak - proposal exists but requires US acceptance, which hasn't materialized

2. **Trump's Initial Positive Rhetoric**
   - Called Putin's idea "good" (Sept 2025)
   - Said "not an agreement you want expiring"
   - **Weight**: Weak - rhetoric not followed by action in 4+ months

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 4 days (Feb 1, 2026 to Feb 5, 2026)

This is an extremely compressed timeframe. Key considerations:

**If timeframe was halved (2 days)**:
- Probability would drop to ~1% - virtually impossible for formal diplomatic announcement in 48 hours with no groundwork laid

**If timeframe was doubled (8 days)**:
- Probability might increase to ~8-10% - slightly more time for surprise announcement, but fundamental barriers remain

**Critical Temporal Factor**: The 4+ month gap between Putin's proposal (Sept 22, 2025) and today (Feb 1, 2026) with zero formal US response is the most damning evidence. In arms control, when parties want deals, they move quickly:
- 2021 New START extension: Announced within 48 hours of Biden inauguration
- Current situation: 130+ days of silence

The temporal pattern strongly suggests lack of political will, not just bureaucratic delay.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Shift Analysis:**

My outside view base rate of 4% was calibrated on the assumption that some possibility existed for a last-minute informal arrangement. However, the current information (especially from TODAY, Feb 1, 2026) provides much stronger evidence than was available in the outside view analysis.

**Factors Rendering Reference Class Non-Analogous:**

1. **Unprecedented Information Clarity**: We now have statements from TODAY confirming:
   - No formal US response after 4+ months
   - Trump explicitly willing to let treaty expire
   - Russia confirms no substantive reaction received
   - Multiple experts confirm absence of negotiations

2. **Definitional Clarity**: The resolution criteria ask if "New START [will] be renewed" with "credible reports such as by the Arms Control Association." 
   - Legal analysis confirms New START cannot be formally renewed (extension already used)
   - Any arrangement would be informal political commitment, not treaty renewal
   - Question is whether ACA would report informal freeze as "extension" vs "renewal"
   - ACA's own expert (Kuramitsu) notes "absence of formal negotiations" as of Jan 27

3. **Time Window Effectively Closed**: With only 4 days remaining and no announcement today (Feb 1), the probability of sudden reversal is negligible. Historical precedent shows urgent arms control deals happen in 48 hours when political will exists - 4+ months of inaction demonstrates absence of will.

**Most Compelling Shift Factors:**

1. **Today's News Confirms No Agreement**: Multiple independent sources from Feb 1, 2026 confirm no formal US response exists
2. **Trump's Explicit Position**: "If it expires, it expires" directly contradicts renewal scenario
3. **Expert Consensus**: ACA (the specific source in resolution criteria) confirms no negotiations
4. **Legal Impossibility**: Cannot formally "renew" New START; only informal arrangement possible
5. **Time Constraint**: 4 days insufficient for diplomatic breakthrough without groundwork

These factors justify shifting significantly BELOW the 4% base rate because:
- Base rate assumed some residual probability of surprise announcement
- Current evidence eliminates surprise scenario (Trump explicitly willing to let expire)
- Legal analysis suggests even if announced, might not qualify as "renewal"

## Probability Calibration

**Key Conditional Probabilities:**

P(US announces acceptance of informal arrangement in next 4 days | no progress in 4+ months AND Trump says "if it expires, it expires") = ~1-2%

P(ACA reports informal arrangement as "extension" qualifying under resolution criteria | informal arrangement announced) = ~50-70%
- Uncertainty: Does informal freeze count as "renewal"?
- ACA might report it as "political extension" or "informal adherence" rather than "renewal"

P(Arrangement actually extends to Feb 2027 | announced) = ~85-90%

**Combined Probability**: 1-2% × 50-70% × 85-90% = 0.4-1.3%

**Calibration Check:**

At 1%, I'm saying: "1 out of 100 times in this exact scenario (4 days before expiration, no formal response after 4+ months, president willing to let expire, no negotiations), New START gets renewed."

This feels appropriately calibrated given:
- The overwhelming evidence against
- The compressed timeframe
- The absence of any positive signals today
- Trump's explicit willingness to let expire

**Could I be overconfident?** 

Possible scenarios I might be missing:
1. Secret negotiations unreported (very unlikely - leaks would occur)
2. Last-minute Trump reversal (contradicts his explicit statements today)
3. Broad interpretation of "renewal" (possible but ACA unlikely to report informal freeze as renewal)

These scenarios collectively might add 0.5-1% probability, but not more.

**Final Calibration**: 1%

This represents near-certainty the treaty will expire without renewal, while acknowledging the small possibility of:
- Surprise announcement in next 96 hours (very unlikely)
- Broad interpretation where informal freeze counts as "renewal" (questionable)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will New START be renewed/extended to at least Feb 5, 2027 before Feb 5, 2026 (4 days), per credible reports like ACA?

2. **Base rate**: 4% outside view based on historical informal arrangements during treaty expirations. Current circumstances are vastly different - we have explicit confirmation of no US response after 4+ months and Trump willing to let expire.

3. **Consistency**: "1 out of 100 times in scenarios with 4 days remaining, no formal response after 4+ months, and president explicitly willing to let treaty expire, the treaty gets renewed." Yes, this aligns with my analysis.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Multiple sources TODAY confirm no formal US response after 4+ months (VERIFIED - Asharq Al-Awsat, SCMP, AFP, Firstpost)
   - Trump stated "if it expires, it expires" on Feb 1, 2026 (VERIFIED - multiple sources)
   - ACA expert confirms "absence of formal negotiations" Jan 27 (VERIFIED - UN Disarmament event)
   - Legal analysis: New START cannot be formally extended, only informal arrangement possible (VERIFIED - VCDNP, State Dept)
   - Only 4 days remaining with no announcement today (VERIFIED - current date)

5. **Blind-spot**: Secret backchannel negotiations could produce surprise announcement in next 48-72 hours. However, this would contradict Trump's public statements TODAY and would likely have leaked. If this occurred, my forecast would be wrong, but the evidence strongly suggests it won't.

6. **Status quo**: Status quo is treaty expiration without renewal. All evidence points toward status quo outcome. No volatility or momentum toward change detected.

Probability: 1%
