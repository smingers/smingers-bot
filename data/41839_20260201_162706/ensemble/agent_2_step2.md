Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**

1. **VCDNP Article (Jan 14, 2026)** - Dr. Nikolai Sokov, former Soviet/Russian negotiator, now VCDNP Senior Fellow. **Facts:** New START expires Feb 5, 2026; cannot be extended (only one extension permitted, used in 2021); Putin proposed one-year informal adherence to limits in Sept 2025; Trump called it "good" but no official U.S. response issued; Trump later said "if it expires, it expires." **Opinion:** Sokov's view that proposal is "largely symbolic" and verification restoration "very low" likelihood. High credibility expert opinion.

2. **Arms Control Association (multiple references)** - Daryl Kimball (Executive Director) quoted in UN side event (Jan 27, 2026). **Facts:** No formal U.S. response to Putin's proposal; no formal negotiations underway. **Opinion:** Kimball warns both sides could double arsenals without framework. Highly reliable NGO with transparent methodology.

3. **State Department Fact Sheet** - Official U.S. government source. **Facts:** Treaty expires Feb 4, 2026; verification mechanisms include 18 annual inspections; Russia suspended participation Feb 2023. No opinion content, purely factual. Authoritative but dated (doesn't reflect Jan 2026 status).

4. **Multiple News Sources (Jan-Feb 2026):**
   - **Asharq Al-Awsat (Feb 1, 2026):** White House official states Trump wants China involved, will clarify "on his own timeline." Jon Wolfsthal (Federation of American Scientists) criticizes lack of coherent strategy.
   - **South China Morning Post (Feb 1, 2026):** Dmitry Medvedev says Russia received no "substantive reaction" from Trump administration.
   - **AFP (Feb 1, 2026):** French FM Jean-Noël Barrot warns of "increasing risk of nuclear proliferation."
   - **Firstpost (Jan 20, 2026):** Lavrov confirms no focused talks, dedicated communication channels inactive.

**Quality Assessment:** Primary sources are excellent (official documents, expert testimony, major news agencies). All consistently report: (1) No active negotiations, (2) No formal U.S. response to Putin's Sept 2025 proposal, (3) Only 4 days remaining as of Feb 1, 2026.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against Renewal:**

1. **Structural/Institutional Barriers:** Any legally binding treaty requires Senate ratification (2/3 majority) - impossible in 4 days. Multiple sources confirm this procedural reality. Even executive agreements require negotiation time unavailable.

2. **Multiple Independent Sources Confirming Negotiation Absence:** 
   - Lavrov (Russian FM): "dedicated communication channels remain inactive" (Jan 20)
   - Medvedev: "no substantive reaction" from U.S. (Feb 1)
   - Kimball (Arms Control Assoc.): "absence of formal negotiations" (Jan 27)
   - White House official: Trump will decide "on his own timeline" (Feb 1)
   
   This constitutes overwhelming confirmation from both sides that talks are not happening.

3. **Historical Pattern with Strong Predictive Power:** Every suspended arms control treaty (ABM 2002, CFE 2007-15, INF 2019) collapsed without renewal. Zero precedent for 4-day turnaround.

**Moderate Evidence Against:**

1. **Trump's Stated Position:** "If it expires, it expires" + desire for "better agreement" including China. China has explicitly rejected trilateral talks. This creates logical impossibility for near-term comprehensive deal.

2. **Expert Consensus:** Sokov, Wolfsthal, Kimball, Dolzikova all assess renewal as effectively impossible. No contrary expert opinion identified.

**Weak Evidence For (Tail Risk):**

1. **Putin's Sept 2025 Proposal:** One-year informal adherence to limits. However:
   - Not a legally binding treaty
   - Requires mutual announcement
   - No U.S. response in 4+ months suggests disinterest
   - Resolution criteria require "credible reports of New START being extended" or "replaced by another nuclear arms control agreement" - unclear if informal political pledge qualifies

2. **Trump-Putin Communication Exists:** Recent Ukraine ceasefire discussions show direct communication channel. However, no evidence this extends to nuclear issues.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current Timeframe:** 4 days (Feb 1 to Feb 5, 2026)

**If Halved (2 days):** Probability would drop to <0.5% - literally no time for even political announcement.

**If Doubled (8 days):** Probability might rise to 3-5% - allows minimal window for surprise political deal, though still no Senate ratification possible. The constraint isn't primarily time but political will and negotiation status.

**Critical Factor:** The question asks about events "before February 5, 2026" - meaning by Feb 4, 2026 at latest. This is now effectively 3 days away.

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

**Outside View Base Rate:** 1% (based on reference class of suspended treaties never being rescued)

**Inside View Adjustments:**

**Factors Strongly Pushing Toward 0%:**
1. **Zero Negotiation Activity:** Unlike typical diplomatic scenarios where "no comment" might hide secret talks, we have explicit statements from both Russian FM (Lavrov) and U.S. sources confirming no active discussions.

2. **Procedural Impossibility:** Senate ratification requires weeks minimum (committee hearings, floor debate, vote). Executive agreements still need negotiation, which hasn't occurred.

3. **Political Will Absent:** Trump's "if it expires, it expires" and insistence on China's inclusion (which China rejects) indicates no urgency to preserve New START specifically.

4. **Russian Suspension Since 2023:** Treaty has been non-functional for verification for 3 years. Both sides already operating outside practical constraints.

**Factors Creating Minimal Tail Risk (keeping above 0%):**

1. **Resolution Criteria Ambiguity:** The question accepts "credible reports" of extension OR "credible reports of New START being replaced by another nuclear arms control agreement that... officials... describe as a successor." 

   Theoretically, if Putin and Trump jointly announced tomorrow: "We agree to maintain New START limits through Feb 5, 2027 as basis for negotiating a successor treaty," and Arms Control Association reported this as "informal extension," it might qualify.

2. **Unpredictability of Trump Diplomacy:** Trump has shown willingness for sudden diplomatic moves (e.g., North Korea summits). However, no preparation signals exist here.

**Calibrated Assessment:**

The outside view of 1% was based on historical treaty collapse patterns. Current evidence is even more negative than the reference class average because:
- We're at T-4 days (vs. typical months of warning)
- Both sides explicitly confirm no talks (vs. ambiguous silence)
- Structural barriers are absolute (Senate ratification timeline)

However, the resolution criteria's acceptance of "credible reports" rather than formal legal instruments creates a narrow pathway: a last-minute political announcement framed by media as an "extension" or "successor agreement."

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from 1% outside view, adjusting for:
- **-0.3%:** Explicit confirmation of no active talks (stronger than typical reference class)
- **-0.2%:** Trump's stated disinterest in simple extension
- **+0.3%:** Resolution criteria's flexibility (credible reports vs. formal treaty)
- **+0.2%:** Non-zero chance of surprise political announcement in next 96 hours

**Final Calibrated Probability: 1%**

This reflects extreme skepticism while acknowledging the mathematical possibility of an unprecedented last-minute political declaration that media sources would characterize as meeting the resolution criteria.

## Probability Calibration

At 1%, I'm stating that in 100 similar scenarios with:
- 4 days until treaty expiration
- No active negotiations confirmed by both parties
- Procedural impossibility of formal ratification
- But flexible resolution criteria accepting "credible reports"

...one time, a surprise political announcement occurs that credible sources frame as an extension/successor lasting to Feb 2027.

This seems appropriately calibrated. At 0.1%, I'd be dismissing the possibility of any diplomatic surprise entirely. At 5%, I'd be implying meaningful probability of negotiations I have no evidence for. At 1%, I'm acknowledging the tail risk that:
1. Trump/Putin make sudden joint statement (Feb 2-4)
2. Arms Control Association reports it as "extension" or "successor agreement"
3. Statement explicitly references Feb 5, 2027 timeframe

The 99:1 odds against feel appropriate given the overwhelming evidence of inaction and structural barriers.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will New START be extended to Feb 5, 2027 or replaced by successor agreement before Feb 5, 2026 (4 days), per credible reports?

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view of 1% (suspended treaties never rescued) maintained after inside view analysis found even stronger negative evidence.

3. **Consistency check:** "1 out of 100 times, credible sources report New START extended or replaced by successor lasting to Feb 2027 before Feb 5, 2026." Yes, this reflects extreme improbability while acknowledging non-zero tail risk of surprise announcement.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Lavrov/Medvedev confirm no substantive U.S. response or active talks (Jan 20-Feb 1)
   - Senate ratification procedurally impossible in 4 days
   - Trump stated "if it expires, it expires" with no policy reversal
   - Zero historical precedent for 4-day treaty rescue
   - Putin's Sept 2025 proposal received no formal U.S. engagement in 4+ months

5. **Blind spot:** Secret back-channel negotiations culminating in surprise Feb 2-4 announcement that Arms Control Association immediately frames as "extension" or "successor agreement." This would require unprecedented diplomatic speed and media cooperation, but is the scenario most likely to prove forecast wrong.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is treaty expiration with no replacement. All momentum points toward this outcome. Volatility is extremely low (no changing conditions in past month). Status quo strongly favored.
