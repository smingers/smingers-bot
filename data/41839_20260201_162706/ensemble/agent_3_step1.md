Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **Arms Control Association (ACA), “Russia Suspends New START” (Mar 2023)**  
- **Factual content:** Dates and actions around Russia’s suspension (Feb 21, 2023), inspection/data-exchange disruptions, U.S. compliance finding, expiration date (Feb 5, 2026).  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Quotes from officials and experts about consequences and likelihoods; assessments of “viability” and political meaning.  
- **Source quality:** High for treaty-status facts and institutional timelines; ACA is a specialized, generally careful secondary source. Not primary documentation, but widely cited.

2) **SIPRI statement (Feb 22, 2023)**  
- **Factual content:** Recaps suspension announcement and operational details (inspection pauses; treaty background).  
- **Opinions:** Dan Smith’s characterization (“benefits nobody,” “dangerous uncertainty”).  
- **Source quality:** High credibility think-tank; strong for contextual framing and accurate summarization; not an official government source.

3) **VCDNP (Sokov), “End of New START…” (Jan 14, 2026)**  
- **Factual content:** Key claim that **a formal extension is not available** because the one-time 5-year extension was already used in 2021; current “suspended” verification situation; references to Putin’s one-year post-expiry adherence proposal.  
- **Opinions:** Claims about Senate prospects being “low,” verification-restoration likelihood “very low,” and the proposal being “largely symbolic.” These are expert judgments (Sokov is a recognizable arms-control specialist).  
- **Source quality:** Strong expert analysis; however, it’s still commentary/analysis rather than official documents. The legal point about one-time extension is important and widely consistent with public understanding of New START’s extension clause.

4) **CFR article (Nov 19, 2025) on Putin’s offer**  
- **Factual content:** Reports existence of Putin’s proposal; describes the treaty’s “life support” state and verification history; mentions U.S. officials’ stated preferences (e.g., desire for verification elements).  
- **Opinions:** Policy recommendations (what the U.S. “should” demand) and skepticism framing; these are analyst views.  
- **Source quality:** High-quality policy analysis; still secondary. Useful for gauging mainstream expert priors and feasibility constraints.

5) **Irrelevant articles (CalMatters cap-and-trade; ESPN WNBA CBA)**  
- **Relevance:** None to New START; should be discarded.

6) **Agent report (timeline 2021–2026)**  
- **Factual content:** Broad chronological structure matches well-known developments (2021 extension; inspection pause; 2023 suspension; discussion of a 2025 “one-year” continuation proposal).  
- **Cautions:** The agent report mixes named-source references with some details that are hard to verify from the supplied excerpts (e.g., certain specific press-secretary quotes, some institutional attributions). Treat as a synthesis that may contain minor errors.  
- **Usefulness:** Good as a *map* of claims and issues (especially the “extension already used” obstacle), but I would anchor on the ACA/VCDNP/CFR summaries as more dependable within this packet.

**Bottom line from sources:** The most salient factual constraint for this question is that **a second “renewal/extension” of New START in the same legal form is widely described as not available**, meaning a “Yes” would most plausibly come from either (i) a politically binding arrangement described as “extension” through Feb 2027, or (ii) a replacement/successor agreement lasting at least to Feb 2027. The sources depict poor verification, high distrust, and major linkage disputes—conditions historically hostile to rapid treaty-making.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Because the resolution criterion is about a **credible reported extension/replacement through Feb 2027 announced by Feb 5, 2026**, the reference class should focus on **late-stage high-stakes arms control “saves”** under deadline pressure, not arms control generally.

Plausible reference classes:

1) **U.S.–Russia/Soviet strategic arms control agreements reached or extended near expiry**  
- Pros: Closest domain match (same actors, same weapons class, similar legal/political constraints).  
- Cons: Very small N; each case is historically unique; modern environment (post-2022 Ukraine war) is much worse than most of the Cold War/post-Cold War era.

2) **Major bilateral treaties concluded within ~1–2 months of deadline** (any domain)  
- Pros: Gives a base rate for “big-diplomacy under time pressure.”  
- Cons: Too broad; ignores Senate ratification and verification architecture complexities unique to nuclear arms control.

3) **“Political freezes” / informal restraint deals when treaties lapse** (arms control/risk reduction)  
- Pros: Most relevant to the idea in the sources (Putin’s one-year adherence proposal). These can be done fast and don’t require full ratification/verification.  
- Cons: Still requires reciprocal commitment and credible reporting as a “successor/extension,” and the question’s wording requires it be described as extending/replacing New START to at least Feb 2027.

**Most suitable reference class:** A hybrid of (1) and (3): *U.S.–Russia strategic nuclear restraint arrangements reached at/near deadline, including informal political freezes.* That best matches the plausible “Yes-path” described in the context.

**Outside-view base rate (qualitative):**  
- Formal treaties with verification and ratification are **rare** and typically take **many months to years**, especially amid active conflict and broken verification.  
- Informal political restraint statements are **more common** and can be rapid—but still not common in the highest-tension periods and may fail the “credible reports describe it as extension/replacement” threshold.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-01  
- **Resolution window closes:** 2026-02-05  
- **Time left:** ~**4 days**

Historical pattern under such a short window:
- A fully negotiated successor treaty (especially one requiring U.S. Senate advice/consent) is extremely unlikely to be completed in days. Even if negotiators had been working quietly, you would expect preparatory signaling, draft texts, or at least structured talks—none are evidenced in the provided context.
- A **thin political agreement** (joint statement / reciprocal declaration) *can* happen quickly. Indeed, the 2021 extension happened rapidly after a change in administration. However, 2026 has (per sources) frozen verification, Russia’s “suspension,” and strong linkage demands—raising the friction for even a minimalist deal.

Given the 4-day window, the “Yes” outcome effectively requires that (i) the two governments already have a near-final understanding, and (ii) they choose to announce it immediately.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** New START expires on Feb 5, 2026 with no successor; Russia remains suspended; verification and data exchange are not functioning. Status quo implies **No**.

**What “Yes” would have to look like (per criteria):**
- **Credible reporting** (e.g., ACA) that New START is “extended” (even if politically) to at least Feb 5, 2027; *or*
- A **replacement/successor** agreement said by U.S. and Russian officials (and credible third parties) to be the New START successor lasting through at least Feb 5, 2027.

**Outside-view obstacles (structural, not news-sensitive):**
1) **Legal/constitutional friction:** A real successor treaty normally requires lengthy negotiation and U.S. Senate approval; compressing that into days is nearly unprecedented.  
2) **Verification collapse:** Reconstituting even partial verification is operationally hard and politically contentious; absence of verification may reduce the value of an “extension” and raise domestic opposition.  
3) **Geopolitical hostility:** Active confrontation/war linkage historically reduces the probability of arms control breakthroughs on short horizons.  
4) **Ambiguity of “extension”:** Since a formal extension is described as “impossible” after the 2021 one-time extension, a “Yes” likely depends on whether a political freeze is *described* as an extension/successor by credible sources—this is a narrower path than “some restraint continues.”

**Countervailing base-rate considerations:**
- Deadline pressure sometimes produces last-minute announcements, especially for minimalist, face-saving arrangements. A one-year “continue to observe limits” deal is the *most* plausible quick outcome because it avoids rewriting a full treaty.

**Net outside view:** With only 4 days remaining and given typical timelines for strategic arms-control agreements, the base rate for a qualifying “extension/replacement through Feb 2027” being credibly reported by Feb 5, 2026 is **very low**, but not literally zero because a thin political freeze could be announced quickly.

Outside view calibration:

- I anchor on the general rarity of (i) U.S.–Russia arms control breakthroughs under acute hostility and (ii) agreements announced within days that meet a fairly specific labeling/credibility criterion (“extended/replaced … until at least Feb 5, 2027”).  
- The one plausible “fast” mechanism is a **reciprocal political declaration** to observe New START ceilings for one year post-expiry (effectively to Feb 2027). Even then, it must be framed by credible sources as an extension/successor, not merely parallel unilateral statements.
- With ~4 days left, I set a single-digit probability. Given that “last-minute saves” do happen but are uncommon in this context, I calibrate to **low single digits** rather than ~0%.

Outside View Prediction:
**3%**
