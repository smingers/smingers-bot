Analysis:
### 1) What must happen to resolve “Yes”
This resolves “Yes” only if **before Feb 5, 2026** there are credible reports that either:
- **(1)** New START is **extended** so it lasts **to at least Feb 5, 2027**, or
- **(2)** It is **replaced** by a **successor agreement** lasting to at least Feb 5, 2027 and described by credible sources/officials as New START’s successor.

Today is **Feb 1, 2026**, so there are ~**4 days** left.

### (a) Source analysis (facts vs. opinions; quality; recency)

**VCDNP (Vienna Center for Disarmament), Sokov (Jan 14, 2026)** – High quality, recent expert analysis.  
- **Key factual claim:** “New START cannot be extended” because the one permitted extension was already used in 2021. (This is a structural/legal claim; if correct, it heavily constrains pathways to “Yes.”)  
- **Reports:** Putin (Sep 2025) proposed a **one-year post-expiry adherence** to limits (to Feb 2027), invited US to reciprocate.  
- **Opinion/expert judgment:** such an arrangement would be “largely symbolic,” verification return very unlikely; no negotiations underway.

**U.S. State Department fact sheet (undated page, but current to extension through Feb 4/5, 2026)** – Very high quality for treaty description; not forward-looking.  
- **Facts:** Treaty limits, verification, and that the treaty was extended to Feb 2026.  
- **No evidence** about a renewal/successor.

**Arms Control Association “New START at a glance” (date not given in excerpt; generally high quality)** – High quality, and explicitly referenced in resolution criteria.  
- **Facts:** treaty timeline; Russia’s 2023 “suspension.”  
- **No evidence** of extension/replacement being concluded.

**Japan Times (Jan 9, 2026)** – Reputable media; secondary reporting; somewhat truncated.  
- **Fact reported:** no US–Russia talks on a successor; both focused on Ukraine.  
- **No indication** of imminent agreement.

**Modern Diplomacy (Jan 8, 2026)** – Medium quality; cites Reuters; could contain editorializing.  
- **Facts:** reiterates expiration, Putin proposal; verification issues.  
- **Opinion:** complexity of multilateral deal; risk reduction preferred.

**UNODA side-event page (Jan 27, 2026)** – High quality for documenting diplomatic event and attributed statements.  
- **Facts:** reiterates Putin proposal; notes **no formal US response**; absence of formal negotiations.  
- **Expert opinions (Kimball/Podvig/etc.)** emphasize desirability of maintaining limits but stress lack of negotiations.

**AskNews / wire & media round-up (late Jan–Feb 1, 2026: AFP, SCMP, AGI, etc.)** – Mixed outlets but multiple independent reports converge.  
- **Common factual thread across several:** Treaty expires Feb 5; Putin offered a one-year arrangement; **Trump has not formally responded**; Russia says no substantive reaction; no successor in place; expectation is entry into “unregulated” era.  
- **Notable attributed statements:**  
  - Trump quote reported: “**If it expires, it expires**.” (AGI/AFP summaries)  
  - Russian officials/allies: no “substantive reaction” (Medvedev claim in SCMP summary); Lavrov: no focused talks (Firstpost summary).  
- **These are highly time-relevant** and point away from last-minute resolution.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (big downward pressure on “Yes”)**
1) **Structural/legal constraint:** credible expert analysis (VCDNP/Sokov) that **New START cannot be extended again** under its own terms (one-time extension already used).  
   - Mechanism: makes criterion (1) hard-to-impossible in a legal sense; pushes all “Yes” probability into a narrow channel: an announced political “extension” of limits being treated as an “extension” by credible reporters, or a rapid successor arrangement.
2) **Multiple independent recent reports (AFP/SCMP/AGI/Asharq, etc.)** that **no formal action/response** has occurred and expectation is expiration.  
   - Mechanism: with only days left, absence of visible movement strongly predicts no qualifying announcement by deadline.

**Moderate evidence (additional downward pressure)**
3) **No successor negotiations underway** (Japan Times; UNODA speakers; VCDNP).  
   - Mechanism: a successor agreement that lasts to Feb 2027 would normally require preparatory talks; none are reported.
4) **Political stance/priority mismatch:** Trump’s reported ambivalence + desire to include China; Russia’s conditionality and “suspension” context.  
   - Mechanism: even if a “freeze” is easy, it still requires explicit reciprocal commitments; current signals don’t show that.

**Weak evidence (small effects; could cut either way)**
5) **Putin’s one-year post-expiry adherence proposal** and Trump saying it “sounds like a good idea” (earlier) create a non-zero tail risk of a last-minute joint statement.  
   - Mechanism: lowest-effort “deal” is a reciprocal political commitment to stay under New START limits until Feb 2027, which might be described as a stopgap/successor in some reporting.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** ~**4 days** (Feb 1 → before Feb 5, 2026).
- With so little time, the only realistic “Yes” pathway is **a last-minute announcement** of a **political arrangement** (or extremely short successor document) that credible sources characterize as extending/replacing New START through Feb 5, 2027.

**If timeframe were halved (~2 days):** probability would fall further (near-zero), because even coordinating a joint announcement becomes harder.  
**If timeframe were doubled (~8 days):** probability would rise somewhat (still low), because late-stage signaling could still crystallize into a political “freeze” announcement; but the lack of negotiation reporting would keep it in low single digits.

### (d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from the 2% outside view
My outside view was **2%**, already reflecting: (i) very short time, (ii) no negotiations, (iii) legal/structural issues.

**New inside-view information since that baseline (late Jan–Feb 1 reporting) is net-negative**:
- Multiple current reports converge on **“no formal action,” “Trump mum,” “no substantive reaction,” “no focused talks,”** and broad expectation of expiration.
- The key “movement” that would precede a “Yes” (draft text, announced summit/call with deliverables, joint statement pending, congressional consultations) is absent in public reporting at the moment when it would normally surface.

**However, I do not go all the way to ~0%** because:
- A minimal, face-saving reciprocal statement (“we will each continue to observe the central limits for one year”) remains procedurally easy, and could be announced abruptly.
- Resolution criteria allow “credible reports” of extension/replacement; it does not explicitly require ratification. If ACA or similar credible outlets were to describe a political arrangement as “extended to Feb 5, 2027,” that could trigger a “Yes,” even if lawyers dispute “extension.”

Net: I nudge **down** from 2% to a lower figure, but retain a small tail risk for a last-minute announcement.

Probability calibration:
- Outside view base rate: **2%**
- Inside view update:
  - **Downward**: strong convergence of up-to-the-hour reporting that no action is happening; no talks; Trump’s “if it expires, it expires.”  
  - **Upward (small tail):** Putin offer still on table; easy-to-announce one-year political freeze could satisfy some credible-report interpretations.
- Final inside-view probability: **1%**

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “By Feb 5, 2026, will credible reporting say New START is extended/replaced so limits last at least to Feb 5, 2027?”  
2) Outside view base rate: **2%**.  
3) Consistency line: “**1 out of 100** times, a credible source reports an extension/successor through Feb 5, 2027 before Feb 5, 2026.”  
4) Key evidence:
   - VCDNP: treaty **cannot be extended** again legally; only informal options.
   - Multiple late-Jan/Feb 1 reports: **no formal US response**, expectation of expiration.
   - No successor negotiations reported; only Putin’s one-year proposal remains.
5) Blind spot: A sudden Trump–Putin announcement of a reciprocal one-year “successor/extension” freeze that ACA treats as extending/replacing New START.  
6) Status quo: Default is expiration with no qualifying renewal; short horizon favors status quo.

Probability: 1%
