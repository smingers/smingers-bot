Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Arms Control Association news brief (Mar 2023) – Reliable NGO with long track-record of accuracy on treaty developments. Facts: Russia suspended participation; verification halted; treaty still legally in force but non-functional. Opinion: U.S. officials call the move “irresponsible.” The factual content is high quality, bias minimal.  
2. SIPRI statement (Feb 2023) – World-class, data-driven institute. Repeats facts on suspension; labels the move “disappointing” (opinion). Good factual reliability.  
3. VCDNP paper (Jan 2026) – Written by Dr. Nikolai Sokov, a recognised arms-control scholar. Facts: New START cannot be legally extended again; Senate ratification odds poor; describes Putin’s Sept 2025 offer of an informal one-year freeze (to Feb 2027). Analytical tone, high credibility.  
4. CFR article (Nov 2025) – By two nuclear-security fellows, quoting U.S. and Russian leaders. Confirms Putin’s one-year proposal and U.S. hesitation. Good factual sourcing; policy recommendations are opinion.  
5. Agent report (Jan 2026) – Collates official statements 2021-26, cites primary documents (State Dept., Kremlin, Congressional hearings). Internal consistency is good and sourcing transparent, but it is still a secondary compilation, so a notch below primary material.  
6. Two unrelated articles (California cap-and-trade, WNBA CBA) – No relevance; ignored.

(b) Reference-class analysis  

Potential classes:  
i. U.S.–Russian strategic arms treaties approaching expiration (SALT I-II 1972-79, START I-II 1991-2002, SORT 2002-10, original New START 2010-21).  
ii. Major bilateral security treaties renegotiated with <6 months left before lapse.  
iii. Treaties under which one party suspended compliance two or more years before expiry.

Class (iii) best matches current situation: prolonged suspension + days remaining. Historical base rate: 0/3 examples (ABM 2002, CFE 2007-15, INF 2019) were rescued once suspension/withdrawal occurred; all collapsed. That implies a raw base rate near 0 %. Even if we soften to class (ii), last-minute rescues are extremely rare (SORT replaced by New START nine months before expiry; nothing within the final week).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  

• Days until question closes: 4.  
• Required action: signing (or at minimum mutually announced political agreement) of an instrument lasting to ≥5 Feb 2027.  
• U.S. domestic requirement: any legally binding treaty needs two-thirds Senate consent—impossible in four days. An executive agreement could in principle bypass the Senate, but nothing indicates negotiations are that advanced.  
• Russian requirement: Duma ratification for binding treaty; also infeasible in four days.  

(d) Justification for outside view  

Baseline: Using class (iii) (suspended arms accords), probability of formal renewal ≈0 %.  Because the resolution criteria accept a “successor agreement” so long as credible sources describe it that way, we must allow a sliver of probability that:  
1) Moscow and Washington accept Putin’s informal one-year freeze and 2) respected outlets (e.g., Arms Control Association, Reuters) immediately label it a “successor” running through Feb 2027.  

Practical obstacles:  
• No evidence of active talks since Sept 2025.  
• Only 96 hours remain; neither side has announced a meeting.  
• Even if a political understanding were struck, framing it as an “agreement that will last until at least Feb 5 2027” would require very explicit language; otherwise media will call it a “political pledge,” unlikely to meet the platform’s bar.  

Expert/market sentiment: Virtually all expert commentary since 2024 treats New START’s lapse as a given and focuses on post-treaty risk-reduction. No betting or prediction market visible price exceeds 5 %.  

Combining:  
• Base rate (0 %)  
• Small tail (1-2 %) for an 11th-hour political deal being branded a successor treaty  
→ Outside-view point estimate ≈1 – 2 %. I choose 1 % to reflect extreme improbability while acknowledging non-zero tail risk.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor at 2 % (upper edge of “black-swan” tail for unprecedented diplomatic breakthroughs). Adjust −1 % for:  
• Zero preparatory signalling in January 2026 press briefings.  
• Senate/Duma procedural impossibilities for a formal treaty.  

Final calibrated outside-view probability: 1 %.
