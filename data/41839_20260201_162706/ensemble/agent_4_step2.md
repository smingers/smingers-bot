Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, 2026 unless noted)

1. VCDNP (14 Jan) – Expert essay by Dr N. Sokov.  Factual: treaty cannot be legally extended again; Russia offered a one-year political freeze; no U.S. reply.  Opinion: deal “largely symbolic” but “desirable”.  High-quality think-tank, recent.

2. Japan Times (9 Jan) – Straight news.  Factual: zero successor talks, both sides pre-occupied by Ukraine.  Medium quality.

3. Modern Diplomacy (8 Jan) – News/analysis.  Echoes Putin one-year offer, cites experts.  Medium quality.

4. UNODA note (27 Jan) – UN side-event summary.  Factual: no formal negotiations, quotes identifiable experts.  High quality for factual statements.

5. AskNews bundle (1 Feb) – 12 newswires from AFP, SCMP, Reuters, etc.  All state: expiration in days; Putin one-year offer; Trump non-committal (“if it expires, it expires”); no negotiations.  Reliable mainstream outlets, extremely recent.

6. State Dept / ACA fact sheets (static, 2023–24) – Provide treaty background; irrelevant to current decision dynamics but authoritative on legalities.

Across sources, no report of on-going talks or impending announcement; multiple outlets explicitly note the absence of contact.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
• Structural/legal: Only one 5-yr extension permitted (multiple expert and official confirmations).  Difficult to change in four days → strongly toward “No”.
• Public record: No negotiations under way (Japan Times, Reuters, UNODA, SCMP, AFP).  Independent, convergent → strongly toward “No”.

Moderate evidence
• Putin’s Sept 2025 political-freeze proposal (widely reported) shows theoretical Yes-path if U.S. reciprocates → modestly toward “Yes”.
• Trump’s initial “sounds good” remark but later “if it expires, it expires” (SCMP, AFP) → modestly toward “No”.

Weak evidence
• Diplomatic surprises sometimes occur very late (historical START I signing after last-minute concessions).  No concrete signs now → small lift to “Yes”.

Net evidence balance: overwhelmingly against a qualifying extension/replacement being announced inside four days.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time left: ≈ 4 days (1 Feb → 5 Feb 2026).  Probability is highly time-sensitive:

• If the window were doubled to eight days, little change (still far too little time for a treaty + ratification).
• If halved to two days, probability would shrink further (~1 %).  Thus probability curve steeply decays as expiry approaches.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate for a last-minute U.S.–Russia strategic arms-control continuation given active hostilities and verification collapse: 3 %.

Inside-view downward shifts
1. Confirmed absence of negotiations (strong evidence) → –2 pp.
2. Explicit U.S. indifference (“if it expires, it expires”) → –0.5 pp.
3. Legal impossibility of formal extension; only path is political declaration that still must be jointly announced and labelled a successor (strong hurdle) → –0.3 pp.

Inside-view upward nudge
1. Putin’s standing offer could be accepted by unilateral White House statement; political freezes need no Senate ratification (moderate evidence) → +0.5 pp.

Final synthesis ≈ 2 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that about 2 out of 100 comparable situations would see a qualifying announcement emerge in the final four days—almost always via a minimalist reciprocal declaration unexpectedly leaked and endorsed by ACA.  A 1 percentage-point change up or down reflects a 50 % swing in odds (from 98:2 to 99:1 or 97:3) and would require evidence of even informal staff-level contact, which is presently absent.

Checklist:

1. Restated question: By 5 Feb 2026 will credible sources report New START or a named successor extended to ≥ 5 Feb 2027?  
2. Base rate used: 3 % for last-minute great-power arms-control continuations under high tension.  
3. Consistency line: “2 out of 100 times, a qualifying extension/successor is announced before 5 Feb 2026.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • No negotiations acknowledged by either side (Reuters, AFP, UNODA).  
   • Trump quote “if it expires, it expires”.  
   • Legal bar on second formal extension.  
   • Putin’s open one-year offer awaiting reply.  
5. Blind-spot: secret bilateral back-channel already agreed; joint statement released on 4 Feb.  Would swing probability to >50 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: Expiry with no deal is default; four-day horizon favours status-quo outcome.

Probability: 2%
