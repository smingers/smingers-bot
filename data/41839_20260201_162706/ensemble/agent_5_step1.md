Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Arms Control Association news brief, March 2023 – High-quality NGO specialising in treaty documentation.  Factual content: Russia “suspended” New START on 21 Feb 2023; only one extension is legally possible and it was used in 2021.  Opinions: U.S. and Russian politicians criticise the other side.  Relevant fact: inspections and data exchanges have been frozen since 2020/22.  

2. SIPRI statement, Feb 2023 – Authoritative research institute.  Adds no new facts beyond the suspension but confirms Russia said it would stay under numerical limits.  

3. VCDNP paper, Jan 2026 – Senior arms-control fellow.  Factual: treaty cannot be re-extended; Putin’s Sept 2025 offer is an informal, one-year freeze (Feb 2026-Feb 2027) with no verification.  Opinion: chances of verification restart “very low”.  Credible.  

4. CFR article, Nov 2025 – Think-tank fellows; quotes Trump, Rubio.  Factual: Putin’s one-year proposal; U.S. has not responded formally.  Opinion: U.S. should demand verification.  

5 & 6. Two unrelated ESPN/California articles – no bearing.  

7. Agent report (chronology 2021-26) – Compiles open-source facts, cites published documents; internally consistent with ACA/SIPRI/CFR pieces.  Main factual take-aways:  
   • Only a political, not legal, extension is on the table (one-year freeze).  
   • No inspection/data exchange regime since 2023.  
   • No U.S.-Russian negotiating session announced since Nov 2025 UNGA sidelines.  
   • Senate ratification hurdle for any new treaty is high.  
   The report contains some analytic opinion but is largely fact collation.

(b) Reference-class analysis  

Potential classes:  
1. Previous U.S.–Russia strategic treaties at end-of-term (START I 2009, SORT 2009, INF 2019, Open Skies 2020, New START 2021) – 1 renewed (New START in 2021), 4 expired/terminated.  Renewal rate: 20 %.  
2. Treaties renewed when one party has declared suspension/non-compliance within three years of expiry – none have been saved.  Renewal rate: 0 %.  
3. Treaties requiring U.S. Senate two-thirds vote within < 30 days of lapse – none have succeeded.  Renewal rate: 0 %.

Class 2 matches the essential features (Russian suspension, days from expiry).  I adopt class 2.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Time remaining: 4 days (1 Feb → 5 Feb 2026).  Historically, New START’s 2021 extension was concluded 9 days before expiry (more time than remains now) and involved goodwill on both sides.  No other example of a complex treaty being rescued inside a week exists.

(d) Justification  

Status quo: Treaty expires on 5 Feb 2026 with no verification in place.  
For a YES resolution we would need, before 5 Feb 2026:  
• A legally binding instrument OR a mutually acknowledged successor agreement running at least to 5 Feb 2027, AND  
• Credible reporting of that outcome.

Obstacles within the four-day window:  
1. Legal – New START cannot be re-extended; a new treaty or executive agreement would require text, signatures and (for a treaty) Senate advice and consent—impossible in four days.  
2. Political – Russia still links any deal to Ukraine-related demands; U.S. domestic debate is polarised.  No negotiating channel has met publicly since Sept 2025.  
3. Verification – Even Putin’s “political” freeze lacks agreed language and would not be announced as a “successor treaty” by both sides.  
4. Information – No leaks, draft texts or emergency summit have been reported by ACA, SIPRI, the State Department, or Russian MFA as of 1 Feb 2026.  Sudden, secret conclusion of such a deal would be historically unprecedented.

Given class 2’s 0 % base rate, I start with 1 % to allow for model uncertainty.  Market signals are unavailable, but expert commentary (ACA, VCDNP) currently treats expiry as a foregone conclusion.  I assign an inside-view downward adjustment: the remaining four days are less than half the 9-day “New START 2021” precedent and the political environment is far worse.  I cut the 1 % in half, then round a little upward to avoid zero-probability error.

Outside view calibration:

• Base rate (treaties in comparable circumstances renewed): 0 % → 1 % floor.  
• Negative evidence (suspension, no talks, 4-day window): × 0.5.  
• Residual tail for truly extraordinary last-minute executive agreement: + 0.2 %.  

Outside View Prediction:
0.7 % (≈ 1 in 140 chance) that New START will be renewed or replaced so that it lasts to at least 5 Feb 2027, with the necessary reports emerging before 5 Feb 2026.
