Analysis:
1. Source analysis (quality/date & fact vs. opinion)
• VCDNP (14 Jan 2026, NGO think-tank): High quality. Facts – legal impossibility of a second formal New START extension; Russia’s Sept 2025 one-year offer; no U.S. reply. Opinions – “very low” chance of restoring verification.  
• U.S. State Dept. factsheet (permanent page, last updated 2024): Authoritative on treaty mechanics; silent on 2026 prospects.  
• Arms Control Association factsheet (updated 2025): High quality, reiterates treaty limits and Russia’s 2023 suspension. Mostly factual.  
• Japan Times, Modern Diplomacy, UNODA side-event reports (8-27 Jan 2026): All agree no negotiations are under way; cite Putin’s offer and Trump’s lack of response. Quality: mainstream to specialist; facts largely consistent.  
• AskNews compilation (31 Jan–1 Feb 2026, multiple global outlets): Eleven independent newswires/papers confirm (a) expiry on 5 Feb 2026, (b) absence of negotiations, (c) only Putin’s one-year limits-freeze proposal, (d) Trump’s “if it expires, it expires” remark (NYT, 7 Jan 2026). Opinions mostly from recognisable experts (Kimball, Sokov, Podvig, Wolfsthal) stressing improbability of renewal.  
No credible source reports any secret or emergency talks in the final week.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)
Strong evidence  
• Structural/legal: Treaty text forbids further formal extensions (multiple sources).  
• Historical pattern: Every bilateral U.S.–Russia arms pact that reached final days without draft text (INF 2019, Open Skies 2020, ABM 2002) lapsed.  
• Multisource confirmation: Eleven outlets on 31 Jan–1 Feb say “no negotiations”.  
Moderate evidence  
• Putin’s public offer of a 12-month voluntary freeze (could technically meet question’s bar if reciprocated).  
• Precedent of 2021 extension nine days before expiry (shows late deals are possible).  
Weak evidence  
• Trump’s initial “sounds good” (Sept 2025) – non-formal, later contradicted.  
• Speculation that a last-minute executive agreement could bypass Senate.

3. Timeframe analysis
Time remaining: 4 days to 05 Feb 2026 deadline. Probability would roughly quadruple (to ~4 %) if we still had 30 days; would halve (to ~0.5 %) if only 48 hours remained.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (treaties in similar suspended/last-week state get reprieve): ≈1 %.  
Inside factors pushing lower:  
• No text, no talks, hostile politics, legal bar on formal extension (-0.5 %).  
Inside factors pushing higher:  
• Putin’s voluntary one-year limits offer; possible U.S. executive-agreement workaround (+0.4 %).  
Net: 0.9 % rounded to 1 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 1 out of 100 times, credible reports of an extension/successor lasting to 5 Feb 2027 will emerge before 5 Feb 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Criterion: Positive if, by 5 Feb 2026, New START or successor visibly extended to ≥5 Feb 2027.  
2. Base rate noted above.  
3. Consistency line given.  
4. Key evidence: (a) Legal bar on formal extension; (b) zero ongoing talks; (c) four-day window; (d) Putin’s unilateral offer; (e) Trump’s dismissive quote.  
5. Blind-spot: Secret summit producing a political statement tonight, instantly reported by ACA/Reuters—would raise probability to >50 %.  
6. Status quo = expiry; nudged forecast slightly toward status quo.

Probability: 1%
