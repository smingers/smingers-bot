# Summary of "Russia Suspends New START" (Arms Control Association, March 2023)

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Russia's Suspension Announcement**: On February 21, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia is suspending its participation in New START during a state-of-the-nation address.

2. **Putin's Conditions for Resumption**: To resume treaty activities, Putin stated the United States would need to:
   - Cut off support for Ukraine
   - Bring France and the United Kingdom into arms control talks

3. **Treaty Expiration Date**: New START expires on February 5, 2026, and no successor arms control arrangement exists at this time.

4. **U.S. Compliance Assessment**: In January 2023, the U.S. State Department's annual report found Russia failed to comply with New START due to:
   - Refusal to permit on-site inspections
   - Refusal to reschedule a required treaty meeting

5. **Inspection Suspension Timeline**:
   - On-site inspections suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19
   - Russia extended suspension in August 2022
   - Bilateral Consultative Commission meeting scheduled for late November 2022 in Cairo was unilaterally postponed by Russia one day before

6. **Impact on Data Exchanges**: Putin's suspension decision will halt the required twice-yearly data exchanges on strategic nuclear arsenals.

## Expert Opinions and Assessments:

**Named Sources:**

- **U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken** (Feb. 21, 2023): Called Putin's decision "deeply unfortunate and irresponsible" but stated the U.S. "remain[s] ready to talk about strategic arms limitations at any time with Russia."

- **Cara Abercrombie** (U.S. National Security Council coordinator for defense policy and arms control, Feb. 1, 2023): Stated Russia's noncompliance "threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control moving forward."

- **Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen** (Federation of American Scientists, Feb. 7, 2023): Estimated that in a scenario with no arms control, Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear forces would approximately double in size "if both countries uploaded their delivery systems to accommodate the maximum number of possible warheads."

- **Republican Congressional Members** (Jan. 31, 2023 statement by Mike Rogers, Roger Wicker, Doug Lamborn, Deb Fischer): Criticized Russia for violating the treaty and the Biden administration for "naively" agreeing to the treaty's extension in 2021.

- **Democratic Senators** (Feb. 1, 2023 statement by Bob Menendez, Jack Reed, Mark Warner): Warned that "compliance with New START…obligations will be critical to Senate consideration of any future strategic arms control treaty with Moscow."

**U.S. Government Assessment:**
- Despite noncompliance findings, the U.S. report determined Russia's noncompliance does not threaten U.S. national security interests and there does not exist "a strategic imbalance" between the two nuclear powers.
- Russia likely remained under the New START warhead limit of 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads at the end of 2022.

## Context:

This article documents the deterioration of the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia, raising concerns among experts that the world's two largest nuclear arsenals might go unconstrained for the first time since 1972 when the treaty expires in 2026.

# Summary of SIPRI Statement on New START Suspension (February 22, 2023)

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Date of announcement**: February 21, 2023 - Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would suspend its participation in New START during his State of the Nation address.

2. **Treaty status**: New START is described as "the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the world's two nuclear superpowers: Russia and the United States."

3. **Nature of suspension**: Putin has not withdrawn Russia from the treaty, only suspended participation.

4. **Inspection provisions affected**: 
   - The treaty gave Russia and the USA the right to make 18 visits to each other's weapons sites annually
   - These inspections have been called off since the pandemic started
   - Russia claimed US sanctions-based travel restrictions made it difficult for Russian inspectors to access US sites
   - Russia refused to allow US inspectors to Russian sites in response
   - In November 2022, Russia deferred sine die (indefinitely) a meeting of the bilateral commission established to handle such problems

5. **Russian commitments maintained**:
   - Russia confirmed it does not intend to breach the treaty limits
   - Russia will continue to notify the USA about long-range missile launches

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Dan Smith, SIPRI Director**, characterized the suspension as:
- "A disappointing, unimaginative but unsurprising step from which nobody benefits"
- "Relatively predictable"
- Creating uncertainty that "could also be dangerous in today's atmosphere of heated animosity"
- Potentially increasing difficulties in Russia-USA relations and with their respective allies
- May increase difficulties in preserving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty

## Background Context:

- New START was signed April 8, 2010, entered into force February 5, 2011
- Required reductions were achieved by February 5, 2018
- "One by one the pillars of nuclear arms control between Russia and the USA have been pulled down over the past two decades"

# Summary of "End of New START: Short- and Medium-Term Options"

**Source:** Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation  
**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Author:** Dr. Nikolai Sokov (VCDNP Senior Fellow)

## Key Facts and Timeline:

1. **Expiration Date:** New START Treaty expires on February 5, 2026, ending an era of US-Soviet/Russian arms control that began in 1969 with SALT I negotiations.

2. **Extension Impossibility:** The treaty cannot be extended further—it only permitted one five-year extension, which was already used in 2021. Keeping it alive would require re-ratification, but prospects for a two-thirds majority in the US Senate are described as low.

3. **Current Status:** Russia suspended its participation in New START in spring 2023. While Russia remains bound by quantitative and qualitative limits, the verification regime (including inspections and data exchanges) has been frozen.

## Putin's Proposal:

- **September 2025:** President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would continue adhering to New START's quantitative and qualitative limits for one year after expiration and invited the US to do the same, with possibility of extension.

- **Trump's Response:** President Donald Trump described the idea as "good" but the US had issued no official response at time of writing. Trump subsequently remarked "if it expires, it expires" and promised a "better agreement" without providing specifics.

## Analysis and Opinions (from author Dr. Sokov):

- Putin's proposal would be "largely symbolic" as it would continue the treaty's suspended state without restoring verification
- The likelihood Russia would agree to restore the verification regime is "very low"
- Verification restoration would require US Congressional approval for funding
- Strategic balance is "highly resilient" and planned programs won't have tangible impact for several years
- The arrangement could provide "a modest—though very small—degree of predictability over the next two to five years"
- The proposal could have "more meaningful political effect" regarding the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the forthcoming NPT Review Conference

# Article Summary: Putin's Nuclear Offer: How to Navigate a New START Extension

**Source:** Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)  
**Date:** November 19, 2025  
**Authors:** Erin D. Dumbacher (Stanton Nuclear Security Senior Fellow at CFR) and John Drennan (Senior Policy Analyst at RAND Corporation; Robert A. Belfer International Affairs Fellow in European Security at CFR)

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Putin's Proposal:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed extending New START for one year. Putin states this would help "avoid provoking a further arms race" and "ensure an acceptable level of predictability and restraint."

2. **Trump's Initial Response:** President Trump has said the extension "sounds like a good idea," though the White House has not yet clarified its official position.

3. **Treaty Expiration:** If no action is taken, New START will expire on February 5, 2026.

4. **Current Treaty Status:** The treaty is described as "on life support." Russia suspended its participation in the verification regime in 2022 at the start of the Ukraine war, though Moscow claims it continues to abide by the central limits (1,550 deployed warheads).

5. **Verification Regime History:** The intrusive verification regime operated from 2011 until paused during COVID-19, then Russia suspended participation in 2022. It previously included:
   - 18 on-site inspections per year
   - Data exchanges
   - Launch notifications
   - Non-interference commitments regarding National Technical Means
   - Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) meetings twice per year

6. **U.S. Modernization Plans:** The U.S. nuclear arsenal modernization project costs approximately $1 trillion over the next ten years and would be largely unchanged by a one-year extension.

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**From the Authors (Dumbacher and Drennan):**
- The U.S. should only accept the extension if Russia agrees to:
  1. A follow-on negotiation process
  2. At least a partial return to New START's verification regime
  3. Reaffirmation of the treaty's non-interference commitment
  
- "An unverifiable, one-year extension is not a substitute for peace in Europe"
- The administration should demand return to verification aspects possible in the short term (data exchanges, non-interference provisions)
- Any Russian offers should be met with skepticism if protecting U.S., allied, and Ukrainian interests

**From Secretary of State Marco Rubio (cited):**
- The U.S. wants to see a settlement to the Ukraine war that guarantees Ukraine's security and prevents future war

**From President Trump (cited):**
- New START is "not an agreement you want expiring. When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem"
- Has recently called for a return to nuclear testing (though neither U.S. nor Russia has conducted large-scale explosive testing since the 1990s)

# Article Summary

**Disclaimer**: This article is about WNBA collective bargaining agreement negotiations and is not relevant to the forecasting question about the New START nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia.

## Key Content:
This ESPN article discusses the WNBA and WNBPA (Women's National Basketball Players Association) agreeing to a 30-day extension of their current collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which was set to expire. The article covers:

- The extension was agreed upon 24 hours before the original expiration deadline
- The WNBPA had opted out of the CBA over a year ago, giving both sides time to negotiate a new deal
- Main sticking points include salary systems and revenue sharing models
- The league has proposed significant salary increases (reported supermax around $850,000 vs. current $249,244)
- Players are seeking a revenue-tied system similar to the NBA rather than fixed-rate model
- Other player priorities include facility standards, charter travel, retirement benefits, and changes to "prioritization" and "core" system rules
- The extension allows continued negotiations while avoiding immediate work stoppage
- Time pressure exists due to upcoming expansion draft and free agency period before the 2026 season

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a detailed timeline (2021-2026) of official U.S. and Russian statements, negotiations, or proposals concerning extending or replacing New START, including any Arms Control Association or State Department reports discussing an extension to 2027 or a successor treaty lasting that long. Highlight legal obstacles raised after Russia’s 2023 suspension and summarize congressional or Kremlin positions impacting renewal prospects.
Below is a consolidated, year-by-year chronology (2021-2026) of the principal official statements, negotiations and proposals by the United States and the Russian Federation on extending or replacing the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START).  For each entry the source is indicated in brackets.

2021  
• 4-5 February – Within 48 hours of taking office, President Biden instructed the U.S. government to invoke the treaty’s Article XIV provision for a “one-time, up-to-five-year” extension.  President Putin signed the corresponding Russian federal law the same day; the extension to 5 February 2026 entered into force on 5 February 2021.  (Background summarized in [MKI 17 Dec 2025] and [ArmsControl Oct 2025]).  
• Spring–Autumn – U.S. and Russian diplomats reopened the “Strategic Stability Dialogue” to explore a follow-on arrangement.  No concrete negotiating mandate was produced.

2022  
• March – Because of COVID-19, both sides kept in place the mutual pause on on-site inspections that had begun in 2020.  
• 8 August – When the United States gave notice that it would resume inspections, Russia invoked the treaty’s “temporary exemption” clause to bar inspectors, citing U.S. visa and air-transit restrictions.  (Detailed in the State Department’s compliance narrative quoted by [Cambridge AJIL]).  
• 29 Nov–2 Dec – A Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) session scheduled in Cairo was unilaterally postponed by Moscow “at the highest political level” ([Cambridge AJIL]).  Russia made continuation of inspections contingent on the lifting of sanctions-related travel limits and on broader discussions of NATO nuclear forces.

2023  
• 31 Jan – In its annual compliance report to Congress the U.S. State Department for the first time found Russia in “non-compliance”, citing (1) failure to allow inspections and (2) failure to convene a BCC session within the treaty-mandated 45-day window.  (Summarized in [Cambridge AJIL]).  
• 21 Feb – President Putin announced that Russia would “suspend” participation in New START, while stressing that it was not withdrawing.  The treaty contains no suspension clause, creating an immediate legal gray area.  Russia’s implementing law gave the president sole authority to decide on re-entry ([ArmsControl Apr 2023]; [SIPRI 22 Feb 2023]).  
	Legal obstacles highlighted after suspension  
	– Treaty text allows only withdrawal on 3-months’ notice, not suspension.  
	– Article XIV(2) already used in 2021; a second formal extension is legally impossible, leaving only negotiation of a new treaty or a political arrangement (explained in [ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]).  
	– Russian domestic secrecy laws preclude providing data or hosting inspectors absent a binding accord ([ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]).  
• 22-23 Feb – President Biden called the suspension a “big mistake”.  Secretary Blinken affirmed that the United States remained ready to negotiate “at any time” ([ArmsControl Apr 2023]).  
• Spring – The Pentagon ceased providing the treaty’s detailed bi-annual aggregate data in reciprocity for Russia’s cut-off of notifications ([ArmsControl Apr 2023]).  
• Congressional reaction – House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-AL) urged preparations to “deploy additional nuclear forces”, while Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) pressed Moscow to return to compliance ([ArmsControl Apr 2023]).  These opposing views frame a divided congressional outlook for post-2026 arms control.

2024  
• 30 July – RAND Corporation, in a study requested by congressional staff, outlined unilateral and bilateral options the United States could pursue “in a scenario of continued Russian non-compliance”, including political caps or a minimalist verification regime ([RAND 30 Jul 2024]).  The report implicitly acknowledged that, because New START cannot be re-extended, any arrangement after 2026 must be new.  
• U.S. Executive Branch – National Security Council official Pranay Vaddi warned publicly that if adversary arsenals continued to grow the United States “may reach a point…where an increase from current deployed numbers is required” (quoted in [ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]).  This signalled to Moscow—and to Capitol Hill—that Washington is prepared for a post-treaty environment if diplomacy fails.

2025  
• 8 May – Russia and China issued a joint statement condemning U.S. “Golden Dome” space-based missile-defence plans, tying future strategic limits to restrictions on U.S. missile-defence deployments ([ArmsControl Oct 2025]).  
• 22 Sept – At a Russian Security Council meeting President Putin offered a novel proposal: Russia would “voluntarily observe” New START’s numerical ceilings for one year beyond 5 Feb 2026, provided the United States acted likewise.  He explicitly framed this as an informal political arrangement, acknowledging that a formal legal extension is impossible.  A destabilising U.S. move—specifically deployment of interceptors in space—would void the offer ([MKI 17 Dec 2025]; [ArmsControl Oct 2025]).  
• 24 Sept – On the margins of the UNGA, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov discussed the offer but announced no progress ([ArmsControl Oct 2025]).  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the idea sounded “pretty good”, and President Trump told TASS it “sounds like a good idea”, indicating provisional U.S. receptivity.  
• Congressional context – The bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission had already argued that current U.S. nuclear plans were “necessary but not sufficient”; some members interpreted this as a need to prepare to exceed New START levels after 2026 ([ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]).  That sentiment complicated any administration move to accept an informal freeze.  
• Legal assessment – Arms Control Association analysts noted that because the treaty will have expired, a mutual freeze would be “politically but not legally binding” and would lack verification unless negotiated separately ([ArmsControl Oct 2025]; [ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]).

2026  
• 5 Feb – New START scheduled to expire.  No verification activity has occurred since March 2020, and all data exchanges ceased in 2023.  
• 7 Jan – Brookings Institution panel with Assistant Secretary Mallory Stewart reiterated that the United States is still prepared to negotiate risk-reduction measures even in a “post-treaty world” ([Brookings 7 Jan 2026]).  
• Kremlin position – Russian officials continue to link any successor arrangement to (1) inclusion of UK and French strategic forces and (2) constraints on U.S. missile defence and long-range conventional strike systems (earlier stated in 2023 and repeated in 2025 sources above).  The public offer of a one-year ceiling freeze therefore remains conditional and fragile.  
• U.S. domestic scene – With the treaty’s demise imminent, supporters in Congress still cite Arms Control Association alerts that “even a thin political ceiling is better than an arms race”, while opponents argue that Russia’s 2023 suspension proves formal limits are unenforceable.  No consensus-shaping legislation had passed as of January 2026.

Key legal and political obstacles that now dominate the renewal debate  
1. Treaty Text Limit – Article XIV permits only a single 5-year extension, already used; therefore any “2027” reference must be a new legal instrument or a non-binding parallel arrangement.  
2. Suspension Versus Withdrawal – Russia’s 2023 “suspension” has no basis in the treaty and undercuts the BCC mechanism and verification rules, eroding mutual trust ([Cambridge AJIL]; [SIPRI]).  
3. Verification Gap – With inspections halted since 2020 and data exchanges halted 2023-26, re-establishing transparency would require either ratification of a new treaty through the U.S. Senate and Russia’s Federal Assembly or a politically binding executive agreement accompanied by tailored legislation—both heavy lifts in the current political climate ([ArmsControl Jan/Feb 2025]; [RAND 2024]).  
4. Linkage to Ukraine and Missile Defence – Moscow explicitly conditions its return not only on NATO behaviour in Ukraine but also on limiting U.S. and allied nuclear and missile-defence capabilities.  This linkage is unacceptable to many in Washington, blocking even preliminary talks ([MKI 2025]; [ArmsControl Apr 2023]).  
5. U.S. Domestic Divisions – Congressional calls to prepare force increases (Rogers) conflict with advocates of negotiated limits; Senate advice-and-consent hurdles for any new treaty are high.

Arms Control Association & State Department contributions mentioning 2027 or successor duration  
• The Arms Control Association’s news brief “Russia Proposes One-Year New START Extension” (Oct 2025) describes the Kremlin’s offer to keep limits “for one year after its expiration”—i.e., until February 2027.  
• ACA’s feature “Life After New START” (Jan/Feb 2025) explains why a further legal extension past 2026 is “impossible” and canvasses concepts for a new accord that could run beyond 2027.  
• The State Department’s January 2023 report to Congress formalised the U.S. finding of Russian non-compliance, one of the obstacles to any long-term successor (“lasting that long”) treaty.

Conclusion and information gaps  
The record shows a sharp trajectory: early 2021 cooperation (five-year extension), mounting procedural disputes in 2022, Russia’s legally dubious suspension in 2023, and by 2025-26 a last-ditch Russian proposal for a one-year informal freeze that would de facto push New START-type ceilings into 2027 without restoring verification.  Congressional scepticism in Washington and Kremlin demands for broader NATO participation are the main political brakes on formal renewal talks.

Remaining gaps where fresh information would strengthen the picture include:  
• Any 2024-2025 State Department or Russian Foreign Ministry white papers laying out detailed negotiating positions for a successor treaty.  
• Concrete U.S. legislative proposals (if any) introduced after the 2023 suspension addressing post-2026 force structure or arms-control authorities.  
• Official French or UK responses to Russia’s demand that their arsenals be counted—important because Moscow has made this a precondition.

If those documents become available, they could further clarify prospects for any arrangement running through 2027 and beyond.</Agent_report>
