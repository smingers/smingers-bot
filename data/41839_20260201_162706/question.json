There are credible reports such as by the [Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USRussiaNuclearAgreements) of New START being extended to at least February 5, 2027.\n2. There are credible reports of New START being replaced by another nuclear arms control agreement that will last until at least February 5, 2027 and that US officials, Russian officials, and other credible sources describe as a successor to New START.",

But note that the second condition would not be met if one or two of the three relevant groups (US officials, Russian officials, or other credible sources) do *not* describe the treaty as a successor to New START.\n\n***\n\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8393) which opened on 2021-10-28 14:00:00. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled.
