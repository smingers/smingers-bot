Analysis:
The key to judging the likelihood that New START will be renewed before 5 Feb 2026 is understanding (a) the formal status of the treaty since its February 2021 five-year extension, (b) Russia’s February 2023 “suspension” and whether that legally blocks extension, (c) the state of U.S.–Russian strategic-stability talks since the Ukraine invasion, (d) any public negotiating proposals, draft agreements, or congressional activity that could enable a successor accord, and (e) what the Arms Control Association or comparable sources have reported about concrete steps toward prolonging or replacing the treaty to at least 5 Feb 2027. A concise chronology of diplomatic statements, meetings, and legal analyses from 2021-2026 will give the best outside view.
