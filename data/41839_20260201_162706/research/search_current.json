Non-Proliferation  \n**Date:** January 14, 2026  \n**Author:** Dr. Nikolai Sokov (VCDNP Senior Fellow)\n\n## Key Facts and Dates:\n\n- **New START expires on February 5, 2026**, ending an era of US-Soviet/Russian arms control that began in 1969 with SALT I negotiations\n- For the first time in decades, there will be no treaty constraining the nuclear arms race between the US and Russia\n- The treaty was signed in 2010, entered into force in early 2011\n- **New START cannot be extended** - it only permitted one five-year extension, which was already used in 2021\n- In **spring 2023**, Russia suspended its participation in New START, ending the verification regime\n- The treaty reduced accountable warheads from 2,200 (under the 2002 SORT Treaty) to 1,550\n\n## Putin's Proposal:\n\n- In **September 2025**, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would continue to adhere to New START's quantitative and qualitative limits for **one year after expiration** (i.e., until February 5, 2027)\n- Putin invited the United States to do the same, with possibility of extension\n- **US President Donald Trump** described the idea as 'good' but **no official US response has been issued** as of the article's writing\n- Trump subsequently remarked that **'if it expires, it expires'** and promised a **'better agreement'** without providing specifics\n\n## Expert Analysis (Dr. Sokov's opinions):\n\n- Putin's proposal would be **\"largely symbolic\"** as it would not restore the verification regime\n- The arrangement is **\"nonetheless desirable\"** in light of the forthcoming NPT Review Conference\n- The likelihood that Russia would restore the verification regime is **\"very low\"**\n- Both sides are already planning programs that will eventually alter strategic balance, though these won't have tangible impact for several years\n- The proposal could provide **\"a modest\u2014though very small\u2014degree of predictability over the next two to five years\"**\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- New START was designed as a temporary measure to restore verification and transparency, not as a comprehensive arms control cornerstone\n- Almost all bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements have either expired or been abrogated\n- There are currently **no negotiations underway** and **none are planned**\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end, so some content may be missing from this summary.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.state.gov/new-start-treaty\">\n# Summary of U.S. Department of State Article on New START Treaty\n\n## Key Facts and Objective Information:\n\n**Treaty Status and Timeline:**\n- The New START Treaty was signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011\n- The United States and Russian Federation have agreed to extend the treaty through February 4, 2026\n- Both countries met the treaty's central limits by February 5, 2018 and have maintained compliance since\n\n**Strategic Offensive Arms Limits:**\nThe treaty imposes three aggregate limits on both parties:\n1. 700 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments\n2. 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed systems (each heavy bomber counts as one warhead)\n3. 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers\n\n**Russian Compliance Data:**\n- As of September 1, 2020 data exchange, Russia declared 1,447 deployed strategic warheads\n- Russia has capacity to deploy more than 1,550 warheads but is constrained by New START\n\n**Verification Mechanisms:**\n- 18 on-site inspections per year (up to 10 Type One, up to 8 Type Two)\n- Biannual data exchanges on deployed strategic delivery vehicles, launchers, and warheads\n- Annual exchange of telemetric information for up to 5 ICBM and SLBM launches\n- Rolling notifications on strategic delivery vehicle status and basing\n- Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) meetings at least twice yearly\n\n## Notable Context:\n- The article notes that without New START's verification measures, U.S. knowledge of Russian nuclear forces would decrease over time, resulting in less confidence in assessments and less information for decision-making about U.S. nuclear forces\n- New START limits cover Russian weapons that can reach the United States in approximately 30 minutes\n\n**Note:** This is an official U.S. Department of State fact sheet describing the treaty's structure and implementation, not analysis of prospects for renewal beyond 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

Verification and Monitoring:\n- Treaty allows 18 annual short-notice, on-site inspections\n- 10 inspections of deployed warheads and delivery systems (\"Type One\")\n- 8 inspections at facilities with non-deployed delivery systems (\"Type Two\")\n- Both sides exchange lists of warheads deployed on individual missiles\n- During inspections, each side can choose one ICBM or SLBM to inspect on short notice and count the warheads\n\n## Other Provisions:\n- New START replaced START I (1991) and superseded SORT (2002)\n- Each side has flexibility to structure its nuclear forces within overall treaty limits\n- Current and planned U.S. missile defense programs are not constrained by New START\n- The treaty does not limit modernization of strategic forces within overall treaty limits\n\n**Note**:

The treaty, which limits each country to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 800 launchers and heavy bombers, was signed in 2010 and extended by President Biden in 2021 for five years. Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s September 2025 proposal for a one-year extension and President Donald Trump\u2019s initial statement that an extension 'sounds like a good idea to me,' no formal action has followed. A White House official stated Trump wants to involve China in future arms control talks and will clarify his position on his own timeline. Experts such as Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and Jon Wolfsthal of the Federation of American Scientists criticized Trump\u2019s administration for lacking a coherent strategy and failing to act on what Wolfsthal called 'low-hanging fruit'\u2014a simple extension. The expiration of New START has contributed to the 'Doomsday Clock' being moved closer to midnight. Russia suspended key inspection provisions in 2023 amid deteriorating relations with the Biden administration over Ukraine. Russian analysts like Alexander Khramchikhin described the treaty\u2019s end as an 'empty formality,' while Vassily Kashin noted Russia would respond only if the U.S. significantly expands its nuclear arsenal. The treaty\u2019s failure to be renewed also reflects broader geopolitical tensions, including Trump\u2019s push to include China\u2014a growing nuclear power\u2014despite its arsenal being far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. allies France and Britain maintain smaller nuclear arsenals, and India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea possess nuclear weapons outside of international agreements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:15 PM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5235941)\n\n**US, Russia to enter new, unregulated nuclear age as arms pact nears expiry**\nThe New START treaty, the last remaining arms control agreement between the United States and Russia limiting nuclear weapons deployment, is set to expire on Thursday, February 1, 2026, unless extended. This marks the end of the final binding agreement in a series of Cold War-era treaties. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension in September 2025, and U.S. President Donald Trump, when asked, responded that an extension 'sounds like a good idea to me,' though no further action has been taken. According to Dmitry Medvedev, a close ally of Putin and former Russian president who co-signed the treaty in 2010, Russia has received no 'substantive reaction' from the Trump administration. The expiration of New START will usher in a new, unregulated nuclear era between the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, with the future of nuclear arms control now highly uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:43 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3341983/end-era-us-russia-prepare-exit-final-nuclear-arms-treaty)\n\n**Nuclear Arms Control at Risk: New START Treaty Expires in 2026, Prompting Concerns Over Global Arms Race**\nThe New START treaty, which limits strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia, is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Without a successor agreement by this date, the two nations will no longer be bound by arms control restrictions for the first time in over 50 years, potentially triggering a new global nuclear arms race. Although the race has already begun quietly, both the U.S. and Russia are investing heavily in modernizing their existing nuclear arsenals. For example, U.S. nuclear weapons stored at the Belgian military airbase of Kleine Brogel have undergone modernization, making them more precise and easier to deploy. Additionally, smaller nuclear powers\u2014including China, Pakistan, India, and North Korea\u2014are expanding their nuclear stockpiles by increasing the production of nuclear warheads.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:10 AM\nSource:[vrtnws.be](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2026/01/28/vanaf-volgende-week-geen-rem-meer-op-russische-en-amerikaanse-ke/)\n\n**Nuclear Disarmament: The Last U.S.-Russia Treaty Expires in Silence**\nThe New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, is set to expire on February 5, 2026, with neither side publicly addressing its renewal. Signed in 2010, the treaty limited each country to 1,550 strategic warheads, 800 launchers and heavy bombers, and included verification mechanisms\u2014though inspections were suspended in 2023 due to the war in Ukraine. Former U.S. President Donald Trump had suggested extending the treaty for one year at Russia\u2019s proposal in September 2023, but Washington never formally responded. Trump later stated that lifting nuclear restrictions would be 'a major problem for the world,' while also announcing plans to resume nuclear weapons testing in October 2023, citing other nations\u2019 programs. A White House official confirmed Trump would decide the future of arms control on his own timeline, though he expressed a desire to maintain nuclear limits and include China in negotiations. Despite this, Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association noted Trump has yet to implement a coherent strategy. The global nuclear landscape has deteriorated, with Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, Russia\u2019s test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered missile, and China\u2019s rapid nuclear buildup heightening concerns. French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot warned in early 2026 of an 'increasing risk of nuclear proliferation' due to the erosion of arms control frameworks. Russian analyst Alexandre Khramtchikhine described the treaty as already ineffective, calling its expiration a 'formality' with no real consequence. Experts like Vassili Kachine suggest the U.S. is staying silent to avoid signaling its next moves, while Russia will closely monitor American actions\u2014particularly any deployment of additional warheads\u2014potentially responding in kind. The U.S. had previously withdrawn from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. The upcoming April 2026 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in New York is also at risk of failing, according to experts.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94PA664)\n\n**U.S.-Russia New START Treaty Faces Expiration, Risking Unregulated Nuclear Arms Race**\nThe New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, is set to expire on February 5, 2026, with no indication of a last-minute extension. If not renewed, both nations will no longer be bound by limits on their long-range nuclear arsenals\u2014marking the first time since the 1972 SALT I agreement that such a gap exists. The treaty, signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev and extended in 2021, imposed quantitative limits and verification mechanisms, including on-site inspections. However, inspections were suspended in 2020 due to the pandemic, and Russia formally suspended its participation in 2023 after the invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension in September 2025 to allow time for a new agreement, but U.S. President Donald Trump has not responded officially and stated in a January 2026 interview with the New York Times, 'If it expires, it expires. We\u2019ll make a better deal.' Washington seeks a broader agreement including China, which refuses to negotiate, citing its smaller nuclear arsenal\u2014estimated at around 600 warheads, projected to exceed 1,000 by 2030. Experts like Pavel Podvig and Darya Dolzikova emphasize that verification is critical for trust and stability, warning that without it, the U.S. may resume deploying reserve warheads and increase its arsenal from 1,550 to approximately 3,500. Russia has developed new weapons outside the treaty\u2019s scope, such as the Burevestnik cruise missile, Oreshnik hypersonic missile, and Poseidon nuclear torpedo. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s proposed Golden Dome missile defense system is viewed by Moscow as destabilizing. Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator, warns that without a new treaty, a unregulated arms race could lead to extreme instability.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:51 AM\nSource:[AGI](https://www.agi.it/estero/news/2026-02-01/scadenza-new-start-russia-usa-35372813/)\n\n**The Era of No Nuclear Arms Treaties Begins Between the U.S. and Russia**\nStarting February 5, 2026, the United States and Russia will enter an era without any active nuclear arms control treaties, as the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty III) agreement expires.

Signed in April 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the treaty entered into force in February 2011 and was extended for five years in 2021, giving it a total duration of 15 years. It legally binds both nations to limits on strategic nuclear weapons\u2014those designed to target an adversary\u2019s core political, military, and industrial centers. The treaty aims to prevent a strategic nuclear arms race, enhance transparency, reduce the risk of miscalculation or accidental escalation, and promote global strategic stability. In February 2023, Russia suspended participation in the treaty following the Ukraine conflict, halting on-site inspections and data exchanges, though both sides have continued to observe the treaty\u2019s core numerical limits. The expiration of New START would end the last formal constraint on U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear forces, raising concerns about a potential new arms race, as both nations could increase their arsenals without restrictions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:44 AM\nSource:[INSIGHTSIAS](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2026/01/31/new-start-nuclear-treaty/)\n\n**The End of 50 Years of Nuclear Control: The Resurgence of 'Fear of the Nuclear Race'**\nThe New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the two global nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, is set to expire in five days, on February 5, 2026, without a renewal agreement. This treaty, signed in 2010, has limited the number of strategic nuclear warheads, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers held by both nations for over 50 years. Its expiration would mark the first time in half a century that the U.S. and Russia could expand their nuclear arsenals without any restrictions. According to Daria Dolzheva, a nuclear policy researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in the UK, the collapse of the treaty would eliminate critical channels for communication, mutual understanding, and strategic engagement between the two sides. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed extending the current limits on nuclear warheads for one more year, but U.S. President Trump has not yet issued an official statement. Within the U.S., there is growing pressure to abandon the treaty due to China's rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, while Russia has already developed new nuclear systems outside the treaty\u2019s scope. Prokhor T\u0435\u0432in, head of the Military-Economic Research Center at the Higher School of Economics in Russia, noted that global arms expansion is already underway, with China being the most cited example, alongside other nations increasing their strategic nuclear capabilities.

The treaty, which entered into force on February 5, 2011, limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems and includes verification mechanisms such as data exchanges, notifications, onsite inspections, and a biannual Bilateral Consultative Commission. Russia suspended its formal participation in February 2023 but stated it would continue to observe the treaty\u2019s quantitative limits. The impending expiration marks a pivotal moment for U.S.-Russia bilateral arms control and global arms control efforts. With the treaty\u2019s end, questions arise about how U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals will evolve, the implications for U.S. and global security, the future of arms control, and how strategic risks can be mitigated in an increasingly multipolar nuclear environment. To address these issues, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is hosting a discussion in its HTK Series featuring Heather Williams, director of the CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues; Tom Karako, director of the CSIS Missile Defense Project; and Kari Bingen, director of the CSIS Aerospace Security Project.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:12 PM\nSource:[Center For Strategic & International Studies](https://www.csis.org/events/new-start-expiration)\n\n**Nuclear Button Unleashed in 5 Days: World Could Revert 54 Years, 'Super War' Looms**\nAccording to News18 India, the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia is set to expire on February 5, 2026, marking the end of the last legal limitation on their deadly nuclear arsenals.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskow, warned that the treaty's expiration will create a 'serious gap' undermining global strategic stability, stating it 'hardly aligns with the interests of the peoples of our two countries and indeed the entire world.' The treaty, signed in 2010, has been a cornerstone of nuclear arms control, and despite repeated Russian proposals for renewal, the U.S. has not provided a formal response, according to Moscow.

President Vladimir Putin proposed a 12-month mutual extension, which remains pending U.S. acknowledgment. Lavrov emphasized that dedicated communication channels remain inactive, though open to dialogue, and acknowledged China's reluctance to join a trilateral agreement due to its smaller nuclear arsenal compared to Russia and the U.S. The U.S. under former President Donald Trump has demanded China's inclusion, but Beijing has rejected the proposal, citing disparities in strategic capabilities. The treaty, the last remaining agreement limiting strategic nuclear arsenals between the two superpowers, has seen verification processes continue despite mutual suspension of on-site inspections since 2022. Experts warn that failure to renew New START could trigger unchecked nuclear arms growth, undermine global non-proliferation efforts, and deepen strategic rivalry.

Will the U.S. and Russia Abandon All Nuclear Restraints?**\nThe New START nuclear arms control treaty, which limits strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 for both the United States and Russia, is set to expire on February 5, 2026, with no automatic extension. The article warns that after February 6, 2026, both nations will face no legal constraints on expanding their nuclear arsenals or enhancing their delivery systems, increasing the risk of a new global nuclear arms race. Despite prior reductions and mutual inspections under agreements like SALT-I and SALT-II, the expiration of New START removes a key safeguard against unintended or accidental nuclear war. Both countries have already invested heavily in modernizing their nuclear forces, including new ICBMs, SLBMs, and nuclear bombers, which enhance first-strike capabilities and raise the risk of precipitous escalation. China\u2019s growing nuclear arsenal, driven by perceived U.S. and Russian unrestraint, further fuels this dynamic. Even a one-year voluntary extension would be non-binding, allowing either side to withdraw at any time. The article suggests that the end of New START could trigger a return to Cold War-like tensions, eroding the sense of security from nuclear holocaust that has existed for decades. The only potential hope lies in a renewed global anti-nuclear movement akin to the Ban the Bomb campaigns of past decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 12:06 AM\nSource:[juancole.com](https://www.juancole.com/2026/01/armageddon-abandon-restraints.html)\n\n**Nuclear Countdown: The Last Chance for U.S.-Russia Arms Control Pact**\nThe New START treaty, a critical arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, is set to expire on February 5, 2026, with less than two months remaining. Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally proposed a one-year extension, but the U.S. has not yet responded. The treaty, which has been in effect since 2011, caps the number of deployable strategic nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, including missiles and bombers, to prevent nuclear escalation and maintain strategic stability. Despite its importance in reducing the risk of misunderstandings during periods of high geopolitical tension, both nations face challenges in sustaining the agreement due to ongoing nuclear modernization efforts and rising global tensions. The treaty's future has gained renewed urgency as attention shifts toward China's expanding nuclear arsenal, with experts and policymakers urging the U.S. to act swiftly to preserve arms control and global security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/3725799-nuclear-countdown-the-last-chance-for-us-russia-arms-control-pact)\n\n**Moscow Retains Right to Extend Nuclear Limits Until February 5, 2026**\nRussia reserves the right to announce an extension of the New START (Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, or START-3) arms control agreement at any time before February 5, 2026, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The statement was made on November 11, 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/55591250-moskva-ostavlyaet-za-soboy-pravo-prodlit-yadernye-ogranicheniya-v-techenie-goda/)\n\n**Putin Offers US Temporary Nuclear Control Agreement to Prevent New Arms Race**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin offered U.S. President Trump a one\u2011year extension of the New START nuclear\u2011arms\u2011control treaty, which would allow further negotiations for a five\u2011year renewal, according to Reuters.  Putin said the extension would be offered if the U.S. reciprocated, \"to prevent a new arms race\".  He described the global strategic security environment as deteriorating, citing the dismantling of Cold\u2011War\u2011era arms agreements and the fact that New START remains the only remaining major treaty.  Putin also stressed that Russia is ready to respond to any threat, noting that Russia\u2019s defensive\u2011capability plans are being developed and implemented \"in a timely and complete manner\".  The New START treaty limits deployed warheads to 1,550 and missiles to 700; it expires February 2026 unless extended.  The offer signals a positive step toward bilateral talks despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:56 PM\nSource:[Blondet & Friends](https://www.maurizioblondet.it/putin-offre-agli-stati-uniti-un-accordo-temporaneo-sul-controllo-nucleare-per-prevenire-una-nuova-corsa-agli-armamenti/)\n\n**Putin Opens to Extending Nuclear Arms Control Agreement if US Will Too**\nVladimir Putin has announced that Russia is willing to extend the New\u202fStart nuclear\u2011arms\u2011control treaty for one year beyond its current February\u202f5\u202f,\u202f2026 expiry, provided the United States is also ready to do so.  According to Reuters, Putin said this at a meeting of the Russian Security Council, adding that Russia would continue to observe the treaty\u2019s key limits of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads.  The New\u202fStart treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack\u202fObama and Dmitry\u202fMedvedev and entering into force in 2011, is the last remaining U.S.\u2013Russia arms\u2011control agreement.  In February\u202f2023, Putin had suspended Russia\u2019s participation in the treaty because he would not allow U.S. inspections of Russian nuclear facilities amid the Ukraine conflict, as reported by the AP.  The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs notes that while the treaty is not part of the European security architecture, a failure to renew it would negatively affect European security.  The proposal comes with only four months left until the treaty\u2019s current expiration, and it is contingent on U.S. willingness to extend the agreement.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:50 PM\nSource:[Berlingske Tidende](https://www.berlingske.dk/internationalt/putin-aabner-for-at-forlaenge-atomvaabenaftale-hvis-ogsaa-usa-vil)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on my comprehensive search of the latest news reports in February 2026, there is no direct information about current U.S.-Russia discussions to renew or replace the New START nuclear arms treaty before its February 5, 2026 expiration. This absence of reporting is significant given the treaty's imminent expiration and historical importance. Here's what we know:\n\n### Contextual Analysis\n1. **No Direct Evidence of Negotiations**: \n   - Despite active U.S.-Russia diplomatic engagement on other issues (e.g., Ukraine ceasefire talks [1][9]), no sources mention New START discussions.\n   - High-level contacts exist\u2014President Trump personally negotiated a 1-week pause in Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure [1][9]\u2014but these haven't extended to nuclear arms control.\n\n2. **Broader Geopolitical Barriers**:\n   - **NATO Fragmentation**: Transatlantic trust has eroded over Ukraine, Greenland sovereignty disputes, and defense spending tensions [3][4][7]. European officials openly question U.S. reliability, complicating unified Western positioning toward Russia [3][5][7].\n   - **Russia's Military Posture**: Russia continues aggressive weapons exports ($15B+ in 2025 [10]) and signals no concessionary stance via its Ukraine actions [1][6][9].\n   - **U.S. Diplomatic Focus**: The Trump administration appears prioritized on Ukraine mediation and trade disputes with Europe [1][5][9], not nuclear treaty renewal.\n\n3. **Conflicting Strategic Priorities**:\n   - European leaders advocate for reduced U.S. military dependence [4][5], while Russia leverages divisions through energy/security pressure [2][9].\n   - U.S. satellite and command-control dominance (critical for NATO) remains unchallenged [7][8], but Moscow benefits from alliance disunity.\n\n### Critical Limitations\n- **No Treaty-Specific Reporting**: All sources focus on Ukraine, NATO, or unrelated topics (e.g., Trump\u2019s domestic proposals [1]).\n- **Time Sensitivity**: With just 4 days until expiration, the lack of updates suggests either secrecy or stagnation in talks.\n- **Potential Information Gaps**: Russian-language sources were included [2][6][10], but key U.S./Russian outlets may have unreported details due to the search's 24-hour recency constraint.\n\n### Conclusion\nAs of February 1, 2026, **there are no public indications of active U.S.-Russia negotiations to extend or replace New START**. The diplomatic landscape is dominated by Ukraine conflicts and NATO instability, with both powers seemingly deprioritizing nuclear arms control. Without last-minute breakthroughs, the treaty will likely expire, potentially triggering a new arms race. For definitive assessment, access to classified diplomatic channels or later-breaking news would be essential.  \n\n**Sources**:  \n- U.S.-Russia Ukraine ceasefire talks [1][9]  \n- NATO credibility crisis [3][4][7]  \n- European defense autonomy debates [4][5][7]  \n- Russia's military exports [10]  \n- Technical limitations of European security without U.S. support [7][8]\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
