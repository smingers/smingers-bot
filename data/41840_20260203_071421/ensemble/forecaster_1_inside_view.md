Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**ABS Labour Force Statistics (December 2025) - Official Release:**
Highest quality primary source. Reports trend employment increased 24,800 (0.2%) to 14,686,100 in December 2025. Contains data quality warning about November 2025 collection challenges. Critically, the summary provided does NOT include the specific seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December 2025, though it references both trend and seasonally adjusted estimates exist.

**Roy Morgan Research (December 2025):**
Alternative methodology using "real" unemployment (10.4%), not seasonally adjusted. Michele Levine's opinions about government spending and productivity are editorial commentary. **Not directly comparable to ABS seasonally adjusted figures** - this is a different measurement entirely. Low relevance for this forecast.

**FXStreet (21 January 2026) - December 2025 Data Release:**
High quality, timely source. **Key factual data: December 2025 unemployment rate was 4.1%** (down from 4.3% in November). Employment change +65.2K vs -28.7K in November. Participation rate 66.7%. Sean Crick (ABS official) confirms 15-24 year olds drove employment gains. This is the most critical data point.

**Oxford Economics (Key Themes 2026):**
Minimal Australia-specific content. Identifies "inflation versus RBA, public versus private demand" tensions but provides no unemployment forecasts. Low utility.

**InDaily/BDO (2 February 2026):**
Anders Magnusson (BDO Chief Economist) provides global context but no specific Australian unemployment forecasts. Notes Australia is "deeply dependent on global growth" - factual but not actionable for February forecast.

**KPMG Economic Outlook:**
No specific unemployment rate forecasts provided in the summary. GDP forecasts show 2.0-2.1% growth for 2026-2027. Missing the key labor market predictions.

**AskNews Articles (February 2026 - RBA Rate Decision):**

*ABC/WSLS/NEOS KOSMOS (3 Feb 2026) - RBA Rate Hike:*
**Critical breaking news:** RBA raised cash rate 0.25% to 3.85% on 3 February 2026. Multiple sources confirm December 2025 unemployment was 4.1%. RBA forecasts unemployment rising to 4.6% by mid-2028. Core inflation projected at 3.2% end-2026. Cherelle Murphy (EY) notes unemployment drop from 4.3% to 4.1% suggests economy "running too hot." **This is strong evidence the labor market was tight entering February.**

*Perth Now (3 Feb 2026) - RBA Forecasts:*
RBA forecasts unemployment at 4.6% by June 2028. Notes unemployment was 4.1%, "below prior forecast," indicating "less spare capacity." Real wages projected to fall 0.9% to June 2025. **The RBA's surprise at the 4.1% figure suggests February could remain low.**

*Herald Sun (3 Feb 2026) - Pre-RBA Decision:*
Notes December unemployment at 4.1%. Divided expert opinions: Shane Oliver (AMP) and Ron Hodge argue inflation is temporary "blip"; Warren Hogan (EQ Economics) warns delaying rate action risks deeper downturn. Strong employment data cited as justification for hike.

*AAStocks (2 Feb 2026) - January 2026 Job Ads:*
**January 2026 job advertisements rose 4.4% month-on-month**, highest since February 2022. ANZ economist Aaron Luk notes this partially offset 2H 2025 slowdown. References December employment increase of 65,200 and unemployment drop to 4.1%. **Strong leading indicator for February labor market.**

*Morningstar (1 Feb 2026) - Manufacturing PMI:*
January 2026 manufacturing PMI at 52.3 (up from 51.6), fastest growth in five months. New orders rising, employment and purchasing at historically high rates. **Suggests economic momentum continuing into early 2026.**

*Historical Context (Sept-Oct 2025):*
September 2025: unemployment rose to 4.5% (highest since Nov 2021). October data not explicitly stated but multiple sources reference stability around 4.2-4.3% in that period. November confirmed at 4.3%. **This shows December's 4.1% represented a significant reversal.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (large prediction shifts warranted):**

1. **December 2025 unemployment at 4.1%** - Multiple independent sources (ABS official, FXStreet, RBA statement, multiple news outlets). Direct measurement of the variable we're forecasting. This is the strongest anchor point.

2. **December employment surge (+65.2K)** - Confirmed by ABS and multiple sources. Well above expectations (+30K). Shows labor market strengthening, not weakening, entering 2026.

3. **January 2026 job advertisements up 4.4%** - Leading indicator from ANZ-Indeed data. Highest level since Feb 2022. Strong causal mechanism: more job ads → more hiring → lower unemployment in near term.

4. **RBA surprise at labor market tightness** - Multiple officials noting unemployment "below prior forecast" and "less spare capacity than assessed." The central bank being surprised by strength suggests continued tightness likely.

**Moderate Evidence (moderate prediction shifts):**

1. **Manufacturing PMI expansion (52.3 in Jan 2026)** - Single reliable source (S&P Global). Logical link: manufacturing growth → employment demand. Three consecutive months of expansion suggests momentum.

2. **Participation rate rising (66.7%)** - Could push unemployment up if employment doesn't keep pace, but December showed both rising participation AND falling unemployment - suggests robust demand.

3. **RBA rate hike (3 Feb 2026)** - Tightening monetary policy typically increases unemployment with 6-12 month lag. Too recent to affect February data significantly, but signals RBA confidence in labor market resilience.

**Weak Evidence (small adjustments only):**

1. **Seasonal patterns** - Limited specific Jan→Feb historical data provided. General post-holiday adjustment possible but magnitude unclear.

2. **Roy Morgan "real unemployment" at 10.4%** - Different methodology, not seasonally adjusted. Anecdotal for predicting ABS figures.

3. **Long-term RBA forecasts (4.6% by mid-2028)** - Too distant to inform February 2026 prediction. Speculative trajectory.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 
- Today: 3 February 2026
- Target: February 2026 unemployment rate
- Resolution: 19 March 2026 (44 days away)
- **Effective window: We're predicting the month we're currently in - only 25 days of labor market activity remain**

**If timeframe halved (predicting mid-February):**
Would increase confidence in 4.1% outcome, as only ~12 days of data would remain. Less time for any reversal of December trends. Would narrow distribution significantly (perhaps 90/10 range of 4.0-4.2%).

**If timeframe doubled (predicting March 2026):**
Would incorporate more uncertainty about:
- RBA rate hike effects beginning to materialize
- Seasonal normalization post-summer
- Potential mean reversion from December's strong showing
Would widen distribution (perhaps 90/10 range of 3.8-4.5%) and shift median slightly upward toward 4.2%.

**Critical insight:** The extremely short remaining window (3 Feb → end Feb = 25 days) means most of February's outcome is already "baked in." Major shifts are unlikely unless there's an immediate shock.

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view established:** 
- Central tendency: 4.0-4.2% (40th-60th percentiles)
- 90/10 range: 3.9-4.4%
- Median: ~4.1-4.15%

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD shift (toward lower unemployment):**

1. **January job advertisements surge (+4.4%)** - This is a strong leading indicator occurring in the month immediately preceding our target. Historical relationship between job ads and employment is well-established. This suggests February hiring may continue December's momentum.

2. **Manufacturing expansion accelerating** - January PMI at 52.3, fastest in 5 months, with employment component at "historically high rates." This is current-month data directly relevant to February.

3. **RBA's repeated surprise at labor market strength** - When the central bank consistently underestimates labor market resilience, it suggests structural factors (perhaps immigration-driven demand, infrastructure spending) maintaining tightness.

**Factors warranting UPWARD shift (toward higher unemployment):**

1. **Seasonal normalization** - December's 4.1% may include holiday hiring effects that reverse in January-February. However, the job ads data suggests this isn't materializing.

2. **Mean reversion from September spike** - Unemployment spiked to 4.5% in September, then fell to 4.1% by December. Some reversion toward the 4.2-4.3% range seen in August-November is plausible.

3. **Very short historical base at 4.1%** - December 2025 is the only recent month at 4.1%. The "normal" range in 2H 2025 was 4.2-4.3%. Regression to that mean is statistically likely.

**Net assessment:**
The strong January leading indicators (job ads, manufacturing) occurring in real-time provide compelling evidence that December's strength is continuing into early 2026, not reversing. However, the extremely short window (25 days) limits how much change can occur. 

**I judge the evidence supports a modest downward shift from the outside view baseline.** The outside view suggested 50th percentile around 4.1-4.15%; I'll revise this to 4.1% flat as the median, with slightly tighter confidence intervals reflecting the short remaining window.

However, I'll maintain meaningful tail risk: 
- Lower tail (10th percentile): Could reach 3.9% if January's momentum continues strongly
- Upper tail (90th percentile): Could reach 4.3% if seasonal effects or measurement volatility push upward

The 90/10 confidence interval narrows from 3.9-4.4% to 3.9-4.3%, reflecting the short remaining window reducing uncertainty.

## Probability Calibration

**Anchoring on December 2025:** 4.1%

**Central scenario (40th-60th percentiles): 4.0-4.1%**
- Most likely outcome: February remains at or very near December's 4.1%
- January job ads surge supports continued strength
- Manufacturing expansion confirms momentum
- Only 25 days remaining limits potential change
- Median: 4.1%

**Lower tail scenario (10th-20th percentiles): 3.9-4.0%**
- Requires: Continued strong hiring through February
- Probability: ~15-20%
- Supporting factors: Job ads at 2-year high, manufacturing accelerating
- Constraint: Hard to fall much below 4.0% in one month from 4.1%

**Upper tail scenario (80th-90th percentiles): 4.2-4.3%**
- Requires: Seasonal reversal or measurement volatility
- Probability: ~15-20%
- Supporting factors: Historical mean was 4.2-4.3% in 2H 2025
- Constraint: Would need immediate weakening not evident in January data

**Extreme tails:**
- 1st percentile (3.8%): Requires extraordinary continued improvement - very unlikely in 25 days
- 99th percentile (4.5%): Would require sudden deterioration or major shock - possible but unlikely given January indicators

**Distribution shape:** Roughly symmetric around 4.1%, slightly right-skewed (easier to tick up than down from tight levels)

**Uncertainty sources:**
- ABS measurement error: ±0.1pp
- Seasonal adjustment uncertainty: ±0.1pp  
- Remaining 25 days of labor market activity: ±0.1-0.2pp
- Unexpected shocks: Low probability in short window

**Final calibrated distribution:**
- Tighter than outside view due to short remaining window
- Centered on 4.1% based on December baseline + January leading indicators
- 90% confidence interval: 3.9% to 4.3% (narrower than outside view's 3.9-4.4%)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate (%) for Australia in February 2026, per ABS Labour Force statistics.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 4.1-4.15% median, 3.9-4.4% 90/10 range. Final prediction maintains 4.1% median, narrows to 3.9-4.3% range given short window and January leading indicators.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 4.1%; mean ≈ 4.1%; aligns with December baseline + January job ads surge + manufacturing expansion + only 25 days remaining.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - December 2025 unemployment was 4.1% (ABS official, multiple sources) ✓
   - January 2026 job advertisements +4.4%, highest since Feb 2022 (ANZ-Indeed) ✓
   - January 2026 manufacturing PMI 52.3, employment at historic highs (S&P Global) ✓
   - RBA surprised by labor market tightness, unemployment "below forecast" (RBA statement 3 Feb) ✓
   - Only 25 days remain in February - limited time for major change ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A sudden major employer announcing large-scale layoffs in early February (e.g., major mining company, retail chain) could push unemployment up toward 4.3-4.4%. This would make the forecast look too optimistic. Direction: UPWARD.
