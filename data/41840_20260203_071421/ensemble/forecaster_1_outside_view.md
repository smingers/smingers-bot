Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**ABC News (22 Jan 2026) - December 2025 Jobs Data:**
High-quality source. Reports official ABS data showing unemployment fell to 4.1% in December 2025 from 4.3% in November. Contains multiple named expert opinions:
- Brendan Rynne (KPMG): Factual assessment that data was "stronger than expected"
- Harry Murphy Cruise (Oxford Economics): Opinion that absent rising unemployment, rate hike may be needed
- Stephen Smith (Deloitte): Opinion predicting rates will eventually move downward

**Trading Economics (Feb 2026):**
Aggregator site with moderate quality. Confirms December 2025 unemployment at 4.1%. Provides forecast of 4.3% by end of Q1 2026 (March 2026) from their macro models. Historical context shows average of 6.53% (1978-2025), recent low of 3.4% (Oct 2022).

**Roy Morgan Research (Dec 2025):**
Alternative methodology (not seasonally adjusted). Reports higher "real" unemployment of 10.4%. CEO Michele Levine's opinions about productivity and government spending are editorial commentary, not expert labor market forecasting. Less relevant for predicting ABS seasonally adjusted figures.

**CBA Newsroom (Jan 2026):**
High-quality bank economist analysis. Belinda Allen (Head of Australian Economics) notes unemployment fell to 4.1% in December and early signs of labor market tightening. Factual observation that economy has "more momentum than RBA anticipated." No specific February 2026 forecast provided.

**ABC Business Experts (4 Jan 2026):**
Notes November 2025 unemployment was 4.3%, RBA target around 4.4%. Expresses concern about potential deterioration but provides no specific February forecast. More editorial than analytical.

**Capital Economics (25 Sep 2025):**
Outdated (5+ months old). Notes Q2 2025 bounce-back and expects RBA to move to neutral stance. Limited relevance for February 2026.

**Agent Report:**
Identifies critical data gaps: missing monthly ABS data for Jan 2024-Jan 2026 series, and missing explicit RBA/bank forecasts for 2026. This confirms we're working with incomplete information.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Month-to-month changes in Australian unemployment (recent period 2024-2026):**
   - Available data: Nov 2025 (4.3%) → Dec 2025 (4.1%), a -0.2pp drop
   - Limited data points make this less reliable

2. **Australian unemployment during post-pandemic normalization (2022-2026):**
   - Pattern: Rose from 3.4% (Oct 2022) to 4.3% (Nov 2025), gradual upward drift
   - Feb 2026 falls within this normalization period
   - Most suitable reference class given current economic conditions

3. **Seasonal patterns in Australian unemployment (Jan-Feb transitions):**
   - Would be ideal but lacking specific historical Jan→Feb data
   - Generally, post-holiday period can see modest increases

4. **RBA inflation-fighting cycles:**
   - When RBA maintains restrictive policy, unemployment typically drifts upward
   - Current context: inflation at 3.4%, above 2-3% target

**Selected reference class:** Post-pandemic normalization period (2022-2026), given the current economic environment of gradual labor market cooling from historically tight conditions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 
- Today: February 3, 2026
- Target month: February 2026
- ABS release date: March 19, 2026 (44 days from now)
- Effective prediction: What unemployment rate will be measured for the month we're currently in

**Key temporal considerations:**

1. **Very short horizon:** We're predicting the current month's outcome, which means most of February's labor market activity will have already occurred by mid-month.

2. **Recent trajectory:**
   - December 2025: 4.1% (sharp -0.2pp drop from November)
   - November 2025: 4.3%
   - October 2025: 4.3% (from earlier agent searches)
   - August 2025: 4.2%
   
3. **Monthly volatility:** The Dec→Nov movement shows unemployment can move ±0.2pp month-to-month, but the longer trend from Aug-Nov was relatively stable around 4.2-4.3%.

4. **Seasonal factors:** January-February typically sees post-holiday labor market adjustments. The December drop to 4.1% may partially reflect seasonal hiring that could reverse.

5. **Economic momentum:** Multiple sources note the economy has "more momentum than expected" and labor market is "tighter than anticipated," suggesting downward pressure on unemployment may persist.

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Base rate considerations:**

The most recent official data point (December 2025: 4.1%) serves as the strongest anchor. However, several factors warrant consideration:

**Factors suggesting stability/slight decrease (toward 4.0-4.1%):**
- Strong employment growth in December (+65,000 jobs)
- Rising participation rate (66.7%)
- Economy showing more momentum than RBA expected
- CBA notes "early signs of labor market tightening"
- Very short prediction window limits major changes

**Factors suggesting slight increase (toward 4.2-4.3%):**
- December's 4.1% may include seasonal effects that reverse in Jan-Feb
- Trading Economics forecasts 4.3% by end Q1 2026
- RBA target is around 4.4%, suggesting policy settings aim for modest increases
- Historical pattern shows gradual drift upward from 3.4% (2022) toward 4.3% (Nov 2025)
- Post-holiday period can see upticks

**Volatility assessment:**
- Monthly changes typically ±0.1-0.2pp
- Larger swings (±0.3pp or more) are rare but possible
- December showed -0.2pp change, suggesting some volatility

**Expert expectations:**
- Trading Economics: 4.3% by end Q1 (March 2026)
- RBA: targeting "around 4.4%" for stabilization
- No explicit February forecasts from major banks

**Most likely scenario:** Given we're predicting the current month with very limited time for major changes, and December showed a stronger-than-expected labor market, February is likely to remain close to December's 4.1%, with modest risk of mean-reversion toward 4.2-4.3% as seasonal effects normalize.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring on December 2025 baseline:** 4.1%

**Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles):**
Given the short timeframe and recent data, I expect February to cluster tightly around 4.0-4.2%, with 4.1% as the modal outcome. The 50th percentile should be near 4.1-4.15%.

**Lower tail (10th percentile):**
Requires sustained strong employment growth. Given December's momentum, 3.9% is plausible but represents an optimistic scenario. Below 3.8% would require extraordinary improvement unlikely in one month.

**Upper tail (90th percentile):**
Requires reversal of December trends or seasonal weakness. The Nov 2025 level of 4.3% represents a reasonable upper bound for normal variation. Going to 4.4% or higher would require significant deterioration, possible but less likely given recent momentum.

**Distribution shape:**
Slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) because:
- Easier for unemployment to tick up from tight levels than continue falling
- RBA policy settings aim for modest increases
- Seasonal normalization could push upward

**Accounting for uncertainty:**
- Data measurement error: ±0.1pp
- Unexpected economic shocks: low probability in 1-month window
- Seasonal adjustment uncertainty: ±0.1-0.2pp

**90/10 confidence interval:** 3.9% to 4.4%
This 0.5pp range captures ~90% of likely outcomes while acknowledging measurement and economic uncertainty.
