Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Historical ABS data (December 2025):**
- **Factual:** Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December 2025 (from 4.3% in November), employment rose 65,200, participation rate 66.7%
- **Quality:** Highest quality - official government statistics
- **Date:** Released January 21, 2026 (13 days ago)

**RBA Statement on Monetary Policy (February 3, 2026):**
- **Factual:** RBA raised cash rate to 3.85%, forecasts unemployment at 4.6% by June 2028
- **Expert opinion:** RBA projects core inflation at 3.2% end-2026, cites "tighter capacity constraints" and "labour market slightly tight"
- **Quality:** Authoritative - central bank official forecast
- **Date:** Today (February 3, 2026)

**Recent news articles (February 1-3, 2026):**
- **Factual:** Multiple sources confirm rate hike to 3.85%, inflation at 3.8% (December 2025)
- **Expert opinions:** 
  - EY's Cherelle Murphy: economy "running a little bit too hot," another hike possible
  - CBA, ANZ, Westpac: view hike as "one and done"; NAB forecasts second hike in May
  - PIMCO's Adam Bowe: current rate already restrictive
- **Quality:** Mixed - major banks and economists, credible but divergent views
- **Date:** Very recent (past 3 days)

**Historical context (2025 data):**
- September 2025: 4.5% (highest since November 2021)
- October-November 2025: 4.3%
- December 2025: 4.1%
- Pattern shows volatility around 4.1-4.5% range

**Roy Morgan data:**
- Uses different methodology ("real" unemployment 10.4%)
- **Not comparable** to ABS seasonally adjusted series - disregard for this forecast

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
1. **December 2025 baseline of 4.1%** - Official ABS data, most recent hard number (released 13 days ago)
2. **RBA tightening cycle initiated** - Rate hike today signals policy shift, though labour market impact takes 6-12 months
3. **Historical volatility pattern** - 2025 showed monthly swings of 0.2pp (Nov→Dec: -0.2pp; Aug→Sep: +0.2pp)

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **Leading indicators mixed** - Job advertisements rose 4.4% in January (4-year high) but this reflects demand, not realized employment
2. **Participation rate at record 66.7%** - High participation can push unemployment up if employment growth doesn't keep pace
3. **RBA forecasts gradual rise** - Central bank projects 4.6% by mid-2028, implying slow upward drift
4. **Manufacturing PMI expansion** - January PMI at 52.3 suggests continued economic momentum

**Weak evidence:**
1. **Seasonal effects** - January typically shows rebound in job ads (historical pattern), but February survey timing may differ
2. **Bank economist divergence** - "One and done" vs. further hikes debate shows uncertainty about economic trajectory
3. **Inflation concerns** - 3.8% inflation may constrain hiring, but effect on February data minimal

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction horizon:** 46 days from today (February 3) to resolution (March 19, when February data released)
- February labour force survey conducted: February 2-16, 2026
- Data reflects employment status during survey week

**If timeframe halved (23 days - mid-February):**
- Would be forecasting January 2026 data (not yet released)
- Likely similar to December (4.1%) with possible slight uptick to 4.2% due to typical January patterns
- Less uncertainty, tighter distribution around 4.0-4.3%

**If timeframe doubled (92 days - early May):**
- Would be forecasting April 2026 data
- Rate hike effects begin emerging, though still early
- Greater uncertainty: wider distribution 3.9-4.8%
- RBA's second potential hike (May) could be factored into expectations

**(d) Justification for Prediction Shift**

**Outside view baseline:** 4.25% (μ), σ ≈ 0.18%

**Adjustments needed:**

1. **December starting point lower than expected (4.1% vs. 4.3%):** This is a hard data point only 13 days old. The question asks for February, which is just one month ahead. The recent drop suggests near-term momentum slightly lower than the 4.25% baseline.

2. **Job advertisements surge (+4.4% in January):** This is a leading indicator pointing to continued labour demand. However, ads don't always translate immediately to employment, and the effect on unemployment rate depends on participation changes.

3. **RBA rate hike timing:** The February 3 hike will have negligible impact on February labour market data (survey week Feb 2-16). Monetary policy operates with 6-12 month lags.

4. **Historical pattern:** December showed a -0.2pp drop. January typically sees some rebound. February could settle between December (4.1%) and the Q1 average forecast of 4.3%.

**Revised assessment:**
- The December 4.1% reading is stronger than expected
- January job ads suggest continued momentum
- But participation at record levels creates upward pressure
- February likely settles at 4.1-4.3% range, with central tendency around 4.2%

**Adjusting distribution:**
- Shift mean down slightly to 4.2% (from 4.25%)
- Keep σ at 0.18% to reflect monthly volatility
- Allow for tail risks: downside to 3.7% (continued strength), upside to 4.7% (participation surge)

Probability Calibration:

Given:
- Last reading: 4.1%
- Historical monthly σ: ~0.13-0.15pp
- Macro uncertainty: moderate (rate hike just occurred, but effects delayed)
- Time horizon: one month ahead

**Central scenario (60% probability):** 4.1-4.3%
- December's 4.1% was strong; January likely similar or slight uptick
- February could stay flat or rise modestly to 4.2-4.3%

**Downside scenario (20% probability):** 3.7-4.0%
- Continued employment strength
- Participation stabilizes or dips slightly
- Job ads translate to actual hiring

**Upside scenario (20% probability):** 4.4-4.7%
- Participation continues rising faster than employment
- Some employment softening emerges
- Statistical volatility (survey sampling)

**Extreme tails (<5% each):**
- Below 3.7%: Requires exceptional employment surge
- Above 4.7%: Requires sharp employment contraction or participation spike

This yields a distribution centered at 4.2%, with 80% confidence interval of roughly 4.0-4.4%, and 90% interval of 3.9-4.5%.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate (%) for Australia, February 2026, per ABS Labour Force statistics

2. **Outside view base rate:** 4.25% with σ ≈ 0.18%, established from recent 12-month patterns

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ 4.2%; mean ≈ 4.2%; aligns with December baseline (4.1%) plus modest upward drift expected in Q1-26

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - December 2025 actual: 4.1% (hard data, 13 days old)
   - January job ads: +4.4% m/m (leading indicator, positive)
   - Participation rate: 66.7% record high (upward pressure on unemployment)
   - RBA rate hike: 3.85% (minimal February impact due to lags)
   - Historical volatility: ±0.2pp typical monthly swing

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A sharp January employment contraction (similar to November's -28.7k surprise) combined with continued participation growth could push February unemployment to 4.5-4.6%, making my forecast look too optimistic. This would push the outcome UP.
