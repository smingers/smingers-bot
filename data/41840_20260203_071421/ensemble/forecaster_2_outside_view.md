Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**ABC News (Jan 22, 2026) - Jobs Data Article:**
High-quality, recent source reporting official ABS December 2025 data. Key facts: unemployment fell to 4.1% (from 4.3% in November), 65,000 jobs added, participation rate 66.7%. Named experts include Brendan Rynne (KPMG), Harry Murphy Cruise (Oxford Economics), Stephen Smith (Deloitte). Expert opinions diverge on rate implications but consensus on stronger-than-expected labor market.

**Trading Economics (Feb 2026):**
Reliable aggregator of official statistics. Confirms December 2025: 4.1% unemployment. Provides forecast of 4.3% by end Q1 2026 (March), 4.4% for 2027. Historical context: average 6.53% (1978-2025), record low 3.4% (Oct 2022).

**Roy Morgan Research (Dec 2025):**
Alternative unemployment measure using broader definition (10.4% "real" unemployment vs ABS 4.1%). While interesting, this is a different methodology than the ABS seasonally adjusted rate that resolves the question. Shows labor market softening with full-time employment down 174,000 year-over-year. Michele Levine (CEO) opinion on sluggish market and inflation concerns.

**CBA Newsroom (Jan 2026):**
Major bank analysis. Belinda Allen (Head of Australian Economics) expects RBA rate hike to 3.85% due to inflation at 3.4% and unemployment at 4.1%. Notes economy has "more momentum than anticipated" and labor market showing early tightening signs.

**ABC Business Outlook (Jan 5, 2026):**
Context piece noting unemployment at 4.3% (November data), up from 3.4% low in Oct 2022. RBA target around 4.4% for inflation control. Historical average 6.3% (1993-2020). Limited forward-looking analysis.

**Capital Economics (Sept 25, 2025):**
Older source (5 months old), limited detail due to paywall. Notes Q2 2025 bounce-back, expects RBA neutral stance. Less relevant given age.

**Agent Report:**
Identifies critical data gaps: missing monthly ABS data points from Jan 2024-Jan 2026, and specific numeric forecasts from RBA and major banks for 2026. This confirms we're working with incomplete historical series but have recent confirmed data points.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Australian unemployment month-to-month changes (recent period 2024-2025):**
   - Most suitable for short-term prediction
   - We have: Nov 2025 (4.3%), Dec 2025 (4.1%)
   - Recent trend shows modest volatility but relative stability around 4.1-4.3%

2. **Post-pandemic labor market normalization (2022-2026):**
   - From record low 3.4% (Oct 2022) to current 4.1%
   - Shows gradual upward drift of ~0.7pp over 3+ years
   - Relevant as we're still in this normalization phase

3. **Historical Australian unemployment volatility:**
   - Average 6.53% (1978-2025), but recent structural shift to lower rates
   - Less relevant due to changed labor market dynamics

**Selected reference class:** Recent 2024-2025 monthly changes, contextualized within post-pandemic normalization trend. February 2026 is only 2 months from December 2025 data point.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** February 2026 is approximately 2 months from the last data point (December 2025). The question opened Feb 3, 2026, meaning February data will be collected during February and released in March 2026.

**Historical patterns:**
- December to February typically shows seasonal patterns, though we're examining seasonally adjusted data
- Recent monthly changes: Nov→Dec showed -0.2pp decline (4.3%→4.1%)
- Longer trend: gradual upward drift from 3.4% (Oct 2022) averaging ~0.2pp per year
- Month-to-month volatility appears modest (±0.2pp typical)

**Key considerations:**
- Strong December employment (+65,000 jobs) suggests momentum
- Participation rate rising (66.7%), indicating labor supply growth
- RBA likely hiking rates in February, which typically dampens employment with lag
- Trading Economics forecasts 4.3% by end Q1 2026 (March), implying February around 4.2-4.3%

## (d) Justification

The most recent confirmed data shows unemployment at 4.1% (December 2025), down from 4.3% (November). This represents a stronger-than-expected labor market with robust job creation (65,000 jobs) and rising participation.

For February 2026 (2 months ahead), several factors suggest modest upward pressure:
1. **Mean reversion:** The 4.1% represents the lowest since May 2025; some drift back toward 4.3-4.4% range is likely
2. **Trading Economics forecast:** Explicitly predicts 4.3% by end Q1 2026
3. **RBA tightening:** Expected rate hike to 3.85% will dampen activity with short lag
4. **Seasonal factors:** Even with adjustment, early-year patterns may show slight loosening
5. **Expert consensus:** RBA targets "around 4.4%," suggesting policy framework accepts drift to that level

However, momentum factors provide downside risk:
- Strong December job creation may persist into January-February
- Rising participation hasn't yet translated to higher unemployment
- Economy showing "more momentum than anticipated" (CBA)

**Base case:** February unemployment likely in 4.1-4.3% range, with central tendency around 4.2%. The strong December print suggests inertia, but mean reversion and policy tightening suggest modest upward drift is more likely than further decline.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring to established distributions:**
- Recent range: 4.1% (Dec) to 4.3% (Nov, Aug)
- Trading Economics Q1 forecast: 4.3%
- RBA medium-term target: ~4.4%

**Distribution shape considerations:**
1. **Central tendency:** 4.2% represents modest upward drift from 4.1%
2. **Downside (lower unemployment):** Limited by strong recent floor at 4.1%; structural factors make sub-4.0% unlikely in 2-month timeframe
3. **Upside (higher unemployment):** More tail risk due to potential policy impact, but 2-month timeframe limits dramatic moves

**Historical volatility:**
Month-to-month changes rarely exceed ±0.3pp in recent stable period. This suggests:
- 90% confidence interval should span roughly 0.6-0.8pp
- Extreme outcomes (below 3.8% or above 4.6%) are very unlikely in 2 months

**Rate of upsets:**
Australian unemployment has been relatively predictable in recent years, with gradual trends rather than sharp breaks. However, COVID period showed data can surprise. Conservative approach: allow 10-15% probability mass in tails beyond ±0.3pp from central estimate.

**Calibration logic:**
- P10 (3.9%): Represents continued strong momentum, ~0.2pp below December
- P20 (4.0%): Modest continued strength
- P40 (4.1%): Status quo persistence
- P60 (4.2%): Modest mean reversion (central case)
- P80 (4.3%): Return to November level
- P90 (4.5%): Faster-than-expected softening

This distribution centers on 4.15-4.2%, slightly above current 4.1%, reflecting balance between momentum and mean reversion, with symmetric tails accounting for uncertainty.
