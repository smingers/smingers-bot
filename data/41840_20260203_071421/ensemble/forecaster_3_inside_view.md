Analysis:

### 1) Target variable / resolution check
Forecast the **ABS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Australia in February 2026**, in percent, as released in the ABS Labour Force publication (released March 2026).

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **ABS Labour Force “latest release” page (Dec 2025)**  
- **Quality/date:** Highest-quality primary source; December 2025 labour force release (published Jan 2026).  
- **Facts used:** The meta-warning that **Nov–Dec 2025 movements require caution** due to operational challenges and survey modernization. This argues for **wider uncertainty bands** than usual.  
- **Limits:** The excerpt provided here omits the SA unemployment number, but other sources below report it as 4.1% for Dec.

2) **FXStreet (Jan 21, 2026) summarizing ABS Dec 2025 labour force**  
- **Quality/date:** Secondary but timely; generally reliable on headline macro prints.  
- **Facts used:** **Dec 2025 SA unemployment 4.1%**, employment +65.2k, participation 66.7%.  
- **Opinions:** Market color about AUD; not used much.

3) **AskNews/ABC (Feb 3, 2026) on RBA Statement of Monetary Policy scenarioing**  
- **Quality/date:** High-quality media; same-day; cites RBA material.  
- **Facts used:** RBA scenario: unemployment **rising only gradually** to ~4.6 by mid-2028 (directional).  
- **Opinions:** “Horror scenario” framing and some economist commentary about “one and done” hikes—useful but treated as **speculative**.

4) **AskNews/WSLS + Neos Kosmos + others (Feb 3, 2026) reporting RBA hike to 3.85%**  
- **Quality/date:** Mixed outlets; but the **rate hike itself is a solid fact** corroborated across multiple reports.  
- **Facts used:** RBA **raised cash rate 25 bps to 3.85% on Feb 3**; reasoning includes stronger demand and labour market tightness.  
- **Opinions:** Bank/economist takes on “one-time vs more hikes” not directly decisive for Feb unemployment (policy lags).

5) **Morningstar (Feb 1, 2026) S&P Global Manufacturing PMI**  
- **Quality/date:** Reasonably reliable for PMI reporting.  
- **Facts used:** PMI expansion and comments about output and employment components—**supports ongoing activity**, but PMI→unemployment mapping is loose.

6) **AAStocks (Feb 2, 2026) ANZ-Indeed job ads up 4.4% m/m**  
- **Quality/date:** Tertiary writeup; underlying ANZ-Indeed series is credible, but “seasonal interference” caveat matters.  
- **Facts used:** Job ads rebound suggests **labour demand not collapsing**; however, the author explicitly warns seasonal adjustment distortions may be present.

7) **Roy Morgan (Dec 2025) “real unemployment” 10.4%**  
- **Quality/date:** Credible survey house, but **not the ABS concept**; levels not comparable.  
- **Use here:** As a weak signal that parts of the labour market feel softer (full-time down YoY), but I **downweight heavily** for this resolution.

### (b) Evidence analysis with weights (drivers of Feb 2026 SA unemployment)

**Strong evidence (moves forecast meaningfully):**
- **Dec 2025 ABS SA unemployment = 4.1%** (multiple sources citing ABS headline). This is the best anchor for a 1–2 month-ahead forecast.  
- **RBA tightened policy on Feb 3 (3.85%)** and described conditions as relatively tight/strong demand. The *direction* suggests not much slack yet, but the *timing* means limited impact on February’s labour force outcome (policy lags).

**Moderate evidence (nudges forecast):**
- **ANZ-Indeed job ads rebound**: consistent with labour demand holding up; suggests downside risk to unemployment (i.e., staying low).  
- **PMI expansion**: consistent with continued activity; modest support for low unemployment.

**Weak evidence (small adjustments / mostly for uncertainty):**
- **Roy Morgan “real unemployment”** (different definition).  
- **ABS caution about data collection challenges**: doesn’t say level is wrong, but increases the chance of **measurement noise** month-to-month → widen tails.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **2026-02-03**. Outcome month: **February 2026**; data released **March 2026**.  
- Effective horizon from last hard datapoint (Dec 2025 at 4.1%) to Feb outcome is ~2 months.
- If the horizon were **halved** (forecasting Jan 2026 instead), I’d compress the distribution toward 4.1–4.3 more tightly.  
- If the horizon were **doubled** (forecasting Apr/May 2026), I’d shift the median slightly upward (policy tightening + growth normalization) and widen tails more.

### (d) Justification: inside-view adjustments vs outside-view base rates
**Outside-view baseline provided:** centered around **~4.2** for Feb 2026 (with 10th~3.9, 90th~4.5).

**Inside-view updates from new information (since that outside view):**
- **RBA hiked today** and is explicitly worried about demand/inflation persistence. That tends to be associated with a labour market that is still relatively tight now (supports **unemployment staying near 4.1–4.3** in the near term), while also implying some **later** softening. For *February specifically*, the immediate effect is mostly signaling rather than realized labour-market deterioration.  
- **Job ads + PMI** point to activity and hiring intentions holding up, again pushing against a near-term spike in unemployment.  
- **Data-quality caution** pushes me to **widen** the uncertainty band modestly (higher chance of a noisy print).

Net: I keep the central tendency **near 4.2**, with slightly **fatter tails** than I’d normally use for a 2-month horizon.

Probability calibration:

- Status quo / inertia: Dec was 4.1; absent a shock, Feb likely 4.1–4.3.  
- Upside (higher unemployment) paths: participation jumps; hiring slows after strong Dec; survey noise; post-hike sentiment hit (small for Feb).  
- Downside (lower unemployment) paths: continued strong hiring, participation dips, or continued tightening in labour market.

Checklist:
1) Target: ABS **seasonally adjusted unemployment rate**, **February 2026**, units %.  
2) Outside view base rate used: median-ish **4.2** (from provided outside-view distribution).  
3) Consistency: implied median ≈ 4.2; mean ≈ 4.23; yes—matches “low but slightly drifting/uncertain” story.  
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Dec 2025 SA unemployment **4.1** (ABS headline via multiple secondary reports).
   - RBA **raised rates to 3.85** on Feb 3 and cites tight-ish conditions (near-term low unemployment).
   - ANZ-Indeed job ads rebound (labour demand not collapsing).
   - ABS warns about recent collection challenges (wider noise tails).
5) Blind spot: A **large participation surge** (or a one-off survey/seasonal adjustment artifact) could push unemployment **up** more than expected.
