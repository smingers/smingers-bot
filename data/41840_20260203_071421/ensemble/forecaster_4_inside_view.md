Analysis
1. Source analysis (chronological, key facts only)

a. ABS Labour Force, Dec-2025 (FXStreet 21 Jan 2026) – Primary data, very high quality. Facts: unemployment 4.1 %, employment +65 000, participation 66.7 %.  
b. RBA Statement of Monetary Policy, 3 Feb 2026 (ABC, PerthNow) – High quality. Facts: cash-rate hike to 3.85 %, central scenario has unemployment drifting to 4.6 % by mid-2028.  
c. ANZ-Indeed Job Ads, Jan-2026 (AAStocks 2 Feb 2026) – Medium-high quality leading indicator. Facts: ads +4.4 % m/m, back to Aug-2025 level.  
d. S&P-Global PMI, Jan-2026 (Morningstar 1 Feb 2026) – Medium quality. Facts: Manufacturing PMI 52.3, employment sub-index expanding.  
e. Roy Morgan “real” unemployment, Dec-2025 (18 Jan 2026) – Different methodology, low direct relevance.  
f. Market consensus page (Trading Economics, 3 Feb 2026) – Model/consensus composite, medium quality. Forecast: 4.3 % by end-Q1 2026.

All other articles are commentary on (b); they supply opinions (economists, banks) that labour market is “a bit too tight” after the 4.1 % print.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong • ABS December figure 4.1 %. • Historical month-to-month volatility c. 0.10–0.15 pp (structural, persistent).  
Moderate • RBA central forecast implies slow drift upward (adds ≈0.02 pp per quarter short-term). • ANZ job-ads rebound (+4.4  %) signals continuing demand.  
Weak • Roy Morgan alternative series (structural gap to ABS). • Immediate effect of 25 bp rate hike (lagged). • PMI expansion (sectoral, volatile).

Net pull: December surprise tightness (down) vs gentle mean reversion (up) ≈ small upward tilt.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Today 3 Feb 2026; February labour-force survey conducted 2nd & 3rd weeks of the month; result released 19 Mar 2026 (≈6 weeks). Halving horizon (3 weeks) would raise weight on January data (unknown yet) and shrink uncertainty; doubling horizon (3 months) would enlarge policy/ macro risk tails and widen distribution ≈ +0.1 pp either side.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base-rate (median) after a 4.1 % reading is 4.3 % (Trading Economics / recent RBA track).  
Shifters:  
+0.1 pp Seasonal bounce normally lifts SA unemployment Jan–Feb relative to Dec.  
–0.05 pp Job-ads & PMI suggest demand still solid.  
≈0 Rate hike effect negligible within 1 month.  
Net median 4.3 %; 80 % range 4.0–4.5 %. Tails widened for possible data quirks or survey collection issues (ABS flagged for Nov/Dec).

Probability calibration
Mean ≈4.32 %, median 4.3 %. SD (implicit) ≈0.25 pp. 90 % CI 3.8–4.8 %.

Checklist
1. Target: ABS seasonally-adjusted unemployment, February 2026, percent.  
2. Base rate anchored at 4.3 % (recent consensus / historical drift).  
3. Implied median 4.3; mean 4.32 – consistent with slight right-tail.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Dec ABS 4.1, (ii) historic 0.1 pp monthly noise, (iii) RBA forecasts drift up, (iv) Job-ads rebound, (v) fresh rate hike lag.  
5. Blind-spot: January data prints a shock ≥0.4 pp move (survey volatility), pushing Feb far in same direction (downside 3.7 % or upside 5 %).
