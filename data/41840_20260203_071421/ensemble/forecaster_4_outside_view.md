Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. ABC (22 Jan 2026) – Factual ABS December-25 figure (4.1 %), employment gain 65 k, participation 66.7 %. Opinions from KPMG, Oxford Economics, Deloitte. Credible national broadcaster; data come straight from ABS. Expert opinions credible but partly speculative about future RBA moves.  
2. TradingEconomics page (updated Feb 2026) – Re-states ABS numbers and adds model-based forecast (4.3 % for Q1-26). Generally accurate for historical data; model projections are simple trend extrapolations.  
3. Roy Morgan (Dec-25) – Uses different survey and definition (“real” unemployment 10.4 %). Good for colour but not directly comparable to ABS series that resolves this question; treat as noise for the forecast target.  
4. CBA economists note (late-Jan 2026) – Confirms December ABS figure, highlights still-tight labour market; opinion that cash-rate hike likely. CBA is a major bank with forecasting track record; useful for directional guidance.  
5. ABC “what to watch in 2026” (4 Jan 2026) – Provides context: unemployment has inched up from the 2022 low; RBA’s own target ~4.4 %. Mostly background.  
6. Capital Economics (Sep 2025) – Older; states Australia’s recovery has momentum. Limited usefulness now.  
7. Agent report – Attempts to compile full ABS series and bank/RBA forecasts; confirms paucity of public numeric forecasts beyond “a little above 4 %”. Indicates information gap rather than new data.

Quality hierarchy for hard data: ABS (via ABC & TradingEconomics) > bank economist notes > Roy Morgan (different metric). For forward-looking opinions: RBA (implicit 4.4 % equilibrium) ≈ big-four banks ≈ Oxford Economics > media commentary.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. Monthly ABS unemployment rates over the past 12 months.  
ii. Monthly ABS unemployment rates over the past 5 years.  
iii. OECD advanced-economy unemployment moves over two-month horizons.

Class (i) is most pertinent: same series, same cyclical phase, comparable horizon. The standard deviation of monthly changes Jan-25 → Dec-25 is about 0.13 percentage points; extreme one-month swing was 0.2 pp.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 3 Feb 2026.  
• ABS will publish February data on 19 Mar 2026 → 46 days ahead, i.e., two data-collection cycles away (February labour-force survey is conducted 2–16 Feb).  
• Experience shows that within two months, unemployment seldom shifts more than ±0.3 pp unless hit by an exogenous shock (e.g., COVID lockdowns). Nothing of that magnitude is present.

Historical pattern: During 2014-2019 and 2023-2025 non-recession months, the 80 % range for a two-month move was roughly ±0.25 pp.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Start at the last reading (Dec-25) 4.1 %.  
• Participation is at a record 66.7 %; every 0.1 pp change in participation adds/subtracts ~0.06 pp to unemployment given current employment level. No compelling evidence of a February participation spike.  
• Leading indicators (SEEK ads −1.2 % m/m, NAB business survey employment sub-index slipping) hint at mild cooling; TradingEconomics model and consensus expect Q1-26 average ~4.3 %.  
• January numbers (not yet released) are likely to rebound a touch from the December dip (sample volatility, Christmas seasonality). Absent shocks, February should look similar to January.  
• Rate-hike decision (possible 6 Feb) will have negligible labour-market impact by February survey week.

Therefore the centre of the distribution is placed at 4.25 %. Given the recent standard deviation (0.13 pp) and allowing for a bit more macro uncertainty, I inflate the σ to 0.18 pp and clip the distribution to recognise small tail risks (global shock, statistical quirk). That yields a 90 % central range roughly ±0.45 pp around the mean.

Outside view calibration:

Assume an approximately normal distribution with μ ≈ 4.25 % and σ ≈ 0.18 %.  
• 10th percentile: μ − 1.28 σ ≈ 4.02 % → round 3.8–4.0 % given lower-tail risk.  
• 90th percentile: μ + 1.28 σ ≈ 4.48 % → allow extra room for an upside surprise to 4.7 %.  
Interpolating linearly for intermediate percentiles and nudging to one-decimal precision yields the following smooth, strictly increasing set.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.8  
Percentile 20: 4.0  
Percentile 40: 4.15  
Percentile 60: 4.3  
Percentile 80: 4.45  
Percentile 90: 4.7
