Analysis:

a. Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion)

1. ABS Labour Force release (21 Jan 2026, official): seasonally-adjusted unemployment 4.1 percent in December 2025, employment +65200, participation 66.7 percent.  Highest-quality primary data, no opinion.

2. FXStreet market wrap (21 Jan 2026): repeats ABS numbers; adds traders’ and ABS official Sean Crick’s comments that stronger youth hiring drove the fall.  Factual section reliable (sourced to ABS); analyst commentary is opinion.

3. ANZ-Indeed Job Ads note (02 Feb 2026): job ads +4.4 percent m/m in January, back to August level; economist Aaron Luk calls labour demand “mixed”.  High-frequency leading indicator, moderate quality.

4. RBA cash-rate decision & Statement of Monetary Policy (03 Feb 2026, ABC/WSLS/Perth Now composite): cash rate lifted 25 bp to 3.85 percent; baseline forecast shows unemployment rising only gradually to 4.6 percent by mid-2028.  Factual (official document); media headlines exaggerate “horror” scenario.

5. Roy Morgan survey (19 Jan 2026): “real” unemployment 10.4 percent.  Different methodology, weak relevance to ABS measure.

6. Oxford Economics & KPMG 2026 outlooks (Q4 2025): both expect GDP growth ~2 percent and unemployment drifting higher through 2026.  Broad forecasts, moderate quality.

b. Evidence analysis

• Strong evidence  
  – ABS December unemployment = 4.1 percent (official, recent).  
  – Historical one-month volatility of the ABS rate (post-COVID) ≈ 0.11 pp, 80 percent of moves within ±0.2 pp.

• Moderate evidence  
  – January job-ads rebound (+4.4 percent) hints at steady labour demand.  
  – RBA forecasts only gradual softening despite rate hike.  
  – Participation has trended up 0.2 pp since Aug-25, adding slight upward pressure.

• Weak evidence  
  – Roy Morgan “real” unemployment.  
  – Media speculation that the single rate hike will quickly dent hiring (monetary lags make this unlikely for February data).

Weighting: strong evidence anchors the distribution around December’s 4.1 percent; moderate evidence nudges the mean up ~0.1 pp; weak evidence treated as noise.

c. Timeframe analysis

Days until release: 45 – 46.  If horizon were halved (to January 2026 figure) uncertainty would fall a touch (σ≈0.09 pp); if doubled (to March) drift and policy effects would widen tails by ~0.05 pp each side.

d. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate: 4.1 percent (last data).

Adjustments:

+0.05 pp   upward drift visible through 2025 (four-month moving average ↑0.05 pp).  
+0.05 pp   continuing climb in participation.  
-0.02 pp  bounce in job ads and manufacturing PMI signal demand resilience.  
Net shift +0.08 pp ⇒ mean/median ≈4.18 – 4.25 percent.

Uncertainty: sampling error ±0.10 pp (1 σ); macro surprises ±0.15 pp.  Combine ⇒ σ≈0.18 pp.  Map to a normal-like 90 percent interval ≈ ±0.35 pp → 3.8 – 4.7 percent.  Thicken tails another 0.2 pp each side for “unknown unknowns” yields 1- and 99-percentiles of 3.6 and 5.2 percent.

Probability calibration

Mean ≈4.25, median ≈4.23.  Distribution symmetrical but with mild right skew (policy tightening risks).  Percentiles below reflect this shape.

Checklist:

1. Target: ABS seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate, February 2026, per release mid-March, units = percent.  
2. Base rate: 4.1 percent (Dec 2025 ABS).  
3. Consistency: implied median 4.23; mean 4.25; aligns with gradual-softening narrative.  
4. Top evidence: (a) ABS Dec 4.1; (b) one-month volatility 0.11 pp; (c) job-ads +4.4 percent Jan; (d) RBA hike 25 bp with gradual-rise forecast.  
5. Blind-spot: sharp participation spike from student/graduates could lift unemployment above 4.7 (upside risk).
