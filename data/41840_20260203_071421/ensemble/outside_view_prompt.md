# Summary of Article: "Rate hike expectations jump after jobs data comes in 'stronger' than expected"

**Source:** ABC.net.au  
**Date:** January 22, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Unemployment Rate:** Fell from 4.3% to 4.1% in December 2025 (seasonally adjusted figures from ABS)

2. **Employment Growth:** 65,000 employed people added in December
   - Full-time employment: +55,000
   - Part-time employment: +10,000

3. **Participation Rate:** Rose to 66.7%

4. **Gender Breakdown:**
   - Male employment: +49,000
   - Female employment: +17,000

5. **Age Demographics:** The unemployment rate decline was partly driven by 15-24 year-olds moving into employment

6. **Job Ads (Seek data):**
   - Positions on offer fell 3.5% over 2025
   - National job ads fell 1.2% in December

## Named Expert Opinions:

1. **Brendan Rynne (KPMG Chief Economist):** Described the figures as "quite significantly stronger" than expected, showing "a much stronger labour market than any of us had anticipated"

2. **Sean Crick (ABS Head of Labour Statistics):** Noted that younger people (15-24 year-olds) entering employment contributed to the rise in overall employment and fall in unemployment rate

3. **Harry Murphy Cruise (Oxford Economics Australia, Head of Economic Research):** 
   - Expected unemployment to rise, but "the jobs market is digging in its heels"
   - Stated: "Absent our forecast rise in unemployment, an interest rate hike may be needed to tame the resurgence of inflation"
   - Added: "We won't jump on one data point, but the odds of a rate hike are rising. Next week's inflation data will be the deciding factor"

4. **Stephen Smith (Deloitte Access Economics Partner):**
   - Said the economy was too weak to handle a rate increase
   - Predicted the next move in rates would be downward
   - Called the February RBA decision "lineball"
   - Stated: "Deloitte Access Economics remains of the view that a dispassionate and considered RBA will stay on hold in February"

5. **Blair Chapman (Seek Senior Economist):** Noted the December job ad decline was "slightly steeper than the usual seasonal drop before the Christmas and New Year break"

## Interest Rate Implications:

- **Before jobs data release:** Bloomberg data showed most economists forecast no change to interest rates at the February 3 RBA meeting, with futures markets expecting just 25% chance of a hike to 3.85%

- **After jobs data release:** The chance of a hike at the next meeting jumped to 53.8% (Reuters data)

- **Longer-term expectations:** Futures market pricing in an increase to 4% by November 2026

# Summary of Article: RBA Expected to Lift Cash Rate to 3.85%

**Source:** Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) economists analysis

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Expected Cash Rate Increase:** The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to increase the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% at its next meeting

2. **Inflation Data:**
   - Trimmed mean inflation (RBA's preferred measure) rose 0.9% in the December quarter
   - Annual trimmed mean inflation: 3.4% over the year
   - Both results are slightly higher than the RBA had expected

3. **Labor Market:**
   - Unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December
   - Employment continued to rise
   - Early signs of labor market tightening for employers

4. **Household Consumption:**
   - More resilient than expected
   - Growing by an estimated 2.8% over the year

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Belinda Allen, Head of Australian Economics at CBA:**
- "The latest inflation data confirms that price pressures, while easing, are still too high"
- "The accumulation of evidence supports our view that a cash rate hike is needed to ensure inflation returns to the midpoint of the target band by the end of 2027"
- "These areas of strength suggest the economy has more momentum than the Reserve Bank anticipated just a few months ago"

## Analysis:
CBA economists indicate that domestic momentum and the latest inflation reading are expected to tilt the RBA's decision towards an increase in the official cash rate.

**Note:** This article does not have a visible publication date in the extracted content, though context suggests it relates to an upcoming RBA meeting following December quarter data.

# Summary of Article: "Inflation, tariffs, EVs: What the ABC's business experts are watching in 2026"

**Source:** ABC.net.au  
**Date:** January 4, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Australian Unemployment:

1. **Current Unemployment Rate (November 2025):** 4.3%

2. **Historical Context:**
   - Australia's unemployment rate reached a 50-year low of 3.4% in October 2022
   - The rate has been "slowly grinding higher for the last three years"

3. **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Target:**
   - The RBA believes unemployment will need to settle around 4.4% for inflation to be under control
   - Between 1993 and early 2020, the unemployment rate averaged 6.3%

## Expert Opinions and Analysis:

**From Business Editor (likely Michael Janda):**
- Notes that economists point out 4.4% unemployment is "still low by modern historical standards"
- If unemployment keeps rising and other measures of "spare capacity" in the labor market (underemployment, youth unemployment, etc.) keep deteriorating, "the RBA's hopes of 'locking in' the hard-won employment gains from the COVID lockdowns may blow away with the wind"
- Expresses concern: "But what are they going to do?" regarding the trajectory of unemployment in 2026

**RBA's Position:**
- If inflation can settle back inside the 2-3% target range and unemployment stays around 4.4%, the RBA will consider this "a win"

## Additional Context:
The article primarily focuses on inflation and interest rates as the key economic indicators for 2026, with unemployment mentioned as a secondary concern tied to the labor market's overall health.

<Agent_report>
Query: Please fetch ABS seasonally adjusted unemployment rates Jan 2024 – Jan 2026 and summarise RBA & major bank forecasts for unemployment in 2026.
The material returned by the most-recent web search is still not sufficient to satisfy either component of the user’s request.

1. ABS seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates, January-2024 to January-2026  
   • Only one official monthly observation – December-2025, 4.1 per cent – can be confirmed in the new hits (ABS “Labour Force, Australia, December 2025”, 22 Jan 2026).  
   • Earlier ad-hoc searches had located August-2025 (4.2 %) and October-2025 (4.3 %) in ABS media releases, but the underlying time-series file (series ID A84423060) has still not been opened; therefore 22 of the required 25 monthly data points remain missing.  
   • Two large blocks of text that look like labour-market tables were returned in the latest crawl, but they are from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, not the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and are therefore irrelevant to the Australian series being sought.  
   • Conclusion: Without direct access to ABS Data-Explorer or the pre-formatted spreadsheets that accompany each monthly publication, it is still impossible to compile the full January-2024 → January-2026 run of seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates.

2. Forecasts for the unemployment rate in 2026  
   Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  
   • No Statement on Monetary Policy later than February-2025 appears in the result set. The February-2025 “In Brief” note repeats that unemployment is “expected to increase slightly … but stabilise a little above 4 per cent”, and the November-2025 SMP (located earlier) said “around 4½ per cent” for end-2026; however, the definitive February-2026 SMP table that normally carries the numeric December-2026 forecast is still missing.  
   • Hence the precise RBA baseline figure for 2026 cannot yet be quoted.

   Major commercial banks  
   • Westpac Economics page (updated 2 Feb 2026) is reachable, but none of the linked PDFs is indexed, and no 2026 unemployment number is visible in the page text.  
   • NAB: a corrupted PDF (“What to Watch”, 12 Dec 2025) was captured but is unreadable; no forecast can be extracted.  
   • ANZ: nothing in the results carries a 2026 labour-market forecast.  
   • CBA: newsroom articles in January-2026 describe the labour market as “slightly tight” and say the unemployment rate is “expected to stay near current levels through 2026” (CBA Wage & Labour Insights, Jan-2026) but give no number.  
   • Therefore none of the four major-bank forecasts requested (Westpac, NAB, ANZ, CBA) is yet available in numeric form.

Summary of remaining gaps  
A. 22 of the 25 monthly ABS unemployment rates between Jan-2024 and Jan-2026.  
B. The numeric RBA forecast for December-2026.  
C. Explicit 2026 unemployment-rate forecasts from Westpac, NAB, ANZ and CBA.

Because these gaps are material, targeted follow-up searches are still required.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
