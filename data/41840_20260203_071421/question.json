    "description": "After bottoming out at 3.5% and remaining stable for several months, Australia's unemployment rate has started experiencing significant fluctuations. The Janurary 2024 unemployment rate was reported as a \"quite sharp\" rise, to 4.1% ([ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-15/unemployment-abs-labour-force-data-january-2024/103470154)), a 2-year high. The February 2024 unemployment rate, which dropped to 3.7%, was regarded as a suprise and the result of \"a larger-than-usual number of people in December and January who had a job that they were waiting to start or return to\" ([ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-21/unemployment-jobs-february-2024/103614048)).\n\nThe [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/) (ABS) collects data on the labour force in Australia, \"the labour market activity of Australia's resident civilian population aged 15 years and over\". This data is released monthly, including the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. The [methodology](https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/labour-force-australia-methodology/), [latest release](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release), and a [listing of all releases](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/) are published on the ABS website.\n\nIn Feburary 2024, the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://www.rba.gov.au/) published its quarterly [Statement on Monetary Policy](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2024/feb/contents.html), giving an assessment that \"labour market conditions are easing, but are still tight relative to full employment\". Additionally, a panel of 31 economists have forecast that unemployment to rise \"to 4.3% throughout 2024, and then to stay at about that level through 2025\" ([The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/mortgage-and-inflation-pain-to-ease-but-only-slowly-how-31-top-economists-see-2024-218927)).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":22134,\"question_id\":40310}}`",
