Analysis:
The key to judging the February-2026 unemployment rate is to understand how quickly the Australian labour market has been loosening since its 3.5 % trough in mid-2023.  Important context I will look for:

• The actual ABS seasonally-adjusted unemployment figures from Jan-2024 through the latest available (Dec-2025 or Jan-2026, if released).  
• Whether the rate is still tracking the ≈4¼ % plateau that many economists (RBA, private banks, “Conversation-31”, etc.) expected for 2025, or if it has begun to trend above that level because of weaker growth and the RBA’s 2023-24 monetary tightening.  
• Forward-looking clues: RBA Statements on Monetary Policy (Aug-25, Nov-25, Feb-26), Treasury MYEFO 2025-26, private bank forecasts, and recent business-survey hiring intentions.  
• Any one-off factors that could distort Feb-2026 (e.g., seasonal pattern from school-holiday jobs, changes in ABS population benchmarks, major weather events, etc.).

Establishing the recent monthly path (e.g., 4.2 % in Oct-25 → 4.4 % in Nov-25 → 4.6 % in Dec-25?) will give an outside-view base rate and allow an extrapolation to February.  Evidence that vacancies are still falling faster than employment, or that participation has peaked, would tilt expectations higher than 4½ %; evidence of renewed jobs growth would do the opposite.  Therefore the most relevant historical data to collect first are the ABS Labour Force publications for the past 12-18 months and the latest RBA/market forecasts issued after the December-2025 data release.
