(February 2026)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Nightmare on Martin Place as RBA outlines horror interest rates scenario**\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) released its quarterly Statement of Monetary Policy on February 3, 2026, outlining a starkly divergent economic outlook. While the economy ended 2025 in strong shape\u2014with GDP growth at 2.3% (up from a forecast of 2.0%), a robust jobs market, and stronger-than-expected household consumption and business investment\u2014the outlook for 2026 and beyond is grim. If market expectations for two or more additional rate hikes materialize, the RBA forecasts a sharp economic downturn: GDP is projected to fall to 1.8% by year-end 2026 and 1.6% by mid-2027, household consumption to drop from 3.1% to 2.1%, and unemployment to rise steadily to 4.6% by mid-2028. Underlying inflation is expected to remain at 3.2% at the end of 2026\u2014above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target\u2014and only reach the comfort zone by early 2028. The RBA attributes much of the recent inflation surge to non-demand-driven factors like durable goods, food, and holiday travel prices, suggesting rate hikes may have limited impact. The forecasts rely on market-based interest rate expectations, creating a circular logic that undermines reliability. Australia\u2019s high sensitivity to rate changes stems from its reliance on variable-rate mortgages and expensive real estate; unlike the U.S., where 30-year fixed rates dominate, Australian households feel rate changes immediately. Some economists suggest the RBA may implement only one rate hike\u2014'one and done'\u2014as the threat of further hikes could be enough to cool spending and prevent further tightening. The RBA emphasized that 'the good news ends there,' underscoring the precariousness of the current economic trajectory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:52 AM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-03/rba-decision-to-raise-interest-rates-horror-scenario-outlined/106300520)\n\n**Australia's central bank raises interest rate to 3.85% after 3 cuts**\nAustralia's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), raised its benchmark cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.85% on February 3, 2026, marking its first rate hike since November 2023. This follows three consecutive rate cuts in 2025, including reductions in February, May, and August. The decision comes amid rising inflation, which reached 3.8% for the 12 months ending December 2025\u2014up from 3.4% in November\u2014and is now seen as likely to remain above the RBA\u2019s target range of 2% to 3% for some time. The bank cited strong private demand driven by household spending and investment as key inflationary pressures. Treasurer Jim Chalmers described the move as 'difficult news' for mortgage holders and businesses, rejecting claims that government spending is fueling inflation. EY Oceania Chief Economist Cherelle Murphy noted the surprise of the rate hike just six months after the last cut, stating that while the prior cut seemed justified at the time, inflation has since rebounded. She also highlighted a drop in the unemployment rate from 4.3% in November to 4.1% in December, suggesting the economy may be 'running a little bit too hot,' and said another rate hike later in 2026 cannot be ruled out.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:34 AM\nSource:[WSLS](https://www.wsls.com/business/2026/02/03/australias-central-bank-raises-interest-rate-to-385-after-3-cuts/)\n\n**Blow to borrowers with about-face interest rate hike**\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% in a unanimous decision on February 3, 2026, becoming the first major central bank to reverse course from post-COVID rate cuts and initiate rate hikes. This move followed inflation rising above the RBA\u2019s 2\u20133% target band, with data showing stronger-than-expected labour force participation, consumer spending, and inflationary pressures in the second half of 2025. The board stated that private demand is growing faster than anticipated, capacity constraints are tighter than previously assessed, and the labour market is slightly tight, justifying the rate increase. The decision marks a significant shift from the RBA\u2019s earlier strategy of maintaining lower rates longer to avoid unemployment spikes. Despite expectations\u2014financial markets assigned a 75% probability to a hike\u2014some economists argued for waiting on further data, citing softening monthly inflation and a strong Australian dollar. Domain\u2019s chief economist Nicola Powell warned the hike would reduce housing market momentum by lowering borrowers\u2019 purchasing power. A $600,000 mortgage holder would face an estimated $90 monthly repayment increase if lenders pass on the full rise. In updated forecasts, core inflation is now projected at 3.2% by end-2026, up from 2.7% in November. RBA Governor Michele Bullock\u2019s post-meeting press conference will be closely watched for signals on future rate moves. Treasurer Jim Chalmers acknowledged the hardship for mortgage holders, emphasizing that inflation pressures stem from private demand, not government spending. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however, urged government spending cuts, arguing that rising public expenditure fuels inflation, higher interest rates, and future tax pressures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:25 AM\nSource:[NEOS KOSMOS](https://neoskosmos.com/en/2026/02/03/news/australia/blow-to-borrowers-with-about-face-interest-rate-hike/)\n\n**RBA Raises Interest Rates for First Time in Three Years Amid Inflation Pressure**\nOn February 3, 2026, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike, raising the cash rate to 3.85%, marking its first increase since November 2023 and the first monetary policy meeting of the year. The RBA stated that inflation may remain above target for some time and that financial conditions, while previously loosened, are uncertain in their restrictive nature. The central bank emphasized its commitment to price stability and full employment, stating it will take necessary measures to achieve these goals. The decision follows economic overheating and elevated inflation, making Australia the first major central bank to raise rates since Japan. Unemployment has reached a 50-year low. Bond traders have shifted from expecting rate cuts to anticipating hikes over the past two months. PIMCO Australia\u2019s portfolio manager Adam Bowe stated that the current cash rate is already restrictive and will help bring inflation back to the 2%\u20133% target range over time. Finder data shows that a 500,000 AUD mortgage holder would pay an additional 79 AUD monthly (948 AUD annually), while a 1,000,000 AUD borrower would pay 158 AUD more monthly (1,896 AUD annually). Treasurer Jim Chalmers acknowledged the difficulty this decision brings to households and businesses, noting that the RBA\u2019s statement explicitly attributed inflation to private demand, not government spending. He defended the government against criticism, including the opposition\u2019s sarcastic term 'Jimflation.' Roy Morgan data indicates that a 25-basis-point rate hike would put 41,000 mortgages at risk and affect 1.228 million borrowers. All four major banks had predicted the 0.25% hike, with ANZ, Westpac, and CBA viewing it as a one-time move, while NAB forecasts a second hike in May.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:39 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/2/3/n14689952.htm)\n\n**Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank Raises Rates for First Time in Three Years Amid Inflation Pressure**\nOn February 3, 2026, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.85%, marking its first interest rate hike since November 2023 and the first of the year.

Bond traders shifted from expecting rate cuts to betting on hikes over the past two months. PIMCO\u2019s Adam Bowe stated that the current cash rate is already restrictive and will gradually reduce demand and bring inflation back to the 2%\u20133% target range.

Despite raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, the RBA forecasts core inflation will only reach 2.6% by June 2028\u2014still above its 2.5% target\u2014up from a previous forecast of 2.7% in November, now expected to be 3.2% by the end of 2026. The RBA cited stronger-than-expected economic performance, including robust household consumption, business investment, and housing market activity, as well as a lower unemployment rate of 4.1% (below the prior forecast), indicating less spare capacity in the economy. These factors, combined with temporary influences like goods price volatility and domestic travel, are contributing to elevated inflation. Real wages are projected to fall by 0.9% in the year to June 2025\u2014worsening from the previous forecast of a 0.5% decline\u2014marking the end of eight consecutive quarters of real wage growth. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.6% by June 2028, and GDP growth is forecast to be lower than previously estimated beyond June 2026 due to higher cash rate assumptions. The RBA stated that 'elevated capacity pressures are consistent with the recent pick-up in inflation, though less persistent sector-specific factors are assumed to explain most of the recent inflation surprise.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:59 AM\nSource:[Perth Now](https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/business/grim-forecasts-for-aussie-inflation-and-unemployment-c-21513949)\n\n**Aussie dollar jumps ahead of RBA call**\nThe Australian dollar rose to US69.71 cents ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) critical interest rate decision on February 3, 2026, following a strong run that saw it reach a three-year high near US71 cents. Market expectations favored a 25 basis point rate hike to 3.85%, with money markets assigning a 75% probability to such an action. Analysts are divided: some, like AMP\u2019s Shane Oliver and InvestSmart\u2019s Ron Hodge, argue inflation is a temporary 'blip' driven by transitory factors, citing falling electricity prices, a stronger Australian dollar reducing import costs, labor market uncertainty from AI, and the risk of 'policy whiplash' if rates are tightened too quickly. Conversely, economists such as Commonwealth Bank\u2019s Luke Yeaman and CreditorWatch\u2019s Ivan Colhoun emphasize rising trimmed mean inflation (3.3% over 12 months to December 2025), a strengthening economy, and strong employment data (unemployment down to 4.1%) as justification for a hike. EQ Economics\u2019 Warren Hogan warned that delaying action risks a deeper economic downturn. If rates rise, mortgage holders face significant financial strain: an average borrower on a $693,802 loan would pay $1,313 more annually; those with $500,000 debt would pay $79 more monthly; and $1 million borrowers would pay $158 more monthly. Roy Morgan data suggests 41,000 additional mortgages could be 'at risk' under a rate hike, with 1.228 million borrowers feeling the financial pinch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:24 AM\nSource:[Herald Sun](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/economy/reserve-bank-to-decide-on-rate-rise-amid-fears-of-higher-mortgage-repayments/news-story/45f390ecdf3f5bf665e263bff00508b8)\n\n**Australia's January ANZ Total Job Advertisements Rise 4.4% Month-on-Month, Hit Four-Year High**\nAccording to ANZ-Indeed data, Australia's total job advertisements rose by 4.4% month-on-month in January 2025, marking the highest level since February 2022 and surpassing the revised previous month's figure of a 0.8% decline. ANZ economist Aaron Luk stated that the January increase partially offset the gradual slowdown observed in the second half of 2025, bringing the job advertisement series back to approximately the level seen in August 2025. He noted that seasonal interference may have influenced the January data, as the final week of 2025 could have affected seasonal adjustments. Nevertheless, Luk emphasized that labor demand rebounding at the start of the year is not uncommon, citing historical data showing a 6.2% monthly increase in January 2019 and a 3.9% rise in January 2017. He explained that the January rebound followed Australia's December employment increase of 65,200 people and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. However, overall in 2025, ANZ still views the labor market as 'mixed,' with the unemployment rate returning to its\u5e74\u521d level and employment and working hours growth remaining relatively weak, with annual growth rates around 1%. The bank does not believe December's data signals a significant tightening of the labor market in the near term.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:27 AM\nSource:[AAStocks.com](https://www.aastocks.com/share/news/fx/NOW.1500427?ntype=1&lang=chi)\n\n**Australian Manufacturing Upswing Gathers Pace**\nAustralia's manufacturing sector recorded a third consecutive monthly expansion in January 2026, with the seasonally adjusted S&P Global Australia manufacturing purchasing manager's index rising to 52.3 from 51.6 in December\u2014the fastest growth in five months. This expansion was driven by a solid increase in new orders, including a rise in international business. The data supports broader economic momentum, fueled by strong consumer spending, high employment, rising business investment, and elevated government spending. Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, noted that manufacturing output growth accelerated to match the long-term trend, while employment and purchasing activity increased at historically high rates. She also stated that the new orders and future output indices indicate continued output growth in the coming months. This economic strength coincides with speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will raise interest rates, aiming to counter renewed inflationary pressures that threaten to push inflation above its 2% to 3% target, following a rate cut in August 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:58 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/20260201789/australian-manufacturing-upswing-gathers-pace)\n\n**Unnecessary interest rate cuts derailed the national housing affordability project**\nThe article argues that the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate cuts in 2025 undermined national housing affordability efforts. Despite unemployment remaining below the RBA\u2019s full employment threshold of 4.3\u20134.5%, the RBA cut rates in February 2025, leading to an 8.6% rise in the national median house price\u2014more than double the income growth. This increase was driven by a $264 monthly reduction in mortgage repayments from rate cuts, which was outweighed by a $363 rise in repayments due to higher house prices. The article notes that net permanent and long-term arrivals reached 476,070, increasing demand. The RBA\u2019s actions, while intended to support inflation and employment, directly boosted house prices, contradicting government efforts under the National Housing Accord to improve affordability. The author criticizes the RBA for undermining affordability despite having no formal mandate to do so, contrasting it with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s explicit goal of raising house prices to benefit homeowners. The article also highlights that inflation data showing a 3.8% annual rise was skewed by a 24.4% jump in international travel and accommodation, while the seasonally adjusted monthly increase was only 0.2% (2.4% annualized), suggesting inflation is not out of control. Despite market predictions of two rate hikes in Australia in 2026, the author believes a hike tomorrow may not occur. The RBA\u2019s two mandates\u2014price stability and full employment\u2014ultimately converge on inflation control, but the article asserts that monetary policy\u2019s most direct impact is on house prices, which are central to household wellbeing. The author concludes that the RBA\u2019s rate cuts were unnecessary and counterproductive, effectively derailing the national housing affordability project.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:48 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-02/rba-interest-rate-hikes-housing-affordability-inflation/106292572)\n\n**Australia Jobless Rate Lowest in 7 Months | Forex News 2026.01.22 (en)**\nAustralia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December 2025, down from 4.3% in November and below the projected 4.4%, marking the lowest level since May 2025. The number of unemployed individuals decreased by 29,800 to 628,600, reaching a seven-month low. Of these, those seeking full-time work dropped by 21,400 to 421,700, and those seeking part-time work declined by 8,400 to 206,800. Employment rose by 65,200, reaching a record high of 14.68 million\u2014surpassing the projected 30,000 increase and recovering from a revised 28,700 decline in November. Full-time employment increased by 54,800 to 10.10 million, while part-time jobs rose by 10,400 to 4.58 million. The labor force participation rate edged up to 66.7% from 66.6% in November, falling short of the estimated 66.8%. The underemployment rate decreased to 5.7% from 6.2% in November. Total monthly hours worked increased by 8 million, reaching 2,001 million hours.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 01:14 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2874040)\n\n**Australia's November Employment Numbers Drop Unexpectedly, 9-Month High Decline; Unemployment Rate Holds Steady**\nAustralia's seasonally adjusted employment numbers for November decreased by 23,100 compared to October, marking the largest decline in nine months, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This result contrasted with market expectations of a 20,000 increase and followed a strong 41,200 increase in October. Full-time employment fell by 56,500, while the year-on-year growth in employment slowed to 1.3%, below the population growth rate of 2%. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.3%, slightly below the expected 4.4%. The labor force participation rate declined from 66.9% to 66.7%, and average working hours remained unchanged. Oxford Economics' lead economist, Hallie Murphy-Cruze, noted that part of the decline may reflect a temporary rebound after October's strong gain, but emphasized that the underlying trend indicates a gradual slowdown in the labor market. This weakening data may reduce the likelihood of an imminent interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Australian dollar fell 0.1% to US$0.6667, and the Australian 3-year bond futures rose 9 ticks to 95.85. Swap market pricing reflects a 23% probability of a rate hike in February 2026 and approximately 70% probability in May 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 02:37 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/world/2025/12/581286.php)\n\n**What a surprise spike in the unemployment means for interest rates and the economy**\nAustralia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 4.3% in August to 4.5% in September 2025, the highest level since November 2021 and the tenth consecutive month above 4%. This unexpected increase strengthens the case for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut the official cash rate in November. The RBA's mandate includes achieving 'the maximum level of employment consistent with low and stable inflation,' but current unemployment is well above any credible estimate of full employment. Employment growth has slowed significantly in 2025, with an average of only 12,900 new jobs per month compared to 33,900 job seekers, while employment growth in 2024 averaged 32,600 per month. The decline in employment is not due to reduced growth in the non-market sector (such as government services, NDIS, and childcare), which continues at previous rates, but rather due to a drop in the market sector, where private employers are cutting back on hiring amid perceived weaker economic conditions. Additional indicators include a decline in monthly hours worked (from 0.27% in 2024 to 0.04% in 2025), a slowdown in job creation (351,600 in 2024 vs. 44,100 in first half of 2025), and a rise in underemployment from 9.9% to 10.4%. According to Professor Jeff Borland of the University of Melbourne, these data points collectively signal a weakening labour market, making a rate cut more likely.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[7NEWS.com.au](https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/real-estate/what-a-surprise-spike-in-the-unemployment-means-for-interest-rates-and-the-economy-c-20382752)\n\n**Rising unemployment could trigger earlier rate cuts**\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Labour Force Survey revealed that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 4.3% to 4.5%, surpassing market expectations of a modest increase to 4.3%. This rise was driven by an increase in the participation rate to 67.0%, despite a net addition of 15,000 jobs\u20148,700 full-time and 6,300 part-time. The underemployment rate also increased to 5.9%, indicating softening labor market conditions. Matt Bell, Chief Economist at Oliver Hume, stated that the unexpected jump in unemployment will prompt the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to reconsider its rate cut timeline, potentially bringing November and December cuts back into play. Although the unemployment rate is now at its highest level in nearly four years, it remains historically low, supporting ongoing wage growth and household incomes. Monthly hours worked rose to 1,987 million. August\u2019s employment figures were revised downward from a reported loss of 5,400 jobs to a loss of 11,900, indicating a weaker labor market than initially thought. Bell noted that the property market remains resilient, with strong new land sales activity continuing into the September quarter, and expects this trend to persist through 2025 regardless of the November and December rate decisions. The upcoming September quarter inflation data, due on October 29, 2025, will heavily influence the RBA\u2019s November policy decision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[eliteagent.com](https://eliteagent.com/rising-unemployment-could-trigger-earlier-rate-cuts/)\n\n**What a surprise spike in the unemployment rate means for interest rates and the economy**\nAustralia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 4.3% in August to 4.5% in September 2025, the highest level since November 2021 and the tenth consecutive month above 4%.

The decline in employment is not due to reduced government spending in the non-market sector\u2014such as health care, education, and public administration\u2014where hours worked remain stable. Instead, the drop is driven by a contraction in the market sector, as private employers are reducing hiring in response to weaker economic conditions. Additional indicators include a decline in average monthly hours worked from 0.27% in 2024 to 0.04% in 2025, and a rise in underemployment from 9.9% to 10.4% since late 2024.

The trend unemployment rate rose to 4.32%, slightly above the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) forecast peak of 4.3%. The RBA had previously projected unemployment would peak at 4.3% and remain there until late 2027. The surge in unemployment increases pressure on the RBA to consider earlier and deeper interest rate cuts, despite ongoing inflation concerns. The upcoming Q3 CPI inflation data, due on 29 October 2025, will be critical in determining whether a rate cut occurs in November.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 12:48 AM\nSource:[macrobusiness.com.au](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2025/10/unemployment-surge-opens-door-for-rate-cuts/)\n\n**Australia Jobless Rate Holds Steady at 4.2% | Forex News 2025.09.18...**\nAustralia\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate held steady at 4.2\u202f% in August\u202f2025, matching the previous month\u2019s figure and market expectations.
