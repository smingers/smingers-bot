Trimmed mean inflation (RBA's preferred measure) rose 0.9% in the December quarter\n   - Annual trimmed mean inflation: 3.4% over the year\n   - Both results are slightly higher than the RBA had expected\n\n3. **Labor Market:**\n   -

Australia's unemployment rate reached a 50-year low of 3.4% in October 2022\n   - The rate has been \"slowly grinding higher for the last three years\"\n\n3. **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Target:**\n   -

ABS seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates, January-2024 to January-2026  \n   \u2022 Only one official monthly observation \u2013 December-2025, 4.1 per cent \u2013 can be confirmed in the new hits (ABS \u201cLabour Force, Australia, December 2025\u201d, 22 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Earlier ad-hoc searches had located August-2025 (4.2 %) and October-2025 (4.3 %) in ABS media releases, but the underlying time-series file (series ID A84423060) has still not been opened; therefore 22 of the required 25 monthly data points remain missing.  \n   \u2022 Two large blocks of text that look like labour-market tables were returned in the latest crawl, but they are from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, not the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and are therefore irrelevant to the Australian series being sought.  \n   \u2022 Conclusion: Without direct access to ABS Data-Explorer or the pre-formatted spreadsheets that accompany each monthly publication, it is still impossible to compile the full January-2024 \u2192 January-2026 run of seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates.\n\n2. Forecasts for the unemployment rate in 2026  \n   Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  \n   \u2022 No Statement on Monetary Policy later than February-2025 appears in the result set. The February-2025 \u201cIn Brief\u201d note repeats that unemployment is \u201cexpected to increase slightly \u2026 but stabilise a little above 4 per cent\u201d, and the November-2025 SMP (located earlier) said \u201caround 4\u00bd per cent\u201d for end-2026; however, the definitive February-2026 SMP table that normally carries the numeric December-2026 forecast is still missing.  \n   \u2022 Hence the precise RBA baseline figure for 2026 cannot yet be quoted.\n\n   Major commercial banks  \n   \u2022 Westpac Economics page (updated 2 Feb 2026) is reachable, but none of the linked PDFs is indexed, and no 2026 unemployment number is visible in the page text.  \n   \u2022 NAB: a corrupted PDF (\u201cWhat to Watch\u201d, 12 Dec 2025) was captured but is unreadable; no forecast can be extracted.  \n   \u2022 ANZ: nothing in the results carries a 2026 labour-market forecast.  \n   \u2022 CBA: newsroom articles in January-2026 describe the labour market as \u201cslightly tight\u201d and say the unemployment rate is \u201cexpected to stay near current levels through 2026\u201d (CBA Wage & Labour Insights, Jan-2026) but give no number.  \n   \u2022 Therefore none of the four major-bank forecasts requested (Westpac, NAB, ANZ, CBA) is yet available in numeric form.\n\nSummary of remaining gaps  \nA. 22 of the 25 monthly ABS unemployment rates between Jan-2024 and Jan-2026.  \nB. The numeric RBA forecast for December-2026.  \nC. Explicit 2026 unemployment-rate forecasts from Westpac, NAB, ANZ and CBA.\n\nBecause these gaps are material, targeted follow-up searches are still required.</Agent_report>\n"
