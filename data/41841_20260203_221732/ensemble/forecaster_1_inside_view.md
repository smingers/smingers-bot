- **Key fact:** Notes 2025 CPI not yet published as of Jan 19, 2026; provides 2024 top/bottom rankings
- **Assessment:** Confirms publication timing but no U.S.-specific data

### Secondary Context Sources

**AskNews: Transparency International Release Announcement (Feb 3, 2026):**
- **Quality:** High - official announcement
- **Key fact:** 2025 CPI will be released **February 10, 2026** in Rome

## (b) EVIDENCE ANALYSIS

### Strong Evidence (Large Shifts Warranted)

1. **2024 baseline of 65 as historic low**
   - Multiple independent sources confirm
   - Represents structural shift below previous 67 floor (2020-2021)
   - 4-point drop from 2023 is second-largest single-year decline in series
   - **Direction:** Establishes low anchor; suggests either stabilization or continued decline

2. **Consistent downward trend 2015-2024**
   - 9-year pattern of declining scores
   - No sustained recoveries observed in this period
   - **Direction:** Modest continued decline more likely than sharp recovery

### Moderate Evidence (Moderate Shifts)

3. **FCPA enforcement pause and DOJ guideline changes (2025)**
   - Policy implemented during measurement period (2025)
   - Expert assessment: "risks undermining U.S. leadership" but "may not significantly increase corruption levels"
   - Causal mechanism: Weakened enforcement → potentially worse expert perceptions
   - **Direction:** Slight negative pressure on 2025 score (1-2 points)

4. **47 countries hit record lows in 2024**
   - Global trend of worsening perceptions
   - U.S. part of broader pattern, not isolated
   - **Direction:** Suggests systemic factors may continue in 2025

5. **Historical volatility patterns**
   - Typical year-over-year change: 0-2 points
   - Exceptional changes: -4 points (2018, 2024)
   - Post-large-drop pattern: Stabilization (2018→2019: 71→69) or continuation (2023→2024: 69→65)
   - **Direction:** Mixed - could stabilize or continue declining

### Weak Evidence (Small Adjustments)

6. **No major U.S. corruption scandals reported in 2025 sources**
   - Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence
   - CPI reflects expert perceptions, not just headline events
   - **Direction:** Neutral to slight positive

7. **Global average remained at 43 for 12 years**
   - Shows CPI methodology produces stable global averages
   - Individual country volatility exists within stable framework
   - **Direction:** Suggests 2025 won't see dramatic methodological shifts

## (c) TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS

**Prediction timeframe:** 25 days until resolution (Feb 3 → March 1, 2026)

**Critical timing note:** The 2025 CPI will be **published February 10, 2026** - just 7 days from today. The outcome is essentially determined (2025 data collected, score calculated), we're simply awaiting publication.

**If timeframe halved (12-13 days):** No material impact - outcome already determined.

**If timeframe doubled (50 days):** No material impact - publication occurs before resolution regardless.

**Measurement period:** The 2025 CPI measures perceptions during **calendar year 2025**, which has fully elapsed. Key events during 2025:
- FCPA enforcement pause (Feb-July 2025)
- DOJ guideline revisions (June 2025)
- Post-2024 election governance transition
- Expert surveys conducted throughout 2025

**Implication:** This is effectively a "nowcast" rather than forecast - we're predicting an already-calculated number awaiting publication.

## (d) JUSTIFICATION & CALIBRATION

### Checklist Item 2: Base Rate Anchor
**Outside view base rate:** U.S. historical range 2012-2024 is 65-76, with 2024 baseline at **65** (current low). Recent clustering: 67-69 (2020-2023), then sharp drop to 65 (2024).

### Key Factors Shifting Prediction from Base Rate

**Factor 1: Mean reversion vs. trend continuation**
- After 2024's 4-point drop to historic low, two scenarios:
  - **Stabilization:** Similar to 2018 drop (76→71), followed by modest decline to 69 then stabilization at 67. Would suggest 2025 score of 63-66.
  - **Trend acceleration:** 2024 drop represents new phase of decline. Would suggest 2025 score of 61-64.

**Factor 2: FCPA policy changes during 2025**
- Enforcement pause and guideline revisions signal weakening anti-corruption infrastructure
- Expert opinion suggests this "risks undermining U.S. leadership"
- However, experts also note "may not significantly increase corruption levels"
- **Impact estimate:** -1 to -2 points on expert perceptions

**Factor 3: Absence of major positive reforms**
- No evidence of significant anti-corruption initiatives in 2025
- Political environment remains polarized
- **Impact estimate:** Neutral to slight negative

**Factor 4: Historical volatility after large drops**
- 2018 precedent: After -5 point drop (76→71), next year was -2 (71→69)
- 2024 precedent: After -4 point drop (69→65), next year is unknown
- **Pattern suggests:** Continued decline of 1-3 points more likely than recovery

### Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles):**
- Most likely outcome: 63-65 range
- Rationale: Modest continued decline (1-2 points) from 2024 baseline of 65
- FCPA changes + continued trend = slight negative pressure
- No evidence of dramatic improvement or collapse

**Moderate variation (20th-80th percentiles):**
- 20th percentile: ~62 (3-point decline, accelerating trend)
- 80th percentile: ~66 (stabilization/slight recovery)
- Range captures both trend continuation and mean reversion scenarios

**Tail scenarios:**
- 10th percentile: ~60 (major deterioration, -5 points, unprecedented but possible given FCPA changes + potential unreported scandals)
- 90th percentile: ~67 (recovery to 2020-2021 levels, would require positive developments not in evidence)

### Checklist Item 3: Consistency Check
**Implied median ≈ 64; mean ≈ 64**
- This makes sense: Slight decline from 2024 baseline of 65
- Aligned with justification: FCPA changes + continued trend = modest negative pressure
- Not overconfident (7-point 90/10 range) nor over-hedged (tightly clustered around evidence)

### Checklist Item 4: Top Evidence Pieces

1. **2024 baseline of 65 is historic low** - Factually validated by 3+ independent sources
2. **FCPA enforcement paused Feb-July 2025** - Confirmed by legal sources; experts say "risks undermining leadership"
3. **Consistent 9-year declining trend (2015-2024)** - Validated across all historical data sources
4. **No major positive reforms or scandals reported for 2025** - Absence noted across comprehensive news search
5. **Historical pattern: Large drops followed by continued modest decline** - 2018-2019 precedent supports this

### Checklist Item 5: Blind Spot
**Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly:**
- **Upside surprise:** Major anti-corruption initiative or reform implemented in late 2025 that I'm unaware of, coupled with expert perception that FCPA pause was temporary/minor. Would push score to 67-68.
- **Downside surprise:** Unreported major corruption scandal from 2025 that emerges in expert surveys, or experts weigh FCPA changes more heavily than anticipated. Would push score to 60-61.

**Assessment:** Downside risk slightly higher given trend direction and FCPA policy changes.

## FINAL CALIBRATED PREDICTION

**Reasoning:**
- Anchoring on 2024 baseline of **65**
- FCPA policy changes during 2025 create modest negative pressure (-1 to -2 points)
- Historical pattern after large drops suggests continued decline rather than recovery
- No evidence of positive developments to counter trend
- Setting 90/10 interval of 60-67 (7-point range) to capture uncertainty while respecting evidence

**Distribution shape:**
- Slight negative skew (tail extends further down than up)
- Central clustering around 63-65
- Modest probability mass at 66-67 (stabilization scenario)
- Low but non-negligible probability below 62 (acceleration scenario)
