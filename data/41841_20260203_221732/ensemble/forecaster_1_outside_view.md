Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Source 1 - World Population Review (Jan 19, 2026):**
This source is dated in the future relative to today (Feb 3, 2026), but only provides general information about U.S. ranking (25th-least corrupt) without specific scores. The focus is on state-level corruption rather than national CPI scores. Limited utility for this forecast.

**Source 2 - Worlddata.info:**
High-quality factual source providing the critical data point: **U.S. scored 65 on the 2024 CPI, ranked 28th globally**. Shows historical trend: 2023 (69), 2022 (69), 2021 (67), 2020 (67). The article notes corruption "slightly raised" in 2024 compared to 2023 (i.e., score decreased from 69 to 65, a 4-point drop). This is factual reporting of TI data.

**Source 3 - Our World in Data:**
Methodological description of CPI. Confirms the index has remained consistent since 2012, uses 0-100 scale (100=clean), and includes 90% confidence intervals. No predictive content but validates data comparability.

**Source 4 - Al Jazeera (Feb 11, 2025):**
Reports on the 2024 CPI release. **Confirms U.S. score of 65** for 2024. Notes global average remained at 43. Factual reporting with expert opinion from TI CEO about corruption and climate (not directly relevant to U.S. score prediction).

**Source 5 - Mexico News Daily:**
Reports on the **2025 CPI release** (note: this appears to be mislabeled as it discusses 2024 data). States **U.S. scored 65 points, ranked 28th** - described as "worst CPI score since the current index was established in 2012." Confirms U.S. was among 47 countries receiving their lowest-ever scores. This is critical: the 65 score for 2024 represents a historical low.

**Source 6 - Steptoe (March 31, 2025):**
Legal analysis noting the DOJ paused FCPA enforcement for six months (ending July 2025). This is expert legal analysis suggesting potential governance concerns but doesn't provide CPI scores.

**Agent Report:**
Provides comprehensive time series but contains a critical error: states "2024 n/a – the '2024 CPI' will be released January 2025." However, multiple other sources confirm the 2024 CPI score is 65. The agent report's historical data through 2023 aligns with Source 2 (2023: 69, 2022: 69, 2021: 67). The report discusses potential 2024-25 reforms (Drain the Swamp Act) and scandals, though legislative prospects are speculative.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- **2024 CPI: 65** (confirmed by multiple sources)
- **2023 CPI: 69**
- **2022 CPI: 69**
- 2024 represents the lowest U.S. score since 2012
- 4-point drop from 2023 to 2024

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **U.S. historical CPI scores (2012-2024):** Most direct reference class. Shows range of 67-76, with recent trend downward. Mean ≈70, recent scores clustering 67-69 before 2024's drop to 65.

2. **Year-over-year changes in U.S. CPI:** Examining volatility. Largest single-year drops: -4 (2018), -2 (2016, 2019, 2020), -3 (implied for some years). Largest gains: +2 (2015, 2022). Typical change: 0-2 points.

3. **OECD peer countries (stable democracies):** U.S. peers like UK (71), France (71), Canada (76) show relative stability with occasional 1-3 point fluctuations.

4. **Countries experiencing governance challenges:** Less relevant as U.S. remains a stable democracy despite recent score decline.

**Most suitable reference class:** U.S. historical CPI scores (2012-2024) combined with year-over-year change patterns. This provides both baseline expectations and volatility measures.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** The 2025 CPI will be published in January 2026 (per standard TI release schedule), measuring perceptions of corruption during calendar year 2025. We are forecasting as of February 3, 2026, meaning:
- The outcome is already determined (2025 has passed)
- The CPI is calculated but not yet published
- Resolution is in ~26 days (March 1, 2026)

**Historical patterns over 1-year periods:**
- Scores typically change 0-2 points year-over-year
- Exceptional drops: -4 points (2018), and now -4 points (2023→2024)
- The 2024 score of 65 broke through the previous floor of 67 (2020-2021)
- After large drops, scores sometimes stabilize (2020-2021 both at 67) or partially recover (2022 to 69)

**Critical consideration:** The 2025 score will reflect perceptions during 2025, which includes:
- Aftermath of 2024 election and transition period
- Any major scandals or reforms during 2025
- Expert and business leader assessments collected throughout 2025

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Baseline from historical data:**
The U.S. has scored between 67-76 since 2012, with a declining trend since 2015 peak of 76. The 2024 score of 65 represents a new low, breaking below the 2020-2021 floor of 67.

**Mean reversion vs. continued decline:**
- **Arguments for stabilization/recovery:** After the sharp 2023→2024 drop (-4 points), some mean reversion might occur. Historical pattern shows after 2018 drop to 71, scores stabilized around 67-69. No major new corruption scandals have been widely reported for 2025 yet.

- **Arguments for continued decline:** The 65 score represents a structural shift, possibly reflecting deeper governance concerns. The trend since 2015 has been consistently downward. The FCPA enforcement pause (though temporary) signals potential weakening of anti-corruption infrastructure. Political polarization and institutional challenges may continue affecting expert perceptions.

**Most likely scenario:** Given the 2024 score of 65 is already a historic low and represents recent expert assessments, the 2025 score will likely remain in the 63-67 range. A dramatic recovery (back to 69+) seems unlikely within one year without major reforms. Continued decline below 63 is possible but would represent an unprecedented acceleration.

**Central tendency:** 64-66 range most probable, centered around 65.

Outside view calibration:

The 2025 CPI score will be based on surveys and assessments conducted during calendar year 2025, reflecting expert perceptions of U.S. public sector corruption during that period.

**Anchoring on 2024 baseline:** 65 points

**Distribution considerations:**

1. **Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles):** Should cluster tightly around 64-66, given:
   - Scores rarely move more than 2 points year-over-year
   - 2024's 65 represents current expert consensus
   - No dramatic reforms or scandals reported for 2025 yet

2. **Moderate variation (20th-80th percentiles):** 
   - 20th percentile (~63): Accounts for potential continued decline, perhaps 2-point drop
   - 80th percentile (~67): Allows for modest recovery/stabilization

3. **Tail scenarios (10th and 90th percentiles):**
   - 10th percentile (~61): Extreme scenario of continued rapid deterioration (would require major scandals or governance breakdown)
   - 90th percentile (~68): Optimistic scenario approaching 2020-2021 levels (would require significant positive developments)

**Calibration checks:**
- Historical range 2012-2024: 65-76 (current score at bottom)
- Historical volatility: Typically ±0-2 points, occasionally ±3-4 points
- Recent trend: Declining, with 2024 at historic low
- Time since measurement: 2025 data already collected, just awaiting publication

**Risk of upsets:** In CPI forecasting, major surprises are rare because:
- Methodology uses multiple data sources with built-in averaging
- Scores reflect aggregated expert perceptions, not single events
- Year-over-year changes are typically modest

However, the 2023→2024 drop of 4 points was itself somewhat unexpected, suggesting current volatility may be higher than historical norms.

**Final calibration:** Setting a 90/10 confidence interval of approximately 61-68 captures:
- 80% probability mass in a 7-point range
- Central clustering around 65 (current baseline)
- Allowance for both modest recovery and continued decline
- Recognition that we're in a period of elevated uncertainty
