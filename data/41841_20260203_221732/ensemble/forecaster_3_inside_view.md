## 1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Transparency International’s **published 2025 CPI score for the United States** on the **0–100 scale** (higher = cleaner), expected to be released **February 2026**.

---

## (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, dating)

1) **Mexico News Daily (past; reports 2024 CPI US=65)**  
- **What it says (facts):** U.S. scored **65** on the **2024 CPI**; lowest since the current series began (2012).  
- **Quality:** Medium-high as a secondary report; the key figure (US=65 for 2024) is widely corroborated elsewhere, but it’s still not the primary TI release.  
- **Use here:** Anchor for most-recent confirmed score level.

2) **Fortune (past; reports 2024 CPI US=65)**  
- **What it says (facts):** Confirms U.S. **2024 CPI = 65**, rank 28th. Notes CPI is public-sector corruption perception aggregated from multiple sources.  
- **Quality:** High for the single numerical fact (65) and general methodological description (journalistic but mainstream, and consistent with TI reporting).  
- **Use here:** Independent confirmation of the 2024 level and that it was historically low for the U.S.

3) **World Population Review (dated Jan 19, 2026; secondary and somewhat muddled)**  
- **What it says (facts):** Explains CPI methodology and global patterns; doesn’t cleanly add U.S.-specific forward-looking information in the provided excerpt.  
- **Quality:** Medium-low relevance for *this* forecast; useful only as general CPI background.

4) **Statista Latin America CPI (past; not U.S.-relevant)**  
- **What it says:** Regional stats for Latin America.  
- **Quality:** Low relevance to U.S. 2025 score.

5) **AskNews: SIR (Feb 3, 2026) “TI to release 2025 CPI next week”**  
- **What it says (facts):** **Release date: Tuesday Feb 10, 2026** for the “2025 CPI”.  
- **Quality:** High for the **timing**; no U.S. numerical content.

6) **AskNews: The Conversation (Oct 1, 2025) on FCPA enforcement pause / reduced priority**  
- **What it says (facts + interpretation):** Reports policy shift reducing/pausing certain FCPA enforcement; argues (opinion/analysis) this could weaken U.S. leadership on anti-corruption.  
- **Quality:** Medium: credible outlet, but mostly **interpretive** regarding CPI impact. Still relevant as an “inside view” directional factor for perceptions.

7) **Other AskNews items (Philippines/Italy/Belgium/etc.)**  
- **What they say:** Mostly country-specific corruption stories not directly tied to U.S. CPI score formation.  
- **Quality:** Low relevance for U.S. numeric prediction.

## (b) Evidence analysis with weights (what moves the forecast)

### Strong evidence
- **Confirmed last observed U.S. CPI (2024) = 65** (Mexico News Daily + Fortune, consistent with TI reporting style).  
  *Why strong:* Direct measurement of the same index; most predictive single anchor for next reading.

- **Historical CPI year-to-year volatility is usually small (often ±1–2), with occasional larger moves** (implied by the historical context: 69 in 2022/2023 then 65 in 2024).  
  *Why strong:* CPI is a slow-moving perception composite; large single-year swings are less common.

### Moderate evidence
- **2025 included visible governance/ethics controversies + perceived rule-of-law/polarization concerns (general environment) and FCPA de-emphasis signals** (The Conversation; plus widely discussed U.S. governance narratives, though not numerically specified in the provided sources).  
  *Mechanism:* CPI sources include expert/business perceptions of enforcement, integrity constraints, and institutional quality; a perceived pullback on anti-bribery enforcement plausibly nudges perceptions down or prevents rebound.

- **Release is imminent (Feb 10, 2026)** so uncertainty is mostly *measurement/aggregation* rather than unknown future events.  
  *Mechanism:* No “future shock” can occur before resolution; we’re essentially estimating a soon-to-be-published composite.

### Weak evidence
- Non-U.S. corruption scandals and country narratives (Philippines, Italy, etc.).  
  *Mechanism:* Minimal direct bearing on the U.S. score.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left until resolution/publication:** ~**1 week** (from Feb 3 to Feb 10, 2026; question resolves by Mar 1, 2026).  
- **If timeframe were halved:** essentially no change—publication timing is fixed; only marginal update risk.  
- **If timeframe were doubled:** also little change; no additional 2025-information can enter the CPI, but there is small risk of “leaks” or additional reporting about expected results. Net: distribution would barely move.

---

## (d) Justification (outside view → inside view)

### Outside view baseline (reference class)
- Use the U.S. CPI trajectory since 2012 and especially recent years: **69 (2022/2023) → 65 (2024)** per provided context.  
- CPI typically moves slowly; the **base-rate expectation** from a 65 reading is **a nearby value next year** (roughly 64–67), with some mean reversion but also persistence.

### Inside view adjustments for 2025 conditions (net effect: slight downward / limited rebound)
- **Downward pressure / blocks to rebound (moderate):** reduced emphasis/pausing of some FCPA enforcement in 2025 could feed into expert perceptions about anti-corruption seriousness (even if CPI is mostly domestic public-sector corruption, it still reflects integrity/enforcement norms broadly).  
- **Countervailing consideration (small):** the 2024 drop to 65 could partially reflect measurement noise or a one-year perception dip, implying some chance of modest rebound (e.g., to 66–67).  
- **Net:** I center close to **65**, with modest skew toward **“no big recovery”**.

So my median is slightly above the last published 65 (allowing mild mean reversion), but I keep meaningful mass on 64–65 given continued negative perception drivers.

## Quick forecasting checklist (abridged)

1) **Target variable:** U.S. **CPI 2025 score (0–100)** as published by TI (Feb 2026 release).  
2) **Outside-view base rate:** last observed **65** (2024), typical moves small (±1–2).  
3) **Consistency check:** implied median ≈ **65.5**; mean ≈ **65.3**; consistent with “near-65 with mild mean reversion but headwinds.”  
4) **Top evidence (3–5 items):**
   - U.S. **2024 CPI = 65** (multiple sources).  
   - CPI is slow-moving; typical annual change is small.  
   - 2025 enforcement-signaling (FCPA de-emphasis) plausibly worsens/limits improvement in perceptions.  
   - Imminent publication limits “future event” uncertainty.  
5) **Blind spot (most likely to make this look silly):** TI’s underlying source components could register a **larger rebound** (e.g., 67–69) if 2024’s 65 was an outlier or if several component surveys improved simultaneously.
