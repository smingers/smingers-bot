Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and how I weight it)

1) **WorldPopulationReview – “Most Corrupt States 2026” (Jan 19, 2026)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Mentions the US is “25th-least corrupt” according to CPI, but does **not** give the score and is ambiguous on which CPI year it references. Most of the article is about **US states**, not the national CPI.  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** General commentary that corruption measurement is hard.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Low weight** for the forecast. The national CPI mention is vague; state-level material is not what the question resolves on.

2) **Worlddata.info – US corruption page (includes table through 2024 CPI)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** A year-by-year CPI series and explicitly states **US 2024 CPI = 65**, with prior years **2023 = 69, 2022 = 69, 2021 = 67, 2020 = 67**, etc. Notes the site uses an “inverted” visualization but clarifies the official score.  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Narrative that corruption has “risen moderately.”  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate weight.** It’s a secondary aggregator, but its numbers match other reporting in the packet (Al Jazeera) and known CPI scaling.

3) **Our World in Data – CPI methodology page**  
- **What it provides (facts):** How CPI is constructed (0–100; average of sources; consistent methodology since 2012; includes uncertainty intervals).  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Mainly methodological cautions, not directional claims.  
- **Quality/weight:** **High weight for method**, **no direct weight** for the numeric forecast except as a reminder that year-to-year moves tend to be bounded and somewhat smoothed.

4) **Al Jazeera (Feb 11, 2025) – reporting on “2024 CPI”**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Reports **US score = 65** in the CPI results it is describing; gives global context and TI quotes.  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** TI framing about corruption derailing climate action.  
- **Quality/weight:** **High weight** for the key datum (US=65) because it is mainstream reporting tied to TI’s release.

5) **MexicoNewsDaily (date not shown here; article about “2025 CPI”)**  
- **What it provides (facts, but likely mislabeled):** Claims “2025 CPI” released Feb 11, 2025 and says **US scored 65** and that it’s the worst since 2012-methodology. The release date aligns with the **CPI 2024** cycle (published Feb 2025), suggesting a **year-label confusion** (common in media: “2025 report” vs “2024 CPI”).  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate weight** for reinforcing the **65** figure, but **low weight** on the “2025 CPI” label and some narrative claims.

6) **Steptoe client alert (Mar 31, 2025) – anti-corruption rankings / FCPA enforcement pause**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Claims a **temporary pause** in FCPA enforcement for six months (ending July 2025, possibly extendable). Also provides regional CPI context (LATAM) but that’s not directly relevant.  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Law-firm commentary that companies won’t pause compliance; broader enforcement collaboration trends.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate weight** if true, because enforcement posture can affect expert perceptions feeding CPI sources—but impact on a single year’s CPI is usually **incremental**, not huge.

7) **Agent report (time series 2012–2023; reform/scandal discussion)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** A US CPI time series through 2023 and OECD peer comparisons; also claims “2024 n/a” (but we have multiple sources saying CPI 2024 score was 65, released Feb 2025).  
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Speculates on reforms (e.g., Khanna “Drain the Swamp Act”) and how quickly reforms feed into CPI; notes moving-window dynamics.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate** for the historical arc and “bounded-change” intuition; **lower** for specific legislative prospects without corroboration here, and it appears slightly out of sync on the latest available CPI year.

**Bottom line from sources:** The most reliable numeric anchor we have is **US CPI 2024 = 65**. The question asks for **US CPI 2025**, which (given typical TI timing) is likely to be published in early 2026 and thus should be close to resolving soon.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choose baseline)

Candidate reference classes:

1) **United States CPI year-to-year changes since 2012 methodology reset (best match).**  
- Pros: Same country, same index construction, directly predicts next value.  
- Cons: Small sample (~13 annual transitions), structural breaks possible.

2) **OECD/peer democracies’ year-to-year CPI variability.**  
- Pros: Larger sample, similar institutions; helps bound plausible annual movement.  
- Cons: Cross-country differences; US-specific shocks may dominate.

3) **Countries experiencing a 3–5 point drop in CPI and subsequent year movement (conditional reference class).**  
- Pros: Directly relevant because US appears to have recently dropped from ~69 to 65.  
- Cons: Conditional samples are smaller and can be cherry-picked.

**Most suitable reference class:** **(1) US CPI time series since 2012**, supplemented by (2) for plausible volatility bounds.

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long until resolution; what typically changes over that span)

- **Today:** 2026-02-03  
- **Resolution date:** 2026-03-01  
- **Time left:** ~**26 days**

This is a short-horizon forecast. In practice, the CPI 2025 score is likely already determined or close to determined because it aggregates existing expert/business assessments. That argues for:
- **No “long-run drift” assumptions** over multiple years.
- **Modest dispersion** but still non-trivial uncertainty because one-year moves of a few points do happen, and because we don’t have the actual release in the packet.

Historically for the US (from the packet’s series, plus the 2024=65 anchor), annual moves are commonly **0 to 2 points**, with occasional **3–4 point** moves.

### (d) Justification (outside-view prediction logic)

**Step 1: Establish the baseline level.**  
The best-supported current anchor is **CPI 2024 = 65** (Al Jazeera + Worlddata + MexicoNewsDaily’s repeated “65” despite label confusion). So a neutral baseline for CPI 2025 is **mid-60s**.

**Step 2: Use base-rate year-to-year volatility.**  
US annual changes since 2012 are usually small; the largest swings cited are around **4 points** (not common). Because CPI combines multiple sources and tends to be “sticky,” large one-year jumps are less likely than small moves.

**Step 3: Directional push/pull (inside-view adjustments remain modest).**
- **Downward pressure possibilities:** Continued high-profile governance/ethics controversies; any perception of weakened enforcement (e.g., if the claimed FCPA pause is salient to TI’s component sources); election-year institutional stress (if applicable to 2025 perceptions).  
- **Upward pressure possibilities:** Credible reforms (stock-trading restrictions, ethics enforcement, transparency measures). But reforms typically diffuse slowly into perception indices (and some CPI inputs may lag).

Given the stickiness plus uncertainty about major enacted reforms, the outside view expectation is: **CPI 2025 is near 65, with modest risk of drifting to 63–64, and some chance of a small rebound to 66–68.**

So my central tendency is **~65–66**, with a reasonably wide interval to account for surprises.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tethering to an established distribution:** US CPI has mostly lived between the **mid-60s and low/mid-70s** since 2012, with the recent value at **65**.  
- **Accounting for “upsets”:** Even perception indices can move 3–4 points in a year (not frequent, but not rare). I therefore avoid an overly narrow distribution.  
- **Tail behavior:** A drop below ~60 would likely require a major systemic shock recognized across multiple expert sources; a rise above ~70 would likely require sustained reform and improved institutional confidence—less likely on a one-year step. Still, the bounds are open, so I allow some tail probability.

I’ll center slightly above 65 (minor mean reversion) but keep meaningful mass in 63–65 given the recent downward step.
