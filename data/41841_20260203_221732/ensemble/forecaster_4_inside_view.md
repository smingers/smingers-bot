(a) Source analysis (chronological order, key facts vs. opinion, weight)

1. Al Jazeera, 11 Feb 2025 – Reports Transparency International’s 2024 CPI, United States = 65/100 (lowest since 2012). Purely factual, directly tied to TI release. High-quality mainstream outlet ➜ High weight.

2. Mexico News Daily, Feb 2025 – Article on “2025 CPI” but obviously describing the same report released Feb 2025; repeats U.S. = 65 and rank = 28. Factual nugget matches Al Jazeera; label confusion noted. Moderate weight (corroboration).

3. WorldData.info (undated page updated 2026) – Time-series table for U.S. CPI 2012-2024, shows 2024 = 65, 2023 = 69 etc. Aggregator drawing from TI; methodology clear. Moderate weight for history.

4. Fortune, 12 Feb 2025 – Business press story on TI release; confirms 65 and details ranking and methodology. Adds TI chair quotation (opinion). High weight for score confirmation; opinion ignored.

5. Steptoe client alert, 31 Mar 2025 – Notes six-month freeze on new FCPA probes (Feb–Jul 2025) and lasting enforcement guideline shift. Factual for U.S. enforcement posture; professional legal source. Moderate weight.

6. AskNews note (SIR), 3 Feb 2026 – Announces TI will publish 2025 CPI on 10 Feb 2026. Confirms timing, no score. High weight for timing only.

7. Remaining Latin-America, Europe, golf, etc. articles – No direct data on U.S. CPI. Used only for background on global trends. Low weight.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength scale)

Strong evidence
• Four independent mainstream/official sources agree: U.S. 2024 CPI = 65.  
• Historical series 2012-2024 shows single-year moves rarely exceed ±4.

Moderate evidence  
• Documented temporary weakening of FCPA enforcement during 2025 could depress expert perceptions by 0-2 points.  
• No major 2025 integrity reform enacted; some ethics bills stalled ➜ little upward pressure.

Weak evidence  
• Media commentary that corruption “feels” worse; anecdotal scandals.  
• Speculation that 2024 drop will automatically “mean-revert.”

(c) Timeframe analysis

Days to resolution: ~26. All underlying perception surveys for 2025 are already closed; only publication is pending. Halving timeframe (13 days) or doubling (52 days) would barely change the distribution – nearly all uncertainty is about TI’s aggregation, not future events.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline  
• Mean of last five years before 2024 = 68.  
• Apply historic SD (≈1.9). Base median absent new information ≈68.

Inside-view adjustments  
–4 pts already materialised in 2024 (65).  
FCPA freeze & softer DOJ guidelines kept perceptions edgy through most of 2025 ⇒ expect at best a flat score, at worst another 1-2-point slip.  
No large, widely publicised reform or scandal suggests odds of a ±4-point swing are <10 %.

Therefore nudge the distribution slightly below 65 rather than above.  Central estimate 65–66 with mild left skew.

------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING CHECKLIST
1. Target variable: “United States score (0–100) in Transparency International’s 2025 CPI, published Feb 2026.”
2. Outside-view base median 68; final median 66 rooted in base after −2 pt adjustment.
3. Consistency check: implied median = 66; mean≈66; within historic 60-76 range.
4. Key evidence:  
   a) 2024 score confirmed at 65.  
   b) Rarely >±4 change per year.  
   c) Documented 2025 FCPA enforcement chill.  
   d) No offsetting integrity reform.  
5. Blind-spot: TI sources weight a dataset that sharply penalises US for 2025 campaign-finance or ethics revelations, causing a surprise 4-point drop to ≤61.
