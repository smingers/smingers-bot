FORECASTING CHECKLIST (self-audit – abridged)
1. Target variable: United States score (0-100 scale) on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index that will be released (labelled 2025 CPI) on 10 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside-view base rate: one-year random walk centred on last published U.S. score (65 in 2024), σ ≈ 1.8.  
3. Internal consistency: implied median = 64, mean ≈ 64.2 – coherent with justification.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 2024 score already at historic low (65).  
   • One-year changes for rich democracies almost always ±0-3 points.  
   • 2025 freeze/rollback of FCPA and ethics rules likely to nudge perceptions downward.  
   • No offsetting major anti-corruption reforms in 2025.  
   • Timing: index already finalised; last-minute events cannot help or hurt.  
5. Blind-spot: a large domestic scandal breaking late 2025 (e.g., cabinet bribery tapes) that international experts weighed heavily could drive score ≤ 60 – would push forecast down.

ANALYSIS

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion)
1. Mexico News Daily (Feb 2025): cites TI’s 2024 CPI figures – factual, matches TI press release.  Good quality, but not forward-looking.  
2. Fortune (12 Feb 2025): same 2024 CPI numbers; mainstream U.S. business media, reliable.  
3. WorldPopulationReview (19 Jan 2026): summary of 2024 CPI, no U.S. 2025 data; secondary source of historic data.  
4. Conversation op-ed (Oct 2025): discusses Feb 2025 executive order pausing FCPA – factual; analysis/opinion on implications (treat as expert opinion: academic authors).  
5. Steptoe client alert (Mar 2025, referenced in Conversation) – primary legal source confirming FCPA enforcement change.  
6. SIR wire note (3 Feb 2026): TI will publish the 2025 CPI on 10 Feb 2026 – establishes timeline.  
No source yet contains the 2025 score; therefore forecasting is truly ex-ante.

(b) Evidence weighting
• Strong evidence  
  – Historical data: rich democracies rarely move >3 points year-on-year.  
  – Structural factors: entrenched U.S. rule-of-law institutions keep scores in 60-80 band.

• Moderate evidence  
  – FCPA pause and narrowed DOJ guidelines (confirmed by multiple legal sources) plausibly worsen expert perceptions (-1 pt).  
  – Continuing downward trend since 2015 (-11 pts so far) suggests momentum (-0.5 pt).

• Weak evidence  
  – Media discussions of “lowest score ever” may anchor raters lower, but effect uncertain.  
  – Lack of major federal bribery scandals in 2025 could stabilise score (+0-0.5 pt).

(c) Timeframe
Resolution in 27 days.  CPI methodology uses surveys closed mid-Q4 2025; therefore the score is already locked.  Halving the timeframe (≈ two weeks) would not change the forecast; doubling (≈ two months) would only matter if a major error in the leaked figure surfaced.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment
Base rate: N(65,1.8²) ⇒ median 65.  
Adjustments:  
• FCPA rollback and ethics enforcement softening very visible to two of the 13 data providers (e.g., PRS, Economist Intelligence Unit) → expect -1 point.  
• Downward momentum & political polarisation (January 2025 clash over federal ethics funding) → additional -0.3 points.  
• No offsetting reforms (e.g., stalled DISCLOSE Act) → no upward shift.  

Resulting point estimate ≈ 64, with 80 % of mass within ±2.5 points, slightly right-skewed because a rebound to 66-67 is plausible if some sources judge the FCPA issue peripheral.
