Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. WorldData (Jan 2025, citing TI 2024 CPI): factual table of U.S. scores 2003-2024; methodology faithful to TI (high credibility). Opinion: “corruption has risen moderately” – consistent with data.  
2. Al Jazeera (11 Feb 2025, covering 2024 CPI): reports TI press-conference numbers; gives U.S. score 65 for the “2024 CPI”. Factual reporting; good reputation.  
3. Mexico News Daily (early 2025, on 2025 CPI): quotes TI’s 2025 release; states U.S. score 65 and rank 28th. The outlet is secondary but names TI as primary source and provides granular Mexico figures—moderate–high credibility.  
4. Steptoe Client Alert (31 Mar 2025): business-law memo; notes U.S. DOJ pause of FCPA enforcement (verifiable) – useful for inside-view but not yet reflected in CPI.  
5. Our World in Data methodology page: background only.  
6. Agent report: compiles TI data 2012-2023, identifies ±2-4-point annual swings and key U.S. reform/​scandal items. It is consistent with official data, but forward-looking parts are informed speculation.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Best class: “Single-country year-on-year CPI movements since 2012 among OECD peers.”  Humans rarely move >4 points in one year; median absolute change ≈1 point. U.S. own series (2012-2024) ranges 67-76 (span 9). This provides an empirical prior: 2025 score likely within ±3 of 2024’s 65.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
TI customarily releases the CPI at end-Jan each year.  From today (3 Feb 2026) resolution is 27 days away, and the underlying score has almost certainly already been finalised (and, per one source, released).  Last-minute events cannot affect it.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Start with random-walk prior centred on the most recent accepted score (65 for 2024).  Historical σ ≈1.8 points (OECD, 2012-24).  One-year 80 % band ≈ ±3.0.  Mexico News Daily already claims the 2025 score is exactly 65; TI never revises after publication, so treat that as a strong signal, though allow for small risk of journalistic error or mis-dating.

Weighting: 70 % weight on “report =65”, 30 % on historical random-walk prior N(65,1.8²).  Resulting distribution almost identical to a spike at 65 but with fattened tails (≈10 % chance of ≤63 or ≥67).

Outside view calibration:

• Mean ≈ 65.0  
• Central 80 % range 62.5–67.5 (rounded).  
• 10/90 percentiles set 2.5 σ from mean; 20/80 1.3 σ; 40/60 0.3 σ.  All values kept integer because TI rounds to the nearest whole point.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 62  
Percentile 20: 63  
Percentile 40: 64  
Percentile 60: 65  
Percentile 80: 66  
Percentile 90: 67
