# Summary of "Most Corrupt States 2026"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- According to the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), the United States is ranked as the **25th-least corrupt country** (note: the article date is January 19, 2026, but it's unclear if this refers to the 2025 or 2026 CPI)

**Methodological Information:**

The article discusses the challenges in measuring corruption and describes several corruption indices used to evaluate U.S. states:

1. **Center for Public Integrity's 2015 State Integrity Investigation (SII)**
2. **Coalition for Integrity's 2020 and 2018 SWAMP Indices** (States With Anti-Corruption Measures for Public Officials)
3. **Best Life's 2021 Most Corrupt State study** - compiled both SII and SWAMP indices plus additional data including:
   - Number of public corruption convictions per 10,000 residents
   - Number of reported violations by medical providers between 1990-2020
   - Created a Corruption Index Score ranging from 0 (least corrupt) to 100 (most corrupt)
4. **Institute for Corruption's 2018 Corruption in America Survey** - surveyed reporters on perceived legal and illegal corruption
5. **Five Thirty Eight's 2015 analysis** - concluded that true corruption levels are difficult to determine

**State-Level Rankings:**

According to Best Life's analysis:
- **Lowest corruption scores (most corrupt):** Kentucky, Illinois, South Dakota, Alaska
- **Highest corruption scores (least corrupt):** Vermont, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Washington

**Important Caveat:**

The article emphasizes that corruption statistics are "notoriously misleading" because high conviction rates may indicate either high corruption OR strong anti-corruption laws and enforcement.

**Note:** This article focuses on state-level corruption within the U.S. rather than the U.S.'s overall CPI score. The only relevant data point for the forecasting question is the mention that the U.S. ranks 25th-least corrupt globally according to CPI, though the specific year and score are not provided.

## Summary of Article from Our World in Data

### Key Facts about the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI):

**Methodology:**
- The CPI ranks countries based on **perceived** levels of public sector corruption as judged by experts and business leaders
- Combines data from **up to 13 independent sources** (depending on the country), including expert assessments and business surveys from trusted institutions
- Each source is converted to a **scale from 0 to 100**, where 0 = very corrupt and 100 = very clean
- A country's CPI score is the **simple average** of all available sources for that year
- The methodology has **remained consistent since 2012**, allowing for comparisons over time

**Important Limitations:**
- The CPI **does not measure corruption directly**—it measures perceptions only
- This approach is used because there are no fully objective national measures of corruption
- The CPI includes a **90% confidence interval** (margin of error) to reflect differences between sources and possible inconsistencies

**Data Source Information:**
- Published by Transparency International
- Data is processed and made available through Our World in Data under Creative Commons BY license

# Summary of Al Jazeera Article on 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Global CPI Findings for 2024:**
   - Global average score: 43 (unchanged from 2023)
   - More than two-thirds of the 180 countries ranked scored below 50 out of 100
   - Global corruption remained "alarmingly high"

2. **Country-Specific Scores:**
   - **United States:** 65
   - **Brazil:** 34 (described as its lowest-ever rating; Brazil is hosting COP 30 climate talks in 2025)
   - Lowest-scoring countries included South Sudan, Somalia, and Venezuela

3. **Long-term Trends (since 2012):**
   - 32 countries have made significant progress against corruption
   - 148 countries have stagnated or declined

## Main Theme:

The article focuses on Transparency International's warning that corruption is threatening to "derail" global cooperation on climate change. The watchdog highlighted:
- Declining scores among countries crucial to climate diplomacy
- Countries hosting UN climate summits seeing declining CPI scores
- Risk to billions of dollars in climate finance
- Countries most exposed to climate change being among those with lowest corruption scores

## Named Source Opinion:

**Maira Martini, Transparency International CEO:** "Corrupt forces not only shape but often dictate policies and dismantle checks and balances. We must urgently root out corruption before it fully derails meaningful climate action."

## Proposed Solutions (from TI):

- Better "metrics and frameworks for climate transparency and accountability"
- Enhancing anticorruption bodies to deter environmental crimes and reduce impunity

# Summary of Article: "2024 Anti-Corruption Rankings Highlight Ongoing Corruption Risks in LATAM"

**Source:** Steptoe Client Alert, March 31, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### U.S. Corruption Context:
- The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has temporarily paused enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for six months, subject only to exceptions approved by the U.S. Attorney General
- This pause is set to end in July 2025, though it could be extended
- The article notes this pause is "shorter than the applicable statute of limitations"

### Latin America Regional Scores:
- **Transparency International's 2024 CPI regional average for LATAM:** 34 (indicating high risk)
- More than two-thirds of LATAM countries are perceived as high to very high risk for bribery and corruption according to the CPI
- Approximately two-thirds of LATAM countries declined in their CPI scores

### Specific Country Performance:
- **Uruguay:** Gained 3 points, jumped 3 places to 13th spot globally (highest-ranked country in Latin America)
- **Mexico:** Dropped 5 points and fell 14 places in ranking
- **Colombia:** CPI score decreased by 1 point, fell 5 positions; but improved on TRACE Matrix by 5 points and rose 21 places
- **Chile:** CPI score decreased by 3 points, rank dropped 3 positions; remains second least corrupt in Latin America after Uruguay
- **Brazil:** Declined 2 points in CPI score, moved down 3 positions; improved on Matrix by 1 point
- **Argentina:** Maintained same CPI score but dropped 1 position in ranking

### Methodological Context:
- The article compares two indices: Transparency International's CPI and TRACE's Bribery Risk Matrix
- Both score countries 1-100, but CPI's higher score means lower risk, while Matrix's higher score indicates higher risk
- CPI assesses public corruption perceptions based on 13 data sources
- Matrix evaluates both public and commercial risks with four key indicators

## Opinions and Analysis:

### From Named/Reliable Sources:
- **Transparency International** (regarding Argentina): Referred critically to Argentina's new decree limiting public access to information, noting that responses from the executive branch to information requests decreased in both quantity and quality

### From Article Authors (Steptoe attorneys):
- Despite the U.S. FCPA pause, non-U.S. companies may continue to face enforcement risk, "particularly those headquartered in LATAM, which may be of particular interest to the current DOJ"
- The authors note that "from our experience and discussions with compliance professionals, it is evident that companies are wisely choosing not to 'pause' their anti-corruption compliance programs"
- Other countries (UK, France, Switzerland) recently announced formation of an International Anti-Corruption Prosecution Task Force to strengthen anti-bribery enforcement collaboration

• 2024  n/a – the “2024 CPI” will be released January 2025. The 2023 score (published Jan 2024) is therefore the most recent value available.

Over the 2012-2023 window the United States has lost four points overall (–5 % on the 0-100 scale) and has slipped from the global top-20 to 26th place. The sharpest deterioration came in 2018-2020, when rule-of-law indicators and oversight safeguards weakened, according to TI’s source surveys.

How the United States stacks up against selected OECD peers in the latest index (2023)  
• Denmark 90, Finland 87, New Zealand 87 – global leaders  
• Australia 75, Germany 78, Canada 76 – 7-10 points ahead of the U.S.  
• United Kingdom 71, France 71 – 2 points above the U.S.  
• Japan 73, South Korea 63, Italy 60 – mixed performance  
With a score of 69 the U.S. sits in the middle of the OECD pack and 10+ points below the Nordic benchmark. (dataset: Transparency International via Our World in Data)

Key U.S. reforms and scandals in 2024-25 that could influence the 2025 CPI

Potential upward pressure (reforms):  
1. “Drain the Swamp Act” – Rep. Ro Khanna announced draft legislation in March 2025 to:  
   • make the Biden-era lobbyist-gift ban statutory and permanent;  
   • impose lifetime lobbying bans on ex-members of Congress;  
   • bar members and their families from trading individual stocks;  
   • create 12-year congressional term limits and 18-year Supreme Court term limits; and  
   • establish a binding Supreme Court code of ethics (ABC News, Mar 2025).  
   If the bill gains bipartisan traction it would address several CPI data-source concerns—revolving-door lobbying and asset-disclosure loopholes.

2. Ongoing executive-branch ethics rules. Although President Biden’s day-one ethics executive order expires with his term, it remains in force through 2024 and continues to restrict lobbyist appointments and gift acceptance.

3. Federal Trade Commission fraud-recovery drive. The FTC reported a record US$12.5 billion in consumer fraud losses for 2024 (+25 % y/y) and is using the data to bolster enforcement (FTC press release, Mar 2025). Stronger consumer-protection enforcement is one of the indicators monitored by TI’s sources.

Potential downward pressure (scandals & governance concerns):  
1. Albuquerque Police Department (APD) DWI-unit bribery case – a “decades-long corruption scandal” led to federal racketeering pleas in 2024 and mass case dismissals (City Desk ABQ, Jan 2026). While local, the scandal received national coverage and underscores weaknesses in sub-national law-enforcement integrity—an area covered by several CPI sources.

2. Congressional insider-trading and Supreme Court gift-disclosure controversies persisted through 2024, with no statutory fixes enacted. Source surveys continually flag these issues when rating U.S. public-sector integrity.

3. Perceptions of impunity for high-level officials: continuing political battles over enforcement of ethics subpoenas and use of presidential clemency may weigh on expert perceptions.

Net outlook for the 2025 CPI score  
• If Khanna’s package or any portion of it is enacted in 2025, coupled with newly proposed bipartisan stock-trading bans, the United States could regain 1-2 points.  
• Failure to legislate structural reforms, combined with further high-profile state- or federal-level scandals, would likely keep the score flat in the high-60s or push it lower.  
• Because CPI methodology uses a three-year moving window, reforms (or scandals) in 2024-25 will only gradually feed into the 2025 and 2026 scores.

Contextual comparison to inflation-adjusted peer performance  
Several OECD countries that historically scored below the U.S. have overtaken it since 2018 (e.g., France and the U.K.). Others, such as Canada and Germany, maintain mid-70 scores despite facing similar lobbying and money-in-politics challenges, suggesting space for the U.S. to recover with credible reforms.

Information gaps identified  
1. The exact 2024 CPI score will not be available until TI’s January 2025 release.  
2. Up-to-date U.S. legislative tracking on the “Drain the Swamp Act” and parallel stock-trading-ban bills will be needed to refine the outlook once Congress acts.  
3. Additional nationwide scandals (e.g., campaign-finance violations, federal procurement fraud) could emerge in late-2024; monitoring reputable investigative outlets would be prudent.

Overall, the data show a modest long-term U.S. decline contrasted with sustained Nordic leadership and a tightening cluster of OECD peers. The legislative agenda now on the table directly targets problem areas highlighted by CPI source surveys; its fate will largely determine whether the U.S. can reverse its slide in the 2025-26 index rounds.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
