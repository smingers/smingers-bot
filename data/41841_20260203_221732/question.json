Countries are scored on a scale from 0 (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt, also referred to as most transparent).\n\nIn 2024, Denmark [scored the highest](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024) on the Corruption Perceptions Index, with a score of 90. Lowest was South Sudan, with a score of 8. The United States tied the Bahamas at 28th in the rankings, with a score of 65.
