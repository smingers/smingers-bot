Analysis:
The 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) will almost certainly be released by Transparency International in late-January 2026 (their typical schedule is the last week of January for the index covering the previous calendar year). Because today is 3 Feb 2026, the report may already be out or imminent, so the most relevant information will be:
• Any official press release or early media write-ups of the 2025 CPI, especially the U.S. score.  
• Commentary by Transparency International–USA or governance experts interpreting any change from last year’s U.S. score of 65.  
• 2025 news on federal ethics rules, Supreme Court disclosure controversies, campaign-finance cases, and state-level scandals that might have influenced the perception surveys feeding into the CPI.  

To get an inside view I need up-to-the-minute articles about the CPI release itself plus retrospective 2025 coverage of U.S. corruption-related developments likely to shift expert perceptions one or two points either way.
