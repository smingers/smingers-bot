The forecasting question is:
What will the United States score on the 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index?

Question background:
Every year, [Transparency International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_International) releases an updated version of its [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index), a global index and ranking of every country in the world based on their perceived levels of [public-sector corruption](https://www.transparency.org/en/news/how-cpi-scores-are-calculated). Countries are scored on a scale from 0 (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt, also referred to as most transparent).

In 2024, Denmark [scored the highest](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024) on the Corruption Perceptions Index, with a score of 90. Lowest was South Sudan, with a score of 8. The United States tied the Bahamas at 28th in the rankings, with a score of 65. That marked the U.S.'s [lowest-ever score on the index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024/index/usa) since the 100-point scale was adopted in 2012.

The lower bound is 54.5 and the upper bound is 70.5.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT squared brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
