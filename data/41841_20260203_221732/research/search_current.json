Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli Remolona Jr. acknowledged the country remains vulnerable, particularly due to its history of money laundering risks, and emphasized that preventing re-inclusion will require sustained, long-term efforts beyond short-term policy changes. He noted the next formal FATF evaluation is expected around 2027, and stressed that regulators must demonstrate consistent on-the-ground implementation of reforms, not just policy documents. The ongoing probe into the flood control corruption scandal has raised concerns about governance, enforcement credibility, and the sustainability of reforms, even though it does not automatically trigger re-listing. Philippine Institute for Development Studies senior research fellow John Paolo Rivera warned that perceptions of weak enforcement and unresolved high-level cases could undermine international confidence. He stressed that avoiding re-listing depends on credible prosecution of major corruption and money laundering cases, tighter monitoring of politically exposed persons, improved inter-agency coordination, and further reforms such as easing bank secrecy for lawful investigations, enhancing beneficial ownership transparency, and strengthening regulatory supervision. According to Rivera, FATF will ultimately assess whether reforms are consistently implemented and whether the financial system\u2019s integrity is restored.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:08 PM\nSource:[Philstar.com](https://www.philstar.com/business/2026/02/04/2505485/philippines-risk-returning-dirty-money-list)\n\n**REAL ESTATE INVESTORS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT 2026 HOUSING MARKET ACCORDING TO WINTER 2025 RCN CAPITAL INVESTOR SENTIMENT SURVEY**\nAccording to the Winter 2025 RCN Capital/CJ Patrick Company Investor Sentiment Index (ISI)\u2122, real estate investor sentiment remained stable with a score of 101, the seventh consecutive quarter scoring 100 or above since the index's inception in 2023, indicating a generally positive outlook. Investors were cautiously optimistic about the 2026 housing market, with 38% expecting improvement and only 19% anticipating worsening conditions. Market perceptions showed 45% viewing current conditions as better than a year ago, while 30% saw them as unchanged. Over the next six months, 44% expected improvement, 36% expected stability, and 19% feared decline. The ISI has plateaued after a 14-point rise from Spring to Summer 2025, but remains 4 points higher than the previous year\u2019s Winter score. This stability may reflect improving trends: new and existing home sales gained momentum late in 2025, price appreciation slowed, and inventory increased\u2014favorable for fix-and-flip and rental investors. Despite optimism, 34% of investors plan to buy no properties in 2026, up from 32% previously. Among those buying, 46% plan 1\u20135 properties, 17% 6\u201310, and 4% 11 or more. Rental investors are more cautious than flippers: 45% plan no purchases vs. 26% of flippers. Flippers are more optimistic\u201452% expect improvement vs. 26% of rental investors. Over 57% of investors expect home prices to rise in six months; 65% of flippers and 56% of rental investors anticipate increases. Mortgage rates are expected to remain stable (44%) or decline (6% expect below 6%), down from 27% expecting rate increases. High financing costs remain the top challenge (58%), followed by rising prices (37%), limited inventory (29%), competition (29%), and material costs (27%). Insurance issues remain a major concern: 74% of investors cited insurance as a factor, and 53% said it caused missed deals\u2014higher among flippers (82% and 67%) than rental investors (63% and 32%). In high-risk states like California and Florida, insurance impacts were extreme: 100% of California flippers and 92.5% of Florida flippers factor insurance into decisions, with 80% and 77.5% missing deals, respectively. Immigration and tariff policies are having less impact: 43% of investors said immigration policies had no effect (up from 38%), and 29% said tariffs had no impact (up from 27%). However, flippers remain more affected than rental investors in both areas. Despite challenges, signs of stabilization and modest recovery are emerging, with fewer investors needing to lower prices and more reporting local market improvements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:01 PM\nSource:[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-estate-investors-optimistic-about-2026-housing-market-according-to-winter-2025-rcn-capital-investor-sentiment-survey-302676898.html)\n\n**Brazilians' Top Concerns at the Start of the Electoral Year, According to Ipsos**\nA recent Ipsos survey published on February 2, 2026, reveals that public safety remains the top concern for Brazilians, with 41% of mentions\u2014down from 45% in January 7 and 52% in November following the 'Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Conten\u00e7\u00e3o,' which resulted in 121 deaths in Rio de Janeiro. The data were collected between December 24 and January 9, 2026, via internet from approximately 1,000 interviews across 29 countries, with a margin of error of \u00b13.5 percentage points for Brazil. Health ranked second with 36%, followed by financial/political corruption and poverty/social inequality, both at 33%, and taxes at 28%. Inflation ranked sixth at 26%, while extremism growth reached only 9%. The total exceeds 100% because respondents were asked to list three issues. According to Diego Pagura, CEO of Ipsos Brazil, the decline in concern over public safety suggests a drop in the topic\u2019s intensity on the public agenda after a period of heightened visibility in late 2025. Health concerns rose by two points, indicating a shift toward issues with more direct daily impact. Corruption decreased by three points, reinforcing the perception that social demands are gaining prominence in the current political and social context.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:54 PM\nSource:[CartaCapital](https://www.cartacapital.com.br/politica/as-maiores-preocupacoes-dos-brasileiros-no-inicio-do-ano-eleitoral-segundo-a-ipsos/)\n\n**With Corruption Crisis, The Philippines\u2019 International Damage Is Soaring**\nA major corruption scandal in the Philippines, centered on flood control and mitigation projects under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), erupted in fall 2025 and has caused significant domestic and international damage. The country, already the world\u2019s most disaster-prone and highly vulnerable to climate extremes, saw billions in public funds allegedly misused through 'ghost' projects, inflated costs, and kickbacks to officials and contractors. Public trust has collapsed, with 90% of Filipinos believing top officials colluded to steal funds, leading to mass protests and high-profile resignations. Economic growth plummeted to a historical low of 4.4% in 2025, the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) ended the year in the red, and foreign direct investment (FDI) fell 25% year-on-year. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut interest rates to 4.75% in late 2025 to support growth amid deteriorating investor sentiment. Internationally, the Philippines ranked 114th out of 180 countries in the 2024/25 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), third in ASEAN, behind Laos and ahead of Sierra Leone and Angola. Illicit financial flows (IFFs) have been massive\u2014$410+ billion from 1960\u20132011 and $5.1 billion from 2008\u20132017. International investors, including the European and Nordic Chambers of Commerce, have criticized the country\u2019s governance, while media outlets like TIME, New York Times, and The Guardian reported globally on the scandal. Sovereign credit ratings are at risk: a potential upgrade from BBB+ to 'A' has been blocked, with Fitch warning of a possible downgrade if the crisis persists. Higher bond yields increase government borrowing costs, crowding out public spending on infrastructure, health, and education. The peso depreciated to 59 per USD\u201420% weaker than in the Duterte years (2016\u201322)\u2014and the stock market lost 1.7 trillion pesos ($29 billion) in October 2025. Multilateral institutions like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank may impose stricter conditions or freeze disbursements tied to ESG criteria, especially for climate adaptation funds. Three scenarios are possible: (1) a 'credible cleanup' with structural reforms, leading to credit upgrades and investment recovery\u2014least likely; (2) 'managed damage' with selective prosecutions and continued erosion\u2014most probable; (3) 'governance breakdown' with downgrades, exclusion from ESG funds, and aid suspension\u2014most severe. The outcome will shape the country\u2019s economic and political trajectory for decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:31 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Economics & Politics](https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/with-corruption-crisis-the-philippines-international-damage-is-soaring?post=554356)\n\n**Where The Best Golfers Lived in 2025 According To USGA Data**\nAccording to the United States Golf Association (USGA) data from 2025, Arkansas had the lowest average handicap index for male golfers, while Mississippi led for female golfers.

Hawaii ranked third-lowest for female golfers. Florida and California led in the number of recorded scores, with nearly 20 million total, followed by Texas, which ranked third in scores and had one of the lowest average handicaps.

A Pro\u00e9tica survey confirms that 88% of Peruvians believe corruption has increased over the past five years, and 81% expect it to remain the same or worsen in the next five. Alarmingly, 80% report that corruption directly affects their daily lives. These figures reflect a structural crisis in power, where the law is perceived as selectively applied by those in control. Condemnations of local, regional authorities, and members of the National Police confirm a systemic pattern. Corruption persists where accountability is absent\u2014where power operates without civic oversight. While judges and prosecutors play a vital role, the fight against corruption is fundamentally a civic duty. In a context of weakened institutions, citizen participation becomes indispensable. Peruvians must recognize that participation goes beyond voting\u2014it includes monitoring public management and demanding transparency. Tolerating corruption strengthens the system that enables it. The political crisis will not be resolved by new laws, a constitution, or elections alone, but by shifting the perception that corruption is inevitable. Thus, civic engagement is now more than ever a form of democratic resistance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:26 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/opinion/2026/02/02/participacion-ciudadana-es-necesaria-contra-la-corrupcion-163938)\n\n**Gochang County Aims for Top Integrity Rating with Anti-Corruption and Clean Government Orientation Meeting**\nOn February 2, 2026, Gochang County held a '2026 Anti-Corruption and Clean Government Policy Orientation Meeting' for all county employees, aiming to achieve the highest comprehensive integrity rating (Grade 1). The event, chaired by Governor Sim Deok-seop, included presentations on the National Commission on Public Integrity\u2019s public institution integrity evaluation, analysis of Gochang County\u2019s 2025 comprehensive integrity assessment results, key 2026 anti-corruption initiatives, departmental cooperation requirements, and discussions on vulnerable areas for corruption. Governor Sim emphasized strengthening anti-corruption education, self-inspections on compliance with anti-corruption laws, enhancing citizen rights protection systems such as the Citizen Happiness Complaint Counselor, and eliminating passive administrative practices. The county pledged to improve citizens\u2019 perception of integrity through expanded integrity campaigns and proactive communication, including sending integrity letters and messages during major public service initiatives. The goal is to realize the vision of 'Trustworthy Gochang' by earning the top integrity rating.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:58 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260202_0003499374)\n\n**More Justice, Less Impunity: The Reality Behind Spain\u2019s Anti-Corruption Efforts**\nA widespread perception in Spain is that the fight against corruption is selective and politically biased, with the concept of 'lawfare'\u2014originally promoted by the independence movement and leftist sectors, later adopted by the PSOE through amnesty\u2014used to question the legitimacy of uncomfortable investigations. However, data from the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) since 2015 reveal a different reality. Judicial activity against corruption has remained consistently high over time, with conviction rates exceeding 60% in most years\u2014indicating a system not driven by political whims. By early 2025, nearly 100 individuals were in prison or under preventive detention for corruption-related crimes, demonstrating tangible legal consequences. Furthermore, investigations and convictions span across multiple political parties, government levels, and administrations, with no persistent political bias evident\u2014e.g., a 2018 PP corruption case led to immediate political fallout, but subsequent major cases involved Socialist officials and non-partisan networks. The complexity of corruption networks, involving public contracts, businesses, and political actors, explains the expanding scope of investigations, which naturally uncover new links. The use of cooperation with justice\u2014offering reduced sentences in exchange for information\u2014is a standard legal tool, not a political instrument, with prosecutorial requests based on procedural incentives, not partisan loyalty. In conclusion, the CGPJ\u2019s data refute the existence of lawfare and confirm that Spain\u2019s justice system is increasingly active and intolerant of impunity, reflecting a broader application of the rule of law rather than partisan judicial use.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/opinion/20260202/justicia-corrupcion-impune-editorial-el-periodico-126330370)\n\n**Security, Corruption, and Cost of Living: The Challenges Facing Costa Rica\u2019s Next President**\nCosta Rica faces a critical political and security juncture ahead of its 2026 presidential election, as rising crime, corruption, and the cost of living challenge the nation's long-standing reputation for stability and democracy. Once celebrated for abolishing its military in 1948 and serving as a regional refuge, Costa Rica now struggles with a surge in organized crime, particularly as a transit hub for cocaine to the U.S. and Europe. Homicides rose from 603 in 2017 to 907 in 2023, making it the seventh most violent country in Latin America. The country\u2019s incarceration rate increased from 282 to 359 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2022 and 2025. Key events include the arrest of former Security Minister Celso Gamboa on drug charges and his potential extradition to the U.S., the assassination of Nicaraguan exile Roberto Samcam Ruiz in San Jos\u00e9, and President Rodrigo Chaves\u2019 unprecedented impeachment trial in the Legislative Assembly\u2014though it failed to reach the two-thirds threshold for removing his immunity. Despite a 71% public perception that security has worsened, Chaves\u2019 approval rating reached 63% in October 2025. His political heir, candidate Laura Fern\u00e1ndez, leads with 44% support, advocating for a 'hardline' approach including a Bukele-inspired mega-prison, increased penalties, and states of exception in high-crime areas. Critics, including \u00c1lvaro Ramos of the PLN and Claudia Dobles, argue for social investment and education over repression. Analysts like Tiziano Breda and Henry Ziemer note that the popularity of Bukele\u2019s security model, coupled with U.S. pressure under Trump, has driven a regional shift toward authoritarian-leaning policies. However, such measures have failed in Ecuador and Honduras, and may deepen Costa Rica\u2019s democratic erosion. The country\u2019s poverty rate stands at 15.2%, inequality remains high (second highest in Latin America by Gini index), and the cost of living is the second highest in the region. The tourism sector, vital to the economy, faces reputational risk due to declining safety perceptions. Once a green leader in conservation, Costa Rica has abandoned environmental priorities from its national agenda. Despite economic strength\u20144.2% GDP growth in 2025, inflation under control, and public debt below 60% of GDP\u2014structural weaknesses in social spending (down to 20.7% of GDP from 24.2% in 2020) and institutional trust have left the country vulnerable. The rise of populist security discourse, led by Chaves and Fern\u00e1ndez, signals a potential 'authoritarian transition' in a nation once ranked second in Latin America for democracy, according to The Economist\u2019s 2024 Democracy Index.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:30 PM\nSource:[LA TERCERA](https://www.latercera.com/mundo/noticia/seguridad-corrupcion-y-costo-de-la-vida-los-desafios-para-el-proximo-presidente-de-costa-rica/)\n\n**Corruption Unveiled: The Enduring Manicheanism of Power in the Dominican Republic**\nThe 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which evaluates 180 countries, confirms that institutional corruption has become deeply embedded in the social and economic structures of many nations, particularly in Latin America, severely hindering human development and public policy. The global average score remained around 43, with nearly 70% of countries scoring below 50. The Dominican Republic, despite improving from 28 points (rank 137 in 2020) to 36 points (rank 104 in 2024), still scores below the regional average of 42 points. The article attributes this to systemic impunity, driven by the long-standing political capture of the justice system, which consistently fails to deliver definitive convictions. Corruption has become the decisive factor in electoral campaigns for mayors, legislators, gremial leaders, social clubs, and even sex worker associations\u2014except for the 'Borinquen' bar in Herminia, humorously noted as an exception. The SENASA case exemplifies the systemic nature of corruption, which permeates the country\u2019s political, social, and business fabric. The author critiques the simplistic moral dichotomy of 'good vs. evil' or 'honest vs. corrupt' in politics, rejecting the narrative of 'heroic' opposition parties versus 'corrupt' ones, and instead highlights the cyclical, entrenched nature of corruption\u2014citing scandals like Tucano, Sun Land, Atiemar, UASD parking lots, National Lottery, Odebrecht, shadow tolls, unreviewed tax exemptions, electric subsidies, and marine animal mismanagement.

The CPI scores 180 countries and territories on public sector corruption perception, using data from 13 external sources, with scores ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). Italy's score places it approximately in the middle of the scale. The index reveals that corruption remains a dangerous global issue, with 32 countries reducing corruption since 2012, but 148 either stagnating or worsening. The global average score of 43 has remained unchanged for years, and over two-thirds of countries score below 50. Corruption is identified as a major threat to climate action, hindering emission reductions and adaptation efforts. The report also cites Libera's dossier 'Italia sotto mazzetta,' which reports 1,028 people indicted for corruption in 2025\u2014nearly double the number from the previous year. The United Nations established the first binding international legal instrument, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, on October 31, 2003.

More than two-thirds of countries score below 50, with a global average of about 43, reflecting corruption as a structural issue worldwide. High-income democracies in Western Europe, North America, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region dominate the top rankings, while low-income, conflict-affected, or authoritarian states cluster at the bottom. The CPI highlights stagnation or regression in many countries over the past decade, with weakened checks and balances and media freedom. Transparency International emphasizes that sustained political will\u2014through independent judiciaries, whistleblower protections, and limits on political financing\u2014is essential to maintain or improve scores.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 09, 2025 07:32 AM\nSource:[JagranJosh India](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/list-of-most-and-least-corrupt-nations-in-the-world-1820004747-1)\n\n**Mexico 2025: Corruption Continues as a Persistent Challenge**\nOn December 9, the United Nations designated the International Day Against Corruption. In response, Mexico's INEGI released the report 'Statistics for the International Day Against Corruption (December 9)', published on December 4, 2025. The report reveals that in the first half of 2025, 8.9% of adults who completed at least one government procedure were victims of corruption, with the highest rate in public security: 45.2% of those who interacted with police reported corruption. These figures come from the 2023 National Survey of Governmental Quality and Impact (ENCIG), which also reports an 8.9% rate of administrative corruption and significantly higher rates in public safety. In the private sector, the ENCIG 2023 found 169,769 companies affected by corruption\u20143.5% of all businesses\u2014with the highest prevalence among medium-sized enterprises (8.4%). For every microenterprise affected, 2.5 medium-sized enterprises face the same issue. According to the 2023 National Census of Federal Government (CNGF), 40,145 investigations were initiated for alleged administrative misconduct\u201424.8 per 1,000 public servants\u2014yet only 2,341 were sanctioned (14.4 per 10,000). The 2025 National Census of State Governments (CNGE) shows an 8.9% increase in administrative complaints between 2023 and 2024. Mexico and Campeche lead in sanctions, while Baja California Sur and Colima reported zero sanctions in 2023. The 'black number' is stark: ENCIG 2023 estimates that 95.2% of corruption acts go unreported, with only 4.8% of victims reporting to authorities. The 2025 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Security (ENVIPE) estimates that only 9.6% of crimes committed in 2024 were reported. Transparency International\u2019s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index gives Mexico 26 points out of 100, ranking it 140th out of 180 countries\u2014the worst in the OECD and second-to-last in the G20. Meanwhile, a November 2025 El Financiero survey shows President Claudia Sheinbaum with 70% approval, but around 80% disapproval for her handling of corruption. The data collectively depict a system entrenched in corruption: high incidence in public safety, significant costs for medium-sized firms, rare sanctions despite many investigations, black numbers exceeding 90%, declining international rankings, and a president with high general approval but low approval specifically on corruption. Three viable measures are proposed: banning cash payments for fines, mandating body cameras for police, linking the budgets and careers of oversight bodies to effective sanctions, and reducing discretion in procedures through digitalization, unified service windows, and protected reporting mechanisms. The article concludes that corruption can be reduced\u2014provided those in power choose to act.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 05:34 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/mexico-2025-corrupcion-siempre-20251204-789774.html)\n\n**Violations Worth Ten Billion Pounds at a State Bank in Syria - Enab Baladi**\nThe Central Authority for Supervision and Inspection revealed on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, that it uncovered violations and favoritism in cash disbursements at a public bank in Syria, without naming the institution. The irregularities involved unjustified exceptions in fund allocation, resulting in disbursements exceeding ten billion Syrian pounds (approximately 770,000 USD). In response, the authority suspended several employees, referred the cases for legal investigation, and proposed executive solutions to reduce crowding and ensure dignified pension delivery. The authority also reopened a corruption case tied to 'Syrian Airlines,' investigating embezzlement exceeding 13 billion Syrian pounds through fake airline tickets issued outside legal channels. A specialized team is probing a network within the airline that exploited electronic access to the central booking system to steal billions in Syrian and foreign currency. Former directors and a technical director of the airline have been summoned for testimony. Transparency International's 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Syria as the fourth most corrupt country globally with a score of 12 out of 100, a slight improvement from 2023 when it scored 13, though the organization noted that low scores are common among fragile, conflict-affected states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[Enab Baladi](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2025/10/violations-worth-ten-billion-pounds-at-a-state-bank-in-syria/)\n\n**Conventional anti-corruption tools often fail to address root causes - but loss of US leadership could still spell trouble for efforts abroad**\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which has prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from bribing foreign officials since 1977, is undergoing a shift under the Trump administration. In February 2025, an executive order froze new FCPA investigations for 180 days, citing concerns that the law harms American economic competitiveness. The Department of Justice\u2019s revised guidelines, issued in June 2025, now prioritize cases involving cartels, threats to U.S. companies\u2019 fair competition, or national security infrastructure. While these changes may not significantly increase global corruption levels, they risk undermining U.S. leadership in anti-corruption efforts. Despite decades of global anti-corruption progress\u2014including the U.N. Convention Against Corruption, widespread adoption of anti-corruption laws, and over US$7.5 billion in OECD aid since 2021\u2014corruption remains endemic in many countries. The 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index shows that two-thirds of nations scored below 50, with 148 countries either stagnating or worsening since 2012. Conventional tools like asset declarations, oversight, and criminal penalties often fail because they target 'bad apples' rather than systemic issues. In contexts of endemic corruption, corruption is not an exception but a normalized, networked practice embedded in politics and economics. Key reasons for failure include: (1) individuals lack incentive to follow rules when others do not; (2) corruption serves functional roles, such as supplementing low salaries or maintaining political stability; and (3) informal social networks override formal institutions. Effective anti-corruption efforts now require addressing root causes\u2014such as low pay, weak institutions, and social norms\u2014through innovative approaches like peer monitoring, horizontal accountability, and norm change. While reduced FCPA enforcement alone may not worsen global corruption, the loss of U.S. leadership could stall progress. Moreover, a shift toward self-serving enforcement risks weaponizing anti-corruption laws, as seen in authoritarian states targeting political opponents, thereby undermining global norms and fueling democratic backsliding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:44 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/conventional-anti-corruption-tools-often-fail-to-address-root-causes-but-loss-of-us-leadership-could-still-spell-trouble-for-efforts-abroad-263894)\n\n**#REFLEX\u00d5ES - (DES)HONESTIDADE - Jeferson Francisco Selbach**\nTransparency International\u2019s 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index gives Brazil a score of 34 points, the lowest in the series and placing it 107th out of 180 countries.  The top of the list is occupied by Denmark (90), Finland (88), Singapore (84), New\u202fZealand (83) and Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland (81 each).  Brazil\u2019s poor score is linked to the rollback of Operation\u202fLava\u2011Jato, the rise of organized crime, and systemic capture across the executive, legislative and judicial branches.  Examples cited include the renegotiation of leniency agreements for companies involved in corruption, judges with relatives in judicial lobbying, and the diversion of INSS pension funds.  The article also highlights a fuel\u2011sector scheme run by PCC members that laundered more than R$30\u202fbillion through investment funds on Faria\u202fLima.  Cybercrime is another concern: Brazil is the world\u2019s second\u2011largest target with 1,379 attacks per minute, 90\u202f% of which are phishing.  Despite these negative indicators, the author notes that most Brazilians remain honest, earning a dignified livelihood and not exploiting others for personal gain.  A quoted line from Chico\u202fXavier reads: 'O mundo n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos espertos'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[ocorreio.com.br](https://ocorreio.com.br/reflexoes-deshonestidade-jeferson-francisco-selbach/)\n\n**Belgium drops in Transparency International global corruption index**\nBelgium has dropped outside the top 20 in Transparency International\u2019s (TI) 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index, falling to a score of 69, down from previous years. The index, which rates countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very transparent), aggregates data from 13 global sources including the World Bank, OECD, and Council of Europe. Marc Beyens, deputy director of TI Belgium, stated that public perception indicates a decline in government integrity, citing ongoing judicial investigations into former EU Commissioner Didier Reynders for alleged money laundering. The report notes that while 19 other Western European countries also saw score declines, nations with stricter transparency rules, strong whistleblower protections, and robust financial controls\u2014such as Denmark, Finland, and Singapore\u2014rank higher. Beyens emphasized that transparency, accountability, and integrity are essential for democracy and economic strength, adding that the current Belgian coalition agreement contains no mention of integrity or corruption. The decline follows a Eurobarometer survey from summer 2024 showing public concerns about misuse of public funds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 07:24 AM\nSource:[belganewsagency.eu](https://www.belganewsagency.eu/belgium-drops-in-transparency-international-global-corruption-index)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
