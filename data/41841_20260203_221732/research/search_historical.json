The only relevant data point for the forecasting question is the mention that the U.S. ranks 25th-least corrupt globally according to CPI, though the specific year and score are not provided.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.worlddata.info/america/usa/corruption.php\">\n# Summary of Article from Worlddata.info\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**2024 CPI Score:**\n- The United States scored 65 points on the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (note: the article initially presents this inverted as 35 points for easier visualization, but clarifies the official score is 65)\n- The U.S. ranked 28th globally\n- Denmark led with the best score (10 points in inverted scale/90 official)\n- South Sudan ranked last (92 points inverted/8 official)\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n- Compared to 2023, corruption in the U.S. \"slightly raised\" in 2024\n- Long-term trend shows corruption has \"risen moderately in recent years\"\n\n**Historical Data (Official Scores - Inverted in Article):**\nThe article provides a complete table from 2003-2024 showing:\n- 2024: 35 (inverted) = 65 official\n- 2023: 31 (inverted) = 69 official\n- 2022: 31 (inverted) = 69 official\n- 2021: 33 (inverted) = 67 official\n- 2020: 33 (inverted) = 67 official\n- [Additional years listed back to 2003]\n\n**Contextual Information:**\n- U.S. per capita income: $83,490 USD annually (described as \"extremely high by global standards\")\n- U.S. government type: Federal presidential constitutional republic\n- Average corruption for Americas region (2024): 44.7 (inverted)\n- Worldwide average (2024): 57.3 (inverted)\n\n**Recent Corruption Scandals Mentioned (unnamed source - article's own compilation):**\n- Donald Trump: indicted for election interference (2016) and obstruction\n- Duncan Hunter: convicted for embezzlement of campaign funds\n- Catherine Pugh (Baltimore mayor): charged with bribery and tax evasion\n- Ray Nagin (New Orleans mayor): convicted of bribery and corruption\n\n**Note:** The article inverts the official CPI scoring system for visualization purposes, which may cause confusion when comparing to official Transparency International data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ti-corruption-perception-index\">\n## Summary of Article from Our World in Data\n\n### Key Facts about the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI):\n\n**Methodology:**\n- The CPI ranks countries based on **perceived** levels of public sector corruption as judged by experts and business leaders\n- Combines data from **up to 13 independent sources** (depending on the country), including expert assessments and business surveys from trusted institutions\n- Each source is converted to a **scale from 0 to 100**, where 0 = very corrupt and 100 = very clean\n- A country's CPI score is the **simple average** of all available sources for that year\n- The methodology has **remained consistent since 2012**, allowing for comparisons over time\n\n**Important Limitations:**\n- The CPI **does not measure corruption directly**\u2014it measures perceptions only\n- This approach is used because there are no fully objective national measures of corruption\n- The CPI includes a **90% confidence interval** (margin of error) to reflect differences between sources and possible inconsistencies\n\n**Data Source Information:**\n- Published by Transparency International\n- Data is processed and made available through Our World in Data under Creative Commons BY license\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article is a methodological description of how the CPI is calculated and does not contain specific predictions, opinions, or statistics about the United States' 2025 score.

The 2023 score (published Jan 2024) is therefore the most recent value available.\n\nOver the 2012-2023 window the United States has lost four points overall (\u20135 % on the 0-100 scale) and has slipped from the global top-20 to 26th place. The sharpest deterioration came in 2018-2020, when rule-of-law indicators and oversight safeguards weakened, according to TI\u2019s source surveys.\n\nHow the United States stacks up against selected OECD peers in the latest index (2023)  \n\u2022 Denmark 90, Finland 87, New Zealand 87 \u2013 global leaders  \n\u2022 Australia 75, Germany 78, Canada 76 \u2013 7-10 points ahead of the U.S.  \n\u2022 United Kingdom 71, France 71 \u2013 2 points above the U.S.  \n\u2022 Japan 73, South Korea 63, Italy 60 \u2013 mixed performance  \nWith a score of 69 the U.S. sits in the middle of the OECD pack and 10+ points below the Nordic benchmark. (dataset: Transparency International via Our World in Data)\n\nKey U.S. reforms and scandals in 2024-25 that could influence the 2025 CPI\n\nPotential upward pressure (reforms):  \n1. \u201cDrain the Swamp Act\u201d \u2013 Rep. Ro Khanna announced draft legislation in March 2025 to:  \n   \u2022 make the Biden-era lobbyist-gift ban statutory and permanent;  \n   \u2022 impose lifetime lobbying bans on ex-members of Congress;  \n   \u2022 bar members and their families from trading individual stocks;  \n   \u2022 create 12-year congressional term limits and 18-year Supreme Court term limits; and  \n   \u2022 establish a binding Supreme Court code of ethics (ABC News, Mar 2025).  \n   If the bill gains bipartisan traction it would address several CPI data-source concerns\u2014revolving-door lobbying and asset-disclosure loopholes.\n\n2. Ongoing executive-branch ethics rules. Although President Biden\u2019s day-one ethics executive order expires with his term, it remains in force through 2024 and continues to restrict lobbyist appointments and gift acceptance.\n\n3. Federal Trade Commission fraud-recovery drive. The FTC reported a record US$12.5 billion in consumer fraud losses for 2024 (+25 % y/y) and is using the data to bolster enforcement (FTC press release, Mar 2025). Stronger consumer-protection enforcement is one of the indicators monitored by TI\u2019s sources.\n\nPotential downward pressure (scandals & governance concerns):  \n1. Albuquerque Police Department (APD) DWI-unit bribery case \u2013 a \u201cdecades-long corruption scandal\u201d led to federal racketeering pleas in 2024 and mass case dismissals (City Desk ABQ, Jan 2026). While local, the scandal received national coverage and underscores weaknesses in sub-national law-enforcement integrity\u2014an area covered by several CPI sources.\n\n2. Congressional insider-trading and Supreme Court gift-disclosure controversies persisted through 2024, with no statutory fixes enacted. Source surveys continually flag these issues when rating U.S. public-sector integrity.\n\n3. Perceptions of impunity for high-level officials: continuing political battles over enforcement of ethics subpoenas and use of presidential clemency may weigh on expert perceptions.\n\nNet outlook for the 2025 CPI score  \n\u2022 If Khanna\u2019s package or any portion of it is enacted in 2025, coupled with newly proposed bipartisan stock-trading bans, the United States could regain 1-2 points.  \n\u2022 Failure to legislate structural reforms, combined with further high-profile state- or federal-level scandals, would likely keep the score flat in the high-60s or push it lower.  \n\u2022 Because CPI methodology uses a three-year moving window, reforms (or scandals) in 2024-25 will only gradually feed into the 2025 and 2026 scores.\n\nContextual comparison to inflation-adjusted peer performance  \nSeveral OECD countries that historically scored below the U.S. have overtaken it since 2018 (e.g., France and the U.K.). Others, such as Canada and Germany, maintain mid-70 scores despite facing similar lobbying and money-in-politics challenges, suggesting space for the U.S. to recover with credible reforms.\n\nInformation gaps identified  \n1. The exact 2024 CPI score will not be available until TI\u2019s January 2025 release.  \n2. Up-to-date U.S. legislative tracking on the \u201cDrain the Swamp Act\u201d and parallel stock-trading-ban bills will be needed to refine the outlook once Congress acts.  \n3. Additional nationwide scandals (e.g., campaign-finance violations, federal procurement fraud) could emerge in late-2024; monitoring reputable investigative outlets would be prudent.\n\nOverall, the data show a modest long-term U.S. decline contrasted with sustained Nordic leadership and a tightening cluster of OECD peers. The legislative agenda now on the table directly targets problem areas highlighted by CPI source surveys; its fate will largely determine whether the U.S. can reverse its slide in the 2025-26 index rounds.</Agent_report>\n"
