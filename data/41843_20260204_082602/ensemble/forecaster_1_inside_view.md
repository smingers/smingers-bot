16. **AZAL transport projection (Oct 1, 2025)** - States road transport contributes ~15% of global carbon emissions, ~75% of transport emissions. Warns Eurasia transport emissions could rise 30% by 2030. Expert opinion but forward-looking, moderate quality.

17. **UN Environment report (Nov 8, 2025)** - 2024 global GHG at record 57.7 Gt CO2eq (+3% vs 2023). Transport 15% of total (8.4 Gt), with road vehicles >10% of global emissions. Aviation grew fastest at 6.3%. High quality UN data.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **2020 COVID baseline drop**: Multiple independent sources (Nature, Portuguese article, Global Carbon Budget) confirm global emissions dropped 5.6-8.8% in 2020, with ground transport heavily affected by lockdowns. This establishes the starting point as abnormally LOW.

2. **Recovery pattern 2021-2022**: Global Carbon Budget shows strong recovery (+5.4% in 2021, +1.9% in 2022 for total emissions). This indicates the V-shaped recovery pattern.

3. **2023-2025 stagnation/slow growth**: Global Carbon Budget 2025 shows overall fossil fuel growth slowing to +0.1% (2023), +0.9% (2024), +0.6% (2025). Oil specifically (primary transport fuel) grew only +1% in 2025. This is MUCH slower than pre-2020 trends.

4. **Regional ground transport stagnation**: Singapore reports continued decline in petrol/diesel; Belgium shows diesel down 22% since 2020 despite gasoline up; Austria notes slowdown in transport emission cuts. Pattern of developed economies showing minimal growth or decline.

**Moderate Evidence:**

5. **EV adoption acceleration**: Beijing reached 50% EV share (from 5% in 2020); China HDT electrification advancing. However, global fleet turnover is slow - EVs still <10% globally in 2025.

6. **Aviation vs ground transport divergence**: Multiple sources show aviation growing 6-7% while ground transport stagnates. This suggests modal differences in recovery.

7. **Developing economy growth**: India +1.4%, China +0.4% in fossil emissions. Some growth in developing regions but moderate.

**Weak Evidence:**

8. Future policy projections (T&E reports) - not relevant to historical 2020-2025 period.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 60 months (Jan 2020 - Dec 2025). Question opened Feb 4, 2026; period has ENDED but data unpublished.

**Key temporal factors:**
- 2020 (12 months): Severe disruption, partial year impact (COVID hit March-April)
- 2021-2022 (24 months): Strong recovery phase
- 2023-2025 (36 months): Stabilization/slow growth phase

**If timeframe halved (30 months, 2020-mid 2023)**: Would capture full COVID drop + strong recovery = likely NEGATIVE overall (recovery incomplete).

**If timeframe doubled (120 months, 2020-2030)**: Would show full recovery + return to growth trend = likely POSITIVE (5-10 years allows structural changes).

The 60-month window captures the complete disruption-recovery cycle, landing near the equilibrium point.

### (d) Justification and Base Rate Calibration

**Target variable check**: Total percentage change in ground transportation sector CO2 emissions globally, January 2020 to December 2025, per Carbon Monitor data.

**Outside view base rate recap**: Centered near 0% with range -15% to +10%, reflecting COVID disruption followed by incomplete recovery.

**Evidence-driven adjustments:**

1. **2020 baseline was abnormally low** (Strong evidence): If we use January 2020 as baseline (pre-COVID), the drop happened DURING 2020, then recovery followed. The question asks for change from Jan 2020 to Dec 2025.

2. **Oil consumption grew only +1% in 2025** (Strong evidence): This is the primary transport fuel. Slow growth in 2025 suggests we're near pre-COVID levels but not significantly above.

3. **Ground transport behaves differently than aviation** (Strong evidence): Aviation rebounded sharply (+6-7%), but ground transport shows stagnation in multiple regions. This suggests ground transport recovery was more complete but plateaued.

4. **Structural factors**: EV adoption, efficiency gains, behavioral changes post-COVID (remote work) all suppress growth. However, developing economy vehicle growth provides upward pressure.

**Revised scenario modeling:**

Starting at 100 (Jan 2020):
- **2020 average**: ~92 (drop concentrated in Q2-Q4, so annual average ~8% below baseline)
- **2021**: ~99 (strong recovery, +7.6%)
- **2022**: ~101 (+2%)
- **2023**: ~101 (+0%)
- **2024**: ~102 (+1%)
- **2025**: ~103 (+1%)

This suggests **+3% overall change** from Jan 2020 to Dec 2025.

However, uncertainty factors:
- Exact monthly timing of 2020 drop vs Jan baseline
- Regional variation (China/India growth vs EU/US stagnation)
- Data gaps for developing world
- ±6% measurement uncertainty in EDGAR

**Distribution calibration:**

The evidence suggests we've recovered from COVID and are slightly above 2020 baseline, but not dramatically. The most likely outcome is **SMALL POSITIVE** (+1% to +5%), with tails extending to:
- Negative tail: If 2020 drop was concentrated early and recovery was incomplete
- Positive tail: If developing world growth exceeded developed world stagnation

Given the evidence strength and convergence across sources, I'm moderating the confidence intervals somewhat from the initial outside view.

### Quality Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: % change global ground transport CO2, Jan 2020 - Dec 2025 (60 months)

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view centered near 0%; revised to +2-3% based on evidence of recovery + modest growth. Shift justified by strong evidence of recovery pattern.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ +2%; mean ≈ +2.5%. This makes sense: full recovery from COVID drop + slight growth in developing economies, offset by developed economy stagnation.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - 2020 COVID drop of 5-8% established by multiple sources
   - Recovery pattern +5.4% (2021), +1.9% (2022) from Global Carbon Budget
   - 2023-2025 slow growth: oil +1%/year, overall fossil +0.1-0.9%/year
   - Regional data showing developed economy stagnation (Singapore, Austria, Belgium)
   - EV adoption accelerating but still <10% of global fleet

5. **Blind spot**: If developing world (especially China, India, Southeast Asia, Africa) ground transport grew much faster than captured in aggregate fossil fuel data, actual change could be +5-8%. This would push outcome HIGHER. Conversely, if 2020 baseline (January) was already affected by early COVID impacts in China, actual drop could be smaller, pushing outcome LOWER.

### Final Prediction

The evidence strongly suggests ground transportation emissions recovered from the 2020 COVID shock and ended 2025 slightly above January 2020 levels. The convergence of:
- Global fossil fuel growth slowing to <1%/year
- Oil (transport fuel) growing only +1% in 2025
- Regional developed economy stagnation
- Developing economy modest growth (+0.4-1.4%)
- Structural headwinds (EVs, efficiency, remote work)

...points to a small positive outcome. However, substantial uncertainty remains around:
- Exact 2020 baseline timing
- Developing world data quality
- Measurement uncertainty (±6%)

I'm setting a distribution with median around +2%, with 90/10 range from -8% to +12% to reflect:
- 10th percentile: Scenario where recovery was incomplete or 2020 drop extended into 2021
- 90th percentile: Scenario where developing world growth was stronger than apparent in aggregate data
