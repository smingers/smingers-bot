Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Climate TRACE (climatetrace.org):**
Platform description dated before Feb 2026. Describes capabilities of tracking 744M+ emitting assets across 10 sectors with 2015-2025 historical data. High-quality technical platform but this page provides no specific emission values. Factual information about capabilities only.

**Carbon Monitor (carbonmonitor.org):**
Data policy page only, no substantive emissions data. Confirms it's the resolution source for this question. Notes data is "living" and subject to updates. Important: this is where final answer will come from but provides no current values.

**NOAA CarbonTracker (gml.noaa.gov):**
Dated content covering 2000-2020 period. High-quality scientific source from NOAA, but focuses on overall CO2 fluxes (fossil fuels, wildfires, ocean/land sinks) without sector breakdowns. Does not isolate ground transportation. Provides baseline context but not directly applicable.

**CREA EU Report (energyandcleanair.org):**
Published January 29, 2026 - this is CURRENT/RECENT data. High credibility research organization. **Critical finding**: EU transportation emissions were essentially unchanged at -0.1% in 2025. Notes that "rising transport oil consumption has pushed EU's total emissions off track" and "transportation emissions were essentially unchanged." This is expert analysis with specific 2025 data, though EU-only.

**EIA September 2025 Article (eia.gov/todayinenergy):**
Published Sept 15, 2025. Official U.S. government data. Notes U.S. transportation sector peaked in 2007, declined slower than power sector. Transportation fuel mix "remained relatively steady" despite EVs. Forecasts slight 1% increase in total U.S. CO2 for 2025. U.S.-specific but authoritative.

**EIA 2024 Emissions Report (eia.gov/environment):**
Recent U.S. data for 2024. States U.S. transportation sector emissions "remained virtually unchanged in 2024." Motor gasoline +1%, jet fuel +3%, diesel -3%. Notes vehicle fuel economy and EVs providing modest declines over 20 years. U.S.-specific, high quality.

**Agent Report on EDGAR Data:**
Highly detailed analysis of EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) - the authoritative global emissions database. Key facts:
- EDGAR 2024 release covers through 2023
- EDGAR 2025 release (Oct 2025) covers through 2024
- Defines ground transport as Road (1.A.3.b) + Rail (1.A.3.c) + Pipelines (1.A.3.d)
- 2025 data won't be available until Q4 2026
- Road transport has ±6% uncertainty at 95% confidence
- This is the gold-standard source for global sectoral emissions

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Global ground transportation emissions 2010-2020:** Most relevant. Transportation emissions grew steadily pre-2020, then COVID caused sharp 2020 drop, followed by recovery.

2. **Regional transportation trends (EU, U.S.) 2020-2025:** Available data shows near-zero growth. EU: -0.1% in 2025, U.S.: "virtually unchanged" 2024.

3. **Overall energy-related CO2 2020-2025:** Less suitable - transportation behaves differently than power sector (slower decarbonization).

**Best reference class:** Global ground transportation 2010-2020 with adjustment for COVID disruption and recovery patterns, supplemented by regional 2024-2025 data showing stagnation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** January 2020 to December 2025 (5-year period). Question opened Feb 4, 2026, resolves March 1, 2026. We're forecasting a period that has ALREADY ENDED but data isn't published yet.

**Historical patterns:**
- 2010-2019: Global ground transport emissions grew ~1.5-2% annually
- 2020: COVID caused sharp drop (~10-15% based on various mobility data)
- 2021-2022: Strong recovery as mobility returned
- 2023-2024: Regional data shows stagnation (EU: -0.1%, U.S.: ~0%)
- 2025: EU data confirms -0.1%, suggesting minimal change globally

**Key factors over 2020-2025:**
- COVID disruption in 2020 (major negative)
- Recovery 2021-2022 (positive)
- EV adoption accelerating but still <5% of global fleet (minimal impact)
- Fuel efficiency improvements gradual (~1-2% per year)
- Freight and passenger travel recovering to/exceeding 2019 levels
- Economic growth in developing nations driving vehicle use

## (d) Justification

The question asks for TOTAL CHANGE 2020→2025, not annual rate.

**Baseline scenario (pre-COVID trend):** 5 years × 1.75% annual growth = ~9% increase

**COVID adjustment:** 
- 2020: -12% (sharp drop)
- 2021: +8% (strong recovery)
- 2022: +4% (continued recovery)
- 2023: +1% (normalization)
- 2024: 0% (stagnation per U.S./EU data)
- 2025: 0% (stagnation per EU data)

**Compounded effect:** Starting at 100 in Jan 2020:
- End 2020: 88
- End 2021: 95
- End 2022: 99
- End 2023: 100
- End 2024: 100
- End 2025: 100

This suggests ~0% net change, possibly slight negative.

**Critical considerations:**
1. Regional data (EU, U.S.) shows 2024-2025 stagnation
2. COVID created unusual V-shaped pattern
3. EV adoption and efficiency gains offset growth pressures
4. Developing world growth may differ from developed world stagnation
5. EDGAR has ±6% uncertainty, meaning small changes are within error bars

**Expert opinion:** CREA report explicitly states transportation is "off track" and "unchanged," indicating disappointment that emissions aren't declining faster but also confirming stagnation rather than growth.

Outside view calibration:

The 2020 COVID shock followed by recovery creates high uncertainty. The most likely outcome is near-zero change (-5% to +5%) because:
- Deep 2020 drop was largely recovered by 2023
- 2024-2025 shows stagnation in major economies
- Global fleet turnover is slow; EVs remain small fraction
- Efficiency gains roughly offset any growth

However, significant uncertainty exists:
- Developing world data may differ substantially from EU/U.S.
- Exact 2020 baseline depends on when COVID impacts hit
- Recovery timing varied by region
- China and India transportation growth patterns unclear

The distribution should be:
- Centered near 0% (most likely: slight recovery doesn't fully offset 2020 drop)
- Modest negative tail (if 2020 drop wasn't fully recovered)
- Modest positive tail (if recovery overshot and growth continued)
- Wide confidence intervals due to data gaps and regional variation

Given ±6% EDGAR uncertainty and the unusual COVID pattern, a 90/10 range of approximately -15% to +10% seems appropriate, with central tendency slightly negative.
