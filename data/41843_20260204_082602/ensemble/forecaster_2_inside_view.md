# Forecast Analysis: Global Ground Transportation CO₂ Emissions Change 2020-2025

## Forecasting Checklist (Brief Version)

**1. Target Variable:** Percentage change in global ground transportation sector CO₂ emissions from January 2020 to December 2025, measured via Carbon Monitor.

**2. Outside View Base Rate:** Reference class of 5-year global ground transport changes yields mean ≈ +2%, σ ≈ 9%. However, 2020 was pandemic-depressed (~10% below 2019), creating strong rebound potential.

**3. Consistency Check:** My final distribution has implied median ≈ +10%, mean ≈ +10%. This aligns with: pandemic rebound from depressed 2020 base + modest EV penetration offsetting growth in emerging markets.

**4. Top Evidence Pieces:**
- 2020 pandemic created ~10% drop vs 2019 baseline (strong rebound effect)
- Global EV market share rose 5%→17% (2020-2025), dampening growth
- Emerging market freight/transport demand continued growing 2021-2025
- EU/US ground transport essentially flat 2024-2025 per recent data
- Global fossil CO₂ up +1.1% in 2025 but aviation grew 6.8% (ground transport likely slower)

**5. Blind-spot:** If 2025 preliminary Carbon Monitor data contains major upward revisions due to underestimated emerging market freight growth or biofuel accounting changes, outcome could reach +15-18%. This would push distribution rightward.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence (Large Weight)

1. **2020 Pandemic Baseline Effect:** Multiple sources confirm 2020 saw ~8-10% drop in ground transport vs 2019 due to lockdowns. This creates a mechanically depressed baseline, making positive percentage change highly likely even with modest absolute growth. *Causal mechanism: mathematical base effect.*

2. **EV Market Penetration:** Beijing (50% new sales), global light-duty rising from ~5% (2020) to 14-17% (2024-2025). This directly reduces gasoline/diesel consumption in new fleet. Historical data shows ~4% cumulative emission reduction effect by 2025. *Causal: direct fuel substitution.*

3. **Global Fossil CO₂ Growth Pattern:** Authoritative Global Carbon Budget shows +1.1% fossil CO₂ in 2025, with oil +1.0%. Since ground transport is ~60% of oil use, this constrains ground transport growth to roughly 0-2% range in 2025 vs 2024. *Strong structural constraint.*

### Moderate Evidence (Moderate Weight)

4. **Regional Heterogeneity:** China +0.4%, India +1.4%, US +1.9%, EU +0.4% (2025 fossil emissions). Emerging markets continuing growth, developed markets flat/declining. Ground transport likely mirrors this pattern. *Logical inference from aggregate data.*

5. **Aviation vs Ground Transport Divergence:** Aviation grew 6.8% in 2025, while ground transport likely much slower given fuel consumption data (Belgium stable, Singapore declining). Suggests saturation in developed markets. *Indirect indicator.*

6. **ICCT Expert Opinion:** Peak emissions "as soon as 2025" suggests 2020-2025 saw growth but flattening. Aligns with rebound-then-plateau narrative. *Expert forecast with methodological basis.*

### Weak Evidence (Small Weight)

7. **City/Country-Specific Data:** Beijing, Belgium, Singapore, Austria data are informative but represent <5% of global ground transport. Extrapolation risk high. *Limited geographic scope.*

8. **Policy Uncertainty:** EU regulatory changes affect future trajectory more than 2020-2025 historical outcome. *Forward-looking, not backward-looking.*

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 2020 (Jan) to 2025 (Dec) = 60 months. The outcome is **fully determined**—we are forecasting historical data that will be published in ~1 month (March 2026 per resolution criteria).

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- 2020: Pandemic trough (Q2-Q3 especially depressed)
- 2021: Sharp rebound as lockdowns lifted
- 2022-2023: Continued recovery + emerging market growth
- 2024-2025: Plateau in developed markets, continued EM growth, accelerating EV adoption

**If Timeframe Halved (2020-2022.5):** Would capture only rebound phase, likely +8-12% as 2021-2022 saw strong recovery. Less EV penetration impact.

**If Timeframe Doubled (2020-2030):** Would include full EV transition effects and potential peak/decline. Likely +5-10% as 2025-2030 could see absolute declines offsetting 2020-2025 growth.

## (d) Justification & Calibration

### Starting Point: Outside View
Reference class (5-year ground transport changes): mean +2%, σ 9%.
- 2005-2010: +11%
- 2010-2015: +3%
- 2015-2020: -7%

### Key Adjustments from Base Rate

**Major Upward Adjustment (+9 percentage points):**
The 2020 baseline is **anomalously low** due to pandemic. EDGAR/Carbon Monitor data shows:
- 2019 ground transport: ~6.4 Gt CO₂
- 2020 ground transport: ~5.8 Gt CO₂ (-10%)
- Expected 2025: ~6.4-6.5 Gt CO₂

This creates a **mechanical rebound effect**. Even if 2025 equals 2019 (zero absolute growth over 6 years), the percentage change vs 2020 is +10%.

**Moderate Downward Adjustment (-2 percentage points):**
- EV penetration (5%→17% global light-duty share) reduces fuel demand by ~4% cumulatively
- OECD markets show flat/declining trend (EU -0.1%, US +1% in 2025)
- Efficiency improvements continue at ~1-2%/year

**Net Adjustment:** +7 percentage points from base rate mean.

### Final Distribution Reasoning

**Central Tendency (+9 to +11%):**
- 2025 ground transport likely at ~6.4 Gt (roughly matching 2019)
- This represents +10% vs 2020's 5.8 Gt
- Global Carbon Budget oil +1.0% in 2025 supports modest absolute growth
- ICCT "peak in 2025" aligns with 2025 ≈ 2019 level

**Uncertainty Bounds:**
- **Data revision uncertainty:** ±1-2 percentage points (Carbon Monitor living dataset)
- **Model uncertainty:** ±6-10% per Nature paper, but percentage change less sensitive
- **Demand surprises:** 
  - Downside: Faster EV adoption than captured, emerging market slowdown → +5%
  - Upside: Underestimated freight growth, biofuel accounting issues → +15%

**Distribution Shape:**
Slightly right-skewed due to:
1. Rebound from 2020 trough creates floor around +5%
2. Emerging market growth could surprise upward
3. Developed market declines well-documented, limiting downside

### Calibrated Percentiles

Using log-normal approximation centered at +10% with σ ≈ 4.5%:

- **10th percentile:** Strong EV impact + EM slowdown → **+2%**
- **20th percentile:** Moderate EV impact, weak EM growth → **+5%**  
- **40th percentile:** Base rebound, modest absolute growth → **+8%**
- **60th percentile:** Full rebound to 2019 level → **+11%**
- **80th percentile:** Rebound + EM freight growth → **+14%**
- **90th percentile:** Strong EM growth + data revisions → **+17%**

**Consistency Check:**
- Implied median ≈ +9.5%
- Implied mean ≈ +10%
- 80% confidence interval: +2% to +17% (15 percentage point range)
- Aligns with: pandemic rebound + modest EV offset + emerging market growth

**Comparison to Outside View:**
My distribution is shifted +8 percentage points right from reference class mean (+2%), justified by the unique 2020 pandemic baseline. The 2015-2020 period (-7%) included a similar pandemic effect, validating that 2020 is an appropriate low anchor for rebound.
