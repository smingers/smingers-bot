## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Global ground transportation emissions 2010-2020:** Most suitable - same sector, global scope
2. **Regional transportation trends (EU, U.S.) 2020-2025:** Moderately suitable - provides directional insight but limited geographic coverage
3. **Overall energy-related CO2 emissions 2020-2025:** Less suitable - different sectoral dynamics
4. **Transportation emissions during previous economic disruptions:** Relevant for understanding 2020 COVID impact

**Chosen reference class: Global ground transportation emissions trends 2010-2020**

Historical context from sources:
- U.S. transportation emissions peaked in 2007, then declined modestly over 20 years
- Despite increased vehicle miles traveled, motor gasoline emissions declined due to fuel economy standards and EVs
- Transportation sector emissions decline slower than electric power sector
- 2020 was anomalous due to COVID-19 lockdowns (significant temporary drop)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 5-year period (Jan 2020 - Dec 2025), with resolution in March 2026

**Key temporal factors:**
1. **2020 baseline:** COVID-19 caused unprecedented temporary drop in transportation emissions (estimated 10-15% globally during lockdowns)
2. **2021-2022:** Recovery phase as economies reopened
3. **2023-2024:** Return toward normal patterns with gradual electrification
4. **2025:** Final year, data not yet available from EDGAR

**Historical patterns from sources:**
- EU 2025: Transportation -0.1% (essentially flat)
- U.S. 2024: Transportation "virtually unchanged"
- U.S. 2023-2025 forecast: +1% total emissions (includes all sectors)
- Long-term U.S. trend: Modest decline due to efficiency and EVs, but slower than other sectors

**Critical consideration:** The question asks for change from 2020 to 2025. If 2020 was artificially depressed due to COVID, the 2020-2025 change could show:
- Scenario A: Net increase if 2020 was exceptionally low and 2025 represents recovery
- Scenario B: Modest increase/flat if 2020 was only moderately affected and structural trends (EVs, efficiency) offset growth
- Scenario C: Decrease if 2020 was relatively normal and efficiency gains dominate

## (d) Justification

**Integrating factors:**

1. **2020 baseline ambiguity:** The biggest uncertainty is how much 2020 was affected by COVID. Global ground transportation likely dropped 5-10% in 2020 vs. 2019 trend, then recovered 2021-2022.

2. **Structural trends (downward pressure):**
   - EV adoption accelerating globally (though still <10% of fleet)
   - Fuel efficiency standards improving
   - Some modal shift and remote work persistence
   - EU and U.S. data show flat to slight decline in recent years

3. **Growth pressures (upward pressure):**
   - Global economic growth 2020-2025
   - Developing economies increasing vehicle ownership
   - Freight transport growth with e-commerce
   - Recovery from 2020 COVID suppression

4. **Regional evidence:**
   - EU 2025: -0.1% (essentially flat)
   - U.S. 2024: Virtually unchanged
   - These suggest mature economies are plateauing

5. **Data quality concerns:**
   - EDGAR has ±6% uncertainty
   - Carbon Monitor data is "living" and subject to revision
   - 2025 data won't be finalized until late 2026

**Most likely scenario:** Given that 2020 was COVID-affected (artificially low), and 2021-2025 represents recovery plus modest structural efficiency gains, the net change 2020-2025 is likely a **small to moderate increase** (positive percentage). However, if 2020 was less affected than assumed, or if structural trends are stronger, it could be flat or slightly negative.

**Base rate estimate:** +2% to +8% seems most plausible for the central range, with:
- Lower tail: -5% if 2020 was relatively normal and efficiency gains are strong
- Upper tail: +15% if 2020 was severely depressed and recovery is complete with little efficiency offset

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**

1. **COVID recovery dynamics:** Most transportation metrics recovered to 2019 levels by 2022-2023. If 2020 was 8-10% below trend and 2025 is at trend, that's +8-10% over the period.

2. **Structural decline rate:** Mature economies show ~0% to -1% annual decline. Over 5 years: -5% to 0%. But this applies to normal baseline, not COVID-depressed baseline.

3. **Uncertainty bands:** EDGAR's ±6% uncertainty means even if true change is 0%, measurement could show -6% to +6%. This argues for wider confidence intervals.

4. **Historical upset rate:** Transportation emissions are relatively predictable compared to other sectors (less weather-dependent than power, less cyclical than industry). Major upsets are rare outside economic shocks.

5. **Distribution shape:** Given the COVID baseline effect, distribution should be skewed slightly positive. Most likely outcome is modest positive change, with asymmetric tails (larger upside risk if 2020 was very depressed).

**Calibration approach:**
- P10 (pessimistic/low): Assume 2020 was relatively normal, strong efficiency gains, possible recession → -2%
- P20: Mild efficiency gains dominate → +1%
- P40: Modest recovery from slightly depressed 2020 → +4%
- P60: Moderate recovery scenario → +7%
- P80: Strong recovery from depressed 2020 → +10%
- P90 (optimistic/high): 2020 was severely depressed, full recovery → +13%

**Adjustments for measurement uncertainty:** Given ±6% EDGAR uncertainty and Carbon Monitor revision potential, widen intervals slightly, especially at tails.
