### 1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)
**Percent change (%) in global ground-transport CO2 emissions from Carbon Monitor, comparing January 2020 to December 2025.**

---

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality/date; fact vs opinion)

1) **Carbon Monitor site (carbonmonitor.org; terms/disclaimer page)**  
- **What it is:** Administrative/disclaimer information; notes dataset is “living” and can be revised.  
- **Quality:** High for governance context, **no direct quantitative evidence** here.  
- **Date:** Current as of access (2026-02-04).  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual statements about revisions/liability.

2) **Nature Data Descriptor on Carbon Monitor methodology (Nov 9, 2020)**  
- **What it is:** Peer-reviewed methodology description for near-real-time CO2 estimates, including **ground transport based on traffic indices in 416 cities** and scaling to global coverage.  
- **Quality:** **High** (peer-reviewed; directly relevant to how the resolution data is constructed).  
- **Date:** 2020 (historical, still relevant).  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual methodology; uncertainty ranges (±6% to ±10% for global totals) are quantitative claims.

3) **Carbon Monitor news/update timeline (carbonmonitor.org/news; 2024-2025 items summarized)**  
- **What it is:** Project announcements with **overall global emissions growth rates** (not sector-specific in the provided summary).  
- **Quality:** Medium-to-high; primary-source announcements, but **indirect** for this question (ground transport specifically).  
- **Date:** 2024-2025 announcements; relevant context.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual topline numbers; limited sector detail.

4) **ICCT “Vision 2050” update on global ZEV transition (2025 report)**  
- **What it is:** Policy/market synthesis; claims **road-transport emissions could peak as soon as 2025** (scenario-dependent).  
- **Quality:** High (ICCT is a reputable transport-policy analytics org), but the “peak by 2025” is **scenario/model-dependent**.  
- **Date:** 2025; relevant to the endpoint.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mixed: EV sales shares/policy changes are factual; peaking timing is a modeled projection/interpretation.

5) **Nature Communications road-freight paper (Mar 15, 2025; Shenzhen-focused)**  
- **What it is:** City-level freight emissions analysis; shows large mitigation potential but also freight growth pressure.  
- **Quality:** High academically, but **external validity is limited** (one city; strategy study).  
- **Date:** 2025.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mostly factual within-study; broader implication (global trend) is indirect.

6) **Global Carbon Project / media summaries (Nov 2025; e.g., LMU news recap)**  
- **What it is:** Overall fossil CO2 up around **~1% in 2025 vs 2024** (various recaps).  
- **Quality:** High for global total context; **not specific to ground transport**.  
- **Date:** Late 2025 reporting; relevant.  
- **Fact vs opinion:** Mainly factual (reported estimates), but sectoral extrapolation would be my inference.

7) **AskNews snippets (Feb 2026; various outlets)**  
- **Beijing air pollution improvement (Gizmodo ES, Feb 2026):** plausible facts but journalism-grade; not directly CO2/ground-transport global. **Low weight** for this question.  
- **Belgium excise revenues (DH.be, Feb 2026):** factual national fuel consumption story; illustrates persistence of liquid fuel demand despite EVs. **Low-to-moderate weight** (single country).  
- **EU rule-weakening claims (MarketScreener/AFP/T&E-based, Feb 2026):** mostly about **post-2030/2035** policy and projected long-run impacts; limited direct bearing on **Dec 2025** level. **Low-to-moderate weight**.

## (b) Evidence analysis with weighting (what moves the forecast)

### Strong evidence (large shifts)
1) **Resolution is a point-to-point comparison (Jan 2020 vs Dec 2025), not “2020 annual vs 2025 annual”.**  
- This makes the COVID collapse in mid-2020 **much less directly relevant** (Jan 2020 was largely pre-COVID; Dec 2025 is fully post-COVID).  
- Effect: pulls distribution **toward modest changes** (closer to 0) vs the “big rebound” story.

2) **Structural electrification/efficiency trend is real but fleet turnover is slow.** (ICCT + broad known dynamics)  
- EV sales shares rose a lot, but global stock share by 2025 is still far from dominant; heavy-duty turnover especially slow.  
- Effect: prevents very large decreases by Dec 2025, but also caps increases.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
3) **Overall global fossil CO2 was still rising slightly in 2024-2025 (Carbon Monitor news; GCP summaries).**  
- If total fossil CO2 is flat-to-up, it’s harder (not impossible) for global ground transport CO2 to be sharply down by end-2025.  
- Effect: nudges forecast **positive**.

4) **ICCT: road-transport emissions could peak around 2025**  
- “Peaking” implies Dec 2025 is plausibly near a plateau, not necessarily below Jan 2020.  
- Effect: compresses forecast around small positive/near-flat, with some probability of slight negative.

### Weak evidence (small shifts)
5) **Single-country anecdotes (Belgium fuel excise, Beijing air quality)**
- Informative color, but too local and conflates pollutants vs CO2.  
- Effect: tiny upward nudge (continued fuel use) but minimal.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window for the variable:** from **January 2020 to December 2025** (already elapsed).  
- **Time until resolution:** about **26 days** (to 2026-03-01), though the prompt suggests Carbon Monitor data may be posted “sometime in 2026.”

**If the comparison window were halved** (e.g., Jan 2020 → mid-2022), I’d expect **lower / possibly negative** change because it would include the COVID trough/recovery dynamics depending on endpoint month.  
**If doubled** (e.g., Jan 2020 → late 2030), I’d expect **more negative** expected change as EV penetration and standards accumulate, unless demand growth dominates.

## (d) Justification: adjusting the outside view to an inside view

### Step 1: Start from the outside view you provided
Your outside-view distribution centered around a **modest positive** change (roughly +4% to +7% at the middle), with tails from slightly negative to low-teens positive. That was built largely on an implicit “2020 was COVID-depressed” baseline.

### Step 2: Key correction—what exactly is being compared
Because the question resolves on **Jan 2020 vs Dec 2025**, the “2020 depression” matters mainly through **long-run behavioral change** (remote work, modal shifts), not through the lockdown months themselves. This single interpretation issue is big enough to **recenter the distribution closer to 0–10%** rather than 5–15%+.

### Step 3: Net forces by Dec 2025 relative to Jan 2020 (status quo if nothing changed)
- **Upward pressures:** more global vehicle ownership and freight, especially outside OECD; general economic growth; persistent oil demand (supported by overall fossil CO2 growth in 2024-25).  
- **Downward pressures:** efficiency improvements; EV adoption (especially in China/EU, and growing elsewhere); some persistence of reduced commuting.

My inside-view synthesis: **small positive change is most likely**, but **a modest decline remains plausible** if EV displacement + efficiency outpace activity growth by late 2025.

## Quick checklist (abbreviated)
1) **Target:** % change in Carbon Monitor ground-transport CO2 from **Jan 2020 to Dec 2025**.  
2) **Outside view anchor:** modest positive single-digit %.  
3) **Consistency:** implied median ≈ **5%**; mean ≈ **6%**; plausible given growth + partial electrification.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):** (i) point-to-point months; (ii) overall global CO2 slightly up in 2024-25; (iii) road emissions near peak ~2025; (iv) slow fleet turnover; (v) dataset revisions/uncertainty.  
5) **Blind spot:** If Carbon Monitor’s month-to-month seasonal patterns or methodological revisions make **Dec systematically lower than Jan**, outcome could be **more negative** than expected.
