TARGET VARIABLE (paraphrased in <20 words)  
Percentage change in global ground-transport CO₂ emissions between calendar-year 2020 and calendar-year 2025, Carbon Monitor data.

====================================================
A. SOURCE ANALYSIS  (quality & factual take-aways)  
1. Carbon Monitor disclaimer page (2025-11).  High-quality but only methodological; no numbers.  Factual.  
2. Nature 2020 Carbon Monitor paper.  Peer-reviewed.  Shows 8.8 % global CO₂ drop Jan-Jun 2020; road-transport fell ≈10 %-25 % in early pandemic.  Factual.  
3. Carbon Monitor news flashes 2022-2025.  Project-run blog; credible but headline-level.  Gives +0.1 %, +0.9 %, +0.6 % for total global CO₂ 2023-2025.  Factual.  
4. LMU / Global Carbon Project 2025 press release (2025-11-13).  Strong scientific consortium.  Reports fossil CO₂ record high 2025 (+1.1 % vs 2024).  Factual.  
5. ICCT Vision-2050 update (2025-12).  Expert NGO.  Projects road-transport emissions peaking “as soon as 2025”.  Contains analysis & opinion; data are model-based.  
6. Regional articles (EU DUH suit, Belgium excise, Austria study, Singapore dip).  Mixed quality; descriptive of local trends.  Useful for colour, not for global totals.

B. EVIDENCE WEIGHING  
Strong evidence  
• 2020 was an anomalously LOW year for road travel; Carbon Monitor & multiple studies show ~10-15 % annual drop for ground transport.  
• 2021-2025 global fossil CO₂ has steadily REBOUNDED and set a record in 2025 (+1.1 % y/y, GCP).  
Moderate evidence  
• EV share rose quickly (China/EU >30 % LDV sales 2025), tempering growth.  
• ICCT & regional data show transport emissions in mature markets roughly flat 2023-25.  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation that global road emissions already peaked in 2025 (ICCT “could peak”); contingent and model-based.

C. TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS  
Time to resolution: 26 days.  The physical outcome is fixed; only our information can change.  Halving the window (13 days) scarcely changes my forecast; doubling it (52 days) might allow a late revision if Carbon Monitor quietly posts a major data-revision, widening uncertainty by ~2 percentage-points either side.

D. JUSTIFICATION / INSIDE-VIEW ADJUSTMENT  
Outside-view baseline: compare a “pandemic shock-then-rebound” reference class.  Where daily ground-transport CO₂ fell ≈15 % in 2020 vs 2019, then climbed back near the 2019 level by 2022.  Adding modest underlying growth of 1-2 %/yr 2023-25 and partial EV drag (≈-0.5 %/yr) yields a central expectation that 2025 is about 12-18 % ABOVE 2020.

Drivers pushing higher (up-side)  
• Very low 2020 denominator.  
• Freight demand growth in emerging Asia; oil use up in India (+1.4 % CO₂ 2025).  
• Carbon Monitor counts 85 % of road transport; revisions often raise early-pandemic drops.

Drivers pushing lower (down-side)  
• Rapid electrification in China/EU (LDV sales >40 % electric in 2025 China).  
• Efficiency standards & economic slowdown in Europe, US, parts of China.  
• Possible Carbon Monitor re-analysis shrinking the 2020 drop.

Net effect: shift median slightly DOWN from my crude 20 % base rate to 16 %, keep a fat right tail for measurement surprises, and retain a thin left tail for a scenario where 2020 drop was smaller than thought.

====================================================
FORECASTING CHECKLIST  
1. Target variable restated above – matches resolution criteria.  
2. Base rate: +18 % (pre-adjustment).  
3. Consistency check: implied median ≈ 16 %, mean ≈ 17 %; aligns with narrative and tails.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 2020 ground-transport CO₂ ≈10-15 % below 2019 (strong).  
   • Global fossil CO₂ set record in 2025 (+1.1 %) (strong).  
   • EV uptake accelerating but still <20 % of fleet (moderate).  
   • Carbon Monitor revisions can amplify early-pandemic dip (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: Carbon Monitor may retrospectively estimate smaller 2020 dip (e.g., data gaps in developing world), cutting the percentage rise; would push outcome DOWN.
