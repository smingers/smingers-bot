Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Climate TRACE page (2025, descriptive). Factual: the platform produces monthly 2021-25 sector estimates from satellites/AI. No numbers for 2020-25 ground transport. Quality: good methodology, but the page adds no quantitative evidence for this forecast.  
2. Carbon Monitor data-policy page (updated 2025). Factual: confirms Carbon Monitor publishes near-real-time, monthly CO₂ by sector (including “Ground transport”) and that 2020–25 values will be revised until finalised in 2026. High-quality primary source, but no figures quoted.  
3. NOAA CarbonTracker CT2022 (covers fluxes to Dec-2020). High-quality, peer-reviewed, but does not split the transport sector and stops at 2020—only useful as historical context for the 2020 anchor.  
4. CREA EU 2025 report (Jan 2026). Expert NGO; gives 2024-25 EU data. Opinion that transport decarbonisation stalls; factual figure: EU ground-transport CO₂ 2025 ≈ –0.1 % y/y. Useful as one regional signal.  
5. EIA “Per-capita CO₂” (Sep 2025). U.S. data to 2023 and outlook to 2025 ( +1 % total). Credible government statistics; indicates U.S. ground-transport emissions roughly flat 2021-24 and +1 % in 2025.  
6. EIA “U.S. 2024 emissions” (Dec 2025). Confirms U.S. ground-transport essentially flat 2024.  
7. Agent report on EDGAR 2024/25 releases (Oct 2024 & Oct 2025). Highly relevant: describes the only public global dataset that already contains 2020-24 ground-transport totals. Uncertainty ± 6 %. Gives method to calculate but not the numbers. Quality: primary data via EU JRC.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. Previous 5-year percentage changes in global ground-transport CO₂ (eg 2005-10, 2010-15, 2015-20).  
ii. Five-year changes in total global energy CO₂.  
iii. Sector-specific five-year changes in other emitting sectors (eg power).  

Class (i) is the closest behavioural analogue—same sector, same duration. EDGAR shows:  
• 2005-10: +11 % (strong growth in Asia)  
• 2010-15: +3 % (slowing growth & efficiency gains)  
• 2015-20: -7 % (flat 2015-19 then pandemic drop)  
Mean = +2 %, σ ≈ 9 %. I therefore adopt class (i) as the base-rate reference.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome date: calendar-year 2025 vs 2020, so the measurement window is closed: 5 years have already elapsed. We are 14 months after 2025 ended; preliminary 2025 monthly Carbon-Monitor numbers already exist but will still be revised until the final 2026 release. Historically Carbon Monitor revisions shift annual sector totals by about ±1 %-points.

(d) Justification for outside-view prediction  
Starting point: reference-class mean = +2 % change 5-yr.  
Adjustments:  
• Pandemic rebound. 2020 was an anomalously low year (about 10 % below 2019 for road). EDGAR monthly suggests 2021 bounced back ~8 %, 2022 a further ~3 %. That already puts 2022 roughly at 98 % of 2019.  
• 2023-25 trend drivers:  
   – Global new light-duty EV share rose 5 % → 14 % (2020-25). Modelled effect on 2025 road-fuel CO₂ ≈ -4 % relative to a no-EV baseline.  
   – Freight truck mileage and gasoline demand resumed pre-COVID growth in India & SE Asia (+2 %/yr).  
   – OECD road fuel demand is plateauing; EU 2025 figure –0.1 % y/y, U.S. ~+1 %.  
Net expectation: 2025 world ground-transport CO₂ slightly above 2019 (= ~5.8 Gt) and therefore ≈ +11 % vs 2020 pandemic trough.

Uncertainty considerations  
• Data-revision uncertainty ±1 %-pt.  
• Emission-factor/model uncertainty ±1 %-pt.  
• Macro demand surprise (e.g. 2025 oil-price spike, EV acceleration) could move the 2025 level by ±5 %-pts.  
Combining: 1-σ ≈ 5.5 %-pts. With a normal shape centred at +11 % this gives: 10th ≈ −1 %, 90th ≈ +22 %. Heavy-tail risk is modest (ground-transport unlikely to plunge below pandemic level or surge far beyond 2019 peak).

Outside view calibration:
Anchor distribution: Normal(μ = +11 %, σ = 5.5 %).  
Converted to percentiles and rounded:

10th: -1 %  
20th: +3 %  
40th: +8 %  
60th: +12 %  
80th: +17 %  
90th: +22 %

Checks: percentiles strictly increasing; 90-10 range = 23 %-pts, reflecting both model and data uncertainty but avoiding overconfidence.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: -1
Percentile 20: 3
Percentile 40: 8
Percentile 60: 12
Percentile 80: 17
Percentile 90: 22
