Forecast target (paraphrased in 17 words)  
“Percentage change in global ground-transport CO₂ emissions, full-year 2025 versus full-year 2020, Carbon Monitor dataset.”

——————————————————————————————————  
A. Source analysis (very brief)  
1. Carbon Monitor news-feed (2024-25). High-quality team, peer-reviewed; gives overall 2023-25 global totals, not sector splits. Factual.  
2. Carbon Monitor methodology paper (Nature 2020). Peer-reviewed; details uncertainty (±6 %–10 %), 85 % road-transport coverage. Factual.  
3. ICCT Vision-2050 update (2025). Sector experts; gives projections of road-transport peak ~2025 and EV market data. Mainly forward-looking but based on modelling.  
4. Global Carbon Budget 2025 (multiple news reports, Nov 2025). Authoritative consortium; provides preliminary 2025 fossil-fuel totals and notes transport demand trends. Factual.  
5. Regional snippets (EIA US, CREA EU, Belgian tax article, etc.). Official statistics or journals; good for triangulating 2024-25 flat-ish road-fuel demand in mature economies.  
6. Misc. opinion pieces (T&E, auto-industry). Advocacy; useful for policy context but weak on 2025 hard data.

B. Evidence weighing  
Strong  
• 2020 pandemic trough: Carbon Monitor & IEA show ≈ 10 % drop in road-transport CO₂ vs 2019 (structural, measured).  
• Rebound 2021-22: two independent datasets (IEA, Carbon Monitor provisional) show +11 % over 2020–22.  
Moderate  
• Flat-to-slight growth 2023-24 in overall transport CO₂ (EDGAR early release, CREA EU, EIA US).  
• Preliminary GCP 2025 figure: total fossil CO₂ +0.6 % y-o-y implies road sector ~0 % to +2 % in 2025.  
• EV share in new-car sales rose from 5 % (2020) to 19 % (2025) – slows, but does not reverse, demand growth.  
Weak  
• 2025 policy debates on 2035 targets – limited leverage on 2025 emissions.  
• City-level anecdotes (Beijing, Reading) – local, not global.

C. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome fixed (Jan 2020–Dec 2025); zero forward time uncertainty, only final data revision risk.  
If we were forecasting in 2023 (timeframe doubled) we would have assigned a wider 90 % range (≈ ±15 %). With only data-revision risk left, ±10 % feels sufficient.

D. Justification / base-rate anchoring  
Reference class: typical 5-yr change in road-transport CO₂ when first year is a recession trough ≈ +12 % (Great-Recession analogue 2009-14).  
Adjustments  
– EV and efficiency gains: –1 %  
+ Developing-world VKT growth: +2 %  
– Mature-economy demand stagnation & fuel-economy rules: –1 %  
Net inside-view shift: essentially neutral; base rate remains +12 %.  
Uncertainty: Carbon Monitor sector data ±6 % (2σ) on level; compounding over two years of unpublished data gives ≈ ±4 % on the 5-yr delta. I double it to ±8 % to cover model revisions → 90 % range about 24 percentage-points wide.

Consistency check  
Implied median = 11 %, mean ≈ 12 % (right-skew), matches narrative of rebound then plateau.

Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
1. 2020 road-transport CO₂ ≈ 10 % below 2019 – pandemic trough.  
2. 2021-22 rebound regained most lost ground (+11 %).  
3. 2023-24 flat (0 % ± 1 %) in mature economies – suggests plateau.  
4. Preliminary 2025 total fossil CO₂ +0.6 % – road likely +0 % to +2 %.  
5. EV share 19 % of 2025 sales – dents, but doesn’t reverse, emissions.

Blind-spot scenario  
If Carbon Monitor’s forthcoming revision shows 2020 emissions were initially over-estimated (true drop larger), the calculated 2020–25 change could be far higher than forecast (+25 % or more).
