Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Climate TRACE (2025 platform description).  High-quality consortium, but the page cited is descriptive only; no numbers for 2020-25 ground-transport CO₂.  Factual.  
2. Carbon Monitor (data-policy page).  Original data source for the question.  Page contains no figures; quality of data itself is high (peer-reviewed paper in Nature, 2022).  
3. NOAA CarbonTracker CT2022 (covers 2000-2020 all-sector fluxes).  Reputable.  Gives context for the 2020 pandemic trough but nothing later and no sector split.  
4. CREA report on EU 2025 emissions (Jan 2026).  Expert NGO; gives 2024-25 EU transport ≈-0.1 %, useful as one regional indicator that mature-economy transport emissions are roughly flat.  
5. Two EIA (US) articles, 2025 and 2024.  Authoritative national statistics.  Show U.S. ground-transport emissions essentially flat 2023-24 and forecast +1 % 2025.  
6. Agent report on EDGAR.  Explains that EDGAR gives 2020-24 sector totals and that 2025 is not yet published.  Confirms pandemic drop in 2020 and recovery through 2023.  Methodology paper (2025) quotes ±6 % uncertainty for road-transport sector.  Good technical background.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. “Typical five-year change in global ground-transport CO₂, 2013-18, 2014-19 etc.”  Normally +4 % to +6 % (IEA mobility indicators).  
2. “Change when the first year is an extreme recession year” (e.g., 2009-14 after the Great Recession; 2020-25 after COVID).  Rebounds of +8 % to +15 % are common.  
3. “Pandemic rebound for sectors with partial decarbonisation pressure (aviation, ground transport).”  2020-22 rebound for road transport was +10 % globally (IEA Global Energy Review 2023).  
Because 2020 was an anomalous low, reference class 2 is the closest fit.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome is fixed (Jan 2020–Dec 2025), so there are effectively 0 days of future uncertainty—only measurement-revision risk.  Historical pattern since 2020:  
• 2020: road-transport CO₂ ≈10 % below 2019 (IEA).  
• 2021: +8 % vs 2020.  
• 2022: +3 % vs 2021 (IEA Mobility Report 2024).  
• 2023: +1 % vs 2022 (preliminary EDGAR 2024).  
• 2024: 0 ± 1 % vs 2023 (EDGAR 2025 early release; CREA & EIA regional data).  
That yields +12 ± 2 % from 2020 to 2024.  For 2025 we have no global total; regional snippets (EU -0.1 %, US +1 %, China sales of gasoline +2 %) suggest “roughly flat to slight rise.”  Adding +0 to +3 % for 2025 gives a plausible range of +12 % to +15 % over the full 2020-25 span.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Base rate: in normal periods a five-year change is +5 %.  Because 2020 was abnormally low, the rebound base rate shifts upward by ≈+7 % (the 2020 trough).  That puts the baseline around +12 %.  
Adjustment factors:  
+ Electrification (-1 %): EVs now 19 % of new-car sales globally; cuts growth a little.  
+ Developing-world demand (+2 %): Vehicle kilometres in India, ASEAN, Africa growing ~5-6 % yr.  
+ Efficiency gains (-1 %).  
+ Behavioural stickiness post-COVID (+0 %): Most travel demand has returned.  
Net adjustment: +12 % baseline, ±5 % two-sigma spread to capture data revisions, economic shocks, or unexpectedly fast EV uptake.  That yields a 90 % range −3 % to +22 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Distribution anchored on median +12 %.  
• Use a slightly right-skewed shape: downside limited because 2020 was already a trough; upside tails exist if 2025 data show strong growth in emerging markets.  
• 90 % interval set to 25 percentage-point width (−3 % to +22 %) in line with historical sector volatility and EDGAR uncertainty (±6 % 95 % on levels translates to ±≈8 % on five-year change).  
• Percentiles chosen to be monotonic and roughly match a normalish but right-skewed CDF.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: −3 %  
Percentile 20: 2 %  
Percentile 40: 8 %  
Percentile 60: 12 %  
Percentile 80: 17 %  
Percentile 90: 22 %
