# Summary of CarbonTracker CT2022 Article

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Scope and Coverage:**
- CarbonTracker CT2022 provides global estimates of surface-atmosphere CO₂ fluxes from January 2000 through December 2020
- This is a CO₂ measurement and modeling system developed by NOAA

**Fossil Fuel Emissions:**
- 82% of fossil fuel emissions come from the industrialized northern extratropics
- Emissions are concentrated in areas with high population density and economic activity

**Wildfire Emissions:**
- Wildfires add an additional 2.0-2.6 Pg C yr⁻¹ to the atmosphere
- 87% of wildfire emissions come from tropical and southern land regions

**Natural Sinks (2001-2020 period):**
- Natural sinks (fire emissions, land biosphere sink, and ocean sink) together absorb about half of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions
- The global sum of "natural" fluxes is 46% of fossil fuel emissions over the same time period
- Without these sinks, atmospheric CO₂ growth rate would be about twice the observed rate

**Ocean Absorption:**
- World oceans absorb 1.4 to 4.0 Pg C yr⁻¹
- Tropics are a natural source of 0.4 to 1.1 Pg C yr⁻¹
- Large extratropical sinks absorb 2.4 - 4.5 Pg C yr⁻¹

**Terrestrial Biosphere:**
- Net global land sink: 2.1 - 4.5 Pg C yr⁻¹
- Northern temperate and boreal regions absorb 1.3 - 2.5 Pg C yr⁻¹ (about 55% of global land total)

**North America Specific Data:**
- North American ecosystems have been a net sink of 0.7 (range 0.4 - 1.0) Pg C yr⁻¹ over 2001-2020
- This natural sink offsets about one-third of fossil fuel emissions from USA, Canada, and Mexico combined
- Combined fossil fuel emissions from these three countries: approximately 1.7 Pg C yr⁻¹
- North American fossil emissions range between 1.4 and 1.8 Pg C yr⁻¹, remaining generally steady
- Year-to-year variability in land uptake is as large as the average sink itself
- During drought years (2002, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012), land ecosystems accounted for only about 0.3 Pg C yr⁻¹ sink (vs. ~0.5 Pg C yr⁻¹ in average years)

## Relevance to the Question:

**Disclaimer:** This article focuses on overall CO₂ fluxes from various sources and sinks (including fossil fuels, wildfires, oceans, and terrestrial biosphere) but does **not specifically isolate ground transportation emissions**. The data covers 2000-2020, providing context for the baseline period (2020) but no projections or data for 2025. The article does not break down fossil fuel emissions by sector (ground transportation vs. other sources).

# Summary of Article: EU fossil fuel imports and CO2 emissions in 2025

**Source:** Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air  
**Date:** January 29, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Overall EU Emissions (2025):
- EU CO2 emissions fell by only **0.8% in 2025** (compared to 2.1% reduction in 2024)
- When controlling for weather variation, emissions would have fallen **3.8% in 2025** and 1.3% in 2024
- The required reduction rate to meet greenhouse gas emission targets is **4.0% per year** for the next five years

### Transportation Sector Emissions (2025):
- **Transportation emissions were essentially unchanged at -0.1% in 2025**
- Rising transport oil consumption has pushed EU's total emissions off track by 4%
- Slow progress in cleaner transportation is threatening the EU's 2030 climate and energy goals

### Other Sector Emissions (2025):
- Power generation: -2.1%
- Industry: -3.2%
- Gas-fired heating: +5.5%

### Fossil Fuel Imports:
- Total EU fossil fuel imports in 2025: approximately **EUR 396 billion** (EUR 880 per citizen)
- Clean energy investments: **EUR 330 billion** (less than fossil fuel imports)
- United States became the **largest supplier of fossil fuels to the EU** for the first time, providing **19% of total fossil fuel imports** (7% year-on-year increase)

### Clean Energy Deployment:
- Wind power increased by **16.5 GW** in 2025, versus the **25 GW per year needed** to meet targets
- Solar power generation growth exceeded required rate in 2025, but solar saw its first annual contraction since 2016

### Country-Specific Changes:
- Greatest reductions: Finland (-6%), Hungary, Netherlands, and Sweden (-2%)
- Greatest increases: Bulgaria (+6%), Spain (+3%), Portugal and Czechia (+2%), Belgium (+1%)

## Key Analysis Points:
The article attributes lagging emission reductions to slow progress on electrifying transport and heating, and insufficient investment in clean power generation. Weather conditions (cold weather, poor conditions for hydropower and wind) also contributed to slower progress in 2025.

# Summary of EIA Article on Per Capita Energy-Related CO2 Emissions

**Publication Details:**
- Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
- Date: September 15, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Overall U.S. Trends (2005-2023):**
- Total energy-related CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell 20% between 2005 and 2023
- U.S. population grew 14% during this period
- Per capita CO2 emissions decreased 30% nationwide
- Per capita CO2 emissions decreased in every state during this period

**Transportation Sector Emissions:**
- In 2023, transportation sector accounted for the largest share of CO2 emissions in 28 states
- For 14 of those 28 states, transportation sector overtook electric power sector after 2005
- Transportation sector surpassed electric power sector as largest national emissions source in 2016
- U.S. transportation sector CO2 emissions peaked in 2007
- Transportation fuel mix has remained relatively steady since 2007 despite increased EV sales and reduced petroleum demand post-COVID-19
- Transportation sector emissions declined slower than electric power sector emissions since 2007

**Future Outlook:**
- EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts a slight 1% increase in U.S. total CO2 emissions in 2025
- Increase attributed in part to increased fossil fuel consumption for crude oil production and electricity generation growth

**Other Context:**
- Primary driver of overall emissions decline was reduced coal use in electric power sector, replaced by natural gas, wind, and solar
- Transportation emissions are accounted for in the state where fuels are sold, even if vehicles later travel across state/international lines

**Note:** This article focuses on U.S. state-level data and does not provide global ground transportation emissions data directly relevant to the forecasting question's 2020-2025 timeframe.

# Summary of EIA Article on U.S. Energy-Related CO2 Emissions in 2024

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Ground Transportation:

### Overall Transportation Sector (2024):
- U.S. transportation sector CO2 emissions remained virtually unchanged in 2024
- Motor gasoline emissions increased by less than 1% (3 MMmt) in 2024
- Jet fuel emissions increased by 3% (7 MMmt) in 2024
- Distillate fuel oil emissions fell by 3% (15 MMmt) in 2024

### Ground Transportation Specific Trends:
- **Motor gasoline**: Despite steady increases in vehicle miles traveled, motor gasoline emissions have generally declined modestly over the last 20 years
- **Reasons for declining motor gasoline emissions**: Higher vehicle fuel economy standards and, to a lesser extent, increased deployment of electric vehicles
- **Distillate/diesel**: On-road diesel vehicles consumed less fuel in 2024, and conventional diesel fuel was substituted for renewable diesel to some extent

### Net Effect:
Higher motor gasoline and jet fuel emissions were more than offset by declining emissions from distillate fuel oil in the transportation sector overall.

## Important Notes:
- This data is specific to the **United States only**, not global ground transportation
- Data is **preliminary** for 2024
- The report focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and non-combustion applications only
- The methodology may result in discrepancies with other organizations' estimates

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:
This article provides U.S.-specific ground transportation emissions trends for 2024, but the forecasting question asks about **global** ground transportation emissions changes between 2020 and 2025. This data point represents only one country's contribution to the global picture.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide annual global ground transportation CO2 emission data 2020-2025 with percentage changes
The user needs a six-year time series (2020-2025) of global CO₂ emissions from ground transportation (road + rail + pipeline) together with the year-on-year percentage change.  

1. Fit of available datasets to the request  
• EDGAR – the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research – is the only openly licensed source that:  
  – gives separate values for the three IPCC sub-sectors that together define “ground transportation” (1.A.3.b Road, 1.A.3.c Rail, 1.A.3.d Pipelines);  
  – aggregates these to a global total;  
  – provides annual data up to t-1 (one year behind the calendar year).  
  The October-2024 release (“EDGAR 2024 GHG”) extends the series through 2023 [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu, news item 05 Nov 2024].  
  A subsequent 01 Oct 2025 news item announces “EDGAR 2025 GHG”, covering 1970-2024 [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu, news item 01 Oct 2025].  
• Therefore:  
  – authoritative numbers exist for 2020-2024 (inclusive).  
  – no source in today’s results contains a 2025 annual figure; EDGAR will not publish 2025 before autumn 2026, so any 2025 total would be provisional at best.  

2. What is already in the public domain  
The web pages confirm the presence and scope of the datasets but do not print the actual gigatonne values; the numbers reside in the downloadable CSV/XLSX files. Consequently:  
• 2020-2023 ground-transport CO₂ can be produced immediately by summing the “WORLD” lines for sectors 1.A.3.b, 1.A.3.c and 1.A.3.d in the EDGAR 2024 spreadsheets.  
• 2024 values require downloading the analogous spreadsheets from the EDGAR 2025 release.  
No further bibliographic search is needed; the task is a data-extraction exercise.  

3. Outstanding information gaps relative to the user’s table  
a) The numerical totals for 2020-2024 have not yet been copied out of the EDGAR files.  
b) Percentage changes for 2023-2024 cannot be calculated until (a) is done.  
c) 2025 remains unpublished, so both the level and the 2024-2025 percentage change are unknown.  

4. Options for the missing 2025 row  
• Leave 2025 blank and footnote “EDGAR data not yet released; earliest publication expected Q4 2026”.  
• Offer a clearly labelled provisional proxy: ClimateTRACE issues monthly transport-sector estimates (July- and Sept- 2025 releases noted by PR Newswire, 25 Sep 2025 & 25 Nov 2025) but these aggregate all transport modes and do not isolate ground transport. Using them would violate the modal definition set out in the query and is therefore not recommended.  

5. Recommended next steps to complete the answer  
Step 1 – Download the sector files from EDGAR 2024 (for 2020-2023) and EDGAR 2025 (for 2024):  
• 1.A.3.b Road transport – file TRO_emi_[yearrange].csv  
• 1.A.3.c Railways – file RAI_emi_[yearrange].csv  
• 1.A.3.d Pipelines – file PIP_emi_[yearrange].csv  
Step 2 – In each file, filter the record with Region = “WORLD” (or “GLOBAL”), Compound = “CO2” and Unit = “kt CO2”.  
Step 3 – Convert to gigatonnes (divide kt by 1 000 000), sum the three sectors for each year.  
Step 4 – Calculate YoY percentage change: (Value ᵢ – Value ᵢ₋₁) / Value ᵢ₋₁ × 100.  
Step 5 – Populate the table:  
 Year | Ground-transport CO₂ (Gt) | % change vs. previous year  
 2020 | … | —  
 2021 | … | …  
 2022 | … | …  
 2023 | … | …  
 2024 | … | …  
 2025 | n/a | n/a (data not yet released)  

6. Feasibility and data quality considerations  
• EDGAR numbers are harmonised to the IEA “Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy – 2024 edition” methodology, ensuring consistency with energy statistics [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu dataset page].  
• The database is released under CC-BY 4.0, so republication of derived global totals is legally permissible (with attribution).  
• Uncertainty: the road-transport subsector has a ±6 % global uncertainty at 95 % confidence (EDGAR methodology paper in Nature Scientific Data, 16 Jul 2025). Users should note that percentage changes of a few percent may be within the statistical error band.  

Conclusion  
All validated primary data needed to meet the user’s request for 2020-2024 exist today in the EDGAR public release files; they only need to be extracted and summed. Annual figures for 2025 do not yet exist in any vetted modal-specific dataset, so the final answer must flag 2025 as “not yet published” unless the user explicitly accepts provisional alternatives. If an immediate numeric table is required, perform the five-step extraction above; otherwise, explain the timeline and limitations as outlined here.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
