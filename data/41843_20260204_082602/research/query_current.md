Analysis:
The question will ultimately be resolved with Carbon Monitor’s 2020-to-2025 ground-transportation CO₂ series, so the most helpful near-term evidence is:
• Any Carbon Monitor release, blog post, data update or peer-reviewed study that already reports provisional 2025 values for the ground-transport sector.  
• Independent research (IEA, IEA-ETP, ICCT, IHS Markit, Bloomberg NEF, etc.) or news coverage citing preliminary 2025 global road-transport/ground-transport CO₂ figures or year-end 2024 data extrapolated to 2025.  
• Country or regional inventories (e.g., EEA, US EPA, China Carbon Monitor) that can be aggregated or that Carbon Monitor itself may have used.  
Recent 2023–2024 pieces showed rebounds from the 2020 pandemic trough but still below the 2019 peak; the open question is whether the 2025 level ends up slightly below, roughly equal to, or above 2020. Therefore I will look for the latest Carbon Monitor dataset uploads, press releases, and any 2025 flash estimates referenced in climate-policy and energy-market news.
