Analysis:
The outcome we need is the percentage change in global ground-transport CO₂ between calendar-year 2020 (pandemic trough) and 2025.  
Key historical anchors:

1. Pre-COVID trend (2010-2019): steady growth of road-transport activity (~1-2 %/yr) largely offset by efficiency gains; net CO₂ slowly rising.  
2. 2020: sharp, unprecedented fall. Carbon Monitor shows ≈-14 % for ground transport versus 2019, driven by lockdowns. This low 2020 baseline means 2021-2025 will probably show a rebound when compared to 2020.  
3. 2021-2023: partial rebound. Carbon Monitor monthly data indicate ground-transport CO₂ was ~5–7 % below 2019 in 2021, ~2–3 % below 2019 in 2022, and approximately back to or slightly above 2019 by late-2023.  
4. Structural changes likely to moderate the rebound:  
   • Accelerated electric-vehicle uptake (EVs reached ~18 % of new global light-duty sales in 2023; IEA projects 35 % by 2025).  
   • Stricter fuel-economy/CO₂ standards in EU, China, U.S.  
   • Modal shift policies in some regions (public transit, cycling), though effect is modest globally.  
5. Countervailing forces:  
   • Post-pandemic travel recovery, especially in emerging economies.  
   • Low oil prices in parts of 2021-2023 encouraged driving.  
   • Freight-road transport grows with e-commerce.

Outside-view conclusion: a V-shaped recovery that does not fully erase structural decarbonization gains. Most plausible 2025 value versus 2020 is a positive change (increase in emissions) of roughly +10 % to +20 %, but sizeable uncertainty remains because 2020 was anomalously low. “Long tail” possibilities: a smaller rebound (+5 %) if EV diffusion and policy bite faster, or a larger one (+25 % or more) if economic growth and cheap fossil fuels dominate.
