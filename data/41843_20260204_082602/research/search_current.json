The average annual concentration of PM2.5\u2014fine particles that penetrate the lungs and bloodstream\u2014dropped from 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2013 to 27 micrograms in 2025, representing a reduction of nearly 98%. This marks the first time since systematic measurements began that Beijing has fallen below the national benchmark of 30 micrograms per year. The improvement is sustained and cumulative: in 2025, Beijing recorded 311 days with clean or moderate air quality, the highest number on record. Severe pollution episodes, which once numbered in the tens annually, have nearly disappeared\u2014only one day in 2025 reached critically high levels. Health impacts have significantly improved, with reduced risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, though the city still exceeds the stricter World Health Organization guidelines. The transformation was driven by a national political priority launched in 2013. Key measures included phasing out older vehicles, enforcing Euro 6-level emission standards, implementing odd-even license plate restrictions, expanding public transit, and accelerating the electrification of transport. By 2025, over 50% of new vehicle registrations in Beijing were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from just 5% in 2020. More than 640,000 new electric vehicles were sold in 2024 alone. Urban taxis and buses are now nearly 100% electrified, supported by an extensive charging infrastructure. On the industrial front, highly polluting factories were shut down, relocated outside the urban area, and subjected to stricter emissions controls. Authorities emphasize that improvements were due to real emissions reductions, not favorable weather. While Beijing\u2019s air quality still lags behind European cities like Madrid, Paris, and Berlin, the speed of its decline is unprecedented. The case demonstrates that with strong political will, strict regulation, and large-scale technological change, even deeply entrenched pollution problems can be significantly mitigated.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:48 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/durante-anos-fue-el-simbolo-de-la-polucion-global-ahora-la-ciencia-confirma-que-pekin-ha-eliminado-casi-toda-su-contaminacion-en-solo-12-anos-2000218366)\n\n**Climate Protection Ruling: DUH Forces CO\u2082 Reduction\u2014Combustion Engine Phaseout or Speed Limits?

The key metric now is the total emissions from 2021 to 2030. Although there is no longer a binding emissions target specifically for the transportation sector, if transport emissions contribute to exceeding the overall emissions limit, the responsible federal ministry of transport must propose countermeasures. This reform ensures that all sectors must contribute to meeting the national climate goals, with annual emissions caps defined per sector.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:35 PM\nSource:[auto motor und sport](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/verkehr/gerichtsurteil-klage-klimaschutz-duh-zwangsmassnahmen-co2-reduktion/)\n\n**Was There a Year When CO2 Emissions Declined?**\nYes, there have been years when CO2 emissions decreased. The most recent example is 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when global CO2 emissions dropped by 2 gigatonnes (2 billion tonnes) compared to 2019, a 5.6% decline. This reduction was driven by lockdowns and the disruption of air travel. Historically, emission declines have occurred during economic crises: the 2008 financial crisis led to a 1.5% drop in CO2 emissions, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union caused a 3.3% decrease. The article notes that emissions from fossil fuels\u2014oil, coal, and natural gas\u2014are the primary driver of climate change. In 2015, the Paris Agreement committed the world to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, which can only be achieved through intentional, planned reductions in fossil fuel use\u2014not through the 'accident' of global crises.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[Super](https://super.abril.com.br/ciencia/houve-algum-ano-em-que-as-emissoes-de-co2-cairam/)\n\n**Record Fuel Excise Revenues in 2025 Despite Rise of Electric Vehicles**\nDespite the growing adoption of electric vehicles, Belgian state revenues from fuel excise duties reached a record 6.165 billion euros in 2025, according to data from the SPF Finances. This figure, which is 12.5 million euros higher than in 2024, reflects continued strong fuel consumption: 10.27 billion liters of gasoline and diesel were consumed annually\u201428.12 million liters per day\u2014despite a 22% decline in diesel consumption since 2020. The increase in excise revenue is attributed to a 107% rise in gasoline consumption (an additional 292,356 vehicles), the growth of hybrid vehicles (+691,000 units), and increased freight and delivery traffic. Although electric vehicles are expected to reduce excise revenue by up to 1.5 billion euros annually by 2030, the European Union\u2019s new Emissions Trading System for Transport (ETS2), set to launch in 2027, will compensate for this loss. Under ETS2, fuel suppliers will be required to purchase CO\u2082 emission allowances, which will be passed on to consumers, with estimates projecting an additional 150 euros per driver per year in costs. This mechanism is expected to help the state maintain its fiscal position through VAT recovery on the new carbon tax. According to the SPF \u00c9conomie, the total fuel consumption remains stable compared to previous years, even as the vehicle fleet shifts toward cleaner technologies.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:25 AM\nSource:[DH.be](https://www.dhnet.be/actu/belgique/2026/02/03/record-historique-en-2025-malgre-leclosion-de-lelectrique-les-automobilistes-ont-paye-plus-de-616-milliards-en-accises-sur-les-carburants-4L6HXNJ7T5AMFBIMKXW6VPUYWY/)\n\n**EU's Revised 2035 Car Emissions Rules Allow Up to 15% of Internal Combustion Vehicles, Warns Environmental Group**\nThe European Commission's revised proposal for vehicle emissions regulations, announced in December, significantly eases the 2035 phase-out of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, reducing the target from 100% battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to approximately 85%, with a potential drop to as low as 50% in the most lenient scenario. According to Transport & Environment (T&E), this shift\u2014driven by pressure from automakers\u2014allows continued sales of high-emission vehicles, including traditional ICE models and plug-in hybrids, with a likely 15% share of non-electric vehicles post-2035. The new framework sets a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2021 levels by 2035, rather than an outright ban. The Commission argues the changes will save automakers \u20ac2.1 billion over three years, redirecting funds toward innovation. However, T&E criticizes the move as 'the biggest retreat in European green policy in years,' warning it could increase CO2 emissions by 10% between 2025 and 2050. The proposal also delays the 2030 target, allowing a three-year average (2030\u20132032) for compliance, which T&E estimates would reduce BEV sales to 47% in 2030. If extended to a five-year average from 2028, BEV share could fall to 39%, increasing CO2 emissions by 170 million tonnes. T&E urges the removal of multi-year averaging to avoid slowing the transition. The final outcome remains uncertain, as the proposal may be further weakened in the European Parliament and Council, potentially reshaping the future of the European automotive market and industry.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:23 AM\nSource:[Milano Finanza](https://www.milanofinanza.it/news/auto-gli-effetti-della-frenata-dell-ue-sulle-norme-sull-elettrico-dal-2035-resistera-almeno-il-15-dei-202602031000228017)\n\n**50% of Carbon Emissions Are From Just 32 Companies - One Green Planet**\nIn 2024, just 32 companies were responsible for over 50% of global fossil carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Carbon Majors database, which tracks emissions based on production data from oil, gas, coal, and cement industries. The database, cited by Dana Drugmand of Inside Climate News, highlights the concentrated nature of emissions, noting that despite overall emissions remaining high, the number of top-producing companies has decreased over time. Many of these major emitters continue to plan for increased output. The article emphasizes that this concentration has real-world impacts: more heatwaves, smoke, floods, droughts, and threats to food prices, water security, and wildlife habitats. It also points to ongoing lobbying efforts that hinder the clean energy transition, framing this as a deliberate choice rather than an accident.

Environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) criticized the proposal as the largest rollback of EU climate goals in years, arguing it would still allow sales of high-emission vehicles and risk widening the gap with Chinese electric vehicle (BEV) manufacturers. The Commission claimed the plan would support EV sales and save automakers \u20ac2.1 billion (US$2.5 billion) over three years, freeing up resources for innovation. T&E's report, published on February 3, 2026, stated that automakers could sell between 5% and 50% non-BEV vehicles after 2035, with the most likely scenario at 15%, including a mix of internal combustion engines and efficient plug-in hybrids. Combined with an extended deadline for 2030 targets, the report projected CO2 emissions from cars would be 10% higher between 2025 and 2050 than under current stricter rules. T&E warned of further weakening if the proposals are debated in the European Parliament and Council, both of which must approve the changes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:06 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/eu-vorschlaege-koennten-den-absatz-von-elektroautos-ab-2035-begrenzen-sagt-umweltgruppe-ce7e5bd2da8df621)\n\n**Study: Weakened Combustion Engine Phase-Out Hurts EV Sales**\nA new study by the Brussels-based think tank Transport & Environment (T&E) reveals that the EU's weakened stance on the internal combustion engine (ICE) phase-out is creating uncertainty and potentially leading to significant losses in electric vehicle (EV) sales. According to the study, the revised CO2 reduction target for 2035 could reduce the projected share of electric vehicles from 100% to 85%, a 15-point decline. CO2 emissions from vehicles would be 10% higher than originally planned. The study notes that traditional combustion engines, various hybrids, and range-extended electric vehicles (with a gasoline engine that charges the battery during driving) will still be permitted for sale. Sebastian Bock, CEO of T&E Germany, criticized the policy, stating it is 'like betting on multiple horses when only one is racing,' arguing that it diverts investment from future-proof technologies to outdated ones, endangering both climate goals and jobs in Germany's key automotive industry. The study projects that this policy shift will result in an additional 720 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions by 2050, a 10% increase, including emissions from low-carbon steel credits.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 11:12 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Studie_Abgeschwaechtes_Verbrenner_Aus_drueckt_auf_E_Auto_Absatz-19429859)\n\n**Electric Vehicle Market Share in EU to Reach Only 85% by 2035, Says T&E Study**\nAccording to a study released by the environmental NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) on February 2, 2026, the share of new electric vehicles (EVs) in the European Union will reach only 85% by 2035, rather than the previously mandated 100%, due to proposed flexibilities in the EU\u2019s emissions reduction plan. The European Commission, responding to a crisis in the European automotive sector, proposed on December 16, 2023, to reduce the target for zero-emission vehicle sales from 100% to a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2035. This allows manufacturers to continue selling non-electric vehicles if they compensate through the use of alternative fuels (up to 3%) and low-carbon steel (up to 7%). T&E estimates this will result in an additional 720 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2025 and 2050\u201410% more than the original target. The organization warns that the market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could range from 50% to 95% depending on manufacturers\u2019 technology strategies. T&E criticizes the proposed credits for alternative fuels and the shift of the 2030 emissions target to a three-year average (2030\u20132032) as the most harmful flexibilities, urging their removal. The study also notes that if the European Parliament and Council further weaken the rules\u2014such as lowering the 2035 target to an 80% reduction over five years or expanding super-credits\u2014the BEV market share could drop to 70% by 2035.

The scheme applies to pay-and-display parking and resident parking permits, using a sliding scale based on vehicle CO2 emissions. Vehicles emitting 151g/km or more of CO2 will face higher tariffs\u201420% for petrol and 25% for diesel\u2014while around 50% of motorists are expected to see no change in charges, and a further 25% will pay only the lowest tariff. The system uses DVLA vehicle registration data for road tax to determine emissions levels. New and renewed parking permits from February 2, 2026, are subject to the new structure. Cllr John Ennis, Lead Councillor for Climate Strategy and Transport, emphasized that transport accounts for approximately 30% of national carbon emissions and that the scheme aims to encourage public transport, low-emission vehicles, cycling, and walking. The Council has also invested in bus services and will roll out public electric vehicle charging points later in 2026. According to the Council, the policy is designed to prompt residents to reconsider their travel choices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:20 AM\nSource:[Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/motoring/motoring-news/new-parking-charges-based-car-33344486)\n\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Austria: 'End of a Promising Trend'**\nA study by the Wegener Center at the University of Graz, published on December 19, 2025, projects that Austria's greenhouse gas emissions will rise by approximately 2.5% in 2025 compared to 2024, amounting to an increase of 1.7 million tons of CO2 equivalent. This rise will negate the reduction achieved in 2024 relative to 2023. The forecast has a margin of uncertainty of \u00b12%. According to researchers Gottfried Kirchengast and Stefan Schleicher, the primary causes include a slowdown in the expansion of renewable energy, reduced progress in cutting transport emissions, and cooler winter months with more heating degree days, leading to higher natural gas consumption. Of particular concern are aviation emissions, which are projected to reach over six million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2025\u2014equivalent to about one-third of all ground-based transport emissions in Austria.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 11:18 AM\nSource:[Nieder\u00f6sterreichische Nachrichten](https://www.noen.at/in-ausland/treibhausgas-ausstoss-als-ende-eines-hoffnungsvollen-trends-502226814)\n\n**Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions dipped in 2023 but could rise again**\nSingapore's greenhouse gas emissions decreased to 55.5 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) in 2023, a 5.3% decline from 58.59 Mt in 2022, according to the National Climate Change Secretariat. This marks the first emissions drop since 2008 and is primarily attributed to reduced manufacturing output in the petrochemical sector, which accounted for nearly half of national emissions. The power sector contributed 38.7%, and the transport sector 11.7%. A continued decline in petrol and diesel consumption reflects progress toward the 2040 target of 100% cleaner energy vehicles. However, analysts caution that emissions could rise again before 2030 due to economic recovery and global market fluctuations. Climate observer Melissa Low noted the drop is encouraging but raises concerns about potential economic slowdowns and reduced demand for international carbon credits. NTU associate professor Kelvin Law emphasized that the industrial emissions decline is likely tied to global market conditions, particularly Chinese overcapacity and seven consecutive quarters of decline in Singapore\u2019s chemicals cluster, suggesting the trend may not be sustainable. In contrast, improvements in the transport sector\u2014driven by cleaner vehicles and public transit\u2014are seen as more durable. Economist David Broadstock warned that the 2023 dip may be a temporary anomaly linked to post-pandemic recovery and cautioned against interpreting it as a definitive trend. Singapore\u2019s carbon tax will rise from $25 to $45 per tonne in 2026, affecting about 50 facilities responsible for 70% of national emissions. The country has committed to reducing emissions to 45\u201350 Mt CO2 eq by 2035 and aims to peak emissions by 2028 before reaching about 60 Mt by 2030. The Secretariat affirmed its commitment to meeting these targets, dependent on technological advancement and international cooperation. A detailed 2023 emissions breakdown will be published in the second Biennial Transparency Report in 2026, as required under the Paris Agreement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dipped-in-2023-but-could-rise-again)\n\n**Fossil Fuel Carbon Emissions May Hit New Record in 2025, Report Warns**\nAccording to the Global Carbon Budget 2025 report, released during a press conference at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, fossil fuel-related carbon emissions are projected to reach a new record high of 38.1 billion tons in 2025, a 1.1% increase from 2024. This rise is expected across all fuel types: 0.8% from coal, 1% from oil, and 1.3% from natural gas. International aviation emissions are forecast to increase by 6.8%, surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels, while international shipping emissions are expected to remain stable. Nationally, emissions are projected to rise by 0.4% in China, 1.4% in India, 1.9% in the United States, and 0.4% in the European Union, while Japan is expected to see a 2.2% decline, consistent with recent trends. Other countries are projected to see a 1.1% overall increase. Although deforestation and land-use changes are expected to contribute slightly less to emissions this year, total emissions\u2014including fossil fuels and land-use changes\u2014are forecast at 42.2 billion tons. The report highlights that global emissions have grown at an average rate of 0.3% over the past decade, down from 1.9% in the previous decade. The report warns that the carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C is 'nearly exhausted,' with only 170 billion tons of CO\u2082 emissions remaining\u2014enough to last approximately four years at current emission rates. Additionally, the report notes that 8% of the increase in atmospheric CO\u2082 since 1960 is attributed to climate change's negative impacts on land and ocean carbon sinks.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[TRT haber](https://www.trthaber.com/haber/dunya/fosil-kaynakli-karbon-emisyonlarinda-bu-yil-yeni-rekor-seviye-gorulebilir-925782.html)\n\n**Fossil Fuel Emissions Set to Hit Record High, Global Carbon Budget Nearly Exhausted**\nA new study warns that keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C is no longer plausible, as fossil fuel emissions are projected to reach a record high in 2025. The Global Carbon Budget 2025 report states that the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5\u00b0C target\u2014170 billion tons of CO2\u2014is nearly exhausted and will be depleted before 2030 at the current emission rate. Despite progress in decarbonizing energy systems, rising global energy demand is outpacing reductions. Emissions from coal, oil, and gas are expected to increase by 1.1% in 2025, with coal up 0.8%, oil by 1.0%, and natural gas by 1.3%. Aviation emissions are projected to rise sharply by 6.8%, while maritime transport remains stable. In the European Union, emissions increased by 0.4% due to cold weather, and in the U.S., they are expected to grow by 1.9%. China\u2019s emissions have stabilized with a 0.4% rise, driven by slower energy growth and rapid renewable expansion. India\u2019s emissions are projected to grow by 1.4%, aided by early monsoons and renewable growth. Japan\u2019s emissions are expected to fall by 2.2%. While 35 countries have reduced emissions while growing their economies\u2014double the number from a decade ago\u2014scientists emphasize that progress remains 'too fragile' to achieve sustained global emission declines. The report also notes that climate change is weakening terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks, with 8% of the atmospheric CO2 increase since 1960 attributed to this degradation. Deforestation emissions have dropped to 4.1 billion tons, the lowest since 2014, due to reduced Amazon deforestation, but tropical forests in Southeast Asia and South America have become carbon sources rather than sinks. The total global CO2 emissions are projected to be slightly below 2024 levels, but fossil fuel emissions continue to rise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:41 PM\nSource:[Euronews Espa\u00f1ol](http://es.euronews.com/green/2025/11/13/el-mundo-ha-agotado-casi-todo-su-presupuesto-de-carbono-mientras-las-emisiones-fosiles-bat)\n\n**Global Carbon Budget Nearly Exhausted; Fossil Emissions Set to Rise in 2025**\nNew scientific analyses indicate that keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C is no longer plausible given current data. According to the annual Global Carbon Budget report, fossil fuel emissions are projected to reach a record high in 2025, with a 1.1% increase compared to 2024. The remaining carbon budget for the 1.5\u00b0C target\u2014170 billion tonnes of CO2\u2014will be exhausted before 2030 at the current emission rate. The report, led by Professor Pierre Friedlingstein of the Global Systems Institute at Exeter, warns that climate change is now reducing the planet\u2019s combined land and ocean carbon sinks, signaling an urgent need for drastic emission cuts. While global CO2 emissions have grown more slowly over the past decade (0.3% annually) compared to the previous decade (1.9% annually), this progress is insufficient. Emissions in the EU rose 0.4% due to colder weather, the US is projected to see a 1.9% increase, China\u2019s emissions are stabilizing with a 0.4% rise, India\u2019s are expected to grow by 1.4%, and Japan\u2019s are projected to decline by 2.2%.

Fossil fuel emissions are rising across all categories: coal (+0.8%), oil (+1%), and natural gas (+1.3%). Aviation emissions are projected to increase by 6.8%, while maritime transport emissions remain stable. Land-use emissions are projected to decrease to 4.1 billion tonnes, driven by reduced deforestation in the Amazon, which has reached its lowest level since 2014. However, tropical forests in Southeast Asia and parts of South America have shifted from carbon sinks to sources due to climate change and deforestation, contributing to atmospheric CO2. The report states that 8% of the total CO2 increase since 1960 is attributable to climate change weakening natural carbon sinks.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/green/2025/11/13/emissoes-de-combustiveis-fosseis-no-maximo-historico-mundo-quase-esgota-orcamento-de-carbo)\n\n**Global Fossil CO2 Emissions Hit New Record in 2025, Warns Global Carbon Project**\nGlobal Carbon Project has reported that fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions reached a new record in 2025, increasing by 1.1% compared to 2024, continuing an upward trend since the post-pandemic recovery in 2021. The rise affected all fossil fuels: coal (0.8%), oil (1.0%), and natural gas (1.3%). Total emissions are projected to reach 42.2 gigatonnes in 2025. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to reach 425.7 parts per million, 52% above pre-industrial levels. The transport sector saw the highest increase, with international aviation emissions rising 6.8%, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The report also reveals that global carbon budget emissions\u2014combining fossil fuels and land-use change\u2014grew at 0.3% annually over the last decade, down from 1.9% in the previous decade. Pierre Friedlingstein, lead author from the University of Exeter, stated that keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C is no longer plausible under current emission trends. The report, published alongside a study in Nature, indicates that climate change is reducing the capacity of natural carbon sinks to absorb CO2, with 8% of the CO2 increase since 1960 attributed to sink degradation. Regional trends show China\u2019s emissions rising 0.4% due to renewable growth and reduced energy demand; India\u2019s up 1.4% due to an early monsoon reducing cooling needs; the U.S. up 1.9%; the EU up 0.4% due to poor hydro and wind output increasing gas use; and Japan down 2.2% due to nuclear reactivation and solar expansion. The findings were based on contributions from multiple institutions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[lopezdoriga.com](https://lopezdoriga.com/ciencia-tecnologia/emisiones-globales-co2-origen-fosil-alcanzan-nuevo-record-2025-advierte-global-carbon-project/)\n\n**Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Hit Record High in 2024 Ahead of COP30**\nAccording to the latest report from the United Nations Environment Programme, global greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of 57.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, the highest level in modern history. This marks a 3% increase from 2023 and a 8% rise compared to the 2010\u20132019 average, underscoring the growing gap between climate pledges and real-world policies. The energy sector remains the largest contributor, accounting for 27% (15.6 gigatons), followed by transport (15%, 8.4 gigatons), industry (11%, 6.5 gigatons), and agriculture (11%), with nearly half of agricultural emissions coming from methane released by livestock. Road vehicles are the top source of pollution, contributing over 10% of global emissions, while international aviation, though only responsible for 2% of emissions, recorded the highest growth rate at 6.3%\u2014indicating a strong rebound post-pandemic. Land-use change contributed 8%, industrial processes 9%, and waste 4%. Experts warn that sustained emission increases threaten to derail the global energy transition and undermine the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Despite growing green initiatives, emissions are rising faster than mitigation efforts, making the Paris Agreement targets increasingly difficult and costly to achieve.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/8170189)\n\n**AZAL Representative: Transport Emissions in Eurasia Could Rise by Up to 30% by 2030**\nFidan Farzaliyeva, advisor to the president of AZAL (Azerbaijan Airlines), stated during the third day of Baku Climate Week (BCAW2025) that transport emissions in Eurasia could increase by up to 30% by 2030. She emphasized that the transport sector is one of the largest and fastest-growing contributors to climate change. According to the International Energy Agency, transport accounts for about a quarter of global carbon emissions related to energy. Road transport contributes the largest share\u2014approximately three-quarters of transport emissions, or about 15% of total global carbon emissions. Aviation accounts for 2\u20132.5%, maritime transport for up to 3%, and railways for only about 1% of global transport-related carbon emissions. Rail transport remains the most energy-efficient mode, especially after electrification of networks. Without decisive action, transport emissions in Eurasia are projected to rise to 30% by 2030.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 11:38 AM\nSource:[Report \u0130nformasiya Agentliyi](https://report.az/ru/infrastruktura/predstavitel-azal-v-evrazii-vybrosy-ot-transporta-mogut-uvelichitsya-do-30)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
