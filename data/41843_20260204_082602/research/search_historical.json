The data covers 2000-2020, providing context for the baseline period (2020) but no projections or data for 2025. The article does not break down fossil fuel emissions by sector (ground transportation vs. other sources).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/eu-fossil-fuel-imports-and-co2-emissions-in-2025-dependence-continues-as-u-s-becomes-largest-supplier/\">\n# Summary of Article: EU fossil fuel imports and CO2 emissions in 2025\n\n**Source:** Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air  \n**Date:** January 29, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Overall EU Emissions (2025):\n- EU CO2 emissions fell by only **0.8% in 2025** (compared to 2.1% reduction in 2024)\n- When controlling for weather variation, emissions would have fallen **3.8% in 2025** and 1.3% in 2024\n- The required reduction rate to meet greenhouse gas emission targets is **4.0% per year** for the next five years\n\n### Transportation Sector Emissions (2025):\n- **Transportation emissions were essentially unchanged at -0.1% in 2025**\n- Rising transport oil consumption has pushed EU's total emissions off track by 4%\n- Slow progress in cleaner transportation is threatening the EU's 2030 climate and energy goals\n\n### Other Sector Emissions (2025):\n- Power generation: -2.1%\n- Industry: -3.2%\n- Gas-fired heating: +5.5%\n\n### Fossil Fuel Imports:\n- Total EU fossil fuel imports in 2025: approximately **EUR 396 billion** (EUR 880 per citizen)\n- Clean energy investments: **EUR 330 billion** (less than fossil fuel imports)\n- United States became the **largest supplier of fossil fuels to the EU** for the first time, providing **19% of total fossil fuel imports** (7% year-on-year increase)\n\n### Clean Energy Deployment:\n- Wind power increased by **16.5 GW** in 2025, versus the **25 GW per year needed** to meet targets\n- Solar power generation growth exceeded required rate in 2025, but solar saw its first annual contraction since 2016\n\n### Country-Specific Changes:\n- Greatest reductions: Finland (-6%), Hungary, Netherlands, and Sweden (-2%)\n- Greatest increases: Bulgaria (+6%), Spain (+3%), Portugal and Czechia (+2%), Belgium (+1%)\n\n## Key Analysis Points:\nThe article attributes lagging emission reductions to slow progress on electrifying transport and heating, and insufficient investment in clean power generation. Weather conditions (cold weather, poor conditions for hydropower and wind) also contributed to slower progress in 2025.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=66104\">\n# Summary of EIA Article on Per Capita Energy-Related CO2 Emissions\n\n**Publication Details:**\n- Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\n- Date: September 15, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Overall U.S. Trends (2005-2023):**\n- Total energy-related CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell 20% between 2005 and 2023\n- U.S. population grew 14% during this period\n- Per capita CO2 emissions decreased 30% nationwide\n- Per capita CO2 emissions decreased in every state during this period\n\n**Transportation Sector Emissions:**\n- In 2023, transportation sector accounted for the largest share of CO2 emissions in 28 states\n- For 14 of those 28 states, transportation sector overtook electric power sector after 2005\n- Transportation sector surpassed electric power sector as largest national emissions source in 2016\n- U.S. transportation sector CO2 emissions peaked in 2007\n- Transportation fuel mix has remained relatively steady since 2007 despite increased EV sales and reduced petroleum demand post-COVID-19\n- Transportation sector emissions declined slower than electric power sector emissions since 2007\n\n**Future Outlook:**\n- EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts a slight 1% increase in U.S. total CO2 emissions in 2025\n- Increase attributed in part to increased fossil fuel consumption for crude oil production and electricity generation growth\n\n**Other Context:**\n- Primary driver of overall emissions decline was reduced coal use in electric power sector, replaced by natural gas, wind, and solar\n- Transportation emissions are accounted for in the state where fuels are sold, even if vehicles later travel across state/international lines\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on U.S. state-level data and does not provide global ground transportation emissions data directly relevant to the forecasting question's 2020-2025 timeframe.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/\">\n# Summary of EIA Article on U.S. Energy-Related CO2 Emissions in 2024\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Ground Transportation:\n\n### Overall Transportation Sector (2024):\n- U.S. transportation sector CO2 emissions remained virtually unchanged in 2024\n- Motor gasoline emissions increased by less than 1% (3 MMmt) in 2024\n- Jet fuel emissions increased by 3% (7 MMmt) in 2024\n- Distillate fuel oil emissions fell by 3% (15 MMmt) in 2024\n\n### Ground Transportation Specific Trends:\n- **Motor gasoline**: Despite steady increases in vehicle miles traveled, motor gasoline emissions have generally declined modestly over the last 20 years\n- **Reasons for declining motor gasoline emissions**: Higher vehicle fuel economy standards and, to a lesser extent, increased deployment of electric vehicles\n- **Distillate/diesel**: On-road diesel vehicles consumed less fuel in 2024, and conventional diesel fuel was substituted for renewable diesel to some extent\n\n### Net Effect:\nHigher motor gasoline and jet fuel emissions were more than offset by declining emissions from distillate fuel oil in the transportation sector overall.\n\n## Important Notes:\n- This data is specific to the **United States only**, not global ground transportation\n- Data is **preliminary** for 2024\n- The report focuses on CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and non-combustion applications only\n- The methodology may result in discrepancies with other organizations' estimates\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\nThis article provides U.S.-specific ground transportation emissions trends for 2024, but the forecasting question asks about **global** ground transportation emissions changes between 2020 and 2025. This data point represents only one country's contribution to the global picture.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide annual global ground transportation CO2 emission data 2020-2025 with percentage changes\nThe user needs a six-year time series (2020-2025) of global CO\u2082 emissions from ground transportation (road + rail + pipeline) together with the year-on-year percentage change.  \n\n1. Fit of available datasets to the request  \n\u2022 EDGAR \u2013 the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research \u2013 is the only openly licensed source that:  \n  \u2013 gives separate values for the three IPCC sub-sectors that together define \u201cground transportation\u201d (1.A.3.b Road, 1.A.3.c Rail, 1.A.3.d Pipelines);  \n  \u2013 aggregates these to a global total;  \n  \u2013 provides annual data up to t-1 (one year behind the calendar year).  \n  The October-2024 release (\u201cEDGAR 2024 GHG\u201d) extends the series through 2023 [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu, news item 05 Nov 2024].  \n  A subsequent 01 Oct 2025 news item announces \u201cEDGAR 2025 GHG\u201d, covering 1970-2024 [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu, news item 01 Oct 2025].  \n\u2022 Therefore:  \n  \u2013 authoritative numbers exist for 2020-2024 (inclusive).  \n  \u2013 no source in today\u2019s results contains a 2025 annual figure; EDGAR will not publish 2025 before autumn 2026, so any 2025 total would be provisional at best.  \n\n2. What is already in the public domain  \nThe web pages confirm the presence and scope of the datasets but do not print the actual gigatonne values; the numbers reside in the downloadable CSV/XLSX files. Consequently:  \n\u2022 2020-2023 ground-transport CO\u2082 can be produced immediately by summing the \u201cWORLD\u201d lines for sectors 1.A.3.b, 1.A.3.c and 1.A.3.d in the EDGAR 2024 spreadsheets.  \n\u2022 2024 values require downloading the analogous spreadsheets from the EDGAR 2025 release.  \nNo further bibliographic search is needed; the task is a data-extraction exercise.  \n\n3. Outstanding information gaps relative to the user\u2019s table  \na) The numerical totals for 2020-2024 have not yet been copied out of the EDGAR files.  \nb) Percentage changes for 2023-2024 cannot be calculated until (a) is done.  \nc) 2025 remains unpublished, so both the level and the 2024-2025 percentage change are unknown.  \n\n4. Options for the missing 2025 row  \n\u2022 Leave 2025 blank and footnote \u201cEDGAR data not yet released; earliest publication expected Q4 2026\u201d.  \n\u2022 Offer a clearly labelled provisional proxy: ClimateTRACE issues monthly transport-sector estimates (July- and Sept- 2025 releases noted by PR Newswire, 25 Sep 2025 & 25 Nov 2025) but these aggregate all transport modes and do not isolate ground transport. Using them would violate the modal definition set out in the query and is therefore not recommended.  \n\n5. Recommended next steps to complete the answer  \nStep 1 \u2013 Download the sector files from EDGAR 2024 (for 2020-2023) and EDGAR 2025 (for 2024):  \n\u2022 1.A.3.b Road transport \u2013 file TRO_emi_[yearrange].csv  \n\u2022 1.A.3.c Railways \u2013 file RAI_emi_[yearrange].csv  \n\u2022 1.A.3.d Pipelines \u2013 file PIP_emi_[yearrange].csv  \nStep 2 \u2013 In each file, filter the record with Region = \u201cWORLD\u201d (or \u201cGLOBAL\u201d), Compound = \u201cCO2\u201d and Unit = \u201ckt CO2\u201d.  \nStep 3 \u2013 Convert to gigatonnes (divide kt by 1 000 000), sum the three sectors for each year.  \nStep 4 \u2013 Calculate YoY percentage change: (Value \u1d62 \u2013 Value \u1d62\u208b\u2081) / Value \u1d62\u208b\u2081 \u00d7 100.  \nStep 5 \u2013 Populate the table:  \n\u2003Year | Ground-transport CO\u2082 (Gt) | % change vs. previous year  \n\u20032020 | \u2026 | \u2014  \n\u20032021 | \u2026 | \u2026  \n\u20032022 | \u2026 | \u2026  \n\u20032023 | \u2026 | \u2026  \n\u20032024 | \u2026 | \u2026  \n\u20032025 | n/a | n/a (data not yet released)  \n\n6. Feasibility and data quality considerations  \n\u2022 EDGAR numbers are harmonised to the IEA \u201cGreenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy \u2013 2024 edition\u201d methodology, ensuring consistency with energy statistics [edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu dataset page].  \n\u2022 The database is released under CC-BY 4.0, so republication of derived global totals is legally permissible (with attribution).  \n\u2022 Uncertainty: the road-transport subsector has a \u00b16 % global uncertainty at 95 % confidence (EDGAR methodology paper in Nature Scientific Data, 16 Jul 2025). Users should note that percentage changes of a few percent may be within the statistical error band.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll validated primary data needed to meet the user\u2019s request for 2020-2024 exist today in the EDGAR public release files; they only need to be extracted and summed. Annual figures for 2025 do not yet exist in any vetted modal-specific dataset, so the final answer must flag 2025 as \u201cnot yet published\u201d unless the user explicitly accepts provisional alternatives. If an immediate numeric table is required, perform the five-step extraction above; otherwise, explain the timeline and limitations as outlined here.</Agent_report>\n"
