Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **Ceicdata (2007-2016)**: Reports 813.59 deposit accounts per 1,000 adults in 2016. Moderate quality - provides administrative data but ends 8 years before target date. Note: accounts ≠ individuals with accounts.

2. **FRED/World Bank**: Metadata only, no actual data values provided. Not useful for analysis.

3. **Verivafrica (2023)**: Reports 74% financial inclusion, but only 38% with savings accounts at regulated institutions. Good quality with clear definitions. Critical distinction: financial inclusion ≠ bank account ownership.

4. **Punch (May 2025)**: Reports financial inclusion rose from 56% (2020) to 64% (2023) per EFInA. Good quality, cites identifiable source. Discusses NRBVN diaspora initiative. Note: This is overall financial inclusion, not specifically bank accounts.

5. **The Nation (June 2025)**: Reports e-payment transactions hit N1.07 quadrillion in 2024. Discusses historical targets but provides no 2024 bank account data. Moderate quality for context.

6. **Cambridge Journal**: Academic source reporting 2020 data: 40% financially excluded. High quality but dated. Notes persistent gender gap (12 percentage points).

**Current News Sources (2026):**

7. **S&P Global (Feb 5, 2026)**: Discusses banking sector profitability, credit growth projections. No mention of achieving 95% bank account penetration. Strong evidence of absence - if achieved, this would be headline news.

8. **Multiple sources on BVN enrollments (Jan 2026)**: Report 67.8 million BVNs as of December 2025, up from 63.5 million in 2024. High quality administrative data. With ~120 million adults, this suggests ~56-57% penetration maximum.

9. **Nigerian fintech growth (Feb 2026)**: CBN reports 70% fintech sector growth in 2025, but acknowledges persistent challenges in infrastructure and inclusion. No claim of 95% achievement.

10. **World Bank poverty report (Oct 2025)**: Projects 139 million Nigerians in poverty in 2025, 62% poverty rate. Structural economic challenges persist. High quality source indicating difficult environment for financial inclusion.

11. **Tax ID requirement (Sep 2025)**: New law requires TIN for bank accounts from Jan 2026. Article notes "more than 60 million Nigerians hold bank accounts" - far below 95% of adults.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against 95% Achievement:**

1. **Administrative cross-check (BVN data)**: 67.8 million BVNs ÷ ~120 million adults = 56.5% maximum penetration as of December 2025. This is definitive administrative data from NIBSS, a reliable government agency. Even if some have accounts without BVN (unlikely post-2024 regulations), this provides a hard ceiling.

2. **Multiple independent sources confirm ~50-64% range**: 
   - EFInA 2023: 52% banked, 64% financial inclusion
   - Verivafrica 2023: 38% with savings accounts
   - Tax law article (Sep 2025): "more than 60 million" have accounts
   - All converge on 50-60% range, nowhere near 95%

3. **Absence of announcement**: If Nigeria achieved 95% by end-2024, this would be a major policy victory. CBN Governor Cardoso gave multiple speeches in 2025 (per sources) without mentioning this achievement. S&P Global's Feb 2026 banking outlook makes no mention. This is strong negative evidence.

4. **Structural barriers unchanged**: World Bank Oct 2025 report shows 62% poverty rate, 139 million in poverty. Cambridge study documents persistent gender gaps. These structural issues don't resolve in one year.

**Moderate Evidence Against:**

5. **Historical trajectory**: 2020 (51%) → 2023 (52%) shows stagnation, not acceleration. Would need 43 percentage point jump in one year - unprecedented.

6. **CBN's own 2020 projection**: Officials stated 95% wouldn't be reached until ~2030, acknowledging the target was unrealistic.

**Weak Evidence (Potentially Supporting):**

7. **Fintech growth**: 70% sector growth in 2025 could theoretically accelerate inclusion, but no sources link this to achieving 95% penetration.

8. **NRBVN diaspora initiative**: Launched in 2025 but targets niche population, not mass inclusion.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Critical Context**: The question asks about achievement "before 2025" (i.e., by December 31, 2024). Today is February 5, 2026. The outcome has already occurred - we're evaluating a historical event, not making a future prediction.

**Resolution Timeline**: Question resolves March 1, 2026, based on available data through 2024.

**Key Timing Insight**: We have post-period data (BVN enrollments through December 2025) that provides strong evidence about the 2024 situation. If 95% had been achieved by end-2024, BVN enrollments would have shown dramatic acceleration to ~114 million by December 2024. Instead, they reached only 63.5 million (per sources), suggesting ~53% penetration.

**If timeframe were different**:
- Halved (6 months): Even less plausible - impossible to add 50+ million accounts
- Doubled (2 years to end-2026): Still highly unlikely but marginally more plausible; might increase probability from 1% to 3-5%

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

**Base Rate**: My outside view established 1% probability based on historical trajectory and structural barriers.

**Current Evidence Impact**:

The post-period administrative data (67.8 million BVNs in Dec 2025, implying 63.5 million in Dec 2024) provides near-definitive evidence. This is not survey data subject to sampling error - it's administrative records from the banking system.

**Mathematical Reality**:
- Dec 2024: ~63.5 million BVNs
- Adult population: ~120 million
- Penetration: 52.9%
- Gap to 95%: 42.1 percentage points
- Would require: ~50 million additional accounts in 2024

**Why This Evidence is Decisive**:

1. **Direct measurement**: BVN data directly measures bank account holders
2. **Regulatory requirement**: Post-2024, BVN is mandatory for account operation
3. **No alternative pathway**: Can't have 95% bank account ownership with only 53% BVN enrollment
4. **Timing**: Data is from the exact resolution period

**Remaining Uncertainty** (why not 0%):
- Possible data errors or delays in BVN reporting
- Definitional ambiguity in "bank account" vs "financial institution account"
- Extremely remote chance of measurement methodology change
- Small probability resolution uses different data source showing higher number

However, these uncertainties are minimal. The convergence of:
- Administrative data (BVN)
- Survey data (EFInA)
- Expert statements (no achievement announced)
- Structural reality (poverty, gender gaps persist)

...makes the case overwhelming.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate**: 1% (from outside view)

**Adjustment factors**:
- BVN administrative data: Strong evidence, should reduce further
- Multiple confirming sources: Reinforces low probability
- Absence of announcement: Strong negative signal
- Post-period data available: Reduces uncertainty

**Calibrated probability**: 0.5%

This represents:
- 1 in 200 chance the target was achieved
- Accounts for minimal data uncertainty and definitional ambiguity
- Recognizes we have near-definitive administrative evidence
- Appropriately low given mathematical impossibility of the required growth

**Probability sense check**: "0.5 out of 100 times, 95% of Nigerian adults had bank accounts by end-2024." Given that administrative data shows only ~53% penetration, this seems appropriately skeptical while acknowledging irreducible measurement uncertainty.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Did 95%+ of Nigerian adults (18+) have bank/financial institution accounts by Dec 31, 2024? Resolution by March 1, 2026 using CBN or World Bank data.

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view was 1% based on historical trajectory. Current evidence (BVN administrative data showing ~53% in Dec 2024) strongly confirms this low probability. Slight downward adjustment to 0.5% is justified.

3. **Consistency check**: "0.5 out of 100 times, 95% of Nigerian adults had bank accounts by end-2024." This aligns with the mathematical impossibility given BVN data showing only 63.5 million accounts (53% penetration) in Dec 2024.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - BVN enrollments: 63.5M in Dec 2024 = 53% of adults (definitive administrative data)
   - No CBN/government announcement of achievement despite being major policy goal
   - Multiple 2025 sources cite 52-64% financial inclusion, none mention 95% achievement
   - World Bank/expert sources describe persistent structural barriers unchanged in 2024

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: CBN used alternative methodology (e.g., including mobile money wallets as "financial institution accounts") that technically meets 95% threshold. This could make forecast wrong, but would require radical definitional departure. Might shift probability to 2-3%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo strongly favors "No" resolution. Financial inclusion rates change slowly. The required 42 percentage point jump in one year has no precedent. Administrative data confirms status quo persisted through 2024.

Probability: 0.5%
