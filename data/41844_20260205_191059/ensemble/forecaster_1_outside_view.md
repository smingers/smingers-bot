- Notes that 95% target by 2024 was missed
- CBN acknowledged in 2020 that target wouldn't be reached until ~2030

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Nigerian Financial Inclusion Progress (2018-2023)**
- Historical growth: 39.7% (2018) → 51% (2020) → 52% (2023)
- Suitability: HIGH - Most directly relevant
- Pattern: Rapid initial growth (11.3 percentage points in 2 years), then plateau (1 percentage point in 3 years)

**Reference Class 2: Ambitious National Financial Inclusion Targets**
- Many developing countries set aggressive targets
- Actual achievement rates typically fall far short
- Suitability: MODERATE - Provides context on target feasibility
- Pattern: Targets like 95% in 5 years rarely achieved

**Reference Class 3: BVN Enrollment Growth**
- 51.9M (2021) → 66.2M (July 2025) = 14.3M increase over 4.5 years
- Average annual growth: ~3.2 million accounts
- Suitability: HIGH - Provides administrative data cross-check
- Pattern: Steady linear growth, not exponential

**Most Suitable Reference Class: Nigerian Financial Inclusion Progress (2018-2023)**
This is most relevant because it tracks the exact metric (bank account ownership) in the exact population (Nigerian adults) over the immediately preceding period.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Question asks about achievement "before 2025" (i.e., by December 31, 2024)
- Today is February 5, 2026
- We are evaluating a PAST event - whether the target was achieved by end of 2024

**Critical Timing Insight:**
The question resolution period has already passed. The outcome has already occurred; we're simply awaiting official data publication (by March 1, 2026).

**Historical Pattern Over Similar Periods:**
- 2018-2020 (2 years): +11.3 percentage points (39.7% → 51%)
- 2020-2023 (3 years): +1 percentage point (51% → 52%)
- 2023-2024 (1 year): Unknown, but would need +43 percentage points (52% → 95%)

The required acceleration (43 percentage points in one year) would be:
- 43× faster than the 2020-2023 rate
- 4× faster than the unprecedented 2018-2020 surge

## (d) Justification

**Key Evidence Against 95% Achievement:**

1. **Baseline Starting Point**: As of 2023, only 52% of Nigerian adults had bank accounts - a 43 percentage point gap to the 95% target

2. **Recent Growth Trajectory**: After rapid growth 2018-2020, progress essentially stalled at 52% through 2023, suggesting structural barriers

3. **Administrative Data Cross-Check**: 66.2 million BVN-linked accounts (July 2025) divided by Nigeria's ~120 million adult population = approximately 55%, consistent with survey data showing ~52%

4. **Expert Acknowledgment**: CBN itself stated in 2020 that the 95% target wouldn't be reached until approximately 2030

5. **Structural Barriers Persist**: 
   - Gender gap remains significant (12 percentage points)
   - Regional disparities exceed 20 percentage points
   - 26% of adults remained excluded as of early 2026 per CBN reports

6. **Required vs. Plausible Growth**: Achieving 95% by end-2024 would require adding ~52 million bank accounts in one year (from ~68M to ~120M adults), when historical growth averaged only 3-4 million per year

7. **No Evidence of Breakthrough**: None of the sources from 2025 suggest a dramatic acceleration occurred. The NRBVN diaspora initiative, while positive, targets a specific niche rather than mass inclusion

8. **Data Publication Timeline**: If 95% had been achieved, this would be a major policy success that CBN would have announced immediately. The fact that we're in February 2026 without such announcement is telling

**Evidence For (Minimal):**
- Mobile money and fintech expansion could theoretically accelerate inclusion
- Government policy focus remained on the target
- However, no sources suggest this acceleration actually materialized

Outside view calibration:

The question asks whether 95% of Nigerians had bank accounts before 2025. Given that:

1. The most recent reliable data (2023) showed 52% bank account ownership
2. Administrative data from mid-2025 suggests ~55% at most
3. The required jump (43 percentage points in 1 year) would be unprecedented
4. CBN itself projected the target wouldn't be met until 2030
5. No sources report achievement of the target
6. The resolution period has passed and no celebratory announcements have been made

The probability this target was achieved is extremely low. However, I must account for:
- Possibility of unreported data showing dramatic improvement
- Measurement uncertainty in surveys vs. administrative data
- Small chance of definitional changes that could technically meet the threshold

Given the overwhelming evidence and the fact that such a dramatic achievement would certainly have been announced, I assess the probability at the very low end of the spectrum.
