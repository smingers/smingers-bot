Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical/Background Sources:**
1. **CEICDATA (2007-2016)**: Provides deposit accounts per 1,000 adults (813.59 in 2016). Factual administrative data but outdated and measures accounts, not individuals. Low relevance due to age.

2. **FRED metadata**: Technical documentation only, no actual data values. Not useful for analysis.

3. **Verivafrica (2023 data)**: Reports 74% financial inclusion, 38% savings accounts, 52% transaction accounts. Secondary source citing unspecified data. Moderate quality - aligns with other 2023 estimates but lacks primary attribution.

4. **Cambridge Journal (2021 publication, 2019-2020 data)**: Peer-reviewed academic source. Reports 31% of women banked vs 61% of men in 2019 (EFInA data). High quality but dated. Factual: gender gap persists.

**Recent News Sources (2025-2026):**

5. **Punch (May 2025)**: Reports 64% financial inclusion in 2023 (EFInA). Factual data from identifiable source. Notes diaspora remittance initiatives. Moderate-high quality.

6. **The Nation (June 2025)**: Reports e-payment transactions hit N1.07 quadrillion in 2024. Factual CBN data. Opinion from CBN Governor Cardoso and economist Kale on leveraging fintech. High quality for payment trends, but doesn't directly measure account ownership.

7. **Multiple sources (Jan 2026)**: **BVN enrollment reached 67.8 million by Dec 2025** (NIBSS data), up from 63.5 million in Dec 2024. **325 million active bank accounts** exist (Aug 2025). These are strong factual administrative records. The discrepancy (67.8m BVNs vs 325m accounts) indicates multiple accounts per person. With ~124 million adults (18+) in Nigeria, this suggests ~55% have BVNs/bank access.

8. **S&P Global reports (Feb 2026)**: Multiple articles on banking sector outlook. Factual data on NPLs, profitability, government securities. Opinion from S&P analysts. High quality but focused on banking sector health, not inclusion rates.

9. **CBN Fintech Report (Feb 2026)**: Reports 70% fintech growth in 2025, nearly 11 billion e-transactions processed. Factual from CBN. Discusses infrastructure challenges and compliance costs. High quality for digital payments, indirect for account ownership.

10. **World Bank (Oct 2025)**: Projects 139 million Nigerians in poverty in 2025 (62% poverty rate). Factual projection from authoritative source. Indicates severe economic constraints limiting financial inclusion progress.

**Key Factual Findings:**
- BVN enrollment: 67.8 million (Dec 2025) out of ~124 million adults = ~55% maximum
- Last survey data: 52-64% financial inclusion in 2023 (EFInA)
- No source reports anywhere near 95% for 2024

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Against 95% threshold):**
- **BVN administrative data (67.8m / 124m adults = 55%)**: Multiple independent sources confirm this Dec 2025 figure. This is hard administrative data from NIBSS, the authoritative payment infrastructure body. Even if we assume every BVN holder has a bank account (generous), this is only 55%, not 95%.
- **Historical trajectory**: From 40% (2017) to ~52% (2023) = +12pp in 6 years = 2pp/year average. To reach 95% from 52% by Jan 2025 would require +43pp in 14 months - unprecedented.
- **Structural constraints**: World Bank reports 62% poverty rate, 139 million in poverty. Cambridge study shows persistent gender gaps. These are difficult-to-change structural barriers.

**Moderate Evidence (Against 95%):**
- **EFInA 2023 survey (64% financial inclusion, 38% savings accounts)**: Single reliable source with established methodology. However, "financial inclusion" is broader than "bank account ownership" - includes informal mechanisms.
- **Economic context**: S&P reports rising NPLs (7%), high regulatory costs, concentration risks. While banks are profitable, this indicates systemic stress, not rapid expansion to unbanked populations.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Fintech growth (70% in 2025)**: While impressive, this measures sector growth, not account penetration rates. Many e-payment transactions could be from existing account holders.
- **Diaspora initiatives (NRBVN)**: Launched in 2025, too recent to have generated 40+ million new accounts by end of 2024.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Critical timeline issue**: The question asks if 95% was achieved "before 2025" - meaning by December 31, 2024. Today is February 5, 2026. We are evaluating a **past event** that either happened or didn't happen 13+ months ago.

**Available data for the resolution period:**
- Dec 2024: 63.5 million BVNs (reported Jan 2026)
- 2023: 52-64% financial inclusion (EFInA survey)
- No 2024 survey data published yet

**If timeframe were halved (7 months to reach 95%)**: Impossibility would be even more extreme - would require ~6pp/month growth vs historical 0.17pp/month.

**If timeframe were doubled (28 months)**: Still highly improbable. Even India's aggressive Jan-Dhan scheme achieved ~6pp/year at peak. Nigeria would need ~20pp/year.

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

**Starting from outside view base rate of 1%:**

The outside view established that reaching 95% from 52% in 14 months is arithmetically near-impossible given:
- Nigeria's fastest historical rate: ~3pp/year (2018-2020)
- Required rate: ~37pp/year
- Best global comparator (India): ~6pp/year at peak

**Current evidence reinforces this impossibility:**

1. **Hard administrative ceiling**: BVN data shows maximum 55% by Dec 2025 (13 months AFTER the deadline). Even if 100% of BVN holders had accounts, this is 40 percentage points short.

2. **No evidence of discontinuous change**: The 2025-2026 news shows incremental progress (4.3m new BVNs in 2025 = +3.5pp), not the revolutionary transformation needed.

3. **Structural barriers persist**: Poverty rate 62%, gender gaps unchanged, infrastructure challenges cited by CBN's own reports.

4. **Resolution criteria clarity**: Question specifies "account at a bank or financial institution" per CBN or World Bank data. BVN is the most authoritative Nigerian administrative measure available, and it shows ~55% maximum.

**Adjustment considerations:**
- Could data be unpublished? Possible but unlikely - BVN data through Dec 2025 was published Jan 2026, suggesting no major gap.
- Could mobile money accounts count? Resolution criteria say "bank or financial institution" - mobile money operators might qualify, but EFInA's 64% "financial inclusion" (which includes mobile money) is still far from 95%.
- Measurement error? Even a generous +10pp error margin only reaches 65%.

**No credible scenario gets to 95% by end of 2024.**

The outside view of 1% was appropriate. Current evidence, if anything, suggests even that was generous. However, I'll maintain 1% rather than going lower to account for:
- Possible data reinterpretation by resolution source
- Small chance of unpublished survey showing different methodology
- Epistemic humility about unknown unknowns

## Probability Calibration

**Outside view: 1%**

**Inside view adjustments:**
- BVN administrative data (55% max): -0% (confirms impossibility)
- Historical trajectory analysis: -0% (confirms impossibility)
- Economic/structural barriers: -0% (confirms impossibility)
- No positive evidence found: -0%

**Final calibration: 1%**

This represents extreme confidence (99:1 odds against) that is justified by:
1. Hard administrative data showing only 55% maximum by Dec 2025 (post-deadline)
2. No plausible mechanism for 40pp jump in 14 months
3. Multiple independent sources confirming gradual, not revolutionary, progress

The 1% reservation accounts for tail risks like data reinterpretation or unknown measurement changes, not genuine belief the threshold was met.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Did 95%+ of Nigerian adults (18+) have a bank/financial institution account by Dec 31, 2024, per CBN or World Bank data?

2. **Base rate consistency**: Outside view of 1% based on impossibility of 52%→95% in 14 months. Current evidence strongly confirms this impossibility.

3. **Consistency check**: "1 out of 100 times, Nigeria achieved 95% bank account ownership by end of 2024." This aligns with the evidence - only plausible through data redefinition or measurement error, not actual achievement.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BVN enrollment 63.5m (Dec 2024) = ~51% of adults - factually verified, authoritative
   - EFInA 2023 survey: 52% banked, 64% financially included - reliable methodology
   - Historical max growth rate 3pp/year vs required 37pp/year - mathematical constraint
   - World Bank Oct 2025: 62% poverty rate persists - structural barrier confirmed
   - No contradicting evidence from any source - comprehensive search

5. **Blind spot**: CBN could have conducted an unpublished survey with dramatically different methodology (e.g., counting mobile money wallets as "accounts") showing 95%+. However, this would contradict their own BVN administrative data and seems implausible given consistent reporting patterns.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo in early 2024 was ~52% banked. The volatile scenario would be revolutionary change; the stable scenario is incremental progress. All evidence points to stable, incremental progress continuing (3-4pp gain in 2024-2025), making status quo forecast (far below 95%) highly robust.
