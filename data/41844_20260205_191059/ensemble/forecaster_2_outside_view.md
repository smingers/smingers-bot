Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**NIBSS Article (August 2025):**
- Reports 66.2 million BVN-linked bank account holders as of July 2025
- Source: Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), a credible financial infrastructure provider
- This is an administrative count, not a percentage of adult population
- Factual data point, though incomplete article extraction

**Guardian Nigeria (July 2025):**
- Global context: 79% global account ownership in 2024
- Nigeria identified as one of 8 countries with largest unbanked populations
- No specific Nigerian percentage provided
- Expert opinion from Ajay Banga (World Bank President) and Bill Gates on digital finance
- Primarily contextual rather than Nigeria-specific data

**Verivafrica (2023 data):**
- **Critical data point: 74% overall financial inclusion in 2023**
- **38% hold savings accounts with regulated institutions**
- 52% have transaction accounts/electronic payments
- Source quality uncertain (Verivafrica not independently verified as authoritative)

- Historical progression: 51.9M (2021) → 56M (2022) → 60.1M (2023) → 63.5M (2024) → 66.2M (July 2025)
- Opinion from CBN Governor Cardoso on NRBVN policy
- Factual administrative data from credible source (NIBSS)

**Punch Newspapers (May 2025):**

- Factual data from credible source

**Cambridge Journal Article:**
- **2020 EFInA data: 40% of 106 million adults (42 million) were financially excluded**
- This implies 60% inclusion in 2020
- Gender gap analysis: 31% of women vs 61% of men have formal accounts (2021)
- Academic source, peer-reviewed, citing EFInA data
- Highlights slow progress and persistent exclusion

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive synthesis of EFInA and CBN data
- **Key figures: 39.7% banked (2018), 51% restated (2020), 52% banked (2023)**
- **Overall financial inclusion: 74% (2023)**
- **Formal inclusion: 64% (2023)**
- CBN acknowledged in 2020 that target wouldn't be reached until ~2030
- High-quality synthesis with clear source attribution

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Nigeria's own financial inclusion trajectory (2018-2023)**
   - Most relevant: Same country, same measurement system
   - Shows bank account ownership: 39.7% (2018) → 51% (2020) → 52% (2023)
   - Annual growth rate effectively stalled after 2020
   - Suitability: HIGH - most direct evidence

2. **Ambitious financial inclusion targets in developing economies**
   - Many countries set aspirational targets that are rarely met
   - India, Pakistan mentioned as successful models but took decades
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - provides context but less specific

3. **Sub-Saharan African financial inclusion trends**
   - Regional patterns show mobile money driving growth
   - Nigeria specifically identified as lagging
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - useful context but Nigeria-specific data more relevant

**Selected Reference Class:** Nigeria's own financial inclusion trajectory (2018-2023) is most suitable given direct measurement continuity and country-specific factors.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Question resolves based on data through December 31, 2024
- Today is February 5, 2026
- The outcome has already occurred; we're waiting for official data publication by March 1, 2026

**Historical Patterns:**
- 2018-2020: Rapid growth (39.7% → 51% banked = +11.3 percentage points over 2 years)
- 2020-2023: Stagnation (51% → 52% banked = +1 percentage point over 3 years)
- Overall financial inclusion reached 74% by 2023, still 21 points short of 95%
- Bank account ownership (52% in 2023) is 43 points short of 95%

**Critical Timeline Issues:**
- The 95% target specifically refers to bank accounts at financial institutions
- Even the broader "financial inclusion" measure (which includes mobile money, informal savings) only reached 74% by 2023
- To reach 95% bank account ownership by end-2024 would require a 43-percentage-point jump in one year
- Historical maximum growth was 11.3 points over two years (2018-2020)

## (d) Justification

**Multiple converging lines of evidence indicate the 95% target was not met:**

1. **Trajectory Analysis:** Bank account ownership grew from 39.7% (2018) to 52% (2023), then essentially plateaued. The 2020-2023 period showed only 1 percentage point growth over 3 years. A sudden 43-point acceleration in 2024 would be unprecedented and contradicts the stagnation trend.

2. **Administrative Data:** BVN-linked accounts reached 66.2 million by July 2025. Nigeria's adult population (18+) is approximately 110-120 million, suggesting ~55-60% coverage at most, far below 95%.

3. **Official Acknowledgment:** CBN itself stated in 2020 that the target wouldn't be reached until around 2030, showing internal recognition of the gap.

4. **Broader Inclusion Still Below Target:** Even the most generous measure (overall financial inclusion including mobile money and informal channels) only reached 74% by 2023. The narrower bank account measure at 52% would need to exceed the broader measure to hit 95%, which is logically impossible.

5. **Structural Barriers:** The Cambridge article highlights persistent gender gaps (30-point difference) and regional disparities (20+ points), plus 40% of adults remain financially excluded. These structural issues cannot be resolved in one year.

6. **No Contradictory Evidence:** None of the sources from 2024-2025 suggest a dramatic breakthrough. The focus on diaspora banking (NRBVN) and incremental BVN growth indicates business-as-usual progress.

Outside view calibration:

The question asks whether 95% or more of Nigerian adults had a bank account before January 1, 2025. Based on the evidence:

- **Latest verified data point:** 52% bank account ownership in 2023 (EFInA)
- **Gap to target:** 43 percentage points
- **Time available:** One year (2024)
- **Historical precedent:** Maximum growth was 11.3 points over 2 years; recent trend shows stagnation
- **Administrative data:** July 2025 BVN count suggests ~55-60% coverage maximum

The probability of achieving a 43-percentage-point increase in one year, when:
- The previous 3 years showed only 1 point growth
- CBN acknowledged the target was unattainable
- No sources suggest a dramatic 2024 breakthrough
- Even the broader financial inclusion measure was only at 74%

This is essentially asking: "Could Nigeria have added ~50 million new bank accounts in 2024?" The BVN data showing 66.2 million total accounts by mid-2025 (growing from 63.5 million in late 2024) suggests this did not happen.

The probability is not literally zero (data could be wrong, definitions could have changed, mobile money might be reclassified), but these scenarios are highly unlikely. I estimate the true probability at approximately 1%, accounting for:
- 0.5% chance of measurement/definition changes
- 0.3% chance of unreported breakthrough
- 0.2% chance of data errors in my sources
