Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / alignment with resolution criteria
Resolve “Yes” iff **≥95% of Nigerians aged 18+** had **an account at a bank or financial institution** **before Jan 1, 2025**, using **CBN data** if available; otherwise World Bank / credible researchers.

This is **not** “% financially included” broadly, and **not** “# of accounts” (which can include multiple accounts per person).

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; fact vs opinion)

**CEIC (banking indicators; data through 2016)**
- *Factual:* “Deposit accounts per 1,000 adults (commercial banks)” peaked at **813.59 in 2016**; branches per 100k adults **5.36 (2016)**.
- *Quality:* Reasonably credible data aggregator, but **old (ends 2016)** and **wrong construct** (accounts per adult ≠ % adults with an account; duplicates possible).

**FRED/World Bank metadata page (IMF FAS series)**
- *Factual:* Describes a series: depositors with commercial banks per 1,000 adults (GFDD.AI.01).
- *Quality:* Highly credible as metadata, but provides **no Nigeria values** in the excerpt; also **depositors at commercial banks** may not match the question’s broader “bank or financial institution.”

**Verivafrica article (claims about 2023)**
- *Factual claims (but sourcing unclear in excerpt):* 74% “financial inclusion” (2023); 52% transaction account/e-payments; 38% savings.
- *Quality:* Medium-to-low for forecasting the resolution criterion because **methodology and sources aren’t shown** in the provided extract; also mixes constructs.

**Punch (May 18, 2025) citing EFInA**
- *Factual:* “Financial inclusion access” rose **56% (2020) → 64% (2023)** per EFInA.
- *Quality:* Punch is mainstream; EFInA is a recognized survey source for Nigeria inclusion. Still, it’s **“access/inclusion,” not necessarily “account ownership,”** and it’s **2023**, not 2024.

**The Nation (Jun 30, 2025)**
- *Factual:* e-payment value hit **₦1.07 quadrillion in 2024**, volume ~**11.2B** transactions.
- *Opinion:* Quotes urging better KYC, etc.
- *Quality:* Useful for “digital payments grew,” but **weakly linked** to “95% adults have accounts” (payments can be via agents/wallets; growth ≠ near-universal ownership).

**Cambridge journal (Data & Policy)**
- *Factual (citing EFInA/World Bank):* Large exclusion persists; large gender gap; notes measurement discrepancies.
- *Quality:* High (peer-reviewed), but figures are mostly **2019–2021/2020** and discuss “formal account” vs broader inclusion; still supports slow progress.

**AskNews: Vanguard (Jan 9, 2026) / Guardian (Jan 8, 2026) / Nairametrics (Jan 8, 2026) on NIBSS BVN**
- *Factual:* **BVN enrollments 67.8M as of Dec 2025** (up from 63.5M in Dec 2024). Also reports **~325M active bank accounts** (Aug 2025), implying many accounts per BVN/person.
- *Quality:* Moderate-to-high for BVN counts because it’s attributed to **NIBSS** (core payments/ID infrastructure). However, **BVN ≠ unique adults with any “account at a bank/financial institution”** (coverage gaps; some accounts may exist without BVN historically; and microfinance/mobile wallets may differ). Still, it strongly constrains any plausible path to 95% by end-2024.

**AskNews: CBN fintech/e-payments reports (Feb 3, 2026; Punch/Daily Post summaries)**
- *Factual:* “fintech grew 70% in 2025” (CBN report); ~11B e-transactions in 2024; NIP share, etc.
- *Quality:* Good for trend (CBN), but **not a direct measure** of adult account ownership by 2024.

**AskNews: Nairaland post on Tax Admin Act 2025 (Sep 2025)**
- *Factual claim:* Says only 10M registered taxpayers, “more than 60M Nigerians hold bank accounts,” and TIN required from 2026.
- *Quality:* Low-to-moderate: Nairaland is not an official outlet; treat numbers cautiously. Also **post-2024 policy** doesn’t establish 2024 account penetration.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criterion)

**Strong evidence (large downward pressure on “Yes”)**
1. **EFInA-based inclusion levels well below 95% by 2023** (Punch citing EFInA: 64% “access” in 2023). Even a broader inclusion metric being 64% in 2023 makes **95% bank-account ownership by end-2024 extremely implausible**.
2. **NIBSS BVN enrollments ~67.8M by Dec 2025** (multiple outlets attributing to NIBSS). With Nigeria’s adult population plausibly on the order of ~100M+, **95% would imply ~95M+ adults with accounts**—hard to reconcile with BVN counts so shortly after 2024, even allowing for measurement mismatch.

**Moderate evidence**
3. **Explosive growth in e-payments and fintech activity (CBN/S&P summaries; 2024–2025)** shows momentum in digitization and rails—but historically **usage growth does not translate into ~universal account ownership** quickly, especially with KYC/ID, poverty, rural access, and gender gaps.
4. **CEIC “deposit accounts per 1,000 adults” (2016: 814)** suggests many accounts exist, but cannot imply 95% of adults have at least one account (duplicates; definitional differences).

**Weak evidence**
5. Verivafrica “74% inclusion” (2023) without visible sourcing in the excerpt: directionally consistent (still far from 95%) but low weight.
6. Commentary/policy goals (CBN target statements; optimism): intentions are not outcomes.

Net: the evidence stack overwhelmingly supports **No**; the remaining uncertainty is mostly definitional/reporting (could “financial institution account” be broadened to include mobile money wallets in an official series?)—but even that seems unlikely to reach **95% by 2024** given the 2023 levels.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Outcome window is fixed: **before Jan 1, 2025**. As of today (**Feb 5, 2026**), the real-world outcome is already determined; we’re forecasting what the eventual **official measurement** will show.
- Time to potential “no data by Mar 1, 2026 ⇒ No” is ~**25 days**.
- If the remaining time were **halved/doubled**, it wouldn’t materially change the underlying reality (2024 is over). The only change would be the probability that **a surprising dataset/definition** appears before the deadline. That probability is small either way.

---

### (d) Justification: how inside view updates the outside view (1%)
**Outside view base rate:** 1% “Yes” (from your provided outside-view analysis).

**Key inside-view update:** The **NIBSS BVN=67.8M (Dec 2025)** and **EFInA-style levels (2023 far below 95%)** jointly make “≥95% by end-2024” not just unlikely but **near-impossible** absent a radical definitional shift (e.g., counting most mobile wallets as “accounts at a financial institution” and documenting a step-change in 2024).

- To reach 95% by end-2024 from ~2023 levels (roughly 50–65% depending on definition), Nigeria would need an unprecedented, nationwide jump in formal/regulated account ownership in **one year**, despite persistent poverty, ID/KYC friction, gender gaps, and infrastructure constraints.
- The digital rails growth is real, but it mainly supports “more transactions,” not “near-universal unique adult account ownership.”

**Main residual uncertainty (why not 0%)**
- A **measurement/definition** used by CBN (or a substitute resolver source) could count “accounts” in a way that effectively includes most adults via agent wallets/fintech onboarding, and could be reported with a surprisingly high figure.
- But this would have to be both (i) **methodologically accepted** for resolution and (ii) show **≥95%** by 2024—still a stretch.

So I move the probability **down modestly** from 1% to reflect stronger constraint from BVN/EFInA evidence, while preserving a small tail for definitional/reporting surprises.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: **1%**
- Inside view adjustment: strong convergent evidence (EFInA levels + BVN constraint) → reduce by about half to two-thirds.
- Final inside-view probability (Yes): **0.5%**

A ±10% shift is not credible here: the event would require an extraordinary, well-documented inclusion surge by 2024, which conflicts with multiple indicators. The appropriate uncertainty is in the **sub-1%** range, not in the tens of percent.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Yes if ≥95% of Nigerian adults (18+) had an account at a bank/financial institution before 2025, per CBN (else WB/credible).
2. **Outside view base rate:** 1% Yes.
3. **Consistency:** “About 1 out of 200 times, Nigeria hits ≥95% adult account ownership by end-2024.” Plausible given evidence.
4. **Top evidence:** (i) EFInA via Punch: 64% access in 2023. (ii) NIBSS BVN 67.8M in Dec 2025. (iii) 2024 e-payments boom doesn’t imply 95% ownership.
5. **Blind spot:** A definitional change that counts most mobile wallets/agents as regulated “accounts,” producing an official ≥95% figure for 2024.
6. **Status quo:** Slow-moving structural inclusion barriers imply continued gap from 95%; status quo favors “No.”

Probability: 0.5%
