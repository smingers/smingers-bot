Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1. **NIBSS page snippet (Aug 4, 2025) — “BVN-linked bank account holders: 66.2m”**  
   - **Factual claim:** 66.2 million BVN-linked bank-account holders.  
   - **Quality:** The provided scrape looks like a **navigation/menu** rather than the full article, so context/definitions are missing. NIBSS is a credible payments/banking infrastructure entity, but **the excerpt is incomplete** and we can’t verify whether “66.2m” refers to unique adults (18+), unique BVNs, or something else.  
   - **Usefulness:** Directionally helpful as an *administrative proxy*, but **not a clean measure** of “% of adults with an account.”

2. **Guardian Nigeria (Jul 17, 2025) — “Mobile money leads Nigeria’s financial inclusion drive”**  
   - **Factual claims (global):** cites global account ownership around **79% in 2024**, and notes Nigeria is among countries with large unbanked populations.  
   - **Quality:** Reputable mainstream outlet; but **does not provide Nigeria’s % banked** and mixes “accounts” across banks/mobile money in a global context.  
   - **Opinions:** Quotes (Ajay Banga, Bill Gates) are general pro-digital-finance statements; not specific forecasts about Nigeria hitting 95% by 2024.

3. **Verivafrica article (Nigeria 2023 stats)**  
   - **Factual claims:** “Overall financial inclusion 74% (2023)”; “transaction accounts/e-payments 52%”; “savings/bank account 38%”; etc.  
   - **Quality:** Secondary source; the summary indicates **missing/cut-off citations**, so provenance is unclear. Potential definition mismatch (e.g., “savings account” vs “any account”).  
   - **Usefulness:** Suggests Nigeria is **well below 95%** under most plausible definitions, but I weight it lightly.

4. **Thisdaylive (Aug 2025) — NRBVN + BVN counts (63.5m Dec 2024; 66.2m Jul 2025)**  
   - **Factual claims:** A time series of BVN-linked account owners: **60.1m (2023), 63.5m (Dec 2024), 66.2m (Jul 2025)**, etc.  
   - **Quality:** Mainstream outlet; figures attributed to CBN/BVN context. Still, BVN-based counts can diverge from “% of adults with an account” because: (i) under-18s could be included/excluded depending on policy, (ii) some adults have accounts but BVN issues, (iii) measurement is “BVN-linked bank account owners,” not necessarily “all accounts at any financial institution.”  
   - **Usefulness:** Strong evidence Nigeria was **nowhere near universal adult coverage** by end-2024.

5. **Punch (May 18, 2025) — EFInA: inclusion 56% (2020) to 64% (2023)**  
   - **Factual claims:** EFInA-reported *financial inclusion access* rose **56%→64%** (2020→2023).  
   - **Quality:** Reputable; cites EFInA (a key Nigerian inclusion measurement org). But the statistic is **broader than bank-account ownership** (likely includes non-bank formal channels and possibly informal).  
   - **Usefulness:** Reinforces that even the broad inclusion metric is far from 95% by 2023.

6. **Cambridge “Data & Policy” article (academic, includes EFInA references, 2008–2020 gender exclusion)**  
   - **Factual claims:** Persistent exclusion, especially for women; slow progress; cites EFInA data historically.  
   - **Quality:** High on rigor, but **not directly answering** 2024 “% adults with a bank account.” Useful for structural “friction” arguments (hard-to-reach populations persist).

7. **Agent_report (compilation of EFInA/CBN-relevant “banked” series; compares to 95% target)**  
   - **Factual claims (key):** EFInA “banked” ~**39.7% (2018)**; **~51% (restated 2020)**; **~52% (2023)**. EFInA overall inclusion **74%** and formal **64%** in 2023. Also cites a CBN-adjacent statement implying targets might slip to ~2030 at current pace (via a GOV.UK summary).  
   - **Quality:** Helpful synthesis, but it’s a **meta-assembled report** with potential for citation/interpretation errors. Still, the EFInA numbers align with multiple other hints (Nigeria still heavily unbanked).  
   - **Usefulness:** Best single anchor for an outside-view baseline: Nigeria’s “banked” rate appears roughly **~40–52%** over 2018–2023, implying **very low** chance of 95% by end-2024.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

To estimate the probability Nigeria reached **≥95% adult account ownership by end-2024**, good reference classes are:

1. **Countries starting around ~40% adult account ownership and attempting to reach ~95% within ~7 years (2017→2024).**  
   - This is the most direct class. Historically, jumps of **+50 percentage points in <10 years** happen, but are **rare** and usually involve: (i) massive policy pushes, (ii) rapid digital ID + mobile money scale, (iii) strong state capacity, (iv) high smartphone/agent density, (v) often smaller/higher-income or more administratively cohesive contexts than Nigeria.  
   - Suitability: **High.**

2. **Sub-Saharan African large-population countries’ trajectories in Global Findex / EFInA-like measures.**  
   - Many improve, but reaching **near-universal (95%+)** is uncommon in the region by 2024.  
   - Suitability: **Medium-high** (regional comparability, but Nigeria has unique scale/fragmentation/security challenges).

3. **“Policy target” reference class: central bank-set inclusion targets vs realized outcomes.**  
   - Such targets are often aspirational; hitting 95% by a fixed date is **low base-rate** unless already near saturation.  
   - Suitability: **Medium** (good for priors about target-achievement, but less quantitative).

**Chosen primary reference class:** (1) “~40% to 95% in ~7 years” because it maps directly to the numeric hurdle.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- Outcome window: **before Jan 1, 2025** (already in the past relative to today, 2026-02-05).  
- The question is essentially: “Did Nigeria achieve 95% by end-2024?”  
- Historical pattern: From the prompt and compiled sources, Nigeria moved roughly:
  - **~30% (2011)** → **~40% (2017/2018)**: about **+10 pp over ~6 years** (~1.5–2 pp/year).
  - EFInA “banked”: **39.7% (2018)** → **~52% (2023)**: about **+12 pp over 5 years** (~2.4 pp/year), with evidence of **plateauing** near 2020–2023 (51%→52%).
- To hit **95% by end-2024** from ~40% in 2017 would require **~+55 pp in ~7 years (~8 pp/year)**, or from 52% in 2023 to 95% in 2024 would require **+43 pp in ~1 year**—both far outside historical patterns.

### (d) Justification (integrating base rates + the hurdle)

**Base-rate (outside view) intuition:**  
- Reaching **95% adult account ownership** is typically a “late-stage saturation” milestone; it’s hard even for many middle-income countries, and tends to require (a) near-universal ID coverage, (b) trust and accessibility, (c) dense financial infrastructure or ubiquitous mobile money rails, and (d) strong enforcement/mandates or strong market pull.  
- Nigeria’s credible “banked” anchors in the provided material cluster around **~40–52%** across 2018–2023, while broader “financial inclusion” measures are **~64–74%** by 2023—still materially below 95%. Even if inclusion rose quickly after 2023, the **magnitude** required to reach 95% by end-2024 is extraordinary.

**Structural reasons (still outside-view compatible) the tail outcome is unlikely:**  
- Nigeria is a very large country with substantial rural populations, security-affected regions, and persistent gender/region gaps (as noted in the academic summary). These are exactly the “last-mile” barriers that make getting from, say, 70% to 95% harder than from 30% to 55%.  
- Administrative proxies (BVN-linked counts ~63.5m by Dec 2024) suggest *scale-up*, but absent an adult population denominator, it still doesn’t smell like **near-universal adult coverage**.

Overall, the outside view says: **Hitting 95% by end-2024 is a very extreme outcome**, inconsistent with typical national trajectories and with the trend implied by multiple sources.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether point:** 2017/2018 ~40% and 2023 ~52% “banked” (EFInA/World Bank-like).  
- **Distance to threshold:** Need +43 pp from 2023 to 2024, or +55 pp from 2017 to 2024.  
- **Reference-class likelihood:** For a large lower-middle-income country to jump from ~50% to ~95% in ~1–2 years is so rare that the base rate is **well under 1%**.  
- **Residual probability (why not 0%):** measurement/definition mismatches (e.g., if “account at a financial institution” were interpreted very broadly and some survey undercount existed) could, in principle, create surprises. But given the sources pointing to large unbanked numbers even in 2024/2025, that residual seems tiny.

So I’d place the outside-view probability at about **1%** (already an “upper bound-ish” concession to uncertainty/definitions).

Outside View Prediction:
**1%**
