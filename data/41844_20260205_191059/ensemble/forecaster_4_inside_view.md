Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

   • EFInA Financial Inclusion Survey 2023 (quoted by Punch 18-May-2025, The Nation 30-Jun-2025)  
     – Factual: “Financial inclusion access 64 % in 2023, up from 56 % in 2020.”  
     – Quality: EFInA is the gold-standard survey for Nigeria; methodology public; sample ≥27 000 adults.  
     – Opinion: None.  
     – Weight: Strong.

   • Verivafrica article (2023 snapshot)  
     – Factual: “Savings/bank-account ownership 38 % of adults.” Source citation unclear.  
     – Quality: Medium; secondary blog-type site, methodology not shown.  
     – Weight: Weak-to-moderate.

   • NIBSS / BVN press releases (Dec-2024 63.5 m BVNs; Jul-2025 66.2 m; Dec-2025 67.8 m) – reported by Vanguard 09-Jan-2026, Guardian 08-Jan-2026, Nairametrics 08-Jan-2026  
     – Factual: Unique biometric IDs issued to account holders.  
     – Quality: Administrative data from national switch operator; very reliable, but BVN ≠ “all adults with an account” (children excluded, some accounts still un-linked, many adults hold ≥1 account).  
     – Weight: Moderate (good minimum bound).

   • Cambridge “AI for Women’s Financial Inclusion” (academic, 2024 publication)  
     – Factual: 40 % of women excluded in 2020; slow progress, wide gender gap.  
     – Quality: Peer-reviewed, uses EFInA & World Bank.  
     – Weight: Moderate (structural headwinds).

   • CEIC / FRED series on “depositors per 1 000 adults” (data to 2016)  
     – Factual: 814 deposit accounts/1000 adults in 2016.  
     – Quality: Good but outdated; metric double-counts users with ≥2 accounts.  
     – Weight: Weak for 2024 target.

   • AskNews 2026 banking & fintech coverage (S&P outlook, CBN fintech report, etc.)  
     – Factual: Explosive e-payment volume, 70 % fintech revenue growth, NRBVN launch.  
     – Opinion: Analysts optimistic on future inclusion.  
     – Relevance: Shows momentum but gives no 95 % claim.  
     – Weight: Weak (post-2024, indirect).

2. Evidence analysis (per weighting system)

   Strong evidence (down-weight probability of “Yes”):
   – EFInA 2023: only 64 % adults formally included (still >30 pp gap).  
   – NIBSS BVN 2025: 67.8 m unique BVNs vs ≈120 m adults ⇒ ≤57 % banked.

   Moderate evidence (also negative):
   – Persistent 12-point gender gap (academia).  
   – Historical trend: +1.5–2.5 pp/yr improvement 2011-2023, far below +40 pp needed 2023-2024.

   Weak positive evidence (tilts upward slightly):
   – Rapid growth of mobile money / e-payments 2023-2025.  
   – Regulatory mandates: BVN+NIN freeze (April 2024) may have pushed some unbanked into the system.

   Net effect: evidence overwhelmingly indicates Nigeria remained well below 95 % by 31-Dec-2024.

3. Timeframe analysis

   • Days until resolution: 25.  
   • For “Yes”, two things must happen before 01-Mar-2026:  
     1) CBN (or World Bank) releases new, credible data for a date ≤ 31-Dec-2024;  
     2) Data show ≥95 % of adults (18+) own an account.  
   • Probability of such a dramatic, heretofore-undisclosed reversal appearing falls roughly with t² as the window shrinks. Halving the time (≈12 days) would lower my odds by ~40 %; doubling (≈50 days) would raise them only slightly, to ~0.4 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

   Outside-view base rate (1 %): Large, low-/middle-income countries jumping 50+ pp in ≤7 yrs is almost unseen.

   Inside-view downward shifts:
   – Strong contemporary data (EFInA, NIBSS) pin Nigeria at 50–65 % by 2023–2025 (–0.5 pp).  
   – No public statement by CBN, World Bank, or EFInA claiming 95 % (–0.3 pp).  
   – Structural drag: insecurity, rural reach, gender gap (–0.1 pp).  
   Upward nudges: fintech boom & coercive KYC mandates (+0.2 pp).

   Net: 1 % → 0.3 % (≈3 chances in 1 000).

Probability calibration

   I assign a 0.3 % chance that 95 % or more of Nigerians aged 18+ had a bank or formal financial-institution account before 01-Jan-2025 and that such evidence emerges before 01-Mar-2026. Equivalent odds: about 1 in 333.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “By 31-Dec-2024, did ≥95 % of Nigerian adults own an account? Resolve Yes if credible data show so; deadline 01-Mar-2026.”  
2. Base rate: 1 %.  
3. Consistency: “0.3 times out of 100, criterion met.”  
4. Key evidence: a) EFInA 64 % in 2023, b) BVN 63.5 m Dec-2024, c) No official 95 % claim, d) historic +2 pp/yr trend, e) wide gender/rural gaps.  
5. Blind-spot: Unpublicised 2024 household survey with radically different definition quietly released next week.  
6. Status-quo: All trend data and silence from authorities imply “No”.

Probability: 0.3%
