Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. NIBSS (Aug 2025) – Administrative count of 66.2 million BVN–linked bank-account holders.  • Factual: absolute number.  • Limitation: does not cover adults without BVN; BVN ≠ unique adults (multiple accounts possible).  
2. Guardian (Jul 2025) – Global review of inclusion.  • Factual: cites World Bank 2024 Global FINDEX.  • Opinion: Nigeria listed among eight largest un-banked countries.  • Relevance: confirms Nigeria remains far from full inclusion.  
3. Verivafrica (2023) – Blog post quoting 2023 data (74 % “financial inclusion”, 38 % savings A/C).  • Data traceable to EFInA 2023 survey.  • Quality moderate (secondary reporting, but figures line up with EFInA primary).  
4. Thisdaylive (Aug 2025) – Same BVN series as NIBSS plus policy commentary on NRBVN.  • Factual: 63.5 m (Dec 2024) → 66.2 m (Jul 2025).  • Opinion: CBN optimism on diaspora remittances.  
5. Punch (May 2025) – 64 % overall inclusion in 2023 (EFInA) + historical context.  • Factual element: 64 % formal+informal inclusion.  
6. Cambridge journal article (2024) – Peer-reviewed analysis of gender gap; reproduces EFInA 2020 (51 % banked) and 2020 overall exclusion (40 %).  • High source quality.  
7. Agent report – Collates EFInA & CBN numbers: 39.7 % banked 2018 → 51 % (restated) 2020 → 52 % 2023.  Explicitly documents gaps and methods.  • Strongest single synthesis; relies on primary surveys.

Common factual core across all sources:  
• Bank-account ownership crept from c.40 % (2018) to low-50s % (2023).  
• Latest hard administrative figure (BVN) implies roughly the same (≈53 % of 124 m adults).  
• No source gives a value even remotely close to 95 % before 1 Jan 2025.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Nigeria’s own bank-account trajectory 2011-2023 (29 % → 52 % = +23 pp in 12 yrs).  
2. Fastest historical surges in comparable large emerging economies (e.g., India: 35 % → 80 % in 7 yrs after Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana).  
3. Average speed of inclusion gains in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): ≈ +3 pp/yr (FINDEX).  

Suitability: Class 1 (Nigeria’s trend) is most germane; Class 2 offers an optimistic frontier; Class 3 gives a regional baseline.  

C. Time-frame analysis  
Target date: 1 Jan 2025, already 13 months in the past.  Last pre-deadline datapoint: EFInA survey fielded Sep–Nov 2023.  Administrative BVN count for Dec 2024 also available.  Historical pattern: max annual gain ever recorded for Nigeria ≈ +6 pp (2018-2020 after restatement).  Reaching 95 % from 52 % would have required an unprecedented +43 pp in ≤14 months—7× the fastest rate Nigeria has ever achieved and far above any documented SSA case.

D. Justification for outside-view probability  
• Starting level (≈52 %) and time remaining (≤1.2 yrs) make 95 % arithmetically near-impossible absent measurement re-definition.  
• No structural break: 2023–2024 initiatives (agent banking, NRBVN) continued gradual progress (≈+2 m BVN holders per quarter) – far short of the ~70 m additional adults needed.  
• External validation: 2024 FINDEX still lists Nigeria among the world’s eight largest un-banked populations.  
• Even a generous India-style “best-case” trajectory (+45 pp in 7 yrs) cannot compress to +43 pp in one year.  
• Therefore, the base-rate probability that any country at 52 % adult bank-ownership today is already ≥95 % one year earlier is effectively nil; historical frequency <<1 %.  

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 0 %–1 % range based on arithmetics.  
Consider residual uncertainty:  • Possibility of unpublished data redefining “account” to include mobile money? Unlikely—resolution criteria explicitly say “account at a bank or financial institution”, but still leave door ajar for CBN series.  Assign 0.5 pp.  
• Chance of no data by Mar 2026 (would resolve No).  Increases probability of “No”, not “Yes”.  

Add both tails → outside view ≈ 1 % that “Yes” will be the eventual resolution.
