Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   • EFInA 2023 survey (quoted by Punch 18-May-2025) – 64 % of Nigerian adults were financially included; 51-53 % owned a bank account. Method: nationally-representative demand-side survey; EFInA is regarded by the CBN and World Bank as the benchmark for Nigeria. High reliability; strictly factual.  
   • NIBSS BVN series (Guardian & Vanguard 8-Jan-2026) – 67.8 m unique BVN holders as of Dec-2025 (≈55 % of the ≈124 m adult population). Administrative data directly from the national payments switch; high reliability; purely factual.  
   • Verivafrica blogpost (2023) – claims 74 % “overall inclusion” but cites only 38 % with savings accounts. Commercial blog without methodology; credibility low; opinions marketing-oriented.  
   • Ceic/FRED datasets (2007-2016) – deposit accounts per 1 000 adults reached 814 in 2016; metric counts accounts, not persons. Out-of-date and not directly comparable; weak relevance.  
   • Academic paper (Cambridge/Data & Policy 2024) – restates EFInA 2020: 60 % included, 40 % excluded. Peer-reviewed; good quality but historical.  
   • Newspaper features on fintech growth, e-payments, S&P banking outlooks (2025-26) – provide context on rising digital usage but contain no hard statistics on account ownership; mostly expert opinions on profitability. Supplementary, low direct relevance.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)  
   Strong evidence (downward pressure)  
   – EFInA 2018-2023 series: +12 pp in five years, ending around 52 % banked.  
   – NIBSS BVN counts 2021-2025: linear rise of ≈3–4 m adults per year to ~55 %.  
   – CBN & EFInA officials (2021-25) have publicly conceded the 95 % target will be missed.  
   Structural factors: poverty (≈62 % in 2025), patchy ID coverage, persistent gender & rural gaps.  
   Moderate evidence (slight upward pressure)  
   – Explosive growth in mobile-money/e-payment volumes shows demand for digital finance.  
   – Regulatory pushes (BVN/NIN mandate, diaspora NRBVN, agency banking) moderately accelerate onboarding.  
   Weak evidence (negligible)  
   – Verivafrica’s 74 % headline (source unclear).  
   – Hopes that 2024 produced an undocumented quantum leap.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   Resolution date (31-Dec-2024) is already in the past; probability mass is fixed. Halving or doubling the remaining time would not change the forecast materially; with another seven years Nigeria might plausibly reach 80-90 %, but not within the closed window.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view base rate derived earlier: 1 % chance of hitting ≥95 %.  
   Current evidence shows:  
   – Best-available 2023–25 measurements cluster at 52–55 %.  
   – Required single-year jump for 2024 would have had to be >40 pp, more than double the fastest ever recorded (India 2014-17 = 20 pp/yr).  
   – No contemporaneous source, official or independent, claims anything close to that surge.  
   – Administrative data (BVN) and demand-side survey (EFInA) are independent and concordant.  

   These factors collectively reinforce the outside view; if anything they argue for lowering it below 1 %. I retain a tiny residual (0.5 %) for extreme measurement error or undisclosed data revisions.

Probability calibration
My inside-view estimate: there is about a 0.5 % chance (1 in 200) that 95 % + of Nigerian adults had a bank or similar account before 1 Jan 2025.

Checklist:
1. Restated question: Did ≥95 % of Nigerians aged 18 + own a bank/financial-institution account at any time before 1-Jan-2025?  
2. Base rate used: 1 %. Final forecast still anchored to it.  
3. Consistency: “0.5 times out of 100, the 95 % threshold was met.”  
4. Key evidence: (a) EFInA 2023 ≈52 % banked; (b) NIBSS BVN Dec-2025 ≈55 %; (c) linear growth trend +3 pp/yr; (d) public CBN admission of target shortfall.  
5. Blind-spot: undiscovered 2024 census or CBN dataset using a radically broader definition of “account” that spikes inclusion numbers. Would raise Yes odds.  
6. Status quo: All authoritative data clusters far below 95 %. The prudent nudge is toward “No”.

Probability: 0.5%
