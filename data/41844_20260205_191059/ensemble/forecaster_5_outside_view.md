Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. NIBSS press note (Aug 2025) – Reports 66.2 million BVN-linked bank-account holders. BVN is compulsory for each unique retail customer, so the figure (issued by the national payments switch) is administratively strong, though a small number of dormant or duplicate IDs remain. No percentage of the adult population is given; with an estimated 120 million adults in 2025 this works out to roughly 55 %.  Factual content = BVN count; no material opinions.  

2. Guardian Nigeria (Jul 2025) – A global review of financial inclusion trends. Mentions Nigeria only as one of eight countries with large unbanked populations; provides no hard Nigerian numbers. Mostly journalistic commentary; low utility for the forecast.  

3. Verivafrica blog (2023) – Claims Nigeria’s overall inclusion hit 74 % but gives only 38 % for savings accounts. Source citations are incomplete; the platform is a marketing site for a KYC vendor. Medium-low credibility.  

4. Thisdaylive article (Aug 2025) – Echoes the NIBSS BVN series (51.9 m in 2021 → 66.2 m Jul 2025) and quotes the CBN governor. Same administrative data as (1), plus policy opinions from the CBN. Factual BVN trajectory is reliable; governor’s optimism is an informed opinion.  

5. Punch (May 2025) – Cites Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) surveys: overall inclusion 56 % (2020) → 64 % (2023). EFInA is the gold-standard demand-side survey in Nigeria; high credibility for the statistics, moderate for the newspaper framing.  

6. Cambridge/Data & Policy paper (2024) – Peer-reviewed study on women’s inclusion. Re-states EFInA 2020 figures (40 % excluded, i.e. 60 % included). Highly credible for historical data; opinions confined to gender-gap analysis.  

7. Agent report – Collates EFInA headline numbers: 39.7 % banked in 2018, 51 % (restated) in 2020, 52 % in 2023; also summarises CBN statements that the 95 % goal is off-track. Sources are traceable to EFInA datasets and official releases; high factual quality.  

Across all sources the only hard, repeatedly corroborated statistic on “adults with a bank account” is the EFInA series (≈40 % in 2018, ≈52 % in 2023). Administrative BVN counts give a comparable 55 % in mid-2025. No source reports anything close to 95 %.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Possible classes:  
1. Nigeria’s own historical trajectory (2011–23).  
2. Other large lower-middle-income countries that attempted rapid inclusion drives (India 2011–17, Kenya 2006–14, Pakistan 2011–23).  
3. Global median change between consecutive World Bank Findex waves (≈6 percentage-points per 3 years).  

Suitability:  
– Class 1 captures country-specific frictions (infrastructure, trust, ID coverage) and is therefore most relevant.  
– Class 2 shows the upper bound of what’s possible under aggressive state programmes (India’s Jan Dhan added ≈45 ppts in six years).  
– Class 3 offers a “business-as-usual” baseline.  

We adopt a hybrid: Nigeria’s recent trend (≈+2 ppts per year) as baseline, adjusted upwards by examining the handful of extraordinary cases in Class 2 to gauge tail possibilities.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Target date: 31 Dec 2024. From the 2017 baseline (29.7 % World Bank) to the deadline is seven years. All data now in hand are for 2025 or earlier, so the full period has elapsed; no additional time remains for improvement.  

Historical pattern: 2011→2017 +10 ppts; 2018→2023 +12 ppts; overall 2011→2023 roughly +23 ppts. The required jump to 95 % would have been +55–65 ppts over 2017–24—three times the observed speed and well beyond the fastest known large-country case (India ≈+45 ppts in six years).

(d) Justification  

• Latest hard measures show 52–55 % of adults banked by 2023–25, leaving a ≥40-point gap to the 95 % threshold.  
• Administrative BVN growth averaged 3–4 million adults per year between 2021 and 2025; at that rate Nigeria would need another 10–12 years to reach 95 %, absent an India-scale mobilisation.  
• There is no evidence of a sudden step change in 2024. Both EFInA and NIBSS figures continue a slow, linear rise.  
• Even if every “formally but non-bank” included adult (mobile-money only, about 12 % of adults) opened a bank account in 2024, the total would still be near 65–68 %.  
• Credible official voices (CBN deputy governor, EFInA briefings) publicly conceded as early as 2021 that the 95 % goal would be missed.  

Given these facts, the only plausible route to a Yes outcome would be:  
1. All existing data are wrong by ≈40 percentage points, or  
2. A statistically invisible miracle occurred in calendar year 2024 and has yet to be documented.  

Both propositions are extremely unlikely.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: The most recent, high-quality estimate of the share of Nigerian adults with a bank account is 52 % (±2 ppts sampling error) for 2023.  

Gap to target: 43 percentage points.  

Historical maximum country-level catch-up in a single year in any World Bank Findex series is ≈20 ppts (India 2014–17). Nigeria would have had to exceed that single-year record by more than double in 2024 alone. Assigning a generous 5 % prior to “country achieves record-shattering inclusion surge”, multiply by a 10 % chance that such a surge specifically reaches ≥95 % (rather than, say, 80–90 %), yields 0.5 %.  

Add a 0.2 % allowance for catastrophic measurement error or data-suppression scenarios. Sum ≈0.7 %. Round to reflect order-of-magnitude uncertainty: 1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability that 95 % or more of Nigerians had a bank account before 1 January 2025: 1 %.
