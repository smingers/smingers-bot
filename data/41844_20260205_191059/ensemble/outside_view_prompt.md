You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will 95% or more of Nigerians have a bank account before 2025?

Question background:
An important concept in economic development is [Financial Inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_inclusion): the degree which a population has access to affordable, convenient, and reliable banking and financial services.   One basic measure of financial inclusion is the percent of a population with a bank account.  According to the [World Bank](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/account-at-financial-institution?tab=chart&country=~NGA), 39.7% of Nigerians had a bank account in 2017, an increase from 29.7% in 2011. 


[Motta, V. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-018-0082-9) found a positive relationship between access to external finance and labor productivity of small/medium businesses.

In July 2019 Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, [set a goal](https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2019/ccd/q2%202019%20financial%20inclusion%20newsletter_final_08.08.19.pdf) to reach 95% of the population with a bank account by 2024.

`{"format":"metac_closes_in_period","info":{"post_id":10220,"question_id":10220}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will be resolve as "Yes" if 95% or more of Nigerians aged 18 or older have an account at a bank or financial institution before January 1, 2025.  This question will resolve according to data from the [Central Bank of Nigeria](https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2019/ccd/q2%202019%20financial%20inclusion%20newsletter_final_08.08.19.pdf); if no such data is available, or said data is known to be inaccurate, data from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/fx.own.totl.zs?locations=NG) may be considered, or from credible independent researchers.

If the data shows less than 95% of the population with a bank account through 2024, or If no such data is available by March 1, 2026, this question will resolve negatively

## Summary of Article

**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete, showing only a navigation/menu page from NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System) rather than a full article. The content consists primarily of headlines and brief snippets without complete article text.

### Key Information Extracted:

**Relevant Statistic:**
- **BVN-linked bank account holders: 66.2 million** (as stated by NIBSS)
- No specific date is given for this figure within the extracted content, though the source date is listed as August 04, 2025

**Source Information:**
- Source: NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System)
- Author: Saka Olalekan
- Date: August 04, 2025

### Context:
The article mentions other developments including:
- 120% rise in instant payment transactions over 2 years (according to CBN)
- Introduction of offline payment solutions by NIBSS
- Tax reform implementation discussions

**Note:** The 66.2 million figure for BVN-linked bank account holders would need to be compared against Nigeria's adult population (18+) to determine the percentage of financial inclusion. Without additional context from the full article or Nigeria's current adult population figures, it's difficult to assess whether this represents progress toward the 95% target by 2024/2025.

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Global Financial Inclusion:
- **1.3 billion adults worldwide** still lack financial accounts and cannot benefit from the formal financial system
- Global account ownership among adults: **~79% in 2024** (up from 50% in 2011, 74% in 2021)
- Percentage without accounts: 21% in 2024 (down from 26% in 2021 and nearly 50% in 2011)
- **53% of unbanked adults (650+ million)** live in just 8 countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, **Nigeria**, and Pakistan

### Savings and Mobile Money:
- **40% of adults in developing countries** now save money using formal financial accounts (banks, mobile money, fintech platforms) - a 16-percentage-point increase from 2021, representing the fastest growth in over a decade
- In Sub-Saharan Africa, formal savings jumped 12 percentage points to **35%**, driven largely by mobile money adoption
- **10% of adults in developing economies** save using mobile money (up from 5% in 2021)

### Gender Gap:
- Women's financial account ownership in low- and middle-income countries nearly doubled from 37% in 2011 to **73% in 2024**

### Digital Security Concerns:
- Among 4 billion adults in developing countries who own mobile phones, only **half use a password** to protect their devices

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Ajay Banga, World Bank President:** "Digital finance can convert this potential into reality. The Bank is helping countries expand digital IDs, modernise payment systems, and streamline regulations to keep the momentum going."

- **Bill Gates, Chair of the Gates Foundation:** "More people than ever have the financial tools to invest in their futures. This is real progress. But there's still work to be done to make systems safer and more inclusive."

## Relevance to the Question:

The article notes Nigeria is among the 8 countries with the largest unbanked populations globally, but does not provide specific data on Nigeria's current financial inclusion rate or whether it has reached the 95% target by 2024/2025.

# Summary of Article: "How Many Nigerians Have Access to Financial Services?"

**Source:** Verivafrica

## Key Statistics for Nigeria in 2023:

1. **Overall Financial Inclusion Rate:** 74% (described as an "impressive" surge in 2023)

2. **Electronic Payments/Transaction Accounts:** 52% of the adult population holds a transaction account with a regulated financial institution and/or has conducted electronic payments through such an institution in the last year

3. **Bank Account/Savings Access:** 38% of Nigeria's adult population holds a savings account with a regulated financial institution or has engaged in savings activities through such an institution in the last 12 months

4. **Credit Access:** Only 6% of the adult population utilized credit products from regulated financial institutions in 2023

5. **Insurance Coverage:** Only 3% of the adult population is covered by regulated insurance policies

6. **Pension Participation:** Only 8% of the adult population actively contributes to or receives a pension through regulated pension schemes

## Context:

- The article notes that the digital revolution has significantly impacted financial transactions, with electronic payments becoming increasingly popular, particularly since the entry of providers like Moniepoint, Opay, and similar financial service providers into the market

- The low credit uptake (6%) suggests eligibility criteria may be too strict and awareness too low

- The article emphasizes the need for increased awareness and accessibility across insurance and pension products

# Article Summary: "Push for financial inclusion gains fresh momentum"

**Source:** Punch Newspapers  
**Date:** May 18, 2025  
**Author:** Felix Oloyede

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Current Financial Inclusion Rates:**
   - Financial inclusion access rose from 56% in 2020 to 64% in 2023, according to Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA)
   - Growth was driven by non-banking channels, particularly fintech

2. **Diaspora Remittances:**
   - In 2024, diaspora remittances to Nigeria reached $20.98 billion (a five-year high), marking a 9% increase from the previous year
   - Personal remittance inflows accounted for $20.93 billion
   - Remittance flows through official channels rose from $3.3 billion in 2023 to $4.73 billion in 2024

3. **New Initiative:**
   - CBN, in collaboration with Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, recently launched the Non-Resident Biometric Verification Number (NRBVN) platform in Abuja
   - Platform aims to provide diaspora Nigerians seamless access to banking services without mandatory physical verification

4. **Historical Context:**
   - In 2008, about 53% of Nigerian adults were excluded from financial services
   - By 2010, the exclusion rate dropped to 46.3%
   - The National Financial Inclusion Strategy was launched on October 23, 2012, with a goal to reduce exclusion to 20% by 2020

## Named Source Opinions:

**CBN Governor Olayemi Cardoso:**
- States that the NRBVN platform provides seamless access to banking services while ensuring convenience and efficient cost management
- Notes that diaspora Nigerians historically faced significant challenges accessing financial services in Nigeria
- CBN is targeting $1 billion in monthly remittance flows, which he believes is achievable
- Remittance costs currently average over 7% in Sub-Saharan Africa; CBN aims to reduce these costs
- References successful models from India (holding approximately $160 billion in diaspora deposits) and Pakistan (Roshan Digital Account attracted nearly $10 billion since inception)

## Relevant Context:

The article focuses primarily on diaspora financial inclusion efforts rather than domestic financial inclusion rates. While it provides updated figures showing 64% financial inclusion as of 2023, this is still significantly below the 95% threshold mentioned in the forecasting question. The article does not mention the 2019 goal of reaching 95% financial inclusion by 2024.

# Summary of Article: AI for Women's Financial Inclusion in Nigeria

## Key Statistics on Financial Inclusion in Nigeria:

### Overall Population Financial Inclusion:
- **2020 (EFInA data)**: Almost 40% of the total population of 106 million (about 42 million people) were financially excluded
- **2008 (EFInA data)**: 53% of 86.6 million (about 45 million people) were financially excluded

### Gender-Specific Financial Inclusion:
- **2021**: 31% of women have a formal account compared with 61% of men (EFInA, 2019)
- **Gender gap**: Nigerian women are 12 percentage points less likely than men to be financially included (WFID, 2022)
- **2020**: 40% of 53.3 million women (about 21.32 million) were excluded
- **2008**: 57% of 41.5 million women (about 23.65 million) were excluded
- **Progress**: This represents only a 9.87% reduction in women's financial exclusion over 12 years (2008-2020)

### Poverty Context:
- 87 million people living in extreme poverty in Nigeria, including 43.7 million women (Sasu, 2022)

## Key Findings from the Research:

1. **Slow Progress**: The research emphasizes there has been "no significant shift in women's financial exclusion rates since 2008"

2. **Gender Gap Severity**: Nigeria's gender gap in financial inclusion is "not only wider than other countries in Africa but also one of the widest in the world"

3. **Projections**: The gender gap will persist without interventions at industry, policy, and regulatory levels

4. **AI-powered Fintech Limitations**: Despite claims of AI-driven innovation, Fintech has not effectively targeted financially excluded women, and the extent of AI utilization is unclear

## Measurement Approaches:
The article notes two different measurement frameworks:
- **World Bank**: Uses account ownership as the sole indicator
- **EFInA**: Uses broader indicators including access to payment mechanisms, savings, insurance, credit, and pensions

**Note**: The article content appears to be cut off mid-sentence, so this summary may not capture all findings and conclusions from the complete article.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide latest CBN or EFInA figures for Nigerian adult bank-account ownership 2017-2024, note any 95 % target assessment, and cite sources.
This report assembles every figure that Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) or Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access (EFInA) has publicly released on the share of Nigerian adults who hold a deposit-money-bank (DMB) account between 2017 and 2024, then compares that series with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) objective that 95 % of adults be financially included by end-2024.

1. Indicator definition   
• EFInA labels adults who “have a deposit money bank or micro-finance bank account in their own name” as the “banked” population.   
• CBN statements sometimes use the broader term “formally served”, but the NFIS monitoring framework still treats the EFInA “banked” variable as the narrowest, most comparable indicator. All numbers cited below therefore relate only to ownership of a DMB or MFB account, not to mobile-money wallets or other regulated products.

2. Year-by-year data points (2017-2024)   

2017 – No Access-to-Finance (A2F) survey round was fielded and neither EFInA nor the CBN has published an interim 2017 measurement. There is therefore no official 2017 figure.

2018 – EFInA’s A2F 2018 survey found that 39.5 million adults—39.7 % of the adult population—had a bank account (a2f.ng “Dataset” page, accessed March 2024).

2019 – No nationwide demand-side survey or CBN progress bulletin quotes a 2019 “banked” percentage, leaving a gap for this year.

2020 – EFInA’s 2020 survey originally reported that “only 45 % of Nigerian adults are banked” (UK Government news release summarising EFInA 2020 results, 6 Dec 2021) but the figure was recalculated to 51 % when EFInA adopted a new population frame and weighting scheme, as shown in the EFInA 2023 Survey launch-day presentation deck (efina.org.ng, March 2024). Both numbers are therefore documented:  
• 45 % – first publication, still cited internationally (GOV.UK release);  
• 51 % – current EFInA “restated” series.

2021 – Neither institution released a dedicated survey or administrative estimate; no verified statistic is available.

2022 – Likewise, 2022 lacks a published demand-side survey and CBN public reports give only aggregate financial-inclusion totals, not the specific “banked” variable; hence no 2022 figure.

2023 – EFInA’s new A2F survey, launched in December 2023, indicates that 52 % of adults “access formal financial services through banks” (EFInA 2023 event-day presentation, efina.org.ng, March 2024). The full 2023 report is now downloadable from a2f.ng; the headline table confirms the 52 % value.

2024 – As at early February 2024 no survey covering 2024 outcomes has been completed; a 2024 figure will only be available after the next A2F round or a CBN progress note.

Table 1. Publicly available ‘banked’ statistics, 2017-2024  

Year | Bank-account ownership (% of adults) | Source  
2017 | – | –  
2018 | 39.7 % | EFInA A2F 2018 dataset (a2f.ng)  
2019 | – | –  
2020 | 45 % (original) | GOV.UK news release on EFInA 2020 data  
    | 51 % (restated) | EFInA 2023 launch deck (efina.org.ng)  
2021 | – | –  
2022 | – | –  
2023 | 52 % | EFInA 2023 event-day slides (efina.org.ng)  
2024 | n.a. | –  

3. Progress versus the 95 % NFIS target  

Target description – The revised National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS 2.0), adopted in 2019, pledges that 95 % of all adults should be financially included—counting both formal and informal channels—by 2024. CBN’s Deputy Governor for Financial System Stability reiterated the 95 % ambition when the 2020 EFInA results were released (GOV.UK news release, 6 Dec 2021).

Latest inclusion picture – EFInA’s 2023 survey puts:  
• Overall financial inclusion (formal + informal) at 74 %  
• Formal inclusion at 64 %  
• Bank-account ownership at 52 %

Gap to target – On the broad NFIS yard-stick the country is 21 percentage points short of the 95 % target; on the stricter “banked” definition the shortfall is 43 points. With the NFIS horizon less than a year away, closing either gap would require an unprecedented acceleration.

4. Trend observations  

• Rapid catch-up then plateau – Bank penetration jumped from 39.7 % (2018) to the restated 51 % (2020) but has inched up only one point to 52 % by 2023.  
• Methodology matters – The upward revision of the 2020 figure from 45 % to 51 % stems from EFInA’s switch to an updated sampling frame; policymakers should therefore quote the 51 % value when benchmarking progress.  
• Non-bank channels are expanding faster – Between 2020 and 2023 formal inclusion rose from 56 % to 64 %, an eight-point gain achieved mainly through mobile-money operators and agent-banking networks, while bank-account ownership rose just one point.  
• Persistent exclusion pockets – According to the EFInA 2020 dataset women lag men by 11 percentage points and Northern-region adults lag Southern peers by more than 20 points (GOV.UK release). These gaps remain material in the 2023 report.

5. CBN statements on target feasibility  

At the 2020 data launch CBN acknowledged that “at our current rate of progress, we will not reach the 2020 [now 2024] financial inclusion targets until around 2030” (GOV.UK release). No subsequent CBN communiqué has upgraded the outlook. The regulator’s own Fintech strategy report issued in February 2026 still notes that 26 % of adults remain excluded (Economic Confidential, 3 Feb 2026), implying that the 95 % objective was missed.

6. Remaining information gaps  

• No official “banked” statistic for 2017, 2019, 2021 or 2022.  
• The micro-data and confidence intervals for the 2023 survey have only just been released; independent analysts have not yet validated the 52 % point estimate.  
• CBN has not published an administrative count of adult bank accounts for cross-checking the demand-side survey results.

7. Suggested next steps if granular tracking is required  

• Search CBN’s website or the Financial Inclusion Secretariat for any “Status Report 2022” that might contain bank-ownership tables.  
• Download the newly posted EFInA 2023 micro-dataset from a2f.ng to examine regional, gender and income breakdowns of bank ownership.  
• Monitor EFInA’s newsroom after December 2024 for the first release of 2024 outcomes.

In summary, the publicly available record shows Nigerian adult bank-account ownership at 39.7 % in 2018, rebased to 51 % in 2020, and essentially flat at 52 % in 2023. These levels leave Nigeria far adrift of the NFIS aspiration that 95 % of adults be financially included by the end of 2024; even if every presently included adult already owned a bank account, roughly 43 million more adults would have to open one within a single year. The large data holes for 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022 hinder a year-on-year trend analysis and underscore the need for more frequent, transparent reporting by both EFInA and the CBN.
