Analysis:
The question hinges on whether adult bank-account ownership in Nigeria reached 95 % before 1 Jan 2025.  To form an outside view we need: (a) the historical trajectory of financial-inclusion figures (World Bank Global Findex 2011, 2014, 2017, 2021); (b) more recent national surveys such as EFInA’s “Access to Financial Services in Nigeria” 2022/2023 and any 2024 updates; (c) statements or datasets released by the Central Bank of Nigeria on progress toward the 95 % goal; (d) news coverage commenting on whether the target was met.  Collecting these numbers and authoritative commentary will reveal whether reported adult account ownership ever approached 95 % and thus inform the forecast.
