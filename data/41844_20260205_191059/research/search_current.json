growth while maintaining profitability, S&P says**\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, Nigerian banks are projected to achieve credit growth of 20-25% in 2026 while maintaining profitability, despite elevated asset quality risks and tighter regulatory requirements. The expansion will be driven by renewed lending to the oil and gas, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. Easing inflation\u2014projected to moderate to around 21% in 2026\u2014and a more accommodative monetary policy from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are expected to support loan growth, even as interest rates remain high relative to regional peers, preserving solid net interest margins. Profitability is forecast to moderate slightly: return on equity (ROE) is expected to decline to 20-23% from 25% in 2025, and return on assets (ROA) to fall to 3.0-3.1% from 3.3%. Earnings will continue to be supported by strong non-interest income, particularly fees and commissions, and lower credit provisions, though margins may be constrained by regulatory costs\u2014such as the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria levy, which can account for up to 20% of operating expenses. Asset quality remains a key concern, with non-performing loans (NPLs) rising to 7% in 2025 following the removal of regulatory forbearance on oil and gas exposures; S&P expects NPLs to stabilize at 6-7% in 2026. Approximately one-third of banking system loans are linked to oil and gas, with about 50% denominated in foreign currency, exposing banks to oil price volatility and exchange rate risks. On capitalisation, S&P notes that nine of the 10 rated commercial banks\u2014representing about 80% of system assets\u2014have met the CBN\u2019s revised capital requirements ahead of the March 2026 deadline, having collectively raised NGN2.3 trillion ($1.68bn) in 2025, strengthening their loss-absorption capacity under Basel II standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 10:21 AM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/nigerian-banks-forecast-strong-credit-growth-while-maintaining-profitability-sandp-says-424312/)\n\n**S&P Forecasts 25% Credit Growth for Nigerian Banks in 2026**\nOnafriq Nigeria Payments Limited, in partnership with the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), is piloting a wallet-based, Naira-denominated, instant cross-border payment platform for individuals, merchants, and traders in Nigeria and Ghana. The platform, approved by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), will be fully operational from December 1, 2026, for a six-month period. It enables instant outbound payments without hard currency conversion, supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by expanding their market reach and reducing trade barriers. Onafriq provides mobile money rails linked to over 1 billion mobile wallets, while PAPSS offers a network of over 160 commercial banks and 400 million bank accounts across 19 African countries. The initiative supports the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) mandate by facilitating tariff-free trade among 54 member states. The partnership aims to bridge siloed banking and mobile money ecosystems, enabling seamless, secure, and scalable cross-border transactions. Mxolisi Msutwana, Managing Director for Anglophone West Africa at Onafriq, emphasized that the collaboration creates 'bi-directional trade corridors' and gives African enterprises the infrastructure to trade confidently in local currencies. Ositadimma Ugwu, Chief Information Officer at PAPSS, stated the goal is to make Africa\u2019s borders 'invisible to payments,' transforming borders from roadblocks into opportunities. The pilot builds on a prior partnership announced earlier in 2026 for payments into Ghana.\nOriginal language: en-GB\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:30 PM\nSource:[Business Post Nigeria](https://businesspost.ng/banking/sp-forecasts-25-credit-growth-for-nigerian-banks-in-2026/)\n\n**Payments are becoming Nigerian banks' growth lever, says S&P**\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, Nigerian banks' profitability is expected to marginally decline in 2026, with average return on equity (ROE) normalising to 20%-23% and return on assets slipping to 3.0%-3.1%. The banking sector is shifting from reliance on foreign exchange windfalls and interest-rate gains toward transaction-driven income, particularly non-interest income (NII) from fees, commissions, and e-payments. In 2024, electronic transaction values surged by 78.33% to \u20a61.07 quadrillion ($779.37 billion), and e-payments income rose 58% to \u20a6674 billion ($490.93 million) among ten of Nigeria's largest banks. In the first nine months of 2025, eight major banks earned \u20a6514.82 billion ($374.99 million) from electronic payments, reinforcing NII as a stable growth driver. High interest margins, supported by the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) unchanged 27% benchmark rate as of November 25, 2025, will continue to underpin profitability, though net interest margins are expected to come under pressure from future rate cuts. Despite this, S&P expects banks to remain resilient, supported by rising NII and a declining cost of risk. However, regulatory costs\u2014especially the AMCON levy at 0.5% of on- and off-balance sheet assets\u2014account for 15%-20% of operating costs, acting as a persistent drag. Non-performing loans rose to 7% in 2025, exceeding the 5% prudential threshold, due to the phased withdrawal of regulatory forbearance post-COVID-19. S&P anticipates that the end of forbearance and higher capital requirements will challenge asset quality and capital buffers, respectively, while rate cuts will pressure margins.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:44 AM\nSource:[TechCabal](https://techcabal.com/2026/02/04/sp-sees-nigerian-banks-staying-profitable-in-2026/)\n\n**Nigeria\u2019s $18.2bn worth of oil deals in 2025 signal reform-driven upstream recovery, says minister**\nNigeria's Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, announced that in 2025, the country signed 28 new field development plans worth $18.2 billion, with an estimated production potential of 1.4 billion barrels of oil. This marked a major upstream investment breakthrough, positioning Nigeria as Africa\u2019s leading destination for oil and gas investment. Of the seven major Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) announced across Africa between 2024 and 2025, four were made in Nigeria. Lokpobiri attributed the recovery to deliberate reforms, including full implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act, which improved fiscal stability, licensing clarity, and contract predictability. The Upstream Petroleum Operations (Cost Efficiency Incentives) Order 2025 introduced tax credits to reduce operating costs. The Project One Million Barrels initiative, launched in October 2024, increased crude oil output to between 1.7 million and 1.83 million barrels per day (bpd), a 20% rise from previous levels, and boosted active rig counts from 14 in 2023 to over 60. Long-delayed asset divestments by international oil companies transferred onshore and shallow-water assets to Nigerian firms, adding approximately 200,000 bpd to national production. However, Lokpobiri acknowledged challenges, including misinterpretations of local content rules that led to the rise of underqualified 'briefcase' contractors. He emphasized the need for stronger support for the proposed African Energy Bank, headquartered in Nigeria, to address Africa\u2019s $120 billion annual hydrocarbon import bill. The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) echoed the need for reforms, calling for streamlined fees, reduced bureaucracy, and improved access to long-term capital. IPPG chairman Adegbite Falade noted that indigenous and independent producers now account for over 50% of national output, driven by improved export pipelines, reduced crude losses, and greater local participation, though high operating costs and limited affordable financing remain constraints. Stakeholders affirmed that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is on a recovery path fueled by policy clarity, regulatory reforms, and renewed investment, stressing that sustained collaboration among government, indigenous firms, and international partners is essential for consolidating growth and expanding domestic energy access.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/nigeria-s-18-2bn-worth-of-oil-deals-in-2025-signal-reform-driven-upstream-recovery-says-minister-424038/)\n\n**Govt securities dominate 11% of banks' assets**\nGovernment securities now account for approximately 11% of Nigerian banks' total assets, according to S&P Global's Nigerian Banking Outlook for 2026, reflecting years of constrained credit extension and a shift toward lower-risk sovereign instruments. This growing exposure increases banks' vulnerability to sovereign-related shocks, though S&P expects this risk to moderate gradually as lending to the real economy improves, fiscal deficits narrow, and macroeconomic conditions stabilise. The report projects Nigeria's real GDP growth to average 3.7% in 2025 and 2026, supported by both oil and non-oil sectors, with inflation expected to ease to around 21% by 2026. Nominal credit growth is forecast at 25%, driven primarily by lending to oil and gas, agriculture, and manufacturing. However, real credit expansion remains modest due to high inflation and structural constraints. Concentration risks persist, with about half of loans denominated in foreign currency and roughly one-third of exposures linked to the oil and gas sector; additionally, half of gross loans are concentrated among the top 20 borrowers. Asset quality deteriorated in 2025, with nonperforming loans rising to 7% from 4.9% in 2024 following the removal of regulatory forbearance on oil and gas exposures. S&P expects nonperforming loan ratios to stabilise between 6% and 7% in 2026, assuming an average oil price of $60 per barrel. Stage two loans are projected to remain elevated at 20%\u201322%. Profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2026, with return on equity normalising to 20%\u201323% (down from 25% in 2025) and return on assets easing to 3.0%\u20133.1%. Profitability will be supported by still-high interest margins, growth in non-interest income from digital payments and agency banking, and slightly lower loan loss provisions. Despite projected interest rate declines, margins remain high relative to peer markets. The report also highlights a sharp rise in government borrowing in 2025, with public-sector credit increasing by N9.19tn (a 695.6% rise) compared to private-sector credit, widening the gap in credit access. Public-sector credit rose from N25.03tn in January to N34.22tn by December 2025, a N5.57tn increase from 2024\u2019s N3.62tn, reflecting heightened fiscal pressures and reliance on local funding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:38 AM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/govt-securities-dominate-11-of-banks-assets/)\n\n**Nigerian fintech grew 70% in 2025 - CBN**\nNigeria's fintech sector grew by 70% in 2025, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), despite global economic challenges. The CBN's report, 'Shaping the Future of Fintech in Nigeria: Innovation, Inclusion, and Integrity', attributes the growth to improved domestic economic stability and a strategic push toward digital transformation. Governor Olayemi Cardoso emphasized that financial innovation has advanced inclusion at scale, noting the strengthened currency and improved economic conditions. However, the report identifies significant challenges: rising compliance costs due to fraud prevention and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, delays in regulatory approvals, poor interoperability in the fintech ecosystem (with half of stakeholders citing fragmented API standards and data protocols), and limitations in digital identity integration and credit history access\u2014cited by 37.5% of respondents as scaling barriers. Infrastructure strain during peak transaction periods was highlighted through a 'Detty December' case study, illustrating system stress from surges in travel, remittances, and salary payments. To sustain growth, the CBN proposed policy measures including a shared real-time fraud intelligence defense model, exploration of regulatory passporting for cross-border African expansion, and the adoption of open banking and tiered KYC frameworks to serve unbanked populations. The report concludes that collaboration between regulators and innovators is key to maintaining Nigeria\u2019s fintech momentum and positioning the country as a model for financial inclusion in Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:24 PM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/nigerian-fintech-grew-70-in-2025-cbn/)\n\n**Government securities account for 11% of banks\u2019 assets in Nigeria \u2013 S&P Global**\nAccording to S&P Global's Nigerian Banking Outlook for 2026, government securities now account for approximately 11% of Nigerian banks\u2019 total assets, driven by constrained credit extension and a preference for lower-risk sovereign instruments. This growing exposure increases banks\u2019 vulnerability to sovereign-related shocks, though S&P expects this risk to moderate gradually as lending to the real economy expands and macroeconomic conditions stabilize. Despite regulatory headwinds, tighter capital requirements, and easing interest rates, Nigerian banks are projected to remain resilient with positive profitability over the medium term. S&P forecasts Nigeria\u2019s real GDP growth to average 3.7% from 2025 to 2026, supported by both oil and non-oil sectors. Inflation is expected to decline to around 21% by 2026, enabling further monetary easing after a 50 basis point rate cut in September 2025. Nominal credit growth is projected at 25%, primarily driven by increased lending to oil and gas, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors, while retail lending is expected to contribute only marginally due to its small portfolio share. Real credit expansion will remain modest due to high inflation and structural constraints. Loan concentration risks persist: about 50% of loans are denominated in foreign currency, roughly one-third are linked to the oil and gas sector, and half of gross loans are concentrated among the top 20 borrowers.

The report analyzed thousands of print and online news articles across the banking, insurance, telecommunications, and e-hailing sectors, covering 29 commercial banks, 13 insurance companies, five e-hailing platforms, and four telecommunications operators. Key factors influencing reputation included operational costs, currency pressures, regulatory scrutiny, labour relations, and service reliability. A Senior Analyst at P+ Measurement Services, Ms. Tumininu Balogun, stated, 'Reputation is no longer a soft outcome of publicity. It is a measurable business asset shaped by corporate behaviour, governance quality, customer experience, and crisis response.' In the e-hailing sector, inDrive Nigeria led with 39% positive reputation share due to reducing driver commission to 0.1% during peak hours in Abuja, while Bolt Nigeria had the highest negative share at 40% linked to driver protests over fare reductions. In banking, Stanbic IBTC led with 26% positive reputation, driven by recognition as KPMG\u2019s top retail bank, while GTCO recorded the highest negative share at 28% due to legal disputes and fraud investigations. In insurance, AXA Mansard led with 36% positive reputation but also had the highest negative exposure at 68% due to a significant pre-tax profit decline. In telecommunications, MTN Nigeria led with 47% positive reputation from infrastructure expansion, but also recorded 44% negative reputation due to service quality issues and a labour boycott. The report concludes that reputation in 2025 is now a strategic business asset shaped by measurable actions, with transparency, operational fairness, financial discipline, digital reliability, and customer focus driving positive trust, while labour unrest, legal disputes, regulatory sanctions, data breaches, and service disruptions rapidly damage reputations.\nOriginal language: en-GB\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[Business Post Nigeria](https://businesspost.ng/brands-products/reputation-economy-how-nigerian-brands-won-and-lost-public-trust-in-2025/)\n\n**'Non-interest banks account for 1.7% of Nigeria's banking system'**\nNon-interest banks account for only 1.7% of Nigeria's banking system, according to Korede Demola-Adeniyi, Executive Director (South) of The Alternative Bank (AltBank), citing 2024 data. Despite over a decade of regulatory support and rising public interest, structural challenges such as low public awareness, limited product innovation, and misconceptions about the sector hinder growth. Demola-Adeniyi emphasized that non-interest banking is not merely 'faith-based' but an ethical financial model rooted in transparency, shared risk, and financial inclusion, designed for all, not just Muslims. Although modest growth was recorded in 2025, the sector remains marginal within Nigeria\u2019s predominantly interest-based financial system. She expressed confidence that increased capital and clearer regulations in 2026 would elevate the role of non-interest banks in national economic transformation. AltBank\u2019s 2026 growth strategy will focus on high-impact sectors: healthcare, education, agriculture, renewable energy, and transportation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 02:19 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/business-services/non-interest-banks-account-for-1-7-of-nigerias-banking-system/)\n\n**BVN enrolments rise 6% to 67.8m in 2025 -- NIBSS**\nThe Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) reported that Bank Verification Number (BVN) enrolments increased by 6.8% year-on-year, reaching 67.8 million as of December 2025, up from 63.5 million in December 2024. This growth, driven by stronger enforcement of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policies and the expansion of diaspora enrolment initiatives, saw over 4.3 million new BVNs issued within the year. The CBN\u2019s April 2024 directive requiring both a BVN and National Identification Number (NIN) for bank account access prompted widespread enrolment to maintain banking access. Additionally, the Non-Resident Bank Verification Number (NRBVN) initiative enabled Nigerians abroad to obtain a BVN remotely, marking a significant step toward integrating the diaspora into Nigeria\u2019s formal financial system. NIBSS data shows consistent annual growth in BVN enrolments\u2014from 51.9 million in 2021 to 67.8 million in 2025\u2014reflecting improved compliance with biometric identity requirements. However, BVN enrolments still fall short of the 320 million active bank accounts recorded as of March 2025, primarily due to multiple accounts linked to single BVNs and incomplete enrolment by some customers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 05:37 AM\nSource:[Vanguard](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2026/01/bvn-enrolments-rise-6-to-67-8m-in-2025-nibss/)\n\n**BVN enrolments hit 67.8m, 325m bank accounts active**\nAs of December 2025, Bank Verification Number (BVN) enrolments in Nigeria reached 67.8 million, according to data released by the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), marking a 4.3 million increase from 63.5 million in 2024 and a 6.8% year-on-year growth. The enrolment figures for the past five years are: 2021 (51.9 million), 2022 (56 million), 2023 (60.1 million), 2024 (63.5 million), and 2025 (67.8 million). This sustained upward trend reflects progress in financial inclusion and is attributed to policy interventions by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Additionally, as of August 2025, 325.6 million active bank accounts were recorded across Nigeria, including savings, current, and corporate accounts, though some individuals hold multiple accounts. The BVN, launched on February 14, 2014, by the CBN and the Bankers' Committee, assigns each customer an 11-digit unique identity linked to biometric data\u2014fingerprints and facial images\u2014to combat identity fraud. The enrolment process involves visiting a bank branch, completing a form, undergoing biometric capture, and receiving the BVN via SMS within 24\u201348 hours. The BVN then links all of a customer\u2019s accounts across Nigerian banks, creating a unified financial identity. Analysts regard the biometric system as a robust defense against identity theft, surpassing traditional password and PIN-based security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 10:03 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/business-services/bvn-enrolments-hit-67-8m-325m-bank-accounts-active/)\n\n**BVN enrolments hit 67.8 million in 2025 buoyed by CBN initiaves**\nBank Verification Number (BVN) enrolments in Nigeria reached 67.8 million by December 2025, according to data from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), up from 63.5 million in 2024\u2014a growth of over 4.3 million registrations. This marks a 6.8% year-on-year increase and reflects sustained expansion over the past five years: 2021 (51.9 million), 2022 (56.0 million), 2023 (60.1 million), 2024 (63.5 million), and 2025 (67.8 million). The growth is attributed to key Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) initiatives, including the April 2024 directive to freeze accounts without a BVN and National Identification Number (NIN), and the expansion of the Non-Resident BVN (NRBVN) programme, which enables Nigerians abroad to register remotely. The BVN system, a biometric identity tool, supports fraud prevention, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, while advancing financial inclusion. Despite the progress, the BVN total remains below the 320 million active bank accounts in Nigeria as of March 2025, indicating multiple accounts per BVN and unregistered segments of the banked population. The BVN is a unique identifier linking all a customer\u2019s accounts across Nigerian banks, serving as a cornerstone of the country\u2019s financial infrastructure. According to Nairametrics, the data underscores regulatory momentum and rising adoption of digital identity tools.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 10:36 AM\nSource:[Nairametrics](https://nairametrics.com/2026/01/08/bvn-enrolments-hit-67-8-million-in-2025-buoyed-by-cbn-initiaves/)\n\n**CBN\u2019s New Cash Policy: A Welcome Liberalisation or a Risky Retreat? - MegaNews**\nOn December 2, 2025, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced a major policy shift, effective January 1, 2026, abolishing cash deposit restrictions and increasing weekly withdrawal limits to N500,000 for individuals and N5 million for corporates\u2014up from previous monthly caps of N5 million and N10 million. Daily ATM limits remain at N100,000 and count toward the total cap; withdrawals exceeding limits incur 3% charges for individuals and 5% for corporates, with revenue split 40% to the CBN and 60% to banks. The policy, authorized by Dr. Rita I. Sike, Director of Financial Policy & Regulation, aims to streamline cash management, reduce costs, enhance security, and curb money laundering in Nigeria\u2019s cash-dependent economy. It follows the controversial 2022\u20132023 cash redesign crisis, which caused severe cash shortages, long bank queues, and damage to the informal sector. Experts such as Dr. Salisu Ahmed and banking analyst David Omale applaud the move as a practical response to real-world conditions, particularly benefiting small businesses and improving liquidity amid inflation and supply-chain disruptions. However, critics including financial strategist Nnenna Okafor argue the limits remain insufficient for cash-reliant micro-businesses, while PoS operators express concerns that easier cash access could hinder digital payment adoption and risk regressing Nigeria\u2019s fintech progress. Security expert Abas Ogendengbe warns of increased theft, fraud, and money laundering risks without stronger transaction tracking and surveillance. The policy also raises concerns about monetary policy credibility, inflationary pressures, and higher cash management costs. While the reform offers relief to the informal sector, reduces transaction friction, and restores public trust, it risks undermining digitalization, increasing crime, and weakening regulatory oversight. The CBN frames the policy as a balanced step toward a cashless economy, but its long-term success depends on pairing increased liquidity with stronger oversight, consistent policy direction, and sustained digital payment incentives. The ultimate outcome\u2014whether this is a welcome liberalization or a risky retreat\u2014will hinge on the CBN\u2019s ability to manage these trade-offs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[meganews.com.ng](https://meganews.com.ng/2025/12/05/cbns-new-cash-policy-a-welcome-liberalisation-or-a-risky-retreat/)\n\n**World Bank Nigeria's Population May Reach 350 Million by 2050 -- World**\nThe World Bank projects Nigeria's population will reach approximately 350 million by 2050, an increase of about 130 million from its current population of over 220 million, making it the sixth most populous country globally. At the 2025 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings, World Bank President Ajay Banga emphasized that job creation must be central to national development and security strategies, noting that by 2050, 85% of the world\u2019s population will reside in developing countries, with Africa accounting for one in every four people. Banga warned that 1.2 billion young people will enter the global workforce within the next 10 to 15 years, competing for only 400 million jobs\u2014just one-third of the needed positions. He highlighted that 'these young people have energy and great ideas,' and with proper investment, they can drive future global growth. The World Bank reported recent achievements: 20 million farmers now have better access to tools and markets, 60 million people gained electricity connections, 70 million received education or job training, and 300 million improved health and nutrition services. The bank has partnered with the Asian Development Bank to launch IFC2030, a strategy to attract private investment. To combat corruption, the World Bank is supporting governments in using data, digital ID systems, and AI to track taxes, property, and financial records. Over the past decade, the bank has assisted 120 governments in fighting corruption and is currently working with 26 others to prevent illicit financial activities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[P.M.

Despite economic reforms introduced by President Bola Tinubu since taking office in 2023\u2014including currency adjustments, tax reforms, and the removal of the fuel subsidy\u2014the report notes that 'gains have yet to substantially improve Nigerians' livelihoods.' Real incomes continue to erode due to rising prices, and businesses face persistent barriers to expansion and job creation. The report, presented by World Bank senior economist Samer Matta in Abuja, projects that poverty will remain at 62% next year before beginning to decline in 2027. The World Bank forecasts modest GDP growth of 4.2% in 2025, rising to 4.4% by 2027, driven by services, while inflation is expected to gradually fall from 20.1% (annual rate in August 2025) to 15.8% by 2027. To translate reform gains into tangible benefits, the report urges the government to reduce food inflation, improve public resource allocation for development, and strengthen the social safety net.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 12:48 PM\nSource:[IOL](https://iol.co.za/business-report/international/2025-10-09-half-of-nigeria-lives-in-poverty-despite-reform-world-bank-says/)\n\n**Nigerians Must Obtain Tax ID To Operate Bank Accounts By 2026 - New Tax Law - Business - Nigeria**\nThe Nigeria Tax Administration Act, 2025, signed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will take effect on 1 January 2026. From that date, no individual or business can open or operate a bank account, run a business, or access financial services without a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The law also requires all government agencies (MDAs) and foreign suppliers to obtain a TIN before entering contracts or doing business in Nigeria. Under Section\u00a08(2), banks, insurers, and stockbrokers will be barred from providing services to anyone without a valid TIN. The reform is described as the most significant change in Nigeria\u2019s financial and tax system in decades, aiming to widen the tax net and reduce reliance on oil. Key metrics cited in the article include Nigeria\u2019s 10\u202f% tax\u2011to\u2011GDP ratio compared with Ghana\u2019s 13\u202f%, Kenya\u2019s 16\u202f%, South Africa\u2019s 27\u202f%+, and the global average of 34\u202f%. Out of over 200\u202fmillion citizens, only 10\u202fmillion are registered taxpayers, while more than 60\u202fmillion Nigerians hold bank accounts. The Act also abolishes the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and replaces it with the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS). Public reactions quoted a civil servant in Abuja saying, 'It's good for accountability, but I fear delays and corruption in the process,' and a Lagos\u2011based tax consultant who welcomed the reform, stating, 'This is long overdue. Without linking tax IDs to financial services, compliance will never improve.' The article notes potential risks such as exclusion of the 38\u202fmillion unbanked adults, bureaucratic delays, corruption, and an awareness gap that could create chaos at tax offices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:42 AM\nSource:[Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/8515506/nigerians-must-obtain-tax-id)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
