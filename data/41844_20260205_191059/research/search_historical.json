The content consists primarily of headlines and brief snippets without complete article text.\n\n### Key Information Extracted:\n\n**Relevant Statistic:**\n- **BVN-linked bank account holders: 66.2 million** (as stated by NIBSS)\n- No specific date is given for this figure within the extracted content, though the source date is listed as August 04, 2025\n\n**Source Information:**\n- Source: NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System)\n- Author: Saka Olalekan\n- Date: August 04, 2025\n\n### Context:\nThe article mentions other developments including:\n- 120% rise in instant payment transactions over 2 years (according to CBN)\n- Introduction of offline payment solutions by NIBSS\n- Tax reform implementation discussions\n\n**Note:** The 66.2 million figure for BVN-linked bank account holders would need to be compared against Nigeria's adult population (18+) to determine the percentage of financial inclusion. Without additional context from the full article or Nigeria's current adult population figures, it's difficult to assess whether this represents progress toward the 95% target by 2024/2025.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://guardian.ng/business-services/mobile-money-leads-nigerias-financial-inclusion-drive/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Mobile money leads Nigeria's financial inclusion drive\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian Nigeria News  \n**Date:** July 17, 2025  \n**Author:** Anthony (article by Adeyemi Adepetun)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Global Financial Inclusion:\n- **1.3 billion adults worldwide** still lack financial accounts and cannot benefit from the formal financial system\n- Global account ownership among adults: **~79% in 2024** (up from 50% in 2011, 74% in 2021)\n- Percentage without accounts: 21% in 2024 (down from 26% in 2021 and nearly 50% in 2011)\n- **53% of unbanked adults (650+ million)** live in just 8 countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, **Nigeria**, and Pakistan\n\n### Savings and Mobile Money:\n- **40% of adults in developing countries** now save money using formal financial accounts (banks, mobile money, fintech platforms) - a 16-percentage-point increase from 2021, representing the fastest growth in over a decade\n- In Sub-Saharan Africa, formal savings jumped 12 percentage points to **35%**, driven largely by mobile money adoption\n- **10% of adults in developing economies** save using mobile money (up from 5% in 2021)\n\n### Gender Gap:\n- Women's financial account ownership in low- and middle-income countries nearly doubled from 37% in 2011 to **73% in 2024**\n\n### Digital Security Concerns:\n- Among 4 billion adults in developing countries who own mobile phones, only **half use a password** to protect their devices\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Ajay Banga, World Bank President:** \"Digital finance can convert this potential into reality.

Indicator definition   \n\u2022 EFInA labels adults who \u201chave a deposit money bank or micro-finance bank account in their own name\u201d as the \u201cbanked\u201d population.   \n\u2022 CBN statements sometimes use the broader term \u201cformally served\u201d, but the NFIS monitoring framework still treats the EFInA \u201cbanked\u201d variable as the narrowest, most comparable indicator. All numbers cited below therefore relate only to ownership of a DMB or MFB account, not to mobile-money wallets or other regulated products.\n\n2. Year-by-year data points (2017-2024)   \n\n2017 \u2013 No Access-to-Finance (A2F) survey round was fielded and neither EFInA nor the CBN has published an interim 2017 measurement. There is therefore no official 2017 figure.\n\n2018 \u2013 EFInA\u2019s A2F 2018 survey found that 39.5 million adults\u201439.7 % of the adult population\u2014had a bank account (a2f.ng \u201cDataset\u201d page, accessed March 2024).\n\n2019 \u2013 No nationwide demand-side survey or CBN progress bulletin quotes a 2019 \u201cbanked\u201d percentage, leaving a gap for this year.\n\n2020 \u2013 EFInA\u2019s 2020 survey originally reported that \u201conly 45 % of Nigerian adults are banked\u201d (UK Government news release summarising EFInA 2020 results, 6 Dec 2021) but the figure was recalculated to 51 % when EFInA adopted a new population frame and weighting scheme, as shown in the EFInA 2023 Survey launch-day presentation deck (efina.org.ng, March 2024). Both numbers are therefore documented:  \n\u2022 45 % \u2013 first publication, still cited internationally (GOV.UK release);  \n\u2022 51 % \u2013 current EFInA \u201crestated\u201d series.\n\n2021 \u2013 Neither institution released a dedicated survey or administrative estimate; no verified statistic is available.\n\n2022 \u2013 Likewise, 2022 lacks a published demand-side survey and CBN public reports give only aggregate financial-inclusion totals, not the specific \u201cbanked\u201d variable; hence no 2022 figure.\n\n2023 \u2013 EFInA\u2019s new A2F survey, launched in December 2023, indicates that 52 % of adults \u201caccess formal financial services through banks\u201d (EFInA 2023 event-day presentation, efina.org.ng, March 2024). The full 2023 report is now downloadable from a2f.ng; the headline table confirms the 52 % value.\n\n2024 \u2013 As at early February 2024 no survey covering 2024 outcomes has been completed; a 2024 figure will only be available after the next A2F round or a CBN progress note.\n\nTable 1. Publicly available \u2018banked\u2019 statistics, 2017-2024  \n\nYear | Bank-account ownership (% of adults) | Source  \n2017 | \u2013 | \u2013  \n2018 | 39.7 % | EFInA A2F 2018 dataset (a2f.ng)  \n2019 | \u2013 | \u2013  \n2020 | 45 % (original) | GOV.UK news release on EFInA 2020 data  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003| 51 % (restated) | EFInA 2023 launch deck (efina.org.ng)  \n2021 | \u2013 | \u2013  \n2022 | \u2013 | \u2013  \n2023 | 52 % | EFInA 2023 event-day slides (efina.org.ng)  \n2024 | n.a. | \u2013  \n\n3. Progress versus the 95 % NFIS target  \n\nTarget description \u2013 The revised National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS 2.0), adopted in 2019, pledges that 95 % of all adults should be financially included\u2014counting both formal and informal channels\u2014by 2024. CBN\u2019s Deputy Governor for Financial System Stability reiterated the 95 % ambition when the 2020 EFInA results were released (GOV.UK news release, 6 Dec 2021).\n\nLatest inclusion picture \u2013 EFInA\u2019s 2023 survey puts:  \n\u2022 Overall financial inclusion (formal + informal) at 74 %  \n\u2022 Formal inclusion at 64 %  \n\u2022 Bank-account ownership at 52 %\n\nGap to target \u2013 On the broad NFIS yard-stick the country is 21 percentage points short of the 95 % target; on the stricter \u201cbanked\u201d definition the shortfall is 43 points. With the NFIS horizon less than a year away, closing either gap would require an unprecedented acceleration.\n\n4. Trend observations  \n\n\u2022 Rapid catch-up then plateau \u2013 Bank penetration jumped from 39.7 % (2018) to the restated 51 % (2020) but has inched up only one point to 52 % by 2023.  \n\u2022 Methodology matters \u2013 The upward revision of the 2020 figure from 45 % to 51 % stems from EFInA\u2019s switch to an updated sampling frame; policymakers should therefore quote the 51 % value when benchmarking progress.  \n\u2022 Non-bank channels are expanding faster \u2013 Between 2020 and 2023 formal inclusion rose from 56 % to 64 %, an eight-point gain achieved mainly through mobile-money operators and agent-banking networks, while bank-account ownership rose just one point.  \n\u2022 Persistent exclusion pockets \u2013 According to the EFInA 2020 dataset women lag men by 11 percentage points and Northern-region adults lag Southern peers by more than 20 points (GOV.UK release). These gaps remain material in the 2023 report.\n\n5. CBN statements on target feasibility  \n\nAt the 2020 data launch CBN acknowledged that \u201cat our current rate of progress, we will not reach the 2020 [now 2024] financial inclusion targets until around 2030\u201d (GOV.UK release). No subsequent CBN communiqu\u00e9 has upgraded the outlook. The regulator\u2019s own Fintech strategy report issued in February 2026 still notes that 26 % of adults remain excluded (Economic Confidential, 3 Feb 2026), implying that the 95 % objective was missed.\n\n6. Remaining information gaps  \n\n\u2022 No official \u201cbanked\u201d statistic for 2017, 2019, 2021 or 2022.  \n\u2022 The micro-data and confidence intervals for the 2023 survey have only just been released; independent analysts have not yet validated the 52 % point estimate.  \n\u2022 CBN has not published an administrative count of adult bank accounts for cross-checking the demand-side survey results.\n\n7. Suggested next steps if granular tracking is required  \n\n\u2022 Search CBN\u2019s website or the Financial Inclusion Secretariat for any \u201cStatus Report 2022\u201d that might contain bank-ownership tables.  \n\u2022 Download the newly posted EFInA 2023 micro-dataset from a2f.ng to examine regional, gender and income breakdowns of bank ownership.  \n\u2022 Monitor EFInA\u2019s newsroom after December 2024 for the first release of 2024 outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the publicly available record shows Nigerian adult bank-account ownership at 39.7 % in 2018, rebased to 51 % in 2020, and essentially flat at 52 % in 2023. These levels leave Nigeria far adrift of the NFIS aspiration that 95 % of adults be financially included by the end of 2024; even if every presently included adult already owned a bank account, roughly 43 million more adults would have to open one within a single year. The large data holes for 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022 hinder a year-on-year trend analysis and underscore the need for more frequent, transparent reporting by both EFInA and the CBN.\n\n(Primary sources: EFInA dataset site a2f.ng, EFInA 2023 event-day presentation efina.org.ng, UK Government press release on EFInA 2020 results, Economic Confidential summary of CBN Fintech report.)</Agent_report>\n"
