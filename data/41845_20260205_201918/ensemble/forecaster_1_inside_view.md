# Forecast Analysis: Global Under-5 Child Deaths for 2024

## Checklist Item #1: Target Variable
**Paraphrase:** Total median under-5 deaths globally in 2024, reported by UNICEF in 2026, measured in millions.

## (a) Source Analysis

### Historical Context Sources (High Quality)

**Gates Foundation Press Release (Dec 2025):**
- **Date:** December 2025 (recent, highly relevant)
- **Quality:** Excellent - major philanthropic organization with direct involvement in global health
- **Key Facts:** 4.6M deaths in 2024 (actual); 4.8M projected for 2025 (200k increase); first projected increase this century
- **Opinion vs. Fact:** The 4.6M figure for 2024 is presented as factual; 2025 projection is clearly labeled as such
- **Critical Finding:** This is the ONLY source providing an actual 2024 figure

**Lancet Global Health Study (Feb 2026):**
- **Date:** February 3-4, 2026 (current)
- **Quality:** Excellent - peer-reviewed medical journal, ISGlobal/IHME analysis
- **Key Facts:** Aid cuts could cause 9.4M deaths by 2030 (moderate scenario) or 22.6M (severe); 2.5M-5.4M under-5 deaths in these scenarios
- **Opinion vs. Fact:** Projections are model-based, clearly labeled as conditional scenarios
- **Relevance:** Provides context on funding crisis but doesn't give 2024 actual data

**UNICEF Reports (Nov 2025):**
- **Date:** November 20, 2025
- **Quality:** Excellent - official UNICEF State of World's Children 2025
- **Key Facts:** 417M children in multidimensional poverty; 4.5M under-5 deaths projected by 2030 due to aid cuts
- **Relevance:** Provides context but no 2024 actual figure

**WHO/UN News Sources:**
- **Quality:** Good - official UN sources
- **Key Facts:** Confirm trends, conflicts, funding cuts
- **Limitation:** No specific 2024 data

### Critical Discovery
The Gates Foundation article states definitively: **"4.6 million children died before their 5th birthday in 2024"**

This is a factual claim about a past event (2024 has already occurred as of Feb 2026). This appears to be based on preliminary estimates available before the official UNICEF 2026 report.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### STRONG Evidence (Large Shift Warranted)

**Gates Foundation 2024 Figure (4.6M):**
- **Weight:** Very Strong
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Gates Foundation has deep involvement in global health data
  - Presented as factual, not projection
  - 2024 has already occurred
  - Consistent with historical decline trend
  - Represents 200k decline from 2023 (4.8M)
- **Direction:** Centers prediction firmly around 4.6M

**Structural Funding Crisis:**
- **Weight:** Strong
- **Reasoning:**
  - Multiple independent sources (Lancet, UNICEF, UN News)
  - USAID dismantled in 2025
  - 26.9% decline in development assistance in 2025
  - Major donors (US, UK, Germany) cutting aid
  - Causal mechanism clear: less funding → fewer interventions → more deaths
- **Direction:** Would push 2024 toward higher end IF it affected 2024, but timing suggests impact mainly post-2024

### MODERATE Evidence

**Historical Deceleration Trend:**
- **Weight:** Moderate
- **Reasoning:**
  - WHO explicitly notes "stalled progress since 2015"
  - Recent declines: 217k (2020), 154k (2021), 52k (2022), 221k (2023)
  - Pattern shows volatility but continued decline
- **Direction:** Supports continued decline in 4.6-4.7M range

**Conflict Escalation (2024):**
- **Weight:** Moderate
- **Reasoning:**
  - Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine conflicts ongoing
  - UNICEF reports record violations in 2024
  - Famine declared in two regions (Sudan, Gaza)
- **Direction:** Would slow decline, but 4.6M figure already incorporates this

### WEAK Evidence

**Climate Change Impacts:**
- **Weight:** Weak for 2024 specifically
- **Reasoning:** Long-term structural factor, gradual impact
- **Direction:** Marginal upward pressure

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Target year: 2024 (already occurred)
- Report release: Expected March 2026 (~1 month away)
- Current date: February 5, 2026

**Key Insight:** We are forecasting a figure for a PAST event (2024), not a future event. The uncertainty is about measurement/reporting, not about what will happen.

**If Timeframe Halved (report in 2 weeks):** No change - 2024 already happened
**If Timeframe Doubled (report in 2 months):** No change - 2024 already happened

The timeframe affects report availability, not the underlying reality.

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

### Checklist Item #2: Base Rate Alignment
**Outside View Base Rate:** 4.68-4.72M (based on historical trends)
**Current Evidence:** Gates Foundation reports 4.6M actual for 2024

### Major Shift Justification

The Gates Foundation's **factual claim of 4.6M deaths in 2024** represents:
1. A 200k decline from 2023 (4.8M) - consistent with the strong 2022-2023 decline of 221k
2. Alignment with pre-COVID decline rates (~200k/year)
3. A return to stronger progress after the 2021-2022 stagnation

**Why this shift is justified:**
- Gates Foundation is a primary actor in global health with access to preliminary data
- The claim is presented as fact, not projection
- The figure aligns logically with historical patterns
- No contradictory evidence exists

**Structural factors in 2024:**
- Aid cuts began accelerating in 2025 (USAID dismantled July 2025), so 2024 was largely pre-crisis
- Major conflicts (Gaza, Sudan) were ongoing but not dramatically different from 2023
- Healthcare systems had largely recovered from COVID-19

### Uncertainty Considerations

**Why not simply anchor at 4.6M exactly?**
1. **Measurement uncertainty:** Preliminary estimates may be revised
2. **Reporting methodology:** UNICEF may use different estimation methods
3. **Data quality:** Some countries have weak vital registration systems
4. **Rounding:** Gates Foundation may have rounded; actual could be 4.55-4.65M

**Distribution shape:**
- Should be relatively narrow given that 2024 has occurred
- Centered tightly around 4.6M
- Slight right-skew possible if conflicts/crises undercounted initially
- Main uncertainty is measurement/reporting, not underlying reality

## Checklist Item #3: Consistency Check
**Implied median:** 4.60M
**Implied mean:** ~4.60M (symmetric distribution)
**Assessment:** Makes sense - aligns with Gates Foundation data and represents strong continued progress consistent with 2022-2023 trend

## Checklist Item #4: Key Evidence

1. **Gates Foundation factual claim:** 4.6M deaths in 2024 (actual, not projection)
2. **Historical trend:** 221k decline in 2023 suggests momentum continued
3. **Timing of aid crisis:** Major cuts began 2025, limited impact on 2024
4. **Measurement uncertainty:** Preliminary estimates subject to revision ±50-100k
5. **Conflict impacts:** Already reflected in 2024 data, not additional factor

## Checklist Item #5: Blind Spot Statement

**Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly:**
UNICEF's official methodology produces significantly different estimate than Gates Foundation's preliminary figure, particularly if:
- Different data sources used
- Revised upward due to conflict-zone undercounting
- Methodological changes in estimation

**Direction:** Would push outcome UP toward 4.7-4.8M range

**Probability assessment:** Low-moderate (20-30% chance). Gates Foundation typically has good data access, but UNICEF is the official source.

## Final Calibration

Given:
- Strong factual anchor at 4.6M from credible source
- 2024 is a past event (measurement uncertainty only)
- Historical volatility in final estimates
- Potential for upward revision due to conflict zones

**Distribution reasoning:**
- **10th percentile (4.52M):** Optimistic scenario where preliminary estimate revised down, stronger progress than initially measured
- **20th-40th (4.56-4.59M):** Below Gates estimate, accounting for possible downward revision
- **50th-60th (4.60-4.62M):** Central range around Gates Foundation figure
- **70th-80th (4.63-4.66M):** Modest upward revision, some undercounting corrected
- **90th percentile (4.68M):** Pessimistic scenario with significant upward revision, but still showing decline from 4.8M

**90/10 range:** 4.52-4.68M (160k spread, ~3.5% of central value)

This represents reasonable uncertainty for measuring a past event where we have one strong preliminary estimate.
