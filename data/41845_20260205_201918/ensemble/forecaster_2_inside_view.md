# Forecast Analysis: Global Under-5 Child Deaths for 2024

## Checklist Item 1: Target Variable
**Paraphrase**: Total median global under-5 deaths in 2024, as reported by UNICEF/UN IGME in March 2026, measured in millions.

## (a) Source Analysis

### Web Articles (Current Context)
1. **Gates Foundation (Dec 2025)**: Reports **4.6 million deaths in 2024** as actual figure, with 2025 projected at 4.8 million (increase). High credibility source; Gates Foundation has direct partnership with IHME and UNICEF. **Critical factual claim**: 4.6 million for 2024.

2. **WHO Data Portal (May 2024)**: Metadata page, no substantive 2024 data. Low relevance.

3. **Our World in Data**: Discusses methodology, no 2024 projections. Background only.

4. **WHO Maternal Mortality Report**: Different topic (maternal vs. child mortality). Not relevant.

### AskNews Articles (Feb 2026)
5. **Lancet Study (Feb 3-4, 2026)**: Multiple sources report study projecting aid cuts could cause 5.4 million under-5 deaths **by 2030** (cumulative), with 2.5 million in moderate scenario. This is about **additional deaths from baseline**, not total deaths. Moderate evidence for slower decline trajectory.

6. **UNICEF Poverty Reports (Nov 20, 2025)**: Warns 4.5 million children could die by 2030 due to aid cuts. Again, **cumulative additional deaths**, not annual totals. Indicates worsening trajectory concerns.

7. **UNICEF Year-End 2025 Reports (Dec 30-31, 2025)**: Reports unprecedented crisis levels, record child rights violations, funding cuts. No specific 2024 death figures. Suggests adverse conditions but not quantified impact.

8. **Pope Francis Prayer Intention (Feb 5, 2026)**: Cites UNICEF stat of "one million under 20 dying annually from treatable causes" - this is broader age range and different metric. Low relevance.

9. **South Sudan/Pakistan/Other Regional Reports**: Localized crises affecting hundreds of thousands, not millions. Weak evidence for global total shifts.

### Critical Finding
**Gates Foundation article explicitly states 4.6 million deaths in 2024**. This is dated December 2025, written retrospectively about 2024, and comes from a highly credible source with direct data access. This appears to be a **leaked or preliminary figure** before official UNICEF March 2026 release.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **Gates Foundation 4.6 million claim**: Single highly credible source with established data partnerships. If accurate, this is the answer. However, question asks for UNICEF's **official report** figure, which may differ slightly from preliminary estimates. Historical revisions typically ±0.1 million.

### Moderate Evidence
- **Aid funding cuts in 2025**: Multiple sources (Lancet, UNICEF, news reports) confirm major donor reductions (US USAID dismantled, UK/Germany cuts). This could slow progress but wouldn't reverse 2024 outcomes (already occurred). Affects 2025+ trajectory more than 2024.
- **Conflict escalations**: Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, DRC mentioned repeatedly. Localized impacts; global effect likely <0.05 million increase.
- **Historical trend momentum**: 2023 saw -0.22 million decline (return to pre-COVID pace). Momentum suggests continued decline absent major shocks.

### Weak Evidence
- **2025 projection of 4.8 million**: Gates Foundation projects 2025 will see first increase this century. This is forward-looking speculation, not 2024 data.
- **Anecdotal crisis reports**: UNICEF's "darkest year" rhetoric is advocacy language, not quantified impact on 2024 deaths.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: We are 1 month before official March 2026 release, forecasting a figure for calendar year 2024 (which ended 13 months ago).

**If timeframe halved** (forecasting from mid-2026): Would have official figure already; no forecast needed.

**If timeframe doubled** (forecasting from mid-2025): Would lack the Gates Foundation December 2025 report; would rely purely on historical trends, yielding wider uncertainty (±0.15 million vs current ±0.10 million).

## (d) Justification for Prediction Adjustment

### Starting Point: Outside View Baseline
- Mean: 4.63 million (based on -0.17 million/year trend from 2017-2023)
- 90% interval: 4.35-5.05 million

### Inside View Adjustments

**Major upward adjustment (+0.07 million to median)**:
The Gates Foundation 4.6 million figure is **too specific and credible to ignore**. While it's preliminary:
- Gates Foundation has direct IHME partnership and data access
- Figure is presented as retrospective fact, not projection
- Timing (Dec 2025) allows for near-complete 2024 data compilation
- Matches pattern: 2023 was 4.8M, 4.6M represents -0.2M decline (consistent with renewed momentum)

**Minor offsetting factors**:
- UNICEF official methodology may differ slightly from Gates/IHME estimates (±0.1M)
- Rounding conventions: "4.6 million" could be 4.55-4.64M before rounding
- Late data revisions possible but typically small

**Structural factors NOT significantly changing 2024**:
- Aid cuts announced in 2025 don't affect 2024 deaths (lag time)
- Conflicts in Gaza/Sudan/Ukraine are localized; global birth cohort ~140M, affected regions <5M births
- COVID-19 recovery continued through 2024 (no new pandemic)

### Final Calibration

**Anchoring on 4.6 million as median** with uncertainty for:
1. Official vs preliminary figure differences (±0.1M)
2. Rounding and methodological variations (±0.05M)
3. Late data incorporation from low-registration countries (±0.05M)

This yields tighter distribution than pure outside view because we have near-contemporaneous credible estimate.

## Checklist Verification

**Item 2: Base rate check**
Outside view: 4.63M mean, 4.35-5.05M 90% interval
Final prediction: 4.60M median, 4.40-4.85M 90% interval
Justification: Gates Foundation preliminary figure is sufficiently credible to narrow uncertainty and shift median slightly upward from trend.

**Item 3: Consistency check**
Implied median = 4.60M; mean ≈ 4.61M (slightly right-skewed for revision risk)
Makes sense: Represents -0.2M decline from 2023 (4.8M), matching historical momentum and Gates data.

**Item 4: Top evidence pieces**
1. Gates Foundation reports 4.6M deaths in 2024 (Dec 2025, high credibility)
2. Historical trend: -0.17M/year average 2017-2023, with 2023 showing -0.22M
3. No major global shocks in 2024 (no new pandemic, wars localized)
4. Aid cuts announced 2025, lag time means minimal 2024 impact
5. UNICEF methodology stable (no announced changes)

**Item 5: Blind-spot scenario**
**Most likely to make forecast silly**: UNICEF official figure differs significantly from Gates preliminary estimate due to late-breaking data from countries with weak vital registration (e.g., Nigeria, DRC, Pakistan revisions). Could push outcome **DOWN** to 4.4-4.5M if better-than-expected progress, or **UP** to 4.7-4.8M if crises undercounted. Probability: ~15-20%.

## Final Prediction

Balancing the credible Gates Foundation 4.6M anchor against methodological uncertainty and the possibility of revisions, I set a relatively tight but not overconfident distribution:

**Percentile 10**: 4.40 million
**Percentile 20**: 4.50 million  
**Percentile 40**: 4.58 million
**Percentile 60**: 4.65 million
**Percentile 80**: 4.75 million
**Percentile 90**: 4.85 million
