### 1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase, <20 words)
UN IGME/UNICEF **median estimate of total global under‑5 deaths in 2024**, in **million deaths**, in the **2026 report**.

---

## (a) Source analysis (what each says + quality/date)

1) **UNICEF / UN IGME historical series (given in prompt, through 2023 = 4.8M)**  
- **What it is:** The key historical trend we must extrapolate; presumably from UNICEF/UN IGME annual releases.  
- **Quality:** High (primary estimator consortium).  
- **Use:** Establishes base rate and recent trend variability (notably slowdown around 2021–2022, faster drop in 2023).

2) **Gates Foundation / Goalkeepers press release (Dec 2025)**  
- **Factual claim:** “**2024 actual deaths: 4.6 million**”; “**2025 projected: 4.8 million**” and warns of reversal amid funding cuts.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high. Gates is reputable, but **not the resolving source** (UN IGME). The 4.6M figure likely reflects **IHME modeling** (or Goalkeepers synthesis) rather than UN IGME’s B3 estimates.  
- **Use:** Strong directional clue that 2024 may be **materially lower than 4.7–4.8M**, but we should discount for cross-model differences.

3) **Lancet Global Health / CIDRAP & other news summaries (Feb 2026) about aid cuts**  
- **Factual content:** Model-based projections of excess deaths by 2030 under aid-cut scenarios; claims about ODA reductions.  
- **Quality:** Medium. The Lancet is strong; news summaries are secondary. But these are **forward-looking** and mostly affect **2025+**, not necessarily 2024 realized mortality.  
- **Use:** Mild upward pressure on medium-term trajectory; weak-to-moderate relevance for 2024 level.

4) **UN News / UNICEF situation reports (South Sudan malnutrition risk; crises; measles alerts)**  
- **Factual content:** Local/regional crises and risks.  
- **Quality:** Medium (credible reporting), but not quantified into global under‑5 totals for 2024.  
- **Use:** Adds tail-risk for worse outcomes, but hard to translate to a global 2024 point estimate; mostly affects uncertainty, not the central estimate.

5) **WHO data portal metadata / OWID child mortality rate page**  
- **Quality:** High for definitions; **low relevance** here (rates/metadata, not 2024 global death totals).

## (b) Evidence analysis with weighting (strong/moderate/weak)

### Strong evidence
- **UN IGME historical pattern through 2023 (4.8M) with observed year-to-year changes**: this is the correct reference class for what UNICEF/UN IGME will publish.  
  *Effect:* anchors baseline near **4.7–4.8M**, with typical annual change on the order of **0.05–0.20M**.

### Moderate evidence
- **Goalkeepers (IHME-linked) stating “2024 actual deaths 4.6M.”**  
  *Effect:* pulls the distribution **downward** meaningfully (suggesting a 2024 level closer to **4.6–4.7M**), but discounted because the resolver is UN IGME, not IHME.

- **Aid cuts / crisis narratives (UNICEF, Lancet modeling) indicating deteriorating conditions**  
  *Effect:* small **upward** pressure and/or **fatter upper tail**, but primarily for **2025+** rather than 2024.

### Weak evidence
- **Individual outbreak/crisis articles without global aggregation (measles, conflict, localized malnutrition)**  
  *Effect:* modestly increases uncertainty; limited movement of the median.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-05.  
- **Report expected:** ~March 2026 (resolution April 1, 2026). So **~1–2 months** until the number is published; the underlying year **2024 is already complete**.
- **If timeframe were halved:** little would change; we are already close to publication—most uncertainty is model/estimation, not future events.  
- **If timeframe were doubled:** still limited change, but slightly more chance of leaks/pre-releases or methodological notes that could narrow uncertainty.

## (d) Justification: adjusting the outside-view baseline

### Outside view baseline (from prompt)
Prior baseline centered around **~4.7M** for 2024, reflecting a post-2020 slower decline from 4.8M (2023).

### Key inside-view adjustment
- The **Goalkeepers/IHME-linked claim** that **2024 under‑5 deaths were 4.6M** is the single most concrete “2024-specific” quantitative datapoint provided.  
- Even allowing for UN IGME vs IHME differences, it is informative enough to **shift my median down** from ~4.70 toward the **mid‑4.6s**.

### Why not shift all the way to 4.6 as the median?
- The question resolves on **UN IGME/UNICEF’s median**, not IHME’s. Cross-institution differences of ~0.05–0.15M in global totals are plausible due to: input data vintages, adjustment methods, and model structure.  
- Also, UN IGME’s recent pattern included a stall (2022) and then a faster drop (2023 in your series). A 2024 value of 4.6 implies another relatively large drop (~0.2M from 4.8), which is plausible but not something I want to treat as “locked.”

### Net result
- **Median (50th-ish)**: moved down by ~0.05–0.10M versus the prior outside view.  
- **Upper tail**: kept somewhat open due to conflict/malnutrition and the possibility that UN IGME prints a number closer to 4.75–4.80.  
- **Lower tail**: also open because if UN IGME aligns more with IHME and/or revises 2023 upward/downward, 2024 could land closer to 4.4–4.5.

## Quick checklist (abbreviated)

1) **Target variable check:** UN IGME/UNICEF **median global under‑5 deaths for 2024**, million deaths.  
2) **Outside view base rate:** prior center ~**4.7M** based on 2013–2023 trend and 2023=4.8M.  
3) **Consistency check:** implied median ≈ **4.64–4.66**; mean slightly higher due to upper-tail risk; consistent with evidence mix.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5 items, <20 words each):**  
   - UN IGME historical totals: 2023 about **4.8M**, long-run decline with variability.  
   - Goalkeepers/IHME: **“2024 actual 4.6M”** (not resolver but highly relevant).  
   - Recent years show slower declines; 2024 could still be a larger drop.  
   - Aid cuts/conflicts raise uncertainty, mostly affecting **2025+**.  
5) **Blind spot scenario:** UN IGME methodological revision (or data revision) pushes 2024 **back near 4.8M** (upward shock to my forecast).
