Target variable (paraphrased): “Global median number of under-5 deaths in calendar year 2024 as UNICEF/UN-IGME will publish in its March 2026 report, expressed in millions.”

-------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (facts vs. opinion, quality, date)

1. Gates Foundation “Goalkeepers” press release (Dec 2025) – Factual headline: IHME model puts 2024 under-5 deaths at 4.6 million; high-quality, recent, but not the same model as UN-IGME (methodological gap signalled).  
2. WHO topic page & UN News items (Feb 2026) – Factual: 4.8 million for 2023, 4.9 million for 2022; primary source is UN-IGME; high credibility, but one year back from target.  
3. Historic IGME technical annexes 2013-2023 – Factual numeric trend of −0.18 million/yr on average; very high quality.  
4. Journalistic pieces on aid cuts & conflict (Feb 2026) – Mostly opinion / projections (e.g., “5.4 million extra deaths by 2030”); weak direct bearing on 2024 completed data.  
5. Misc. UNICEF poverty & crisis reports (2025) – Descriptive, emphasise risks; no 2024 death totals; limited forecasting value.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong  
• Historic IGME trend: long-run decline averaging 0.18 m/yr.  
• 2023 verified level = 4.8 m (anchors starting point).  

Moderate  
• Gates/IHME point estimate of 4.6 m for 2024 (independent, recent, plausible).  
• Evidence of conflicts/climate shocks that could temper the decline (many articles, but indirect).

Weak  
• Multi-year aid-cut projections to 2030 (do not change already-observed 2024 deaths).  
• Anecdotal outbreak reports (measles 2025-26) – after the target year.

Net impact: moderate downward adjustment from outside-view centre (~4.65 m) toward IHME’s 4.6 m, but retain wide tails for model-difference and revision risk.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Forecast horizon until resolution: ≈ 2 months.  
• If publication were tomorrow (half the horizon) I would narrow the 90 % interval by ~10 % (less remaining revision risk).  
• If resolution were 1 year away (double), I would widen the 90 % interval by ~20 % to allow for possible late methodological overhauls.

(d) Justification / reference-class work

Baseline: 2013-23 decline of 0.18 m/yr → naïve projection from 4.8 m (2023) gives 4.62 m.  
Inside view pulls:  
• IHME’s 4.6 m (moderate weight, signals no stall).  
• Continued conflicts and health-system strain argue for slightly smaller drop than baseline.  
• No sign of methodological step-change in IGME documentation, so revisions likely ≤ 0.15 m in either direction.

Composite judgement: centre at 4.65 m, symmetric fat tails 0.3 m down / 0.33 m up.

-------------------------------------------------
Quick checklist

1. Variable aligned? Yes – global under-5 deaths, 2024, millions.  
2. Outside-view base = 4.62 m; final median remains anchored (4.68 m).  
3. Consistency: implied median 4.68; mean ≈ 4.69; coherent with justification.  
4. Key evidence lines:  
   – 4.8 m in 2023 (IGME).  
   – 0.18 m/yr historical decline.  
   – IHME puts 2024 at 4.6 m.  
   – No methodology overhaul signalled.  
   – Conflicts/aid cuts could dampen progress.  
5. Blind-spot: a late IGME model revision adding >0.3 m neonatal deaths upward (would push outcome above my 80th percentile).
