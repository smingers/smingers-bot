Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. UN-IGME/UNICEF/WHO press release, 13 Mar 2024 – Factual, primary source for the official 2022 figure (4.9 million). Methods note confirms no methodological overhaul. High quality; date appropriate.  
2. WHO “Child mortality and causes of death” topic page, last refreshed 2025/2026 – Factual compilation managed by IGME partners; gives 2023 headline of 4.8 million. High quality, though still technically “provisional” because the full annex is not out.  
3. UNICEF media package, 12 Mar 2024 – Mirrors the press release, adds colour quotes. Same numbers, therefore redundant but consistent.  
4. Agent report (5 Feb 2026) – Collates what is publicly visible, flags missing technical annexes. Offers no new numbers but confirms that (a) 4.8 million for 2023 is already circulating and (b) methodology has stayed constant. The report is well-sourced (links to WHO GHO, UN News).  

Opinion content in all four items is limited to “historic low” language or SDG commentary; the values themselves are factual.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
• IGME global under-5 death series 1990-2023 (34 annual observations).  
• Post-Global-Health Initiative period (2010-2023) to capture decelerating decline.  
• Immediate pre-pandemic + pandemic era (2017-2023) reflecting recent slowdown and rebound.  

The last class (2017-2023) is most diagnostic: seven data points; same estimation model; incorporates COVID disruption and recovery. Average annual change −0.17 million; standard deviation ≈0.07 million.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are forecasting the 2024 value 13 months after the latest published point (2023). Historically the estimate for year t+1 is released two years later but the underlying demographic data (vital registration, surveys) are already mostly recorded; model revisions can still shift numbers up/down by ≈0.1 million.

(d) Justification for the outside-view baseline  
• Monotonic decline has held for three decades; no single-year increase since 1990.  
• The 2023 provisional drop (−0.1 million) returned to the long-run mean after the tiny −0.05 million dip in 2022, suggesting the secular trend is intact.  
• No methodological change announced for the 2024 estimation cycle, reducing the risk of a structural jump.  
• Major shocks that could lift deaths (large new pandemic, world war) did not occur in 2024. Local conflicts (Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine) add some risk but are too geographically limited to reverse the global total; they could slow the decline by ~0.05 million.  
• Therefore the best‐guess is another decline of 0.1 – 0.15 million from the 2023 figure of 4.8 million, i.e. a median near 4.7 million.  
• Upside risk (higher deaths) comes from model revisions or unexpectedly poor neonatal progress; downside risk (faster fall) from continued gains in South Asia or expanded vaccine roll-outs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Outside view calibration:

• Prior distribution: normal with mean change −0.17 million, SD 0.07 million, centred on 4.8 million → mean 4.63 million, SD 0.07 million.  
• Add model-revision noise ±0.1 million (uniform) → overall SD ≈0.12 million.  
• Impose a hard floor near 4.3 million (would require record 0.5 million drop) and soft ceiling near 5.1 million (flat year).  
The resulting 90 % interval is roughly 4.35 – 5.05 million. Interpolating yields:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 4.35 million  
Percentile 20: 4.50 million  
Percentile 40: 4.65 million  
Percentile 60: 4.80 million  
Percentile 80: 4.90 million  
Percentile 90: 5.05 million
