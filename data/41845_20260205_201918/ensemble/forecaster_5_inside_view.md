FORECASTING CHECKLIST  
1. Target variable: Global median under-5 deaths in 2024 (millions) as reported by UNICEF/UN-IGME in March 2026.  
2. Outside-view base rate (straight-line from 2013-23): 4.70 million (≈2 % annual decline).  
3. Consistency check: implied median = 4.65 m; mean ≈ 4.66 m (slightly right-tailed); matches rationale of modest, uncertain decline.  
4. Key evidence (most weight at top):  
    a) Gates Goalkeepers 2025 lists 4.6 m deaths in 2024 (IHME estimate).  
    b) Ten-year trend: mean fall 0.19 m/yr, SD 0.07 m; no year > 0.25 m increase.  
    c) 2023-24 saw major conflicts/aid cuts that could slow progress.  
    d) Immunisation rebound, malaria vaccine roll-out offset some headwinds.  
    e) Revision risk from UN-IGME model changes (~±0.10 m historically).  
5. Blind-spot: Large upward model revision in neonatal mortality for 2022-24 cohort would push total above 5 m.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) SOURCE ANALYSIS  
1. Gates Foundation Goalkeepers report (Dec 2025).  Gives 2024 total = 4.6 m (IHME).  High-quality modelling but not the resolving agency → moderate credibility.  
2. WHO/UN-IGME data portal (May 2024 update).  Confirms 2023 figure 4.8 m.  Authoritative, factual.  
3. Academic/Lancet studies on aid cuts (Feb 2026).  Projective, highlight downside risks; useful for direction, not magnitude for 2024.  
4. UNICEF, UN News, PAHO alerts (2025-26).  Qualitative evidence of worsening humanitarian context; weak-to-moderate for 2024 number.  

B) EVIDENCE WEIGHTING  
• Strong: 25-year historic downward trend; UN-IGME methodology consistency.  
• Moderate: IHME point estimate 4.6 m; documented stalling in 2022 followed by normal-sized 2023 drop; immunisation recovery; El Niño food insecurity.  
• Weak: Forward-looking aid-cut projections to 2030; media reports on single-country crises.

C) TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS  
Time to resolution ≈ 8 weeks.  Unlikely that new 2024 data emerge before release; forecast variance dominated by UN-IGME model adjustments.  If horizon were doubled (16 weeks), variance unchanged; if halved (4 weeks), marginally lower uncertainty as leak/press-preview possible.

D) JUSTIFICATION / INSIDE-VIEW ADJUSTMENTS  
Start at base-rate 4.70 m.  
• IHME 4.6 m pulls median −0.05 m (half-weight because agency differs).  
• 2024 headwinds (conflict, aid cuts, climate shocks) add +0.02 m relative to glide-path.  
• Net median 4.65 m.  
Variance: Historic σ 0.07 m; add 0.10 m for model/revision risk → σeff ≈ 0.13 m.  Inflate 20 % for fat tails.
