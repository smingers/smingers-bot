You are currently analyzing a numeric forecasting question to generate a final, inside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the total median number of global under-5 child deaths reported in UNICEF's 2026 report for 2024?

Question background:
The total number of under-5 child deaths is a critical indicator of global health progress and child wellbeing worldwide. UNICEF, along with the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), releases these figures in their [annual reports on child mortality](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality).

According to their data, the median total number of under-5 deaths globally has been steadily declining:

* 2013: 6.6 million
* 2014: 6.4 million
* 2015: 6.2 million
* 2016: 6 million
* 2017: 5.9 million
* 2018: 5.6 million
* 2019: 5.4 million
* 2020: 5.2 million
* 2021: 5 million
* 2022: 5 million
* 2023: 4.8 million

Before 2020, there was usually a yearly decrease of \~200,000 deaths per year. Then it was:

* 2020 - 217,000 decrease from 2019
* 2021 - 154,000 decrease from 2020
* 2022 - 52,000 decrease from 2021
* 2023 - 221,000 decrease from 2022

`{"format":"metac_closes_in_period","info":{"post_id":36430,"question_id":35831}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the median number of under-5 deaths worldwide for the year 2024 as reported by UNICEF/UN IGME, expected to be released in March 2026. These will likely be published on the UN IGME website ([https://childmortality.org](https://childmortality.org/)) or on UNICEF's website ([https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/)).

If the reporting methodology changes substantially between now and 2026, this question will resolve according to the official figure provided by UNICEF/UN IGME for 2024 under whatever methodology they are using at that time.

In the event that no report is published by May 31, 2026, or if the report does not include a specific figure for global under-5 deaths in 2024, this question should resolve as ambiguous.

# Summary of Article: "Global child deaths reach historic low in 2022 – UN report"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- **2022 Under-5 Deaths:** 4.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2022 (equivalent to 1 death every 6 seconds)
- **Global Trend:** The global under-5 mortality rate has declined by 51% since 2000
- **Additional Deaths:** Beyond the 4.9 million under-5 deaths (nearly half of which were newborns), another 2.1 million children and youth aged 5-24 died in 2022
- **Geographic Concentration:** Most deaths were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia
- **Country Examples:** Cambodia, Malawi, Mongolia, and Rwanda reduced under-5 mortality by over 75% since 2000

**Main Causes of Death:**
- Preterm birth
- Complications around the time of birth
- Pneumonia
- Diarrhoea
- Malaria

**Projections and Challenges:**

- **SDG Target Shortfall:** At current rates, 59 countries will miss the SDG under-5 mortality target, and 64 countries will fall short of the newborn mortality goal
- **Projected Deaths by 2030:** An estimated 35 million children will die before reaching their fifth birthday by 2030, largely in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia or in low- and lower-middle-income countries

**Risk Factors:**
- Children in poorest households are twice as likely to die before age 5 compared to wealthiest households
- Children in fragile or conflict-affected settings are almost three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday

**Threats to Progress:**
- Increasing inequity and economic instability

Query: Retrieve latest UN IGME provisional 2024 under-five death estimates and methodological notes; list any 2025 draft presentations or country vital-registration updates
The evidence that is publicly retrievable as of 5 February 2026 still shows a clear divide between (a) the limited “provisional 2024” material that IGME placed in the public domain in March 2024 and (b) a newer—but likewise partial—round of 2025-dated outputs that quote reference-year 2023 numbers but are not yet accompanied by full annexes or slide decks.

1.  Latest IGME under-five death estimates released under the 2024 cycle  
   • A joint WHO/UNICEF/World Bank/UN DESA press package dated 13 March 2024 announced that 4.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in calendar-year 2022; the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) was given as 37 per 1 000 live births and neonatal deaths as 2.3 million (WHO news release, 13 Mar 2024 – same figures carried forward on the WHO Global Health Observatory indicator feed refreshed 16 May 2024) (datadot.who.int, updated 16 May 2024).  
   • No PDF labelled “Technical Annex 2024” or “Levels & Trends 2024” appears on childmortality.org; repeated direct-URL checks and Google searches return only the 2023-dated package.  
   • Therefore the headline 4.9 million (2022) remains the latest figure that can be cited from an officially branded “2024 provisional” release.

2.  Methodological information that accompanies the 2024 provisional figures  
   • The March 2024 press kit included a one-page “Methods note”. It confirms continued use of:  
     – the Bayesian B-spline Bias-adjusted (B3) model for U5MR estimation,  
     – the multilevel NMR-to-U5MR regression to derive neonatal mortality, and  
     – the Log-Quad life-table relationship to infer infant mortality.  
   • The note contains no indication of new model architecture, software versions, data-quality thresholds or pandemic-era data-gap handling. In the absence of a 2024 technical annex, users must assume that the detailed pipeline documented in Alkema & New 2014, Alexander & Alkema 2018 and Guillot et al. 2022 is still in force.

3.  Evidence that the 2025 estimation cycle has begun—but only partial outputs are visible  
   • Both UN News (25 Mar 2025) and an IPS/GlobalIssues story (28 Mar 2025) report on two IGME co-authored releases that quote a lower headline of 4.8 million under-five deaths in 2023 and 1.9 million stillbirths (UN News, 25 Mar 2025; GlobalIssues, 28 Mar 2025).  
   • The WHO Global Health Observatory “Child mortality and causes of death” topic page has already been refreshed with the same 4.8 million (2023) total and a global U5MR of 37 for 2023 (who.int/gho page, accessed 5 Feb 2026).  
   • Our World in Data hosts an archived dataset stamped “UN IGME 2025” containing time-series estimates through 2023 (archive date 19 Jan 2026) (ourworldindata.org dataset). This confirms that machine-readable tables exist somewhere in the IGME pipeline, even though the customary IGME PDF/XLS annex has not yet been posted.  
   • Despite the appearance of 2025-round numbers, no draft consultation slide deck, white paper or presentation is publicly accessible. Several targeted searches (example: “IGME 2025 consultation presentation”) surfaced only unrelated material (ACGME conference call for abstracts) and therefore do not represent IGME content.

4.  Country-level vital-registration (VR) updates  
   • Neither the 2024 cycle nor the nascent 2025 cycle has produced a public bulletin listing new countries that crossed the ≥ 90 % completeness threshold or that had VR data newly incorporated.  
   • The 2023 technical annex remains the last official source for VR status.  
   • National statistical offices continue to publish their own improvements (e.g., Brazil’s IBGE and England’s NCMD, noted in earlier rounds), but IGME has not yet released documentation showing how or whether these data have been integrated.  
   • Consequently, users must continue referencing the VR classification matrix contained in the 2023 annex.

5.  Summary of what is concretely available today  
   • Provisional 2024 cycle (reference year 2022):  
     – Under-five deaths: 4.9 million; U5MR = 37; neonatal deaths = 2.3 million.  
     – Methodology: one-page 2024 “Methods note”; no detailed annex.  
     – Country and regional tables: none publicly posted; only individual indicator values retrievable via the WHO API.  
   • Early 2025 cycle indications (reference year 2023):  
     – Under-five deaths: 4.8 million (UN News, WHO GHO, GlobalIssues).  
     – Stillbirths: 1.9 million (UN News).  
     – Machine-readable tables evidently exist (OWID dataset) but are not yet hosted on childmortality.org.  
     – No methodological addendum or presentation slides have been released.

6.  Remaining information gaps relative to the original query  
   a. A full “Technical Annex 2024” (PDF + XLS) covering 1990–2023 country-year estimates, input-data inventory and VR re-classification list.  
   b. Any 2024-cycle methodological elaboration beyond the one-page brief (e.g., spline-knot settings, new survey-bias priors, COVID-era survey-gap adjustments).  
   c. Public-domain drafts or slide decks for the 2025 consultation round that would explain the transition from 4.9 million (2022) to 4.8 million (2023) and describe any model updates.  
   d. An explicit IGME note on new VR streams (Brazil, England & Wales, others) and how they affect the B3 input hierarchy.

7.  Practical implications for researchers and programme planners  
   • For now, citing 4.9 million (2022) as the latest “provisional 2024” figure remains technically correct because it is the only number accompanied by a labelled IGME methods page.  
   • If users wish to quote the newer 4.8 million (2023) total, they should footnote that the figure is drawn from press-oriented materials (UN News 2025, WHO GHO 2026) and that a full IGME annex is still pending.  
   • Any country-specific work should continue to reference the 2023 annex until IGME releases the 2024 tables.  
   • Modellers who need reproducible code must rely on the B3/NMR-regression specifications in the 2023 technical annex, given the lack of documented changes for 2024/2025.

Because the critical technical annexes and VR updates are still missing, additional targeted searches may be worthwhile once IGME approaches its usual late-year publication window. At present, however, no further publicly available documentation appears to exist.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
