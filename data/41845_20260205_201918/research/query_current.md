Analysis:
The 2026 UN IGME/UNICEF report will publish the official 2024 global under-5 death total.  The historical series shows a long-run decline of roughly 3 %–4 % per year (~200 k absolute) that recently slowed, then re-accelerated in 2023.  To refine a forecast we need:

• Any preliminary 2024 estimates or model updates released by UN IGME, WHO, the World Bank or IHME during 2025-2026 (press releases, technical notes, draft spreadsheets, conference presentations).  
• News about methodological revisions (e.g., new household survey rounds, excess-mortality adjustments, COVID-19 back-casting changes, real-time vital-registration feeds).  
• Coverage of demographic and health shocks in 2024 (malaria vaccine roll-outs, measles outbreaks, conflicts in Gaza/Sudan/Ukraine, climatic disasters, macro-economic downturns) that could materially raise or lower child mortality.  
• Discussion of data-quality improvements or lags that might shift the median estimate from previous vintages.  

Locating these items requires web search for reports, UN press briefings, academic pre-prints, and targeted news coverage from late 2024 through early 2026.
