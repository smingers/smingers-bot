Analysis:
The long-run decline in global under-5 mortality has been remarkably regular: from 6.6 million in 2013 to 4.8 million in 2023, an average fall of roughly 170 000 deaths per year. Deviations from that linear trend have been modest. 
• 2019–21 showed a slightly faster decline (≈185 000/yr), possibly reflecting accelerated vaccine roll-outs and continued economic growth pre-COVID.  
• 2021–22 flattened (-52 000) as COVID-19 disruptions and economic headwinds stalled progress.  
• 2022–23 rebounded with a larger drop (-221 000), suggesting the 2022 slowdown was temporary rather than the start of a plateau.

Given historical momentum in immunisation, malaria prevention, nutrition, and neonatal care—plus restoration of health services post-pandemic—most demographers still expect incremental reductions through 2024. No major new shocks (e.g., a global pandemic spike, an unprecedented famine) were observed in 2024 that would materially reverse the trend, although regional conflicts (Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine) may trim gains slightly. Taking these competing forces into account and projecting a decrease roughly in line with the 10-year average (150–180 k), the median 2024 figure would likely sit near 4.6–4.7 million. However, the wide empirical range over the past four years (-52 k to -221 k) argues for considering a broader uncertainty distribution (≈4.4–4.9 million central 80 %). To tighten the estimate we need: (a) any preliminary 2024 UN IGME tables, (b) country-level vital-registration updates for China, India, Nigeria, DRC, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and (c) papers on service-delivery recovery post-COVID.
