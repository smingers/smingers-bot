Forecasting Question:
What will be the total median number of global under-5 child deaths reported in UNICEF's 2026 report for 2024?

Question background:
The total number of under-5 child deaths is a critical indicator of global health progress and child wellbeing worldwide. UNICEF, along with the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), releases these figures in their [annual reports on child mortality](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality).

According to their data, the median total number of under-5 deaths globally has been steadily declining:

* 2013: 6.6 million
* 2014: 6.4 million
* 2015: 6.2 million
* 2016: 6 million
* 2017: 5.9 million
* 2018: 5.6 million
* 2019: 5.4 million
* 2020: 5.2 million
* 2021: 5 million
* 2022: 5 million
* 2023: 4.8 million

Before 2020, there was usually a yearly decrease of \~200,000 deaths per year. Then it was:

* 2020 - 217,000 decrease from 2019
* 2021 - 154,000 decrease from 2020
* 2022 - 52,000 decrease from 2021
* 2023 - 221,000 decrease from 2022

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the median number of under-5 deaths worldwide for the year 2024 as reported by UNICEF/UN IGME, expected to be released in March 2026. These will likely be published on the UN IGME website ([https://childmortality.org](https://childmortality.org/)) or on UNICEF's website ([https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/)).

If the reporting methodology changes substantially between now and 2026, this question will resolve according to the official figure provided by UNICEF/UN IGME for 2024 under whatever methodology they are using at that time.

In the event that no report is published by May 31, 2026, or if the report does not include a specific figure for global under-5 deaths in 2024, this question should resolve as ambiguous.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-05. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-05 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 3.3 and the upper bound is 6.3.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Note that this is a numeric question, with expected answer format as a discrete CDF (not required for this answer).

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most three sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
