In the video, filmed at San Pietro in Vincoli in the Vatican, the Pope emphasized the presence of God in the fragile bodies of these children and their enduring smiles amid pain, describing them as signs of His kingdom. He called for adequate medical treatment, compassionate human care, and community support for these children and their families. The Pope also prayed for healthcare workers, asking that their work be guided by active compassion, patience, and mercy. According to the Vatican News report, the initiative is part of the global 'Pray With the Pope' campaign, launched in January 2025, which includes the Pope\u2019s video and audio messages. The campaign urges the global Church and all people of goodwill to join in prayer. The Pope highlighted that while over 400,000 children and adolescents under 19 are diagnosed with cancer annually\u201480% survive in high-income countries, compared to less than 30% in low- and middle-income nations\u2014millions more suffer from chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses. UNICEF reports over 2.1 billion children and adolescents worldwide live with long-term health conditions, with about one million under 20 dying annually from treatable or preventable causes. The Pope reaffirmed that even when healing is unlikely, all patients have the right to medical, psychological, spiritual, and humanitarian care. This is not the first time the Pope has focused on suffering children; in 2024, his February intention was for patients nearing death, distinguishing between incurable and untreatable conditions. The Vatican notes that over 20 million people across 90 countries participated in the prayer initiative, reflecting a global network of solidarity and compassion. As Father Cristobal Fonseca, Director of the Global Prayer Network, stated, 'This shared prayer touches hearts and deepens commitment, uniting strangers in tangible support for children and families enduring hardship.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 02:10 PM\nSource:[vaticannews.va](https://www.vaticannews.va/ar/pope/news/2026-02/intenzione-di-preghiera-il-mese-di-febbraio-2026.html)\n\n**Global aid cuts could lead to 23 million deaths by 2030, study estimates**\nA study published in The Lancet Global Health estimates that ongoing and proposed cuts to global aid funding could lead to 23 million additional deaths worldwide by 2030, with 5.4 million of those among children under 5 years old in a severe defunding scenario. The research, led by the Institute of Collective Health at the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil, analyzed data from 93 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) representing 6.3 billion people between 2002 and 2021. It found that higher levels of official development assistance (ODA) were associated with a 23% reduction in age-standardized all-cause mortality and a 39% reduction in under-5 mortality, particularly for communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS (70% decline), malaria (56%), and neglected tropical diseases (54%). Current defunding trends project 9.4 million total deaths by 2030, including 2.5 million child deaths. In a worst-case scenario, total deaths could reach 22.6 million, with 5.4 million under-5 deaths. Major donor countries\u2014United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France\u2014have announced substantial reductions in ODA, marking the first major decline in nearly 30 years. The dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in July 2025 is expected to result in a nearly 40% loss in funding. Projections indicate that in 2025, least developed countries could face a 13\u201325% net bilateral ODA reduction, sub-Saharan Africa a 16\u201328% decline, and health-specific aid a 19\u201333% drop. Preliminary 2025 projections suggest further reductions in 2026, with ODA falling by 56.1% in the U.S., 38.9% in the U.K., 36.0% in Germany, and 18.5% in France compared to 2023 levels. If USAID programs remain halted, models project 14.1 million deaths in LMICs by 2030, including 4.5 million child deaths, along with over 4 million additional AIDS deaths, more than 600,000 tuberculosis deaths, 2.5 million child deaths, and millions of unplanned pregnancies and unsafe abortions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:28 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/global-aid-cuts-could-lead-23-million-deaths-2030-study-estimates)\n\n**Measles Outbreak, AI Child Exploitation, and Controversial Death Penalty Law: Global Alerts on February 4, 2026**\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has issued an epidemiological alert urging countries in the region to intensify surveillance and vaccination efforts due to a 32-fold increase in measles cases in 2025 compared to 2024, with nearly 15,000 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. In the first three weeks of 2026 alone, over 1,000 new cases were reported across seven countries\u2014a 43-fold increase compared to the same period in 2025. Mexico, the United States, Canada, and Bolivia account for the majority of current cases. Key data shows that 78% of confirmed cases involved unvaccinated individuals. Although cases are rising among adolescents and adults, children under one year old are the most vulnerable and have the highest infection rates. Vaccination coverage remains dangerously low, with only one-third of countries reaching the 95% target for the first dose of the triple viral (SRP) vaccine. It is estimated that 1.5 million children did not receive any dose in 2024. Concerns are growing due to the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup and other large events, which may increase population mobility and virus spread. The UN urges countries to improve immunization levels, strengthen surveillance at ports and airports, and ensure travelers are vaccinated. The message is clear: measles is a resurgent but preventable threat. Meanwhile, UNICEF has declared a maximum alert over the rapid rise in AI-generated sexual images of children, known as 'ultrafalsos' or deepfakes. A new study by UNICEF, INTERPOL, and ECPAT reveals that at least 1.2 million children in 11 countries have had their images manipulated for explicit sexual content in the past year. In some countries, this affects 1 in every 25 children\u2014equivalent to one child per classroom. Up to two-thirds of children expressed concern about AI being used to create such content. UNICEF states: 'There is nothing 'fake' about the harm caused.' The agency calls on governments to criminalize the creation and distribution of such material, developers to prevent its generation, and digital platforms to block its spread. Independent UN experts have urgently called on Israel to withdraw a proposed law that would impose mandatory death penalty solely for Palestinians convicted of terrorism. Experts warn the law violates the right to life and is discriminatory. The mandatory nature of the penalty prevents judges from considering mitigating circumstances. Experts also note that military courts for civilians typically fail to meet standards of a fair trial, making any death sentence a violation of the right to life. They further state that hanging, the method proposed, constitutes torture or cruel treatment. The law would also eliminate the right to pardon and restrict access to legal representation, worsening an already problematic military system marked by widespread arbitrary detentions and documented torture.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/es/story/2026/02/1541100)\n\n**One Year After USAID's Dissolution, Study Projects 9.4 Million Global Deaths by 2030 Due to Aid Cuts**\nOne year after the Trump administration dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a new study published in The Lancet estimates that ongoing cuts to global development aid could cause at least 9.4 million additional deaths worldwide by 2030, with approximately 2.5 million of those deaths among children under five. The study, conducted by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) with funding from the Spanish government and the Rockefeller Foundation, models outcomes under current funding trends and compares them to 2023 levels. It analyzed data from 93 low- and middle-income countries receiving foreign aid. If funding cuts deepen by the end of the decade, the projected death toll could rise to 22.6 million. The research highlights that global aid over the past two decades reduced child mortality by 39%, HIV/AIDS deaths by 70%, malaria deaths by 56%, and deaths from malnutrition by 56%. Experts such as Jeremy Konyndyk of Refugees International confirm that aid cuts are already causing deaths, citing collapsed health systems and closed clinics in Afghanistan and South Africa. A U.S. State Department official dismissed The Lancet as a 'failed journal' and defended the shift toward trade and investment over aid, calling the old system inefficient and dependent. However, critics argue the new 'America First Global Health Strategy' risks corruption, excludes key areas like maternal and child health, and fails to address long-term consequences such as increased poverty and school dropouts. Despite some mitigation efforts by donor countries and recipient governments, experts warn that the full human cost remains underreported due to disrupted data collection and reallocation of funds.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:43 AM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/02/04/eeuu/ano-despues-disolucion-usaid-estudio-trax)\n\n**UNICEF: One in Five Children Worldwide Lives on Less Than $3 a Day**\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warns that one in five children globally\u2014412 million\u2014live in monetary poverty, surviving on less than $3 per day. These children face double the likelihood of living in extreme poverty as adults. UNICEF urges member states to prioritize the eradication of child poverty through fiscal policies protecting children, expanded social protection, and improved access to quality public services such as education and healthcare. According to the 2025 State of the World\u2019s Children report, 'Ending Child Poverty: A Universal Imperative,' 417 million children in low- and middle-income countries experience severe deprivations in two or more critical areas: education, health, housing, nutrition, clean water, and sanitation. Although child poverty has decreased by one-third since the start of the century in terms of severe deprivation in at least one core area, progress has stalled in many countries, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF emphasizes that economic hardship disproportionately affects the youngest children.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:11 AM\nSource:[La Jornada](https://www.jornada.com.mx/2026/02/04/politica/013n2pol)\n\n**World News in Brief: Children at risk in South Sudan, Balochistan attacks, summit backs boost for undersea cable security**\nOver 450,000 children in South Sudan are at risk of acute malnutrition due to escalating violence in Jonglei state since early 2026, which has displaced at least 250,000 people and disrupted health and nutrition services. UNICEF Country Representative Noala Skinner warned that a malnourished child without treatment is 12 times more likely to die. Access for aid agencies remains severely limited due to restrictions on river, road, and air travel, with six counties in Jonglei near or at the point of running out of therapeutic food and 17 health facilities closed nationwide. UNICEF has recorded 10 incidents of looting of health and nutrition supplies and is responding by delivering water purification equipment, malaria treatments, emergency health kits, and therapeutic food to over 10,000 people. In Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province, a wave of violent attacks on 31 January killed 48 people, including five women and three children, with the Balochistan Liberation Army claiming responsibility. The UN Security Council condemned the attacks as 'heinous and cowardly' acts of terrorism and expressed deep sympathy to victims\u2019 families. Meanwhile, over 70 countries convened at the International Submarine Cable Resilience Summit 2026 in Porto, Portugal, adopting a declaration to strengthen global cooperation in protecting the world\u2019s undersea digital infrastructure\u2014around 500 cables spanning over 1.7 million kilometers. ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin emphasized that resilience in submarine cables is a shared responsibility, while ANACOM Chairwoman Prof. Sandra Maximiano highlighted the vulnerability of remote and island communities. The summit followed the inaugural event in Abuja, Nigeria, signaling growing global momentum to safeguard digital connectivity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:30 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/02/1166883)\n\n**Aid cuts could kill 5.4M children under five by 2030, study finds**\nA study published in The Lancet Global Health warns that reductions in overseas aid could lead to over 22.6 million preventable deaths by 2030, including 5.4 million children under five. The research, led by Prof. Davide Rasella of ISGlobal, analyzed aid trends from 2002 to 2021 and projected outcomes under three scenarios: status quo, mild reduction, and severe reduction. In the severe scenario\u2014where aid falls to roughly half of 2025 levels\u201422.6 million excess deaths are projected, with 5.4 million among children under five. In the mild scenario, 9.4 million excess deaths are expected, including 2.5 million under-five deaths. The US reduced its aid spending from $68 billion to $32 billion in 2025, a decrease of more than half. The UK plans to cut its aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP by 2028 to fund defense. Germany, Sweden, and other major donors have also announced significant cuts. Past aid has been associated with a 39% decline in under-five mortality, particularly reducing deaths from infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and malnutrition-related deficiencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:18 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/aid-cuts-could-kill-54m-children-under-five-by-2030-study-finds/3819227)\n\n**22.6 Million Deaths by 2030 if Aid Cuts Continue, Study Warns**\nA new study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, warns that if current cuts in international development aid continue, approximately 22.6 million additional deaths could occur by 2030 in 93 low- and middle-income countries, including 5.4 million children under five. The study analyzed data from 2002 to 2021 to model health outcomes under different funding scenarios. In a moderate disengagement scenario (10.6% reduction in aid), 9.4 million avoidable deaths could occur, including 2.5 million under-five children. In a severe disengagement scenario, over 22.6 million deaths\u20145.4 million of them children under five\u2014could be avoided if aid levels were maintained. The study, published in The Lancet, highlights that between 2002 and 2021, public development assistance (ODA) helped reduce child mortality by 39%, prevent 70% of HIV/AIDS deaths, and cut malaria and malnutrition-related deaths by 56%. In 2023, ODA reached a record $250.3 billion, but in 2024, all major donors except Japan reduced their contributions\u2014the first such decline in six years. The U.S. dismantled its international development agency (USAID) in 2025, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria saw its funding drop from $15.7 billion in 2022 to $11.34 billion in 2025. Davide Rasella of ISGlobal stated, 'If we don\u2019t restore funding levels, millions of people will die\u2014this is certain.'

The analysis, based on data from 2002 to 2021, models two scenarios: a moderate cut of 10.6% (resulting in 9.4 million avoidable deaths, including 2.5 million under-five children) and a drastic increase in cuts (resulting in over 22.6 million additional deaths). In 2023, ODA reached a record $250.3 billion (\u20ac212.3 billion), with the U.S., Germany, France, the UK, and Japan contributing 70% of the total. However, in 2024, all major donors except Japan reduced their ODA, marking the first decline in six years. The U.S. abolished its international development agency (USAID) in 2025, and the Global Fund\u2019s financing dropped from $15.7 billion in 2022 to $11.34 billion in 2025. The study highlights that ODA has historically reduced child mortality by 39%, prevented 70% of HIV/AIDS deaths, and cut malaria and malnutrition deaths by 56%. Researchers emphasize that ODA is not just about direct health care but also strengthens global stability, disease surveillance, and climate resilience. Study coordinator Davide Rasella stated, 'People will die. If we don\u2019t restore funding levels, millions will die\u2014there is no doubt.'

UNICEF, announcing its 2025 global report in Cologne, stated that nearly one in five children worldwide is living in crisis-affected areas\u2014approximately double the number from the mid-1990s. Although final 2025 figures are not yet confirmed, UNICEF reports that millions of girls and boys experienced severe child rights violations, particularly in conflict zones such as Gaza Strip, Sudan, and Ukraine, where children face daily threats of death due to violence, starvation, and lack of basic services. UNICEF Germany Director Christian Schneider emphasized that children in war zones live far from the life befitting the term 'child,' noting widespread depression, sleep disorders, and developmental issues. The organization reported record levels of severe child rights violations and attacks on humanitarian workers. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone, over 35,000 cases of sexual violence against children were recorded in the first nine months of 2025. Hunger and malnutrition remain critical: globally, nearly 43 million children under five suffer acute malnutrition, and 150 million face chronic malnutrition. For the first time in a single year, famine was officially confirmed in two regions\u2014parts of Sudan and the Gaza Strip. UNICEF warns the situation will worsen due to escalating global conflicts, climate change impacts, interruptions in international aid, and rising state debt, which threaten decades of progress. It highlights that 417 million children lack access to basic needs such as food, healthcare, shelter, education, and clean water. Schneider condemned the situation as a 'clear failure of global politics and society' toward children, stating it is not a natural disaster but a man-made crisis. Aid cuts by donor countries\u2014especially the U.S. under President Donald Trump and the new German government in May 2025\u2014have severely impacted humanitarian organizations. UNICEF warns these cuts have triggered a global funding crisis, threatening children\u2019s access to education, healthcare, clean water, and food security, and increasing child mortality and poverty. UNICEF projects a need for over $7.6 billion in 2026, but due to sharp declines in donations, budget cuts are unavoidable. Critical programs\u2014especially in conflict zones and low-income countries\u2014focusing on education, healthcare, clean water, and food security are now at risk.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[detaykibris.com](https://www.detaykibris.com/unicef-cocuklar-icin-2025-tarihin-en-karanlik-yili-354754h.htm)\n\n**UNICEF: One in Five Children Affected by War or Crisis by 2025**\nAccording to UNICEF, nearly one in five children\u2014almost double the number from the mid-1990s\u2014will live in conflict and crisis zones by 2025, marking the highest number ever recorded. Children in areas such as the Gaza Strip, Sudan, and Ukraine face daily threats from explosive weapons, hunger, and lack of basic necessities. UNICEF attributes the worsening situation to global underfunding of humanitarian aid, with no signs of improvement. The organization reported minimal progress in combating hunger and malnutrition, with a sharp increase observed on the African continent.

In 2024, a record 41,370 verified cases of severe child rights violations were documented\u2014a 25% increase from the previous year\u2014involved killings, mutilations, recruitment by armed groups, abductions, and sexual violence. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over 35,000 cases of sexual violence against children were registered in the first nine months of 2025, alongside the worst cholera outbreak in 25 years. For the first time, famine was confirmed in two countries in a single year\u2014Sudan (in Darfur) and the Gaza Strip\u2014both driven by war and conflict. In Gaza, famine was declared in parts of Gaza City during summer 2025 due to war and humanitarian blockade, though it has since been lifted; however, 100,000 children still face high acute food insecurity. Christian Schneider, CEO of UNICEF Germany, emphasized that hunger and child poverty are not natural disasters but the result of systemic global policy failures. He reported from Ukraine, where children in war zones live in constant fear, suffering from depression, sleep disorders, and developmental delays. Schneider warned that 2026 will bring continued challenges, and UNICEF remains committed to protecting children wherever possible.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 05:53 AM\nSource:[tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/unicef-jahresbilanz-krieg-krisen-kinder-100.html)\n\n**Over 400 Million Children Face Severe Deprivations by 2025, UNICEF Report Warns**\nAccording to UNICEF's 2025 'State of the World's Children' report, released on World Children's Day, over 417 million children in low- and middle-income countries face severe deprivations in at least two vital areas\u2014education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, and water\u2014representing more than one in five children globally. The report, based on data from over 130 countries, reveals that 118 million children endure three or more deprivations, and 17 million face four or more. The most widespread deprivation is inadequate sanitation, affecting 65% of children in low-income countries, 26% in lower-middle-income, and 11% in upper-middle-income countries. UNICEF warns that cuts in international humanitarian aid could worsen this crisis. Catherine Russell, UNICEF\u2019s Executive Director, emphasized that poverty and deprivation are not inevitable and that effective national policies can transform children\u2019s futures. The highest multidimensional poverty rates are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with Chad reporting that 64% of children face two or more severe deprivations. Despite a decline in the proportion of children facing one or more deprivations\u2014from 51% in 2013 to 41% in 2023\u2014progress has stalled due to conflicts, climate crises, rising national debt, demographic shifts, and technological divides. The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that, due to funding cuts, it may only reach one-third of the 318 million people needing food aid in 2026\u2014more than double the 2019 figure\u2014with a $13 billion (R$69 billion) funding gap. The U.S., the largest donor, reduced foreign aid under Donald Trump\u2019s second term, and other European nations have also cut budgets. The Lancet estimates that aid cuts could lead to 4.5 million child deaths under five by 2030, while UNICEF projects six million more children could be excluded from school next year. Success stories include Tanzania, which reduced multidimensional child poverty by 46% between 2000 and 2023 through cash transfer programs and family empowerment, and Bangladesh, which cut child poverty by 32% via education expansion, electrification, improved housing, and sanitation\u2014eliminating open defecation from 17% in 2000 to 0% in 2022. The report also highlights monetary poverty: over 19% of children live in extreme poverty (under $3/day), mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and 23% of children in 37 high-income countries live in relative poverty, limiting their social participation. UNICEF stresses that poverty harms health, development, learning, employment prospects, life expectancy, and mental health, with young children, those with disabilities, and those in crisis-affected countries being most vulnerable. Although poverty declined on average by 2.5% in high-income countries from 2013 to 2023, it increased by over 20% in France, Switzerland, and the UK, while Slovenia reduced its rate by over a quarter due to strong family benefits and minimum wage laws.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 04:41 PM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/11/20/mais-de-400-milhoes-de-criancas-enfrentam-privacoes-graves-em-2025-revela-relatorio-do-unicef.ghtml)\n\n**Up to 4.5 Million Children Could Die by 2030 Due to Global Development Cuts, UNICEF Warns**\nAccording to UNICEF's annual report on the State of the World's Children, published on November 20, 2025, at least 4.5 million children under five could die by 2030 due to drastic global cuts in development aid. The report warns that slowed economic growth in developing countries threatens their ability to combat poverty and expand public services for children. UNICEF highlights that education funding is expected to decline by at least 25% by 2026, putting six million children at risk of being out of school. Currently, one in five children worldwide\u2014over 412 million\u2014live in monetary poverty, a condition that leads to child mortality, poor health and development, and limited learning. The long-term consequences include reduced employment prospects, shorter lifespans, and higher risks of depression and anxiety. Poverty also undermines societal prosperity. Conflict, climate change, and financing crises exacerbate the issue: half of children in conflict zones live in extreme poverty (compared to 11.4% in non-conflict areas), and between 2014 and 2024, extreme poverty rates in fragile and conflict-affected areas rose from 46% to 50.2%. Climate risks affect four out of five children annually, with 242 million children (one in seven) interrupting schooling due to climate shocks in 2024. Additionally, low-income countries receive less than 5% of foreign direct investment directed to developing nations. Rural residence (79% of poor children live in rural areas) and low parental education levels (32.9% extreme child poverty rate if the head of household did not complete education) further increase vulnerability. UNICEF emphasizes that ending child poverty is still possible by making it a national priority, implementing pro-child macroeconomic policies, expanding social protection, ensuring access to quality public services, and promoting decent work.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[El Nuevo Diario](https://elnuevodiario.com.do/unos-45-millones-ninos-y-ninas-podrian-morir-de-aqui-a-2030-por-recortes-en-desarrollo/)\n\n**400 Million Children Live in Poverty and Hunger Worldwide, UNICEF Warns on International Day of the Child 2025**\nOn the 2025 International Day of the Child, UNICEF released its report 'State of the World's Children 2025: Ending Child Poverty \u2013 Our Shared Responsibility,' revealing that 417 million children globally live in multidimensional poverty, lacking at least two essential needs daily\u2014such as proper nutrition and sanitation. Of these, 118 million face deprivation in three or more areas, and 17 million in four or more. The report, based on data from over 130 low- and middle-income countries, identifies conflict, global funding cuts, and climate change as key drivers worsening children's access to vital health and development services. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the highest rates, with Chad reporting 64% of children deprived in two or more areas and 25% in three or more. Sanitation deprivation is most widespread\u201465% of children in low-income countries lack adequate toilets\u2014increasing disease risks. While multidimensional poverty declined from 51% in 2013 to 41% in 2023 due to national child rights policies and economic planning, ongoing threats include conflict, climate crises, rising national debt, and reduced foreign aid. Success stories include Tanzania (46 percentage point drop in child poverty from 2000\u20132023 via cash transfers) and Bangladesh (32-point drop through government programs in education, housing, water, and sanitation). UNICEF stresses that investing in children\u2019s basic services improves health, education, longevity, and mental well-being, while reducing depression and anxiety. Over 19% of children live in extreme monetary poverty (<$3/day), with 90% concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In high-income countries, about 50 million children (23%) live in relative poverty (below 60% of national median income), limiting social participation. UNICEF recommends making child poverty eradication a national priority, integrating children\u2019s needs into economic policies and budgets, expanding social protection (e.g., cash transfers), and scaling up access to education, health, water, sanitation, nutrition, and housing. It warns that reduced development aid could lead to 4.5 million under-five deaths and 6 million children out of school by 2030. With the 2025 theme 'My Day, My Rights,' UNICEF emphasizes that investing in children is not optional but essential for a fairer, healthier, and more sustainable world.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:21 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6773065)\n\n**Over 4.5 Million Children Could Die by 2030 Due to Global Development Aid Cuts, UNICEF Warns**\nAccording to UNICEF's annual report on the State of the World's Children, published on November 20, 2025, at least 4.5 million children under the age of five could die by 2030 due to 'drastic' global cuts in development aid. UNICEF warns that each death represents not only a family tragedy but a significant loss of human potential. The organization highlights that economic slowdowns in many developing countries threaten their ability to combat poverty and expand public services for children. Aid for education is projected to decline by at least 25% by 2026, risking the school enrollment of six million children. Currently, one in five children worldwide\u2014over 412 million\u2014live in monetary poverty, a condition that endangers their lives, health, development, and learning. The effects of childhood poverty persist into adulthood, leading to worse employment prospects, shorter lifespans, and higher risks of depression and anxiety. It also undermines societal prosperity by limiting children\u2019s full development. In conflict-affected areas, half of all children live in extreme poverty, compared to 11.4% in non-conflict areas; extreme poverty rates in fragile and conflict-affected contexts rose from 46% in 2014 to 50.2% in 2024. Climate change further threatens progress, as four out of five children face at least one extreme climate risk annually\u2014such as heatwaves, floods, or droughts. In 2024 alone, 242 million children\u2014about one in seven\u2014had their education interrupted due to climate shocks. UNICEF also stresses that low-income countries receive less than 5% of foreign direct investment flowing to developing nations, making it nearly impossible to adequately invest in children. Additional risk factors include living in rural areas (79% of poor children reside there) and parental education levels; if the head of household did not complete schooling, extreme child poverty rises to 32.9%. Despite these challenges, UNICEF asserts that ending child poverty is still possible by making it a national priority, implementing pro-child macroeconomic policies, expanding social protection, ensuring access to quality public services, and promoting decent work.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 09:52 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/sociedad/4-5-millones-ninos-ninas-podrian-morir-aqui-2030-recortes-ayuda-desarrollo.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
