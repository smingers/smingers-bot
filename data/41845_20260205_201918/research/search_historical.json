reach historic low in 2022 \u2013 UN report\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n- **2022 Under-5 Deaths:** 4.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2022 (equivalent to 1 death every 6 seconds)\n- **Global Trend:** The global under-5 mortality rate has declined by 51% since 2000\n- **Additional Deaths:** Beyond the 4.9 million under-5 deaths (nearly half of which were newborns), another 2.1 million children and youth aged 5-24 died in 2022\n- **Geographic Concentration:** Most deaths were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia\n- **Country Examples:** Cambodia, Malawi, Mongolia, and Rwanda reduced under-5 mortality by over 75% since 2000\n\n**Main Causes of Death:**\n- Preterm birth\n- Complications around the time of birth\n- Pneumonia\n- Diarrhoea\n- Malaria\n\n**Projections and Challenges:**\n\n- **SDG Target Shortfall:** At current rates, 59 countries will miss the SDG under-5 mortality target, and 64 countries will fall short of the newborn mortality goal\n- **Projected Deaths by 2030:** An estimated 35 million children will die before reaching their fifth birthday by 2030, largely in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia or in low- and lower-middle-income countries\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Children in poorest households are twice as likely to die before age 5 compared to wealthiest households\n- Children in fragile or conflict-affected settings are almost three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday\n\n**Threats to Progress:**\n- Increasing inequity and economic instability\n- New and protracted conflicts\n- Intensifying impact of climate change\n- Fallout from COVID-19\n\n**Source Information:**\n- Report released March 13, 2024\n- Published by UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)\n- UN IGME includes UNICEF, WHO, World Bank Group, and UN DESA Population Division\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

Statistics and Facts:\n\n**Historical Trends:**\n- Global under-5 deaths declined from 12.8 million in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2023\n- Global under-5 mortality rate dropped by 59% from 1990 to 2023 (from 93 deaths per 1,000 live births to 37 per 1,000)\n- Neonatal deaths declined from 5.2 million in 1990 to 2.3 million in 2023\n- Neonatal mortality decline has been slower than post-neonatal under-5 mortality decline\n\n**Recent Progress Concerns:**\n- Survival gains have stalled significantly since 2015\n- 60 countries will fall short of meeting the SDG target for under-5 mortality\n- 65 countries will not achieve the SDG target for neonatal mortality\n\n**2022 Data Point:**\n- 4.9 million under-5 deaths occurred in 2022 (note: this appears to be a specific reference to 2022 data within the article)\n\n**Leading Causes of Death:**\n- Infectious diseases (acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria)\n- Pre-term birth complications\n- Birth asphyxia and trauma\n- Congenital anomalies\n\n**Geographic Disparities:**\n- Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for more than 80% of under-5 deaths\n- Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest neonatal mortality rate in 2023 at 26 deaths per 1,000 live births\n- Central and Southern Asia had 21 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023\n- A child born in sub-Saharan Africa is 14 times more likely to die in the first month than a child born in Australia/New Zealand\n\n**Note:** The article mentions both 4.8 million deaths in 2023 and 4.9 million deaths in 2022, providing recent data points relevant to forecasting 2024 figures.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://media.un.org/avlibrary/en/asset/d318/d3183283\">\n# Summary of UNICEF Global Child Deaths Story (March 12, 2024)\n\n## Key Statistics:\n\n- **2022

URL.</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve latest UN IGME provisional 2024 under-five death estimates and methodological notes; list any 2025 draft presentations or country vital-registration updates\nThe evidence that is publicly retrievable as of 5 February 2026 still shows a clear divide between (a) the limited \u201cprovisional 2024\u201d material that IGME placed in the public domain in March 2024 and (b) a newer\u2014but likewise partial\u2014round of 2025-dated outputs that quote reference-year 2023 numbers but are not yet accompanied by full annexes or slide decks.\n\n1.  Latest IGME under-five death estimates released under the 2024 cycle  \n   \u2022 A joint WHO/UNICEF/World Bank/UN DESA press package dated 13 March 2024 announced that 4.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in calendar-year 2022; the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) was given as 37 per 1 000 live births and neonatal deaths as 2.3 million (WHO news release, 13 Mar 2024 \u2013 same figures carried forward on the WHO Global Health Observatory indicator feed refreshed 16 May 2024) (datadot.who.int, updated 16 May 2024).  \n   \u2022 No PDF labelled \u201cTechnical Annex 2024\u201d or \u201cLevels & Trends 2024\u201d appears on childmortality.org; repeated direct-URL checks and Google searches return only the 2023-dated package.  \n   \u2022 Therefore the headline 4.9 million (2022) remains the latest figure that can be cited from an officially branded \u201c2024 provisional\u201d release.\n\n2.  Methodological information that accompanies the 2024 provisional figures  \n   \u2022 The March 2024 press kit included a one-page \u201cMethods note\u201d. It confirms continued use of:  \n     \u2013 the Bayesian B-spline Bias-adjusted (B3) model for U5MR estimation,  \n     \u2013 the multilevel NMR-to-U5MR regression to derive neonatal mortality, and  \n     \u2013 the Log-Quad life-table relationship to infer infant mortality.  \n   \u2022 The note contains no indication of new model architecture, software versions, data-quality thresholds or pandemic-era data-gap handling. In the absence of a 2024 technical annex, users must assume that the detailed pipeline documented in Alkema & New 2014, Alexander & Alkema 2018 and Guillot et al. 2022 is still in force.\n\n3.  Evidence that the 2025 estimation cycle has begun\u2014but only partial outputs are visible  \n   \u2022 Both UN News (25 Mar 2025) and an IPS/GlobalIssues story (28 Mar 2025) report on two IGME co-authored releases that quote a lower headline of 4.8 million under-five deaths in 2023 and 1.9 million stillbirths (UN News, 25 Mar 2025; GlobalIssues, 28 Mar 2025).  \n   \u2022 The WHO Global Health Observatory \u201cChild mortality and causes of death\u201d topic page has already been refreshed with the same 4.8 million (2023) total and a global U5MR of 37 for 2023 (who.int/gho page, accessed 5 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Our World in Data hosts an archived dataset stamped \u201cUN IGME 2025\u201d containing time-series estimates through 2023 (archive date 19 Jan 2026) (ourworldindata.org dataset). This confirms that machine-readable tables exist somewhere in the IGME pipeline, even though the customary IGME PDF/XLS annex has not yet been posted.  \n   \u2022 Despite the appearance of 2025-round numbers, no draft consultation slide deck, white paper or presentation is publicly accessible. Several targeted searches (example: \u201cIGME 2025 consultation presentation\u201d) surfaced only unrelated material (ACGME conference call for abstracts) and therefore do not represent IGME content.\n\n4.  Country-level vital-registration (VR) updates  \n   \u2022 Neither the 2024 cycle nor the nascent 2025 cycle has produced a public bulletin listing new countries that crossed the \u2265 90 % completeness threshold or that had VR data newly incorporated.  \n   \u2022 The 2023 technical annex remains the last official source for VR status.  \n   \u2022 National statistical offices continue to publish their own improvements (e.g., Brazil\u2019s IBGE and England\u2019s NCMD, noted in earlier rounds), but IGME has not yet released documentation showing how or whether these data have been integrated.  \n   \u2022 Consequently, users must continue referencing the VR classification matrix contained in the 2023 annex.\n\n5.  Summary of what is concretely available today  \n   \u2022 Provisional 2024 cycle (reference year 2022):  \n     \u2013 Under-five deaths: 4.9 million; U5MR = 37; neonatal deaths = 2.3 million.  \n     \u2013 Methodology: one-page 2024 \u201cMethods note\u201d; no detailed annex.  \n     \u2013 Country and regional tables: none publicly posted; only individual indicator values retrievable via the WHO API.  \n   \u2022 Early 2025 cycle indications (reference year 2023):  \n     \u2013 Under-five deaths: 4.8 million (UN News, WHO GHO, GlobalIssues).  \n     \u2013 Stillbirths: 1.9 million (UN News).  \n     \u2013 Machine-readable tables evidently exist (OWID dataset) but are not yet hosted on childmortality.org.  \n     \u2013 No methodological addendum or presentation slides have been released.\n\n6.  Remaining information gaps relative to the original query  \n   a. A full \u201cTechnical Annex 2024\u201d (PDF + XLS) covering 1990\u20132023 country-year estimates, input-data inventory and VR re-classification list.  \n   b. Any 2024-cycle methodological elaboration beyond the one-page brief (e.g., spline-knot settings, new survey-bias priors, COVID-era survey-gap adjustments).  \n   c. Public-domain drafts or slide decks for the 2025 consultation round that would explain the transition from 4.9 million (2022) to 4.8 million (2023) and describe any model updates.  \n   d. An explicit IGME note on new VR streams (Brazil, England & Wales, others) and how they affect the B3 input hierarchy.\n\n7.  Practical implications for researchers and programme planners  \n   \u2022 For now, citing 4.9 million (2022) as the latest \u201cprovisional 2024\u201d figure remains technically correct because it is the only number accompanied by a labelled IGME methods page.  \n   \u2022 If users wish to quote the newer 4.8 million (2023) total, they should footnote that the figure is drawn from press-oriented materials (UN News 2025, WHO GHO 2026) and that a full IGME annex is still pending.  \n   \u2022 Any country-specific work should continue to reference the 2023 annex until IGME releases the 2024 tables.  \n   \u2022 Modellers who need reproducible code must rely on the B3/NMR-regression specifications in the 2023 technical annex, given the lack of documented changes for 2024/2025.\n\nBecause the critical technical annexes and VR updates are still missing, additional targeted searches may be worthwhile once IGME approaches its usual late-year publication window. At present, however, no further publicly available documentation appears to exist.</Agent_report>\n"
