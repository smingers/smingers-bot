- **Multiple sources on Guinea-Bissau and Benin:** All confirm these occurred in Nov 2025 (before window) or were foiled (Benin, Dec 7)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **NO successful coups documented:** Multiple independent sources (DW, Al Jazeera, AFP, Carnegie) confirm that while there were coup ATTEMPTS (Benin Dec 7, Burkina Faso alleged Jan 3), none were SUCCESSFUL after Nov 28, 2025
- **Benin coup explicitly foiled:** Multiple sources (Al Jazeera, DW, AFP) confirm Dec 7, 2025 coup was stopped same day by presidential guard and ECOWAS forces
- **Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar timing:** Multiple sources confirm these occurred in November and October 2025 respectively - BEFORE the question window

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Burkina Faso Jan 3 attempt:** Russian intelligence claims (repeated in multiple outlets) suggest coup attempt on Jan 3, 2026, but: (1) only source is Russian SVR, (2) France denied involvement, (3) Burkina Faso government announced it was FOILED
- **Regional response improving:** Multiple sources note ECOWAS and AU are responding faster to prevent coups (Benin example)
- **High-risk countries identified:** CSIS expert identifies Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea as high-risk, but this is predictive, not evidence of actual events

**Weak Evidence:**
- **General instability:** Multiple sources describe political tensions, protests, security crises - but these don't automatically translate to successful coups
- **Nigeria plot:** October 2025 foiled plot shows coup planning exists but was stopped before question window

**Evidence NOT Found:**
- **Venezuela coup:** The outside view analysis mentioned an agent report claiming U.S. coup in Venezuela on Jan 3, 2026. This appears in ZERO sources provided. This would be massive news if true - its absence is strong evidence it did not occur.
- **Latin America events:** No coup attempts or successes reported in Latin America during question window

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Question Window:** Nov 28, 2025 - March 1, 2026 (93 days)
**Current Date:** Feb 6, 2026
**Elapsed:** 70 days (75%)
**Remaining:** 23 days (25%)

**If timeframe were halved (46 days):**
- Would already be past the window - probability would be 0% or 100% depending on whether coup occurred
- With 75% elapsed and no success yet, shorter window would increase confidence in "No" outcome

**If timeframe were doubled (186 days, ~6 months):**
- Base rate for 6 months: ~1.1-1.6 successful coups (double the quarterly rate)
- Would significantly increase probability, perhaps to 35-45%
- More time allows for political crises to develop and escalate

**Key insight:** The fact that 75% of the window has passed with no documented successful coup is highly informative. Coups don't occur uniformly in time, but the longer we go without one, the less likely one becomes in the remaining period.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting LOW probability:**

1. **No successful coups documented (Strong Evidence):** Despite being 75% through the window, multiple independent, reliable sources (DW, Al Jazeera, Carnegie, AFP) document NO successful coups after Nov 28, 2025. The only events are:
   - Benin (Dec 7): FOILED same day
   - Burkina Faso (Jan 3): Alleged attempt, FOILED per government announcement
   - Nigeria (Oct): FOILED before question window

2. **Improved regional response (Moderate Evidence):** Benin coup was stopped within hours by presidential guard and ECOWAS forces. This demonstrates faster, more effective responses than in 2020-2023 period.

3. **Time remaining is short (Strong Evidence):** Only 23 days left. Successful coups typically involve visible political crises building over weeks/months. Current news (Feb 5-6, 2026) shows no imminent coup situations.

4. **Latin America near-zero (Strong Evidence):** No coup attempts reported in Latin America during window. Historical base rate for Latin America is <5% per year.

**Factors supporting HIGHER probability:**

1. **High-risk environment persists (Moderate Evidence):** CSIS expert identifies multiple high-risk countries; CFR reports deteriorating security in Sahel; structural drivers (unemployment, jihadist violence) remain

2. **Burkina Faso allegations (Weak-Moderate Evidence):** If Russian intelligence claims are credible, there was a coup ATTEMPT on Jan 3. However, it was foiled, and the source credibility is questionable.

3. **Historical base rate (Moderate Evidence):** 2020-2025 saw ~2-3 successful coups per year in Africa, suggesting ~0.5-0.75 per quarter. This is non-trivial.

**Calibration from Outside View:**

Outside view base rate: 12% (for remaining 25% of window, adjusted for recent trend of foiled attempts)

**Adjustments:**
- **Strong downward adjustment (-5%):** No successful coups in 75% of window despite multiple attempts is strong negative evidence
- **Moderate downward adjustment (-2%):** Improved regional response capability demonstrated in Benin
- **Small upward adjustment (+1%):** Burkina Faso Jan 3 attempt shows coup planning continues
- **Small downward adjustment (-1%):** No visible crises in Latin America

**Final calibration:** 12% - 5% - 2% + 1% - 1% = **5%**

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view of 12%, I make the following adjustments:

**Major downward adjustment (-7%):** The fact that we are 75% through the question window with NO documented successful coup is extremely strong evidence. Multiple independent, high-quality sources (DW, Al Jazeera, Carnegie Endowment, AFP) all confirm that coup attempts (Benin, possibly Burkina Faso) were FOILED. This is not a case of lack of information - these sources actively report on African coups and would document any success.

The improved effectiveness of regional responses (Benin coup stopped within hours) suggests the structural environment has shifted from the 2020-2023 period when coups more frequently succeeded.

With only 23 days remaining and no visible political crises at boiling point (per Feb 5-6 news), the probability of a successful coup in this narrow window is low.

**Uncertainty factors (+1%):** The Burkina Faso allegations, while from questionable sources, suggest coup plotting continues. The high-risk environment (jihadist violence, economic pressures) remains. A rapid-onset coup cannot be entirely ruled out.

**Final probability: 5%**

This reflects: (1) the strong negative evidence of 75% elapsed time with no success, (2) demonstrated improvement in coup prevention, (3) short remaining timeframe, (4) acknowledgment that the base structural risks remain and a rapid event is possible but unlikely.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will a military coup successfully overthrow a government in Africa or Latin America between Nov 28, 2025 and March 1, 2026? (93-day window, 23 days remaining)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 12% for remaining 25% of window, based on ~0.5-0.75 quarterly coup rate adjusted for recent foiled attempts

3. **Consistency:** "5 out of 100 times, a successful coup occurs in the remaining 23 days" - This aligns with: strong evidence of no success in 70 days, improved prevention, short timeframe, but acknowledging non-zero structural risk

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 75% of window elapsed with zero successful coups (multiple reliable sources confirm)
   - Benin coup (Dec 7) and Burkina Faso alleged attempt (Jan 3) both foiled
   - ECOWAS/AU response faster and more effective than 2020-2023
   - No Latin America coup activity reported
   - Only 23 days remain with no visible imminent crises

5. **Blind spot:** A rapid military takeover in one of the high-risk Sahel countries (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad) triggered by sudden political crisis or assassination could occur with little warning. If this happened, my forecast would look overly confident in the status quo. However, even in this scenario, regional/international response might prevent consolidation of power, making it unclear whether it would qualify as "successful."

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is "no successful coup has occurred in the window." With 75% elapsed and improved prevention mechanisms, inertia strongly favors this continuing for the remaining 23 days. The world changes slowly, and successful coups require unusual circumstances to overcome now-faster regional responses.

Probability: 5%
