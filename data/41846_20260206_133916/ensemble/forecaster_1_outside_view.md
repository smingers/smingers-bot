**Agent Report:**
- **Factual content:** Claims ONE successful coup - Venezuela on Jan 3, 2026 (U.S. forces removed Maduro)
- **Quality assessment needed:** This is an EXTRAORDINARY claim requiring verification
- **Sources cited:** Le Monde, America Magazine, LA Times, KSAT/AP
- **Critical issue:** NO mention of Venezuela coup in ANY of the provided historical context summaries
- **Red flag:** A U.S. military coup in Venezuela would be massive international news, yet it appears in NO other source provided

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Annual African coup rate (2020-2025):**
   - 2020: Mali (1 successful)
   - 2021: Mali, Guinea, Niger attempt (2-3 events)
   - 2022: Burkina Faso x2, Guinea-Bissau (2-3 events)
   - 2023: Niger, Gabon (2 successful)
   - 2024: Bolivia attempt in Latin America (1 attempt)
   - 2025: Guinea-Bissau (Nov), Madagascar (Oct?), Benin attempt (Dec)
   - Pattern: ~2-3 successful coups per year in Africa; very rare in Latin America

2. **Three-month window successful coup rate:**
   - Question period: Nov 28, 2025 - Feb 28, 2026 (3 months)
   - Historical: Average ~2-3 successful coups/year in Africa = ~0.5-0.75 per quarter
   - Latin America: Nearly zero in recent years (last successful coup pre-2020s)

3. **Recent trend (2024-2025):**
   - Increasing coup ATTEMPTS but many are being FOILED (Benin Dec 2025)
   - Regional organizations (AU, ECOWAS) responding faster
   - Most recent successful coups occurred BEFORE question window

**Most suitable reference class:** Three-month window in Africa (2020-2025 period), as this matches the timeframe and region where coups actually occur.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 
- Start: Nov 28, 2025 (PAST - 70 days ago from Feb 6, 2026)
- End: March 1, 2026 (FUTURE - 23 days from Feb 6, 2026)
- Total window: 93 days (approximately 3 months)
- **Already elapsed: 70 days (75% of the window)**
- **Remaining: 23 days (25% of the window)**

**Critical observation:** As of Feb 6, 2026, we are 70 days into a 93-day window. The historical context provided shows:
- Guinea-Bissau coup: Nov 26-27 (BEFORE window starts)
- Madagascar coup: Likely October 2025 (BEFORE window starts)
- Benin: Dec 7 - FAILED coup attempt
- Burkina Faso: Jan 3 - ALLEGED attempt (unverified Russian claims)
- No other successful coups documented

**Historical pattern for similar 3-month periods:**
- Base rate: ~0.5-0.75 successful coups per quarter in Africa
- Latin America: ~0.05 successful coups per quarter (extremely rare)
- Combined: ~0.55-0.80 successful coups per quarter

## (d) Justification

**Key findings:**

1. **No confirmed successful coups in the window:** Despite being 75% through the question period, NO credible source documents a successful coup after Nov 28, 2025. The Benin attempt was explicitly foiled.

2. **Venezuela claim is highly suspect:** The agent report's claim of a Jan 3, 2026 U.S. military coup in Venezuela appears NOWHERE in the provided historical context. Such an event would be unprecedented and would dominate international news. This claim should be treated as unverified/false.

3. **Timing matters:** The coups that DID occur (Guinea-Bissau, possibly Madagascar) happened BEFORE the question window opened.

4. **Trend toward failed attempts:** Recent pattern shows coups are being foiled more frequently (Benin) due to faster regional response.

5. **Remaining time is short:** Only 23 days remain, and coups typically involve visible political crises building beforehand. The Feb 5, 2026 Okayafrica summary shows security concerns but no imminent coup situations.

**Base rate calculation:**
- Historical: ~0.55-0.80 successful coups per 3-month period across both regions
- This translates to roughly 55-80% probability for ANY 3-month window
- However, 75% of THIS window has already passed with NO successful coup
- For the remaining 25% of time: 0.55-0.80 × 0.25 = 0.14-0.20 (14-20% for remaining period)

**Adjustments:**
- Recent trend shows MORE attempts but FEWER successes (regional bodies responding faster)
- No visible political crises suggesting imminent coups in the next 23 days
- The question asks about SUCCESSFUL coups, and recent attempts have been foiled

Outside view calibration:

The base rate suggests 55-80% for a full 3-month period, but we're already 75% through with no successful coup documented. The remaining 23 days represent only 25% of the window.

If we assume coups are roughly uniformly distributed across time (which is imperfect but reasonable for a first approximation), the probability for the remaining period would be: 0.55-0.80 × 0.25 = 14-20%.

However, several factors suggest adjusting downward:
1. Recent coups have been foiled, not successful
2. No major political crises are at boiling point (per Feb 5 news)
3. Regional organizations are responding faster
4. Latin America contribution is near-zero

Adjusting for these factors: 14-20% → 10-15%

The Venezuela claim in the agent report, if true, would change everything to 100%. However, given its complete absence from all other sources and the extraordinary nature of the claim, I assign it <1% credibility. A U.S. military coup in Venezuela would be the biggest geopolitical story of the decade and would appear in every news source.
