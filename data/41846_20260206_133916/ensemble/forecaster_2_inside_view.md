Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (Web Articles):**

1. **CFR Article (Feb 3, 2026)** - High reliability. Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow discussing U.S. diplomatic shift toward Sahel juntas. Factual reporting on recent events (Niger airport attack, U.S. policy changes). Opinion clearly attributed to named expert.

2. **DW Article (Date unclear, likely late 2025)** - High reliability. Deutsche Welle reporting with named experts (Jakkie Cilliers, Beverly Ochieng). Identifies structural drivers and at-risk countries. Facts vs. expert opinion clearly delineated.

3. **Carnegie Endowment (Jan 30, 2026)** - High reliability. Academic analysis of 2025 African elections. Factual reporting on Uganda, Tanzania violence, Cameroon, CAR, Côte d'Ivoire. Opinion limited to institutional analysis.

4. **Malaysia Sun/RT (undated)** - Very low reliability. Russian state media via third-party outlet. Alleges French coup plots based solely on SVR claims. No independent verification. Useful only as propaganda indicator.

5. **Daba Finance Nigeria article** - Moderate reliability. Reports October 2025 Nigerian coup plot discovery. Lacks specific publication date, making temporal placement uncertain. Facts align with other sources mentioning the plot.

**AskNews Articles:**

6. **Multiple Russian/Turkish sources (Feb 2-4, 2026)** - Low-moderate reliability. All repeat identical SVR allegations about French coup plotting in Burkina Faso (Jan 3), Madagascar, Mali, CAR. No independent verification. Pattern suggests coordinated information operation.

7. **African news sources (Dec 7-8, 2025)** - High reliability. Multiple independent outlets (AFP, Punch, Firstpost, France24) confirm Benin coup attempt on Dec 7, 2025, which was **successfully foiled**. This occurred **before** the question window (which starts Nov 28, 2025 - wait, checking dates).

**Critical Date Verification:**
- Question window: Nov 28, 2025 → Mar 1, 2026
- Today: Feb 6, 2026
- Benin attempt: Dec 7, 2025 (WITHIN window, but FAILED)
- Guinea-Bissau: Nov 2025 (BEFORE window starts)
- Madagascar: Oct 2025 (BEFORE window)
- Burkina Faso alleged attempt: Jan 3, 2026 (WITHIN window, allegedly FAILED)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent sources confirm NO successful coups in the question window (Nov 28, 2025 - Feb 6, 2026).** The Benin attempt (Dec 7) was foiled; Burkina Faso's alleged Jan 3 attempt was reportedly foiled. Guinea-Bissau (Nov) and Madagascar (Oct) occurred before Nov 28.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **ECOWAS/regional response improving:** Benin coup was rapidly suppressed with Nigerian air support and regional coordination. This demonstrates enhanced coup-prevention capacity.
- **Structural drivers persist:** Multiple experts identify ongoing risks in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea. Economic pressure, jihadist threats, contested elections remain.
- **Nigeria plot (Oct 2025):** Discovered and thwarted, showing intelligence capabilities but also coup plotting activity.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **SVR allegations:** Russian intelligence claims about French coup plotting lack independent verification and appear coordinated. However, they do suggest heightened tensions and possible coup activity (even if the French involvement claim is propaganda).
- **Tanzania violence (Jan 2026):** Hundreds killed in post-election crackdown per Carnegie, but this is state repression, not a coup.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Remaining window:** Feb 6 → Mar 1, 2026 = **23 days** (0.063 years)

Using Africa base rate of ~1.3 successful coups/year:
- λt = 1.3 × 0.063 ≈ 0.082
- P(≥1) = 1 - e^(-0.082) ≈ **7.9%**

**If timeframe doubled (46 days):** ~15%
**If timeframe halved (11.5 days):** ~4%

The short remaining window significantly constrains probability. Most coups require weeks of planning and execution.

## (d) Justification

**Factors lowering probability from outside view:**

1. **No successful coups in first 70 days of window** (Nov 28 - Feb 6). Two known attempts (Benin Dec 7, possibly Burkina Faso Jan 3) both failed. This suggests heightened vigilance.

2. **Enhanced regional response:** ECOWAS demonstrated rapid, effective intervention in Benin with military support from multiple countries. This raises the cost/risk of coup attempts.

3. **Most coup-prone states already under military rule:** Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea, Gabon, Sudan all have juntas. You can't coup a coup (usually). This removes several high-risk targets.

4. **Short remaining window (23 days):** Coups require coordination, opportunity windows (often tied to elections or crises). Only 3 weeks remain.

**Factors raising probability:**

1. **Multiple failed attempts suggest active plotting:** Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria (Oct) show coup planning is ongoing across the region.

2. **Structural conditions deteriorating:** Tanzania violence, Uganda repression, economic stress, jihadist expansion all create coup-enabling conditions.

3. **At-risk countries identified by experts:** Chad (military divisions), Côte d'Ivoire (controversial 4th term), Guinea (delayed elections, junta divisions) all face near-term risks.

4. **Election triggers:** If any scheduled elections occur before Mar 1 and are disputed, this could trigger rapid coup attempts.

**Net assessment:** The failed attempts show plotting exists, but also that prevention is working. The short window and lack of successes so far argue for staying close to the Poisson baseline or slightly below.

## Probability Calibration

Starting point: 7.9% (Poisson baseline for 23 days)

Adjustments:
- **-2pp:** No successes in first 70 days despite attempts; improved regional response
- **+1pp:** Active plotting demonstrated; structural conditions favor instability
- **+0.5pp:** Remaining uncertainty about unreported events or rapid developments

**Final: 7.4% → round to 7%**

This reflects:
- Strong confidence no coup has succeeded yet (95%+)
- Modest probability (7%) one occurs in next 23 days
- Recognition that short timeframe and improved prevention lower risk
- Acknowledgment that structural instability and active plotting create non-zero risk

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will a military coup successfully overthrow a government in Africa or Latin America between Nov 28, 2025 and Mar 1, 2026?

2. **Outside view:** 7.9% based on Africa coup rate (1.3/year) over 23-day remaining window. Final prediction (7%) stays very close to this base rate with minor downward adjustment.

3. **Consistency:** "7 out of 100 times, a successful coup occurs in Africa/Latin America in a 23-day window during heightened but improving security conditions." Yes, this aligns with recent failed attempts and enhanced prevention.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - No successful coups confirmed in Nov 28-Feb 6 window (strong, factual)
   - Benin coup rapidly suppressed Dec 7 with regional support (strong, factual)
   - Multiple experts identify Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea at risk (moderate, expert opinion)
   - Nigeria, Burkina Faso plots discovered/foiled (moderate, factual)
   - Only 23 days remain in window (strong, temporal constraint)

5. **Blind spot:** A coup succeeds in Chad or Guinea in the next week following a sudden military mutiny or assassination, exploiting internal junta divisions that outside observers underestimated. This could make 7% look too low.

6. **Status quo:** No successful coups in 70 days; regional prevention improving. Status quo = no coup. Short volatile window but trend favors continuation. Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated in -2pp adjustment.

**Probability: 7%**
