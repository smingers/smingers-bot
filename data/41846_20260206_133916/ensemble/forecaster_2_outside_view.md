Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Africanews (Dec 30, 2025)**: A retrospective summary of 2025 African coups. Documents Guinea-Bissau (Nov 2025) and Benin (Dec 2025) events. The article is factual in its chronology but includes editorial opinion about "gradual acceptance of soldiers as permanent political actors." Quality: Medium - provides timeline but lacks granular detail.

**Al Jazeera (Dec 8, 2025)**: Detailed reporting on Benin's failed coup attempt of Dec 7, 2025. Factual account including specific names, timeline, and international response. Quality: High - reputable source with verifiable details and multiple corroborating elements.

**IRIS France (analysis piece)**: Expert analysis of Benin coup attempt placing it in broader political context. Mixes factual reporting with analytical opinion from an identified expert/institution. Notes the constitutional reform on Nov 15, 2025, and election scheduled for April 12, 2026. Quality: High for context, though contains more analysis than raw facts.

**Islam Times**: Reports Russian SVR allegations about French involvement in African coups, specifically claiming a failed Burkina Faso coup attempt on January 3. This is primarily opinion/propaganda from Russian intelligence sources, not independently verified. Quality: Low - single-source allegations without verification.

**Okayafrica (Feb 5, 2026)**: News roundup covering various African events. Notably does NOT report any coups in the relevant timeframe, despite covering security issues. Quality: Medium - useful as negative evidence.

**Yeni Şafak**: Reports on Madagascar coup and AU suspension. Describes Colonel Randrianirina's assumption of presidency following impeachment of President Rajoelina. Presents as factual account. Quality: Medium - provides specific details but single source.

**Agent Report**: Claims Venezuela experienced a successful coup on Jan 3, 2026, with U.S. forces removing Maduro. Also states Guinea-Bissau coup occurred Nov 26 (before the window) and confirms no successful African coups in the timeframe. **Critical issue**: The Venezuela claim is extraordinary and would be widely reported if true, yet it appears in none of the other sources. This raises serious credibility concerns about the agent report. Quality: Very Low - contains likely fabricated information.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: African coups 2020-2025**
- Historical data shows approximately 10-12 successful coups in Africa over 5 years (Mali x2, Niger, Gabon, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Guinea-Bissau, possibly Madagascar)
- This suggests ~2-2.4 coups per year in Africa
- Suitability: High - directly relevant geography and recent timeframe

**Reference Class 2: African + Latin American coups 2020-2025**
- Latin America has had very few successful coups in this period (the examples given were attempts or self-coup attempts that failed)
- Adding Latin America increases geographic scope but doesn't substantially change the base rate
- Suitability: High - matches question scope exactly

**Reference Class 3: Coups in 3-month windows**
- The question covers approximately 3 months (Nov 28, 2025 - Mar 1, 2026)
- With ~2.4 African coups/year, the 3-month probability would be roughly 2.4 × (3/12) = 0.6 coups expected
- Suitability: Highest - matches both geography and timeframe

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 23 days remaining (Feb 6 to Mar 1, 2026)

**Key temporal factors**:
1. Two coups have already occurred in the broader window (Guinea-Bissau Nov 26, Madagascar in October 2025 per question background)
2. The Benin attempt (Dec 7) was foiled
3. We are now 2+ months into the 3-month window with no confirmed successful coups in the specified timeframe

**Historical patterns**:
- Coups often cluster (Mali 2020-2021, Burkina Faso 2022)
- The Sahel region has been particularly unstable
- Recent failed attempts (Benin, possibly Burkina Faso per Russian claims) suggest ongoing instability
- Election cycles create coup risk (Madagascar crisis linked to elections, Benin has April 2026 elections)

**Critical finding**: The Madagascar coup reported by Yeni Şafak appears to have occurred, but the timing is unclear. The question background lists "Madagascar October 2025" which would be BEFORE the Nov 28 start date. However, the article doesn't specify exact dates beyond "weeks of escalating political crisis."

## (d) Justification

**For the outside view, I must determine**: Has a successful coup already occurred in the specified window (Nov 28, 2025 - Mar 1, 2026)?

**Evidence assessment**:

1. **Madagascar**: The question background itself lists "Madagascar October 2025" suggesting it occurred before the window. The Yeni Şafak article describes the coup but doesn't give precise dates. If it occurred in October, it's outside the window. If it occurred later, it would count.

2. **Venezuela claim**: The agent report's claim about a Jan 3, 2026 U.S.-led coup in Venezuela is not corroborated by any other source and seems highly implausible. Major international news would cover such an event extensively. This appears to be fabricated information.

3. **Other events**: Guinea-Bissau (Nov 26) is just before the window. Benin (Dec 7) was unsuccessful.

**Base rate calculation**:
- Historical rate: ~2.4 successful coups/year in Africa
- For a 3-month period: 2.4 × 0.25 = 0.6 expected coups
- Probability of at least 1 coup in 3 months: Using Poisson distribution with λ=0.6, P(X≥1) = 1 - e^(-0.6) ≈ 45%

**Adjustments**:
- 2+ months have already passed with no confirmed successful coup in the window
- Failed attempts suggest instability but also that coups can be thwarted
- Only 23 days remain
- The Madagascar timing ambiguity is critical but the question background suggests October placement

Given we're 2/3 through the window with no confirmed successful coup, the probability should be adjusted downward from the 45% base rate.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate suggests ~45% probability for a 3-month window. However, we are now 2+ months into the window (covering approximately 70% of the timeframe) with no confirmed successful coup meeting the criteria. 

If coups were randomly distributed, having observed none in the first 70% of the period should update our probability downward. Using a simple proportional adjustment: if 45% was the ex-ante probability, and we've observed no events through 70% of the period, the remaining probability for the final 30% (23 days) would be approximately 45% × 0.30 = 13.5%.

However, coups are not randomly distributed - they often cluster around political events. With Benin elections in April 2026 and ongoing instability in the Sahel, there remain risk factors. The failed Benin attempt shows active plotting.

Balancing these factors:
- Base rate for 23-day period: ~5-7% (2.4 coups/year × 23/365)
- Elevated risk from recent instability: +5-8%
- Uncertainty about Madagascar timing: +2-3%

This suggests a calibrated probability in the 12-18% range.

Outside View Prediction:
14%
