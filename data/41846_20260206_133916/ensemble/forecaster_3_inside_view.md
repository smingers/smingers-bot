Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (what counts)
This resolves **Yes** if **any** country in **Africa or Latin America** has a **successful** coup (“illegal and overt attempt by military/other state elites to unseat the sitting executive”) **after Nov 28, 2025 and before Mar 1, 2026**, per credible media. Otherwise **No**.

(a) Source analysis (what each says + quality)
- **CFR (Feb 3, 2026) – “A Dubious Turn in the Sahel”**: Analysis of US diplomatic shift toward Mali/Burkina Faso/Niger and worsening jihadist security (e.g., Niamey airport attack). Mostly analysis with some concrete reported actions (State Dept travel). **Quality: High** (reputable think tank). **Relevance:** indirect—speaks to instability/elite incentives but does not indicate an imminent coup.
- **DW (Dec 2025 / article provided) – “How Africa can halt the ‘new wave’ of coups”**: Reports recent coups/attempts and quotes identifiable experts (Cilliers, Ochieng) naming higher-risk countries (Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, etc.) and the “contagion” mechanism. **Quality: High** (reputable outlet + named experts). **Relevance:** moderate—supports elevated structural risk, but not near-term timing.
- **Carnegie (Jan 30, 2026) – “Africa’s Democratic Kaleidoscope”**: Documents election-related repression and legitimacy erosion (Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire, Tanzania, Cameroon, CAR). **Quality: High**. **Relevance:** moderate—political crises can raise coup propensity, but most described dynamics are medium-term, not necessarily within 23 days.
- **Nigeria coup-plot reporting (DabaFinance summary; Punch Feb 2, 2026 recap)**: Nigeria acknowledges a foiled plot; details arrests and tribunal prospects. **Quality: Mixed-to-High** (Punch is mainstream; DabaFinance is secondary but plausible). **Relevance:** moderate—shows plotting exists even in large democracies, but also shows prevention.
- **Russia/SVR allegations via RT reprints (Malaysia Sun/IslamTimes; plus various reprints in AskNews)**: Claims France plotting/behind attempts (e.g., Burkina Faso Jan 3). These are **unverified intelligence-service allegations** and appear in partisan/low-credibility republishers. **Quality: Low**. **Relevance:** weak—may signal propaganda or real intrigue, but not reliable enough to move probabilities much.
- **AskNews miscellany (sports, TV drama coup plotline, etc.)**: Not relevant to actual coups; ignore for forecasting except as noise/negative evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors)
Using your weighing system:

Strong evidence
- **Time-left constraint + no “credible-media confirmed” successful coup reported so far in-window** (status quo): With only **23 days** left and no confirmed successes already meeting criteria, baseline probability should be relatively low. (This is effectively a strong structural/time constraint.)

Moderate evidence
- **High structural coup environment in West/Central Africa (“coup belt”), with multiple recent successes and attempts** (DW + broader background list): raises the base rate above “normal world.” Mechanism: contagion + weak institutions + security/economic stress.
- **Recent foiled plots (Benin Dec 2025; Nigeria plot disclosed; Burkina Faso reportedly foiled Jan 3)**: indicates active coup entrepreneurship. Mechanism: plots exist, so conditional probability isn’t negligible.
- **Security deterioration in Sahel (CFR) + legitimacy crises (Carnegie)**: increases elite incentives to intervene, but is not a short-fuse trigger by itself.

Weak evidence
- **SVR/RT ecosystem claims about foreign-backed coup engineering**: too unreliable/strategic messaging; small adjustment at most.
- **General “expert says country X at risk” lists** without a near-term catalyst/date: informative, but low precision for a 23-day window.

Net assessment: the evidence supports “elevated background risk,” but there is **no clear near-term trigger** (e.g., election-day, leadership health crisis, sudden mutiny spreading) within the remaining window. Meanwhile, recent examples (Benin, Nigeria) show states and regional actors sometimes **successfully suppress** coups.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time remaining:** 23 days (Feb 6 → Mar 1, 2026).
- If the timeframe were **halved (~11–12 days)**, I’d reduce probability materially (roughly proportional for rare events), likely into the **~8–11%** range absent new signals.
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~46 days)** (to mid/late March), I’d raise probability meaningfully (more time for a trigger), likely into the **~20–28%** range, because the background coup rate in Africa has been high recently.

(d) Justification (updating from outside view 14%)
Outside view baseline given: **14%** for a successful coup in the remaining period.

Inside-view adjustments:
- Upward pressure:
  - Ongoing “coup belt” instability + multiple foiled plots suggest **latent capability and intent** among elite factions (moderate +).
- Downward/neutral pressure:
  - Very short time left, and **no credible reporting of a successful coup in the window so far** (strong – / anchor).
  - Evidence of **effective thwarting** (Benin, Nigeria) suggests many plots do not convert to success (moderate –).

These mostly offset. I make a small upward nudge from 14% because the density of recent attempts suggests the conditional hazard rate may be somewhat higher than the simple Poisson-from-annual-average assumption—yet not dramatically higher without a clear imminent trigger.

Probability calibration
- Starting point (outside view): 14%
- Adjustments:
  - +2% for demonstrated active plotting/instability signals (Benin/Nigeria/Burkina Faso foiled attempts; coup contagion environment)
  - -1% for demonstrated suppression capacity/regional response (Benin/Nigeria as counterexamples)
- Inside-view probability: **15%** (rounded)

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Successful coup (illegal elite attempt unseating executive) in Africa/Latin America, **Nov 28 2025–Mar 1 2026**, per credible media.
2. Outside view base rate: 14% (short remaining window; coups historically clustered but rare on 23-day scale).
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, a successful coup occurs in the region before Mar 1, 2026.” Plausible given short horizon.
4. Key evidence:
   - Only 23 days left; none credibly confirmed so far in-window.
   - Recent coup wave/contagion dynamics in West Africa (DW).
   - Multiple recent foiled plots (Benin, Nigeria; Burkina Faso claim).
   - Sahel security deterioration (CFR) and legitimacy crises (Carnegie) as background accelerants.
5. Blind spot: A sudden palace coup/counter-coup in an already-junta-led Sahel state could succeed quickly with little warning; that would push probability higher.
6. Status quo outcome: No coup is the default; short horizon favors status quo.

Probability: 15%
