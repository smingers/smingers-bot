Analysis
1. Source analysis (key sources, date, quality, factual take-aways vs. opinion)
   • CFR 3 Feb 26: Reputable think-tank. Factual: Sahel juntas still in power, worsening jihadist threat, U.S. rapprochement. Opinion: author criticises U.S. pragmatism.  
   • DW 31 Jan 26 & 17 Dec 25: Major European broadcaster. Factual: coups in Madagascar (Oct 25) & Guinea-Bissau (Nov 25) succeeded; Benin attempt failed Dec 25; eight African states now under military rule; experts list high-risk states (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea). Opinions come from named scholars—rated moderate reliability.  
   • Carnegie 30 Jan 26: Respected research institute. Factual catalogue of authoritarian drift, no coups since Nov 25. Mostly trend analysis (opinion).  
   • VOA coup database (ongoing) and AFP “10 coups in five years” 7 Dec 25: Wire-service level factual chronologies—high reliability for event dates.  
   • Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Benin January/December foiled attempts (Punch, ArcaMax, DeVerdadDigital etc.): multiple independent reports = strong evidence of repeated but unsuccessful plotting.  
   • SVR-based “France plotting coups” stories (Malay Sun, Izvestia, Haber7 etc.): single partisan source, no corroboration → weak evidence, largely ignored for forecasting.  
   • Asknews digest: no fresh coup reported after 28 Nov 25. Sports/entertainment items irrelevant.

2. Evidence analysis (strength per rubric)
   Strong: 
     – Historical base-rate: Africa+LatAm ≈10 successful coups 2020-25 → ≈1.7 / yr (wire-services, cross-checked).  
     – Structural drivers (insecurity, economic pressure, election disputes) acknowledged by multiple experts (DW, Carnegie, CFR).  
   Moderate: 
     – Cluster of very recent failed plots in Burkina Faso (3 Jan 26), Benin (7 Dec 25), Nigeria (Oct 25) shows active coup dynamics but also improved loyalist/security response.  
   Weak: 
     – Allegations of French covert operations (SVR).  
     – Social-media rumours not picked up by major outlets.

3. Timeframe analysis
   • Resolution window still open for 23 days (6 Feb → 1 Mar 26).  
   • If the window were doubled (46 days) I would add ~+5 pp; if halved (11.5 days) I would subtract ~4 pp. Coup hazard scales roughly linearly for short periods.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments
   Outside-view base rate (Poisson using 2 coups / yr) over remaining 23 days ⇒ 12 %.  
   Up-adjust +3 pp for: visible surge of coup attempts since Oct-25; concentration of risk in about ten Sahel & Gulf of Guinea states.  
   Down-adjust –1 pp for: every known plot in the last two months was foiled quickly, suggesting heightened vigilance and regional/foreign backing for incumbents.  
   Net inside-view: 14 %.

Probability calibration
I therefore judge that, as of 6 Feb 2026, there is about a one-in-seven chance that a successful coup (per Powell & Thyne definition) will occur in any African or Latin-American country before 1 Mar 2026.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Paraphrase: “Will any country in Africa or Latin America experience a successful coup between 28 Nov 25 and 1 Mar 26?”  
2. Base rate: 12 % for remaining 23 days from 2 successes / yr.  
3. Consistency line: “14 times out of 100, a coup would succeed in the next 23 days.”  
4. Top factors: a) Post-2020 coup wave (strong). b) Multiple failed plots Dec-25–Jan-26 (moderate). c) Heightened regional counter-coup response (moderate-negative). d) Very short time left (negative).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden insider move against a junta (e.g., Mali) that succeeds within 24 h and is recognised internationally. Would raise realised probability to 100 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: incumbents generally survive; recent failures reinforce this.

Probability: 14%
