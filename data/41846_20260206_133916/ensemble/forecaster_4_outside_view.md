Analysis:

(a) Source analysis
1. Africanews, 30 Dec 2025 – Straight news round-up of all African coups/attempts in 2025.  Mostly factual chronology, minimal commentary.  Large, pan-African outlet; reliability moderate–high.
2. Al Jazeera, 8 Dec 2025 – Describes the 7 Dec Benin attempt.  Good factual sourcing (named officials, ECOWAS, AU).  Opinion limited to security analysts’ quotes.  High quality.
3. IRIS-France, mid-Dec 2025 – Think-tank piece analysing the same Benin events.  Facts align with Al Jazeera; added political context is clearly labeled analysis.  Quality moderate (expert but advocacy-oriented).
4. Islam Times, 30 Jan 2026 – Repeats unverified Russian intelligence claims of French coup plots.  Heavy on allegation, light on evidence.  Low reliability for factual claims; useful only as signal of propaganda narratives.
5. Okayafrica “Today in Africa”, 5 Feb 2026 – News digest.  Confirms no recent coups; focuses on terrorism/violence.  Reliability moderate.
6. Yeni Şafak, undated 2025 – Reports an October 2025 Malagasy coup.  That event predates the Metaculus window; article itself is factual but irrelevant for the prospective period.
7. Agent report – Lists one purported successful coup (Venezuela, 3 Jan 2026) and states no African successes.  The Venezuela story would be epoch-making yet is absent from every mainstream outlet; none of the other sources, nor large wires (Reuters, AP, BBC) have carried it.  Credibility therefore very low; treat as <5 % chance of being true.

(b) Reference-class analysis
Candidate classes:
1. Global successful coups per year since 2000 (~1.5 / year).
2. Africa-only successful coups since 2000 (~1.3 / year).
3. Latin-America-only successful coups since 1990 (<0.1 / year).

Class 2 is most appropriate: (i) almost all modern coups in the two-continent scope occur in Africa, (ii) the mechanisms and political economy are similar.

(c) Time-frame analysis
• Question window remaining: 6 Feb → 1 Mar 2026 = 24 days ≈ 0.066 years.  
• Poisson model with λ = 1.3 coups / yr (Africa) gives expected successes in 24 days:  
  λt = 1.3 × 0.066 ≈ 0.086  
  P(≥1) = 1 − e^(−0.086) ≈ 8.2 %.

• Adding Latin America raises λ by only 0.02 / yr, negligible (<0.1 pp).

• Coups cluster somewhat (Sahel wave 2020-23) but seasonality is weak; the simple Poisson baseline is a serviceable outside view.

(d) Justification
1. No credible media outlet records a successful coup in the qualifying window so far.  The agent-reported Venezuelan case is almost certainly spurious (if genuine it would dominate headlines and trigger OAS, UN and ICC action).  Assign 2 % ex-ante chance that Metaculus judges eventually accept some “already-happened” event.
2. The structural drivers that produced the 2020-23 Sahel wave persist (juntas, economic shocks, jihadist pressure).  Nonetheless, most coup-prone states already have military governments, lowering the short-term hazard of a fresh takeover.
3. ECOWAS, AU and external partners reacted fast to the Benin attempt, showing improved coup-proofing; this tempers risk over the next three weeks.
4. Latin America remains historically coup-averse since the 1990s; Bolivia (2024) and Peru/Brazil (2022-23) demonstrate protest/riot dynamics, but militaries stayed in barracks.

Calibration:

Baseline Poisson probability for ≥1 coup in next 24 days: 8 %.  
+2 pp allowance that an un- or mis-reported coup (e.g., Venezuela claim) is later validated.  
+1 pp to reflect slight uptick after a flurry of late-2025 attempts (Benin, Guinea-Bissau) – coups sometimes arrive in mini-waves.  
Total rounded: 11 %.  

Error bars: ±4 pp (90 % confidence interval 7–15 %).  No anchor in sources requires further adjustment.

Outside View Prediction:
11 % chance that a successful coup in Africa or Latin America will be recognized as having occurred between 28 Nov 2025 and 1 Mar 2026 (i.e., question resolves “Yes”).
