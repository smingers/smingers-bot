Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, concise)
   • CFR 3 Feb 26 – solid, non-sensational think-tank piece; confirms Sahel juntas still in power and under pressure from jihadists.  Facts reliable, opinions from named fellow (Obadare).  
   • DW 30 Jan 26 – mainstream German public broadcaster; quotes two well-known security analysts.  Lists countries judged most at risk; factual recount of Oct–Dec 2025 coups/attempts.  
   • Carnegie 30 Jan 26 – reputable US think-tank; surveys electoral back-sliding.  Gives context on Côte d’Ivoire, Uganda, etc.; no new coup events.  
   • Russia-linked outlets (RT clone, Izvestia, etc., 2 Feb 26) – single-source allegations that France is backing fresh coups.  Highly agenda-driven, unverified → treated as weak evidence.  
   • Nigerian & Burkina Faso reports (Jan–Feb 26) – official communiqués that plots were foiled, 16 officers arrested (Nigeria), arrests in Burkina Faso 3 Jan 26.  Primary government statements, echoed by multiple outlets → moderate evidence that plotting continues.  
   • No credible wire (Reuters/AFP/AP) reports any successful coup between 28 Nov 25 and today; question-owner also states “criteria have not yet been satisfied”.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing)
   Strong  
   – Long-run statistical record: ≈1.8 successful coups per year in Africa+LatAm since 2000 (Powell-Thyne, Coup d’État Project).  
   – Memorylessness of Poisson process: expected hazard proportional to time remaining (23 days ≈ 6 % of a year).

   Moderate  
   – Cluster effect: three successful coups/2 attempts Oct-Dec 2025 suggest regional momentum still elevated.  
   – Multiple foiled plots in Jan 26 (Burkina Faso, Nigeria) show active elite dissent, raising short-term hazard somewhat.

   Weak  
   – SVR claims of French-sponsored plots (single, partisan source).  
   – Latin-American far-right electoral gains (no causal mechanism linking to imminent coups inside three weeks).

3. Time-frame analysis  
   Remaining window: 6 Feb 26 → 1 Mar 26 = 23 days (0.07 yr).  
   • If the horizon were doubled to 46 days, base Poisson probability would rise to ~23 %.  
   • If halved to 11 days, probability would drop to ~6 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view conditional on “no coup yet”:  
       λ = 1.8 yr⁻¹ × 0.07 = 0.126  ⇒  P = 1 – e^(–0.126) ≈ 11.9 %.  
   Factors nudging upward:  
       • Recent successful coups (Madagascar, Guinea-Bissau) only weeks ago → contagion effect (+2 pp).  
       • Demonstrated fresh plotting in Burkina Faso & Nigeria (+2 pp).  
   Factors nudging downward:  
       • ECOWAS, AU and local security forces on high alert after Benin & Burkina Faso attempts (–1 pp).  
       • Very short remaining window limits planning/execution (–1 pp).  
   Net upward adjustment ≈ +4 pp → 11.9 % → 16 %.

Probability calibration
I estimate a 16 % chance that at least one successful coup in Africa or Latin America occurs between now (6 Feb 2026) and 1 Mar 2026.

Checklist:
1. Restated question: “Between 28 Nov 2025 and 1 Mar 2026, will any country in Africa or Latin America see an illegal military takeover that keeps power?”  
2. Base rate: Poisson λ = 0.47 for full 94-day window ⇒ 38 % un-conditioned; conditional now 11.9 %.  
3. Consistency: “About 16 out of 100 times, a coup would succeed in the next 23 days.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical annual coup frequency ~1.8.  
   b) 71 days of the window already coup-free.  
   c) Two foiled plots in Jan 26 imply elevated plotting.  
   d) Recent successes (Oct–Dec 25) indicate contagion not exhausted.  
   e) Heightened regional security posture could deter attempts.  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid palace-guard putsch in an already-militarised Sahel state (e.g., Traoré or Goïta ousted) executed within 48 h and reported late.  Would push probability well above my 16 %.  
6. Status-quo bias check: Stability usually prevails in 3-week spans; lean slightly toward “No”.

Probability: 16%
