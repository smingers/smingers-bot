<Agent_report>
Query: List any successful coups in Africa or Latin America from 28 Nov 2025 to 6 Feb 2026 and provide sources; note whether the sitting executive was removed.
Between 28 November 2025 and 6 February 2026 only one unequivocally successful coup d’état took place in either Africa or Latin America, and it occurred in Venezuela on 3 January 2026.  No African country experienced a successful coup inside the specified window; the only events recorded for Africa were failed or foiled attempts.

1. Venezuela – 3 January 2026  
   • What happened:  U.S. Special Forces conducted a lightning raid in Caracas that deposed President Nicolás Maduro, flew him and his wife to New York to face narcotrafficking charges, and installed Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez as interim head of state.  
   • Outcome for sitting executive:  President Maduro was physically removed from office and taken into U.S. custody; therefore the sitting executive was removed.  
   • Sources:  detailed contemporaneous accounts appear in Le Monde (18 Jan 2026) and America Magazine (15 Jan 2026), with follow-up confirmation of the new interim government and reopening of the U.S. embassy carried by the Los Angeles Times (1 Feb 2026) and KSAT/Associated Press (31 Jan 2026).  

Africa: no successful coups during the window  
   • Guinea-Bissau: the military takeover occurred on 26 Nov 2025—two days before the window opens—so it falls outside the scope (The Conversation, 1 Dec 2025; Al Jazeera, 22 Jan 2026).  
   • Benin: a putsch launched 7 Dec 2025 was foiled within hours; President Patrice Talon ultimately remained in office (PBS NewsHour, 7 Dec 2025).  
   • Burkina Faso and Niger: incidents reported in January 2026 involved either attempted coups (Burkina Faso, Guardian 30 Jan 2026) or insurgent attacks, not the successful overthrow of a head of state.  

Summary table  
Country   | Date | Region | Successful? | Executive removed? | Sources  
---------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|--------  
Venezuela|3 Jan 2026|Latin America|Yes|Yes – Nicolás Maduro arrested and removed|Le Monde 18 Jan 2026; America Magazine 15 Jan 2026; KSAT/AP 31 Jan 2026; LA Times 1 Feb 2026  

Information gaps and confidence  
• No open-source record indicates any other successful coup in the two regions during the stated period.  The African cases located for December 2025–January 2026 were explicitly described as “attempted,” “foiled,” or “crushed,” and therefore do not meet the query’s criterion of success.  
• Because the Venezuelan overthrow was carried out by external forces, some datasets may code it differently (foreign intervention vs. coup).  Nevertheless, the sources unanimously report that Maduro’s government was forcibly deposed, satisfying the practical definition of a successful coup.  
• To reinforce this negative finding (i.e., that no other successful coups occurred), one could run an additional broad query such as Africa Latin America coup January 2026 to ensure no smaller states were missed, but the major international and regional outlets surveyed make this unlikely.

No further searches are required; the answer fully accounts for all known successful coups within 28 Nov 2025 – 6 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
