Analysis:
The question will resolve “Yes” only if a successful (not merely attempted) coup occurs in any African or Latin-American state between 28 Nov 2025 and 1 Mar 2026.  We therefore need the very latest reporting (Dec 2025-Feb 2026) on:  
• Any military takeovers, mutinies, or declared dissolutions of government in those regions.  
• Whether any of the late-2025 coup attempts (e.g., Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Chad) have decisively succeeded or collapsed.  
• Fresh unrest signals (rumoured plots, troop movements, presidential sackings) that could mature into a coup before 1 Mar 2026.  
Reputable international sources (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, Al-Jazeera, regional outlets) dated after 28 Nov 2025 are vital.
