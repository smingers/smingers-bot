Analysis:
The key to resolving the question is to learn whether any successful coup d’état has occurred between 28 Nov 2025 and today (06 Feb 2026) in the specified regions. Therefore the relevant historical context is:  
a) A catalogue of all reported coups or coup attempts in Africa and Latin America during Dec 2025–Feb 2026.  
b) Credible media confirmation that any such event did (or did not) succeed in unseating a sitting executive.  
c) Broader coup frequency data can help with an outside-view baseline, but the immediate need is concrete event verification within the three-month window.
