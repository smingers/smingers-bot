These problems are deep-seated, they are structural, and there's no short-term solution to them\"\n- Cautiously notes that ECOWAS and AU have taken \"a more forward-leaning, robust approach\" but is \"not sure if that will have much of a deterrent effect\"\n\n**Beverly Ochieng (Researcher, Africa program at Center for Strategic and International Studies, Dakar):**\n- Emphasizes need to address root causes: socioeconomic grievances, military discontent, and external instigators\n- **Identifies countries at particular risk:**\n  - Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger (already under military rule)\n  - Chad (differences of opinion within military)\n  - C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (President Ouattara just began controversial fourth term; country has history of military intervention)\n  - Guinea (elections scheduled for December 28, 2025; opposition unlikely to participate; divisions within junta)\n- Believes Niger coup in July 2023 \"could potentially have been defused\" but was delayed by standoff between Sahelians and ECOWAS\n- Cites Benin as example of successful coup prevention: \"this is probably the first coup that has been successfully defused, just at the point when it was happening\"\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- The article notes that successful coups elsewhere can generate momentum for coups in other countries\n- Every coup plan begins with strict secrecy, making prediction difficult\n- Benin's example shows that quick, decisive action by governments, regional communities (ECOWAS), and international partners can prevent coups\n- Long-term coup risk reduction requires solid development benefiting entire populations through economic opportunities, education, and access to basic goods and rights\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2026/01/africa-democracy-protest-elections-coups\">\n# Summary of \"Africa's Democratic Kaleidoscope: Trends to Watch in 2026\"\n\n**Source:** Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  \n**Date:** January 30, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Observations:\n\n### Recent Democratic Trends in Africa (2025):\n\n**Incumbents Clinging to Power:**\n- **Cameroon:** 92-year-old President Paul Biya won his eighth seven-year term. Main opposition candidate Maurice Kamto was disqualified, and dozens of his supporters were detained. Citizens protesting alleged fraud faced violence and arrests.\n\n- **Central African Republic:** President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra won a third consecutive term in December, having abolished term limits in 2023. Opposition access to campaign venues was limited throughout the election cycle.\n\n- **Uganda:** President Yoweri Museveni won his seventh consecutive term in January 2026 amid violence, repression, and internet shutdowns. Opposition candidate Bobi Wine claims he was abducted after the vote, escaped, and is now in hiding. One of his key allies has been arrested. General Muhoozi Kainerugaba (Museveni's son and head of armed forces) stated on social media he wants Wine dead.\n\n- **C\u00f4te d'Ivoire:** 83-year-old President Alassane Ouattara claimed his fourth term in October. Main opposition candidates were banned, and authorities cracked down on public gatherings and protests. In subsequent parliamentary elections, Ouattara's party won a landslide amid opposition boycotts and arrests.\n\n**Tanzania's Democratic Deterioration:**\n- President Samia Suluhu Hassan, initially viewed as a democratic \"bright spot\" after John Magufuli's rule, escalated repression before the 2025 election.\n- Hassan claimed a nearly 98% victory.\n- Youth protests erupted, leading to government internet shutdown and security forces shooting at unarmed protesters, leaving **hundreds dead**.\n- The article describes this as \"a brutal post-election crackdown unprecedented in the country's postcolonial history.\"\n\n**Peaceful Electoral Turnovers (2024):**\n- Botswana, Ghana, Mauritius, and Senegal all witnessed incumbent party losses.\n- South Africa welcomed its first coalition government of the post-apartheid era.\n- These new governments face pressure to deliver on governance while inheriting challenging economic conditions (declining diamond revenues in Botswana; high public debt in Senegal, Ghana, and Mauritius; infrastructure issues in South Africa).\n\n**Reform Efforts:**\n- Senegal's new leadership has prioritized anti-corruption, passing related measures.\n\n## Analysis and Predictions (from article authors):\n\n- Africa's democratic landscape \"defies a single story of systemic backsliding or reform\u2014and instead is best understood as a collection of diverging and still unsettled trajectories.\"\n- In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Tanzania, continued crackdowns and executive power consolidation are \"likely to erode governmental legitimacy\" despite strong economic performance.\n- Tanzania: \"Going back to business as usual is likely off the table.\" Key question is whether reconciliation through inclusive dialogue will occur or increasing repression will continue.\n- Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Uganda face \"actuarially inescapable transitions\" as their elderly leaders (Biya, Ouattara, Museveni) eventually leave power.\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off mid-sentence at the end of the extraction.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"http://www.malaysiasun.com/news/278852110/france-is-plotting-revenge-on-its-former-colonies\">\n# Summary of Article: \"France is plotting revenge on its former colonies\"\n\n**Source Warning**: This article is published on Malaysia Sun, citing RT.com (Russian state media) as the content source.

These victories come shortly after a serious crash during the Red Bull Rampage in Utah in October 2025, which left fellow competitor Adolf Silva with a spinal injury requiring a wheelchair. Godziek stated he recovered quickly, was training within three weeks, and is now in excellent form. He is preparing for the prestigious Natural Selection Bike event in New Zealand, which features two judged runs on different tracks with no margin for error\u2014unlike traditional events. He defends the sport\u2019s risks, saying participants voluntarily accept danger for personal growth and competition. Freestyle MTB is growing in popularity, especially in Latin America, where Godziek is more recognized than in Poland. He attributes this to rising fan bases and events like the one planned in Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j. Godziek also transitioned to freestyle motocycling, citing lower injury risk and longer career potential. He is testing an electric bike in Chile, planning to use it for high jumps in South Africa in March. While freestyle MTB remains a potential Olympic sport, no new developments have been confirmed. Godziek believes the sport\u2019s rapid evolution could mirror BMX\u2019s rise at the Olympics. He recommends starting with a bike costing around 5,000 PLN, with full suspension bikes requiring up to 10,000 PLN, but emphasizes that experience matters more than equipment. He continues to pursue his dream, saying he now lives his childhood ambition of competing globally and performing in front of audiences.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[sportowefakty.wp.pl](https://sportowefakty.wp.pl/kolarstwo/1232948/polak-rozchwytywany-w-chile-ludzie-do-mnie-krzyczeli-machali)\n\n**International Outlook: Nuclear Treaty Expiry, Ukraine Talks, Cuba Blackout, and Global Shifts on February 5, 2026**\nOn Thursday, February 5, 2026, at 08:45 GMT, major international developments were reported across multiple regions. The New START nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia expired, marking the end of a key era in post-Cold War arms limitation and raising concerns about nuclear proliferation. The U.S. now seeks to include China in future arms negotiations, reflecting shifting global power dynamics. In Ukraine, peace talks resumed in Abu Dhabi under U.S. mediation, with Moscow maintaining an uncompromising stance. Meanwhile, eastern Cuba experienced a major blackout, prompting humanitarian concerns from the United Nations. In the Middle East, Iran and the U.S. held talks in Oman on nuclear issues, with President Trump threatening military action if diplomacy fails. In Europe, Spain lifted a red weather alert after severe flooding caused by storm Leonardo, including one fatality. In the U.S., Donald Trump intensified attacks on the electoral system ahead of fall legislative elections, while food insecurity grew in suburban Washington. In Latin America, Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced a joint anti-drug alliance targeting major cocaine cartels. In Asia, Taiwan\u2019s foreign affairs vice minister welcomed a phone call between Trump and Xi Jinping, viewing it as stabilizing for the region. Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is expected to retain power after early elections, despite the Shinawatra dynasty\u2019s declining popularity. In Nepal, young voters are preparing for legislative elections on March 5, following youth-led protests that toppled the previous government. In Africa, Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister\u2019s palace is being built with funding from the UAE, reflecting growing Gulf influence in the Horn of Africa. The European Union is accelerating efforts to reduce digital dependence on the U.S. amid Trump\u2019s return to power. In technology, Alphabet (Google) announced a near-doubling of AI investments in 2026. In space, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and her crew are preparing for launch to the International Space Station, where she will conduct over 200 scientific experiments.

Originally scheduled to conclude on February 27, '\u00cata Mundo Melhor' will now air its final episode on March 13, 2026, extending its run by two weeks and increasing its total to 221 episodes. The decision was made in October 2025 by the network's leadership after observing strong audience ratings and positive public reception. The extension was intended to preserve the strong performance of the 6 p.m. slot before the launch of the new production. 'Nobreza do Amor' is set to premiere on March 16, 2026, and will feature an Afro-Brazilian fable set in the 1920s, blending romance, adventure, humor, and power struggles. The story spans two fictional worlds: the African kingdom of Batanga and the northeastern Brazilian town of Barro Preto, Pernambuco. The plot follows Princess Alika, portrayed by Duda Santos, who flees to Brazil after her father, King Cayman II (Welket Bungu\u00e9), is overthrown in a coup led by Jendal (L\u00e1zaro Ramos). Accompanied by her mother, Queen Niara (Erika Januza), Alika assumes a new identity and becomes involved with Tonho, a sugar mill worker played by Ronald Sotto. Meanwhile, Jendal crosses the ocean in pursuit of Alika, whose return would solidify his control over Batanga.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:04 PM\nSource:[nsctotal.com.br](https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/quando-vai-acabar-eta-mundo-melhor-e-quando-comeca-nobreza-do-amor)\n\n**Macron\u2019s Diplomatic Pivot to Anglophone Africa Amid Declining Francophone Influence**\nFollowing the decline of French influence in Francophone African countries, President Emmanuel Macron is shifting France's diplomatic strategy toward Anglophone nations, particularly Kenya and Nigeria, in an effort to reestablish its presence on the African continent. This pivot comes after France was compelled to withdraw from Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger due to growing political and popular resistance to its military presence, which many locals view as neocolonial interference. The French government is advancing a military cooperation agreement with Kenya, signed in October 2025 by Ambassador Arnaud Suquet and Kenyan Defense Minister Soipan Tuya, pending ratification by the Kenyan Parliament in February 2026. The agreement includes military coordination, intelligence sharing, maritime cooperation, and support for peacekeeping operations. Macron aims to move beyond historical and linguistic ties, and plans a France-Africa summit in Nairobi in May 2026 to formalize this new direction. However, analysts, including those on RFI, question France\u2019s credibility in this region, arguing it is poorly equipped to build trust. Tensions persist even in Anglophone countries: the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (BATUK) has been linked to sexual abuse scandals and environmental damage, and the 2012 killing of Agnes Wanjiru by a British soldier continues to strain relations. Moreover, revelations on February 2, 2026, suggest French intelligence may have been involved in destabilizing African leaders in the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Burkina Faso, and Mali. According to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, Macron authorized covert operations supporting armed groups. Similar allegations were made by South Africa\u2019s APC leader Themba Godi, who accused France of orchestrating nearly 20 coup attempts in Burkina Faso and of Western involvement in terrorism in Mali and Niger. Despite the shift in geography, France\u2019s approach may replicate past patterns of opacity and interference, raising doubts about whether replacing Francophone partners with Anglophone ones will succeed in overcoming deep-seated African skepticism toward Western military and political influence.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:32 PM\nSource:[R\u00e9seau International](https://reseauinternational.net/apres-leffondrement-de-son-influence-dans-les-pays-francophones-macron-tente-un-virage-diplomatique-vers-lafrique-anglophone/)\n\n**Is Africa Ready for the Emerging New World Order?**\nThe article examines Africa's readiness for the emerging multipolar world order, arguing that while global power is shifting from American hegemony to a more balanced multilateral system, Africa remains unprepared due to persistent domestic governance failures. It highlights that under Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency (2025\u20132026), the U.S. abandoned traditional alliances, imposed extreme tariffs (up to 130% on Chinese goods), threatened Canada and Greenland, and abducting Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2014actions that prompted Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney to publicly reject the U.S.-led 'rules-based order' at the 2026 World Economic Forum, signaling a rupture in Western unity. Meanwhile, long-standing U.S. allies such as France, the UK, South Korea, and Finland have increasingly pursued closer ties with China, which is seen as a more respectful partner offering non-conditional loans and infrastructure investment via the Belt and Road Initiative. However, Africa faces significant challenges: weak state capacity, widespread authoritarianism (e.g., Tanzania and Uganda\u2019s rigged elections), military coups across the 'Coup Belt' (Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Madagascar), and the African Union\u2019s inaction on crises in Sudan, DRC, and the Sahel. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), launched in 2021, has failed to deliver free movement of goods and people due to poor implementation. African nations are also vulnerable to neocolonial dynamics\u2014exporting raw materials while importing substandard Chinese goods and facing rising debt without commensurate development. The article concludes that Africa must reject dependency on external powers (West, China, or Russia), build strong domestic institutions, prioritize a 30-year development agenda, and integrate economically and politically across the continent to become a credible actor in the new world order. 'Africa cannot afford to kneel under the table instead of sitting at it,' the article asserts, warning that the continent is running out of excuses for failure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:01 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@okparaaboh/is-africa-ready-for-the-emerging-new-world-order-c2363820febd)\n\n**Mamadi Doumbouya, the New African Ally of Trump? A Geopolitical Pivot in West Africa**\nMamadi Doumbouya, the leader of Guinea since the 2021 military coup and elected president with 86.7% of the vote in December 2025, has become a central figure in a rapid U.S. diplomatic shift under the Trump administration. Following Trump's return to the White House in January 2025, Washington initiated a strategic 'charm offensive' toward Conakry, prioritizing geopolitical and geo-economic interests\u2014particularly access to Guinea\u2019s vast mineral resources\u2014over democratic conditions. The U.S. was among the first to congratulate Doumbouya after his inauguration on January 17, 2026, with high-level official Nick Checker attending the ceremony and promoting bilateral commercial ties. This move reflects a broader realpolitik strategy aimed at countering China\u2019s growing influence in African mining, especially in Guinea\u2019s world-leading bauxite reserves (over 40 billion tons) and the massive Simandou iron ore deposit (8 billion tons, 65%+ iron content). The U.S. seeks to secure alternative supply chains for critical minerals vital to defense, aerospace, and renewable energy. Despite concerns over human rights abuses and the lack of genuine democratic legitimacy in Doumbouya\u2019s regime\u2014marked by the exclusion of opposition parties and a revised constitution extending presidential terms to seven years\u2014Washington has downplayed these issues. The appointment of Bouna Sylla as Minister of Mines and Amadou Oury Bah as Prime Minister underscores the focus on economic continuity. The upcoming February 4, 2026, U.S.-hosted summit on critical minerals, featuring Guinea alongside the DRC, Kenya, and Zambia, will test the durability of this new alliance. The article argues this rapprochement signals a fundamental shift in U.S. African policy: resource security now supersedes democratic norms, positioning Guinea as a strategic player in the global competition between the U.S. and China.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:02 PM\nSource:[focusguinee.info](https://focusguinee.info/2026/02/03/mamadi-doumbouya-le-nouvel-allie-africain-de-trump-par-oumar-kateb-yacine/)\n\n**The Far Right's Advance in Latin America and Brazil's Entry into the Risk Zone**\nThe victory of the far-right in Costa Rica, decided in the first round of the 2026 presidential election, with Laura Fern\u00e1ndez of the Partido Soberano del Pueblo (PPSO) securing approximately 48.3% of valid votes against \u00c1lvaro Ramos of the Partido de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (PLN) with 33.4%, shatters the myth that 'exemplary' democracies are immune to authoritarianism. This result signals a continental shift, with implications for Brazil in its decisive 2026 election. Despite Lula being the favorite, the risk of bolsonarismo's reemergence through indirect channels remains high. The article argues that the far-right is advancing not through coups, but through democratic means\u2014exploiting fear, promoting order, and eroding institutions. The article draws parallels with El Salvador under Nayib Bukele, Argentina under Javier Milei, and other Latin American countries where right-wing governments have normalized authoritarian practices. It highlights a 'gray zone' where mainstream right-wing parties normalize authoritarian behavior by undermining democratic principles. In Brazil, even without a formal far-right candidate, the bolsonarismo project persists through figures like Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, who maintain the movement\u2019s electoral capital while avoiding overtly coupist rhetoric. The article warns that the 2026 election could see the re-emergence of bolsonarismo not through a direct candidate, but through a 'sympathetic right' that absorbs its repertory\u2014attacking the judiciary, discrediting elections, and criminalizing social policies. The imprisonment of Jair Bolsonaro, sentenced to 27 years for attempting to violently dismantle the democratic state, has been reframed as victimization, fueling a narrative of persecution. The article concludes that democracy does not die only with tanks, but when courts become enemies, elections are presumed illegitimate, and rights are treated as revocable privileges. If October 2026 leads to the electoral rehabilitation of bolsonarismo\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014it will signify a historic regression, not alternation.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:39 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/blog/a-extrema-direita-avanca-na-america-latina-e-o-brasil-entra-na-zona-de-risco)\n\n**Macron's 'Trump'-Style Plan Exposed: France Allegedly Planning Coups in Africa**\nThe Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron authorized secret intelligence operations targeting the removal of certain African leaders, aiming to restore France's influence on the African continent after years of declining power. The SVR stated that Paris views this effort as a 'political comeback' and highlighted that populist, sovereignty-oriented governments in former French colonies have rejected France's political and economic interests. The report alleges that Macron directly approved plans targeting African leaders, drawing inspiration from prior attempts against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. It claims France was involved in the January 3 coup attempt in Burkina Faso, which included an assassination attempt on President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, though unsuccessful. The SVR further asserts that France orchestrated attacks on fuel convoys, siege attempts on cities, and terrorist acts against civilians in Mali to destabilize President Assimi Go\u00efta's government. Similar plans are said to be underway in the Central African Republic, with Madagascar\u2014set to undergo a leadership change in October 2025\u2014also identified as a target. The SVR alleges that France aims to overthrow Madagascar\u2019s government, which is developing ties with BRICS, and reinstall a pro-French administration. The report accuses France of directly supporting armed and terrorist groups in Africa, claiming this has increased instability and deepened France\u2019s loss of credibility on the continent.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:23 PM\nSource:[Haber7.com](https://www.haber7.com/dunya/haber/3601185-macronun-trump-plani-ortaya-cikti-afrikada-darbe-yapacak)\n\n**Russia Accuses France of Neo-Colonial Plots to Overthrow African Leaders**\nThe Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) reported on February 2, 2026, that France is planning neo-colonial coups in several African countries, including Madagascar, Burkina Faso, Mali, and the Central African Republic (CAR). According to the SVR, President Emmanuel Macron authorized intelligence operations to eliminate 'unfavorable' African leaders and install pro-French regimes. The SVR claims France was behind a failed coup attempt in Burkina Faso on January 3, 2026, aimed at assassinating President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, with the goal of advancing pro-French and anti-pan-Africanist interests. In Madagascar, France is said to be preparing to overthrow President Michel Randidiainirina (in office since October 2025) to restore a loyal government. The SVR also alleges that France has shifted toward direct support of various terrorist groups in the Sahel region, marking a political failure of Macron\u2019s African policy. Experts from the Higher School of Economics note that France still retains influence in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger through elite networks, business ties, and former students, but that African sovereignty is growing and external military intervention is unlikely to succeed. Economic ties have weakened, with companies like Orano (uranium), Total (energy), and French banks exiting the region. While small and medium-sized French businesses remain active in retail and services, France\u2019s push to reassert influence is seen as primarily an image-driven project for nationalist and military factions. In other former French colonies like Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Benin, and Cameroon, relations remain stable due to strong economic and cultural ties. French influence historically relied on three pillars: economic cooperation, military presence (with French troops stationed in many former colonies), and cultural dominance via the widespread use of French language and legal systems. However, experts warn that this influence is declining due to economic challenges in Europe and rising competition from China, Russia, and the U.S. in Africa.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:42 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/2035847/elizaveta-gritcenko/poslednii-dovod-frantciia-khochet-likvidirovat-neugodnykh-liderov-afriki)\n\n**Afternoon recap: Grammy Awards heartbreak for Nigerians, WAFCON hosting confusion, Onitsha market reopen saga, other top stories**\nOn February 2, 2026, Nigeria was rocked by a series of major developments across sports, politics, labor, and entertainment. First, confusion emerged over the hosting of the 2026 Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON), with conflicting reports suggesting South Africa might replace Morocco as host; however, South Africa\u2019s senior sports minister, Gayton McKenzie, confirmed that Morocco remains the official host, with the tournament still scheduled for March 17 to April 3, 2026. Second, traders in Onitsha Main Market reopened their shops on Monday, defying a government-imposed 'sit-at-home' order by non-state actors, signaling a fragile return to normalcy after weeks of disruption. Third, at the 2026 Grammy Awards, South African artist Tyla won Best African Music Performance for 'Push 2 Start', marking her second win in the category, while Nigerian nominees including Burna Boy, Davido, and Ayra Starr went home empty-handed. Fourth, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) intensified their support for striking Federal Capital Territory (FCT) workers, accusing FCT Minister Wike of intimidation and vowing to continue the strike until negotiations begin, despite police urging them to reschedule a planned protest on February 3, 2026, citing security concerns. Fifth, Defence Minister Gen. Christopher Musa revealed that a coup plot targeting him and President Bola Tinubu had been foiled; an interim investigation report from January 27, 2025, confirmed a clandestine network of military officers led by an unnamed Army Colonel had coordinated the plot, with plans to arrest or assassinate key officials, though Musa dismissed the conspirators as 'unserious' and emphasized the resilience of Nigeria\u2019s democratic institutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:44 PM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/?p=2052686)\n\n**SVR: France Preparing Coups in Africa**\nAccording to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR), the administration of French President Emmanuel Macron is seeking opportunities for a 'political comeback' in Africa, with plans to orchestrate coups in Mali, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Madagascar. The SVR stated that France was involved in a failed coup attempt in Burkina Faso on January 3, 2026, which was successfully prevented. The agency claims that France's primary focus is currently on Mali, where it aims to 'create conditions for the overthrow of President A. Go\u00efta.' Additionally, the SVR alleges that Paris is attempting to destabilize the situation in CAR and Madagascar. According to the SVR, France is supplying local terrorist groups with drones and instructors through cooperation with Ukrainian authorities. This follows a series of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger between 2021 and 2023, which led to military governments that sharply shifted foreign policy, demanded the withdrawal of French troops, and reduced cooperation with EU peacekeeping missions. Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Chad have also requested the withdrawal of French forces or terminated defense agreements with France.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:17 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8398713)\n\n**Neo-colonialism and 'political revenge': Russian intelligence claims Macron is plotting coups to curb BRICS influence in Africa**\nAccording to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), France, under President Emmanuel Macron, is allegedly orchestrating a series of neo-colonial coup attempts across Africa to counter the growing influence of the BRICS alliance. The SVR claims that a failed coup attempt on January 3, 2026, in Burkina Faso aimed to assassinate President Ibrahim Traore, a leading figure in the anti-neo-colonial movement. The intelligence service alleges that France sought to install pro-French forces in Ouagadougou and undermine pan-Africanist and sovereignty-supporting movements. The SVR further asserts that France is destabilizing Mali through attacks on fuel tankers, city blockades, and civilian terror, with the goal of overthrowing President Assimi Goita. In Madagascar, following the October 2025 elections that brought pro-BRICS President Michael Randrianirina to power, the SVR claims France is working to overthrow him and restore a 'loyal regime.' The SVR also accused France of collaborating with local terrorist groups and receiving support from the Ukrainian administration, including drones (UAVs) and military trainers. The intelligence service described Macron as politically bankrupt and accused France of transforming into a 'parasitic metropolis' exploiting former colonies and obstructing their development. These claims are based on SVR intelligence reports published on February 2, 2026, by bankingnews.gr.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:10 PM\nSource:[bankingnews.gr](https://www.bankingnews.gr/index.php?id=853873)\n\n**Burkina Faso Foils New Coup Attempt Amid Regional Instability and Anti-Imperialist Tensions**\nBurkina Faso successfully thwarted a new coup attempt, with rapid and decisive popular mobilization in support of President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, an anti-imperialist leader who has been in power since 2022. This marks the fifth failed coup or assassination attempt against Traor\u00e9 since his rise to power. Traor\u00e9 has consistently accused France and the United States of orchestrating these efforts to reestablish imperial control over the country, which he claims has been under foreign domination for over a century. The coup plot aimed to seize a drone base, enabling the infiltration of foreign mercenaries and armed groups to attack key state installations, carry out targeted assassinations of military and civilian officials\u2014including Traor\u00e9\u2014and trigger widespread destabilization to justify external military intervention. The attempt occurred amid ongoing threats from jihadist armed groups destabilizing Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali, and amid heightened tensions with France, which previously maintained military presence in the region and was expelled by Traor\u00e9\u2019s government. The three nations\u2014Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali\u2014now form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), united under anti-imperialist, military-led governments. On January 3, 2026, the plot was exposed, prompting a national call for calm and mobilization. Decades of thousands of Burkinese citizens flooded the streets, surrounding the presidential palace to protect Traor\u00e9, effectively preventing any armed action. The plot is believed to have been orchestrated by Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, the former junta leader who was ousted from power, resides in Togo, and is viewed as a longstanding proxy of French and U.S. interests.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 01:01 PM\nSource:[deverdaddigital.com](https://deverdaddigital.com/burkina-faso-frustra-un-nuevo-intento-de-golpe-de-estado/)\n\n**Coup Waves in Africa: Is 2026 the Next Chapter?**\nAfrica is experiencing a surge in military coups, with successful coups in Madagascar and Guinea-Bissau, and a failed coup attempt in Benin within eight weeks. These events have raised concerns about a potential wave of coups by 2026. Currently, eight African countries are under military rule, with the 'coup belt' concentrated in the Sahel region, particularly in French-speaking nations. Experts like Jackie Sillie of the South African Institute for Security Studies attribute this trend to structural factors: rapid population growth, youth unemployment despite better education, economic pressures, security crises in the Sahel, and contested elections. Beverly Oshing from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) adds that military dissatisfaction over pay and conditions, along with external agitators exploiting government discontent, also contribute. She warns of heightened risks in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Guinea, where transitions or instability persist. The failed coup in Benin was swiftly suppressed by the presidential guard and regional actors, including ECOWAS forces from Nigeria and French intelligence support, marking a rare successful pre-emptive intervention. Analysts suggest this demonstrates a more proactive regional response, though doubts remain about its deterrent effect. Long-term solutions, according to Oshing, require inclusive economic development, access to education, basic goods, and rights to reduce structural grievances that fuel coups.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 07:03 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ar/%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-2026/a-75180380)\n\n**West Africa's Surge in Coups: Guinea-Bissau and Benin Highlight Democratic Backsliding and Regional Instability**\nAfrica has experienced 215 military coup attempts since independence, with approximately half succeeding. In the past five years alone, 10 successful coups have occurred, primarily in West Africa, with Guinea-Bissau and Benin being the most recent. The coup in Benin, which took place on Sunday, December 7, 2025, was swiftly suppressed, with the government declaring the situation 'under full control.' The military junta, known as the 'Military Committee for Re-establishment,' announced the ousting of President Patrice Talon on state television, citing the need to end his presidency amid upcoming presidential elections in April 2026. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) responded by deploying immediate military forces from Nigeria to support the legitimate government and protect the constitutional order. Nigeria\u2019s Air Force conducted airstrikes to remove coup participants from key locations, including the national TV building and a military base. ECOWAS and the African Union both condemned the coup strongly and demanded a return to civilian rule. Experts, including Dr. Naglaa Morsi from Cairo University, argue that these coups stem from weak governance, economic instability, and the rise of 'faux democracies' in West Africa, where military regimes use democratic rhetoric while undermining constitutional order. The region has become known as the 'new coup belt,' particularly due to the failure of regional institutions like ECOWAS to effectively deter coups, especially after the withdrawal of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. The success of ECOWAS in restoring democracy in Guinea-Bissau\u2014where a coup occurred just days before Benin's attempt\u2014will be a critical test of its legitimacy and influence. The situation in Benin underscores broader challenges: a lack of institutional trust, economic fragility, and military frustration with long-standing regimes backed by Western powers. The upcoming elections in Benin, originally scheduled for April 2026, are now in jeopardy, with military actors likely anticipating unfavorable results. The international community, particularly ECOWAS, faces mounting pressure to demonstrate its ability to uphold democratic norms and prevent further destabilization.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5549679)\n\n**10 coups in 5 years: The troubled past and present of Africa**\nA military coup in Benin on Sunday, April 18, 2025, marks the latest in a series of 10 successful coups across Africa within the past five years. The coup, led by soldiers who announced the ousting of President Patrice Talon, was met with claims from Talon\u2019s entourage that he was safe and the army was regaining control. The summary details the following coups: (1) Mali\u2019s Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was overthrown in August 2020 by five colonels; (2) in May 2021, Mali\u2019s military took over the interim government; (3) Colonel Assimi Goita became transitional president, delayed elections until February 2024 (later indefinitely), and in July 2025 secured a five-year mandate; (4) in September 2021, Guinea\u2019s Lieutenant-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya led a coup, arresting President Alpha Conde, and submitted his candidacy in November 2025 for December 2025 elections; (5) on October 25, 2021, Sudan\u2019s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan led a coup after tensions with civilian leaders, triggering a war between the regular army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by his former deputy, Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, which has killed tens of thousands and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises; (6) Burkina Faso experienced two coups in 2022: January saw Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba arrest President Roch Marc Christian Kabore; in September, army officers dismissed Damiba, and Captain Ibrahim Traore became transitional president, with elections postponed indefinitely and Traore granted a five-year extension in May 2024; (7) on July 26, 2023, Niger\u2019s President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown by members of the presidential guard, with General Abdourahamane Tiani assuming power, and in March 2025 the junta extended its transitional rule by at least five years; (8) in Gabon, on August 30, 2023, army officers overthrew President Ali Bongo Ondimba after his disputed election win, naming General Brice Oligui Nguema as transitional president; in April 2025, Nguema won 94.85% of the vote in a presidential election under a new constitution approved by referendum; (9) on October 20, 2025, Madagascar\u2019s President Andry Rajoelina was ousted following weeks of 'Gen Z' anti-government protests, with Army Colonel Michael Randrianirina sworn in as president, promising elections within 18 to 24 months; (10) in November 2025, military officers in Guinea-Bissau declared 'total control' of the country after general elections, suspending the electoral process and closing borders, stating a command composed of all armed forces branches would lead the country 'until further notice'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/africa-military-coups-in-5-years-benin-president-patrice-talon-ousted-13957573.html)\n\n**Benin foils coup attempt only months before crucial vote**\nBenin successfully foiled a coup attempt by military officers on December 7, 2025, just months before the country's scheduled April 2026 elections. The coup plotters, identifying as the Comit\u00e9 Militaire pour la Refondation, claimed to have ousted President Patrice Talon, citing worsening security in the north, economic mismanagement, and alleged abuses under his administration. In a televised address, Talon denounced the mutiny as an attack on the republic\u2019s institutions and vowed that the perpetrators would be punished. Authorities swiftly regained control, arresting a dozen soldiers. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) responded by dispatching troops from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone to support the government. Nigeria\u2019s air force conducted strikes in coordination with Beninese forces to contain the crisis. The attempted coup, if successful, would have made Benin the ninth West African nation to experience a coup since 2020. The incident raises investor concerns, potentially undermining Benin\u2019s economic momentum, which grew by 6.7% in 2024\u2014slightly above the 6.4% growth in 2023\u2014despite ongoing challenges including a rising Islamist insurgency in the north and the arrest of political opponents. Benin, one of Africa\u2019s poorest nations with a GDP per capita of approximately $1,500 (IMF), has $2.6 billion in outstanding Eurobonds. Talon, a former businessman who won re-election in 2021 with 86% of the vote after blocking the main opposition leader Thomas Boni Yayi, has chosen Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni as his successor. The coup attempt occurred amid a broader regional trend of military takeovers in Mali, Niger, Guinea, and Burkina Faso, driven by economic hardship, weak governance, and extremist violence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 07, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3944722)\n\n**FULL LIST: African coups in the last five years**\nA military coup attempt in Benin on April 18, 2024, adds to a series of coups across Africa over the past five years. The coup in Benin, though unsuccessful, reflects a broader regional trend. Since 2020, successful coups have occurred in Mali, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon, Madagascar, and Guinea-Bissau. In Mali, Colonel Assimi Goita led two coups and later extended his rule indefinitely, with a 2025 law granting him a renewable five-year mandate; jihadist violence contributed to the junta's weakening. Guinea\u2019s Lieutenant-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya seized power in 2021 and ran in the 2025 elections. Sudan\u2019s military chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, staged a coup in 2021, triggering a war with the Rapid Support Forces since April 2023 that has caused tens of thousands of deaths and a major humanitarian crisis. Burkina Faso saw two coups in 2022, first removing President Roch Marc Christian Kabore, then replacing Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba with Captain Ibrahim Traore, who was granted a five-year extension in 2024 amid ongoing Islamist violence. In Niger, President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown in July 2023 by the presidential guard, with General Abdourahamane Tiani assuming power; the junta extended its rule by at least five years in March 2025. Gabon\u2019s 55-year Bongo dynasty ended in August 2023 when army officers overthrew President Ali Bongo Ondimba after a disputed election; General Brice Oligui Nguema was elected in April 2025 with 94.85% of the vote under a new constitution. Madagascar\u2019s President Andry Rajoelina was ousted in October 2025 following 'Gen Z' protests; Army Colonel Michael Randrianirina took power and pledged elections within 18 to 24 months. In Guinea-Bissau, military officers seized control in November 2025 after elections, declaring 'total control,' closing borders, and suspending the electoral process. All these events highlight a surge in military takeovers across Africa, often justified by instability, jihadist threats, or claims of electoral fraud.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 07, 2025 11:18 AM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/?p=2003716)\n\n**Africa coups: 10 in five years**\nA military coup attempt in Benin on Sunday adds to a growing list of 10 successful coups across Africa within the past five years, according to a recap by AFP. The coups occurred in Mali (August 2020, May 2021), Guinea (September 5, 2021), Sudan (October 25, 2021), Burkina Faso (January and September 2022), Niger (July 26, 2023), Gabon (August 30, 2023), Madagascar (October 2025), and Guinea-Bissau (November 2025). In Mali, Colonel Assimi Goita led two coups and later extended his mandate indefinitely, while in Guinea, Lieutenant-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya submitted his candidacy for December 2025 elections. Sudan has been in a devastating war since April 2023 between the military led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces led by Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and a major humanitarian crisis. In Burkina Faso, two coups led to Captain Ibrahim Traore assuming power, with his rule extended for five years in May 2024. Niger\u2019s President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown in July 2023 by General Abdourahamane Tiani, whose junta extended its leadership by at least five years in March 2025. Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba was ousted in August 2023 after a contested election; General Brice Oligui Nguema was elected with 94.85% of the vote in April 2025 and sworn in under a new constitution. Madagascar\u2019s President Andry Rajoelina was ousted in October 2025 following anti-government protests, and Army Colonel Michael Randrianirina assumed power, pledging elections within 18 to 24 months. In Guinea-Bissau, military officers seized control in November 2025, closing borders and suspending elections after a general election, declaring 'total control' under a joint military command.

Key countries affected include Mali, where soldiers overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta in August 2020 amid protests over corruption and insecurity, and later extended the transitional mandate of Assimi Go\u00efta by five years by July 2025, undermining democratic prospects. In Guinea, Mamady Doumbouya led a coup against Alpha Cond\u00e9, initially welcomed by some citizens, but by late 2025, Doumbouya announced plans to run in the next election, raising concerns about the transition's legitimacy. Sudan experienced one of the most violent coups, with the 2023 conflict between the national army and the Rapid Support Forces causing widespread displacement and humanitarian collapse, with conditions worsening through 2025. In Burkina Faso, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was overthrown by Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, who suspended elections and extended the transition, citing ongoing security threats. In Niger, Mohamed Bazoum was deposed by Abdourahamane Tchiani in 2023, and by March 2025, the junta extended its rule for at least five years despite regional pressure from ECOWAS. In Gabon, Ali Bongo Ondimba was overthrown in 2023 by Brice Oligui Nguema, who dissolved state institutions and appointed General Horta Inta-A as interim leader. In Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina and Michael Randrianirina led a coup in 2025 amid public discontent over economic hardship and service failures. In Guinea-Bissau, Umaro Sissoco Embalo was ousted in 2023, and the military dissolved state institutions, appointing General Horta Inta-A as interim leader. Common drivers include prolonged insecurity\u2014especially jihadist insurgencies in the Sahel\u2014weak governance, constitutional manipulation, corruption, contested elections, and public frustration over unemployment, rising living costs, and failed state responses. The normalization of coups may encourage similar actions elsewhere, creating a cycle of instability.

In each case, the coup leaders remain in power, and ECOWAS has failed to restore constitutional order in any of the affected countries. This marks a significant decline in ECOWAS\u2019s authority and credibility. The most recent coup took place in Guinea-Bissau, where soldiers announced a new junta leader following a disputed presidential election. The main opposition candidate accused the military of orchestrating the takeover to block his ascension to power. Guinea-Bissau, one of the world\u2019s poorest nations and a key transit point for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, has experienced repeated coups and attempted coups since gaining independence from Portugal over 50 years ago.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20251127-all-of-africa-s-coup-leaders-during-the-past-five-years-are-still-in-power)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
