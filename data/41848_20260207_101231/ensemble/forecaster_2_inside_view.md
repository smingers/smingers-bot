Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Primary/Direct Sources:**

1. **PBS News (Jan 28, 2026)**: Factual reporting on K.G.M. bellwether trial in LA Superior Court (JCCP 5255). Reports Snap and TikTok settled; Meta and Google proceeding to trial. Expert opinions from Eric Goldman (Santa Clara Law) and Daryl Lim (Penn State Law) are identifiable and credible. **Key fact**: This is a *different case* from the state AG lawsuit.

2. **BBC (Jan 27, 2026)**: Confirms TikTok settlement hours before trial; Meta CEO Zuckerberg to testify. Expert quotes from Goldman, Leary (Catholic U), and Franks (GWU Law) are identifiable. Notes 2024 state AG lawsuit separately.

3. **CalMatters (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reports TikTok and Snap settled in *state court case* (LA Superior Court), distinct from federal AG case. Meta and Google continue as defendants. Notes federal case has June trial date.

4. **Top Class Actions (Dec 30, 2025)**: Reports 29 state AGs filed letter brief proposing single joint trial; Meta opposed, wanting multiple trials. **Critical**: No mention of settlement discussions; focus on procedural disputes.

5. **CNBC (Oct 24, 2023)**: Original filing by 42 state AGs. Tennessee AG Skrmetti quoted suggesting case "could be a vehicle for settlement talks" but also "could take individual litigation."

**Medium-Quality Sources:**

6. **AskNews articles (Feb 2-6, 2026)**: Multiple reports on *New Mexico state trial* (separate case, sexual exploitation focus, started Feb 2, 2026) and the *K.G.M. personal injury case* in LA. These are NOT the multistate AG case referenced in the question.

7. **Massachusetts court hearing (Feb 3, 2026)**: State-level case on addictive design; oral arguments only, no settlement indicated.

**Critical Distinction**: Most recent news (Jan-Feb 2026) concerns:
- Individual plaintiff K.G.M. case (LA Superior Court)
- New Mexico AG case (separate state action)
- Massachusetts AG case (separate state action)

The question asks about *People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.* (federal multistate AG case, Case 4:22-md-03047-YGR).

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Against Settlement):**
- Dec 30, 2025 court filing shows AGs and Meta in active procedural dispute over trial structure—Meta wants "more than a dozen separate trials," AGs want one joint trial. This is adversarial posturing, not settlement negotiation behavior. (Multiple sources confirm)
- No ADR referral, mediation order, or sealed settlement notices in federal docket as of Feb 2, 2026 (Agent report)
- Active summary judgment briefing ongoing (Agent report)
- Historical reference class: Only 20% of comparable multistate AG tech cases settled by 27 months; this case is at 27 months with 23 days remaining

**Moderate Evidence (Mixed Signals):**
- TikTok and Snap settling parallel litigation shows *some* companies willing to settle youth-harm cases quickly (PBS, BBC, CalMatters)
- Meta facing simultaneous jury trial in LA (K.G.M. case) with Zuckerberg testifying could create settlement pressure across all youth-harm litigation
- Expert Eric Goldman (Jan 28): "Right now a settlement is unlikely given how far apart the sides are" but "may become more possible as trial proceeds"

**Weak Evidence:**
- Tennessee AG Skrmetti's Oct 2023 comment about "vehicle for settlement" is 15+ months old and speculative
- EU charging TikTok with addictive design (Feb 6, 2026) creates regulatory pressure but no direct bearing on US settlement timeline

**Evidence NOT Supporting Settlement:**
- Zero credible sources report settlement negotiations in the federal multistate AG case
- All recent settlement activity involves *different cases* (K.G.M., New Mexico)
- Dec 2025 filing shows parties moving toward trial, not settlement

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 23 days (Feb 7 to March 1, 2026)

This is extremely short. Complex multistate AG settlements typically require:
- Weeks of negotiation on monetary terms
- Agreement among 29+ state AGs (each with different priorities)
- Drafting settlement agreement with platform design commitments
- Internal approval processes at Meta and each AG office

**If timeframe doubled (46 days)**: Would increase probability to ~6-8%. More time allows for emergency mediation if trial pressure mounts.

**If timeframe halved (11 days)**: Would decrease probability to ~1%. Physically insufficient time for multiparty settlement.

The 23-day window is at the extreme lower bound of feasibility. Settlement would require:
1. Secret negotiations already underway (no evidence)
2. Sudden Meta capitulation due to K.G.M. trial developments
3. All 29 AGs rapidly agreeing to terms

## (d) Justification

**Outside view base rate: 4%** (established from reference class analysis)

**Adjustments:**

*Negative factors (total: -2.5pp):*
- Active adversarial posturing in Dec 2025 filing (-1pp): Strong evidence against settlement mindset
- Zero evidence of settlement discussions in federal case (-1pp): All settlement news concerns different cases
- Extremely short timeframe (23 days) (-0.5pp): Below typical settlement negotiation period

*Positive factors (total: +1pp):*
- Meta facing simultaneous K.G.M. jury trial with Zuckerberg testimony (+0.5pp): Could create urgency
- Snap/TikTok settlements show industry willingness to settle youth cases (+0.5pp): Demonstrates path exists

**Net adjustment: -1.5pp**

**Revised probability: 4% - 1.5% = 2.5%**

However, I must account for extreme tail risk: A catastrophic early development in the K.G.M. trial (e.g., damaging Zuckerberg testimony, jury signals) could trigger emergency settlement talks across all youth-harm litigation. This is low-probability but high-impact.

Final calibration: **2.5% rounded to 3%**

## Probability Calibration

My outside view base rate of 4% already reflects a low probability. Current evidence strongly suggests Meta is preparing for trial, not settlement. The Dec 2025 procedural dispute is particularly telling—parties negotiating settlement don't simultaneously argue about how many trials to hold.

The 3% probability reflects:
- 1.5%: Base continuation of historic settlement pattern in final weeks
- 1.5%: Tail risk of sudden settlement driven by K.G.M. trial disaster

At 3%, I'm saying: "97 times out of 100, this doesn't settle by March 1." This feels appropriately calibrated given:
- Zero direct evidence of federal case settlement talks
- Active litigation posture
- Insufficient time for multiparty negotiation
- But non-zero chance of black swan event forcing Meta's hand

A shift to 13% would imply credible reports of active negotiations exist—they don't. A shift to 0.3% would ignore the tail risk from parallel litigation pressure.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Meta settle the multistate AG lawsuit over youth addiction design by March 1, 2026? (23 days)

2. **Base rate**: 4% from reference class of comparable multistate AG tech cases at 27-month mark with <1 month remaining.

3. **Consistency**: "3 out of 100 times, Meta settles with state AGs by March 1, 2026." Yes—this reflects very low probability with small tail risk.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Dec 2025: Meta and AGs in adversarial trial-structure dispute (strong against)
   - No settlement discussions reported in federal case (strong against)  
   - Only 23 days remain; insufficient for multiparty negotiation (strong against)
   - Meta facing parallel K.G.M. trial with Zuckerberg testimony (moderate for, tail risk)
   - TikTok/Snap settled similar cases (weak for, shows path exists)

5. **Blind spot**: K.G.M. trial produces devastating evidence/testimony in next week, triggering emergency cross-litigation settlement talks. This could shift probability to 15-20% but requires multiple low-probability events.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is toward trial preparation. No evidence of deviation. 23-day window makes status quo highly likely to persist.

**Probability: 3%**
