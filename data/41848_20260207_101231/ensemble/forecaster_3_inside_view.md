Analysis:
### 1) Resolution-criteria alignment (avoid bait-and-switch)
This resolves **Yes** only if **before Mar 1, 2026** Meta **formally announces and agrees** to a settlement in *People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.* (the multistate AG coalition case), with a **substantial majority of states** joining, and the settlement **resolves the core “addictive/compulsive design harming minors” allegations** via **money and/or binding product changes**.  
Settlements in **other** youth-harm cases (e.g., individual plaintiff bellwethers, school-district MDLs, or a single-state AG case like NM) **do not count** unless they are this specific multistate coalition case and meet the majority-states/core-issue requirements.

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

**PBS (Jan 28, 2026)** – High-quality mainstream reporting.  
- **Facts:** Jury selection began in a *different* consolidated personal-injury bellwether (K.G.M.) in LA; Snap and TikTok settled with that plaintiff; Meta/YouTube proceeding to trial.  
- **Expert opinion:** Prof. Eric Goldman says settlement “unlikely right now” given distance between parties, but could change with trial dynamics.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect; shows broader pressure, not settlement movement in the AG coalition case.

**Top Class Actions (Jan 29, 2026; Jan 30, 2025 summary on single trial proposal)** – Lower-to-mid quality (often accurate but not primary; can be sensational).  
- **Facts (Dec 30, 2025 item):** AGs proposed a **single joint trial** for the multistate case (this is directly relevant), indicating litigation structuring rather than settlement posture.  
- **Relevance:** Moderate—procedural posture suggests continuing toward trial, not imminent settlement.

**BBC (Jan 27, 2026)** – High-quality mainstream.  
- **Facts:** TikTok settled hours before bellwether trial; Meta/Google remained defendants. Zuckerberg expected to testify in that bellwether.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect; shows others settle late, but Meta did not (in that case), hinting at Meta’s willingness to litigate.

**CNBC (Oct 24, 2023)** – High-quality; background on filing.  
- **Facts:** Multistate AG coalition sued Meta alleging addictive design for minors; relief sought includes stopping practices/penalties/restitution.  
- **Expert/official statements:** AG comments (e.g., “not decided quickly”).  
- **Relevance:** Background base-rate context, not current settlement signals.

**CalMatters (Jan 30, 2026)** – High-quality regional investigative reporting.  
- **Facts:** Multiple parallel suits; mentions federal case and state court personal injury; reports TikTok/Snap settled in state case; federal trial set for June (for those matters).  
- **Relevance:** Mostly indirect; confirms litigation heat, but not that the multistate AG coalition case is nearing settlement.

**AskNews – AP (Feb 6, 2026; EU TikTok DSA charges)** – AP is high-quality, but this is **EU/TikTok**, not Meta settlement.  
- **Facts:** EU preliminarily charges TikTok over addictive design.  
- **Relevance:** Very indirect—adds to global pressure narrative but not to near-term US multistate settlement mechanics.

**AskNews – MLIVE (Feb 6, 2026)** – Credible local outlet.  
- **Facts:** School district joins federal MDL; trial set June 2026 in that track.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect; shows cases progressing, but again not the AG coalition settlement.

**AskNews – Winbuzzer (Feb 6, 2026)** – Mixed/secondary; treat cautiously.  
- **Facts claimed:** Unsealed Zuckerberg email in NM discovery; NM opening statements Feb 9.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect. Even if accurate, it pertains to NM litigation leverage, not a multistate settlement announcement by Mar 1.

**AskNews – Fox Business/Fox News Radio; Mashable; Euronews; various international rewrites (late Jan–Feb 2026)** – Variable quality; mostly summaries of the bellwether trial and Section 230 debate.  
- **Facts (common):** TikTok/Snap settled with K.G.M.; Meta continues to trial.  
- **Opinions:** “Legal shield cracking” framing; speculative implications.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect.

**Outside-view “agent report” (PACER/docket-based) referenced in your outside view** – If accurate, this is the **most probative** because it describes *the actual coalition case docket*.  
- **Facts asserted:** As of Feb 2, 2026, **no ADR/mediation referral**, **no settlement stay**, active motion practice/discovery disputes.  
- **Relevance:** Direct—lack of docket settlement signals strongly disfavors a settlement being finalized and announced in the next ~3 weeks.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (large directional pull toward NO):**
1. **Time-compression + multistate mechanics:** Only **22 days** to Mar 1. A qualifying settlement needs (i) negotiated terms resolving core allegations (money and/or design commitments), (ii) agreement by Meta, (iii) agreement by a **substantial majority** of states, and (iv) **formal announcement**. That coordination/approval burden is structurally hard to compress into weeks.  
2. **Docket posture (per agent report):** No ADR referral/settlement stay as of Feb 2 and ongoing discovery/motions ⇒ the observable institutional signals look like “litigate,” not “settle imminently.”

**Moderate evidence (modest pull toward NO, with some ambiguity):**
3. **AGs pushing a single joint trial (Dec 2025 brief):** Parties/AGs are investing in trial-structure positioning—often inconsistent with being on the brink of a comprehensive settlement. (Not dispositive; sometimes parties litigate hard while negotiating.)  
4. **Meta’s revealed willingness to go to trial in parallel bellwether:** TikTok/Snap settled; Meta did not. That’s a (noisy) indicator Meta may prefer adjudication to setting a precedent via settlement on “addictive design” theories.

**Moderate evidence (pull toward YES, but not enough given timeframe):**
5. **Rising litigation/regulatory pressure:** Multiple fronts (bellwether trial publicity; NM trial; state-level claims like MA; EU actions against peers) increase expected cost/PR risk and can motivate settlement—but translating that into a **multistate** settlement **announced before Mar 1** is still a stretch.

**Weak evidence (small adjustments only):**
6. **Expert commentary about settlement possible later depending on jury reactions** (Goldman): informative but not directly about the coalition case, and not tied to the Mar 1 deadline.

Net: The evidence remains heavily skewed toward **NO settlement by Mar 1**; the main “YES” driver is general pressure, but it doesn’t overcome the coordination/time constraint plus lack of docket settlement signals.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecasting window:** **22 days** (from Feb 7, 2026 to Mar 1, 2026).
- **If halved (~11 days):** Probability would drop further; the logistical/approval bottleneck dominates. I’d be around **~2–3%**.
- **If doubled (~44 days):** Still not “likely,” but enough time for an off-docket negotiation to surface and be papered/approved; I’d move to roughly **~8–12%** (still constrained by “substantial majority of states” + core-issue resolution requirements).

---

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view
**Outside view base rate you established:** **4%**.

**What’s new since the outside view / what actually moves the needle?**
- The newest items mostly reinforce that the broader ecosystem is heating up (bellwether trial ongoing; other defendants settling; additional AG/state cases proceeding). This **does increase** Meta’s incentive to explore global peace eventually.
- But critically, nothing in the provided current reporting indicates the *coalition AG case* is in active settlement closure mode (no reported mediation, no settlement framework leaks, no stay, no joint motion indicating talks, no announced term sheet).

**My inside-view adjustment:** a *small upward nudge* from 4% to **5%**, mainly because:
- We are nearing the ~30-month window where some large AG coalitions historically do settle (your reference class), and
- parallel trials and document unsealing can sometimes precipitate sudden “we’re settling everything” moves.

However, the **time-left + multistate approval + lack of docket/press settlement signals** remain dominant, capping this probability in the low single digits.

---

Probability calibration
- Outside view: **4%**
- Adjustments:
  - +1% for escalating multi-front pressure and proximity to typical settlement windows (moderate, but real)
  - 0% (no additional positive direct signals about coalition settlement mechanics)
- Inside view forecast: **5%**

Interpretation: even a ±10% absolute shift would be huge here (moving from 5% to 15% implies a materially plausible near-term multistate deal). I don’t see evidence strong enough to justify that.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** “Will Meta, before Mar 1, 2026, formally settle the multistate AG coalition case (*People of CA v Meta*) resolving the core youth-compulsive-design allegations, with a substantial majority of states joining?”  
2. **Outside view base rate:** 4%.  
3. **Consistency check:** “5 out of 100 times, Meta announces and finalizes a qualifying multistate settlement by Mar 1, 2026.”  
4. **Key evidence (most influential):**
   - Only 22 days; multistate majority + formal announcement requirement is hard to execute fast.
   - Docket reportedly shows no ADR/settlement stay as of Feb 2; active litigation continues.
   - AGs briefing for a single joint trial suggests trial planning, not imminent settlement.
   - Meta did not settle parallel bellwether where TikTok/Snap did.  
5. **Blind spot:** A near-complete off-docket global settlement already negotiated, awaiting coordinated sign-off/announcement—could make 5% too low.  
6. **Status quo:** Absent strong contrary signals, ongoing litigation continues; nudge toward NO is appropriate.

Probability: 5%
