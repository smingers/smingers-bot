Analysis:

## (a) Source analysis

1) **Al Jazeera (Jan 27, 2026): “TikTok settles addiction lawsuit before trial…”**  
- **What it says (facts):** TikTok (and separately Snap) settled *an individual plaintiff* “youth addiction” case on the eve of trial; trial proceeded against Meta and YouTube; trial expected 6–8 weeks; Zuckerberg expected to testify.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect. It is **not** the state-AG coalition case (*People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.*). It does, however, provide a data point that in *closely related litigation themes* (youth addiction/design), some defendants settle at the last moment.  
- **Quality:** Mainstream outlet; trial scheduling facts likely reliable. Settlement terms undisclosed; limited direct bearing on the AG suit.

2) **ABC7 San Francisco (Jan 27, 2026): “TikTok settles as social media giants face landmark trial…”**  
- **What it says (facts):** Similar to Al Jazeera; emphasizes bellwether nature; also notes “more than 40 state attorneys general” have suits against Meta; mentions separate federal bellwether trials for school districts beginning June in Oakland.  
- **Relevance:** Again mostly about the *individual* bellwether, but it corroborates that the **state AG litigation is ongoing** as of Jan 2026.  
- **Quality:** Local news; generally reliable on near-term court events; not a docket source for the AG case.

3) **Top Class Actions (Jan 29, 2026): “Meta, TikTok and YouTube face trial…”**  
- **What it says (facts):** Repeats bellwether trial narrative and that Snap settled shortly before trial.  
- **Relevance:** Minimal for the AG settlement question; it’s a different case type (personal injury MDL/bellwether).  
- **Quality:** Secondary/legal-news aggregator. Useful for orientation, weaker as a primary source.

4) **North Carolina DOJ press release (Oct 16, 2024): “Court Rejects Meta’s Efforts to Dismiss…”**  
- **What it says (facts):** A federal judge (Y. Gonzalez Rogers) denied much of Meta’s motion to dismiss, allowing many consumer-protection claims to proceed.  
- **Opinions:** AG Josh Stein’s quotes (“pleased…”, “keep fighting…”) are advocacy, not neutral forecasting evidence.  
- **Relevance:** Strong—shows the AG case cleared an early dispositive hurdle, which often increases expected litigation cost and sometimes nudges parties toward settlement, but it doesn’t indicate imminent resolution.  
- **Quality:** Primary-source government communication; reliable for the procedural outcome it reports.

5) **Skadden client alert (Mar 2025) on state AG enforcement**  
- **What it says (facts/analysis):** Notes Meta’s motion to dismiss was generally denied; uses it to illustrate AG enforcement traction.  
- **Relevance:** Moderate. It confirms posture and frames broader enforcement trends, but it’s not a case-status feed.  
- **Quality:** High legal sophistication but still *advisory/interpretive* (not a neutral court record).

6) **Broadband Breakfast (Oct 31, 2025): Texas–Google $1.375B privacy settlement; mentions Texas–Meta biometric settlement**  
- **What it says (facts):** A very large single-state settlement with Google; notes Texas previously settled with Meta for $1.4B on biometric data.  
- **Relevance:** Only contextual. These are **privacy** matters, not “youth addiction/design” allegations, but they help anchor that states *can* extract large settlements from mega-cap tech firms.  
- **Quality:** Niche policy outlet; the core settlement facts are plausibly accurate, but it’s not directly predictive for the specific multi-state youth-harm suit.

7) **Agent report (docket/timeline synthesis up to Feb 2–3, 2026)**  
- **What it says (facts):** The AG case is active in N.D. Cal. before Judge Gonzalez Rogers; latest visible activity involves a proposed order on Kentucky’s partial summary judgment motion; **no docketed ADR/mediation referral**, no stay tied to settlement; ongoing discovery disputes. Provides comparative settlement timelines (Juul ~30 months; Google Play ~29 months; Cambridge Analytica class action ~57 months; etc.), and notes this case is ~27 months old.  
- **Relevance:** High—this is the closest thing here to a *case-status* readout plus an explicit settlement-timeline reference class.  
- **Quality caveat:** It’s a compiled report (not itself a primary docket sheet), and it warns about sealed/off-record mediation. Still, the key takeaway—**no public/docket settlement posture as of early Feb 2026**—is the most decision-relevant evidence in the packet.

**Net from sources:** We have (i) related defendants sometimes settle at the courthouse steps in *other* youth-addiction litigation, but (ii) the *AG coalition* case shows **no visible settlement/ADR machinery** yet and is still litigating motions/discovery.

## (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

I see three plausible reference classes:

1) **“Most civil cases settle” (generic ABA framing).**  
- **Pros:** Very broad base rate: settlement is common in civil litigation.  
- **Cons:** Too broad to time-bound a prediction to *the next ~3 weeks*, and too broad for the special features here (multi-state coalition, political salience, injunctive terms, admissions issues, coordination costs).  
- **Usefulness:** Low for this *deadline-specific* question.

2) **Multi-state / state-AG actions against large firms (especially tech) that ended in major settlements** (e.g., Juul; Google Play; other AG-led consumer actions).  
- **Pros:** Matches the “many sovereign plaintiffs + big defendant + high stakes + negotiated remedies” structure; gives typical **filing-to-settlement** durations (~2.5–3.5 years in the agent’s examples).  
- **Cons:** Outcomes vary by legal theory (antitrust, privacy, consumer protection) and by whether there’s a clean monetary remedy vs ongoing product-design oversight.  
- **Usefulness:** High—best structural match.

3) **Bellwether personal-injury social-media “addiction” cases that settle right before trial** (Snap/TikTok in Jan 2026 reporting).  
- **Pros:** Matches the “addictive design harming minors” theme and “settle on eve of trial” dynamic.  
- **Cons:** Different plaintiffs (private parties), different remedy structure, and—crucially—this question is about a **multi-state AG coalition settlement** requiring broad sign-on and “core allegations resolved.”  
- **Usefulness:** Moderate as a qualitative nudge (late settlement is possible), weak as a timing base rate for the AG coalition.

**Most suitable reference class:** **#2 multi-state/state-AG actions vs large firms**, because the coordination/approval dynamics are similar and the agent provides explicit timeline anchors.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-07  
- **Deadline:** before 2026-03-01  
- **Time remaining:** ~22 days (~0.7 months)

**Historical pattern from the reference class provided (agent report):**  
- Multi-state tech/consumer settlements cited: **~29–30 months** from filing to (tentative) settlement disclosure in Juul / Google Play examples.  
- This Meta AG case: filed **Oct 24, 2023**, so as of Feb 7, 2026 it is **~27.5 months** old—*near the early edge* of that 29–42 month band the agent summarized.

So the question is not “will it ever settle?” but “will it settle in the next ~0.7 months,” at a moment when (per agent) there is **active motion practice and no ADR referral**.

A rough “hazard rate” way to translate this:  
- Suppose many comparable cases settle during a ~12-month window (e.g., months 30–42 after filing).  
- We are asking for settlement during ~0.7 months, and *before* the typical window even begins.  
- That combination pushes the base rate for **settlement-by-March-1** down into low single digits.

## (d) Justification (outside-view synthesis)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** The case continues litigating (motions + discovery). That is consistent with the agent’s “no ADR / no stay / ongoing briefing” characterization.

**What would need to be true for a “Yes” by March 1?**  
- Rapid convergence on terms that satisfy: (i) formal announcement, (ii) Meta agreement, and (iii) “substantial majority” of states signing on, plus (iv) resolution of the **core design/youth addiction** allegations with money and/or platform commitments.  
- In multi-state actions, the “substantial majority” requirement is a meaningful friction: even if bilateral talks accelerate, getting broad AG sign-off and papering the deal is non-trivial in <3 weeks.

**What pushes toward settlement soon (pro-Yes factors, from outside-view analogies):**  
- Related litigation (personal-injury bellwethers) has produced **eve-of-trial settlements** for some defendants, suggesting defendants sometimes prefer certainty.  
- The case age (~27 months) is approaching the earliest part of the 29–30 month settlement window seen in some prior multi-state matters.

**What pushes against settlement soon (pro-No factors):**  
- **No public/docket signal of mediation/ADR** as of early Feb 2026 (agent report). In many complex cases, visible ADR steps (magistrate settlement conference, mediator appointment, stay) often precede near-term resolution.  
- Active merits litigation (e.g., partial summary judgment motion activity) indicates the parties may still be positioning rather than cashing out.  
- Coordination + political optics: states may demand injunctive/product-design commitments that Meta could resist, making “fast” agreement less likely than in cleaner monetary/privacy cases.

**Outside-view conclusion:** Even granting that most civil cases *eventually* settle, the combination of (i) **very short remaining time (~22 days)**, (ii) **coordination-heavy multi-state settlement mechanics**, and (iii) **no visible settlement posture** makes a settlement by March 1, 2026 unlikely. The outside view lands in the low single digits, perhaps a bit above “almost impossible” because large defendants sometimes do surprise settlements when risk crystallizes.

Outside view calibration:

- Anchor: reference class suggests **~29–42 months** is a common settlement zone for comparable multi-state actions; this case is at ~27.5 months, i.e., slightly early.  
- Convert to near-term probability: If (illustratively) there were a ~12-month high-settlement window and settlements were spread somewhat unevenly across it, the chance of landing specifically in the next **0.7 months** is on the order of **a few percent** even *conditional* on settling in that year. Then discount further because we appear **pre-window** and because there’s **no ADR signal**.  
- I therefore calibrate to **~4–8%** and choose a midpoint that reflects both “late surprises happen” and “multi-state settlement within 3 weeks is hard.”

Outside View Prediction:
**6%**
