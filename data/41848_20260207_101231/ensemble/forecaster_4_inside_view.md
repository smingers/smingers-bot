Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, all 2025-26)
1. Top Class Actions (30 Dec 2025) – letter-brief by 29 AGs asking for a single joint trial; factual docket summary, low opinion content. Reliable on filing dates.  
2. CalMatters (30 Jan 2026) – federal and state youth-addiction cases status; quotes internal Meta e-mails. Fact reporting + a few expert comments; moderate reliability.  
3. PBS / BBC / Fox / others (27 Jan – 6 Feb 2026) – cover the K.G.M. bell-wether trial; accurate on dates/settlements, but this is a different lawsuit. Provide context, not direct evidence on AG case.  
4. AskNews docket synthesis (2 Feb 2026) – consolidated MDL 3047 timeline: motions pending, no ADR referral, case age 27.5 months. Fact-based, high value.  
5. CNBC (24 Oct 2023) – original filing of the AG coalition suit. Historical anchor.

Opinion separation: only docket events, settlements, and filings are treated as facts; pundit comments (e.g., “existential threat”) are ignored unless from a sitting judge or state AG.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Docket shows no mediation order, no stay, and live merits motions as of 2 Feb 2026 (structural, independent).  
• Multi-state tech enforcement settlements (Juul 30 mo, Google Play 29 mo) – reference pattern with clear timelines.

Moderate evidence
• AGs still litigating trial-structure (Dec 2025 letter) – indicates negotiating distance.  
• Late-hour settlements of Snap & TikTok in parallel private suits – shows industry sometimes settles when trial risk spikes, but different plaintiff type.

Weak evidence
• Press speculation that Meta “faces existential threat” or that companies are “getting nervous.”

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window to resolve: 22 days until 1 Mar 2026.  Doubling the window (→ 44 days) would still leave the case pre-trial and unlikely to close; probability would rise only to ~9–10%.  Halving it (→ 11 days) would drop probability to ~3%.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view base rate for settlement within any given month around years 3-4 ≈ 2–3 %.  However case age (27½ mo) is slightly earlier than the 29–42 mo cluster in analog cases, nudging odds downward.  Lack of any visible ADR signal and continued briefing are strong negatives.  The only notable pro-settlement cue is Meta seeing ugly internal docs surface in other courts, but coordinating 40+ states on full relief in < one month is logistically hard.

Net adjustment: base 6 % → subtract 2 % for earlier-than-normal timing → add 1 % for “surprise capitulation” tail → 5 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in 5 out of 100 parallel universes, Meta and a substantial majority of the state AGs publicly announce a settlement resolving the youth-addiction design allegations before 1 Mar 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Re-phrased question: “Will Meta and most suing AGs announce a full youth-addiction settlement by 1 Mar 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated (6 %).  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: a) no ADR/stay on docket; b) live summary-judgment motions; c) 29 Dec 2025 AG letter shows dispute, not accord; d) reference-class settlements occur ~30 mo+; e) only 22 days remain.  
5. Blind-spot: secret mediation already finished, global deal unveiled at once (would flip outcome).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – continuation of litigation is default.

Probability: 5%
