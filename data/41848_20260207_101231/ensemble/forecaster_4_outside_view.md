Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Al-Jazeera 27 Jan 2026 & ABC7 27 Jan 2026 & Top Class Actions 29 Jan 2026 – Factual reporting on an individual bell-wether personal-injury trial (K.G.M.) in L.A. County Superior Court; confirms Snap and TikTok settled immediately pre-trial and Meta did not.  High-quality factual data; not directly about the state-AG case but relevant because it shows Meta’s current stance toward settling parallel litigation (they are willing to face a jury at least in that forum).  
2. NCDOJ press release 16 Oct 2024 – Primary source; factual.  Notes that Judge Gonzalez Rogers largely denied Meta’s motion to dismiss in the multistate AG action, allowing the case to proceed.  
3. Skadden client advisory Mar 2025 – Secondary legal analysis; opinion-heavy but authored by recognised experts.  Confirms that the motion-to-dismiss loss was substantial and characterises the suit as “gaining traction.”  
4. BroadbandBreakfast 31 Oct 2025 – Factual report on a Texas–Google privacy settlement; shows that large tech–state AG cases can and do settle, and that Texas in particular is aggressive.  Only tangentially relevant but useful for reference-class creation.  
5. Agent report (7 Feb 2026) – Synthetic but based on PACER/RECAP docket.  Core factual nuggets:  
   • Latest docket entry 2 Feb 2026 (discovery/summary-judgment motion).  
   • No ADR referral or sealed notice of settlement.  
   • Fact discovery still running; summary-judgment motion (Kentucky) awaiting decision.  
   • Case age 27 months.  
   • No public indication of mediation.  Source quality: medium (cannot inspect sealed items) but internally consistent and cites docket numbers.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential classes considered:  
1. Multistate AG consumer-protection suits against Big Tech (Google Play antitrust, Apple App Store, Facebook Cambridge Analytica, Google privacy, Juul e-cigarette youth harm).  
2. Single-state AG actions against Big Tech.  
3. Federal consumer class actions against Big Tech.  

Class 1 is most comparable: many plaintiffs, similar legal theories (consumer protection / youth harm), filed in federal court, very high stakes.  Sample (filing → settlement months):  
• Google Play Store – 29 m  
• Juul multistate – 30 m  
• Texas v Meta biometric – 24 m (single state but youth-privacy; keep as lower bound)  
• Facebook Cambridge Analytica – 57 m  
Mean ≈ 35 m; range 24-57 m.  Only 2/5 (40 %) settled by 30 m, 1/5 (20 %) by 27 m.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today to deadline = 23 days (~0.75 months).  Hazard-rate style view: if 40 % of similar cases have settled by 30 m, but only 20 % by 27 m, then incremental probability in the 27→30 m window ≈ 20 % over 3 months ≈ 6-7 % per month.  Absent any visible settlement posture, real-time hazard should be discounted further.  Court docket shows active litigation and no ADR referral – a condition usually present a few weeks before a public settlement in complex AG cases (e.g., Google Play ADR referral three weeks before the Sept 2023 announcement).  Hence the month-level hazard should be dropped well below its historic average.

(d) Justification  
Base rate from reference class: 6-7 % chance per month of settlement once a case has reached the 27-month mark.  
Adjustments:  
- Negative:  • No court-ordered mediation (-3 pp)  • Active discovery/summary-judgment briefing (-2 pp)  • Only 23 days left, not a full month (hazard × 0.75) (-1 pp)  
- Positive: • Meta facing simultaneous jury trial in L.A. that could raise settlement pressure across matters (+2 pp)  • Several co-defendants (Snap, TikTok) have recently shown willingness to settle quickly in adjacent litigation (+1 pp)  
- Neutral: • Case age right at the earliest part of the typical settlement window (no adjustment).  

Starting from 6.5 % then apply −3 −2 −1 +2 +1 = −3 pp → approx 3.5 %.  Round to nearest whole percent for clarity.

Outside view calibration:
There is no expert-survey number to tether to; the calibrated base-rate method above is therefore my anchor.  Historical variance in the class is large, so I apply a 30 % relative uncertainty band, yielding 2.5-4.5 %.  I choose the midpoint 3.5 % and round to 4 % to stateable granularity.  This preserves a small yet non-trivial tail for an eleventh-hour global deal driven by bad early trial headlines.

Outside View Prediction:
4 %
