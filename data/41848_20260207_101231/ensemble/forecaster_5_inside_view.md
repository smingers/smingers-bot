Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological order, all dates 2025-26)
1. Top Class Actions 30 Dec 2025 – AGs’ letter brief asking for a single joint trial. Pure procedural fact; reliable court-filing reportage. Shows sides still arguing about HOW to try, not IF to settle.
2. PACER docket pull (7 Feb 2026, internal memo) – Last substantive entry 2 Feb 2026 was summary-judgment briefing; no ADR docketed. Primary source, highest weight.
3. CNBC 24 Oct 2023 – original multistate filing; establishes coalition size (42 AGs) and core claims. Historic baseline.
4. CalMatters 30 Jan 2026; PBS 28 Jan 2026; other press (Jan-Feb 2026) – describe parallel private and state-court bell-wether trials (K.G.M.), recent Snap & TikTok settlements, and Meta’s decision to litigate. Good procedural facts; opinions from named law professors (Goldman, Lim, Franks) that Meta is “unlikely to settle soon” carry moderate expert weight.
5. Asknews batch 2-6 Feb 2026 – dozens of articles on K.G.M. and New Mexico trials; again underline Meta’s current fight-to-verdict stance. All mainstream outlets; high factual credibility for dates & posture, low weight for speculative commentary.

Distinction: none of the sources report any active settlement talks with the AG coalition; all settlement news concerns OTHER defendants (Snap, TikTok).

b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• PACER: no mediation order or stay; summary-judgment still in progress (structural, hard to change).
• Coalition size (42 AGs) makes coordination logistically slow; historical multistate tech settlements (Juul, Google Play) took ≥30 months.

Moderate evidence
• Meta’s willingness to fight bell-wether case while peers settled (indirect causal link to posture).
• Expert legal commentary (Goldman, Lim) calling near-term AG settlement “unlikely” once trial prep advanced.

Weak evidence (minor upward tug)
• Simultaneous jury trials (LA, New Mexico) increase reputational risk and could spark a rapid global deal under extreme pressure—even if probability small.

c) Timeframe analysis
Days until deadline: 23 (0.76 months).
Estimated monthly hazard of settlement for multistate tech cases once past 24 months ≈ 6 %. Applying to 0.76 months ⇒ ≈ 4.6 % baseline.
If window were doubled to 46 days, probability would roughly double to ~9 %. If halved to 11 days, falls to ~2-3 %.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Downward
– No ADR docket; parties still filing dispositive motions (-1 pp).
– Need “substantial majority” of 40+ AGs to sign—hard in 3 weeks (-1 pp).
– Meta currently choosing litigation over settlement in analogous youth-addiction suits (-0.5 pp).

Upward
+ Public-relations peril of concurrent jury trials with Mark Zuckerberg testifying could prod last-minute talks (+1 pp).

Net shift from 4.6 % ≈ +0.4 pp ⇒ 5 % rounded.

Consistency check: “About 5 out of 100 times, Meta would announce and execute such a multistate settlement in the next three weeks.” This aligns with historical pace and current signals.

Probability calibration
Outside-view base at 4 %. Inside-view evidence trims −1.5 pp and adds +2 pp ⇒ 5 % final.  A ±10 % absolute swing (to 15 % or -5 %) would require either public confirmation of active settlement negotiations (up) or a firm March trial date entering the docket (down).

Checklist:
1. Will Meta settle multistate AG addictive-design case before 1 Mar 2026?  
2. Base rate: ~6 %/mo hazard → 4 % over 0.76 mo.  
3. 5/100 times a qualifying settlement happens.  
4. Key evidence: (i) No ADR order; (ii) summary-judgment briefs filed 2 Feb 26; (iii) 42-state coalition; (iv) Meta fighting bell-wether trial; (v) concurrent jury trials raise reputational heat.  
5. Blind spot: secret negotiations already done, public announcement drops during trial recess. Would push probability far higher.  
6. Status-quo = continued litigation; momentum favours “no settlement”.

Probability: 5%
