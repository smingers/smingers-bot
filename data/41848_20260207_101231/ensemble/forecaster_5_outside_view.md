Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Al Jazeera (27 Jan 2026), ABC-7 (27 Jan 2026), Top Class Actions (29 Jan 2026) – All describe an individual bell-wether personal-injury trial (K.G.M.) in Los Angeles.  Factual value: confirms Meta is presently defending, not settling, comparable claims.  Opinion content is limited to lawyer sound-bites; no expert forecasts.  Quality: mainstream news; reliable for procedural facts.  Relevance to the AG suit: indirect signal that Meta’s global litigation stance is to fight rather than settle.

2. N.C. Dept. of Justice press release (16 Oct 2024) – Primary source; court order denying Meta’s motion to dismiss the multistate AG case.  Factual, high quality.

3. Skadden client memo (Mar 2025) – Secondary legal analysis citing the same order as #2.  Contains opinion but from specialised counsel; useful for broad enforcement trends.

4. Broadband Breakfast (31 Oct 2025) – Reports a $1.375 bn privacy settlement between Texas and Google.  Demonstrates that large tech settlements with a single (or few) states can be finalised 2-3 years after filing.  Quality: trade press quoting public documents; adequate.

5. Agent report (7 Feb 2026) – Synthesises the PACER docket in People v. Meta plus cross-case timelines.  Key factual nuggets:  
   • last docket entry 2 Feb 2026 (summary-judgment paperwork)  
   • no ADR referral, no stay, no public mediation statements  
   • suit age: 27 months  
   • comparison set (Juul, Google Play, Cambridge Analytica, etc.) and their filing-to-settlement intervals.  
   The PACER pull and timeline table can be independently verified; high evidentiary weight.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes considered:  
1. All U.S. civil cases (settle >90%).  Too broad; ignores size / public-policy stakes.  
2. Federal multistate AG actions against large tech platforms alleging consumer- or youth-harm (Juul, Google Play, TikTok investigations, Texas v. Meta biometric case).  Best match: similar defendant size, political salience, coalition dynamics, monetary scale.  
3. Private nationwide class actions against tech firms.  Somewhat useful but procedural incentives differ (no elected AGs, no injunctive demands from regulators).

Chosen reference class: recent multistate AG tech cases (n≈6 over 2019-2025).

Empirical filing-to-settlement span in that class  
• quickest: Juul global AG deal – ≈30 months  
• median: Google Play – ≈29-30 months  
• slower: Cambridge Analytica – ≈57 months  
• several still open at 15-28 months (TikTok, current Meta case)  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Remaining window to 1 Mar 2026 = 23 days (≈0.76 months).  
The case age today = 27.4 months.  In the reference class, the unconditional probability of “having settled” by 27.4 months is roughly 2 of 6 ≈ 33%.  Converting that to a monthly hazard rate for months 24-30:

P(settle during a given month | still pending at start of month) ≈  
  (Cumulative 33% – pre-24-month negligible) / 6 months ≈ 6% per month.  

Applying that 6 %/month hazard to a 0.76-month interval gives a baseline outside-view probability ≈ 0.06 × 0.76 ≈ 4.6%.

(d) Justification / outside-view adjustments  
Up-adjustments (+):  
• External pressure from the ongoing LA bell-wether trial could marginally raise Meta’s willingness to talk.  +0.5 pp  

Down-adjustments (–):  
• PACER shows no ADR referral or mediation schedule – unusual if a deal were close. –1.0 pp  
• Settlement must bind “a substantial majority” of 40+ AGs; coordinating that in 3 weeks is logistically hard. –1.0 pp  
• Meta has recently demonstrated a litigate-through-trial posture (refused to settle the bell-wether when TikTok and Snap did). –0.5 pp  

Net effect: base 4.6 % –1.0 % ≈ 3.6 % (round to nearest 1 %).

Outside view calibration:  
• Anchor: ~6 %/month hazard derived from the reference class.  
• Adjust for 0.76-month horizon → 4 – 5 %.  
• Qualitative signals (no mediation, coordination hurdle, Meta’s posture) pull slightly lower.  
• Final calibrated outside-view probability: 4 %.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 4 % chance that Meta reaches a qualifying settlement with the state attorneys general before 1 March 2026.
