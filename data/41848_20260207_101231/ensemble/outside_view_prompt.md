Question background:
[*Frances Haugen*](https://www.franceshaugen.com/) *provided this question for their talk "Shaping the Economics of Social Media" at Foresight Institute's* [*Vision Weekend 2025*](https://foresight.org/vw2025pr/)*.

In October 2023, a coalition of state attorneys general [filed lawsuits](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-files-lawsuit-against-meta-over-harms-youth-mental-health) against Meta (formerly Facebook), alleging that the company deliberately designed Instagram and Facebook features to promote compulsive use by young users, while being aware of potential harms to youth mental health.

[According to the American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/cases_settling/):

> Relatively few lawsuits ever go through the full range of procedures and all the way to trial. Most civil cases are settled by mutual agreement between the parties. A dispute can be settled even before a suit is filed. Once a suit is filed, it can be settled before the trial begins, during the trial, while the jury is deliberating, or even after a verdict is rendered.A settlement doesn’t usually state that anyone was right or wrong in the case, nor does it have to settle the whole case. Part of a dispute can be settled, with the remaining issues left to be resolved by the judge or jury.

For more information and background on settlements see: [A Comprehensive Theory of Civil Settlement](https://law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Paper%20March%2022%20-%20Prescott%20and%20Spier.pdf)

`{"format":"metac_closes_in_period","info":{"post_id":35320,"question_id":34790}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as **Yes** if, before March 1, 2026, Meta reaches a settlement in the [*People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc*](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67908468/the-people-of-the-state-of-california-v-meta-platforms-inc/), brought by a coalition of state attorneys general over allegations that Meta's platforms were designed to foster compulsive use by minors. The settlement must be formally announced and agreed to by both Meta and a substantial majority of the participating states to qualify.

To qualify as a settlement, the agreement must include formal resolution of the core allegations about platform design and youth addiction, with either monetary compensation, commitments to specific platform changes, or both. [Partial settlements](https://law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Paper%20March%2022%20-%20Prescott%20and%20Spier.pdf), for example award-modification agreements, issue-modification agreements, or procedure-modification agreements will generally not count, the core issue must be resolved.

# Summary of Article: "TikTok settles addiction lawsuit before trial against Meta, YouTube"

**Key Facts:**

1. **TikTok Settlement**: TikTok agreed to settle a landmark social media addiction lawsuit on the day trial was scheduled to start against Meta and YouTube. The settlement terms were not disclosed.

2. **Snap Settlement**: Snap also settled last week to avoid the trial. Terms were not disclosed.

3. **Trial Details**: 
   - Trial against Meta and YouTube was scheduled to begin with jury selection on Tuesday in California Superior Court in Los Angeles
   - Jury selection expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned daily through at least Thursday
   - Trial expected to last 6-8 weeks
   - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify

4. **Plaintiff Case**: 
   - The case involves a 19-year-old California resident identified as KGM
   - She claims she became addicted to the platforms at a young age due to attention-grabbing design
   - She blames her depression and suicidal thoughts on the apps

5. **Legal Arguments**: 
   - Lawsuit alleges companies "deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue"
   - Compares tactics to "behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry"
   - Experts draw parallels to Big Tobacco trials that led to 1998 settlement requiring billions in healthcare costs and marketing restrictions

6. **Defense Arguments**: Tech companies dispute claims, citing safeguards added over the years and arguing they're not liable for third-party content posted on their platforms

7. **Company Safety Efforts**: Since at least 2018, Meta has sponsored parent workshops on teen online safety at dozens of U.S. high schools; TikTok also sponsored similar gatherings

**Additional Context:**

- This is the first of several cases expected to go to trial this year centered on "social media addiction" among children
- France's lower house voted Monday to ban children under 15 from social media
- Australia became the first country in December to ban children under 16 from social media platforms
- UK, Denmark, Spain, and Greece are studying social media bans

**Note**: This article focuses on a different lawsuit than the one specified in the forecasting question (which concerns *People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.* brought by state attorneys general). This article describes an individual plaintiff case (KGM) against multiple social media companies.

# Summary of Article: "Meta, TikTok and YouTube face trial over youth mental health claims"

**Source:** Top Class Actions  
**Date:** January 29, 2026

## Key Facts:

1. **Trial Details:** Meta, TikTok, and YouTube are facing trial in Los Angeles over claims their platforms negatively impacted youth mental health. The trial began "this week" (relative to the January 29, 2026 article date).

2. **Plaintiffs:** The case was brought by a 19-year-old identified as K.G.M. and her mother.

3. **Allegations:** The companies are accused of designing addictive features that led to mental health issues in young users, including self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

4. **Significance:** This marks the first time these social media companies will testify before a jury regarding such claims.

5. **Broader Context:** The lawsuit is part of a larger multidistrict litigation involving approximately 1,500 personal injury cases against these social media companies. The outcome could influence more than 1,000 similar cases.

6. **Specific Claims about K.G.M.:** 
   - Began using social media at age 10
   - Platforms' addictive designs allegedly led to compulsive use and mental health decline
   - User recommendation features on Snapchat and Instagram allegedly connected her with strangers, including predatory adults

## Note:
This article describes a **different lawsuit** from the California AG coalition case mentioned in the forecasting question. This is an individual personal injury case, not the state attorneys general lawsuit.

**Date:** October 16, 2024

## Key Facts:

1. **Court Ruling:** A federal judge rejected Meta's attempt to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Attorney General Josh Stein and other bipartisan state attorneys general in 2023.

2. **Case Status:** United States District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that state attorneys general may proceed with many of their consumer protection claims.

3. **Core Allegations:** The lawsuit alleges that Meta:

   - Engaged in a "yearslong public campaign of deception as to the risks of addiction and mental harms to minors from platform use" (as stated in the judge's order)

## Opinions from Named Sources:

- **Attorney General Josh Stein** stated he is "pleased that the court saw through Meta's attempts to avoid being held responsible for the damage it has done to young people's health and wellbeing" and committed to "keep fighting to protect our kids and make sure that Meta does better by them."

# Summary of Skadden Article on State Attorneys General Enforcement

## Key Facts Relevant to the Meta Lawsuit Question:

**Meta Lawsuit Status:**
- A recent motion to dismiss by Meta was **generally denied** in a suit led by a coalition of state AGs focused on potential harm to youth
- The suit relies on various consumer protection, data privacy and unfair competition laws
- This is cited as an example showing these types of lawsuits "have gotten some traction"

## Broader Context on State AG Enforcement Trends:

**General Trends:**
- State AGs are increasingly adopting aggressive regulatory enforcement roles, particularly as federal priorities have shifted
- Key focus areas include: consumer protection and youth health, data privacy and cybersecurity, consumer financial services, AI, and securities fraud

**Consumer Protection Examples:**
- Massachusetts AG secured court order for three insurance companies to pay over $50 million in restitution and over $115 million in civil penalties (largest order under Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act)
- State AGs have wielded consumer protection laws to tackle emerging issues like social media's effect on children

**Data Privacy/Cybersecurity Examples:**
- California AG settled with Blackbaud for $6.75 million in penalties (June 2024) for data breach response failures
- Washington AG filed lawsuit against T-Mobile (January 2025) regarding 2021 data breach affecting 79 million people

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a detailed update on People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc., including latest docket entries, any court-ordered mediation, public statements about settlement talks, and compare timelines of prior multi-state AG tech settlements (Juul, Google Play, Cambridge Analytica, TikTok) highlighting filing-to-settlement durations.
People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (N.D. Cal. No. 4:23-cv-05448-YGR, member of MDL 3047)

1. Current posture and the very latest docket activity  
   •  The state-AG “youth-harm” complaint filed 24 Oct 2023 remains a stand-alone member case before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Northern District of California.  
   •  The public docket’s last visible entry is 2 Feb 2026, when Kentucky lodged a proposed order on its already-briefed motion for partial summary judgment limited to COPPA claims (ECF 254) (cand.uscourts.gov docket listing, 02-02-26) [9].  
   •  Since mid-2025 the docket has reflected:  
        – Numerous administrative motions to seal and related orders;  
        – A string of discovery disputes culminating in Meta’s unsuccessful bid to compel state agencies to produce documents, an order that the Ninth Circuit reversed on 22 Aug 2025 (In re Meta / No. 25-584) [3];  
        – Continued appearance filings for additional states;  
        – No dispositive rulings on immunity, pre-emption, or merits.  
   •  Scrutiny of the PACER/RECAP feed through 3 Feb 2026 shows no minute orders or clerk’s notices referring the parties to the court’s ADR programme, no stipulations to private mediation, and no stays predicated on settlement talks [1].

2. Court-ordered or voluntary settlement efforts  
   •  The docket contains neither a referral to a magistrate judge for a mandatory settlement conference nor an entry invoking the Northern District’s ADR Local Rules [1] [9].  
   •  Press monitoring likewise yields no statement by the California AG, the 32-state coalition, or Meta confirming mediation. The most recent public comments from AG offices about Meta concern unrelated bellwether personal-injury trials, not the federal AG action.  
   •  The absence of any ADR docket notation, coupled with active briefing on Kentucky’s summary-judgment motion and ongoing discovery skirmishes, supports the conclusion that no organised mediation is under way at this time.

3. Procedural events that could affect the negotiation climate  
   •  The Ninth Circuit’s August 2025 opinion narrowing Meta’s discovery reach into third-party state agencies removed a significant pre-trial irritant but did not order any settlement facilitation [3].  
   •  Judge Gonzalez Rogers customarily sets settlement conferences after key dispositive rulings; the forthcoming decision on Kentucky’s COPPA motion could therefore become an inflection point.

4. Comparative timelines—multistate technology settlements

   A. Juul e-cigarette marketing  
      •  34-state investigation opened Jan 2020; $438.5 m global settlement announced 7 Sep 2022 (Texas AG press release, previously retrieved).  
        Filing/investigation start → agreement: ~30 months.

   B. Google Play Store antitrust (Utah et al. v. Google)  
      •  Complaint filed 7 Jul 2021; tentative nationwide settlement disclosed 5 Sep 2023; public terms ($700 m) released 11 Dec 2023; preliminary approval entered 11 Dec 2023 (NAAG case summary) [8].  
        Filing → settlement announcement: 29 months.

   C. Facebook/Cambridge Analytica consumer class action  
      •  Complaints consolidated 2018; $725 m settlement announced 22 Dec 2022; final approval 2023.  
        Filing → settlement: ~57 months.

   D. Juul single-state exemplar (Minnesota)  
      •  Complaint Oct 2019; mid-trial settlement 17 Apr 2023.  
        Filing → settlement: 42 months.

   E. TikTok multistate AG litigation  
      •  First individual AG suits filed 8 Oct 2024 in 13 jurisdictions (NPR 08-Oct-24) [11]; multistate investigative subpoenas still being enforced as of 8 Oct 2024 (MN AG release) [10].  
        No settlement yet; clock at 16-17 months and running.

   F. People v. Meta (this case)  
      •  Filed 24 Oct 2023; as of Feb 2026 the action is 27 months old with no public settlement trajectory.

   Synthesis: Recent multistate AG matters against large tech companies have resolved in roughly 2½–3½ years once litigation is filed. People v. Meta sits at the very front edge of that historical window and, unlike Juul or Google Play at comparable points, shows no visible settlement posture.

5. Public context potentially influencing timing  
   •  Separate California state-court bellwether trials against Meta and others (JCCP 5255) began jury selection in late Jan 2026; companion defendants Snap and TikTok settled on the eve of trial, but Meta remained a defendant [4] [5]. Although distinct, outcomes there could recalibrate both parties’ risk assessments in the AG case.  
   •  The MDL school-district cases received a favourable indication from Judge Gonzalez Rogers at a Jan 2026 summary-judgment hearing that they will proceed to jury trial, further increasing Meta’s aggregate litigation exposure [4].

6. Key upcoming milestones in the AG case  
   •  Ruling on Kentucky’s partial summary-judgment motion (COPPA).  
   •  Completion of coordinated fact discovery in MDL 3047 (timeline not yet altered by any stay).  
   •  Possible post-summary-judgment scheduling conference where the court could for the first time order ADR.

7. Information gaps and recommended next steps  
   Gaps:  
   •  Full PACER docket (certain sealed entries or informal ADR communications may not appear on RECAP).  
   •  Meta’s SEC Form 10-K for FY 2025 (due Feb-Mar 2026) could disclose whether “substantive settlement discussions” are occurring; that filing is not yet available.  
   •  Any off-record mediator appointments would not surface absent party statements.

   Suggested follow-up research:  
   •  Pull most recent PACER docket sheet and text-search for “ADR”, “mediation”, “settlement conference”, “private mediator”, or “Magistrate”.  
   •  Monitor the California, New York, and Tennessee AG press-rooms weekly.  
   •  Scrutinise Meta’s next SEC periodic filing for loss-contingency language referring to “potential resolution efforts”.

Conclusion  
As of 7 Feb 2026, People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc. remains an actively litigated member case of MDL 3047 with no docketed ADR referral, no public acknowledgement of mediation, and no stay for settlement talks. The case is 27 months old—near the early edge of the 30- to 42-month window in which analogous multistate AG cases (Juul, Google Play) have historically resolved. Unless the court intervenes after ruling on the pending partial summary-judgment motion, or external pressure from parallel bellwether trials forces the parties’ hand, the matter appears poised to continue through intensive merits litigation rather than immediate settlement negotiations.</Agent_report>
