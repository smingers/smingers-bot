    "description": "[*Frances Haugen*](https://www.franceshaugen.com/) *provided this question for their talk \"Shaping the Economics of Social Media\" at Foresight Institute's* [*Vision Weekend 2025*](https://foresight.org/vw2025pr/)*. Learn more in the* [*Foresight Community*](https://www.metaculus.com/c/foresight/)*.*\n\n***\n\nIn October 2023, a coalition of state attorneys general [filed lawsuits](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-files-lawsuit-against-meta-over-harms-youth-mental-health) against Meta (formerly Facebook), alleging that the company deliberately designed Instagram and Facebook features to promote compulsive use by young users, while being aware of potential harms to youth mental health.\n\n[According to the American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/cases_settling/):\n\n> Relatively few lawsuits ever go through the full range of procedures and all the way to trial. Most civil cases are settled by mutual agreement between the parties. A dispute can be settled even before a suit is filed. Once a suit is filed, it can be settled before the trial begins, during the trial, while the jury is deliberating, or even after a verdict is rendered.A settlement doesn\u2019t usually state that anyone was right or wrong in the case, nor does it have to settle the whole case. Part of a dispute can be settled, with the remaining issues left to be resolved by the judge or jury.\n\nFor more information and background on settlements see: [A Comprehensive Theory of Civil Settlement](https://law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Paper%20March%2022%20-%20Prescott%20and%20Spier.pdf)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35320,\"question_id\":34790}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **Yes** if, before March 1, 2026, Meta reaches a settlement in the [*People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc*](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67908468/the-people-of-the-state-of-california-v-meta-platforms-inc/), brought by a coalition of state attorneys general over allegations that Meta's platforms were designed to foster compulsive use by minors. The settlement must be formally announced and agreed to by both Meta and a substantial majority of the participating states to qualify.\n\nTo qualify as a settlement, the agreement must include formal resolution of the core allegations about platform design and youth addiction, with either monetary compensation, commitments to specific platform changes, or both. [Partial settlements](https://law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Paper%20March%2022%20-%20Prescott%20and%20Spier.pdf), for example award-modification agreements, issue-modification agreements, or procedure-modification agreements will generally not count, the core issue must be resolved.",
    "fine_print": "The settlement must represent a comprehensive resolution with the main coalition of states. Individual settlements with small numbers of states will **not** result in the question resolving as **Yes** unless they are part of a broader agreement with the coalition. Preliminary or \"in principle\" agreements must be followed by formal settlement documents before the deadline to count for positive resolution.\n\nThe question immediately resolves as **Yes** once these criteria are met, it will be immaterial if the settlement is later voided or the case further litigated.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/35320) which opened on 2025-02-21 00:00:00. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.",
