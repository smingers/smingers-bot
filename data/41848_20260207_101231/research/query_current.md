Analysis:
We need the latest coverage on whether Meta (Facebook/Instagram) has reached a broad settlement with the coalition of U.S. state attorneys general in the youth-addiction design lawsuit filed October 2023. Key items to look for:
• Any joint press releases or court filings announcing a nationwide or “substantial majority” multistate settlement.
• Negotiation leaks indicating dollar figures or product-design concessions that would resolve the core addictive-design allegations.
• Statements from lead states (e.g., California, New York) or Meta’s investor relations updates referencing imminent or completed settlement.
• Conversely, reports of trial scheduling, procedural motions, or discovery fights would suggest no settlement yet.  

Current information through early February 2026 is needed; anything in 2024-25 that describes ongoing mediation or previous partial resolutions is also useful for trend analysis. The three searches below should surface up-to-date articles, official statements, and legal-industry commentary.
