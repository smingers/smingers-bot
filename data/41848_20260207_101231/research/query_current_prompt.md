In October 2023, a coalition of state attorneys general [filed lawsuits](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-files-lawsuit-against-meta-over-harms-youth-mental-health) against Meta (formerly Facebook), alleging that the company deliberately designed Instagram and Facebook features to promote compulsive use by young users, while being aware of potential harms to youth mental health.

[According to the American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/cases_settling/):

> Relatively few lawsuits ever go through the full range of procedures and all the way to trial. Most civil cases are settled by mutual agreement between the parties. A dispute can be settled even before a suit is filed. Once a suit is filed, it can be settled before the trial begins, during the trial, while the jury is deliberating, or even after a verdict is rendered.A settlement doesn’t usually state that anyone was right or wrong in the case, nor does it have to settle the whole case. Part of a dispute can be settled, with the remaining issues left to be resolved by the judge or jury.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as **Yes** if, before March 1, 2026, Meta reaches a settlement in the [*People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc*](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67908468/the-people-of-the-state-of-california-v-meta-platforms-inc/), brought by a coalition of state attorneys general over allegations that Meta's platforms were designed to foster compulsive use by minors. The settlement must be formally announced and agreed to by both Meta and a substantial majority of the participating states to qualify.

To qualify as a settlement, the agreement must include formal resolution of the core allegations about platform design and youth addiction, with either monetary compensation, commitments to specific platform changes, or both. [Partial settlements](https://law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Paper%20March%2022%20-%20Prescott%20and%20Spier.pdf), for example award-modification agreements, issue-modification agreements, or procedure-modification agreements will generally not count, the core issue must be resolved.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
