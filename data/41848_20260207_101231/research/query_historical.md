Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether Meta will settle before 1 Mar 2026 is understanding (a) the present procedural status of People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.; (b) any public indications of ongoing mediation or settlement negotiations; and (c) historical precedent—how long similar multi-state AG consumer-protection actions against large tech/consumer companies (e.g., Google, Apple, Juul, TikTok, Snap, Facebook-Cambridge Analytica) typically take to settle, and under what conditions. Locating authoritative docket updates, press releases, and commentary since late-2023 will give the immediate status, while reviewing analog cases will provide a base rate for settlement likelihood and timing.
