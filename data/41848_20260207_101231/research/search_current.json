The trial began \"this week\" (relative to the January 29, 2026 publication date).\n\n2. **Plaintiff:** The case was brought by a 19-year-old identified as K.G.M. and her mother.\n\n3. **Allegations:** The companies are accused of designing addictive features that led to mental health issues in young users, including self-harm and suicidal thoughts.\n\n4. **Significance:** This marks the first time these social media companies will testify before a jury regarding such claims.\n\n5. **Broader Context:** The lawsuit is part of a larger multidistrict litigation involving approximately 1,500 personal injury cases against these social media companies. The outcome could influence more than 1,000 similar cases.\n\n6. **Specific Claims:** \n   - K.G.M. began using social media at age 10\n   - Platforms' designs allegedly caused compulsive use and mental health decline\n   - Features on Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat allegedly encouraged harmful behaviors\n   - K.G.M. was allegedly connected with strangers, including predatory adults\n   - She experienced bullying and sextortion on Instagram that took weeks to address\n\n7. **Company Response:** The companies maintain they have implemented safety features. Meta claims it introduced \"teen accounts\" with default privacy protections and parental supervision tools; YouTube says it implemented similar restrictions.\n\n8. **Related Settlement:** Snap Inc. reached a settlement over Snapchat youth mental health claims just days before the scheduled trial (in the same case).\n\n## Note:\nThis article discusses a different lawsuit (an individual case by K.G.M.) than the specific state attorneys general lawsuit mentioned in the forecasting question (*People of the State of California v.

Settlement terms are confidential.\n\n2. **Case Details:** The plaintiff is a 20-year-old woman (identified as KGM) who alleges that platform algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health, including depression and eating disorders.\n\n3. **Other Settlements:** Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week.\n\n4. **Remaining Defendants:** Meta (which owns Instagram and Facebook) and Google (YouTube parent) remain as defendants in the trial.\n\n5. **Legal Shift:** The case marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms. The issue centers on design choices about algorithms, notifications, and features\u2014not third-party content protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n6. **Trial Significance:** This will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial for these types of allegations, according to the plaintiff's attorney Matthew Bergman.\n\n7. **Mark Zuckerberg to Testify:** Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg is due to testify early in the trial as a highly-anticipated witness.\n\n8. **Broader Context:** In 2024, dozens of US states sued Meta alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and contributed to a youth mental health crisis.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Matthew Bergman (KGM's attorney):** Described the algorithms as \"dangerous and addictive\" and stated companies will have to explain \"why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people.\"\n\n- **Eric Goldman (law professor, Santa Clara University):** Said losing these cases could pose an \"existential threat\" to social media companies, though it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.\n\n- **Mary Graw Leary (law professor, Catholic University of America):** Noted that internal company documents likely to be shielded from public view will be \"aired in court.\"\n\n- **Mary Anne Franks (law professor, George Washington University):** Stated tech executives \"are often not good under pressure\" and that \"the tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change.\"\n\n- **Meta (company statement):** \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"\n\n- **Mark Zuckerberg (2024 testimony to US senators):** Stated \"the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes.\"\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article discusses a **different case** (individual plaintiff KGM vs. multiple social media companies) from the question's focus (*People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc.* brought by state attorneys general). However, it provides useful context about the broader legal landscape facing Meta regarding youth addiction allegations and demonstrates ongoing legal pressure from multiple fronts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/single-trial-for-meta-social-media-addiction-lawsuit-proposed-by-19-ags/\">\n# Summary of Article: Single trial for Meta social media addiction lawsuit proposed by 19 AGs\n\n**Source:** Top Class Actions  \n**Date:** December 30, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Number of States Involved:** Attorneys general from 29 states are involved in the lawsuit against Meta Platforms.\n\n2. **Legal Proceeding Filed:** On December 12 (2025), the attorneys general filed a letter brief in California federal court proposing a single joint trial.\n\n3. **Nature of the Lawsuit:** This is described as \"a civil law enforcement action seeking penalties, injunctive relief and disgorgement of Meta's profits.\" Notably, damages are NOT being sought on behalf of any state, state agency, or individual.\n\n4. **Core Allegations:** The states claim Meta engaged in nationwide misconduct by designing its social media platforms in a way that harmed the mental and physical health of children.\n\n5. **Trial Structure Dispute:**\n   - The attorneys general are advocating for a single joint trial with a single presentation of evidence\n   - Meta has proposed multiple trials (the AGs reference Meta's proposal for \"more than a dozen separate trials\" and \"19 repetitive, serial trials\")\n   - The AGs argue their approach would be \"far and away the most efficient path forward\"\n\n6. **Arguments by Attorneys General:**\n   - A single trial would avoid unnecessary duplication of evidence and witnesses\n   - Would conserve resources and allow for more efficient resolution\n   - Meta has already benefited from pre-trial coordination\n   - Meta's multi-trial proposal would \"inject delay, uncertainty and massive inefficiency\"\n   - Severance into multiple trials would burden the court with \"years of continuous litigation\"\n   - They characterize Meta's approach as \"a transparent attempt to delay resolution through manufactured complexity\"\n\n7. **Case Information:**\n   - Case name: In re: People of the State of California, et al. v.

TikTok and Snapchat were also sued but have settled. Meta and Google deny any causal link between their platforms and addiction. This case is the first of potentially over a thousand similar claims, with a pending class action involving approximately 1,600 plaintiffs. Simultaneously, in Washington, a bipartisan effort is gaining momentum to reform Section 230, which currently protects social media companies from liability for user-generated content. John Yoo, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General and UC Berkeley law professor, discussed the high stakes for Big Tech amid mounting legal and political pressure on FOX Business Network.

(Snapchat)\u2014intentionally design platforms to exploit adolescents through psychologically manipulative algorithms and artificial intelligence, maximizing screen time and contributing to severe harms such as cyberbullying, obesity, eating disorders, sleep deprivation, and widespread life dissatisfaction. The lawsuit, originally filed over three years ago, claims these platforms 'bombard' students with notifications during school hours, undermining learning and student wellbeing. Ann Arbor School Board, along with Dexter Community Schools and roughly a dozen other Michigan districts, as well as the state of Michigan and Monroe and Oakland counties, are plaintiffs. The case is part of a broader wave of legal actions across the U.S., with related trials already underway in Los Angeles County Superior Court involving YouTube and Meta. A hearing on expert testimony and summary judgment is scheduled for April 15, 2026, with a jury trial set for June 15, 2026. Ann Arbor officials, including Trustee Susan Schmidt and President Torchio Feaster, argue that legal action is more effective than classroom bans in curbing harmful practices, citing the need to hold companies accountable by targeting their profits. Trustee Susan Baskett emphasized the constant, 24/7 nature of social media exposure, which she said intensifies anxiety and depression among youth. The move aligns with ongoing local efforts to ban cellphones in classrooms, with Michigan legislation on the topic awaiting Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s signature and expected to take effect by 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 09:32 PM\nSource:[mlive](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2026/02/ann-arbor-schools-join-federal-social-media-lawsuit-over-platforms-bombarding-teens.html)\n\n**EU Investigation: Is TikTok Officially Designed to Be Addictive?**\nThe European Union is investigating whether TikTok's design intentionally fosters addictive behavior, citing evidence that its features keep users engaged longer than they intend. The EU Commission argues that TikTok's algorithm-driven 'For You' feed, which automatically delivers content without user input, creates a compulsive scrolling habit by placing users in a mental 'autopilot' state. Despite TikTok offering a screen time limit (one hour for users aged 13\u201317) and a 'Family Pairing' tool for parental controls, the Commission deems these measures ineffective due to easily dismissible warnings and high technical barriers for parents. According to the 2025 JIM-Study, adolescents spend an average of nearly four hours per day on TikTok, with over a third using it multiple times daily. The EU's approach, guided by the Digital Services Act (DSA), focuses on regulatory intervention, contrasting with the U.S. legal strategy, where lawsuits have been filed against Meta and Alphabet for designing platforms to induce addiction. In the U.S., TikTok and Snapchat have settled, while litigation against Meta and YouTube continues. The EU demands fundamental changes to TikTok\u2019s core design\u2014such as limiting infinite scroll, enforcing stronger screen time breaks (including at night), and adjusting the recommendation algorithm. These changes would affect TikTok\u2019s business model, which relies on high engagement. TikTok denies the allegations, calling the EU\u2019s findings 'categorically false and entirely baseless,' and argues there is no unified scientific standard for regulating screen time, while highlighting its existing safeguards. Although TikTok will not be shut down, the platform may undergo significant changes in Europe, reducing compulsive use. The EU and U.S. share a growing consensus: the addictive potential of social media is no longer seen as a personal issue but as a corporate responsibility. If the Commission confirms its findings, TikTok could face fines of up to 6% of its global annual revenue\u2014potentially billions of euros.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:06 PM\nSource:[Westdeutscher Rundfunk](https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/tiktok-macht-suechtig-eu-kommission-prueft-massnahmen-100.html)\n\n**EU accuses TikTok of 'addictive design' that harms children, seeks changes to protect users**\nThe European Union's executive body, the European Commission, has issued preliminary charges against TikTok, accusing the platform of violating the bloc's Digital Services Act through 'addictive design' features that promote compulsive use, particularly among children and vulnerable adults. The two-year investigation found that TikTok's autoplay, infinite scroll, push notifications, and highly personalized recommender systems contribute to excessive screen time and pose risks to mental and physical health. Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier stated that TikTok's current safeguards\u2014such as time management tools and parental controls\u2014are ineffective, easy to bypass, and require excessive effort from parents. The commission demands structural changes, including disabling infinite scroll, implementing more effective screen time breaks (especially at night), and reforming the recommender system. TikTok denied the allegations, calling them 'categorically false and entirely meritless,' and vowed to challenge the findings through all available means. The company argues it offers tools like custom screen time limits, sleep reminders, and teen accounts with parental controls to enable 'intentional decisions' about usage. The EU has 170 million TikTok users in the bloc, with Regnier citing that 7% of children aged 12 to 15 spend four to five hours daily on the app, and it is the most used platform after midnight among teens aged 13 to 18. If TikTok fails to adequately respond, the EU may issue a non-compliance decision and impose fines of up to 6% of its global annual revenue. The final decision timeline remains unspecified. This case reflects broader global scrutiny, including Australia\u2019s ban on social media for under-16s and similar proposed measures in Spain, France, the UK, Denmark, Malaysia, and Egypt. In the U.S., TikTok recently settled a major social media addiction lawsuit, while Meta\u2019s Instagram and Google\u2019s YouTube remain under related legal pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 01:11 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-european-union-brussels-social-media-regulation-3b672b24f65611c7b248c55c5b153d7c)\n\n**Addictive design: EU targets TikTok over risks to minors from endless scrolling**\nOn February 6, 2026, the European Commission issued preliminary charges against TikTok, accusing the platform of violating the EU's Digital Services Act through 'addictive design' features such as autoplay and infinite scroll. The Commission found that TikTok has not adequately assessed how these features may harm the physical and mental health of minors and 'vulnerable adults.' The investigation concluded that TikTok's current design encourages compulsive use by continuously delivering personalized content, fails to detect excessive usage\u2014especially at night\u2014and lacks effective safeguards. The Commission demands changes including disabling infinite scroll, implementing stronger screen-time breaks (especially during nighttime), and reforming its highly personalized recommender system. TikTok rejected the findings as 'categorically false and entirely meritless,' stating it will challenge them through all available legal means. The company maintains it offers tools like custom screen time limits and sleep reminders that allow users to make 'intentional decisions' about their usage. If found non-compliant, TikTok could face fines up to 6% of its global annual revenue. This move follows global scrutiny: Australia has banned social media for under-16s, while Spain, France, and Denmark are considering similar laws; in the U.S., TikTok settled a major social media addiction lawsuit, and Meta\u2019s Instagram and Google\u2019s YouTube remain under similar legal pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 12:11 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/addictive-design-eu-targets-tiktok-over-risks-to-minors-from-endless-scrolling-2864272-2026-02-06)\n\n**Teen Mental Health: Zuckerberg Feared Legal Exposure For Meta\u2019s Social Media Impact Research**\nMark Zuckerberg sent a confidential email on September 15, 2021, to Meta\u2019s top leadership\u2014including Sheryl Sandberg and Nick Clegg\u2014expressing concern that internal research into social issues, particularly Instagram\u2019s negative impact on teen mental health, could increase legal liability. This came after the Wall Street Journal\u2019s September 14, 2021, report, based on whistleblower Frances Haugen\u2019s documents, revealed that Instagram worsened body image issues for 32% of teen girls. The email, unsealed in discovery for New Mexico\u2019s lawsuit against Meta, highlights a 'transparency paradox': while Meta publicly committed to transparency, documenting harms exposed the company to legal risk. Internal responses from executives like Javier Olivan and David Ginsberg supported continuing research despite leak risks, arguing that understanding platform impacts was the responsible course. Zuckerberg noted that competitors like Apple avoid scrutiny by not conducting similar research, creating a competitive disadvantage for Meta. The New Mexico lawsuit, with opening statements set for February 9, 2026, and expected to last seven weeks, alleges Meta knowingly designed teen-targeted features to maximize engagement while being aware of the resulting harms. In June 2024, courts denied Meta\u2019s attempt to invoke Section 230 and First Amendment protections, ruling that claims based on product design\u2014not content moderation\u2014can proceed. The case is part of a broader legal wave, with similar lawsuits pending in California. New Mexico\u2019s Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez emphasized that internal documents, including estimates of 100,000 children experiencing online sexual harassment daily on Facebook and Instagram, form a central part of the case. Operation MetaPhile, the investigation behind the lawsuit, led to the arrest of three men accused of preying on children via Meta platforms. Meta defends itself by highlighting built-in teen protections, parental controls, and over a decade of research and collaboration with experts. The company argues that documenting harms demonstrates responsibility, not negligence. The outcome of the trial may redefine whether internal research serves as a shield or a sword in future tech accountability cases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 11:15 AM\nSource:[Winbuzzer](https://winbuzzer.com/2026/02/06/zuckerberg-meta-research-teen-leaks-xcxwbn/)\n\n**EU Commission: TikTok Violates European Law with 'Addictive Design'**\nThe European Commission has concluded that TikTok's design violates the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) due to its 'addictive design,' which promotes compulsive usage. The platform's features\u2014including infinite scrolling, auto-playing videos, and a highly personalized recommendation system\u2014are cited as contributing factors. The Commission found that TikTok failed to adequately assess risks to users' physical and mental well-being, particularly among minors and vulnerable adults. It criticized TikTok's own risk assessment for overlooking key indicators of compulsive use, such as nighttime usage by minors and frequency of app opens. This follows a comprehensive DSA investigation launched in February 2024, involving analysis of internal data, documents, and expert consultations on addictive behavior. The Commission now demands TikTok modify its core design, proposing measures like enforced breaks during nighttime and adjustments to the recommendation algorithm. If the Commission's findings are upheld, TikTok could face fines of up to 6% of its global annual turnover. The case is part of a broader EU debate on social media regulation, with Spain proposing a ban on platforms for children under 16. Meanwhile, a similar legal challenge is underway in Los Angeles, where a young woman, K.G.M., alleges that social media platforms were intentionally designed to induce addiction, leading to depression and anxiety. While TikTok has settled its U.S. case out of court, Meta and Alphabet are facing trial. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen previously warned of algorithms exploiting children's vulnerabilities to create addiction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 11:14 AM\nSource:[tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/tiktok-untersuchung-eu-kommission-100.html)\n\n**TikTok charged for breaching EU rules with app's addictive features**\nTikTok was charged by the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) watchdog on February 6, 2026, for allegedly violating EU online content rules due to its addictive app design features, including infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and its highly personalized recommender system. The European Commission cited insufficient assessment of harms to users' physical and mental wellbeing, particularly children and vulnerable adults, and accused TikTok of failing to implement adequate screen time management and parental control tools. The Commission warned that TikTok must change its app design in Europe or face a fine of up to 6% of ByteDance\u2019s global turnover. The EU regulator specifically recommended disabling infinite scroll over time, implementing effective screen time breaks (including at night), and adapting the recommender system. TikTok rejected the charges as 'categorically false and entirely meritless' and stated it will challenge the findings. The move is part of the EU\u2019s broader crackdown on Big Tech, following previous DSA breaches charged against Meta Platforms (Facebook and Instagram) in October 2025. Other platforms like Snapchat, YouTube, Apple, and Google are under investigation for age verification and content safety measures. The EU\u2019s action reflects growing regulatory concern, mirrored by France, Spain, India, and Australia (which banned minors under 16 from TikTok, YouTube, and Meta platforms in December 2025). EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen emphasized that while age limits remain national decisions, a common approach across member states would be beneficial. EU lawmaker Alexandra Geese welcomed the move, condemning platforms for exploiting addictive mechanisms to boost ad revenue at the expense of youth health. TikTok has the right to review the Commission\u2019s documents and submit a written response before a final decision is issued. This follows TikTok\u2019s recent settlement of a social media addiction lawsuit and a prior DSA charge related to its advertisement repository.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 11:04 AM\nSource:[CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/tiktok-charged-breaching-eu-rules-apps-addictive-features-5912721)\n\n**Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat Face Historic Trial Over Alleged Addiction to Children**\nIn a historic legal development, Meta, TikTok, and Snap are facing trial in the United States for allegedly designing addictive social media products targeting minors. The case, centered on KGM, a California teenager who began using platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat at age eight and claims to have developed addiction leading to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, marks the first judicial proceeding of its kind. Plaintiffs argue that features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, recommendation algorithms, and beauty filters were intentionally designed to maximize user engagement and time spent on platforms, resulting in severe mental health harm. The lawsuit seeks both financial compensation and mandatory design changes to reduce harm to young users. Lead attorney Joseph VanZandt stated this case represents 'the starting point of our fight against social media,' aiming to establish new societal standards for how tech companies treat children. The case is part of a broader legal offensive with thousands of similar lawsuits filed by adolescents, school districts, and states. The strategy draws parallels to the 1998 tobacco litigation, which resulted in a $206 billion settlement. Defendants deny the products are addictive, citing lack of conclusive scientific evidence, and rely on Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, which shields platforms from liability for user-generated content. Meta claims lawsuits oversimplify complex mental health issues, pointing to academic pressure, socioeconomic challenges, and substance abuse as equally or more significant factors. Snap reached an out-of-court settlement with KGM prior to trial but remains named in other cases. The trial unfolds amid growing global scrutiny: France has set a minimum age of 15 for social media accounts, Australia banned access for users under 16, and several U.S. states have passed youth protection laws, though many have been blocked in court by tech companies citing free speech. The outcome could redefine the legal and ethical responsibilities of tech firms toward minors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:31 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/tecno/2026/02/03/meta-tiktok-y-snapchat-van-a-juicio-por-primera-vez-son-acusados-de-generar-adiccion-en-ninos/)\n\n**'The World's Largest Marketplace for Predators and Pedophiles': New Lawsuit Against Meta Accuses Platform of Failing to Protect Children from Sexual Abuse**\nOn February 2, 2026, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a high-stakes lawsuit began against Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), alleging the company prioritized user engagement and profit over child safety, enabling sexual exploitation of minors. The New Mexico Attorney General, Raul Torrez, accused Meta of knowingly allowing dangerous environments on its platforms, facilitating grooming, sexual extortion, human trafficking, and the distribution of child sexual abuse material. The case relies on internal documents revealing that Meta estimated around 100,000 minors experience sexual harassment daily on Facebook and Instagram, with internal discussions among users about targeting children. The lawsuit also highlights the 'Operation MetaPhile' arrests in 2024, where three men used undercover agents to solicit minors, and Meta failed to shut down suspect accounts\u2014even offering monetization tools. Mark Zuckerberg is implicated for authorizing AI chatbots for minors despite internal warnings about sexual risks, and for rejecting safety team recommendations. Meta denies the allegations, calling them 'sensationalist and off-topic,' and emphasizes over a decade of safety efforts, including default teen accounts and parental controls. The company\u2019s reliance on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the First Amendment failed in court, as a judge ruled the case focused on platform design and moderation decisions, not free speech. This trial follows a separate class-action lawsuit in Los Angeles involving 1,600 plaintiffs\u2014including 350 families and 250 school districts\u2014accusing Meta, Google (YouTube), Snapchat, and TikTok of designing addictive platforms harming children\u2019s mental health. While TikTok and Snapchat settled, Meta and YouTube chose to litigate. Experts like Sacha Haworth of the Tech Oversight Project call these cases 'a generation-defining moment,' akin to holding tobacco and pharmaceutical giants accountable. Concurrently, the FTC has launched an investigation into the risks of AI chatbots from companies including Meta, OpenAI, and Snapchat.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:15 PM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/actualites/reseaux-sociaux/le-plus-grand-marche-mondial-pour-les-predateurs-et-les-pedophiles-une-nouvelle-action-en-justice-contre-meta-accusee-de-ne-pas-avoir-assez-defendu-les-enfants-contre-les-abus-sexuels_AV-202602030529.html)\n\n**U.S. Child Social Media Addiction Case Delayed; Instagram, YouTube Prepare for Trial**\nA landmark trial in Los Angeles, California, originally scheduled to begin on February 2, 2026, has been postponed due to an unexpected medical issue involving one of the lawyers. The court has ordered the trial to resume on February 5, 2026, after the jury selection process was completed. The case, brought by a 19-year-old California woman identified as K.G.M., alleges that TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube deliberately designed their platforms to capture and addict children\u2019s attention. According to court filings, the plaintiff attributes her depression and suicidal thoughts to her use of these apps and seeks accountability from the companies that designed them. Snapchat and TikTok have already settled with the plaintiff; the remaining defendants are Meta (Instagram\u2019s parent company) and Alphabet (YouTube\u2019s parent company). The trial is highly significant as it may set a legal precedent on whether social media companies intentionally design platforms to addict minors. The case is considered a bellwether for hundreds of similar lawsuits across the U.S., which claim that social media use has led to depression, eating disorders, psychiatric hospitalizations, and suicide among young users.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:06 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/10511/9306522)\n\n**Massachusetts court hears lawsuit alleging Meta designed apps to be addictive to kids**\nMassachusetts\u2019 highest court heard oral arguments on February 3, 2026, in a 2024 lawsuit filed by Attorney General Andrea Campbell alleging that Meta deliberately designed addictive features on Facebook and Instagram to profit from young users. State Solicitor David Kravitz stated the claims are based solely on Meta\u2019s own research showing that features like endless scrolling and persistent notifications encourage platform addiction, not on algorithmic content moderation or false speech. Meta\u2019s attorney, Mark Mosier, argued the lawsuit violates the First Amendment, asserting that the company\u2019s actions constitute protected speech, especially since the content is truthful. However, judges expressed concern over Meta\u2019s design choices, particularly the use of incessant notifications to exploit teenagers\u2019 fear of missing out (FOMO), as highlighted by Justice Dalila Wendlandt. Justice Scott Kafker emphasized that Meta\u2019s focus is not on content but on capturing attention, regardless of whether the content is meaningful or trivial. The case is part of a broader legal challenge: in 2023, 33 states jointly sued Meta for collecting data from children under 13 without parental consent, violating federal law. Massachusetts has pursued additional state-level claims over addictive design and harms to youth mental health. Internal Meta studies cited by The Wall Street Journal in 2021 revealed that 13.5% of teen girls reported Instagram worsened suicidal thoughts and 17% said it worsened eating disorders. Critics, including former employee Arturo Bejar and four non-profits, argue Meta has not taken meaningful safety steps, instead promoting superficial tools like parent controls and 'Instagram Teen Accounts.' Meta denies these allegations, claiming the report misrepresents its safety efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[sfltimes.com](https://www.sfltimes.com/news/technology/massachusetts-court-hears-lawsuit-alleging-meta-designed-apps-to-be-addictive-to-kids)\n\n**The Battle For Child Safety, Meta Faces Landmark Trial**\nMeta (META), the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing a landmark jury trial in Santa Fe, New Mexico, beginning February 2, 2026, brought by New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez. The lawsuit alleges that Meta knowingly exposed children to serious harm\u2014including sexual abuse, solicitation, sextortion, and human trafficking\u2014by prioritizing user engagement and profits over child safety. Prosecutors plan to present evidence showing how Meta\u2019s internal decisions created a dangerous online environment for minors. Meta denies the allegations, asserting it has invested over a decade in collaboration with parents, experts, and law enforcement, and points to recent safety features like Teen Accounts and enhanced parental controls as proof of its commitment. The trial follows a 2023 investigation revealing Meta\u2019s difficulties in preventing child trafficking on its platforms and comes just days after a similar high-profile lawsuit in Los Angeles accusing major tech companies of harming children\u2019s mental health.

TikTok and Snapchat have settled the case, leaving Meta and Google (parent of YouTube) as the sole remaining defendants. Meta disputes the allegations, stating in a CBS News statement that it 'strongly disagrees' with the claims and is 'confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.'

The lawsuit, filed by New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez, stems from Operation MetaPhile, a 2023 undercover investigation in which state investigators created fake accounts posing as children under 14. These accounts were rapidly exposed to sexually explicit material and contacted by adults seeking illegal content involving minors, resulting in criminal charges against three individuals.

Meta denies the claims, calling them 'sensationalist' and arguing that the evidence is taken out of context. The company asserts it has invested over a decade in child safety initiatives and claims legal protection under the First Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Prosecutors plan to challenge this immunity by focusing on Meta\u2019s internal policies and design choices, including evidence from a 2021 whistleblower who reported that Meta knew about mental health risks to minors but failed to act.
