Meta Platforms, Inc., including latest docket entries, any court-ordered mediation, public statements about settlement talks, and compare timelines of prior multi-state AG tech settlements (Juul, Google Play, Cambridge Analytica, TikTok) highlighting filing-to-settlement durations.\nPeople of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (N.D. Cal. No. 4:23-cv-05448-YGR, member of MDL 3047)\n\n1. Current posture and the very latest docket activity  \n   \u2022  The state-AG \u201cyouth-harm\u201d complaint filed 24 Oct 2023 remains a stand-alone member case before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Northern District of California.  \n   \u2022  The public docket\u2019s last visible entry is 2 Feb 2026, when Kentucky lodged a proposed order on its already-briefed motion for partial summary judgment limited to COPPA claims (ECF 254) (cand.uscourts.gov docket listing, 02-02-26) [9].  \n   \u2022  Since mid-2025 the docket has reflected:  \n        \u2013 Numerous administrative motions to seal and related orders;  \n        \u2013 A string of discovery disputes culminating in Meta\u2019s unsuccessful bid to compel state agencies to produce documents, an order that the Ninth Circuit reversed on 22 Aug 2025 (In re Meta / No. 25-584) [3];  \n        \u2013 Continued appearance filings for additional states;  \n        \u2013 No dispositive rulings on immunity, pre-emption, or merits.  \n   \u2022  Scrutiny of the PACER/RECAP feed through 3 Feb 2026 shows no minute orders or clerk\u2019s notices referring the parties to the court\u2019s ADR programme, no stipulations to private mediation, and no stays predicated on settlement talks [1].\n\n2. Court-ordered or voluntary settlement efforts  \n   \u2022  The docket contains neither a referral to a magistrate judge for a mandatory settlement conference nor an entry invoking the Northern District\u2019s ADR Local Rules [1] [9].  \n   \u2022  Press monitoring likewise yields no statement by the California AG, the 32-state coalition, or Meta confirming mediation. The most recent public comments from AG offices about Meta concern unrelated bellwether personal-injury trials, not the federal AG action.  \n   \u2022  The absence of any ADR docket notation, coupled with active briefing on Kentucky\u2019s summary-judgment motion and ongoing discovery skirmishes, supports the conclusion that no organised mediation is under way at this time.\n\n3. Procedural events that could affect the negotiation climate  \n   \u2022  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s August 2025 opinion narrowing Meta\u2019s discovery reach into third-party state agencies removed a significant pre-trial irritant but did not order any settlement facilitation [3].  \n   \u2022  Judge Gonzalez Rogers customarily sets settlement conferences after key dispositive rulings; the forthcoming decision on Kentucky\u2019s COPPA motion could therefore become an inflection point.\n\n4. Comparative timelines\u2014multistate technology settlements\n\n   A. Juul e-cigarette marketing  \n      \u2022  34-state investigation opened Jan 2020; $438.5 m global settlement announced 7 Sep 2022 (Texas AG press release, previously retrieved).  \n        Filing/investigation start \u2192 agreement: ~30 months.\n\n   B. Google Play Store antitrust (Utah et al. v. Google)  \n      \u2022  Complaint filed 7 Jul 2021; tentative nationwide settlement disclosed 5 Sep 2023; public terms ($700 m) released 11 Dec 2023; preliminary approval entered 11 Dec 2023 (NAAG case summary) [8].  \n        Filing \u2192 settlement announcement: 29 months.\n\n   C. Facebook/Cambridge Analytica consumer class action  \n      \u2022  Complaints consolidated 2018; $725 m settlement announced 22 Dec 2022; final approval 2023.  \n        Filing \u2192 settlement: ~57 months.\n\n   D. Juul single-state exemplar (Minnesota)  \n      \u2022  Complaint Oct 2019; mid-trial settlement 17 Apr 2023.  \n        Filing \u2192 settlement: 42 months.\n\n   E. TikTok multistate AG litigation  \n      \u2022  First individual AG suits filed 8 Oct 2024 in 13 jurisdictions (NPR 08-Oct-24) [11]; multistate investigative subpoenas still being enforced as of 8 Oct 2024 (MN AG release) [10].  \n        No settlement yet; clock at 16-17 months and running.\n\n   F. People v. Meta (this case)  \n      \u2022  Filed 24 Oct 2023; as of Feb 2026 the action is 27 months old with no public settlement trajectory.\n\n   Synthesis: Recent multistate AG matters against large tech companies have resolved in roughly 2\u00bd\u20133\u00bd years once litigation is filed. People v. Meta sits at the very front edge of that historical window and, unlike Juul or Google Play at comparable points, shows no visible settlement posture.\n\n5. Public context potentially influencing timing  \n   \u2022  Separate California state-court bellwether trials against Meta and others (JCCP 5255) began jury selection in late Jan 2026; companion defendants Snap and TikTok settled on the eve of trial, but Meta remained a defendant [4] [5]. Although distinct, outcomes there could recalibrate both parties\u2019 risk assessments in the AG case.  \n   \u2022  The MDL school-district cases received a favourable indication from Judge Gonzalez Rogers at a Jan 2026 summary-judgment hearing that they will proceed to jury trial, further increasing Meta\u2019s aggregate litigation exposure [4].\n\n6. Key upcoming milestones in the AG case  \n   \u2022  Ruling on Kentucky\u2019s partial summary-judgment motion (COPPA).  \n   \u2022  Completion of coordinated fact discovery in MDL 3047 (timeline not yet altered by any stay).  \n   \u2022  Possible post-summary-judgment scheduling conference where the court could for the first time order ADR.\n\n7. Information gaps and recommended next steps  \n   Gaps:  \n   \u2022  Full PACER docket (certain sealed entries or informal ADR communications may not appear on RECAP).  \n   \u2022  Meta\u2019s SEC Form 10-K for FY 2025 (due Feb-Mar 2026) could disclose whether \u201csubstantive settlement discussions\u201d are occurring; that filing is not yet available.  \n   \u2022  Any off-record mediator appointments would not surface absent party statements.\n\n   Suggested follow-up research:  \n   \u2022  Pull most recent PACER docket sheet and text-search for \u201cADR\u201d, \u201cmediation\u201d, \u201csettlement conference\u201d, \u201cprivate mediator\u201d, or \u201cMagistrate\u201d.  \n   \u2022  Monitor the California, New York, and Tennessee AG press-rooms weekly.  \n   \u2022  Scrutinise Meta\u2019s next SEC periodic filing for loss-contingency language referring to \u201cpotential resolution efforts\u201d.\n\nConclusion  \nAs of 7 Feb 2026, People of the State of California v. Meta Platforms, Inc. remains an actively litigated member case of MDL 3047 with no docketed ADR referral, no public acknowledgement of mediation, and no stay for settlement talks. The case is 27 months old\u2014near the early edge of the 30- to 42-month window in which analogous multistate AG cases (Juul, Google Play) have historically resolved. Unless the court intervenes after ruling on the pending partial summary-judgment motion, or external pressure from parallel bellwether trials forces the parties\u2019 hand, the matter appears poised to continue through intensive merits litigation rather than immediate settlement negotiations.</Agent_report>\n"
