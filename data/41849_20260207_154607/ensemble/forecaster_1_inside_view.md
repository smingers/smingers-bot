## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (against March 15, 2026 filing):**
1. **Zero EDGAR activity** - Multiple sources confirm no public or confidential S-1 filing exists (Agent Report verification, Jan-Feb 2026)
2. **Recent CFO statement (Nov 6, 2025)** - "not pursuing near-term IPO" from Sarah Friar, just 3 months ago
3. **PBC restructuring timing (Oct 28, 2025)** - Only 102 days ago; SEC typically requires audited financials under new structure
4. **Consistent Q4 2026 or later timeline** - Multiple independent sources (Fortune, TokenRing, German source, Amazon report) all point to Q4 2026 at earliest

**Moderate Evidence (against March 15, 2026 filing):**
1. **Ongoing massive private fundraising** - $100B round in progress removes IPO urgency (NYT, Fortune)
2. **No banker mandate announcements** - Investment banks doing "informal" work only, not formal underwriting mandates
3. **CEO Altman's statements (Jan 10, 2026)** - "zero percent excited" about being public CEO, uncertainty about near-term timing
4. **CoreWeave precedent** - Even fast-tracked IPO took 25 days from S-1 to listing; we're 36 days from deadline with no S-1

**Weak Evidence (mixed signals):**
1. **Executive hires** - Ajmere Dale as CAO (Jan 2026) could signal preparation, but timing doesn't support March filing
2. **Nvidia investment interest** - Huang's willingness to invest in IPO is conditional and doesn't specify timing
3. **Market analyst activity** - Morgan Stanley/Goldman Sachs informal valuations suggest preliminary work, but not imminent filing

**Evidence Timeline Convergence:**
- All credible sources point to Q4 2026 or 2027
- No source suggests March 2026 filing
- Most recent management statements (Nov 2025-Jan 2026) indicate no near-term plans
- 36-day window is unprecedented for zero-to-S-1 filing at this scale

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current Prediction Timeframe:** 36 days (Feb 7 to Mar 15, 2026)

**If timeframe halved (18 days to Feb 25, 2026):**
- Probability would drop to ~0.5% - effectively impossible
- No company of OpenAI's scale could file S-1 with 18 days notice
- Even emergency filings require weeks of preparation

**If timeframe doubled (72 days to April 28, 2026):**
- Probability might increase to ~5-8%
- Still highly unlikely but enters realm of "possible surprise filing"
- Would require confidential S-1 preparation already underway
- 72 days is still extremely tight but not physically impossible

**Critical Inflection Points:**
- **Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun):** If timeframe extended to end of Q2, probability jumps to 15-25% as this aligns with "second half 2026" speculation
- **Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep):** Probability increases to 35-45% as preparation time becomes more realistic
- **Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec):** Probability reaches 50-65% based on multiple source convergence

**The 36-day window is the critical constraint** - all evidence suggests preparation is months away from filing readiness.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Strongly Arguing Against March 15 Filing:**

1. **Structural Impossibility (90% weight):**
   - No S-1 in EDGAR system as of Feb 7, 2026
   - Even confidential S-1s typically leak for companies of OpenAI's profile
   - 36 days insufficient for S-1 preparation from scratch
   - CoreWeave's 25-day S-1-to-IPO timeline still required completed S-1 filing

2. **Recent Management Statements (80% weight):**
   - CFO Friar (Nov 6, 2025): "not pursuing near-term IPO" - only 93 days ago
   - CEO Altman (Jan 10, 2026): uncertainty about near-term timing - only 28 days ago
   - No walking back or clarification of these statements
   - Corporate executives rarely make such definitive statements if filing imminent

3. **Consistent Source Timeline (75% weight):**
   - Reuters, WSJ, NYT, Fortune all point to Q4 2026 or later
   - Zero credible sources mention Q1 2026
   - "Second half 2026" earliest mentioned timeline
   - Market analysts (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs) doing informal, not formal, work

4. **Alternative Capital Access (60% weight):**
   - $100B private fundraising round in progress (NYT)
   - Successfully raised $40B in March 2025
   - No apparent liquidity pressure forcing accelerated IPO
   - Private markets still providing capital at premium valuations

**Why Outside View Should Hold:**

The reference class of "mega-cap tech companies filing S-1 within 36 days with zero public preparation signals" has effectively zero historical precedent. Even accounting for:
- Confidential filing possibility
- Strategic surprise element
- Accelerated timeline capability

The convergence of:
- No EDGAR activity
- Recent management denials
- Ongoing private fundraising
- Universal source agreement on Q4 2026+ timeline
- Insufficient preparation window

Creates an overwhelming case that March 15, 2026 filing is not happening.

**Counter-scenario Analysis:**

The ONLY pathway to "Yes" outcome requires:
1. Completely secret S-1 preparation (unprecedented at this scale)
2. Management actively misleading in Nov 2025-Jan 2026 statements (reputational suicide)
3. Abandoning typical IPO preparation timeline (fiduciary risk)
4. Filing despite incomplete readiness (regulatory risk)

This combination probability: <1%

## Probability Calibration

**Base Rate Anchoring:**
- Outside view base rate: 2%
- This reflected small allowance for unknown information

**Inside View Adjustments:**

**Negative Evidence (reduces probability):**
- Multiple Feb 2026 sources confirm Q4 2026 target: -0.5%
- Nvidia CEO conditional statement ("if OpenAI proceeds"): -0.3%
- Ongoing $100B private fundraising removes urgency: -0.2%
- No evidence of formal banker mandates: -0.3%

**Positive Evidence (increases probability):**
- Executive hires (CAO in Jan 2026) show preparation: +0.2%
- Multiple banks doing informal valuations: +0.1%
- Could theoretically surprise markets: +0.1%

**Net Adjustment:** -0.9%

**Calibrated Probability:** 2% - 0.9% = **1.1%**

Rounding to: **1%**

**Confidence Check:**
- 1 in 100 times, with these exact circumstances, a company files S-1 within 36 days
- This accounts for extreme tail risk (secret preparation, sudden strategic shift)
- Anything lower than 1% suggests impossibility; maintaining 1% acknowledges we cannot achieve perfect certainty
- 99:1 odds against feels appropriate given overwhelming evidence

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will OpenAI file public S-1 with SEC before March 15, 2026 (36 days)? Resolution requires non-confidential Form S-1 in EDGAR database.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view of 2% based on zero historical precedent for mega-cap tech filing S-1 within 36 days with no preparation signals. Inside view reduces to 1% based on additional Feb 2026 evidence confirming Q4 2026+ timeline.

3. **Consistency:** "1 out of 100 times, OpenAI files S-1 before March 15, 2026." This aligns with extreme tail risk acknowledgment while recognizing overwhelming evidence against.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - No EDGAR activity as of Feb 7, 2026 (verified fact)
   - CFO stated "not pursuing near-term IPO" Nov 6, 2025 (verified quote)
   - All credible sources point to Q4 2026 or later (Reuters, WSJ, NYT, Fortune consensus)
   - Only 36 days remain with zero public preparation signals (temporal constraint)
   - Ongoing $100B private fundraising removes IPO urgency (NYT reporting)

5. **Blind spot:** OpenAI has been preparing confidential S-1 for months in complete secrecy, planning surprise filing to preempt Anthropic. However, this would require unprecedented information control for a company under intense media scrutiny, and contradicts all recent management statements. Probability of this scenario: <2%.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is "no S-1 filing" - world changes slowly, especially corporate governance processes. 36-day window reinforces status quo bias. No volatility factors suggest sudden change.

Probability: 1%
