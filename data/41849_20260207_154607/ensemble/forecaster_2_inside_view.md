1. **Forgeglobal (6 Jan 2026)** - Reputable financial data provider. **Facts:** OpenAI valued at $500B in Oct 2025; Forge Price of $723/share ($499.92B valuation) as of 22 Dec 2025. **Opinion (Reuters-sourced):** "looking into filing for an IPO in second half of 2026" at up to $1T valuation. High-quality factual data on valuations; IPO timing is forward-looking speculation.

2. **Fortune (30 Jan 2026)** - Major business publication. **Facts:** OpenAI valued at $500B, raised ~$64B to date, not expecting profit until 2030, committed to $1.4T data center spending by 2033. **Opinion (WSJ-cited):** "racing toward Q4 2026 IPO," may want to beat Anthropic to market. Mix of hard financial facts and speculative timing from anonymous sources.

3. **TokenRing/FinancialContent (5 Feb 2026)** - Secondary financial news aggregator. **Facts:** Oct 28, 2025 PBC conversion completed; January 2026 hired Ajmere Dale as CAO. **Opinion (unnamed analysts):** "targeting Q4 2026" IPO at $1T; Morgan Stanley/Goldman Sachs "reportedly" began informal valuations. Lower reliability—mixes facts with unattributed speculation.

4. **CNBC (14 Jan 2026)** - Tier-1 financial news. **Fact:** Cerebras signed $10B+ deal with OpenAI. No direct IPO information for OpenAI itself. Tangential evidence of OpenAI's business momentum.

12. **OpenAI $100B fundraising (2 Feb 2026, NYT via Zaobao)** - **Facts:** OpenAI in talks with Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, SoftBank for up to $100B raise; current valuation ~$500B; generated $13B revenue in 2025. **Opinion:** "considering IPO as early as this year." High-quality factual reporting; IPO timing remains speculative.

**Evidence Quality Summary:**
- **Strong factual basis:** OpenAI completed PBC conversion (Oct 2025), hired finance executives (Jan 2026), raising massive capital, valued at $500B+
- **Weak evidence for March 15 filing:** All IPO timing claims are forward-looking opinions from anonymous sources or management statements suggesting "late 2026" or "2027"
- **Critical absence:** Zero evidence of S-1 draft filing, underwriter mandates announced, or SEC EDGAR activity

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence Against Filing by March 15:**
1. **No EDGAR filing detected** (as of 7 Feb 2026) - Multiple sources confirm absence of any S-1 on SEC database. This is dispositive negative evidence.
2. **All credible timelines point to H2 2026 or 2027** - Reuters (via multiple outlets), CFO Sarah Friar's stated "2027 target," WSJ reporting "Q4 2026." No source suggests Q1 2026.
3. **PBC audit requirements** - Agent report notes need for two years of audited PBC financials. Conversion completed Oct 28, 2025; insufficient time for required audits by March 15, 2026 (only 4.5 months).

**Moderate Evidence Against:**
1. **CEO Sam Altman's reluctance** - Direct quotes expressing lack of enthusiasm for being public company CEO suggests no rush to file.
2. **Ongoing fundraising** - Multiple reports of active $100B fundraising round; companies typically don't file S-1 while mid-fundraise as it complicates both processes.
3. **Historical precedent** - CoreWeave benchmark: 25 days from S-1 to IPO. To IPO by March 15 would require S-1 filing by ~Feb 18, leaving only 11 days from today—unprecedented without any public preparation signals.

**Weak Evidence For (tail risk factors):**
1. **Unprecedented capital needs** - $1.4T infrastructure commitment creates urgency for public market access.
2. **Competitive pressure from Anthropic** - Fortune/WSJ speculation about racing to market first.
3. **Strong market conditions** - Active IPO market in early 2026 (multiple filings observed).

**Weight Assessment:**
The strong negative evidence (no filing + timeline mismatch + audit requirements) vastly outweighs the weak positive factors. The moderate evidence reinforces the base case that filing by March 15 is highly unlikely.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Current timeframe:** 37 days until March 15, 2026 (from Feb 7, 2026)

**If halved to ~18 days:** Probability would approach ~0.5%. Virtually impossible—even emergency filings take weeks to prepare, and there's zero public indication of such urgency.

**If doubled to ~74 days (late April):** Probability would increase to ~8-12%. This enters the realm where a surprise filing becomes plausible if OpenAI accelerated plans and began confidential preparations in January. Still below base rate because audit requirements remain constraining.

**Critical path analysis:**
- For March 15 filing: OpenAI would need to have S-1 substantially complete NOW (Feb 7) to allow for SEC initial review, comment response, and final amendments. No evidence of this exists.
- Minimum realistic timeline from "starting S-1 preparation" to filing: 3-4 months for a company of this complexity
- We're 37 days out with no visible preparation

**(d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment:**

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 2.5% (established through mega-cap tech comparables)

**Adjustments:**

**Downward factors:**
1. **PBC audit constraint (×0.4 → 1.0%):** The Oct 2025 conversion creates a hard structural barrier. Unlike the outside view's generic "audit complexity," this is a specific legal requirement that cannot be circumvented. Two years of PBC audits physically cannot exist before Oct 2027.

2. **Complete absence of filing signals (×0.5 → 0.5%):** In the social media age with intense OpenAI scrutiny, the lack of ANY leaks about underwriter beauty contests, draft prospectus circulation, or employee communications is exceptionally strong negative evidence. Every comparable IPO had significant leakage 2-3 months prior.

3. **Management statements pointing to H2 2026+ (×0.6 → 0.3%):** CFO Friar's "targeting 2027" and Altman's reluctance are direct, attributable quotes from decision-makers, not speculation.

**Upward factors:**
1. **Unprecedented circumstances (×1.5 → 0.45%):** OpenAI's unique position, capital needs, and AI boom could theoretically enable a faster-than-historical process. However, SEC rules and audit requirements don't bend for urgency.

**Net adjustment:** 2.5% → 0.45%

However, this feels too precise given the tail-risk nature of the question. Rounding to account for "unknown unknowns" (e.g., confidential S-1 draft already filed that hasn't leaked, emergency board decision to accelerate): **~1%**

This represents roughly 1-in-100 odds—highly unlikely but not impossible given the extraordinary nature of OpenAI and the AI market moment.

---

**Probability Calibration:**

My 1% estimate means that in 100 parallel universes with identical information as of Feb 7, 2026, OpenAI files an S-1 by March 15 in approximately one of them.

**Calibration checks:**
- **90% → 10%:** Moving to 10% would require evidence of active S-1 preparation (underwriter mandates, draft leaks, employee communications). None exists.
- **1% → 0.1%:** Moving to 0.1% would require absolute certainty that filing is impossible. While audit requirements make it extremely unlikely, I cannot rule out creative legal structures or confidential processes I'm unaware of.

The 1% estimate appropriately captures:
- The overwhelming evidence against filing in 37 days
- A small tail for unknown preparations or emergency decisions
- Humility about information asymmetry (OpenAI could be further along than public information suggests)

**Consistency check:** "1 out of 100 times, OpenAI files an S-1 by March 15, 2026" aligns with the evidence showing this would be a shocking, unprecedented acceleration with no current supporting signals.

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will OpenAI file SEC Form S-1 (public IPO registration) before March 15, 2026 (37 days)? Resolves Yes if non-confidential S-1 appears on EDGAR by that date.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 2.5% for mega-cap tech filing within 37-day window once IPO rumors exist. Current circumstances (audit requirements, no filing signals, management timelines) justify strong downward adjustment to ~1%.

3. **Consistency:** "1 out of 100 times, OpenAI files an S-1 by March 15, 2026." This aligns with evidence showing extreme improbability but not impossibility.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - No S-1 on EDGAR as of Feb 7; all sources confirm absence
   - PBC conversion Oct 2025 creates audit barrier (need 2 years audited financials)
   - All credible sources (Reuters, WSJ, CFO Friar) point to H2 2026 or 2027
   - Zero leakage of underwriter selection, draft prospectus, or preparation activities
   - Only 37 days remain; historical minimum is ~60 days with advance signals

5. **Blind spot:** OpenAI filed confidential draft S-1 in December 2025/January 2026 that hasn't leaked, and plans to make it public in late February for early March effectiveness. This would be unprecedented for a company of this profile but is technically possible under JOBS Act provisions.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is "no filing." Given 37-day window, low volatility in this outcome. Market conditions could theoretically shift dramatically, but SEC process timelines are rigid. Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated in 1% estimate.

**Probability: 1%**
