Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance (Jan 10, 2026):**
High-quality financial news source. Contains direct quotes from Sam Altman on the "Big Technology Podcast" expressing ambivalence about going public ("0% excited to be a public company CEO"). Key factual information: Reuters reported in October that CFO Sarah Friar targets 2027 listing with possible IPO filing in late 2026. The article confirms no IPO has been filed as of its publication date. Altman's quotes are reliable primary source opinions from the CEO himself.

**Japan Times (Oct 30, 2025):**
Reputable international news outlet citing "three people familiar with the matter." Reports OpenAI considering filing "as soon as the second half of 2026" with CFO Sarah Friar targeting 2027 listing. Contains important caveat that "talks are early and plans could change." This is speculative reporting based on unnamed sources, though the consistency across outlets suggests legitimate sourcing.

**I10x.ai (Jan 30, 2026):**
Lower-tier source providing analysis rather than hard news. Claims OpenAI exploring IPO "by the end of the year" (2026) but acknowledges OpenAI has not officially confirmed plans. The article is primarily opinion/analysis about governance challenges rather than factual reporting on concrete IPO preparations.

**Motley Fool (Jan 18, 2026):**
Investment commentary site. Notes it's "less certain" OpenAI will go public in 2026 compared to SpaceX. Cites Wall Street Journal for potential $100 billion fundraising and valuations of $830 billion to $1 trillion. This is investment analysis rather than investigative reporting.

**The Guardian (Jan 22, 2026):**
High-quality news source. Reports OpenAI "could be valued at as much as $1 trillion" if it floats, citing Reuters. Contains expert opinion from Neil Wilson (Saxo Capital Markets analyst) but provides no specific timeline for S-1 filing. Contextualizes OpenAI among other potential 2026 "hectocorn" IPOs.

**Built In (Feb 4, 2026):**
Tech industry publication. Reports "no concrete IPO plans announced" and "sources say it could happen in late-2026 or 2027." Notes OpenAI hired Sarah Friar as CFO (veteran of Square and NextDoor IPOs) as preparation indicator. Sam Altman quoted as "zero percent excited" about running public company but acknowledges need for capital.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive synthesis of public information since 2024. Key findings:
- No Form S-1 (public or confidential) found in EDGAR or media reports
- Sarah Friar stated Nov 6, 2025: "not pursuing a near-term IPO"
- PBC structure finalized Oct 28, 2025 (very recent)
- Most aggressive timeline (WSJ/Mint, Jan 30, 2026) suggests Q4 2026 listing, implying mid-2026 S-1 at earliest
- No evidence of underwriter mandates or S-1 drafting sessions
- Company continues raising massive private capital, reducing IPO urgency

**Critical Factual Timeline:**
- Oct 28, 2025: Corporate restructuring to PBC completed
- Nov 6, 2025: CFO Friar explicitly states "not pursuing near-term IPO"
- Jan 10, 2026: Altman expresses personal reluctance about going public
- Today: Feb 7, 2026 (36 days until resolution date of Mar 15, 2026)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Large tech IPOs with extended preparation periods (Meta, Google, Airbnb):**
These typically take 12-18+ months from serious preparation to S-1 filing. Not suitable because OpenAI's CFO explicitly denied near-term IPO plans as recently as November 2025.

2. **Companies that filed S-1s within 4 months of corporate restructuring:**
Extremely rare. Most companies need 6-12+ months post-restructuring to prepare audited financials under new structure. OpenAI's PBC structure is only 3.5 months old.

3. **High-profile tech companies with speculative IPO rumors that did NOT materialize in predicted timeframes:**
Strong reference class. Many companies (Stripe, SpaceX historically, Databricks) have faced persistent IPO speculation that proved premature. The pattern: media reports "could IPO soon" → management remains non-committal → no filing occurs.

4. **Companies whose executives explicitly denied near-term IPO plans:**
Most relevant. When CFOs or CEOs publicly state they're "not pursuing" an IPO, filings within 4 months are exceptionally rare (perhaps <5% of cases).

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Companies whose senior executives explicitly denied near-term IPO plans (#4), combined with companies facing persistent speculative IPO rumors that didn't materialize (#3).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 36 days (Feb 7 to Mar 15, 2026)

**Key Temporal Constraints:**
- Only 3.5 months since PBC restructuring (Oct 28, 2025)
- Only 3 months since CFO's "not pursuing near-term IPO" statement (Nov 6, 2025)
- Only 4 weeks since Altman's "0% excited" comments (Jan 10, 2026)

**Historical Patterns:**
For mega-IPOs ($50B+ valuation), the typical timeline from serious preparation to S-1 filing is:
- Hire/empower CFO with IPO experience: 0-6 months before start
- Engage underwriters formally: 9-12 months before filing
- Begin S-1 drafting: 6-9 months before filing
- Complete audits under new structure: 3-6 months before filing
- File S-1: T-0

**Evidence of These Steps for OpenAI:**
- ✓ Hired experienced CFO (Sarah Friar, but she's denying near-term plans)
- ✗ No reported underwriter mandates
- ✗ No reported S-1 drafting activity
- ✗ No audited financials under new PBC structure (only 3.5 months old)
- ✗ No Form S-1 in EDGAR

## (d) Justification

The convergence of evidence strongly argues against an S-1 filing before March 15, 2026:

**Structural Barriers:**
1. The PBC restructuring was completed only on October 28, 2025 - just 3.5 months ago. Standard IPO practice requires at least two years of audited financials under the final corporate structure, or at minimum, audited stub-period financials that take months to prepare.

2. No evidence exists of the typical pre-IPO machinery: no reported underwriter mandates, no S-1 drafting leaks, no "testing the waters" activities, no analyst day preparations. For a company of OpenAI's profile, these would leak.

**Management Statements:**
3. CFO Sarah Friar's November 6, 2025 statement that OpenAI "is not pursuing a near-term IPO" is dispositive. This was 3 months ago, and "near-term" in IPO context typically means 6-12 months.

4. Sam Altman's January 10, 2026 comments expressing "0% excitement" about being a public company CEO, while acknowledging eventual capital needs, suggest psychological and strategic unreadiness.

**Market Dynamics:**
5. OpenAI continues raising massive private capital (reported negotiations for up to $100 billion more). Companies actively raising private capital at favorable terms rarely simultaneously pursue IPOs - there's no urgency.

6. The most aggressive public timeline (WSJ, January 30, 2026) suggests "considering" a Q4 2026 listing, which would imply an S-1 filing no earlier than mid-2026.

**Timing Math:**
7. With only 36 days until the resolution date, an S-1 filing would need to occur almost immediately. The complete absence of any preparatory signals makes this extraordinarily unlikely.

**Base Rate Consideration:**
Among companies whose CFOs explicitly stated "not pursuing near-term IPO" within the past 3-4 months, the probability of filing within 36 days is exceptionally low - likely under 2-3%.

Outside view calibration:

I need to calibrate a probability for an S-1 filing within the next 36 days given:

**Anchoring Points:**
- Agent report conclusion: "highly improbable" 
- Most aggressive media timeline: Q4 2026 (8+ months away)
- CFO's explicit denial of near-term plans: 3 months ago
- No evidence of typical pre-filing activities
- Only 3.5 months since corporate restructuring

**Calibration Considerations:**

The base rate for companies filing S-1s within 36 days when:
- CFO denied near-term plans 3 months prior: ~1-2%
- No underwriter mandates reported: ~2-3%
- Corporate restructuring only 3.5 months old: ~1-2%
- CEO expressed personal reluctance 4 weeks prior: ~3-5%

However, I must consider:
- Black swan possibility: Could OpenAI file confidentially without leaks? Technically possible but unprecedented for a company this high-profile
- Surprise factor: The question asks about filing before March 15, not completing an IPO, so the bar is lower
- Information asymmetry: Perhaps preparations are more advanced than public reporting suggests

**Counterbalancing factors:**
- OpenAI's extreme visibility means leaks are nearly certain
- SEC rules and audit requirements create hard barriers
- Management's own statements are recent and clear
- The 36-day window is extremely compressed

Given these factors, a reasonable calibration would place the probability in the 1-3% range. The evidence is overwhelming that this won't happen, but I cannot assign 0% given:
1. Theoretical possibility of a confidential filing we haven't detected
2. Possibility that "surprise" filings occasionally occur
3. Epistemic humility about unknown information

I'll calibrate at 2% - acknowledging this is extremely unlikely while avoiding overconfidence.
