Analysis:
### 1) Restate question / resolution criteria (make sure no bait-and-switch)
Resolves **Yes** if **OpenAI (or a ChatGPT-related subsidiary)** files a **public, non-confidential Form S‑1** on **SEC EDGAR** with a **filing date before March 15, 2026**. (Confidential draft submissions do **not** count.)

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)
**Forgeglobal (Jan 6, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** Secondary market/IPO-candidate roundup; moderately credible; cites Reuters.  
- **Facts:** OpenAI secondary-sale valuation references (~$500B) and claims Reuters reported “second half of 2026” filing exploration.  
- **Opinion/speculation:** IPO candidacy framing; not a primary IPO-process source.  
- **Relevance:** Points to *2H 2026*, not the next ~5 weeks.

**Fortune (Jan 30, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** High-profile business outlet; often synthesizes WSJ/other reporting.  
- **Facts (reported):** “informal talks with Wall Street banks,” finance hiring, “racing toward Q4 2026 IPO,” not profitable until 2030, large fundraising.  
- **Opinion:** “would test investor tolerance,” narrative around AI bubble.  
- **Relevance:** Suggests genuine prep—but timeline is *late 2026*, making a public S‑1 before Mar 15, 2026 unlikely.

**FinancialContent / TokenRing AI (Feb 5, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** Lower-tier aggregation feel; some claims likely recycled.  
- **Facts (some checkable, some not):** Mentions PBC transition, executive hires; but needs corroboration.  
- **Opinion/speculation:** Morgan Stanley/Goldman “informal valuations,” broad claims.  
- **Relevance:** Again points to *Q4 2026*.

**Investing.com Deutsch citing The Information (Feb 5, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** The Information is generally strong; this is a translation/relay, so one step removed.  
- **Facts (reported):** enterprise hiring push; “preparing for IPO by end of 2026.”  
- **Relevance:** Supports that an IPO is being prepared, but not imminent in the next 37 days.

**Zaobao (Chinese) summary of NYT sources (Feb 2, 2026)**  
- **Quality/date:** NYT is high quality; this is a translated summary, so treat as **moderate** unless directly verified.  
- **Facts (reported):** negotiations for up to $100B; “considering an IPO as early as this year.”  
- **Relevance:** “As early as this year” is vague; could still mean late 2026.

**Anue/鉅亨 (Feb 3–4, 2026) reporting Nvidia CEO comments**  
- **Quality/date:** Regional financial media; primary content is allegedly from CNBC interview.  
- **Facts:** Nvidia CEO willing to invest “if” IPO proceeds.  
- **Opinion:** “once-in-a-century company.”  
- **Relevance:** Confirms market expectation, not a filing timeline; does not imply a public S‑1 in weeks.

**Other Asknews items (Klarna lawsuit notices, SPAC IPOs, Liberty Defense F‑1, Swarmer S‑1, etc.)**  
- **Quality/date:** Mostly unrelated exemplars of filings.  
- **Relevance:** Useful only as background that S‑1s occur frequently; not about OpenAI.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (big weight):**
1. **Time window is only ~37 days** (Feb 7 → Mar 15). For a mega-IPO, a **public** S‑1 appearing with no prior visible “public-step” indications is structurally unlikely.  
2. **Multiple sources converge on late-2026 timing** (Fortune/WSJ framing; Reuters via Forge; The Information relay): consistent direction = *not Q1 2026*.

**Moderate evidence:**
3. Reports of **informal bank talks + finance/accounting hires** are consistent with IPO preparation, but this is equally consistent with **2026–2027** filing cadence, not “in the next month.”  
4. OpenAI pursuing/closing **very large private fundraising** tends to *reduce* urgency to rush a public S‑1 immediately (though it does not eliminate IPO plans).

**Weak evidence (small weight):**
5. “Considering IPO as early as this year” (NYT via translation) is ambiguous; could mean anytime in 2026 and could refer to **confidential** steps, which don’t satisfy criteria.

**Key mechanical point:** even if OpenAI is far along, many issuers first do a **confidential draft registration statement**; this question requires a **public, non-confidential S‑1**, which typically occurs closer to an actual marketing process. That sharply lowers probability within 37 days.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** ~**37 days**.  
- **If timeframe were halved (~18 days):** probability would drop materially (there’s even less chance of a sudden decision + immediate public filing), roughly to ~0.4–0.6%.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (~74 days, to late April 2026):** probability would rise, but modestly, because most credible timelines still cluster around **2H 2026**; maybe ~1.5–2.5% in that doubled window.

### (d) Justification: how inside-view updates the 2% outside view
My outside-view base rate was **2%** for a public S‑1 filing within 36 days, driven by (i) compressed time, (ii) recent restructuring, and (iii) lack of concrete filing signals.

**What changed with the new information?**  
- The new reporting strengthens that OpenAI is **planning/preparing** for an IPO (informal bank talks, staffing up, competitive rationale vs Anthropic). That would normally push probabilities **up** for “IPO eventually” questions.  
- But the resolution is **not** “IPO in 2026” or “confidentially submit draft.” It is the very specific event of a **public** S‑1 filed **before Mar 15, 2026**. The same sources that increase confidence in IPO intent also anchor timing to **Q4 2026 / 2H 2026**—which pushes probability **down** for *this* near-term filing window.

Net effect: I move **slightly down** from 2% to **~1%**, because the inside-view information reduces the plausibility of a “surprise immediate public filing” (it increasingly looks like a conventional late-2026 process).

Probability calibration
- **Outside view (given):** 2%  
- **Inside-view adjustment:**
  - (+) Evidence of IPO preparation exists (bank talks, hires): +0.5 pp
  - (--) Timing repeatedly framed as **late 2026** / **2H 2026** and public S‑1 usually closer to launch: −1.5 pp  
- **Inside-view forecast:** **1%**

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Public, non-confidential **OpenAI (or ChatGPT sub) S‑1** on EDGAR **before Mar 15, 2026**.
2. **Outside view base rate:** 2%.
3. **Consistency line:** **1 out of 100** times, OpenAI files a **public S‑1** on EDGAR before **Mar 15, 2026**.
4. **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - Only **~37 days** remain.
   - Multiple reports indicate **Q4 2026 / 2H 2026** IPO trajectory.
   - Public (non-confidential) S‑1 is typically a **later** step than confidential drafting.
   - Ongoing mega **private fundraising** reduces need to rush public filing.
5. **Blind spot:** OpenAI may already be S‑1-ready and choose an **unexpected immediate public filing** (e.g., to preempt competitors or capitalize on hot markets), with little warning.
6. **Status quo:** No EDGAR public S‑1 yet; most likely status quo is **no filing** in this short window.

Probability: 1%
