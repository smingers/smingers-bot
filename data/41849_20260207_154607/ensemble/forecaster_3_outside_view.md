Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, and how much weight to give it)

1) **Yahoo Finance (Jan 10, 2026)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Direct, on-the-record quotes from Sam Altman expressing strong personal reluctance about being a public-company CEO; he says he doesn’t know if OpenAI would go public “in the near term.” Repeats prior reporting that CFO Sarah Friar was targeting a **2027** listing and a possible filing in **late 2026**.  
- **Quality/weight:** **High** for Altman’s quotes (primary source). **Moderate** for the timeline (it’s secondhand reporting of Reuters/WSJ-type claims). Overall, this is the best single source for management posture.

2) **Japan Times / Reuters-style reporting (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** “People familiar with the matter” say OpenAI is laying groundwork; possible filing **as soon as 2H 2026**; CFO allegedly targeting **2027 listing**.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate-high**. Reuters-style sourcing is usually reliable, but this is still **anonymous-source** and explicitly framed as early talks and contingent plans.

3) **I10x.ai (Jan 30, 2026)**  
- **What it provides:** Mostly **analysis/opinion** on governance challenges and what an S-1 would reveal; mentions “reports” of IPO as early as end of 2026 without adding verifiable new facts.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Low** for timing; useful only as a reminder that governance disclosures are non-trivial.

4) **Motley Fool (Jan 18, 2026)**  
- **What it provides:** General investing commentary; repeats widely-circulating claims about OpenAI possibly going public, but not based on primary reporting.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Low** on this question (timing/SEC filing).

5) **The Guardian (Jan 22, 2026)**  
- **What it provides:** Broad “hectocorn” IPO context; no concrete filing timeline.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Low-moderate** for market context; minimal for the specific S-1-before-Mar-15 question.

6) **Built In (Feb 4, 2026)**  
- **What it provides:** IPO watchlist framing; repeats “late-2026 or 2027” type window; adds some speculative assertions (e.g., “circular financing deals”) without clear substantiation.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Low-moderate**; helpful as a compilation, not as evidence.

7) **Agent report (compiled, date not specified but presented with this question)**  
- **What it provides (key factual claim):** No trace of an OpenAI S-1 on EDGAR; no credible reports of underwriter mandates; highlights governance restructure milestones and reiterates the “2H 2026 / 2027” narrative.  
- **Quality/weight:** **Moderate**. It’s a synthesis and should be treated cautiously, but the “no public S-1 on EDGAR” point is directly relevant and (in principle) verifiable.

**Net from sources:** The *modal* external timeline in credible reporting is **late 2026 filing / 2027 listing**, and there is **no public S-1** yet. Most other sources add noise rather than signal.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

To forecast “public, non-confidential S-1 filed in the next ~5 weeks,” the best reference classes are about *how often large private companies file public S-1s on short horizons*, not about whether OpenAI eventually IPOs.

**Reference class 1: Large VC/private tech companies planning a traditional U.S. IPO**  
- Typical pattern in the last decade: companies **often submit confidentially first**, then later “publicly file” closer to roadshow.  
- Public S-1 tends to appear **weeks (often ~3–8 weeks)** before pricing/roadshow, but **after** substantial preparatory signaling (auditors, underwriters, reporting).

**Reference class 2: Mega-IPO candidates ($50B+ “headline” offerings)**  
- These usually generate **heavy press leakage**: bank syndicate, auditor readiness, governance cleanup, and timeline chatter become public well before a public S-1.  
- A surprise public S-1 with *no* credible prior leakage is **rare**.

**Reference class 3: “Random 37-day window” for a specific private company to file a public S-1**  
- Even for IPO-ready firms, the probability mass is concentrated around particular windows (after audited year-end, after confidential S-1 rounds, after underwriters are engaged).  
- For a company not already widely reported as being in an active filing process, the base rate over any given 5-week window is **very low**.

**Most suitable reference class:** #2 + #3 combined (mega-IPO candidate + short resolution window). This question is dominated by the **short timeframe** and the **public** (not confidential) requirement.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Now:** 2026-02-07  
- **Deadline:** before **2026-03-15**  
- **Time left:** ~**37 days** (~5.3 weeks)

Key outside-view implication: for a public S-1 to appear within 37 days, the firm is typically **already deep** into IPO prep (audited statements packaged, risk factors drafted, underwriter/legal process advanced). For a mega-IPO, you’d also expect **credible, specific leakage** (lead-left bank, targeted quarter, etc.) shortly beforehand.

Even if OpenAI had submitted a **confidential** draft earlier (which would not resolve this question), converting that into a **public** S-1 by mid-March would still usually coincide with more concrete public breadcrumbs than we currently see in the provided context.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)

Start with the “random-window” base rate: for even IPO-eligible private companies, a **public S-1 filing** is not a frequent event; the odds it happens in a specific **37-day** window are small. For **mega-IPO** names, it’s even less likely to occur without stronger and more specific pre-signals.

Then incorporate the minimal contextual constraints that are consistent with an outside view:
- The most credible timeline reporting clustered around **2H 2026** for filing and **2027** for listing (Yahoo Finance repeating Reuters-style reporting; Japan Times/Reuters-style piece). Even allowing for schedule acceleration, jumping from “2H 2026 / 2027” to “public S-1 by mid-March 2026” is a **large left-shift**.
- No evidence in the provided material suggests OpenAI is currently in the final steps that typically precede a public S-1 (e.g., named bank syndicate, imminent roadshow window, etc.).
- OpenAI’s ability to raise enormous private capital (noted across the summaries) reduces the base-rate pressure to rush a public filing on a 5-week horizon.

**Outside-view takeaway:** In the next 37 days, the base rate for a mega private tech company to file a *public* S-1—absent strong “active filing” signals—is **very low**, likely in the **low single digits** or below.

Outside view calibration:

- A tetherable anchor from the sources is the repeated claim: **possible filing in 2H 2026** (and listing in 2027). If one took that at face value, probability before **Mar 15, 2026** would be close to **~0%**.  
- But outside-view calibration should allow for: (i) reporting error, (ii) strategic accelerations, (iii) occasional surprise filings. Those effects prevent a literal 0%.
- Given the extremely short window (37 days) and the “public S-1” requirement (not just confidential submission), I put the true probability in the **~1–3%** band.

Outside View Prediction:
**2%**
