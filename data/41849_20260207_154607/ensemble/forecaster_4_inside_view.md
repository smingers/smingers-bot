Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most-to-least relevant)

1. Reuters‐style report (Oct 30 2025, Japan Times) – Says CFO Sarah Friar targets 2027 listing; filing could come “2H 2026.” Anonymous but from a Tier-1 wire. Factual signal: medium-high. Opinion: minimal.

2. Yahoo Finance interview (Jan 10 2026) – Direct quotes from Sam Altman: dislikes being a public-company CEO; claims no near-term IPO decision. Primary, high quality.

3. Fortune (Jan 30 2026) – Cites Wall St bankers: IPO race for Q4 2026; OpenAI still unprofitable. Factual signal: medium; opinion: analysis by journalists.

4. TokenRing / FinancialContent (Feb 05 2026) – Reiterates Q4 2026 target; notes recent accounting-team hires. Factual hiring data: medium; timeline claims sourced to “reports,” hence weak-to-medium.

5. Forge Global (Jan 06 2026) – Lists OpenAI as “2026 candidate,” repeats Reuters timeline. Medium quality.

6. Investing.com Deutsch (Feb 05 2026) – Mentions “IPO by end-2026” citing The Information. Weak-to-medium.

7. AskNews scrape of EDGAR (implicit Feb 07 2026) – Confirms no public S-1 visible. Direct factual observation. Strong quality.

8. Misc. market commentary (Business Insider, Horizons.at, Nvidia interviews, etc.) – Provide colour on funding needs but no specific filing evidence. Weak for timing.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
• No public S-1 on EDGAR as of 07 Feb 2026 (structural, easily verified).
• Multiple independent reputable outlets (Reuters, Fortune, TokenRing) converge on “late-2026 filing / 2027 listing” narrative.

Moderate evidence
• OpenAI continues to raise very large private rounds (>$100 B) – lowers urgency to file imminently.
• Recent senior finance/accounting hires – show IPO preparation momentum but do not pin the next 5 weeks.

Weak evidence
• Speculative commentary that OpenAI might “rush to beat Anthropic.”
• General 2026 IPO boom context.

Net evidence weight: strongly against a public S-1 before 15 Mar 2026.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Time until resolution: 37 days.
• IPO processes for mega-caps typically show ≥6-8 weeks between public S-1 and pricing; heavy press leakage precedes filing.
• Halving the window to 18 days would drop probability roughly to 1%; doubling it to 74 days (mid-April) might raise probability to ~5%—still low because credible reporting places the event in 2H 2026.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from 2 % outside rate)

Drivers downward
1. Convergent reputable reporting on later timeline (strong evidence).
2. Lack of prerequisite public breadcrumbs (lead banks, road-show chatter) this close to deadline (historical pattern).

Drivers upward
1. Possibility of an already-submitted confidential draft that could be “flipped” to public quickly if board decides (moderate).
2. War-chest needs for multi-trillion infrastructure commitments (weak-to-moderate).

After weighing, the downward factors dominate; I trim the probability slightly, but keep a small tail for a surprise acceleration scenario.

Probability calibration

Final inside-view estimate: 3 %  
(≈3 chances in 100 that OpenAI publicly files Form S-1 on or before 14 Mar 2026 23:59 ET.)

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will OpenAI publicly file Form S-1 before 15 Mar 2026?”  
2. Base rate previously set at 2 %.  
3. Consistency – “3 out of 100 times, a public S-1 appears within 37 days.”  
4. Key evidence: a) no S-1 on EDGAR, b) multiple sources say filing in late-2026+, c) Altman’s reluctance, d) new finance hires (weak upward), e) large private funding options.  
5. Blind spot – Board could approve abrupt spin-out of ChatGPT subsidiary with rapid filing. Would raise odds to perhaps 20 %.  
6. Status quo – No filing; reinforce lean to “No.”

Probability: 3%
