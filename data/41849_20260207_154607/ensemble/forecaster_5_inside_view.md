Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Forgeglobal (6 Jan 26, cites Reuters): factual recap of October-25 share sale and Reuters leak that management “looking into” filing in 2H 26; quality: moderate, named second-hand sourcing, no fresh scoop.  
2. Fortune (30 Jan 26): quotes Wall St bankers, HSBC model, says OpenAI “racing toward a Q4 2026 IPO”; quality: high-moderate, mainstream business outlet, clearly separates facts from opinion.  
3. FinancialContent/TokenRing (5 Feb 26): repeats Q4 26 target, notes recent CFO/CAO hires; quality: moderate, lightly sourced; useful as sentiment gauge.  
4. Investing.com (German ed., 5 Feb 26): The Information leak that hundreds are being hired for enterprise push and a “2026 year-end IPO”; quality: moderate; single unidentified source.  
5. CNBC, Business Insider, other AskNews excerpts: cover OpenAI funding plans, Nvidia/Amazon interest, none mention anything earlier than late 2026.  
6. JD Supra piece on SEC backlog (17 Nov 25): strong, specialised legal commentary confirming current 900-filing queue.

Across all, every identifiable source that speaks to timing places the public filing in the back half of 2026 or later; no article reports a draft S-1 under active SEC review or a near-term filing date.

b) Evidence analysis (relative to a Yes outcome before 15 Mar 26)
Strong evidence against Yes:  
• Multiple independent mainstream outlets (Reuters, WSJ, Fortune, CNBC) converge on “late-2026/2027” timetable.  
• Historical pattern—mega-cap tech IPOs always leak at least three months before the S-1 drops.  
• Structural: just-completed nonprofit-to-PBC conversion (Oct-25) typically adds >12 months of audit & governance work.  
• SEC backlog of 900 registration statements following shutdown makes expedited review less plausible.  

Moderate evidence for Yes (small upward pressure):  
• Capital burn and multi-trillion infrastructure ambitions create outsized cash needs; an early filing could leap-frog Anthropic and capitalise on hot AI equity demand.  
• Rule 8(a)/shutdown guidance shows that, in principle, a company could file and go effective quickly if it wanted the element of surprise.

Weak evidence for Yes:  
• Anonymous “could come sooner” remarks in several articles; purely speculative.  
• Employee liquidity and retention chatter; typical of late-stage startups.

Net weighting: strong evidence heavily disfavors an S-1 in the next five weeks; contrary evidence is speculative and weak.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining: 37 (≈5 weeks).  If the deadline were doubled to 10 weeks, probability rises to ~5 %; if halved to 18 days, drops to ~1 %.  The curve is steep because filing usually occurs months, not weeks, after the first concrete press leaks—none of which exist.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a hectocorn tech firm to file an S-1 in any given 5-week window ≈1.5 %.  
Adjustments:  
+0.5  pp extra cash-burn urgency and rivalry with Anthropic.  
–0.5  pp added complexity from PBC governance and fresh restructuring.  
–0.5  pp SEC processing backlog.  
Final inside-view probability ≈1.0–1.5 %.  I round to 2 % to reflect a sliver of tail risk that management has already drafted a registration statement and chooses to drop it suddenly.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 2 out of 100 times in worlds like this, OpenAI publicly files an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026.

Checklist:
1. Will OpenAI make a public S-1 filing before 15 Mar 26?  
2. Base rate 1.5 %; final 2 % grounded in same reference class.  
3. Consistent: “2 of 100 times the criteria are met.”  
4. Key evidence: a) multiple named sources cite Q4 26 or later; b) no EDGAR draft or bank mandate leaks; c) heavy SEC backlog; d) recent PBC conversion.  
5. Blind-spot: secret confidential filing flipped to public overnight for strategic shock.  Would raise Yes likelihood sharply.  
6. Status-quo bias supports No; short timeframe, no visible prep.

Probability: 2%
