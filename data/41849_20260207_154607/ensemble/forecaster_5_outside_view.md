Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis

1. Yahoo Finance, 10 Jan 2026 – Straight news article, quotes Sam Altman and cites prior Wall Street Journal / Reuters reporting.  Factual take-aways: Altman is unenthusiastic about being a public-company CEO; CFO Sarah Friar is said to be aiming for a 2027 listing, “possible filing in late-2026.”  Quality: high-moderate (mainstream financial outlet quoting principals).

2. Japan Times, 30 Oct 2025 – Newswire-style story built on three unnamed sources plus a reported Friar comment.  Core facts: OpenAI “considering filing … as soon as 2H 2026,” but internally talks about a 2027 IPO.  Quality: moderate (secondary paper relaying Reuters-type sourcing).

3. I10x.ai, 30 Jan 2026 – Opinion/analysis blog.  Claims IPO “by the end of the year (2026).”  Minimal sourcing; heavy on commentary about governance challenges.  Quality: low-moderate for facts, useful only as sentiment indicator.

4. Motley Fool, 18 Jan 2026 – Retail-investor commentary.  Re-aggregates public numbers; expresses the author’s personal view that an OpenAI IPO is “a strong possibility” in 2026.  Quality: low for forward-looking facts.

5. Guardian, 22 Jan 2026 – Mainstream publication surveying prospective 2026 mega-IPOs.  Repeats Reuters valuation/timing figures, provides macro context.  Quality: moderate.

6. Built In, 4 Feb 2026 – Trade-press listicle.  Notes no concrete plans, cites unnamed “sources” who say “late-2026 or 2027.”  Quality: moderate-low.

7. Agent report (7 Feb 2026) – Synthetic review that canvasses legal filings, banker mandates, media leaks and EDGAR searches.  Concludes there is “no tangible sign” of a Form S-1 and stresses the logistical/audit timeline that makes 2H 2026 the earliest feasible window.  Quality: high for gap analysis; reasoning is transparent.

Across all sources, every on-record statement or named-source leak points to the second half of 2026 or later; none indicates an imminent (≤ 6 weeks) public filing.  No EDGAR entry or credible leak of a draft S-1 exists.  Opinions forecasting 2026 IPOs are either anonymous, speculative, or retail-oriented.

(b)  Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes:

1. U.S. “hectocorn” (>$100 B valuation) tech companies planning IPOs.
   – Historical set: Facebook ’12, Alibaba ’14, Uber ’19, Airbnb ’20, Snowflake ’20.  
   – Median lead time between first serious press leak of IPO prep and public S-1: ~8 months.
   – No case of an S-1 surfacing with <2 months of advance chatter.

2. Any U.S. VC-backed company filing an S-1 in the last decade.
   – Roughly 150–200 per year at the 2021 peak, ~100 in 2025.
   – Base probability that any given large private firm files in a 37-day window: ≈1–2 %.

3. Companies that completed a major governance restructuring (non-profit→PBC) and then filed an S-1.
   – Observable cases (e.g., Duolingo PBC, Warby Parker PBC) took 18–24 months from restructure to filing.

Reference class 1 (mega-cap tech IPOs) best matches OpenAI’s scale and media profile and is therefore chosen.

(c)  Timeframe analysis

• Days remaining until deadline: 37 (≈5 weeks).  
• Historical pattern for mega-cap tech IPOs: public S-1 typically appears 3-12 months before the first trade date; extensive leaks and bank mandates precede the filing by ≥ 3 months.  
• No analogous firm has ever produced a surprise S-1 in a five-week window without prior unmistakable signals.

(d)  Justification for base-rate estimate

1. Structural prerequisites: OpenAI’s PBC conversion closed only 3 ½ months ago; SEC typically expects two years of PBC financials or a waiver—no sign a waiver is sought.  
2. Capital access: the firm continues to raise multi-billion-dollar private rounds, easing urgency to go public.  
3. Signalling: neither lead-underwriter mandates, analyst-day invitations, nor “testing-the-waters” meetings have leaked—highly improbable for a trillion-dollar prospectus five weeks out.  
4. Management guidance: every named executive reference (Altman, Friar) pushes the timeline to late-2026/2027.  
5. Market precedents: zero examples of a hectocorn filing publicly within 37 days of no-noise status quo.

Combining the hectocorn base rate (≈1 %–2 % over a 37-day span) with mild upward adjustment for the tiny chance management has secretly accelerated the process (e.g., already drafted but not yet filed) yields a rounded outside-view probability in the low-single digits.

Outside view calibration:

Starting base rate for hectocorn S-1 in any given five-week period: ~1.5 %.  
+0.5 % for OpenAI’s extraordinary capital appetite (could shorten normal timelines).  
+0.5 % for non-zero chance of strategic “surprise” filing to pre-empt competitors.  
–0.5 % for governance complexity (PBC + nonprofit control) that lengthens prep time.  

Net outside-view estimate: 1.5 % + 0.5 % + 0.5 % – 0.5 % ≈ 2 %.

Round to nearest 1 % for clarity: 2 %.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 2 % chance that OpenAI will publicly file a Form S-1 with the SEC on or before 15 March 2026.
