The forecasting question is:
Will OpenAI file an initial registration statement (S-1) with the SEC to launch an IPO, before March 15, 2026?

Question background:
From [Invezz](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/spacex-to-openai-mega-ipos-set-to-debut-in-2026-5152303) via Investing.com:&#x20;

> OpenAI is laying early groundwork for an IPO that could value the company at up to \$1 trillion.

> The ChatGPT maker is considering filing with regulators as early as the second half of 2026, with CFO Sarah Friar indicating to associates that the company is targeting a 2027 listing, though advisers say it could come sooner.

> The potential offering follows a significant restructuring completed this week, creating a new corporate structure under the OpenAI Foundation, which now holds a 26% stake.

> OpenAI’s rapid revenue growth—expected to reach an annualized run rate of \$20 billion by year-end—is matched by mounting losses and rising capital needs, particularly as CEO Sam Altman pursues multi-trillion-dollar investments in AI infrastructure.

# Summary of Article: "OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to $1 trillion valuation"

**Source:** The Japan Times  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Author:** Echo Wang

# Summary of "OpenAI IPO: Governance Challenges and AI Implications"

**Source:** I10x.ai  
**Date:** January 30, 2026

## Key Facts and Timeline:

- **IPO Timing:** OpenAI is reportedly exploring an IPO "by the end of the year" (2026), with reports suggesting it could happen "as early as the end of this year"
- **Industry Context:** This would position OpenAI as potentially the first major pure-play generative AI company to go public
- **Competitor:** Anthropic is also rumored to be pursuing a similar IPO trajectory
- **Status:** OpenAI has not officially confirmed any IPO plans, though the article notes that "consistency of the reports indicates that strategic discussions about tapping public markets for its immense capital needs are well underway"

## Central Governance Challenge:

The article emphasizes a critical structural issue: OpenAI operates under a unique "capped-profit" structure governed by a non-profit parent board, designed to prioritize safe AGI development over shareholder returns. The article argues this creates a fundamental conflict with traditional IPO requirements that demand maximizing shareholder value. Any S-1 filing would need to explain "how public investors can buy into a company whose foundational mission is explicitly not about unlimited profits."

## Expected Disclosures and Impacts:

- **Microsoft Relationship:** An S-1 would force disclosure of deal terms including Azure cloud credits, revenue sharing agreements, and IP rights, revealing OpenAI's dependency on Microsoft
- **Financial Transparency:** Would reveal audited numbers on unit economics of ChatGPT subscriptions vs. API sales, true gross margins, GPU cluster depreciation, and capital expenditure requirements
- **Industry Benchmark:** Would create the first direct, publicly-traded benchmark for valuing a foundational model provider

## Stakeholder Impacts (per article):

- **AI Competitors:** High impact - would force rivals like Anthropic to accelerate their own IPO plans
- **Microsoft:** High impact - would validate investment but expose financial entanglement
- **Investors:** High impact - would provide first pure-play generative AI investment vehicle
- **Regulators:** Significant impact - S-1 prospectus would become foundational document for global AI regulation

**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end and represents opinion/analysis rather than hard news reporting.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize all public reports since 2024 on OpenAI’s IPO timing, corporate restructurings, banker engagements, and any SEC registration activity; highlight evidence for or against an S-1 before Mar 15 2026.
Since the beginning of 2024 every credible public reference to OpenAI’s capital-markets plans can be grouped into four buckets: (1) legal and governance restructurings, (2) capital-raising and banker interaction, (3) on-the-record statements by management, and (4) any appearance (or conspicuous non-appearance) in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) EDGAR system.  Bringing those threads together, there is still no tangible sign—public or leaked—of a draft or public Form S-1 that would have to precede an IPO.  The cumulative evidence therefore weighs heavily against an OpenAI registration statement being filed before 15 March 2026.

1. Corporate-structure milestones
• December 2024 – first conversion proposal.  Reuters reported that OpenAI intended to scrap its capped-profit LLC subsidiary and adopt a conventional C-corp structure to be “more attractive to investors” (summarised by Investing News Network, 22 Sep 2025).  
• May 2025 – pivot to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).  Facing scrutiny by the California and Delaware Attorneys General, OpenAI said the nonprofit parent would keep control while the operating business would become a PBC—a form that allows both profit and mission protection (TIME, 28 Oct 2025).  
• 28 Oct 2025 – recapitalisation and final structure.  OpenAI announced that the nonprofit (now the OpenAI Foundation) owns 26 percent of the new PBC, Microsoft roughly 27 percent, and employees plus early investors 47 percent.  Both CNBC and TIME stress that the nonprofit retains super-voting governance and safety oversight (CNBC, 28 Oct 2025; TIME, 28 Oct 2025).  The Delaware Attorney General issued a “Statement of No Objection,” confirming compliance with charitable-asset rules.  CFO Sarah Friar called the end-state “IPO-able” at the Dublin Tech Summit (Yahoo Finance, 28 May 2025).

2. Banker engagements and financing activity
• Private mega-rounds crowd out near-term IPO pressure.  – October 2024: US $6.6 billion equity/debt package led by Microsoft and JPMorgan (CNBC, 28 Oct 2025).  – March 2025: SoftBank-led US $40 billion round valuing OpenAI at US $300 billion (INN, 22 Sep 2025).  – Late 2025–early 2026: negotiations for up to US $100 billion more from Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and others (Mint citing WSJ, 30 Jan 2026; CNBC, 3 Feb 2026).  
• “Project Mercury.”  Bloomberg reporting, echoed by Entrepreneur (21 Oct 2025) and Times Now (22 Oct 2025), revealed that OpenAI hired more than 100 former bankers and consultants from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan.  The official line is that they are training large language models to automate financial analysis, not preparing a prospectus, but the hiring undeniably gives OpenAI in-house deal-modelling talent.  No source, however, reports a formal underwriting mandate or engagement letters with investment banks.  
• Credit facilities.  CNBC-TV18 (21 Oct 2025) refers to a US $4 billion revolving credit line from JPMorgan.  Such facilities are typical in the run-up to an IPO but are not themselves proof of imminent listing.  

3. Management statements on IPO timing
• 28 May 2025 – Friar: new PBC structure “gets us to an IPO-able event,” but “we’ll go public when the markets and the company are ready” (Yahoo Finance).  
• 21 Aug 2025 – Friar reiterates that OpenAI “may go public at some point” with no timetable (Azernews, 21 Aug 2025).  
• 6 Nov 2025 – Friar explicitly tells StartupHub.ai that OpenAI “is not pursuing a near-term IPO,” rebutting speculation of a 2027 debut.  
• 30 Jan 2026 – The Wall Street Journal, relayed by Mint, writes that OpenAI “is considering” a listing as soon as Q4 2026, in a piece primarily about Amazon’s possible US $50 billion investment.  Even that most aggressive scenario implies a confidential S-1 no earlier than mid-2026.  
No other primary source since has contradicted this cautious stance.

4. SEC registration activity—or lack thereof
• None of the search results turn up a Form S-1, confidential or public, or any reference to one in legal or financial media.  
• The only SEC-related document mentioned is an 8-K-style filing in November 2025 that disclosed the status of the prospective Nvidia investment (CNBC, 3 Feb 2026).  That relates to a private placement, not an IPO.  
• Highly watched legal blogs, IPO-tracking websites and major outlets have reported nothing.  Given OpenAI’s profile, even a confidential draft would almost certainly leak.  The silence in EDGAR-oriented coverage is therefore strong negative evidence.

5. Evidence for an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026
Direct evidence: none.  The WSJ/Mint line about a possible Q4 2026 listing is the most aggressive publicly sourced prediction and still does not require an S-1 before mid-2026.  A frequently recited but uncited Reuters note (summarised by CryptoRank) that insiders “see a filing in 2H 2026” likewise points to a post-March timeline.

6. Evidence against an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026
• Friar’s November 2025 statement that OpenAI “is not working on an IPO in the near term”.  
• Ongoing ability to raise unprecedented amounts of private capital removes urgency.  
• The PBC structure was only finalised in late-October 2025; SEC rules would require two years of audited PBC financials for a traditional full-form IPO, pushing the earliest practical filing window into 2H 2026.  
• No reports of lead-underwriter mandates, S-1 drafting sessions, or banks’ analyst-day preparations—all routine leaks for a mega-tech IPO.  
• No mention of “testing-the-waters” or confidential submissions in any legal trade sources or business media.

7. Synthesis
From 2024 through early 2026 OpenAI has executed the corporate housekeeping necessary to keep an IPO option alive—transforming its capped-profit LLC into a PBC, legalising that change with state regulators, and simplifying its cap table.  At the same time, it has continued to raise titanic sums privately, assembled ex-banker talent ostensibly for AI training, and secured large credit lines, all of which give the company strategic and financial flexibility without public-market scrutiny.  Management consistently refuses to commit to a timetable and, when pressed, points to 2027 or later.  Crucially, no trace of an S-1—public or confidential—appears in EDGAR coverage or in the media.  Combining the legal-audit lead time, the financing alternatives, and management’s own words, it is highly improbable that a registration statement will be on file before 15 March 2026.

8. Remaining information gaps
• Absolute confirmation from the SEC of no confidential submission (obtainable only via FOIA or direct SEC comment, which has not been reported).  
• The original Reuters article that secondary outlets cite for a “2H 2026 filing” window; locating and reviewing that piece would clarify whether it merely repeats speculation.  
• Any signed engagement letters with investment banks post-October 2025; these, if they exist, have not leaked.  
• Publication of audited FY-2025 financials for the new PBC; their absence supports, but does not prove, a later filing window.

Unless fresh, primary-source evidence emerges on those fronts, all publicly available facts argue against an OpenAI S-1 being filed before 15 March 2026.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
