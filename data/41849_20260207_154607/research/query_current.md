Analysis:
With only five weeks left until the March 15 2026 deadline, the single piece of evidence that would settle the question is a public, non-confidential Form S-1 for “OpenAI” (or a subsidiary that owns ChatGPT) posted on the SEC’s EDGAR site.  So far, no such filing appears in EDGAR’s company-search pages or in major business wires.  Since an S-1 is immediately public the moment it is accepted by the SEC, any filing would be covered within minutes by market-watch services, tech press and mainstream financial outlets.  Therefore, in order to update the forecast we need to confirm:

1. Whether OpenAI (or a related special-purpose entity) has filed an S-1 in the past few days that analysts have missed.
2. Whether there is any credible report that a confidential draft has just been converted to a public version (e.g., after SEC review) and could be posted imminently.
3. Whether reputable outlets cite named bankers, lawyers or regulators saying a filing is imminent before March 15 2026.
4. Conversely, new interviews or leaks from OpenAI executives, board members or underwriters indicating that the IPO has slipped to late 2026 or 2027 would decrease the likelihood of a near-term filing.

The most relevant, timely information is therefore:
• Real-time SEC filing news alerts.  
• Coverage by Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, CNBC, Financial Times, The Information, Semafor and other tech-finance specialists during February 2026.  
• Any SEC filing tracker blogs that flag newly posted S-1s.  
• Statements by Sam Altman, CFO Sarah Friar, or major investors (Microsoft, Thrive, Khosla) in interviews or conference appearances over the last few weeks.
