Analysis:
The key to judging the likelihood of an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026 is understanding 1) what OpenAI executives and advisers have publicly said about IPO timing, 2) any concrete corporate actions (re-structuring, CFO hire, banker mandates, confidential SEC meetings) that typically precede an S-1, and 3) precedent timelines for large venture-backed tech firms once such steps are taken. Therefore the most relevant historical context will be: press coverage of Sarah Friar’s and Sam Altman’s statements, reports on the new OpenAI Foundation structure, banking/adviser engagements, comparisons to other “mega-IPO” cases, and any mention of a confidential draft registration. General macro-economic data are not directly determinative here, so a FRED query is unnecessary.
