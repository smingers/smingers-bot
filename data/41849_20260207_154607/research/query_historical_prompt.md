You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will OpenAI file an initial registration statement (S-1) with the SEC to launch an IPO, before March 15, 2026?

Question background:
From [Invezz](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/spacex-to-openai-mega-ipos-set-to-debut-in-2026-5152303) via Investing.com:&#x20;

> OpenAI is laying early groundwork for an IPO that could value the company at up to \$1 trillion.

> The ChatGPT maker is considering filing with regulators as early as the second half of 2026, with CFO Sarah Friar indicating to associates that the company is targeting a 2027 listing, though advisers say it could come sooner.

> The potential offering follows a significant restructuring completed this week, creating a new corporate structure under the OpenAI Foundation, which now holds a 26% stake.

> OpenAI’s rapid revenue growth—expected to reach an annualized run rate of \$20 billion by year-end—is matched by mounting losses and rising capital needs, particularly as CEO Sam Altman pursues multi-trillion-dollar investments in AI infrastructure.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-07. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-07 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic indicators, financial data, interest rates, employment, GDP, inflation, trade statistics, or any quantitative economic metric, use FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to retrieve official historical data. Your query should describe the economic indicator (e.g., "US unemployment rate" or "consumer price index") or use a known FRED series ID directly (e.g., "UNRATE" or "CPIAUCSL"). This returns historical data with computed statistics for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a FRED query if the question involves economic/financial data.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. [Query details] (Google)
2. [Query details] (Google News)
3. [Query details] (Agent)
4. [economic indicator query] (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
