The case alleges that Klarna's September 2025 Initial Public Offering (IPO) registration statement and prospectus contained misleading statements about the company's credit risk modeling and risk management, particularly regarding lending to financially unsophisticated customers, those in financial hardship, and borrowers using high-interest loans for items like fast food deliveries. The complaint claims these risks were materially understated, leading to a 102% year-over-year increase in credit loss provisions and a significant rise in operating losses, as reported on November 18, 2025. Following this disclosure, Klarna\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 22% below its IPO price. The lead plaintiff deadline to seek appointment as representative of the class is February 20, 2026. Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation, emphasized that investors deserve transparency when credit loss provisions double shortly after an IPO. Investors who purchased Klarna shares during the IPO and suffered losses are encouraged to submit their claims via a secure portal or email at [email protected]. Whistleblowers with non-public information may qualify for rewards of up to 30% of any SEC recovery under the SEC Whistleblower Program.

Huang confirmed that the first investment deal\u2014planned to reach up to $100 billion\u2014has already been completed. He described OpenAI as a 'once-in-a-century company' and expressed that NVIDIA is 'very happy to invest.' Despite this positive stance, reports from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters suggest internal concerns at NVIDIA about the investment's risk and scale, as well as OpenAI's dissatisfaction with certain new NVIDIA chips, prompting OpenAI to evaluate alternative solutions since last year. Huang dismissed these claims as 'without basis' and affirmed that NVIDIA will make 'the largest investment in the company's history.' Altman also addressed the rumors on X (formerly Twitter), stating, 'We really like working with NVIDIA\u2014they make the best AI chips in the world,' and expressed confusion over the speculation.

The investment, initially outlined in September 2023 with a potential $100 billion commitment over phases to build AI infrastructure using Nvidia's technology, remains pending formal agreement, as noted in a November 2023 SEC filing. Market concerns intensified after a Wall Street Journal report on February 1 suggesting the deal was 'temporarily shelved,' causing Nvidia (NVDA-US) to drop 2.89% on February 2 and another 3% on February 3, closing at $180.34\u2014over 13% below its October 2023 peak. Despite speculation that OpenAI is exploring partnerships with competitors like AMD, Broadcom, and Cerebras due to chip supply constraints, Sam Altman publicly affirmed OpenAI's strong desire to continue collaborating with Nvidia, calling its chips 'the best in the world' and stating the company plans to remain a major customer for years. OpenAI has relied heavily on Nvidia's GPUs for training and deploying AI models since its founding.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:10 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6331426)\n\n**Why IPOs from Anthropic, OpenAI, SpaceX could hurt stock market**\nAccording to a report by asset management firm GMO, led by investor Jeremy Grantham, the anticipated surge in IPOs from major private tech companies\u2014specifically OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX\u2014could negatively impact the broader U.S. stock market in 2026. Ben Inker, GMO's co-head of asset allocation, warned that the influx of new shares without a corresponding rise in demand may lead to downward pressure on stock prices. He noted that historically, each 1% increase in market capitalization from IPOs has led to approximately a 7.5% decline in overall market price over time. Since these companies are unlikely to be included in the S&P 500 at launch, investor demand to buy into them could trigger outflows from the benchmark index. Inker also predicted negative returns for the S&P 500 in 2026, citing a potential rotation out of top AI stocks and identifying Japanese small-cap and European value stocks as better global equity opportunities. This view contrasts with the broader Wall Street consensus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ipo-anthropic-openai-spacex-tech-stocks-outlook-gmo-jeremy-grantham-2026-2)\n\n**Swarmer files for IPO to list on Nasdaq under ticker SWMR By Investing.com**\nSwarmer, a drone autonomy software company supporting operations in Ukraine, has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) of its common stock.

According to five informed sources cited by The New York Times, the talks are ongoing and the final terms have not been finalized. Potential investors include NVIDIA, Amazon, Microsoft, and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group. OpenAI\u2019s current valuation is around $500 billion, making it one of the world\u2019s most valuable private companies, alongside SpaceX and ByteDance. The company is also considering an initial public offering (IPO) as early as this year. Despite generating $13 billion in revenue in 2025\u2014projected to triple in 2026\u2014OpenAI remains unprofitable and plans to spend approximately $115 billion between 2025 and 2029 on computing infrastructure, a fraction of its long-term commitment of about $1.4 trillion. The company raised $40 billion in its last funding round in March 2024, with the final tranche received at the end of that year. Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, OpenAI maintained a technological lead over competitors like Anthropic and Google for over two years, but recent advances by U.S. and Chinese firms have narrowed or surpassed its performance. This has increased pressure on revenue, prompting OpenAI to introduce ads in its free version of ChatGPT, which now has over 800 million users. ChatGPT remains the primary revenue driver, with about 6% of users paying $20 monthly for the premium version. OpenAI is also expanding into enterprise markets, including healthcare and finance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:17 PM\nSource:[\u65e9\u62a5](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/world/story20260202-8275040)\n\n**Agomab Announces Launch of Initial Public Offering**\nAgomAb Therapeutics NV, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel disease-modifying therapies for immunology and inflammatory diseases\u2014particularly chronic fibrotic conditions with high unmet medical need\u2014announced the launch of its initial public offering (IPO) on February 2, 2026.

According to Cooley's Reid Hooper, the initial review timeline for filings\u2014expected to be 27\u201330 days\u2014will remain unchanged, and reviews will be handled in the order received. Corp Fin is prioritizing the clearance of POS Ams, S-3s, and resale S-1s with delaying amendments to make them effective as soon as possible. Afterward, the focus will shift to IPO DRS filings and amendments to S-1/F-1 statements containing delaying amendments. Given the substantial workload, the process will take time. For pending reviews, Corp Fin staff are likely using November 16\u201317, 2025, to reorganize and plan; firms are advised to wait until early next week to contact examiners assigned to their filings for status updates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:22 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/corp-fin-issues-reopening-guidance-and-9983826/)\n\n**IPO Prices After Registration Statement Effective Under 8(a)**\nMapLight, a California-based biotech company, priced its initial public offering (IPO) after its registration statement became effective under Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The company filed its S-1/A on October 6, 2025, and included the proposed public offering price and specific language under Rule 473(b), enabling automatic effectiveness 20 calendar days after filing\u2014on October 26, 2025. The filing occurred during the government shutdown, with no SEC review completed. The company acknowledged the risks associated with relying on Section 8(a), including the potential need for a post-effective amendment, distribution of an updated prospectus, a stop order under Section 8(d), or a substantial stock price decline, litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse outcomes. The company stated it would re-evaluate its use of Section 8(a) if the SEC resumed normal operations before October 26, 2025. This appears to be the first operating company IPO to price during a government shutdown, though two SPACs previously did so. The article notes no known IPOs priced during the 2018\u20132019 shutdown, and most companies that removed delaying amendments later re-added them when the SEC reopened. The author invites readers to provide information on any prior instances of an IPO pricing after an S-1 became effective under Section 8(a).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 09:45 AM\nSource:[TheCorporateCounsel.net](https://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/2025/10/ipo-prices-after-registration-statement-effective-under-8a.html)\n\n**SEC Allows Registration Statements to Take Effect During Government Shutdown**\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on October 9, 2025, that it will allow registration statements for initial public offerings (IPOs) and other transactions to become effective during the ongoing government shutdown, even without a pre-effective amendment containing the final offering price. Under the revised guidance, companies may omit pricing information from the registration statement using Rule 430A and file a 'red herring' prospectus with a price range. The registration statement will automatically become effective 20 days after filing, without the need to file a delaying amendment or wait for SEC staff review. This change reduces execution risk by eliminating the prior requirement to file a pre-effective amendment with the final price and restart the 20-day clock. The SEC stated it will not recommend enforcement actions against companies that follow this approach during the shutdown. Companies must still address any outstanding material issues raised by SEC staff and include the legend: 'This registration statement shall hereafter become effective in accordance with the provisions of section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.' The guidance is expected to primarily benefit companies close to completing the SEC review process before the shutdown, enabling them to proceed with IPOs by setting a price range and finalizing pricing in the final prospectus after automatic effectiveness. Additionally, companies may use the 20% safe harbor under the rule to price above or below the stated range.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/sec-allows-registration-statements-to-6314757/)\n\n**Robinhood Files SEC Registration for Retail Venture Capital Fund**\nRobinhood has filed a Form\u202fN\u20112 registration statement with the SEC to launch the Robinhood\u202fVentures\u202fFund\u202fI, a closed\u2011end fund that would trade on the NYSE if approved.

The filing follows earlier criticism of Robinhood\u2019s EU private\u2011equity token offerings, including tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX, which were clarified after the controversy. The proposed fund would provide liquidity through traditional brokerage platforms, potentially expanding retail exposure to emerging technologies such as blockchain and Web3.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[CoinCentral](https://coincentral.com/robinhood-files-sec-registration-for-retail-venture-capital-fund/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
