In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying.\"\n  - \"It's wonderful to be a private company\"\n  - Stated he does not know whether OpenAI would go public \"in the near term\" and declined to discuss fundraising plans or valuation details\n\n### IPO Timeline and Valuation:\n- **No IPO has been filed yet** (as of article date)\n- **Valuation estimates:** Internal estimates have reached as high as **$1 trillion** (per Wall Street Journal report from previous month)\n- **IPO timeline (per Reuters, October report):** CFO Sarah Friar is targeting a **2027 listing** with a **possible IPO filing in late 2026**\n- If realized, these valuations would place OpenAI among the most valuable private companies discussed ahead of a public listing\n\n### Reasons for Considering IPO:\n- **Capital needs:** Altman stated \"We need lots of capital. We're going to cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.\"\n- Access to capital is a key consideration as OpenAI scales\n\n### Corporate Structure:\n- Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit\n- Later created a capped-profit arm\n- **October recapitalization:** Structured commercial business as a public benefit corporation\n- OpenAI Foundation (nonprofit parent) retains governance control and holds equity stake valued at **about $130 billion**\n- Microsoft's ownership reduced to **about 27%** with updated governance, IP, and cloud partnership terms\n\n### Competitive Environment:\n- Altman declared a \"code red\" to employees (per internal memo cited by The Information), indicating competitive pressure\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/10/30/tech/openai-ipo-trillion-valuation/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to $1 trillion valuation\"\n\n**Source:** The Japan Times  \n**Date:** October 30, 2025  \n**Author:** Echo Wang\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Potential Valuation:** OpenAI is preparing for an IPO that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, which would make it one of the biggest IPOs of all time.\n\n2. **Potential Filing Timeline:** The company is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.\n\n3. **Fundraising Target:** In preliminary discussions, OpenAI has looked at raising $60 billion at the low end, with likely more at the high end.\n\n4. **CFO's Timeline:** Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing.\n\n## Opinions from Named Sources:\n\n- **Sarah Friar (CFO):** Targeting a 2027 listing according to what she has told associates.\n\n## Opinions from Unnamed/Less Reliable Sources:\n\n- **\"Three people familiar with the matter\":** Provided the overall information about the IPO groundwork and potential valuation.\n- **\"Some advisers\":** Predict the IPO could come even sooner than 2027, around late 2026.\n\n## Important Caveats:\n\nThe sources cautioned that talks are early and plans\u2014including figures and timing\u2014could change depending on business growth and market conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end, so there may be additional content not captured in this extraction.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://i10x.ai/news/openai-ipo-governance-test-ai\">\n# Summary of \"OpenAI IPO: Governance Challenges and AI Implications\"\n\n**Source:** I10x.ai  \n**Date:** January 30, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n- **IPO Timing:** OpenAI is reportedly exploring an IPO \"by the end of the year\" (2026), with reports suggesting it could happen \"as early as the end of this year\"\n- **Industry Context:** This would position OpenAI as potentially the first major pure-play generative AI company to go public\n- **Competitor:** Anthropic is also rumored to be pursuing a similar IPO trajectory\n- **Status:** OpenAI has not officially confirmed any IPO plans, though the article notes that \"consistency of the reports indicates that strategic discussions about tapping public markets for its immense capital needs are well underway\"\n\n## Central Governance Challenge:\n\nThe article emphasizes a critical structural issue: OpenAI operates under a unique \"capped-profit\" structure governed by a non-profit parent board, designed to prioritize safe AGI development over shareholder returns. The article argues this creates a fundamental conflict with traditional IPO requirements that demand maximizing shareholder value. Any S-1 filing would need to explain \"how public investors can buy into a company whose foundational mission is explicitly not about unlimited profits.\"\n\n## Expected Disclosures and Impacts:\n\n- **Microsoft Relationship:** An S-1 would force disclosure of deal terms including Azure cloud credits, revenue sharing agreements, and IP rights, revealing OpenAI's dependency on Microsoft\n- **Financial Transparency:** Would reveal audited numbers on unit economics of ChatGPT subscriptions vs. API sales, true gross margins, GPU cluster depreciation, and capital expenditure requirements\n- **Industry Benchmark:** Would create the first direct, publicly-traded benchmark for valuing a foundational model provider\n\n## Stakeholder Impacts (per article):\n\n- **AI Competitors:** High impact - would force rivals like Anthropic to accelerate their own IPO plans\n- **Microsoft:** High impact - would validate investment but expose financial entanglement\n- **Investors:** High impact - would provide first pure-play generative AI investment vehicle\n- **Regulators:** Significant impact - S-1 prospectus would become foundational document for global AI regulation\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end and represents opinion/analysis rather than hard news reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/18/better-potential-ipo-2026-spacex-openai-chatgpt/\">\n# Summary of \"Better Potential IPO in 2026: SpaceX vs. OpenAI (ChatGPT)\"\n\n**Source:** The Motley Fool  \n**Date:** January 18, 2026  \n**Author:** Bram Berkowitz\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### SpaceX:\n- Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk\n- Starlink had 9,357 satellites in orbit as of mid-December, with plans for up to 42,000\n- Recently conducted a secondary share sale at an $800 billion valuation\n- Revenue projected to hit approximately $15.5 billion in 2025 (according to Musk in June)\n- Starlink has 9 million active users across 155 countries, adding approximately 20,000 users per day\n- Could raise over $30 billion in a potential IPO at a valuation as high as $1.5 trillion\n\n### OpenAI:\n- ChatGPT reached 800 million active weekly users as of October (described as \"the fastest-growing consumer application of all time\")\n- Charges $20 per month for its premium version\n- Expected to achieve a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate sometime in 2025 (per Altman's previous statements)\n- Has reportedly inked contracts for data center capacity worth a collective $1.4 trillion\n- Could raise as much as $100 billion in an IPO, with valuations ranging from $830 billion to potentially $1 trillion\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Elon Musk** called previous reports about a SpaceX IPO in 2026 \"accurate\"\n\n## Article Author's Opinions (less reliable/individual commentary):\n\n- The author predicts retail investors will face astronomical valuations by the time shares become available due to hype\n- Recommends not buying either IPO on listing day; suggests waiting until lock-up provisions expire\n- If forced to choose, the author would select OpenAI over SpaceX, citing OpenAI's massive growth and relatively low pricing ($20/month), while noting SpaceX faces significant execution risk operating in space\n\n## Relevant Context:\n\nThe article notes it's \"less certain\" that OpenAI will go public in 2026 compared to SpaceX, though many believe there's a strong possibility. The Wall Street Journal is cited as the source for OpenAI's potential fundraising figures.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/22/the-year-of-the-hectocorn-the-100bn-tech-companies-that-could-float-in-2026\">\n# Summary of Guardian Article: \"The year of the 'hectocorn': the $100bn tech companies that could float in 2026\"\n\n**Date:** January 22, 2026  \n**Author:** Aisha Down\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to OpenAI IPO Question:\n\n### OpenAI Valuation and IPO Prospects:\n- OpenAI's valuation increased from $29 billion in 2023 to $500 billion in 2023\n- **If OpenAI floats, it could be valued at as much as $1 trillion, according to Reuters**\n- OpenAI is committed to spending $1.4 trillion on infrastructure (datacentres and computer chips) over the next eight years\n- The company is currently loss-making but has attracted investment from Microsoft and SoftBank\n- OpenAI triggered public AI interest with ChatGPT's launch in November 2022\n\n### Named Expert Opinions:\n- **Neil Wilson (analyst at Saxo Capital Markets):** \"OpenAI is clearly the single biggest test for the entire AI economy, the bubble idea and whether it's all built on sand.\"\n\n### Market Context:\n- 2026 is described as potentially \"the year of the 'hectocorn'\" with several companies potentially floating at valuations over $100 billion\n- Markets soared to near-record highs in 2025 on the back of the AI boom\n- Investors are expected to keep betting big on AI technology for now\n- Some companies may have had plans to float in 2025 that were delayed by US federal shutdown and government job cuts affecting market watchdog\n- 2026 is described as \"geopolitically choppy\" with Trump's tariff threats affecting markets\n\n### Other Companies Mentioned as Potential 2026 IPOs:\nThe article lists 10 major companies considering IPOs, including Anthropic, SpaceX, Stripe, Kraken, Databricks, Canva, Anduril, Monzo, and Bolt, providing context for OpenAI's position among potential major tech flotations.\n\n**Note:** The article does not provide a specific timeline for when OpenAI might file its S-1 or complete an IPO, only discussing its potential valuation if it floats.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://builtin.com/articles/top-tech-ipos-2026\">\n# Summary of Built In Article on 2026 IPO Watchlist\n\n**Date:** February 04, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Overall IPO Market Context:\n- U.S. listings dropped from 397 in 2021 to just 202 in 2025 (according to New York Times)\n- Current IPO record holder is Saudi Aramco at $25 billion (2019)\n- Markets are near record highs with surging investor appetite for AI\n\n### OpenAI Specific Information:\n\n**Valuation and Financial Status:**\n- Most recently valued at $830 billion\n- Company remains \"deep in the red\" and faces periodic bankruptcy rumors\n- A public debut could push valuation into trillion-dollar territory\n\n**IPO Timeline:**\n- No concrete IPO plans announced\n- Sources say it could happen in late-2026 or 2027\n\n**IPO Preparation Indicators:**\n- Hired Sarah Friar as CFO (veteran who took Square and NextDoor public)\n- Continuing to raise massive funding rounds\n- Planning to integrate ads in ChatGPT and enterprise AI tools to establish more durable revenue streams\n\n**Infrastructure and Capital Needs:**\n- Company has $1.4 trillion infrastructure roadmap to build out data centers over the next eight years\n- True economics of massive cloud costs have been \"obscured by more than $1 trillion in circular financing deals\"\n\n**Corporate Structure:**\n- Completed restructuring, shedding nonprofit roots in favor of for-profit public benefit corporation\n- This move makes an eventual IPO \"all the more feasible\"\n\n**CEO Statement:**\n- Sam Altman has said he's \"zero percent excited\" about running a public company\n- However, he hasn't been shy about OpenAI's need for enormous amounts of capital\n\n### Other Companies Mentioned:\n\n**Anthropic:**\n- Valued at $350 billion after $10 billion funding round\n- Hired Krishna Rao (Airbnb IPO veteran) as CFO\n- Hired Wilson Sonsini law firm (guided Google and LinkedIn IPOs) in December 2025\n- Generated ~$9 billion in annual recurring revenue in 2025\n- Projected to make $20 billion in 2026 and $70 billion by 2028\n- Aiming to break even by 2028\n\n**SpaceX:**\n- Elon Musk confirmed could go public in 2026\n- Reports claim Musk would like IPO in June to coincide with his birthday\n- Valued at $1.25 trillion after acquiring xAI\n- Consortium including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America reportedly tapped to lead offering\n\n## Article Context and Opinions:\n\nThe article presents the view that AI development costs and capital needs are driving these companies toward public markets after years of private growth.

Bringing those threads together, there is still no tangible sign\u2014public or leaked\u2014of a draft or public Form S-1 that would have to precede an IPO.  The cumulative evidence therefore weighs heavily against an OpenAI registration statement being filed before 15 March 2026.\n\n1. Corporate-structure milestones\n\u2022 December 2024 \u2013 first conversion proposal.  Reuters reported that OpenAI intended to scrap its capped-profit LLC subsidiary and adopt a conventional C-corp structure to be \u201cmore attractive to investors\u201d (summarised by Investing News Network, 22 Sep 2025).  \n\u2022 May 2025 \u2013 pivot to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC).  Facing scrutiny by the California and Delaware Attorneys General, OpenAI said the nonprofit parent would keep control while the operating business would become a PBC\u2014a form that allows both profit and mission protection (TIME, 28 Oct 2025).  \n\u2022 28 Oct 2025 \u2013 recapitalisation and final structure.  OpenAI announced that the nonprofit (now the OpenAI Foundation) owns 26 percent of the new PBC, Microsoft roughly 27 percent, and employees plus early investors 47 percent.  Both CNBC and TIME stress that the nonprofit retains super-voting governance and safety oversight (CNBC, 28 Oct 2025; TIME, 28 Oct 2025).  The Delaware Attorney General issued a \u201cStatement of No Objection,\u201d confirming compliance with charitable-asset rules.  CFO Sarah Friar called the end-state \u201cIPO-able\u201d at the Dublin Tech Summit (Yahoo Finance, 28 May 2025).\n\n2. Banker engagements and financing activity\n\u2022 Private mega-rounds crowd out near-term IPO pressure.  \u2013 October 2024: US $6.6 billion equity/debt package led by Microsoft and JPMorgan (CNBC, 28 Oct 2025).  \u2013 March 2025: SoftBank-led US $40 billion round valuing OpenAI at US $300 billion (INN, 22 Sep 2025).  \u2013 Late 2025\u2013early 2026: negotiations for up to US $100 billion more from Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and others (Mint citing WSJ, 30 Jan 2026; CNBC, 3 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 \u201cProject Mercury.\u201d  Bloomberg reporting, echoed by Entrepreneur (21 Oct 2025) and Times Now (22 Oct 2025), revealed that OpenAI hired more than 100 former bankers and consultants from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan.  The official line is that they are training large language models to automate financial analysis, not preparing a prospectus, but the hiring undeniably gives OpenAI in-house deal-modelling talent.  No source, however, reports a formal underwriting mandate or engagement letters with investment banks.  \n\u2022 Credit facilities.  CNBC-TV18 (21 Oct 2025) refers to a US $4 billion revolving credit line from JPMorgan.  Such facilities are typical in the run-up to an IPO but are not themselves proof of imminent listing.  \n\n3. Management statements on IPO timing\n\u2022 28 May 2025 \u2013 Friar: new PBC structure \u201cgets us to an IPO-able event,\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019ll go public when the markets and the company are ready\u201d (Yahoo Finance).  \n\u2022 21 Aug 2025 \u2013 Friar reiterates that OpenAI \u201cmay go public at some point\u201d with no timetable (Azernews, 21 Aug 2025).  \n\u2022 6 Nov 2025 \u2013 Friar explicitly tells StartupHub.ai that OpenAI \u201cis not pursuing a near-term IPO,\u201d rebutting speculation of a 2027 debut.  \n\u2022 30 Jan 2026 \u2013 The Wall Street Journal, relayed by Mint, writes that OpenAI \u201cis considering\u201d a listing as soon as Q4 2026, in a piece primarily about Amazon\u2019s possible US $50 billion investment.  Even that most aggressive scenario implies a confidential S-1 no earlier than mid-2026.  \nNo other primary source since has contradicted this cautious stance.\n\n4. SEC registration activity\u2014or lack thereof\n\u2022 None of the search results turn up a Form S-1, confidential or public, or any reference to one in legal or financial media.  \n\u2022 The only SEC-related document mentioned is an 8-K-style filing in November 2025 that disclosed the status of the prospective Nvidia investment (CNBC, 3 Feb 2026).  That relates to a private placement, not an IPO.  \n\u2022 Highly watched legal blogs, IPO-tracking websites and major outlets have reported nothing.  Given OpenAI\u2019s profile, even a confidential draft would almost certainly leak.  The silence in EDGAR-oriented coverage is therefore strong negative evidence.\n\n5. Evidence for an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026\nDirect evidence: none.  The WSJ/Mint line about a possible Q4 2026 listing is the most aggressive publicly sourced prediction and still does not require an S-1 before mid-2026.  A frequently recited but uncited Reuters note (summarised by CryptoRank) that insiders \u201csee a filing in 2H 2026\u201d likewise points to a post-March timeline.\n\n6. Evidence against an S-1 before 15 Mar 2026\n\u2022 Friar\u2019s November 2025 statement that OpenAI \u201cis not working on an IPO in the near term\u201d.  \n\u2022 Ongoing ability to raise unprecedented amounts of private capital removes urgency.  \n\u2022 The PBC structure was only finalised in late-October 2025; SEC rules would require two years of audited PBC financials for a traditional full-form IPO, pushing the earliest practical filing window into 2H 2026.  \n\u2022 No reports of lead-underwriter mandates, S-1 drafting sessions, or banks\u2019 analyst-day preparations\u2014all routine leaks for a mega-tech IPO.  \n\u2022 No mention of \u201ctesting-the-waters\u201d or confidential submissions in any legal trade sources or business media.\n\n7. Synthesis\nFrom 2024 through early 2026 OpenAI has executed the corporate housekeeping necessary to keep an IPO option alive\u2014transforming its capped-profit LLC into a PBC, legalising that change with state regulators, and simplifying its cap table.  At the same time, it has continued to raise titanic sums privately, assembled ex-banker talent ostensibly for AI training, and secured large credit lines, all of which give the company strategic and financial flexibility without public-market scrutiny.  Management consistently refuses to commit to a timetable and, when pressed, points to 2027 or later.  Crucially, no trace of an S-1\u2014public or confidential\u2014appears in EDGAR coverage or in the media.  Combining the legal-audit lead time, the financing alternatives, and management\u2019s own words, it is highly improbable that a registration statement will be on file before 15 March 2026.\n\n8. Remaining information gaps\n\u2022 Absolute confirmation from the SEC of no confidential submission (obtainable only via FOIA or direct SEC comment, which has not been reported).  \n\u2022 The original Reuters article that secondary outlets cite for a \u201c2H 2026 filing\u201d window; locating and reviewing that piece would clarify whether it merely repeats speculation.  \n\u2022 Any signed engagement letters with investment banks post-October 2025; these, if they exist, have not leaked.  \n\u2022 Publication of audited FY-2025 financials for the new PBC; their absence supports, but does not prove, a later filing window.\n\nUnless fresh, primary-source evidence emerges on those fronts, all publicly available facts argue against an OpenAI S-1 being filed before 15 March 2026.\n\nVerification checklist:\n1.
