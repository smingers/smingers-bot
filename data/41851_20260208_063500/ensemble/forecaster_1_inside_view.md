## (a) Source Analysis

**Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - 2026 Doomsday Clock Statement (Nuclear Risk):**
Published 2026, highly credible nonprofit focused on nuclear risk. **Factual content:** Russian drone incursions into NATO countries in 2025, continued Russia-Ukraine war, India-Pakistan conflict (May 2025, 88 hours), Israeli-US strikes on Iranian facilities (June 2025). **Expert opinions:** None directly quoted, but organizational assessment that nuclear arms race indicators are present. Notably, despite heightened tensions, no nuclear detonations occurred in these incidents. Date: Current (2026).

**CFR Article - "Europe Faces Uncertainty as New START Ends":**
Published February 6, 2026 (2 days ago). High credibility source. **Factual content:** New START expired February 5, 2026; France has 290 warheads, UK has 225; Northwood Declaration adopted July 2025. **Named expert opinions:** Kaja Kallas (EU foreign policy chief) - "NATO needs to become more European"; Admiral Tony Radakin - treaty unraveling is "dangerous"; Astrid Chevreuil (CSIS) - moment is "very delicate"; Oliver Meier (European Leadership Network) - New START "worked in [Europe's] favor." All experts express concern but none predict imminent nuclear use.

**Inkstick Media - "What Will the End of the US-Russia Nuclear Arms Treaty Mean?":**
Published January 12, 2026. Credible independent media. **Factual content:** New START expires Feb 5, 2026; Russia has 333 ICBMs, 192 SLBMs, 67 bombers, currently limited to 1,550 warheads but possesses 2,600 in storage; Poseidon torpedo scheduled for 2027 deployment. **Analysis:** Treaty expiration removes legal barriers to expansion. No expert opinions quoted predicting actual detonation, only capability to expand arsenals.

**Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - "Russian nuclear weapons, 2025":**
Published May 13, 2025. High credibility. **Factual content:** Russia has ~4,309 warheads (decrease of 71 from previous year); ~1,718 deployed strategic warheads; Russia suspended New START participation in 2023. **Key finding:** "The 'significant' increase in non-strategic nuclear weapons predicted by US Strategic Command five years ago has not materialized." Russia's weapons performance in Ukraine has been "less effective than experts assumed." This is moderate evidence AGAINST imminent nuclear use - actual arsenal growth slower than predicted, conventional performance disappointing.

**Sky News - Ukraine war latest:**
Recent article (date unclear but references recent events). **Factual content:** Russia launched 400+ drones and 40 missiles targeting energy infrastructure; temperatures dropped to -30°C; 600,000 people evacuated Kyiv. **Analysis:** Russia continues conventional attacks on infrastructure, not nuclear escalation. This is moderate evidence that Russia's preferred escalation path remains conventional.

**Economic Times - Nuclear war simulation:**
Discusses Princeton's "Plan A" simulation. **Factual content:** Simulation estimates 90+ million casualties in hours. **Named expert opinion:** Alicia Sanders-Zakre (ICAN) - supports nuclear prohibition treaty. This is about consequences, not probability. No forecasting value.

**AskNews Articles Summary:**

Multiple sources (Il Mattino, Bluewin, CFR, RT, Yle.fi, Helsingin Sanomat, elEconomista.es, Chosun.com, News1, TV Tsargrad, Todo Noticias, REN TV, Sözcü, TVI, Rambler, RBC) from Feb 5-6, 2026 all report:
- New START expired February 5, 2026
- European discussions about developing independent nuclear deterrence
- **Named sources:** Kaja Kallas (EU foreign policy chief) calls for European nuclear debate; Friedrich Merz (German Chancellor) confirms discussions on European nuclear umbrella; Ulf Kristersson (Swedish PM) confirms talks with UK/France; Donald Tusk (Polish PM) discusses nuclear acquisition; Emmanuel Macron promoting European deterrent

**Critical analysis:** ALL sources discuss Europe potentially ACQUIRING nuclear weapons or expanding deterrence cooperation. NONE report imminent threats of nuclear USE. The discussion is about long-term strategic posture (years/decades), not imminent detonation risk (days/weeks).

**Key factual consensus across sources:**
1. New START expired Feb 5, 2026 (2 days before today's date of Feb 8)
2. No nuclear detonations have occurred despite treaty expiration
3. Europe discussing acquisition/cooperation, not facing imminent attack
4. Russia continues conventional operations in Ukraine
5. Expert consensus focuses on arms race risk, not imminent use

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence AGAINST imminent detonation:**

1. **Historical safety record** - Zero nuclear detonations in EU territory across 80+ years, including through numerous severe accidents (Palomares, etc.) where safety mechanisms prevented yield. Multiple independent sources confirm this pattern.

2. **Expert consensus from January 2026 EUISS survey** - 501 European security experts surveyed November 2025 assess Russian nuclear use as LESS likely than other threats; explicitly do NOT expect NATO-Russia war in 2026. Direct, recent, large-sample expert assessment.

3. **Actual Russian behavior pattern** - Bulletin of Atomic Scientists (May 2025) documents that predicted increase in non-strategic nuclear weapons "has not materialized." Russia continues conventional attacks on Ukraine infrastructure (Sky News, Feb 2026) rather than nuclear escalation. Demonstrates revealed preference for conventional warfare.

4. **Strategic logic from named expert** - Sergiy Kyslytsya (Ukraine Deputy FM, October 2025): "By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb." Direct statement from conflict participant that conventional methods are more effective.

**Moderate Evidence on current risk environment:**

1. **Treaty expiration** - New START expired Feb 5, 2026, removing verification mechanisms. Multiple credible sources confirm. However, treaty expiration ≠ imminent use; it removes constraints on arsenal expansion (measured in months/years) not immediate operational decisions.

2. **European strategic discussions** - Multiple named leaders (Kallas, Merz, Kristersson, Tusk, Macron) discussing European nuclear deterrence. This indicates European perception of elevated long-term risk but discussions focus on acquisition timelines of years/decades, not defense against imminent attack.

3. **Russia-Ukraine conflict continuation** - War ongoing with Russian attacks on infrastructure. However, 4 years of conflict with extensive nuclear rhetoric but zero nuclear use demonstrates restraint pattern.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Doomsday Clock at 85 seconds to midnight** - Symbolic assessment, not probabilistic forecast. No predictive methodology disclosed.

2. **Speculative articles** (Sözcü, Economic Times simulation) - Discuss consequences and scenarios but provide no evidence of probability or imminence.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 35 days (February 8, 2026 to March 15, 2026)

**If timeframe were halved (17-18 days):**
Probability would decrease slightly to ~0.05-0.06%. Shorter window provides less opportunity for the unlikely chain of events (crisis escalation → decision to use nuclear weapons → actual detonation in EU territory) to unfold.

**If timeframe were doubled (70 days):**
Probability would increase to ~0.12-0.15%. Longer window allows more opportunity for unexpected escalation, accidents during expanded arsenals post-treaty, or unforeseen crises. However, increase is sub-linear because expert consensus suggests 2026 overall is not high-risk year for NATO-Russia war.

**Key timeframe consideration:** 35 days is extremely short for major geopolitical shifts. EUISS expert survey (January 2026) explicitly assesses 2026 as year where direct NATO-Russia war is unlikely. Current European discussions focus on multi-year strategic posture changes, not imminent threats. No military operations in EU territory currently underway.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate:** 0.08% (established through historical analysis of zero detonations in EU territory across 80+ years, adjusted upward from pure historical rate to account for current tensions)

**Current factors and directional impact:**

**Factors suggesting LOWER probability than 0.08%:**

1. **Expert consensus more optimistic than expected** - January 2026 EUISS survey of 501 experts provides recent, large-sample assessment that NATO-Russia war is unlikely in 2026 and nuclear use is rated as lower probability than other threats. This is stronger evidence than anticipated in outside view, which relied on general historical patterns. Suggests 0.05-0.06% might be more appropriate.

2. **Revealed Russian behavior** - Despite 4 years of war and extensive rhetoric, Russia continues conventional operations. Bulletin analysis shows non-strategic weapons haven't increased as predicted. This demonstrates actual restraint exceeding rhetoric, supporting lower probability.

3. **Strategic ineffectiveness argument** - Named expert (Ukrainian Deputy FM) explicitly states conventional methods more effective than nuclear weapons. This provides causal mechanism for why nuclear use remains unlikely even in ongoing conflict.

**Factors suggesting HIGHER probability than 0.08%:**

1. **Treaty expiration just occurred** - New START expired 3 days ago (Feb 5, 2026). This removes verification mechanisms and legal constraints. However, impact is on medium-term (months/years) arsenal expansion, not immediate operational decisions. Modest upward pressure.

2. **Multiple simultaneous tensions** - Sources document Russia-Ukraine war, India-Pakistan conflict (May 2025), Iran strikes (June 2025), Russian drone incursions into NATO territory. Multiple flashpoints could theoretically increase accident/miscalculation risk. However, none of these incidents resulted in nuclear use, demonstrating resilience of deterrence.

**Calibration decision:**

The expert consensus from January 2026 (very recent, large sample, directly relevant) is the strongest new evidence. It suggests the current environment, while elevated from peacetime baseline, is NOT at acute crisis level for 2026. Experts explicitly do not expect NATO-Russia war this year.

However, I must avoid overconfidence. The outside view of 0.08% already incorporated elevated risk from current tensions. The expert survey confirms but doesn't dramatically change this assessment. Treaty expiration adds marginal risk.

The question asks specifically about detonation IN EU TERRITORY, which is narrower than "Russia uses nuclear weapon somewhere" (could be in Ukraine, test site, etc.). EU territory detonation requires:
- Deliberate attack on EU state (experts say NATO-Russia war unlikely in 2026), OR
- Accident during transport/storage in EU (safety mechanisms have prevented this historically even in severe accidents), OR  
- Non-state actor (no credible plots detected, material access extremely limited)

Each pathway is substantially constrained by evidence.

**Adjusted inside view:** 0.06-0.08%

I'll calibrate to **0.07%** - a modest downward adjustment from outside view based on:
1. Strong recent expert consensus (January 2026) that 2026 is not high-risk year for NATO-Russia war
2. Demonstrated Russian restraint pattern over 4 years despite rhetoric
3. Very short 35-day timeframe
4. Specific requirement for EU territory (not just "any nuclear use")

This represents 7 in 10,000 chance, or roughly 1 in 1,400 - still acknowledging elevated risk from current environment while incorporating expert assessment that acute crisis is unlikely in this timeframe.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 0.08%, I incorporate:

**Downward pressure (stronger evidence):**
- Recent expert survey (Jan 2026, 501 experts) explicitly assesses NATO-Russia war as unlikely in 2026
- 4-year pattern of Russian restraint despite rhetoric
- Strategic logic from conflict participants favoring conventional methods
- 35-day timeframe too short for major geopolitical shifts that would precede nuclear use

**Upward pressure (weaker evidence):**
- Treaty expiration 3 days ago removes some constraints (but affects medium-term, not immediate risk)
- Multiple ongoing tensions (but none have resulted in nuclear use, demonstrating deterrence resilience)

The expert consensus is the most significant new information, providing direct probabilistic assessment of 2026 risk environment. It confirms the outside view's assessment of elevated-but-still-very-low probability.

**Inside view prediction: 0.07%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will a nuclear weapon detonate in/above any of the 27 EU member states between now (Feb 8, 2026) and March 15, 2026 (35 days)?
   ✓ Analysis addresses deliberate, accidental, or unauthorized detonation in EU territory specifically within this timeframe.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 0.08% based on zero historical detonations in EU territory across 80+ years, adjusted upward for current tensions.
   ✓ Final prediction of 0.07% is rooted to this base rate with modest adjustment based on recent expert consensus confirming low acute risk in 2026.

3. **Consistency check:** "0.07 out of 100 times, a nuclear weapon detonates in EU territory in the next 35 days."
   ✓ This translates to roughly 1 in 1,400 chance, which aligns with: zero historical precedent + current elevated tensions + expert consensus that NATO-Russia war unlikely in 2026 + very short timeframe + multiple safety mechanisms + demonstrated Russian restraint pattern.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - **EUISS expert survey (Jan 2026, 501 experts):** NATO-Russia war unlikely in 2026, nuclear use rated lower probability than other threats [VERIFIED: Multiple sources confirm survey, credible organization]
   - **Historical safety record:** Zero detonations in EU territory across 80+ years including severe accidents [VERIFIED: Multiple independent sources, well-documented]
   - **Russian behavior pattern:** 4 years of Ukraine war with extensive nuclear rhetoric but zero use; continues conventional attacks [VERIFIED: Multiple credible sources document this pattern]

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Rapid, unexpected escalation from hybrid warfare incident (e.g., Russian drone accidentally kills NATO personnel, triggering Article 5 response, leading to miscalculation spiral within days). This scenario would make my forecast look too low. However, even in this scenario, probability of nuclear detonation IN EU TERRITORY (vs. other responses) remains constrained. Might shift probability to 0.1-0.15% but unlikely higher given expert consensus on 2026 overall risk.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current status quo is no nuclear detonations in EU territory, continuation of Russia-Ukraine conventional war, European strategic discussions about long-term deterrence. Given 35-day timeframe and expert assessment that 2026 is not acute crisis year, status quo continuation is overwhelmingly likely outcome (99.93%). Volatility assessment: Moderate tensions but not acute crisis; no military operations in EU territory currently. Status quo strongly favored.
