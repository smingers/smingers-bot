Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**European Union country profiles (european-union.europa.eu):** Official EU website listing current 27 member states. High reliability, establishes the geographic scope of the question. Factual, no opinions.

**DW article on Germany and nuclear weapons (2024):** German state broadcaster discussing nuclear weapons debate in Germany. High reliability. Contains expert opinions from Karl-Heinz Kamp (German Council on Foreign Relations) and Peter Rudolf (German Institute for International and Security Affairs), both credible sources. Key factual points: ~180 US nuclear weapons stored in Europe (20 in Germany), Germany legally bound by NPT and Two-Plus-Four Treaty. Expert consensus: German acquisition of nuclear weapons is "completely unrealistic." No information suggesting increased detonation risk.

**National Security Archive article (September 2020):** Historical analysis of 1950s-1960s US nuclear deployments in Europe. High reliability for historical context but dated and not relevant to 2026 forecasting. Purely factual historical record.

**BBC article on Palomares incident (April 2025):** Recent retrospective on 1966 accident in Spain. High reliability, BBC is credible source. Factual account of historical accident. Demonstrates that accidental nuclear detonations have not occurred even in severe accidents due to safety mechanisms. No forecasting relevance.

**EUISS Global Risks survey (January 19, 2026):** Published 20 days before today (Feb 8, 2026). Very high relevance and reliability - survey of 501 European security experts conducted November 2025. Key findings: Russia's use of nuclear weapon mentioned but experts assess it as LESS likely than US withdrawal of security guarantees. Experts do NOT expect direct NATO-Russia war in 2026. Greatest concern is "slow-burn actions" below Article 5 threshold. This is expert consensus opinion from credible, relevant sources.

**Pravda article on Putin nuclear testing (November 2025):** Reports Putin ordered exploration of resuming nuclear testing. Medium reliability (Ukrainian source reporting on Russian actions). Factual reporting of statements but discusses TESTING not detonation in EU territory. EU spokesperson response is factual.

**Guardian article on Ukraine minister warning (October 2025):** High reliability source. Contains named expert opinion from Sergiy Kyslytsya (Ukraine Deputy Foreign Minister). His statement explicitly suggests conventional hybrid warfare is MORE effective than nuclear weapons: "By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb." This expert opinion suggests nuclear use is not the preferred or likely escalation path.

**Agent Report on nuclear detonations:** Comprehensive historical analysis. Key facts: 2,061+ nuclear detonations worldwide since 1945, ZERO on EU territory. Only one plutonium dispersal accident (Palomares 1966) in current EU territory - no nuclear yield occurred. All nuclear powers except North Korea have observed test moratoria since 1990s. Russian threats 2022-2026 documented but characterized as rhetoric rather than operational preparation. No credible non-state actor plots with fissile material detected.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: Nuclear detonations in developed nations post-1945**
- Base rate: 0 events in 80+ years across all developed nations
- Suitability: High - EU members are developed nations with similar security environments
- Limitation: Doesn't account for current geopolitical tensions

**Reference Class 2: Nuclear detonations on any sovereign territory (excluding test sites) post-1945**
- Base rate: 2 events (Hiroshima, Nagasaki) in 80+ years = ~0.025 per year globally
- Suitability: Medium - overly broad, includes wartime conditions unlike current EU situation
- Limitation: Those were deliberate wartime uses; modern context vastly different

**Reference Class 3: Nuclear accidents resulting in yield on inhabited territory**
- Base rate: 0 events in 80+ years despite numerous "Broken Arrow" incidents
- Suitability: Very high - directly relevant to accidental detonation scenario
- Key insight: Even severe accidents (Palomares, Lakenheath) did not produce nuclear yields due to safety mechanisms

**Reference Class 4: Russian nuclear threats followed by actual use**
- Base rate: Thousands of Cold War threats, zero uses; 2022-2026 threats, zero uses
- Suitability: High - directly addresses current threat environment
- Key insight: Rhetoric-to-action ratio is extremely low

**Most suitable reference class:** Combined analysis of Reference Classes 3 and 4 - examining both accidental scenarios and deliberate use following threats in modern security environment.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 35 days (February 8, 2026 to March 15, 2026)

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- In 80+ years since nuclear weapons existed, zero detonations in Western European territory
- In 35-day windows during heightened Cold War tensions (Cuban Missile Crisis, Able Archer 83, etc.), no detonations occurred in Europe
- Current Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted ~4 years with extensive Russian nuclear rhetoric but zero nuclear use
- Expert survey from January 2026 assesses direct NATO-Russia war (which would be prerequisite for most scenarios) as unlikely in 2026

**Relevant timeframe considerations:**
- 35 days is extremely short for major geopolitical shifts
- No current military operations in EU territory
- No indication of imminent Russian military action against EU states (EUISS survey emphasizes "slow-burn" hybrid warfare, not conventional attack)
- Non-state actor scenarios require material acquisition and operational preparation measured in months/years, not weeks

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view strongly suggests an extremely low probability:

1. **Historical precedent:** Zero nuclear detonations in EU territory across 80+ years, despite numerous opportunities (accidents, Cold War crises, current tensions).

2. **Expert consensus:** January 2026 survey of 501 European security experts rates Russian nuclear use as lower probability than other threats. Experts explicitly do NOT expect NATO-Russia war in 2026.

3. **Technical barriers:** Nuclear weapons have multiple safety mechanisms. Even severe accidents (Palomares) did not produce yields. Non-state actors lack fissile material access.

4. **Strategic logic:** Ukrainian Deputy FM explicitly states conventional hybrid warfare is more effective than nuclear weapons. Russia achieving objectives through "slow-burn" actions below Article 5 threshold.

5. **Current threat assessment:** No indication of imminent military operations in EU territory. Russian focus remains on Ukraine, with hybrid operations (drones, cyber) against EU rather than kinetic/nuclear action.

6. **Timeframe:** 35 days is insufficient for the geopolitical shifts that would precede nuclear use (major conventional war escalation, complete breakdown of deterrence).

The primary scenarios would be: (1) Accidental detonation - but safety mechanisms have prevented this in far more severe historical accidents; (2) Deliberate Russian use - but no military operations in EU territory and expert consensus this is unlikely; (3) Non-state actor - but no credible plots detected and material access remains extremely low.

**Outside view calibration:**

The base rate from the most relevant reference class (nuclear detonations in developed nations post-1945) is 0 in 80+ years. For EU specifically: 0 in its entire existence.

However, I must avoid the fallacy of assigning exactly 0% to any possibility. The current geopolitical environment (Russia-Ukraine war, Russian nuclear rhetoric) does represent elevated risk compared to peacetime baseline, even if expert consensus suggests this risk is lower than other threats.

For a 35-day window:
- Annual probability in peacetime: ~0.001% (1 in 100,000 years based on historical record)
- Current elevated environment might increase this by a factor of 10-100x
- This yields roughly 0.01-0.1% annual probability
- For 35 days (9.6% of a year): 0.001-0.01% probability

The EUISS expert survey provides implicit calibration: experts rate Russian nuclear use as less likely than US security withdrawal, which itself is rated as high but not certain for 2026. If US withdrawal is ~20-40% likely for the year and nuclear use is notably less likely, this suggests annual nuclear use probability well below 10%, likely in the 1-5% range for the year. For 35 days: 0.1-0.5%.

However, the question asks about detonation in EU territory specifically (not just Russian nuclear use generally, which could occur in Ukraine). This is a narrower scenario requiring either: (1) Russian attack on EU state, (2) accident during transport/storage in EU, or (3) non-state actor. Each of these is substantially less likely than "Russia uses nuclear weapon somewhere."

Balancing extreme historical rarity, expert assessment of low probability, short timeframe, and avoiding overconfidence in exactly 0%:
