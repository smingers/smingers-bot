Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - 2026 Doomsday Clock Statement (Nuclear Risk)**
High-quality source from a recognized nonprofit focused on nuclear risk. Published 2026, so current. Key facts: Russian drone incursions into NATO countries in 2025; European debates on Euro-deterrent using French/UK arsenals; Russia-Ukraine war continuing with nuclear threats; India-Pakistan conflict May 2025 with nuclear brinkmanship; Israel/US attacks on Iranian facilities June 2025; North Korean build-up. Expert opinions from the organization itself (not individually named experts), noting "rapidly increasing" nuclear risks globally. Factual on events; opinions on risk assessment are institutional.

**CFR Article - "Europe Faces Uncertainty as New START Ends"**
High-quality source (Council on Foreign Relations). Published Feb 6, 2026. Key facts: New START expired Feb 5, 2026; France has 290 warheads, UK has 225; Northwood Declaration July 2025 deepened UK-France nuclear cooperation. Named expert opinions: Kaja Kallas (EU foreign policy chief) on NATO needing to become "more European"; Admiral Tony Radakin on dangers of unraveling agreements; Astrid Chevreuil and Oliver Meier (security experts) on European concerns. Strong factual basis; expert opinions are identifiable and credible.

**Inkstick Media - "What Will the End of the US-Russia Nuclear Arms Treaty Mean?"**
Moderate-quality source (independent media outlet). Published Jan 12, 2026. Key facts: New START expires Feb 5, 2026; Russia has 333 ICBMs, 192 SLBMs, 67 strategic bombers; could rapidly increase deployed weapons after treaty expiration; Russia developing Poseidon torpedo (deployment 2027) and Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle. Factual information appears solid but article incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence). No individually named expert opinions.

**Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - "Russian nuclear weapons, 2025"**
High-quality source. Published May 13, 2025 (9 months old). Authors: Hans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Eliana Johns, Mackenzie Knight-Boyle (recognized nuclear weapons experts). Key facts: Russia has ~4,309 warheads total; ~1,718 deployed strategic warheads; modernization facing delays; nuclear storage site in Belarus nearing completion. Strong factual basis with transparent methodology. Expert analysis from identifiable, credible sources.

**Sky News - Ukraine war latest**
Mainstream media source. Current (Feb 2026). Key facts: Russia launched 400+ drones and ~40 missiles targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure; temperatures to -30°C; 600,000 people left Kyiv; 1,300 "invincibility points" opened. Quotes from Zelenskyy, Denys Shmyhal, Michael Clarke (military analyst). Factual on attacks; no direct nuclear detonation threats to EU territory.

**Economic Times - Nuclear war simulation**
Moderate-quality source. Published date unclear but references 2026. Key facts: Princeton "Plan A" simulation estimates 90+ million casualties in first hours of US-Russia nuclear war; 2.6 million in first three hours; Europe would be "devastated." Quote from Alicia Sanders-Zakre (ICAN) on rejecting nuclear scenarios. This is a simulation/model, not current events. Useful for understanding consequences but not predictive of actual probability.

**AskNews Articles (multiple sources):**
- Multiple European sources (Il Mattino, Bluewin, CFR, Yle.fi, etc.) from Feb 5-6, 2026 covering New START expiration
- Key recurring facts: Treaty expired Feb 5, 2026; European discussions on independent nuclear deterrence (Germany, Sweden, Poland); Kallas calling for European nuclear debate; Macron proposing European nuclear umbrella
- Named sources: Kaja Kallas (EU foreign policy chief), Friedrich Merz (German Chancellor), Ulf Kristersson (Swedish PM), Donald Tusk (Polish PM), Emmanuel Macron (French President)
- Consensus: European anxiety about US reliability, discussions of Euro-deterrent, but all discussions are preliminary with no immediate action

**Quality Assessment:** Most sources are high-quality (CFR, Bulletin, mainstream media). Information is current (mostly Feb 2026). Key limitation: much content is about discussions and proposals, not actual nuclear deployments or imminent threats to EU territory.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence (Status Quo Continuation):**
- Historical record: Zero nuclear detonations on EU territory in 81 years (multiple sources confirm)
- Structural constraints: Only France has operational warheads on EU soil; US B-61 bombs under strict US control with permissive-action-links (multiple sources)
- Treaty expiration timing: New START expired Feb 5, 2026 - only 3 days before forecast opening, 38 days before resolution. Even if Russia/US wanted to expand arsenals, physical deployment takes months-to-years (Bulletin source: "hours/days for bombers, months for submarines, years for ICBMs")
- Expert consensus: EUISS survey of 501 experts ranks Russian nuclear use as "high-impact but significantly less likely" than other 2026 risks
- No credible near-term threats: Ukraine war continues but attacks target Ukrainian infrastructure, not EU territory (Sky News)

**Moderate Evidence (Elevated Risk Factors):**
- Deteriorating arms control: New START expiration removes transparency and verification (CFR, Inkstick, multiple AskNews sources)
- Increased nuclear rhetoric: Russian threats during Ukraine war (Bulletin, multiple sources)
- European anxiety: Multiple countries discussing independent deterrents suggests perceived elevated risk (CFR, multiple AskNews sources)
- Geopolitical instability: India-Pakistan conflict May 2025, Israel-Iran strikes June 2025 show global nuclear tensions (Bulletin)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Simulation studies: Princeton "Plan A" model shows consequences but not probability (Economic Times)
- Political statements: Kallas, Merz, Tusk statements about European nuclear options are discussions, not indicators of imminent use
- Doomsday Clock: Now at 85 seconds to midnight, but this is a symbolic assessment, not a probability forecast

**Evidence Weight Assessment:**
The strong evidence overwhelmingly supports status quo (no detonation). The moderate evidence shows elevated background risk but no specific mechanisms for EU-territory detonation in the next 36 days. The weak evidence is largely atmospheric.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Timeframe:** 36 days (Feb 8 to March 15, 2026)

**If halved to 18 days:** Would strengthen status quo prediction. Nuclear escalation requires either deliberate decision-making with preparation time OR catastrophic accident. 18 days provides even less time for deliberate pathways and accident probability scales roughly linearly with time exposure.

**If doubled to 72 days:** Would modestly increase risk. Longer timeframe allows more opportunities for: (1) accidental/unauthorized use during increased military activity, (2) escalation of Ukraine conflict toward NATO/EU territory, (3) terrorist acquisition of material. However, even at 72 days (2.5 months), the probability would remain very low given structural constraints.

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- New START just expired (Feb 5) - effects on deployments take months/years to materialize
- No immediate crisis requiring nuclear response within EU territory
- Winter 2025-26 Ukraine attacks target Ukrainian infrastructure, not expanding geographically
- European nuclear discussions are preliminary (years away from implementation)

**(d) Justification:**

**Factors Supporting Status Quo (No Detonation):**

1. **Structural impossibility of most pathways:** Only France possesses operational nuclear weapons on EU soil. US weapons are under strict dual-key control. Russia would need to deliberately target EU territory (massive escalation beyond Ukraine) or conduct a test over EU airspace (unprecedented and irrational). Neither pathway has supporting evidence in current situation.

2. **No tactical/strategic rationale:** Russia's Ukraine campaign, while involving nuclear threats, has not required actual use even in Ukraine. Using a weapon on EU/NATO territory would trigger Article 5 response and potential US nuclear retaliation - catastrophic for Russia. The cost-benefit calculation remains prohibitive.

3. **Time constraints:** 36 days is extremely short for nuclear escalation pathways. Even if Russia decided today to strike EU territory, operational planning, authorization, and execution would be detectable and likely interrupted.

4. **Expert consensus:** Multiple credible experts (EUISS survey, security scholars in CFR article) assess nuclear use as unlikely despite elevated rhetoric. This aligns with outside view.

**Factors Suggesting Modest Risk Elevation:**

1. **Arms control collapse:** New START expiration removes transparency, potentially enabling miscalculation. However, effects are longer-term, not immediate.

2. **Heightened tensions:** Ukraine war, European anxiety, Russian rhetoric all suggest elevated background risk compared to, say, 2015. This might justify moving from 0.03% to perhaps 0.05-0.10%.

3. **Accident risk:** Increased military activity (Russian drones near NATO territory, more weapons movements) marginally increases accident probability. However, modern safety systems make accidental yield extremely unlikely.

**Calibration Reasoning:**

Outside view base rate: 0.03% (1 in ~3,300)

Current situation assessment:
- No specific indicators of imminent threat to EU territory
- Structural constraints remain fully in place
- 36-day window is very short
- Expert consensus supports low probability

However, the current environment is marginally more dangerous than historical average due to:
- Active major war (Ukraine) with nuclear-armed belligerent
- Arms control collapse creating uncertainty
- Increased military activity near EU borders

Adjustment: Increase outside view by factor of ~2-3x to account for elevated but still very low risk.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view of 0.03%, I assess current circumstances warrant approximately 2.5x multiplier:

- Arms control collapse: +30% relative increase
- Ukraine war proximity: +50% relative increase  
- Increased military activity: +20% relative increase
- Expert assessments of elevated risk: +30% relative increase
- Offset by: Structural constraints unchanged (-10%), very short timeframe (-10%)

Net adjustment: ~2.5x multiplier

0.03% × 2.5 = 0.075%

Rounding to reflect appropriate precision given uncertainty: **0.08%** (approximately 1 in 1,250)

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will any nuclear weapon detonate in/above an EU member state by March 15, 2026 (36 days)? Includes deliberate, inadvertent, or accidental detonations.
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria exactly.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 0.03% based on zero historical detonations on EU territory over 81 years, adjusted for Bayesian uncertainty.
   - ✓ Final prediction (0.08%) is rooted in this base rate with modest upward adjustment for current circumstances.

3. **Consistency check:** "0.08 out of 100 times, a nuclear weapon detonates in/above an EU state by March 15, 2026."
   - ✓ This translates to roughly 1 in 1,250 chance. Given zero historical precedent, extremely short timeframe, and strong structural constraints, this seems appropriately low while acknowledging modestly elevated current risk.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Zero historical detonations on EU territory in 81 years (factually verified, multiple sources)
   - Only France has operational warheads on EU soil; US weapons under strict dual-key control (CFR, Bulletin sources)
   - New START expired Feb 5, but deployment changes take months/years (Bulletin expert assessment)
   - Expert survey ranks Russian nuclear use as unlikely despite rhetoric (EUISS, 501 experts)
   - No credible indicators of imminent threat to EU territory in 36-day window (comprehensive source review)
   - ✓ All evidence pieces are factually solid and from credible sources.

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Rapid, unexpected escalation of Ukraine conflict to direct Russia-NATO confrontation involving tactical nuclear use on EU border territory (e.g., Poland, Baltic states). This could occur if: (a) major Ukrainian offensive using Western weapons strikes deep into Russia, (b) Russia retaliates against NATO supply routes on EU soil, (c) miscalculation leads to tactical nuclear demonstration. Probability: Still very low (<0.5%) but higher than base case. Would increase forecast to ~0.3-0.5%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is no detonation. Given 81-year precedent, 36-day window, and lack of specific near-term indicators, status quo is overwhelmingly likely. Current volatility (Ukraine war, arms control collapse) is elevated but not unprecedented (cf. Cuban Missile Crisis, 1980s tensions). Slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate - my 0.08% already reflects this.

**Probability: 0.08%**
