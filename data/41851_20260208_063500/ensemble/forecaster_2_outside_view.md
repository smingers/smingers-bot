Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

1. **EU Countries List (european-union.europa.eu)** - Official EU source listing 27 member states. High quality, factual reference material. Establishes the geographic scope for the question.

2. **Germany and Nuclear Weapons (DW, date unclear but references Trump's first term suggestions)** - German media analysis. Provides factual information about ~180 US nuclear weapons stored in Europe (20 in Germany). Expert opinions from Karl-Heinz Kamp and Peter Rudolf emphasize Germany's legal constraints and the impracticality of German nuclear acquisition. High-quality named expert opinions.

3. **US Nuclear Presence in Western Europe 1954-1962 (National Security Archive, Sept 2020)** - Historical archival document. Excellent quality for historical context but not relevant to 2026 forecasting. Shows historical peak of ~4,000 US weapons in NATO Europe, now reduced to ~150.

4. **Palomares Incident (BBC, April 2025)** - Historical retrospective of 1966 accident. High-quality journalism documenting the only significant nuclear weapons accident on current EU territory. Factual account showing that even in accidents, safeguards prevented nuclear detonation (only conventional explosive dispersal of plutonium occurred).

5. **Global Risks to EU in 2026 (EUISS, Jan 19, 2026)** - **CRITICAL SOURCE**. Published just 20 days before today (Feb 8, 2026), covering the exact timeframe of our question. Survey of 501 European security experts. Key finding: experts rate "Russia's use of a nuclear weapon" as having severe impact BUT being "significantly more likely" than direct NATO-Russia war, which itself is considered unlikely. The survey does NOT list nuclear detonation in EU territory among the top risks identified. Instead, top risks are: critical infrastructure attacks, Russian aggression (conventional), US security guarantee withdrawal, and China-Taiwan conflict.

6. **EU Response to Putin's Nuclear Testing (Pravda, Nov 2025)** - Reports Putin ordered exploration of resuming nuclear testing and Russia tested nuclear-powered cruise missile. EU spokesperson's response is diplomatic condemnation. No indication of actual detonation plans in EU territory. The article discusses testing preparations, not operational use.

7. **Europe Threat Assessment (Guardian, Oct 2025)** - Ukrainian Deputy FM Kyslytsya's opinion that Russia is conducting hybrid warfare against Europe. Notable quote: "By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb" - suggesting Russia sees non-nuclear methods as more effective. High-quality source but represents Ukrainian government perspective.

8. **Agent Report on Nuclear Detonations** - Comprehensive compilation showing:
   - 2,061+ nuclear detonations globally, all tests except 2 wartime uses
   - Zero nuclear yields ever on EU territory
   - One major accident (Palomares 1966) with conventional explosive dispersal only
   - Last nuclear test by recognized powers: 1996 (China, France) or earlier
   - Russian threats 2022-2026 documented but rhetorical
   - No credible non-state actor plots involving fissile material 2022-2026

**Key Expert Opinions (Named):**
- Karl-Heinz Kamp: Nuclear debate is "very German," Germany legally constrained by NPT
- Peter Rudolf: German nuclear weapons "completely unrealistic"
- Sergiy Kyslytsya: Cyber/hybrid warfare more effective than nuclear weapons
- 501 EUISS survey experts: Nuclear use by Russia rated as high-impact but significantly less likely than other top risks

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Nuclear detonations in sovereign European territory (historical)**: Zero occurrences ever. Extremely relevant but limited data.

2. **Nuclear weapons accidents in EU territory**: Palomares 1966 is the only major incident; safeguards prevented nuclear yield even when conventional explosives detonated. Relevant for understanding safety mechanisms.

3. **Nuclear weapon use in warfare since 1945**: Only 2 instances (Hiroshima, Nagasaki), both in 1945. Zero uses in 81 years despite numerous conflicts. Highly relevant base rate.

4. **Nuclear testing by recognized powers since 1996**: Zero tests by US, Russia, France, UK, China since 1996 (30 years). Only North Korea has tested (6 times, all in its own territory). Relevant for understanding current norms.

5. **Russian nuclear threats followed by actual use**: Extensive rhetoric 2022-2026, zero actual uses. Relevant for calibrating threat assessment.

**Most suitable reference class:** Nuclear weapon use in warfare since 1945, combined with nuclear detonations on European soil (historical). This provides the broadest and most relevant base rate: 2 uses in 81 years globally, 0 uses ever in Europe, despite numerous conflicts and crises.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 35 days (February 8, 2026 to March 15, 2026)

**Historical patterns:**
- Over 81 years (1945-2026): 2 nuclear weapons used in warfare = 0.025 per year = 0.0024% probability per 35-day period (purely mathematical)
- Over 81 years in Europe specifically: 0 nuclear detonations
- In the current crisis period (Feb 2022-Feb 2026, ~4 years): Despite unprecedented Russian nuclear rhetoric and the largest European land war since WWII, zero nuclear weapons used
- In periods of similar Cold War tension (Cuban Missile Crisis 1962, Able Archer 1983): Zero nuclear uses despite higher alert levels

The 35-day timeframe is extremely short. The EUISS survey from Jan 19, 2026 covering security threats for 2026 does not list nuclear detonation in EU territory among top concerns, despite surveying 501 experts specifically focused on EU security.

(d) **Justification:**

**Factors suggesting extremely low probability:**

1. **Historical base rate**: Zero nuclear weapons ever detonated on European soil in 81 years, including through two world wars, the Cold War, and current Ukraine conflict.

2. **Recent expert assessment**: The Jan 2026 EUISS survey of 501 European security experts does not rank nuclear detonation in EU territory among the top risks for 2026, despite specifically assessing Russian threats.

3. **Accident safeguards**: Even in the Palomares accident, multiple safety mechanisms prevented nuclear yield despite conventional explosive detonation.

4. **Strategic logic**: Multiple sources note that Russia views hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, and infrastructure sabotage as more effective than nuclear use. Ukrainian official Kyslytsya explicitly states drones "achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb."

5. **Deterrence remains intact**: Despite US political uncertainty, experts assess NATO deterrence as still functional, making direct NATO-Russia war unlikely in 2026.

6. **Time window**: Only 35 days, reducing probability proportionally.

7. **Escalation patterns**: Russian nuclear threats 2022-2026 have been rhetorical; actual military actions have remained conventional even in the most intense phases of the Ukraine war.

**Factors that could increase probability (but remain unlikely):**

1. **Accidental/unauthorized use**: Historical accidents show this is possible but safeguards have always prevented yield
2. **Tactical weapon in Ukraine escalation**: Could theoretically affect EU if used near borders, but resolution criteria requires detonation "in or above" EU territory
3. **Non-state actor**: Agent report confirms no credible plots with fissile material 2022-2026
4. **Deliberate Russian strike**: Would trigger Article 5, making it strategically irrational; experts rate as very low probability

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**

1. **Historical base rate calculation**: 0 detonations in EU territory over 81 years. Even using the global warfare rate (2 uses in 81 years = 2.47% per year), this would translate to approximately 0.24% over 35 days. However, this overstates probability because:
   - Those 2 uses occurred in unique historical circumstances (end of WWII, no nuclear adversary)
   - Europe has never experienced nuclear use despite more severe crises
   - Current deterrence structures didn't exist in 1945

2. **Expert survey tethering**: The EUISS survey rates various risks but notably does NOT place nuclear detonation in EU among top-tier concerns for 2026, despite covering the exact timeframe. This suggests expert consensus probability is very low.

3. **Accident rate**: One major accident (Palomares) in ~60 years of US nuclear presence in Europe = ~1.67% annual accident rate. Even if we assume 10% of accidents could lead to yield (generous given safety record), that's 0.167% annually or 0.016% over 35 days.

4. **Calibration for unexpected events**: Nuclear domain has shown remarkable stability - the "no use since 1945" norm has held through numerous crises that seemed potentially escalatory. However, we're in an unprecedented period of explicit Russian nuclear threats combined with major European war.

5. **Precision vs. hedging**: Given the 35-day timeframe and complete absence of historical precedent in Europe, the probability should be well below 1%. However, we're in an active crisis period with documented Russian nuclear posturing, so it shouldn't be infinitesimal.

**Calibrated estimate reasoning:**
- Base rate from European history: ~0%
- Adjustment for current crisis: Small increase
- Adjustment for 35-day window: Proportional reduction
- Adjustment for expert assessment (EUISS): Confirms very low probability
- Accident pathway: ~0.016% over 35 days
- Deliberate use pathway: Even lower given deterrence

Considering all factors, a probability in the range of 0.01% to 0.1% seems appropriate. The lower end reflects historical precedent; the higher end acknowledges current elevated tensions. Given that expert surveys don't flag this as a top concern even during the crisis, I lean toward the lower end of this range.
