Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria  
Will any nuclear weapon (deliberate, accidental, or unauthorized) produce a nuclear-yield detonation in or above the territory of an EU member state between Feb 8, 2026 and Mar 15, 2026 (by 18:00)?

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; what is fact vs opinion)
- Bulletin (Doomsday Clock 2026 statement; Nuclear Risk) (Jan 2026 statement; high-reputation nonprofit, but partly judgment/opinion): Facts: notes continued Russia-Ukraine war, drone incursions, nuclear-risk dynamics, broader arms-race signals. Opinions: “risk is high” framing; no specific claim of imminent EU-territory detonation.
- CFR: “Europe Faces Uncertainty as New START Ends” (Feb 2026; strong quality think tank/expert reporting): Facts: New START expired Feb 5, 2026; Europe debating “Euro-deterrent,” UK–France cooperation (Northwood Declaration July 2025), warhead numbers. Opinions: experts warn architecture is “delicate/dangerous.” Useful for mechanism: less transparency/communication could raise miscalculation risk.
- Inkstick (Jan 12, 2026; credible analysis outlet but more advocacy/argumentative): Facts: treaty expiration, potential for warhead “upload,” modernization lists. Opinion/interpretation: increased likelihood of nuclear conflict; less directly tied to “detonation in EU by Mar 15.”
- Bulletin: “Russian nuclear weapons, 2025” (May 2025; very strong technical source): Facts: Russian stockpile estimates; New START suspension; ability to upload warheads; Belarus storage site nearing completion. No indication of imminent use; mainly capability and posture.
- Sky News live/blog summary (date near early Feb 2026; mainstream but live-blog format = mixed rigor): Facts: large Russian drone/missile attacks on Ukraine energy infrastructure; severe winter pressures. Not direct evidence of nuclear preparations; indicates continued conventional escalation and stress.
- Economic Times simulation write-up (low-moderate relevance; largely sensational repackaging of a known Princeton/SGS visualization): Facts: simulation exists; not predictive evidence. Weak for forecasting near-term real-world detonation.
- AskNews: Il Mattino / Correio Braziliense commentary on New START ending (Feb 6, 2026; mixed—op-eds): Facts: treaty expired; general arms race concerns. Opinions: “abyss/darker” rhetoric; not actionable indicators.
- AskNews: Bluewin explainer on “European nuclear umbrella” (Feb 6, 2026; secondary reporting): Facts: US B61 presence in Europe (approx. ~100), political/legal barriers to new European nuclear forces. Mostly medium relevance; doesn’t raise near-term detonation risk.
- AskNews: RT en Español / Rambler / Tsargrad / REN TV items (Feb 2026/Jan 2026; state/partisan media, lower reliability): Facts may be partially correct (Kallas comments reported elsewhere), but narratives are slanted. I treat these as weak-to-moderate unless corroborated by higher-quality outlets.
- AskNews: RBC (Oct 30, 2025) on EU reaction to Trump resuming nuclear testing; and related items (mixed): Even if testing rhetoric exists, likely US testing would be in US territory; does not mechanically imply EU-territory nuclear detonation before Mar 15.
- AFP (Sep 26, 2025) on Iran/JCPOA snapback timing (high quality): Facts: Iran enriched uranium stockpile figures; diplomatic process. Mechanism to EU detonation by Mar 15 is extremely indirect; weak near-term relevance.

Bottom line on sources: they support “higher global nuclear risk / degraded arms control,” but provide no specific, credible, time-bound indicators for a nuclear detonation in/above an EU state within ~5 weeks.

(b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system
Strong evidence (large shift potential)
- None pointing toward an imminent EU-territory nuclear detonation. There is no strong, specific indicator like (i) credible intel leaks of nuclear employment plans, (ii) observed nuclear weapon mating/dispersal consistent with near-term use, (iii) explicit operational alerts paired with crisis triggers involving EU territory.

Moderate evidence (moderate shift)
- New START expiration (CFR + multiple outlets): structural loss of transparency/verification and risk-reduction channels. This modestly increases background miscalculation/arms-race risk, but the causal path to “EU detonation within 36 days” is still long.
- Continued Russia–Ukraine strikes and NATO–Russia friction (Bulletin + Sky): ongoing high-tempo conflict environment increases tail risk of escalation, including inadvertent spillover.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- Political debate about European nuclear umbrella (multiple): mostly about long-run deterrence/proliferation; little bearing on detonation by Mar 15.
- Sensational simulations/op-eds: illustrate consequences, not probability.
- State/partisan media framing: noisy, not operational indicators.

Key causal pathways to “YES” and why they remain low-probability in this window
1) Deliberate Russian nuclear use on EU/NATO territory (incl. Baltic/Poland/etc.)  
Requires a major escalation step likely triggering Article 5 and risking regime-ending retaliation. Absent clear signs of imminent NATO–Russia direct war, this remains extremely unlikely in 36 days.
2) Nuclear detonation over EU via accident/unauthorized launch (Russia, US, France/UK)  
Historical safeguards and command-and-control make this very low; nothing in sources indicates acute C2 breakdown or specific accident risk.
3) Terrorist nuclear device in an EU state  
No credible reporting here indicating fissile-material acquisition or an advanced plot; short timeline makes it even less likely.
4) Nuclear test in/over an EU state  
Effectively zero: no EU state is a likely testing venue; nuclear states test (if they do) on their own territory/remote sites.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: ~36 days (Feb 8 → Mar 15, 2026).
- If the timeframe were halved (~18 days): probability should drop meaningfully (roughly ~30–45% lower) because most plausible pathways require multiple steps and escalation time; I’d move from ~0.04% to ~0.02–0.03%.
- If the timeframe were doubled (~72 days): probability rises, but not linearly (tail risk grows with more time for shocks); I’d move to ~0.06–0.09% absent major new escalatory indicators.

(d) Justification (inside view shift from the outside view base rate)
Outside view base rate provided: 0.03% for a detonation in/above an EU member state within this short window.

What’s changed / what current info suggests:
- Upward pressure (small): New START has now actually expired (no longer just “will expire”), removing a key stabilizing framework and possibly increasing misperception risk at the margin. The Russia–Ukraine conflict remains intense, with large-scale strikes and ongoing NATO–Russia friction.
- Downward/anchoring pressure (dominant): No credible, specific indicators of imminent nuclear use on EU territory; nuclear use would be strategically discontinuous with enormous expected costs; and most news is about long-run posture/proliferation debate rather than near-term operational moves.

Net: I make only a small upward adjustment from 0.03% to 0.04% to reflect the marginally worse risk-reduction environment post–New START expiration while keeping the probability firmly in the “extreme tail” given the lack of proximate triggers for EU-territory detonation.

Probability calibration
- Outside view anchor: 0.03%
- Adjustments:
  - +0.01%: New START expiration + reduced transparency/communication (moderate structural risk factor, but weak link to EU detonation in 36 days)
  - +0.005%: ongoing high-tempo Russia–Ukraine strikes and general escalation climate
  - −0.005%: absence of specific imminent-use indicators; deterrence/strategic discontinuity remains strong in this short window
- Inside view result (rounded): 0.04%

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: Nuclear-yield detonation in/above any EU member state, any cause, by Mar 15, 2026 18:00.  
2) Outside view base rate: 0.03%.  
3) Consistency line: “0.04 out of 100 times, a nuclear weapon detonates in/above an EU state in the next 36 days.”  
4) Most significant evidence (3–5):
   - New START expired Feb 5, 2026 (CFR; multiple reports), reducing risk-reduction/verification.
   - Continued Russia–Ukraine war with large-scale strikes and heightened regional friction (Bulletin; Sky).
   - No credible, time-bound operational indicators of imminent nuclear use on EU territory (across sources).
   - Strong deterrence logic: EU/NATO territory strike is massively escalatory (inferred from strategic context).
5) Blind spot: A rapid, unexpected NATO–Russia direct clash (e.g., misattributed strike/drone incident) causing fast nuclear escalation; this would raise the probability sharply (order(s) of magnitude).  
6) Status quo outcome: Continued conventional conflict + political nuclear debate, without nuclear detonation; status quo strongly favors “No” in a 36-day window.

Probability: 0.04%
