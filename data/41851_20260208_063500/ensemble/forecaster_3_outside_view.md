Analysis:
### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality/date + facts vs opinions)
1. **EU “Country profiles” list (EU official site; evergreen reference)**
   - **What it provides (facts):** The set of EU member states that define the geographic resolution criteria.
   - **Quality:** High for membership facts; not informative about nuclear risk levels.

2. **DW: “Germany and nuclear weapons: A difficult history” (Deutsche Welle; Feb 2024-ish context, retrieved here as background)**
   - **Facts:** Claims ~180 US nuclear weapons stored in Europe; ~20 at Büchel, Germany; US President retains launch authority.
   - **Opinions (attributed experts):** German acquisition of nuclear weapons “unrealistic,” legal/political barriers.
   - **Quality:** Generally reliable journalism; the specific stockpile numbers are widely cited but inherently somewhat uncertain. Mostly useful to underscore that nuclear weapons are present in/near EU territory without implying detonation likelihood.

3. **National Security Archive: US nuclear presence in Western Europe 1954–1962 (2020; archival/historical)**
   - **Facts:** Large Cold War forward deployment and historical command-and-control concerns; PALs introduced to reduce unauthorized use.
   - **Quality:** High-quality archival secondary source; mostly indicates that even in higher-risk eras, safeguards evolved and unauthorized detonation risk has been managed downward over time.

4. **BBC Culture: Palomares 1966 accident retrospective (Apr 2025; historical)**
   - **Facts:** High-explosive detonations dispersed plutonium; **no nuclear yield**.
   - **Quality:** Strong mainstream source; relevant as a reminder that “nuclear weapon involved” ≠ “nuclear detonation.”

5. **EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS): Global risks to the EU in 2026 (Jan 19, 2026; survey of 501 experts)**
   - **Facts:** Experts rank various risks; they do **not** expect direct NATO–Russia war; “Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon” is discussed as very high impact but **less likely** than other scenarios (e.g., US security withdrawal).
   - **Opinions:** Aggregated expert judgment; not a quantified probability.
   - **Quality:** Good for “expert climate” and relative likelihood ordering; limited for numeric calibration.

6. **European Pravda: EU response to Putin order re: exploring resuming nuclear testing (Nov 2025; contemporary reporting)**
   - **Facts:** Reports political statements about exploring nuclear testing; EU urges restraint.
   - **Quality:** Useful for noting escalatory rhetoric and testing chatter; still not evidence of imminent detonation in/over EU.

7. **The Guardian: Ukraine official warning about Russian hybrid war (Oct 2025; contemporary)**
   - **Facts:** Describes alleged hybrid incidents (drones, airspace violations) and political warnings.
   - **Opinions:** Strongly framed claims by an identifiable Ukrainian official; not direct evidence of nuclear intent or capability to detonate in EU territory.
   - **Quality:** Good journalism, but the most alarming parts are allegations/perspective statements.

8. **Agent_report (mixed internet + LLM synthesis; caution required)**
   - **Facts summarized:** ~2,061 nuclear detonations historically (mostly tests); none on EU soil; Palomares and Lakenheath as “broken arrow/near miss” cases; ongoing Russian nuclear threats; non-state actor intent but low capability.
   - **Quality:** Directionally consistent with well-known public facts, but because it’s a compiled memo (and partly LLM-derived), I treat it as **contextual** rather than definitive for any single contested claim.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)
Plausible reference classes and suitability:

1. **“Nuclear weapon detonated on the territory of an EU member state” (post-1945)**
   - Observed frequency: **0 events**.
   - Suitability: Perfect geographic match, but extremely sparse data → can’t naively set probability to 0; must use smoothing/judgment.

2. **“Any nuclear weapon detonation worldwide (tests + wartime use) per unit time”**
   - Observed frequency: many during Cold War; far fewer post-1990; last known test 2017 (per common open sources).
   - Suitability: Good for bounding how rare detonations are in the modern era, but location differs (tests occur at established ranges, not EU).

3. **“Accidental/unauthorized nuclear yield events”**
   - Observed frequency: essentially **0 known** (despite multiple serious accidents with conventional HE explosions/contamination).
   - Suitability: Relevant to the question’s inclusion of accidental/unauthorized detonation; suggests yield accidents are extraordinarily rare.

**Most suitable outside-view baseline:** Combine (1) and (2): detonations are rare in the contemporary era, and **detonations in EU territory are even rarer** (none historically), implying a very low base rate.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** From **2026-02-08 to 2026-03-15**, about **35 days**.
- **Historical pattern over ~1-month windows:**
  - Since 1945, nuclear detonations occurred frequently during the testing era, but in recent decades they are sporadic and concentrated in a few states’ test sites (not EU).
  - No precedent for a nuclear yield in an EU state in any month since the EU’s member territories existed in their modern form; even during intense Cold War crises, Europe saw accidents/near-misses but **no yield**.

Short horizon strongly reduces probability: even if the “annual” risk were non-trivial, only ~1/10 of a year remains.

---

### (d) Justification (integrating the above into an outside view)
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** No nuclear detonation in/over EU territory; deterrence, command-and-control, and the reputational/catastrophic costs make deliberate first use on EU territory extremely unlikely on a 35‑day horizon.
- **What drives a YES in the outside view?**
  1. **Deliberate use** (most plausibly Russia–NATO escalation, or a strike intended to coerce EU/NATO).
  2. **Accidental/unauthorized detonation** (weapon mishandling at a base, loss-of-control scenario).
  3. **Terrorist nuclear device** (acquisition and successful detonation of an actual nuclear weapon, not merely radiological).
- **Outside-view read from sources:** The sources emphasize *presence of nuclear weapons in/near Europe* and *elevated geopolitical tension*, but they also implicitly reinforce that (i) nuclear yield accidents are historically absent, (ii) expert communities do not rank nuclear use as among the most likely near-term European risks, and (iii) modern nuclear detonations (when they occur) are typically tests at remote sites, not in third-party territories like EU states.

Given (a) zero historical EU nuclear-yield events, (b) very low modern global detonation frequency, and (c) a short 35-day horizon, the outside-view probability should be **well below 0.1%**, plausibly in the **1-in-10,000 to 1-in-2,000** range for this specific window.

Outside view calibration:
- **Tether/anchor:** “0 historical EU nuclear detonations” is a strong anchor but cannot be taken literally as 0% going forward. Use it to justify *extreme rarity*.
- **Upset/black swan adjustment:** Nuclear events are classic tail risks; history has “near misses” and rapid escalations. This argues against ultra-tiny probabilities like 1e‑6 for a 35‑day window, but still keeps the estimate firmly in “tiny” territory.
- **My calibrated outside-view stance:** Assign a probability on the order of **10^-4** for the 35-day period—small, but not vanishing—reflecting the combination of (i) unprecedented nature in EU territory and (ii) nonzero tail risk in a tense security environment.

Outside View Prediction:
**0.012%**
