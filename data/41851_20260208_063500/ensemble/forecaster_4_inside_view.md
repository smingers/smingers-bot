Analysis:
1. Source analysis (quality, facts vs opinions – abridged to key items)

   • Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Doomsday-Clock (Jan 2026).  High-credibility NGO.  Facts: European threat perceptions up; no reports of imminent EU-territory nuclear use.  Opinion: “Nuclear risk highest in decades.”  
   • CFR, “Europe Faces Uncertainty as New START Ends” (Feb 6 2026).  Reputable think-tank.  Facts: treaty has expired; European leaders questioning US umbrella.  Opinion: arsenal growth “could” reach 3 500 Russian warheads in ten years.  
   • Inkstick (Jan 12 2026).  Niche but transparent sourcing.  Facts: Russian upload potential once treaty lapses; no indication of immediate launch plans.  
   • SkyNews live Ukraine coverage (Feb 2026).  Major outlet.  Facts: heavy Russian missile raids; no nuclear employment.  Opinion: US warns Putin “could” use tactical nukes.  
   • Economic Times article on Princeton “Plan A” simulation.  Simulation, not forecast.  Illustrative only – weak evidential weight.  
   • Large cluster of AskNews items on European debate over an indigenous nuclear umbrella (5–6 Feb 2026).  Mostly political commentary; no operational preparations for use.  
   • Russian nuclear-force census (BAS, May 2025).  High-quality reference; shows modernization but also logistical limits.  
   • Historic accident retrospectives (Palomares etc.) – demonstrate that yield-producing accidents have never occurred.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted toward the 35-day window)

   Strong evidence favouring “No”  
   • 77-year historical record: zero nuclear yields in EU; zero accidental yields worldwide since 1945.  
   • Structural controls: PALs, strict NATO and Russian C2 preventing unauthorized use.  
   • Deliberate strategic logic: Crossing nuclear threshold against an EU/NATO state = extremely high retaliation risk – powerful deterrent.

   Moderate evidence nudging risk upward  
   • Treaty architecture collapse (New START expiry) removes some transparency and raises alert levels.  
   • War in Ukraine with routine Russian nuclear rhetoric increases chance of miscalculation.  
   • Russian warheads reported stored in Belarus (non-EU but bordering EU) – marginally shorter physical pathway to EU airspace.

   Weak evidence toward “Yes”  
   • Politicians and pundits speculating on a “Euro-deterrent” or on Russia’s “instant annihilation” plans.  
   • Computer-game-style casualty simulations.  
   • Anonymous warnings about tactical use “could” happen.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Window to resolution: 35 days (0.096 y).  If the annualised probability were 0.4 %, this converts to 0.04 % for 35 days; if doubled in length to 70 days probability roughly doubles, all else equal.  
   • Given very short horizon, only already-under-way crises matter – chiefly the Russia-Ukraine war.  No other actor currently signalling impending nuclear use on EU soil.

4. Justification & adjustment from outside-view base rate (0.012 %)

   Upward adjustments (+0.015 ppt ≈ ×2.5)  
   • Elevated geopolitical tension and explicit Russian nuclear threats compared with the historical average (+0.008 ppt).  
   • Loss of New START verification and attendant alert posture uncertainty (+0.004 ppt).  
   • Slight rise in accidental risk as more warheads are cycled through heightened readiness during Ukraine strikes (+0.003 ppt).

   Downward / stabilising considerations (–0.007 ppt)  
   • Still-robust deterrence equilibrium: Moscow understands NATO Article 5; France/UK possess assured retaliation capabilities.  
   • Zero indicators of weapon movement into EU target boxes; intelligence agencies public posture remains “no sign of imminent use.”  
   • Very limited time for a novel non-state actor plot to culminate.

   Net result ≈ 0.030 % (3 chances in 10 000).

Probability calibration
“I expect that roughly 3 out of 10 000 times a 35-day period matching current conditions would see a nuclear weapon detonated in or above an EU member state.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between now (8 Feb 2026) and 15 Mar 2026 will any nuclear weapon explode in or over EU territory?”  
2. Outside-view base: 0.012 %.  Final rooted to base, adjusted upward to 0.030 %.  
3. Consistency line: 0.03 % out of 100 ≈ 3/10 000 times a detonation happens.  Matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • No historical EU nuclear yields, zero global yield accidents.  
   • Russia–Ukraine war is nuclear-shadowed but remains conventional.  
   • New START expired, transparency gone, alert levels higher.  
   • Nuclear deterrence still symmetrical, costs of first use enormous.  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid, inadvertent escalation—e.g., mis-read radar data prompts “demonstration” strike on Baltic Sea over Poland.  Would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo: Peaceful deterrence has held; inertia favours “No.”  Short horizon justifies a slight re-tilt toward status-quo outcome.

Probability: 0.03%
