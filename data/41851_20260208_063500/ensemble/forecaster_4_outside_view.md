Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EU country list (EU official site, 2026) – purely factual roster of member states; establishes geographic scope.  
2. DW article on Germany & nuclear weapons (Jan 2026). High-quality mainstream outlet; facts about U.S. weapons in Europe and German legal barriers. Opinions supplied by two recognised security scholars (Kamp, Rudolf) and Defence Minister Pistorius; all stress how implausible a German bomb is.  
3. National Security Archive study of U.S. deployments 1954-62 (2020). Academic, primary-document-based history; shows Cold-War stockpiles but no yields in Europe.  
4. BBC retrospective on Palomares accident (Apr 2025). Mainstream, well-sourced history; confirms closest the EU has come to an unintended nuclear yield was a non-nuclear HE burst in 1966 Spain.  
5. EUISS expert survey on 2026 risks (Jan 2026). 501 credentialled European security experts; collective judgement is that Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon is high-impact but significantly less likely than several other 2026 risks; no numbers given.  
6. European Pravda on EU reaction to Putin’s test rhetoric (Nov 2025). Niche but reputable; reports official EU condemnation of possible Russian testing. Shows escalatory rhetoric but no actual detonations.  
7. Guardian interview with Ukrainian deputy FM (Oct 2025). Major newspaper; quotes are informed but partisan. Kyslytsya emphasises Russia’s non-nuclear hybrid tools, implicitly judging nuclear use unlikely.  
8. Agent report (Feb 2026). Collates open-source data: 2,061 acknowledged nuclear detonations worldwide (only 2 in war, none on EU soil); lists EU-relevant accidents (Palomares 1966, Lakenheath 1956) and catalogue of 2022-26 Russian threats. Methodology transparent, sources mostly official documents or mainstream media.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• RC-1: Any nuclear weapon use (wartime, test, accident) inside EU borders since 1945 → 0/81 years. Extremely narrow; yields base rate 0.0%. Too data-poor.  
• RC-2: Any nuclear weapon use against populated territory worldwide since 1945 (Hiroshima, Nagasaki) → 2/81 years ≈ 2.5% per year but all in 1945; rate falls to 0/80 years afterwards. Still gives essentially 0 for modern era.  
• RC-3: Any deliberate nuclear detonation outside established test sites since 1963 LTBT (e.g., wartime, terrorism, accidental yield) → 0/62 years.  
• RC-4: All acknowledged nuclear detonations worldwide of any type since 1945 → 2,061 over 81 years ≈ 25/year. But 99.7 % were controlled tests on recognised ranges, none inside EU since France’s last in 1996 (Pacific) and UK’s in 1991 (Australia/US). Not behaviourally relevant to “EU detonation”.  
RC-3 best balances relevance (covers deliberate/accidental yields) and sample size (62 year window). Its empirical frequency is zero, so we must borrow strength from broader global “nuclear use” statistics and apply a Bayesian prior.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 36 days (0.10 years).  
Historical pattern: Over the 62 years since 1963 there have been zero off-range nuclear yields; hence historical annualised hazard rate for such an event in the EU is <1/62 < 1.6% per year, and plausibly far lower given geographic focus. Scaling linearly for 0.10 years gives a risk ceiling of about 0.16%. Linear scaling arguably overstates risk because hazard is not memoryless—escalatory crises are rare.

(d) Justification  
• Empirical base rate for any nuclear yield on EU territory is literally 0 over the modern era; the closest were two non-nuclear HE dispersals (Palomares 1966) and one near-miss fire (Lakenheath 1956).  
• Possession: only France keeps operational warheads on EU soil; the UK is no longer an EU member. U.S. B-61 gravity bombs are hosted in five EU members, all under U.S. permissive-action-link control. This limits accidental/unauthorised pathways.  
• Intentional hostile use would most plausibly come from Russia. Yet despite intense 2022-26 war in Ukraine, expert survey (EUISS) still ranks Russian nuclear use below several other risks; qualitative statements from Russian leadership remain coercive but cost-benefit logic, fear of U.S./NATO retaliation, and absence of battlefield necessity inside the EU make an actual detonation exceptionally improbable in the next five weeks.  
• Non-state actors lack fissile material and weaponisation know-how; Europol and IAEA databases report no credible plots.  
• Tests: Neither France nor the U.S. conducts atmospheric/territorial tests; Russia hints at resuming testing but would do so at Novaya Zemlya, not EU territory.  
Collectively, the outside (base-rate) evidence points to an odds-on status-quo continuation (no detonation) during the very short forecast window.

Outside view calibration:

Start with a conservative Bayesian prior that the annual probability of a first-ever nuclear detonation in or over an EU state is 1 in 1,000 (0.1%/yr). Rationale: This is an order of magnitude higher than the naïve frequency (0/62 yrs) but allows for “black-swan” uncertainty.  

Convert to 36-day window: 0.1% × (36/365) ≈ 0.0099% (~1 in 10,000).  

Check against historical “upset” rates in extreme-low-base-rate domains (e.g., first use of chem weapons in Syrian civil war, 9/11-scale terror attack). Those events suggest that once-per-decade surprises with ex-ante probabilities in the 0.1-1% range do occur. To be conservative, inflate by a factor of 2.5.  

Adjusted outside-view probability: 0.025% (≈1 in 4,000). Minor rounding gives 0.03% to avoid false precision.

Outside View Prediction: 0.03%
