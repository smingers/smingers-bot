Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, newest first)
1. Il Mattino, 6 Feb 2026 – Report on New START expiry. Factual treaty dates and expert quotations; opinion-heavy but from mainstream Italian daily.  Reliable for dates, weak for risk quantification.
2. Bluewin, 6 Feb 2026 – Explainer on “European nuclear umbrella”.  Mostly political commentary; factual warhead numbers sourced to SIPRI. Medium quality, limited to policy debate.
3. CFR, 6 Feb 2026 – Think-tank article on post-New START insecurity.  High-quality source, expert opinions (Kallas, Radakin, Meier) identifiable.  Provides structural context, no direct claim of imminent use.
4. RT Español / Rambler / Yle trio, 5–6 Feb 2026 – Quotes by EU FP chief Kaja Kallas urging debate on EU nuclear deterrent.  Primary statements verifiable; editorial framing coloured by outlet bias.  Shows heightened rhetoric, not actionable threat.
5. Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Doomsday-Clock statement (Jan 2026) – Collates global nuclear trends.  Well-established NGO; strong factual track record.  Indicates rising systemic risk but no specific warning for the next month.
6. Inkstick Media & CFR pieces on New START – Same factual core; reputable niche outlets.  Structural, long-term risk.
7. Bulletin article on Russian arsenal (May 2025) – Authoritative quantitative data.  Historical.
8. Sky News Ukraine strike report (Jan 2026) – Mainstream broadcaster; shows continuing war and Russian escalation below nuclear threshold.
9. Economic Times simulation piece – Secondary coverage of 2019 Princeton model; illustrative but speculative.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong: None pointing to an EU-territory nuclear detonation in the next 36 days.
Moderate:
• Collapse of New START removes transparency/limits (multiple reliable sources) – raises long-run escalation risk (+).
• Continuing Russia-Ukraine war with explicit nuclear threats (+).
Weak:
• Political debate inside EU on indigenous deterrent, largely rhetorical (+/0).
• Doomsday-Clock moved to 85 seconds; expert signalling but not time-specific (+).
• Historical absence of accidental yields in Europe (-).

Net: small upward pressure versus a very low baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time until resolution: 36 days (~0.10 yr).  Halving (18 days): probability roughly halves because risk is mostly time-proportional.  Doubling (72 days): probability roughly doubles; no evidence of a particular “crisis week” that would change the slope.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate for any nuclear use in the world over 36 days: 0.12 %.  Scaling to EU target share (~20 %) → 0.024 %.  Add 0.01 pp tail hedge → 0.034 % ≈ 0.04 %.

Inside-view upward adjustments:
+0.02 pp New START expiry eliminates verification & may embolden brinkmanship (moderate evidence).
+0.02 pp Ongoing high-intensity war on EU border with Russian nuclear rhetoric (moderate).
+0.01 pp unpredictable US policy, perceived NATO fissures (weak–moderate).
Total uplift ≈ +0.05 pp.

Inside-view downward / stabilising factors:
-0.01 pp 79-year empirical record of zero nuclear use in Europe despite numerous crises (strong negative evidence).
-0.01 pp Enormous deterrent cost to Russia of crossing NATO red-line within next five weeks (moderate).

Net adjustment: +0.03 pp → 0.07 %.  Round conservatively upward acknowledging model uncertainty → 0.10 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 1 out of 1 000 comparable 36-day windows would see a nuclear weapon detonated in or above an EU member state.”  This corresponds to 0.10 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will any nuclear weapon explode over or inside an EU state before 15 Mar 2026?” ✔
2. Outside view base: 0.04 %.  Final still anchored. ✔
3. Consistency – “In 1 000 cases, 1 would be Yes.” ✔
4. Key evidence: a) New START expiry; b) Russia-Ukraine war & nuclear threats; c) Decades-long zero-use record; d) Massive deterrent cost of striking NATO. ✔
5. Blind-spot: sudden Russian command-and-control failure causing accidental launch toward Poland.  Would raise Yes odds dramatically.
6. Status-quo outcome is No; short horizon and entrenched deterrence favour that. ✔

Probability: 0.10%
