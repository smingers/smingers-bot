Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. EU country list (European-union.europa.eu, 2026).  Factual membership roster; high-quality primary EU site.  No opinions.  
2. DW article “Germany and nuclear weapons” (Dec 2025).  Main facts: estimated 180 US gravity bombs in five NATO countries; German legal restrictions.  Opinions clearly attributed to recognised experts (Kamp, Rudolf).  Credible mainstream broadcaster.  
3. National Security Archive brief on U.S. nuclear deployments 1954-62 (Sept 2020).  Purely historical, document-based.  Reputable academic repository.  No forward-looking claims.  
4. BBC retrospective on the 1966 Palomares accident (Apr 2025).  Historical narrative; BBC is high-quality.  No analytical opinions relevant to future risk.  
5. EUISS “Global Risks to the EU in 2026” survey (Jan 2026).  Fresh expert elicitation (501 respondents).  Methodology and credentials transparent; EUISS is the EU’s own think-tank.  Opinions are collective expert judgements rather than raw facts.  
6. European Pravda note on EU reaction to Putin testing talk (Nov 2025).  Factual reporting of statements by EU spokesperson; moderate quality, but quotations verifiable.  Limited analytic value.  
7. Guardian interview with Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister (Oct 2025).  Contains first-person opinion and public-domain facts (drone incursions, airspace violations).  Guardian is reputable; statement is advocacy rather than expert risk estimate.  
8. Agent-report synthesis (Feb 2026).  Collates open-source counts of nuclear detonations (≈2 061 tests + 2 wartime uses) and catalogue of “Broken Arrow” accidents in EU states (Palomares 1966; Lakenheath 1956).  Contains no novel primary data but is internally consistent and cites recognised datasets (Arms Control Association, CTBTO).  Medium reliability.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. Any nuclear detonation world-wide since 1945 (wartime or accidental, excluding tests).  Count: 2 bombs, same week, August 1945.  
ii. Nuclear yield on (or over) EU territory, 1945-2026.  Count: 0.  
iii. Years with at least one nuclear use anywhere, 1945-2025 (81 calendar years).  Count: 1 year (1945) → base rate 1/81 ≈ 1.2 % per *year*.  
iv. “Broken Arrow” accidents producing an unintended yield (global).  Count: 0, hence unusable.

Class (iii) is the broadest that still contains at least one event and therefore permits a calculable, if tiny, baseline.  Narrower classes (ii) give a zero numerator and are unhelpful for quantitative anchoring.

C. Timeframe analysis  
Time left to resolution: 36 days (8 Feb 2026 → 15 Mar 2026).  
Transform annual base rate to a 36-day hazard:  
1.2 % / yr × (36 / 365) ≈ 0.12 % chance of *anywhere in the world* nuclear use in the period.  Assuming target location is approximately proportional to GDP / geopolitical salience, EU might account for ~20 % of the notional target space.  0.12 % × 0.20 ≈ 0.024 %.

D. Justification (outside-view only)  
• Empirical record: 79 consecutive years without a single nuclear yield outside combat in 1945.  Whatever inside-view considerations we may later add, the raw historical frequency is extremely low.  
• Geography: no prior detonation has occurred on EU territory despite Cold-War crises, large nuclear stockpiles stationed in Europe, and several serious accidents; this suggests additional location-specific dampening factors (NATO command and control, permissive action links, dense political red-lines).  
• Short horizon: 36 days is < 0.1 year, mechanically pulling probabilities downward.  
• Expert expectations (EUISS survey) place “Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon” in a high-impact but low-likelihood category for **all of 2026**; nothing indicates experts regard the next five weeks as a special danger window.  
• No historical precedent exists for an accidental or terrorist nuclear *yield* in Europe, further suppressing the base rate.

Allowing a modest +0.01 pp cushion for tail-risk under-representation in such sparse data yields an outside-view estimate around 0.03 – 0.04 %.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline (any nuclear use in 36 days)……………….0.12 %  
× EU share of plausible targets (~20 %)……………0.024 %  
+ Tail-risk adjustment (+0.01 pp)…………………≈0.034 %  

Round to two decimal places while avoiding false precision: 0.04 %.

Outside View Prediction:
0.04 %
