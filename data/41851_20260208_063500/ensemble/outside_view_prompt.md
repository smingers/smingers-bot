You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will a nuclear weapon be detonated in or above a European Union state before the following dates? (March 15, 2026)

Question background:
The European Union comprises [27 member countries](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en), some of which possess nuclear weapons or are under the protection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nuclear umbrella. France and the United Kingdom are recognized nuclear-weapon states under the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/). The NPT, which entered into force in 1970, serves as the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, aiming to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and facilitate disarmament.

The geopolitical landscape in and around Europe has seen significant changes over the past several decades, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent enlargement of the EU and NATO. These developments have altered the balance of power in the region and generated new security challenges. The resurgence of great power competition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the proliferation of nuclear technology to non-state actors are factors that have contributed to concerns about the likelihood of a nuclear detonation in EU territory.

# Summary of Article: "Germany and nuclear weapons: A difficult history"

## Key Facts and Context:

**Current Nuclear Weapons in Europe:**
- An estimated 180 US nuclear weapons are currently stored in Europe, distributed across Italy, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany
- Experts believe approximately 20 US nuclear warheads are stored in Büchel, Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany
- Decision-making authority over these weapons lies solely with the American president

**Historical Context:**
- 1954: West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer signed agreement renouncing production of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons on German territory
- 1960: 1,500 US nuclear warheads were stored in West Germany and another 1,500 in rest of Western Europe
- 1983: Center-right Bundestag majority approved stationing of US medium-range missiles despite mass protests
- 1990: Two-Plus-Four Treaty stipulated reunified Germany must renounce nuclear weapons
- 1991: Former East Germany officially became nuclear weapons-free after Soviet military withdrawal

**Current Political Debate:**
- Sparked by Donald Trump's suggestion he would not provide military assistance to NATO countries investing less than 2% of GDP in defense
- German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated: "There is no reason to discuss the nuclear umbrella now"

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Karl-Heinz Kamp (German Council on Foreign Relations):**
- "The debate about European nuclear weapons is a very German debate that we don't see in any other country"
- Germany historically "seen as an intrinsically aggressive country, that had started two world wars and could not be trusted with nuclear weapons"
- "Those who are now talking about a European defense dimension are not talking about German nuclear weapons, because Germany is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"
- "Trump may be able to damage NATO considerably, but he cannot destroy it. You can't destroy decades of transatlantic relations in one term of office"

**Peter Rudolf (German Institute for International and Security Affairs):**
- Any debate about Germany acquiring nuclear weapons is "completely unrealistic"
- "Survivable nuclear weapons would have to be on nuclear-powered submarines that can remain underwater for a very long time" — equipment the Bundeswehr does not have
- "There are so many problems standing in the way of a German nuclear bomb that it has no relevance to current crises"

**Boris Pistorius (German Defense Minister):**
- "The majority of those in charge in the United States of America know exactly what they have in their transatlantic partners in Europe, what they have in NATO"

## Relevance to Forecast Question:

This article discusses the debate about nuclear weapons in Europe but provides no information suggesting increased likelihood of nuclear detonation in EU territory. Instead, it emphasizes Germany's legal commitments against possessing nuclear weapons and expert assessments that German acquisition of nuclear weapons is unrealistic.

## Summary of Article: "The U.S. Nuclear Presence in Western Europe, 1954-1962, Part II"

**Disclaimer:** This is a historical article from the National Security Archive dated September 16, 2020, discussing nuclear weapons deployments in NATO Europe during the early Cold War period (1950s-1960s). It does not contain information directly relevant to forecasting nuclear detonations in EU states before March 2026.

### Key Facts and Information:

**Historical Nuclear Deployments:**
- By early 1961, the U.S. had deployed approximately 500 nuclear weapons assigned to allied forces (mainly West Germany), plus about 4,000 nuclear weapons for U.S. purposes in NATO Europe
- By summer 1962, plans called for 1,580 more weapons to be assigned to allies, bringing the total to over 2,000 (though actual deployment was slower, not reaching 2,000 until after 1965)
- The U.S. nuclear stockpile in Western Europe stayed around 4,000 until 1964, when plans to add another 1,000 weapons began
- Currently (as of the article's 2020 publication date), approximately 150 weapons remain deployed to NATO allies

**Security Concerns (Historical):**
- President Kennedy and adviser McGeorge Bundy were concerned about unauthorized use of dispersed nuclear weapons
- In April 1961, Kennedy halted dispersals to allies due to security concerns, resuming them in 1962 once Permissive Action Links (PALs) - electronic locks to secure weapons - were being developed
- A 1960 Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy report raised concerns that U.S. custody had become "tenuous" and control had "virtually passed to allies"
- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara discovered around September 1962 that German pilots knew how to arm nuclear warheads despite assumptions they did not

**Rationale for Deployments:**
- According to McGeorge Bundy (1962), the stockpile system was necessary to "hold NATO in a single nuclear position or risk seeing it disintegrate into a series of national nuclear capabilities" - i.e., to prevent nuclear proliferation among individual NATO members

**Note:** This article is purely historical and provides no forecasting-relevant information about current nuclear risks in EU states.

# Summary of Article: "We thought it was the end of the world: How the US dropped four nuclear bombs on Spain in 1966"

**Source:** BBC  
**Date:** April 07, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Incident Date and Details:**
   - On January 17, 1966, a US B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a KC-135 tanker plane during mid-air refueling at 31,000 ft over the Almería region of southern Spain
   - The collision killed 7 crew members total (4 from the tanker, 3 from the bomber)
   - Four hydrogen bombs fell onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares

2. **Nuclear Weapon Specifications:**
   - The missing warhead had explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima
   - The bombs were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent unintended atomic chain reaction
   - However, the devices contained explosives surrounding plutonium cores as part of triggering mechanisms

3. **Outcome of the Four Bombs:**
   - One bomb landed safely intact in a riverbed and was recovered the next day
   - Two bombs' parachutes failed to open; they exploded on impact (one in a tomato field, one near a cemetery), creating craters and scattering radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres
   - The fourth bomb was recovered on April 7, 1966 (80 days after the accident) from 2,850 ft depth in the Mediterranean Sea

4. **Casualties and Damage:**
   - No villagers were killed despite nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris falling on the village
   - Radioactive contamination spread across several hundred acres
   - The incident occurred on foreign soil and involved civilians

5. **Context Provided:**
   - This was part of Operation Chrome Dome, a Cold War US deterrence operation
   - According to the Pentagon, there were at least nine previous accidents involving aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs, but this was the first on foreign soil

**Named Source Opinion:**
- US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson (who was in charge of dealing with the accident) stated the collision occurred because "the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position"

**Note:** This article is a historical retrospective about an incident from 1966, not a current event. It does not directly address the forecast question about future nuclear detonations in EU territory.

# Summary of "Global Risks to the EU in 2026: What are the main conflict threats for Europe?"

**Source:** European Union Institute for Security Studies  
**Date:** January 19, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Survey Details:** 501 European experts participated in the Global Risks to the EU survey conducted at the end of November 2025
  - All respondents are academics, policymakers, think tankers, or journalists
  - Close to 40% identify as EU foreign policy experts
  - 96% hold at least a master's degree; over 50% hold a PhD
  - Experts ranked likelihood and expected impact of 30 predefined risks affecting EU security in 2026

- **Survey Partnership:** Conducted by EUISS in partnership with the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at EUI, with support from TEPSA and EISS

## Top Risks Identified for 2026:

1. **Disruptive attack on EU critical infrastructure** (rated most likely and most impactful)
2. **Russia's continued aggression in Europe and against its neighbors**
3. **US withdrawal of security guarantees to European allies**
4. **Military conflict between China and Taiwan**

## Risk Assessment Changes from 2025 to 2026:

**Increased Risks:**
- China-Taiwan armed conflict: moved from Medium to High Risk
- Political violence in the United States: rose from Low to Medium Risk

**Downgraded Risks (5 total):**
- Four in the Middle East: renewed wars in Gaza and between Israel and Iran, state collapse in Lebanon, mass migration from MENA
- One in Eastern neighborhood: Georgia's full submission to Russia

## Expert Opinions on Specific Threats:

**Russia-Related Risks:**
- Experts do NOT expect a direct NATO-Russia war
- Greatest concern: "slow-burn actions" below NATO Article 5 threshold
- **Ceasefire in Ukraine on Russia's terms:** rated as top-tier risk for both likelihood and impact
- **New Russian military action in non-NATO neighboring states:** rated as high risk and more likely than direct NATO-Russia clash
- **Russia's use of a nuclear weapon:** Mentioned in context of comparative impact - experts perceive US withdrawal of security guarantees would have "as severe a political impact on Europe's security as Russia's use of a nuclear weapon, while being significantly more likely than the latter"

**US Security Commitment:**
- US pullback scenario remains "strategically seismic and plausibly imminent"
- Described as making NATO "a preeminent source of risk"
- US threats to annex Greenland mentioned as deepening strategic predicament
- US-backed NATO still has deterrent power (making NATO-Russia direct war unlikely for 2026)

**China-Taiwan:**
- Risk has increased, now in high-risk tier
- Reflects Beijing's growing assertiveness
- However, experts see US-China military conflict over Taiwan as the **lowest-likelihood scenario among the 30 risks assessed**

**Middle East:**
- Direct confrontation between Israel and Iran: mid-tier risk for 2026 (was high-risk in 2025)
- Iran's reduced military capabilities noted (following US strikes and protests)
- Resumption of Israel-Hamas hostilities: high-likelihood but limited EU impact
- Renewed fighting in Red Sea: moderate risk

**Other Moderate Risks:**
- Destabilizing armed conflict in Libya
- Aggressive Chinese action in South China Sea

## Context and Comparisons:

- Article notes that 2025 survey correctly identified Israel-Iran confrontation as high-risk
- Comparison with Council on Foreign Relations' Preventive Priorities Survey shows transatlantic alignment on major threats
- Article describes Europe's security environment in 2026 as "bleak and uncertain" with "exceptional strain" on transatlantic relationship

# Article Summary: EU Response to Putin's Nuclear Testing Order

**Key Facts and Events:**

1. **Putin's Order**: Kremlin ruler Vladimir Putin ordered exploration of the possibility of resuming nuclear weapons testing (as of early November 2025, based on the article's reference to "5 November")

2. **Recent Russian Actions**: Russia recently tested a nuclear-powered missile (the Burevestnik cruise missile with a nuclear power unit), which Putin publicly discussed in late October

3. **US Actions**: In late October, US President Donald Trump instructed the Pentagon to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing

**Official EU Position:**

- **Source**: Anouar El Anouni, spokesperson for the European Commission on foreign affairs and security policy (reported by European Pravda)

- **EU's Stance**:
  - Views Russia's nuclear-powered missile test negatively
  - Warns the missile "could release radioactive materials during testing or operation"
  - Calls on Russia to refrain from actions that could lower the threshold for nuclear weapon use
  - Demands Russia stop issuing nuclear threats
  - Reminds Russia of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
  - Urges all nuclear-armed states to avoid actions that could trigger a new arms race
  - Warns such behavior "undermines global stability and the hard-won progress on nuclear arms reductions since the end of the Cold War"

**Note**: This article discusses potential nuclear testing preparations rather than actual detonations, and focuses on diplomatic responses to escalatory rhetoric and actions.

# Article Summary: "Europe needs to 'get serious' about threat posed to it by Russia, Ukraine minister says"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Author:** Luke Harding

## Key Facts and Statements:

### Named Source Opinions:
**Sergiy Kyslytsya (Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, former UN Ambassador):**
- States that the Kremlin is already at war with Europe
- Warns that Vladimir Putin will "escalate escalating" if Europe and the Trump administration don't show collective resolve
- Predicts Putin will continue actions designed to "disrupt and paralyse the continent" without a decisive transatlantic response
- Claims Russia has infiltrated EU countries with "agents and moles" (described as "konservy" - "tin cans" in Ukrainian) responsible for drone flights over airports in Denmark and Germany, as well as allied military bases
- Believes European leaders have "generally woken up to the threat" but many experts and professionals in western Europe have not yet grasped it
- States: "In the 21st century you don't need tanks to put technologically advanced countries on their knees. Cyberwar is a reality. Howitzers are not necessary to paralyse the banking system. By using drones in a smart way you can achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb."
- Says Ukraine's relations with the US have improved since spring
- Suggests the war is turning in Ukraine's favor despite continued Russian advances

**Mette Frederiksen (Danish Prime Minister):**
- Said Europe faces its most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of WWII
- Stated all countries are affected by the "Russian hybrid war"

### Recent Events Cited:
- Russia has sent decoy drones across the border into Poland
- Russia dispatched fighter jets that violated Estonia's airspace
- Incidents involving drones restricted flights at Munich and Copenhagen airports (Russian involvement suspected but Moscow has denied responsibility)
- Ukraine's President Zelenskyy met EU leaders at a summit in Copenhagen this week
- According to the Wall Street Journal, the US this week agreed to share intelligence to help Kyiv coordinate attacks on targets deep inside Russia

### Context:
- Russian troops continue to advance slowly in several parts of the battlefield
- Ukraine has carried out an increasingly successful campaign to cripple Russia's oil production via long-range strikes using homemade drones

**Note on nuclear weapons:** While the article discusses escalating Russian hybrid warfare activities and threats to Europe, Kyslytsya's quote specifically mentions that drones can "achieve your goals better than with a nuclear bomb," suggesting conventional hybrid warfare tactics rather than nuclear escalation.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: List all recorded nuclear detonations worldwide and any attempted or accidental nuclear events involving European Union member states; include 2022-2026 Russian or non-state actor threats mentioning potential use in EU territory.
This updated brief revisits each element of the original request in the light of the new material retrieved.

A. Recorded nuclear detonations world-wide  
Since 16 July 1945 at least 2 061 acknowledged nuclear explosions have taken place: 2 wartime uses (Hiroshima, Nagasaki) and 2 059 tests.  The two principal open compilations—the U.S. Arms Control Association tally and the AtomicArchive chronology—differ slightly in the way they count “salvo” shots (e.g., India 1998, Pakistan 1998), but they agree on the country totals shown below:  
• United States  1 030 tests (last: 23 Sep 1992) [AtomicArchive]  
• USSR/Russia  715 tests (last: 24 Oct 1990) [ArmsControl]  
• France  210 tests (last: 27 Jan 1996) [ArmsControl]  
• United Kingdom  45 tests (last: 26 Nov 1991) [AtomicArchive]  
• China  45 tests (last: 29 Jul 1996) [ArmsControl]  
• India  3–7 tests, depending on whether the five simultaneous Pokhran-II shots are counted individually; the Arms Control Association, following Threshold Test-Ban Treaty practice, records 3 [ArmsControl] while AtomicArchive lists 7 [AtomicArchive].  
• Pakistan  2–6 for the same methodological reason (ACA: 2; AtomicArchive: 6).  
• North Korea  6 tests (last: 3 Sep 2017) [AtomicArchive].  

Adding the 2 wartime uses gives a consolidated minimum of 2 061 detonations, identical to the figure already quoted in the earlier memo.  The underlying shot-by-shot data remain available in CTBTO’s “Nuclear Testing 1945–present” file and SIPRI Yearbook appendices.

B. Attempted or accidental nuclear-weapon events in EU member states  
No nuclear weapon has ever detonated (in a fission sense) on EU soil, but several “Broken Arrow” accidents have involved current member states:

1. Palomares, Spain – 17 Jan 1966.  A USAF B-52 collided with its KC-135 tanker during Operation Chrome Dome.  Four B-28 bombs fell; two high-explosive (non-nuclear) detonations dispersed plutonium over agricultural land; one weapon was recovered intact, the fourth located and winched from 869 m depth in the Mediterranean on 7 Apr 1966 (BBC, 7 Apr 2025).  Soil remediation and health-impact litigation continue today.

2. Near-miss at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom – 27 Jul 1956.  A B-47 crashed into a weapons storage igloo containing several Mk-6 bombs.  Intense fire burned for hours, but no nuclear yield occurred.  Although the site is now outside the EU, the accident happened while the UK was an EU territory and it is consistently listed in the U.S. Defense Department’s canonical set of 32 nuclear accidents (National Security Archive blog, 9 Oct 2013).

3. Additional “Broken Arrow” incidents with a European vector.  The DoD list includes accidents over the Mediterranean Sea (1956), near Spanish Morocco (1958) and at Thule, Greenland (1968).  None of those territories lies within an EU member state today, so they are excluded here, but they underscore the relevance of U.S. nuclear operations to European safety.

4. Missing weapons.  Task & Purpose reports that six U.S. nuclear weapons remain unrecovered world-wide, but does not place any of them on EU land or coastal waters (Task & Purpose, 25 Aug 2022).

No new EU-based accidents surfaced in the supplementary searches.  Grey-literature references occasionally mention possible incidents at Aviano (Italy), Ramstein (Germany) or Kleine-Brogel (Belgium), but no declassified documentation confirming an actual weapons release has been located.  That remains an outstanding archival research gap.

C. Russian or non-state actor nuclear threats to EU territory, 2022-2026  
Russian state rhetoric and military signalling since the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has produced a dense record of implicit and explicit threats against NATO/EU countries.  Key milestones already captured in the earlier memo remain valid; the new material retrieved does not contradict them.  To recap the most salient items:

• Continuous references by President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Security Council Deputy Chair Medvedev and state television hosts that Russia could strike NATO capitals if they “intervene” too deeply in Ukraine (UNITED24 Media timeline, cited previously).  
• May–June 2024 front-line tactical-nuclear exercises announced by Russia’s Ministry of Defence; official communiqués stated that the drills were “a response to Western provocations”.  
• December 2025 declaration that the “Oreshnik” intermediate-range missile system is combat-ready in Belarus, with flight-times to Warsaw and Brussels explicitly highlighted (PBS News, 30 Dec 2025 – referenced in earlier brief).  
• February 2026 Medvedev statement that NATO troops in Ukraine would be “legitimate targets… as in Finland 1939”, interpreted by most analysts as a thinly veiled nuclear threat (Critical Threats, 2 Feb 2026).

No additional 2026 Russian statements were found in this latest search batch.

Non-state actors  
• Islamic State (IS) and affiliated online channels have continued to call for radiological or nuclear terrorism.  A July 2024 Guardian report quoted U.S. politician J. D. Vance linking Islamist “dirty bomb” aspirations explicitly to the UK [Guardian, 16 Jul 2024, cited earlier].  
• Europol and member-state intelligence services still assess actual weaponisable material access as very low.  The December 2024 foiled Bavarian Christmas-market plot contained no radiological component (Politico, 6 Dec 2024, cited earlier).

D. Consistency checks and remaining information gaps  
1. Numerical discrepancies in test counts.  The ACA dataset counts Indian and Pakistani 1998 “series shots” as single tests, whereas the AtomicArchive site and SIPRI list each physical detonation.  The difference (2 061 vs. 2 071 total shots) is methodological, not factual, and should be footnoted in any definitive table.

2. EU accident coverage.  Only one fully documented plutonium-dispersal event (Palomares) occurred in what is now EU territory.  The Lakenheath fire remains the only confirmed accident involving armed weapons on EU soil north of the Pyrenees.  Press anecdotes about incidents at USAF‐operated NATO sites in Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands lack released primary sources.  A targeted archive search—keywords “Bent Spear” + Aviano / Ramstein / Büchel / Kleine-Brogel / Volkel—would clarify whether any such events rose to “accident” status.

3. Russian threat corpus.  The qualitative chronology is solid, but researchers seeking legal or psychological-warfare analysis might require verbatim Russian-language texts.  Those can be pulled from Kremlin.ru and TASS transcripts.

4. Non-state actor threats.  Open sources reveal aspiration rather than capability.  Regular mining of Europol TE-SAT reports and IAEA Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) updates would capture any change in material-access risk.

Conclusion  
• All publicly acknowledged nuclear detonations to date (minimum 2 061) are allocated to eight states, with test moratoria observed by all but North Korea since 1998 (China, France, the UK, United States) or 1996 (India, Pakistan) and since 1990 (Russia).  
• The European Union’s territory has witnessed no nuclear yields, but one major weapons accident (Palomares, 1966) and one severe near-miss (Lakenheath, 1956) are fully documented; no conclusive evidence exists of further EU-based “Broken Arrows”.  
• From 2022 through early 2026 Russian political and military leaders have repeatedly invoked the possibility of nuclear strikes on NATO/EU territory; these threats have intensified alongside Russia’s forward deployment of dual-capable missiles to Belarus.  
• Non-state actors continue to express intent to employ radiological devices against European targets, yet no credible plot involving fissile material has emerged in the 2022-2026 window.

On the basis of the presently available open-source record, the information objectives of the original query are largely met; remaining gaps concern (i) granular shot-by-shot test tables, which can be filled from CTBTO datasets, and (ii) possible but unverified U.S. nuclear accidents at NATO bases in continental Europe.  Focused archival work is recommended for the latter.
