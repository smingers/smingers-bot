    "description": "The European Union comprises [27 member countries](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en), some of which possess nuclear weapons or are under the protection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nuclear umbrella. France and the United Kingdom are recognized nuclear-weapon states under the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/). The NPT, which entered into force in 1970, serves as the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, aiming to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and facilitate disarmament.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape in and around Europe has seen significant changes over the past several decades, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent enlargement of the EU and NATO. These developments have altered the balance of power in the region and generated new security challenges. The resurgence of great power competition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the proliferation of nuclear technology to non-state actors are factors that have contributed to concerns about the likelihood of a nuclear detonation in EU territory.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":15426,\"question_id\":15534}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically pertains to (and resolves according to) the option 'March 15, 2026'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if a nuclear weapon is detonated in or above the territory of a European Union (EU) member state before the dates indicated.  A [deliberate, inadvertent, or accidental/unauthorised](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21barrett.pdf) detonation would result in the question resolving as **Yes**.",
    "fine_print": "1. The territory of an EU member state includes the 12 nautical mile territorial sea around the listed territories. For the purposes of this question, the territory of an EU member state does not include overseas territories outside of Europe, such as the [French-administered territories outside of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France).\n2. To qualify, the nuclear weapon must be detonated less than 100 kilometers above Earth's mean sea level.\n3. For the purposes of this question, a \"nuclear weapon\" is a bomb which uses a nuclear fission or fusion reaction as its primary energy source, excluding conventional bombs which spread radioactive fallout (so-called \"dirty bombs\").\n4. If a weapon is detonated on the border of an EU state, this question resolves positively if credible reports indicate the [light damage blast radius](https://remm.hhs.gov/zones_nucleardetonation.htm#:~:text=Light%20Damage%20\\(LD\\)%20Zone%3A\\&text=This%20damage%20may%20correspond%20to,terrain%2C%20and%20even%20the%20atmosphere) includes the territory of an EU state.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/15426) which opened on 2023-03-19 23:09:00. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.",
