Analysis:
The question resolves “Yes” only if an actual nuclear explosion occurs inside or above any EU member state before 15 March 2026. Therefore, the most decision-relevant information is:

1. Confirmation or refutation of any nuclear blast on EU territory up to the present (8 Feb 2026).
2. Reporting on credible near-term risks—e.g., Russian threats to use tactical nukes against NATO/EU soil, French/UK arsenal accidents, nuclear terrorism plots—because these shape the probability of an explosion in the remaining 5 weeks.
3. Official statements or alerts from NATO, EU governments, IAEA, or major intelligence services about heightened nuclear danger in Europe since late 2025.

The queries should surface: (a) any factual incident of a detonation (none expected, but needs verification), (b) the latest news discussing imminent nuclear strike/accident scenarios in Europe, and (c) expert and official assessments published in the last few weeks.
