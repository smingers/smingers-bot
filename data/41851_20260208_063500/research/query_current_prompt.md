The forecasting question is:
Will a nuclear weapon be detonated in or above a European Union state before the following dates? (March 15, 2026)

Question background:
The European Union comprises [27 member countries](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en), some of which possess nuclear weapons or are under the protection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nuclear umbrella. France and the United Kingdom are recognized nuclear-weapon states under the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/). The NPT, which entered into force in 1970, serves as the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, aiming to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and facilitate disarmament.

The geopolitical landscape in and around Europe has seen significant changes over the past several decades, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent enlargement of the EU and NATO. These developments have altered the balance of power in the region and generated new security challenges. The resurgence of great power competition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the proliferation of nuclear technology to non-state actors are factors that have contributed to concerns about the likelihood of a nuclear detonation in EU territory.
