Analysis:
The outside-view baseline is that no nuclear weapon has ever been detonated (test, wartime, terrorist, accidental, or otherwise) on the territory of an EU member state since 1945. To gauge how likely that could change in the remaining five weeks until 15 Mar 2026, the most informative historical context includes:
• The complete record of nuclear detonations world-wide, highlighting the geographic absence in EU countries.  
• Documented incidents of attempted, threatened, accidental, or unauthorized nuclear use involving or aimed at Europe (e.g., Cold-War alerts, 1983 Able Archer, theft/smuggling cases, recent Russian nuclear rhetoric during the Ukraine war, Belarus hosting Russian weapons, etc.).  
• Recent (-2026) expert assessments or intelligence leaks on the probability of Russian, terrorist, or accidental nuclear use in Europe.  
• Any officially confirmed 2024-2026 nuclear incidents (e.g., missile tests, radiological events) that might be misconstrued as detonations.

These strands let a forecaster compare the historical frequency (essentially zero) with today’s escalatory signals and near-misses to form a probability estimate.
