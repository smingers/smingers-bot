(March 15, 2026)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**The End of the New START Treaty and Europe's Role in Nuclear Disarmament**\nThe New START treaty, a strategic arms reduction agreement between the United States and Russia signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dimitri Medvedev, expired on February 5, 2026, with no negotiations underway for renewal. This marks the collapse of the post-Cold War nuclear security architecture established in 1991 by George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. The treaty previously limited long-range strategic weapons, allowed reciprocal inspections, imposed strict limits on land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers and nuclear bombers, and helped prevent proliferation by deterring non-nuclear states like Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. With over 12,000 nuclear warheads globally\u2014over 80% held by the U.S. and Russia\u2014its expiration has left a void in verification, transparency, and de-escalation mechanisms. According to SIPRI, the world now faces a renewed nuclear arms race. China has doubled its nuclear arsenal from 300 to 600 warheads in five years and may match U.S. and Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) numbers by 2030. Without binding arms control, the three superpowers and smaller nuclear states are moving toward new proliferation. For the European Union, this presents a strategic challenge: to remain under the U.S. nuclear umbrella while avoiding escalation. The EU must promote peace strategies and risk reduction in its region. The article calls for a new Helsinki-style process, encouraging France and the UK to engage all nuclear powers, including China. However, obstacles remain: Trump demands China\u2019s inclusion before talks begin, Russia suspended New START after U.S. support for Ukraine post-2022, and China insists it should not be required to reduce. Trump himself dismissed renewal, stating, 'If (the treaty) scades, it scades,' ending hope for a revival. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists now estimates the world is 85 seconds from nuclear midnight, reflecting the heightened global risk.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 10:24 PM\nSource:[Il Mattino](https://www.ilmattino.it/primopiano/esteri/l_atomica_senza_regole_e_il_ruolo_dell_europa-9344092.html)\n\n**Will Europe Get Its Own Nuclear Umbrella Thanks to Trump? The Situation Explained in 8 Points**\nEmmanuel Macron has advocated for greater European cooperation on nuclear deterrence since 2020, a proposal that has gained momentum amid growing concerns over U.S. reliability under Donald Trump\u2019s second term. The idea of a European nuclear deterrent, potentially based on French and UK nuclear arsenals, has seen renewed interest, especially after the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed openness to discussions during his election campaign. While the U.S. maintains around 100 nuclear warheads in Europe\u2014located in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey\u2014these are under American control and would be used by allied aircraft in emergencies. France and the UK, not part of the EU, currently contribute only supplementary deterrence to NATO. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the U.S. has 1,770 nuclear warheads ready for use, France 280, and the UK 120. Establishing an independent European nuclear shield would require massive investment and years of development, and raises legal and political challenges: Germany\u2019s 1990 Treaty on the Final Status of Germany and the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) prohibit nuclear weapons possession. Experts like Wolfgang Ischinger warn that pushing for European nuclear autonomy could provoke a U.S. response, possibly leading to the withdrawal of American warheads. However, Merz insists that talks on a European nuclear role are not incompatible with NATO\u2019s existing nuclear sharing. Manfred Weber, leader of the European People\u2019s Party, supports intensifying discussions among EU leaders. The German government may act as a bridge between Europe and the U.S., but the path remains fraught with diplomatic, legal, and strategic risks.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 09:54 PM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/it/attualita/estero/leuropa-avra-un-suo-ombrello-nucleare-grazie-a-trump-la-situazione-spiegata-in-8-punti-3076381.html)\n\n**Europe Faces Uncertainty as New START Ends | Council on Foreign Relations**\nThe expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) on February 5, 2026, has triggered significant security concerns across Europe. New START, which limited U.S. and Russian deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 each, provided critical stability through confidence-building measures, including protection of national technical means and a Bilateral Consultative Commission. Its end has raised fears of a renewed nuclear arms race, with experts predicting U.S. and Russian arsenals could grow to 3,500 and 2,600 warheads, respectively, within a decade. European leaders, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, stress that NATO must become more European to maintain strength amid declining confidence in U.S. extended deterrence. President Donald Trump\u2019s public criticism of New START as a 'badly negotiated deal' and his threats toward Greenland have intensified European doubts about American reliability. Despite not being parties to the treaty, European nations view New START as a 'crucial contribution to international and European security.' With no formal successor agreement, European states are exploring alternatives: the UK and France have deepened nuclear cooperation through the Northwood Declaration (July 2025), and discussions are underway for a French-British nuclear umbrella. French President Emmanuel Macron has revived proposals for a European nuclear deterrent, though challenges remain due to small arsenals (290 for France, 225 for the UK) and limited counterforce capability. Germany, Sweden, and Poland have initiated preliminary talks on nuclear cooperation, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk hinting at potential domestic nuclear weapons development. CFR experts warn such steps could be 'way stations to nuclear proliferation' and provoke Russian hostility. The collapse of arms control has left Europe vulnerable, prompting a strategic shift toward self-reliance amid growing threats from both Russia and an unpredictable U.S. stance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 05:32 PM\nSource:[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/articles/europe-faces-uncertainty-as-new-start-ends)\n\n**Kallas Urges Europe to Consider Its Own Nuclear Arsenal Amid Deterrence Crisis**\nKaja Kallas, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called for a European debate on developing its own nuclear deterrent capabilities. She stated, 'Having in mind the current situation and that nuclear weapons are the only thing that truly functions as a deterrent, they could be part of future discussions.' Kallas emphasized that decisions on nuclear deterrence remain with EU member states and noted that trust in transatlantic relations has suffered a 'real blow' following the dispute over Greenland. Her remarks come amid the expiration of the U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), with Russia confirming that both sides are no longer bound by its terms. Moscow stated it intends to act responsibly, based on a thorough assessment of U.S. military policy and the strategic landscape. Kallas's comments follow a growing trend in European political discourse: French President Emmanuel Macron initiated a strategic debate on European nuclear deterrence in March, citing calls from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed this sentiment, declaring that Poland should pursue advanced capabilities, including nuclear weapons. Merz committed to discussions with France and the UK on whether Berlin could fall under their nuclear umbrella. These developments signal a potential shift in Europe\u2019s long-standing taboo on nuclear armament.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:21 PM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/585911-pensar-propio-arsenal-nuclear-llamamiento-kallas-europa)\n\n**Kallas Reveals EU's Desire for Independent Nuclear Deterrence**\nKaja Kallas, the head of the European Union's foreign affairs, stated that discussions should begin on Europe developing its own nuclear deterrence, according to Helsingin Sanomat.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has assessed the European discussions on nuclear armament, as reported by Rambler on February 6, 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 10:23 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/56007557-na-zapade-raskryli-zhelanie-kallas-po-yadernomu-oruzhiyu/)\n\n**Facing the Nuclear Abyss: The Collapse of the New START Treaty and the Rise of Global Instability**\nThe New START nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia officially expired on February 6, 2026, marking the end of the last legal framework that had governed strategic nuclear arsenals since the Cold War. With no successor treaty in place, both nations are now free from legal constraints on expanding their nuclear weapons, eliminating mutual inspections and deployment limits. This breakdown of transparency and verification mechanisms risks triggering a new era of strategic paranoia, where each side interprets the other's actions as existential threats, fueling an unregulated arms race. The absence of oversight coincides with heightened global tensions\u2014including conflict in Ukraine, escalating tensions in the Middle East, Arctic militarization, and weakening multilateral institutions\u2014creating a dangerous acceleration of instability. The void may embolden nuclear-armed and aspiring nuclear states like China, France, the UK, and Iran, signaling that rules no longer matter. The introduction of advanced technologies such as hypersonic missiles and AI-driven autonomous weapons in an unregulated environment drastically reduces reaction time, increasing the risk of accidental nuclear conflict. For Brazil, a signatory of the Treaty of Tlatelolco establishing Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear-weapon-free zone, this development represents a civilizational setback. The article warns that the world has become 'inevitably more dangerous, smaller, and darker' and calls for urgent diplomatic efforts by regional powers, the European Union, and the Global South to pressure the U.S. and Russia to resume negotiations, not out of ideology, but for the survival of humanity.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 09:40 AM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/opiniao/2026/02/7348949-diante-do-abismo-nuclear.html)\n\n**Kallas Urges Europe to Begin Discussion on Developing Its Own Nuclear Deterrence**\nKaja Kallas, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called for Europe to begin discussions on developing its own nuclear deterrence capabilities during a visit to Helsinki on February 5, 2026. Speaking in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, she stated that nuclear weapons remain the most effective deterrent in the current geopolitical context, despite the risks of proliferation. She emphasized that NATO's nuclear deterrence relies heavily on the United States, as only France and the UK possess independent nuclear arsenals, while other European countries are bound by treaties restricting nuclear weapons. Kallas expressed skepticism about Russia's genuine intent to negotiate peace in Ukraine, asserting that the EU is preparing its twentieth sanctions package ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. She highlighted the importance of targeting Russia's 'shadow fleet' and stressed that the conflict will end only when Russia exhausts its resources for war. Kallas also called for binding limitations on Russia's military spending and army size in any future peace agreement, arguing that without such measures, peace would not be sustainable. She commended Finland for contributing new elements to the upcoming sanctions package.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 08:12 AM\nSource:[Yle.fi](https://yle.fi/a/74-20208700)\n\n**Friday's papers: Nuclear deterrence, an exploding ship, and going for gold**\nIn an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called for Europe to begin discussing the development of its own nuclear deterrent, citing the current security environment and the effectiveness of nuclear weapons as a deterrent. She cautioned, however, about the risks of nuclear proliferation, noting that only France and the UK currently possess nuclear weapons in Europe, while several countries are bound by treaties to limit their spread. Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, was in Finland on Thursday. On Wednesday, an explosion occurred on the Liberian-flagged cargo ship MSC Giada III, bound for St Petersburg from Antwerp, carrying a crew of 22\u201421 from Myanmar and the captain from Russia. The ship, reportedly part of Russia's 'shadow fleet' of ageing vessels used to circumvent Western sanctions, had previously been observed near the Black Sea. Meanwhile, vans touring Finland to buy scrap gold are increasingly common, even in small towns. Markus Rasimus, Lapland regional manager at Suomen Kultareservi, said gold supplies remain strong, with sellers offering dental gold and bullion. Gold prices briefly hit a record $5,600 per ounce on Thursday, February 5, 2026, before dropping 12% the next day. Typical sellers are women over 50, though younger people\u2014often selling inherited jewellery\u2014are also active; individual transactions now commonly yield 1,500\u20133,000 euros, as fewer young Finns wear gold, preferring cash instead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 07:12 AM\nSource:[Yle.fi](https://yle.fi/a/74-20208675)\n\n**Is the World Approaching a New Nuclear Arms Race? Germany Reconsiders Nuclear Weapons as the Last U.S.-Russia Treaty Expires**\nThe New START treaty between the United States and Russia expired on February 5, 2026, marking the end of the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the two superpowers. This development has reignited concerns about a new nuclear arms race. Germany, which previously abandoned nuclear weapons development after World War II, is now discussing the possibility of developing its own nuclear arsenal and joining a European nuclear shield alongside the UK and France. Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed Germany\u2019s participation in these discussions, emphasizing that no immediate decision will be made and that any move would not conflict with the existing U.S. nuclear alliance. The shift reflects growing European unease due to the war in Ukraine and U.S. strategic ambiguities. Sweden has also entered nuclear discussions, considering joining the Franco-British nuclear alliance and potentially developing its own weapons. Global nuclear expenditure exceeds \u20ac90 billion, with the U.S. accounting for over half, while Russia maintains a larger stockpile. The cost of producing a single nuclear warhead ranges from \u20ac10 to \u20ac30 million. The expiration of New START, following the earlier suspension of the INF Treaty in 2018, removes all limits on strategic nuclear weapons for the two largest nuclear powers. Former U.S. President Barack Obama warned the end of the treaty could trigger a new arms race and reduce global security. Russian President Dmitri Medvedev called the expiration alarming. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates 12,000 nuclear warheads exist across nine countries, with the U.S. and Russia holding 86%. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds before midnight\u2014the closest it has ever been to global catastrophe, surpassing even Cold War peaks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 12:33 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/industria/noticias/13762354/02/26/se-aproxima-el-mundo-a-una-nueva-carrera-atomica-alemania-estudia-fabricar-armas-nucleares-mientras-expira-el-ultimo-tratado-entre-eeuu-y-rusia.html)\n\n**Europe Moves Toward Nuclear Armament as New START Treaty Ends Without Successor**\nThe New START treaty, a 50-year-old strategic arms reduction agreement between the United States and Russia that limited nuclear arsenals, expired on February 5, 2026, without a successor treaty. This termination has triggered global concerns about a renewed nuclear arms race. In response, several European nations\u2014Germany, Sweden, and Poland\u2014have begun openly discussing the development of independent nuclear capabilities. Germany\u2019s Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed ongoing discussions on a European nuclear umbrella, marking a significant shift given Germany\u2019s historical prohibition on nuclear weapons under the 1990s Four Plus Two Agreement and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Sweden\u2019s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson stated that discussions with the UK and France on nuclear capabilities are underway, citing the need for democratic nations to possess nuclear deterrence in the face of nuclear-armed states. Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk also called for nuclear weapons acquisition, emphasizing the inadequacy of conventional forces and expressing interest in nuclear sharing with France. All three countries are NATO members, but distrust in U.S. reliability\u2014fueled by former President Donald Trump\u2019s actions, including threats to Greenland and perceived favoritism toward Russia\u2014has driven this shift. The European nuclear umbrella is expected to center on France (290 warheads) and the UK (220 warheads), with existing cooperation under the 2023 Northwood Declaration and joint strategic nuclear exercises. French President Emmanuel Macron is set to deliver a major speech on the topic. Internationally, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Pope Leo XIV urged immediate negotiations for a new arms control agreement, while Russia declared it is no longer bound by any obligations and reserves the right to take future actions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that any new treaty must include China, referencing Trump\u2019s prior stance that meaningful arms control in the 21st century is impossible without Chinese participation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:21 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/international/international_general/2026/02/06/WN3TBEIILJCR3ETC3TNLMNCU4A/)\n\n**Debates**\nOn February 5, 2026, the New START nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia expired, raising concerns about a potential new nuclear arms race.

In a parliamentary speech, Merz stated that Germany is discussing expanding nuclear-armed status among European allies, noting that these discussions are in early stages and will not conflict with existing U.S. nuclear-sharing agreements. Germany\u2019s nuclear development is restricted by the 1990 Two-plus-Four Agreement, which tied the recognition of unified Germany\u2019s sovereignty to the renunciation of nuclear weapons, limits on military size, and the prohibition of foreign troop presence in former East Germany. Merz emphasized that while Germany remains bound by this agreement, it is not prohibited from discussing related issues with partner nations. The debate over nuclear weapons is spreading across Europe: Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed ongoing talks with France and the UK on nuclear umbrella arrangements. France, a longstanding nuclear power, has been exploring expanding its nuclear deterrence to include European allies, formalized in the July 2023 'Northwood Declaration' with the UK to coordinate nuclear forces and strengthen Europe-wide deterrence. The New START treaty, which limited strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems and included on-site inspections, is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Russia proposed a one-year extension in September 2023, but the U.S. has not given a clear response. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested a new arms control agreement involving China and Russia, but no concrete progress has been made. Russia suspended participation in New START in 2023, prompting the U.S. to halt nuclear information sharing. Although the treaty is effectively suspended, its collapse raises concerns about a renewed nuclear arms race between the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:03 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2a41](https://www.news1.kr/videos/23099)\n\n**European Nations Consider Developing Independent Nuclear Weapons Amid Distrust of U.S. Security Guarantees**\nEuropean countries are increasingly concerned about U.S. security guarantees and are exploring ways to ensure their own defense, including the possibility of developing independent nuclear capabilities. According to NBC, European officials are discussing how to protect Europe through nuclear deterrence, either with or without U.S. involvement. Key options under consideration include strengthening cooperation with existing European nuclear powers\u2014France and the United Kingdom\u2014or launching a standalone European nuclear weapons program. French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly proposed in the summer of 2025 that European partners consider using France\u2019s nuclear arsenal for collective defense. These discussions have intensified amid ambiguous statements from U.S. leadership, including Donald Trump\u2019s controversial proposal to annex Greenland, which triggered backlash in both Greenland and the European Union. Trump responded by imposing tariffs on countries opposing the move. U.S. Vice President JD Vance previously warned that political instability in Europe could lead to nuclear weapons falling into dangerous hands. Meanwhile, the Kremlin argues that the spread of nuclear weapons in Europe would reduce regional security and stability.

French President Emmanuel Macron proposed using the instrument, known as the 'bazuca' (cannon), which was created in 2023 but never activated. Valerie Hayer, leader of the Renew group in the European Parliament, also called for its use, describing it as the EU's 'nuclear economic weapon.' The instrument is designed to counter economic coercion by third countries that interfere with the EU\u2019s sovereign decisions. It allows the EU to impose trade restrictions, limit access to public procurement contracts for U.S. companies, and target key sectors\u2014especially U.S. tech giants\u2014due to the U.S. trade surplus in services. The mechanism requires approval from at least 55% of EU member states representing 65% of the bloc\u2019s population. The process includes a four-month investigation phase, followed by 8\u201310 weeks of member state consultation, and a potential six-month delay before measures take effect. However, even initiating an investigation sends a strong signal of readiness to retaliate. Hayer warned that the U.S. is making a 'calculation error' that could be 'painful.' The instrument was originally developed after Lithuania accused China of blocking its exports following Lithuania\u2019s opening of a representative office for Taiwan in 2021.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 04:16 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/internacional/2026/01/20/groenlandia-la-ue-analiza-activar-una-clausula-economica-en-respuesta-a-las-amenazas-de-trump/)\n\n**Russia's MFA: U.S. Will Modernize Its Nuclear Weapons in Europe**\nOn January 20, 2026, Vladislav Maslenkov, Director of the Department of European Issues at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (\u041c\u0418\u0414), stated that the United States will not only maintain its nuclear arsenal in Europe but will also systematically modernize it. He emphasized that the question of replacing the U.S. military presence in Europe remains largely hypothetical due to the continued dependence of the European Union\u2019s operational, intelligence, logistical, and strategic infrastructure on the United States and NATO. This statement was made during an interview with 'Izvestia'. Earlier, on January 16, 2026, German political parties CDU/CSU and SPD entered a debate over the creation of a European nuclear shield without U.S. involvement. On January 19, 2026, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, State Secretary for International Communications in Hungary\u2019s government, announced that EU citizens had received safety and survival instructions for nuclear war scenarios.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 10:27 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0415\u041d \u0422\u0412](https://ren.tv/news/v-mire/1398828-mid-ssha-budut-modernizirovat-svoe-iadernoe-oruzhie-v-evrope)\n\n**The World Is Talking About This Report: Russia\u2019s 'Instant Annihilation' Plan and the Terrifying 2026 Prophecy**\nThe article, published on January 8, 2026, by S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi, discusses growing international concerns over a potential Russian 'immediate annihilation' strategy and a chilling 2026 prophecy. It notes that Germany refers to 2026 as the 'last peaceful summer,' while the UK and Poland point to 2028\u20132029 as the approaching inevitable end. Preparations include shelter construction, reinstatement of military service, and distribution of brochures on what to do during a nuclear explosion. The article claims the U.S. national security strategy describes Europe as a 'civilization in the process of being erased' demographically and culturally. Analysts suggest Washington is prepared to use Europe as a shield against Russia but lacks intent to fully deploy its 'nuclear umbrella.' According to experts, Russia would not engage in conventional warfare but could launch single, devastating tactical nuclear strikes on critical European ports and logistics hubs. Europe possesses no tactical nuclear weapons; only France and the UK have strategic 'total annihilation' missiles. In the event of a limited Russian nuclear strike, Europe faces two options: surrender or retaliate by annihilating Russian cities, risking its own total destruction. The article poses a stark U.S. dilemma: would America sacrifice 100 million of its citizens to save Paris? The answer, according to historical and strategic reasoning, is 'No.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 06:50 AM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/dunya-bu-raporu-konusuyor-rusya-nin-aninda-yok-etme-plani-ve-tuyler-urperten-2026-kehaneti-p282172)\n\n**From 'Creative Instrument' to 'Nuclear Weapon': The EU's High-Stakes Gamble with Frozen Russian Assets**\nThe European Union faces a critical decision at a summit on Thursday, December 18, 2025, over a controversial proposal to use \u20ac210 billion in frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine\u2019s war effort. The plan, described as a 'creative instrument' but potentially a 'nuclear weapon' in legal terms, aims to provide Ukraine with financial stability through a loan secured by Russian assets, avoiding direct EU funding. The proposal, based on Article 122 of the EU Treaty\u2014a clause designed for member-state crises\u2014has raised legal concerns, as it applies to a non-member state. Belgium, where most of the assets are held via Euroclear, opposes the plan, fearing legal retaliation from Russia, which has already initiated over 100 lawsuits against Euroclear. The Belgian government warns that if Russia demands repayment due to sanctions being lifted (e.g., by Hungary), Belgium could be forced to cover \u20ac185 billion in losses, risking its financial stability. Despite pressure from Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz and support from countries like Italy, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Malta, who advocate joint EU debt issuance, Belgium remains firm in its 'no.' Meanwhile, Baltic states, Finland, and Poland insist the EU plan is the only 'feasible and politically realistic' solution. The EU has offered new concessions\u2014full access to funds if Belgium is attacked and a ban on all EU-Russia investment treaties\u2014but Belgium\u2019s government, led by Bart De Wever, has rejected them. The summit now stands at a crossroads: to uphold international legal order or risk breaking it to save Ukraine and prevent territorial conquest by force.

According to Kaia Kallas, the EU's official spokesperson for foreign affairs, Anita Hippius, the EU urges all signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to fulfill their commitments, including those under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Hippius emphasized that statements from Russia and the United States regarding nuclear tests should not be treated identically, as each situation requires a distinct approach. The NPT, opened for signature in 1968 and effective from March 5, 1970, aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote peaceful uses of atomic energy, according to 'Radio T\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 NSN'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/55550028-es-potreboval-ot-ssha-soblyudat-obyazatelstva-po-nerasprostraneniyu-yao/)\n\n**EU Urges U.S. to Uphold Nuclear Non-Proliferation Commitments After Trump's Test Resumption Announcement**\nThe European Union, through its official representative at the EU Foreign Policy Chief, Kaia Kal\u043b\u0430\u0441, urged all participants of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to uphold their international obligations, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on October 29, 2025, to immediately resume nuclear testing. According to Kallass, the EU calls on all signatories to adhere to their commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which entered into force on March 5, 1970, and was opened for signature in 1968. The NPT divides states into nuclear-weapon states (the 'nuclear five': the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China) and non-nuclear-weapon states, the latter of which voluntarily renounce nuclear weapons. Kallass emphasized that statements from the U.S. and Russia regarding nuclear tests should not be equated, warning against 'grouping them together.' This comes after Russia announced on October 28, 2025, successful tests of the 'Poseidon' underwater nuclear-powered torpedo and the 'Burevestnik' long-range nuclear-powered cruise missile, as confirmed by President Vladimir Putin. The Russian government cited its moratorium on nuclear testing as a response to U.S. plans.

The resolution requires nine of fifteen votes, but the Russian\u2011Chinese text is unlikely to secure them, meaning the mechanism will still trigger. The JCPOA, signed in 2015, expires 18\u202fOctober\u202f2025. Iran holds 450\u202fkg of 60\u202f% enriched uranium, enough for 8\u201310 nuclear weapons, according to European experts. European leaders\u2014France, Germany and the UK\u2014met in New\u202fYork during the UN General Assembly, but diplomats say they received no concrete gestures from Iran, which has repeatedly denied any nuclear\u2011weapons ambitions. German Foreign Minister Johann\u202fWadephul said, 'L'Iran ne doit jamais acqu\u00e9rir l'arme nucl\u00e9aire', while Iranian President Ebrahim\u202fRaisi said, 'L'Iran n'a jamais cherch\u00e9 et ne cherchera jamais \u00e0 fabriquer une bombe atomique. Nous ne voulons pas d'armes nucl\u00e9aires'. The European conditions include resuming talks with the US, allowing IAEA inspectors at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, and securing enriched\u2011uranium stock.
