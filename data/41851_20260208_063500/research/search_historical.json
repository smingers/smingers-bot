Instead, it emphasizes Germany's legal commitments against possessing nuclear weapons and expert assessments that German acquisition of nuclear weapons is unrealistic.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2020-09-16/us-nuclear-presence-western-europe-1954-1962-part-ii\">\n## Summary of Article: \"The U.S. Nuclear Presence in Western Europe, 1954-1962, Part II\"\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a historical article from the National Security Archive dated September 16, 2020, discussing nuclear weapons deployments in NATO Europe during the early Cold War period (1950s-1960s). It does not contain information directly relevant to forecasting nuclear detonations in EU states before March 2026.\n\n### Key Facts and Information:\n\n**Historical Nuclear Deployments:**\n- By early 1961, the U.S. had deployed approximately 500 nuclear weapons assigned to allied forces (mainly West Germany), plus about 4,000 nuclear weapons for U.S. purposes in NATO Europe\n- By summer 1962, plans called for 1,580 more weapons to be assigned to allies, bringing the total to over 2,000 (though actual deployment was slower, not reaching 2,000 until after 1965)\n- The U.S. nuclear stockpile in Western Europe stayed around 4,000 until 1964, when plans to add another 1,000 weapons began\n- Currently (as of the article's 2020 publication date), approximately 150 weapons remain deployed to NATO allies\n\n**Security Concerns (Historical):**\n- President Kennedy and adviser McGeorge Bundy were concerned about unauthorized use of dispersed nuclear weapons\n- In April 1961, Kennedy halted dispersals to allies due to security concerns, resuming them in 1962 once Permissive Action Links (PALs) - electronic locks to secure weapons - were being developed\n- A 1960 Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy report raised concerns that U.S. custody had become \"tenuous\" and control had \"virtually passed to allies\"\n- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara discovered around September 1962 that German pilots knew how to arm nuclear warheads despite assumptions they did not\n\n**Rationale for Deployments:**\n- According to McGeorge Bundy (1962), the stockpile system was necessary to \"hold NATO in a single nuclear position or risk seeing it disintegrate into a series of national nuclear capabilities\" - i.e., to prevent nuclear proliferation among individual NATO members\n\n**Note:** This article is purely historical and provides no forecasting-relevant information about current nuclear risks in EU states.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250404-how-the-us-dropped-nuclear-bombs-on-spain-in-1966\">\n# Summary of Article: \"We thought it was the end of the world: How the US dropped four nuclear bombs on Spain in 1966\"\n\n**Source:** BBC  \n**Date:** April 07, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Incident Date and Details:**\n   - On January 17, 1966, a US B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a KC-135 tanker plane during mid-air refueling at 31,000 ft over the Almer\u00eda region of southern Spain\n   - The collision killed 7 crew members total (4 from the tanker, 3 from the bomber)\n   - Four hydrogen bombs fell onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares\n\n2. **Nuclear Weapon Specifications:**\n   - The missing warhead had explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima\n   - The bombs were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent unintended atomic chain reaction\n   - However, the devices contained explosives surrounding plutonium cores as part of triggering mechanisms\n\n3. **Outcome of the Four Bombs:**\n   - One bomb landed safely intact in a riverbed and was recovered the next day\n   - Two bombs' parachutes failed to open; they exploded on impact (one in a tomato field, one near a cemetery), creating craters and scattering radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres\n   - The fourth bomb was recovered on April 7, 1966 (80 days after the accident) from 2,850 ft depth in the Mediterranean Sea\n\n4. **Casualties and Damage:**\n   - No villagers were killed despite nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris falling on the village\n   - Radioactive contamination spread across several hundred acres\n   - The incident occurred on foreign soil and involved civilians\n\n5. **Context Provided:**\n   - This was part of Operation Chrome Dome, a Cold War US deterrence operation\n   - According to the Pentagon, there were at least nine previous accidents involving aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs, but this was the first on foreign soil\n\n**Named Source Opinion:**\n- US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson (who was in charge of dealing with the accident) stated the collision occurred because \"the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position\"\n\n**Note:** This article is a historical retrospective about an incident from 1966, not a current event. It does not directly address the forecast question about future nuclear detonations in EU territory.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/global-risks-eu-2026-what-are-main-conflict-threats-europe\">\n# Summary of \"Global Risks to the EU in 2026: What are the main conflict threats for Europe?\"\n\n**Source:** European Union Institute for Security Studies  \n**Date:** January 19, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Survey Details:** 501 European experts participated in the Global Risks to the EU survey conducted at the end of November 2025\n  -

Recorded nuclear detonations world-wide  \nSince 16 July 1945 at least 2 061 acknowledged nuclear explosions have taken place: 2 wartime uses (Hiroshima, Nagasaki) and 2 059 tests.  The two principal open compilations\u2014the U.S. Arms Control Association tally and the AtomicArchive chronology\u2014differ slightly in the way they count \u201csalvo\u201d shots (e.g., India 1998, Pakistan 1998), but they agree on the country totals shown below:  \n\u2022 United States  1 030 tests (last: 23 Sep 1992) [AtomicArchive]  \n\u2022 USSR/Russia  715 tests (last: 24 Oct 1990) [ArmsControl]  \n\u2022 France  210 tests (last: 27 Jan 1996) [ArmsControl]  \n\u2022 United Kingdom  45 tests (last: 26 Nov 1991) [AtomicArchive]  \n\u2022 China  45 tests (last: 29 Jul 1996) [ArmsControl]  \n\u2022 India  3\u20137 tests, depending on whether the five simultaneous Pokhran-II shots are counted individually; the Arms Control Association, following Threshold Test-Ban Treaty practice, records 3 [ArmsControl] while AtomicArchive lists 7 [AtomicArchive].  \n\u2022 Pakistan  2\u20136 for the same methodological reason (ACA: 2; AtomicArchive: 6).  \n\u2022 North Korea  6 tests (last: 3 Sep 2017) [AtomicArchive].  \n\nAdding the 2 wartime uses gives a consolidated minimum of 2 061 detonations, identical to the figure already quoted in the earlier memo.  The underlying shot-by-shot data remain available in CTBTO\u2019s \u201cNuclear Testing 1945\u2013present\u201d file and SIPRI Yearbook appendices.\n\nB. Attempted or accidental nuclear-weapon events in EU member states  \nNo nuclear weapon has ever detonated (in a fission sense) on EU soil, but several \u201cBroken Arrow\u201d accidents have involved current member states:\n\n1. Palomares, Spain \u2013 17 Jan 1966.  A USAF B-52 collided with its KC-135 tanker during Operation Chrome Dome.  Four B-28 bombs fell; two high-explosive (non-nuclear) detonations dispersed plutonium over agricultural land; one weapon was recovered intact, the fourth located and winched from 869 m depth in the Mediterranean on 7 Apr 1966 (BBC, 7 Apr 2025).  Soil remediation and health-impact litigation continue today.\n\n2. Near-miss at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom \u2013 27 Jul 1956.  A B-47 crashed into a weapons storage igloo containing several Mk-6 bombs.  Intense fire burned for hours, but no nuclear yield occurred.  Although the site is now outside the EU, the accident happened while the UK was an EU territory and it is consistently listed in the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s canonical set of 32 nuclear accidents (National Security Archive blog, 9 Oct 2013).\n\n3. Additional \u201cBroken Arrow\u201d incidents with a European vector.  The DoD list includes accidents over the Mediterranean Sea (1956), near Spanish Morocco (1958) and at Thule, Greenland (1968).  None of those territories lies within an EU member state today, so they are excluded here, but they underscore the relevance of U.S. nuclear operations to European safety.\n\n4. Missing weapons.  Task & Purpose reports that six U.S. nuclear weapons remain unrecovered world-wide, but does not place any of them on EU land or coastal waters (Task & Purpose, 25 Aug 2022).\n\nNo new EU-based accidents surfaced in the supplementary searches.  Grey-literature references occasionally mention possible incidents at Aviano (Italy), Ramstein (Germany) or Kleine-Brogel (Belgium), but no declassified documentation confirming an actual weapons release has been located.  That remains an outstanding archival research gap.\n\nC. Russian or non-state actor nuclear threats to EU territory, 2022-2026  \nRussian state rhetoric and military signalling since the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has produced a dense record of implicit and explicit threats against NATO/EU countries.  Key milestones already captured in the earlier memo remain valid; the new material retrieved does not contradict them.  To recap the most salient items:\n\n\u2022 Continuous references by President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Security Council Deputy Chair Medvedev and state television hosts that Russia could strike NATO capitals if they \u201cintervene\u201d too deeply in Ukraine (UNITED24 Media timeline, cited previously).  \n\u2022 May\u2013June 2024 front-line tactical-nuclear exercises announced by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence; official communiqu\u00e9s stated that the drills were \u201ca response to Western provocations\u201d.  \n\u2022 December 2025 declaration that the \u201cOreshnik\u201d intermediate-range missile system is combat-ready in Belarus, with flight-times to Warsaw and Brussels explicitly highlighted (PBS News, 30 Dec 2025 \u2013 referenced in earlier brief).  \n\u2022 February 2026 Medvedev statement that NATO troops in Ukraine would be \u201clegitimate targets\u2026 as in Finland 1939\u201d, interpreted by most analysts as a thinly veiled nuclear threat (Critical Threats, 2 Feb 2026).\n\nNo additional 2026 Russian statements were found in this latest search batch.\n\nNon-state actors  \n\u2022 Islamic State (IS) and affiliated online channels have continued to call for radiological or nuclear terrorism.  A July 2024 Guardian report quoted U.S. politician J. D. Vance linking Islamist \u201cdirty bomb\u201d aspirations explicitly to the UK [Guardian, 16 Jul 2024, cited earlier].  \n\u2022 Europol and member-state intelligence services still assess actual weaponisable material access as very low.  The December 2024 foiled Bavarian Christmas-market plot contained no radiological component (Politico, 6 Dec 2024, cited earlier).\n\nD. Consistency checks and remaining information gaps  \n1. Numerical discrepancies in test counts.  The ACA dataset counts Indian and Pakistani 1998 \u201cseries shots\u201d as single tests, whereas the AtomicArchive site and SIPRI list each physical detonation.  The difference (2 061 vs. 2 071 total shots) is methodological, not factual, and should be footnoted in any definitive table.\n\n2. EU accident coverage.  Only one fully documented plutonium-dispersal event (Palomares) occurred in what is now EU territory.  The Lakenheath fire remains the only confirmed accident involving armed weapons on EU soil north of the Pyrenees.  Press anecdotes about incidents at USAF\u2010operated NATO sites in Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands lack released primary sources.  A targeted archive search\u2014keywords \u201cBent Spear\u201d + Aviano / Ramstein / B\u00fcchel / Kleine-Brogel / Volkel\u2014would clarify whether any such events rose to \u201caccident\u201d status.\n\n3. Russian threat corpus.  The qualitative chronology is solid, but researchers seeking legal or psychological-warfare analysis might require verbatim Russian-language texts.  Those can be pulled from Kremlin.ru and TASS transcripts.\n\n4. Non-state actor threats.  Open sources reveal aspiration rather than capability.  Regular mining of Europol TE-SAT reports and IAEA Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) updates would capture any change in material-access risk.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2022 All publicly acknowledged nuclear detonations to date (minimum 2 061) are allocated to eight states, with test moratoria observed by all but North Korea since 1998 (China, France, the UK, United States) or 1996 (India, Pakistan) and since 1990 (Russia).  \n\u2022 The European Union\u2019s territory has witnessed no nuclear yields, but one major weapons accident (Palomares, 1966) and one severe near-miss (Lakenheath, 1956) are fully documented; no conclusive evidence exists of further EU-based \u201cBroken Arrows\u201d.  \n\u2022 From 2022 through early 2026 Russian political and military leaders have repeatedly invoked the possibility of nuclear strikes on NATO/EU territory; these threats have intensified alongside Russia\u2019s forward deployment of dual-capable missiles to Belarus.  \n\u2022 Non-state actors continue to express intent to employ radiological devices against European targets, yet no credible plot involving fissile material has emerged in the 2022-2026 window.\n\nOn the basis of the presently available open-source record, the information objectives of the original query are largely met; remaining gaps concern (i) granular shot-by-shot test tables, which can be filled from CTBTO datasets, and (ii) possible but unverified U.S. nuclear accidents at NATO bases in continental Europe.  Focused archival work is recommended for the latter.\n\nUse the following verification checklist at the end of your response  \n1.
