Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CNBC (Jan 2021)**: Historical article from before 2025 providing Tesla's 2020 production (509,737 vehicles) and guidance for 50% average annual growth. High-quality financial journalism with verifiable data from Tesla's official reports.

**Best-selling-cars.com (Jan 26, 2026)**: Written just 16 days before today's date (Feb 9, 2026), this provides crucial recent information: 2025 production was down 6.7% vs 2024, marking the second consecutive year of contraction. The source is a specialized automotive statistics site. Critically, it doesn't provide absolute 2025 numbers, only percentage changes.

**Investing.com**: Provides Q1 2025 actual data: 362,000+ vehicles produced. Also confirms 2024 full-year production of 1,773,443 vehicles (though there's a delivery figure of 1,789,226). High-quality financial data source.

**Backlinko (Dec 2023, updated)**: Confirms 2024 production of 1,773,443 vehicles (3.93% YoY decrease). Provides Q2 2025 deliveries of 384,000 vehicles. Reputable statistics aggregator.

**Stock Titan (Oct 22, 2025)**: Official Q3 2025 results showing 447,450 vehicles produced in Q3. Primary source quality (Tesla financial release).

**Fortune (Jul 24, 2025)**: Q2 2025 earnings coverage noting sales down 13% through first half of year. Musk scrapped full-year growth guidance, warning of "rough quarters" in Q4 2025, Q1 2026, possibly Q2 2026. Expert opinion from Gene Munster (Deepwater Asset Management) expressing investor disappointment. High-quality financial journalism.

**Lucid comparison article**: Provides key competitor context - states **"Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025"**. This is a crucial data point if accurate.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive historical data showing 2015-2024 production with CAGR of ~48%. Confirms 2024 production of 1,773,443. Notes installed capacity of ~3 million vehicles/year as of 2025.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Tesla's own historical growth trajectory (2015-2024)**
- CAGR of 48% over 2015-2024
- Recent deceleration: 2023 to 2024 saw -3.93% decline
- Suitability: HIGH - most directly relevant but shows inflection point

**Reference Class 2: Mature automotive manufacturers scaling**
- Traditional automakers show modest growth rates (2-5% annually) once established
- Suitability: MODERATE - Tesla is transitioning from hyper-growth to mature phase

**Reference Class 3: EV industry growth patterns**
- Industry growing but individual manufacturers face volatility
- BYD overtook Tesla in 2025
- Suitability: MODERATE - provides competitive context

**Selected Reference Class**: Tesla's own trajectory (2020-2025), focusing on the recent deceleration phase rather than the hyper-growth era.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 2025 calendar year (already completed as of Feb 9, 2026; question resolves March 15, 2026)

**Critical insight**: The question asks about 2025 production, and we're forecasting in February 2026. This means 2025 has ALREADY ENDED. The outcome is historical fact, just not yet officially reported.

**Key data points for 2025**:
- Q1 2025: 362,000+ produced
- Q2 2025: ~384,000 delivered (production likely similar)
- Q3 2025: 447,450 produced
- Q4 2025: Unknown but critical

**Calculation from known quarters**:
- Q1-Q3 total: ~362,000 + ~384,000 + 447,450 = ~1,193,450 vehicles

**Two key constraints**:
1. Best-selling-cars.com states 2025 production was down 6.7% from 2024
2. Lucid article states "Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025"

**Verification**:
- 2024 production: 1,773,443
- Down 6.7%: 1,773,443 × 0.933 = 1,654,624 vehicles
- This aligns closely with the "1.6 million" figure from the Lucid article

**Q4 2025 implied production**:
- If total 2025 = 1,654,624
- Q1-Q3 = ~1,193,450
- Q4 = ~461,174 vehicles

This is plausible given Q3 was 447,450 and Fortune warned of "rough quarters" including Q4 2025.

## (d) Justification

The evidence strongly converges on 2025 production around 1.6-1.66 million vehicles:

1. **Direct statement**: Lucid article explicitly states "Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025"
2. **Percentage decline**: Best-selling-cars.com's -6.7% decline from 2024's 1,773,443 yields 1,654,624
3. **Quarterly build-up**: Q1-Q3 actual data (~1,193,450) plus reasonable Q4 estimate (~460,000) supports this range
4. **Contextual factors**: Musk's scrapped growth guidance, warning of rough quarters, market share loss to BYD, and second consecutive year of decline all support contraction

The convergence of multiple independent sources on the 1.6 million figure, combined with the mathematical consistency of the -6.7% decline, provides high confidence. The main uncertainty is whether the exact figure is closer to 1.60 million or 1.65 million.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) Distribution shape**: This is effectively a historical fact with reporting uncertainty, not a true forecast. The distribution should be narrow but account for:
- Rounding in preliminary reports
- Potential revisions between preliminary and final figures
- Small possibility of misreporting in secondary sources

**(b) Tethering to established information**:
- Central tendency: 1,654,624 (from -6.7% calculation)
- Secondary anchor: 1,600,000 (from Lucid article)
- Range: These differ by ~54,000 vehicles (~3.3%)

**(c) Tail considerations**:
- Lower tail: Could be as low as 1.55 million if decline was steeper than -6.7%
- Upper tail: Could reach 1.70 million if Q4 was stronger than expected or if decline was only -4%
- The -6.7% figure is specific enough to suggest actual data, not estimation

**(d) Rate of upsets**: In automotive production reporting, final figures typically match preliminary reports within 1-2%. Major revisions are rare. However, we're working from secondary sources, not Tesla's official release.

Given we're essentially predicting a historical fact with strong convergent evidence, the distribution should be relatively tight around 1.65 million, with 80% of probability mass between 1.60-1.70 million.
