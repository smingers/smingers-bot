Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary factual sources (High reliability):**
1. **Tridenstechnology.com (Feb 2026)** - Comprehensive historical data 2018-2025. Reports **2025 production: 1,654,667 vehicles** (7% decline from 2024). Cites Tesla official reports and Twitter/X (Jan 2, 2026). High quality, directly addresses question.

2. **Teslarati.com (Jan 2, 2026)** - Tesla-focused news site. Reports identical figure: **2025 production: 1,654,667 vehicles** (1,600,767 Model 3/Y; 53,900 other models). Cites Tesla's official Jan 2, 2026 report. High quality.

3. **Teslaoracle.com (Jan 3, 2026)** - Confirms same production figure: **1,654,667 vehicles** for full year 2025. Minor discrepancies in Q4 figures (434,358 vs 434,385) but full-year number consistent. Medium-high quality.

4. **Best-selling-cars.com (Jan 26, 2026)** - Industry analyst site. Reports 2025 production down 6.7% YoY but doesn't provide absolute number. Notes Tesla lost #1 EV position to BYD. Medium quality for context.

5. **Multiple Chinese sources (Feb 2026)** - Report Shanghai Gigafactory delivered 851,732 vehicles in 2025 (52% of global total). Consistent with ~1.65M global production. Medium quality, regional focus.

**Key convergence:** Three independent sources (Tridenstechnology, Teslarati, Teslaoracle) all cite **1,654,667 vehicles** as 2025 production, sourced from Tesla's official January 2, 2026 report.

**Secondary/contextual sources:**
- AskNews articles confirm the decline narrative, Model S/X discontinuation, strategic pivot to robotics
- Statista sources focus on deliveries (not production) and are incomplete for 2025
- Various analyst opinions about future direction (weak evidence for 2025 actual production)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**
- **Three independent sources confirm 2025 production = 1,654,667 vehicles** - All cite Tesla's official January 2, 2026 report. This is the direct answer to the question. The outcome has already occurred and been officially reported.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
- Historical context shows 2024 production was 1,773,443 (per Tridenstechnology), making 2025's 1,654,667 a 6.7% decline - consistent with reported trends
- Shanghai factory data (851,732 = 52% of total) mathematically supports ~1.64M global total
- Multiple sources confirm this was Tesla's second consecutive year of production decline

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- Analyst predictions for 2026+ (irrelevant to 2025 actual)
- Market share shifts and competitive dynamics (contextual but don't change 2025 actuals)
- Strategic pivots announced (Model S/X discontinuation affects 2026+, not 2025)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Critical observation:** Today is February 9, 2026. Tesla released its 2025 production figures on January 2, 2026 (confirmed by multiple sources). The question asks for 2025 production, which is **historical fact, not a forecast**.

The Metaculus resolution date is March 15, 2026, but the outcome is already determined and publicly reported. This is not a predictive exercise but rather identifying the correct historical figure from official sources.

If the timeframe were different:
- If asked in December 2025: Would need to forecast Q4 production
- If asked for 2026: Would need genuine forecasting based on capacity, demand trends, strategic shifts

## (d) Justification

The outside view analysis (median ~2.4M) was constructed assuming this was a genuine forecast made before 2025 data was available. However, **we now have the actual reported figure: 1,654,667 vehicles**.

This represents a significant downward shift from the outside view for several reasons:

1. **Actual market conditions in 2025** were worse than historical base rates suggested:
   - Second consecutive year of decline (-7% in 2025 after -4% in 2024)
   - Loss of market leadership to BYD
   - Demand headwinds in key markets (Europe -28%, overall deliveries -8.6%)

2. **Strategic pivot away from volume growth:**
   - Model S/X production winding down
   - Focus shifting to robotics, AI, FSD rather than vehicle volume
   - Musk explicitly not forecasting auto sales growth for 2026

3. **The reference class (2015-2024 growth) is no longer analogous** because:
   - Tesla has shifted from pure growth mode to strategic transformation
   - Market saturation in key segments
   - Intensified competition fundamentally changed dynamics

The actual outcome (1.65M) falls well below even the 10th percentile of the outside view (1.5M), demonstrating that 2025 represented a structural break from historical growth patterns.

## Distribution Calibration

Given that multiple reliable sources report the exact same official figure (1,654,667), my prediction should be tightly concentrated around this value. However, I must account for:

1. **Reporting uncertainty:** Different sources might interpret "vehicles produced" slightly differently (e.g., including/excluding certain vehicle types, timing of recognition)
2. **Final reconciliation:** Tesla might issue minor corrections in its formal 10-K filing
3. **Resolution criteria flexibility:** Metaculus might use OICA or alternative sources if there's ambiguity

The distribution should be very narrow but not a point estimate. I'll center on 1,654,667 with small variance to account for potential minor reporting differences or definitional issues.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Total vehicles produced by Tesla in calendar year 2025, per Tesla financial reports. Units: vehicles.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Median ~2.4M based on historical growth. Current circumstances (actual reported data available) render this reference class obsolete for this specific question.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 1,655,000; mean ≈ 1,660,000. This aligns with the officially reported figure of 1,654,667 from multiple independent sources citing Tesla's January 2, 2026 report.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Tesla officially reported 1,654,667 vehicles produced in 2025 (Jan 2, 2026 report)
   - Three independent sources confirm this identical figure
   - Shanghai factory data (851,732) mathematically supports global total
   - Historical context (2024: 1,773,443) confirms 6.7% decline is consistent

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Tesla issues a material correction in its 10-K filing, adjusting the figure by ±50,000 vehicles due to accounting reclassification. This would shift the outcome slightly but not dramatically.

6. **Status quo:** The outcome is already determined and reported. No further change expected unless there's a formal correction.

7. **Technicalities:** Values in vehicles (not thousands), strictly increasing, within bounds [1,000,000 - 10,000,000].
