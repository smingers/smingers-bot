Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CNBC Article (Jan 27, 2021):**
High-quality financial news source reporting Q4 2020 earnings. Key facts: 509,737 vehicles produced in 2020, Tesla projected 50% average annual growth. This is historical context only, predating the forecast period by 5 years.

**Best-selling-cars.com (Jan 26, 2026):**
Industry statistics aggregator, published just 2 weeks before today. Critical facts: 2025 production down 6.7% vs 2024, marking second consecutive year of contraction. Tesla lost #1 EV position to BYD. European sales down 28%. This is highly relevant recent data, though absolute 2025 numbers aren't provided. The outlook mentions analyst predictions of "slight growth in 2026" and potential 3M+ by 2029.

**Investing.com (undated, contains 2025 Q1 data):**
Financial education site. Reports Q1 2025 production of 362,000+ vehicles, with Model Y line changeovers causing "several weeks of production loss." 2024 deliveries: 1,789,226. This provides crucial Q1 2025 baseline data.

**Backlinko (Dec 28, 2023, updated with 2025 data):**
Statistics compilation site. Reports 2024 production: 1,773,443 vehicles (3.93% YoY decrease). Q2 2025 deliveries: 384,000 (14.29% YoY increase). January 2025: 101,101 vehicles sold.

**Stock Titan - Q3 2025 Results (Oct 22, 2025):**
Official Tesla financial results. Q3 2025 production: 447,450 vehicles. Q3 deliveries: 497,099 (up 7% YoY). This is verified, recent quarterly data directly from Tesla.

**Fortune/Lucid comparison (undated, contains 2025 data):**
States "Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025" - this is a key datapoint but appears in an article about Lucid, so credibility for Tesla figures is moderate.

**Fortune - Q2 2025 Earnings (July 24, 2025):**
High-quality financial journalism. Reports vehicle sales down 13% through H1 2025, Musk scrapped full-year growth guidance, warned of "rough quarters" in Q4 2025, Q1-Q2 2026. Low-cost model delayed to Q4 2025. Expert opinion from Gene Munster (Deepwater Asset Management) expressing investor disappointment.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive historical production data 2015-2024 with CAGR of 48.4%. 2024 production: 1,773,443. Current installed capacity: ~3 million vehicles/year. Quality appears good, citing Tesla official sources via Tridens/Backlinko compilations.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. Tesla's own historical production trajectory (2015-2024)
2. Automotive industry production during market transitions
3. High-growth tech companies reaching maturity
4. EV market leader facing increased competition

**Most suitable: Tesla's recent production trajectory (2020-2025)** - This captures the company's transition from hyper-growth to market maturity, including the first production declines. The 2015-2024 CAGR of 48.4% is misleading for 2025 predictions because:
- 2023-2024: -3.93% decline
- 2024-2025: -6.7% decline (per best-selling-cars)
- Clear inflection point from growth to contraction

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Calendar year 2025 (already complete as of today, Feb 9, 2026). Resolution in ~5 weeks when Tesla reports Q4 2025 results.

**Known 2025 quarterly data:**
- Q1 2025: ~362,000 produced
- Q2 2025: ~384,000 (delivery figure, production likely similar)
- Q3 2025: 447,450 produced
- Q4 2025: Unknown

**Cumulative through Q3:** ~1,193,450 vehicles

**Historical Q4 patterns:** Q4 typically represents 27-30% of annual production due to year-end push. However, Fortune article warns of "rough quarters" including Q4 2025.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors pointing to lower production:**
1. Two consecutive years of decline (2024: -3.93%, 2025: -6.7%)
2. Market share loss to BYD
3. Musk scrapped growth guidance mid-2025
4. Sales down 13% through H1 2025
5. Model Y line changeovers caused production disruptions in Q1
6. Cybertruck below expectations
7. Political/regulatory headwinds mentioned

**Key factors pointing to higher production:**
1. Q3 showed 7% YoY delivery growth
2. New lower-priced models launched
3. Installed capacity of ~3M vehicles suggests room for growth
4. Q2 deliveries up 14.29% YoY

**Critical calculation:**
- Fortune article states "Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025"
- Q1-Q3 cumulative: ~1,193,450
- Implied Q4: ~406,550 (if 1.6M total)
- This would represent modest sequential decline from Q3's 447,450

**Cross-validation:**
- 2024 production: 1,773,443
- 1.6M represents -9.8% decline
- Best-selling-cars reported -6.7% decline
- These figures are somewhat inconsistent but both indicate significant contraction

The most reliable figure appears to be the Fortune article's "1.6 million" for full-year 2025, though this requires Q4 confirmation.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- 2024 baseline: 1,773,443 vehicles
- Reported 2025 decline: -6.7% to -9.8%
- This suggests range: 1,600,000 to 1,654,000

**Distribution shape:**
Given we have Q1-Q3 actual data (~1,193,450) and only Q4 is unknown, the uncertainty is relatively constrained. Q4 production historically ranges 400,000-550,000 for Tesla.

**Tail risk considerations:**
- Lower tail: Major Q4 disruption (factory incident, demand collapse) could push Q4 below 350,000, yielding ~1,540,000 total
- Upper tail: Unexpected Q4 surge (unlikely given guidance withdrawal) could reach 550,000, yielding ~1,740,000 total
- The Fortune "1.6M" figure provides strong central tendency

**Calibration to known facts:**
- 10th percentile should account for worse-than-expected Q4 (350K-380K range)
- 90th percentile should account for better-than-guided Q4 (500K-530K range)
- Median should center near 1,600,000-1,620,000 given the Fortune report

**Rate of upsets in automotive production:**
Moderate - quarterly variations of ±10% are common, but annual figures are more stable. Given we have 75% of year actual, distribution should be relatively tight.
