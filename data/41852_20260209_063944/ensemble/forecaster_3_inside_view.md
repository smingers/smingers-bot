Analysis:
**Target variable / resolution criteria:** Total number of Tesla vehicles **produced** (all street-legal 4+ wheel vehicles) in **calendar year 2025**, as reported in Tesla financial/official production reports; units = vehicles.

### (a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)
- **Teslarati (Jan 2, 2026)**: EV-focused outlet summarizing Tesla’s official Q4/FY 2025 production & deliveries release. **High relevance**; likely accurate transcription of Tesla IR figures. Reports **2025 production = 1,654,667** with model splits. Mostly factual.
- **TeslaOracle (Jan 3, 2026)**: EV news/blog repeating the same Tesla release; includes minor internal inconsistencies in the intro line vs table (e.g., 434,358 vs 434,385). Still, the **annual total 1,654,667** matches others. **Moderate quality**; factual core, some sloppiness.
- **TridensTechnology stats page (Feb 2026)**: Statistics compilation attributing to Tesla official reports/social posts. It reports **2025 production = 1,654,667**, but the model-category breakdown shown in the prompt summary appears inconsistent with known Tesla splits (suggesting possible extraction/formatting issues). **Moderate quality** as a secondary aggregator; use mainly for cross-checking totals.
- **Best-selling-cars.com (Jan 26, 2026)**: Industry sales/production commentary and outlook; provides % changes and competitive context (BYD, Europe) but not the absolute production total in the excerpt. **Moderate quality**; useful context, not necessary for the resolved number.
- **AskNews articles citing Tesla official data (Jan 2–Feb 5, 2026, various languages/outlets)**: Multiple pieces repeat the same figures and often explicitly say “official data confirms… produced **1,654,667** in 2025.” Individual outlet quality varies, but **the convergence across many independent reprints strongly suggests a single underlying official Tesla release.**
- **Statista (deliveries through Q3 2025)**: Not directly answering production, and incomplete for full-year 2025. **Low relevance** to the final 2025 production number.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (large shift / high confidence):**
- **Multiple independent secondary sources (Teslarati, TeslaOracle, Chinese outlets, Tridens) converge on the same exact full-year production total: 1,654,667.** This is highly diagnostic because Tesla publicly releases quarterly and annual production totals; the identical integer total across sources is typical of direct transcription from Tesla IR.
- **Temporal proximity / event already occurred:** 2025 is complete; Tesla’s Q4/FY release occurred **Jan 2, 2026**, and FY financial results occurred late Jan 2026. The quantity is effectively already “known,” pending any rare restatement.

**Moderate evidence (minor adjustments / uncertainty sizing):**
- Minor discrepancies in some articles’ *quarterly* figures (typos) suggest non-zero risk of transcription error in any single secondary source; but that risk is greatly reduced by **cross-source agreement** on the annual total.
- Potential for slightly different “alternative” figures (e.g., OICA) if Tesla didn’t report; but Tesla *did* report, so this mainly affects tail risk.

**Weak evidence (small or none):**
- Opinions about demand weakness, Musk politics, incentives ending, etc. These help explain why production fell vs prior trend, but **do not materially affect** the already-reported 2025 total.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time until resolution:** About **5 weeks** (to 2026-03-15).
- If the remaining time were **halved**, I’d tighten the distribution slightly (less room for restatement/ambiguity).
- If the remaining time were **doubled**, I’d widen slightly to account for small chances of definitional disputes or restated annual reporting—still unlikely.

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view
**Outside view base rate distribution (given):**
- P10 1540000; P20 1570000; P40 1600000; P60 1630000; P80 1670000; P90 1710000.

**Inside view update:**
- The outside view was built when Q4 uncertainty remained and when some sources only suggested “~1.6M.”
- Now we have **post-year, post-release reporting** widely citing an exact figure: **1,654,667** vehicles produced in 2025.
- This new information is **strong evidence** and makes the earlier reference-class uncertainty largely moot. The remaining uncertainty is mostly about: (i) whether Metaculus uses a slightly different “official” number (unlikely), (ii) rare restatements, or (iii) transcription/rounding differences in secondary sources. Hence the distribution should collapse tightly around ~1.655M, but not to a single point.

Distribution calibration
- **Status quo / current-trend continuation:** Tesla’s already-issued FY 2025 production total remains the same through resolution.
- I center the distribution near **1,654,667**, with modest width (tens of thousands) to account for low-probability ambiguity/restatement/alternate sourcing.
- Sanity check for ±10% perturbation: ±10% would imply ~1.49M to ~1.82M, which is inconsistent with the convergence on the exact reported figure; so tails should be far tighter than the outside view.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** Tesla’s total **vehicles produced** in **calendar year 2025**, per Tesla financial/official reports; units = vehicles.  
2) **Outside view used:** (1540000, 1570000, 1600000, 1630000, 1670000, 1710000).  
3) **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ 1654500; mean ≈ 1655000; yes—aligned with the repeatedly reported **1,654,667**.  
4) **Key evidence (facts):**
   - Tesla Q4/FY 2025 release (as transcribed by multiple outlets) reports **2025 production = 1,654,667**.
   - Many independent reprints in multiple languages cite the **same exact integer**, indicating a single official source.
   - 2025 is complete; the only remaining uncertainty is reporting/definition edge cases, not operational performance.  
5) **Blind spot:** A late **restatement/definition change** (or Metaculus choosing an alternative source with a different total) could shift the resolved number slightly (up or down).  
6) **Status quo outcome:** Keep the already-published FY total near **1.655M**.  
7) **Technicalities:** Strictly increasing percentiles; units are vehicles.
