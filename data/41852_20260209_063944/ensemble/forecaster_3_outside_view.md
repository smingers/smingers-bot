Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)

1) **CNBC (Jan 27, 2021)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Tesla reported **509,737 produced in 2020**; and publicly communicated an aspiration of **~50% average annual growth in deliveries** over a multi‑year horizon.
- **Quality:** High-quality business journalism with clear linkage to Tesla IR statements; **but dated** and reflects an early-stage growth era and management aspiration, not a binding commitment.
- **Opinions:** Some commentary on valuation/FSD; not directly useful for 2025 production level.

2) **Best-selling-cars.com (Jan 26, 2026)**
- **What it provides (facts as claimed):** States **2025 production down 6.7% vs 2024** and deliveries down 8.6% vs 2024; does **not** give the absolute 2025 production number.
- **Quality:** Useful directional summary but **secondary** (not Tesla IR). Still, dated **after 2025**, so it is describing historical outcomes rather than forecasts.
- **Opinions:** Contains narrative about losing BEV leadership to BYD and analyst outlooks; those are interpretive.

3) **Investing.com “Tesla facts” (undated in prompt; includes Q1 2025 figures)**
- **What it provides (facts as claimed):** **Q1 2025 production ~362,000** with explanation about Model Y changeovers.
- **Quality:** Secondary compilation; plausible but should be cross-checked with Tesla quarterly production/deliveries releases. Some internal inconsistencies noted in the excerpt (references to “Q3 2025 earnings” around Q1 data).
- **Opinions:** Named analyst quote about margins/revenue; not a hard production datapoint.

4) **Backlinko Tesla stats (dated Dec 28, 2023 but appears updated)**
- **What it provides (facts as claimed):** **2024 production 1,773,443**; plus scattered 2025 snippets.
- **Quality:** Secondary compilation; the timestamp inconsistency reduces confidence in provenance, but the **2024 total matches other compilations** (and is widely reported).

5) **Stock Titan (Oct 22, 2025) — Tesla Q3 2025 results**
- **What it provides (facts):** **Q3 2025 production 447,450** and deliveries 497,099; plus other financial metrics.
- **Quality:** Appears to be a repost/summary of Tesla’s quarterly release. Since it reports a specific quarter figure, it’s a **useful anchor** for 2025 run-rate by late 2025.

6) **Finviz news summary (Motley Fool / Lucid article; published after 2025)**
- **What it provides (fact as claimed):** States **“Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025.”**
- **Quality:** This is **tertiary** (a Tesla number embedded in an article about Lucid). The “1.6 million” is likely rounded and could be imprecise, but it strongly suggests the true value is in the **~1.6–1.7M** band.

7) **Fortune (Jul 24, 2025)**
- **What it provides (facts/opinions):** Describes mid‑2025 demand/operational headwinds; Musk scrapping guidance; low-cost model delayed.
- **Quality:** Good journalism for **context**, but not a direct production total. Helpful for explaining why 2025 might be down vs 2024.

8) **Agent report (compiled historical production 2015–2024; capacity notes)**
- **What it provides (facts as compiled):** Annual production series through **2024 = 1,773,443**, and an estimated **~3M installed capacity** heading into 2025 (from secondary sources).
- **Quality:** Useful synthesis for trend/base-rate work, but relies on **secondary compilers (Tridens/Backlinko/Electrek)** rather than primary Tesla PDFs in the excerpt.

**Bottom line on sources:** Multiple secondary sources converge on: (i) 2024 production = **1,773,443**; (ii) 2025 production was **down mid‑single digits**; (iii) a rounded claim of **~1.6M** in 2025. That’s enough to form a strong outside-view baseline near **~1.65M**.

### (b) Reference class analysis (possible classes; suitability; chosen class)

**Candidate reference classes**
1) **Tesla year-over-year production changes in its “mature ramp” phase (2022–2024).**
   - Pros: Closest operational regime: multiple plants online, growth constrained more by demand/product transitions than by pure factory ramp.
   - Cons: Only a few years → noisy.

2) **Tesla long-run growth era (2015–2024 CAGR ~48%).**
   - Pros: Big-picture identity of Tesla as a grower.
   - Cons: Not comparable: early years are dominated by scaling from a small base; extrapolating 48–50% growth into 2025 conflicts with capacity/demand realities.

3) **Large global OEM EV output changes during demand slowdowns.**
   - Pros: Captures “EV demand digestion” dynamics.
   - Cons: Less directly comparable because Tesla’s product mix and vertical integration are unusual.

**Chosen reference class:** **Tesla 2022–2024 production + near-term capacity/demand constraint context.**
- Rationale: By 2024 Tesla is already at ~1.8M/yr; changes in 2025 are likely to be **incremental (+/− 10%)**, not exponential.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- The outcome year (**calendar 2025**) is complete. From “today” (2026‑02‑09) to Metaculus resolution (2026‑03‑15) is ~**5 weeks**, so remaining uncertainty is mainly **reporting/definition/rounding**, not operational.
- Historically, Tesla’s annual production:
  - 2023: **1,845,985**
  - 2024: **1,773,443** (about **−3.9% YoY**)
- With 2024 already declining, the most relevant “pattern over similar periods” is **a plateau/decline regime**, not high growth.

### (d) Justification for an outside-view prediction

**Outside view baseline:** Start from 2024 production **1,773,443**.

Given the most directly relevant secondary claim (**2025 production down 6.7% vs 2024**), a mechanical outside-view estimate is:
- 1,773,443 × (1 − 0.067) = **1,654,623**.

This aligns with the Finviz/Motley Fool embedded statement that Tesla produced **~1.6M** in 2025 (consistent if rounded down), and it is directionally consistent with 2025 headwinds described mid‑year (Fortune) plus the narrative of a second consecutive contraction (best-selling-cars).

**So the outside-view central tendency** should be near **1.65M vehicles**.

**Uncertainty (why not a super tight distribution):**
- Several sources are secondary/tertiary and may use rounded figures.
- Possible definitional differences (e.g., inclusion/exclusion of certain categories) are unlikely but not impossible.
- “Upset rate” in this domain: reporting is usually stable, but **secondary reporting errors** of ±1–3% happen; larger errors are rarer but possible.

Therefore, I’ll keep a **moderately wide** 10th–90th interval (~±7–8% around the center), while still reflecting that 2025 is already largely knowable.

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor distribution:** Center around **~1,655,000** derived from the 6.7% down figure.
- **Skew:** Slightly more mass below 2024 than above it, since multiple sources explicitly describe 2025 as down vs 2024.
- **Tail thinking:**
  - **Low tail:** Would require a much sharper demand/production shock than suggested (e.g., extended shutdowns, major supply disruptions). Possible but not supported by the given facts.
  - **High tail:** Would require 2025 to be flat/down only slightly vs 2024, conflicting with the “down 6.7%” claim—still possible if that percentage is wrong.
