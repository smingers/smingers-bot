Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Tesla IR production/deliveries release (02 Jan 2026, quoted by Teslarati, Teslaoracle, Tridens, Chinese media). Facts: 2025 production = 1 654 667; deliveries = 1 636 129; model-level split. Primary, contemporaneous, very high quality.  
2. Tesla Q4/FY-2025 10-K & earnings call (28-29 Jan 2026, Investing.com, Sina Finance). Facts match source #1; adds confirmation that figure is audited. Primary, very high quality.  
3. Best-selling-cars.com (26 Jan 2026). States production –6.7 % YoY without absolute number. Secondary, medium quality, corroborates “decline” direction.  
4. Statista deliveries series (Oct 2025). Provides only deliveries through Q3. Not directly relevant; used to confirm no hidden late-year surge.  
5. News articles (Feb 2026 – DW, t3n, etc.). All quote 2025 production ≈1.65 M or “about 1.6 M”. Tertiary, but independent and consistent in direction.  
No credible source contradicts the 1 654 667 figure; opinions about Tesla strategy do not affect the counted units.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (high weight)  
• Two independent primary documents (#1 & #2) give the identical production total.  
Moderate evidence  
• Multiple secondary outlets repeat the same total or a rounded 1.6 M, confirming there is no alternative figure in circulation.  
Weak evidence  
• References to demand weakness, political issues explain the decline but do not affect the already-reported total.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome year is finished; Metaculus resolves in ~5 weeks.  Further revisions are very unlikely: Tesla has never materially restated an annual production total after the 10-K.  If resolution were tomorrow the forecast would be identical; if resolution were a year away I would still expect ±0.2 % maximum drift due to definitional clarifications.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view baseline (derived from 2024 total 1 773 443 and –6.7 % YoY media claim) was 1 654 600.  Primary documents now confirm 1 654 667, so I collapse most residual uncertainty to narrow measurement/rounding error and the small chance (≈5 %) that Metaculus will substitute a slightly different figure (e.g., inclusion of late-reported Semi units).  Range widened asymmetrically to allow for a possible modest upward revision (Tesla occasionally adds a few thousand units in the Form 10-K compared with the 02 Jan press release; never a downward revision so far).

Distribution calibration
Median anchored at 1 655 000.  10th/90th percentiles placed ±0.9 %/ +1.6 % from the median, giving enough mass for rare bookkeeping surprises yet reflecting near-certainty today.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: total Tesla vehicles produced in calendar-year 2025 (street-legal, ≥4 wheels), units = vehicles.  
2. Outside-view distribution centred 1.65 M; inside view still centred there, slightly tighter.  
3. Consistency check: median 1 655 000; mean ≈1 656 000; matches evidence and rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Tesla 02 Jan 2026 production release 1 654 667; (ii) Tesla 10-K filed 29 Jan 2026 confirms same; (iii) Yr-on-yr decline narrative supports magnitude; (iv) No conflicting data found.  
5. Blind-spot: Metaculus decides to count a few thousand Semis produced but not reported separately, pushing result upward.  
6. Status-quo outcome equals Tesla’s published total. A slight upward nudge is prudent.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; all in requested units.
