Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CNBC, Jan-2021 (Kolodny).  Primary reporting on Tesla’s 2020 results and long-term 50 % growth target.  Good factual quality; dated, but useful for a long-run base rate.  
2. Best-selling-cars, Jan-2026 (Bekker).  Automobile trade site summarising 2025 global EV market; offers only relative (%-change) numbers for Tesla.  Medium reliability, clearly separated facts and analyst commentary.  
3. Investing.com “Tesla facts”, Apr-2025 (Shvartsman).  Collates Q1-2025 figures yet mixes them with forward-looking remarks and a few chronology errors.  Usable with caution.  
4. Backlinko stats page, updated after Dec-2023.  Scrapes Tesla investor letters; good for historical series, less so for forward guidance.  
5. Stock Titan, Oct-2025.  Reprints Tesla Q3-2025 shareholder letter numbers verbatim.  High factual quality.  
6. Fortune, Jul-2025.  Financial press summarising Q2 earnings call; contains both numbers and Musk/analyst opinions.  Factual bits (margins, guidance withdrawn) are reliable.  
7. Finviz / Motley Fool, Feb-2026 (Lucid article).  Secondary source that quotes “Tesla produced 1.6 M vehicles in 2025”.  Single-line claim, not independently verified—low weight.  
8. Agent report.  Pulls production 2015-2024 from Tesla update letters; cites plant capacity figures pieced together from trade articles.  Reasonable internal consistency; treat as a curated compilation of primary data.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Options considered:  
• “Hyper-growth tech hardware firms” – too heterogeneous, many never reach multi-million unit scale.  
• “Global auto OEMs during early EV ramp” – sample size still small.  
• “Tesla’s own historical vehicle production series 2015-2024” – ten annual observations, directly measures the variable of interest, already integrates the firm’s plant-ramp learning curve, demand swings and supply shocks.  

Given its direct relevance and the lack of a broader but equally specific dataset, I choose Tesla’s 2015-2024 production history as the main reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 9 Feb 2026.  Tesla traditionally releases full-year production in the first week of January, so the outcome is in practice already fixed though not yet formally resolved by the platform (~35 days until Metaculus close).  Over comparable one-year horizons (e.g., 2016-2024) Tesla’s year-on-year growth ranged from –4 % to +148 %; the inter-quartile range is +35 % to +50 %.

(d) Justification  
• Trend extrapolation.  A log-linear regression on 2015-2024 production implies 2.6 M units in 2025 (continuing the long-run ~49 % CAGR).  
• Deceleration signal.  2023→2024 slipped –4 %; last-3-year CAGR is only +23 %.  If that rate persisted, 2025 would land near 2.2 M.  
• Capacity ceiling.  Installed nameplate capacity entering 2025 ≈3 M/yr.  Thus anything above ~3.2 M would require a step-change in utilisation or new plants—possible but not base-rate.  
• Downside floor.  Even if 2025 repeated 2024’s volume drop (–4 %), output would still be ≈1.7 M.  A larger collapse would be historically unprecedented for Tesla absent a global recession or catastrophic plant outage.  

Combining those base-rate considerations, a central outside-view figure around 2.3-2.4 M appears reasonable, with generous tails acknowledging both a second down year and a re-acceleration toward nameplate capacity.

Outside view calibration:
I anchor the median near 2.4 M and spread the distribution so that one ‘typical’ σ (≈30 %) covers most historical variation.  The 10th percentile is set slightly below a repeat of 2024’s output and the 90th percentile just beyond 80 % utilisation of current capacity.  Historical “upset” rate (absolute YoY change outside ±40 %) occurred twice in nine observations (~22 %); the chosen tails give roughly that cumulative probability.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 1500000
Percentile 20: 1700000
Percentile 40: 2100000
Percentile 60: 2400000
Percentile 80: 2800000
Percentile 90: 3300000
