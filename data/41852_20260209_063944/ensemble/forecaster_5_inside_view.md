Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, strongest first)
   • Tesla Q4 & FY 2025 Vehicle Production/Delivery release (TESLARATI 2 Jan 2026, Teslaoracle 3 Jan 2026, Shanghai media 5 Feb 2026). Directly cites Tesla’s official IR table: 1 654 667 vehicles produced in calendar-year 2025. Primary, contemporaneous, and audited in the forthcoming 10-K → very high reliability, factual.  
   • Tridens Technology statistics piece (Feb 2026). Re-states the same 1 654 667 figure, gives model split. Independently compiled but clearly using Tesla IR numbers → high quality, corroborating.  
   • Best-selling-cars (26 Jan 2026) and a variety of financial-press articles state “~-6.7 % YoY, loss of global BEV crown”, consistent with a total in the mid-1.6 M range. Moderate quality confirmation.  
   • Statista & AskNews quarterly snippets focus on deliveries, not production, therefore only indirectly useful; quality acceptable but lower relevance.  
   • All opinion content (Elon Musk strategy, analyst commentary, robotics pivot, etc.) is ignored for the numeric resolution.

2. Evidence analysis
   Strong evidence: Three independent outlets quoting Tesla’s official 1 654 667 production figure; historical practice that Tesla never revises this number after the 10-K.  
   Moderate evidence: –6.7 % YoY and factory-level disclosures exactly match the headline figure.  
   Weak evidence: Any commentary suggesting last-minute restatements or alternative counting methods—no such indications to date.

3. Time-frame analysis
   • Resolution due in ~35 days (15 Mar 2026). 2025 production is already fixed; only risk is a post-audit restatement by Tesla or the platform deciding to use a third-party figure.  
   • If the horizon were halved (~17 days) nothing changes; if doubled, tiny extra chance (<1 %) of an accounting revision could widen the tails slightly.

4. Justification / inside-view shift
   Outside-view base (constructed pre-earnings) had a median of 1.64 M and 80 % CI 1.45–1.80 M.  
   The arrival of Tesla’s official number collapses most residual uncertainty. Historical precedent (2013-2024) shows zero material revisions after the 10-K; Metaculus has always taken Tesla IR at face value.  
   Remaining uncertainty drivers:  
     • Metaculus could classify the handful of pre-production Cybertruck validation units differently (±100–300 units).  
     • A rare audit re-statement (never happened before, but non-zero).  
   I therefore recenter on 1 655 k and shrink the credible interval to ~±15 k (10th–90th). Small fat-tail allowance (±2 %) is retained for the unlikely scenarios above.

Distribution calibration
Implied distribution: approx. normal with μ = 1 655 000, σ ≈ 6 000, then fat-tail blended to yield a 10th–90th span of 30 000 units.  
Mean ≈ 1 655 000; median ≈ 1 655 000 — matches justification and checks against historical stability.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Total street-legal vehicles Tesla reports produced in CY 2025, units = vehicles.  
2. Base rate anchored, then tightened by hard FY 2025 data.  
3. Consistency check: median = 1.655 M; mean similar; aligns with evidence.  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   – Tesla IR press release: 1 654 667 vehicles.  
   – Multiple media reprints corroborate same figure.  
   – No historic precedent for post-audit revision.  
   – Metaculus historically trusts Tesla IR numbers verbatim.  
5. Blind-spot: SEC-driven restatement drops/raises production by >25 k, pushing outcome outside my 10–90 % band (would move figure down or up).  
6. Status-quo outcome = Tesla IR figure; forecast leans toward it.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units correct.
