Analysis:  
(a) Source analysis  
1. CNBC, Jan-2021 – Historical. 100 % factual for 2020 baseline; guidance (50 % CAGR) is management optimism, treated as opinion.  
2. Best-selling-cars, 26-Jan-2026 – Gives relative changes for 2025 vs 2024 and the qualitative statement that Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD. The site routinely recycles official registration data, so data quality is moderate, but it does not quote the absolute 2025 volume, only “-6.7 %”.  
3. Investing.com statistics page – Collates Tesla IR figures; Q1-2025 production (362 k) and 2024 full-year production/deliveries. Credible because numbers line up with Tesla update letters; minor date inconsistencies noted.  
4. Backlinko statistics page – Table produced from Tesla IR PDFs; quality similar to Investing.com. Q2-2025 delivery number (384 k) probably scraped from Tesla’s July-2025 production release, so viewed as factual.  
5. Stock-Titan, 22-Oct-2025 – Tesla’s own Q3-2025 press release (re-hosted). Direct primary data for Q3-2025 production (447 k). High quality.  
6. Motley-Fool/Fortune (July-2025) – Earnings-call colour. Useful only for demand/margin sentiment, not for hard production counts.  
7. Lucid-comparison piece, Dec-2025 – Mentions “Tesla produced 1.6 million vehicles in 2025”. Because this is written after Q4-end, the author is almost certainly repeating preliminary Tesla guidance. Treated as a soft but helpful data point.  
8. Agent report – Tabulates official Tesla production 2015-2024 and installed capacity (~3 M/y). Built from Tesla filings; high quality.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
i. Tesla’s own year-on-year production series (2018-2024);  
ii. Other fast-growing auto OEMs after reaching 1–2 M units (e.g., Hyundai 1998-2005, BYD 2017-2024);  
iii. Full US-based OEMs after their first global demand plateau.  
Class (i) is the most relevant: same management, factories, supplier base, brand and exposure to EV-specific demand shocks. It already internalises Tesla’s tendency to issue optimistic guidance and then under- or over-perform by ±10-15 %. Therefore I choose reference class (i).

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 9 Feb 2026. Tesla’s official “2025 production & deliveries” press release normally appears in the first week of January (the 2024 release came 2 Jan 2025). So the true number is already known to Tesla and will be published publicly within ~3 weeks (Q4 & FY results scheduled mid-Feb). From the outside we possess three quarters of hard data and one independent press rumour. Historically Tesla’s Q4 production is within ±5 % of Q3 when no new plant turns on or off.

(d) Justification  
Base rate: Using the 2018-2024 series, median Y/Y growth over the last three years was +36 %, but momentum has clearly slowed: +35 % (2023) → –4 % (2024). A naïve random-walk on growth with mean reversion would give a central estimate around 0 % growth for 2025, i.e., 1.77 M vehicles.

Inside-view adjustment:  
• Q1-2025 = 362 k (-2 % YoY), Q2 = ~400 k (+4 % YoY), Q3 = 447 k (+7 % YoY). Cumulative 1 209 k through three quarters.  
• Factory downtime for Model Y refresh in Q1 is already baked in; no new factories came online in Q4. Assuming Q4 production equals 400–430 k (typical seasonality 0.9–1.0× Q3 when there is no Christmas shutdown in Shanghai) gives a likely full-year band of 1.61–1.64 M.  
• The “-6.7 %” figure from Best-selling-cars and the 1.6 M statement from the Lucid comparison article independently point to ~1.65 M.  
Combining base rate and quarterly evidence shifts the median down from the 1.77 M base to ~1.64 M.

Uncertainty drivers:  
Upside: Faster Q4 ramp of refreshed Model Y or early Cybertruck line lift could push production to ~1.8 M.  
Downside: Prolonged Q4 re-tooling, logistics snarls, or a deliberate inventory drawdown could dip to ~1.45 M.  
Tail risk: Catastrophic plant outage (fire, geopolitical shutdown) could drop output below 1.2 M, but Tesla has 4 geographically dispersed plants; historical frequency ≈1 %/year.

Outside view calibration:  
I construct a symmetric P-distribution centred on 1.64 M with σ ≈ 0.12 M (≈7 %). I manually fatten tails to reflect 5 % chance each of >1.9 M or <1.45 M, wider than a pure normal. This yields:

Outside View Prediction:
