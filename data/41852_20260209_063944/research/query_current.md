Analysis:
The most decisive evidence will be Tesla’s own “Vehicle Production & Deliveries” press release that historically comes out in the first week of January and states the full-year totals (e.g., Jan 2 2026 for 2025 data). Secondary value comes from earnings‐call transcripts, SEC 10-K filings, and industry tallies (OICA, analysts) that quote or confirm the number or explain any revisions. Therefore, the search should focus on locating Tesla’s January 2026 production press release and related coverage that cites the exact 2025 figure, as well as follow-up commentary that might clarify if any categories (e.g., Cybertruck, Semi) are excluded or adjusted.
