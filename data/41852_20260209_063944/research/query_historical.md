Analysis:
To forecast Tesla’s 2025 production, the most useful historical context is:
• Official vehicle-production totals Tesla has reported each calendar year (especially 2018-2024) to quantify the growth trajectory.  
• Management guidance and analyst coverage on future capacity additions (Austin, Berlin, Shanghai expansions, Mexico, etc.) that affect 2025 output.  
• Installed production capacity reported in Tesla’s 10-Ks and shareholder decks, which can bound realistic 2025 volumes.  
• Any 2024 full-year production figure (released in January 2025) because it anchors the last observed data point before the forecast year.  
The queries below aim to pull those data from Tesla investor relations pages, recent news coverage of 2025 guidance, and a synthesized list of annual production numbers.
