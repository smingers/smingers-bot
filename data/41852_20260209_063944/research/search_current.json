VW sold approximately 275,000 all-electric vehicles across Europe, a 56% increase from the previous year, driven largely by strong demand for models like the ID 7. In contrast, Tesla's European sales declined by 27% to 237,000 vehicles, attributed to a limited product lineup and rising competition from Chinese manufacturers. Despite this, Tesla's Model Y remained the best-selling EV model in Europe, though its sales dropped by 28%. The Skoda Elroq (a VW Group model) ranked second, followed by the Tesla Model 3, which saw a 24% sales decline. Overall, the European EV market grew by 29%, with EVs capturing 20% of new registrations, up from previous years. Jato Dynamics cited not only Chinese brands but also European models produced in China\u2014such as the Mini Cooper, Dacia Spring, and Cupra Tavascan\u2014as key factors in increased competition. Additionally, Tesla's declining sales were linked to Elon Musk's involvement in U.S. politics and a 36% drop in brand value. However, Tesla's stock performance diverged sharply: the share price reached a record high of $499 in December 2025, driven by investor confidence in the Robotaxi and humanoid robot Optimus projects.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 06:09 PM\nSource:[t3n Magazin](https://t3n.de/news/tesla-volkswagen-e-autos-europa-1728649/)\n\n**Tesla's Future Vision Drives Massive Investment Surge Amid Mixed Financial Results and High Valuation**\nTesla's stock reacted with a significant decline following the release of its 2025 financial results on January 28, 2026, despite a slight recovery afterward. The company reported a 3.1% year-over-year decline in Q4 revenue to $24.9 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates of $25.11 billion. Electric vehicle sales dropped 15.6% to 418,227 units, attributed to the expiration of U.S. subsidies in September 2024, which led to a pre-emptive surge in purchases during Q3. The 'pure' auto revenue, excluding CO2 credits and leasing, fell 10.2% to $16.8 billion. However, the gross margin in the auto segment improved from 15.4% to 17.9% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The energy and storage, as well as service, businesses performed strongly. Overall, EBIT declined 10% year-over-year to $1.41 billion, with a margin of 5.7%, slightly below the prior year\u2019s 6.2% but above the $1.32 billion expectation. The adjusted earnings per share dropped 31.5% to $0.50, capital expenditures decreased 14% to $2.4 billion, and free cash flow fell 30% to $1.4 billion. Elon Musk emphasized that 2025 was a pivotal year as Tesla transitioned from a hardware-focused business to a physical AI company, prioritizing Full Self-Driving (FSD), the Robo-Taxi Cybercab, Optimus robots, and AI. FSD user count rose 38% to 1.1 million, though 70% were prepaying customers; from the current quarter, FSD is only available via a $99 monthly subscription, which Musk warned would pressure near-term auto profitability. Musk did not forecast auto sales growth for 2026, with Model S and X production ending in Q2 2026 to shift toward Optimus production, with the Optimus Gen 3 launch expected by end-2026. The Cybercab and Tesla Semi volume production is also planned for 2026. Massive investments are expected in solar cells, batteries, AI infrastructure, and in-house AI chips. Capital expenditures are projected to exceed $20 billion in 2026\u2014a rise of at least 135% from 2025. Musk is also considering building a proprietary chip fabrication plant, citing that Samsung, TSMC, and Micron may not meet Tesla\u2019s chip demand within 3\u20134 years. Additionally, Tesla is investing $2.0 billion in xAI, Musk\u2019s AI venture, with deep collaboration expected. For 2025, revenue declined 2.9% to $94.8 billion. Analysts project 2026 revenue to grow 10.1% to $104.4 billion, with EBIT increasing 44.2% to $6.3 billion, improving the margin from 4.6% to 6.0%. The market capitalization stands at $1.56 trillion, with an enterprise value of $1.52 trillion after deducting $35.7 billion in net cash. This implies a 242.0x EV/EBIT multiple for 2026, indicating an extremely high valuation, with the 2027 multiple at 88.9x based on a projected EBIT of $17.1 billion\u2014still astronomically high and contingent on over 50% growth. The 2026 P/E ratio is 141.7. Despite skepticism about Tesla\u2019s ability to execute Musk\u2019s ambitious vision amid rising competition in EVs, autonomous driving, robotics, and AI, the stock may continue sideways movement as investors remain optimistic. A surprise announcement from Musk could reignite enthusiasm and drive the stock toward record highs. The high volatility is reflected in discount certificates on Tesla, such as the one with ISIN DE000PJ79EX2, offering a maximum potential return of 16.2% (26.4% p.a.) if the stock remains above $370 at maturity on September 18, 2026; the break-even point is $318.40.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 01:59 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/tesla--zukunftsvision-vorantreiben-mit-massivem-anstieg-der-investitionen-200505938)\n\n**Automotive and Parts Industry Weekly Report: Tesla's Third-Generation Robot Set to Launch...**\nThe automotive and auto parts industry weekly report highlights a -5.08% decline in the auto sector, with commercial vehicles performing best among sub-sectors.

The Ministry of Finance projected that over 11.5 million cars will be replaced under the 2025 'old-for-new' policy, with new energy vehicles accounting for nearly 60% of sales. Shanghai offers up to 15,000 RMB in subsidies for new energy vehicle purchases and up to 13,000 RMB for vehicles under 2.0L. Tesla announced its third-generation humanoid robot will be unveiled, designed from first principles, capable of learning from human behavior, with a planned annual production capacity of 1 million units starting in late 2026 at the Fremont plant.\u957f\u5b89\u6c7d\u8f66 aims to achieve mass production of humanoid robots by 2028 and launch commercial air taxi flights by 2030. The automotive industry's profit margin dropped to 1.8% in December 2025, down from 4.1% in December 2024, with annual average profit margin at 4.1%\u2014the second consecutive year at historic lows, below the 5.9% industrial average. Revenue fell 0.8% YoY, costs rose 0.8% YoY, and profit fell 57.4% YoY due to pricing pressure and high production costs. Aptiv completed the spin-off of its Electrical Distribution Systems (EDS) business as Versigent (VGNT) on April 1, 2026. Eaton plans to split its Vehicle & Vehicle Electrification Group into a standalone company, expected by Q1 2027. A new mandatory national standard for automotive steering systems will take effect on July 1, 2026, setting technical and safety requirements for line-by-line steering, traditional systems, and auxiliary devices. Zijin Motor announced the launch of the LS9 Hyper SUV, the first production SUV with full-line electronic steering, certified by the China Automotive Center for reliability, and equipped with SAIC's first mass-produced three-motor vector four-wheel drive system.

As of the end of 2025, domestic pure EV stock reached 899,000 units, with an estimated 910,000 units by January 2026. Accelerated by early confirmation of national EV subsidies, new and updated model releases, and price reductions, EV sales have surged\u2014exceeding 200,000 units annually for the first time in 2025 and overcoming a temporary market plateau. With monthly sales averaging 20,000\u201330,000 units (excluding January), analysts expect cumulative EV registrations to cross 1 million by March\u2013April 2026. However, rapid EV growth is accompanied by growing concerns over market erosion by foreign EVs, particularly from China. The domestic EV share is declining while imported EVs surpassed 30% of the market for the first time in 2025, with BYD and Tesla each selling over 1,000 units in January 2026. As a result, experts emphasize the need to move beyond current subsidy policies and implement strategic industrial support to strengthen the domestic EV sector. Stronger incentives for high-performance, low-cost domestically produced EVs are being advocated to boost consumer preference. KAMA Chairman Kang Nam-hoon stressed the urgency of maintaining and enhancing domestic production capacity, calling for expanded production tax credits to ensure local EVs gain real market competitiveness.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 07:00 AM\nSource:[IT \uc804\ubb38 \ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138 \uc804\uc790\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.etnews.com/20260206000223?SNS=00002)\n\n**Tesla Puts Its Money Where Its Mouth Is in the Biggest Way Possible**\nTesla announced it will end production of its high-end Model S and Model X vehicles in the second quarter of 2026, repurposing the California factory space for the assembly line of its humanoid robot, Optimus. According to CEO Elon Musk, this marks an 'honorable discharge' of the Model S and X programs as Tesla shifts focus toward autonomy, AI, and robotics. The move follows prior steps: Tesla stopped accepting new orders for the Model S and X in China in April 2025 due to tariffs and in Europe by late 2025 due to low demand. Combined deliveries of the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck totaled 50,850 units in 2025\u2014just over 3% of Tesla\u2019s total 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. This strategic pivot signals Tesla\u2019s transformation beyond being solely an electric vehicle manufacturer, with long-term goals including producing up to one million Optimus robots annually. The article emphasizes that this shift increases uncertainty, but also offers high upside, urging investors to reassess their original investment thesis and determine whether they still align with Tesla\u2019s evolving vision.

Musk described the move as an 'honorable discharge' of the Model S and X programs, signaling Tesla\u2019s strategic pivot toward autonomy, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics.

According to an analysis by Jato Dynamics published on February 5, 2026, Volkswagen's sales increased by 56% compared to 2024. The growth is attributed primarily to the success of new models, especially the mid-size ID.7. In contrast, Tesla's sales declined by 27% year-on-year, partly due to its reliance on outdated vehicle models and reputational challenges stemming from CEO Elon Musk's support of far-right political parties in Europe. A recent study cited by Tagesschau indicates that Tesla has the worst brand reputation among companies in Germany.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 07:45 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/uk/volkswagen-obignav-tesla-i-stav-liderom-z-prodazu-elektromobiliv-u-evropi/a-75857120)\n\n**Discontinuing Flagship Models: What's Behind Tesla's Strategic Pivot to AI and Robotics?**\nTesla has announced the discontinuation of its Model S and Model X vehicles starting in the next quarter, according to CEO Elon Musk, who stated that the move marks the 'glorious retirement' of these flagship models as Tesla transitions toward a future centered on autonomous driving and robotics. The two models, produced at Tesla's Fremont, California factory since their launch in 2012 and 2015 respectively, have cumulatively sold over 2 million units and played a pivotal role in transforming Tesla from a startup into an industry leader. However, with Model Y and Model 3 now serving as the primary sales drivers, and increasing competition from Chinese EV brands like BYD, NIO, and Huawei-backed AVATR (e.g., Aito M9,\u5c0a\u754cS800), Tesla's market position has eroded. In 2025, Tesla reported $94.827 billion in revenue (a 3% decline year-on-year) and $3.794 billion in net profit (a 46% drop), while its global EV production and deliveries reached 1.655 million and 1.636 million units, respectively\u2014both surpassed by BYD, which delivered 2.25 million pure-electric vehicles in 2025, marking the first time Tesla was overtaken in annual EV sales by a Chinese automaker. Tesla plans to redirect resources from Model S/X production to the development of the Optimus humanoid robot and the rollout of the Cybercab robotaxi, with the third-generation Optimus set for release in Q1 2026 and Robotaxi operations expanding in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2025, Tesla's Robotaxi fleet had driven over 2 million kilometers collectively. The company increased its operating expenses by 23% to $12.7 billion in 2025, with significant investments in autonomous driving and AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures are projected to rise from $8.53 billion in 2025 to over $20 billion in 2026, funding six new factories and AI computing upgrades. Additionally, Tesla committed $2 billion to Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup xAI. Musk described the shift as 'slightly regrettable' but essential for Tesla\u2019s transformation into an 'AI and robotics company,' where service revenue from Robotaxi and robotics could eventually surpass vehicle sales as the primary profit driver. The discontinuation of Model S and Model X is thus framed not as an end, but as a strategic pivot toward a future defined by artificial intelligence and automation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 11:07 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/t/2026-02-07/doc-inhkyvrf1198415.shtml)\n\n**Tesla Shanghai Factory Delivers 852,000 Vehicles in 2025, Accounting for Over Half of Global Deliveries**\nAccording to market data released on February 5, 2026, the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory delivered 851,732 domestically produced electric vehicles in 2025.

Model 3/Y deliveries totaled 1.5853 million units (down 7.0%), while Model S/X deliveries fell by over 40% to 50,900 units. As a result, automotive revenue declined 10% to $69.526 billion, total revenue dropped 3% to $94.827 billion (the first decline), and net profit (GAAP) fell 46% to $3.794 billion. In the earnings call, CEO Elon Musk announced the phased shutdown of Model S and Model X production, with the Fremont factory's S/X line repurposed for the production of Optimus humanoid robots, aiming for 1 million units annually. Tesla\u2019s strategy now emphasizes automation and software, with FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions reaching 1.1 million users by 2025, or 12% of total vehicle ownership. The company plans to launch the third-generation Optimus robot in Q1 2026, featuring a redesigned hand. Tesla is also advancing the Cybercab (a robotaxi without pedals or steering wheel) and the electric Semi for 2026 production. Cybercab is expected to operate 50\u201360 hours per week, compared to 10\u201311 for human-driven vehicles. Management believes these services could expand Tesla\u2019s market size 5\u201310 times.

In response, Tesla has intensified focus on lower-priced versions of the Model 3 and Model Y. Despite price cuts, the company reported a profit decline exceeding 60% in Q4 2025, indicating that revenue recovery remains elusive. Optimus has become the primary investment focus. The third-generation model, expected to be unveiled in Q1 2026, features improved hand design for greater precision in tasks. Musk previously described Optimus as 'the greatest product ever created' and claimed it could perform any task\u2014teaching, childcare, dog walking, lawn mowing, social interaction, or cocktail preparation. The robot is projected to be priced between $20,000 and $30,000, with initial sales expected by late 2027. This robotics push is tied to a $1 trillion executive compensation plan approved by Tesla\u2019s board in November, contingent on achieving long-term goals including a $8.5 trillion market valuation, selling 20 million vehicles, operating a million robotaxis, and selling a million humanoid robots. Analyst Seth Goldstein of Morningstar noted that Musk\u2019s full compensation package hinges on Tesla becoming a leader in both autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots across multiple countries.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[contrareplica.mx](https://www.contrareplica.mx/nota-Tesla-suspende-Model-S-y-Model-X-para-reorientar-su-negocio-hacia-robots-humanoides-20262252)\n\n**Global Electric Vehicle Sales in 2025: China and the U.S. Show Opposite Trends**\nIn 2025, global electric vehicle (EV) registrations increased by 20%, reaching 20.7 million units. China led with 12.9 million registrations, a 17% increase from 2024; Europe recorded 4.3 million (a 33% rise); and the rest of the world saw 1.7 million (a 48% increase). In contrast, EV sales in the United States grew by only 1%, with Tesla experiencing a 9% decline in vehicle deliveries and a 46% drop in net profit. Elon Musk announced a strategic shift toward artificial intelligence and robotics. The U.S. market saw EVs account for less than 10% of new car sales, while 39 countries exceeded 10% EV adoption\u2014Vietnam (38%), Thailand (21%), and Indonesia (15%). In 2025, President Donald Trump returned to office and pledged to end EV-supporting policies, reducing federal incentives. Meanwhile, Europe maintained a 90% CO\u2082 reduction target for vehicles by 2035, Germany offered subsidies of \u20ac1,500\u2013\u20ac6,000 for EVs, Brazil\u2019s MOVER program linked tax credits to domestic EV production, South Africa introduced a 150% tax deduction for EV and battery manufacturing, and Thailand provided production-linked subsidies and tax reductions. China, having matured its EV industry after a decade of state support, replaced full tax exemptions with a 5% reduced tax on EV purchases, as domestic saturation and intense competition prompted Chinese manufacturers to expand globally.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:59 PM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/vehiculos/articulo/cuantos-carros-electricos-se-vendieron-en-el-mundo-durante-2025-china-y-estados-unidos-dos-realidades-opuestas/202638/)\n\n**Tesla's High Capital Expenditure Drives AI-Driven Transformation in the Automotive Industry**\nTesla released its 2025 annual report on January 29, 2025, revealing a shift from a car sales-dependent model to an AI-driven technology platform.

Annual deliveries totaled 1.64 million, down 9%, with Model 3/Y deliveries at 1.59 million (down 7%). The company's energy storage deployment reached 46.7 GWh in 2025, up 48.7% year-on-year, with Q4 deployment at 14.2 GWh (up 13% quarter-on-quarter). The Shanghai Lingang factory produced ~26 GWh, accounting for 56% of total output, primarily exported to Australia, Europe, and Japan. Megapack 3 is scheduled for production in Houston in 2026, targeting 50 GWh annual capacity and a 20% increase in single-unit capacity. The Autobidder platform integrates AI-based price forecasting and trading, enabling participation in electricity markets and promoting asset financialization and customer stickiness. Powerwall global installations surpassed one million units. Tesla's market share in Australia's grid-scale storage reached 35%, securing a 1.2 GWh order for Phase III and a 0.5 GWh project in Japan\u2019s Miwakura Lake East Storage Facility, expected to be operational by 2027 and become one of Japan\u2019s largest. Tesla is building the only lithium and cathode refining plant in the U.S. and plans 100 GWh solar cell capacity to support AI data centers and the grid. In 2026, Tesla plans capital expenditures exceeding $20 billion, a 135% increase year-on-year, focused on AI compute infrastructure, chip R&D, robotaxis, robotics, and battery/factory construction (excluding solar and semiconductor wafer investments). In January 2026, Tesla invested $2 billion in xAI and signed a collaboration agreement to deepen AI research and data training, leveraging the Grok large model to enhance fleet management and model training efficiency. The company plans to develop its own AI5/AI6 chips: AI5 offers 8x the compute and 9x the memory of AI4, while AI6 aims for 2x AI5 performance, with a single chip reaching 5,000 TOPS. A planned in-house wafer fab will target initial capacity of 100,000 wafers/month, scaling to 1 million/month, approaching TSMC\u2019s global monthly output of 1.47 million. Tesla will also optimize its vehicle lineup: Model S/X are expected to be largely discontinued by Q2 2026, with the Fremont factory repurposed for 1 million Optimus robots annually. The first mass-production-ready Optimus Gen3 is planned for Q1 2026, with industrial production in 2026 and public sales in 2027. The next-generation Roadster may debut in April. Semi-truck production is planned for H1 2026. Full Self-Driving (FSD) software will transition from one-time purchase to subscription starting March 31, 2026: $199/month for general users, $99/month for enhanced package holders. As of 2025, Tesla had 1.1 million FSD subscribers, with ~70% still using one-time purchase. The subscription model lowers entry barriers and enhances long-term revenue predictability. FSD has accumulated 7 billion miles driven, strengthening its data moat. FSD is now live in South Korea and open for test drives in multiple European countries. Robotaxi operations are advancing: 500 vehicles are operating with paid passengers in the Bay Area and Austin, with safety drivers removed in Austin in January 2026, marking a key milestone. By H1 2026, operations are expected to expand to 9 cities, with coverage reaching 25%-50% of the U.S. by year-end. The driverless Cybercab, without steering wheels or pedals, will begin production in April.
