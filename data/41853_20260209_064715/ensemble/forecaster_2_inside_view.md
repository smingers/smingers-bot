Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Primary sources (high reliability, factual):**
- AP News (Nov 24, 2025): Pentagon announces investigation, explicitly cites recall authority. Factual baseline established 77 days ago.
- ABC News, NBC News, PBS (Feb 3-4, 2026): Federal court hearing before Judge Richard Leon. Judge expressed skepticism about Pentagon's legal authority, questioning lack of Supreme Court precedent. Kelly has been censured (Jan 5) but NOT recalled. These are contemporaneous, mainstream sources reporting court proceedings.
- Federal News Network (Jan 12, 2026): Pentagon escalated to "command investigation." Expert Todd Huntley (retired Navy captain/JAG) states likely outcome is non-punitive letter of censure, not court-martial. Named expert opinion from qualified source.

**Key factual findings:**
1. Kelly was censured on January 5, 2026 (not recalled)
2. Federal judge (Leon, Bush appointee) is skeptical of government's legal theory
3. No Supreme Court precedent exists for this action
4. Investigation has been ongoing for 77 days with no recall order
5. Kelly has 30 days to respond (from Jan 5), decision within 45 days
6. Judge aims to rule by Feb 11, 2026

**Expert opinions (identifiable):**
- Todd Huntley (retired Navy captain/JAG): Most likely outcome is administrative letter, not court-martial or recall
- Colby Vokey (military lawyer): Questions legal basis, suggests federal court would block
- Judge Richard Leon: Expressed this would be unprecedented, asked "Isn't that a bit of a stretch?"
- Multiple legal experts (Georgetown's Vladeck, Georgia State's Kreis): Courts-martial of sitting senator violates constitutional principles

**Opinion vs. fact separation:**
Political statements from Schumer, Kelly, Hegseth are opinions/rhetoric. Factual core: investigation exists, censure issued, no recall order issued, judge skeptical, no precedent exists.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence AGAINST recall:**
- Judge Leon's explicit skepticism and statement that government asks him to do "something the Supreme Court has never done" (multiple independent sources confirm same court hearing)
- 77 days elapsed since investigation announcement with no recall (historical pattern shows 7-42 day lag for all 5 documented recalls)
- Zero historical precedent for recall based on political speech (all 5 prior recalls involved violent/sexual felonies)
- Named expert (Huntley) predicts administrative action, not recall
- Structural factor: Constitutional separation of powers makes recalling sitting senator extraordinarily difficult

**Moderate evidence AGAINST recall:**
- Pentagon chose "command investigation" rather than NCIS criminal investigation (suggests administrative rather than criminal track)
- Kelly's continued public criticism shows no actual "chilling effect" (DOJ conceded this in court)
- Censure already issued as intermediate step; recall would require additional escalation

**Weak evidence FOR recall:**
- Hegseth's public statements threatening action (but rhetoric vs. actual orders)
- Trump's inflammatory social media posts (political pressure exists but doesn't translate to legal authority)

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**52 days remaining until April 1, 2026**

Current timeline:
- Investigation announced: Nov 24, 2025 (77 days ago)
- Censure issued: Jan 5, 2026 (35 days ago)
- Court hearing: Feb 3, 2026 (6 days ago)
- Judge ruling expected: Feb 11, 2026 (2 days from now)
- Kelly's response deadline: ~Feb 19, 2026 (30 days from censure)
- Pentagon decision deadline: ~Feb 19, 2026 (45 days from censure)

**If timeframe halved (26 days):** Probability would increase slightly to ~4-5% because compressed timeline might force rushed decision before full judicial review. However, judge's ruling (expected Feb 11) would likely block action.

**If timeframe doubled (104 days):** Probability would decrease to ~1-2% because extended time allows multiple appeal cycles, judicial injunctions, and political pressure to dissipate. Historical pattern shows action happens quickly or not at all.

**Critical path dependency:** Judge Leon's ruling (expected Feb 11) is pivotal. If he grants preliminary injunction, recall becomes legally impossible during appeal process. If he denies, Pentagon would have ~48 days to execute recall before April 1.

(d) Justification for shifts from outside view:

**Outside view base rate: 2.5%**

**Factors supporting LOWER probability (toward 1-2%):**

1. **Unprecedented legal territory with hostile judiciary:** Judge Leon's explicit statement that this would be unprecedented, combined with his skepticism, creates strong structural barrier. In all 5 historical recalls, legal authority was clear-cut (felonies). Here, First Amendment and Speech/Debate Clause create constitutional obstacles absent in reference class.

2. **Time decay beyond historical pattern:** At 77 days, we're already 2-3x longer than any documented investigation-to-recall lag. The modal pattern (recall within 21 days) has clearly failed. Each additional day without action reduces conditional probability.

3. **Intermediate step already taken:** Pentagon issued censure (Jan 5), which Hegseth called "a necessary process step." This suggests a graduated approach rather than immediate recall. Historical cases show no multi-step escalation—recalls happened directly.

4. **Expert consensus against recall:** Named experts (Huntley, Vokey) predict administrative outcomes, not recall. No identified expert predicts recall is likely.

**Factors supporting HIGHER probability (toward 3-4%):**

1. **Political pressure from Trump:** Unprecedented political environment where executive branch openly threatens legislators. Trump's "DEATH" rhetoric creates pressure for action beyond normal institutional constraints.

2. **Hegseth's public commitment:** Defense Secretary has staked reputation on this case. Backing down could appear weak, creating bureaucratic incentive to escalate.

3. **Small-sample uncertainty:** With only 5 historical recalls, we have high statistical uncertainty. A first-ever speech-based recall, while unprecedented, isn't impossible.

**Net adjustment:** The legal/constitutional barriers and time decay are structural factors that strongly override political pressure. Judge Leon's pending ruling (Feb 11) creates a near-term checkpoint that will likely block any recall attempt. The reference class (felony-based recalls) is sufficiently different that even the 2.5% base rate may be too high.

**Calibrated inside view: 1.5-2%**

The combination of:
- Hostile federal judge with ruling imminent
- 77 days elapsed (far beyond historical norm)
- Zero precedent for speech-based recall
- Constitutional obstacles (Speech/Debate Clause, First Amendment)
- Expert consensus against recall

...makes the reference class of "any retiree recall" less analogous than initially assessed. The political pressure is real but insufficient to overcome structural/legal barriers in the 52-day window.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate of 2.5%, I adjust downward based on:

1. **Judge Leon's imminent ruling (expected Feb 11):** If he grants preliminary injunction (likely based on his skepticism), recall becomes legally impossible during appeals. This alone reduces probability by ~1 percentage point. Even if he denies, his skepticism signals appellate courts would likely overturn.

2. **Time decay:** 77 days without action, when historical pattern shows 7-42 days, suggests institutional reluctance or legal obstacles have stalled process. Reduces probability by ~0.5 percentage points.

3. **Constitutional barriers absent from reference class:** All 5 historical recalls involved clear criminal conduct. Speech-based recall of sitting senator faces First Amendment and Speech/Debate Clause obstacles that make this fundamentally different. However, small possibility of unprecedented executive overreach prevents going below 1%.

**Final calibrated probability: 1.5%**

This reflects:
- ~98% chance status quo continues (no recall, case resolved through courts/administrative channels)
- ~1.5% chance of tail-risk scenario where Pentagon defies judicial skepticism and executes unprecedented recall despite constitutional obstacles
- Remaining uncertainty due to small historical sample and unprecedented political environment

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Sen. Mark Kelly be placed on Active Duty status before April 1, 2026 (52 days)? Resolution requires credible sources confirming active duty status.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 2.5% based on historical recall rates and time-frame analysis. My final 1.5% is rooted to this, adjusted downward for stronger-than-anticipated legal barriers and time decay.

3. **Consistency:** "1.5 out of 100 times, Kelly is recalled to active duty before April 1, 2026." This aligns with a tail-risk scenario where Pentagon defies judicial guidance and constitutional norms—rare but not impossible given current political environment.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Judge Leon stated government asks him to do "something Supreme Court has never done" (multiple sources, Feb 3-4, 2026)
   - 77 days elapsed since investigation with no recall order (vs. 7-42 day historical pattern)
   - Expert Todd Huntley predicts administrative letter, not court-martial (Jan 12, 2026)
   - Zero historical precedent for speech-based recall; all 5 prior cases involved violent/sexual felonies
   - Censure already issued Jan 5 as intermediate step; recall would require further escalation

5. **Blind-spot:** Judge Leon denies preliminary injunction on Feb 11, Pentagon immediately issues recall order before appeals can be filed, and executes it within days citing national security emergency. This could happen if: (a) judge surprisingly sides with government, (b) Pentagon acts with unprecedented speed, (c) appellate courts don't intervene quickly. This scenario would make my 1.5% look too low—might shift to 5-8% if these conditions materialized. However, judge's expressed skepticism makes (a) unlikely.

6. **Status quo:** Current trajectory is toward administrative resolution (censure + possible demotion of retired rank) rather than recall. Judge's ruling will likely formalize this status quo by blocking recall authority. Given 52-day window and institutional inertia, status quo (no recall) is overwhelmingly likely. My 1.5% already reflects strong status quo bias; further reduction would ignore tail risk of executive overreach.

Probability: 1.5%
