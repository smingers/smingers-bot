Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (what counts):
This resolves **Yes** if, **before April 1, 2026**, credible sources report Sen. Mark Kelly was **placed on Active Duty status** in the U.S. Armed Forces (not merely investigated/censured/demoted in retired rank).

(a) Source analysis (quality, recency, what’s factual vs opinion)
- **AP (Nov 24, 2025)** (high quality; dated but foundational): Fact—Pentagon publicly announced an investigation and cited recall authority for retirees. No fact-claim that recall occurred.
- **Federal News Network (Jan 12, 2026)** (good niche outlet; fairly recent): Fact—Pentagon escalated to a “command investigation,” ordered by SecDef Hegseth’s office; Kelly not directly notified. Expert opinion (named JAG Todd Huntley): likely heading toward administrative action (e.g., censure) rather than court-martial/recall.
- **PBS (Jan 5, 2026)** (high quality): Fact—Hegseth issued a **letter of censure**, described as a step toward possible demotion/reduced retirement pay; process timelines (30 days response; 45 days decision). No recall.
- **ABC7 (Jan 6, 2026)** (local affiliate; basically wires): Same key facts on censure and process. Contains expert commentary (Huntley, Vokey) skeptical of post-retirement speech punishment.
- **ABC News / WPLG (Feb 3, 2026)** (high quality / credible local partner; very recent): Fact—Judge Richard Leon expressed skepticism; expects to rule by ~Feb 11; litigation active. No recall.
- **ABC News (Feb 2026 variants) / The Hill / NBC News (Feb 3–4, 2026)** (high quality; very recent): Fact—closed-door hearing; judge pressing DOJ for precedent; judge telegraphing skepticism and potential “chilling effect.” NBC/Hill characterization “likely to rule in Kelly’s favor” is partly interpretive, but grounded in direct quotes.
- **NBC News (Feb 6, 2026) re: DOJ probe of other lawmakers** (high quality; recent): Fact—DOJ inquiry has widened in some form (voluntary interview requests, lawmakers refusing). Relevance: indicates escalation of political/legal conflict, but not directly recall-to-active-duty.
- **Newsweek opinion-ish framing + op-eds (e.g., Cleveland.com)** (mixed): Adds color on political climate; limited probative value for whether an actual recall order will be issued.
- **Independent / TMZ / Epoch Times items** (mixed to low relevance): Not informative for recall mechanics.

Bottom line from sources: as of **Feb 9, 2026**, the factual record is **censure + investigation + active litigation**, but **no reporting** that Kelly has been recalled to active duty.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (large impact)
- **Structural/legal friction + lack of precedent for recalling a sitting Senator** (multiple credible legal-expert reports; reinforced by judge’s skepticism). This strongly suppresses recall likelihood.
- **Judicial posture and imminent injunction decision (by ~Feb 11)**: Multiple credible outlets quote Judge Leon challenging DOJ for precedent and warning of chilling effects. A preliminary injunction would be a major barrier to recall within the window.
- **Observed revealed preference by Pentagon: censure/demotion track rather than recall**. After ~11 weeks from investigation announcement, the chosen tool has been administrative (censure → potential retirement grade/pay action), not activation.

Moderate evidence (moderate impact)
- **Command investigation escalation** (FNN): suggests DoD is still pushing forward, raising tail-risk of stronger steps (including recall) if they choose maximal confrontation.
- **Broader DOJ inquiry into other lawmakers** (NBC/AP): indicates willingness to escalate against political opponents; raises the “willingness” parameter, though recall is still uniquely explosive.

Weak evidence (small impact)
- **Rhetoric (Trump “sedition/punishable by death”)**: signals intent/temperature, but rhetoric often outruns feasible bureaucratic/legal action.
- **Commentary/op-eds/tabloids**: low signal for an actual Active Duty recall order.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- From **today (Feb 9, 2026)** to **Apr 1, 2026** is **51 days**.
- If the timeframe were **halved (~25 days)**: probability drops meaningfully because (i) injunction ruling and any appeal/stay mechanics compress, and (ii) DoD historically recalls quickly when it does—yet here they’ve already waited months.
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~102 days)**: probability rises somewhat because even with injunctions/appeals, there’s more time for an appellate stay/merits maneuver plus bureaucratic execution.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from the 3.2% outside view)
Starting from the outside-view base rate **3.2%**, I adjust based on two opposing forces:

Downward pressure vs outside view:
- **Time-elapsed without recall**: We are far beyond the 1–6 week “rapid recall” pattern seen in the small modern reference set (serious felony cases). Here: ~11+ weeks and still only censure + retirement-grade threats. This is strong “dog not barking” evidence against recall.
- **High likelihood of near-term judicial constraint**: Judge Leon is openly skeptical and intends to rule imminently; an injunction would sharply reduce the chance of recall before Apr 1.

Upward pressure vs outside view:
- **Political willingness to escalate appears real** (command investigation escalation; widening DOJ probe; aggressive rhetoric). This keeps the probability from collapsing toward ~0%.

Net effect: modest decrease from 3.2% to the high-2% range. The key is that recall-to-active-duty is not the “natural next step” in the currently visible administrative path; it would be a deliberate escalation into maximal constitutional conflict, and the court timeline is likely to block/deter it within 51 days.

Probability calibration
- Status quo / momentum if nothing big changes: continued litigation + administrative retirement-grade/pay process, **no active-duty recall**.
- Scenario thinking (rough):
  - **Injunction granted Feb 11** (my best guess more likely than not): recall becomes extremely unlikely before Apr 1.
  - **Injunction denied**: still not automatic recall; DoD can pursue demotion/pay reduction without activation; recall would be a further, riskier escalation.
  - **Pre-injunction “rush recall”**: possible but would be extraordinary and invite immediate emergency relief.

Inside-view probability (final): **2.7%**

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Will Sen. Mark Kelly be **placed on U.S. military Active Duty** at any time **before Apr 1, 2026**?
2) Outside view base rate: **3.2%**
3) Consistency check: **About 3 out of 100 times**, Kelly is recalled to **active duty** before Apr 1, 2026.
4) Key evidence:
   - Pentagon has pursued **censure/demotion track**, not recall, for ~11+ weeks.
   - **Judge Leon skepticism** and imminent ruling likely constraining DoD actions.
   - **No meaningful precedent** for recalling a sitting Senator over political speech.
5) Blind spot: Administration obtains an emergency appellate stay (or ignores norms) and issues a recall order as a political shock move; this would push probability up (maybe to ~8–12%).
6) Status quo outcome: legal fight + administrative penalties, **no recall**; nudge toward No is warranted.

Probability: 2.7%
