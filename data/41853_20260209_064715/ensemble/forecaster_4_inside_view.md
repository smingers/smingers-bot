Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Federal News Network (12 Jan 2026) – Pentagon escalates to a “command investigation”; no recall yet.  High-quality, straight reporting.  
2. ABC/WPLG & ABC News (3 Feb 2026) – Hearing before Judge Richard Leon; judge openly skeptical of DoD authority; ruling expected 11 Feb.  High-quality national outlets; direct courtroom quotes = factual.  
3. NBC News, Arkansas Advocate, The Hill, Newsweek (3-4 Feb 2026) – Parallel accounts of the same hearing; all confirm censure/demotion track, no active-duty orders.  Reliable mainstream; mostly fact, minimal opinion.  
4. AP, PBS, ABC7 (5-6 Jan 2026) – Hegseth issues letter of censure; outlines 45-day demotion process.  Top-tier sources; purely factual on sequence of DoD actions.  
5. AP (24 Nov 2025) – Investigation announced; DoD cites statutory recall power.  Baseline factual trigger.  
6. Commentary pieces (Cleveland op-ed, FIRE analysis, etc.) – Opinion/advocacy; treated only as context, not as evidence for or against recall probability.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence AGAINST recall (large downward shift)  
• Multiple independent, reliable sources describe DoD pursuing only administrative remedies (censure, grade reduction), not recall.  
• Federal judge, GOP-appointed, signals likely injunction; court decision due 11 Feb, well before 1 Apr cut-off.  Structural separation-of-powers friction very high.  

Moderate evidence FOR recall (small upward shift)  
• DoD’s public statement (Nov 2025) explicitly referenced recall authority.  
• Partisan environment: President Trump and SecDef Hegseth have shown readiness to test norms.  

Weak evidence  
• Historical retiree recalls occur quickly once decided (1-6 weeks) – but those cases involved serious felonies, not speech.  
• Media speculation that Kelly is a 2028 contender – only tangential.

Net weighting: strong anti-recall evidence dominates; moderate pro-recall keeps probability above zero; weak factors negligible.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
51 days remain until 1 Apr 2026.  Logistically sufficient if DoD acted this week, but court ruling (≈11 Feb) will either enjoin or greatly slow any attempt.  Halving timeframe to 25 days would further lower probability by ≈40 %; doubling to 102 days (past resolution date) not applicable.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate (retiree investigated with recall floated): 4.2 %.  
Adjustments:  
-1.0 %  Judge likely to grant injunction (strong evidence)  
-0.5 %  Administrative track already chosen (strong evidence)  
-0.3 %  Separation-of-powers & political blow-back (strong)  
+0.6 %  Trump/Hegseth willingness to escalate despite courts (moderate)  
Final inside-view ≈3 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 3 times in 100 similar situations Senator Kelly would actually be placed on active-duty orders by 1 Apr 2026.”

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase – “Will Sen. Mark Kelly be placed on US active-duty status before 1 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated: 4.2 %.  
3. Consistency check: 3/100 cases recall happens – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Judge Leon’s skepticism & imminent ruling.  
   b) DoD limited to censure/demotion process so far.  
   c) Historical recall use limited to serious crimes.  
   d) Political cost of recalling a sitting senator.  
5. Blind-spot: White House orders recall as political theater same day judge rules, daring courts to block; probability could jump to 20 %.  
6. Status quo = no recall; short time window favors status quo.

Probability: 3%
