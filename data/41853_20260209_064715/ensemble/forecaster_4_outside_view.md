Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. AP News 24 Nov 2025 – Straight-news wire piece announcing that the Pentagon had opened an investigation into Sen. Kelly and explicitly cited the statutory power to recall retirees.  Factual content: investigation opened; recall a legal option.  Opinion: quotes from political figures; we discount them.  High reliability, dated 10 ½ weeks ago.  

2. AP News 20 Nov 2025 – Describes the lawmakers’ video and President Trump’s response.  Mostly political rhetoric; factual value is that the video exists.  High reliability, but offers no evidence that any recall has actually begun.  

3. ABC News, NBC News, Military.com, Newsweek (31 Jan – 4 Feb 2026) – All report the same federal-court hearing.  Factual overlap: Kelly has been formally censured, is suing, and the judge is skeptical of Pentagon authority.  None report any recall orders.  Quality: mainstream outlets, contemporaneous.  Opinions limited to quoted statements by judge and lawyers (identifiable experts).  

4. FIRE commentary 9 Jan 2026 – Advocacy organization piece arguing the Pentagon lacks authority.  Provides statutory cites, but heavy editorial framing; treat legal explanations as arguable, not settled fact.  

5. CBS News 24 Nov 2025 – Similar to AP 24 Nov; confirms that recall was listed only as a possible outcome.  Reliable.  

6. Agent report – Synthesises publicly documented retiree recalls for court-martial since 2000 (5 cases).  Gives dates, statutes, and lags of 1–6 weeks from investigation announcement to recall.  We cross-checked two cases (Grazioplene, Larrabee) and confirm accuracy.  While compiled by an LLM, each item is traceable to public court opinions; adequate for base-rate purposes.

(b)  Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes:  
1. All U.S. military retirees (millions) who might ever be recalled.  Too broad; base rate is ~zero but provides no discriminating power.  
2. Retirees for whom the Pentagon has publicly announced an investigation with recall “on the table”.  Data scarce—probably a few dozen, but not systematically recorded.  
3. Retirees who actually were recalled for court-martial since 2000.  We have five solid cases (Agent report).  Suitability: gives an empirical conversion rate from “investigation opened” to “recall executed”, but the numerator equals the denominator in the available data, exaggerating recall likelihood.  
4. High-profile elected officials who are military retirees.  Population size ~5–10; zero have ever been recalled.  Provides a stronger “outside” perspective on political factors.

I adopt a blended reference class: “publicly known investigations of military retirees that led—or didn’t lead—to recall within 60 days.”  We have: 5 recalls (Agent report) / 5 or so known investigations (essentially 100 % conversion) when felony misconduct was alleged.  However, for purely speech-related allegations the count of recalls is 0/≥ 1.  So for speech the base rate is effectively 0 %.  Taking the union of both categories lowers the base rate well below 1 %.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  

• Days remaining until deadline: 52.  
• Historical lag from announcement to recall (in the 5 documented cases): 7–42 days, median ≈ 21 days.  
• Kelly’s investigation has already been public for 77 days with no recall.  Conditional on a recall happening, the window is now almost twice as long as any documented lag, suggesting the hazard rate is dropping fast.

(d)  Justification  

1. Empirical rarity: 5 recalls in 26 years ≈ 0.19 recalls/year across >2 million retirees → annual per-retiree probability ~1 × 10⁻⁷.  
2. Novelty of offence: every prior recall involved serious violent/sexual felonies, never political speech.  A first-ever use of recall power for speech would require breaking new legal ground, which federal Judge Leon is already signalling he is unlikely to sanction.  
3. Time decay: The modal pattern is “investigate → recall within a month.”  Passing the 11-week mark without action sharply decreases further odds.  
4. Institutional incentives: recalling a sitting U.S. senator would invite constitutional confrontation; Pentagon already appears on the defensive in court.  
5. Expert signals: the presiding judge’s scepticism and lack of supportive precedent lowers the plausibility that DoD would press ahead in the next 52 days.

Outside view calibration:

• Raw base rate for any retiree recall in a 52-day window = (0.19 / yr) × (52/365) ≈ 2.7 %.  
• Restrict to speech-only cases: 0 %.  
• Add upward adjustment for high political salience (could override norms) +1 %.  
• Subtract for elapsed time already exceeding historical window –1 %.  
• Subtract for adverse judicial climate –0.5 %.  
Resulting calibrated outside-view probability ≈ 2 %.

Because the historical record shows occasional surprises and small-sample error, I inflate slightly for uncertainty, ending with 2.5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
2.5 %
