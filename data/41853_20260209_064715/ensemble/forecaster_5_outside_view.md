Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
AP 20 Nov 2025 & 24 Nov 2025 – Straight-news wire reports; high factual density, minimal opinion.  Establish that (1) the Pentagon opened an investigation and (2) recall authority was explicitly mentioned.  
CBS 24 Nov 2025 – Same facts as AP with minor added quotation; quality comparable.  
ABC News, NBC News, Military.com, Newsweek 4 Feb 2026 – Straight court-reporting from a federal hearing; judge’s sceptical comments are factual quotes, legal analysis labelled as such.  No recall orders reported.  
FIRE 9 Jan 2026 – Advocacy piece; factual description of statutes is reliable but normative language is opinion.  
Agent report (Feb 2026) – Compiled, source-cited list of every known retiree recall for court-martial since 2000.  Data are verifiable through published appellate opinions and press releases.  Good quality, although a handful-case sample is necessarily thin.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All U.S. military retirees recalled for court-martial (Agent report: 5 cases in 26 years ≈ 0.19 per year).  
2. Retired officers above O-4 recalled for non-violent, speech-related misconduct (zero known cases).  
3. Sitting Members of Congress ever recalled (zero cases).  

Class 1 is the only one with any positive count and is therefore the least worst baseline.  It almost certainly over-states the chance here because every documented recall involved serious sexual-assault felonies, not political speech.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Time remaining until deadline: 52 days ≈ 7 weeks.  
• In the five documented recalls, the lag from public announcement of an investigation to issuance of recall orders was 1-6 weeks (median ≈ 3 weeks).  
• In Kelly’s case we are already 11 weeks past the Pentagon’s formal censure and 10 ½ weeks past its “recall possible” warning with no activation.  Base-rate evidence therefore gets “aged-out” rapidly.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate (class 1): 0.19 recalls/year ÷ ~2 million retirees ≈ 1 × 10⁻⁷ per retiree-year.  Converting this to an unconditional probability that any given retiree is recalled in a 4-month window is essentially zero (≈ 0.003%).  

However, Kelly is not a random retiree: he is (a) already under investigation, (b) a nationally prominent critic of the administration, and (c) within statutory jurisdiction.  Those factors raise the chance by several orders of magnitude relative to the raw population base rate.  A more meaningful outside view is: “Of retirees formally warned that recall is being considered, how many are actually recalled within three months?”  In the very small empirical set (5/5), the answer is 100%.  That would push a naive probability to ~100% – but this is clearly an artefact of case mix (all were violent-crime cases).  Adjusting for mismatch of alleged offence type (speech vs felony violence) and unprecedented status (sitting senator) I down-weight by roughly an order of magnitude.

Putting those adjustments together:

• Start with “investigation-under-way” base ≈ 100% recall in violent-crime cases.  
• Divide by 10 for non-violent, speech-only misconduct. → 10%  
• Divide by 2 for unprecedented constitutional complications of recalling a sitting senator. → 5%  
• Divide by 2 again because we are already outside the historical 1-6-week recall window and only 7 weeks remain. → 2.5%

Outside view calibration:

1. No expert or market source offers a contrary quantified estimate; we therefore rely on structural reasoning above.  
2. Upset rate: The U.S. military justice system occasionally surprises observers (e.g., Grazioplene recall after 30-year-old allegations), but outright constitutional firsts are rare.  I therefore retain a non-trivial tail (≈ 2-3%).  
3. Round off carefully (not to nearest 5%).  A 2–3 % probability represents 33–50 : 1 odds—still enough to respect low-frequency surprises while acknowledging how extraordinary a recall of a sitting senator would be.

Outside View Prediction:
