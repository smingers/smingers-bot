You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who urged troops to defy "illegal" orders, be recalled to active duty in the US military before April 1, 2026?

Question background:
AP (November 24, 2025): [Pentagon says it’s investigating Sen. Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy ‘illegal orders’](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-mark-kelly-troop-investigation-4882f76b05dcdfa3060c284c2c84dd12)

> The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law after the former Navy pilot joined a handful of other lawmakers [in a video](https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2) that called for troops to defy “illegal orders.”

> The Pentagon’s statement, posted on social media, cited a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.

> It is extraordinary for the Pentagon, which until President Donald Trump’s second term had usually gone out of its way to act and appear apolitical, to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation. It comes after Trump ramped up the rhetoric by accusing the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days after the video was released last week.

# Summary of AP News Article: "Pentagon says it's investigating Sen. Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy 'illegal orders'"

**Date:** November 24, 2025

## Key Facts and Developments:

**The Investigation:**
- The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law
- Kelly, a former Navy pilot who retired at the rank of captain, appeared in a video with other lawmakers urging troops to defy "illegal orders"
- The Pentagon cited federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures
- The Pentagon statement suggested Kelly's statements "interfered with the 'loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces'"
- The statement said: "A thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures"

**Why Kelly Specifically:**
- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kelly is facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon's jurisdiction
- Hegseth stated: "Kelly's conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately"

**The Video:**
- Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers (all with military or intelligence backgrounds) who appeared in the video
- Other lawmakers: Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan
- In the video, Kelly told troops "you can refuse illegal orders," while others said troops needed to "stand up for our laws... our Constitution"
- The lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video

**Political Context:**
- The article describes it as "extraordinary" for the Pentagon to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation
- Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition "punishable by DEATH" in a social media post days after the video was released
- The video's release comes as the Trump administration has ordered the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continues attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities

**Responses:**

*Kelly's Response:*
- Dismissed the Pentagon investigation as the work of "bullies"
- Said: "If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work"

*Other Democratic Senators:*
- Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of using the Pentagon "as his personal attack dog" and said "this is what dictators do"
- Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) said "Mark told the truth — in America, we swear an oath to the Constitution, not wannabe kings"

**Expert Legal Analysis:**

*Stephen Vladeck (Georgetown University law professor):*
- Said there has been "a quiet but significant uptick in courts-martial of retired servicemembers, even for post-retirement offenses" in the past decade
- Noted there has been debate in courts about their constitutionality but the practice is currently allowed

*Anthony Michael Kreis (Georgia State University constitutional law professor):*
- Said Kelly's status as a U.S. senator could complicate the Pentagon's investigation
- Stated: "Having a United States senator subject to discipline at the behest of the secretary of defense and the president — that violates a core principle of legislative independence"
- Explained the Constitution explicitly shields members of Congress from White House overreach as a reaction to British monarchy's arbitrary punishment of Parliament members
- Said: "Any way you cut it, the Constitution is fundamentally structurally designed to prevent this kind of abuse from happening"

**Additional Context:**
- Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said last week: "our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders"
- The article notes troops do have specific obligations to reject unlawful orders, though rank-and-file troops rarely have access to military lawyers for consultation
- A former service member who helps run an online military forum (speaking anonymously) said the lawmakers' message is unlikely to reach troops because the video was only posted on X and was too long for platforms like TikTok where troops actually consume information

# Summary of AP News Article: "Trump says Democrats' message to military is 'seditious behavior' punishable by death"

**Date:** November 20, 2025

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **The Video**: Six Democratic lawmakers (all veterans of armed services/intelligence community) released a 90-second video on Tuesday, November 19, 2025, calling on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy "illegal orders."
   - Lawmakers featured: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan), **Sen. Mark Kelly (Arizona)**, Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan
   - Video stated the Trump administration "is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens"
   - Concluded with War of 1812 phrase: "Don't give up the ship"

2. **Trump's Response** (Thursday, November 21, 2025):
   - Accused the lawmakers of "SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!"
   - Posted "SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH"
   - Called for their arrest and trial: "LOCK THEM UP???"
   - Reposted comment stating "HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!!"

3. **Context**: The video's release coincides with Trump administration attempts to deploy National Guard troops into U.S. cities, though some deployments have been pulled back or held up in court.

## Official Statements:

- **White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt**: Suggested the Democrats' message "perhaps is punishable by law" and that incitement to "defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders" is "very dangerous" and lawmakers "should be held accountable"
- **Speaker Mike Johnson**: Said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence, stating Trump was "defining a crime" and called the Democrats' video "wildly inappropriate"
- **Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell**: "Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders. We love the Constitution. These politicians are out of their minds."
- **Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth**: Called the video "Stage 4 TDS" (Trump Derangement Syndrome) on Tuesday

## Legal Context:

- Troops have an obligation to reject unlawful orders
- The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) can punish troops for failing to follow orders if they turn out to be lawful (Article 90 and Article 92)
- The "Nuremberg defense" (just following orders) doesn't absolve troops of responsibility

## Political Reactions:

- **Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer**: Warned Trump was "lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline"
- **White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller** (Wednesday on Fox News): Called the messaging "insurrection — plainly, directly, without question"
- **The Steady State** (network of 300+ national/homeland security experts): Stated the lawmakers' call was "only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine."

# Summary of Article: "Judge seems skeptical of legal justification for Pentagon's punishment of Sen. Mark Kelly"

**Source:** ABC News

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Court Hearing Details:**
   - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon held a hearing on Tuesday regarding Sen. Mark Kelly's case
   - Kelly's attorneys are seeking to block the Pentagon from punishing him
   - Judge Leon did not immediately rule from the bench but indicated he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday
   - Leon was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush

2. **Judge's Skepticism:**
   - Judge Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's legal justification, stating: "You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done. Isn't that a bit of a stretch?"
   - The judge noted the Pentagon's actions could have a chilling effect on "many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion"
   - Leon said he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator

3. **Legal Arguments:**
   - **Government's position (Justice Department attorney John Bailey):** Retired military service members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops, stating "Retirees are part of the armed forces. They are not separated from the services."
   - **Kelly's position (attorney Benjamin Mizer):** They aren't aware of any ruling supporting the notion that military retirees have "diminished speech rights" and that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case

4. **Current Status of Punishment:**
   - Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth censured Kelly on January 5
   - The censure was described as "a necessary process step" to proceedings that could result in demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay

5. **Background Context:**
   - Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared in a November video urging troops to uphold the Constitution and not follow unlawful military directives
   - Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition "punishable by DEATH" in a social media post
   - Kelly is the only one of the six lawmakers being investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under Pentagon jurisdiction

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

The article does not indicate that Kelly has been recalled to active duty. The current action is a censure, which is described as a preliminary step that could lead to other punishments (demotion, reduction in retirement pay). The legal proceedings are ongoing, with a ruling expected by the following Wednesday.

# Summary of NBC News Article (February 04, 2026)

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Legal Proceedings:**
- A federal judge (U.S. District Judge Richard Leon) held a hearing on Tuesday regarding Sen. Mark Kelly's lawsuit against the Trump administration
- Judge Leon appears likely to rule in favor of Kelly based on his comments during the hearing
- Leon stated: "Lots and lots of novel issues in the case. Not sure we've ever seen a case like this."
- The judge will rule by February 11, 2026

**Actions Taken Against Kelly:**
- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced in early January that the Defense Department was taking steps to downgrade Kelly's military retirement rank and pay
- Hegseth issued a formal letter of censure in early January, accusing Kelly of:
  - "Reckless conduct"
  - "Directly attacked the legitimacy of military leadership and the lawfulness of their orders"
  - Statements that "directly prejudice good order and discipline"
  - "Engaged in conduct that seriously compromises your standing as an officer and brings dishonor to the officer corps"

**Kelly's Legal Arguments:**
- Kelly's lawsuit argues Hegseth's actions violate his First Amendment rights
- The lawsuit also cites the speech and debate clause of the Constitution, which grants immunity to lawmakers for official acts
- Kelly's attorney (Benjamin Mizer) argued that Hegseth's decisions would affect not just Kelly but any retired member of the U.S. military

**Judge's Observations:**
- Judge Leon noted there are restrictions on speech for active military members, but Kelly is no longer on active duty
- Justice Department attorney John Bailey argued restrictions should extend to retired members but could not cite relevant law, regulation, or case law to support this position
- Leon responded: "You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit has never done"

**Kelly's Status:**
- Kelly is the only lawmaker in the video who retired from the military (the other five are veterans and former intelligence officials)
- His retired status means he can be recalled for urgent needs (war, national emergency) or to face court-martial for misconduct

**Quotes:**
- Kelly (outside courthouse): "There's nothing more fundamental to our democracy than the freedom of speech and the freedom to speak out about our government, and that's what I'm fighting for."
- Kelly also stated: "Secretary Hegseth censured me and is now trying to demote me for things that I said and for doing my job as a United States senator."

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

**Important Note:** This article discusses efforts to reduce Kelly's retirement rank and a formal censure, but does **not** mention any actual recall to active duty status as of the February 4, 2026 date of the article.

- "Any other approach would be to make new law"

**Background on the Video:**

# Summary of "Can the Pentagon strip Mark Kelly's rank over speech?"

**Source:** The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression  
**Date:** January 9, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Pentagon Actions:** The Pentagon announced "de-ranking procedures" against Sen. Mark Kelly for participating in a video stating that military personnel "can disobey illegal orders."

2. **Kelly's Response:** Kelly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop these procedures.

3. **Other Members Investigated:** Five other members of Congress who participated in the video (Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan, Maggie Goodlander, and Sen. Elissa Slotkin) are being probed by the Justice Department. None of them served long enough to face deranking.

4. **Legal Basis for Pentagon Action:** Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the Pentagon is moving to dock Kelly's captain rank and retirement pension under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), which governs the rank of retired officers. Hegseth called the video "reckless and seditious" and accused Kelly of "reckless misconduct."

5. **Potential Charges:** Hegseth argues Kelly violated UCMJ Articles 133 (conduct unbecoming an officer) and 134 (service discrediting speech).

## Legal Context Provided:

- **The Law Kelly Stated:** Page 402 of the Manual for Courts-Martial establishes that servicemembers can refuse "patently illegal orders." The military's 2024 Operational Law Handbook (page 86) expressly states troops should learn the duty to refuse "manifestly" illegal orders.

- **Military Retiree Status:** Kelly served 25 years in the Navy and remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice under 10 U.S.C. § 802(a)(4).

- **Article 133 Standards:** Requires conduct "more serious than slight" and "of a material and pronounced character." When speech is involved, it must pose a "clear and present danger" of dishonoring the officer. The government hasn't brought an Article 133 case against a retiree since 1958.

- **Article 134 Standards:** Prohibits "service discrediting" speech that could "prejudice good order and discipline." Case law (United States v. Wilcox, 2008) established a nexus test requiring "a reasonably direct and palpable connection between the speech and the military mission or military environment."

## Opinion from Source:

The article (from a free speech advocacy organization) argues that Kelly "merely stated the law" and that "simply stating the law is protected under the Constitution." It questions how accurately stating the law creates a "clear and present danger" and notes the high bar for proving conduct unbecoming an officer, especially for retirees whose speech poses no immediate risk to military order and discipline.

**Note:** This article is from an advocacy organization (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression) focused on free speech rights, which may influence its framing of the legal issues.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a list of U.S. military retirees who were recalled to active duty for court-martial since 2000 and how long each recall took from investigation announcement to activation; include statutory authority and rank.
Below is the best‐supported roster, drawn from the open sources provided, of U.S. military retirees who have actually been ordered back to active duty for purposes of court-martial since 1 January 2000.  Each entry lists

• Name, Service, Retired rank  
• Offense set alleged (for context)  
• Statutory basis for recall / jurisdiction  
• Date the public (or command) announcement of an investigation became available  
• Date the retiree’s orders to active duty for court-martial were reported or otherwise became effective  
• Measured delay from announcement to activation (rounded to the nearest week)

1. Maj. Gen. James J. Grazioplene, U.S. Army (Ret.)  
   • Alleged child rape (1983-1989).  
   • Authority: 10 U.S.C. § 802 (a)(4) (UCMJ jurisdiction over regular-component retirees) and recall power under 10 U.S.C. § 688.  
   • Investigation publicly disclosed: 25 August 2017 (Army statement that charges were preferred and an Article-32 hearing would follow). (Jordan Military Defense Attorney, 29 Aug 2017)  
   • Recall orders: same week—Article-32 preliminary hearing convened “over the weekend” of 26-27 Aug 2017 with Grazioplene returned to active duty status to appear. (Jordan Military Defense Attorney, 29 Aug 2017)  
   • Lag: ≈ 1 week from announcement to activation.

2. CPO Stephen T. Begani, U.S. Navy (Ret.)  
   • Alleged attempted sexual assault of a minor (conduct occurred one month after retirement in 2017).  
   • Authority: UCMJ art. 2 (a)(4) & (6) (Fleet Reserve retirees) and 10 U.S.C. § 688. (Military.com, 17 Mar 2021)  
   • Investigation/charge announcement: 24 Aug 2017 (NCIS arrest; Navy press release reported in local Japanese media, referenced in later appellate filings).  
   • Recall: 9 Sept 2017 (date arraignment docketed; accused placed on active-duty orders per charge sheet).  
   • Lag: ≈ 2 weeks.

3. SSgt Steven L. Larrabee, USMC (Ret.) – Fleet Marine Corps Reserve  
   • Alleged sexual assault and recording of the act (offense took place three months after retirement in 2015).  
   • Authority: UCMJ art. 2 (a)(6) & 10 U.S.C. § 688. (Federalist Society, 4 Feb 2021)  
   • Investigation announcement: 12 Nov 2015 (NCIS referral to convening authority – date appears in trial record cited in Larrabee v. Braithwaite).  
   • Recall: 14 Dec 2015 (convening authority ordered Larrabee to active duty for Article-32).  
   • Lag: ≈ 4 weeks.

4. GySgt Kevin Dinger, USMC (Ret.)  
   • Alleged possession of child sexual-abuse images and sexual assault of a minor, part of broader trend cases of 2015-2016.  
   • Authority: UCMJ art. 2 (a)(4) & § 688 (because Dinger retired from regular component with pay). (Federalist Society summary of United States v. Dinger, 4 Feb 2021)  
   • Investigation announced: 10 May 2016 (charge sheet referenced in NMCCA opinion).  
   • Recall orders executed: 2 Jun 2016 (arraignment).  
   • Lag: ≈ 3 weeks.

5. SFC David Morser, U.S. Army (Ret.) – medically retired on the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL)  
   • Alleged sexual assault under Article 120 committed before retirement; prosecution tested whether PDRL retirees remain subject to court-martial.  
   • Authority: UCMJ art. 2 (a)(4) & 10 U.S.C. § 688. (NIMJ “Retirees-Update” blog)  
   • Investigation announcement: 3 Feb 2019 (CID press release referenced in ACCA opinion, United States v. Morser).  
   • Recall: 20 Mar 2019 (date Morser reported to Fort Bragg on active-duty orders for Article-32).  
   • Lag: ≈ 6 weeks.

Summary of empirical pattern  
• All recalls invoked two complementary statutes: Article 2, UCMJ (jurisdiction) and 10 U.S.C. § 688 (service-secretary authority to order regular retirees to active duty).  
• The measured time between a publicly identifiable “investigation announced” milestone and the retiree’s activation ranged from one to about six weeks in the five documented cases.  The driver appears to be how quickly charges were drafted and an Article-32 hearing could be convened after investigators believed they had probable cause.  
• Ranks recalled since 2000 run from E-6 (GySgt) up to O-8 (Maj Gen).  No flag officer retiree above O-8 has yet been ordered back since 2000.  
• All known cases involved serious felony-level allegations (rape, child sexual assault, or comparable crimes) rather than purely military disciplinary offenses.

Information gaps  
The open-source record leaves several items either approximate or unknown:  
1. Exact dates of the orders to active duty (sometimes only the Article-32 proceeding date is public).  
2. Whether any lesser-known retiree recalls at the E-4 to E-5 level occurred but were not covered by national media; service dockets are not centrally searchable.  
3. Whether Maj. Gen. Grazioplene’s August 2017 hearing followed an earlier, unpublicized investigative start—if so, the lag measured above understates total investigation length but meets the question’s definition (announcement-to-activation).  
4. Outcomes: convictions, dismissals, or administrative dispositions, while not requested, would give fuller context.

To close those gaps additional document searches in service trial-judiciary portals (e.g., Army Trial Docket, Navy OJAG Court-Martial Docket) or FOIA requests for the exact recall orders would be required.  Further Google/Google News queries worded “order to active duty for court-martial” plus each surname may surface local-paper reporting that supplies the missing order dates.

Because the principal publicly reported retiree recalls are captured above, the analysis is substantially complete for the time period requested; only granular order-date confirmation remains outstanding.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
