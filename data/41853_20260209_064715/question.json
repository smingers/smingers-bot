Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy \u2018illegal orders\u2019](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-mark-kelly-troop-investigation-4882f76b05dcdfa3060c284c2c84dd12)\n\n> The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law after the former Navy pilot joined a handful of other lawmakers [in a video](https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2) that called for troops to defy \u201cillegal orders.\u201d\n\n> The Pentagon\u2019s statement, posted on social media, cited a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.\n\n> It is extraordinary for the Pentagon, which until President Donald Trump\u2019s second term had usually gone out of its way to act and appear apolitical, to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation. It comes after Trump ramped up the rhetoric by accusing the lawmakers of sedition \u201cpunishable by DEATH\u201d in a social media post days after the video was released last week.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40862,\"question_id\":40520}}`",
