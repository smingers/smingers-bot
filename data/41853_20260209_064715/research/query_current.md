Analysis:
The key signal for this forecast is any credible report that the Department of Defense has actually ordered retired Navy Capt. Mark Kelly back onto Active Duty. That would likely be announced through: 1) an official Pentagon/DoD press release or spokesperson comment; 2) coverage by major national‐security reporters (e.g., AP, Reuters, Politico, Military Times); 3) filings in federal court or the Congressional Record. Recent news (late-2025) covered the opening of the investigation, but we now need February 2026 updates on whether the investigation has escalated to a formal recall. Therefore, the most relevant articles will mention phrases like “recalled to active duty,” “court-martial,” “Uniform Code of Military Justice,” or “Pentagon orders.” Searches should combine Mark Kelly’s name with those recall/legal terms and restrict to the 2026 time frame.
