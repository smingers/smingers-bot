The forecasting question is:
Will Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who urged troops to defy "illegal" orders, be recalled to active duty in the US military before April 1, 2026?

Question background:
AP (November 24, 2025): [Pentagon says it’s investigating Sen. Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy ‘illegal orders’](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-mark-kelly-troop-investigation-4882f76b05dcdfa3060c284c2c84dd12)

> The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law after the former Navy pilot joined a handful of other lawmakers [in a video](https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2) that called for troops to defy “illegal orders.”

> The Pentagon’s statement, posted on social media, cited a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.

> It is extraordinary for the Pentagon, which until President Donald Trump’s second term had usually gone out of its way to act and appear apolitical, to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation. It comes after Trump ramped up the rhetoric by accusing the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days after the video was released last week.
