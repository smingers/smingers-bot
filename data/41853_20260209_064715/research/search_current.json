Mark Kelly to an official \"command investigation\" over \"serious allegations of misconduct\" (confirmed late Monday by Pentagon)\n- Command investigations are common tools for examining wrongdoing that doesn't rise to criminal charges, but are \"far less common\" for retired service members and especially sitting members of Congress\n- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office ordered the escalation\n- Kelly was not directly notified of the investigation by the Defense Department\n\n**Kelly's Response:**\n- Kelly stated the investigation is \"just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees \u2014 do not speak out against this president or there will be consequences\"\n- His lawyers sent a letter to the Pentagon stating \"there is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding\" and that \"any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power\"\n- Kelly said \"they picked the wrong guy\" and vowed not to be silenced\n\n**Pentagon's Position:**\n- Hegseth argued Kelly is the only lawmaker from the video who formally retired from the military and remains under Pentagon jurisdiction\n- Claims \"Kelly's conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces\"\n- Reiterated it could recall Kelly to active duty for court-martial proceedings\n- Cited federal law prohibiting interference with \"loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces\"\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Todd Huntley (retired Navy captain and judge advocate general):**\n- Believes if Pentagon officials truly thought Kelly's actions could lead to court-martial, the inquiry would have been handed to Naval Criminal Investigative Service\n- States: \"It's a realization that they are not going to be able to court-martial him and that is what this is setting up is some sort of administrative action\"\n- Suggests most likely outcome is a non-punitive letter of censure, which would have \"almost no actual impact\" since Kelly is no longer in active service\n\n## General Expert Opinion (Unnamed):\n- Legal experts have said Kelly did nothing illegal\n- Legal experts say the Pentagon is misreading military law\n- Legal experts say Kelly could not be prosecuted by the executive branch as a member of Congress\n\n## Context:\n- The investigation follows Trump's accusation that the six Democratic lawmakers committed sedition \"punishable by DEATH\"\n- The original video was released in November 2025 and featured six Democratic lawmakers with military/intelligence backgrounds\n- The remarks came amid controversy over military strikes on alleged drug boats in Latin America and Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to American cities\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judge-skeptical-legal-justification-pentagons-punishment-sen-mark-129831353\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Judge seems skeptical of legal justification for Pentagon's punishment of Sen.

Isn't that a bit of a stretch?\"\n   - The judge noted the Pentagon's actions could have a chilling effect on \"many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion\"\n   - Leon said he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator\n\n3. **Legal Arguments:**\n   - **Government's position (Justice Department attorney John Bailey):** Retired military service members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops, stating \"Retirees are part of the armed forces. They are not separated from the services.\"\n   - **Kelly's position (attorney Benjamin Mizer):** They aren't aware of any ruling supporting the notion that military retirees have \"diminished speech rights\" and that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case\n\n4. **Current Status of Punishment:**\n   - Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth censured Kelly on January 5\n   - The censure was described as \"a necessary process step\" to proceedings that could result in demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay\n\n5. **Background Context:**\n   - Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared in a November video urging troops to uphold the Constitution and not follow unlawful military directives\n   - Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition \"punishable by DEATH\" in a social media post\n   - Kelly is the only one of the six lawmakers being investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon's jurisdiction\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThe article does not indicate that Kelly has been recalled to active duty.

John Fetterman warned on February 8, 2026, during an appearance on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' that a partial government shutdown was likely by February 13, 2026, due to stalled negotiations over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Fetterman stated that Democrats are demanding 10 reforms to DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in exchange for their support, including restrictions on ICE raids, bans on enforcement near schools and other 'sensitive' locations, and official standards against racial profiling. While Republicans have rejected some demands\u2014such as requiring ICE officers to remove their masks\u2014some have signaled openness to others. Fetterman acknowledged Democrats would not achieve all 10 demands, and admitted he did not know his party\u2019s 'red lines' on funding. He also noted his own support for deporting immigrants with criminal backgrounds and his past willingness to support government funding without conditions, contrasting with more progressive Democrats who have pushed for stronger accountability, such as calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s resignation. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., criticized DHS leadership, saying the agency is run by people 'who have no idea what they're doing and don't seem to give a s**t about the constitutional rights of the American people.' Senate Republicans, led by John Thune, suggested that repeated two-week continuing resolutions (CRs) may be necessary, with Thune stating, 'I just think it's going to be really, really hard to get anything done.' A funding bill for DHS is separate from broader spending legislation, meaning only DHS and its agencies would be affected if the deadline passes without action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 11:23 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html)\n\n**Senator Says Savannah Guthrie Called Him Before Calling Police About Missing Mother**\nSen.

Mark Warner on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Feb. 8, 2026**\nSenator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's involvement in a January 28, 2026 FBI search of Fulton County, Georgia, related to 2020 election records. Warner stated that Gabbard's presence was inappropriate because there was no foreign nexus\u2014she is only authorized to act on foreign intelligence matters. He expressed concern that President Donald Trump may have requested her presence, though the president denied this, creating conflicting accounts. Warner revealed that Congress was not informed of Gabbard\u2019s prior involvement in seizing voting machines in Puerto Rico, which was first reported by the press. He criticized the dismantling of key election security agencies under the current administration, including CISA, the FBI\u2019s foreign influence center, and the ODNI\u2019s Foreign Malign Influence Center. Warner also raised alarms about a whistleblower complaint against Gabbard, which he said was not timely disclosed to Congress, despite a prior Inspector General finding it credible. He questioned the integrity of the process, noting the complaint was only shared with the committee in February 2026, months after it was filed. Warner accused Gabbard of incompetence and violating protocol, especially regarding whistleblower disclosures. He further warned that Trump\u2019s rhetoric about nationalizing elections and taking control of 15 states poses a threat to election integrity and could lead to ICE patrols at polling stations, deterring voter participation\u2014particularly among immigrant communities. Warner emphasized that the full intelligence behind the whistleblower\u2019s complaint remains under review, and he is seeking access to both redacted and unredacted materials. He also addressed Iran\u2019s nuclear program, stating that while U.S. strikes damaged but did not destroy Iranian capabilities, the U.S. lacked full military and diplomatic leverage due to the President\u2019s global distractions, including a naval blockade off Venezuela and tensions with NATO over Greenland. Warner affirmed his support for ongoing diplomacy with Iran.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 05:04 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-warner-virginia-demoract-face-the-nation-transcript-02-08-2026/)\n\n**The oath still matters -- our veteran leaders are right to defend it: Scott W. Patton**\nScott W. Patton, a veteran of the U.S. Army's 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and the 5th and 19th Special Forces Groups, and a member of a Gold Star family, argues that the military oath to 'support and defend the Constitution' remains vital. He emphasizes that this oath binds all service members, general officers, and elected leaders who once wore the nation's uniform. Patton condemns reports that Defense Department officials were pressured to investigate U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, a combat veteran, calling such actions unlawful orders under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He asserts that military leadership must serve as a backstop to democracy, not a tool for political retaliation. He draws a parallel to unlawful tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where federal agents are deployed for political retribution rather than impartial law enforcement. Patton stresses that fidelity to the Constitution\u2014regardless of political pressure\u2014is not defiance but duty. He warns that politicizing institutions like the military and ICE undermines national security, weakens deterrence abroad, and threatens the integrity of American democracy. He calls on Americans to support veteran leaders who uphold the oath even when politically risky, especially as the midterm elections approach. For Patton, the oath is sacred\u2014not to a president, party, or grievance, but to the Constitution itself. He reminds readers that Arlington National Cemetery belongs to the fallen, not to present-day politics.

The request, originally submitted by President Claudia Sheinbaum, remains unresolved after failing to be approved during the December session and no extraordinary session being held in January. Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas and former chair of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs (2023\u20132025), raised the matter during a meeting with Mexican legislators at San L\u00e1zaro, emphasizing respect for Mexico\u2019s sovereignty while underscoring the importance of maintaining long-standing joint military training exercises. McCaul affirmed that the U.S. respects Mexico\u2019s decision but believes continued naval capacity-building cooperation is vital.

They urged Taiwan's political parties to cooperate across party lines with goodwill to ensure adequate funding for self-defense. The statement cited China's December 2025 military exercise simulating a blockade of Taiwan as a clear reminder of Beijing's intentions and the threat to a free and open Indo-Pacific. It emphasized that Taiwan's political leaders must focus on approving critical defense funding and strengthening societal resilience, rather than seeking photo opportunities with China. The statement called on Taipei's party leaders to swiftly pass investments vital to Taiwan's security and its partnership with the United States. According to Politico, Senators Santorum, Coons, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Jack Reed believe the budget deadlock could undermine American public support for aiding Taiwan against potential Chinese aggression. The U.S. State Department told Politico it had 'clearly conveyed to Taiwan that we welcome Taiwan\u2019s announcement of a $40 billion defense special budget.' Democratic Senator Joe Garcia added that if Americans believe Taiwan\u2019s people are not doing enough to prepare for a life-or-death scenario, it will be harder to justify U.S. intervention, especially in a region many Americans do not understand, have never visited, or feel willing to sacrifice national interests for.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 04:31 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/10930/9315987)\n\n**Former Hostage Nimrod Cohen Says He Wants to Rejoin the Army**\nNimrod Cohen, an Israeli former hostage held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 738 days from October 7, 2023, to October 13, 2025, has expressed his desire to return to active service in the Israel Defense Forces (Tsahal). Speaking on N12 on February 7, 2026, Cohen stated that a structured military environment would best support his recovery, emphasizing that he feels more at ease within a military framework where personnel understand his trauma and can tailor roles to his needs\u2014whether sedentary or physically active. He had been kidnapped during a Hamas attack on the Nahal Oz base, where his tank crew was killed, and was one of 251 hostages taken. After his release, he visited the Hostages Square in Tel Aviv to thank soldiers, civilians, and U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in securing his return. Cohen also honored the three crew members who died: Oz Daniel, Omer Neutra, and Shaked Dahan. He recalled being told in captivity that Israel had abandoned them, but upon returning, he was moved by the thousands who gathered to welcome the freed hostages, proving the claims false. He said he does not feel he completed his military service, having served only 10 months before capture, and believes active participation and routine are essential to healing. He noted that even leisure travel has limits, as he felt the need to return home after two trips.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 03:39 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel FR](https://fr.timesofisrael.com/lex-otage-nimrod-cohen-dit-vouloir-reintegrer-larmee/)\n\n**Democrats involved in 'illegal orders' video say they won't cooperate with DOJ probe**\nSen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) have refused to cooperate with a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into a 90-second video they participated in, which urged members of the military and intelligence community to refuse illegal orders. Slotkin stated in a post that she sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro informing them she would not comply with inquiries or submit to an interview, accusing the Trump administration of using 'physical and legal intimidation' to silence dissent. She emphasized that the intimidation is intended to deter others from speaking out and vowed not to be silenced. Houlahan echoed this stance, stating she would not comply with the DOJ\u2019s request for a voluntary interview, calling the government\u2019s actions a 'crossing of a line' when federal power is used to intimidate citizens. The video, produced by six members of Congress\u2014four of whom have military or intelligence backgrounds\u2014sparked backlash from former President Donald Trump, who labeled their actions 'seditious' and suggested they could be 'punishable by death.' Trump later claimed he was not threatening death but said the lawmakers were 'in serious trouble.' The FBI reportedly contacted the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms seeking interviews with the lawmakers, which Reps. Jason Crow and Maggie Goodlander said indicated the FBI was being used to intimidate Congress. Crow stated Trump called for his arrest, prosecution, and execution, while Goodlander said the threats were 'dangerous' and would not deter her. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attempted to censure and demote Sen.

The DOJ investigation stems from concerns that the video could incite insubordination, with former President Donald Trump publicly accusing the lawmakers of sedition. Slotkin's legal team has formally declined the voluntary interview, requested document preservation for anticipated litigation, and urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to terminate the inquiry. Slotkin denies inciting disobedience, framing the video as a civics lesson on the duty to refuse unlawful commands. She alleges the DOJ is using 'physical and legal intimidation' to silence her and deter others from criticizing the administration. She also argues that Supreme Court rulings expanding presidential immunity do not protect DOJ officials enforcing the president\u2019s directives. The DOJ has not yet issued subpoenas, but Slotkin acknowledged she would 'take a hard look' at compliance if one were issued. The controversy has intensified amid threats to her family and property, with Slotkin warning that the investigation sets a dangerous precedent for political dissent. The Pentagon has separately investigated Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), another video participant, who has sued over disciplinary actions. Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and three-term House member, has positioned her defiance as a strategic 'offense' to force the administration to confront its choices, stating, 'I did this to go on offense.' The standoff now rests with federal prosecutors deciding whether to escalate the investigation into members of Congress.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:06 PM\nSource:[The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/dem-senator-thumbs-her-nose-at-doj-rejects-call-to-answer-for-illegal-orders-video)\n\n**Slotkin rejects Justice Department request for interview on Democrats' video about 'illegal orders'**\nDemocratic Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan has refused to voluntarily comply with a Justice Department request for an interview regarding a 90-second video she helped produce with five other Democratic lawmakers urging U.S. military members to resist 'illegal orders.' The video, released in November 2025, called on service members to uphold military protocols and reject unlawful commands, accusing the Trump administration of pitting the military against American citizens. The video sparked backlash from Republicans, with President Donald Trump labeling it sedition and stating it could be 'punishable by death.' The Pentagon initiated an investigation into Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot featured in the video, and the FBI contacted the lawmakers for interviews, signaling a broader Justice Department inquiry. Slotkin\u2019s legal team, led by Preet Bharara, declined the interview request in letters to U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and Attorney General Pam Bondi, demanding the investigation be terminated and requesting preservation of documents for anticipated litigation. Slotkin stated she is taking a proactive stance, saying, 'I did this to go on offense,' and emphasized that the threats against her and her family\u2014including a bomb threat to her farm, police protection for her brother, and a swatting of her parents\u2014prompted her to fight back. She acknowledged the possibility of a subpoena but stated she would 'take a hard look' at it. Kelly has already sued the Pentagon over disciplinary actions, and a federal judge recently questioned the legal basis for censuring him. Slotkin, like Kelly, has gained national attention, with both being mentioned as potential 2028 presidential contenders. Slotkin previously represented a competitive House district and won her Senate seat in 2024 despite Trump winning Michigan. She has been a vocal critic of Trump, urging Democrats to reclaim their 'alpha energy' and confront him aggressively. Her actions reflect a broader Democratic strategy of resistance, with her saying, 'If I\u2019m encouraging other people to take risk, how can I not then accept risk myself?'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 01:15 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/slotkin-illegal-orders-video-justice-department-interview-06b6c041b158b2ed5911c52a16868764)\n\n**Judge presses DOJ lawyers for precedent for Pentagon to punish Kelly over video - NewsBreak**\nU.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon presided over a closed-door hearing in a case involving Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and former astronaut, who is seeking a preliminary injunction against the Pentagon\u2019s threat to demote him and reduce his military retirement benefits. The action stems from a video Kelly made with other Democratic lawmakers who served in the military or national security, urging military personnel not to follow illegal orders. Judge Leon challenged the Justice Department\u2019s legal team, questioning whether the government has precedent for such punitive action, stating, 'You\u2019re asking me to do something the Supreme Court or the DC Circuit has never done.' The case centers on First Amendment rights of military veterans and the separation of powers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused Kelly of violating a federal law against undermining military discipline, claiming he used his senatorial position as a shield while leveraging his military status as a weapon. The Justice Department argued that Kelly, as a retired officer, does not have the same free speech rights as civilians and has not exhausted administrative remedies. Kelly, who has 20 years of active-duty service and still receives Defense Department benefits, called the move political retribution, warning it sends a 'chilling message' to retired service members. The video, released in January 2026, referenced unspecified illegal orders during a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that killed at least 126 suspected drug smugglers\u2014raising legal concerns over the use of lethal force instead of prosecution. The case has drawn national attention as a pivotal test of constitutional rights, with Kelly asserting that 'the Constitution is on our side.' Judge Leon aims to rule on the injunction request by February 11, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 05:42 AM\nSource:[newsbreak.com](https://www.newsbreak.com/abc-news-510079/4475548010575-judge-presses-doj-lawyers-for-precedent-for-pentagon-to-punish-kelly-over-video)\n\n**Pentagon's Plan to Downgrade Democratic Senator Mark Kelly Sparks Legal Battle and Constitutional Debate**\nDemocratic Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and former astronaut, is challenging the Pentagon's threat to downgrade his military rank and reduce his retirement benefits after he participated in a video with five other Democratic lawmakers\u2014also veterans or intelligence officials\u2014urging U.S. military personnel to refuse illegal orders. The video, released in November 2025, called for the military to uphold the Constitution and reject unlawful commands, sparking outrage from President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who labeled the remarks as treasonous and threatened prosecution. On February 4, 2026, a closed-door federal court hearing was held before Judge Richard J. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who questioned the government's legal team: 'Is there a legal precedent for this punishment?' The judge emphasized that the government was asking him to do something never before done by the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit Court. He stated he would rule on Kelly\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction by February 11, 2026. The case has drawn national attention as a major test of First Amendment rights for veterans and the principle of separation of powers. Kelly argued that his service in uniform was to defend the Constitution, not to obey unlawful orders, and accused the administration of political retaliation. The Justice Department contended that retired military officers do not have the same First Amendment protections as civilians and that Kelly had not exhausted administrative remedies. Legal experts have questioned the proportionality of military actions in the Caribbean and Pacific, where U.S. forces sank vessels suspected of drug trafficking, resulting in at least 126 deaths, and argued that such actions should be prosecuted through federal courts rather than military force. The case underscores a broader conflict between military authority, civilian oversight, and constitutional rights.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:03 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260204004216-260408)\n\n**First Amendment free speech rights debated in Sen. Mark Kelly\u2019s illegal orders case**\nArizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is involved in a federal lawsuit against the Department of Defense, challenging the Pentagon's attempt to demote his retired Navy captain rank following a video in which he and other lawmakers told military members they are not obligated to follow illegal orders. Senior Judge Richard J. Leon of the District of Columbia District Court, nominated by President George W. Bush, presided over a one-hour hearing on February 3, 2026, and stated he expects to issue a ruling before February 11. Kelly\u2019s legal team, led by Benjamin Mizer, argued that the Department of Defense\u2019s actions constitute a 'clear First Amendment violation,' emphasizing that the cited precedents involve active-duty service members, not retirees, and that the federal court has jurisdiction over constitutional claims. Mizer also accused Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of bias and lack of impartiality. Justice Department attorney John Bailey defended the Pentagon, asserting a 'military clause' to the First Amendment and claiming Kelly should have pursued internal administrative remedies. Judge Leon questioned the expansion of active-duty rulings to retirees, calling it a 'stretch,' and noted that the case may have a 'chilling effect' on other military retirees who may refrain from criticizing the Defense Department. Bailey conceded there may be 'a few unique First Amendment aspects' but argued that Kelly\u2019s continued criticism indicates no actual 'chill' in his speech. Judge Leon concluded the hearing by stating he would decide on a preliminary injunction in the 'very near future' to allow for appeal. Kelly emphasized that the case is not just about his rights but those of 'millions of retired service members,' asserting that free speech is fundamental to democracy. He condemned Hegseth\u2019s censure and demotion attempt as retaliation for fulfilling his duties as a U.S. senator and criticized the Trump administration for targeting First Amendment rights broadly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:30 AM\nSource:[Arkansas Advocate](https://arkansasadvocate.com/2026/02/03/repub/first-amendment-free-speech-rights-debated-in-sen-mark-kellys-illegal-orders-case/)\n\n**Judge appears likely to rule in Sen. Mark Kelly's favor in suit over 'illegal orders' video**\nA federal judge, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, appears likely to rule in favor of Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in his lawsuit against the Trump administration over efforts to downgrade his military retirement rank and pay. The lawsuit stems from Kelly\u2019s 2023 video message, co-released with other retired military officials serving in Congress, urging troops not to follow illegal orders\u2014an act the Defense Department labeled 'sedition.' Kelly argues the administration\u2019s actions violate his First Amendment rights and the Constitution\u2019s speech and debate clause, which protects lawmakers from punitive actions for official speech. During a February 4, 2026 hearing, Leon emphasized the novelty of the case, questioning the government\u2019s lack of legal precedent to justify restricting retired military members\u2019 speech, particularly when they are no longer on active duty. Justice Department attorney John Bailey failed to cite any law or case supporting such restrictions. Leon noted the absence of precedent, quoting Bob Dylan: 'You don't need a weatherman to decide which way the wind blows.' Kelly\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Mizer, warned the ruling would set a dangerous precedent affecting all retired military personnel. The lawsuit claims the administration\u2019s response\u2014using terms like 'treason' and 'sedition'\u2014constituted punitive retribution and denied due process. Kelly stated he is defending 'the freedom of speech and the freedom to speak out about our government,' calling the attack part of a broader pattern of targeting First Amendment rights. Judge Leon has set a ruling date of February 11, 2026, and the lawsuit seeks a court order declaring Hegseth\u2019s actions unlawful. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a formal letter of censure in January 2026, accusing Kelly of undermining military leadership and discipline. Kelly condemned the censure as politically motivated and part of a larger effort to suppress dissent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:08 AM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/judge-appears-likely-rule-mark-kelly-favor-illegal-orders-video-lawsui-rcna257333)\n\n**Judge seems skeptical of Pentagon's bid to punish Mark Kelly over 'illegal orders' video**\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush, expressed skepticism toward the Pentagon's attempt to censure Senator Mark Kelly and reduce his retirement rank following a November 2025 video in which Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers\u2014Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Reps. Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.), Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.), and Jason Crow (Colo.)\u2014urged military service members to refuse unlawful orders. Kelly, a former Navy captain and Arizona Democrat, sued to block the effort led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Judge Leon questioned the government's argument that First Amendment protections for active-duty personnel should extend to retirees like Kelly, stating, 'It's never been done before.' Kelly\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Mizer, warned the Pentagon\u2019s proposed rule would set a precedent affecting all retired service members, noting there is 'no support in precedent and no support in history' for such a punishment. The Justice Department argued Kelly must exhaust the Pentagon\u2019s internal process before filing suit, with lawyer John Bailey asserting that retirees remain accountable to military authority and that judicial intervention could undermine military control. Leon indicated he may rule on Kelly\u2019s request to block the Pentagon\u2019s action by February 11, 2026, despite a prior delay due to winter weather, with Kelly required to respond to the Pentagon\u2019s inquiry by February 16. Kelly told reporters the case is about more than his rights: 'There's nothing more fundamental to our democracy than the freedom of speech.' He praised the judge\u2019s 'quick and careful consideration' given 'what is at stake,' emphasizing that 'a lot is at stake.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:49 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5721614-kelly-lawsuit-challenges-pentagon-censure/)\n\n**GOP\u2011appointed judge warns of \"chilling effect\" in Mark Kelly censure case**\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon, a Republican-appointed judge under George W. Bush, questioned the Pentagon's legal authority to censure Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and Democrat from Arizona, for participating in a 90-second video urging military personnel to resist unlawful orders from the Trump administration. The Pentagon launched an investigation in late November, citing a federal statute allowing retired service members to be recalled for disciplinary action, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally censured Kelly on January 5, stating it was a 'necessary process step' toward potential penalties including rank reduction and loss of retirement pay. Justice Department attorney John Bailey argued that retirees remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, asserting they are 'not separated from the services.' Judge Leon pushed back, stating the government was asking the court to act in a way unsupported by any Supreme Court precedent, calling it 'a bit of a stretch.' Kelly\u2019s attorneys, including Benjamin Mizer, argued that retired service members retain full First Amendment protections, especially when speaking in a political capacity, and that no legal precedent supports limiting their free speech rights. Leon warned that disciplining Kelly could create a 'chilling effect' on other military retirees who wish to voice political opinions. The video, posted in November, featured Kelly and five other veteran lawmakers\u2014Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan\u2014urging service members to uphold the Constitution. Days after its release, Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition in a social media post, calling their actions 'punishable by DEATH.'

His attorneys will request a federal judge to halt the proceedings on Tuesday at 4:00 PM ET in Washington, D.C. The case is being heard by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee who previously blocked a Trump executive order, calling it an 'enormous' act of retaliation. Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers featured in a November video reminding service members of their legal duty to reject unlawful commands. In the video, he stated: 'Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.' His remarks came amid growing Democratic criticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to deploy the National Guard in U.S. cities and authorize lethal attacks on vessels suspected of drug smuggling from Latin America. Trump labeled the video as 'TREASONOUS BEHAVIOR that can be punished by death' in a social media post. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused Kelly of intentionally undermining military order and discipline, claiming his actions violated regulations applicable to both active and retired personnel. The Trump administration has urged Judge Leon to dismiss the case, arguing it is a matter of military discipline beyond judicial jurisdiction and that the lawsuit is premature, as Kelly has not yet been formally reprimanded and should first respond administratively.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:07 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-senator-kelly-will-richter-bitten-trumps-vergeltungskampagne-zu-stoppen-ce7e5bd3db8cf622)\n\n**Pentagon says it's investigating Sen. Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy 'illegal orders'**\nThe Pentagon announced on November 24, 2025, that it is investigating Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona over a video in which he urged military personnel to refuse 'illegal orders,' citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty for potential court-martial. Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, was one of six military veterans\u2014 including Senators Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, and Representatives Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan\u2014who appeared in the video calling on troops to uphold the Constitution. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Kelly\u2019s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and that his formal retirement leaves him under Pentagon jurisdiction, unlike the others. The Pentagon claimed the video interfered with 'loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline' of the military. Kelly dismissed the investigation as intimidation by 'bullies' and affirmed his constitutional oath. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused President Trump of weaponizing the Pentagon, calling it 'what dictators do.' Legal experts, including Georgetown\u2019s Stephen Vladeck and Georgia State\u2019s Anthony Michael Kreis, noted that while courts-martial of retired personnel are legally permissible, subjecting a sitting U.S. senator to such action violates constitutional principles of legislative independence. The video, posted only on X and too long for platforms like TikTok, reportedly had minimal reach among active-duty troops. The context includes Trump\u2019s recent orders to destroy drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean and attempts to deploy National Guard units in U.S. cities despite legal challenges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 11:49 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-mark-kelly-troop-investigation-4882f76b05dcdfa3060c284c2c84dd12)\n\n**Democrat Mark Kelly investigated by Pentagon after urging troops to defy 'illegal orders'**\nThe Pentagon announced on November 24, 2025, that it is investigating Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law after he participated in a video urging U.S. troops to refuse 'illegal orders.' The investigation stems from a federal law allowing the defense secretary to recall retired service members to active duty for court-martial or administrative action. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and captain who retired from the military, is the only one of six participating lawmakers formally retired and thus still under Pentagon jurisdiction. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated Kelly's conduct 'brings discredit upon the armed forces' and criticized the group's video as sowing 'doubt and confusion' that endangers military personnel. Kelly rejected the investigation as intimidation, asserting he upheld his oath to the Constitution. The video, which featured other military veterans including Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan, called on troops to 'stand up for our laws... our Constitution.' The timing coincides with the Trump administration's controversial orders to destroy drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean and Pacific and efforts to deploy National Guard troops in U.S. cities despite legal challenges. While military law permits refusal of unlawful orders, especially for commanders with legal counsel, rank-and-file troops often lack such support. The 'Nuremberg defence'\u2014justifying actions by claiming obedience to orders\u2014has limited legal standing. Despite the video's wide media exposure, there has been little visible reaction from active-duty troops, with one former service member noting the content was posted only on X and too long for platforms like TikTok, where troops typically consume information.

The Pentagon stated the review could lead to Kelly being recalled to active duty for potential court-martial or administrative action, emphasizing the process would follow military law with due process and impartiality. President Donald Trump previously accused the group of 'traitors' and 'seditious behavior.' Kelly responded on social media, asserting he had 'given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies' and declaring that intimidation would not deter Congress from holding the administration accountable.
