Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy 'illegal orders'\"\n\n**Date:** November 24, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**The Investigation:**\n- The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law\n- Kelly, a former Navy pilot who retired at the rank of captain, appeared in a video with other lawmakers urging troops to defy \"illegal orders\"\n- The Pentagon cited federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures\n- The Pentagon statement suggested Kelly's statements \"interfered with the 'loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces'\"\n- The statement said: \"A thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures\"\n\n**Why Kelly Specifically:**\n- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kelly is facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon's jurisdiction\n- Hegseth stated: \"Kelly's conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\"\n\n**The Video:**\n- Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers (all with military or intelligence backgrounds) who appeared in the video\n- Other lawmakers: Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan\n- In the video, Kelly told troops \"you can refuse illegal orders,\" while others said troops needed to \"stand up for our laws... our Constitution\"\n- The lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video\n\n**Political Context:**\n- The article describes it as \"extraordinary\" for the Pentagon to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation\n- Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition \"punishable by DEATH\" in a social media post days after the video was released\n- The video's release comes as the Trump administration has ordered the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continues attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities\n\n**Responses:**\n\n*Kelly's Response:*\n- Dismissed the Pentagon investigation as the work of \"bullies\"\n- Said: \"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work\"\n\n*Other Democratic Senators:*\n- Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of using the Pentagon \"as his personal attack dog\" and said \"this is what dictators do\"\n- Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) said \"Mark told the truth \u2014 in America, we swear an oath to the Constitution, not wannabe kings\"\n\n**Expert Legal Analysis:**\n\n*Stephen Vladeck (Georgetown University law professor):*\n- Said there has been \"a quiet but significant uptick in courts-martial of retired servicemembers, even for post-retirement offenses\" in the past decade\n- Noted there has been debate in courts about their constitutionality but the practice is currently allowed\n\n*Anthony Michael Kreis (Georgia State University constitutional law professor):*\n- Said Kelly's status as a U.S. senator could complicate the Pentagon's investigation\n- Stated: \"Having a United States senator subject to discipline at the behest of the secretary of defense and the president \u2014 that violates a core principle of legislative independence\"\n- Explained the Constitution explicitly shields members of Congress from White House overreach as a reaction to British monarchy's arbitrary punishment of Parliament members\n- Said: \"Any way you cut it, the Constitution is fundamentally structurally designed to prevent this kind of abuse from happening\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said last week: \"our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders\"\n- The article notes troops do have specific obligations to reject unlawful orders, though rank-and-file troops rarely have access to military lawyers for consultation\n- A former service member who helps run an online military forum (speaking anonymously) said the lawmakers' message is unlikely to reach troops because the video was only posted on X and was too long for platforms like TikTok where troops actually consume information\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2\">\n# Summary of AP News Article: \"Trump says Democrats' message to military is 'seditious behavior' punishable by death\"\n\n**Date:** November 20, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **The Video**: Six Democratic lawmakers (all veterans of armed services/intelligence community) released a 90-second video on Tuesday, November 19, 2025, calling on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy \"illegal orders.\"\n   - Lawmakers featured: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan), **Sen. Mark Kelly (Arizona)**, Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan\n   - Video stated the Trump administration \"is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens\"\n   - Concluded with War of 1812 phrase: \"Don't give up the ship\"\n\n2. **Trump's Response** (Thursday, November 21, 2025):\n   - Accused the lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!\"\n   - Posted \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH\"\n   - Called for their arrest and trial: \"LOCK THEM UP???\"\n   - Reposted comment stating \"HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!!\"\n\n3. **Context**: The video's release coincides with Trump administration attempts to deploy National Guard troops into U.S. cities, though some deployments have been pulled back or held up in court.\n\n## Official Statements:\n\n- **White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt**: Suggested the Democrats' message \"perhaps is punishable by law\" and that incitement to \"defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders\" is \"very dangerous\" and lawmakers \"should be held accountable\"\n- **Speaker Mike Johnson**: Said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence, stating Trump was \"defining a crime\" and called the Democrats' video \"wildly inappropriate\"\n- **Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell**: \"Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders.

This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.\"\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judge-skeptical-legal-justification-pentagons-punishment-sen-mark-129831353\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Judge seems skeptical of legal justification for Pentagon's punishment of Sen. Mark Kelly\"\n\n**Source:** ABC News\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Court Hearing Details:**\n   - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon held a hearing on Tuesday regarding Sen. Mark Kelly's case\n   - Kelly's attorneys are seeking to block the Pentagon from punishing him\n   - Judge Leon did not immediately rule from the bench but indicated he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday\n   - Leon was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush\n\n2. **Judge's Skepticism:**\n   - Judge Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's legal justification, stating: \"You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done. Isn't that a bit of a stretch?\"\n   - The judge noted the Pentagon's actions could have a chilling effect on \"many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion\"\n   - Leon said he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator\n\n3. **Legal Arguments:**\n   - **Government's position (Justice Department attorney John Bailey):** Retired military service members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops, stating \"Retirees are part of the armed forces. They are not separated from the services.\"\n   - **Kelly's position (attorney Benjamin Mizer):** They aren't aware of any ruling supporting the notion that military retirees have \"diminished speech rights\" and that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case\n\n4. **Current Status of Punishment:**\n   - Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth censured Kelly on January 5\n   - The censure was described as \"a necessary process step\" to proceedings that could result in demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay\n\n5. **Background Context:**\n   - Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared in a November video urging troops to uphold the Constitution and not follow unlawful military directives\n   - Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition \"punishable by DEATH\" in a social media post\n   - Kelly is the only one of the six lawmakers being investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under Pentagon jurisdiction\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThe article does not indicate that Kelly has been recalled to active duty. The current action is a censure, which is described as a preliminary step that could lead to other punishments (demotion, reduction in retirement pay). The legal proceedings are ongoing, with a ruling expected by the following Wednesday.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/judge-appears-likely-rule-mark-kelly-favor-illegal-orders-video-lawsui-rcna257333\">\n# Summary of NBC News Article (February 04, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Legal Proceedings:**\n- A federal judge (U.S. District Judge Richard Leon) held a hearing on Tuesday regarding Sen.

Circuit has never done\"\n\n**Kelly's Status:**\n- Kelly is the only lawmaker in the video who retired from the military (the other five are veterans and former intelligence officials)\n- His retired status means he can be recalled for urgent needs (war, national emergency) or to face court-martial for misconduct\n\n**Quotes:**\n- Kelly (outside courthouse): \"There's nothing more fundamental to our democracy than the freedom of speech and the freedom to speak out about our government, and that's what I'm fighting for.\"\n- Kelly also stated: \"Secretary Hegseth censured me and is now trying to demote me for things that I said and for doing my job as a United States senator.\"\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\n**Important Note:** This article discusses efforts to reduce Kelly's retirement rank and a formal censure, but does **not** mention any actual recall to active duty status as of the February 4, 2026 date of the article.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.newsweek.com/gop-appointed-judge-warns-mark-kelly-pentagon-hegseth-censure-11461922\">\n# Summary of Newsweek Article on Mark Kelly Censure Case\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Court Hearing Details:**\n- U.S. District Judge Richard Leon (appointed by Republican President George W.

Isn't that a bit of a stretch?\"\n\n**Pentagon Actions Taken:**\n- Pentagon launched investigation into Kelly in late November 2024\n- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally censured Kelly on January 5, 2025\n- Hegseth called the censure \"a necessary process step\" toward possible penalties including:\n  - Reducing Kelly's retired rank of captain\n  - Cutting his military retirement pay\n- Hegseth stated Kelly was the only lawmaker investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and remains subject to Pentagon jurisdiction\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\n\n*Government position (Justice Department attorney John Bailey):*\n- Congress has determined retired service members remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n- \"Retirees are part of the armed forces. They are not separated from the services.\"\n\n*Kelly's attorneys' position (including Benjamin Mizer):*\n- No legal basis exists for limiting free speech rights of military retirees, particularly when speaking in civilian or political capacity\n- Unaware of any ruling supporting diminished First Amendment protections for retired service members\n- Kelly's comments are clearly protected political speech\n- \"Any other approach would be to make new law\"\n\n**Background on the Video:**\n- 90-second video posted in November featuring Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers (all veterans)\n- Video urged military personnel to uphold the Constitution and reject unlawful orders\n- Also featured: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan), Reps. Jason Crow (Colorado), Chris Deluzio (Pennsylvania), Maggie Goodlander (New Hampshire), and Chrissy Houlahan (Pennsylvania)\n- President Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition in a social media post, calling their actions \"punishable by DEATH\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/can-pentagon-strip-mark-kellys-rank-over-speech\">\n# Summary of \"Can the Pentagon strip Mark Kelly's rank over speech?\"\n\n**Source:** The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression  \n**Date:** January 9, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Pentagon Actions:** The Pentagon announced \"de-ranking procedures\" against Sen. Mark Kelly for participating in a video stating that military personnel \"can disobey illegal orders.\"\n\n2. **Kelly's Response:** Kelly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop these procedures.\n\n3. **Other Members Investigated:** Five other members of Congress who participated in the video (Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan, Maggie Goodlander, and Sen. Elissa Slotkin) are being probed by the Justice Department. None of them served long enough to face deranking.\n\n4. **Legal Basis for Pentagon Action:** Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the Pentagon is moving to dock Kelly's captain rank and retirement pension under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370(f), which governs the rank of retired officers. Hegseth called the video \"reckless and seditious\" and accused Kelly of \"reckless misconduct.\"\n\n5. **Potential Charges:** Hegseth argues Kelly violated UCMJ Articles 133 (conduct unbecoming an officer) and 134 (service discrediting speech).\n\n## Legal Context Provided:\n\n- **The Law Kelly Stated:** Page 402 of the Manual for Courts-Martial establishes that servicemembers can refuse \"patently illegal orders.\" The military's 2024 Operational Law Handbook (page 86) expressly states troops should learn the duty to refuse \"manifestly\" illegal orders.\n\n- **Military Retiree Status:** Kelly served 25 years in the Navy and remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(a)(4).\n\n- **Article 133 Standards:** Requires conduct \"more serious than slight\" and \"of a material and pronounced character.\" When speech is involved, it must pose a \"clear and present danger\" of dishonoring the officer. The government hasn't brought an Article 133 case against a retiree since 1958.\n\n- **Article 134 Standards:** Prohibits \"service discrediting\" speech that could \"prejudice good order and discipline.\" Case law (United States v. Wilcox, 2008) established a nexus test requiring \"a reasonably direct and palpable connection between the speech and the military mission or military environment.\"\n\n## Opinion from Source:\n\nThe article (from a free speech advocacy organization) argues that Kelly \"merely stated the law\" and that \"simply stating the law is protected under the Constitution.\" It questions how accurately stating the law creates a \"clear and present danger\" and notes the high bar for proving conduct unbecoming an officer, especially for retirees whose speech poses no immediate risk to military order and discipline.\n\n**Note:** This article is from an advocacy organization (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression) focused on free speech rights, which may influence its framing of the legal issues.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-kelly-pentagon-investigation-video-unlawful-orders/\">\n# Summary of CBS News Article (November 24, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Pentagon Investigation**: The Pentagon announced it is conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a former U.S. Navy captain, to determine whether he should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.\n\n2. **The Video**: Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers who released a video last week calling on service members and intelligence community members to \"refuse illegal orders.\" The other five lawmakers were:\n   - Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan)\n   - Rep. Jason Crow (Colorado)\n   - Rep. Chris Deluzio (Pennsylvania)\n   - Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (Pennsylvania)\n   - Rep. Maggie Goodlander (New Hampshire)\n   \n   All six are veterans or former national security officials.\n\n3. **Pentagon's Statement**: The Pentagon said it received \"serious allegations of misconduct\" and that \"a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"\n\n4. **Legal Basis**: The Pentagon cited federal law that:\n   - Prohibits \"actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces\"\n   - Bans activity that \"advises, counsels, urges, or in any manner causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty\"\n   - Applies to military retirees\n\n5. **Jurisdiction**: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth noted that five of the six lawmakers do not fall under Pentagon jurisdiction, but Kelly does.\n\n## Statements from Named Sources:\n\n**Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth:**\n- Referred to the lawmakers as the \"Seditious Six\"\n- Said Kelly's conduct \"brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\"\n- Called the video \"despicable, reckless, and false\"\n- Stated: \"the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation-lending the appearance of authority to his words\"\n\n**President Trump:**\n- Accused the lawmakers of \"seditious behavior\"\n- Posted \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"\n- Reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"\n- Later clarified: \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble\"\n\n**Sen. Mark Kelly:**\n- Learned about the investigation via social media\n- Responded: \"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work\"\n- On \"Face the Nation\": \"All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders\"\n- Said Trump's words \"could have serious, serious consequences\" and noted \"there is now increased threats against us\"\n\n## Status:\nAs of the article date (November 24, 2025), an investigation has been initiated but no decision has been made about recalling Kelly to active duty.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2026/02/04/judge-seems-skeptical-of-legal-justification-pentagons-punishment-of-sen-mark-kelly.html\">\n# Summary of Military.com Article (February 4, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Court Hearing Date**: February 4, 2026 - Federal Judge Richard Leon heard arguments on Sen. Mark Kelly's case\n\n2. **Kelly's Legal Action**: Kelly's attorneys are seeking to block the Pentagon from punishing him, claiming violations of his First Amendment free speech rights\n\n3. **Current Punishment Status**: Kelly received a censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on January 5, 2026\n\n4. **Potential Further Penalties**: The censure was described as \"a necessary process step\" that could lead to:\n   - Demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain\n   - Reduction in retirement pay\n\n5. **Judge's Position**: Judge Leon (nominated by President George W. Bush) appeared skeptical of the government's legal justification, stating:\n   - He knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's actions\n   - Told government attorney: \"You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done\"\n   - Expressed concern about \"chilling effect\" on other military retirees who wish to voice opinions\n\n6. **No Immediate Ruling**: Judge did not rule from the bench but indicated he hopes to issue a ruling by the following Wednesday (approximately February 11, 2026)\n\n## Government's Legal Argument:\n\n- Justice Department attorney John Bailey argued that retired military service members remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n- \"Retirees are part of the armed forces. They are not separated from the services.\"\n\n## Kelly's Legal Argument:\n\n- Attorney Benjamin Mizer argued there is no precedent supporting the notion that military retirees have \"diminished speech rights\"\n- The First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case\n\n## Important Note on Resolution Criteria:\n\n**The article does NOT indicate that Kelly has been recalled to active duty.** He received a censure, which is a form of punishment, but this is distinct from being placed on Active Duty status.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide a list of U.S. military retirees who were recalled to active duty for court-martial since 2000 and how long each recall took from investigation announcement to activation; include statutory authority and rank.\nBelow is the best\u2010supported roster, drawn from the open sources provided, of U.S. military retirees who have actually been ordered back to active duty for purposes of court-martial since 1 January 2000.

(NIMJ \u201cRetirees-Update\u201d blog)  \n   \u2022 Investigation announcement: 3 Feb 2019 (CID press release referenced in ACCA opinion, United States v. Morser).  \n   \u2022 Recall: 20 Mar 2019 (date Morser reported to Fort Bragg on active-duty orders for Article-32).  \n   \u2022 Lag: \u2248 6 weeks.\n\nSummary of empirical pattern  \n\u2022 All recalls invoked two complementary statutes: Article 2, UCMJ (jurisdiction) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (service-secretary authority to order regular retirees to active duty).  \n\u2022 The measured time between a publicly identifiable \u201cinvestigation announced\u201d milestone and the retiree\u2019s activation ranged from one to about six weeks in the five documented cases.  The driver appears to be how quickly charges were drafted and an Article-32 hearing could be convened after investigators believed they had probable cause.  \n\u2022 Ranks recalled since 2000 run from E-6 (GySgt) up to O-8 (Maj Gen).  No flag officer retiree above O-8 has yet been ordered back since 2000.  \n\u2022 All known cases involved serious felony-level allegations (rape, child sexual assault, or comparable crimes) rather than purely military disciplinary offenses.\n\nInformation gaps  \nThe open-source record leaves several items either approximate or unknown:  \n1. Exact dates of the orders to active duty (sometimes only the Article-32 proceeding date is public).  \n2. Whether any lesser-known retiree recalls at the E-4 to E-5 level occurred but were not covered by national media; service dockets are not centrally searchable.  \n3. Whether Maj. Gen. Grazioplene\u2019s August 2017 hearing followed an earlier, unpublicized investigative start\u2014if so, the lag measured above understates total investigation length but meets the question\u2019s definition (announcement-to-activation).  \n4. Outcomes: convictions, dismissals, or administrative dispositions, while not requested, would give fuller context.\n\nTo close those gaps additional document searches in service trial-judiciary portals (e.g., Army Trial Docket, Navy OJAG Court-Martial Docket) or FOIA requests for the exact recall orders would be required.  Further Google/Google News queries worded \u201corder to active duty for court-martial\u201d plus each surname may surface local-paper reporting that supplies the missing order dates.\n\nBecause the principal publicly reported retiree recalls are captured above, the analysis is substantially complete for the time period requested; only granular order-date confirmation remains outstanding.</Agent_report>\n"
