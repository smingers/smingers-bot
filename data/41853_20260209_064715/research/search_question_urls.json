Mark Kelly over video urging troops to defy 'illegal orders'\"\n\n**Date:** November 24, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**The Investigation:**\n- The Pentagon announced Monday it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over possible breaches of military law\n- Kelly, a former Navy pilot who retired at the rank of captain, appeared in a video with other lawmakers urging troops to defy \"illegal orders\"\n- The Pentagon cited federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures\n- The Pentagon statement suggested Kelly's statements \"interfered with the 'loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces'\"\n- The statement said: \"A thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures\"\n\n**Why Kelly Specifically:**\n- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kelly is facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon's jurisdiction\n- Hegseth stated: \"Kelly's conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\"\n\n**The Video:**\n- Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers (all with military or intelligence backgrounds) who appeared in the video\n- Other lawmakers: Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, and Chrissy Houlahan\n- In the video, Kelly told troops \"you can refuse illegal orders,\" while others said troops needed to \"stand up for our laws... our Constitution\"\n- The lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video\n\n**Political Context:**\n- The article describes it as \"extraordinary\" for the Pentagon to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation\n- Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition \"punishable by DEATH\" in a social media post days after the video was released\n- The video's release comes as the Trump administration has ordered the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continues attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities\n\n**Responses:**\n\n*Kelly's Response:*\n- Dismissed the Pentagon investigation as the work of \"bullies\"\n- Said: \"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work\"\n\n*Other Democratic Senators:*\n- Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of using the Pentagon \"as his personal attack dog\" and said \"this is what dictators do\"\n- Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) said \"Mark told the truth \u2014 in America, we swear an oath to the Constitution, not wannabe kings\"\n\n**Expert Legal Analysis:**\n\n*Stephen Vladeck (Georgetown University law professor):*\n- Said there has been \"a quiet but significant uptick in courts-martial of retired servicemembers, even for post-retirement offenses\" in the past decade\n- Noted there has been debate in courts about their constitutionality but the practice is currently allowed\n\n*Anthony Michael Kreis (Georgia State University constitutional law professor):*\n- Said Kelly's status as a U.S. senator could complicate the Pentagon's investigation\n- Stated: \"Having a United States senator subject to discipline at the behest of the secretary of defense and the president \u2014 that violates a core principle of legislative independence\"\n- Explained the Constitution explicitly shields members of Congress from White House overreach as a reaction to British monarchy's arbitrary punishment of Parliament members\n- Said: \"Any way you cut it, the Constitution is fundamentally structurally designed to prevent this kind of abuse from happening\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said last week: \"our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders\"\n- The article notes troops do have specific obligations to reject unlawful orders, though rank-and-file troops rarely have access to military lawyers for consultation\n- A former service member who helps run an online military forum (speaking anonymously) said the lawmakers' message is unlikely to reach troops because the video was only posted on X and was too long for platforms like TikTok where troops actually consume information\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2\">\n# Summary of AP News Article: \"Trump says Democrats' message to military is 'seditious behavior' punishable by death\"\n\n**Date:** November 20, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **The Video**: Six Democratic lawmakers (all veterans of armed services/intelligence community) released a 90-second video on Tuesday, November 19, 2025, calling on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy \"illegal orders.\"\n   - Lawmakers featured: Sen.
