**US Economic Data Articles:**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Official November 2025 data: 330.447** - Multiple sources confirm this (FRED primary, corroborated by S&P reports). This is the factual starting point.
2. **Expert consensus on minimal 2026 growth** - JPMorgan (0%), Redfin (1%), Realtor.com (2.2%) all predict low single-digit or zero growth. These are identifiable experts from major institutions with clear methodologies.
3. **Structural constraint: mortgage rates at 6%+** - Multiple sources confirm rates remain elevated, creating affordability crisis. This is a structural factor difficult to change quickly.
4. **Recent momentum: 3 consecutive months of positive MoM growth** - Calculated Risk confirms this pattern from August-November 2025, showing recovery from mid-2025 trough.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Regional divergence** - Sun Belt declining (Tampa -3.9%, Phoenix -1.4% YoY) while Northeast/Midwest growing (Chicago +5.7%, New York +5.0%). This creates volatility but national index averages these out.
2. **Real price decline** - Godec (S&P DJI) notes prices lag inflation by 1.3-1.7 percentage points. This suggests nominal growth may continue but real wealth erosion could dampen demand.
3. **Inventory dynamics** - JPM estimates 1.2M home shortage (lower than consensus), but supply increasing in some regions. Mixed signal.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Policy speculation** - Trump administration mortgage interventions mentioned but JPM estimates only 10-15 basis point impact. Too small and uncertain.
2. **Seasonal patterns** - While historical January typically shows gains, seasonal adjustment should minimize this effect.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 2026 is approximately 2 months from November 2025 data point. Resolution occurs when first estimate is published (likely late March 2026).

**If timeframe halved (1 month to December 2025):**
Would predict tighter range around 331.0-331.5, as one month of data carries less uncertainty. Recent MoM gains of +0.4% suggest December would be ~330.9-331.3.

**If timeframe doubled (4 months to March 2026):**
Would widen distribution significantly (329-335 range) as cumulative uncertainty increases. Expert forecasts of 0-2% annual growth imply ~0.5-1.5 points over 4 months, but volatility compounds.

**Current 2-month horizon:** Moderate uncertainty. Recent 2-month patterns show +1.15 to +2.69 point changes. Expert consensus suggests continuation of slow growth but with downside risks from affordability constraints.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Anchoring:**
Outside view established 331.5-332.5 as central range based on:
- Recent 2-month historical patterns (+1.0 to +1.5 points typical)
- November 2025 starting point of 330.447
- Seasonal adjustment minimizing January effects

**Factors Supporting Modest Upward Shift:**
1. **Momentum continuation** - Three consecutive months of positive growth suggests trend has legs
2. **Supply constraints persist** - JPM's 1.2M shortage estimate, while lower than consensus, still indicates undersupply
3. **Historical January patterns** - Even with seasonal adjustment, January has typically shown small gains

**Factors Supporting Downward Adjustment:**
1. **Expert consensus heavily weighted toward zero growth** - JPM's 0% forecast for full year 2026 is particularly significant given their research depth
2. **Godec's characterization** - Index provider's own expert describing "tepid growth" and "real decline" suggests limited upside
3. **Affordability crisis intensifying** - Multiple experts cite "buyer strike" dynamics
4. **Recent FHFA data** - Shows YoY growth decelerating sharply (4.8% → 1.9% Oct to Nov)
5. **Regional weakness** - Sun Belt declines could accelerate, dragging national average

**Distribution Shift Justification:**
The outside view's 331.5-332.5 central range appears slightly optimistic given:
- Expert consensus clusters around 0% annual growth (implies ~0 points/month, not +0.5-1.0)
- Godec's direct commentary from index provider suggests stagnation
- Recent FHFA deceleration pattern

However, recent momentum (3 months positive) and 2-month historical patterns support some continued growth. I'll shift the distribution slightly lower and wider:
- Central tendency: 331.0-332.0 (vs outside view's 331.5-332.5)
- Downside risk increased: More weight on 329-330 range given expert warnings
- Upside capped: 90th percentile at 333.5 (vs 334.5) given structural constraints

## Distribution Calibration

**Starting Point:** November 2025 = 330.447

**Central Scenario (40th-60th percentiles):**
Continuation of recent positive momentum but at decelerating rate. Recent MoM gains of +0.4% suggest December ~331.1, January ~331.7. This aligns with historical 2-month gains of +1.0-1.5 points but acknowledges expert warnings of stagnation.

**Downside Scenario (10th-20th percentiles):**
Affordability constraints intensify, momentum stalls or reverses. JPM's 0% annual forecast and Godec's "tepid growth" characterization suggest flat to slight decline possible. 10th percentile at 329.5 represents modest 2-month decline (-0.95 points), consistent with mid-2025 weakness. 20th percentile at 330.5 represents stagnation.

**Upside Scenario (80th-90th percentiles):**
Stronger momentum continuation, perhaps driven by year-end/new-year buying activity or unexpected rate relief. 80th percentile at 332.5 represents robust 2-month gain (+2.05 points), near upper end of recent historical range. 90th percentile at 333.5 represents very strong continuation (+3.05 points), but capped by structural constraints experts identify.

**Distribution Shape:**
Slightly negatively skewed - more downside risk than upside given expert consensus and structural headwinds. Central mass concentrated in 331-332 range.

**Calibration Checks:**
- Implied median ~331.5: Reasonable given +1.05 point gain from November
- Implied mean ~331.6: Slightly above median due to tail risks
- Range (329.5-333.5): 4-point spread appropriate for 2-month horizon with current uncertainty
- Alignment with expert forecasts: 0-2% annual growth implies 0-0.5 points/month; my distribution centers on ~0.5 points/month, slightly optimistic but justified by recent momentum

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Seasonally adjusted S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index for January 2026, published as first estimate (likely March 2026), index value with 2 decimal precision.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view centered on 331.5-332.5; my forecast shifted slightly lower to 331.0-332.0 based on expert consensus weighting toward zero growth and index provider's "tepid" characterization.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 331.5; mean ≈ 331.6. This represents +1.05 point gain over 2 months from November's 330.447, consistent with recent momentum but acknowledging expert warnings of stagnation. Makes sense.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - November 2025 official data: 330.447 (FRED/S&P) - factually verified
   - JPM expert forecast: 0% growth for 2026 (John Sim, Jan 27) - identifiable expert, major institution
   - S&P DJI expert: "tepid growth" characterization (Nicholas Godec, Jan 27) - index provider's own assessment
   - Recent momentum: 3 consecutive months positive MoM growth - verified in multiple sources
   - Structural constraint: 6%+ mortgage rates creating affordability crisis - confirmed across sources

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpected Fed rate cuts or policy intervention (e.g., Trump mortgage program proves more effective than JPM estimates) could accelerate price growth beyond my 90th percentile. This would push outcome UP to 334-335 range.

6. **Status quo outcome:** November 2025 = 330.447. Given 2-month timeframe and moderate volatility, slight nudge toward status quo (330-331 range) might be warranted, but recent momentum and historical patterns support modest growth. Current distribution already conservative relative to outside view.
