## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent 6-month trend (July-Nov 2025)**
- Gained 3.95 points over 4 months (July-Nov)
- Average monthly gain: ~0.99 points
- Suitable because it reflects current market conditions post-correction

**Reference Class 2: Seasonal patterns (Nov-Jan historically)**
- Winter months typically show slower growth or slight declines
- December often shows seasonal weakness
- January can rebound slightly
- Moderately suitable but seasonal adjustment should minimize this

**Reference Class 3: Post-peak stabilization periods**
- After Feb 2024 peak (331.52), index declined then stabilized
- Current recovery phase shows momentum but expert consensus suggests deceleration
- Most suitable given expert forecasts and current trajectory

**Selected Reference Class:** Post-peak stabilization with current momentum (Class 3), adjusted for expert consensus of 0-2% annual growth.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 10, 2026
- Target: January 2026 index
- Note: January 2026 data uses 3-month moving average (Nov, Dec, Jan sales)
- The value already incorporates November and December 2025 data
- Resolution: March 29, 2026 (first estimate publication)

**Recent Monthly Changes (Last 6 months):**
- Aug 2025: +0.51 (+0.16%)
- Sep 2025: +0.75 (+0.23%)
- Oct 2025: +1.38 (+0.42%)
- Nov 2025: +1.31 (+0.40%)
- Average recent gain: ~0.99 points/month

**Historical Nov-Jan patterns (seasonally adjusted):**
- 2024-25: Nov 329.97 → Dec 327.77 → Jan 329.24 (net +0.73 over 2 months from Nov to Jan)
- 2023-24: Nov 330.81 → Dec 331.12 → Jan 331.12 (net +0.31)
- Pattern suggests modest gains or stability

## (d) Justification

The January 2026 index will likely show continued but moderating growth from November 2025's 330.45:

**Bullish factors:**
1. Strong momentum: 4-month uptrend averaging +0.99/month
2. October (+1.38) and November (+1.31) showed robust gains
3. Pending sales jumped in November (per Marketplace article)
4. Seasonal adjustment should smooth winter weakness

**Bearish factors:**
1. Expert consensus: 0-2% annual growth implies ~0.08-0.17% monthly
2. Market "settling into slower gear" (Godec quote)
3. High mortgage rates constraining demand
4. Inventory increasing, time-on-market lengthening
5. December typically shows seasonal softness even with adjustment
6. Real prices declining when adjusted for inflation

**Most likely scenario:** 
Given the 3-month moving average methodology, January incorporates Nov-Dec-Jan data. November was strong (330.45). December likely showed typical seasonal moderation. January sales data would be partial. The momentum from late 2025 should carry forward but at a decelerating rate consistent with expert forecasts.

Expected range: 330.5 to 332.5, with central estimate around 331.3-331.7.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring considerations:**
1. November 2025 baseline: 330.45
2. Recent monthly gains: 0.5-1.4 points
3. Expert consensus implies deceleration to ~0.2-0.5 points/month
4. Historical Nov-Jan: typically +0.3 to +0.7 points over 2 months

**Distribution shape:**
- Central tendency: 331.0-332.0 (modest continuation of trend)
- Downside tail: Market could stall or reverse (329.5-330.5)
- Upside tail: Momentum could persist stronger than expected (332.5-333.5)

**Calibration factors:**
1. 3-month moving average smooths volatility
2. Seasonal adjustment reduces winter weakness
3. Expert forecasts suggest moderation but not reversal
4. Recent data shows clear upward momentum
5. Unknown unknowns: policy changes, market shocks, data revisions

**Percentile reasoning:**
- 10th percentile: Significant deceleration or reversal (329.8)
- 20th percentile: Minimal growth from November (330.7)
- 40th percentile: Modest growth below recent trend (331.2)
- 60th percentile: Moderate growth consistent with momentum (331.8)
- 80th percentile: Strong continuation of recent trend (332.4)
- 90th percentile: Unexpectedly robust growth (333.0)
