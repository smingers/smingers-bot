Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. FRED CSUSHPISA series (Nov-25 = 330.45, Oct-25 = 329.14). Primary data used for resolution; factual, timely, high quality.  
2. S&P press releases (Nov-25 and Sep-25) – confirm MoM SA gains of +0.4 % in Nov, +0.2 % in Oct; identify regional divergence; reliable, data only.  
3. JPMorgan Housing Outlook (27 Jan 26) – forecasts 0 % 2026 nominal growth; highlights supply overhang, elevated mortgage rates; identifiable experts, moderate quality (forward-looking).  
4. Realtor.com / Marketplace outlooks (18 Dec 25) – expect 1-2 % 2026 price growth, 6.3 % mortgages; single-source forecasts, moderate.  
5. TradingEconomics 20-city data – shows tiny MoM decline Nov-25; related but not identical series, weak direct weight.  
No other AskNews articles give additional U.S. home-price facts.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong: FRED/S&P hard numbers show three consecutive SA monthly rises through Nov-25.  
Moderate: JPMorgan & Realtor forecasts of flat-to-slight-positive 2026 prices; FHFA Oct-25 SA +0.4 %.  
Weak: Stock-market and CPI articles (no direct causal link inside two-month window).

(c) Timeframe analysis
We are 49 days from first Jan-26 print; projecting only two “index months” (Dec-25 & Jan-26) beyond latest observation. If the horizon were halved, uncertainty would shrink ~30 %; if doubled, tail risk (rate shock, labour hit) would widen ~40 %.

(d) Justification (inside-view shift)
Base-rate: Over 2024-25, 2-month changes in CSUSHPISA were –0.6 % to +1.0 % (≈ ±2 points).  
Latest momentum (+0.4 % MoM Nov, +0.3 % Oct) argues for a mild upward drift into Jan unless abruptly reversed.  
Headwinds—6 %+ mortgage rates, rising inventory—suggest momentum fades rather than accelerates.  
Three-month moving-average construction further dampens any single-month weakness.  
Net: central estimate moved up ~+0.3 % (+1.0 point) from Nov-25, with symmetric but slightly fatter upper tail (in case Dec strength persisted).

Distribution calibration
Median (50th≈60th pct here) 332 – 332.5. 80/20 set at ±1.2–1.4 points; 10/90 at roughly ±2–3 points, matching historic two-month volatility.

Checklist:
1. Target: Seasonally adjusted Case-Shiller National Index level for Jan 2026 (Jan-00 = 100).  
2. Outside-view distribution anchored to 330.45 Nov-25, σ≈1.2 points.  
3. Implied median ≈ 332.0; mean ≈ 331.8 – consistent with “slightly up” narrative.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Nov-25 +0.4 % MoM, (ii) three-month averaging, (iii) JPMorgan flat 2026 outlook, (iv) 6 %+ mortgage rates, (v) rising inventory.  
5. Blind-spot: December/January shock drop in closed-sale prices (e.g., sudden 100 bp rate spike) would push outcome <329.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution still centred close to last print.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; two-decimal precision; within bounds.
