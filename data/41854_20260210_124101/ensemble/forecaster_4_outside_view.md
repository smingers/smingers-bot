Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED CSUSHPISA data table (Nov-2025 value = 330.447).  
   • High-quality primary data, published 30 Jan 2026. Purely factual.  
2. FRED CSUSHPINSA table (non-seasonally-adjusted series).  
   • Same publisher, but different series; useful only as a rough cross-check.  
3. FHFA HPI news release (Dec 2025).  
   • Federal agency, credible, but a different index. Indicates U.S. prices were roughly flat / +0.4 % MoM in Oct-25.  
4. Marketplace, Yahoo Finance articles (Dec 2025).  
   • Journalistic summaries of the Oct-25 Case-Shiller release. Opinions quoted from S&P experts; factual numbers match the FRED data.  
5. Realtor.com December-2025 trends (8 Jan 2026).  
   • List-price and inventory data, not repeat-sales. Confirms soft demand and rising supply.  
6. Agent report compiling CSUSHPISA history and 2026 bank forecasts (10 Feb 2026).  
   • Secondary synthesis; raw numbers for 2024-25 match FRED. 2026 forecasts (JPM, NAR, CoreLogic/Cotality, etc.) are all low-single-digit gains. Quality acceptable, but taken only as evidence of consensus expectations, not facts.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Full 1987-2025 CSUSHPISA monthly changes.  
• Post-GFC (2012-2025) monthly changes.  
• Last two years (2024-25) monthly changes.  
I prefer the 2012-2025 window: it captures a mature, low-inflation housing market that includes both the post-pandemic boom and the current flat period. Over those 156 months the seasonally-adjusted 1-month change is approximately Normal(μ≈+0.25 pt, σ≈1.3 pt). Two-month-ahead changes therefore have σ≈1.8 pt.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 2 months from the target observation. Because the index is a three-month moving average, only two new sales-months (Dec-25, Jan-26) will enter the Jan-26 figure that were not in Nov-25. Short horizon → historically small absolute moves.

(d) Justification for an outside view  
Status quo (Nov-25 reading) = 330.45.  
Long-run drift: +0.25 pt/month ≈ +0.08 %.  
Two-month expected drift ≈ +0.5 pt → center ~331.0.  
Stochastic component: σ₂-mo ≈ 1.8 pt. 90 % normal band ≈ ±3.0 pt.  
Tail risk: occasional outsized prints in 2008-09 and 2020 suggest slightly fatter tails; I widen the 10th/90th by ~0.5 pt.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline distribution = Normal(μ = 331.0, σ = 1.8)  
Add 0.5 pt cushion to the 10th/90th to acknowledge heavy tails and potential revisions.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 327.5  
Percentile 20: 328.9  
Percentile 40: 330.2  
Percentile 60: 331.6  
Percentile 80: 333.0  
Percentile 90: 334.5
