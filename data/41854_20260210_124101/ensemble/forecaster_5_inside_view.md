Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. FRED data table (Nov-25 CSUSHPISA = 330.45). Primary, high-quality, released 30 Jan 2026. Pure fact – strongest weight.
2. S&P/Case-Shiller Nov-25 press release (Seeking Alpha, Benzinga). Same numbers plus regional detail. Reliable secondary, Jan 27 2026. Confirms mild +0.4 % m/m rise. Moderate weight.
3. J-P Morgan housing outlook (27 Jan 2026, Fortune & JP Morgan note). Identifiable experts; forecast 0 % y/y for 2026. Macro opinion. Moderate weight.
4. Marketplace.org piece on 2026 housing reset (18 Dec 2025). Uses Realtor.com & Redfin forecasts of +1–2 % in 2026. Moderate weight.
5. Misc. equity-market and China-housing articles – no direct bearing on US Case-Shiller. Ignored for forecasting.

(b) Evidence weighting
Strong evidence
• FRED time-series shows +1.31 points Oct→Nov after two prior +0.37/+0.37 rises, giving a short-run upward momentum.
• 10-year history: σ(1-mo) ≈0.8 points, median 0.55 points Nov-Jan; provides statistical envelope.

Moderate evidence
• Consensus sell-side (JPM, Realtor.com, Redfin) calls for flat to low-single-digit 2026 growth, implying slower M/M gains ahead.
• 30-yr mortgage rates eased ≈50-75 bp since Sept-25, slightly supporting demand.

Weak evidence
• Stock-market moves, Fed timing, China housing data – indirect at best.

(c) Timeframe analysis
About 7 weeks until the Jan-26 print is first released. Only two unknown monthly observations (Dec & Jan) remain. If the horizon were halved (3 ½ weeks, i.e. Dec print only) my distribution would tighten by ≈√½ ≈ 0.7; doubled (14 weeks) it would widen by ≈√2.

(d) Inside-view justification
Status quo (carry Nov’s level forward) gives 330.45.  
Momentum extrapolation: recent +0.40 % m/m seems unsustainably strong; I project Dec +0.25 %, Jan +0.20 %. That path yields a Jan level of 331.9 and, after 3-month averaging, a reported index of ≈331.2.  
Consensus cooling narrative and rising inventory argue for risk of a stall; a zero-growth path would leave the print near 330.3.  
Combining these, I keep the median slightly above status-quo at 331.1 and compress the 80 % interval to ±1.3 points (reflecting only two unknown months). Tails retain probability mass for a surprise reversal or continued surge.

Distribution calibration
Mean/median anchored at 331.1 (Jan 2000 = 100).  
Assumed normal-ish with σ ≈0.8 points.  
Mapped to percentiles:

10th  → μ –2.0 σ ≈ 329.5  
20th  → μ –1.1 σ ≈ 330.2  
40th  → μ –0.25 σ ≈ 330.9  
60th  → μ +0.25 σ ≈ 331.6  
80th  → μ +1.0 σ ≈ 332.4  
90th  → μ +1.6 σ ≈ 333.2  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: seasonally-adjusted S&P/Case-Shiller US National HPI, first Jan-26 estimate, index (Jan 2000=100).  
2. Outside-view distribution: μ = 331.8, 10-90 = 328.8–334.8.  
3. Consistency check – implied median 331.1; mean ≈331.1; aligns with momentum-plus-cooling story.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Nov print 330.45 (+0.4 % m/m); (ii) two-month historical σ ≈ 1.1 pts; (iii) mortgage-rate easing; (iv) JPM & Redfin flat-price forecasts.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden mortgage-rate plunge below 5.5 % in Feb could push prices sharply higher (upside).  
6. Status quo reminder: simply holding Nov level gives 330.45; my median only 0.6 pts above this.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; within 275–375 bound; units correct.
