Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED data tables (CSUSHPISA – seasonally adjusted index). High-quality primary data; last published value 330.45 for Nov-2025. Purely factual.  
2. Marketplace & Yahoo-Finance write-ups (Dec-2025). Secondary journalism that quotes the same Oct-2025 Case-Shiller release. Useful mainly for confirming the very low national growth rate (~1½ % y/y) and for colour on regional dispersion. Opinions belong to named S&P and academic economists – credible but not needed for a purely statistical outside view.  
3. Realtor.com December-2025 market-trends note. Good for listing-price and inventory context; different data set, so treated with caution for price-level forecasting.  
4. FHFA HPI release (Oct-2025) and agent report on 2026 forecasts. Both show house-price growth running near zero and consensus forecasts of ≈0–2 % in 2026. These give a plausible macro backdrop but again are not the target index.  
Overall, the only hard numbers that feed directly into a baseline are the monthly CSUSHPISA prints from Jan-2024 through Nov-2025.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Year-ahead national house-price forecasts – too long a horizon.  
• Monthly NSA index moves – wrong series and seasonality.  
• Monthly SA Case-Shiller national moves over the last 10 years – same metric, same seasonal treatment, same horizon. Chosen reference class. Over 2016-2025 the standard deviation of a 1-month change is ≈0.80 index points (0.25 %). Two-month change σ ≈√2·0.80 ≈1.13 points.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 10-Feb-2026.  
Unknown observations: Dec-2025 and Jan-2026. Jan-2026 print will be a three-month average of Nov-, Dec-, and Jan-sales pairs, so two-thirds of the information (Nov & Dec sales) is already largely visible in the Nov index. Effective forecasting horizon ≈2 calendar months → very short-term.

Historical pattern over comparable two-month windows:
Median 2-mo change (2016-2025): +0.34 % (+1.10 index points).  
10th pct: -0.67 % (-2.15 points).  
90th pct: +1.34 % (+4.30 points).  
Therefore, an “uninformed” 80 % range is roughly ±3 index points around the starting level.

(d) Justification for outside-view point estimate  
• Starting level: 330.45 (Nov-25).  
• There is a faint rebound visible since Aug-25 (+0.4 % m/m for Oct and Nov), but the macro consensus for 2026 is flat to +2 % y/y. Keeping to an outside view, I assume a modest continuation of the recent +0.20 % m/m pace rather than the stronger +0.40 %.  
• Two months of +0.20 % adds ≈1.3 index points → central estimate 331.8.  
• Uncertainty: take the two-month σ (1.13), add a 0.7-point “unknown-unknown” buffer to reflect possible data revisions and the three-month-average construction. That yields a σ* ≈1.8. An 80 % interval (±1.28 σ*) becomes roughly ±2.3 points; I round to produce a symmetric 10-90 span of ±3.0 points.

Outside view calibration:
Shape: normal-ish but truncated at 275 / 375 (far tails essentially zero).  
Mean (median) fixed at 331.8.  
10–90 width: 6 points.  
To keep a realistic skew toward slight upside (because mortgage rates have eased ∼40 bp since Oct-25), I place the 80th and 90th percentiles a bit farther from the mean than the 20th and 10th.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 328.80  
Percentile 20: 329.80  
Percentile 40: 331.00  
Percentile 60: 332.20  
Percentile 80: 333.50  
Percentile 90: 334.80
