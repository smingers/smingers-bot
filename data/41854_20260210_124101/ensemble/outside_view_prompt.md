You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the seasonally adjusted S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index in the following months? (Jan-26)

Question background:
The S\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index provides a measure of national home prices in the US. The [published methodology](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-corelogic-cs-home-price-indices.pdf) summarizes the methods as follows:

> The S\&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are based on observed changes in home prices. They are designed to measure increases or decreases in the market value of residential real estate in 20 defined MSAs and three price tiers – low, middle, and high (see Tables 1 and 1a on the following pages). In contrast, the indices are, specifically, not intended to measure recovery costs after disasters, construction or repair costs, or other such related items.The indices are calculated monthly, using a three-month moving average algorithm. Home sales pairs are accumulated in rolling three-month periods, on which the repeat sales methodology is applied. The index point for each reporting month is based on sales pairs found for that month and the preceding two months. For example, the December 2005 index point is based on repeat sales data for October, November, and December of 2005. This averaging methodology is used to offset delays that can occur in the flow of sales price data from county deed recorders and to keep sample sizes large enough to create meaningful price change averages.

Below is a graph of the seasonally adjusted S\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis). **Note that the chart may update with subsequent estimates published by the underlying source and may not reflect the initially published estimates.**

Remaining gaps are noted at the end.

2025-10   329.14  
2025-11   330.45  

Observations
• The index peaked in Feb-2024 (331.52), drifted downward through mid-2025, and only regained its January level by November-2025 (330.45).  
• The 10-month draw-down from Feb-2024 to Dec-2024 was -1.1 %.  
• Calendar-year average change: 2024 +0.9 % yr/yr; 2025 -0.7 % yr/yr.

B.  Public 2026 U.S. home-price forecasts  

1. J.P. Morgan Chase  
   • “National prices will be roughly flat in 2026 (0 % y/y) as 30-year rates stay above 6 % but ARM products and builder buydowns supply limited relief.” (J.P. Morgan Global Research note, 27 Jan 2026).  

2. Experian “Home Price Expectations” panel (survey of large forecasters, 4 Nov 2025).  
   • Range for 2026:  
     – Fannie Mae +1.3 %  
     – National Association of Realtors +4 %  
     – Mortgage Bankers Association -0.5 %  
   • Median (simple) ≈ +1.3 %.  

3. Investopedia round-up (10 Feb 2026).  
   • NAR +4 %, Fannie Mae +1.3 %, Zillow +1.2 %.  
   • Commentary notes that with Fed’s projected 2.6 % CPI, real (inflation-adjusted) prices would be flat to negative.  

4. TradingEconomics econometric projection (page accessed Feb 2026).  
   • Implied 2026 growth of +1.6 % for the national index (extrapolating from their 20-city composite forecast of 349.9 by 2027).  

5. CoreLogic / Cotality (U.S. Home Price Insights, January 2026)  
   • Cotality economists expect 2026 “price growth…at the low end of the long-term 4–5 % average.”  Language implies something in the 1–2 % area but stops short of quoting a single number.  Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp attributes the subdued outlook to lingering affordability constraints offset by better mortgage-rate dynamics and a seasonal pickup (Cotality article, January 2026).  

Consensus picture
Across major sources, 2026 national price appreciation clusters in a very narrow, low-single-digit band:
• Central tendency: 0 % to +2 %.  
• High end (NAR) tops out at +4 %, still well below the long-term 4–5 % average.  
• No mainstream forecaster is calling for a repeat of the post-pandemic double-digit gains, and none foresee a material nationwide decline.  
The collective view is that elevated but easing mortgage rates, thin inventory, and regional demand shifts will produce a near-stall in nominal appreciation and effectively flat to slightly negative “real” growth after inflation.

C.  Remaining gaps / next steps  

1. Goldman Sachs: no discrete 2026 national price forecast surfaced in the material reviewed.  
2. CoreLogic/Cotality: while the January-2026 Insights release provides qualitative guidance (“low end of 4–5 %”), it does not publish an exact figure.  If an explicit numeric forecast is required, the proprietary monthly CoreLogic HPI Forecast table would need to be consulted.  
3. The CSUSHPISA figures supplied above satisfy the original date range, but if month-ahead projections (Dec-2025 forward) are desired, separate model-based data would be required.

With those caveats, the query’s data and forecast components are now fully addressed.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
