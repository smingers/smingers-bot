    "description": "The S\\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index provides a measure of national home prices in the US. The [published methodology](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-corelogic-cs-home-price-indices.pdf) summarizes the methods as follows:\n\n> The S\\&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are based on observed changes in home prices. They are designed to measure increases or decreases in the market value of residential real estate in 20 defined MSAs and three price tiers \u2013 low, middle, and high (see Tables 1 and 1a on the following pages). In contrast, the indices are, specifically, not intended to measure recovery costs after disasters, construction or repair costs, or other such related items.The indices are calculated monthly, using a three-month moving average algorithm. Home sales pairs are accumulated in rolling three-month periods, on which the repeat sales methodology is applied. The index point for each reporting month is based on sales pairs found for that month and the preceding two months. For example, the December 2005 index point is based on repeat sales data for October, November, and December of 2005. This averaging methodology is used to offset delays that can occur in the flow of sales price data from county deed recorders and to keep sample sizes large enough to create meaningful price change averages.\n\nBelow is a graph of the seasonally adjusted S\\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis). **Note that the chart may update with subsequent estimates published by the underlying source and may not reflect the initially published estimates.**\n\n<iframe src=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=XHP6&width=100%25&height=475\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"overflow:hidden; width:100%; height:550px;\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":14070,\"question_id\":40296}}`",

Resolution will be determined according to the first estimate published as shown on this [FRED chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA#0) (also provided in the background).
