Analysis:
To estimate the January 2026 seasonally-adjusted S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index I first need:
• The most recently released actual readings (likely up through November 2025) to anchor a short-term trend.
• News discussing month-to-month momentum (e.g., effects of higher mortgage rates, inventory shifts, regional softening) because the index is a three-month moving average, so December 2025–January 2026 sales dynamics will matter.
• Forward-looking forecasts from banks, real-estate analysts, and housing research firms giving percentage-gain expectations for early-2026.
• Any indications of methodological changes or data revisions that could influence the early-2026 prints.

Current and very recent articles from mainstream business outlets (WSJ, Bloomberg, CNBC), research notes, and data releases will be most useful. Therefore I’ll search the open web for the latest index values, scan Google News for fresh commentary and forecasts, and ask AskNews for analyst outlooks extending specifically to January 2026.
