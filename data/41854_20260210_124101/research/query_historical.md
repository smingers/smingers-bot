Analysis:
To forecast the January 2026 reading, I first want the most recent published values (through the Nov-25 data released at end-Jan 2026), month-over-month and year-over-year growth rates, and any professional commentary on the near-term outlook. Historical releases and analyst write-ups around “December 2025” or the “most recent Case-Shiller release” will give both the latest number and color on momentum. Parallel searches in news help capture fresh forecasts. An Agent query can pull the time series directly from FRED and surface any 2026 projections cited by large banks or real-estate analysts. Finally, a FRED request for series CSUSHPISA supplies the complete numeric history for computing trends.
