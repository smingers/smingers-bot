You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the seasonally adjusted S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index in the following months? (Jan-26)

Question background:
The S\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index provides a measure of national home prices in the US. The [published methodology](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-corelogic-cs-home-price-indices.pdf) summarizes the methods as follows:

> The S\&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are based on observed changes in home prices. They are designed to measure increases or decreases in the market value of residential real estate in 20 defined MSAs and three price tiers – low, middle, and high (see Tables 1 and 1a on the following pages). In contrast, the indices are, specifically, not intended to measure recovery costs after disasters, construction or repair costs, or other such related items.The indices are calculated monthly, using a three-month moving average algorithm. Home sales pairs are accumulated in rolling three-month periods, on which the repeat sales methodology is applied. The index point for each reporting month is based on sales pairs found for that month and the preceding two months. For example, the December 2005 index point is based on repeat sales data for October, November, and December of 2005. This averaging methodology is used to offset delays that can occur in the flow of sales price data from county deed recorders and to keep sample sizes large enough to create meaningful price change averages.

Below is a graph of the seasonally adjusted S\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis). **Note that the chart may update with subsequent estimates published by the underlying source and may not reflect the initially published estimates.**

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically pertains to (and resolves according to) the option 'Jan-26'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. 

This resolves as the value of the seasonally adjusted S\&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index for the listed month. Resolution will be determined according to the first estimate published as shown on this [FRED chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA#0) (also provided in the background). The value will resolve to a precision of two decimal places

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-10. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-10 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 275 and the upper bound is 375.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
