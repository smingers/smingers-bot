(Jan-26)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**National Housing Market Shows First Signs of Stabilization in January 2026**\nIn January 2026, China's real estate market showed early signs of stabilization, particularly in the secondary housing market. National key 13 cities recorded a 16% month-on-month increase and a 33% year-on-year rise in second-hand home transaction volume, reaching 8.1 million square meters\u201418% higher than the 2025 monthly average. The transaction volume of 22 cities rose to 2.79 million square meters, the highest since June 2025, with year-on-year growth turning positive at 17.7%. Nationwide, 26 key cities saw a 27.0% year-on-year increase in real-time transaction contracts, with a 18.5% month-on-month rise. Price trends also stabilized: the national second-hand home listing price decline narrowed to 0.7% month-on-month (from 1.3% in previous months), with first-tier, second-tier, and third-tier cities all showing reduced monthly drops. The average price in 100 cities was 12,900 yuan per square meter, down 0.85% month-on-month, but with a narrowing decline. Core cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen reported strong performance: Beijing surpassed 15,000 transactions, Shanghai hit a five-year high with 22,800 transactions, Guangzhou reached 8,881 transactions, and Shenzhen saw a 45.5% year-on-year increase. Market sentiment improved, with housing inventory falling and bargaining power shifting to sellers. In Beijing, one agent noted prices in a school district rose 100,000\u2013150,000 yuan after policy changes. The 'iceberg index'\u2014a proxy for real-time transaction activity\u2014rose 14% month-on-month, with Xiamen leading at 34%. Experts like Cao Jingjing (CPII) and Wu Jing (Tsinghua) suggest a 'small spring' (xiao yangchun) in Q1 2026 is likely, driven by stabilized demand in core cities, policy effects, and seasonal factors. However, new home sales declined: 50 key cities saw a 32% month-on-month drop in transaction volume. The overall market remains in a downward trend, but signs point to a bottoming-out phase. Long-term indicators\u2014such as stabilized demand in 40 cities (388 million sqm in 2025 vs. 393 million sqm in 2024), rising rental yields (2.39% in Dec 2025), and falling price-to-income ratios\u2014support a market near valuation bottom. Shanghai launched a new pilot program to acquire second-hand homes for affordable rental housing in three districts (Jing\u2019an, Pudong, Xuhui), with a projected need of 31.5 billion yuan. The 'old-to-new' exchange policy aims to reduce transaction costs (saving ~10% in commissions), support homeowners, and boost new home sales, but challenges remain: valuation discrepancies, limited buyer choice, and weak income expectations. Experts emphasize the need for institutional support, streamlined processes, and stronger coordination. Despite early signs of recovery, a nationwide rebound will require a longer cycle. Monitoring indicators include: (1) 100-city second-hand home prices stable (\u00b10.2% monthly for three months), (2) 35 key cities\u2019 monthly transaction volume at ~300,000 units, and (3) average listing duration under 90 days.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 10:56 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qdSUf5gurd)\n\n**Which Real Estate Indicators Are Improving?**\nRecent real estate data in China shows mixed trends in early 2026. For second-hand homes, sales declines have narrowed after adjusting for lunar calendar alignment, with national and first-tier city sales down -16% and -26.8% year-on-year, respectively, slightly improving from December 2025's -27.1% and -31.4%. Price declines have also eased, with the national average dropping 0.85% month-on-month in January 2026\u2014narrowing from December\u2019s 0.97%\u2014and key cities like Beijing and Shanghai seeing reduced declines. This improvement may reflect seasonal patterns, as January\u2013February price drops historically narrow by an average of 0.09 percentage points, with January 2026\u2019s 0.12-point narrowing slightly exceeding seasonality. Additionally,\u6302\u724c\u91cf (listings volume) has declined seasonally: 256 million units in 58 Anjuke\u2019s national data and 293 million in 26 cities via the Bingshan Index, both down from December 2025. For new homes, sales remain under pressure: after lunar adjustment, 67 cities saw a -44.7% year-on-year decline in sales area, worsening from December\u2019s -27.9%. Top 100 developers\u2019 sales dropped 27.3% year-on-year. However, new home prices rose slightly, averaging 17,000 RMB/m\u00b2 in January 2026, up 0.18% month-on-month, driven by high-end improvement projects in cities like Chengdu, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Despite a slight decline in total inventory\u2014from 53 billion m\u00b2 to 51 billion m\u00b2\u2014sales contraction has lengthened the overall absorption cycle from 78 to 84 months, indicating persistent market pressure. The data suggests temporary improvements in second-hand homes are likely due to seasonal and base effects, while new home markets continue to face significant challenges.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 03:13 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260210/49240536.html)\n\n**U.S. January CPI May Surpass Expectations Amid Tariff and Seasonal Pressures**\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release January 2026 Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on February 13, with growing concerns that it may exceed expectations. Inflation has not shown signs of easing, which could delay further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Economists forecast a 0.3% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year increase, but a sharper-than-expected rise is possible. Past trends show January CPI has consistently exceeded forecasts in 2023 and 2024. Two key factors could drive this: first, tariffs imposed under the Trump administration, which are largely absorbed by U.S. importers who pass costs on through price hikes; inventory buffers built before tariffs took effect have now depleted, leading to visible price increases in high-import items like electronics and computers, as shown by Adobe\u2019s e-commerce data. Second, 'residual seasonality'\u2014a persistent upward bias in January CPI due to seasonal price adjustments that do not fully eliminate annual January increases in gym memberships, streaming subscriptions, and medical costs. According to the Boston Fed, January CPI readings remain about 0.03 percentage points higher than other months. If January CPI comes in above expectations, it could derail market expectations of a rate cut starting in June. However, some analysts argue inflation remains manageable, citing price reductions by major U.S. food companies like PepsiCo and General Mills, driven by consumer demand for lower-cost private-label products amid ongoing cost-of-living pressures. This suggests companies are now less able to raise prices freely compared to past periods.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 08:49 PM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202602100428386945)\n\n**US stocks open in the red: Dow down over 100 points, Nasdaq slips 0.4%**\nUS stocks opened lower on Monday, February 9, 2026, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 128 points (0.2%), the S&P 500 declining 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.4%, reflecting renewed pressure on technology and growth-oriented stocks. This followed a volatile week, including a historic rally on Friday, February 6, 2026, when the Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time\u2014rising 1,200 points (2.5%)\u2014after a sharp sell-off driven by weakness in software and tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite gained over 2% on Friday, while Bitcoin rebounded from below $61,000 to above $70,000. Investors remained cautious ahead of key economic data, including the delayed January nonfarm payrolls report, scheduled for release on Wednesday, February 11, 2026, which economists forecast will show a gain of about 55,000 jobs, with an expected downward revision to prior payroll figures due to the annual benchmark update. The January consumer price index (CPI), also delayed by the government shutdown, is due Friday and is expected to show a 2.5% annual inflation rate. Additionally, Federal Reserve officials, including Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran, are set to speak, offering insight into monetary policy outlooks. On the corporate front, Coca-Cola and Ford Motor are scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, potentially influencing sector rotation away from high-growth tech stocks. According to Invezz, the market\u2019s cautious tone reflects concerns over inflation, labor market strength, and shifting investment flows.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 03:05 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2026/02/09/us-stocks-open-in-the-red-dow-down-over-100-points-nasdaq-slips-0-4/)\n\n**Goldman traders warn stock selling to continue in choppy US markets**\nGoldman Sachs' trading desk warns that US stock selling will continue in a choppy market environment, driven by trend-following algorithmic funds known as Commodity Trading Advisers (CTAs). The S&P 500 has already breached its short-term trigger for CTA selling, with Goldman projecting these systematic strategies to remain net sellers regardless of market direction. A renewed decline could trigger up to $33 billion in selling this week, and if the index falls below 6,707, an additional $80 billion in systematic selling could be unlocked over the next month. Even in a flat market, CTAs are expected to sell $15.4 billion of US equities this week, and if stocks rise, they would still unload about $8.7 billion. Investor stress remains high, with Goldman's Panic Index at 9.22\u2014indicating markets are near 'max fear' levels. S&P 500 top-of-book liquidity has deteriorated sharply to $4.1 million from a year-to-date average of $13.7 million, increasing intraday volatility and delaying price stabilization. Option dealer positioning has shifted from long gamma to flat to short gamma, amplifying moves in low-liquidity conditions. Other systematic strategies, such as risk-parity and volatility-control funds, are also in high-de-risking positions (81st and 71st percentiles, respectively), suggesting their impact could grow if volatility remains elevated. Seasonality adds pressure, as February historically brings choppiness after January's supportive flows fade. Retail investors are showing signs of fatigue, with $690 million in net selling over two days, signaling reduced appetite for 'buying all dips'\u2014particularly in crypto and crypto-linked equities. The S&P 500 had surged 2% on Friday, its biggest gain since May, following a sharp early-week drop triggered by the launch of Anthropic PBC's new AI automation tool, which caused billions in losses across software, financial services, and asset management stocks. Futures on the S&P 500 were up 0.2% at 8:27 p.m. in New York.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 03:15 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/goldman-traders-warn-stock-selling-to-continue-in-choppy-us-markets-126020900085_1.html)\n\n**Goldman Sachs traders warn stock selling isn't over in choppy market - CNBC TV18**\nGoldman Sachs' trading desk warns that stock selling in the US market is not over, citing continued pressure from Commodity Trading Advisers (CTAs) and low liquidity. The S&P 500 has already triggered its short-term sell signal for CTAs, systematic strategies that follow market trends rather than fundamentals. Goldman expects CTAs to remain net sellers regardless of market direction, with up to $33 billion in selling possible this week. If the S&P 500 falls below 6,707, an additional $80 billion in systematic selling could be unlocked over the next month. Even in a flat market, CTAs are projected to sell $15.4 billion, and if stocks rise, they may still shed $8.7 billion. Investor stress is high, with Goldman's Panic Index at 9.22\u2014near 'max fear' levels. The S&P 500 surged 2% on Friday, its biggest gain since May, following a sharp mid-week drop triggered by the launch of Anthropic PBC's new AI automation tool, which caused billions in losses across software, financial services, and asset management stocks. S&P 500 top-of-book liquidity has collapsed to $4.1 million, down from a year-to-date average of $13.7 million, increasing intraday volatility. Option dealer positioning has shifted from long gamma to flat to short gamma, amplifying market swings during low-liquidity periods. Risk-parity and volatility-control strategies remain elevated, with risk-parity in the 81st percentile and volatility-control in the 71st percentile over the past year, suggesting further de-risking if volatility persists. Seasonally, February is historically weak and choppy as January's supportive flows fade. Retail investors are showing fatigue, with $690 million in net selling in the last two days, signaling reduced appetite for 'buying all dips.' Crypto-linked equities have been hit hard, raising the risk of a broader rotation out of US stocks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 01:34 AM\nSource:[cnbctv18.com](https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/us-market-snp-500-goldman-sachs-traders-warn-stock-selling-isnt-over-in-choppy-market-ws-l-19845132.htm)\n\n**Stock Index Futures Rise, Gold Reclaims $5,000, Silver Surges Nearly 3% Amid Volatility and Bullish Long-Term Outlook**\nOn February 9, 2026, U.S. stock index futures rose further in the early Asian session, with the S&P 500 futures up 0.30%, Nasdaq futures up 0.41%, and Dow futures up 0.26% as of 7:52 a.m. Gold prices surged, with spot gold rising over 1% to reach $5,017 per ounce, reclaiming the $5,000 level. Spot silver jumped nearly 3% to $79.86 per ounce. The Guotou Silver LOF announced it would suspend trading from the opening of February 9, 2026, until 10:30 a.m., with potential further measures if premium levels remain elevated; it had already halted subscriptions since January 28, 2026. Silver\u2019s higher volatility compared to gold is attributed to its smaller market size and lower liquidity. Major banks and asset managers reaffirmed their long-term bullish outlook on gold, with Fidelity International\u2019s fund manager indicating readiness to re-enter and PIMCO\u2019s commodities team confirming the uptrend remains intact. JPMorgan\u2019s Jason Hunter described the recent gold price movement as a typical short-term consolidation after rapid gains, not a reversal of the long-term bull trend. Technical analysis shows signs of weakening momentum after a parabolic rise, with Hunter predicting a broad consolidation phase (\u2018holding pattern\u2019) over the coming weeks or months, where the $5,000 level and the $5,100\u2013$5,150 range will act as strong resistance. Despite near-term technical corrections, the core bullish thesis\u2014\u2018currency debasement\u2019\u2014remains valid. Hunter emphasized that the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has remained below 100, signaling long-term dollar weakness, which could reignite the bearish trend in dollar-denominated assets. Galaxy Securities expects metals to remain in a consolidation phase, urging attention to the U.S. January CPI data to assess inflation persistence and revise Fed policy expectations. In the medium to long term, the bull case for precious metals has shifted from short-term interest rate speculation to hedging against long-term dollar credit risk and global monetary system restructuring. Silver is cautioned for its susceptibility to manipulation due to low liquidity and leveraged capital risks. Industrial metals are expected to benefit from the global green transition, supporting long-term demand. Zhejiang Securities notes that while short-term risks from liquidity shocks and risk-on/off shifts may affect gold and silver, the long-term outlook favors gold over silver.

The seasonally adjusted 10-city national home price index increased by 0.4% month-over-month and 2.0% year-over-year. However, year-over-year home price growth of 1.4% lagged behind 2.7% inflation, resulting in a 1.3 percentage point real decline in home values. Chicago (+5.7%), New York (+5.0%), and Cleveland (+3.4%) led in annual gains, while Tampa (-3.9%), Phoenix (-1.4%), and Dallas (-1.4%) recorded annual declines. Thirty-year mortgage rates in the mid-6% range are constraining affordability and limiting price growth, keeping real home values flat despite nominal increases.

The seasonally adjusted National Index increased 0.37% month-over-month (MoM), marking the third consecutive month of MoM growth following five consecutive months of MoM declines.

All 20 metropolitan areas recorded month-over-month declines before seasonal adjustment, with Tampa posting the sharpest annual drop at -4.1%, marking its 11th consecutive month of negative returns. Chicago led with a 5.5% annual gain, followed by New York (5.2%) and Boston (4.1%), while Phoenix (-2.0%), Dallas (-1.3%), and Miami (-1.3%) remained in negative territory. The national index posted a -0.3% month-over-month decline before seasonal adjustment, with only a 0.2% gain after adjustment. Regional divergence was evident: Sun Belt markets, which surged during the pandemic, are now experiencing price declines, while Northeastern and Midwestern metros continue to show resilience. Nicholas Godec, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P DJI, attributed the slowdown to elevated mortgage rates near 6.3% and affordability pressures, noting that home prices are now trailing inflation by 1.7 percentage points\u2014the widest gap since June 2024.

Inflation outpaced home prices for the fourth consecutive month, with September's CPI rising 1.7 percentage points above housing appreciation\u2014the widest gap since the measures diverged in June. All 20 tracked metropolitan areas reported month-over-month declines before seasonal adjustment, indicating broad-based weakening due to elevated mortgage rates (near 6.3% in late September) undermining affordability and demand. Regional performance showed stark contrasts: Chicago led with a 5.5% annual gain, followed by New York (5.2%) and Boston (4.1%), while Tampa recorded the sharpest decline at -4.1%, its 11th consecutive month of negative annual returns. Phoenix (-2.0%), Dallas (-1.3%), and Miami (-1.3%) also remained in negative territory, highlighting ongoing weakness in Sun Belt markets that saw the largest pandemic-era surges.

After seasonal adjustment, all indices rose 0.2% month-over-month. Nineteen of 20 metropolitan areas declined month-to-month, with only Chicago posting a gain, indicating broad weakness beyond typical seasonal trends. Housing wealth continued to erode in real terms for the fourth consecutive month, as the 1.5% nominal national gain fell well short of the 3% inflation rate. New York recorded the highest annual gain at 6.1%, followed by Chicago (5.9%) and Cleveland (4.7%), while Tampa posted the lowest return at -3.3%. Nicholas Godec, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, stated, 'This marks the weakest annual gain in over two years and falls well below the 3% inflation rate.
