Public 2026 U.S. home-price forecasts  \n\n1. J.P. Morgan Chase  \n   \u2022 \u201cNational prices will be roughly flat in 2026 (0 % y/y) as 30-year rates stay above 6 % but ARM products and builder buydowns supply limited relief.\u201d (J.P. Morgan Global Research note, 27 Jan 2026).  \n\n2. Experian \u201cHome Price Expectations\u201d panel (survey of large forecasters, 4 Nov 2025).  \n   \u2022 Range for 2026:  \n     \u2013 Fannie Mae +1.3 %  \n     \u2013 National Association of Realtors +4 %  \n     \u2013 Mortgage Bankers Association -0.5 %  \n   \u2022 Median (simple) \u2248 +1.3 %.  \n\n3. Investopedia round-up (10 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 NAR +4 %, Fannie Mae +1.3 %, Zillow +1.2 %.  \n   \u2022 Commentary notes that with Fed\u2019s projected 2.6 % CPI, real (inflation-adjusted) prices would be flat to negative.  \n\n4. TradingEconomics econometric projection (page accessed Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Implied 2026 growth of +1.6 % for the national index (extrapolating from their 20-city composite forecast of 349.9 by 2027).  \n\n5. CoreLogic / Cotality (U.S. Home Price Insights, January 2026)  \n   \u2022 Cotality economists expect 2026 \u201cprice growth\u2026at the low end of the long-term 4\u20135 % average.\u201d  Language implies something in the 1\u20132 % area but stops short of quoting a single number.  Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp attributes the subdued outlook to lingering affordability constraints offset by better mortgage-rate dynamics and a seasonal pickup (Cotality article, January 2026).  \n\nConsensus picture\nAcross major sources, 2026 national price appreciation clusters in a very narrow, low-single-digit band:\n\u2022 Central tendency: 0 % to +2 %.  \n\u2022 High end (NAR) tops out at +4 %, still well below the long-term 4\u20135 % average.  \n\u2022 No mainstream forecaster is calling for a repeat of the post-pandemic double-digit gains, and none foresee a material nationwide decline.  \nThe collective view is that elevated but easing mortgage rates, thin inventory, and regional demand shifts will produce a near-stall in nominal appreciation and effectively flat to slightly negative \u201creal\u201d growth after inflation.\n\nC.  Remaining gaps / next steps  \n\n1. Goldman Sachs: no discrete 2026 national price forecast surfaced in the material reviewed.  \n2. CoreLogic/Cotality: while the January-2026 Insights release provides qualitative guidance (\u201clow end of 4\u20135 %\u201d), it does not publish an exact figure.  If an explicit numeric forecast is required, the proprietary monthly CoreLogic HPI Forecast table would need to be consulted.  \n3. The CSUSHPISA figures supplied above satisfy the original date range, but if month-ahead projections (Dec-2025 forward) are desired, separate model-based data would be required.\n\nWith those caveats, the query\u2019s data and forecast components are now fully addressed.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"CSUSHPISA\" query=\"CSUSHPISA\">\nFRED Economic Data: S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index\nSeries ID: CSUSHPISA\nUnits: Index Jan 2000=100\nFrequency: Monthly\nLatest observation: 330.45 (2025-11-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=328.11, min=325.95, max=330.45\n- 5-year: mean=301.23, min=236.55, max=330.45\n- 10-year: mean=250.74, min=176.51, max=330.45\n- All-time: mean=152.01, min=63.96, max=330.45 (since 1987-01-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +1.31 (+0.4%)\n- 3-month change: +3.44 (+1.1%)\n- 6-month change: +2.97 (+0.9%)\n- Year-over-year: 330.45 vs 325.95 (+1.4%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly):\nDate,Value\n2024-12-01,327.77\n2025-01-01,329.24\n2025-02-01,329.91\n2025-03-01,329.21\n2025-04-01,328.28\n2025-05-01,327.47\n2025-06-01,326.73\n2025-07-01,326.50\n2025-08-01,327.01\n2025-09-01,327.76\n2025-10-01,329.14\n2025-11-01,330.45\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
