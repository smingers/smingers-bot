## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence AGAINST Discontinuation:**
1. **Q4 2025 Earnings Call Discussion (Jan 28, 2026)**: Musk and Moravy discussed alternative uses for Cybertrucks (cargo delivery) and emphasized production line flexibility. This indicates strategic thinking about how to utilize existing capacity, NOT discontinuation planning. Multiple sources confirm this.

2. **Future Lineup References (Feb 9-10, 2026)**: Multiple independent Chinese sources list Cybertruck alongside Model 3/Y as Tesla's future lineup after Model S/X discontinuation. This is structural evidence of continuation.

3. **Ongoing Product Support (Feb 9, 2026)**: Tesla establishing FSD trade-in policies for Cyberbeast trim and issuing recalls for 46,096 units indicates continued product support infrastructure.

**Moderate Evidence AGAINST Discontinuation:**
1. **No February 2026 Signals**: Despite active media coverage and recent Model S/X discontinuation announcement, zero sources mention Cybertruck discontinuation plans or rumors. The absence of evidence is meaningful given the timeframe.

2. **Model S/X Precedent Timeline**: Model S/X discontinuation was announced ~5 months before implementation (announced late January, effective end Q2 2026). We're only 50 days from April 1.

**Weak Evidence FOR Discontinuation:**
1. **Poor Sales Performance**: Confirmed ~20,000 units/year vs. 125,000 capacity, but this is historical data through Q3 2025, not new information.

2. **Inventory Buildup**: "Hundreds of millions" in inventory mentioned in January earnings, but Tesla is addressing this through alternative strategies (cargo use, UAE sales), not discontinuation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 10, 2026 to April 1, 2026 = **50 days**

This is an extremely short timeframe for a major corporate decision. Key considerations:

**If timeframe were halved (25 days)**: Probability would drop to ~2-3%. Essentially impossible for Tesla to announce and implement discontinuation in under a month with no current signals.

**If timeframe were doubled (100 days, ~3.3 months)**: Probability would increase to ~12-15%. This approaches the minimum lead time suggested by Model S/X precedent and would allow for some announcement/implementation gap.

**Critical Timing Factor**: The Model S/X discontinuation provides a clear precedent - Tesla announced in late January 2026 for end of Q2 2026 implementation (5+ months notice). For Cybertruck to be discontinued by April 1, 2026, we would need an announcement essentially immediately (within days), yet no sources from February 1-10 suggest this is happening.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate**: 8%

**Factors Warranting DOWNWARD Adjustment:**

1. **Positive Strategic Discussion (Strong Evidence)**: The January 28 earnings call discussion about alternative Cybertruck uses is fundamentally incompatible with imminent discontinuation. When companies plan to discontinue products, they don't brainstorm new use cases. This is a structural factor suggesting continuation. **Adjustment: -3%**

2. **Future Lineup Integration (Strong Evidence)**: Multiple February 2026 sources explicitly list Cybertruck in Tesla's post-Model S/X lineup. This isn't speculation - it's how Tesla is positioning the product publicly. **Adjustment: -2%**

3. **Ongoing Product Infrastructure (Moderate Evidence)**: New FSD policies for Cyberbeast and active recall management indicate Tesla is investing in long-term Cybertruck support, not winding down. **Adjustment: -1%**

4. **Complete Absence of Signals (Moderate Evidence)**: With Model S/X discontinuation fresh in news cycle, media would be hypersensitive to any Cybertruck discontinuation hints. The silence is deafening. **Adjustment: -1%**

**Factors Warranting UPWARD Adjustment:**
None. The current information provides no new evidence favoring discontinuation beyond what was already incorporated in the outside view.

**Net Adjustment**: -7% from base rate of 8% = **1%**

However, this seems too extreme. Let me recalibrate:

The outside view already incorporated poor sales performance and Model S/X precedent. The new information doesn't contradict those factors but adds strong evidence of continuation (earnings call discussion, future lineup positioning, ongoing support). The 50-day timeframe combined with zero February signals makes discontinuation extremely unlikely but not impossible (Tesla could theoretically make a sudden announcement).

**Recalibrated Inside View**: 3%

This represents a significant downward shift from the 8% outside view, justified by:
- Strong evidence of strategic continuation planning (earnings call)
- Structural evidence of product positioning (future lineup)
- Complete absence of discontinuation signals in critical February window
- Extremely short timeframe incompatible with Tesla's demonstrated announcement patterns

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view of 8%, the current information provides multiple independent sources of strong evidence against discontinuation:

1. **Earnings call strategic discussion** (Jan 28): Companies don't brainstorm alternative uses for products they're about to discontinue
2. **Future lineup positioning** (Feb 9-10): Multiple sources list Cybertruck as continuing product
3. **Ongoing support infrastructure** (Feb 9): New policies and recalls indicate long-term commitment
4. **Zero discontinuation signals** (Feb 1-10): Despite active coverage, no hints of discontinuation

These factors are not merely weak indicators but structural evidence suggesting continuation. The 50-day timeframe makes sudden discontinuation logistically challenging and inconsistent with Tesla's Model S/X precedent (5+ months notice).

However, I must avoid overconfidence. Tesla could theoretically make a surprise announcement, and Musk has made impulsive decisions before. The poor sales performance remains a real concern.

**Final calibration**: The evidence warrants a significant downward adjustment but not to near-zero. I'll settle on **3%** as my inside view prediction.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Tesla stop selling new Cybertrucks to US retail customers (via website removal or announcement) before April 1, 2026? (50 days)
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria focusing on retail sales discontinuation, not production pauses

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 8% based on automotive discontinuation patterns, Tesla's historical behavior, and short timeframe
   - ✓ Final prediction (3%) is rooted in this base rate with justified downward adjustment based on strong contrary evidence

3. **Consistency check**: "3 out of 100 times, Tesla discontinues Cybertruck retail sales before April 1, 2026"
   - ✓ This makes sense - highly unlikely but not impossible given Musk's unpredictability and poor sales performance

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Jan 28 earnings call discussed alternative Cybertruck uses (cargo delivery) - indicates continuation planning
   - Multiple Feb 9-10 sources list Cybertruck in Tesla's future lineup post-Model S/X - structural positioning as continuing product
   - Zero discontinuation signals in February 2026 despite active media coverage - absence of evidence is meaningful in 50-day window
   - Model S/X got 5+ months notice; Cybertruck would need announcement within days - timeline incompatible
   - ✓ All verified through multiple independent sources

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Elon Musk makes impulsive decision to discontinue Cybertruck immediately due to ego/frustration, announcing it suddenly on Twitter/X without traditional corporate process. This could happen but would be unprecedented even for Musk. Would shift probability to ~8-10%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is Cybertruck continues production at low volumes with ongoing inventory management. Given 50-day timeframe and current evidence, strong bias toward status quo continuation is appropriate. Current 3% already reflects this.

Probability: 3%
