**Elektrek (September 13, 2025):**
- **Quality**: Established EV news outlet, author Fred Lambert is known industry commentator
- **Key Facts**: RWD Cybertruck discontinued after 5 months (launched April 2025), sales rate ~20,000 units/year
- **Opinions**: Lambert calls Cybertruck "a commercial flop" - this is editorial opinion
- **Assessment**: Factual information reliable; opinions represent informed commentary but not predictive certainty

**InsideEVs (September 14, 2025):**
- **Quality**: Major automotive publication
- **Key Facts**: RWD discontinued after 5 months, Q2 2025 deliveries of "Other Models" (Cybertruck + Model S/X) dropped 66% to 10,394 units
- **Opinions**: Speculation about Tesla's strategy
- **Assessment**: Good for historical facts; speculation is clearly marked

**Road & Track (March 14, 2025):**
- **Quality**: Established automotive publication
- **Key Facts**: Body panel issues with "cantrail" component, delivery delays for inspections, 4 NHTSA complaints
- **Assessment**: Documents quality issues but no indication these would lead to discontinuation

**ArenaEV.com (May 13, 2025):**
- **Quality**: Lesser-known EV publication
- **Key Facts**: Production pauses in May 2025, Q1 2025 sales of 6,406 units, FY 2024 sales of 38,965 units
- **Assessment**: Useful sales data; production pauses indicate demand management but not discontinuation

**Electrek (January 28, 2026):**
- **Quality**: Same outlet as earlier, highly relevant as most recent source
- **Key Facts**: Model S/X discontinued effective Q2 2026 due to low sales (~30,000 units in 2025 vs. 100,000 capacity). "Other Models" deliveries for FY 2025: 50,850 units total
- **Critical Context**: This establishes Tesla's willingness to discontinue underperforming models
- **Opinions**: Author asks "Is Cybertruck next?" - pure speculation
- **Assessment**: Highly relevant precedent; shows Tesla will discontinue low-volume products

**Agent Report (SEC Filings & Q4 2025 Earnings):**
- **Quality**: Direct from official sources
- **Key Facts**: Q4 2025 earnings call (Jan 28, 2026) contained minimal Cybertruck guidance; focus was on autonomy, Robotaxi, and Optimus. Model S/X discontinued.
- **Critical Gap**: No February 2026 statements about Cybertruck found
- **Assessment**: The absence of Cybertruck discussion in earnings call is notable but not definitive

**Historical Articles (2022):**
- Multiple sources document Tesla's history of removing production timelines from website without discontinuing products
- **Assessment**: Shows Tesla's pattern of delaying but not canceling products

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Tesla vehicle discontinuations**: Model S/X just discontinued (Jan 2026) after years of declining sales. However, these were 10+ year old models with established alternatives in Tesla's lineup.

2. **New Tesla vehicle launches with poor initial sales**: Model X had production challenges but wasn't discontinued. However, it eventually found stable demand.

3. **Automotive industry "flop" vehicles**: Many automakers continue producing low-volume vehicles for years (e.g., Honda Ridgeline sold 30,000-50,000 units/year for over a decade). However, Cybertruck's $1.1B production line investment and massive inventory create different economics.

4. **Tesla's historical product decisions**: Tesla has delayed products extensively (Roadster 2.0, Semi) but rarely outright cancels announced vehicles. The company tends to let products languish rather than formally discontinue them.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Tesla's recent Model S/X discontinuation combined with automotive industry patterns for underperforming vehicles with high fixed costs.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 10, 2026 to April 1, 2026 = 50 days (1.7 months)

**Recent Timeline:**
- September 2025: RWD variant discontinued
- October 2025: Sales declining, massive inventory buildup
- January 28, 2026: Model S/X discontinued, minimal Cybertruck discussion in earnings
- February 10, 2026: Current date - no new announcements found

**Historical Patterns:**
- Model S/X discontinuation was announced with ~5 months notice (announced Jan 2026, effective end of Q2 2026)
- Tesla typically doesn't make abrupt discontinuation announcements
- The company has shown willingness to let underperforming products continue (Model S/X continued for years at low volumes before discontinuation)

## (d) Justification

**Factors Favoring Discontinuation (Yes outcome):**
1. **Severe sales underperformance**: ~20,000 units/year vs. 125,000-250,000 capacity; even worse than Model S/X proportionally
2. **Massive inventory**: $800M+ in unsold units as of October 2025
3. **Recent precedent**: Tesla just discontinued Model S/X in January 2026, showing willingness to cut underperformers
4. **Economics**: At current sales rates, Cybertruck may never recoup its $1.1B production line investment
5. **Declining trajectory**: Sales dropped from 6,406 (Q1 2025) to 5,385 (Q3 2025)
6. **Product simplification**: Already discontinued RWD variant; further consolidation possible

**Factors Against Discontinuation (No outcome):**
1. **Short timeframe**: Only 50 days; Model S/X got 5 months notice
2. **Brand/ego considerations**: Cybertruck is Elon Musk's pet project; discontinuation would be major embarrassment
3. **Recent investment**: $1.1B production line is new; immediate write-off would be costly
4. **No February 2026 signals**: Agent report found no statements suggesting imminent discontinuation
5. **Tesla's pattern**: Company tends to let products languish rather than formally discontinue them quickly
6. **Sunk cost**: Unlike Model S/X (old models being replaced), Cybertruck has no replacement planned
7. **Potential for recovery**: Could adjust pricing, features, or marketing rather than discontinue

**Critical Assessment:**
The Model S/X discontinuation is the most relevant data point. However, key differences exist:
- Model S/X were 10+ years old; Cybertruck is brand new
- Model S/X discontinuation was announced 5 months in advance; we have 50 days
- Cybertruck represents newer investment and higher ego stakes for Musk

The absence of any February 2026 statements about Cybertruck is significant. If discontinuation were planned for before April 1, we would expect some signal by now.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Base rate for automotive discontinuations within 18 months of launch: Very low (<5% historically)
- Base rate for Tesla discontinuing new products within 2 years: Essentially 0% (has never happened)
- However, Cybertruck's commercial performance is historically poor even by "flop" standards

**Probability calibration:**
- If this were a mature product (like Model S/X), probability might be 30-40% given sales trajectory
- The 50-day timeframe dramatically reduces probability - major corporate decisions typically have longer lead times
- Tesla's historical pattern is delay/de-emphasize, not discontinue
- The Model S/X precedent suggests 5+ months notice, which we don't have
- No leaks, rumors, or signals in February 2026 despite active media coverage

**Upset rate consideration:**
In automotive industry, unexpected discontinuations do occur but usually with some advance warning (dealer communications, production line changes, etc.). The complete absence of February 2026 signals is strong evidence against imminent discontinuation.

**Calibration:**
- Baseline for any major corporate announcement in 50-day window: ~10-15%
- Adjusted down for Tesla's historical pattern of delays over cancellations: -5%
- Adjusted down for lack of any February signals: -3%
- Adjusted up slightly for unprecedented poor performance: +2%
- Adjusted up for Model S/X precedent showing willingness: +2%

This yields approximately 6-11% probability range.
