Opinion: Various outlets call it "commercial flop." Quality: High for RWD discontinuation, moderate for sales estimates. Relevance: Shows Tesla willing to cut unprofitable variants but continuing the model line.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Model S/X discontinuation announced but Cybertruck not mentioned** (Q4 2025 earnings call, multiple independent confirmations): If Tesla were planning to discontinue Cybertruck before April 1, this would have been the natural time to announce it. Musk explicitly discussed winding down S/X but made no such statement about Cybertruck.
- **Recent NHTSA recall (Feb 9, 2026)**: Regulatory recalls for current model years suggest ongoing production and support commitments.
- **Active marketing with new packages** (Feb 9, 2026): FSD transfer rules updated specifically for Cybertruck Luxe Package, indicating continued sales focus.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Cybercab production starting April 2026**: Tesla committing Texas Gigafactory capacity to new Cybercab production could theoretically squeeze Cybertruck, but no evidence this is planned.
- **Inventory problems acknowledged** (Jan 28, 2026 earnings call): Musk discussing alternative uses for unsold units suggests oversupply, but also shows Tesla seeking solutions other than discontinuation.
- **RWD variant discontinued Sept 2025**: Shows Tesla willing to rationalize unprofitable variants, but this was a trim-level cut, not full discontinuation.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **TorqueNews speculation (Oct 28, 2025)**: Opinion piece predicting cancellation "soon" but no insider sources or concrete evidence.
- **Sales weakness (~20k/year vs 250k capacity)**: While concerning, Tesla has historically maintained low-volume models (Model S/X sold ~50k combined in recent years before discontinuation announcement).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 50 days (Feb 10 → April 1, 2026)

This is an extremely compressed timeframe for a major product discontinuation:
- Model S/X received ~5 months notice (late Jan → end Q2 2026)
- Industry standard is 1-2 quarters minimum for supplier wind-down
- No leaks, rumors, or supplier reports of impending Cybertruck discontinuation

**If timeframe were halved (25 days)**: Probability would drop to ~1-2% - essentially impossible for proper announcement and wind-down.

**If timeframe were doubled (100 days)**: Probability might rise to ~8-10% - more realistic window for announcement and execution, though still unlikely given current evidence.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 4.5%**

**Factors supporting lower probability:**

1. **Recent strategic clarity without Cybertruck mention** (Strong): The Q4 2025 earnings call was Tesla's opportunity to announce all major product changes. Musk explicitly discussed ending Model S/X but said nothing about Cybertruck. This is powerful negative evidence - if discontinuation were planned for <2 months away, disclosure would be required.

2. **Active product support and marketing** (Moderate): February 2026 updates to FSD packages, ongoing recalls, and inclusion in current lineup all signal continued commitment.

3. **Alternative strategies being explored** (Moderate): Rather than discontinuation, Tesla is exploring cargo delivery uses and international expansion (UAE), suggesting management sees paths forward.

4. **Insufficient time for proper wind-down** (Strong): 50 days is inadequate for supplier contracts, regulatory filings, and customer notifications that major discontinuations require.

**Factors supporting higher probability:**

1. **Severe inventory overhang** (Moderate): "Hundreds of millions" in unsold inventory is concerning, though not unprecedented for Tesla.

2. **Musk's unpredictability** (Weak): While Musk can make sudden decisions, even he follows basic corporate governance for major announcements.

3. **Sales far below capacity** (Moderate): 20k/year vs 250k capacity is poor utilization, though Tesla tolerated similar ratios with S/X for years.

**Net adjustment**: The strong negative evidence (no mention in recent earnings call, active marketing, insufficient time) outweighs the moderate positive evidence (inventory, sales weakness). The outside view already accounts for some probability of sudden discontinuation; current evidence suggests this case is less likely than the reference class average.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view: 4.5%

Adjustments:
- **Strong negative evidence from Q4 earnings call**: -1.5 percentage points
- **Active product support and insufficient timeframe**: -1.0 percentage points  
- **Inventory concerns and sales weakness**: +0.5 percentage points

**Calibrated inside view: 2.5%**

This represents roughly 1-in-40 odds. The primary scenario for YES would be an emergency board decision triggered by unforeseen financial crisis or regulatory action, announced with minimal notice. While Musk is unpredictable, even Tesla follows basic corporate governance requiring advance notice for major product discontinuations.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Tesla stop selling new Cybertrucks to U.S. retail customers (via website removal or official announcement) before April 1, 2026?
   ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria focusing on retail sales discontinuation, not production pauses or variant changes.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 4.5% based on reference class of U.S. vehicles discontinued within 2 years, adjusted for timeframe.
   ✓ Final prediction (2.5%) remains anchored to this base rate with justified downward adjustment based on strong contrary evidence.

3. **Consistency check**: "2.5 out of 100 times, Tesla discontinues Cybertruck retail sales before April 1, 2026."
   ✓ This aligns with my justification: extremely unlikely but not impossible given Musk's unpredictability and severe sales underperformance.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Q4 2025 earnings call ended Model S/X but made no mention of Cybertruck discontinuation (factually verified, strong negative evidence)
   - Only 50 days remain, insufficient for standard discontinuation procedures (factually verified, strong structural constraint)
   - Active FSD package updates and NHTSA recalls in Feb 2026 indicate ongoing product support (factually verified, moderate negative evidence)
   ✓ All three pieces are factually solid and support low probability.

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Emergency financial crisis or major safety issue forces immediate halt. If Tesla faces sudden liquidity crisis or discovers critical safety defect requiring full production stop, they might pull the product with minimal notice. This could raise probability to ~15-20%, but no current evidence suggests this scenario.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Cybertruck continues as low-volume product through April 1, 2026.
   ✓ Given slow-changing nature of automotive product cycles and strong institutional barriers to rapid discontinuation, status quo is heavily favored. Current volatility (inventory issues, sales weakness) is concerning but not unprecedented for Tesla.
