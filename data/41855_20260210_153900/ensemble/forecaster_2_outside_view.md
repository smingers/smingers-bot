Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (October 2025 - January 2026):**

1. **TorqueNews (Oct 28, 2025)**: Industry publication reporting on Cybertruck sales decline. Key facts: Q3 2025 sales of 5,385 units (down 63% YoY), current run-rate ~20,000 units/year vs. 125,000 capacity, ~$800M inventory. Author Chris Johnston provides opinion that situation is "dire" and production curtailment likely. Quality: Mid-tier automotive news site; mixes facts with speculation about SpaceX/xAI purchases.

2. **Elektrek (Sep 13, 2025)**: EV-focused publication reporting RWD model discontinuation after 5 months. Key fact: ~20,000 units/year sales rate vs. 250,000-500,000 projections. Author Fred Lambert opines it's "a commercial flop." Quality: Reputable EV news source; Lambert is identifiable industry journalist.

3. **InsideEVs (Sep 14, 2025)**: Confirms RWD discontinuation; reports Q2 2025 "Other Models" deliveries at 10,394 units (66% drop, includes Model S/X/Cybertruck combined). Quality: Established automotive publication with verifiable statistics.

4. **Road & Track (Mar 14, 2025)**: Reports delivery holds for body panel inspections; no formal recall announced. Quality: Reputable automotive journalism; relies on owner reports and NHTSA complaints.

5. **ArenaEV (May 13, 2025)**: Reports production pauses at Austin factory; Q1 2025 Cybertruck sales of 6,406 units vs. 38,965 in full-year 2024. Cites Cox Automotive data. Quality: Lesser-known source but cites reputable data provider.

6. **Elektrek (Jan 28, 2026)**: Reports Model S/X discontinuation announced during Q4 2025 earnings call; production line to be replaced by Optimus robot manufacturing. "Other Models" Q4 2025 deliveries: 11,642 units. Author asks "Is Cybertruck next?" Quality: Same reputable source; contains verifiable earnings call information.

**Historical Context Sources (2021-2022):**
These document earlier delays and removed timing/pricing information from Tesla's website. Limited relevance except to establish pattern of missed targets.

**Agent Report (Feb 2026):**
Confirms Q4 2025 earnings call (Jan 28, 2026) contained minimal Cybertruck guidance; management focused on autonomy/Robotaxi/Optimus. Notes absence of February 2026 statements about Cybertruck. Quality: High for what it confirms (absence of information); identifies information gaps appropriately.

**Key Factual Data Points:**
- 2024 full-year sales: 38,965 units
- Q1 2025: 6,406 units
- Q2 2025: ~4,000-4,500 units (estimated from "Other Models" minus S/X)
- Q3 2025: 5,385 units (Cox Automotive)
- Current run-rate: ~20,000 units/year vs. 125,000-250,000 capacity
- RWD model discontinued September 2025
- Model S/X discontinued January 2026
- Production pauses reported May 2025

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Tesla vehicle discontinuations**: Model S/X just discontinued (Jan 2026) after years of declining sales below capacity. Relevant because it shows Tesla's willingness to cut underperforming models, but S/X had 10+ year runs.

2. **Failed specialty truck launches**: Examples like Honda Ridgeline (survived but niche), Hummer EV (limited production). Less relevant - these weren't discontinued quickly.

3. **Tesla production ramps that failed to meet targets**: Original Roadster, Model X delays. Not directly relevant - these eventually succeeded.

4. **Automotive "flops" discontinued within 2-3 years**: Pontiac Aztek (6 years), Chevy SSR (4 years), Plymouth Prowler (6 years). Relevant but most lasted longer than Cybertruck's current 1.5 years of production.

5. **Recent EV discontinuations**: Lordstown Endurance (company bankruptcy), Fisker Ocean (company bankruptcy), various compliance EVs. Most relevant for timeline but involve company failures, not selective product cuts.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Tesla's own product discontinuation decisions, specifically the Model S/X precedent combined with specialty vehicle discontinuations in the broader auto industry. This captures both Tesla's decision-making patterns and market dynamics for niche vehicles.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 10, 2026 to April 1, 2026 = **50 days** (7.1 weeks)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Cybertruck production began late 2023
- First deliveries November 2023
- RWD model launched April 2025, discontinued September 2025 (5 months)
- Model S/X discontinuation announced Jan 28, 2026, effective end of Q2 2026 (~5 months notice)
- Production pauses occurred May 2025 (week-long breaks)

**Key Observations:**
- Tesla gave ~5 months notice for Model S/X discontinuation
- Sales trajectory shows accelerating decline (Q1→Q2→Q3 2025)
- No February 2026 statements about Cybertruck despite being 10 days into the month
- Inventory estimated at $800M (Oct 2025) with declining sales
- Production capacity vastly exceeds demand (125,000 vs. 20,000 run-rate)

## (d) Justification

**Arguments for Discontinuation (Before April 1, 2026):**

1. **Precedent**: Tesla just discontinued Model S/X (Jan 28, 2026) for similar reasons - low volume relative to capacity, need for factory space
2. **Extreme underperformance**: 20,000 annual run-rate vs. 125,000+ capacity (16% utilization)
3. **Accelerating decline**: Q3 2025 down 63% YoY; each quarter worse than previous
4. **Already trimmed lineup**: RWD discontinued Sep 2025, showing willingness to cut
5. **Massive inventory**: ~$800M sitting unsold as of Oct 2025
6. **Factory space value**: Austin facility could be repurposed (like Fremont for Optimus)
7. **Management silence**: No Cybertruck guidance in Q4 earnings; no Feb 2026 statements despite being topical

**Arguments Against Discontinuation (Before April 1, 2026):**

1. **Timeframe too short**: Only 50 days; Model S/X got 5 months notice
2. **Sunk costs**: ~$1.1B production line investment; only ~70,000 units sold (not break-even)
3. **Brand damage**: Cybertruck is high-profile; quick discontinuation would be embarrassing
4. **Still selling**: 20,000 units/year is low but not zero; generates some revenue
5. **No smoking gun**: No leaked memos, supplier notifications, or insider reports of imminent discontinuation
6. **Recent design work**: Cybercab derivative mentioned in earnings suggests ongoing platform investment
7. **Tesla's pattern**: Usually gives advance notice (see Model S/X)

**Critical Assessment:**

The 50-day window is extremely short. Even with dire sales, Tesla typically provides advance notice to manage customer expectations, dealer inventory (though Tesla is direct-to-consumer), and supplier relationships. The Model S/X precedent (announced Jan 28, effective end of Q2) suggests a 4-5 month timeline.

However, three factors could accelerate a decision:
1. Cybertruck's situation is more acute than Model S/X (worse capacity utilization)
2. The question allows for announcement of discontinuation, not just implementation
3. If a decision has already been made internally, announcement could come anytime

The absence of any February 2026 statements is notable but not definitive - we're only 10 days into the month.

## Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**

1. **Base rate for auto discontinuations within 50 days**: Extremely rare without bankruptcy or safety crisis. Most planned discontinuations get 3-12 months notice. Estimate: <5% for typical manufacturer.

2. **Tesla-specific adjustment**: Tesla moves faster than traditional OEMs and just discontinued Model S/X. However, even that got 5 months notice. Adjustment: +3-5 percentage points.

3. **Severity adjustment**: Cybertruck's situation is more dire than Model S/X (worse utilization, higher inventory, steeper decline). Adjustment: +5-7 percentage points.

4. **Timeframe constraint**: 50 days is very short. Even if discontinuation is planned, announcement within this window requires either (a) decision already made or (b) crisis forcing immediate action. Adjustment: -5 percentage points.

5. **Information absence**: No leaks, supplier reports, or insider information suggesting imminent announcement. In today's connected world, major corporate decisions usually leak. Adjustment: -3 percentage points.

**Probability reasoning:**

- Baseline for any auto model discontinuation in 50-day window: ~2-3%
- Tesla's demonstrated willingness to cut (Model S/X): +4%
- Cybertruck's dire metrics: +6%
- Short timeframe constraint: -4%
- No evidence of imminent decision: -3%

**Net estimate: ~5-8%**

However, I should consider:
- The question specifically asks about discontinuation "before April 1, 2026"
- We have strong evidence of severe underperformance
- Tesla has shown willingness to act (Model S/X, RWD discontinuation)
- But 50 days is genuinely very short for such a decision

**Calibration check**: 
- At 5%, I'm saying 1-in-20 chance - this feels roughly appropriate given the short timeframe but serious underlying issues
- At 10%, I'm saying 1-in-10 chance - this seems too high given complete absence of signals
- At 3%, I'm saying 1-in-33 chance - this seems too low given the severity of the situation

The Model S/X discontinuation is a strong signal that Tesla is willing to cut underperforming products, but the 5-month notice period suggests they don't do it precipitously. The most likely scenario is that Cybertruck will be discontinued, but not within the next 50 days.
