Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria paraphrase (for alignment)**
Resolves **Yes** if **before Apr 1, 2026** Tesla **discontinues retail sales of the Cybertruck in the US**, i.e., (1) removes US ordering from Tesla’s Cybertruck webpage **with no credible intent to restore**, or (2) **announces** it will no longer be produced for or sold new to US retail customers effective before that date.

## (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinion)

1) **Drive Tesla (Feb 9, 2026)** – *mid-tier Tesla-focused site; timely.*
- **Facts:** Tesla updated **FSD transfer** deadline rules; clarifies **Luxe Package** restrictions; explicitly references **Cyberbeast** trade-in/FSD treatment.
- **Opinion/speculation:** Author suggests FSD transfer programs tend to recur.
- **Relevance:** Indirectly suggests Cybertruck (at least Cyberbeast trim) remains an active product in Tesla policy/comms.

2) **The Cool Down (Feb 8, 2026)** – *secondary consumer news; some risk of simplification.*
- **Facts (as reported):** Musk announced winding down **Model S/X** next quarter; Fremont shift to Optimus.
- **Relevance:** Shows Tesla willingness to discontinue models; but not direct Cybertruck evidence. (Also: not a primary transcript—less weight than an earnings-call transcript.)

3) **Electrek (Jan 29, 2026)** – *reputable EV news, but often pointed commentary.*
- **Facts:** Earnings-call discussion; mentions inventory build-up; Tesla exploring alternative uses for unsold Cybertrucks; notes UAE sales; SpaceX purchases.
- **Opinion:** Strong editorial stance that Cybertruck cargo idea “won’t work.”
- **Relevance:** Moderately relevant—signals demand/inventory stress, but not a discontinuation decision.

4) **InsideEVs price breakdown (date not explicitly stated here; “2025” context)** – *reputable; but not a discontinuation-focused piece.*
- **Facts:** Lists Cybertruck as part of lineup and provides pricing.
- **Relevance:** Weak/dated for Feb 2026 decision-making; still mildly suggests ongoing sales.

5) **The Guardian (Dec 17, 2025)** – *high-quality outlet; regulatory story.*
- **Facts:** CA DMV threatened/stayed license suspension regarding FSD marketing.
- **Relevance:** Indirect; could affect sales broadly, but doesn’t target Cybertruck specifically.

6) **Electrek / Reuters-tariff-related article (Apr 2025)** – *older; limited relevance.*
- **Facts:** Tariff disruptions discussed for other Tesla programs.
- **Relevance:** Not Cybertruck-specific.

7) **AskNews: Chinese-language roundups (Feb 6–10, 2026)** – *mixed; often compilations; cross-check needed.*
- **Key factual nugget repeated:** **NHTSA recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks** due to loose side panels. (Plausible, but since these are secondary roundups, I treat as **moderate** unless independently confirmed.)
- **Cybercab mass production claims:** Mostly about Cybercab; not directly about Cybertruck discontinuation.

8) **Asianet News Network (Feb 9, 2026)** – *lower-tier business news aggregator; still may relay real quotes.*
- **Facts (as reported):** Musk ending Model S/X; and importantly: “future lineup will focus on Model 3, Model Y, and **Cybertruck**.”
- **Relevance:** If accurate, this is **meaningful counter-evidence** to an imminent Cybertruck discontinuation. But because it’s not a primary source, I weight it **moderate** not strong.

9) **Benzinga / Benzinga Japan (Feb 9, 2026)** – *financial news; generally reliable on company policy updates.*
- **Facts:** Tesla updated FSD transfer terms and trade-in appraisal rules; explicitly includes **Cyberbeast** with Luxe Package.
- **Relevance:** Stronger than most for “Tesla is still actively managing Cybertruck sales/trade-in policy as of Feb 9, 2026,” which is **counter** to a near-term discontinuation.

10) **Sep 2025 “cheapest Cybertruck discontinued” coverage (Electrek/InsideEVs + many reposts)** – *older but solid; event already happened.*
- **Facts:** Tesla removed RWD Cybertruck from ordering after ~5 months.
- **Relevance:** Shows Tesla will prune trims and that demand is weak; but it is not the same as ending all US retail sales.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence**
- **Very short remaining window (50 days)**: For a high-profile product discontinuation meeting these criteria, this is a structural/time constraint that strongly depresses probability (unless decision is already made and imminent).
- **Recent Tesla policy/comms referencing Cyberbeast (Benzinga + Drive Tesla, Feb 9, 2026)**: Ongoing program rules and trade-in valuation logic explicitly involving Cybertruck trims suggests the product is still actively sold/managed **right now**.

**Moderate evidence**
- **Reported statement that Tesla’s lineup focus includes Model 3/Y/Cybertruck (Asianet, Feb 9, 2026)**: If accurate, it points away from discontinuation before April 1. Moderated due to being a secondary write-up.
- **Inventory/demand stress narrative (Electrek Jan 2026 + 2025 sales run-rate claims)**: Fits a mechanism for eventual discontinuation, but doesn’t pin timing inside this 50-day window.
- **Recall reports (~46k vehicles)**: Could cut demand and create reputational drag, but recalls usually lead to fixes rather than discontinuation; also the recall itself implies an installed base Tesla is supporting.

**Weak evidence**
- **TorqueNews “cancel soon” (Oct 2025)**: Largely prognostic/opinion; helpful for “pressure exists,” not for timing inside Feb–Mar 2026.
- **General Tesla pivot to autonomy/Optimus + CA DMV FSD dispute**: Relevant to corporate priorities, but ambiguous for Cybertruck-specific discontinuation before April 1.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** Feb 10, 2026  
- **Resolution cutoff:** Apr 1, 2026  
- **Time left:** ~**50 days**.

**If timeframe were halved (~25 days):** probability would drop meaningfully because discontinuations (as defined) usually come with some lead time or at least clear pre-signals; I’d expect ~**2–3%**.

**If timeframe were doubled (~100 days, to ~May 21, 2026):** probability rises because Tesla could decide post-quarter-end or after further sales weakness; I’d expect something like **8–15%** (still not huge, but materially higher).

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
**Outside-view base rate:** 6.5% for discontinuation (as defined) before Apr 1, 2026.

What changed versus that outside view:
1) **Fresh counter-evidence of ongoing Cybertruck commercial operations (Feb 9, 2026)**  
   Tesla is actively updating **sales-adjacent policies** (FSD transfer eligibility and trade-in valuation) that specifically reference **Cyberbeast / Cybertruck**. If Tesla were about to remove ordering or announce end-of-sales within ~7 weeks, I’d expect either (a) silence and minimal new Cybertruck-specific commercial policy, or (b) clearer “end of line” messaging. This is not definitive, but it’s a real “near-term continuity” signal.

2) **Reported strategic framing: “lineup will focus on Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck”**  
   If that reporting is directionally correct, it directly contradicts a near-term discontinuation. I discount it some due to source tier, but it still nudges probability down.

3) **Status quo inertia dominates in a 50-day window**  
   The default is that ordering remains available on Tesla.com through March, even if production is throttled. The resolution criteria are about **retail ordering availability or an explicit discontinuation announcement**, not “low production” or “weak sales.” Tesla can (and often does) respond to weak demand with pricing, incentives, exports, or production pauses without meeting the discontinuation criteria.

Net effect: These inside-view signals make the outside-view reference class (“rare for a model to be fully discontinued on a 50-day horizon”) **more** applicable, not less. So I adjust **down** from 6.5%.

Probability calibration
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** Tesla continues selling Cybertruck (likely low volume) through end of March; no formal discontinuation announcement. This points to **No**.
- **Main “Yes” pathways (before Apr 1, 2026):**
  1) Abrupt decision to pull US ordering due to overwhelming inventory/financial optics, with credible reporting it won’t return.
  2) A major safety/regulatory event leading Tesla to stop offering it for sale (unlikely within the window).
  3) A strategic pivot where Austin capacity is urgently reallocated and Tesla chooses to publicly end retail sales quickly.
- **Main “No” pathways:** continue sales but trim variants, discount, export, or slow production—none of which satisfy criteria.

Given the short window and the Feb 9 “still actively managed as a product” signals, my inside-view probability is:

Checklist:
1. **Criteria paraphrase:** Yes if Tesla removes US ordering with no intent to restore, or announces Cybertruck ends for US retail, **before Apr 1, 2026**.
2. **Outside view base rate:** 6.5%.
3. **Consistency check:** “In **4** out of 100 similar worlds, Tesla discontinues US retail Cybertruck sales (as defined) before Apr 1, 2026.” Plausible.
4. **Top evidence (≤20 words each):**
   - Only ~50 days left; discontinuations meeting criteria are rare on that horizon.
   - Feb 9 Tesla policy updates explicitly reference Cyberbeast/Cybertruck trade-in and FSD transfer rules.
   - Reporting suggests Tesla’s near-term lineup focus includes Cybertruck, inconsistent with imminent discontinuation.
   - Weak sales/inventory pressure exists, but doesn’t compel action before Apr 1.
5. **Blind spot (most likely to make me look silly):** Tesla quietly removes Cybertruck ordering mid-March as a “temporary” change that credible sources deem permanent.
6. **Status quo outcome:** Ordering remains live; Tesla manages via incentives/exports/production throttling → **No**.

Probability: 4%
