Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, and what’s factual vs opinion)

1) **TorqueNews (Oct 28, 2025) – “Why Tesla Will Cancel Cybertruck Production Soon”**  
- **What it says (facts cited):** Mentions estimates of Cybertruck shipments (e.g., ~46k first year; ~16.8k H1 2025; Q3 2025 ~5,385 via Cox), production capacity figures, inventory claims (10k+ units), and depreciation anecdotes.  
- **What it says (opinions/speculation):** Strongly framed as “dire” and leans into “will cancel soon,” plus speculative claims about SpaceX/xAI soaking up demand; also uses social-media complaints.  
- **Source quality:** Mixed. TorqueNews is not a primary financial/regulatory source; it aggregates and editorializes. Some data points cite credible estimators (e.g., Cox), but many claims (inventory magnitude, internal demand actions) are not substantiated with primary documentation.

2) **Electrek (Sep 13, 2025) – “Tesla discontinues cheapest Cybertruck”**  
- **What it says (facts):** Tesla removed the RWD/cheapest Cybertruck variant from the configurator after a short time. That’s an observable, timestampable event.  
- **What it says (opinions):** “Commercial flop,” “no one wanted it,” and broader conclusions about failure are editorial judgments.  
- **Source quality:** Medium. Electrek is a major EV-news outlet, but it can be sharply opinionated. The configurator change is likely reliable; sales-rate claims (e.g., “~20k/year”) are more inference/estimation than audited reporting.

3) **InsideEVs (Sep 14, 2025) – “The Cheapest Tesla Cybertruck Is Dead”**  
- **What it says (facts):** Confirms the RWD trim removal and details feature differences and pricing; cites “Other Models” delivery trend (Cybertruck+S+X combined) as reported by Tesla.  
- **What it says (opinions):** Interprets the strategic reason for trimming variants; speculates about brand/politics effects.  
- **Source quality:** Medium-to-good for product/configurator changes and for correctly quoting Tesla’s aggregated delivery categories, but still not a primary source on Cybertruck-only volumes.

4) **Teslarati / Mashable (Jan 2022) and InsideEVs (older “Europe ordering removed”)**  
- **Relevance:** Mostly about *pre-launch* timing and order-page wording changes, and non-US ordering availability.  
- **Source quality:** Not very relevant to the 2026 discontinuation question; also far outside the decision window. Useful mainly as background that Tesla sometimes changes web ordering text/availability without formal press releases.

5) **Road & Track (Mar 14, 2025) – delivery holds amid bodywork concerns**  
- **What it says (facts):** Reports owner claims and NHTSA complaints around body panel issues; notes Tesla hadn’t announced a formal stop sale/recall at that time.  
- **Quality:** Medium. It’s real journalism, but much of the “halt” narrative depends on anecdotal owner/service-advisor reports, not an official stop-sale notice.

6) **ArenaEV (May 13, 2025) – production pauses at Austin**  
- **What it says (facts):** Reports alleged worker schedule changes and cites Cox estimates of Cybertruck sales by quarter/year.  
- **Quality:** Medium-low to medium. The employee anecdotes are hard to verify; the Cox data is more credible. Still, it supports the *general* notion of demand softness rather than proving imminent discontinuation.

7) **Electrek (Jan 28, 2026) – Model S/X discontinuation announced for end of Q2 2026**  
- **What it says (facts):** Claims Musk announced S/X discontinuation by end of Q2 2026; ties it to repurposing Fremont capacity.  
- **Quality:** Medium. This is plausibly checkable against the earnings call, but Electrek’s framing can be editorial. Still, the key point for *outside view* is: Tesla is willing to announce discontinuations, but also tends to set them at quarter boundaries (end of Q2).

8) **Agent report (compiled) – SEC filings / Q4 2025 call: minimal Cybertruck guidance; no Feb 2026 statements found**  
- **What it adds (facts):** There’s no surfaced February 2026 official statement about Cybertruck discontinuation; the Jan 28 call focus was autonomy/Optimus; Cybertruck-specific forward guidance is scant in what was retrieved.  
- **Quality:** Useful as a “what we didn’t find” signal, but it has explicit gaps (notably: missing full 10-K text and potentially missing parts of Q&A).

**Bottom line from sources (strictly factual signals):** Tesla killed the *cheapest trim* (RWD) in 2025; demand appears weaker than early aspirations; and there’s no cited official Feb 2026 move to remove US Cybertruck ordering entirely. Most “cancel soon” claims are opinionated extrapolation rather than direct evidence of imminent discontinuation.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

I’d consider three plausible reference classes:

**RC1: “New vehicle models discontinued within ~2–3 years of launch (industry-wide)”**  
- **Suitability:** Moderate. Captures the general rarity of killing a newly launched vehicle quickly.  
- **Limitation:** Tesla’s direct-to-consumer ordering and OTA-driven product management differs from traditional OEM cycles, so the timing/announcement patterns may differ.

**RC2: “Tesla discontinuing an entire vehicle line (not just trims) in the US”**  
- **Suitability:** High for *process/behavior*. Tesla frequently changes trims, but outright killing a whole model line is relatively rare historically.  
- **Limitation:** Small sample size (few model lines), so base rates are noisy.

**RC3: “High-profile ‘flop’ or niche vehicles from major automakers that underperform expectations”**  
- **Suitability:** Moderate. Cybertruck is atypical and polarizing; niche flops sometimes persist for brand/halo reasons longer than economics would suggest.  
- **Limitation:** These cases vary widely; some get “quietly kept alive” at low volume.

**Most suitable for a clean outside-view baseline:** **RC2**, supplemented by RC1 for sanity-checking. The key is that the question asks about **complete discontinuation of retail sales/ordering in the US**, not a trim cancellation or production pause.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-10  
- **Resolution date:** 2026-04-01  
- **Time remaining:** ~**50 days** (~7 weeks).

For automakers, **full-model discontinuations** typically cluster around:
- **Quarter ends / model-year transitions**
- **Earnings calls** (when management sets expectations)
- **Factory changeovers** (requiring planning and supplier run-out)

With only ~7 weeks left, the window for a decisive, unambiguous discontinuation (per resolution rules) is short. Even firms that *intend* to discontinue often signal it with lead time; the probability mass for a surprise “order page removed permanently” in a random 7-week slice is generally low in the outside view.

---

### (d) Justification (integrating outside-view factors)

From an outside view, a strong baseline is:

1) **Whole-model discontinuation is rare**, especially within a couple years of launch. Most manufacturers (including Tesla) more commonly:
   - Cut trims,
   - Adjust pricing,
   - Pause production,
   - Shift marketing focus,
   - Or keep a low-volume model alive for strategic/brand reasons.

2) **The resolution criteria are strict.**  
   - Killing the **cheapest variant** (already happened) does **not** count.  
   - A temporary order pause doesn’t count unless credible sources say “no intent to restore.”  
   - So the event requires a fairly definitive action/communication.

3) **The short horizon (50 days) heavily suppresses the base rate.**  
   Even if a model is struggling, the likelihood that the company executes a full retail discontinuation *specifically within the next 7 weeks* is much lower than the likelihood it happens “sometime over the next year.”

4) **Upset/unexpected outcomes exist but are not the norm.**  
   Tesla can be idiosyncratic and abrupt (web configurator changes, sudden strategic pivots). That raises the “tail risk” somewhat versus a traditional OEM. But we should still anchor on the general rarity of killing a flagship, newly launched product line on such a short timeline.

Net: outside-view logic points to “No” as the dominant outcome, with a non-trivial but still low tail probability for an abrupt decision driven by demand, reputational issues, or an internal strategic pivot.

---

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor (base rate):** For a major automaker’s *entire vehicle line* being discontinued in a given ~2-month window is typically **very low** (single-digit percent or less). For Tesla specifically, full-line discontinuations are rare historically; trim churn is common.  
- **Adjustment for Tesla-specific abruptness:** Modest upward adjustment (Tesla sometimes makes rapid ordering/configuration changes).  
- **Adjustment for “flop narrative” prevalence:** Keep separate from evidence; outside view should not over-weight editorial conclusions.  
- **Upset rate:** In corporate product decisions, surprises happen, but “complete US retail discontinuation within 7 weeks” remains an outlier event.

A reasonable calibrated outside-view probability lands in the **~3–8%** range.
