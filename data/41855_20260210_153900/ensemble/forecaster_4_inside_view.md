Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. Asianet News, 9 Feb 26 – Quotes Elon Musk in Q4-2025 earnings call: Fremont will exit Model S/X; future line-up “focus on Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck”.  Factual portions (direct Musk quote, production plans) are reliable; bullish commentary on share price is opinion.

2. DriveTesla, 9 Feb 26 – Describes new FSD-transfer rules.  Mentions Cybertruck only to note Luxe-package trade-in policy.  No bearing on discontinuation.  Medium reliability for policy minutiae.

3. Electrek, 29 Jan 26 – Reports Musk/Lars Moravy comments on earnings call; acknowledges large Cybertruck inventory but no hint of discontinuation.  Sales “best-selling EV pickup” claim is disputed by author (opinion).  Medium reliability.

4. Cool-Down, 8 Feb 26 – Summarises same call; confirms official plan to kill Model S/X next quarter, cites 48 % drop in 2025 Cybertruck sales (KBB).  Factual on discontinuation of S/X; sales drop credible but secondary.

5. Guardian, 17 Dec 25 – California DMV stay on licence suspension (Autopilot marketing issue).  Not Cybertruck-specific.  High reliability, low relevance.

6. TorqueNews, 28 Oct 25 – Argues Cybertruck “dire”; mixes Cox data (credible) with speculation.  Lower-medium reliability.

7. Electrek & InsideEVs, 13-14 Sep 25 – Fact: Tesla removed RWD Cybertruck trim from configurator.  Highly reliable for that fact; opinionated framing re “flop”.

8. AskNews Chinese wires, 9-10 Feb 26 – Note NHTSA recall of 46 096 Cybertrucks (factual, verifiable on NHTSA site).  Also restate Cybertruck as “iconic”.  Reliability: factual recall details high, broader narrative mixed.

(b) Evidence analysis (mapped to resolution rules)

Strong evidence toward NO:
•  No credible announcement, SEC filing, or website change indicating a stop-sale; Cybertruck still orderable in U.S. as of 10 Feb 26 (manually verified).  
•  Musk explicitly included Cybertruck in “future line-up” (earnings call 25 Jan 26) while simultaneously announcing S/X discontinuation – shows willingness to say so when true.

Moderate evidence toward YES:
•  46 k-unit recall plus claims of >$100 m inventory and ~20 k/yr demand indicate commercial pressure.
•  Tesla killed cheapest trim five months after launch → shows readiness to prune failing sub-variants.
•  Tesla just proved it will axe whole models (S/X) when strategic focus shifts; reveals precedent.

Weak evidence:
•  Opinion articles calling Cybertruck a “flop” or predicting cancellation without hard sourcing.
•  Regulatory headwinds (California DMV) not targeted at Cybertruck, and suspension stayed.

Weighting net effect: strong evidence for status-quo continuation outweighs moderate “pressure” signals over the next 50 days.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
•  Days until 1 Apr 26: 50.  
•  If the horizon were doubled to 100 days, probability would rise materially (to ~18 %) because the next earnings call (late-Apr) or annual shareholder meeting (May) provide natural announcement windows.  
•  If halved to 25 days, probability would drop (to ~5 %) as quarter-end decision time compresses further.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (major OEM fully discontinuing a brand-new model in a random 7-week window): 6 %.  
Upward adjustments:  
+2 pp – Demonstrated poor demand, large recall, negative margin talk.  
+1 pp – Tesla’s history of abrupt configurator removals and recent S/X termination shows capability.  
Downward / constraining factors:  
–1 pp – Musk just publicly reaffirmed Cybertruck in core line-up 13 days ago; walking that back this quarter would damage credibility.  
Final inside-view: 6 % + 2 % +1 % –1 % ≈ 9 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 9 times in 100 comparable situations Tesla (or any OEM with similar profile) would discontinue U.S. retail sales of the Cybertruck in the next 50 days under current conditions.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between now (10 Feb 26) and 1 Apr 26, will Tesla remove U.S. Cybertruck ordering or formally announce end of its production/sales?”  
2. Base rate logged: 6 %.  
3. Consistency – “9 out of 100 times, Cybertruck gets discontinued before 1 Apr 26.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   •  Cybertruck still on website 10 Feb 26.  
   •  Musk statement (25 Jan 26) keeps Cybertruck but kills S/X.  
   •  46 k-unit recall + large inventory.  
   •  Cheapest trim already axed.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden catastrophic safety finding forcing immediate stop-sale (e.g., structural failure) disclosed next week; would push probability toward 50 %.  
6. Status-quo – Tesla typically iterates via price/trim tweaks rather than whole-model kill; only 7 weeks left.

Probability: 9%
