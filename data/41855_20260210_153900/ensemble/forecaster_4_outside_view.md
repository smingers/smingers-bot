Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. TorqueNews, 28 Oct 2025 – Secondary EV-blog.  Factual data: first-year shipments (~46 k), current sales run-rate (~20 k/yr), RWD variant dropped, inventory ~10 k units.  Opinion: “dire,” “cancel soon.”  Quality: moderate; relies on public sales estimates (Cox Automotive) and anonymous “reports.”  
2. Electrek, 13 Sep 2025 – Well-followed EV site with good track record on Tesla production changes.  Factual: RWD Cybertruck removed from online configurator; sales ~20 k/yr.  Opinion: “commercial flop.”  Quality: solid on configurator changes, more speculative on demand.  
3. InsideEVs, 14 Sep 2025 – Similar facts on RWD variant removal, quarter-over-quarter sales decline.  Quality: moderate; mixes facts with opinion.  
4. ArenaEV, 13 May 2025 – Small outlet reporting Austin production pauses, quoting unnamed employees.  Some factual Cox data, otherwise anecdotal.  Quality: low-to-moderate.  
5. Road & Track, 14 Mar 2025 – Legacy auto magazine.  Facts: body-panel issue, NHTSA complaints (4).  Quality: high for the specific QC issue, irrelevant to discontinuation.  
6. Electrek, 28 Jan 2026 – Transcript of Q4 2025 earnings call.  Hard fact: Model S/X to end by Q2 2026; no mention of halting Cybertruck.  Quality: high.  
7. Agent report (Feb 2026) – Compilation of SEC filings and the same earnings call; confirms no Feb 2026 guidance on killing Cybertruck.  Quality: high for “nothing said.”

Across all sources, only the September/October 2025 pieces explicitly speculate about a cancellation; none provide hard evidence that Tesla plans to end Cybertruck retail sales.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. U.S. light-vehicle nameplates launched since 2000 that were withdrawn within 2 years (e.g., Fiat 500e, Cadillac ELR, Honda Insight Gen 2, Ford C-Max Energi).  Rough frequency ≈ 10–15 % of new nameplates.  
2. Tesla nameplates (Roadster, S, X, 3, Y, Semi).  Only the original Roadster was wound down (after 4 yrs).  Frequency 1/6 ≈ 17 %, but never inside two years.  
3. Battery-electric pickups (Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, Hummer EV).  None discontinued so far (0/3).  
Class 1 provides the largest n and closest economic stakes; I adopt it as baseline but note that Tesla historically lets products limp along rather than swiftly axe them.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution date: 51 days (~1.7 months).  Historically, automakers announce discontinuations at least one full quarter ahead to handle supplier run-offs and regulatory filings.  Model S/X were given 5 months’ notice (Jan 28 → end of Q2 26).  Therefore an announcement before 1 Apr 26 is already getting late.

(d) Justification  
• Status quo: Cybertruck still orderable in the U.S. (checked 10 Feb 26).  
• Recent signals: Q4 25 call did not telegraph trouble; Musk focused on Optimus and autonomy, not a Cybertruck shut-down.  
• Financial incentive: Even at 20 k/yr, Tesla can amortise sunk tooling and collect positive gross margin (> $10 k/unit per TorqueNews).  Killing the line in < 2 yrs would crystallise a near-$1 bn write-off; Tesla traditionally avoids write-offs.  
• Precedent: Tesla let Model S/X run at 25–50 % of capacity for years before deciding to end them.  
• Time remaining: Only 7 weeks for either (a) Tesla yanks order button with no intention to restore or (b) public announcement.  Neither whisper nor leak of such a move has surfaced in reputable outlets or SEC filings.  
• Upset rate: Big-company product surprises do occur (e.g., GM kills Chevy Bolt 2023 with 4 months’ notice), but truly “overnight” withdrawals inside eight weeks are rare (< 5 %).  Add a margin for Musk’s unpredictability.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline probability that a new U.S. model is discontinued within 2 yrs ≈ 10–15 %.  
Probability the decision (and public disclosure) happens in the final 2 months of that window: roughly 1/4 of those cases → 2.5–3.5 %.  
Adjust up for Musk volatility (+1 ppt) and for the visible sales weakness (+2 ppt).  
Adjust down (–1 ppt) because Cybertruck still commands media mindshare and serves as halo/tech demonstrator.  

Net outside-view probability ≈ 4–5 %.  I choose the midpoint 4.5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
4.5 %
