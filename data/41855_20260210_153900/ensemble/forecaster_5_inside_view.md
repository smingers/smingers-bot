Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, brief)  
• Electrek (13 Sep 2025) – confirms Tesla removed the RWD Cybertruck from its US configurator; sales about 20 k / yr.  Factual removal is well documented; commentary (“commercial flop”) is opinion.  Electrek has a solid track-record on Tesla website changes.  
• TorqueNews (28 Oct 2025) – re-aggregates Cox Automotive sales data (46 k first-year deliveries) and argues cancellation “soon.”  Facts on deliveries are credible; the cancellation claim is author speculation.  
• Tesla Q4-2025 earnings call & 8-K (28 Jan 2026) – Elon Musk announces end of Model S/X next quarter, re-affirms “our core line-up will be Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck.”  Direct primary source; high reliability.  
• Electrek op-ed (29 Jan 2026) – notes inventory build and argues Cybertruck might be redeployed as cargo vans.  Facts: hundreds of millions in Cybertruck inventory acknowledged by Tesla; opinions on redeployment are speculative.  
• DriveTeslaCanada & Benzinga (9 Feb 2026) – update FSD-transfer rules; mention Cybertruck Luxe Package and trade-in valuations.  Indicates Tesla still marketing and supporting Cybertruck.  Purely factual.  
• Asianet Newswire summary (9 Feb 2026) – states Tesla future line-up will “focus on Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck.”  Based on Musk comments; source quality moderate, but quote matches primary call.  
• Chinese-language business press (9–10 Feb 2026) – repeats NHTSA recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks and says Cybercab production in Austin will start April 2026 with 2 m unit/yr target.  Recall figure matches NHTSA database; Cybercab plan comes from prior shareholder meeting.  These are largely factual; 2 m/yr target is characteristic Musk ambition.  
No source after 28 Jan 2026 reports Tesla even hinting at stopping Cybertruck orders.  All current configurators (checked 10 Feb 2026, 14:30 UTC) still allow US orders for AWD and Cyberbeast trims.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weighting)  
Strong evidence (against discontinuation)  
• Official Tesla guidance (28 Jan 2026) that Cybertruck is part of the core 2026 line-up.  
• Website still live with US ordering enabled (direct observation).  
Moderate evidence (for discontinuation)  
• Very poor demand vs. 125 k/yr capacity; large inventory and RWD trim already killed.  
• Corporate precedent: Tesla just killed Model S/X, showing willingness to cull low-volume products.  
Weak evidence (for discontinuation)  
• Media speculation (TorqueNews, Electrek op-ed) that Cybertruck is “next to go.”  
• Potential capacity conflict with Cybercab line starting April 2026 (not confirmed).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 51 days.  Major scheduled communications before then: none—next earnings call falls after 1 Apr 2026.  Therefore, a “Yes” would almost certainly come via an unscheduled press release or a stealth website removal.  Tesla has done quiet removals before (RWD trim), so probability is non-zero but small.  If the window were doubled to 102 days my estimate would rise to ~5 %; halved to 25 days it would fall to ~2 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view annual base-rate for a two-year-old vehicle being axed inside a 51-day window: 1.2 %.  
Upward adjustments  
+1.5  pp  Persistently weak sales and inventory build.  
+1.0  pp  Tesla demonstrated readiness to drop entire lines (Model S/X) in Jan 2026.  
+0.3  pp  Cybercab may compete for Austin floor space.  
Downward adjustments  
−0.5  pp  Very recent public commitment to keep Cybertruck in the core range.  
−0.5  pp  Marketing/halo value; sunk tooling cost is high, so even token production has option value.  
Net inside-view ≈ 3.0 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 3 times in 100 similar situations Tesla (or a comparable OEM) would discontinue the Cybertruck inside the next 51 days.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between now and 1 Apr 2026 (inclusive) Tesla must remove US ordering or formally announce end of Cybertruck sales for a “Yes”.  
2. Outside-view base: 1.2 %.  
3. Consistency line: “3 out of 100 times, Tesla ends Cybertruck retail sales by 1 Apr 2026.”  
4. Key evidence snippets (validated):  
   a) 28 Jan 26 call – Musk: “core line-up Model 3, Y, Cybertruck.”  
   b) Tesla.com still taking Cybertruck orders (10 Feb 26).  
   c) RWD variant axed after 5 months → demand weak.  
   d) NHTSA recall of 46 k units & inventory build.  
   e) Model S/X discontinuation shows willingness to cull.  
5. Blind-spot: A major safety or regulatory order (e.g., NHTSA park-in-place) forcing immediate stop-sale could arise suddenly; would move probability to >50 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No”; given short window and present signals, a slight nudge toward status-quo is appropriate.

Probability: 3%
