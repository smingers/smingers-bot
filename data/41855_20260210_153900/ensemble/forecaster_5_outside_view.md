Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. TorqueNews, 28 Oct 2025  
   • Facts: -46 k units shipped in first 12 months, RWD variant dropped, inventories >10 k, Cox Automotive Q3 25 sales 5 385 units.  
   • Opinions: Author calls situation “dire” and predicts imminent cancellation.  
   • Quality: Small enthusiast outlet; factual numbers mostly re-aggregated from Cox Automotive (credible) but interpretation is speculative.

2. Electrek, 13 Sep 2025  
   • Facts: RWD Cybertruck removed from Tesla configurator after ≈ 5 months on sale, current sales ≈ 20 k / yr (figure sourced to Cox).  
   • Opinions: “Commercial flop”, “no one wanted it.”  
   • Quality: Widely read EV site with decent track record. Factual removal of the RWD version is solid; sales-rate commentary partly speculative.

3. InsideEVs, 14 Sep 2025  
   • Facts: Same RWD discontinuation; lists deleted features, compares pricing vs. rivals; Q2 25 “other models” deliveries 10 394 (Tesla 10-Q).  
   • Opinions: Suggests Tesla is “streamlining” and “missed the mark.”  
   • Quality: Credible trade publication; hard data from Tesla filings.

4. Road & Track, 14 Mar 2025  
   • Facts: Deliveries briefly paused for body-panel checks, 4 NHTSA complaints.  
   • Opinions: None material.  
   • Quality: Mainstream automotive magazine; event verified by owner videos, but scale uncertain.

5. ArenaEV, 13 May 2025  
   • Facts: Week-long production pause at Austin; Q1 25 Cybertruck sales 6 406 (Cox Auto).  
   • Opinions: “Serious issues with demand.”  
   • Quality: Small site; relies on unnamed employees—moderate confidence in pause, low in interpretation.

6. Electrek, 28 Jan 2026 (Q4 25 earnings)  
   • Facts: Model S/X to end by Q2 26; Cybertruck not mentioned as at-risk.  
   • Opinions: Author asks “Is Cybertruck next?”.  
   • Quality: Factual discontinuation of S/X backed by Tesla call; Cybertruck comment is conjecture.

7. Agent report (SEC filings & call)  
   • Facts: 8-K filed 28 Jan 26, no Cybertruck guidance; no Feb 26 statements found.  
   • Quality: Aggregates primary documents; high for what is covered.

Across sources, hard facts are: (i) cheapest variant gone, (ii) sales well below capacity, (iii) no management hint of cancellation as of 28 Jan 26.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Candidates:  
1. All U.S. light-vehicle nameplates that are fully discontinued within 24 months of launch.  
   – Examples 2000-2023: Honda Insight (1st gen), Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet, Ford C-Max Energi, Cadillac ELR, Chevy Volt (2nd gen). Rough count ≈ 12 out of ~450 launches → 2.5%/model-year hazard in yrs 1-2.  
2. New models with first-year sales < 40 % of stated plant capacity. Historically (Coda, Cadillac ELR, BMW i3 in U.S., Ford Focus Electric) discontinuation within two calendar years occurred in ≈ 25% of such cases, but rarely in the next 60 days.  
3. Tesla-specific: Since 2012 Tesla has launched 7 production vehicles; only 2 (Model S & X) have announced end-dates, both after ≥ 10 years. 2-month hazard ≈ 0.2 %.  

Class 1 is broad but matches the “model as a product.” Class 3 captures company culture of avoiding cancellations. Class 2 adjusts for evident under-performance. A blended reference class weighting 50/30/20 for (3)/(1)/(2) seems reasonable because corporate culture (3) matters most, but some penalty for under-performance (2) and general industry behaviour (1) is warranted.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Time remaining until resolution: 51 days (~1.7 months). Historically, OEMs announce discontinuations at model-year boundaries (Aug–Nov) or during earnings calls (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct). The just-completed 28 Jan 26 call is the likeliest window we just passed; next scheduled disclosure (Q1 26 call) falls after 1 Apr 26. Mid-quarter surprise removals from website do occur (e.g., Tesla RWD Cybertruck in Sep 25), so a sudden step-function event is possible but statistically uncommon.

(d) Justification  

• Base rate from blended reference class for any given model being killed in the next full year ≈ 7%.  
• Convert to 51-day window: 7% * (51/365) ≈ 1.0%.  
• Adjust upward because:  
  – Cybertruck exhibits several risk flags (sales < 20 k / yr vs 120 k capacity, negative press, RWD trim already axed) → +2 pts.  
• Adjust downward because:  
  – Management just publicly terminated S/X but stayed silent on Cybertruck 13 days ago; political cost of another kill so soon is high → −1 pt.  
  – Large sunk cost and marketing halo; even “token” production keeps option value alive → −1 pt.  
Net outside-view probability ≈ 1 % + ( +2 – 1 – 1 ) = 1 %.

Outside view calibration:

• There is no historical instance of Tesla fully cancelling a vehicle within 28 months of SOP.  
• Industry-wide, sudden 60-day discontinuations are rare (~1 %).  
• Upset frequency in corporate decisions is high but still single-digit.  
Given the limited time window and the absence of official hints, probabilities materially higher than 5 % would ignore the strong base rates.

Outside View Prediction: 1.2 %
