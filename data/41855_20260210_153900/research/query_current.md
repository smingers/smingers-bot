Analysis:
The resolution hinges on evidence that Tesla has either (a) removed the option to order a new Cybertruck on its US website with no plan to reinstate it, or (b) officially announced an end to Cybertruck production or sales before April 1 2026. Therefore the most pertinent updates would be: 1) changes to Tesla’s Cybertruck ordering page, 2) official Tesla statements (press releases, SEC filings, earnings calls, executive interviews, X posts), and 3) credible media reports quoting Tesla insiders about halting production or cancelling the model. Current-year (2026) coverage is critical, especially items from January–February 2026 that might mention factory slowdowns, supply-chain wind-downs, or notice to reservation holders. Keywords should combine “Tesla,” “Cybertruck,” and verbs like “discontinue,” “cancel,” “stop,” “halt,” “order” or “remove,” plus the 2026 time frame.
