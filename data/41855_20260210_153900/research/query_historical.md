Analysis:
The main uncertainty is whether, in the next seven weeks, Tesla will either (a) pull the Cybertruck order button in the U.S. and keep it down for good or (b) publicly announce that it is ending Cybertruck production/sales.  To judge how plausible that is, the most useful historical context includes:

• Tesla’s recent actions toward the Cybertruck: Has the online configurator been intermittently removed? Did Tesla pause production, cut shifts, or announce a “temporary shut-down” of the line at Giga Texas? What exactly have company executives said in their latest earnings call, SEC filings, or public events (e.g., Investor Day 2026 preview on March 7)?

• Precedents for Tesla cancelling trims or whole models (Roadster 1.0, original Model S 40 kWh, Model 3 Long Range RWD, Plaid+).  How long after first deliveries did Tesla abandon them, and what language did it use (“indefinitely delayed”, “no longer available”, etc.)?

• Current sales / production volumes and reservation backlog.  Have credible analysts projected that Cybertruck gross margins are negative, giving Tesla an incentive to axe the program?

• Media reporting since late-2025 about “Cybertruck a flop” and any scoops on Tesla telling suppliers to wind down orders.

Therefore the initial searches should gather:  
(1) any change to Tesla’s U.S. order page;  
(2) late-breaking news (Feb 2026) about production halts or executive statements;  
(3) authoritative sources—SEC 10-K/10-Q, Q4-2025 earnings call transcript—to see if management hinted at discontinuation.
