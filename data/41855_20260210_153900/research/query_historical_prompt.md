Question background:
TorqueNews (October 28, 2025): [Why Tesla Will Cancel Cybertruck Production Soon](https://www.torquenews.com/18004/why-tesla-will-cancel-cybertruck-production-soon)

> The future looked really bright for the Tesla Cybertruck back in early 2021 when it had over a million reservations, and Elon Musk estimated that Tesla could sell about a half-million trucks annually. Things continued to look good after its first year of production, as Tesla managed to ship about 46,000 units. This wasn’t a bad production ramp for the first year of a new vehicle with a production line capacity of 125,000 units per year. However, between then and now, the situation has become dire.

Elektrek (September 13, 2025): [Tesla discontinues cheapest Cybertruck, no one wanted it](https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/)

> Tesla has discontinued the cheapest version of the Cybertruck just a few months after launching it.

> No one wanted the gutted electric truck.

> There’s no hiding it. The Cybertruck is a commercial flop.

> Tesla claimed to have over 1 million reservations for the vehicle. It planned for a production capacity of up to 250,000 units per year, and CEO Elon Musk even said that he believes it could increase to 500,000 units per year.

> Meanwhile, Tesla is currently selling the Cybertruck at a rate of roughly 20,000 units per year.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.
