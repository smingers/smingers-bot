Tesla unveiled the Tesla Cybercab, a two-seat, steering-wheel-free, fully autonomous vehicle powered by Tesla Vision and end-to-end neural networks, marking its Asian debut at the Eighth China International Import Expo in Shanghai. The Cybercab is scheduled to begin mass production in the second quarter of 2026 for integration into Tesla's Robotaxi fleet. Small Giant Automobile's Chairman He Xiaopeng emphasized that autonomous driving is the company's core identity and predicted that the next decade will bring a revolutionary leap in L3-level autonomous vehicles, paving the way toward full L4 autonomy. He also highlighted the progress of Xpeng AeroHT's flying car, aiming for market delivery in 2027. Meanwhile, Waymo announced full autonomous operations in Nashville, Tennessee, expanding its fleet to over 2,500 vehicles across six U.S. cities. In China, Xpeng's L2 highway and urban autonomous driving systems have been widely adopted in affordable models, while its AI 1.0 urban driving system was launched in late 2022. On the same day, several stocks related to autonomous driving showed movements: King Long Automobile fell 2.28%, Xingmin Zhitong rose 0.00%, Star Source Zhuomei dropped 2.44%, and Seres Group declined 0.56%. Notably, Seres Group's M9 model won the 500,000 RMB-class luxury car sales crown in China, and its new M7 series was the top-selling new energy vehicle. He Xiaopeng also declared 2026 as the 'true full self-driving year' for China and the U.S., arguing that L3 is a flawed transitional stage due to unclear liability and engineering challenges, and that Tesla and Xpeng are skipping L3 to aim directly for L4. Tesla's FSD is now available on 2024\u20132026 model Y and Model 3 variants with HW4.0 hardware, and the Cybercab is set to be produced at the Texas Gigafactory starting in April 2026, with a target production of 2 million units annually.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 10:11 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c0019029cgu.html)\n\n**New Energy Vehicle Hotspots: Stellantis Impairment, Zeekr Recall, Aito M9 Event, and Tesla Cybercab Debut**\nOn February 10, 2026, major developments in the Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) sector were reported. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest automaker, announced a $26.5 billion impairment charge due to miscalculations in its electric vehicle transition strategy, leading to a 30% drop in its Milan stock price\u2014its lowest since the 2021 FCA-PSA merger. This impairment exceeds the company's current market value, and analysts note the scale and cash impact represent a significant negative shock. Ford and General Motors had previously reported similar EV-related impairments, but Stellantis' charge sets a new industry record. In China, Zeekr recalled 38,200 units of its older 001 WE 86 model (produced from July 2021 to March 2024) due to battery issues, following a resolution to a dispute between its battery supplier, Sino-Platinum Power (a subsidiary of Wanxiang), and its parent company, Geely's Weiwei Electric. The recall involves free battery replacements via inspection or remote diagnosis. Meanwhile, the Aito M9 'Starlight Night' owner event on February 9, 2026, drew celebrities including Ma Dong, Liu Tao, and Shang Wenjie, being hailed as the 'Spring Festival Gala' of the NEV community. Aito M9 has delivered over 270,000 units and has held the top spot in the premium NEV segment for 21 consecutive months. Its OTA updates and personalized features enhance user loyalty. In 2025, China's NEV retail penetration reached 54%, surpassing 50%, marking a turning point in the automotive transition, with fuel vehicles now the 'minority choice.' Despite this, Geely's 'China Star' gasoline-powered lineup achieved 1.21 million annual sales, securing its ninth consecutive year as the top-selling Chinese brand in the fuel segment. The U.S. NHTSA announced a recall of 46,096 Tesla Cybertrucks (2024\u20132025 models) due to loose side panel components posing collision risks. Tesla's Cybercab, a fully autonomous ride-hailing vehicle, made its Asia-Pacific debut at the 2025 Shanghai CIIE, featuring wireless charging and robotic cleaning systems, with plans for mass production in Q2 2026. The Cybercab's golden exterior and futuristic design reflect Tesla's vision for AI-driven mobility. The company emphasized that the CIIE platform enables global innovation exchange. Additionally, BYD and the Boao Forum for Asia announced a strategic partnership to strengthen BYD's global commercial positioning, supporting its D9 model\u2019s continued success as the world\u2019s first NEV MPV to exceed 300,000 sales, with expansion into Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Technical reports also explored issues like Tesla Model 3 software incompatibility and system update failures causing infotainment crashes, as well as battery health impacting post-charging range. The Cybertruck, with its angular, armored design, remains a polarizing yet iconic symbol of futuristic electric vehicle design.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:22 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c0019028wew.html)\n\n**Global Auto Industry News: Stellantis Impairment, Ferrari\u2019s Luce Debut, Zeekr Recall, Tesla Recall, and China\u2019s EV Leadership**\nOn February 6, 2026, global fourth-largest automaker Stellantis announced a $26.5 billion impairment charge, citing misjudged electric vehicle transition timing and a significant reduction in EV business targets. The announcement triggered a 30% drop in its Milan stock price\u2014the lowest since the 2021 FCA-PSA merger\u2014exceeding the company\u2019s current market value. This marks the largest EV-related impairment in the industry, surpassing previous write-downs by Ford and General Motors. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s former chief designer Jony Ive unveiled the interior of Ferrari\u2019s first electric sports car, Luce, which features numerous physical switches and knobs despite the trend toward full touchscreens, reflecting a design philosophy focused on tactile feedback. The car\u2019s name 'Luce,' meaning 'light' in Italian, symbolizes Ferrari\u2019s future direction, with the interior co-designed by Ive and industrial designer Marc Newson. The design emphasizes minimalism, high-end materials, and Apple-like rounded rectangles. In China, Zeekr recalled 38,200 units of its older 001 WE 86 model due to battery issues, following a resolution to a supplier dispute between Xinwangda and Volvo\u2019s Weyron Electric. The recall is linked to the 2021 PMA platform battery project. Zeekr also previewed new models, including the updated 007 and 007G7, which will feature NVIDIA DRIVE Thor-U chips, 900V high-voltage architecture, and increased power output\u2014single-motor version now at 370 kW (up from 310 kW) and top speed raised to 240 km/h. The new dual-motor version reaches 215/370 kW (up from 165/310 kW). On February 9, 2026, the Aito M9 'Starlight Night'\u8f66\u4e3b\u76db\u5178 attracted celebrities like Ma Dong, Liu Tao, and Shang Wenjie, hailed as the 'Spring Festival Gala' of the EV community, highlighting the car\u2019s reliability across business, family, and long-distance use. Aito M9 has delivered over 270,000 units and led the premium EV segment for 21 consecutive months. Tesla recalled 46,096 units of 2024\u20132025 Cybertrucks in the U.S. due to loose side panel components posing a collision risk. In global EV advancements, China\u2019s STC32G12K128 microcontroller, a car-grade MCU, is now powering thermal management systems in Geely commercial vehicles, enabling precise temperature control in extreme climates\u2014from -40\u00b0C in Siberia to +50\u00b0C in the Sahara. The chip\u2019s microsecond-level response ensures battery efficiency and cabin comfort. Additionally, BYD\u2019s partnership with the Boao Forum for Asia strengthens its global positioning, especially as the Dynasty D9 has become the world\u2019s first EV MPV to exceed 300,000 sales and is now available in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Finally, a discussion on travel choices during Chinese New Year compares the economic and time efficiency of driving versus taking trains, noting that carpooling reduces per-person costs, while trains offer fixed pricing and lower individual expenses, especially for solo or two-person trips.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:26 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c0019028udk.html)\n\n**Tesla's Cybercab to Begin Mass Production in Texas in April 2026, Aiming for 2 Million Units Annually**\nTesla announced that its autonomous electric vehicle, the Cybercab, will begin mass production and operation in April 2026 at the company's Super Factory in Texas. CEO Elon Musk stated during the 2025 shareholder meeting that the Cybercab has the potential to become Tesla's highest-volume model, with a target annual production capacity of approximately 2 million units. The Cybercab is a two-seat autonomous taxi (Robotaxi) designed based on data showing that over 90% of trips involve no more than two passengers. Tesla emphasized that the existing product lineup will be integrated with the Cybercab to form a comprehensive Robotaxi service matrix catering to different passenger volumes.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 04:17 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://auto.ifeng.com/c/8qc4tRtjKAA)\n\n**Filosa's Reset at Stellantis: Beyond Electrification \u2013 How Product, Platforms, and Management Led to Billions in Losses**\nStellantis faces multi-billion-dollar losses, with \u20ac22.2 billion in charges reported in the second half of 2025, of which \u20ac14.7 billion are attributed to product plan realignment driven by reduced customer demand for electric vehicles and new U.S. emissions regulations. Of this, \u20ac2.9 billion stems from the write-down of canceled models, including the electric Ram 1500, which failed in the U.S. market\u2014a market historically unreceptive to electric pickup trucks, as evidenced by the underperformance of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck. The company\u2019s reset strategy reflects a pivot toward real market demand, including the revival of large Hemi engines and the discontinuation of high-end electric models like the Maserati MC20 Folgore, which struggled due to low demand among luxury buyers for battery-powered vehicles that diverge from traditional brand identities. The losses highlight not only misjudged product strategy but also broader management shortcomings.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 02:31 PM\nSource:[Quattroruote.it](https://www.quattroruote.it/news/industria-finanza/2026/02/09/stellantis_modelli-_piattaforme-_qualita-_tutti_gli_errori_-miliardari-_di_tavares.html)\n\n**Tesla Stock Rises Premarket: CEO Elon Musk Pulls The Curtain Back On Semi Truck And Teases 'High Volume Production'**\nTesla's stock rose nearly 1% in premarket trading on February 9, 2026, following the company's release of final specifications for its Semi truck and CEO Elon Musk's confirmation that high-volume production of the electric truck will begin in 2026. The Semi will be offered in two trims: a Standard version with up to 325 miles of range and an 82,000-pound gross combination weight, and a Long Range variant with up to 500 miles of range and a curb weight of 23,000 pounds. Both trims consume 1.7 kWh per mile, recover about 60% of their range in 30 minutes, feature three rear-axle motors delivering up to 800 kW, support MCS 3.2 fast charging, and include electric power take-off up to 25 kW. Musk emphasized that the Semi\u2019s total cost of ownership is lower than diesel trucks due to reduced electricity costs, minimal maintenance, over-the-air updates, and improved fleet uptime. Tesla has already delivered Semis to select customers, including DHL, which uses the trucks on 100-mile California routes, charging once weekly. The company also expanded its U.S. Model Y lineup with a new AWD variant priced at $41,990 and rebranded the cheaper model as Model Y RWD, bringing the total Model Y variants to five, priced between $39,990 and $57,490. Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X will end next quarter, with the Fremont factory transitioning to Optimus robot production. Tesla\u2019s future lineup will focus on Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck, with the Model 3 starting at $36,990 and the Cybertruck available in two trims. Tesla plans to unveil the next-generation Roadster in April and begin production of its Cybercab robotaxi. Vanguard Group significantly increased its stake in Tesla by acquiring 6.54 million shares in Q4 2025, raising its holdings to approximately 258.9 million shares valued at $102.85 billion, making it Tesla\u2019s largest institutional shareholder. This marked Vanguard\u2019s largest quarterly addition since late 2022 and a more than fourfold increase in holdings over the past two years. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment was 'bearish' amid normal message volume, with one user predicting TSLA could reach $600, while another expressed concern that the loss of Model S and X revenue may not be offset by Semi sales. Tesla\u2019s stock has risen 10% over the past 12 months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://newsable.asianetnews.com/markets/tesla-stock-rises-premarket-ceo-elon-musk-pulls-the-curtain-back-on-semi-truck-and-teases-high-volume-production-articleshow-g9pzxwl)\n\n**Tesla Announces FSD Consideration in Trade-In Appraisals for Luxe Package Models S, X, and Cyberbeast Trim**\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has announced that for the 2026 model year, its valuation of trade-ins for Model S and Model X vehicles, as well as the Cyberbeast trim of the Cybertruck, will consider whether the vehicle is equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. The primary criterion for this consideration is the presence of the Luxe Package. Although FSD is generally not factored into trade-in appraisals, Tesla explicitly states that for vehicles with the Luxe Package\u2014specifically the 2026 Model S, Model X, and Cyberbeast trim\u2014FSD software will be taken into account during trade-in evaluations. This update follows Tesla's prior announcement that free FSD transfer would end on March 31, 2026. The company now clarifies that even if a customer places a new vehicle order by March 31, they remain eligible for the transfer terms. Once the offer is used, FSD becomes available only on the new vehicle. Elon Musk recently revealed that Tesla will cease production of Model S and Model X by the end of this quarter, redirecting its Fremont, California facility to focus on Optimus production. In market performance, TSLA rose 3.50% to $411.11 at Friday\u2019s market close and further increased 0.66% to $413.83 in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Edge rankings, which note Tesla\u2019s strong momentum and favorable long-term price trends.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:15 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50471454/s-x-fsd)\n\n**Tesla Says FSD Service Would Be Taken Into Account When Trading In Model S, X, Cyberbeast Trims With Luxe Package**\nTesla Inc.

According to updated FSD transfer terms released on February 9, 2026, FSD will be factored into trade-in valuations for Model Year 2026 Model S and X vehicles with the Luxe Package, and for any Cyberbeast trim with the Luxe Package. The company also announced that Free FSD transfers will end on March 31, 2026, with customers qualifying if they place a new vehicle order by that date\u2014delivery is no longer required by the deadline. Once the offer is used, FSD becomes available only on the new vehicle. Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that production of the Model S and X will end by the end of the quarter, with the Fremont, California, facility repurposed for Optimus robot production. On February 7, 2026, TSLA stock surged 3.50% to $411.11 at market close and gained an additional 0.66% to $413.83 during the overnight session.

During the company's recent financial results call, Elon Musk stated, 'It is time to end the Model S and X programs with honors, as we are truly entering an era based on autonomy.' He added that Tesla aims to produce one million Optimus robots annually at the Fremont facility, though this target remains speculative given Musk's history of ambitious, unverified claims. Despite Musk expressing emotional attachment to the retiring models\u2014particularly the Model S, which launched in 2012 as Tesla's first mass-market vehicle, and the Model X, introduced in 2015 with its distinctive falcon-wing doors\u2014their sales share has steadily declined. According to Inside EVs, the Model 3 and Model Y accounted for 1.6 million sales in 2025, while the 'other models' category\u2014including the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck\u2014sold only 50,850 units. Thus, while the discontinuation may be emotionally significant for Musk, it is financially negligible for Tesla. Musk emphasized that Tesla remains committed to electric vehicles, with new models in development, including the promised Cybercab, the Semi truck, and a redesigned Roadster.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 06:18 PM\nSource:[98.5 FM](https://www.985fm.ca/nouvelles/755215/tesla-abandonne-les-model-s-et-model-x)\n\n**Tesla Discontinues Production of RWD Cybertruck**\nTesla has stopped production of the rear\u2011drive (RWD) version of its Cybertruck, the most affordable variant, after only a few months on the market. The RWD model, introduced in April 2025, was priced from $70,000, compared with the all\u2011wheel\u2011drive (AWD) version\u2019s $80,000. Analysts say the RWD cut key features such as the active air\u2011suspension, power\u2011lift trunk lid and onboard outlets, and omitted one motor, making it less attractive. Earlier, Tesla had claimed over one million pre\u2011orders and planned a production capacity of 250,000 units per year, with CEO Elon Musk saying the capacity could rise to 500,000. Yet the company now sells only about 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, leading to the decision to stop the RWD variant. The move reflects weak demand for the trimmed\u2011down electric pickup, according to Electrek.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/tehnoblog/343611_Tesla_prekratila_vyipusk_elektropikapa_Cybertruck_szadneprivodnoy_modifikatsiey/)\n\n**Tesla Cybertruck Long Range RWD Discontinued After Five Months: Cheapest Electric Pickup Pulled From Sale**\nTesla announced that it will stop producing the cheapest model of its Cybertruck, the Long Range RWD, only five months after its launch. The pickup first entered the market in April 2025 at a list price of $69,990, which dropped to $62,490 after a $7,500 subsidy. Elon Musk had previously claimed in 2019 that the lowest\u2011priced Cybertruck would cost $40,000. The Long Range RWD was the least equipped version, featuring a single rear\u2011wheel\u2011drive motor, a payload capacity of 910\u202fkg, and the longest range in the lineup at 563\u2013583\u202fkm. The decision to discontinue the model follows the brief market presence of the vehicle.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 04:54 PM\nSource:[focus.ua](https://focus.ua/uk/auto/724186-naydeshevshu-tesla-cybertruck-pripinili-prodavati-cherez-5-misyaciv-pislya-prem-yeri-prichina)\n\n**Tesla Discontinues Cybertruck RWD Variant 5 Months After Launch Amid Poor Sales: Report**\nTesla Inc. has discontinued the rear\u2011wheel\u2011drive (RWD) trim of its Cybertruck, the most affordable variant that retailed for $69,990 and offered an estimated range of 362 miles, five months after its launch in April, according to Electrek. The RWD trim also had a reduced ground clearance, 7,500\u2011lb towing capacity, and 18\u2011inch wheels, but the company now only lists the standard all\u2011wheel\u2011drive (AWD) trim and the high\u2011end Cyberbeast trim that retails for $114,990. Tesla reportedly had over 10,000 unsold Cybertruck units in the U.S., a figure that prompted the discontinuation.\n\nTesla\u2019s market share in the U.S. fell below the 40% threshold for the first time in almost eight years, since October 2017, leaving it with 38% of the EV sector. In Europe, the company recorded a 40.2% decline in sales, while rival BYD Co. Ltd. surged 225% in the same region. China remains a stronghold: the newly launched Model\u202fY\u202fL, a six\u2011seater version of the Model\u202fY SUV, has racked up 120,000 orders since its introduction last month, and Tesla logged 14.3\u202fk new insured registrations in China during the first week of September, though sales are still down 12.1% YoY.\n\nTesla scores well on Momentum and Growth metrics, while offering satisfactory Quality, but poor Value. \"Tesla did not immediately respond to Benzinga\u2019s request for comment,\" the article notes.\n\nThe decision reflects the automaker\u2019s struggle with poor sales figures for the Cybertruck and a broader shift in strategy to position the vehicle as a lifestyle product for traditional pickup truck owners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 07:20 AM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/09/47661171/tesla-discontinues-cybertruck-rwd-variant-5-months-after-launch-amid-poor-sales-report)\n\n**Tesla Suddenly Stops Production of the Cybertruck Model**\nTesla, the most demanded automotive brand in Turkey, abruptly halted production of its rear\u2011wheel\u2011drive Cybertruck model after only five months on the market. The model, introduced in April 2025 with a price tag of 69,990\u202fUSD (2,351,664\u202fTL), was cheaper than the all\u2011wheel\u2011drive version by 10,000\u202fUSD. Despite the lower price, sales were insufficient, and the vehicle\u2019s limited hardware features\u2014such as a single\u2011motor setup, lower traction, limited payload capacity, and long charging times\u2014failed to attract buyers. Consequently, Tesla decided to discontinue the model.\n\nKey metrics: 69,990\u202fUSD price, 2,351,664\u202fTL local price, 10,000\u202fUSD cheaper than all\u2011wheel\u2011drive version, five\u2011month production run.\n\nSource: Yeni\u202f\u00c7a\u011f\u202fGazetesi, published September\u202f14\u202f2025.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/tesla-aniden-o-modelin-uretimini-durdurdu-954226h.htm)\n\n**Tesla Discontinues Cheapest Cybertruck Within Five Months**\nTesla announced the discontinuation of its cheapest Cybertruck model within less than five months of launch, according to electrek. The truck, which was heavily trimmed, had received over 1\u202fmillion pre\u2011orders and Tesla had planned an annual production capacity of up to 250\u202f000 units, with CEO Elon Musk saying a future capacity of 500\u202f000 could be reached. In reality, annual sales have stayed around 20\u202f000 units. The main reason for the poor sales is that the final price of the Cybertruck was higher than initially advertised while the configuration was reduced. To address the situation, Tesla released a more economical rear\u2011drive version in April\u202f2025, priced at $70\u202f000 versus $80\u202f000 for the all\u2011wheel\u2011drive version. However, the rear\u2011drive model cut one motor and removed key features such as active air suspension, an electric power\u2011folding tailgate, and a power\u2011inlet for the cargo bay. Within five months of its launch, Tesla stopped production of the rear\u2011drive Cybertruck and removed the option from its online configurator, with no replacement model announced.

According to the article, these changes made the truck unattractive to buyers, and sales have fallen to roughly 20\u202f000 units per year\u2014far below the company\u2019s 250\u202f000\u2011unit annual production target.

The article reports that the variant \"faced little demand\" and that its removal highlights the vehicle\u2019s commercial failure. The model was 10,000\u202fUS\u202fdollars cheaper than the all\u2011wheel\u2011drive version and omitted several features, including adaptive air suspension, a motorised cargo\u2011deck cover, a rear\u2011seat touchscreen, cargo\u2011area outlets, and a rear light bar, leaving the truck with a single motor instead of two. Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk had previously announced a goal of selling up to 500,000 Cybertrucks in 2024 and claimed two million pre\u2011orders, yet the company sold only about 20,000 units per year. The article notes that the Cybertruck was the most recalled vehicle in the U.S. market in Q1\u202f2025, with recalls issued for parts of the welded stainless\u2011steel body that could fall off, as well as for jammed accelerator pedals and faulty brakes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered a recall of all Cybertrucks produced to date.

The article notes that the cheaper variant omitted a second traction motor, reduced payload capacity, lacked a power\u2011train\u2011motorized cover for the cargo area, and had fewer amenities such as a soft cargo\u2011area cover for an extra $750, 7 of 15 speakers, no active noise cancellation, and no rear\u2011seat monitor. It also lacked rear\u2011seat heating and was slower to charge. Tesla now offers only the dual\u2011motor all\u2011wheel\u2011drive Cybertruck starting at $79,990 and the three\u2011motor Cyberbeast at $114,990.
