There's basically no use case.\"\n- Described as potentially \"the worst vehicle ever made\" (if the Reliant Robin didn't exist)\n\n### Unattributed Reports:\n- \"Multiple outlets have reported\" the 10,000+ unit inventory figure\n- \"There are reports\" that SpaceX and xAI are purchasing hundreds or possibly thousands of Cybertrucks to absorb supply and support quarterly sales results\n- This \"further fuels the perception that the Cybertruck is a commercial flop\"\n\n## Technical Innovations Highlighted:\nThe article notes several technological advances introduced with the Cybertruck: 48-volt electrical architecture, giga castings, stainless steel panels (no paint/rust), steer-by-wire system, and rear-wheel steering.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/\">\n# Summary of Elektrek Article (September 13, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Discontinuation**: Tesla discontinued the cheapest Cybertruck variant (rear-wheel-drive model) less than 5 months after launching it in April 2025.\n\n2. **Sales Performance**: \n   - Tesla is currently selling the Cybertruck at a rate of roughly 20,000 units per year\n   - This is significantly below original projections of 250,000 units per year production capacity\n   - Elon Musk had previously stated he believed capacity could reach 500,000 units per year\n   - Tesla claimed to have over 1 million reservations for the vehicle\n\n3. **Pricing and Specifications**:\n   - The discontinued RWD model started at $70,000\n   - The Cybertruck AWD starts at $80,000\n   - The RWD version was stripped of key features including: active air suspension, motorized tonneau cover, power outlets in the bed, and one motor\n\n4. **Implementation**: Tesla updated the Cybertruck's online configurator to remove the RWD option and has not replaced it with a new variant.\n\n## Opinions:\n\n**From the article author (Fred Lambert):**\n- Characterizes the Cybertruck as \"a commercial flop\"\n- States the RWD was \"such a bad deal\" and doesn't know anyone who ordered it\n- Notes the small pool of potential buyers didn't want to lose essential features for $10,000 savings\n- Speculates Tesla may attempt an upgrade next year to bring the vehicle closer to original promises\n\n**From top commenter (Philip):**\n- Disputes the 20,000 units/year figure as \"highly unlikely\"\n- Claims Q2 sales were 4,035 units\n- Suggests sustained sales rate looks \"much closer to 10k units a year\"\n- Notes sales have been \"sliding q over q\"\n\n*Note: The commenter's statistics are presented as user-generated content and may not be independently verified.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://insideevs.com/news/772205/tesla-cybertruck-rwd-discontinued-2025/\">\n# Summary of InsideEVs Article: \"The Cheapest Tesla Cybertruck Is Dead\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n1. **Model Discontinuation**: Tesla has discontinued the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) Cybertruck after only five months of orders being available.\n\n2. **Price Impact**: The entry-level model is now the AWD truck, raising the minimum purchase price by $10,000 (a 14% increase). The current entry-level price is $69,990.\n\n3. **Features Removed from RWD Model**: The discontinued budget model had numerous compromises:\n   - No front motor\n   - Lower payload and towing ratings\n   - 51% slower 0-60 MPH time versus AWD\n   - No tonneau cover\n   - No air suspension\n   - 18\" wheels instead of 20\"\n   - Cloth seats (non-ventilated)\n   - Half the number of speakers\n   - No rear screen\n\n4. **Sales Performance**: Deliveries of \"Other Models\" (Cybertruck, Model S, and Model X combined) peaked in Q4 2024, then declined quarter-over-quarter. Q2 2025 showed a 66% drop with just 10,394 units delivered.\n\n5. **Original Projections vs. Reality**: \n   - Originally projected to sell around 250,000 units per year (later reduced to 120,000 units annually)\n   - Claimed to have over two million reservations\n   - Original promised price was $39,990\n\n6. **Competitor Pricing**: \n   - Chevy Silverado Work Truck: $52,800\n   - Ford F-150 Lightning: $54,780\n   - Both are less expensive than the current $69,990 entry-level Cybertruck\n\n**Opinions/Analysis (from article author):**\n\n- The author suggests possible reasons for poor Cybertruck performance include Tesla missing the mark on promised price and performance, or CEO criticism for political involvement\n- Speculation that Tesla may be streamlining production by reducing model variations to increase margins\n- Suggestion that Tesla may be implementing a new pricing strategy that abandons affordability and creates separation between premium and budget-friendly models\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-release-date-update/\">\n# Article Summary: TESLARATI (January 4, 2022)\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n1. **Website Update**: Tesla quietly removed references to a 2022 production estimate from the Cybertruck's order page, likely during the final weeks of 2021.\n\n2. **Previous Language**: The order page previously stated customers would be able to \"complete their configuration as production nears in 2022.\" The updated page simply states customers will complete configurations \"as production nears\" without specifying a year.\n\n3. **Production Timeline Changes**: \n   - The 2022 production date already represented a delay from the initially announced late 2021 production ramp\n   - Delays attributed to supply chain issues and other challenges\n\n4. **2021 Progress**: \n   - Updated prototypes were spotted throughout 2021\n   - Alpha prototypes were built according to Tesla executives\n\n5. **Design Details**: \n   - New alpha prototypes featured an extremely large wiper blade\n   - CEO Elon Musk stated the large wiper blade \"troubles\" him the most and confirmed it would not make it to production\n\n**Opinions from Named Sources:**\n\n- **Elon Musk**: Stated that key Cybertruck updates would be announced in the Q4 and full-year 2021 earnings call; confirmed a quad-motor variant would be released; maintained the Cybertruck would be \"an incredible product\" and potentially \"Tesla's best creation to date\"\n\n- **Tesla advocates on social media** (unnamed/less reliable): Suggested the 2022 estimate may have been removed because the new year was approaching\n\n**Context**: This article is from January 2022, significantly predating the question's timeframe and the background articles provided (which are from 2025).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://insideevs.com/news/586079/tesla-cybertruck-order-europe-removed/\">\n# Summary of \"Tesla Cybertruck No Longer Available For Order Outside The US\"\n\n**Source:** InsideEVs  \n**Author:** Andrei Nedelea\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Order availability change:** The Cybertruck is no longer available for order in Europe. The German Tesla website changed from \"Bestellen\" (Order) to \"Get Updates.\"\n\n2. **Reservation deposits:** European prospective buyers were asked to pay \u20ac100 to reserve a Cybertruck. The article notes Tesla has not officially announced whether these deposits will be returned.\n\n3. **Inventory/backlog situation:** Tesla has reportedly accumulated enough Cybertruck orders accounting for the combined production figure for the next three years. According to Elon Musk, people ordering at that time may not take delivery until 2026.\n\n4. **China market:** Tesla also removed the Cybertruck from its China website.\n\n5. **Historical order page changes:** \n   - In October 2021, Tesla removed powertrain options from the order page\n   - Delivery estimates were moved from \"late 2021\" to \"2022\" before being removed completely\n\n## Opinions/Speculation:\n\n- **Unnamed source (article author speculation):** The reason for removing European and Chinese orders \"could very well be the very high demand it is expected to enjoy in America\"\n- The article states \"We don't know what prompted the manufacturer stop taking Europeans' orders\"\n\n## Source Attribution:\n- The European order change was signaled by @tesla_adri on Twitter (described as \"German Tesla driver and fan\")\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be from an earlier time period (references to 2021-2023 timeframes and future tense about the Cybertruck debut), which predates the background information provided in the forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://mashable.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-timing-removed-2022\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Tesla removes all hints about Cybertruck timing from website\"\n\n**Source:** Mashable  \n**Date:** January 13, 2022\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Website Changes:** Tesla removed production timing information from its Cybertruck order page. The text previously stated \"You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022\" but was changed to remove \"in 2022,\" leaving only \"You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears.\"\n\n2. **Timeline of Changes:** \n   - October 2021: Tesla removed all pricing and model information from the Cybertruck website but kept the 2022 production timing\n   - Around Christmas 2021: The \"2022\" production reference was deleted (based on Internet Archive's Wayback Machine)\n\n3. **Original Announcement:** The Cybertruck was first announced in 2019.\n\n4. **Production Location:** The Cybertruck is planned to be built at Tesla's gigafactory in Austin, Texas, which was still being prepared for car production at the time of the article, with tools and equipment still arriving.\n\n5. **Company Response:** Tesla no longer has a communications team. Neither CEO Elon Musk nor the official Tesla account had tweeted updates about the electric truck at the time.\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article notes that the removal of the 2022 timing reference has caused concern among reservation holders about further production delays, as reported by auto site Edmunds.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a64189316/tesla-reportedly-halting-cybertruck-deliveries-amid-concerns-of-flying-bodywork/\">\n# Summary of Road & Track Article (March 14, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Delivery Delays**: Tesla Cybertruck deliveries are being held back for additional inspection, according to reports from would-be owners.\n\n2. **Body Panel Issues**: The delays come after over a month of reports from existing owners about loose bodywork problems.\n\n3. **Specific Component**: The \"cantrail\" (trim piece along the roofline from A-pillar to bed edge) is reportedly the focus of inspections, according to a screenshot from a service advisor shared by one forum user.\n\n4. **NHTSA Complaints**: There are now four different official NHTSA complaints related to this issue.\n\n5. **Video Evidence**: Owner Reid Tomasko captured footage of a panel flying off his truck at speed and shared it publicly.\n\n6. **Scale of Problem**: Tomasko told Road & Track in February that he had seen the issue on \"five to seven\" different trucks at his wrapping business.\n\n7. **Tesla's Explanation**: According to Tomasko's claims in a subsequent video, Tesla told him the problem was \"glue delamination.\"\n\n8. **No Formal Action**: Tesla has not announced a recall, stop sale, or any other formal delay over the issue as of the article's publication date.\n\n9. **No Official Response**: Road & Track reached out to Tesla for comment but had not received a response at time of publication.\n\n## Note on Sources:\nThe article relies primarily on owner reports from forums and statements from Reid Tomasko, a Cybertruck owner who operates a wrapping business. The claim about Tesla's \"glue delamination\" explanation is secondhand (Tomasko's claim about what Tesla told him).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.arenaev.com/model_y_and_cybertruck_production_stops_workers_go_home_as_tesla_faces_falling_demand-news-4695.php\">\n# Summary of ArenaEV.com Article (May 13, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Production Pauses:**\n- Tesla is adjusting production at its Austin, Texas factory\n- Model Y assembly line workers asked to take a week off or report for cleaning/training duties instead of production\n- Cybertruck production line workers told to take a break during the last week of May\n- Employees described the break as \"longer than usual\"\n- Reports of inconsistent work schedules at Austin plant since February, with workers sent home early on multiple occasions\n- Late last year, Cybertruck line workers were also told to stay home for a few days\n\n**Cybertruck Sales Data:**\n- Tesla sold 38,965 Cybertrucks in 2024 (full year)\n- First-quarter 2025 sales: 6,406 units\n- Q1 2025 represents a \"significant drop\" from Q3 and Q4 2024, when Tesla sold \"more than double that number each quarter\" (implying Q3 and Q4 2024 each exceeded ~12,800 units)\n\n**Production Targets vs. Reality:**\n- Elon Musk once projected annual orders of 250,000 Cybertrucks\n- Tesla later adjusted target to 120,000 units annually\n- Article characterizes even the 120,000 target as \"overly ambitious\" given actual sales\n\n**Overall Tesla Performance:**\n- Global deliveries declined by 13% over the last year (worst in two years)\n- U.S. sales decreased by 5.6%\n- Overall automotive industry saw 7.3% increase in sales (contrasting with Tesla's decline)\n\n**Source Attribution:**\n- Sales data cited from Cox Automotive\n- Employee reports (multiple unnamed employees cited)\n\n## Context:\nThe article frames these production pauses as indicating \"serious issues with demand\" for both the Cybertruck and Model Y, with the Model Y being particularly concerning as Tesla's \"primary revenue driver\" and \"top-selling car.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://electrek.co/2026/01/28/elon-musk-kills-tesla-model-s-x-autonomy/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Elon Musk kills Tesla Model S and Model X because of 'autonomy'\"\n\n**Source:** Electrek  \n**Date:** January 28, 2026  \n**Author:** Fred Lambert\n\n## Key Facts and Announcements:\n\n1. **Discontinuation Announcement:** During Tesla's Q4 2025 earnings call (January 28, 2026), CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will discontinue the Model S and Model X by the end of Q2 2026.\n\n2. **Stated Reason:** Musk cited \"autonomy\" as the reason for discontinuation, though the article notes this seems strange since these vehicles have the same Level 2 autonomous driving capabilities and hardware as other Tesla models.\n\n3. **Production Line Replacement:** The Model S/X production line at Tesla's Fremont, California factory will be replaced by a production line for Tesla's planned humanoid robot, Optimus.\n\n## Sales Data:\n\n**\"Other Models\" Deliveries (includes Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, Model S, and Model X):**\n- Q4 2024: 23,640 units\n- Q1 2025: 12,881 units\n- Q2 2025: 10,394 units\n- Q3 2025: 15,933 units\n- Q4 2025: 11,642 units\n- FY 2025 Total: 50,850 units\n\n**Key Sales Context:**\n- Actual Model S/X numbers estimated to be around 30,000 units for all of 2025\n- Tesla has 100,000 units of annual production capacity for Model S and Model X at Fremont, running at a fraction of that for years\n- By late 2024, sales were estimated below 50,000 units globally\n- Model S/X deliveries had dropped over 30% year-over-year (timeframe not specified)\n\n## Recent Product Updates:\n\n- June 2025: Tesla launched a \"very mild update\" to Model S and Model X\n- Updates included: new paint color, front bumper camera, slightly improved range, and ambient lighting features\n- Accompanied by a $5,000 price increase: Model S to $84,990, Model X to $89,990\n\n## Historical Context:\n\n- Model S launched in 2012, Model X in 2015\n- Tesla stopped breaking out Model S and Model X sales separately in 2023\n- Most recent major refresh was in 2021 (interior refresh with yoke steering wheel)\n\n## Opinions from Named Source (Author/Electrek):\n\n- The June refresh was described as \"an afterthought\" and \"a farewell tour\"\n- Author characterizes the June update as \"embarrassing\" with insufficient improvements to justify the nearly $90,000+ price point\n- Article concludes by asking: \"Is Cybertruck next?\"\n\n## Competitor Information:\n\n- Lucid Air has surpassed Model S\n- Rivian R1S outcompetes Model X\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide latest Tesla SEC filings and Q4 2025 earnings call transcript focusing on Cybertruck guidance. Also include any February 2026 statements from Elon Musk or Tesla spokespeople about Cybertruck future.\nBelow is a consolidated report that covers each component of the original request\u2014(1) the latest Tesla SEC filings that are publicly available, (2) the Q4 2025 earnings-call information with emphasis on any Cybertruck guidance, and (3) statements made in February 2026 by Elon Musk or Tesla representatives that relate to the Cybertruck\u2019s future.  All information is drawn directly from the supplied search results and is cited inline.\n\n1.  Latest Tesla SEC filings\n\na.  Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14-A for the 2025 Annual Meeting  \n   \u2022 Filing date: 7 Nov 2025  \n   \u2022 Key items: Board composition, 2024 executive compensation, and security ownership (pp. 130\u2013160). (Tesla Shareholder Resources, 7 Nov 2025)\n\nb.  Regular stream of Forms 10-Q and 8-K for FY-2025 and early FY-2026  \n   \u2022 The Nasdaq SEC-filings page for ticker \u201cTSLA\u201d confirms availability of all quarterly and current reports, although the specific links did not render in the snippet (Nasdaq filings page, accessed 2026).  \n   \u2022 In particular, the 8-K containing Q4 2025 financial results was furnished 28 Jan 2026 (as inferred from the earnings-call date); that 8-K is the most recent current report on record.\n\nc.  FY-2025 Form 10-K  \n   \u2022 While not shown directly in the snippets, Tesla customarily files its annual 10-K within two business days of the earnings release.  Investors can retrieve it from the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database or Tesla\u2019s IR site; it is not reproduced in the search results and therefore constitutes an information gap noted below.\n\n2.  Q4 2025 earnings-call transcript and Cybertruck guidance\n\nMultiple outlets published a full transcript of the call held on 28 Jan 2026:\n\n\u2022  Motley Fool transcript, 28 Jan 2026 (Motley Fool, 28 Jan 2026)  \n\u2022  Shacknews live transcript placeholder (Shacknews, 28 Jan 2026)\n\nCybertruck-specific commentary from the call is limited.  The prepared remarks and the Q&A focused overwhelmingly on (a) autonomy/Robotaxi rollout, (b) retirement of Model S and Model X, and (c) the Optimus humanoid robot.  Neither the Motley Fool excerpt nor the CNBC written summary contains forward-looking volume, cost, or margin guidance for the Cybertruck line.  The only indirect Cybertruck reference appears in the CNBC article\u2019s companion earnings coverage stating that Cybertruck tooling is underway for the forthcoming \u201cCybercab\u201d robotaxi derivative (CNBC, 28 Jan 2026).  Summarised Cybertruck-relevant points:\n\n\u2022 \u201cTesla said it has begun \u2018tooling\u2019 in advance of production of its forthcoming Cybercab, which is a two-seat, \u2018purpose-built\u2019 driverless car that will not include a steering wheel or pedals.\u201d (CNBC, 28 Jan 2026)  \n\u2022 No numeric delivery outlook, ASP, or margin commentary specific to the standard pickup version of Cybertruck was provided in the transcript excerpts supplied.  \n\nConsequently, Cybertruck guidance during the Q4 2025 call can be characterised as minimal; attention was redirected to robotaxi and Optimus initiatives.\n\n3.  February 2026 statements concerning Cybertruck\n\nThe search results do not surface any official Tesla or Elon Musk statements dated February 2026 that explicitly address the Cybertruck\u2019s future.  Items retrieved for February 2026 deal with:\n\n\u2022 SpaceX Booster-19 cryogenic testing (Tesla Oracle, 9 Feb 2026) \u2013 unrelated to Cybertruck  \n\u2022 Third-party accessory guides for Cybertruck winter/off-road prep (T-Launch blog posts, 4 & 5 Feb 2026) \u2013 not official Tesla communication  \n\nTherefore, there is currently no verifiable February 2026 statement from Musk or any Tesla spokesperson about the Cybertruck\u2019s production ramp, demand outlook, feature roadmap, or strategic positioning.\n\n4.  Identified information gaps\n\na.  Tesla FY-2025 Form 10-K and any 8-K filings in February 2026 that might contain Cybertruck updates are not included in the present results.  \nb.  A full, line-by-line Q&A transcript (beyond the long executive monologue excerpt) is absent; the missing sections could potentially contain additional Cybertruck commentary.  \nc.  Documented public comments by Elon Musk or an authorised Tesla spokesperson in February 2026 with specific reference to Cybertruck\u2014e.g., tweets/X-posts, press interviews, regulatory submissions, or conference appearances\u2014have not been located.\n\n5.  Recommended additional searches (if deeper coverage is required)\n\nGiven the gaps above, targeted follow-up queries would be useful:\n\n\u2022 Google: Tesla Form 10-K 2025 Cybertruck  \n\u2022 Google: Tesla 8-K February 2026 Cybertruck  \n\u2022 Google News: Elon Musk Feb 2026 Cybertruck tweet  \n\u2022 Google News: Tesla spokesperson Feb 2026 Cybertruck production  \n\u2022 Google: site:sec.gov \u201cCybertruck\u201d 2026\n\nExecuting these queries should reveal (i) the full 10-K narrative, (ii) any regulatory 8-K updates filed after 28 Jan 2026, and (iii) any short-form social-media or press comments about Cybertruck made in February 2026.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2022 The newest publicly visible SEC filing is the 7 Nov 2025 definitive proxy; the FY-2025 10-K almost certainly exists but was not surfaced here.  \n\u2022 The 28 Jan 2026 Q4 2025 earnings call offered scant Cybertruck guidance; management instead emphasised autonomy and Optimus.  The only concrete statement was that Cybercab tooling (a derivative) had begun.  \n\u2022 No February 2026 comments from Musk or Tesla spokespeople about Cybertruck were found in the current dataset, highlighting an information gap that would benefit from the additional searches proposed above.</Agent_report>\n"
