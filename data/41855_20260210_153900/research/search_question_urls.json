There's basically no use case.\"\n- Described as potentially \"the worst vehicle ever made\" (if the Reliant Robin didn't exist)\n\n### Unattributed Reports:\n- \"Multiple outlets have reported\" the 10,000+ unit inventory figure\n- \"There are reports\" that SpaceX and xAI are purchasing hundreds or possibly thousands of Cybertrucks to absorb supply and support quarterly sales results\n- This \"further fuels the perception that the Cybertruck is a commercial flop\"\n\n## Technical Innovations Highlighted:\nThe article notes several technological advances introduced with the Cybertruck: 48-volt electrical architecture, giga castings, stainless steel panels (no paint/rust), steer-by-wire system, and rear-wheel steering.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/\">\n# Summary of Elektrek Article (September 13, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Discontinuation**: Tesla discontinued the cheapest Cybertruck variant (rear-wheel-drive model) less than 5 months after launching it in April 2025.\n\n2. **Sales Performance**: \n   - Tesla is currently selling the Cybertruck at a rate of roughly 20,000 units per year\n   - This is significantly below original projections of 250,000 units per year production capacity\n   - Elon Musk had previously stated he believed capacity could reach 500,000 units per year\n   - Tesla claimed to have over 1 million reservations for the vehicle\n\n3. **Pricing and Specifications**:\n   - The discontinued RWD model started at $70,000\n   - The Cybertruck AWD starts at $80,000\n   - The RWD version was stripped of key features including: active air suspension, motorized tonneau cover, power outlets in the bed, and one motor\n\n4. **Implementation**: Tesla updated the Cybertruck's online configurator to remove the RWD option and has not replaced it with a new variant.\n\n## Opinions:\n\n**From the article author (Fred Lambert):**\n- Characterizes the Cybertruck as \"a commercial flop\"\n- States the RWD was \"such a bad deal\" and doesn't know anyone who ordered it\n- Notes the small pool of potential buyers didn't want to lose essential features for $10,000 savings\n- Speculates Tesla may attempt an upgrade next year to bring the vehicle closer to original promises\n\n**From top commenter (Philip):**\n- Disputes the 20,000 units/year figure as \"highly unlikely\"\n- Claims Q2 sales were 4,035 units\n- Suggests sustained sales rate looks \"much closer to 10k units a year\"\n- Notes sales have been \"sliding q over q\"\n\n*Note: The commenter's statistics are presented as user-generated content and may not be independently verified.*\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://insideevs.com/news/772205/tesla-cybertruck-rwd-discontinued-2025/\">\n# Summary of InsideEVs Article: \"The Cheapest Tesla Cybertruck Is Dead\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n1. **Model Discontinuation**: Tesla has discontinued the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) Cybertruck after only five months of orders being available.\n\n2. **Price Impact**: The entry-level model is now the AWD truck, raising the minimum purchase price by $10,000 (a 14% increase). The current entry-level price is $69,990.\n\n3. **Features Removed from RWD Model**: The discontinued budget model had numerous compromises:\n   - No front motor\n   - Lower payload and towing ratings\n   - 51% slower 0-60 MPH time versus AWD\n   - No tonneau cover\n   - No air suspension\n   - 18\" wheels instead of 20\"\n   - Cloth seats (non-ventilated)\n   - Half the number of speakers\n   - No rear screen\n\n4. **Sales Performance**: Deliveries of \"Other Models\" (Cybertruck, Model S, and Model X combined) peaked in Q4 2024, then declined quarter-over-quarter.
