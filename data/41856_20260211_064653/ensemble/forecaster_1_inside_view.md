Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Official/Historical Sources:**
- **history.house.gov** (House historical record): Highest quality official source. Shows Al Green censured March 6, 2025 (224-198-2) - this occurred BEFORE the question opening date of Feb 11, 2026, so does NOT satisfy the resolution criteria which asks about events between Feb 11-April 1, 2026.
- **GovTrack Database**: High quality legislative tracking. Confirms García disapproval passed 236-183 in January 2026 (also before question opening), Mills censure referred to Ethics 310-303 in November 2025.

**Major News Outlets (November 2025):**
- **WSJ, NYT, Roll Call** (Nov 21-22, 2025): High quality, reporting on "chaos week" with 5 censure attempts. Key factual elements: García censured, Plaskett/Mills attempts failed. Expert opinion from Sarah Binder (GWU) on structural incentives is credible and relevant.
- **TIME** (Nov 21, 2025): Confirms same events, provides historical context (22 censures in first 200 years vs. 5 this decade).

**Recent News (Feb 2026):**
- **KSAT/AP** (Feb 10, 2026): Reports on ICE funding negotiations - NOT directly relevant to censure question but shows current congressional tensions.
- **TheBlaze** (Feb 10, 2026): Reports Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) facing felony assault charges for allegedly attacking ICE officers, asked ICE director about hell during hearing. Chairman Garbarino reprimanded her for violating decorum. This is MODERATE evidence - shows ongoing misconduct but no formal censure resolution filed yet.

**AskNews Articles:**
- Multiple articles about **state legislatures** (Tennessee, Texas, Maine) - NOT RELEVANT to U.S. House question.
- **Ghislaine Maxwell testimony** (Feb 9-10, 2026): She refused to testify before House committee. NOT directly relevant to member discipline.
- **Congress censure trend articles** (Nov 2025): Confirm the surge, Beyer-Bacon reform proposal, bipartisan frustration. Strong factual basis.
- **Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion effort** (Nov 26, 2025): Rep. Steube filed legislation to expel her following $5M fraud indictment. This is STRONG evidence of pending action, though expulsion requires 2/3 vote (historically rare).

**Critical Finding:** The question asks about resolutions passing between Feb 11-April 1, 2026. All the censures mentioned (Green, García, etc.) occurred BEFORE Feb 11, 2026, so they don't satisfy the criteria.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG Evidence:**
1. **Structural incentives unchanged**: Multiple independent sources (Roll Call, Independent, Yahoo) confirm any single member can force privileged resolution vote. Sarah Binder (expert) explains this appeals to rank-and-file as "one of the few things they can do on their own." This mechanism remains active.
2. **Active pending cases with serious allegations**: 
   - Cory Mills: Two censure resolutions, Ethics subcommittee formed Jan 2026, allegations include assault/stolen valor
   - Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick: Federal indictment for $5M fraud, expulsion legislation filed
   - LaMonica McIver: Felony assault charges, confrontational behavior in Feb 2026 hearing
3. **Jeffries statement**: Minority Leader explicitly said Democrats have "long list of Republicans worthy of censure" and won't "unilaterally disarm" - direct indication of intent.

**MODERATE Evidence:**
1. **Recent momentum**: García disapproval passed in January 2026, just weeks before question period begins
2. **Failed reform**: Beyer-Bacon 60% threshold proposal exists but hasn't passed, suggesting status quo continues
3. **Short timeframe**: 49 days limits opportunities but is sufficient for privileged resolutions (2-day rule)

**WEAK Evidence:**
1. **"Fatigue" claims**: Anecdotal member complaints about chaos
2. **Recent failures**: Plaskett/Omar censures failed, but doesn't predict future attempts
3. **McIver incident**: While showing tensions, no formal resolution filed yet

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 11 - April 1, 2026 = **49 days** (7 weeks)

**If halved to ~3.5 weeks**: Probability would drop to ~35-40%. Less time for pending cases to mature, fewer opportunities for new incidents.

**If doubled to ~14 weeks**: Probability would increase to ~70-75%. More time for Mills Ethics investigation to conclude, more opportunities for new privileged resolutions, higher chance Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion reaches floor.

The 7-week window is long enough for one or two actions but short enough that timing matters significantly.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate: 52%** (derived from post-June 2023 rate of ~2.3 censures/year over 1.6 months, adjusted for active cases)

**Factors Supporting UPWARD adjustment (+10-15%):**
1. **Mills case specificity**: Unlike generic base rate, we have TWO active resolutions plus formal Ethics subcommittee investigation ongoing as of January 2026. Historical pattern shows Ethics investigations often lead to floor action.
2. **Cherfilus-McCormick federal indictment**: Criminal charges are historically strong predictor of congressional action (see Santos precedent). Expulsion legislation already filed.
3. **McIver incident**: Fresh misconduct (Feb 10, 2026) with chairman's public reprimand suggests potential for privileged resolution.
4. **Jeffries commitment**: Direct statement of intent from leadership carries more weight than generic trend.

**Factors Supporting DOWNWARD adjustment (-5-10%):**
1. **Recent failures**: 2 of 3 November attempts failed, suggesting higher bar than attempt rate implies
2. **Timing uncertainty**: Ethics investigations can take months; Mills subcommittee formed only in January
3. **Expulsion difficulty**: Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion requires 2/3 vote (only 6 in history); more likely to stall

**Net Adjustment**: +5-10% from base rate of 52% → **57-62% range**

However, I must account for overconfidence bias. The base rate already incorporated active cases. The additional specific information about Mills/Cherfilus-McCormick/McIver is valuable but may not warrant full additional adjustment since the base rate was derived from a period with similar dynamics.

**Calibrated Inside View: 58%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from 52% outside view, the specific pending cases (Mills with two resolutions + Ethics investigation, Cherfilus-McCormick with federal indictment + expulsion legislation, McIver fresh incident) provide concrete mechanisms for resolution. The 49-day window is sufficient for privileged resolutions but tight for Ethics conclusions.

The key question: Will at least ONE of these cases (or an unexpected new one) result in a passed resolution?
- Mills censure: ~25-30% (strong allegations, but recent failures show difficulty)
- Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion: ~15-20% (serious charges, but 2/3 threshold very high)
- McIver or other new case: ~15-20% (fresh incident, but no resolution filed yet)
- Combined probability (accounting for some overlap): ~58%

This represents a modest upward adjustment from the base rate, reflecting that we have specific catalysts while respecting that most attempts fail.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the US House pass a censure, expulsion, or reprimand resolution against a sitting member between Feb 11-April 1, 2026 (49 days)?

2. **Base rate**: 52% from post-June 2023 acceleration period (~2.3/year) over 1.6 months, adjusted for active cases.

3. **Consistency**: "58 out of 100 times, the House passes at least one disciplinary resolution in this 49-day window." This aligns with having 2-3 strong pending cases plus possibility of new incidents, where each has 15-30% individual probability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Mills: Two censure resolutions + Ethics subcommittee (Jan 2026) + serious allegations
   - Cherfilus-McCormick: Federal indictment + expulsion legislation filed
   - McIver: Felony charges + Feb 10 confrontational hearing
   - Jeffries: "Long list" statement indicating Democratic intent
   - Structural: Privileged resolution mechanism remains unchanged

5. **Blind spot**: Mills Ethics investigation concludes with exoneration or insufficient evidence, Cherfilus-McCormick case delays beyond April 1, McIver incident doesn't generate formal resolution, and no new incidents occur. This could drop probability to ~30-35%.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is "high tension but most attempts fail." The 58% prediction slightly favors action over inaction, which seems appropriate given multiple specific pending cases rather than just trend extrapolation. A small nudge toward 55% might be warranted for conservatism, but the specific cases justify staying at 58%.

Probability: 58%
