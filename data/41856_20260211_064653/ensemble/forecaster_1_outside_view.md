## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Historical annual rate of House discipline actions (all time)**
   - Suitability: LOW - historical rates too slow given recent acceleration
   - 28 censures over 190+ years = ~0.15/year historically

2. **Recent period (2021-2025) showing acceleration**
   - Suitability: HIGH - most relevant to current political climate
   - 5 censures in ~4 years (Gosar 2021, Schiff 2023, Tlaib 2023, Bowman 2023, Green 2025)
   - Rate: ~1.25 censures/year

3. **Post-June 2023 "new normal" period**
   - Suitability: VERY HIGH - captures the regime change noted by experts
   - 4 censures in ~21 months (June 2023-March 2025)
   - Rate: ~2.3 censures/year

4. **November 2025 "chaos week" extrapolated**
   - Suitability: MEDIUM-LOW - likely represents peak chaos, not sustainable rate
   - 5 attempts in one week, but most failed

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Post-June 2023 period, adjusted for the specific dynamics of late 2025/early 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: February 11, 2026 to April 1, 2026 = **49 days** (~7 weeks, ~1.6 months)

**Critical Discovery**: Al Green was already censured on March 6, 2025, which is approximately 11 months BEFORE the question opened on February 11, 2026. However, the question asks about events occurring "before April 1, 2026" - meaning it's asking about FUTURE events from the question opening date.

**Wait - Re-reading the question**: "This question resolves as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States House of Representatives passes a resolution censuring, expelling or reprimanding a sitting Representative."

The question opened February 11, 2026. It asks about events "before April 1, 2026." This is asking: will any such resolution pass between NOW (Feb 11, 2026) and April 1, 2026?

**Historical patterns over similar ~7-week periods:**
- In the "new normal" era (post-June 2023), we've seen ~2.3 censures/year
- 2.3 censures/year = 0.19 censures/month = 0.30 censures per 1.6 months
- But November 2025 showed unprecedented activity with 5 attempts in one week

**Current pending matters as of February 11, 2026:**
- Cory Mills: Two censure resolutions pending, under active Ethics investigation (subcommittee formed January 2026)
- Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick: Expulsion proposed following federal indictment
- Nancy Mace: Under Ethics investigation (January 2026)
- Mike Collins: Ethics referral published (January 2026)

## (d) Justification

The evidence strongly suggests a regime change in House discipline practices beginning in June 2023. Expert Sarah Binder notes that privileged resolutions appeal to rank-and-file members as "one of the few things they can do on their own." Multiple members and experts describe the current environment as "chaotic," a "political baseball bat," and note that "Democrats are not going to unilaterally disarm."

**Key factors supporting a YES outcome:**

1. **Accelerating trend**: 4 censures in 21 months (June 2023-March 2025) vs. 4 in the prior 20 years
2. **Active pending cases**: Multiple members under investigation or facing privileged resolutions as of January-February 2026
3. **Structural incentives**: Single members can force votes; no leadership veto
4. **Political environment**: Minority Leader Jeffries explicitly stated Democrats have "a long list of Republicans worthy of censure"
5. **Recent precedent**: García disapproval passed in January 2026 (just weeks before question opening)
6. **Mills case momentum**: Two separate censure resolutions, active Ethics investigation with subcommittee formed January 2026, serious allegations including assault and stolen valor

**Key factors supporting a NO outcome:**

1. **Reform pressure**: Beyer-Bacon resolution with 29 co-sponsors seeking 60% threshold
2. **Fatigue**: Multiple sources note members are "tired" of the chaos
3. **Failed attempts**: Omar, Plaskett censures both failed in 2025
4. **Short timeframe**: Only 49 days for a vote to occur
5. **Legislative calendar**: Limited floor time

**Probabilistic assessment:**
- Base rate from post-June 2023 period: ~30% chance in a 1.6-month window
- Adjustment for active pending cases: +20-25%
- Adjustment for recent failures and reform pressure: -10-15%
- Adjustment for Mills case specifics (serious allegations, bipartisan Ethics investigation, two pending resolutions): +15-20%

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of ~30% (from 2.3 censures/year over 1.6 months) provides an anchor, but several factors warrant upward adjustment:

1. **Multiple active triggers**: At least 3-4 members face serious allegations with pending or likely privileged resolutions
2. **Recent momentum**: García disapproval passed just weeks before the question period
3. **Mills case**: Particularly strong - two resolutions, formal Ethics subcommittee, serious criminal allegations
4. **Time remaining**: 49 days is sufficient for privileged resolutions (2-day rule)

However, calibration must account for:
1. **Selection bias in recent activity**: November 2025 may represent peak chaos, not typical rate
2. **Failed attempts**: 2 of 3 recent censure attempts failed
3. **Possible deterrent effect**: The very chaos may be building pressure for restraint

The question asks for a binary outcome over 49 days. Given:
- Base rate suggests ~30% from trend alone
- Multiple active cases add ~20-25% 
- But recent failures and reform pressure subtract ~10%
- Net adjustment: +10-15% from base

This yields approximately 40-45% probability. However, the Mills case specifically presents a strong catalyst - formal Ethics investigation, bipartisan subcommittee, two pending resolutions, serious allegations. This single case alone might carry 25-30% probability of resulting in discipline.

Considering the Mills case plus other possibilities (Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion, potential new cases), and accounting for the short timeframe limiting opportunities, a probability in the 48-55% range seems appropriate.

Given the uncertainty and the historical rate of unexpected outcomes in congressional discipline (many proposed actions fail), I'll calibrate toward the middle-lower end of this range to avoid overconfidence.
