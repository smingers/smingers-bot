## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary News Sources (November 2025):**
- **Roll Call (Nov 21, 2025)**: High-quality congressional trade publication. Reports 5 censure attempts in one week, with García successfully censured, Plaskett/Mills failed. Factual vote counts and procedural details; opinions clearly attributed to named lawmakers. **Quality: High**

- **TIME (Nov 21, 2025)**: Major news outlet. Confirms García censure passed, Plaskett/Mills failed. Provides historical context (22 censures in first 200 years vs. 5 this decade). Facts well-documented; expert opinions absent. **Quality: High**

- **WSJ & NYT (Nov 22, 2025)**: Both top-tier sources covering the same week. WSJ focuses on interpersonal drama (Mace-Mills confrontation); NYT on institutional degradation. Both factual on votes/resolutions; opinions from lawmakers, not independent experts. **Quality: High**

**Recent Legislative Activity:**
- **TheBlaze (Feb 10, 2026)**: Reports Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) facing felony assault charges attacked ICE Director verbally in hearing. Chairman reprimanded her for violating decorum but no censure resolution filed yet. Factual on charges/hearing; no expert analysis. **Quality: Medium**

- **Alternet (Nov 28, 2025)**: Progressive outlet reporting Rep. Judy Chu calling censure trend "not normal," advocating reform. Beyer/Bacon bipartisan proposal for 60% threshold mentioned. Mix of facts and partisan framing. **Quality: Medium**

- **Yahoo/Independent (Nov 28, 2025)**: Multiple outlets reporting same story: 3 censure votes in one week matched entire 118th Congress total. Beyer/Bacon reform proposal detailed. Factual core reliable; some opinion from former Rep. Comstock (not current expert). **Quality: Medium-High**

**Ethics Committee Activity:**
- **The Hill (Dec 4, 2025)**: Opinion piece by congressional veteran Don Wolfensberger. Reports Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned effective Jan 5, 2026. Steube filed expulsion resolution against Cherfilus-McCormick (indicted for $5M FEMA fraud). Mills censure referred to Ethics Committee (310-103 vote). **Quality: Medium (opinion piece but factually grounded)**

- **Center Square Florida (Nov 26, 2025)**: Reports Steube pursuing expulsion of Cherfilus-McCormick but won't push vote until Ethics Committee acts. Ethics Committee formed investigative subcommittee on Mills Nov 19. **Quality: Medium**

**Irrelevant Sources:**
- KSAT articles (Feb 10-11, 2026): About ICE funding negotiations and housing policy—no discipline content
- SCOTUSblog (May 20, 2025): Maine state legislature censure—wrong jurisdiction
- Peru/Japan/China articles: Wrong countries entirely

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (for Yes outcome):**
1. **Active Ethics investigations**: Mills investigation has formal subcommittee (formed Nov 19, 2025). Historical pattern: Santos expelled Dec 2023 after Ethics report; Bowman censured Dec 2023 after investigation. Ethics reports often trigger floor votes within 2-4 weeks of release.

2. **Pending expulsion resolution**: Steube's Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion resolution filed but awaiting Ethics Committee action. While expulsion requires 2/3 (historically rare), the resolution's existence creates a path to floor action if committee reports before April 1.

3. **Institutional momentum**: 3 censure votes in one week (Nov 2025) demonstrates procedural ease. Any member can force privileged vote. Recent pattern shows clustering after recess periods—House has 3 session weeks remaining before April 1.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (for Yes outcome):**
1. **McIver incident (Feb 10, 2026)**: Facing felony charges + violated decorum in hearing. Chairman's public reprimand could escalate to formal censure resolution, especially if charges progress. However, no resolution filed yet.

2. **Reform backlash**: Beyer/Bacon 60% threshold proposal (29 co-sponsors) indicates desire to slow censures, but hasn't passed. Until reform enacted, current simple-majority rules enable continued activity.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
1. **Partisan temperature**: Jeffries quote about "long list of Republicans worthy of censure" suggests Democrats may retaliate, but this is strategic posturing, not concrete action.

2. **Greene resignation (Jan 5, 2026)**: Removes one frequent censure-filer from chamber, potentially reducing activity. But many other members have filed resolutions.

**STRONG EVIDENCE (against Yes outcome):**
1. **Calendar constraints**: Only ~15 legislative days remain (House schedule shows 3 weeks in session Feb-March). Ethics investigations typically take months; Mills subcommittee formed Nov 19 but no report released by Feb 11 (2.5+ months).

2. **Expulsion threshold**: Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion requires 2/3 vote. Only 6 members expelled in history; Santos (2023) had overwhelming bipartisan Ethics condemnation. Current 220-215 GOP majority makes 2/3 (290 votes) nearly impossible without extraordinary circumstances.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Time remaining**: February 11 to April 1, 2026 = 49 days = ~7 weeks, with only 3 weeks in session.

**If timeframe halved (24 days)**: Probability would drop to ~10%. Ethics reports rarely emerge in <1 month; procedural calendar too compressed.

**If timeframe doubled (98 days, ~4 months)**: Probability would rise to ~35-40%. Mills Ethics report likely released; more session weeks for privileged resolutions; higher chance of new incidents triggering censure attempts.

Current 49-day window is marginal—long enough for one fast-tracked action but too short for typical Ethics timeline.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View (18%)

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. **Active investigations with institutional momentum**: Mills Ethics subcommittee is 2.5 months into investigation. Historical precedent (Santos, Bowman) shows reports can trigger votes within weeks. This is a concrete, near-term catalyst absent from the base-rate calculation.

2. **Pending resolutions**: Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion resolution exists and awaits only Ethics Committee action. While expulsion is unlikely, censure could substitute if committee finds wrongdoing.

3. **Recent clustering pattern**: The Nov 2025 cluster (5 attempts in 5 days) occurred after a long recess. House returns from President's Day recess Feb 24—similar conditions could trigger new activity.

4. **McIver incident (Feb 10)**: Fresh controversy with both criminal charges and decorum violation. While no resolution filed yet, the 24-48 hour news cycle could prompt a privileged resolution this week.

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. **Compressed calendar**: Only 15 legislative days vs. the 49 calendar days suggests effective time is ~30% of nominal window. Base rate should be adjusted downward proportionally.

2. **Reform momentum**: Beyer/Bacon proposal with 29 co-sponsors indicates institutional fatigue. Leadership may discourage new censure attempts to avoid further embarrassment, though this is speculative.

3. **Expulsion impracticality**: Steube explicitly said he won't push expulsion vote until Ethics acts. Committee historically takes 3-6 months for major investigations; unlikely to report by April 1.

**Net assessment**: The Mills investigation is the strongest concrete factor—it's active, has a subcommittee, and fits the historical pattern of Ethics reports triggering floor votes. However, the compressed calendar and expulsion's high threshold create significant friction. McIver incident adds a second potential catalyst but requires someone to file a resolution.

Weighing these factors: The active Mills investigation and pending Cherfilus-McCormick resolution represent structural changes from the base-rate period (2020-2025), when most censures arose from ad-hoc privileged resolutions without prior Ethics activity. The current situation has more "loaded guns" but a shorter fuse.

**Adjustment**: Increase from 18% baseline to 28-32% range to account for active investigations and pending resolutions, but temper enthusiasm due to calendar constraints and expulsion's impracticality.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of **18%**, I adjust upward based on:

1. **Mills Ethics investigation** (+8%): Active subcommittee, 2.5 months in, fits historical pattern of reports triggering votes. Most significant factor.

2. **Cherfilus-McCormick pending resolution** (+3%): Exists but requires Ethics action; more likely to result in censure than expulsion.

3. **McIver fresh incident** (+2%): Recent controversy could prompt privileged resolution, though none filed yet.

4. **Compressed calendar** (-3%): Only 15 legislative days reduces effective opportunity window.

**Net adjustment**: +10 percentage points → **28%**

This reflects genuine uncertainty: slightly better than 1-in-4 odds that at least one action occurs, driven primarily by the Mills investigation's potential to report before April 1.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will US House pass censure/expulsion/reprimand resolution for any sitting member before April 1, 2026 (49 days)?

2. **Base rate**: 18% from 2020-2025 reference class (1.17 actions/year × 0.134 years).

3. **Consistency**: "28 out of 100 times, the House passes at least one disciplinary resolution in the next 49 days." This aligns with having 1-2 active investigations plus recent clustering pattern but accounts for calendar constraints.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Mills Ethics subcommittee formed Nov 19, 2025; historical pattern shows reports trigger votes within weeks
   - Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion resolution pending Ethics Committee action (indicted Nov 19, 2025)
   - Only 15 legislative days remain; Ethics reports typically take 3-6 months
   - McIver incident Feb 10, 2026 with criminal charges + decorum violation could prompt privileged resolution
   - Nov 2025 cluster (5 attempts in 5 days) shows procedural ease and partisan willingness

5. **Blind spot**: Mills Ethics Committee deliberately delays report past April 1 to avoid election-year controversy, OR McIver incident prompts immediate privileged resolution this week that I'm underweighting. First scenario would drop probability to ~15%; second would raise to ~40%.

6. **Status quo**: Recent trend is elevated censure activity (7 actions 2020-2025 vs. historical 0.19/year). However, institutional fatigue (Beyer/Bacon reform) and leadership desire to "move on" from Nov 2025 chaos suggests modest reversion toward lower activity. Calendar compression reinforces status quo of "no action" being modal outcome. Slight downward adjustment already incorporated in conservative estimate.

**Probability: 28%**
