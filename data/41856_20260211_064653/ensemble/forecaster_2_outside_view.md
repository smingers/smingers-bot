Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Historical House Discipline Records (history.house.gov):**
- High-quality official government source documenting all expulsions (6 total), censures (28-29 total), and reprimands (10 total) since 1789
- Shows recent acceleration: 5 censures from 2021-2025 (Gosar, Schiff, Tlaib, Bowman, Green)
- Al Green censured March 6, 2025 (224-198 vote) - this is a PAST event that already satisfies the question criteria
- Factual record with no opinion content

**GovTrack Misconduct Database:**
- Comprehensive database tracking 506 instances of misconduct
- Documents multiple ongoing investigations as of January 2026:
  - Rep. Cory Mills: Investigation opened January 2026 with Investigative Subcommittee formed; censure resolution previously referred to Ethics (310-303 vote in November 2025)
  - Rep. Nancy Mace: Investigation announced January 2026
  - Rep. Mike Collins: Ethics published OCC referral January 2026
  - Rep. García: Resolution of disapproval PASSED 236-183 in January 2026
- Al Green censure confirmed: March 6, 2025 (224-198)
- Factual database with documented sources

**News Articles (WSJ, NYT, Roll Call - November 2025):**
- Document chaotic period with multiple censure attempts in one week
- Roll Call (November 21, 2025) notes: "Four lawmakers have been censured since June 2023 — more than in the 20 years prior to that combined"
- Reports five censure-related attempts in one week alone
- Quotes from multiple members expressing concern about weaponization of censure process
- Rep. Beyer/Bacon proposal to require 60% threshold (29 co-sponsors) - not yet passed
- Mix of factual reporting and member opinions; opinions from identifiable sources (members of Congress, political scientists)

**Agent Report on 119th Congress Privileged Resolutions:**
- Most critical source for current status
- Documents that **Al Green was already censured on March 6, 2025** (Roll-call 62, 224-198-2 vote)
- Shows multiple other attempts: Omar (failed via tabling motion), Plaskett (rejected), García (disapproval passed 236-183)
- Multiple pending resolutions for Mills, potential Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion
- Notes House continues to allow single-member privileged motions

**State-level articles (Maine Rep. Libby):**
- Not relevant - concerns state legislature, not U.S. House

**Critical Finding:** The question asks if the House will censure, expel, or reprimand any member "before April 1, 2026." Today is February 11, 2026. **Al Green was already censured on March 6, 2025** - nearly a year ago. This ALREADY satisfies the resolution criteria.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

Given that the question has already been satisfied, the relevant analysis is confirming this fact rather than predicting future events.

However, for completeness:
- **Reference Class 1:** Recent censure rate (2021-2025) - 5 censures in ~4 years = ~1.25/year
- **Reference Class 2:** 119th Congress specific activity - Multiple privileged resolutions filed, high partisan tension
- **Reference Class 3:** Historical base rate - 28-29 censures over 234 years = ~0.12/year

The 2021-2025 period shows dramatically elevated rates compared to historical averages, suggesting a new normal of weaponized censure votes.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

- Question opened: February 11, 2026
- Resolution date: April 1, 2026
- Remaining time: ~49 days
- **But the critical event (Al Green censure) occurred March 6, 2025 - 342 days before question opening**

The question asks about events "before April 1, 2026" - this is a backward-looking criterion that includes all of 2025 and early 2026.

(d) **Justification:**

The question resolution criteria state: "This question resolves as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States House of Representatives passes a resolution censuring, expelling or reprimanding a sitting Representative."

**Al Green was censured on March 6, 2025** (Roll-call 62, 224-198-2 vote) for disrupting the President's Joint Address on March 4, 2025. This is documented in:
1. The official House history website
2. The GovTrack database
3. The Agent Report on 119th Congress resolutions

This event occurred well before April 1, 2026, and therefore the resolution criteria have already been satisfied. The question should resolve as "Yes" with certainty.

Additionally, Rep. García received a formal disapproval resolution that passed 236-183 in January 2026, though "disapproval" may be considered distinct from censure/reprimand depending on House procedural interpretation.

Outside view calibration:

The question asks about an event occurring "before April 1, 2026." Today is February 11, 2026. The event (Al Green's censure) occurred on March 6, 2025 - nearly a year ago and well within the timeframe specified by the question.

This is not a probabilistic forecast but a verification of historical fact. The resolution criteria have been definitively satisfied. Multiple authoritative sources confirm this event occurred.

The only remaining uncertainty would be:
1. Whether the sources are somehow mistaken (extremely unlikely given multiple independent confirmations)
2. Whether "censure" as applied to Al Green meets the technical definition (it does - it was a formal censure resolution that passed)
3. Whether there's some procedural technicality that invalidates it (no evidence of this)

Given the overwhelming documentary evidence from official House records, government databases, and contemporaneous reporting, the probability that the resolution criteria have been satisfied is effectively certain.
