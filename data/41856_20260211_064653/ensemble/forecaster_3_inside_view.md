Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / criteria (≤30 words)
Resolves **Yes** if the House **passes a resolution** to **censure, expel, or reprimand** a **sitting Representative** at any time **before Apr 1, 2026**; otherwise **No**.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinion)
- **House History (history.house.gov) discipline list** (official House institutional record; high reliability; updated through at least **Mar 2025** per excerpt).
  - **Facts:** Lists formal disciplinary actions (expulsion/censure/reprimand) with dates and vote totals, including **Al Green censured Mar 6, 2025**.
  - **Opinion:** None (reference document).
- **Roll Call (Nov 21, 2025)** (reputable congressional trade press; high quality for process reporting).
  - **Facts:** Reports multiple censure attempts; notes Ethics Committee activity; describes a surge in privileged resolutions.
  - **Opinion:** Quotes members/political scientist about “weaponization”; useful for context, not required for resolution.
- **TIME (Nov 21, 2025)** (mainstream outlet; good for summarizing events; moderate-high reliability).
  - **Facts:** States Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García was **successfully censured** that week; provides vote breakdown; also notes failed efforts vs Plaskett and Mills.
  - **Opinion:** Narrative framing about political climate.
- **WSJ / NYT (Nov 22, 2025)** (top-tier outlets; high reliability).
  - **Facts:** Describe the procedural mechanism (privileged resolutions) and the spate of censure attempts.
  - **Opinion:** Characterizations of “chaos/poisonous climate.”
- **AskNews items (Feb 2026)**:
  - **TheBlaze item about Rep. McIver**: partisan outlet; low-moderate reliability; not directly about House discipline outcomes.
  - Several foreign/non-US-House pieces (Peru, Japan, China, Tennessee legislature): irrelevant to the resolution criteria.
  - Overall: little direct evidentiary value for whether the US House passed a qualifying resolution.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)
Strong evidence:
- **Official House History record** indicates the House **already censured Rep. Al Green on Mar 6, 2025**, which is **before Apr 1, 2026** and matches the resolution wording (a passed censure resolution against a sitting Representative).
- **Multiple independent confirmations** (House History + major-media retrospectives in Nov 2025 describing censures as recent/commonplace) reinforce that such actions occurred in the relevant window.

Moderate evidence:
- **TIME (Nov 2025)** reports **a successful censure of Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García** (also before Apr 1, 2026). Even if one disputed one case, the Al Green case alone suffices.

Weak evidence:
- General claims about “censure wars,” reform proposals to raise thresholds, and unrelated committee-decorum disputes—contextual but not needed once a qualifying discipline event is confirmed.

Key inference:
- Under the criteria as written (“before Apr 1, 2026” with no start date), the event threshold appears to have been met already, making this essentially a verification problem rather than a forward-looking forecast.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining until resolution: **~49 days** (Feb 11 → Apr 1, 2026).
- If the window were halved/doubled: it wouldn’t materially change the forecast **given a qualifying event already occurred in 2025**. The only way timeframe matters is if the platform intended an implicit “from now until Apr 1, 2026” window; the written criteria provided do not state that.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
- Outside view base rate (your prior): **99.2%** (driven by “already happened” logic).
- Inside view: I move slightly **upward** because the **House History** page is an official institutional record with vote totals and dates—about as definitive as one can get absent the raw House Journal entry. The remaining uncertainty is almost entirely about *interpretation/administrative framing* (e.g., whether some adjudicator mistakenly applies a “from opening date” rule despite the written text), not about the underlying historical fact.

Probability calibration
- Status quo / “if nothing changed”: The House has **already** passed at least one qualifying censure resolution within the stated “before Apr 1, 2026” window → points to **Yes** with near-certainty.
- Main downward pressure: a plausible “gotcha” where the *intended* evaluation window is **Feb 11–Apr 1, 2026 only**, contrary to the literal criteria text shown here. I treat that as a *small but non-zero* risk to my forecasted probability for how this question will be *resolved*.
- Net: near-certain Yes, but not 100% due to potential administrative/interpretation mismatch.

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: Yes iff House passes censure/expel/reprimand resolution against a sitting Rep **before Apr 1, 2026**.
2) Outside view base rate: **99.2%**.
3) Consistency line: **997 out of 1000 times**, a qualifying discipline resolution occurred before Apr 1, 2026 (and we have records that it did).
4) Top evidence (3–5):
   - House History lists **Al Green censured Mar 6, 2025** (official record).
   - Multiple major outlets (Roll Call/TIME) document multiple censure actions/attempts in late 2025.
   - TIME reports **García successfully censured** (additional redundancy).
5) Blind spot: The resolver applies an unstated rule “only actions after Feb 11, 2026 count,” making past censures irrelevant; this would drop probability substantially.
6) Status quo outcome: Given recorded past censures in-window, status quo strongly implies **Yes**.

Probability: 99.7%
