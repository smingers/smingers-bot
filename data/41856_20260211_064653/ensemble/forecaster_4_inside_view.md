Analysis:

1. Question restatement  
“Between today (11 Feb 2026) and 1 Apr 2026 (≈ 49 days), will the U.S. House PASS a resolution that censures, reprimands, or expels a sitting member?”

2. Source analysis (quality, fact vs opinion, date)  
• History.House.gov list (updated Mar-25): definitive, non-partisan tally of every expulsion, censure, reprimand. Pure fact.  
• Roll Call 21-Nov-25, WSJ & NYT 22-Nov-25, TIME 21-Nov-25: reputable Hill-focused outlets describing the November “censure week.” Fact reporting of votes (García censured 224-198 etc.). Opinions limited to quoted lawmakers.  
• KSAT/AP 10-Feb-26 (budget fight) & other AskNews pieces: reputable but contain no discipline activity; only contextualise partisan climate.  
• The Blaze 10-Feb-26 (McIver committee outburst) & Center Square 26-Nov-25 (Cherfilus-McCormick indictment/expulsion threat): ideologically tinged but provide factual allegations supported by court filings or roll-call numbers.  
Overall, hard data on past discipline (History list, TIME, Roll Call) = strong quality. Reports of pending or threatened actions = moderate; committee-room flare-ups = weak.

3. Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence (structural / historical):  
• Privileged-resolution rule lets ANY member force a floor vote within two legislative days – unchanged and still being used (Roll Call, WSJ).  
• Post-2021 step-change: five censures in 33 months ⇒ ≈1.5/yr (History list) – much higher than pre-2021 (<0.1/yr).  

Moderate evidence (current pipeline / momentum):  
• One member already formally indicted (Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick); an expulsion motion is filed and Ethics Sub-committee working – raises chance a report or alternative censure is offered before Apr 1.  
• Rep. Cory Mills under active Ethics investigation; referring resolution received 310 votes – shows bipartisan appetite for some sanction if findings emerge quickly.  
• Polarised atmosphere continues (budget/ICE fight; McIver assault indictment & decorum breach). Partisan incentives for symbolic punishment stay high.

Weak evidence (dampeners):  
• Increasing cross-party fatigue – 29 cosponsors (Beyer–Bacon resolution) seek to raise censure threshold; leadership calls the practice “nonsense.” Even if the reform is not adopted, leaders may pressure colleagues to table future attempts.  
• Ethics investigations often move slowly; 49-day window may be too short for committee reports that give wavering members cover, especially for a 2/3 expulsion.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Window = seven weeks. If it were doubled to 14 weeks, I would raise the probability roughly 1.6× (to mid-40 %). If halved to 3.5 weeks, I would cut it about one-third (to ~9 %), reflecting session days available.

5. Justification & adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view base rate (post-2021 frequency): 17.8 %.  
Adjust upward:  
+4 % Privileged resolutions remain easy & routinely used.  
+5 % Two high-salience, bipartisan-irritating cases on docket (Cherfilus-McCormick indictment; Mills probe).  
+2 % General partisan heat (budget confrontations, decorum incidents) makes at least one symbolic vote attractive.  
Adjust downward:  
-1 % Leadership pushback & nascent reform effort.  
Net inside-view estimate ≈ 28 %.

Consistency sentence: “Roughly 28 out of 100 times, between now and 1 Apr 2026 the House would successfully censure, reprimand, or expel a member.”

Key evidence bullets (≤20 words each)  
• Five censures 2021-Mar 2025 → 1.5/yr modern base rate.  
• Privileged-resolution rule allows near-instant floor votes.  
• Indicted Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick already faces filed expulsion/censure efforts.  
• Ethics subcommittee investigating Rep. Mills after 310-vote referral.  
• 29-member bipartisan bloc seeks to curb censures, signalling growing resistance.

Blind-spot scenario  
A sudden Ethics report on either Cherfilus-McCormick or Mills lands, triggering overwhelming bipartisan censure the same day – probability would jump to >70 %.

Status-quo outcome  
No resolution passes; business focuses on DHS funding. Historical inertia still favours “No,” hence sub-50 % forecast.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that the House censures, expels, or reprimands a member before 1 Apr 2026: 28 %.
