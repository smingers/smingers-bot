Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wall Street Journal, 22 Nov 2025 – Factual reporting on a week-long flurry of censure/expulsion resolutions and on-floor confrontations.  Reputable national paper; story written the week the events occurred, therefore a high-quality, contemporaneous source.  Contains both facts (who introduced what, vote counts) and colour quotes (opinions from lawmakers).  
2. New York Times, 22 Nov 2025 – News analysis on the “poisonous climate” driving disciplinary resolutions.  Also a first-rate source.  Facts: number and types of resolutions introduced; trend that censures are now “commonplace.”  Opinions are clearly labelled as quotations.  
3. History.House.gov list – An official, curated record of every censure, reprimand, and expulsion since 1789.  Highest factual reliability; no opinions.  Updated through 6 Mar 2025.  
4. GovTrack misconduct database – Aggregates open ethics cases.  Useful for counts and dates of investigations but crowd-compiled; moderate reliability and some data gaps.  Mainly factual listings, few opinions.  
5. Roll Call, 21 Nov 2025 – Trade publication focused on Congress.  Good reputation for floor-procedure detail.  Factual vote tallies and member quotes; opinions confined to quotes.  
6. Wake Up To Politics, 9 Jan 2026 – Newsletter; passes basic fact-checking but the excerpt has no discipline-related facts.  Low relevance.  
7. WMTW & SCOTUSblog pieces (Feb–May 2025) – Both about a Maine state-house censure; irrelevant to the U.S. House question.  
8. Agent report, 11 Feb 2026 – Synthesises Clerk data and press coverage to list every privileged discipline resolution in the 119th Congress.  Factual backbone is public legislative data; reliability medium-high but still secondary.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:
• Entire House history (1790-2025): 44 total actions → 0.19 actions/yr – too broad; ignores modern partisanship.  
• Post-Watergate era (1975-2025): 18 actions → 0.35/yr – still smooths away the recent spike.  
• “Modern partisan era” 2020-2025: 7 actions (Schweikert reprimand 2020, Gosar 2021, Schiff/Tlaib/Bowman/Santos 2023, Green 2025) → 1.17 actions/yr – captures the rule change that lets a single member force a vote and the evident tit-for-tat dynamic.  
The 2020-25 slice best matches the current procedural environment and political incentives, so I adopt it as the baseline reference class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time remaining until question deadline: 1 month + 20 days ≈ 49 days ≈ 0.134 years.  
Using the 2020-25 base rate (1.17 actions/yr), expected actions in the remaining window = 1.17 × 0.134 ≈ 0.16.  
If the arrival of actions is approximated by a Poisson process, P(at least one action) = 1 – e^(-0.16) ≈ 14.8%.

(d) Justification  
• Frequency: The past six years show a six-fold jump over the long-run average, driven by relaxed procedural hurdles and partisan use of discipline for signalling.  
• Clustering: Recent censures tend to bunch when partisan conflict peaks (June–Dec 2023, Nov 2025).  Nothing in the historical record indicates a special uptick every February–March, but Rep. Al Green’s 6 Mar 2025 censure shows it is certainly possible in this calendar window.  
• Institutional friction: Expulsion still needs ⅔ support—hard to reach in a narrowly divided chamber—so the base-rate is driven almost entirely by censures; reprimands have been rare since 2020.  
• Recess calendar: The House is in session three of the next seven weeks, giving several blocks of floor time in which privileged resolutions can reach a vote—consistent with the baseline hazard.  
Taken together, these elements point to a non-negligible but clearly sub-50% chance that at least one more censure/expulsion/reprimand occurs before 1 April 2026, absent case-specific knowledge of the pending resolutions (which will be handled in an inside-view update).

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 14.8% derived from pure base-rate math.  
• Uncertainty: The 2020-25 sample is only six years long; ±50% relative error is plausible.  
• Upset frequency: Over the last six years the “surprise” discipline events (i.e., those not widely predicted a month out) have occurred roughly one-third of the time, nudging probability slightly upward.  
• Therefore I widen the credible interval and bias slightly high to account for recent volatility: calibrated outside-view probability ≈ 18%.
