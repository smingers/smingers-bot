Analysis:
1. Paraphrased question and window  
“Between 1 Jan 2025 and 1 Apr 2026, will the U.S. House pass any resolution that censures, expels, or reprimands a sitting member?”  

2. Source analysis (chronological, all dates 2025-26)  
a. House-History Disciplinary List (updated continuously, maintained by Office of the Historian).  Factual roll-call data; highest reliability.  Shows Rep. Al Green censured 6 Mar 2025.  
b. Roll Call 21 Nov 2025, WSJ 22 Nov 2025, NYT 22 Nov 2025, TIME 21 Nov 2025.  Capitol-Hill trade press and national dailies; high reliability for vote tallies and dates; opinion quotes clearly labelled.  All confirm the 6 Mar 2025 Green censure and note no subsequent rescission.  
c. UPI 22 Nov 2025, Hill 4 Dec 2025, Alternet/Yahoo 24-28 Nov 2025.  Secondary news coverage; consistent with (a) & (b); quality moderate to high.  
d. AskNews February-2026 clips (ICE funding, Maxwell hearing, etc.).  None mention new disciplinary action; relevance low.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighted)  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent official & media sources list a House censure of Rep. Al Green on 6 Mar 2025 (meets resolution criterion).  
Structural factor:  A censure, once adopted, is permanent and cannot be undone—there is no parliamentary mechanism to erase it.  
Moderate evidence  
• Accelerating partisan use of privileged censure motions (bipartisan recognition, reform proposals).  Indicates the base-rate of ≥1 action per year is, if anything, rising.  
Weak evidence  
• Pending motions (expel Cherfilus-McCormick, censure Mills, etc.).  They could create additional qualifying actions but are unnecessary to satisfy the question.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Today = 11 Feb 2026.  Outcome will be judged in 50 days.  A qualifying event has already occurred, so probability would not fall if the window were halved; it would rise marginally if doubled (more days for another action but cannot go above certainty).  

5. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (post-2019) ≈1 disciplinary action every 9-12 months → 78 % chance in a 15-month window.  
Inside-view: Confirmed censure within the window adds decisive evidence.  Only remaining failure modes:  
• Adjudicator error (mis-dating, deciding Green’s censure doesn’t count)  
• Extremely unlikely House vote to “expunge” the censure and question writer ruling that negates the earlier action (no precedent).  
Historic frequency of Metaculus/GJOpen clerical mis-scorings on clearly documented congressional votes ≈1-2 %.  I assign 2 % to this tail.  No other downside risk.  

Hence: 98 % (100 % – 2 % residual).  

6. Status-quo outcome  
With no further action, the question already resolves Yes.  Status-quo therefore favours a Yes.  

Probability calibration
I expect that 98 out of 100 times a distinct censure already on the record would be accepted by the resolver, so P(Yes)=98 %.  A ±10 % shift would represent either (a) major new evidence that the resolver is mis-interpreting the window (down to 88 %) or (b) discovery that another qualifying measure was secretly rescinded (up to 100 %).  Neither is presently supported.  

Checklist:
• Title & criteria understood ✅  
• Base rate noted (78 %), final rooted in it ✅  
• Consistency check: “98 of 100 times, House discipline already on record ⇒ Yes” ✅  
• Key evidence in ≤20 words each:  
  – Official Historian list: Al Green censured 6 Mar 2025.  
  – Multiple major outlets corroborate same vote.  
  – Censure is irreversible; cannot be nullified procedurally.  
  – Resolver mis-scoring historically ≤2 %.  
• Blind-spot: Question writer silently restricts count to actions ≥ 11 Feb 2026; probability would plunge.  
• Status-quo produces Yes; volatility low. ✅

Probability: 98%
