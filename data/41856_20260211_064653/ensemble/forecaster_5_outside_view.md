Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wall Street Journal 22 Nov 2025 – Straight-news report (high reliability) describing the surge of privileged censure/expulsion resolutions and the floor confrontation between Reps. Mace and Mills. Provides factual vote counts and dates; opinions are quotes from lawmakers.  
2. New York Times 22 Nov 2025 – News analysis (high reliability) documenting that official House rebukes “once exceedingly rare … have become commonplace.” Factual history plus interpretive framing.  
3. House-History discipline list (congressional historian’s office, continuously updated) – Authoritative primary compilation of every expulsion (6), censure (29) and reprimand (10) since 1832, with roll-call numbers and dates through 6 Mar 2025. Pure fact, no opinion.  
4. GovTrack legislator-misconduct database – Secondary compilation of open or completed ethics cases (moderate-to-high reliability; data are taken from official releases). Provides January 2026 status of several live investigations.  
5. Roll Call 21 Nov 2025 – Capitol-hill trade paper (high reliability for procedure). Details five privileged discipline attempts processed in one November week and notes proposal to raise the voting threshold for censure/reprimand.  
6. Wake Up To Politics 9 Jan 2026 – Political newsletter (moderate reliability); the excerpt contains no discipline information, hence little probative value here.  
7. Two Maine-state censure articles & SCOTUSblog piece – Credible but concern a state legislature, not the U.S. House; irrelevant to this forecast.  
8. Agent report – Machine-aggregated ledger of every privileged discipline resolution in the 119th Congress. Cites Clerk roll-calls and major-media stories; easily verifiable and internally consistent (high usefulness).

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Entire historical record since 1789 (rare early censures, three modern expulsions). Too broad; institutional practices have changed.  
• Post-1970 era (ethics reforms, roll-call transparency). Still understates today’s partisan weaponization.  
• Post-2019 period (116th–119th Congresses), during which four censures occurred in 2021-2023 and one in 2025, plus one expulsion (Santos 2023). This captures the contemporary norm of roughly one House punishment every 9–12 months.  
Chosen reference class: 2019-present.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Question window: opening of the 119th Congress (3 Jan 2025) to 1 Apr 2026.  Today is 11 Feb 2026, leaving 50 days.  Historical pattern (reference class) gives ~1.1 punishments per year.  The 119th Congress has already produced one punishment: censure of Rep. Al Green on 6 Mar 2025—well within the scoring window.

(d) Justification  
• The qualifying event (a House-passed censure) has already happened.  Unless the arbiter of the question unexpectedly rules that events before 11 Feb 2026 do not count (contradicting the written criteria), the resolution condition is satisfied.  
• Reversal is impossible; Congress cannot retroactively “un-censure” a member.  
• Even absent the Green censure, the statistical base rate (≈1 discipline/year) within a 15-month window would yield an outside-view probability around 75-80%.  The realised censure pushes the probability asymptotically toward 100%.  
• Risk of an upset now depends solely on clerical/interpretive error by the question resolver.  Historical Metaculus/Good-Judgement style error rate on plainly written congressional questions is on the order of 1–2%.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor 1 – Base-rate expectation of ≥1 punishment in a 15-month span: ~78%.  
Anchor 2 – Known occurrence establishes the event: raise probability to 100% minus small chance (2%) of resolution mis-scoring or post-hoc rule change.  
Expert/market analogues: congressional scholars and Hill media treat the Green censure as unequivocal.  No precedent for nullifying such an act exists.  
Upset frequency for similarly clear political-process questions historically ~1–2%.

Outside View Prediction: 98 %
