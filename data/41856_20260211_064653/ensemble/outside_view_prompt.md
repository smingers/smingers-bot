The forecasting question is:
Will the US House of Representatives censure, expel or reprimand any of its members before April 1, 2026?

Question background:
Wall Street Journal (November 22, 2025): [Congress Turns Chaotic as Lawmakers Target Each Other](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/house-representatives-censure-votes-chaos-db3a33b7)

> WASHINGTON—Some House lawmakers want their colleagues punished, and it’s driving everyone else a little mad.

> Members demanded a series of votes to censure or otherwise denounce colleagues this week, and one threatened an expulsion, all taking advantage of a House rule that allows any single lawmaker to get a vote on a privileged resolution. With the House back in town this month after 54 days out of session, interpersonal dramas and long-running feuds burst into the open, sometimes turning members against their own parties, and leadership was largely powerless to stop it.

> Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.) called GOP colleague Rep. Cory Mills (R., Fla.) a “piece of s—” and “coward” to his face, according to members who overheard the exchange. This came as her [resolution to censure](https://www.wsj.com/politics/ethics-probe-of-rep-cory-mills-moves-ahead-as-possible-censure-vote-looms-30b47ad5?mod=article_inline) the Florida congressman over a series of alleged misdeeds was being read on the floor by the clerk. Some members said they had never seen anything like it.

New York Times (November 22, 2025): [In the House, Censures Proliferate, Reflecting a Poisonous Climate](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/6659/us-house-punishes-member-by-2022-09-03/)

> The purported offenses ran the gamut. One Democrat plotted to handpick his successor, while another texted with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. A Republican was accused by his colleagues of contracting abuses, faking his military honors and assaulting a woman at his apartment. A third Democrat was indicted on charges that she stole Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.

> It was a vivid illustration of how official House rebukes, once exceedingly rare and mostly a matter of consensus for the most egregious conduct or illegal acts by a sitting member of Congress, have become commonplace in recent years.

> Members of both parties have stepped up the use of censure resolutions as a partisan political weapon. Many of them include accusations by lawmakers that in the past would first have been investigated by the House Ethics Committee — and often weighed in court — before reaching the floor if found to be valid.

# Summary of Roll Call Article (November 21, 2025)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Recent censure activity**: Five censure-related attempts occurred in one week alone
  - Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) and Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) were targeted for censure (unsuccessful)
  - Rep. Jesús "Chuy" García (D-Ill.) had his conduct formally disapproved by the House
  - Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) threatened to censure, then expel, Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.)

- **Historical context**: Four lawmakers have been censured since June 2023 — more than in the 20 years prior to that combined

- **Proposed reform**: Reps. Donald S. Beyer Jr. (D-Va.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) introduced a resolution requiring 60% of House members (instead of simple majority) to agree to censure or reprimand a colleague. The resolution has 29 additional co-sponsors spanning the political spectrum.

- **Current expulsion threshold**: Two-thirds majority already required to expel a member

## Specific Allegations Mentioned:

- **García**: Allegedly timed retirement announcement to help his chief of staff inherit his seat
- **Plaskett**: Allegedly texted with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing
- **Mills**: Allegations include stolen valor and threatening to circulate sexual images of an ex; under investigation by House Ethics Committee since last year (investigative subcommittee formed Wednesday)
- **Cherfilus-McCormick**: Indicted this week for allegedly funneling FEMA overpayment funds toward her congressional campaign

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.)**: "It's become a political baseball bat, and not a way to seriously discipline members for misconduct. And it's making it meaningless"

- **Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.)** (Congress' newest member): "It feels a little bit chaotic, like a high school cafeteria, or like some sort of soap opera"

- **Rep. Joseph D. Morelle (D-N.Y.)**: The trend is "Well, they did one, we're going to do one," and "it's taking up more and more time when we have serious problems that we're not addressing"

- **Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.)**: "There's bad behavior up here that people do, but we're not the deacons of the church. There are a lot of due process issues. There's a lot of tit for tat"

- **Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.)**: "This place is dirty. It's corrupt, and I'm tired of these elite politicians getting away with their scandalous affairs"

- **Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries**: "Democrats are not going to unilaterally disarm, and there's a long list of Republicans worthy of censure." He acknowledged there's "Not enough time in the legislative calendar if Republicans want to go down this road"

- **Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.)** (Ethics Committee member): "I think being censured is still a big deal... I know some people are concerned that it's losing its meaning because of so many censures, and certainly that's fair. But it's still a big deal to me"

## Expert Opinion:

- **Sarah Binder** (George Washington University political science professor): Forcing censure votes appeals to rank-and-file members because it's one of the few things they can do on their own. "I don't know that an ethics process is what many of these members are seeking. I think what they're seeking is an easy, quicker fix and an effort to take a position"

## Additional Context:

- Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) accused leaders in both parties of cutting "backroom deals" after Democrats backed off their threat to censure Mills, apparently using it as a "bargaining chip"
- The House Ethics Committee released a report in December (2024) on former Rep. Matt Gaetz finding "substantial evidence" of misconduct
- Censure consequences: Public shaming, standing on floor to hear scolding, and committee chairs may have to step aside from positions

# Summary of Article: "15 states support Maine Rep. Laurel Libby's appeal to stop censure"

**Key Facts:**

- **Date of censure:** February 25, 2025 - The Maine House of Representatives voted 75-70 to censure Maine Rep. Laurel Libby (Republican from Auburn)

- **Reason for censure:** Libby named and shared photos of a transgender Maine high school student in a Facebook post criticizing the Maine Principals' Association for allowing transgender student-athletes to compete in girls sports

- **Consequences of censure:** Libby cannot vote on bills or speak on the House floor until she offers a public apology. She has refused to apologize or remove the post.

- **Legal timeline:**
  - March 11, 2025: Libby filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for District of Maine against House Speaker Fecteau (Democrat) and Clerk Robert Hunt
  - April 18, 2025: U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose (District of Rhode Island) denied Libby's motion for preliminary injunction
  - April 25, 2025: U.S. Court of Appeals for First Circuit denied Libby's motion for injunction
  - April 28, 2025: Libby submitted application for injunction to Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson

- **Current support:** West Virginia Attorney General John B. McCuskey filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting Libby's appeal, signed by attorneys general from 15 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia)

**Arguments:**

- **Attorneys general's position:** Legislative immunity does not apply because Libby's vote belongs to the people, not her; her constituents are being harmed; the censure is "a flagrant violation of our constitutional right to equal representation"

- **Libby's position:** The censure violates her First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights; the student's information was already publicly available online; her speech addressed a matter of public concern

- **House Speaker Fecteau's position:** "Sharing images of kids online without their consent is a clear violation of the bond of trust and respect between citizens and their Legislators"

**Note:** This article concerns a **state** legislature (Maine House of Representatives), not the U.S. House of Representatives, which is the subject of the forecasting question.

# Summary of Article: Supreme Court requires clerk to count votes by lawmaker censured for social media post about transgender athlete

**Source:** SCOTUSblog, May 20, 2025, by Amy Howe

## Key Facts:

**The Case:**
- Maine state Representative Laurel Libby (Republican) was censured by the Maine House of Representatives for a social media post about a transgender athlete at a high school track meet
- The censure resolution passed by a party-line vote of 75-70
- As a result of the censure and Libby's refusal to apologize, she was barred under House rules from participating in debates and voting on issues before the full House
- Her elected term runs through 2026

**Legal Proceedings:**
- Libby sued in federal court, claiming the censure violated her First Amendment rights and deprived her constituents of representation under the 14th Amendment
- U.S. District Judge Melissa Du Bose denied her request, citing legislative immunity
- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected her emergency request but fast-tracked her appeal with oral argument scheduled for June 5
- Libby appealed to the Supreme Court on April 28, 2025

**Supreme Court Decision (May 20, 2025):**
- The Supreme Court granted Libby's emergency request in a brief unsigned order
- The order requires the Maine House clerk to count Libby's votes while her appeal continues
- Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented (with a five-page opinion)
- Justice Sonia Sotomayor also indicated she would have denied the request
- The Court did not explain its reasoning, following its general practice for emergency appeals

**Justice Jackson's Dissent:**
- Criticized the decision as "watering down" the Court's standards for granting emergency relief
- Argued Libby did not meet the high bar of having an "indisputably clear" right to relief
- Noted the case involves difficult questions and the appeals court had already fast-tracked the case
- Warned that lowering the bar for emergency relief would lead to more such requests

**Note:** This article describes a state-level censure in the Maine House of Representatives, not the U.S. House of Representatives that is the subject of the forecasting question.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide all privileged resolutions in the 119th Congress that seek to censure, expel, or reprimand a representative and indicate whether any have scheduled or completed floor votes.
Below is a consolidated ledger of every privileged resolution introduced so far in the 119th Congress (January 3 2025-January 2 2027) whose stated purpose is to censure, expel, or reprimand a sitting Representative.  For each measure the table shows (a) the target of the discipline, (b) sponsor, (c) resolution number and date it became privileged, and (d) floor-action status—i.e., whether the House has already voted, has scheduled a vote (a privileged resolution must be acted on within two legislative days), or is still pending.

1. Rep. Al Green (D-TX)  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL)*  
   • Resolution: H. Res. 189 — “Censuring Representative Al Green of Texas” – noticed on 5 Mar 2025, privileged 6 Mar 2025.  
   • Floor action: PASSED, 224-198-2 (Roll-call 62, 6 Mar 2025) — Green formally censured. (Office of the Clerk roll-call 62, 119th)  

2. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)*  
   • Resolution: H. Res. 713 — “Censuring Representative Ilhan Omar … and removing her from the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on the Budget” – noticed 17 Sep 2025.  
   • Floor action: Motion to Table ADOPTED 214-213 (Roll-call 276, 17 Sep 2025).  Because the motion prevailed, the House took no further action and the censure failed. (Office of the Clerk roll-call 276, 119th)

3. Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-VI)  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC)  
   • Resolution number: not yet posted on Clerk site at time of reporting (privileged text read 19 Nov 2025).  
   • Floor action: House REJECTED the censure the next day.  (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)

4. Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (D-IL)  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez (D-WA)  
   • Resolution: H. Res. ___ (styled “Disapproving of Representative Jesús ​‘Chuy’ García’s conduct”) — a privileged “disapproval” resolution.  
   • Floor action: ADOPTED, 236-183 (Roll Call reported by Roll Call newspaper, 18 Nov 2025).  Disapproval is less severe than censure or reprimand, but because it is a privileged disciplinary measure that publicly rebukes a member, it is listed here for completeness.

5. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) — first resolution  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY)  
   • Resolution: text read in the House 21 Nov 2025; no number yet.  
   • Floor action: Democrats withdrew the resolution shortly after the Plaskett vote, so no vote has been scheduled. (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)

6. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) — second resolution  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC)  
   • Resolution: text read in the House 22 Nov 2025 while Mace confronted Mills on the floor.  Number pending.  
   • Floor action: As of 22 Nov 2025 the two-day “privileged” clock had started but a vote had not yet been placed on the calendar. (Wall Street Journal, 22 Nov 2025)

7. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) — proposed EXPULSION  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) (announced 21 Nov 2025)  
   • Resolution: not yet filed; Steube says he will move to expel her following her federal indictment.  
   • Floor action: None yet. (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)

8. Group of unnamed Democrats who disrupted the Al Green censure vote  
   • Sponsor: Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN)  
   • Resolution: Would strip committee assignments; Ogles said he would mark it “privileged.” (Fox News, 6 Mar 2025)  
   • Floor action: Not yet noticed on the floor and therefore not yet under the two-day clock.

*Sponsor name taken from contemporaneous press accounts; the official sponsor line is not yet posted on Congress.gov.

Current take-aways for the forecasting question  
• Only one member has actually been punished so far in the 119th Congress: Rep. Al Green was censured on 6 Mar 2025 (criterion-satisfying “Yes” event).  
• Every other privileged discipline resolution has either failed (Omar, Plaskett) or is still pending (both Mills resolutions, the potential Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion, and Ogles’s committee-stripping measure).  
• The House continues to allow single-member privileged motions, so additional votes are very likely as the 119th Congress proceeds.

Remaining information gaps  
• The Clerk’s site has not yet assigned or posted resolution numbers and full texts for the Plaskett, both Mills, and potential Cherfilus-McCormick measures.  
• Exact vote tallies and dates for the Plaskett censure need confirmation once the Clerk publishes the roll call.  
• Confirmation is also needed on whether the Ogles privilege resolution was ever formally noticed; if it was not, it falls outside the query’s scope.

No further searching appears necessary right now; outstanding details will become available once the Clerk posts the formal legislative data.</Agent_report>
