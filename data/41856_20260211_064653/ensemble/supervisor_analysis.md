Disagreement Analysis:

The most significant disagreement is a fundamental split between two groups:

**Disagreement 1: Does the resolution window include events before February 11, 2026?**
- Forecasters 3 and 5 (predicting 98-99%) believe the question resolves based on the literal text "before April 1, 2026," meaning the Al Green censure on March 6, 2025 already satisfies the resolution criteria, making this essentially resolved Yes.
- Forecasters 1, 2, and 4 (predicting 28-58%) believe only events after the Forecast Opening Date of February 11, 2026 count, based on the metadata note: "Unless the question title specifies otherwise, the Forecast Opening Date of 2026-02-11T06:16:45Z should be considered the start of the question's resolution window. Events before this date do not count toward resolution."
- This disagreement accounts for ~70 percentage points of spread and is the dominant source of divergence.

**Disagreement 2: Among those who restrict to the Feb 11 - Apr 1 window, how likely is a new censure/expulsion/reprimand?**
- Forecaster 1 (58%) weights the multiple active cases (Mills, Cherfilus-McCormick, McIver) and recent clustering pattern more heavily.
- Forecasters 2 and 4 (both 28%) emphasize that most attempts fail, the window is short (~49 days), Ethics investigations take months, and there's growing institutional resistance.
- This disagreement accounts for ~30 percentage points of spread among the "restricted window" forecasters.

**Disagreement 3: Was Al Green actually censured, and does the García censure also count?**
- Forecasters 3 and 5 cite Al Green's censure on March 6, 2025 as confirmed fact from official House records.
- The fine print explicitly mentions H.Res.189 censuring Al Green as an example of a qualifying resolution, which strongly suggests it already happened.
- The key question is whether the metadata note overrides the literal resolution text.

Root Causes:

1. **Disagreement 1**: Different interpretations of the resolution criteria. The literal resolution text says "before April 1, 2026" with no start date restriction, but the metadata note explicitly states events before Feb 11, 2026 don't count. This is an interpretive/rules question, not a factual one.

2. **Disagreement 2**: Different weighting of the same evidence (how likely active cases resolve in 49 days) combined with different base rate assumptions (post-2021 frequency vs. longer historical average).

3. **Disagreement 3**: Partially factual (confirming specific censure votes occurred) and partially interpretive (whether pre-opening-date events count).
