Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Resolution window interpretation):** This is the critical disagreement. The metadata note explicitly states: "Unless the question title specifies otherwise, the Forecast Opening Date of 2026-02-11T06:16:45Z should be considered the start of the question's resolution window. Events before this date do not count toward resolution." The question title does NOT specify otherwise - it says "before April 1, 2026" but doesn't explicitly override the metadata note. Forecasters 3 and 5 (98-99%) relied on the literal resolution text, but the metadata note is a standard Metaculus convention that restricts the window. The Al Green censure (March 2025) and any other pre-Feb 11, 2026 actions would NOT count. This resolves in favor of forecasters 1, 2, and 4 who used the Feb 11 - Apr 1, 2026 window.

**Disagreement 2 (Likelihood of action in the restricted window):** The targeted research found NO confirmed censure, expulsion, or reprimand passing the full House between Feb 11 and the present (Feb 13, 2026). The agent report explicitly states: "the search results do not conclusively show that the House had censured, expelled, or reprimanded any member between February 11 and March 31, 2026." Key cases remain pending:
- **Mills:** Censure resolution referred to Ethics Committee (Nov 2025); investigation ongoing but no floor vote on censure itself.
- **Cherfilus-McCormick:** Expulsion resolution filed by Steube, but "no action has been taken on it yet." Ethics Committee found substantial evidence (Jan 29, 2026), but expulsion requires 2/3 vote.
- **McIver:** Censure resolution filed but no vote confirmed.

**Disagreement 3 (Probability among restricted-window forecasters):** Forecaster 1 at 58% vs. forecasters 2 and 4 at 28%. The research shows multiple active cases but none have reached a floor vote yet. The Ethics Committee report on Cherfilus-McCormick (Jan 29, 2026) with "substantial evidence" is a significant development that could accelerate action. However, expulsion requires 2/3 majority (very high bar), and censure attempts have frequently been referred to committee rather than voted on directly.

Updated Analysis:

The window is Feb 11 - Apr 1, 2026 (~49 days). No action has occurred yet as of Feb 13. Key factors:

**Favoring Yes:**
- Cherfilus-McCormick Ethics report (Jan 29) found substantial evidence of criminal misconduct; expulsion resolution already filed; this is the strongest catalyst
- Mills Ethics investigation ongoing with serious allegations
- McIver censure resolution pending
- Privileged resolution mechanism allows any member to force a vote
- Recent pattern of frequent censure attempts (5 in 5 days in Nov 2025)
- Multiple cases simultaneously active increases probability at least one succeeds

**Favoring No:**
- Most censure attempts in Nov 2025 were referred to committee rather than passing
- Expulsion requires 2/3 vote (very high bar); Democrats would likely protect Cherfilus-McCormick
- Ethics investigations typically take months
- Growing bipartisan reform effort to curb censure proliferation
- Only ~49 days remaining, with limited legislative days
- Leadership generally tries to avoid these votes

The Cherfilus-McCormick case is the most likely to produce action given the Ethics Committee's strong findings and federal indictment, but expulsion requires 2/3 and censure would need to overcome partisan dynamics. The Mills case could produce a censure if the Ethics investigation concludes quickly. The probability that at least ONE of these multiple cases results in a successful floor vote in 49 days is meaningful but not dominant.

I weight this between the 28% camp and the 58% camp, leaning somewhat toward the lower end because the research confirms no action has occurred yet and the main mechanisms (Ethics investigations, expulsion votes) face significant procedural hurdles. However, the Cherfilus-McCormick Ethics findings are a strong catalyst that could trigger action. I estimate approximately 35%.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probability: 35%
