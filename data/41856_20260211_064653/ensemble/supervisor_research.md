Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

The Texas Republican Party is set to vote on censuring and potentially removing from the 2026 ballot 10 Republican state representatives, including the current and former House Speakers. The allegations against the members stem from their support for Democratic committee chairs and other actions that went against the party's priorities. 

To be censured, a member must be found to have violated three party principles or legislative priorities. The state party is giving the lawmakers an opportunity to respond to the allegations before the vote. If the censures are approved, the party plans to refuse to accept the censured members' applications for the 2026 primary ballot.

The article notes that this is an "outgrowth of the long-running fight between movement ideological conservatives and the more moderate, more traditionalist faction of the Republican party" in Texas. The censured members are expected to legally challenge their removal from the ballot, arguing they are ultimately responsible to their constituents, not the state party.

Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

The article discusses the chaotic and confusing series of elections in Texas's 18th Congressional District over the past year. After the previous representative, Sylvester Turner, passed away in March 2025, there was a delay in holding a special election to fill the vacancy. This led to the district being without representation for several months. 

When the special election was finally held in November 2025, none of the 16 candidates won a majority, leading to a runoff election on January 31, 2026. The winner of that runoff, Christian Menefee, now has just 4 weeks before having to run again in the March 3rd Democratic primary for the full 2-year term.

Adding to the confusion, the Texas legislature redrew the congressional district maps in a way that split up the 18th District, meaning Menefee and the other candidates will be running in a redrawn district with some new territory. This has led to voter fatigue and frustration, with many residents unsure of which district they are now in and when the various elections are taking place.

The article notes that the back-to-back elections, overlapping voting periods, and redrawn district boundaries have been "exhausting" for voters and have contributed to a sense that they are being "pawns in a game." Local Democratic activists express concerns that the chaos may end up disenfranchising voters, especially in the predominantly Black and Hispanic district.

Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

The Republican Party of Texas' governing board is set to meet on Saturday to consider censuring 10 Texas House Republicans who party leaders believe did not sufficiently support GOP priorities during the 2023 legislative session. This would be the first test of a new rule adopted at the 2024 Texas GOP convention, which allows the party to bar censured officials from the 2026 Republican primary ballot.

The lawmakers facing potential censure include House Speaker Dustin Burrows and several members of his leadership team. The alleged transgressions include voting for Burrows as speaker and approving the House rules package, which banned Democrats from serving as committee chairs.

The effort to censure and potentially block these Republicans from the primary ballot reflects ongoing tensions between the party's business-oriented establishment and its more socially conservative grassroots. The Texas GOP first defined its censure rule in 2016, but it has rarely been used until now.

Some within the party have argued that the alleged offenses do not warrant the drastic step of denying ballot access, which critics view as undemocratic. However, the party's rules committee has prioritized strengthening the censure rule to give it more "teeth" in selecting the "right Republicans" to run under the party's banner.

<Summary source="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3893180/mace-resolution-censure-cory-mills-ethics-committee/">
Summary:

The article reports that Rep. Nancy Mace's (R-SC) resolution to censure Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) was referred to the House Ethics Committee on Wednesday night. The House voted 310-103 to send the resolution to the committee, with most Republicans and 106 Democrats supporting the motion. Mills introduced the motion to refer it to the committee, stalling Mace's censure effort.

Before the vote, Mace and Mills reportedly exchanged heated words, with Mace calling Mills a "piece of s***." Several Republicans, including Mace, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Tim Burchett (R-TN), and Lauren Boebert (R-CO), voted against the motion to refer the resolution to the Ethics Committee.

The article notes that the Ethics Committee has already announced an investigation into Mills for various alleged offenses, including failure to properly disclose information, violation of campaign finance laws, improperly soliciting or receiving gifts, receiving special favors, and allegations of sexual misconduct. The investigation could take longer than a censure vote, giving a temporary victory to Mills.

Summary:

The article discusses a complaint filed by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace against her fellow GOP colleague, Rep. Cory Mills, which has been referred to the House Ethics Committee. Mace sought to censure Mills and remove him from the House Armed Services and House Foreign Affairs committees, citing several controversies surrounding him.

The key points are:

1. Mace's resolution accuses Mills of conduct that "brings discredit upon the House," including allegations of assault, threatening to release explicit images of an ex-girlfriend, entering into federal contracts while in Congress, and inflating or falsifying his military service record.

2. The House voted 310-103 to send Mace's complaint against Mills to the Ethics Committee, rather than holding a swift vote on censure.

3. The House Ethics Committee has separately voted to establish an investigative subcommittee to probe the various allegations against Mills.

4. Censure has become more frequent in the House in recent years, used as a partisan political weapon by members of both parties.

Query: Has the US House of Representatives censured, expelled, or reprimanded any member since February 11, 2026? Check for any floor votes on censure, expulsion, or reprimand resolutions in February or March 2026, including actions related to Representatives Mills, Cherfilus-McCormick, McIver, or any other member.
Based on the comprehensive search results, I can provide a detailed analysis of disciplinary actions in the US House of Representatives between February and March 2026:

Disciplinary Resolutions and Potential Actions:

1. Cory Mills Censure Resolution:
Representative Nancy Mace introduced a privileged resolution on November 19, 2025, seeking to censure Representative Cory Mills and remove him from the House Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs. The resolution cites multiple serious allegations:

Key Allegations Against Mills:
- Federal Contracting Violations: The Office of Congressional Conduct found Mills-owned companies secured nearly $1 million in federal contracts for munitions while he served in Congress
- Potential Conflict of Interest: Mills' companies sought contracts with foreign nations while serving on national security committees
- Disputed Military Record: Multiple service members challenged the veracity of his Bronze Star recommendation
- Allegations of Violence: DC Metropolitan Police investigated an alleged assault of a 27-year-old woman at Mills' residence in February 2025

2. Other Potential Disciplinary Actions:
The search results reveal multiple censure and disciplinary resolutions introduced in the House, including:

- H.Res. 901: Expulsion resolution for Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick
- H.Res. 539: Censure and removal of Representative La Monica McIver from the Homeland Security Committee
- H.Res. 258: Censure resolution for Representative Jasmine Crockett

Context and Trends:
The Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles provide important context about the increasing frequency of disciplinary actions:

- House members are increasingly using privileged resolutions to challenge colleagues
- Censure resolutions have become more common as a political tool
- Interpersonal conflicts and long-running feuds are driving these actions

Specific Developments:
- On February 11, 2026, the House conducted a vote (Roll Call 65) on H.J. Res. 72, which passed 219-211
- The House Ethics Committee has multiple disciplinary resolutions under consideration

Verification Status:
As of the search results, no censure, expulsion, or reprimand had been definitively passed by the full House between February and March 2026. However, multiple resolutions were in various stages of consideration.

Limitations and Gaps:
- The search results do not confirm the final outcome of the Cory Mills censure resolution
- Complete details of all potential disciplinary actions are not fully documented
- The exact status of each resolution is not definitively established

Conclusion:
While multiple disciplinary actions were proposed and under consideration, the search results do not conclusively show that the House had censured, expelled, or reprimanded any member between February 11 and March 31, 2026.

The analysis is based on contemporaneous sources including congressional records, news reports, and official House documents from the period in question.</Agent_report>

<Summary source="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2026/01/29/house-probe-finds-substantial-evidence-of-criminal-misconduct-ethics-violations-by-cherfilus-mccormick/">
Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

The House Ethics Committee has found "substantial evidence of conduct" described in a criminal indictment against U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Florida Democrat. The investigative subcommittee uncovered evidence of violations of federal laws, regulations, and ethical standards, including:

- Excessive and illegal campaign contributions, including corporate contributions and conduit contributions
- Failure to accurately file financial disclosure statements
- Providing "special favors" for government appropriations requests
- Commingling personal and campaign funds, and conduct that does not reflect creditably on the House
- Money laundering of government funds and illegal campaign contributions

The subcommittee said Cherfilus-McCormick initially provided some documents but then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when subpoenaed for more documents and testimony. 

The findings have prompted a Republican congressman to call for a vote to expel Cherfilus-McCormick from the House, though the House Democratic leader said such an effort would lack legal basis and was just a political stunt.

<Summary source="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/766671-greg-steube-starts-push-to-expel-sheila-cherfilus-mccormick-from-congress/">
Summary:

U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, a Republican from Sarasota, has announced that he will file a privileged resolution on Thursday calling for the immediate expulsion of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat from Miramar, Florida. This comes a day after Cherfilus-McCormick was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that she stole $5 million in COVID funds to finance her 2021 congressional campaign.

Steube initially said he wanted to censure Cherfilus-McCormick, but later decided that the House should proceed directly to expulsion. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced that Cherfilus-McCormick would step down as ranking member of the House Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, but did not mention whether she would resign.

The House Ethics Committee already had an investigation underway on the allegations against Cherfilus-McCormick, and in May issued a report detailing potential criminal acts. If found guilty of all counts in the indictment, Cherfilus-McCormick could face up to 53 years in prison.

The article also mentions that the House voted on Wednesday night to refer a censure resolution of U.S. Rep. Cory Mills, a Republican from New Smyrna Beach, to the House Ethics Committee.

Summary:

Democratic U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is fundraising off of federal charges that she stole $5 million in FEMA funds to bankroll her 2021 congressional campaign. In a text to voters, Cherfilus-McCormick claims the charges are "politically motivated retaliation" for her votes demanding "transparency, truth and accountability from our leaders." She is asking for donations to help her "fight back" against the "unjust" and "baseless" charges. 

The indictment alleges that Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother secured funding intended for a COVID vaccine distribution program, and when overpayments were made, she rerouted the money through several accounts that later donated to her campaign. If found guilty, she could face up to 53 years in prison.

Cherfilus-McCormick is not the only federal lawmaker from Florida to fundraise off of their legal troubles. Former Reps. Matt Gaetz and George Santos also used similar language to describe the scrutiny they faced. Republican Rep. Greg Steube has introduced a resolution to expel Cherfilus-McCormick, but no action has been taken on it yet.
