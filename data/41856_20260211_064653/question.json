With the House back in town this month after 54 days out of session, interpersonal dramas and long-running feuds burst into the open, sometimes turning members against their own parties, and leadership was largely powerless to stop it.\n\n> Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.) called GOP colleague Rep. Cory Mills (R., Fla.) a \u201cpiece of s\u2014\u201d and \u201ccoward\u201d to his face, according to members who overheard the exchange. This came as her [resolution to censure](https://www.wsj.com/politics/ethics-probe-of-rep-cory-mills-moves-ahead-as-possible-censure-vote-looms-30b47ad5?mod=article_inline) the Florida congressman over a series of alleged misdeeds was being read on the floor by the clerk. Some members said they had never seen anything like it.\n\nNew York Times (November 22, 2025): [In the House, Censures Proliferate, Reflecting a Poisonous Climate](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/6659/us-house-punishes-member-by-2022-09-03/)\n\n> The purported offenses ran the gamut. One Democrat plotted to handpick his successor, while another texted with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. A Republican was accused by his colleagues of contracting abuses, faking his military honors and assaulting a woman at his apartment. A third Democrat was indicted on charges that she stole Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.\n\n> It was a vivid illustration of how official House rebukes, once exceedingly rare and mostly a matter of consensus for the most egregious conduct or illegal acts by a sitting member of Congress, have become commonplace in recent years.\n\n> Members of both parties have stepped up the use of censure resolutions as a partisan political weapon. Many of them include accusations by lawmakers that in the past would first have been investigated by the House Ethics Committee \u2014 and often weighed in court \u2014 before reaching the floor if found to be valid.\n\nFor base rate information, please see [List of Individuals Expelled, Censured, or Reprimanded in the U.S. House of Representatives](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Discipline/Expulsion-Censure-Reprimand/)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40852,\"question_id\":40511}}`",
