Analysis:
The market will hinge on whether any formal disciplinary resolution—censure, expulsion, or reprimand—actually passes the House before 1 April 2026. The most relevant information now is:
• Any resolutions introduced or privileged that are scheduled for floor action in the next seven weeks.  
• Statements by leadership or Rules Committee about upcoming votes.  
• Ethics Committee findings that could trigger a disciplinary vote.  
• Recent or ongoing scandals involving specific members that have prompted colleagues to file resolutions.  
News within the past few days or weeks is critical, while older background pieces only help establish precedent. Searches therefore need to surface (a) breaking coverage of newly filed or privileged resolutions and (b) calendars or whip notices indicating imminent floor action.
