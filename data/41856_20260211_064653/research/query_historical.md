Analysis:
To gauge the chance that the House will discipline a member in the next seven weeks, I first need an outside-view baseline:  
• How often have censures, expulsions or reprimands occurred in recent Congresses (say, since 2000)?  
• How many privileged resolutions seeking such punishment are currently pending and what is their status?  
• Which specific members are now under active Ethics Committee probes that could plausibly reach the floor soon?  
Locating the official House History list, recent press coverage of all the privileged resolutions introduced this session, and up-to-date reporting on ongoing ethics cases will supply that context. No macroeconomic data are relevant.
