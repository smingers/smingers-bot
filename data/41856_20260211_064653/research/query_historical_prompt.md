The forecasting question is:
Will the US House of Representatives censure, expel or reprimand any of its members before April 1, 2026?

Question background:
Wall Street Journal (November 22, 2025): [Congress Turns Chaotic as Lawmakers Target Each Other](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/house-representatives-censure-votes-chaos-db3a33b7)

> WASHINGTON—Some House lawmakers want their colleagues punished, and it’s driving everyone else a little mad.

> Members demanded a series of votes to censure or otherwise denounce colleagues this week, and one threatened an expulsion, all taking advantage of a House rule that allows any single lawmaker to get a vote on a privileged resolution. With the House back in town this month after 54 days out of session, interpersonal dramas and long-running feuds burst into the open, sometimes turning members against their own parties, and leadership was largely powerless to stop it.

> Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.) called GOP colleague Rep. Cory Mills (R., Fla.) a “piece of s—” and “coward” to his face, according to members who overheard the exchange. This came as her [resolution to censure](https://www.wsj.com/politics/ethics-probe-of-rep-cory-mills-moves-ahead-as-possible-censure-vote-looms-30b47ad5?mod=article_inline) the Florida congressman over a series of alleged misdeeds was being read on the floor by the clerk. Some members said they had never seen anything like it.

New York Times (November 22, 2025): [In the House, Censures Proliferate, Reflecting a Poisonous Climate](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/6659/us-house-punishes-member-by-2022-09-03/)

> The purported offenses ran the gamut. One Democrat plotted to handpick his successor, while another texted with the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. A Republican was accused by his colleagues of contracting abuses, faking his military honors and assaulting a woman at his apartment. A third Democrat was indicted on charges that she stole Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.

> It was a vivid illustration of how official House rebukes, once exceedingly rare and mostly a matter of consensus for the most egregious conduct or illegal acts by a sitting member of Congress, have become commonplace in recent years.

> Members of both parties have stepped up the use of censure resolutions as a partisan political weapon. Many of them include accusations by lawmakers that in the past would first have been investigated by the House Ethics Committee — and often weighed in court — before reaching the floor if found to be valid.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.
