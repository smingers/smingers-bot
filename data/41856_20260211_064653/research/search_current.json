Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) and Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) were targeted for censure (unsuccessful)\n  - Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) had his conduct formally disapproved by the House\n  - Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) threatened to censure, then expel, Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.)\n\n- **Historical context**: Four lawmakers have been censured since June 2023 \u2014 more than in the 20 years prior to that combined\n\n- **Proposed reform**: Reps. Donald S. Beyer Jr. (D-Va.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) introduced a resolution requiring 60% of House members (instead of simple majority) to agree to censure or reprimand a colleague. The resolution has 29 additional co-sponsors spanning the political spectrum.\n\n- **Current expulsion threshold**: Two-thirds majority already required to expel a member\n\n## Specific Allegations Mentioned:\n\n- **Garc\u00eda**: Allegedly timed retirement announcement to help his chief of staff inherit his seat\n- **Plaskett**: Allegedly texted with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing\n- **Mills**: Allegations include stolen valor and threatening to circulate sexual images of an ex; House Ethics Committee has been investigating since last year and formed an investigative subcommittee on Wednesday\n- **Cherfilus-McCormick**: Indicted this week for allegedly funneling FEMA overpayment funds toward her congressional campaign\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.)**: \"It's become a political baseball bat, and not a way to seriously discipline members for misconduct. And it's making it meaningless.\"\n\n- **Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.)** (Congress' newest member): \"It feels a little bit chaotic, like a high school cafeteria, or like some sort of soap opera.\"\n\n- **Rep. Joseph D. Morelle (D-N.Y.)**: The trend is \"Well, they did one, we're going to do one,\" and \"it's taking up more and more time when we have serious problems that we're not addressing.\"\n\n- **Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.)**: \"There's bad behavior up here that people do, but we're not the deacons of the church. There are a lot of due process issues. There's a lot of tit for tat.\"\n\n- **Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.)**: \"This place is dirty. It's corrupt, and I'm tired of these elite politicians getting away with their scandalous affairs.\"\n\n- **Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries**: \"Democrats are not going to unilaterally disarm, and there's a long list of Republicans worthy of censure.\" He added there's \"not enough time in the legislative calendar if Republicans want to go down this road.\"\n\n- **Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.)** (Ethics Committee member): \"I think being censured is still a big deal... I know some people are concerned that it's losing its meaning because of so many censures, and certainly that's fair. But it's still a big deal to me.\"\n\n## Expert Opinion:\n\n- **Sarah Binder** (George Washington University political science professor): Forcing censure votes may appeal to rank-and-file members because it's one of the few things they can do on their own. \"I don't know that an ethics process is what many of these members are seeking. I think what they're seeking is an easy, quicker fix and an effort to take a position.\"\n\n## Process Notes:\n\n- Members are increasingly bypassing the House Ethics Committee and using privileged resolutions to bring censure votes directly to the floor\n- The Ethics Committee has equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and is typically secretive and slow-moving\n- Censured members are often required to stand on the floor to hear the scolding; committee chairs may have to step aside from their positions\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Discipline/Expulsion-Censure-Reprimand/\">\n# Summary of Article: List of Individuals Expelled, Censured, or Reprimanded in the U.S. House of Representatives\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Constitutional Framework:**\n- The Constitution grants the House broad power to discipline its Members for acts ranging from criminal misconduct to violations of internal House Rules\n- Three forms of discipline exist in order of severity: expulsion (most severe), censure, and reprimand\n- Expulsion requires a two-thirds vote of those present and voting\n\n**Historical Record of Expulsions (6 total):**\n1.

Democrat facing felony assault charges frets about God's judgment to ICE director**\nDuring a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on February 10, 2026, Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.), who faces felony assault charges for allegedly attacking ICE officers in June 2025, launched a 3.5-minute diatribe targeting acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons. After prompting Lyons to confirm he was religious, McIver asked, 'Do you think you're going to hell, Mr. Lyons?' following a prior question about Judgment Day and 'blood on your hands.' Lyons declined to respond, stating, 'I'm not going to entertain that question.' Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) intervened, reprimanding McIver for violating decorum, stating, 'Aggressively attacking those witnesses personally is inappropriate and not in keeping with the traditions of our committee.' Despite this, McIver persisted, asking how many government agencies 'routinely kill American citizens and still get funding,' and concluded by calling for the abolition of ICE. McIver was charged with multiple counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with federal law enforcement agents, with a potential maximum sentence of 17 years in prison if convicted.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 09:55 PM\nSource:[TheBlaze](https://www.theblaze.com/news/dem-facing-felony-assault-charges-asks-ice-acting-director-if-he-thinks-hes-going-to-hell)\n\n**Reps to withhold 2026 budget over agric institutions' non-submission of IGR records**\nThe House of Representatives Committee on Agricultural Colleges and Institutions mandated all institutions under its jurisdiction to submit evidence of their internally generated revenue (IGR) within 24 hours on February 10, 2026, warning that failure to comply would result in the suspension of their 2026 budget defence. Chairman Abiodun Akinlade emphasized that budget defence is not a ceremonial act but a critical accountability mechanism, stating that 'the power of the purse rests with the legislature' and that no ministry, department, or agency (MDA) may spend funds without parliamentary approval. The Committee expressed concern over the complete absence of capital fund releases to agricultural institutions during the 2025 fiscal year, which has significantly impaired their operations. Lawmakers have long criticized the lack of verifiable IGR records, noting that such omissions hinder the assessment of true funding needs, expose potential revenue leakages, and undermine fiscal transparency. The issue is especially prevalent among educational and training institutions that earn income through tuition, consultancy, farm produce, research grants, and commercial activities. The Committee stressed that IGR submissions are essential to evaluate institutional financial health, enforce fiscal discipline, and strengthen legislative oversight ahead of the 2026 budget deliberations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 07:55 PM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/)\n\n**Legal immigration resolution a preview of acrimonious debates ahead in Tennessee legislature**\nOn February 10, 2026, the Tennessee House of Representatives debated a non-binding resolution introduced by Republican Rep. Lee Reeves of Franklin, urging the president and Congress to streamline the legal immigration process and prioritize the safety, security, and economic interests of the United States. The resolution, which criticized the current system as 'burdensome with unnecessary bureaucracy, lengthy delays and, because of that, excessive cost on lawful applicants,' sparked heated debate. Democratic Rep. Jason Powell questioned the resolution\u2019s reference to 'American values,' expressing disgust with the current administration\u2019s values. Democratic Rep. Gabby Salinas, an immigrant herself, accused Reeves of using the resolution to 'run cover' for unpopular Republican immigration policies, including a bill requiring immigration status verification in public schools. Republican Rep. Monte Fritts of Kingston opposed the resolution, arguing that the U.S. has reached a 'saturation point' in immigration and called for a temporary suspension, citing concerns from young Americans. The debate previewed intense upcoming discussions over a broader 'Immigration 2026' agenda, introduced by Tennessee Republicans and linked to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.

Due to the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the general election, it is now unlikely that the fiscal year 2026 budget will be enacted by the March 31 deadline, prompting the government to prepare a temporary budget.

The Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji presided over the 61st Chairperson's Meeting today, which made the decision. The meeting also recommended that the upcoming session review drafts of several laws, amendments, and agenda items related to the 14th National People's Congress's 4th session scheduled for March 5, including the list of the presidium, secretary-general, and attending personnel, as well as the work report draft of the Standing Committee.

However, Chinese media reported that only three individuals\u2014Zhou Xinmin, Luo Qi, and Liu Cangli\u2014had their representative qualifications terminated, all of whom were affiliated with aerospace and nuclear energy sectors with close ties to the Chinese military and were part of the anti-corruption campaign.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 11:16 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202602100318.aspx)\n\n**Ghislaine Maxwell Offers to Testify Before Congress in Exchange for Trump Pardon**\nGhislaine Maxwell, convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison, refused to testify before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on February 10, 2026, invoking the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. The committee\u2019s Republican chairman, James Comer, called her refusal 'very disappointing.' Maxwell\u2019s legal team had previously demanded criminal immunity for her testimony, which was denied. Instead, her attorney David Markus stated that Maxwell is willing to testify fully and honestly if granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump. She reportedly would use the testimony to assert that both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing related to Jeffrey Epstein, claiming only she can explain why. Democratic representative Melanie Stansbury criticized the move as a direct appeal to Trump, suggesting her silence can be bought. Trump has previously avoided commenting on a potential pardon. The committee also plans to subpoena Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who have requested public hearings to prevent political manipulation of their testimony. Meanwhile, lawmakers Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, co-authors of the transparency law, visited the Department of Justice to review unredacted documents and found six names of individuals allegedly involved in Epstein\u2019s activities were censored without justification. The law permits redaction only to protect victims\u2019 privacy, not to shield public officials or due to political sensitivity. Lawmakers demanded the Department re-evaluate its redactions. The documents, released on January 30, 2026, totaled over three million pages and were deemed not to contain new evidence for further prosecution. Todd Blanche, the Department\u2019s second-in-command, had previously interviewed Maxwell for 1.5 days\u2014an unusual move.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 12:44 AM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/monde/ghislaine-maxwell-la-complice-d-epstein-reclame-une-grace-de-trump-pour-temoigner-devant-le-congres-CNT000002ndZ4p.html)\n\n**Ghislaine Maxwell Refuses to Testify Before Congress to Avoid Self-Incrimination**\nGhislaine Maxwell, convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking of minors and other charges, appeared via remote video before the U.S. House of Representatives on February 9, 2026, for a closed-door session and invoked the Fifth Amendment, refusing to testify. According to James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Maxwell\u2019s refusal was to avoid self-incrimination. She is serving a 20-year sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida. The appearance occurred amid a key phase of congressional investigation into unredacted Epstein archives held by the Department of Justice. The released documents reveal that U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick maintained deeper and more frequent personal and business ties with Epstein than previously acknowledged, including attempts to contact Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a leading advocate for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, called for Lutnick\u2019s resignation, stating, 'No, simply should resign.' On February 8, 2026, a video released by the group Mundo Sin Explotaci\u00f3n featured survivors demanding greater transparency from the Trump administration. In a letter to the committee obtained by CNN, survivors and families of Virginia Giuffre urged members to treat Maxwell\u2019s testimony with 'maximum skepticism,' asserting she was not a minor figure but a 'central and indispensable architect' of Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking network. The letter also accuses Maxwell of perjury and of refusing to identify powerful men involved in the network.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:17 PM\nSource:[La Voz](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/mundo/archivos-de-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-se-nego-a-testificar-ante-el-congreso-para-no-inculparse/)\n\n**House homecoming was a return for the worse**\nThe U.S. House of Representatives returned to session on November 17, 2025, after a 43-day government shutdown and a 54-day recess ordered by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), marking a deeply somber and tense homecoming. Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) described the atmosphere as 'ugly,' reflecting a collective frustration\u2014a sociological term defined by psychiatrist Zahid Awan as a shared sense of dissatisfaction or anger stemming from unmet expectations or perceived injustices. This sentiment was fueled by a series of high-stakes political developments: Democrats successfully passed a discharge petition to compel the DOJ to release Jeffrey Epstein files, which was adopted 427 to 1 and passed unanimously in the Senate; President Trump shifted from opposition to support, undermining Republican unity. The Senate then passed a continuing appropriations resolution to reopen the government until January 30, but Democrats were outraged over the failure to restore Affordable Care Act subsidies. The House responded with three censure attempts: one succeeded against Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) for withdrawing from re-election to allow his chief of staff to run; one failed against Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) over texts with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 hearing; and one defeated against Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) over alleged conflicts of interest. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced the censure motion, which was referred to the Ethics Committee by Mills\u2019s motion, passing 310 to 103. A fourth resolution, introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.), seeks to expel Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.) on charges of misusing a $5 million federal overpayment for a COVID-19 vaccine contract, with expulsion requiring a two-thirds vote. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced her resignation effective January 5, 2026, accusing the 'political-industrial complex' of prioritizing fundraising and self-interest over constituent service. The weaponization of ethics proceedings symbolized deeper frustration over the disruptions caused by the shutdowns, which prevented meaningful legislative work. Don Wolfensberger, a 28-year congressional veteran and author, contextualizes the crisis as a breakdown in deliberative democracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 03:30 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5632036-house-ethics-censure-votes/)\n\n**Republican 'revenge' blasted after Nancy Mace files two censures**\nA surge in censure votes in the U.S. House of Representatives has prompted concern from prominent Democrats, including Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), who called the trend 'not normal at all' and warned it fuels a cycle of partisan retaliation. Chu emphasized the need for a higher threshold for censure, advocating for bipartisan reform to reduce the frequency of such actions. Reps. Don Beyer (D-VA) and Don Bacon (R-NE) echoed this sentiment, stating the censure process is 'broken' and undermines the House\u2019s ability to address national issues. Historically, censure has been rare\u2014only 23 cases between 1832 and 2021, with no censures from 1983 to 2010. Since 2021, however, five members have been formally censured: Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and four Democrats\u2014Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Al Green (D-TX), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY). Recent censure attempts, including those led by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) against Cory Mills (R-FL), Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-IL), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), have been widely seen as partisan. Chu voted against censuring Mills, Plaskett (D-VI), and Omar, noting that such actions often serve as political theater or fundraising tools. She highlighted a 'revenge motive' driving the cycle, where one party\u2019s censure prompts retaliation from the other. The House retains broad power to discipline members, with expulsion as the most severe penalty, followed by censure and reprimand. Censure requires a majority vote and involves a public reading of the resolution in the chamber, symbolizing deep disapproval without meeting expulsion standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/nancy-mace-revenge/)\n\n**Congress voted to censure each other as many times in the last week as it did in the last two years**\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted on three censure resolutions in one week\u2014matching the total number of censure votes in the entire 118th Congress (2023\u20132025). These included a rebuke of retiring Illinois Democrat Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia by Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez over allegations of election subversion, a failed motion to reprimand U.S. Virgin Islands Del. Stacey Plaskett by Rep. Ralph Norman due to her past contact with Jeffrey Epstein, and a failed attempt by Rep. Nancy Mace to censure Florida Rep. Cory Mills over alleged corruption, which was referred to the House Ethics Committee. No censure votes occurred in either chamber during the 2022 or 2024 calendar years, making the recent surge unprecedented. Censure resolutions, authorized under Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, allow Congress to formally reprimand members, officials, or judges and can result in penalties like loss of committee assignments. While censures of non-members lack binding disciplinary power, they carry significant symbolic weight. The spike in censure attempts has prompted bipartisan concern, with Virginia Democrat Don Beyer and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon proposing legislation to raise the threshold for censure from a simple majority to 60%. They argue the process has become a tool for political grandstanding, undermining civil discourse and bypassing the Ethics Committee. Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar criticized the trend, saying censure is being exploited for fundraising and media attention. Former Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock attributed the shift to a decline in political shame, noting that in the past, members would resign after serious allegations rather than endure public rebuke, a norm she blames on the influence of former President Donald Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 01:54 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/congress-voted-censure-other-many-135438536.html)\n\n**Congress voted to censure members as many times in one week as it did in two years**\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted on three censure resolutions in one week\u2014matching the total number of censure votes in the entire 118th Congress (2023\u20132025). On Monday, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez led a censure of retiring Illinois Democrat Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia over allegations of undermining his successor's election. On Tuesday, Rep. Ralph Norman\u2019s motion to reprimand U.S. Virgin Islands Del. Stacey Plaskett failed after revelations she had communicated with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 2019. On Thursday, Rep. Nancy Mace\u2019s attempt to censure Florida Republican Cory Mills for alleged corruption also failed, with the case referred to the House Ethics Committee. This surge in censure activity contrasts sharply with prior years: no censure votes occurred in 2022 or 2024, and only three Democrats\u2014Adam Schiff, Rashida Tlaib, and Jamaal Bowman\u2014faced censure in the previous Congress, all between June and December 2023. Censure resolutions, authorized under Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, allow Congress to formally reprimand members and strip them of committee assignments, though they lack authority over non-members. The recent spike has prompted bipartisan concern, with Virginia Democrat Don Beyer and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon proposing legislation to raise the threshold for censure from a simple majority to 60%. Beyer cited growing political tension and a breakdown in cooperation. Critics, including Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, argue censure is being weaponized for fundraising and media attention, undermining civil discourse. Former Republican Congresswoman Barbara Comstock attributed the shift to a decline in political shame, noting that members now often refuse to resign despite serious allegations\u2014a change she traces to President Trump\u2019s influence.

On November 19, Cherfilus-McCormick was indicted on charges of stealing $5 million in federal disaster aid and using some of it for her election campaign. In response, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Florida, announced he would pursue censure and later filed legislation to initiate expulsion proceedings, which remain pending. Cherfilus-McCormick, who posted bond and denied wrongdoing, has no plans to resign and stepped down from her role as top Democrat on a Senate Foreign Affairs subcommittee per Democratic caucus rules. This incident is part of a broader trend: six other reprimand measures were filed last week, citing misconduct ranging from election subversion and false military award claims to profiting from government contracts and past communications with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Formal rebukes are rare in the House; typically, allegations are referred to the House Ethics Committee, which has not yet released a report on Cherfilus-McCormick\u2019s case. Steube has stated he will not push for an expulsion vote until the committee acts. Expulsion requires a two-thirds majority\u2014only six members have been expelled in U.S. history, with the most recent being Rep. George Santos, R-New York, expelled in 2023 after the Ethics Committee found he misused campaign funds, committed fraud, and filed false reports. Santos served three months of a seven-year sentence before President Donald Trump commuted it in October. Cherfilus-McCormick is not the only Floridian facing scrutiny: Rep. Cory Mills, R-Florida, was the subject of a censure resolution by Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York, in September, which Clarke did not pursue. More recently, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-South Carolina, sought to censure Mills over allegations of campaign finance violations, misuse of office, and sexual misconduct, which Mills denies. The House voted on November 19 to refer Mace\u2019s censure attempt to the Ethics Committee, which established a subcommittee to investigate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[The Center Square: Florida](https://www.thecentersquare.com/florida/article_2b1d9910-90dc-4476-8695-03807c1b6e1a.html?a)\n\n**Legislators Demand Reform of House Censure Rules After Week of Political Theater**\nLegislators on both sides of the aisle in the U.S. House of Representatives are expressing growing frustration over the increased use of censure procedures, describing them as 'a playground nonsense' and a distraction from substantive legislative work. Since the end of a 43-day government shutdown on October 1, 2024, the House has seen five censure threats in just five days, including three 'privileged resolutions' forcing immediate votes on reprimanding colleagues. Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY) called the wave of censures 'the greatest collection of nonsense,' urging reforms to prevent individual members from using the process for personal attention or political gain. Some lawmakers worry the tool could be weaponized for electoral strategy. Currently, any member can initiate a censure motion, and both parties have used it multiple times this week. A bipartisan proposal seeks to raise the threshold for censure from a simple majority to 60% of the House. However, experts like Jim Curry of the University of Utah question whether this change would deter the behavior, noting the media attention and headline value that drives individual members to initiate such actions. Representative Wesley Bell (D-MO) criticized the use of censure as 'eye for an eye,' arguing it should not be used for personal grievances. Others, including Republican Mike Haridopolos (FL) and Nick LaLota (R-NY), attributed the surge to pent-up political frustration and media-driven clickbait. The House Ethics Committee, led by Republican Michael Guest (MS), is seen by some as a more appropriate venue for handling misconduct, with Representative Glenn Ivey (D-MD) noting the House has other tools like stripping committee assignments. Several members, including Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Brad Knott (R-NC), expressed concern that censure votes divert time from pressing issues like affordability and healthcare. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) acknowledged the debate and said he is open to reforms, stating he is reviewing input from members across the conference.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 01:02 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/legisladores-exigen-cambios-normas-censura-130211312.html)\n\n**House resolution seeks to raise threshhold for censuring member to 60% - UPI.com**\nA bipartisan resolution co-sponsored by U.S. Representatives Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) proposes raising the threshold for censuring a House member from a simple majority to 60% to ensure bipartisan consensus. The measure, introduced on November 22, 2025, comes amid a surge of censure efforts targeting three members: Republican Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia of Illinois, Republican Cory Mills of Florida, and Democratic delegate Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Beyer stated that the censure process has deteriorated from a rare, due-process-driven mechanism into a political tool, undermining the House\u2019s functionality. Bacon echoed this, calling for 'commonsense safeguards' to counter 'mob mentality' in Congress. The resolution already had 29 sponsors by Friday afternoon. According to NBC News, the House has censured members only six times in the 21st century, with most historical censures following lengthy ethics investigations involving criminal activity or serious misconduct. Expulsion from Congress requires a two-thirds vote, with 16 members expelled during the Civil War and the most recent being George Santos, R-N.Y., who was convicted and served three months in prison before a presidential commutation. Beyer warned that the proliferation of censure attempts is unsustainable and damaging to institutional integrity. This week, the House censured Garcia for unilaterally selecting his successor after the primary filing deadline and rejected a censure of Plaskett despite her receipt of messages from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a hearing. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a censure resolution against Mills, which was referred to the Ethics Committee. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., threatened to censure Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, who was indicted for allegedly stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds.

Among them, House Speaker Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock) faces reprimand for securing the speakership through bipartisan support, opposing Republican-favored candidates, preventing debate on rules, and appointing Democratic subcommittee chairs. The other nine representatives\u2014Morgan Meyer (R-University Park), Angie Chen Button (R-Garland), Angelia Orr (R-Itasca), Cody Harris (R-Palestine), Jared Patterson (R-Frisco), Stan Lambert (R-Abilene), Dade Phelan (R-Beaumont), Jeff Leach (R-Allen), and Gary VanDeaver (R-New Boston)\u2014are under scrutiny for supporting Burrows, approving the contentious House Resolution 4 rules package without debate, or backing legislation deemed inconsistent with GOP values. Three penalties are under consideration: (1) restricting party financial and campaign support and authorizing voter education campaigns in the officeholder\u2019s district; (2) discouraging participation in the Republican primary; and (3) barring candidates from applying for a Republican primary ballot for 24 months. Penalty 3, which would ban candidates from the 2026 primary, applies to all except Burrows. The censure process follows Texas GOP Rule 44, which allows a two-thirds vote by constituent precinct chairs to impose penalties. The rule was recently expanded to require County Chairs to reject primary applications from censured candidates for 24 months. Notably, Phelan and Lambert are retiring at the end of their terms. The meeting follows a memo released on October 11 by Texas GOP Chairman Abraham George, who has a history of opposing Burrows.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[FOX 26 Houston](https://www.fox26houston.com/news/texas-republicans-censure-meeting-dustin-burrows)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
