Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) and Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) were targeted for censure (unsuccessful)\n  - Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) had his conduct formally disapproved by the House\n  - Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) threatened to censure, then expel, Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.)\n\n- **Historical context**: Four lawmakers have been censured since June 2023 \u2014 more than in the 20 years prior to that combined\n\n- **Proposed reform**: Reps. Donald S. Beyer Jr. (D-Va.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) introduced a resolution requiring 60% of House members (instead of simple majority) to agree to censure or reprimand a colleague. The resolution has 29 additional co-sponsors spanning the political spectrum.\n\n- **Current expulsion threshold**: Two-thirds majority already required to expel a member\n\n## Specific Allegations Mentioned:\n\n- **Garc\u00eda**: Allegedly timed retirement announcement to help his chief of staff inherit his seat\n- **Plaskett**: Allegedly texted with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing\n- **Mills**: Allegations include stolen valor and threatening to circulate sexual images of an ex; under investigation by House Ethics Committee since last year (investigative subcommittee formed Wednesday)\n- **Cherfilus-McCormick**: Indicted this week for allegedly funneling FEMA overpayment funds toward her congressional campaign\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.)**: \"It's become a political baseball bat, and not a way to seriously discipline members for misconduct. And it's making it meaningless\"\n\n- **Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.)** (Congress' newest member): \"It feels a little bit chaotic, like a high school cafeteria, or like some sort of soap opera\"\n\n- **Rep. Joseph D. Morelle (D-N.Y.)**: The trend is \"Well, they did one, we're going to do one,\" and \"it's taking up more and more time when we have serious problems that we're not addressing\"\n\n- **Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.)**: \"There's bad behavior up here that people do, but we're not the deacons of the church. There are a lot of due process issues. There's a lot of tit for tat\"\n\n- **Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.)**: \"This place is dirty. It's corrupt, and I'm tired of these elite politicians getting away with their scandalous affairs\"\n\n- **Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries**: \"Democrats are not going to unilaterally disarm, and there's a long list of Republicans worthy of censure.\" He acknowledged there's \"Not enough time in the legislative calendar if Republicans want to go down this road\"\n\n- **Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.)** (Ethics Committee member): \"I think being censured is still a big deal... I know some people are concerned that it's losing its meaning because of so many censures, and certainly that's fair. But it's still a big deal to me\"\n\n## Expert Opinion:\n\n- **Sarah Binder** (George Washington University political science professor): Forcing censure votes appeals to rank-and-file members because it's one of the few things they can do on their own. \"I don't know that an ethics process is what many of these members are seeking. I think what they're seeking is an easy, quicker fix and an effort to take a position\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) accused leaders in both parties of cutting \"backroom deals\" after Democrats backed off their threat to censure Mills, apparently using it as a \"bargaining chip\"\n- The House Ethics Committee released a report in December (2024) on former Rep. Matt Gaetz finding \"substantial evidence\" of misconduct\n- Censure consequences: Public shaming, standing on floor to hear scolding, and committee chairs may have to step aside from positions\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/the-first-mailbag-edition-of-2026\">\n# Summary of \"The First Mailbag Edition of 2026!\" by Gabe Fleisher\n\n**Date:** January 9, 2026  \n**Source:** Wake Up to Politics\n\n## Key Facts Relevant to the Question:\n\nThe article provides updates on four congressional votes that took place on January 8, 2026:\n\n1. **Senate vote (52-47):** Advanced a resolution to prevent the president from sending troops to Venezuela.

Laurel Libby's appeal to stop censure\"\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n- **Date of censure:** February 25, 2025 - The Maine House of Representatives voted 75-70 to censure Maine Rep. Laurel Libby (Republican from Auburn)\n\n- **Reason for censure:** Libby named and shared photos of a transgender Maine high school student in a Facebook post criticizing the Maine Principals' Association for allowing transgender student-athletes to compete in girls sports\n\n- **Consequences of censure:** Libby cannot vote on bills or speak on the House floor until she offers a public apology. She has refused to apologize or remove the post.\n\n- **Legal timeline:**\n  - March 11, 2025: Libby filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for District of Maine against House Speaker Fecteau (Democrat) and Clerk Robert Hunt\n  - April 18, 2025: U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose (District of Rhode Island) denied Libby's motion for preliminary injunction\n  - April 25, 2025: U.S. Court of Appeals for First Circuit denied Libby's motion for injunction\n  - April 28, 2025: Libby submitted application for injunction to Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\n- **Current support:** West Virginia Attorney General John B.

For each measure the table shows (a) the target of the discipline, (b) sponsor, (c) resolution number and date it became privileged, and (d) floor-action status\u2014i.e., whether the House has already voted, has scheduled a vote (a privileged resolution must be acted on within two legislative days), or is still pending.\n\n1. Rep. Al Green (D-TX)  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL)*  \n   \u2022 Resolution: H. Res. 189 \u2014 \u201cCensuring Representative Al Green of Texas\u201d \u2013 noticed on 5 Mar 2025, privileged 6 Mar 2025.  \n   \u2022 Floor action: PASSED, 224-198-2 (Roll-call 62, 6 Mar 2025) \u2014 Green formally censured. (Office of the Clerk roll-call 62, 119th)  \n\n2. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)*  \n   \u2022 Resolution: H.

Because the motion prevailed, the House took no further action and the censure failed. (Office of the Clerk roll-call 276, 119th)\n\n3. Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-VI)  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC)  \n   \u2022 Resolution number: not yet posted on Clerk site at time of reporting (privileged text read 19 Nov 2025).  \n   \u2022 Floor action: House REJECTED the censure the next day.  (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)\n\n4. Rep. Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-IL)  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp P\u00e9rez (D-WA)  \n   \u2022 Resolution: H.

Disapproval is less severe than censure or reprimand, but because it is a privileged disciplinary measure that publicly rebukes a member, it is listed here for completeness.\n\n5. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) \u2014 first resolution  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY)  \n   \u2022 Resolution: text read in the House 21 Nov 2025; no number yet.  \n   \u2022 Floor action: Democrats withdrew the resolution shortly after the Plaskett vote, so no vote has been scheduled. (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)\n\n6. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) \u2014 second resolution  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC)  \n   \u2022 Resolution: text read in the House 22 Nov 2025 while Mace confronted Mills on the floor.  Number pending.  \n   \u2022 Floor action: As of 22 Nov 2025 the two-day \u201cprivileged\u201d clock had started but a vote had not yet been placed on the calendar. (Wall Street Journal, 22 Nov 2025)\n\n7. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) \u2014 proposed EXPULSION  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) (announced 21 Nov 2025)  \n   \u2022 Resolution: not yet filed; Steube says he will move to expel her following her federal indictment.  \n   \u2022 Floor action: None yet. (Washington Examiner, 21 Nov 2025)\n\n8. Group of unnamed Democrats who disrupted the Al Green censure vote  \n   \u2022 Sponsor: Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN)  \n   \u2022 Resolution: Would strip committee assignments; Ogles said he would mark it \u201cprivileged.\u201d (Fox News, 6 Mar 2025)  \n   \u2022 Floor action: Not yet noticed on the floor and therefore not yet under the two-day clock.\n\n*Sponsor name taken from contemporaneous press accounts; the official sponsor line is not yet posted on Congress.gov.\n\nCurrent take-aways for the forecasting question  \n\u2022 Only one member has actually been punished so far in the 119th Congress: Rep. Al Green was censured on 6 Mar 2025 (criterion-satisfying \u201cYes\u201d event).  \n\u2022 Every other privileged discipline resolution has either failed (Omar, Plaskett) or is still pending (both Mills resolutions, the potential Cherfilus-McCormick expulsion, and Ogles\u2019s committee-stripping measure).  \n\u2022 The House continues to allow single-member privileged motions, so additional votes are very likely as the 119th Congress proceeds.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \n\u2022 The Clerk\u2019s site has not yet assigned or posted resolution numbers and full texts for the Plaskett, both Mills, and potential Cherfilus-McCormick measures.  \n\u2022 Exact vote tallies and dates for the Plaskett censure need confirmation once the Clerk publishes the roll call.  \n\u2022 Confirmation is also needed on whether the Ogles privilege resolution was ever formally noticed; if it was not, it falls outside the query\u2019s scope.\n\nNo further searching appears necessary right now; outstanding details will become available once the Clerk posts the formal legislative data.</Agent_report>\n"
