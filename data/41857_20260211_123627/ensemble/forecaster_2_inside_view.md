**Key Factual Observations:**
1. First reading passed Nov 11, 2025 (39-16) = 92 days ago
2. As of Feb 11, 2026, bill is STILL in National Security Committee
3. Multiple sources (Adalah, AskNews) confirm committee hearings ongoing in January 2026
4. Defense Ministry and legal experts raising constitutional objections
5. 49 days remain until April 1, 2026 deadline

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST PASSAGE:**

1. **Time constraint + procedural delay (Multiple sources, Feb 2026):** Bill has been in committee for 92 days since first reading. Typical fast-track security bills complete in 12-15 days; median is 90-100 days for ALL THREE readings. We have 49 days left and haven't even reached second reading. This is structural evidence of delay.

2. **Internal government opposition (Anadolu/AskNews, Feb 11):** Defense Ministry officially opposes key clauses; legal experts cite constitutional violations and Geneva Convention breaches. This represents institutional resistance within the coalition itself.

3. **Historical precedent (Multiple sources):** Zero previous death penalty bills have become law in Israel's history. Three attempts (2015, 2018, 2023) all failed. BBC notes security establishment has historically opposed such measures.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE AGAINST PASSAGE:**

4. **International law concerns (Multiple sources):** UN experts, Amnesty International, legal scholars all cite violations of international law. While not directly controlling Knesset votes, this creates political pressure and potential Supreme Court challenges.

5. **Coalition fragility indicators (i24NEWS, Feb 9):** Article notes bill is "far from final approval" and has sparked "intense legal and moral debate within Israel." Ben-Gvir's threats to leave coalition suggest he lacks assured support.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE FOR PASSAGE:**

6. **Ben-Gvir's political leverage (Multiple sources, Nov 2025):** He successfully forced the first reading vote by threatening coalition withdrawal. His party remains in government, giving him continued leverage.

7. **Prison Service preparations (i24NEWS, Feb 9):** Practical preparations for execution facility suggest government anticipates possible implementation. However, article explicitly states bill "remains far from final approval."

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

8. **Public mood shift (BBC, Jan 31):** Article notes "many see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments" but this is vague and unquantified.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Current timeframe:** 49 days (Feb 11 → April 1, 2026)

**If halved to ~25 days:** Probability would drop to near-zero (perhaps 5-8%). Impossible to complete committee review, second reading, third reading, and any required Supreme Court review in under a month when bill has already spent 92 days in committee.

**If doubled to ~98 days:** Probability would increase moderately to perhaps 35-40%. This would allow time for committee completion and the two remaining readings, though historical precedent and internal opposition would still weigh heavily against passage.

The current 49-day window is critically constraining. The bill needs to:
1. Clear committee (ongoing for 92 days)
2. Pass second reading in plenum
3. Pass third reading in plenum
4. Survive any Supreme Court challenges

Even with coalition discipline, this typically requires 30-60 days AFTER committee clearance.

**(d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View:**

**Outside view baseline: 27%**

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD adjustment:**

1. **Procedural delay is decisive:** The 92-day committee stage versus 49 days remaining represents a structural impossibility unless committee completes THIS WEEK. Adalah (Jan 19) reported "final votes expected in coming weeks," but that was 23 days ago and AskNews (TODAY) confirms bill is STILL in committee. This is not a "fast-track" scenario. **Adjustment: -10%**

2. **Internal coalition opposition:** Defense Ministry opposition and constitutional concerns from legal experts represent institutional resistance WITHIN the government. This is qualitatively different from external criticism. Previous reference-class bills that passed did not face this level of internal government opposition. **Adjustment: -5%**

3. **Zero historical successes:** The reference class of "death penalty bills in Israel" has a 0/3 success rate. While I used a broader reference class for the outside view, this specific sub-class is highly relevant and suggests structural barriers exist. **Adjustment: -3%**

**Factors warranting UPWARD adjustment:**

4. **Ben-Gvir's demonstrated leverage:** He successfully forced the first reading vote. However, his continued threats suggest he NEEDS to threaten because support is uncertain, not assured. **Adjustment: +2%**

**Net adjustment: 27% - 10% - 5% - 3% + 2% = 11%**

However, this seems too low given that the bill HAS passed first reading and committee work IS ongoing. The procedural delay is severe but not yet fatal. Let me recalibrate:

The critical question is: Can the committee complete its work in the next 1-2 weeks, allowing 3-4 weeks for second and third readings?

Adalah (Jan 19) suggested this was possible ("coming weeks"). But 23 days later (today), it hasn't happened. This suggests either:
- Committee is genuinely deadlocked over Defense Ministry objections
- Coalition is slow-walking to avoid a vote they'll lose
- Procedural complexity is greater than anticipated

Given these factors, a probability around 12-15% seems appropriate: low but not negligible, reflecting that passage remains theoretically possible if committee suddenly completes this week and coalition whips votes aggressively.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view of 27%, the combination of:
- Severe time constraint (92 days in committee, 49 days remaining)
- Internal government opposition (Defense Ministry, legal experts)
- Zero historical precedent for success
- Ongoing committee delays as of TODAY

These factors render the current situation significantly less favorable than the reference class of "controversial security bills that passed first reading." The reference class assumed bills that cleared first reading were on a normal legislative track. This bill is demonstrably NOT on that track—it's stalled in committee with institutional opposition.

The appropriate adjustment is substantial. However, complete dismissal (below 10%) would be overconfident given:
- Coalition has 64/120 seats (nominal majority)
- Ben-Gvir has demonstrated ability to force votes
- Prison Service is making practical preparations
- Committee work IS ongoing (not abandoned)

**Final calibrated prediction: 14%**

This reflects: "Unlikely but not impossible." Passage would require committee completion within 7-10 days, aggressive coalition whipping, and no Supreme Court intervention—all possible but requiring multiple favorable breaks.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Israel's Knesset pass the Death Penalty for Terrorists bill (Amendment 159) into law before April 1, 2026? Resolution requires official passage per Knesset website.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 27% from reference class of controversial security bills passing first reading. Final prediction (14%) is rooted to this but adjusted downward for severe procedural delays, internal opposition, and time constraints that make current circumstances less favorable than reference class.

3. **Consistency check:** "14 out of 100 times, the bill passes second reading, third reading, and becomes law within 49 days despite spending 92 days in committee and facing Defense Ministry opposition." This aligns with a scenario requiring multiple favorable breaks but remaining theoretically possible.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Bill has been in committee 92 days; only 49 days remain for completion (AskNews, Feb 11, 2026)
   - Defense Ministry officially opposes key clauses; constitutional concerns raised (Anadolu, Feb 11, 2026)
   - Zero previous death penalty bills have become law in Israeli history (BBC, multiple sources)
   - i24NEWS (Feb 9) explicitly states bill "remains far from final approval"
   - Committee hearings still ongoing as of today, not completed (AskNews, Feb 11)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Ben-Gvir forces emergency coalition vote by threatening immediate government collapse, and Netanyahu capitulates to preserve coalition. Committee fast-tracks completion this week, second and third readings occur in single emergency session within 2 weeks. This would increase probability to ~35-40%, but requires multiple coordinated political maneuvers that haven't materialized in 92 days.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is "bill remains in committee indefinitely." Given 92 days of committee review with no completion, and only 49 days remaining, status quo continuation (non-passage) is highly probable. Low volatility in current situation—no breaking news of imminent committee vote or coalition crisis forcing action.

Probability: 14%
