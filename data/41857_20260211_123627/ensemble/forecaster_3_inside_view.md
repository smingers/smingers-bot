Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria / paraphrase  
The question resolves **Yes** if the Knesset **passes into law** (2nd+3rd readings completed) the *Penal Law (Amendment No. 159) (Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025* **before 2026-04-01 UTC**, as shown on the **official Knesset website**.

2) Outside view base rate (given)  
Outside view prediction: **12%** (anchored on repeated historical stalling/failure of similar death-penalty bills, plus coalition arithmetic/time pressure).

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, and what is fact vs opinion)
- **Official Knesset press releases (Nov 3 & Nov 11, 2025)** (high reliability; primary source; past facts): confirm committee approval for first reading and **Plenum first-reading passage 39–16**. Purely factual on status.
- **BBC (Jan 31, 2026)** (high reliability; recent): reiterates first-reading status, provides political context and quotes. Mix of facts + stakeholder claims (supporters/opponents). Useful for status + political signals.
- **Le Monde (Nov 11, 2025)** (high reliability; past): confirms first reading, notes coalition threat dynamics. Mostly factual reporting + reactions.
- **i24NEWS citing Channel 13 (Feb 9, 2026)** (medium reliability; very recent): reports Prison Service contingency planning (“Green Mile”) and says bill remains “far from final approval.” Facts likely but secondhand and partly speculative (planning does not equal passage).
- **Adalah (Jan 19, 2026)** (advocacy org; medium on legislative-status facts, low on framing): claims bill is being **fast-tracked** with multiple committee hearings and “final votes expected in coming weeks.” The schedule claims are the key factual nugget; rhetoric is advocacy.
- **ACRI (Nov 10–13, 2025)** (advocacy/opinion; older): mainly normative/legal arguments; factual background about Israel’s historic use is credible but passage-likelihood inference is not strong evidence.
- **Al Jazeera relaying Amnesty (Feb 3, 2026)** (medium; recent): primarily advocacy framing; still useful as evidence of **international pressure**. Facts about Amnesty’s position are solid; predictions are not.
- **Anadolu Ajansı (Feb 11, 2026)** (medium; very recent; politically framed): reports **Israeli legal/security experts and Defense/Justice ministry concerns** and that committee is hearing objections before moving to 2nd/3rd readings. Directionally informative, but treat details cautiously.
- **Jerusalem Post (Feb 11, 2026)** (medium; very recent): reports political messaging (Ben-Gvir calling revised bill “acceptable to majority”), and that bill is pending further readings. Good for political intent signals; less definitive on procedural timing.
- **Other AskNews items in Arabic/Turkish/Spanish outlets** (mixed reliability): several appear to **misstate timing** (e.g., saying the Knesset “passed” or implying enactment). Given resolution hinges on the Knesset’s official legislative record, I treat these as weak unless corroborated by the Knesset site.

Key meta-point: multiple outlets loosely describe “approval”/“passed” while the resolution requires **final enactment**; only the Knesset site is dispositive.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large weight):
- **Structural/time constraint:** Only ~7 weeks remain; bill still not reported as scheduled for 2nd/3rd readings. Short runway is hard to fake.
- **Legislative status quo:** As of today, it is **not yet law** and still requires **2nd+3rd readings**; absent an explicit plenum timetable, base expectation is slippage.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):
- **Fast-tracking signals in committee (Adalah Jan 19)**: multiple hearings in a week and expectation of “final votes in coming weeks” suggests real momentum and prioritization.
- **Operational preparations (i24/Channel 13 Feb 9)**: bureaucracies typically do not prepare seriously for something they view as impossible; indicates perceived probability is non-trivial (but still contingent).
- **Reported internal legal/constitutional/international-law objections (Anadolu Feb 11)**: credible mechanism for delay/compromise drafting, which can push timing beyond April 1 even if eventual passage occurs.

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- **Rhetorical claims by politicians / activists** (e.g., Ben-Gvir “most important law,” activists calling it “imminent”): show intensity, not calendar certainty.
- **International criticism (Amnesty/UN experts)**: may matter at margins, but Israel often proceeds with controversial security policy despite external pressure; more likely to alter provisions than outright stop passage within this short window.

Net directional pull vs outside view:
- Positive toward “Yes”: committee fast-tracking + coalition pressure + prison service preparation.
- Negative toward “Yes”: severe time constraint + indications it is still “far from final approval” + internal legal/security objections that could slow final text or whip-count.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: **49 days** (Feb 11 → Apr 1, 2026 UTC).
- If timeframe were **halved** (~24–25 days): I’d drop materially (many Knesset bills can move fast, but controversy + objections make ultra-fast passage less likely).
- If timeframe were **doubled** (~98 days, to early/mid-May): I’d raise materially (committee could resolve objections and schedule plenum votes with less calendar compression).

(d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from 12%
Status quo if nothing changes: it remains in committee / contested and **does not reach final enactment by Apr 1** → “No” is the default.

Why I still raise above 12% (but not dramatically):
- The bill has already cleared a key hurdle (first reading) and multiple sources indicate **active committee work** and **acceleration** (Jan–Feb). That makes the current attempt less analogous to older “dies quietly” reference cases.
- Coalition and ministerial incentives (Ben-Gvir leverage; apparent PM shift) can compress timelines—Israel can pass 2nd/3rd readings quickly once leadership decides.

Why I don’t raise to (say) 40–60%:
- The **calendar is tight** and we do not yet have strong, corroborated reporting that 2nd/3rd readings are scheduled imminently.
- **Internal institutional objections** (Defense/Justice ministry/legal experts) often translate into either (i) time-consuming redrafting/compromises, or (ii) leadership deciding to delay a polarizing vote.
- “Preparations” and “expected in coming weeks” are not the same as having the votes whipped and a plenum slot locked.

Probability calibration
- Anchor: 12% outside view.
- Upward adjustments for “momentum” indicators (fast-tracking + operational preparation): +10 to +15 points.
- Downward adjustment for (i) persistent “not near final approval” language and (ii) high risk of timing slip within 49 days: -2 to -5 points.

Net: I land around the low-to-mid 20s.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: **Will the Knesset enact (2nd+3rd readings) Amendment No.159 death-penalty-for-terrorists bill by 2026-04-01 UTC (per Knesset site)?**  
2) Outside view base rate: **12%**.  
3) Consistency check: **22 out of 100 times, the bill becomes law by Apr 1, 2026 (per Knesset website).**  
4) Top evidence (3–5):
   - Bill still needs 2nd+3rd readings with only ~49 days left.  
   - Committee fast-tracking/hearings and “final votes expected in coming weeks” (Adalah, Jan 19).  
   - Prison Service preparations reported (Channel 13 via i24, Feb 9).  
   - Reported Defense/Justice/legal expert objections could slow final text/timing (Anadolu, Feb 11).  
5) Blind spot: A sudden coalition decision to “jam it through” in a single late-March plenum session; that would push probability higher.  
6) Status quo outcome: Most likely outcome is **delay beyond April 1** → nudges toward “No.”

Probability: 22%
