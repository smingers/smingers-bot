Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what’s known vs. opinion; quality; date)
- **Knesset press releases (Nov 3 & Nov 11, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Committee approval for first reading; plenum first-reading vote **39–16**; procedural requirement of second+third readings.  
  - **Quality:** Primary-source, high reliability for legislative status and vote tallies.  
  - **Limits:** Doesn’t indicate timetable or coalition whip count for later readings.

- **BBC (Nov 11, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Confirms first-reading passage and vote; notes Israel’s historical near-nonuse of the death penalty; contextualizes hostage deal/ceasefire.  
  - **Opinion/frames:** “Controversial,” emphasis on criticism—useful but not dispositive for passage odds.  
  - **Quality:** High-quality secondary reporting; strong on basic facts.

- **CNN (Nov 10/11, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** First-reading passage; notes Netanyahu’s earlier opposition and later shift; describes committee pathway.  
  - **Opinion/frames:** Highlights international-law critique; not directly predictive.  
  - **Quality:** High-quality secondary reporting; reliable for political context, though details can be fluid.

- **Le Monde (Nov 11, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Confirms timing, vote, and that further readings are required.  
  - **Quality:** High-quality secondary source; adds little new beyond confirmation.

- **Times of Israel (Nov 18, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Indicates committee work and floated amendments; recalls prior attempts stalling.  
  - **Opinion (attributed):** Channel 12 assessment that High Court approval chances are low (speculative/analyst view, not a legislative fact).  
  - **Quality:** Generally strong local reporting; committee “WhatsApp stunt” angle increases noise.

- **Jerusalem Post (Nov 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Confirms first-reading vote and intent to advance quickly.  
  - **Opinion:** Political rhetoric from sponsors/opposition.  
  - **Quality:** Mainstream Israeli outlet; potential partisan framing, but basic procedural facts likely correct.

- **Al Jazeera (Nov 11, 2025)**  
  - **Factual:** Confirms first-reading vote and requirement for further readings.  
  - **Opinion:** Heavy advocacy framing; Amnesty quote is a **normative** stance, not predictive.  
  - **Quality:** Useful for reactions; not the strongest for forecasting legislative mechanics.

- **Verfassungsblog (Jan 23, 2026)**  
  - **Factual/analytic:** Legal/political history; notes security-establishment posture historically; discusses likely petitions.  
  - **Opinion/analysis:** Interprets discrimination/constitutionality; informative but not a timetable signal.  
  - **Quality:** Strong for “structural headwinds” and institutional context; less for near-term legislative probabilities.

- **ECPM opinion (May 12, 2023)**  
  - **Factual:** Historical background + earlier bill delay.  
  - **Opinion:** Advocacy against death penalty.  
  - **Quality:** Limited—useful mainly for history, not for predicting 2026 passage.

- **Agent report (compiled; mixed sourcing)**  
  - **Factual claims:** Prior attempt timelines; emphasizes 2018 and 2023 stalling; says 2025 bill still in committee as of Feb 2026.  
  - **Quality:** Helpful synthesis but includes uncertain bill-number specifics and acknowledges gaps; I treat it as **directionally informative** rather than authoritative.

**Bottom line from sources (for outside view):** death-penalty-for-terrorists bills have repeatedly advanced partway but historically fail to reach enactment; the current bill has cleared first reading but (per agent synthesis) has already spent months in committee.

### (b) Reference class analysis (base rates)
I see three plausible reference classes:

1) **Israeli “death penalty for terrorists” legislative attempts (2015–2023, plus current effort as a continuation of the same recurring idea).**  
   - Suitability: Very high (same policy target; similar controversy; similar institutional objections).  
   - Base rate: Appears to be **0 enacted out of ~3 serious attempts** (2015, 2018, 2023), i.e., a very low raw base rate.

2) **Israeli controversial criminal-justice / national-security bills that pass first reading.**  
   - Suitability: Medium-high (procedurally similar; coalition politics matter).  
   - Base rate: Likely substantially higher than (1), because many government/coalition-backed bills do become law after first reading—*but* “controversial + judicial review risk + coalition-management complexity” lowers it.

3) **Knesset bills that have passed first reading but are still in committee ~3 months later.**  
   - Suitability: Medium (captures “stuckness”); less topic-specific.  
   - Base rate: These have a meaningful chance of stalling or being deferred indefinitely, especially if not a top coalition priority.

**Most suitable:** (1) as the anchor (topic-specific), with an adjustment toward (2)/(3) to reflect that the 2025 bill has procedurally advanced further than earlier attempts.

A simple way to avoid overreacting to a tiny sample is to use **Laplace smoothing** on (1): with 0 successes out of 3, a smoothed estimate is (0+1)/(3+2)=**20%** for eventual enactment. Then we adjust downward for the **tight deadline**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-11  
- **Deadline for passage:** before **2026-04-01 (UTC)**  
- **Time remaining:** ~**7 weeks**.

Pattern considerations:
- The bill passed **first reading on Nov 11, 2025**. If it still has not completed committee work by mid-February (per the agent synthesis), that implies a **~3-month gap** without final passage.
- In many parliaments (including Israel), a bill *can* be fast-tracked through second+third readings quickly once leadership decides—yet when a bill has already sat for months post–first reading, it often signals unresolved coalition, legal, or prioritization issues.

So even if “eventual passage sometime in 2026+” were moderate, **passage within 7 weeks** is a stricter condition and typically substantially lower.

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)
Outside-view reasoning emphasizes structural and historical regularities:

- **Strong historical headwind:** Israel has been effectively abolitionist in practice; repeated targeted death-penalty initiatives have **failed to become law** despite periodic political pushes. That suggests deep recurring blockers (security establishment concerns, coalition fissures, legal constraints, or agenda displacement).
- **Procedural friction + time compression:** The bill needs **two additional readings** and is reportedly still in committee months after first reading. Historically, bills that do not move for months often face nontrivial remaining bargaining, which is hard to resolve inside a 7-week window.
- **Upset potential:** Israeli politics can move abruptly (crises, coalition discipline, legislative bursts). That argues against driving the probability to near-zero—but “abrupt bursts” are not the modal outcome.

Overall, the outside view says: this type of policy change is *attempted* repeatedly but *rarely completed*, and the remaining time is short relative to observed legislative pacing so far.

Outside view calibration:
- **Anchor (topic-specific base rate):** ~0/3 prior similar initiatives enacted → smoothed to **~20%** for enactment in general (acknowledging tiny-n uncertainty).
- **Adjust for deadline (7 weeks) rather than “eventual” passage:** discount meaningfully. A rough heuristic: if “eventual passage” is ~20%, “pass by a near deadline” might be something like **half to two-thirds of that** when the bill is not already on the verge of final votes.
- **Domain upsets:** not negligible (coalitions can push laws through quickly), so avoid single digits unless there’s clear evidence of imminent collapse. But outside view alone doesn’t justify >30% given the historical pattern.

This leads me to a calibrated outside-view probability in the high teens.

Outside View Prediction:
**18.6%**
