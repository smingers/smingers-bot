Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question & criteria  
“Before 1 Apr 2026, will the Knesset complete second- and third-reading votes and publish the Penal Bill (Amendment No 159) – Death Penalty for Terrorists – as law?”

2. Outside-view base rate (previous step)  
Repeated Israeli death-penalty bills: 0/3 enacted → Laplace-smoothed 20 % chance of ever passing; shorter, seven-week window implies ≈ 18 %.

3. Source analysis (condensed to the most decision-relevant items)  
• Knesset press releases, 3 & 11 Nov 2025 – primary, factual: bill passed committee and first reading 39-16.  
• Adalah briefing, 19 Jan 2026 – NGO advocacy but factual timeline: three committee hearings scheduled this week; “final votes expected in coming weeks”; claims one opposition party on board.  
• BBC, 31 Jan 2026 – neutral, confirms first reading and notes broad public shift but no new procedural step.  
• i24NEWS / Channel 13, 9 Feb 2026 – mainstream Israeli TV: Prison Service already building execution site; reporter adds bill is “still far from final approval.”  
• Anadolu Agency, 11 Feb 2026 – wire report quoting government legal advisers opposing key clauses; confirms still in committee.  
• Jerusalem Post, 11 Feb 2026 – centre-right daily: reiterates committee stage; Ben-Gvir touts “most important law,” but no plenum date set.  
(Source quality: high for Knesset releases & mainstream news; advocacy pieces used only for factual timeline.)

4. Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence (for passage)  
A. Coalition arithmetic: current government 64/120; Jewish Power (6 seats) demands bill, and Netanyahu now publicly supports it – structural.  
B. Fast-track language in committee minutes / Adalah report – direct procedural momentum.

Strong evidence (against on-time passage)  
C. Only seven weeks remain until usual pre-Passover recess; bill still lacks committee report and plenum scheduling – structural clock.

Moderate evidence (against)  
D. Security-establishment & Attorney-General objections aired 11 Feb – could stall drafting.  
E. International/U.S. pressure and looming High Court review – political drag.

Moderate evidence (for)  
F. Prison Service physical preparations signal cabinet expects quick enactment.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Window: ≈ 50 days.  If halved (25 d) my estimate would drop to ~11 %.  If doubled (100 d) it would rise to ~37 %.

6. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Starting at 18 %:  
+6 %  because coalition has clear majority and the bill is a declared demand of a pivotal partner.  
+4 %  due to explicit committee fast-tracking and statements that final votes “in coming weeks.”  
-3 %  for legal/security establishment resistance that has derailed all prior attempts.  
-2 %  for very tight calendar and lack of a plenum date as of 11 Feb.  
Net: 18 % + 6 + 4 – 3 – 2 = 23 %.

Consistency check  
“Roughly 23 times out of 100, the Knesset will complete passage of this bill by 1 Apr 2026.”

Key evidence bullets (≤ 20 words each)  
• Coalition holds 64 seats; loss of Jewish Power (6) risks majority.  
• Netanyahu has flipped to public support after ceasefire.  
• Committee chair scheduled three rapid hearings; one already done.  
• No plenum vote scheduled; recess starts end-March.  
• Attorney-General, IDF, Foreign Ministry warn of severe fallout.

Blind-spot scenario  
Major terror attack or coalition crisis prompts emergency session; bill rammed through in two days – probability would exceed 60 %.

Status-quo bias check  
Doing nothing keeps bill in committee past recess; “No” is default, suggesting a slight downward nudge – reflected.

Probability calibration  
I expect a 10 % swing (to 13 % or 33 %) would require clear news of either a scheduled plenum vote or credible postponement.

Checklist: outside view anchored; internal arithmetic consistent; main evidence validated; blind spot named.

Probability: 23%
