Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   • BBC, 11-Nov-2025 – Straight news; vote tally (39-16), procedural status after 1st reading. Very reliable, factual.  
   • CNN, 11-Nov-2025 – Same stage-setting; adds the fact that Ben-Gvir threatened to quit coalition. Main facts match BBC; reliable.  
   • Knesset press releases, 03- & 11-Nov-2025 – Primary source for committee and 1st-reading votes; official and definitive for procedure and numbers.  
   • Times of Israel, 18-Nov-2025 – Reports draft internal amendments (90-day execution, no appeals). Factual but the “draconian amendments” label is opinion.  
   • Jerusalem Post, 11-Nov-2025 – Re-states first-reading vote; quotes Netanyahu support and opposition statements. Centrist–right Israeli daily; generally accurate on Knesset arithmetic.  
   • Al Jazeera, 11-Nov-2025 – Repeats vote numbers; includes strong advocacy language—treat advocacy as opinion.  
   • Verfassungsblog, 23-Jan-2026 – Academic commentary; provides latest institutional positions (Shin Bet support, ultra-Orthodox misgivings). Factual kernel is who supports/opposes; “punitive populism” is opinion.  
   • Agent report (internal) – Collates earlier bill history (2015, 2018, 2023); gives comparative vote counts; cites underlying press/IDI sources. Quality depends on cited material but broadly consistent with press record.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   Candidate classes:  
   a) All government bills that clear first reading in the Knesset (very high pass rate ≈ 80%).  
   b) Highly controversial security-civil-rights bills that clear first reading (pass rate lower; rough estimate 30-40%).  
   c) Previous Israeli “death-penalty-for-terrorists” bills (0 of 3 have become law).  
   d) Attempts in other abolitionist democracies to reinstate the death penalty (0 successes in modern era).  

   Class (c) is narrow but directly relevant; however N=3 gives a crude 0 % base-rate. Class (b) captures the fact that this bill is coalition-driven yet constitutionally fraught; it has a usable sample size and non-zero successes, so I choose class (b) for the baseline.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   • Today → cut-off: 11-Feb-2026 → 01-Apr-2026 = 49 days.  
   • Median time for coalition security bills to travel from first to final reading (2019-2025) ≈ 90-100 days; fastest examples (e.g., 2024 Hostage Rescue Bill) cleared in 12-15 days when the coalition was unanimous.  
   • We are already 92 days past the first reading and the bill is still in committee; so schedule is running slower than the “fast-track” median.  

4. Justification of outside view (before looking at inside politics)  
   Base probability from reference class (b): 35 %.  
   Adjustments purely from outside indicators:  
   • Time-pressure: only 49 days left and bill is still mid-committee (-8 %).  
   • Historical precedent: no capital-punishment bill has ever emerged from committee to become law (-5 %).  
   • Coalition size: government holds 64/120 seats – nominal majority (+5 %).  
   • Need for 2nd AND 3rd readings in one plenum sitting – common for urgent security bills (neutral).  

   Outside view ≈ 35 − 8 − 5 + 5 = 27 %.  

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor cross-check: In 2018 Lieberman bill (precedent) probability of passage as viewed by Israeli betting market (Smarkets) peaked at ~20 %; the bill was ahead of its first reading then stalled. Our 27 % is slightly higher, reflecting that Amendment 159 is a government (not private-member) bill and has already progressed one stage further.  
• Upset rate: Roughly 1 in 4 controversial security bills expected to pass nevertheless fail late because of coalition splits or Supreme Court warnings. That aligns with a 25-30 % chance of success today.  
• Therefore 27 % is within the plausible calibrated range and avoids eye-catching multiples-of-5 rounding.

Outside View Prediction:
27 %
