Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Adalah (19 Jan 2026) – NGO legal brief, hostile to the bill but fact-checking shows: bill number, passed first reading, National Security Committee holding three fast-track meetings that week, “final votes expected in the coming weeks.”  Factual legislative timeline = high value; rhetoric = opinion.  
2. BBC (31 Jan 2026) – Main-stream international outlet. Confirms 39–16 first-reading vote, explains remaining two readings, quotes sponsors and critics.  High reliability, neutral tone.  
3. i24NEWS (9 Feb 2026) – Israeli TV network. Reports Prison Service logistical preparations; explicitly says bill “far from final approval.”  Good for gauging executive branch planning; moderate reliability.  
4. Jerusalem Post (11 Feb 2026) – Main Israeli daily. Notes bill is “now under committee review” after first reading. Current status, moderate reliability, little new detail.  
5. Anadolu Agency (11 Feb 2026) – Turkish state wire. Quotes Israeli legal experts warning of international fallout; repeats committee stage facts.  Reliable for bare facts, but advocacy framing.  
6. Amnesty statement via Al Jazeera (3 Feb 2026) – NGO opinion piece. Gives no new procedural facts; useful only as evidence of mounting diplomatic pressure.  
7. France 24 / AFP wire (10-11 Nov 2025) – contemporaneous record of the first-reading vote; historical anchor.  
8. Knesset official site (cited across articles, checked separately) – first reading recorded on 11 Nov 2025; no committee report submitted yet (as of 11 Feb 2026).  Primary source, highest reliability.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Coalition size: governing bloc still holds ≈64/120 seats (structural, difficult to change).  
• National-Security Committee holding accelerated hearings (multiple independent sources: Adalah, BBC, Anadolu).  
Moderate evidence  
• Executive agencies already preparing gallows facility (i24NEWS, France 24 citing Ch. 13).  Indicates belief in passage but not causally decisive.  
• Netanyahu’s public reversal to support the bill (BBC, CNN).  
• One opposition party signalling silence or tacit support (Adalah).  
Weak evidence  
• International/UN/NGO condemnation (Amnesty, Anadolu) – may raise costs but has seldom killed Israeli security legislation.  
• Legal and security-establishment misgivings (Anadolu). Past pattern shows they can slow but rarely stop if coalition is united.  
• Risk of government collapse before April (speculative).

Net weight: momentum toward passage is genuine; counter-pressures exist but are mostly soft-power or advisory.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to deadline: 49 (11 Feb → 1 Apr 2026). Three procedural steps remain:  
1. Committee finishes clause-by-clause version.  
2. 24-hour lay-over for MKs.  
3. Second & third readings (often held consecutively).  
Knesset winter session normally runs till just before Passover (around 27 Mar 2026), so there are roughly 6–7 plenum weeks available.  
If the window were halved to 24 days, probability would drop to ≈25% because agenda crowding becomes severe.  If doubled to 98 days, probability would rise to ≈60% – plenty of sittings after Passover recess.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (controversial security bills that must clear two readings inside two months) = 13%.  
Up-shift drivers  
+ Fast-track committee scheduling and sponsor rhetoric (moderate → ×1.9).  
+ Stable governing majority and PM’s endorsement (strong → ×1.7).  
+ Prison Service already investing resources, signalling cabinet commitment (moderate → ×1.3).  
Down-shift drivers  
– Need to draft compromise text acceptable to Attorney-General; past death-penalty bills died here (moderate → ×0.7).  
– Only 7 sitting weeks and many wartime agenda items; slippage plausible (moderate → ×0.8).  
– Small but real chance of coalition crisis or early dissolution (weak-to-moderate → ×0.9).

13% × 1.9 × 1.7 × 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.8 × 0.9 ≈ 39%.

Qualitative sanity check: “about two in five” feels consistent with a situation where the coalition can ram the bill through quickly if it chooses, but schedule and legal friction could easily delay it past 1 April.

Probability calibration
I therefore estimate a 39 % chance that the Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159) passes its second and third readings and becomes law before 1 April 2026 UTC.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will the Israeli death-penalty-for-terrorists bill complete 2nd & 3rd readings and be enacted by 1 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated = 13 %.  
3. Consistency – “39 times out of 100, the bill becomes law before the deadline.”  
4. Key evidence (short):  
   • Fast-track committee hearings under way.  
   • Coalition still 64 seats, PM now supportive.  
   • Prison Service building execution site.  
   • Only ~7 sitting weeks remain.  
5. Blind-spot – sudden security establishment veto or hostage deal forcing Netanyahu to shelve vote could drive probability to <10%.  
6. Status-quo outcome – No-pass remains more likely (61 %), nudged upward toward it in final figure.

Probability: 39%
