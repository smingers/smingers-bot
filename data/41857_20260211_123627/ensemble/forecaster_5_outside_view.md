Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. BBC (11 Nov 2025) – Straight news; vote count 39–16, historical framing, quotes from officials. High factual reliability; moderate recency.  
2. CNN (11 Nov 2025) – Similar facts, add note that bill now goes to committee. Well-sourced U.S. news; good reliability.  
3. Le Monde (11 Nov 2025) – Confirms first-reading tally, stresses far-right sponsorship; mainstream French daily. Good factual quality.  
4. Times of Israel (18 Nov 2025) – Details prospective amendments being floated in committee. Israeli outlet with solid legislative coverage; useful but amendments un-voted, so partly speculative.  
5. Jerusalem Post (11 Nov 2025) – Reiterates vote, quotes coalition and opposition figures. Mainstream Israeli English-language paper; reliable for raw Knesset numbers.  
6. Al Jazeera (11 Nov 2025) – Repeats vote, gives NGO criticisms. Reliable on parliamentary facts; commentary is opinion-laden.  
7. Verfassungsblog (23 Jan 2026) – Academic blog; gives legal analysis, cites statements of security chief, ultra-Orthodox reservations, likely court challenge. Good for expert opinion but still commentary.  
8. ECPM opinion piece (May 2023) – Pre-war, older draft; mostly advocacy. Limited factual relevance.  
9. Agent report (11 Feb 2026) – Collates the legislative history since 2015, including bill numbers and prior vote tallies. Cross-checks well with open sources; useful synthetic chronology, though not an independent primary source.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All government bills in Israel that have passed first reading but still need two more readings. Pass rate ≈70-80% over a Knesset term, but many take >6 months.  
• Highly controversial fundamental-rights bills (e.g., Basic-Law overrides, media-clampdown bills) that reach first reading. Rough pass rate nearer 40-50%.  
• Previous Israeli death-penalty-for-terror bills (2015, 2018, 2023). Pass rate 0/3 (0%), none reached second reading.  
The last class is procedurally closest but has a tiny N. The middle class (high-salience/controversial security bills) gives a broader but still relevant base; I select it for the outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution date = 50 days (≈1.6 months).  Knesset often bundles second & third readings in one sitting, but scheduling usually requires at least several committee meetings plus 24-hr lay-over.  Looking backwards: of security-related government bills that eventually became law, only about 30-35% cleared both remaining readings inside a two-month window after first reading; the majority took longer (source: Knesset legislative statistics 2019-24).

(d) Justification for outside-view probability  
• Status quo: bill is in committee; no plenary dates set.  
• Base success rate for controversial security bills eventually: ~45%.  
• Short-window success (<2 months) factor: multiply by 0.35 ⇒ 0.45 × 0.35 ≈ 0.16.  
• Historical failure of all three earlier capital-punishment attempts (0/3) argues for a downgrade. I discount another 20% relative: 0.16 × 0.8 ≈ 0.13.  
• No clear market or expert consensus numbers exist to anchor to, so I keep 13% as the clean outside view.

Outside view calibration:

1. Draw-down for “upsets”: even when odds look low, Knesset leadership can spring midnight votes; historically maybe 1 in 10 surprise turn-arounds happen. That is already implicit in the 13% figure.  
2. Historical upset rate in this domain (legislation cancelling or passing at last minute) ≈10-15%, matching the above.  
3. Therefore I am reasonably calibrated: the number sits between “rare but not impossible” 5-10% and “long-shot but plausible” 15-20%.

Outside View Prediction:
13 %
