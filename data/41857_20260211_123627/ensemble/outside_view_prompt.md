You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will Israel pass the Penal Bill (Death Penalty for Terrorists amendment) into law before April 2026?

Question background:
On November 3, 2025, ​Israel's [National Security Committee convened and voted to approve](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press31125r.aspx?) the first reading of two bills entitled the Penal Bill (Amendment—Death Penalty for Terrorists).&#x20;

> The explanatory notes to the bill state that its purpose is to curtail terrorism and create a weighty deterrent. It is proposed that a terrorist who is convicted of murder from a motive of racism or hostility against a population, and under circumstances in which the act was committed with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the national revival of the Jewish people in its land, will be sentenced to a mandatory death penalty. This will be neither optional nor with \[judicial] discretion. Additionally, the bill proposes that it will be possible to impose a death sentence by majority opinion, and that the penalty imposed on a person who was given a final sentence cannot be commuted.

On November 11, 2025, the [Knesset Plenum (the central and supreme authoritative body of the Knesset) approved the first reading 39 to 16](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press111125q.aspx).&#x20;

As reported by [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpv13rxpgk9o),&#x20;

> Far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets.

As reported by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl),&#x20;

> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza. However, he has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire.

The bill has been described as "controversial" by Western sources, but its sponsors have stated its importance in light of recent events and current conflicts.

> MK Sonn Har Melech: “I stand here in the name of all the bereaved brothers, widows and orphans. I stand here in the name of my own personal orphans. A death penalty for terrorists is a personal and national obligation. I stand here before you in the name of the thousands of combatants and murder victims and their families, and I am crying out that the time has come to change the preconception. This bill is a moral and national response, it is a bill of justice, which says that Jewish blood is not forfeit."
> &#x20;
> MK Vaturi: “This is a watershed moment. I think that this bill is very important for the people of Israel. We must not be ashamed and bow our head. We must pass this bill. After October 7, there are no more doubts. We owe this to our murdered brothers."
> &#x20;
> MK Tzvika Foghel (Otzma Yehudit): “This is a historic moment. Whoever comes to murder Jews from hatred of the State of Israel—will bear the consequences. There will be no more hotels for terrorists, there will be no more release deals. This is a first and significant step towards creating real deterrence and justice for the victims."

The Penal Bill (Amendment—Death Penalty for Terrorists) will need to pass second and third readings before it can officially pass into law.

# Summary of BBC Article: "Israel bill proposing death penalty for those it deems terrorists passes first reading"

**Date:** November 11, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Vote Results:** The bill's first reading passed in the 120-seat Knesset by 39 votes to 16.

2. **Historical Context:** The death penalty exists for a small number of crimes in Israel but has only been used twice since 1948. The last execution was Adolf Eichmann in 1962.

3. **Hostage Exchange:** Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza a month ago in exchange for 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

4. **Gaza Ceasefire Deal:** 20 living hostages were sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.

5. **October 7, 2023 Attacks:** Some 1,200 people were killed in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters.

6. **Gaza War Casualties:** The Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza during the war.

## Key Provisions of the Bill:

- The bill proposes **mandatory** death penalty for terrorists convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, where the act was committed with intent to harm the State of Israel.
- The clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.
- The bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.

## Named Source Opinions:

**Supporters:**

- **Itamar Ben-Gvir (Far-right National Security Minister, Jewish Power party):** Celebrated by handing out sweets and stated: "After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell."

- **Limor Son Har-Melech (Jewish Power member, bill sponsor):** Commented "A dead terrorist does not get released alive." She shared her personal story of her husband being killed by Palestinian gunmen in 2003, with one killer later released in an exchange deal.

**Opponents:**

- **Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry:** Called the proposed law a "new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people."

- **Palestinian human rights organisations:** Said the "most alarming aspect" would be potential retroactive application, suggesting its intent was "executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October."

- **Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI):** (In context of related media bill) Argued that similar legislation "violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press."

## Additional Context:

- The bill had been previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This is no longer a concern since hostages returned after the Gaza ceasefire last month.

- Ben-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal.

- Israel's justice minister is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the October 7, 2023 attacks.

## Related Legislation:

The same Knesset session approved the first reading of another controversial bill (50 in favor, 41 against) allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval, aimed at making the Al Jazeera closure permanent. This bill has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.

- UN experts said last year that "in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution – the Israeli military"

**Additional Legislation:**

# Summary of Verfassungsblog Article (January 23, 2026)

## Key Facts and Context:

**Historical Background:**
- Israel has long been considered an abolitionist state, having executed only one person in its history: Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi general involved in the Holocaust
- Israel officially abolished the death penalty for murder in 1954, maintaining it only for exceptional crimes (Holocaust, Genocide, treason)
- Past attempts to reinstate the death penalty have been unsuccessful, with the security establishment traditionally opposing it on grounds that it wouldn't increase deterrence and would exacerbate tensions

**Current Bill Details:**
- The bill amends the Israeli Criminal Code to make the death penalty mandatory for those who "intentionally or carelessly causes the death of an Israeli citizen, motivated by racism or hatred towards the public […] and with the intention to harm the State of Israel and the existence of the Jewish people in their Land"
- The bill also orders IDF military courts in the occupied West Bank to impose capital punishment on murderers convicted there (only Palestinians are tried in these courts)
- The wording is explicitly intended to target Palestinian terrorism exclusively, not Jewish terrorist activity

**Explicit Statements from Bill Sponsors:**
- MK Limor Son Har-Melech stated "there is no such thing as a Jewish terrorist" (despite several Jewish convicted terrorists currently serving life sentences for murdering Palestinians)
- Minister of Finance Smotrich argued the law might apply to Jews "if there are traitors among us"

**Support and Opposition:**

*Support:*
- The new government-appointed Shin Bet Chief (head of Israel's antiterrorism service) backs the bill, arguing it would increase deterrence—representing a shift from the security establishment's traditional opposition
- Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir has pledged to leave the coalition if the bill does not pass
- Members of Ben Gvir's party recently began wearing yellow pins shaped like hanging nooses

*Opposition:*
- Human rights organizations emphasize the discriminatory framework creating a two-tier system subjecting only Palestinians to capital punishment
- Opposition leaders argue the bill will lead to more terrorism as vengeance for executions
- Jewish religious leaders oppose it on grounds it would bring "bloodshed"
- Some Ultra-Orthodox MKs have announced they will oppose the bill following directives from Rabbis
- The Israeli Association for Civil Rights has pledged to petition the Supreme Court if approved, calling the law "cruel, unjust, and racist"

**Implementation Details:**
- Execution methods are already being discussed, with the Knesset Research Center publishing a survey of US execution methods (lethal injection, gas chamber, electric chair, firing squad)
- A separate special bill is being advanced concurrently to facilitate trials of October 7 perpetrators under Israel's Genocide law, since the main bill cannot be applied retroactively

**Next Steps:**
- The bill still needs to pass second and third readings in the Knesset
- Constitutional petitions are expected to challenge its discriminatory framework
- Past Supreme Court precedent has struck down laws differentiating between Jews and Arabs, but it's unclear whether the Court will rule this law discriminatory

**Broader Context (Author's Analysis):**
The author frames this as part of a "capital punishment revivalism trend in populist regimes," citing examples of populist leaders in Europe (Viktor Orban in Hungary, Marine Le Pen in France, Mateusz Morawiecki in Poland) and elsewhere (Kyrgyzstan) who have called for reinstating the death penalty, though EU Charter prohibitions make actual reinstatement unlikely in Europe.

**Author's Perspective:** Noam Kozlov presents this bill critically, characterizing it as discriminatory and part of "punitive populism," warning that Israel could be "setting a dangerous precedent" for other countries.

# Summary of ECPM Opinion Article (May 12, 2023)

**Note:** This article is from May 2023 and discusses an earlier version of death penalty legislation in Israel, not the specific 2025 bill mentioned in the question.

## Key Facts and Context:

1. **Historical background on death penalty in Israel:**
   - Israel abolished the death penalty for murder in 1954
   - Still remains on the books for: war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the Jewish people, treason, and crimes committed during wartime under military law
   - Death sentence handed down only twice in Israel's history:
     - 1948: IDF officer Meir Tobianski (executed on espionage charges, later found innocent)
     - 1962: Adolf Eichmann (Holocaust perpetrator)

2. **The bill discussed (2023 version):**
   - Would sentence to death anyone who murders an Israeli "due to motivations of racism or hostility toward a certain group, with the goal of harming the state of Israel and the revival of the Jewish people"
   - On March 27 [2023], the government delayed further votes on the bill

3. **Global context:**
   - 119 countries have abolished the death penalty de jure
   - Another 27 have abolished it de facto or imposed a moratorium
   - 75% of UN member states have abolished the death penalty either de jure or de facto
   - Most are liberal democracies

## Opinions from Named Sources:

1. **Chief Sephardi Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef:** Has denounced legislation like this

2. **Robert Badinter (former French justice minister):** "Capital punishment may deter criminals, but between terrorists and death there is a concealed link, a distorted and worrisome permanent connection. Capital punishment will only further increase the aura of martyrdom."

3. **Raphaël Chenuil-Hazan (ECPM director and president of the French Platform for Human Rights - the article's author):** 
   - Argues the death penalty would violate fundamental values on which Israel was founded
   - Claims it would be ineffective against terrorism and would make terrorism "thrive even more"
   - Warns it would be "a two-edged sword" - if applied to terrorists generally, it would apply to Jewish terrorists like Yigal Amir or Amiram Ben-Uliel; if applied only to Palestinian terrorists, it would be "a racist, discriminatory law"
   - Calls for complete revocation of capital punishment and ratification of the second protocol of the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

## Religious/Cultural Context:

- The article claims the death penalty "isn't part of Jewish culture and tradition"
- Cites 1st-century Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah who said a Sanhedrin that executes people would be a "murderous court"
- Cites Rabbis Tarfon and Akiva who said they would never have applied the death penalty (Talmud, Tractate Makkot, 10 a)

# Summary of Article: "Knesset panel working on death penalty bill mulls series of draconian amendments"

**Source:** Times of Israel  
**Date:** November 18, 2025

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Proposed Amendments to the Bill:**
The Knesset committee preparing the death penalty bill for further readings is considering several amendments not included in the earlier version:

1. Death sentences must be enacted within 90 days of being handed down
2. The death penalty would be mandatory for:
   - Anyone who kills a Jewish person
   - Those who send others to commit deadly attacks
   - Those found to be planning attacks
3. No possibility of appealing against the death sentence
4. No option to avert the sentence through plea bargain or pardon
5. Execution method: lethal injection by prison authorities
6. 90-day execution timeline intended to prevent "any possibility of avoiding carrying out the sentence"

**Committee Process:**
- The bill is sponsored by MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit party)
- MK Zvika Fogel (Otzma Yehudit), who chairs the committee, reportedly sent the message detailing these amendments via WhatsApp
- Opposition members on the committee expressed confusion about the document, with some suggesting it may have been sent to the wrong group

**Media Assessment:**
Channel 12 assessed that the WhatsApp distribution was likely "a publicity stunt by far-right members of the committee" and that "the chances of the High Court of Justice allowing such a law to come into effect were low."

**Criticism:**
Opponents have criticized that the bill would apply only to Arabs who kill Jews and not to Jewish terrorists.

**Historical Context:**
- Death penalty formally exists in Israeli law but has only been used once: in 1962 for Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann
- Currently allowed for high treason and certain circumstances under martial law, but requires unanimous decision from three judges
- Previous attempt in March 2023 passed initial reading 55-9 but did not advance due to government and security service opposition
- After October 7, 2023 Hamas invasion, officials feared the law would harm hostage negotiations
- Following recent ceasefire and hostage release, Ben Gvir gave Netanyahu an ultimatum to advance the bill
- First reading passed last week 39-16

- Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations assert that detainees are subject to torture, starvation and medical neglect that has led to deaths
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Give a timeline of all legislative attempts to introduce a mandatory death penalty for terrorists in Israel, including bill numbers, dates of first, second, and third readings, voting tallies, and reasons for success or failure; emphasise the 2018 Yisrael Beiteinu initiative and compare it with the 2025 Penal Bill Amendment No. 159.
Below is a consolidated chronology of every identifiable Knesset effort since 2015 to create a mandatory (or procedurally-easier) death penalty for persons convicted of terrorist murder.  For each bill the formal title (where available), bill/ amendment number, parliamentary milestones, vote counts and the main reasons for the initiative’s advance or demise are set out.  The two most policy-relevant cases—the 2018 Yisrael Beiteinu initiative and the current Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159) 2025—are then compared in greater depth.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 19 July 2015 – “Penal Code (Amendment – Death Penalty for Terrorists) Bill” 2015
• Sponsor: MK Avigdor Lieberman and the Yisrael Beiteinu faction (then in opposition).  
• Content: would have allowed military courts to impose death by simple majority (instead of unanimity).  The word “mandatory” was not yet used, but the intent was to make capital punishment practically attainable.  
• Plenum status: Preliminary reading defeated, 6 in favour, 94 against (In These Times, 10 Jun 2016).  
• Why it failed: broad coalition (Likud, centrist and left parties) and the entire security establishment opposed it, arguing it would inflame violence and endanger Israelis abroad.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2. 3 January 2018 – “Penal Code (Amendment – Death Penalty for Terrorists) Bill” 2017-18  
• Sponsor: Yisrael Beiteinu, now inside the governing coalition; backed publicly by Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman.  
• Bill number: Government Bill 1203/20/P (designation taken from the Knesset Bill Book used that session – not quoted in press but appears in committee dockets).  
• Preliminary reading (only stage reached): passed 52 – 49 (Mondoweiss, 6 Mar 2023; IDI briefing, 29 Jan 2018).  
• Stalling point: sent to the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee but never scheduled for a first reading.  
• Why it failed:  
 – United opposition from the Shin Bet, IDF Judge Advocate-General and the Attorney-General, who argued the measure would encourage kidnapping of soldiers to secure prisoner exchanges (IDI, 29 Jan 2018).  
 – Collapse of Lieberman’s participation in the coalition in November 2018 removed its political sponsor.  
• Outcome: Bill lapsed at the end of the 20th Knesset in December 2018.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3. 1 March 2023 – “Penal Code (Amendment – Death Penalty for Terrorists) Bill” 2023  
• Sponsors: MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit) with a near-identical annex bill tabled by MK Oded Forer (Yisrael Beiteinu).  
• Preliminary reading: passed 55 – 9 (Mondoweiss, 6 Mar 2023; Adalah briefing, 2023).  
• Key provisions: mandatory death sentence for intentional or indifferent killing motivated by racism/hostility; majority vote sufficient; sentence non-commutable.  
• What happened next: The National Security Committee opened preparation but the bill was frozen in June 2023 on advice that executions would endanger Israeli hostages held in Gaza and harm foreign relations.  No first reading was ever scheduled; the draft therefore expired with the dissolution of the 25th Knesset in October 2023.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4. 3 November 2025 – Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159 – Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025  **ACTIVE**
• Sponsors: Government bill initiated by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit); co-sponsored inside the coalition by Likud and Religious Zionism.  
• Key text (explanatory notes quoted by Knesset press office):  a terrorist “convicted of murder from a motive of racism or hostility … with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the national revival of the Jewish people in its land, will be sentenced to a mandatory death penalty… the penalty … cannot be commuted.”  Majority verdict suffices in both civilian and West-Bank military courts.  
Chronology and votes to date  
 • 3 Nov 2025 – National Security Committee approved the bill for first reading (Knesset press release, 3 Nov 2025).  
 • 11 Nov 2025 – First reading in Plenum PASSED 39 – 16, with most opposition factions boycotting (Haaretz, 10 Nov 2025; BBC, 31 Jan 2026).  
 • Dec 2025 – Committee stage under MK Zvika Fogel; three hearings held and revised draft released 27 Jan 2026 (Jerusalem Story, 28 Jan 2026).  
 • Status February 2026: still in committee; second and third readings not yet scheduled.  

• Political/ institutional posture:  
 – Prime-Minister Netanyahu reversed earlier opposition after hostage crisis ended (CNN, 10 Nov 2025).  
 – Shin Bet Director David Zini publicly backed the bill—first time the agency has supported executions (Times of Israel, 21 Nov 2025).  
 – IDF is lukewarm; Haredi parties signal possible opposition at third reading on halakhic grounds (Haaretz, 10 Nov 2025; BBC, 31 Jan 2026).  
• Objections: Israeli and international NGOs label it “racist” and “unconstitutional” because wording confines applicability to Palestinians (Adalah statement, 10 Dec 2025; Al-Haq urgent appeal, Dec 2025).

Outstanding information gaps

1. Exact Knesset serial numbers for the 2015 and 2023 private members’ bills and the full Hebrew text PDFs.  
2. Committee vote tallies (mk-by-mk) for the 3 Nov 2025 National Security Committee approval, and for the 2018 Constitution Committee referral.  
3. Confirmation of the formal bill number of the 2018 draft in the Knesset “Hok Hamedina” database (only partial press references are available).  
4. Any amendments adopted in committee since 27 Jan 2026 that might affect the scope or satisfy Haredi objections.

Acquiring those records would require consulting the Knesset’s internal Bill Book (`https://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawBills.aspx`) and the verbatim Committee Protocols, which are not reproduced in the open-access press releases.

Implications for the forecasting question (“Will Amendment No. 159 pass before 1 Apr 2026?”)

• Precedent shows every earlier attempt has stalled after the preliminary or first reading once security or coalition arithmetic shifted.  
• Yet Amendment No. 159 has already progressed further than any predecessor (first reading completed, security establishment no longer objects).  
• The remaining hurdle is chiefly political: the bill needs at least 61 votes in both second and third readings.  The governing coalition controls 64 seats but two Haredi parties (18 seats) have hinted they may vote “No” on halakhic grounds, potentially sinking the bill unless wording is softened.  
• Speed: The committee is “fast-tracking”, holding three hearings in one week (Jerusalem Story, 28 Jan 2026).  If the coalition resolves Haredi concerns, the second and third readings could be bundled in a single plenary sitting—as was done for other security-related laws in 2024-25—well before April 2026.  If not, the bill could stall indefinitely like its predecessors.

Conclusion

Since 2015 Israel’s parliament has seen four distinct pushes to institute a death penalty specifically for terrorists.  Only the 2018 Lieberman proposal and the current 2025 Government bill have ever mustered majority support in a plenary vote, but neither has yet become law.  The 2025 Amendment No. 159 is the most sweeping—introducing a non-commutable, mandatory sentence—and, with first reading completed and the security agencies on board, it is closer to enactment than any prior effort.  The decisive variables to watch between now and 1 April 2026 are: (a) whether coalition leaders win over or bypass the Haredi factions; and (b) whether further committee amendments dilute the “mandatory” element to survive High Court scrutiny, which could simultaneously placate religious misgivings and keep the coalition intact.  

Should those hurdles be cleared in time, Israel would, for the first time since 1954, re-introduce capital punishment into its ordinary criminal law, and for the first time ever make it compulsory for a category of offenders.  If either hurdle proves insurmountable, the bill is likely to share the fate of earlier attempts and lapse when the current Knesset term ends.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
