    "description": "On November 3, 2025, \u200bIsrael's [National Security Committee convened and voted to approve](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press31125r.aspx?) the first reading of two bills entitled the Penal Bill (Amendment\u2014Death Penalty for Terrorists).&#x20;\n\n> The explanatory notes to the bill state that its purpose is to curtail terrorism and create a weighty deterrent. It is proposed that a terrorist who is convicted of murder from a motive of racism or hostility against a population, and under circumstances in which the act was committed with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the national revival of the Jewish people in its land, will be sentenced to a mandatory death penalty. This will be neither optional nor with \\[judicial] discretion. Additionally, the bill proposes that it will be possible to impose a death sentence by majority opinion, and that the penalty imposed on a person who was given a final sentence cannot be commuted.\n\nOn November 11, 2025, the [Knesset Plenum (the central and supreme authoritative body of the Knesset) approved the first reading 39 to 16](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press111125q.aspx).&#x20;\n\nAs reported by [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpv13rxpgk9o),&#x20;\n\n> Far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets.\n\nAs reported by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl),&#x20;\n\n> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza. However, he has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire.\n\nThe bill has been described as \"controversial\" by Western sources, but its sponsors have stated its importance in light of recent events and current conflicts.\n\n> MK Sonn Har Melech: \u201cI stand here in the name of all the bereaved brothers, widows and orphans. I stand here in the name of my own personal orphans. A death penalty for terrorists is a personal and national obligation. I stand here before you in the name of the thousands of combatants and murder victims and their families, and I am crying out that the time has come to change the preconception. This bill is a moral and national response, it is a bill of justice, which says that Jewish blood is not forfeit.\"\n> &#x20;\n> MK Vaturi: \u201cThis is a watershed moment. I think that this bill is very important for the people of Israel. We must not be ashamed and bow our head. We must pass this bill. After October 7, there are no more doubts. We owe this to our murdered brothers.\"\n> &#x20;\n> MK Tzvika Foghel (Otzma Yehudit): \u201cThis is a historic moment. Whoever comes to murder Jews from hatred of the State of Israel\u2014will bear the consequences. There will be no more hotels for terrorists, there will be no more release deals. This is a first and significant step towards creating real deterrence and justice for the victims.\"\n\nThe Penal Bill (Amendment\u2014Death Penalty for Terrorists) will need to pass second and third readings before it can officially pass into law.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40865,\"question_id\":40522}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "The question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, UTC, the Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159) (Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025 is passed officially into law in the Knesset according to [the official Knesset website](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/Pages/default.aspx).",
    "fine_print": "It is irrelevant whether the Knesset website is updated before April 1, 2026; all that matters is whether the law itself passes before the deadline.\n\nIf the Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159) (Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025 is modified significantly in content such that it no longer provides for the death penalty, then this question will resolve as **No** even if it is passed into law.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40865) which opened on 2025-11-29 19:44:13. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.",
