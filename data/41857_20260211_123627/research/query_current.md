Analysis:
The bill has cleared only its first reading; the decisive steps are the second and third readings. To gauge likelihood of passage before April 2026 we need: 1) current legislative status (committee deliberations, scheduling of further readings), 2) statements or coalition agreements by Netanyahu, Likud, Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit, 3) positions of key swing MKs or parties (e.g., Shas, United Torah Judaism, National Unity if joining government), and 4) any legal/constitutional obstacles or Supreme Court petitions. Therefore the most relevant news will be recent Knesset press releases, Israeli political outlets (Times of Israel, Haaretz, Jerusalem Post), and wire services covering February 2026 events.
