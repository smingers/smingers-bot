ACRI states dozens of prisoners and detainees have died under these conditions and characterizes the bill as \"another manifestation of a larger policy of vengeance and cruelty.\"\n\n**Note:** This is an advocacy document from a civil rights organization opposing the bill, not a neutral news report. The characterizations and arguments represent ACRI's institutional position.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/defense/artc-prison-service-prepares-for-possible-implementation-of-death-penalty-for-terrorists\">\n# Summary of i24NEWS Article (February 9, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Prison Service Preparations:**\n- Israel's Prison Service has begun making practical preparations for possible implementation of the death penalty for convicted terrorists\n- Preparations include logistical, organizational, and personnel-related measures\n- Plans include establishing a dedicated execution facility\u2014a secluded compound within the prison system, informally dubbed the \"Israeli Green Mile\"\n\n**Execution Procedures (as reported):**\n- Executions would be carried out by hanging\n- Three prison officers would act simultaneously to distribute individual responsibility\n- Participation would be strictly voluntary\n- Selected officers would undergo specialized training on moral, psychological, and operational dimensions\n- Executions could take place within 90 days of a final court ruling\n\n**Scope of Application:**\n- Initially would apply to members of Hamas's Nukhba force directly involved in the October 7 massacre\n- Could later be extended to terrorists convicted of particularly lethal attacks in the West Bank\n\n**Additional Preparations:**\n- A delegation from the Israel Prison Service is expected to travel to an East Asian country to study capital punishment systems still in use\n- The visit aims to examine legal frameworks, operational procedures, and ethical considerations\n\n**Current Status:**\n- The bill remains \"far from final approval\" according to the article\n- Has sparked \"intense legal and moral debate within Israel\"\n- Supporters argue it's necessary for acts of extreme terrorism; opponents cite concerns about democratic values and irreversibility\n\n**Source Attribution:** Report by Channel 13 News (as cited by i24NEWS)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clymp8v7ye2o\">\n# Summary of BBC Article: \"Israel split over plans to bring back death penalty for deadly attacks\"\n\n**Date:** January 31, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Context\n\n- **Historical use of death penalty in Israel:** Only used twice against convicted prisoners. Last execution was over 60 years ago (Adolf Eichmann, Nazi war criminal). Prior to that, military captain Meir Tobianski was executed for treason in June 1948 but was posthumously exonerated.\n\n- **Current death penalty status:** Death penalty exists for certain crimes in Israel, but previous death sentences by military courts were all mitigated to life sentences following appeals (except Eichmann case).\n\n- **Legislative status:** The bill passed its first reading in November (last year) by 39-16 votes in the 120-seat Knesset. It needs to pass three readings total to become law.\n\n## Bill Provisions\n\n- **Mandatory death sentences** would apply in Israeli military courts (which exclusively try Palestinians from the occupied West Bank)\n- After compulsory appeal, those convicted of deadly terrorist attacks would be **hanged within 90 days**\n- In regular Israeli courts, death penalty would be allowed within same timeframe but **not mandatory**\n- Stated purpose: protect Israel, increase deterrence, reduce kidnapping incentives, and provide retribution\n\n## Supporters' Arguments\n\n**Zvika Fogel (far-right chair of parliamentary national security committee, Jewish Power party):**\n- Calls it \"the most moral, the most Jewish and the most decent thing\"\n- Claims current heads of Israel's security services support the effort\n- Insists no discrimination: \"my bill talks about terrorists and about an act of terrorism\"\n- States: \"I don't think there's such a thing as a Jewish terrorist or a Jewish act of terrorism. It's a legal definition.\"\n- Argues it will prevent future prisoner swaps: \"For a prisoner who committed murder, there'll be a death penalty so there won't be a prisoner to make a deal on\"\n\n**Dr Valentina Gusak (bereaved mother, daughter killed at Nova music festival in 2023):**\n- Supports the bill\n- Views it as \"10 or 20 per cent...for justice, and the remaining percentage is deterrence and prevention\"\n- Calls it \"preventive treatment\" and \"a vaccine against the next murder\"\n\n**Limor Son Har-Melech (Jewish Power party member, bill sponsor):**\n- Personal story: husband killed in 2003 attack by Palestinian gunmen; she was injured and gave emergency birth\n- States one of her husband's killers was released in previous exchange deal, went on to command another deadly attack and participate in 7 October attacks before being killed in Gaza war\n\n## Opponents' Arguments\n\n**Human rights groups:**\n- Call it \"one of the most extreme legislative proposals\" in Israel's history\n- Argue it's unethical and will bring about \"racialized capital punishment\" because designed to apply only to Palestinians\n- Argue it violates right to life and risks executing innocent people\n\n**Tal Steiner (executive director, Ha Moked - Israeli NGO):**\n- \"The fact that we're even re-discussing bringing this back into the legal system in Israel is itself a low point\"\n- \"The law is racially designed, meant to apply only to Palestinians, never to Jews, only to people who kill Israeli citizens, never for example to Israeli citizens who kill Palestinians\"\n\n**Aida Touma-Suleiman (Arab-Israeli parliamentarian, opposition Hadash party):**\n- Warns legislators should be careful how they respond (quote appears cut off in article)\n\n**Historical security establishment position:**\n- Previously among main opponents, asserting it increased tensions and was not an effective deterrent\n- Note: Many Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks are already shot dead in the process by security forces or armed civilians\n\n## Political Context\n\n- **Jewish Power party** put forward the bill early in 2023\n- Legislation was put on hold after 7 October attacks because security officials advised it could jeopardize hostage return efforts\n- **Itamar Ben Gvir** (National Security Minister, head of Jewish Power) was one of few ministers to vote against Gaza ceasefire deal that returned last remaining hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners (about 250 serving life or lengthy sentences)\n- Jewish Power threatened to leave government if death penalty legislation wasn't put to vote\n- When bill passed first reading in November, Ben Gvir gave out sweets\n- Jewish Power members of parliament wear golden noose-shaped lapel pins\n\n## Casualty Context\n\n- 7 October 2023 attacks: approximately 1,200 people killed in Israel\n- 251 hostages seized and held in Gaza\n- Gaza war: more than 71,600 Palestinians killed according to Hamas-run Health Ministry\n\n## Public Opinion\n\n- Article notes \"many see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments\" (unnamed/general

Key Facts and Positions:\n\n**Amnesty International's Statement (Tuesday):**\n- Called on Israel to abandon death penalty legislation\n- Warned the measures would violate international law and \"further entrench Israel's apartheid system\" against Palestinians\n- Stated the bills would mark a major reversal of Israel's longstanding opposition to capital punishment\n- Said the death penalty

Israel retains the death penalty for exceptional offenses such as genocide and treason\n\n**Details on the Legislation:**\nAccording to Amnesty International, there are two bills:\n1. One that would allow application of the death penalty by amending the Israeli Penal Law and the Defence Regulations applied to the West Bank\n2.

The law, introduced by the far-right 'Jewish Power' party led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, passed its first reading in November 2025 in the Knesset. It stipulates that anyone causing the death of an Israeli citizen through racist or group-based motives with the intent to harm Israel or the Jewish people may face the death penalty. However, Israeli citizens convicted of similar crimes would only face life imprisonment. The law grants the Defense Minister authority to mandate death sentences for Palestinians from the West Bank involved in 'terrorist' circumstances, a provision not extended to Israelis. Legal experts, including officials from the Defense Ministry and the Justice Ministry, have raised constitutional and international law concerns, noting that the proposed restriction on reducing death penalties for West Bank Palestinians violates the Geneva Conventions. The Defense Ministry has officially opposed including this clause. The law remains under review by the Knesset's National Security Committee, which is hearing objections before moving to second and third readings. Over 9,300 Palestinian prisoners, including women and children, are reportedly held in Israeli prisons, where many face torture, starvation, and medical neglect, resulting in dozens of deaths. Critics describe such laws as discriminatory, aimed at restricting Palestinians, seizing land, and forcing displacement. Israel was established in 1948 on occupied Palestinian land following armed Zionist attacks that included massacres and the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 10:03 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%89/3826741)\n\n**Eliya Cohen calls for hostages to 'press button' on Hamas terrorists as death penalty bill advances**\nEliya Cohen, a former hostage held by Hamas since the October 7, 2023 attack, called for released hostages to 'press the button' to carry out death penalties for Hamas terrorists in an Instagram post on February 11, 2026. His statement followed a Hamas claim that Israel\u2019s proposed death penalty bill for terrorists violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which permits the death penalty only for the most serious crimes under specific conditions. The bill, introduced by the Otzma Yehudit Party and led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, passed its first reading in December 2025 and is now under committee review for second and third readings. The bill proposes the death penalty for terrorists who commit murder, with executions to be carried out by hanging within 90 days of a final court judgment, administered by the Israel Prison Service. Ben-Gvir described the revised bill as the 'most exact' and 'acceptable to the majority of citizens,' calling it 'the most important law in the history of the State of Israel' and asserting it would deter future attacks like October 7. The bill remains pending final approval.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 08:59 AM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-886287)\n\n**In First, Israel Strips Two Convicted Terrorists of Citizenship, Prepares To Deport Them**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on February 10, 2026, that he had signed orders revoking the citizenship and approving the deportation of two convicted terrorists, Mahmoud Ahmad and Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi, under a law passed in February 2023. This marks the first implementation of the legislation, which allows Israel to strip citizenship from convicted terrorists receiving stipends from the Palestinian Authority and deport them. Mahmoud Ahmad, sentenced to 23 years for shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, was released in 2024 and is expected to be deported immediately. Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi, sentenced in 2016 to 18 years for stabbing elderly women in Jerusalem\u2019s Armon HaNatziv neighborhood, will be deported upon his release. Netanyahu stated the law sends a clear message that terrorists face both imprisonment and loss of residency rights. According to Walla, the two men are expected to be deported to the Gaza Strip, though the Prime Minister\u2019s Office did not confirm the destination. The law targets terrorists receiving Palestinian Authority financial support while in prison, with Israeli officials indicating proceedings have been initiated against hundreds of individuals under this framework.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 11:10 PM\nSource:[The Yeshiva World](https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/2510812/in-first-israel-strips-two-convicted-terrorists-of-citizenship-prepares-to-deport-them.html)\n\n**Israel Begins Preparations to Implement Death Penalty for Palestinian Prisoners Amid Controversy**\nThe Israeli Prison Service has begun preparations to implement the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners, ahead of the potential passage of a law that would mandate capital punishment for those involved in terrorist attacks. The initiative, driven by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, includes constructing a facility known as Israel's 'Green Mile' for executions and training specialized volunteer teams. Executions would be carried out by hanging, with three guards simultaneously triggering the mechanism, and sentences would be executed within 90 days of final judgment. The law, which passed first reading in the Knesset with 39 votes in favor and 16 against, does not apply to Israeli Jews who commit similar acts against Palestinians. This selective application has drawn sharp criticism from human rights organizations, including the UN experts, who argue that mandatory death sentences violate the right to life and eliminate judicial discretion. Groups like the Palestinian Detainees' Committee and the Prisoners' Club have condemned the law as 'an unprecedented act of savagery,' accusing Israel of legalizing systematic killings. Legal experts within Israel\u2019s Security Committee have raised constitutional concerns, citing international law violations, including breaches of the Geneva Convention, particularly due to the differential treatment of Palestinians versus Israeli citizens. The law also prevents the Prime Minister from commuting or suspending sentences for Palestinians, unlike for Israeli citizens, where a 180-day suspension is permitted. The law remains pending two further readings in the Knesset before becoming effective.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 09:05 PM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/internacionales/israel/las-carceles-de-israel-inician-preparativos-para-aplicar-la-pena-de-muerte-a-los-palestinos-2026210175823)\n\n**Israel: Exile Penalty Imposed on Two Palestinians Convicted of Terrorism**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Tuesday that he had signed an order for the exile of two Palestinians convicted of terrorism in Israel, marking the first use of a 2023 law allowing the revocation of citizenship or residency permits from individuals who committed anti-Israeli attacks and received money from the Palestinian Authority as 'recompense' for their crimes. Netanyahu stated in a statement, 'I have signed today the revocation of citizenship and expulsion of two Israeli terrorists who carried out knife and firearm attacks against Israeli civilians and were rewarded for their criminal acts by the Palestinian Authority.' He added, 'Many more (expulsions) will follow.' The two men, identified by several Israeli media outlets as Mohammad Hammad Al-Salhi and Mohammad Halasah from East Jerusalem\u2014a sector occupied and annexed by Israel since 1967\u2014were not named in detail by Netanyahu. According to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, an NGO, Al-Salhi, released from prison in 2024 after 23 years, holds Israeli citizenship, while Halasah holds a Jerusalem resident card, which grants residency but not citizenship. Halasah was sentenced to 18 years in prison as a minor and served about half his sentence; he lost his Israeli citizenship 18 months ago. Media reports indicate Al-Salhi\u2019s exile order may be executed soon, while Halasah\u2019s exile will take effect only after his prison term ends. The law used by Netanyahu was criticized by Adalah, an Israeli human rights NGO, as targeting Palestinians exclusively and reinforcing 'racial division and Jewish supremacy.' The law mandates deportation to the West Bank or Gaza. Although the Palestinian Authority announced in early 2025 it had abolished financial support for families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel for attacks, Israel maintains that such 'rewards for murder' continue through other mechanisms.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 07:21 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/96VZ3CQ)\n\n**In first, Israel to revoke citizenship of 2 Israeli terror convicts and deport them**\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed orders revoking the citizenship and deporting two Israeli nationals convicted of terrorism, marking the first implementation of a February 2023 law enabling the deportation of convicted terrorists. The two individuals, Mahmoud Ahmad (sentenced to 23 years for shooting attacks) and Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi (sentenced to 18 years for stabbing elderly women in 2016), were identified by MK Israel Katz, who initiated the law. Ahmad, released in 2024, will be deported immediately, while al-Halsi will be deported upon his release. The Walla news site reported the destination as the Gaza Strip, though the Prime Minister's Office did not confirm it. The law, an amendment to Israel's 1952 Citizenship Law, allows revocation of citizenship and residency for Israeli citizens or permanent residents convicted of terrorism, aiding terrorism, harming sovereignty, incitement to war, or aiding an enemy during wartime, provided they have permanent residence status outside Israel. Revocation requires a hearing, advisory committee consultation, justice minister approval, and court confirmation. The law applies only to those receiving payments from the Palestinian Authority and excludes Jewish terrorists, drawing criticism from Arab lawmakers who called it 'racist' and from a Justice Ministry adviser who warned of potential legal flaws. Netanyahu praised the law as a tool to 'fight terror,' and Katz stated, 'This is how you fight terror.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 06:56 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-israel-to-revoke-citizenship-of-2-israeli-terror-convicts-and-deport-them/)\n\n**Israel to Revoke Citizenship and Expel Two Israelis Convicted of Terrorism**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed orders revoking the citizenship and issuing expulsion notices for two Israeli nationals convicted of terrorism, marking the first application of a law passed in February 2023. The law, proposed by Likud deputy Ofir Katz and supported by Defense Minister Israel Katz, allows for the revocation of citizenship and expulsion of individuals convicted of terrorism, aiding terrorism, undermining Israeli sovereignty, inciting war, or aiding the enemy during wartime. The two individuals, Mahmoud Ahmad\u2014sentenced to 23 years for shooting soldiers and civilians\u2014and Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi\u2014sentenced to 18 years in 2016 for stabbing elderly women in Armon HaNatziv\u2014were both found to have received payments from the Palestinian Authority for their crimes. Ahmad, released in 2024, will be immediately expelled; al-Halsi will be expelled upon his release. According to Walla, they are expected to be sent to the Gaza Strip, though the Prime Minister\u2019s office has not confirmed the destination. The law, an amendment to Israel\u2019s 1952 Citizenship Law, enables the revocation of citizenship even without a second nationality, provided the individual has permanent residency elsewhere; once stripped of citizenship, the person is barred from entering Israel. Netanyahu praised the law as a firm stance in the fight against terrorism, stating, 'There is no compromise in the fight against terrorism,' and commended Ofir Katz for advancing legislation that will expel 'many others like them.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 06:11 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel FR](https://fr.timesofisrael.com/israel-va-revoquer-la-citoyennete-et-expulser-2-israeliens-condamnes-pour-terrorisme/)\n\n**The Blogs: \"Israeli Green Mile\" Killings to Traumatize Israel Prison Service Executioners**\nThe Israel Prison Service (IPS) has begun constructing a facility dubbed the 'Israeli Green Mile'\u2014a reference to the death row corridor in Stephen King's 'The Green Mile'\u2014to prepare for potential future executions of terrorists convicted of murder, despite the Knesset not yet passing a death penalty bill. The facility will reportedly use a remote-controlled gallows, with executions carried out by three volunteer corrections officers following specialized training. A delegation from IPS is set to visit an East Asian country to study active capital punishment systems. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, of Otzma Yehudit, has publicly endorsed the death penalty, stating terrorists who committed atrocities on October 7, 2023, deserve execution by any method, calling it 'just,' 'moral,' and 'a duty.' However, critics, including thousands of members of 'L'chaim! Jews Against the Death Penalty,' argue the death penalty is inherently racist, immoral, and a violation of the right to life. Former Florida warden Ron McAndrew, a death penalty abolitionist, testified before a New Hampshire legislative commission that execution duties caused severe psychological trauma among prison staff, including drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and lifelong guilt. He stated that being forced to execute people discredits the honorable nature of correctional work. The article emphasizes that the death penalty is not a deterrent, risks executing the innocent, incites martyrdom, and has been historically weaponized politically. It further notes that Jewish tradition, shaped by the Holocaust, renders capital punishment nearly impossible to implement, and quotes Elie Wiesel: 'death should never be the answer in a civilized society.' The author urges Israeli lawmakers to reject the bill to avoid inflicting unnecessary trauma on citizens and to uphold ethical and human rights principles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 03:08 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/israeli-green-mile-killings-to-traumatize-israel-prison-service-executioners/)\n\n**Widespread Criticism of Israeli Law Allowing Death Penalty for Palestinian Detainees**\nRatiba Al-Ntisha, a member of the Palestinian National and Civic Action Committee in Jerusalem, criticized a new Israeli law passed by the Knesset that allows the death penalty for Palestinian detainees, citing the justification of 'terrorist crimes.' She stated that this legislative move is part of a broader political strategy by the new head of Shin Bet (Israel's internal security agency) to shift from control and subjugation to openly escalating conflict with Palestinians. Al-Ntisha emphasized that the issue of detainees is highly sensitive and that the new law represents a strategic shift toward deliberately inflaming sensitive issues, including the fate of prisoners. The law has drawn widespread criticism and warnings from human rights organizations about its severe legal and humanitarian consequences.

In a statement released on Monday, February 9, 2026, Hamas described the move as an unprecedented escalation in Israel's policy of 'slow killing' against detainees, characterizing it as part of a systematic campaign of sadism and torture within Israeli prisons. The group highlighted daily mistreatment, medical neglect, and deliberate starvation of prisoners, framing it as an open campaign of annihilation against the Palestinian people. Hamas called on the United Nations, international human rights and humanitarian organizations, and free peoples worldwide to take immediate and effective action to protect prisoners and halt what it termed a 'grave crime.' It affirmed that the Palestinian people will not remain silent and that the issue of prisoners remains a top priority until full freedom is achieved and all complicit parties are held accountable. The Palestinian Prisoners' Society echoed these concerns, stating that Israel's preparations for implementing the death penalty\u2014revealed by Israeli Channel 13\u2014mark the beginning of a highly dangerous phase, representing the 'peak of ongoing annihilation' of prisoners. Twelve UN experts previously urged Israel to withdraw the bill, asserting that Israel's military law in occupied territories violates international law. Israeli far-right Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has demanded the death penalty for those labeled 'terrorists,' stating that the method is irrelevant\u2014whether by hanging, electric chair, or shooting. Channel 13 reported that Israel's Prison Service has begun preparing for implementation, including constructing a dedicated execution complex named 'The Israeli Green Corridor,' establishing protocols, training specialized personnel, and studying foreign models. Executions would be carried out by three guards simultaneously pressing a button, with the process to be completed within 90 days of a final court ruling. Initial implementation is expected to target members of Hamas's elite units accused of involvement in the October 7, 2023 attack, with future applications extending to prisoners accused of attacks in the West Bank.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:15 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/2/9/%d8%ad%d9%85%d8%a7%d8%b3-%d8%a5%d9%82%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%88%d9%86-%d8%a5%d8%b9%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%b1%d9%89-%d9%8a%d9%83%d8%b4%d9%81-%d9%88%d8%ac%d9%87)\n\n**Special Execution Law for Palestinians | World News**\nIsrael's Knesset passed a rapid legislative process on January 13, 2026, introducing a bill that would impose the death penalty on Palestinians in military courts in occupied Palestinian territories. The bill, titled 'Penal Code (Amendment \u2013 Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025,' mandates a mandatory death penalty for Palestinians accused of 'intentional murder' without requiring a prosecutor's request, and allows the sentence to be handed down by a simple majority. According to a joint report by Adalah, HaMoked, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), and Physicians for Human Rights \u2013 Israel (PHRI), the law would eliminate all basic judicial safeguards, prevent sentence mitigation, require executions within 90 days, and establish a secret, unmonitored death penalty system exclusively targeting Palestinians. The report states that the Israeli government's intent is not only to increase punishment severity but to institutionalize a discriminatory, opaque execution system for Palestinians. The lack of opposition from opposition parties, including center-right parties like Yesh Atid and HaMahaneh ha'Mamlachti, has made the bill's passage highly likely.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[Yeni \u015eafak](https://www.yenisafak.com/dunya/filistinlilere-ozel-infaz-yasasi-4790188)\n\n**Could Israel\u2019s Palestinians-only death penalty entrench impunity in the West Bank?**\nIsrael\u2019s Knesset has advanced a controversial bill, the Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159) (Death Penalty for Terrorists), which would mandate the death penalty exclusively for Palestinians convicted of terrorism, including those who committed offenses before the law\u2019s enactment. The amendment, proposed by the far-right Jewish Power party led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, passed its first reading with only 39 out of 120 Knesset members voting in favor, raising concerns about democratic legitimacy. The bill would allow military courts in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) to impose death sentences with a simple majority and prohibit commutation. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, B\u2019Tselem, and the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, have condemned the law as racist, a violation of international human rights law, and a tool to entrench impunity. They highlight the near-99% conviction rate in military courts, systemic denial of medical care in Israeli detention facilities\u2014where at least 94 Palestinians died between October 7, 2023, and August 2025\u2014and the lack of appeal or sentence reduction. The bill follows the summary execution of two surrendering Palestinian men in Jenin on November 27, 2025, which Ben-Gvir publicly endorsed and celebrated. Critics argue the law formalizes existing patterns of lethal force, deepens apartheid-like legal distinctions, and enables state-sanctioned executions while shielding Jewish perpetrators of violence. The bill remains under review by the National Security Committee and must pass two more readings to become law. Meanwhile, several European nations are boycotting the Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna over Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza, citing the country\u2019s non-compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits the death penalty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 14, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[arabnews.pk](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2625907/middle-east)\n\n**Foreign Media: Israeli Parliament Preliminarily Passes 'Death Penalty for Prisoners' Bill**\nAccording to 'Middle East Sky News' on November 11, 2025, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed a bill in a preliminary vote on Monday night, allowing the death penalty for individuals designated as 'terrorists.' The bill received 39 votes in favor and 16 opposed, targeting primarily Palestinians convicted of carrying out attacks that resulted in the deaths of Israeli citizens. The bill, a proposed amendment to the Penal Code, was introduced by an Israeli Member of Parliament and had previously been approved by the Knesset's National Security Committee. Under the legislative process, the proposal must still pass second and third readings before becoming law. The bill explicitly states that anyone who intentionally or negligently causes the death of an Israeli citizen with motives of race, hatred, or intent to harm Israel will be subject to the death penalty.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 11:13 PM\nSource:[mil.ifeng.com](https://mil.ifeng.com/c/8oBomZxhtpJ)\n\n**Israel Approves in First Reading Bill Proposing Death Penalty for 'Terrorists'**\nThe Israeli Parliament passed a bill in its first reading that proposes the death penalty for 'terrorists,' primarily targeting Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis. The bill, introduced by ultranationalist Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, received 39 votes in favor and 16 against. It requires two additional readings to become law. The proposal aims to create a strong deterrent by mandating the death penalty for those convicted of racially or hate-motivated murders intended to harm the State of Israel. It also lowers the threshold in military courts in the West Bank, allowing capital punishment by majority vote without military commutation. Ben-Gvir, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party and previously convicted in 2007 for incitement and support of a banned group, used the bill as leverage to maintain his party's presence in the governing coalition, threatening to withdraw if it wasn't voted on. The measure has drawn strong condemnation from Hamas, which labeled it a 'fascist and criminal face of Zionist occupation' and a 'flagrant violation of international law,' while the Palestinian Foreign Ministry described it as a 'new form of Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people.' The bill amends the Penal Code and comes amid a fragile ceasefire with Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attacks, which entered into effect in October 2025 and remains pending extension. Although the death penalty remains formally legal in Israel for limited crimes, the country has been de facto abolitionist since the execution of Adolf Eichmann in 1962. Similar proposals were previously considered in 2018 but did not pass.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 05:47 PM\nSource:[El Mundo CR](https://elmundo.cr/mundo/israel-aprueba-en-primera-votacion-un-proyecto-de-ley-que-propone-la-pena-de-muerte-para-terroristas/)\n\n**Israel's Parliament Approves First Reading of Death Penalty Bill for Terrorists**\nThe Israeli Knesset passed a bill in its first reading on November 11, 2025, proposing the death penalty for 'terrorists,' specifically targeting Palestinians convicted of lethal attacks against Israelis. The amendment to the Penal Code, demanded by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and approved by the National Security Committee, passed with 39 votes in favor and 16 against. It requires two additional readings before becoming law. Although the death penalty exists for a limited number of crimes in Israel, the country has effectively been abolitionist since the execution of Adolf Eichmann in 1962. Ben Gvir threatened to withdraw his party, Religious Zionism, from the governing coalition if the bill was not voted on. He stated that, if enacted, the law would be 'the most important in the history of the State of Israel' and would serve as a strong deterrent. The security committee's explanatory note stated the law aims to 'eliminate terrorism at its root' and create a 'strong deterrent.' The bill mandates the death penalty for those convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred against the public, especially when committed with the intent to harm the State of Israel. The vote occurred amid a fragile ceasefire with Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks. Israel continues negotiating with the U.S. and other nations on extending the measure. Hamas denounced the bill as an attempt to 'legally sanction systematic and mass murder' of Palestinians. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry in Ramallah called it a 'new form of escalation of Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people.' Palestinian human rights organizations, including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and the Independent Commission for Human Rights, warned that if passed, the law would impose the death penalty on anyone who kills an Israeli for nationalist reasons. Israeli authorities use the term 'terrorist' to describe Palestinians who attack soldiers, settlers in illegal West Bank outposts, or carry out attacks in Israeli territory. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), under Ben Gvir\u2019s tenure since December 2022, 95.5% of criminal investigations for incitement to terrorism have been against Palestinian citizens of Israel.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/11/11/la-ley-de-pena-de-muerte-para-terroristas-en-israel-supero-la-primera-votacion-en-el-parlamento/)\n\n**Israel bill proposing death penalty for 'terrorists' clears first parliamentary vote**\nIsrael's parliament approved a bill in its first reading on November 10, 2025, that would impose the death penalty for 'terrorists,' primarily targeting Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.
