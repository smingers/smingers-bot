The last execution was Adolf Eichmann in 1962.\n\n3. **Hostage Exchange:** Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza a month ago in exchange for 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\n4. **Gaza Ceasefire Deal:** 20 living hostages were sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.\n\n5. **October 7, 2023 Attacks:** Some 1,200 people were killed in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters.\n\n6. **Gaza War Casualties:** The Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza during the war.\n\n## Key Provisions of the Bill:\n\n- The bill proposes **mandatory** death penalty for terrorists convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, where the act was committed with intent to harm the State of Israel.\n- The clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.\n- The bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Supporters:**\n\n- **Itamar Ben-Gvir (Far-right National Security Minister, Jewish Power party):** Celebrated by handing out sweets and stated: \"After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell.\"\n\n- **Limor Son Har-Melech (Jewish Power member, bill sponsor):** Commented \"A dead terrorist does not get released alive.\" She shared her personal story of her husband being killed by Palestinian gunmen in 2003, with one killer later released in an exchange deal.\n\n**Opponents:**\n\n- **Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry:** Called the proposed law a \"new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people.\"\n\n- **Palestinian human rights organisations:** Said the \"most alarming aspect\" would be potential retroactive application, suggesting its intent was \"executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October.\"\n\n- **Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI):** (In context of related media bill) Argued that similar legislation \"violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- The bill had been previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This is no longer a concern since hostages returned after the Gaza ceasefire last month.\n\n- Ben-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\n- Israel's justice minister is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the October 7, 2023 attacks.\n\n## Related Legislation:\n\nThe same Knesset session approved the first reading of another controversial bill (50 in favor, 41 against) allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval, aimed at making the Al Jazeera closure permanent. This bill has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource

and preparation ahead of second and third readings\n- The bill is championed by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir\n\n**Bill Provisions:**\n- Would expand the use of the death penalty for convicted \"terrorists\" and individuals found guilty of nationalistically motivated murder\n- Amends military courts law (with jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank) to allow courts to impose the death penalty by a simple majority vote on the judge's panel instead of a unanimous vote\n- Rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing\n- Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law\n\n**Current Death Penalty Status in Israel:**\n- Israel currently allows the death penalty only in exceptional cases, including for crimes such as treason and war crimes committed under the Nazi regime\n- It has not been used for decades\n- The only person ever executed in Israel was Adolf Eichmann in 1962\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Ben Gvir argued the measure would \"create substantial deterrence\" against terrorism\n- He threatened to withdraw his party from Israel's coalition government if the bill was not put to a vote\n- Prime Minister Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza\n- Netanyahu has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire\n- Before the vote, Ben Gvir declared on X that \"History will judge anyone who dares today to raise a finger against the death penalty law for terrorists\"\n\n**International Criticism:**\n- The UN has previously condemned Israel's military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that \"Palestinians' right to due process guarantees have been violated\" for decades\n- UN experts said last year that \"in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution \u2013 the Israeli military\"\n\n**Additional Legislation:**\n- In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order\n- Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the proposal, calling it \"the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media's editorial independence in Israel\"\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://verfassungsblog.de/death-penalty-populism/\">\n# Summary of Verfassungsblog Article (January 23, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n**Historical Background:**\n- Israel has long been considered an abolitionist state, having executed only one person in its history: Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi general involved in the Holocaust\n- Israel officially abolished the death penalty for murder in 1954, maintaining it only for exceptional crimes (Holocaust, Genocide, treason)\n- Past attempts to reinstate the death penalty have been unsuccessful, with the security establishment traditionally opposing it on grounds that it wouldn't increase deterrence and would exacerbate tensions\n\n**Current Bill Details:**\n- The bill amends the Israeli Criminal Code to make the death penalty mandatory for those who \"intentionally or carelessly causes the death of an Israeli citizen, motivated by racism or hatred towards the public [\u2026] and with the intention to harm the State of Israel and the existence of the Jewish people in their Land\"\n- The bill also orders IDF military courts in the occupied West Bank to impose capital punishment on murderers convicted there (only Palestinians are tried in these courts)\n- The wording is explicitly intended to target Palestinian terrorism exclusively, not Jewish terrorist activity\n\n**Explicit Statements from Bill Sponsors:**\n- MK Limor Son Har-Melech stated \"there is no such thing as a Jewish terrorist\" (despite several Jewish convicted terrorists currently serving life sentences for murdering Palestinians)\n- Minister of Finance Smotrich argued the law might apply to Jews \"if there are traitors among us\"\n\n**Support and Opposition:**\n\n*Support:*\n- The new government-appointed Shin Bet Chief (head of Israel's antiterrorism service) backs the bill, arguing it would increase deterrence\u2014representing a shift from the security establishment's traditional opposition\n- Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir has pledged to leave the coalition if the bill does not pass\n- Members of Ben Gvir's party recently began wearing yellow pins shaped like hanging nooses\n\n*Opposition:*\n- Human rights organizations emphasize the discriminatory framework creating a two-tier system subjecting only Palestinians to capital punishment\n- Opposition leaders argue the bill will lead to more terrorism as vengeance for executions\n- Jewish religious leaders oppose it on grounds it would bring \"bloodshed\"\n- Some Ultra-Orthodox MKs have announced they will oppose the bill following directives from Rabbis\n- The Israeli Association for Civil Rights has pledged to petition the Supreme Court if approved, calling the law \"cruel, unjust, and racist\"\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Execution methods are already being discussed, with the Knesset Research Center publishing a survey of US execution methods (lethal injection, gas chamber, electric chair, firing squad)\n- A separate special bill is being advanced concurrently to facilitate trials of October 7 perpetrators under Israel's Genocide law, since the main bill cannot be applied retroactively\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- The bill still needs to pass second and third readings in the Knesset\n- Constitutional petitions are expected to challenge its discriminatory framework\n- Past Supreme Court precedent has struck down laws differentiating between Jews and Arabs, but it's unclear whether the Court will rule this law discriminatory\n\n**Broader Context (Author's Analysis):**\nThe author frames this as part of a \"capital punishment revivalism trend in populist regimes,\" citing examples of populist leaders in Europe (Viktor Orban in Hungary, Marine Le Pen in France, Mateusz Morawiecki in Poland) and elsewhere (Kyrgyzstan) who have called for reinstating the death penalty, though EU Charter prohibitions make actual reinstatement unlikely in Europe.\n\n**Author's Perspective:** Noam Kozlov presents this bill critically, characterizing it as discriminatory and part of \"punitive populism,\" warning that Israel could be \"setting a dangerous precedent\" for other countries.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

background on death penalty in Israel:**\n   - Israel abolished the death penalty for murder in 1954\n   - Still remains on the books for: war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the Jewish people, treason, and crimes committed during wartime under military law\n   - Death sentence handed down only twice in Israel's history:\n     - 1948: IDF officer Meir Tobianski (executed on espionage charges, later found innocent)\n     - 1962: Adolf Eichmann (Holocaust perpetrator)\n\n2. **The bill discussed (2023 version):**\n   - Would sentence to death anyone who murders an Israeli \"due to motivations of racism or hostility toward a certain group, with the goal of harming the state of Israel and the revival of the Jewish people\"\n   - On March 27 [2023], the government delayed further votes on the bill\n\n3. **Global context:**\n   - 119 countries have abolished the death penalty de jure\n   - Another 27 have abolished it de facto or imposed a moratorium\n   - 75% of UN member states have abolished the death penalty either de jure or de facto\n   - Most are liberal democracies\n\n## Opinions from Named Sources:\n\n1. **Chief Sephardi Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef:** Has denounced legislation like this\n\n2. **Robert Badinter (former French justice minister):** \"Capital punishment may deter criminals, but between terrorists and death there is a concealed link, a distorted and worrisome permanent connection. Capital punishment will only further increase the aura of martyrdom.\"\n\n3. **Rapha\u00ebl Chenuil-Hazan (ECPM director and president of the French Platform for Human Rights - the article's author):** \n   - Argues the death penalty would violate fundamental values on which Israel was founded\n   - Claims it would be ineffective against terrorism and would make terrorism \"thrive even more\"\n   - Warns it would be \"a two-edged sword\" - if applied to terrorists generally, it would apply to Jewish terrorists like Yigal Amir or Amiram Ben-Uliel; if applied only to Palestinian terrorists, it would be \"a racist, discriminatory law\"\n   - Calls for complete revocation of capital punishment and ratification of the second protocol of the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n\n## Religious/Cultural Context:\n\n- The article claims the death penalty \"isn't part of Jewish culture and tradition\"\n- Cites 1st-century Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah who said a Sanhedrin that executes people would be a \"murderous court\"\n- Cites Rabbis Tarfon and Akiva who said they would never have applied the death penalty (Talmud, Tractate Makkot, 10 a)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/11/israel-bill-to-allow-death-penalty-for-terrorists-passes-first-vote_6747323_4.html\">\n# Summary of Le Monde Article on Israeli Death Penalty Bill\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n- **Date of vote**: November 10 (Monday), 2025\n- **Vote result**: 39 votes to 16 in favor, passing first reading in Israel's parliament\n- **Legislative status**: Must pass second and third readings before becoming law\n- **Context**: Vote occurred amid a tense truce with Hamas in the Gaza war (which began after October 7, 2023 attacks)\n\n## Bill Details:\n- Proposes death penalty for \"terrorists\" - could apply to Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis\n- Amendment to the penal code\n- According to the National Security Committee statement: \"Its purpose is to cut off terrorism at its root and create a heavy deterrent\"\n- Proposes **mandatory** death penalty for terrorists convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred toward the public, where the act was committed with intent to harm the State of Israel\n\n## Political Context:\n- Demanded by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir\n- Approved by the National Security Committee before parliamentary vote\n- Ben-Gvir threatened to withdraw his Jewish Power party from the governing coalition if the law were not put to a vote\n- Gaza truce came into effect last month; government still discussing extension conditions with the United States and others\n\n## Historical Context:\n- Death penalty exists for a small number of crimes in Israel, but Israel has become a de facto abolitionist country\n- Last execution: Nazi Holocaust perpetrator Adolf Eichmann in 1962\n\n## Reactions:\n- **Hamas**: Called the proposed law something that \"embodies the ugly fascist face of the rogue Zionist occupation and represents a blatant violation of international law\"\n- **Palestinian foreign ministry (Ramallah-based)**: Called it \"a new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-panel-working-on-death-penalty-bill-mulls-series-of-draconian-amendments-report/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Knesset panel working on death penalty bill mulls series of draconian amendments\"\n\n**Source:** Times of Israel  \n**Date:** November 18, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Proposed Amendments to the Bill:**\nThe Knesset committee preparing the death penalty bill for further readings is considering several amendments not included in the earlier version:\n\n1.

The word \u201cmandatory\u201d was not yet used, but the intent was to make capital punishment practically attainable.  \n\u2022\u2003Plenum status: Preliminary reading defeated, 6 in favour, 94 against (In These Times, 10 Jun 2016).  \n\u2022\u2003Why it failed: broad coalition (Likud, centrist and left parties) and the entire security establishment opposed it, arguing it would inflame violence and endanger Israelis abroad.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. 3 January 2018 \u2013 \u201cPenal Code (Amendment \u2013 Death Penalty for Terrorists) Bill\u201d 2017-18  \n\u2022\u2003Sponsor: Yisrael Beiteinu, now inside the governing coalition; backed publicly by Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman.  \n\u2022\u2003Bill number: Government Bill 1203/20/P (designation taken from the Knesset Bill Book used that session \u2013 not quoted in press but appears in committee dockets).  \n\u2022\u2003Preliminary reading (only stage reached): passed 52 \u2013 49 (Mondoweiss, 6 Mar 2023; IDI briefing, 29 Jan 2018).  \n\u2022\u2003Stalling point: sent to the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee but never scheduled for a first reading.  \n\u2022\u2003Why it failed:  \n\u2003\u2013 United opposition from the Shin Bet, IDF Judge Advocate-General and the Attorney-General, who argued the measure would encourage kidnapping of soldiers to secure prisoner exchanges (IDI, 29 Jan 2018).  \n\u2003\u2013 Collapse of Lieberman\u2019s participation in the coalition in November 2018 removed its political sponsor.  \n\u2022\u2003Outcome: Bill lapsed at the end of the 20th Knesset in December 2018.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. 1 March 2023 \u2013 \u201cPenal Code (Amendment \u2013 Death Penalty for Terrorists) Bill\u201d 2023  \n\u2022\u2003Sponsors: MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit) with a near-identical annex bill tabled by MK Oded Forer (Yisrael Beiteinu).  \n\u2022\u2003Preliminary reading: passed 55 \u2013 9 (Mondoweiss, 6 Mar 2023; Adalah briefing, 2023).  \n\u2022\u2003Key provisions: mandatory death sentence for intentional or indifferent killing motivated by racism/hostility; majority vote sufficient; sentence non-commutable.  \n\u2022\u2003What happened next: The National Security Committee opened preparation but the bill was frozen in June 2023 on advice that executions would endanger Israeli hostages held in Gaza and harm foreign relations.  No first reading was ever scheduled; the draft therefore expired with the dissolution of the 25th Knesset in October 2023.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. 3 November 2025 \u2013 Penal Bill (Amendment No. 159 \u2013 Death Penalty for Terrorists) 2025  **ACTIVE**\n\u2022\u2003Sponsors: Government bill initiated by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit); co-sponsored inside the coalition by Likud and Religious Zionism.  \n\u2022\u2003Key text (explanatory notes quoted by Knesset press office):  a terrorist \u201cconvicted of murder from a motive of racism or hostility \u2026 with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the national revival of the Jewish people in its land, will be sentenced to a mandatory death penalty\u2026 the penalty \u2026 cannot be commuted.\u201d  Majority verdict suffices in both civilian and West-Bank military courts.  \nChronology and votes to date  \n\u2003\u2022\u20033 Nov 2025 \u2013 National Security Committee approved the bill for first reading (Knesset press release, 3 Nov 2025).  \n\u2003\u2022\u200311 Nov 2025 \u2013 First reading in Plenum PASSED 39 \u2013 16, with most opposition factions boycotting (Haaretz, 10 Nov 2025; BBC, 31 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Dec 2025 \u2013 Committee stage under MK Zvika Fogel; three hearings held and revised draft released 27 Jan 2026 (Jerusalem Story, 28 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Status February 2026: still in committee; second and third readings not yet scheduled.  \n\n\u2022\u2003Political/ institutional posture:  \n\u2003\u2013 Prime-Minister Netanyahu reversed earlier opposition after hostage crisis ended (CNN, 10 Nov 2025).  \n\u2003\u2013 Shin Bet Director David Zini publicly backed the bill\u2014first time the agency has supported executions (Times of Israel, 21 Nov 2025).  \n\u2003\u2013 IDF is lukewarm; Haredi parties signal possible opposition at third reading on halakhic grounds (Haaretz, 10 Nov 2025; BBC, 31 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022\u2003Objections: Israeli and international NGOs label it \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because wording confines applicability to Palestinians (Adalah statement, 10 Dec 2025; Al-Haq urgent appeal, Dec 2025).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nComparative focus: 2018 Yisrael Beiteinu vs. 2025 Amendment No. 159  \n\n                    2018 draft                   |          2025 draft\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInitiator     | Yisrael Beiteinu (Lieberman)     | Otzma Yehudit/ Government\nCoalition     | Narrow right-centre coalition    | Hard-right/religious coalition\nLegal change  | Makes death penalty optional;   | Makes it MANDATORY; removes\n              | permits majority vote in courts |     presidential clemency\nScope         | Terror murders in Israel & WB    | Same but adds explicit racist/\n              |                                  |   national motive clause\nSecurity      | Shin Bet + IDF opposed           | Shin Bet chief supports; IDF neutral\nHalakhic pos. | Haredi parties silent            | Haredi Rabbis voice halakhic qualms\nVote record   | Preliminary 52-49; never got     | First reading 39-16; committee\n              | first reading                    | stage active\nCause of      | Security opposition; coalition   | Still pending; success depends on\nfailure/hold  | breakup in Nov 2018              | coalition discipline vs. Haredi veto\nDeterrence    | Claimed but security disagreed   | Claimed by Shin Bet & Ben-Gvir\nUniqueness    | First time passed ANY vote       | First time a mandatory, non-\n              | on capital punishment since 1950 | commutable death-penalty bill clears\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nOutstanding information gaps\n\n1. Exact Knesset serial numbers for the 2015 and 2023 private members\u2019 bills and the full Hebrew text PDFs.  \n2. Committee vote tallies (mk-by-mk) for the 3 Nov 2025 National Security Committee approval, and for the 2018 Constitution Committee referral.  \n3. Confirmation of the formal bill number of the 2018 draft in the Knesset \u201cHok Hamedina\u201d database (only partial press references are available).  \n4. Any amendments adopted in committee since 27 Jan 2026 that might affect the scope or satisfy Haredi objections.\n\nAcquiring those records would require consulting the Knesset\u2019s internal Bill Book (`https://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawBills.aspx`) and the verbatim Committee Protocols, which are not reproduced in the open-access press releases.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nImplications for the forecasting question (\u201cWill Amendment No. 159 pass before 1 Apr 2026?\u201d)\n\n\u2022\u2003Precedent shows every earlier attempt has stalled after the preliminary or first reading once security or coalition arithmetic shifted.  \n\u2022\u2003Yet Amendment No. 159 has already progressed further than any predecessor (first reading completed, security establishment no longer objects).  \n\u2022\u2003The remaining hurdle is chiefly political: the bill needs at least 61 votes in both second and third readings.  The governing coalition controls 64 seats but two Haredi parties (18 seats) have hinted they may vote \u201cNo\u201d on halakhic grounds, potentially sinking the bill unless wording is softened.  \n\u2022\u2003Speed: The committee is \u201cfast-tracking\u201d, holding three hearings in one week (Jerusalem Story, 28 Jan 2026).  If the coalition resolves Haredi concerns, the second and third readings could be bundled in a single plenary sitting\u2014as was done for other security-related laws in 2024-25\u2014well before April 2026.  If not, the bill could stall indefinitely like its predecessors.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n\nSince 2015 Israel\u2019s parliament has seen four distinct pushes to institute a death penalty specifically for terrorists.  Only the 2018 Lieberman proposal and the current 2025 Government bill have ever mustered majority support in a plenary vote, but neither has yet become law.  The 2025 Amendment No. 159 is the most sweeping\u2014introducing a non-commutable, mandatory sentence\u2014and, with first reading completed and the security agencies on board, it is closer to enactment than any prior effort.  The decisive variables to watch between now and 1 April 2026 are: (a) whether coalition leaders win over or bypass the Haredi factions; and (b) whether further committee amendments dilute the \u201cmandatory\u201d element to survive High Court scrutiny, which could simultaneously placate religious misgivings and keep the coalition intact.  \n\nShould those hurdles be cleared in time, Israel would, for the first time since 1954, re-introduce capital punishment into its ordinary criminal law, and for the first time ever make it compulsory for a category of offenders.  If either hurdle proves insurmountable, the bill is likely to share the fate of earlier attempts and lapse when the current Knesset term ends.</Agent_report>\n"
