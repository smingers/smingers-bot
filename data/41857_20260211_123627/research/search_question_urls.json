The last execution was Adolf Eichmann in 1962.\n\n3. **Hostage Exchange:** Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza a month ago in exchange for 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\n4. **Gaza Ceasefire Deal:** 20 living hostages were sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.\n\n5. **October 7, 2023 Attacks:** Some 1,200 people were killed in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters.\n\n6. **Gaza War Casualties:** The Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza during the war.\n\n## Key Provisions of the Bill:\n\n- The bill proposes **mandatory** death penalty for terrorists convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, where the act was committed with intent to harm the State of Israel.\n- The clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.\n- The bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Supporters:**\n\n- **Itamar Ben-Gvir (Far-right National Security Minister, Jewish Power party):** Celebrated by handing out sweets and stated: \"After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell.\"\n\n- **Limor Son Har-Melech (Jewish Power member, bill sponsor):** Commented \"A dead terrorist does not get released alive.\" She shared her personal story of her husband being killed by Palestinian gunmen in 2003, with one killer later released in an exchange deal.\n\n**Opponents:**\n\n- **Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry:** Called the proposed law a \"new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people.\"\n\n- **Palestinian human rights organisations:** Said the \"most alarming aspect\" would be potential retroactive application, suggesting its intent was \"executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October.\"\n\n- **Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI):** (In context of related media bill) Argued that similar legislation \"violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- The bill had been previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This is no longer a concern since hostages returned after the Gaza ceasefire last month.\n\n- Ben-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\n- Israel's justice minister is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the October 7, 2023 attacks.\n\n## Related Legislation:\n\nThe same Knesset session approved the first reading of another controversial bill (50 in favor, 41 against) allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval, aimed at making the Al Jazeera closure permanent. This bill has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl\">\n# Summary of CNN Article (November 11, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Death Penalty Bill Vote:**\n- The death penalty bill passed its first reading in the Israeli parliament on Monday with 39 votes to 16\n- The bill now moves to a parliamentary committee for further debate and preparation ahead of second and third readings\n- The bill is championed by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir\n\n**Bill Provisions:**\n- Would expand the use of the death penalty for convicted \"terrorists\" and individuals found guilty of nationalistically motivated murder\n- Amends military courts law (with jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank) to allow courts to impose the death penalty by a simple majority vote on the judge's panel instead of a unanimous vote\n- Rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing\n- Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law\n\n**Current Death Penalty Status in Israel:**\n- Israel currently allows the death penalty only in exceptional cases, including for crimes such as treason and war crimes committed under the Nazi regime\n- It has not been used for decades\n- The only person ever executed in Israel was Adolf Eichmann in 1962\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Ben Gvir argued the measure would \"create substantial deterrence\" against terrorism\n- He threatened to withdraw his party from Israel's coalition government if the bill was not put to a vote\n- Prime Minister Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza\n- Netanyahu has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire\n- Before the vote, Ben Gvir declared on X that \"History will judge anyone who dares today to raise a finger against the death penalty law for terrorists\"\n\n**International Criticism:**\n- The UN has previously condemned Israel's military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that \"Palestinians' right to due process guarantees have been violated\" for decades\n- UN experts said last year that \"in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution \u2013 the Israeli military\"\n\n**Additional Legislation:**\n- In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order\n- Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the proposal, calling it \"the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media's editorial independence in Israel\"\n</QuestionSource>\n"
