Analysis:

**Source Analysis:**

*High-quality, identifiable sources:*
1. **NPR (Feb 11, 2026)** - Geoff Brumfiel reporting with named experts (Ankit Panda, Jeffrey Lewis). Factual reporting on U.S. claims about China's alleged June 22, 2020 test. Lewis reviewed seismic data and found no evidence. CTBTO also found no evidence. High credibility.

2. **The War Zone (Feb 6, 2026)** - Joseph Trevithick reporting on Thomas Di Nanno's Geneva speech alleging Chinese test. Notes State Dept's 2025 compliance report made no mention of testing. High credibility defense journalism.

3. **USA Today (Nov 11, 2025)** - Reports Russian officials' response to Trump's Oct 29 announcement about resuming testing. Trump did not specify what kind of tests. High credibility mainstream source.

4. **CBS News (Nov 2025)** - Reports China's denial of Trump's claims and quotes STRATCOM nominee saying neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests. High credibility.

5. **AskNews articles (Feb 2026)** - Multiple articles confirming: (a) U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified on Nov 3, 2025 that U.S. tests would be "non-critical explosions" without nuclear detonations, (b) CTBTO found no evidence of Chinese test on June 22, 2020, (c) Russia stated it would maintain limits if U.S. does, (d) New START expired Feb 5, 2026.

*Key factual findings:*
- Trump announced intention to resume "testing" on Oct 29, 2025, but did not specify explosive tests
- U.S. Energy Secretary Wright explicitly clarified (Nov 3, 2025) that planned tests are "non-critical explosions" - system tests without nuclear detonations
- U.S. alleges China conducted test June 22, 2020, but CTBTO and independent expert Jeffrey Lewis found no seismic evidence
- Russia says it will maintain limits if U.S. does; has not announced plans to test
- New START expired Feb 5, 2026
- No credible reports of actual preparations for explosive tests by any of the three nations

**Evidence Analysis:**

*Strong evidence against detonation:*
- **U.S. Energy Secretary's explicit clarification** (Nov 3, 2025, identifiable source): Wright stated tests would be "non-critical explosions" focusing on system components, not nuclear chain reactions. This is the most authoritative U.S. government statement on what "testing" means.
- **CTBTO monitoring system** (identifiable, authoritative): Detected no event consistent with nuclear explosion on alleged Chinese test date. This demonstrates the monitoring infrastructure remains robust.
- **Expert consensus** (Jeffrey Lewis, Ankit Panda - named experts): No evidence of recent testing; concerns about escalation but no indication of imminent tests.
- **Timeline constraints**: Multiple sources (Washington Post via Ukrainian outlet) note U.S. would need "at least 36 months of preparation" to resume underground testing at Nevada site.

*Moderate evidence against detonation:*
- **Russian conditional commitment**: Russia says it will maintain limits if U.S. does, suggesting no immediate plans
- **Institutional inertia**: 33-year moratorium, treaty infrastructure (though weakened), monitoring systems all create barriers

*Weak evidence for possible detonation:*
- **Rhetorical escalation**: Trump statements, U.S. allegations against China, treaty expiration
- **Site activity**: Some sources mention Chinese site activity at Lop Nur, but this is not new and doesn't indicate imminent testing

**Timeframe Analysis:**

Forecast window: 48 days (Feb 12 - Apr 1, 2026)

This is an extremely short timeframe. Key considerations:
- If timeframe were halved (24 days): Probability would decrease significantly, as even rushed preparations would be unlikely
- If timeframe were doubled (96 days): Probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for political decisions and preparations, but still constrained by technical requirements

The 48-day window is critical because:
1. Any test would need to be a political decision made NOW, with preparations already underway
2. No credible reports indicate such preparations are occurring
3. U.S. has explicitly clarified its "testing" means non-explosive system tests
4. The 36-month preparation timeline for U.S. underground testing suggests technical barriers remain

**Justification for Shifts from Outside View:**

Outside view base rate: 0.70% (based on zero detonations in 29 years post-moratorium)

*Factors supporting a slight increase:*
1. **Treaty erosion**: New START expired Feb 5, 2026 - removes one institutional barrier
2. **Rhetorical escalation**: Trump's Oct 2025 announcement and subsequent U.S. allegations against China represent unprecedented public discussion of resuming testing
3. **Geopolitical tensions**: Ukraine war, U.S.-China competition create more volatile environment than average post-1997 period

*Factors supporting a decrease or maintaining low probability:*
1. **Explicit U.S. clarification**: Energy Secretary Wright's Nov 3, 2025 statement that tests would be "non-critical" is the most authoritative recent statement and directly contradicts explosive testing
2. **No evidence of preparations**: Despite rhetoric, no credible reports of actual test site preparations by any nation
3. **Technical constraints**: 36-month timeline for U.S. preparations means explosive test is technically infeasible in 48-day window without prior secret preparations
4. **Monitoring infrastructure**: CTBTO system remains operational and would detect tests, creating reputational costs
5. **Expert assessment**: Named experts (Lewis, Panda) express concern about future escalation but provide no evidence of imminent testing

*Calibration:*
The rhetorical escalation and treaty expiration are real changes from the historical baseline, warranting some upward adjustment. However, the Energy Secretary's explicit clarification that U.S. "testing" means non-explosive system tests is a strong countervailing factor. The 48-day timeframe is too short for any nation to move from current posture to explosive test without prior secret preparations, which have not been credibly reported.

The outside view of 0.70% already incorporates some uncertainty. Given:
- Strong evidence (Energy Secretary statement) that U.S. plans non-explosive tests
- No credible evidence of preparations by Russia or China
- Technical constraints on rapid testing
- Short 48-day window

I assess the probability should remain very close to the outside view base rate, with only a modest increase to account for heightened rhetoric and treaty expiration.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view: 0.70%

Adjustments:
- Treaty expiration and rhetoric: +0.5% (moderate increase for changed environment)
- Energy Secretary clarification: -0.3% (strong evidence U.S. plans non-explosive tests)
- No evidence of preparations: -0.1% (reinforces low probability)
- Technical constraints in 48-day window: -0.1% (makes rushed test nearly impossible)

Net adjustment: +0.0%

However, given the unprecedented nature of current rhetoric and the fact that secret preparations could theoretically be underway, I'll apply a small upward adjustment to avoid overconfidence in the status quo.

Final inside view: 1.2%

This represents roughly a 70% increase from the outside view base rate, justified by:
1. Unprecedented public discussion of resuming testing
2. Treaty expiration removing one barrier
3. Heightened geopolitical tensions
4. Acknowledgment of uncertainty about secret activities

But remains very low because:
1. Energy Secretary explicitly stated non-explosive tests
2. No credible evidence of preparations
3. Technical barriers to rapid testing
4. 48-day window is extremely short

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will U.S., Russia, or China detonate a nuclear device between Feb 12 and Apr 1, 2026 (48 days)? Requires public reporting of actual detonation.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 0.70% based on zero detonations in 29 years (10,600 days) post-moratorium, using Laplace adjustment.

3. **Consistency check**: "1.2 out of 100 times, one of these three nations publicly detonates a nuclear device in a 48-day window during current geopolitical conditions." This seems reasonable given unprecedented rhetoric but strong technical/institutional barriers.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - U.S. Energy Secretary Wright (Nov 3, 2025): Tests will be "non-critical explosions" without nuclear detonations
   - CTBTO and expert Jeffrey Lewis: No seismic evidence of alleged Chinese test; monitoring infrastructure intact
   - No credible reports of test site preparations by any nation despite rhetoric
   - Technical requirement of 36 months for U.S. test preparations
   - New START expired Feb 5, 2026, removing institutional barrier

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Secret preparations are already underway at one nation's test site, with political decision made to conduct a surprise test as demonstration. This would make my forecast look silly. However, even in this scenario, the 48-day window is extremely constraining. If this scenario were true, I might increase to 3-5%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is no testing. Given 33-year moratorium, strong institutional inertia, explicit U.S. statement about non-explosive tests, and 48-day timeframe, status quo is highly likely to continue. The volatility is primarily rhetorical rather than operational. A slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate.
