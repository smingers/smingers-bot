Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**USA Today (Nov 11, 2025)**: Reputable mainstream news source. Reports Russian officials' conditional threat to test if U.S. does, following Trump's Oct 29 announcement. Key fact: Energy Secretary Wright clarified U.S. testing would NOT involve nuclear explosions. High quality, factual reporting with named officials.

**CBS News (Nov 3, 2025)**: Major news outlet. Reports China's denial of Trump's testing claims. Critical fact: Trump's own STRATCOM nominee testified neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests. High quality, contradicts Trump's assertions with expert testimony.

**Arms Control Association (Feb 12, 2026)**: Specialized arms control think tank, highly credible in this domain. Reports New START expiration and diplomatic efforts. No mention of actual testing plans. Current date source, focused on treaty diplomacy rather than testing activities.

**Armyrecognition (Jan 12, 2026)**: Defense industry publication. Reports Russian plans to test ballistic MISSILES in 2026, NOT nuclear warhead detonations. Important distinction: missile tests ≠ nuclear explosive tests. Medium quality, technical focus.

**CFR (Feb 9, 2026)**: Council on Foreign Relations, highly credible foreign policy think tank. Discusses New START expiration and verification challenges. Multiple expert opinions note the treaty limits were outdated. No mention of imminent testing. High quality analytical piece.

**ABC News (date unclear, likely late Oct 2025)**: Major news outlet. Reports confusion over Trump's testing statement. VP Vance and Vice Adm. Correll provide contradictory interpretations. Correll's key statement: "Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test" - implies U.S. wouldn't either to maintain "equal basis." High quality.

**CNN (Oct 31, 2025)**: Major news outlet. Expert Matthew Bunn (Harvard) states "every statement in that post is wrong" regarding Trump's claims. Vice Adm. Correll again confirms no other nations are testing. Multiple experts note testing makes no strategic sense for U.S. High quality with named experts.

**NPR (Oct 30, 2025)**: Public radio, high credibility. Reports testing would take 18 months minimum for basic demonstration, years for useful data. Expert consensus: not necessary and would benefit adversaries more than U.S. High quality technical analysis.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive chronology 2023-Feb 2026. Key findings:
- Russia: CTBT withdrawal (Nov 2023), Novaya Zemlya site preparations confirmed by satellite imagery and site commander statements (Sep 2024), Defense Minister recommended "immediate preparations" (Nov 2025)
- U.S.: Trump announcement (Oct 29, 2025) but no concrete implementation plan, 18+ month timeline if pursued
- China: U.S. allegations of 2020 test (Feb 6, 2026) but no corroborating evidence, China denies
- Critical conclusion: "no detonations have yet occurred" as of Feb 12, 2026

**Key factual consensus across sources**:
1. No nuclear explosive tests have occurred by any of the three nations since the 1990s (except North Korea)
2. Trump's Oct 29 announcement was immediately walked back by his own officials (Wright, Correll)
3. Russia has prepared infrastructure but made testing conditional on U.S. action first
4. China denies all testing allegations; U.S. allegations lack independent verification
5. Any U.S. test would require 18+ months minimum preparation time

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Nuclear test moratorium compliance (1996-2026)**
- Relevant period: 30 years
- Only North Korea has broken the moratorium (9 tests, 2006-2017)
- Major powers (U.S., Russia, China, UK, France) have maintained compliance despite:
  - Multiple geopolitical crises (Kosovo, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine)
  - Changes in leadership and political rhetoric
  - Treaty withdrawals and diplomatic tensions
- Suitability: HIGH - directly relevant to the question

**Reference Class 2: Trump administration nuclear policy announcements vs. implementation**
- Pattern: Bold announcements often not implemented or walked back
- Examples from sources: Energy Secretary Wright immediately clarified "not nuclear explosions"
- STRATCOM nominee Correll contradicted Trump's claims about others testing
- Suitability: MEDIUM - relevant to U.S. specifically but not Russia/China

**Reference Class 3: Russian conditional threats during Ukraine conflict**
- Multiple Russian "red lines" and threats not executed
- However, this is different - Russia has actually prepared infrastructure
- Suitability: MEDIUM - relevant but testing is more constrained by international norms

**Most suitable reference class**: Nuclear test moratorium compliance (1996-2026). This 30-year period of restraint by major powers, despite numerous provocations and political changes, provides the strongest baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 47 days (Feb 12, 2026 to April 1, 2026)

**Historical patterns**:
- In 30 years of moratorium (1996-2026): 0 tests by U.S./Russia/China
- Base rate: 0% per year for major powers
- Even in periods of high tension (Ukraine war 2022-2026), no tests occurred

**Timeline constraints for this specific period**:
- U.S.: Minimum 18 months needed from Trump's Oct 29 announcement = earliest mid-2027
- Russia: Infrastructure ready but explicitly conditional on U.S. testing first
- China: No credible evidence of preparations; denies all allegations

**Critical temporal factor**: Only 47 days remain. Even with political will, physical preparation time makes testing nearly impossible in this window.

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests an extremely low probability of nuclear testing before April 1, 2026:

1. **Powerful historical norm**: 30-year moratorium maintained by all major powers despite wars, crises, and political transitions. Only North Korea (a unique case) has broken it.

2. **Physical constraints dominate**: Even if political decisions were made today, the 18+ month preparation timeline for the U.S. makes testing impossible in 47 days. Russia's infrastructure is ready but politically conditioned on U.S. action first, creating a sequential dependency that cannot resolve in this timeframe.

3. **Official statements contradict testing**: Every technical expert and military official (Wright, Correll, Bunn, Hinderstein) has either denied testing plans or stated it makes no strategic sense. Trump's announcement was immediately walked back by his own administration.

4. **No verified preparations by China**: U.S. allegations lack independent corroboration (no seismic data, no satellite confirmation). China's consistent denials and lack of observable preparations suggest no imminent test.

5. **Strategic irrationality**: Multiple experts note testing would benefit adversaries more than the U.S., undermining the stated rationale.

6. **Recent precedent**: Despite Russia's CTBT withdrawal (2023), Novaya Zemlya preparations (2024), and Defense Minister recommendations (Nov 2025), no test occurred. This suggests political constraints remain binding even when technical capability exists.

The only scenario that could produce a "Yes" outcome would be an unprecedented, impulsive political decision combined with either (a) secret preparations not detected by any intelligence service or satellite imagery, or (b) a test using pre-positioned materials requiring minimal preparation. Both scenarios are highly implausible given the transparency of modern surveillance and the bureaucratic/technical requirements for nuclear testing.

Outside view calibration:

**Rough figures from sources**: 
- Base rate from 30-year moratorium: 0/30 years = 0% per year for major powers
- North Korea broke moratorium: 1/8 nuclear powers = 12.5% of nuclear states, but over 21 years (2006-2026), not 47 days

**Probability calibration considerations**:

1. **Base rate adjustment**: The 30-year clean record suggests <1% annual probability. For a 47-day window: (47/365) × 1% = 0.13% if we assume uniform distribution, but testing is not uniformly distributed across time.

2. **Current elevated rhetoric**: Trump's announcement and Russian preparations represent the highest testing risk since 1996. This might increase the base rate by 5-10x, but from a very low baseline: 0.13% × 10 = 1.3%

3. **Physical impossibility for U.S.**: The 18-month timeline creates a hard ceiling. U.S. probability in this window: ~0%

4. **Russian conditional probability**: P(Russia tests | U.S. tests first) might be 30-50%, but P(U.S. tests) ≈ 0%, so P(Russia tests) ≈ 0%

5. **China probability**: No credible evidence of preparations, consistent denials. Probability: <0.5%

6. **Unexpected outcomes**: In nuclear policy, unexpected outcomes are rare because of bureaucratic inertia and technical constraints. However, the domain has seen surprises (North Korea tests, Russia's CTBT withdrawal). Historical upset rate: ~5% for major policy shifts, but actual testing is more constrained.

7. **Overconfidence check**: Could I be missing something? Possible scenarios:
   - Secret preparations by China (low probability given satellite surveillance)
   - Impulsive Russian decision despite conditional stance (very low given 2+ years of restraint)
   - Misinterpretation of "testing" to include subcritical tests (but question specifies "detonate")

8. **Calibration against similar predictions**: For events with strong physical constraints and long historical precedent, probabilities below 2% are appropriate when timeframes are short.

**Final calibration**: The combination of:
- 30-year precedent of restraint (very strong)
- Physical impossibility for U.S. in timeframe (decisive)
- Russian testing conditional on U.S. action (creates dependency)
- No credible China preparations (strong)
- Only 47 days remaining (critical constraint)

...suggests a probability in the 0.5-2% range. The main risk is an unexpected Chinese test based on secret preparations, but this is highly unlikely given modern surveillance capabilities and China's consistent behavior pattern.

I calibrate toward the lower end of this range given the physical constraints dominate political considerations in this short timeframe.
