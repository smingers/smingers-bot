Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria paraphrase (what must happen):**  
This resolves **Yes** if **after Nov 12, 2025 and before Apr 1, 2026**, the **U.S., Russia, or China** are **publicly reported** to have **detonated a nuclear device** anywhere (i.e., a nuclear explosive yield, not a subcritical/non-nuclear test).

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
- **NPR (Feb 11, 2026)** – High-quality reporting with identifiable officials and named experts (Ankit Panda, Jeffrey Lewis) plus CTBTO position. Key factual content: DiNanno alleges a Chinese 2020 yield-producing test and prep for “hundreds of tons” yields; experts/CTBTO say no seismic evidence for 2020 claim. Strong on technical context; does **not** provide evidence of an impending 2026 test.
- **The War Zone (Feb 6, 2026)** – Generally solid defense reporting, but more interpretive and reliant on government statements. Adds detail on DiNanno’s allegations and “decoupling” claims; notes lack of corroboration in recent compliance/Pentagon reports. Useful but secondary to NPR/CTBTO and primary docs.
- **AFP / IOL (Feb 11, 2026)** – Wire-service-level reliability. Factual: Russia says it will stick to New START numerical limits if U.S. does; signals some restraint. Doesn’t address testing directly, but speaks to escalation posture.
- **Anadolu Ajansı (Feb 11, 2026)** – Medium-high reliability; good for “who said what.” Factual: China denies allegations; CTBTO says no detection for June 22, 2020. Mainly reinforces NPR’s core facts.
- **China Daily (Feb 11-12, 2026)** – State-affiliated; reliable for China’s *official position* (denials, accusations), not for neutral adjudication. Adds: China urges renewed moratorium; claims U.S. is fabricating excuses.
- **Lapresse (Feb 10, 2026) summarizing NYT / Politico** – Secondary relay. If accurately reflecting NYT, it indicates Trump is “considering” underground tests post–New START. But it’s still *consideration*, not execution; and it’s secondhand here.
- **CNA (Taiwan) (Feb 10, 2026)** – Generally reliable; summarizes U.S. posture post–New START and DiNanno remarks. Still mostly rhetoric/options rather than operational readiness for a detonation inside 48 days.
- **Firstpost explainer/opinion pieces (Feb 5 & Feb 10, 2026)** – Mixed: explainers can be decent, but opinion framing and selection effects are common. Useful for assembling arguments; weaker for verifying imminent actions.
- **Backroad Planet travel piece (Feb 11, 2026)** – Not relevant to detonations.
- **Utah Legislature SCR003 page** – Content missing; cannot weigh substantively.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (pushes probability down):**
1. **Physical/institutional lead times for U.S. explosive testing**: credible reporting (from your outside-view set) indicates **~18+ months to 36 months** for a U.S. return to underground nuclear explosive testing. With only ~48 days left, this is a hard structural constraint.  
2. **Resolution requires “publicly reported”**: clandestine ultra-low-yield activity (if it occurred) may *not* resolve Yes unless publicly reported as a nuclear detonation. This slightly reduces event probability relative to “any detonation.”

**Moderate evidence (small up/down adjustments):**
3. **New START has now expired (Feb 5, 2026)** and rhetoric is sharpening: removal of the last bilateral cap/verification regime increases medium-term risk-taking and signaling behavior. However, treaty expiry is not a direct causal trigger for an explosive test inside 48 days.
4. **U.S. official (DiNanno) publicly alleges Chinese yield-producing tests and prep for more**: indicates some appetite in parts of U.S. government to justify a policy shift. But the specific cited event is **2020**, disputed by CTBTO and experts, and does not imply a near-term (Feb–Mar 2026) detonation.

**Weak evidence (tiny adjustments):**
5. **Media/analyst speculation** about arms race dynamics; domestic political signaling; non-specific claims of “planning tests.” These move attention, not necessarily capability or imminent decisions.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window remaining:** ~**48 days** (Feb 12, 2026 → Apr 1, 2026).  
- **If halved (~24 days):** probability would fall materially (less time for a surprise decision + execution), perhaps by ~30–50% from my final number.  
- **If doubled (~96 days):** probability would rise, but not linearly; you’d start to capture more plausible political decision cycles and operational preparations (especially for Russia/China if already prepared), so I’d expect ~2–3× my final number over ~3 months vs ~1.5 months—still low, but less tiny.

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
**Outside view base rate given:** **1.2%**.

What’s changed or clarified in the *current* info since that baseline?
- **Escalatory rhetoric and institutional drift is real**: New START expiry + DiNanno allegations + renewed talk of “parallel steps” are consistent with increased medium-term risk. This nudges probabilities **up** modestly versus a generic “30-year moratorium” baseline.
- **But the key limiting factor remains time-to-execute and incentives**: There is still no concrete, corroborated indicator that any of the three will (a) decide, (b) prepare, and (c) conduct a **yield-producing nuclear detonation** that becomes **publicly reported** inside 48 days. For the **U.S.**, the structural timeline strongly blocks it. For **Russia/China**, capability exists, but the costs (diplomatic fallout, arms-race acceleration) and lack of clear precipitating benefit inside this short window keep probability very low.
- **The “publicly reported” clause matters**: to the extent China/Russia might attempt ambiguous very-low-yield experiments, those could fail to resolve Yes unless clearly reported as a nuclear detonation. That pushes the forecast slightly **down** versus “any detonation.”

Net: small upward pressure from post–New START escalation narratives, but mostly offset by the short horizon and hard constraints—so only a **modest** move from 1.2%.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: **1.2%**
- **+0.5 pp**: New START expiration + heightened official rhetoric increases near-term tail risk somewhat.
- **-0.2 pp**: “Publicly reported” requirement + lack of corroborated preparations; much of the “testing” talk is ambiguous/non-explosive or disputed.
- **Inside-view final:** **1.5%**

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Yes if a **public report** confirms **U.S./Russia/China nuclear detonation** occurring **Nov 12, 2025–Apr 1, 2026**.  
2. **Outside view base rate:** **1.2%**.  
3. **Consistency check:** “In **1.5 out of 100** similar worlds, a publicly reported U.S./Russia/China nuclear detonation occurs before Apr 1, 2026.”  
4. **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - U.S. return-to-testing lead time reportedly **18–36 months** (hard constraint).
   - Only **48 days** remain; no concrete, corroborated operational indicators of imminent detonations.
   - New START expired, increasing arms-race rhetoric (modest upward pressure).
   - DiNanno alleges Chinese past testing; **CTBTO/expert analysis disputes** seismic evidence (weak for imminent test).
   - Resolution requires **public reporting**, limiting effect of hypothetical clandestine micro-yield activity.
5. **Blind spot:** Russia or China conducts a surprise low-to-moderate yield underground test from pre-existing readiness, and it is rapidly confirmed/reported despite attempted concealment. This would push probability meaningfully higher (e.g., into ~3–5%).  
6. **Status quo outcome:** Continued moratorium/no publicly reported detonations remains the overwhelming default in this short window.

Probability: 1.5%
