Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality/date)
- **USA Today (Nov 11, 2025)**: Reports senior Russian officials saying Russia would test if the U.S. resumes testing; also reports U.S. Energy Secretary Wright claiming U.S. “tests” would *not* involve nuclear explosions.  
  - **Quality**: Mainstream outlet; plausibly accurate on quoted official statements.  
  - **Key factual value**: Conditional Russian signaling + U.S. official downplaying of explosive tests.  
  - **Limits**: No concrete steps/timelines for explosive detonations.

- **CBS News (Nov 3, 2025)**: China denies Trump’s claim of Chinese clandestine explosive tests; notes STRATCOM nominee testimony that neither Russia nor China has conducted nuclear explosive tests.  
  - **Quality**: High for capturing official denials and testimony.  
  - **Key factual value**: Establishes public U.S. military leadership-position (as of late 2025) that there were no known Russian/Chinese explosive tests.

- **Arms Control Association issue brief (Feb 12, 2026)**: Focuses on New START’s expiration and arms-control advocacy; no mention of imminent nuclear explosive testing.  
  - **Quality**: High on arms-control context; generally careful.  
  - **Key value**: Confirms the strategic backdrop (post–New START), but **does not** add evidence of imminent detonation.

- **ArmyRecognition (Jan 12, 2026)**: Discusses Russian *missile* testing plans (delivery systems), not explosive nuclear device tests.  
  - **Quality**: Mixed; defense-news site.  
  - **Key value**: Low direct relevance because missile flight tests ≠ nuclear detonations (per resolution criteria).

- **CFR (Feb 9, 2026)**: Discusses implications of New START expiration; no mention of nuclear explosive test plans.  
  - **Quality**: High; expert commentary.  
  - **Key value**: Indicates arms-race incentives may rise, but not evidence of near-term detonation.

- **ABC News explainer (date not shown in excerpt; context late 2025)**: Notes ambiguity in Trump’s “testing” language; includes expert view (Kelsey Davenport) that resuming explosive testing would be dangerous and could cascade.  
  - **Quality**: High for reported statements; expert opinion is clearly labeled.  
  - **Key factual value**: Confirms continued ambiguity and that experts see strong norms/costs against testing.

- **CNN (Oct 31, 2025)** and **NPR (Oct 30, 2025)**: Both emphasize confusion/ambiguity, the strong post-1990s moratorium norm, and practical timelines. NPR cites an estimate that a *basic* U.S. demonstration test could take ~**18 months**; more useful tests take longer.  
  - **Quality**: High.  
  - **Key value**: The **timeline constraint** is crucial for an outside-view assessment over a ~7-week window.

- **Agent report (compiled; includes items through Feb 12, 2026)**: Lists open-source claims about preparations and signaling: Russia CTBT de-ratification (Nov 2023), site readiness statements at Novaya Zemlya, U.S. rhetoric, and (notably) an alleged Feb 6, 2026 U.S. accusation that China conducted a yield-producing test in 2020 and is preparing more.  
  - **Quality**: Mixed because it’s a secondary compilation and includes some niche outlets; useful as a *lead list*, but each claim would normally be verified in primary sources.  
  - **Key value**: Highlights that **Russia appears most “site-ready”** per repeated statements/imagery claims; highlights that U.S. accusations about China are (so far) not corroborated by publicly cited seismic evidence.

**Bottom line from sources for an outside view:** lots of rhetoric and some readiness signaling, but no hard public evidence of an imminent explosive test by any of the three—plus strong indications (especially for the U.S.) that explosive testing is not operationally “quick.”

### (b) Reference class analysis (choose suitable baseline)
Candidate reference classes:
1. **“US/Russia/China nuclear explosive tests in the modern moratorium era (post-1996)”**  
   - Suitability: Very high; directly matches actors and behavior under the established testing taboo.  
   - Data point: effectively **0** acknowledged explosive tests by these three since 1996.

2. **“Any country nuclear explosive tests post-1996”** (mostly North Korea)  
   - Suitability: Medium; broader set includes a clear outlier (North Korea) with very different incentives and constraints.

3. **“Periods shortly after major arms-control breakdown / heightened rhetoric”**  
   - Suitability: Medium; relevant qualitatively, but small-N and hard to quantify.

**Most suitable for an outside-view base rate:** (1) the post-1996 moratorium behavior of **the US/Russia/China specifically**, because the norm and capabilities are similar and the question is restricted to those actors.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** from **today (Feb 12, 2026)** to **Apr 1, 2026** = ~**48 days** (~1.6 months).
- Over similarly short windows in the post-1996 era, the historical pattern for these three states is **no tests at all**.
- Practical constraint: even if politics shift quickly, **physical/logistical/test-program steps** tend not to. NPR’s cited estimate (~18 months for a basic U.S. test) strongly implies that, absent a preexisting near-complete test setup, the U.S. is unlikely to conduct an explosive detonation in the next ~7 weeks. Russia may be faster if its site readiness claims are accurate; China’s likelihood is hardest to infer from public evidence.

---

### (d) Justification (outside-view synthesis)
**Outside view baseline:** In ~30 years, the US/Russia/China have collectively maintained a de facto moratorium; in that long period, the observed frequency of tests by these actors is effectively **zero**. For a short 48-day window, the base-rate probability is therefore **well under 1%**.

**Adjustment for current context (still outside-view, not “inside baseball”):**
- **Yes-drivers (generic):** treaty regime erosion (New START expired), public rhetorical escalation, potential desire to signal resolve, Russia’s claimed readiness at Novaya Zemlya.
- **No-drivers (generic and powerful):** massive diplomatic costs, risk of reciprocal testing cascade, domestic/international backlash, and (for the U.S. especially) timeline/technical readiness constraints suggested by credible reporting. Also, the strongest public statements in the sources include U.S. officials indicating “testing” may mean non-explosive system/subcritical activities.

Given these, the appropriate outside-view move is: **increase** from a sub-1% baseline, but keep it low because the window is short and the moratorium norm has been extremely sticky.

Outside view calibration:

- A useful tether from the reference class: treat the last ~28–30 years as ~200+ independent ~50-day “periods” with **0 events** for these actors. A rule-of-succession style estimate yields roughly **~0.5%** per ~50-day period as a crude, uncertainty-aware baseline (rather than literal 0%).
- Current tensions/rhetoric plausibly multiply risk by a few times (say **3–6×**) relative to a calm period, but the short timeline and lack of concrete mobilization signals prevent a large jump.
- Domain “upsets”: rare, but not impossible; if leadership decides a dramatic signal is worth the cost, it can happen. This argues against going too close to 0%.

Net calibrated outside-view probability: low single digits.

Outside View Prediction:
**2.1%**
