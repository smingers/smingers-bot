Analysis:

1. Paraphrased question & criteria (≤30 words)
Between 12 Nov 2025 and 1 Apr 2026, will the U.S., Russia or China publicly detonate a nuclear device?  (Any purpose, any location.)

2. Source analysis (quality, fact vs. opinion, date)
• NPR (11 Feb 2026).  Fact: U.S. official again accuses China of secret 2020 test.  CTBTO and independent seismologists see no evidence.  High-quality; expert opinions clearly separated.  
• War Zone (6 Feb 2026).  Same allegation; adds site-readiness claims at Lop Nur.  Mid-quality defence blog; mostly re-reports Di Nanno speech.  
• Global Times/China Daily (12 Feb 2026).  Chinese MFA denial; propaganda tone, but quotes attributable officials.  
• AFP / IOL / Kronen Zeitung (11 Feb 2026).  Russia pledges to stay within New START limits if U.S. does.  Straight newswires; reliable for what was said.  
• Augsburger Allgemeine (11 Feb 2026).  Reports unnamed senior U.S. official that Washington “is considering” tests.  Moderate quality; single anonymous source.  
• NY Times / La Presse (10 Feb 2026).  Says resuming U.S. tests “under consideration”; cites expert estimate ≥18 months lead-time.  High quality; clearly distinguishes fact from analysis.  
• November-2025 cluster (USA Today, News 18, Dainik Jagran, El Universal).  All quote Energy Sec. Wright that announced “tests” are non-nuclear; factually solid, though earlier in timeline.  

3. Evidence analysis (using weighting rubric)
Strong evidence  
• Thirty-year moratorium: zero acknowledged tests by these three powers since 1996 (structural norm, many independent confirmations).  
Moderate evidence  
• Multiple officials (U.S. Di Nanno) allege Chinese violations, but no corroborating seismic data (single identifiable source, contested).  
• Russian readiness statements at Novaya Zemlya and promise of reciprocity only if U.S. moves first (logical, but conditional).  
• U.S. political rhetoric about “equal footing” testing, yet Energy Dept. & experts note 12-18 months prep (single source, clear methodology).  
Weak evidence  
• Anonymous press leaks claiming Washington “plans” tests within months (speculative, no technical detail).  
• Commentator fears of arms-race escalation (op-ed level).  

Overall weighting: strong “No-test” norm outweighs moderate rhetorical escalations.

4. Timeframe analysis
Days until resolution: 48 days (~1.6 months).  
Halved (24 days): probability falls slightly; physical preparations even less plausible.  
Doubled (96 days): modest rise; Russia could possibly execute an underground shot if it has everything in place, but still low.

5. Justification / inside-view update
Outside-view base rate (post-1996, 50-day window) ≈0.5 %.  
Adjust upward for:  
• Treaty vacuum & louder test rhetoric (+0.8 %).  
• Russian site readiness/reciprocity signals (+0.5 %).  
• Small chance of a Chinese low-yield test becoming public (+0.3 %).  
Subtract for:  
• Technical lead-time realities, especially in U.S. (-0.2 %).  
Net inside-view ≈2 %.

Consistency check: “Roughly 2 of 100 similar 48-day periods would see a publicly reported detonation by one of the three.”  Feels consistent with history and present signals.

Key evidence (≤20 words each)
1. 30-year unbroken moratorium by U.S./Russia/China.  
2. Expert consensus: ≥12 months needed to ready a U.S. explosive test.  
3. Russia: will test only if U.S. breaks moratorium, per Lavrov 11 Feb 2026.  
4. CTBTO & seismologists find no sign of Chinese testing; allegations uncorroborated.  
5. New START’s expiry removes legal barrier, marginally raising incentives.

Blind-spot scenario
A sudden Russian political decision to fire a small device at Novaya Zemlya “without notice” to shock Washington.  Would push probability to ~20 %.

Status-quo outcome
No test; inertia, cost, and diplomatic blow-back keep moratorium intact for next seven weeks.

Probability calibration
I therefore assign a 2 % chance that at least one of the three states detonates a nuclear device between now and 1 Apr 2026.  Small ±10 % relative shifts (1.8 %–2.2 %) would not materially change my conclusions; >5 % would require hard evidence of on-site preparations (e.g., satellite images of test shaft instrumentation).
