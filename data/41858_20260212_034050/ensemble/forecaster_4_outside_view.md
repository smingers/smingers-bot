Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. USA Today (11 Nov 2025) – Straight reporting, quotes identifiable Russian and U.S. officials.  Factual credibility: high.  
2. CBS News (3 Nov 2025) – Straight reporting, quotes China’s Foreign-Ministry spokeswoman and U.S. STRATCOM nominee.  Credibility: high.  
3. Arms-Control Association brief (12 Feb 2026) – Think-tank overview; largely factual and historically sourced.  Credibility: high.  
4. Armyrecognition (12 Jan 2026) – Trade/defence outlet, focuses on missile—not warhead—tests.  Credibility: medium.  
5. Council on Foreign Relations (9 Feb 2026) – Reputable think-tank; policy analysis, not event reporting.  Credibility: high.  
6. ABC, CNN, NPR pieces (Oct–Nov 2025) – U.S. mainstream media summarising Trump statements; fact-checked quotations from named experts.  Credibility: high.  
7. Agent report (compiled 12 Feb 2026) – Aggregated open-source chronology with citations.  A useful consolidated factual list, but secondary; some entries (e.g., ArcticToday, War Zone) are niche publications.  Treat with moderate confidence; cross-checked items match known public statements.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
i. Entire nuclear age (1945–2025) – 1 792 tests by the three states.  Not ideal because almost all occurred before 1990s moratorium; present institutional constraints very different.  
ii. Post-moratorium era (1 Jan 1997–11 Feb 2026) – 29.1 years in which the United States, Russia and China have conducted zero explosive nuclear tests.  Closely matches today’s legal/normative setting; chosen reference class.  
iii. “Crisis” periods when arms-control treaties lapsed (e.g., 2002 ABM withdrawal, 2019 INF collapse) – would yield sample size too small and still zero detonations.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Forecast window remaining: 48 days (12 Feb 2026 → 01 Apr 2026).  
• In the chosen reference class there are roughly 10 600 individual days or about 220 non-overlapping 48-day blocks; observed detonations by these states = 0.  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
1. Empirical base-rate: Using Laplace’s rule of succession for 48-day blocks: (k+1)/(n+2) = (0+1)/(220+2) ≈ 0.00455 → 0.455 %.  
2. Zero events since the de-facto global moratorium suggests extremely strong institutional, political and technical inertia against testing.  
3. Although rhetoric, site upgrades and treaty erosion have intensified (documented in several 2023-26 sources), no state has yet crossed the bright red line in three decades.  Those escalating signals therefore belong to the “inside view” and are not incorporated here.  
4. Expert/market anchoring: No published betting-market or expert survey gives a numeric base figure for a 48-day horizon; thus the purely statistical outside view above remains our anchor.  
5. Upsets: The absence of events in 29 years does not imply impossibility; applying a conservative Jeffreys/Laplace adjustment prevents a zero estimate while acknowledging high stability.  

Outside view calibration:
• Base probability for at least one detonation in a 48-day window = 0.46 %.  
• Model uncertainty (small-n, potential under-reporting) argues for a slight upward cushion; doubling the Laplace estimate would still leave us below 1 %.  
• Adopt 0.70 % as a rounded, calibrated outside-view probability—well above zero, yet reflecting 30 years of perfect compliance.
