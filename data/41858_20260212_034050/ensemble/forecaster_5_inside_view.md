Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
• NPR (11 Feb 26) & The War Zone (6 Feb 26) – quote Under-Secretary Di Nanno’s new accusation that China tested in 2020 and is “preparing” further tests.  High-quality outlets, factual core = allegation; no confirming data; opinions from named experts (Lewis, Panda) dismiss the claim.  
• Global Times / Anadolu / ChinaDaily (11 Feb 26) – Chinese MFA rebuttals.  Official Chinese position; obviously self-interested but factual about denial.  
• AFP, IOL, Kronen Zeitung (11 Feb 26) – Russia says it will keep warheads under New START limits and test only if the US does.  Wire-service reliability; indicates no near-term Russian test plan.  
• Augsburger Allgemeine, CNA, NYT/Lapresse (10-11 Feb 26) – report that Washington “is considering” resuming nuclear tests.  Single-source, policy-discussion stories; no operational orders, no site activity.  
• Utah SCR-003 (Jan 26) – state-level symbolic resolution urging the federal government to avoid explosive tests; shows domestic resistance.  
• Think-tank / academic pieces (CFR, Arms Control Assn.), Dec 25 Bulletin comment – consensus that any US or Russian full-yield test needs many months of shaft prep and regulatory steps.  
Quality summary: multiple independent mainstream and expert sources agree no country has scheduled or physically prepared an explosive nuclear test; only political signalling exists.

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (down-weighting)  
• 34-year moratorium for US/RU and 30-year for CN; zero detonations since 1996 (structural, historically predictive).  
• Detectable civil-society & budget hurdles: NNSA says ≥6 mo. preparation for Nevada shots; Novaya Zemlya shafts still flooded (institutional facts).  
Moderate evidence (slight up-weighting)  
• End of New START + Russia CTBT withdrawal remove some normative barriers.  
• Public White House order (Oct 25) to “resume testing” and Moscow’s pledge to answer in kind increase political incentive.  
Weak evidence (minor)  
• Di Nanno’s allegation that China is “preparing tests” – single official, no corroboration, no seismic hints.  
• Satellite imagery hobbyist threads noting fresh buildings at Lop Nur – anecdotal, no tunnels/spoil piles visible.

Net evidence balance: pulls probability modestly above the outside-view floor but remains firmly in single digits.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Window remaining: 49 days (~1.6 months).  Halving it to 24 days would shave another 30-40 % off the already low odds because physical lead-time dominates; doubling to 98 days would increase odds only slightly (to ~6-7 %) – still insufficient time for the ≥6-month engineering cycle unless plans were secretly underway long before, which monitoring suggests is not the case.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (0.05 % window, inflated 10×) = 3.2 %.  
Adjust up +1 ppt for: treaty collapse, rhetoric, slight chance of very-low-yield clandestine Chinese shot.  
Adjust down −0.2 ppt for: requirement of “public report”—secret test that stays secret does not resolve question.  
Result ≈ 4 %.

If I learned tomorrow that DOE had begun clearing U1a shaft or Russia had announced a readiness exercise at Novaya Zemlya, I would jump to 20 – 25 %.  Conversely, if Trump or Lavrov publicly reaffirm a moratorium, I would drift back to 2 – 3 %.

Probability calibration
My best estimate: in 4 cases out of 100 similar 49-day windows we would see at least one publicly reported nuclear detonation by the US, Russia or China before 1 Apr 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between 12 Feb 26 and 1 Apr 26, will the US, Russia, or China set off a nuclear device (anywhere, any reason) and be publicly reported?”  
2. Outside-view base: 3.2 %.  
3. Consistency line – “4 of 100 times the criterion is met.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each)  
   • 30-year unbroken moratorium by all three powers.  
   • Monitoring shows no tunnelling/shaft prep at main test sites.  
   • NNSA and Russian MoD say tests need ≥6 months lead-time.  
   • Political rhetoric to test increased since New START expiry.  
5. Blind-spot – China conducts tiny (<1 kt) decoupled shot at Lop Nur and US intelligence immediately leaks it.  Would spike probability.  
6. Status-quo outcome – No test; inertia, logistics, and diplomatic costs dominate over political bluster.

Probability: 4%
