Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. USA Today, 11 Nov 2025 – Straight news report quoting Kremlin spokesman Peskov and FM Lavrov.  Factual core: Russia says it will test only if the United States does.  Mainstream U.S. outlet; good factual reliability, little technical depth; no evidence of an actual test.  

2. CBS News, 3 Nov 2025 – Straight news plus on-air Trump remarks; cites STRATCOM nominee Vice-Adm. Correll contradicting the President.  Major U.S. broadcaster; factual claims traceable to on-camera statements.  Provides useful reality check that neither Russia nor China is judged to be testing.  

3. Arms Control Association brief, 12 Feb 2026 – Specialist NGO, widely regarded as authoritative on treaty issues.  Focuses on diplomacy; confirms no detonations.  High quality.  

4. Armyrecognition, 12 Jan 2026 – Trade/defence news site.  Reports forthcoming Russian ballistic-missile flight tests, explicitly not nuclear explosions.  Medium reliability; mostly technical facts sourced to Russian MoD press briefings.  

5. Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) article, 9 Feb 2026 – Reputable think-tank; discusses end of New START, makes no claim of testing.  

6. ABC News, CNN, NPR pieces (Oct–Nov 2025) – Mainstream U.S. outlets quoting presidential statements, U.S. officials, outside experts (e.g., Kelsey Davenport, Matthew Bunn).  Consensus of identifiable experts: resuming explosive tests would be strategically and practically unlikely in the near term; infrastructure lead-time measured in many months.  

7. Agent_report (compiled open-source chronology, 12 Feb 2026) – Secondary synthesis.  Strength: brings together imagery, official Russian legal steps, U.S. accusations against China.  Weakness: some items rely on single-source press reports not independently corroborated; no proof of any completed test.  Useful for trend spotting, but treat specific claims (e.g., “22 Jun 2020 Chinese test”) cautiously.

Factual common ground across all sources:  
• No confirmed U.S., Russian, or Chinese nuclear detonation since 1996.  
• Russia’s CTBT withdrawal (2023) and site renovations increase readiness but Moscow ties any test to a prior U.S. move.  
• Trump’s Oct 2025 order lacks an executable plan; senior military officials say no explosive test is scheduled.  
• Chinese government flatly denies testing; outside evidence is circumstantial at best.

(b) Reference-class analysis  

Possible classes considered:  
1. Actual nuclear detonations by the three powers since their moratoria began (1992 US, 1990 RU, 1996 CN): count = 0 over 30+ years.  
2. All states’ nuclear tests since 1996: 6 (all by North Korea) in 30 years.  
3. Instances where a major-power leader publicly threatened to test but did not follow through: several (Clinton 1993, U.S. congressional proposals 1999-2002, Putin 2023), none ended in a test.

Class 1 is the narrowest and most directly relevant – same actors, same political constraints, same technical base – and therefore adopted as the baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Time remaining until 1 Apr 2026: 49 days (~1.6 months).  
Historical pattern: in the moratorium era, when tests have occurred (North Korea) they were preceded by months of tunnelling and detectable seismic precursors; even India–Pakistan in 1998 required weeks of on-site preparation despite far less elaborate containment rules.  Open-source satellite monitoring of Novaya Zemlya, Lop Nur, and the Nevada National Security Site up to early-February 2026 shows no tell-tale activities (large spoil piles, heavy equipment convoys) associated with an imminent shot.  Lead-time reality argues strongly against a detonation inside 49 days.

(d) Justification for outside-view probability  

Base rate: 0/30 years → annualised frequency ≈ 0.0–0.3 % per country-year (allowing for the possibility of an unobserved clandestine test).  Over a two-month window the naïve probability is below 0.05 %.  
Up-adjustments warranted for:  
• Unprecedented public political signalling by the U.S. President (Oct 2025) and Russia’s CTBT exit (2023) – indicates erosion of the taboo.  
• Physical upgrades at Novaya Zemlya and Lop Nur, suggesting reduced technical barriers.  
• Expiry of New START on 5 Feb 2026 removes one more political friction cost.  
Down-adjustments warranted for:  
• Strong domestic and international opposition in all three states; any test would incur enormous diplomatic cost.  
• Practical lead-time: sub-critical experiments at NNSS show readiness is months, not weeks.  
• Russian doctrine and public statements make their first move contingent on a U.S. test; China likewise shows no incentive to be first mover.  
• U.S. bureaucracy (DOE/NNSA) has not requested funding or begun shaft refurbishment; 49-day window is too tight.

Net effect: even after factoring in the higher-than-usual geopolitical tension, the outside view remains only a few percent.

Outside view calibration:

1. Anchor to the empirical base rate (≤ 0.3 % over two months).  
2. Apply a multiplicative factor to capture heightened 2025-26 tension.  A 10× inflation raises the window-probability to ~3 %.  
3. Consider historical “upset” frequency – very low in this domain because consequences are enormous and preparation detectable.  Therefore resist going much higher.  
4. Expert/market sentiment: specialist commentary (Arms Control Assoc., NGO briefs) treat an early-2026 test as “possible but still unlikely,” broadly consistent with a single-digit probability.

Outside View Prediction:
3.2 %
