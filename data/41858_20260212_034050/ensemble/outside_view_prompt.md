You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the United States, Russia or China detonate a nuclear device before April 1, 2026?

Question background:
USA Today November 11, 2025: [If Trump resumes testing of nuclear weapons, Russia says it's going to do it too](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/11/11/russia-trump-nuclear-tests/87209795007/)

> Senior Russian officials on Nov. 11 said they were still waiting for a White House explanation about what President Donald Trump meant he when said he had instructed the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing.

> And that if the United States resumes nuclear testing, Russia will too.

> The abrupt announcement from Trump came just months before the last remaining nuclear-arms-control treaty between the United States and Russia, known as New START, is due to expire in February 2026.

> Trump did not specify what kind of tests he was referring to or whether this included the detonation of nuclear warheads when he announced on Oct. 29 that the United States would "immediately" resume nuclear weapons tests, a move he said was needed to ensure the country keeps up with its rival nuclear powers.

[China denies Trump's claim to 60 Minutes about nuclear weapons tests, calls on U.S. to ensure global stability](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-trump-nuclear-weapons-tests-60-minutes-beijing-response/)

> China's Foreign Ministry responded on Monday to President Trump's assertion that Beijing has conducted clandestine nuclear weapons testing with a flat denial.

> "China's testing 'em too," Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. "You just don't know about it."

> "Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report — they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do."&#x20;

> Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM — the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons — told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.

# Summary of Article: Russia plans tests of a new generation of nuclear ballistic missiles in 2026 to replace Topol-M

**Source:** Armyrecognition  
**Author:** Jérôme Brahy  
**Date:** January 12, 2026

## Key Facts and Information:

### Planned Russian Missile Tests in 2026
- Russia intends to conduct **further tests of new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in 2026**, including both silo-based and road-mobile variants
- These tests are part of the planned replacement of the Topol-M missile system
- The new missiles may incorporate **new guided hypersonic warheads**, representing concurrent modernization of both boosters and payloads
- The replacement process for Topol-M was expected to start in 2026–2027

### Technical Details of New Missiles
- The new missiles will use **more advanced solid propellants** compared to earlier generations
- The guided hypersonic warheads would differ from the existing Avangard payload and would be classified by Russia as **"second-generation hypersonic warheads for intercontinental ballistic missiles"**
- No specific performance figures were released

### Potential Successor Systems
- **RS-24 Yars**: Already deployed with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs)
- **RS-26 Rubezh**: Associated with a more compact solid-fuel missile concept
- **Kedr program**: A secretive program linked to future solid-fuel design for longer-term deployment
- The January 12, 2026 statement did not explicitly identify which system would be tested, suggesting the tests may involve a separate development track

### Current Russian Nuclear Forces (2025 Assessment)
- Total stockpile: approximately **4,309 nuclear warheads** assigned to strategic and non-strategic forces
- Deployed strategic warheads: roughly **1,718** across land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and heavy bomber bases
- Land-based component includes:
  - **78 Topol-M missiles** (60 silo-based, 18 road-mobile)
  - **206 deployed units of RS-24 Yars**
  - Estimated **330 nuclear-armed ICBMs** capable of carrying up to **1,254 warheads**

### Topol-M Background
- Entered service: December 2000
- Operational range: approximately **11,000 kilometers**
- Launch mass: about 47,200 kilograms
- Maximum speed: approximately **Mach 22**
- Carries a **single nuclear warhead** with yield between 800 kilotons and 1 megaton
- Service life: 15 to 20 years (placing remaining missiles within the 2026–2027 replacement window)
- Production ended around 2010

**Note:** The article focuses on **missile testing** rather than nuclear warhead detonation testing. These are distinct activities—missile tests evaluate delivery systems, while nuclear detonation tests evaluate the explosive devices themselves.

# Summary of CFR Article: "Nukes Without Limits? A New Era After the End of New START"

**Date:** February 9, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **New START Treaty Expiration:** The New START treaty expired on February 5, 2026, ending the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia.

2. **Treaty Limits (Now Expired):** The treaty had capped both countries at:
   - 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each
   - 700 deployed ballistic missiles and bombers each
   - 800 strategic missile launchers each

3. **Ongoing Negotiations:** Despite expiration, reports indicate the two superpowers have agreed to continue talking and develop a follow-on agreement, bringing some optimism.

4. **Expected Outcome:** Even if a political agreement is reached, both Washington and Moscow appear poised to deploy more nuclear weapons, risking an arms race.

5. **Verification Breakdown:** On-site inspections ceased during COVID-19 and never restarted. Putin halted access to on-site inspections in 2023, leading some to call the treaty a "zombie" before its formal expiration.

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Austin Long** (MIT scholar, former Deputy Director for Strategic Stability at the Pentagon):
- Believes the treaty limits were "built for another time"
- Notes today's security environment is "night and day" compared to 2010 when negotiated
- Highlights China's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and North Korea's viable deterrent force as new factors
- Warns that without inspections, intelligence estimates will become less precise

**Jane Vaynman** (Johns Hopkins SAIS scholar, former State Department senior advisor):
- Emphasized that formal arms control agreements provide accountability beyond informal understandings
- Notes the treaty represented mutual commitment to avoid costly arms races

**Rose Gottemoeller** (lead U.S. negotiator of New START, former NATO Deputy Secretary General, Stanford Research Fellow):
- Noted both countries have been "accustomed for many years now to having our strategic offensive force deployments laid bare to the other side"
- Emphasized importance of the Bilateral Consultative Commission mechanism

**Michael Elliott** (former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's representative to New START negotiations):
- Warned that without inspections, intelligence community confidence will erode
- Predicted combatant commanders will become more cautious and "probably ask for more stuff," increasing budget demands

## Implications for the Forecasting Question:

The article does not mention any nuclear detonations or testing by the U.S., Russia, or China. It focuses on the diplomatic and strategic implications of the treaty's expiration rather than actual weapons testing activities.

# Summary of "What does Trump mean by 'nuclear testing?'" (ABC News)

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Trump's Announcement**: President Trump posted on social media that he "instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis" and that "That process will begin immediately." This was posted minutes before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

2. **Lack of Clarification**: The White House would not clarify whether Trump referred to explosive testing of nuclear weapons or to testing of delivery platforms (which is routine). When pressed, the White House only said it was "potentially" the case that Trump was referring to testing within current norms.

3. **VP Vance's Response**: Vice President JD Vance said the president's post "speaks for itself" and noted "Sometimes you've got to test it to make sure that it's functioning and working properly."

4. **Vice Adm. Correll's Interpretation**: Vice Adm. Richard Correll (nominee for U.S. Strategic Command commander) emphasized Trump's reference to testing on an "equal basis" and stated: "Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test. So I'm not reading anything into it or reading anything out," implying the U.S. would not resume nuclear test explosions.

## Historical Context:

- The U.S. last tested a nuclear weapon in 1992
- President George H.W. Bush signed a ban on nuclear testing (including underground)
- The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty of 1996 banned all test explosions, but is not in force because it lacks sufficient ratifications
- Only North Korea has undertaken explosive nuclear testing in the 21st century
- During the Cold War, the U.S. conducted over a thousand nuclear tests—hundreds more than Russia and far exceeding China's 47 total tests

## Expert Analysis (Named Source):

**Kelsey Davenport, Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association:**

- "The nonproliferation regime is at an inflection point"
- If any state tests now, "it could open the door for other countries to see a path forward to developing a viable nuclear deterrent"
- This "would undercut the long-held norm against nuclear testing that has bound every state except North Korea"
- If the U.S. "opens the door to nuclear testing," Russia and China would have "more opportunities to test and refine those warhead designs"
- "The computing power of the U.S. National Labs really gives the United States an edge here, but resuming nuclear testing could allow states like Russia and China to catch up with the United States"
- The global moratorium on testing "locked in a technical advantage for the United States"
- "That's one of the reasons why it would be foolish for Trump to reopen the door to nuclear testing, because it could allow other states to catch up"

## Political Response:

**Sen. Jack Reed (top Democrat on Armed Services Committee):** Said he would take Trump's comments "at face value" to mean "nuclear explosive testing." Noted that decades of U.S. testing yielded "sophisticated modeling codes" that allow the U.S. to maintain capabilities via supercomputers.

## Russian Response:

**Dmitry Peskov (spokesperson for Russian President Putin):** Warned that "If someone deviates from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly."

# Summary of CNN Article: "Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing. Here's why experts are confused"

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Author:** Tom Foreman

## Key Facts and Timeline:

- **Trump's Announcement:** Trump posted on Truth Social that he has "instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis" with the process to begin "immediately." This was in response to Russian President Putin bragging about testing a nuclear-powered torpedo and new cruise missile.

- **Last Nuclear Tests by Major Powers:**
  - Russia: 1990
  - United States: 1992
  - China: 1996
  - North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Matthew Bunn (Harvard University nuclear weapons expert):**
- States "every statement in that post is wrong"
- Notes the US does not have the world's most nuclear weapons
- Says other states are not carrying out nuclear tests
- Clarifies that the Department of Energy, not Department of Defense, carries out nuclear tests
- On potential testing: "The country that would benefit the most would be China"
- "It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States"

**Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll (Trump's nominee to head US Strategic Command):**
- Testified to Senate Armed Service Committee: "Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test"
- Said he's "not reading anything into it or reading anything out" regarding Trump's intent

**Jon Wolfsthal (former nuclear advisor to Biden and Obama):**
- Notes Russia, US, and China are "all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines"
- States: "We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important"

**John Tierney (former Democratic congressman, now heads Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation):**
- Finds Trump's "constantly shifting talk troublesome"
- Fears Trump is "injecting more instability" in an already tense international environment
- Notes the contradiction: "One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes. The next day he wants to start testing? It's dangerous."

## Technical and Diplomatic Context:

- **Definition:** The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as "generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads." Russia's recent missile and torpedo tests do not meet this strict definition.

- **Practical Challenges:** Federal studies show staging a nuclear test safely would likely require several years of preparation and might yield little useful information.

- **US Nuclear Knowledge:** The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding unmatched nuclear knowledge.

- **International Agreement:** Almost every nuclear-capable country has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades.

- **Trump's Stated Goal:** Trump said "I'd like to see a denuclearization. We're actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something."

- **Official Response:** Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of the article's publication date.

# Summary of NPR Article: "Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing. Here's what that would mean"

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Author:** Geoff Brumfiel

## Key Facts and Statements:

### Trump's Announcement:
- President Trump announced on Thursday (Oct. 29, 2025, based on article date) that the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons again for the first time in decades
- Trump stated: "We've halted many years ago, but with others doing testing I think it's appropriate to do so"
- He told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I see them testing, and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'"
- Trump did not call out Russia by name

### Testing Location and Methodology:
- The Nevada National Security Site (approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas) is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon
- The site is around 1,300 square miles in size (larger than Rhode Island)
- Historical testing: atmospheric tests in the 1950s, underground testing from 1962 to 1992
- Modern testing would likely be done in "a complex of deep underground mineshafts"
- The U.S. conducted hundreds of underground tests in Nevada during the Cold War

### Risks of Testing:
- Some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts in the past
- Tests could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas
- Newer Las Vegas buildings (including Stratosphere and Trump Hotel) "are not designed for massive, significant seismic activity"

### Historical Context - Test Moratorium:
- Russia (then Soviet Union) conducted its last nuclear test in 1990
- U.S. conducted its final test in 1992
- China conducted its last test in 1996
- The voluntary test moratorium has been in place to maintain nuclear stability

### Current U.S. Capabilities Without Testing:
- The U.S. currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to ensure bombs still work
- Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory, stated: "our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time"

### Timeline for Testing:
- A basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months
- A test producing scientifically useful data would likely take years

### Recent Russian Activities:
- On Sunday (before Oct. 30), Russia announced it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile
- On Wednesday, President Putin announced the successful test of a nuclear-powered underwater drone
- Note: Testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves
- These tests come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Corey Hinderstein** (Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace; former Deputy Administrator of NNSA 2021-2024):
- "I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States"
- Other nations "have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does"
- By the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China had conducted just 45)

**Robert Peters** (Senior Research Fellow for Strategic Deterrence at the Heritage Foundation):
- "It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now"
- "But there could very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting"

**Jon Wolfsthal** (Director of Global Risk at the Federation for American Scientists):
- Characterized the back-and-forth as having "all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race"
- "We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments"

**Paul Dean** (Vice President for Global Nuclear Policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative):
- Cost estimates for testing: "ballpark, $140 million per test"

If we receive the command, we can start testing at any time.”  Planet Labs imagery showed new tunnels, roads, and traffic at the site. (Kyiv Post, 17 Sep 2024).  
  Nature: official site-commander statement plus open-source satellite confirmation of construction activity.

• (Undated 2024 article, posted 2025) – Russia  
  – Militarnyi carried an interview with Sinitsyn reiterating that the facility is “fully prepared to resume nuclear tests … at any time” and recalling earlier Western satellite imagery of site upgrades. (Militarnyi, accessed in results).  
  Nature: repeated public readiness claim.

• 16 Feb 2024 – Russia  
  – Lieber Institute (West Point) analysis recorded that President Putin signed the law (2 Nov 2023) “withdrawing Russia’s ratification” of the CTBT and described Deputy FM Ryabkov’s accusation that the U.S. was preparing a Nevada test. (Lieber Institute, 16 Feb 2024).  
  Nature: legal treaty reversal; senior diplomatic justification referencing reciprocal U.S. actions.

D.  2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• 2 Nov 2023 – Russia  
  – President Putin formally rescinded Russia’s CTBT ratification. Kremlin statement said U.S. non-ratification created an “imbalance.”  The Arms Control Association noted Moscow would “not test unless Washington does first,” but left the option open. (ArmsControl, Nov 2023).  
  Nature: binding domestic legal change weakening test-ban regime.

• 17 Oct 2023 – Russia  
  – SIPRI previewed the Duma vote, citing Putin’s 5 Oct 2023 Valdai speech hinting Russia “might resume testing,” and highlighted satellite activity at Novaya Zemlya. (SIPRI, 17 Oct 2023).  
  Nature: strategic signalling plus evidence of infrastructure work.

• 22 Sep 2023 – United States / Russia / China  
  – CNN (referenced in the ArmsControl article) published commercial-satellite imagery showing new tunnels, roads and storage facilities at Lop Nur (China), Novaya Zemlya (Russia), and the Nevada National Security Site (USA). (ArmsControl summary, Nov 2023).  
  Nature: independent imagery suggesting all three powers were upgrading test sites simultaneously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Cross-cutting observations
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Treaty posture shifts  
   • Russia is the only one of the three to have legally altered its CTBT status in the period, withdrawing ratification (Nov 2023).  
   • The United States remains a signatory that has never ratified; calls in 2025 for explicit rejection of ratification surfaced in Project 2025 materials.  
   • China remains a signatory but non-ratifier; the 2026 U.S. allegation reignites scrutiny of its CTBT adherence.

2.  Site-readiness indicators  
   • Russia: Multiple open-source satellite studies (Planet Labs, CNN) and direct statements by the Novaya Zemlya site chief and the defence minister point to physical preparations completed by 2024-2025.  
   • United States: No authoritative statement of readiness, but Heritage Foundation papers, sub-critical experiments at NNSS (mentioned in Lieber Institute piece), and state-level political push-back indicate dormant but serviceable infrastructure.  
   • China: Expansion of Lop Nur tunnelling noted in 2023 CNN imagery; the U.S. 2026 allegation claims China used “decoupling” techniques to mask an earlier (2020) test.

3.  Intelligence accusations vs. admissions  
   – Only the United States has publicly accused another of actually conducting a clandestine nuclear-yield test (China, alleged 22 Jun 2020).  
   – None of the three powers has admitted conducting an explosive test during 2023-early 2026.  All statements remain at the level of preparation or conditional intent.

4.  Linkage to wider strategic environment  
   – Russian steps (CTBT withdrawal; Novaya Zemlya readiness) are consistently framed as responses to U.S. and NATO actions during the Ukraine war.  
   – U.S. testing rhetoric under President Trump in late 2025 is explicitly justified as parity with alleged Russian and Chinese tests and as leverage ahead of New START expiry (Feb 2026).  
   – Chinese activities are viewed through the lens of its rapidly expanding arsenal and alleged move toward a launch-on-warning posture; Beijing portrays U.S. accusations as attempts to “fabricate excuses” for American testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Remaining information gaps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• United States:  There is no definitive open-source description of current NNSS technical readiness levels (time, cost, specific shaft rehabilitations).  Recent sub-critical experiments (e.g., 18 Oct 2023 “non-nuclear chemical explosion” alluded to by Ryabkov) are not comprehensively catalogued.

• China:  No independent seismic, radionuclide, or satellite evidence has yet corroborated the alleged June 2020 yield-producing test; open-source imagery of Lop Nur after mid-2024 is sparse.

• Russia:  While construction at Novaya Zemlya is well documented, there is limited detail on the specific tunnel geometry, instrumentation, or emplacement work finished after September 2024.

• All three states:  No verified timelines or budgets for a first potential explosive test have been published; political decision-making thresholds remain opaque.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
Between January 2023 and 12 February 2026 every one of the three major nuclear powers took tangible steps that erode the 26-year-old global norm against explosive nuclear testing:

• Russia legally distanced itself from the CTBT and completed site preparations;  
• The United States’ head-of-state announced an intent to resume testing and directed planning;  
• China was accused by Washington of secretly breaching the moratorium and of preparing further tests.

While no detonations have yet occurred, the combination of treaty unraveling, physical test-site upgrades, and increasingly explicit official statements markedly raises the probability that at least one of the three states could conduct a nuclear explosive test before April 2026—the period relevant to the forecasting question.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
