You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"&#x20;\n\n> Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40711,\"question_id\":40323}}`",
