Analysis:
We must determine whether any confirmed detonation of a nuclear device by the United States, Russia, or China has occurred after 12 Nov 2025 and up to today, 12 Feb 2026. Relevant coverage could include:
• Announcements or confirmation of underground, atmospheric, or underwater nuclear tests.  
• Reports of sub-critical or “zero yield” tests (usually do not count as detonations but news may clarify).  
• Satellite-detected explosions (e.g., Arctic, Novaya Zemlya, Lop Nur, Nevada Test Site).  
• Official statements by DOE/NNSA, Rosatom, China MND, or IAEA-verified events.  
Therefore, queries should combine country name + nuclear test/detonation and focus on the 2025-2026 period.
