Analysis:
To judge the likelihood that any of the three powers will actually detonate a nuclear device before 1 Apr 2026, the most useful historical context is:  
• When each country last carried out a full-yield nuclear explosion (U.S. 1992, Russia 1990, China 1996) and their subsequent testing moratoria.  
• Post-Cold-War political and legal constraints (CTBT signature, U.S. Stockpile Stewardship, Russian CTBT withdrawal in 2023, coming New START expiry in Feb 2026).  
• Concrete recent signals of renewed testing: U.S. congressional language and NNSA readiness activities (2024-25), Trump’s 29 Oct 2025 order, Russian Duma authorization and Nov 2025 statements, satellite imagery of Novaya Zemlya and Lop Nur, and Chinese denials.  
Gathering these strands—dates, official statements, site preparations—provides an outside view on how often “talk” about testing has led to an actual detonation in the modern era (roughly zero since 1996) and whether present rhetoric departs from that pattern.
