The article emphasizes safety protocols and access restrictions at each location.\n\n### Sites Listed:\n\n1. **Fukushima, Japan** - Controlled-access areas remain from the 2011 disaster. Licensed operators run educational drives on decontaminated routes outside the plant itself.\n\n2. **Semipalatinsk Test Site (the Polygon), Kazakhstan** - Former Soviet nuclear test site with hundreds of past tests. Specialized tour operators take visitors to selected landmarks like Atomic Lake (Lake Chagan) with permits and controlled routes.\n\n3. **Trinity Site, New Mexico** - Site of the first atomic device detonation in 1945. Opens to public during limited \"open house\" dates (typically in October) inside White Sands Missile Range.\n\n4. **Nevada National Security Site (NNSS)** - Former Nevada Test Site for Cold War nuclear tests. **Public tours were canceled through February 2026 due to funding uncertainty, with future dates dependent on budget decisions.**\n\n5. **Hanford Site, Washington State** - Former plutonium production site with ongoing cleanup. Department of Energy-facilitated tours available, though the Manhattan Project B Reactor tour program has faced suspensions.\n\n6. **Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina** - Active nuclear reservation with public tour program requiring advance registration, limited to U.S. citizens with proper identification.\n\n7. **Oak Ridge, Tennessee** - Former Manhattan Project \"secret city.\" American Museum of Science and Energy runs guided bus tours. **For 2026 season, tours will not visit the X-10 Graphite Reactor due to ongoing site work.**\n\n8. **Los Alamos, New Mexico** - Active nuclear science site. Behind-the-fence tours offered only a few times per year by the lab through National Park Service, with reservations required.\n\n9. **Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, Philippines** - Completed but never commissioned facility, now a controlled tourist stop requiring advance booking.\n\n10. **Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), New Mexico** - Active deep geologic repository for transuranic waste. The facility itself is not open to public, but an educational \"WIPP Experience\" exhibit is available in Carlsbad.\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\n**This article does not contain information relevant to the forecasting question about nuclear device detonations.** The article discusses tourist access to historical nuclear sites and active facilities, but makes no mention of nuclear testing, detonations, or any plans by the United States, Russia, or China to detonate nuclear devices.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/11/nx-s1-5707495/china-us-nuclear-weapons-testing-trump\">\n# Summary of NPR Article: \"The U.S. claims China is conducting secret nuclear tests.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian dismissed the claims as baseless, stating they reflect a pattern of US distortion and politicization aimed at advancing nuclear hegemony and avoiding responsibility for disarmament. Lin emphasized that the US is the greatest disruptor of the international nuclear order, citing the expiration of the New START treaty on February 5, 2026, which ended over a decade of US-Russia strategic arms control cooperation. He criticized the US for maintaining a first-use nuclear policy, spending trillions on nuclear triad modernization, antimissile systems, and forward deployment of strategic assets. Lin also accused the US of applying double standards in nonproliferation efforts, undermining global stability. He urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on strategic stability, renew the five nuclear-weapon states' commitment to a nuclear test moratorium, and uphold the global consensus on banning nuclear testing. China reaffirmed its long-standing, self-defense-focused nuclear policy and its commitment to contributing constructively to international peace and security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 11:37 PM\nSource:[global.chinadaily.com.cn](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202602/12/WS698d0e12a310d6866eb38c55.html)\n\n**'It's not just a deal between the U.S. and Russia that will contain this nuclear race,' says expert**\nAccording to international relations researcher and professor Vitelio Brustolin, in an interview with Conex\u00e3o Record News on February 11, 2026, Russia is currently unable to expand its nuclear arsenal due to its high military spending\u201440% of its federal budget\u2014on the war in Ukraine, combined with extremely high inflation and some of the world\u2019s highest interest rates. Although Russia has stated it will continue limiting its nuclear arsenal if the United States does the same, no bilateral limits remain since the expiration of the U.S.-Russia treaty the previous week. Brustolin emphasized that the U.S. is not focused solely on Russia, but also demands that China halt its nuclear weapons development, noting that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has declared the China-Russia alliance 'solid as rock,' implying joint military action in a potential conflict.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the United States of attempting to justify its own potential resumption of nuclear testing through political manipulation and smear campaigns, labeling the U.S. the 'biggest disruptor to international nuclear order and global strategic stability.' The allegations originated from Thomas DiNanno, the U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, who claimed China used decoupling techniques to conceal a test with a yield in the hundreds of tons. However, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), through executive secretary Robert Floyd, stated that its monitoring system detected no event consistent with a nuclear explosion on that date, and that the assessment remains unchanged after further analysis. The U.S. and China have signed but not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, while Russia ratified it before withdrawing in 2023. China\u2019s last underground nuclear test was on July 29, 1996, and the U.S. conducted its final test on September 23, 1992.

The article notes that the last U.S. nuclear test occurred in 1992, but Trump previously stated his intention to resume detonations 'on a parity basis' with China and Russia. The New York Times suggests it remains uncertain whether the three major nuclear powers will enter a new arms race or if Trump\u2019s statements are aimed at prompting negotiations for a new agreement. Meanwhile, Politico reports that Trump is scheduled to visit Beijing in the first week of April for a long-anticipated summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, following a meeting between the two leaders in South Korea last autumn. A phone call between Trump and Xi occurred the previous week, covering topics ranging from trade issues to foreign conflicts.

What do experts think?**\nOn February 5, 2026, the New START treaty between the United States and Russia expired, raising concerns about a nuclear arms race. The following day, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno accused China of conducting a secret nuclear test on June 22, 2020\u2014just one week after the deadly Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops that resulted in 20 Indian and reportedly over 30 Chinese fatalities. DiNanno claimed China used decoupling techniques to obscure the test and evade seismic monitoring, asserting the test involved designated yields in the hundreds of tonnes. China strongly denied the allegations, calling them 'outright lies' and accusing the U.S. of fabricating narratives to justify restarting its own nuclear tests. The Chinese foreign ministry, Ambassador Shen Jian, and the Chinese embassy in Washington all reaffirmed China\u2019s adherence to its nuclear testing moratorium. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) stated its monitoring systems detected no event consistent with a nuclear explosion on June 22, 2020, and subsequent analyses confirmed this. However, Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association noted that very low-yield tests might evade detection. Notably, the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2025 arms control compliance report and the Pentagon\u2019s December 2025 China military report made no mention of nuclear testing by China. Despite the lack of evidence, U.S. assessments indicate China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with an estimated 600 warheads in 2026, projected to reach 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035. Experts emphasize the need for a new nuclear treaty to prevent escalation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 06:41 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-accuses-china-secret-nuclear-test-galwan-clash-evidence-experts-13978119.html)\n\n**Post-New START Era: U.S. Considers Expanding Nuclear Deployments and Restarting Nuclear Tests**\nFollowing the expiration of the New START treaty on February 5, 2026, the U.S. government has signaled potential plans to increase nuclear deployments and possibly resume nuclear testing, marking a reversal of nearly four decades of strict nuclear arms control. The New START treaty, which limited strategic nuclear weapons between the U.S. and Russia, expired after President Trump rejected Russia\u2019s proposal to extend it. Thomas DiNanno, U.S. Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security, stated at a Geneva conference that New START imposed 'unacceptable unilateral constraints' on the U.S. and failed to address emerging nuclear weapons development by China and Russia. He emphasized the need for any new treaty to include constraints on China. DiNanno outlined options to strengthen U.S. deterrence, including expanding existing forces and deploying new theater-level nuclear capabilities\u2014such as intermediate-range nuclear weapons not covered under New START. A rapid deployment option involves reactivating four missile launch tubes per Ohio-class submarine, which were previously sealed to comply with New START, potentially adding hundreds of warheads. DiNanno also claimed that China conducted a nuclear test on June 22, 2020, using 'decoupling' technology to mask the explosion\u2014a technique previously used by the U.S. during the 1958\u20131961 period. However, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) reported no seismic detection of a nuclear explosion on that date, and U.S. intelligence officials have remained divided on the claim. Despite this, DiNanno asserted the existence of the test with certainty, suggesting the U.S. may be preparing to conduct nuclear tests on an 'equal footing' with China and Russia. The New York Times interprets this rhetoric as the first concrete indication of Trump\u2019s earlier 2023 statement to test U.S. nuclear weapons on a reciprocal basis.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 05:12 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202602100129.aspx)\n\n**China Nuclear Test Allegations: U.S. Pushes for Expanded Arms Control Amid Growing Tensions**\nOn February 6, 2026, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Dinnanor, accused China of violating its moratorium on nuclear testing by conducting a clandestine underground nuclear explosion on June 22, 2020, with a yield of several hundred tons. He claimed China used 'decoupling' technology\u2014detonating the device in a large underground cavern separated from surrounding soil by air\u2014to suppress seismic vibrations and evade detection by global monitoring systems. This accusation was made just days before the expiration of the U.S.-Russia New START treaty, which President Trump announced he would not seek to extend, citing it as disadvantageous to the U.S. Dinnanor\u2019s statement appears to support Trump\u2019s position. He also alleged that Russia is assisting China in developing weapons-grade fissile material and warned that U.S. actions may include resuming nuclear tests in response to perceived Chinese and Russian nuclear activities. The U.S. is pushing for a broader nuclear arms control agreement that would include China and other nuclear-armed states, acknowledging the difficulty of such negotiations. According to a Pentagon report from December 2025, China possesses over 600 nuclear warheads and is projected to deploy up to 1,000 by 2030; Russia has approximately 4,300 warheads, and the U.S. has about 3,700. China\u2019s ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament, Shen Jian, condemned the U.S. for 'distorting and smearing' China\u2019s defense buildup and accused the U.S. of fueling the arms race. China has consistently refused to join such agreements, arguing that its nuclear arsenal is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia and that it will not participate until its arsenal is comparable in size to other major nuclear powers.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/paper/1743038)\n\n**Beyond the N-bomb: China, not Russia, now haunts the West**\nThe expiration of the US-Russia New START nuclear arms control treaty on February 4, 2026, passed with minimal global attention, signaling a shift in the global nuclear order. The article argues that China, not Russia, has become the primary strategic concern for the West, driven by Beijing\u2019s export controls on critical minerals and rare earth elements (REEs) in April and October 2025, which exposed vulnerabilities in EU, Indian, and global supply chains. In response, India increased its 2026-27 defence budget by over 15% of GDP to Rs 7.85 lakh crore ($85.6 billion), prioritized nuclear energy with a Rs 20,000 crore Nuclear Energy Mission for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and pursued a $3 billion uranium deal with Canada. The US, under President Donald Trump, realigned its foreign policy toward India, reinforcing the Quad and re-engaging with Pakistan, while Japan re-entered the arms race focused on China. The article posits that the West is adopting a long-term 'power-erosion' strategy, waiting for the eventual succession of aging leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, rather than confronting China directly. With only the US and Russia having signed major arms treaties since WWII, and with China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea now active nuclear players, the global nuclear landscape has shifted from a two-horse race to a multi-polar one. The US, now viewing Russia as a 'regional power' and China as a 'global challenger', has de-prioritized nuclear arms negotiations with Russia, focusing instead on countering China\u2019s technological and economic leverage through supply chain diversification, geopolitical realignment, and strategic alliances. Internal Chinese challenges, including widespread corruption within the military and the purging of high-ranking officials like General Zhang Youxia in January 2026 over alleged nuclear data leaks, are cited as evidence of systemic weakness, undermining China\u2019s military credibility. The article concludes that the West\u2019s focus has decisively shifted from Russia to China, with the lapse of the US-Russia treaty symbolizing this strategic pivot.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 08:22 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-n-bomb-china-not-russia-now-haunts-the-west-13976262.html)\n\n**Doomsday Clock Near Midnight as Nuclear Rhetoric Intensifies in 2025**\nThe Doomsday Clock, maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was set to 89 seconds before midnight in its latest update\u2014its closest approach to midnight since its inception in 1947. Alexandra Bell, president of the Bulletin, emphasized that current global decisions will determine whether nuclear threats are managed and reduced or allowed to escalate, undermining decades of progress since the 1960s. Russia, with 5,580 operational warheads, has shifted its nuclear doctrine since invading Ukraine, permitting nuclear use in defense against conventional weapons, placing forces on high alert, and deploying nuclear-capable missiles such as the Kinjal and Oreshnik. Though no nuclear detonation has occurred, Russia's nuclear rhetoric has succeeded in deterring direct NATO troop involvement in Ukraine, according to Uerj professor Layla Dawood. Russia has also tested 'Armageddon-like' weapons, including a hypersonic missile and a submarine drone, described by Mark Galeotti as too powerful to use without risking global destruction. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump called for nuclear testing, reigniting concerns despite the U.S. not conducting a nuclear detonation since 1992. The U.S. and Russia\u2019s New START treaty, which limits warheads to 1,550 and allows mutual inspections, expires in February 2026 without a replacement; Russia has proposed a one-year extension but the U.S. has not responded. Russia also halted inspections in 2023 while pledging to abide by limits. Bell warned that without such treaties, trust between powers erodes and global security diminishes. Russia\u2019s development of hypersonic missiles also increases qualitative threat levels despite numerical limits. Trump\u2019s first-term focus on including China in nuclear talks remains unfulfilled; China, with 600 warheads and a growing arsenal, is projected to reach 1,000 by 2030. The U.S. and Russia have not secured China\u2019s participation in multilateral negotiations. In June 2025, the U.S. bombed Iranian uranium enrichment facilities, prompting fears of Iran pursuing nuclear weapons and raising ethical questions about attacking nuclear sites. The attacks risked radioactive leaks, and the IAEA did not condemn the strikes, angering Iran. Additionally, nuclear facilities at Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl in Ukraine have suffered drone and artillery damage. Bell stressed the urgent need to debate the legitimacy of attacking nuclear sites due to their catastrophic humanitarian consequences. A review conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is scheduled for April 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/12/30/com-relogio-do-juizo-final-perto-da-meia-noite-retorica-nuclear-assumiu-tons-ainda-mais-perigosos-em-2025.ghtml)\n\n**Trump's Nuclear Testing Announcement Sparks Global Concern: Will India, China, and Russia Follow?**\nU.S. President Donald Trump has ordered new tests of the American nuclear weapons system, according to recent reports. However, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified in a Fox News interview that the tests do not involve nuclear explosions. He explained that the tests are system-based, referred to as 'non-nuclear detonations,' and focus on verifying the proper geometry and readiness of all components of nuclear weapons. The tests are intended to ensure that newly replaced nuclear weapons are superior to previous versions and are being conducted on new systems. The announcement has caused global concern, with speculation about whether countries like Russia, China, and India might follow suit. Trump first signaled the restart of nuclear testing on his Truth Social platform just before a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South Korean officials on November 03, 2025, marking the first such activity in 33 years. The U.S. government emphasized that no actual nuclear detonations are planned at this stage.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[\u0926\u0948\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u091c\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0923 (Dainik Jagran)](https://www.jagran.com/world/america-donald-trump-nuclear-testing-comment-will-russia-china-india-also-conduct-nuke-tests-40027178.html)\n\n**Is US Planning Nuclear Explosions Again? Team Trump Clarifies New Testing Plan**\nThe United States is planning to resume nuclear weapons testing procedures after a 33-year hiatus, as announced by President Donald Trump, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified on November 3, 2025, that these will not involve actual nuclear explosions. According to Wright, the tests are 'system tests' or 'non-critical explosions' designed to evaluate the functionality of non-nuclear components such as triggering systems and safety mechanisms without initiating a chain reaction. The Department of Energy will use data from these tests to assess new nuclear weapon designs and modern replacements for aging systems, aiming for improved performance and reliability. The last live nuclear test occurred in the 1980s, and Wright emphasized that advances in computing and simulation technology now allow scientists to replicate historical test conditions virtually. The announcement, made just before Trump\u2019s scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, was widely interpreted as a geopolitical signal to China and Russia amid rising global tensions. Trump did not confirm whether underground detonations\u2014similar to Cold War-era tests\u2014would be included.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 02:32 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/is-us-planning-nuclear-explosions-again-team-trump-clarifies-new-testing-plan-9675956.html)\n\n**U.S. Nuclear Weapon Tests Will Not Include Explosions, Energy Secretary Clarifies Amid Trump's Ambiguous Statements**\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, through Secretary Chris Wright, clarified that upcoming nuclear weapon tests will not involve nuclear explosions. In a Fox News 'Sunday Briefing' interview, Wright stated that the tests are 'non-critical explosions' and focus on system components to ensure proper geometry and configuration for a nuclear detonation. This clarification followed former President Donald Trump's ambiguous social media post on November 1, 2025, in which he claimed to have 'turned instructions to the Department of War to begin testing our nuclear weapons on equal footing.' Trump\u2019s remarks, made just before a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, sparked global concern. He later remained evasive, telling reporters on Air Force One: 'They will know very soon.' The U.S. has not conducted underground nuclear detonations since 1992 and has adhered to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which it signed but never ratified. Russia responded by stating it has not tested nuclear weapons and remains compliant, but warned that if the U.S. resumes testing, Russia will too, potentially reigniting Cold War tensions. The announcement followed Russia\u2019s recent testing of a nuclear-powered drone and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/mundo/pruebas-de-armamento-nuclear-en-eu-no-incluiran-explosiones-aclara-secretario-de-energia/)\n\n**Explainer: US nuclear re\u2011test could ignite global arms race; the world watches - The Tribune**\nThe United States has announced plans to restart nuclear weapons testing after a 33-year hiatus, marking a significant shift from decades of nuclear disarmament efforts. President Donald Trump justified the move by asserting the need to maintain parity with Russia and China, citing Russia\u2019s successful test of the 'Poseidon' nuclear-powered underwater drone\u2014a strategic weapon capable of generating tsunamis and targeting coastal infrastructure\u2014though the test did not involve a nuclear explosion. The decision risks triggering a new qualitative nuclear arms race, as noted by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which reported in its June 2025 annual assessment that nearly all nine nuclear-armed states\u2014US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel\u2014are actively modernizing their arsenals. The move undermines fragile arms-control frameworks, including the unratified Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the New START Treaty, which expires on February 4, 2026, and is already under strain due to Russia\u2019s suspension of participation in 2023. The US seeks to include China in future negotiations, but China has resisted. Despite claims that computer simulations can ensure nuclear reliability without explosive testing, environmental concerns persist, particularly regarding radioactive contamination in Nevada, where tests would be conducted. Past nuclear testing caused lasting ecological damage and displaced communities. The timing of the announcement\u2014during a critical juncture in arms control negotiations\u2014heightens global strategic tensions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/explainers/explainer-us-nuclear-retest-could-ignite-global-arms-race-the-world-watches/)\n\n**Nuclear Weapons in Russia, the U.S., and China: Washington Post Details Past Tests and Current Developments**\nThe Washington Post reports that the United States, Russia, and China are the signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996, which prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions. However, the treaty has not entered into force because key countries, including the U.S., have not ratified it. Russia formally withdrew its ratification in 2023, citing the U.S.'s failure to do so. President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Pentagon to begin nuclear weapons testing 'on equal terms' with Russia and China, sparking uncertainty about the decades-long U.S. moratorium on such tests. Trump stated the process would begin 'immediately' but provided no details on whether actual nuclear warheads would be used. The announcement followed reports from Moscow about the testing of two nuclear warheads with nuclear-powered engines, though Russian President Vladimir Putin refrained from conducting a nuclear detonation. The publication notes that U.S. experts estimate at least 36 months of preparation would be required before the U.S. could resume underground nuclear testing at the Nevada test site. Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that the 'Burevestnik' and 'Poseidon' tests did not involve nuclear detonations and thus did not violate the ban. Ukrainian military analyst Roman Svitanych suggested Putin's references to Soviet-era weapons like 'Burevestnik,' 'Poseidon,' and 'Sarmat' were symbolic, with 'Sarmat' being ineffective and 'Burevestnik' used for show. As of October 31, 2025, China possesses significantly fewer warheads than the U.S. and Russia.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 01:22 AM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/world/yaderna-zbroya-koli-viprobuvannya-provodilisya-v-ostanniy-raz-v-ssha-rosiji-ta-kitaji-13180794.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
