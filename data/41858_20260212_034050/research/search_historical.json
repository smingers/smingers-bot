A New Era After the End of New START\"\n\n**Date:** February 9, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **New START Treaty Expiration:** The New START treaty expired on February 5, 2026, ending the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia.\n\n2. **Treaty Limits (Now Expired):** The treaty had capped both countries at:\n   - 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each\n   - 700 deployed ballistic missiles and bombers each\n   - 800 strategic missile launchers each\n\n3. **Ongoing Negotiations:** Despite expiration, reports indicate the two superpowers have agreed to continue talking and develop a follow-on agreement, bringing some optimism.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome:** Even if a political agreement is reached, both Washington and Moscow appear poised to deploy more nuclear weapons, risking an arms race.\n\n5. **Verification Breakdown:** On-site inspections ceased during COVID-19 and never restarted. Putin halted access to on-site inspections in 2023, leading some to call the treaty a \"zombie\" before its formal expiration.\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Austin Long** (MIT scholar, former Deputy Director for Strategic Stability at the Pentagon):\n- Believes the treaty limits were \"built for another time\"\n- Notes today's security environment is \"night and day\" compared to 2010 when negotiated\n- Highlights China's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and North Korea's viable deterrent force as new factors\n- Warns that without inspections, intelligence estimates will become less precise\n\n**Jane Vaynman** (Johns Hopkins SAIS scholar, former State Department senior advisor):\n- Emphasized that formal arms control agreements provide accountability beyond informal understandings\n- Notes the treaty represented mutual commitment to avoid costly arms races\n\n**Rose Gottemoeller** (lead U.S. negotiator of New START, former NATO Deputy Secretary General, Stanford Research Fellow):\n- Noted both countries have been \"accustomed for many years now to having our strategic offensive force deployments laid bare to the other side\"\n- Emphasized importance of the Bilateral Consultative Commission mechanism\n\n**Michael Elliott** (former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's representative to New START negotiations):\n- Warned that without inspections, intelligence community confidence will erode\n- Predicted combatant commanders will become more cautious and \"probably ask for more stuff,\" increasing budget demands\n\n## Implications for the Forecasting Question:\n\nThe article does not mention any nuclear detonations or testing by the U.S., Russia, or China. It focuses on the diplomatic and strategic implications of the treaty's expiration rather than actual weapons testing activities.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-nuclear-testing/story?id=127035450\">\n# Summary of \"What does Trump mean by 'nuclear testing?'\" (ABC News)\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Trump's Announcement**: President Trump posted on social media that he \"instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis\" and that \"That process will begin immediately.\" This was posted minutes before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n2. **Lack of Clarification**: The White House would not clarify whether Trump referred to explosive testing of nuclear weapons or to testing of delivery platforms (which is routine). When pressed, the White House only said it was \"potentially\" the case that Trump was referring to testing within current norms.\n\n3. **VP Vance's Response**: Vice President JD Vance said the president's post \"speaks for itself\" and noted \"Sometimes you've got to test it to make sure that it's functioning and working properly.\"\n\n4. **Vice Adm. Correll's Interpretation**: Vice Adm. Richard Correll (nominee for U.S. Strategic Command commander) emphasized Trump's reference to testing on an \"equal basis\" and stated: \"Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test. So I'm not reading anything into it or reading anything out,\" implying the U.S. would not resume nuclear test explosions.\n\n## Historical Context:\n\n- The U.S. last tested a nuclear weapon in 1992\n- President George H.W. Bush signed a ban on nuclear testing (including underground)\n- The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty of 1996 banned all test explosions, but is not in force because it lacks sufficient ratifications\n- Only North Korea has undertaken explosive nuclear testing in the 21st century\n- During the Cold War, the U.S. conducted over a thousand nuclear tests\u2014hundreds more than Russia and far exceeding China's 47 total tests\n\n## Expert Analysis (Named Source):\n\n**Kelsey Davenport, Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association:**\n\n- \"The nonproliferation regime is at an inflection point\"\n- If any state tests now, \"it could open the door for other countries to see a path forward to developing a viable nuclear deterrent\"\n- This \"would undercut the long-held norm against nuclear testing that has bound every state except North Korea\"\n- If the U.S. \"opens the door to nuclear testing,\" Russia and China would have \"more opportunities to test and refine those warhead designs\"\n- \"The computing power of the U.S. National Labs really gives the United States an edge here, but resuming nuclear testing could allow states like Russia and China to catch up with the United States\"\n- The global moratorium on testing \"locked in a technical advantage for the United States\"\n- \"That's one of the reasons why it would be foolish for Trump to reopen the door to nuclear testing, because it could allow other states to catch up\"\n\n## Political Response:\n\n**Sen. Jack Reed (top Democrat on Armed Services Committee):** Said he would take Trump's comments \"at face value\" to mean \"nuclear explosive testing.\" Noted that decades of U.S. testing yielded \"sophisticated modeling codes\" that allow the U.S. to maintain capabilities via supercomputers.\n\n## Russian Response:\n\n**Dmitry Peskov (spokesperson for Russian President Putin):** Warned that \"If someone deviates from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-experts-russia\">\n# Summary of CNN Article: \"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing. Here's why experts are confused\"\n\n**Date:** October 31, 2025  \n**Author:** Tom Foreman\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n- **Trump's Announcement:** Trump posted on Truth Social that he has \"instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis\" with the process to begin \"immediately.\" This was in response to Russian President Putin bragging about testing a nuclear-powered torpedo and new cruise missile.\n\n- **Last Nuclear Tests by Major Powers:**\n  - Russia: 1990\n  - United States: 1992\n  - China: 1996\n  - North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Matthew Bunn (Harvard University nuclear weapons expert):**\n- States \"every statement in that post is wrong\"\n- Notes the US does not have the world's most nuclear weapons\n- Says other states are not carrying out nuclear tests\n- Clarifies that the Department of Energy, not Department of Defense, carries out nuclear tests\n- On potential testing: \"The country that would benefit the most would be China\"\n- \"It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States\"\n\n**Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll (Trump's nominee to head US Strategic Command):**\n- Testified to Senate Armed Service Committee: \"Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test\"\n- Said he's \"not reading anything into it or reading anything out\" regarding Trump's intent\n\n**Jon Wolfsthal (former nuclear advisor to Biden and Obama):**\n- Notes Russia, US, and China are \"all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms \u2013 missiles, bombers, submarines\"\n- States: \"We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important\"\n\n**John Tierney (former Democratic congressman, now heads Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation):**\n- Finds Trump's \"constantly shifting talk troublesome\"\n- Fears Trump is \"injecting more instability\" in an already tense international environment\n- Notes the contradiction: \"One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes. The next day he wants to start testing? It's dangerous.\"\n\n## Technical and Diplomatic Context:\n\n- **Definition:** The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as \"generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads.\" Russia's recent missile and torpedo tests do not meet this strict definition.\n\n- **Practical Challenges:** Federal studies show staging a nuclear test safely would likely require several years of preparation and might yield little useful information.\n\n- **US Nuclear Knowledge:** The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding unmatched nuclear knowledge.\n\n- **International Agreement:** Almost every nuclear-capable country has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades.\n\n- **Trump's Stated Goal:** Trump said \"I'd like to see a denuclearization. We're actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.\"\n\n- **Official Response:** Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of the article's publication date.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/nx-s1-5590818/trump-nuclear-testing\">\n# Summary of NPR Article: \"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

(ArmsControl, Nov 2023).  \n  Nature: binding domestic legal change weakening test-ban regime.\n\n\u2022 17 Oct 2023 \u2013 Russia  \n  \u2013 SIPRI previewed the Duma vote, citing Putin\u2019s 5 Oct 2023 Valdai speech hinting Russia \u201cmight resume testing,\u201d and highlighted satellite activity at Novaya Zemlya. (SIPRI, 17 Oct 2023).  \n  Nature: strategic signalling plus evidence of infrastructure work.\n\n\u2022 22 Sep 2023 \u2013 United States / Russia / China  \n  \u2013 CNN (referenced in the ArmsControl article) published commercial-satellite imagery showing new tunnels, roads and storage facilities at Lop Nur (China), Novaya Zemlya (Russia), and the Nevada National Security Site (USA). (ArmsControl summary, Nov 2023).  \n  Nature: independent imagery suggesting all three powers were upgrading test sites simultaneously.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nE.  Cross-cutting observations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Treaty posture shifts  \n   \u2022 Russia is the only one of the three to have legally altered its CTBT status in the period, withdrawing ratification (Nov 2023).  \n   \u2022 The United States remains a signatory that has never ratified; calls in 2025 for explicit rejection of ratification surfaced in Project 2025 materials.  \n   \u2022 China remains a signatory but non-ratifier; the 2026 U.S. allegation reignites scrutiny of its CTBT adherence.\n\n2.  Site-readiness indicators  \n   \u2022 Russia: Multiple open-source satellite studies (Planet Labs, CNN) and direct statements by the Novaya Zemlya site chief and the defence minister point to physical preparations completed by 2024-2025.  \n   \u2022 United States: No authoritative statement of readiness, but Heritage Foundation papers, sub-critical experiments at NNSS (mentioned in Lieber Institute piece), and state-level political push-back indicate dormant but serviceable infrastructure.  \n   \u2022 China: Expansion of Lop Nur tunnelling noted in 2023 CNN imagery; the U.S. 2026 allegation claims China used \u201cdecoupling\u201d techniques to mask an earlier (2020) test.\n\n3.  Intelligence accusations vs. admissions  \n   \u2013 Only the United States has publicly accused another of actually conducting a clandestine nuclear-yield test (China, alleged 22 Jun 2020).  \n   \u2013 None of the three powers has admitted conducting an explosive test during 2023-early 2026.  All statements remain at the level of preparation or conditional intent.\n\n4.  Linkage to wider strategic environment  \n   \u2013 Russian steps (CTBT withdrawal; Novaya Zemlya readiness) are consistently framed as responses to U.S. and NATO actions during the Ukraine war.  \n   \u2013 U.S. testing rhetoric under President Trump in late 2025 is explicitly justified as parity with alleged Russian and Chinese tests and as leverage ahead of New START expiry (Feb 2026).  \n   \u2013 Chinese activities are viewed through the lens of its rapidly expanding arsenal and alleged move toward a launch-on-warning posture; Beijing portrays U.S. accusations as attempts to \u201cfabricate excuses\u201d for American testing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nF.  Remaining information gaps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 United States:  There is no definitive open-source description of current NNSS technical readiness levels (time, cost, specific shaft rehabilitations).  Recent sub-critical experiments (e.g., 18 Oct 2023 \u201cnon-nuclear chemical explosion\u201d alluded to by Ryabkov) are not comprehensively catalogued.\n\n\u2022 China:  No independent seismic, radionuclide, or satellite evidence has yet corroborated the alleged June 2020 yield-producing test; open-source imagery of Lop Nur after mid-2024 is sparse.\n\n\u2022 Russia:  While construction at Novaya Zemlya is well documented, there is limited detail on the specific tunnel geometry, instrumentation, or emplacement work finished after September 2024.\n\n\u2022 All three states:  No verified timelines or budgets for a first potential explosive test have been published; political decision-making thresholds remain opaque.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\nBetween January 2023 and 12 February 2026 every one of the three major nuclear powers took tangible steps that erode the 26-year-old global norm against explosive nuclear testing:\n\n\u2022 Russia legally distanced itself from the CTBT and completed site preparations;  \n\u2022 The United States\u2019 head-of-state announced an intent to resume testing and directed planning;  \n\u2022 China was accused by Washington of secretly breaching the moratorium and of preparing further tests.\n\nWhile no detonations have yet occurred, the combination of treaty unraveling, physical test-site upgrades, and increasingly explicit official statements markedly raises the probability that at least one of the three states could conduct a nuclear explosive test before April 2026\u2014the period relevant to the forecasting question.</Agent_report>\n"
