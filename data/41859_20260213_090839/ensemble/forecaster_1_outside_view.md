Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**ONS Official Data Sources (December 2025):**
- Multiple sources confirm CPIH for December 2025 at 3.6%, with monthly 2025 data showing: Jan 3.9%, Feb 3.7%, Mar 3.4%, Apr 4.1%, May 4.0%, Jun 4.1%, Jul 4.2%, Aug 4.1%, Sep 4.1%, Oct 3.8%, Nov 3.5%, Dec 3.6%
- These are authoritative official statistics from ONS, the resolution source
- Quality: Highest - these are the actual historical outcomes
- **Key fact: The 2025 calendar year average CPIH is approximately 3.9%** (calculated from monthly data)

**Historical Context (2022):**
- Guardian article (July 11, 2022) documents the leadership race mechanics
- Liz Truss won the Conservative leadership contest in September 2022
- This confirms the conditional criterion is satisfied

**Agent Report on Forecasts Made in Late 2022:**
- OBR (November 2022): Projected CPI ~0.3% for 2025, implying CPIH ~0.1%
- BoE (November 2022): Projected CPI "slightly negative" for 2025, implying CPIH near 0%
- IMF (October 2022): Projected CPI ~1.8% for 2025, implying CPIH ~1.6%
- Quality: High - these were official forecasts from authoritative institutions
- **Critical insight: All forecasters in late 2022 expected 2025 inflation to be 0-2%, far below the actual 3.9% outcome**

**Economic Context Articles (2026):**
- MoneyWeek (dated April 21, 2023 but discussing 2026 events - likely misdated): Interest rates at 3.75%, inflation at 3.4% in December 2025
- Morningstar (January/February 2026): Discusses December 2025 inflation and forward outlook
- These provide context but are dated after the resolution period

**FRED Data:**
- Shows Q1 2025 CPI at 135.60 (Index 2015=100)
- Year-over-year change of +3.7%
- Consistent with ONS CPIH data

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **UK CPIH annual rates 2016-2024:** 
   - Range: 0.7% (2016, 2020) to 7.9% (2022)
   - Mean: ~3.2%
   - Suitability: Good - captures recent UK inflation dynamics

2. **UK CPIH in post-crisis normalization periods:**
   - 2017-2019: 2.6%, 2.2%, 1.8% (declining from Brexit/post-crisis)
   - 2024-2025: 3.6%, 3.9% (declining from energy crisis peak)
   - Suitability: Excellent - 2025 represents a normalization phase

3. **Official forecasts vs. outcomes for UK inflation:**
   - Late 2022 forecasts: 0-2% for 2025
   - Actual outcome: 3.9%
   - Forecast error: +2-4 percentage points
   - Suitability: Moderate - shows forecasting difficulty but this is now historical data

**Chosen reference class:** UK CPIH in post-crisis normalization periods, with emphasis on the actual 2025 monthly trajectory showing gradual decline from 4.2% (July peak) to 3.6% (December).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Critical timing consideration:** Today is February 13, 2026. The question asks about 2025 inflation, which is **already complete and measured**. The December 2025 ONS data has been published.

The question resolves based on "the annual inflation rate of the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) for the respective calendar years." For 2021, the example given was 2.49%.

**Calculation method:** The annual inflation rate for a calendar year is typically calculated as either:
1. The December year-over-year rate (3.6% for 2025)
2. The average of monthly year-over-year rates (~3.9% for 2025)

The 2021 example of 2.49% suggests ONS uses a specific methodology. Based on standard ONS practice, this is likely the calendar year average of monthly CPIH rates.

## (d) Justification

**Key facts:**
1. Liz Truss won the Conservative leadership in September 2022 (conditional satisfied)
2. The complete 2025 CPIH data is available from ONS
3. Monthly 2025 CPIH rates ranged from 3.4% (March) to 4.2% (July)
4. December 2025 CPIH was 3.6%
5. The calendar year average appears to be approximately 3.9%

**Historical context:** The Truss mini-budget (September 2022) and subsequent market turmoil led to her resignation after 49 days. However, the question asks about inflation "given Liz Truss wins" - not attributing causation, just conditioning on her victory. The actual 2025 inflation outcome (3.9%) was significantly higher than all official forecasts made in late 2022 (0-2%), reflecting persistent services inflation and stickier wage growth than anticipated.

**Resolution approach:** Since this is historical data that has already been published by ONS, the prediction should center tightly around the known outcome. The only uncertainty is which specific ONS figure will be used for resolution - likely either 3.6% (December rate) or ~3.9% (calendar year average).

Outside view calibration:

Given that 2025 has concluded and ONS data is published, this is effectively a question about which specific ONS metric will be used. The resolution criteria state "annual inflation rate...for the respective calendar years" with the 2021 example of 2.49%.

Checking ONS methodology: The 2.49% for 2021 matches the calendar year average of monthly CPIH rates, not the December point estimate (which was 4.2% in December 2021).

Therefore, the resolution value should be the 2025 calendar year average: approximately **3.9%** based on the monthly data provided.

However, I should account for:
- Potential calculation variations in averaging methodology
- Possible data revisions (though rare for CPIH)
- Uncertainty in exact ONS reporting convention

The distribution should be narrow but not infinitesimally so, centered on 3.9% with small allowance for methodological variation.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.7
Percentile 20: 3.8
Percentile 40: 3.85
Percentile 60: 3.95
Percentile 80: 4.0
Percentile 90: 4.1
