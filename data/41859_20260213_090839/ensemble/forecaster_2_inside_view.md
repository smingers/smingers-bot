Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Official Data Sources:**
- **ONS October 2025 & December 2025 CPIH bulletins**: Official UK statistics showing actual 2025 monthly CPIH rates. October 2025 CPIH was 3.8%, December 2025 was 3.6%. These are factual, backward-looking measurements from the authoritative source. Published in late 2025/early 2026.
- **Crossland Solicitors (May 2025)**: Reports May 2025 CPIH at 4.0%, citing ONS. Notes correction to April 2025 data. Factual secondary source.
- **Barclays Consumer Spending (January 2026)**: Reports "latest CPIH inflation rate: 3.6%" as of reporting period. Factual but unclear if this is December 2025 or earlier.

**Key Historical Context:**
- **Liz Truss did win the Conservative leadership in September 2022** (confirmed by multiple sources including the Chinese-language article). She served as PM from September-October 2022 before resigning. This satisfies the conditional resolution criteria.
- The 2025 CPIH trajectory from ONS data shows: peaked at 4.2% in July 2025, declined to 3.4% in March 2025, rose again through summer, then declined to 3.6% by December 2025.

**Weak/Irrelevant Sources:**
- Australian Liberal Party leadership articles (February 2026): Completely irrelevant to UK inflation.
- UK political commentary (Farage, Badenoch, Ratcliffe): No direct bearing on 2025 inflation outcomes.
- Statista forecast article: Contains some 2025 data (Q3 2025 at 3.9%) but mixes historical with projections.

**Critical Gap:** None of the sources provide the **annual average CPIH for calendar year 2025**, which is what the resolution criteria requires. The ONS typically calculates this as the mean of 12 monthly rates or uses a specific methodology for annual rates.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **ONS monthly CPIH data for 2025** (multiple independent confirmations): Shows inflation remained elevated in 3.4-4.2% range throughout 2025, significantly higher than the outside view base rate of ~0.9%. This is direct, factual evidence from the authoritative source.
- **Trajectory pattern**: The 2025 monthly data shows CPIH started at 3.9% (January), dipped to 3.4% (March), peaked at 4.2% (July), and ended at 3.6% (December). This suggests an annual average likely in the 3.7-4.0% range.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Persistence of inflation**: The fact that CPIH remained above 3.4% throughout all of 2025 indicates the outside view forecasts (0-2%) were far too optimistic about disinflation speed.
- **Energy and food prices**: October 2025 ONS bulletin notes food inflation at 4.9%, housing costs at 5.0%, suggesting persistent underlying pressures.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Political commentary and market analysis from 2026: Retrospective and not directly measuring 2025 annual CPIH.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks for **calendar year 2025 annual CPIH inflation**. We are forecasting from February 13, 2026, looking backward at a completed year. The resolution date is April 1, 2026, when ONS would typically publish the final annual figure.

**Critical insight**: This is essentially a nowcast, not a forecast. The 2025 data is complete; we're just awaiting the official annual calculation. Given monthly rates of 3.4-4.2% throughout 2025, the annual average is highly constrained.

If the timeframe were halved (forecasting mid-2025 from late 2024): Much higher uncertainty, as second-half trajectory unknown.
If doubled (forecasting 2026 from now): Significantly higher uncertainty due to policy changes, global conditions.

## (d) Justification for Distribution Shift

**The outside view base rate (median 0.9%, 10th percentile -0.5%, 90th percentile 4.0%) is completely invalidated by actual 2025 outcomes.**

The outside view was anchored to OBR/BoE/IMF forecasts from late 2022 that predicted rapid disinflation to near-zero by 2025. These forecasts proved dramatically wrong because:

1. **Services inflation persistence**: Wage growth remained elevated (>4% mentioned in sources), keeping domestic inflation sticky.
2. **Energy price floor**: While energy prices moderated from 2022 peaks, they didn't collapse as forecasted.
3. **Global factors**: Persistent global inflation pressures not anticipated in 2022 forecasts.

**Calculating the annual average from monthly data:**
Using the ONS monthly trajectory provided:
- Q1 2025: (3.9% + 3.7% + 3.4%) / 3 = 3.67%
- Q2 2025: (4.1% + 4.0% + 4.1%) / 3 = 4.07%
- Q3 2025: (4.2% + 4.1% + 4.1%) / 3 = 4.13%
- Q4 2025: (3.8% + 3.5% + 3.6%) / 3 = 3.63%

**Implied annual average: (3.67 + 4.07 + 4.13 + 3.63) / 4 = 3.875%**

This is a mechanical calculation from observed monthly data. The only remaining uncertainty is:
- Exact ONS methodology for annual calculation (might differ slightly from simple averaging)
- Potential data revisions (historically small for CPIH)
- Rounding conventions

Distribution calibration:

Given we have near-complete information about 2025 monthly CPIH rates, this is essentially a measurement uncertainty problem, not a forecasting problem.

**Central estimate: 3.9%** (rounding the calculated 3.875%)

**Uncertainty bounds:**
- 10th percentile: 3.6% (if ONS methodology or revisions push slightly lower)
- 90th percentile: 4.1% (if methodology or revisions push slightly higher)

The distribution should be very tight because:
1. All 12 monthly readings are known
2. CPIH methodology is stable and transparent
3. Revisions to annual figures are typically ±0.1-0.2 ppt

**Final distribution:**
- Concentrate 80% of probability mass in 3.7-4.1% range
- Allow small tails for methodological surprises or data revisions

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Annual CPIH inflation rate for calendar year 2025, in %, published by ONS. ✓

2. **Outside view**: Base rate median 0.9%, 10th: -0.5%, 90th: 4.0%. My final prediction is dramatically higher because actual 2025 monthly data (3.4-4.2%) completely supersedes 2022 forecasts. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 3.9%; mean ≈ 3.9%. This aligns with mechanical averaging of observed monthly CPIH rates throughout 2025. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - ONS monthly CPIH data: January 3.9%, March 3.4%, July 4.2%, December 3.6%
   - All 12 months of 2025 remained in 3.4-4.2% range
   - Simple average of quarterly averages yields 3.875%
   - ONS is authoritative source; data is factual, not speculative ✓

5. **Blind-spot**: ONS uses a significantly different methodology for annual calculation than simple averaging, pushing result outside 3.6-4.1% range. Most likely direction: could go either way but probably within ±0.2 ppt.

6. **Status quo**: The "status quo" is the observed 2025 monthly data. No volatility remains; year is complete.

7. **Technicalities**: Percentiles strictly increasing ✓, units in % ✓, values within -5 to 20 bounds ✓
