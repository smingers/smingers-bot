Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**ONS Consumer Price Inflation Bulletins (December 2025)**: These are the authoritative official statistics from the UK Office for National Statistics. They show CPIH at 3.6% for December 2025, with monthly data throughout 2025 ranging from 3.4% to 4.2%. This is the primary resolution source and is completely factual. Date: December 2025 (current data).

**ONS Average Weekly Earnings (January 2026)**: Official ONS data showing wage growth at 4.5% for September-November 2025, with CPIH averaging 3.8% for that period. Factual government statistics. Date: January 2026.

**YCharts UK CPIH Data**: Aggregates ONS data showing the full 2025 monthly series. Confirms December 2025 CPIH at 3.6%. Purely factual data compilation. Date: Current.

**Guardian Article (July 2022)**: Historical article about the Conservative leadership race. Factual reporting on the timeline and candidate positions. Rishi Sunak's quoted warnings about inflation and "fairy tales" are his stated opinions. Date: July 2022 (historical context only).

**MoneyWeek Article (April 2023 publication date, but discusses 2026 events)**: There's a date inconsistency - published April 2023 but discusses February 2026 BoE decisions. Likely a typo; content appears to be from early 2026. Contains factual BoE data (3.75% rate, 3.4% December inflation) plus expert opinions from Andrew Bailey (BoE Governor - authoritative), Laith Khalaf, Sanjay Raja (Deutsche Bank economist - credible), and others. The factual data aligns with ONS sources.

**Morningstar Articles (January-February 2026)**: Recent analysis with factual BoE and inflation data. Contains expert opinions from Grant Slade (Morningstar economist), Christian Schulz (Allianz), Trevor Greetham (Royal London), and others. These are identifiable experts providing informed opinions about future trends.

**Statista Article**: Contains redacted data (paywalled), limiting usefulness. Shows general trends but specific numbers are unavailable.

**US BLS Article**: Irrelevant - covers US inflation, not UK.

**Agent Report on Truss Mini-Budget Impact**: Comprehensive synthesis of OBR, BoE, and IMF forecasts from November 2022. Key finding: Official forecasters in late 2022 expected CPIH in 2025 to be around 0-2%, with most clustering near 0%. The actual outcome (3.6-3.9% average for 2025) was materially higher than these forecasts. The report correctly identifies that the Energy Price Guarantee suppressed near-term inflation but fiscal stimulus was expected to add ~0.3 ppts medium-term. High quality synthesis of authoritative sources.

**FRED CPI Data**: Shows UK CPI (not CPIH) at 135.60 for Q1 2025, representing 3.7% year-over-year growth. Corroborates the ONS CPIH data showing inflation in the 3-4% range.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **UK CPIH annual rates 2016-2025**: Mean ~3.0%, range 0.7-7.9%. This includes both the post-2021 inflation spike and earlier stable periods. Suitability: Moderate - includes unusual pandemic/energy crisis period.

2. **UK CPIH in post-spike normalization periods**: After the 2022-2023 peak (9.6% in October 2022), inflation declined to 3.6% by end-2024 and averaged 3.9% in 2025. Suitability: High - most relevant to current trajectory.

3. **UK CPIH in "normal" pre-pandemic years (2016-2019)**: Mean ~2.1%, range 1.8-2.6%. Suitability: Moderate - represents BoE target environment but may not capture current structural factors.

4. **UK CPIH during disinflation phases**: Historical periods when inflation fell from elevated levels toward target. Suitability: High - matches current phase.

**Selected Reference Class**: Post-spike normalization (2024-2025 trajectory) combined with historical disinflation patterns. The 2025 data shows inflation stabilizing in the 3.5-4.2% range, consistently above the 2% target but well below the 2022-2023 peaks.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: The question asks for calendar year 2025 CPIH inflation. As of today (February 13, 2026), we have complete data for 2025. The ONS has published monthly CPIH rates for all of 2025, with December 2025 at 3.6%.

**Historical Pattern**: The 2025 monthly series shows:
- Q1 2025: 3.9%, 3.7%, 3.4% (declining trend)
- Q2 2025: 4.1%, 4.0%, 4.1% (slight uptick)
- Q3 2025: 4.2%, 4.1%, 4.1% (peak and plateau)
- Q4 2025: 3.8%, 3.5%, 3.6% (declining again)

The annual average would be approximately 3.9% based on these monthly figures.

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors:**

1. **Complete Data Available**: Unlike a typical forecast, we have the actual 2025 outcome. The ONS December 2025 bulletin provides the definitive CPIH rate of 3.6% for December, and the monthly series throughout 2025.

2. **Calculation Method**: The question asks for "annual inflation rate" for 2025. This could mean either:
   - December 2025 year-over-year rate: 3.6%
   - Calendar year average: ~3.9% (average of monthly rates)
   
   The resolution criteria reference the ONS bulletin and cite 2021's annual rate as 2.49%, which was the calendar year average, suggesting the average interpretation.

3. **Liz Truss Context**: Liz Truss did win the Conservative leadership contest in September 2022 and became PM. Her mini-budget caused market turmoil, but most policies were reversed by October 2022. The actual 2025 inflation outcome (3.6-3.9%) was significantly higher than the 0-2% forecasted by OBR/BoE/IMF in November 2022, reflecting greater persistence in services inflation and wage growth than expected.

4. **Uncertainty Factors**: The main uncertainty is whether the resolution uses December's 12-month rate (3.6%) or the calendar year average (~3.9%). Historical precedent suggests the latter.

Outside view calibration:

Given that we have complete 2025 data from the authoritative ONS source, this is effectively a resolved question rather than a forecast. The uncertainty lies primarily in interpretation of "annual inflation rate":

- **December 2025 12-month CPIH rate**: 3.6% (definitive)
- **Calendar year 2025 average**: Approximately 3.9% based on monthly data (January 3.9% through December 3.6%, averaging ~3.9%)

The resolution criteria state it will use ONS data and cite 2021's rate as 2.49%, which was indeed the calendar year average. This strongly suggests the answer should be the 2025 calendar year average.

My distribution should be very narrow, centered on 3.9% with slight uncertainty around calculation methodology:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.6
Percentile 20: 3.7
Percentile 40: 3.85
Percentile 60: 3.95
Percentile 80: 4.0
Percentile 90: 4.1
