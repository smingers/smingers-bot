Analysis:
**1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase):**  
UK **CPIH** (“Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs”) **annual inflation rate for calendar year 2025**, in **percent**, per **ONS**. Resolves *Ambiguous* only if Liz Truss did not win the 2022 Conservative leadership contest (she did).

## (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)

1) **ONS CPI Inflation Bulletin (October 2025)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** CPIH 12‑month rate in Oct 2025 = 3.8% and a month-by-month 2025 path up to Oct; category contributions; energy price cap notes.  
- **Quality:** Highest (official resolution source).  
- **Date:** Oct 2025 (historical data from today’s perspective).

2) **ONS CPI Inflation Bulletin (December 2025)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** CPIH 12‑month rate in Dec 2025 = 3.6% (and the 2025 within‑year min/max range and narrative drivers).  
- **Quality:** Highest (official resolution source; also contains the complete 2025 monthly 12‑month-rate series).  
- **Date:** Dec 2025.

3) **Barclays consumer spending press release (Jan; referenced as “latest CPIH 3.6%”)**  
- **What it provides (facts + opinions):** Mentions “latest CPIH 3.6%” (likely contemporaneous to the release) plus card-spend trends; economist commentary that inflation may fall and rates may ease (opinion).  
- **Quality:** Moderate. Useful only as corroboration that late‑2025/early‑2026 CPIH was mid‑3%s; not a resolution source.  
- **Date:** Appears to reference Jan reporting; not essential for 2025 annual figure.

4) **Crossland Employment Solicitors blog (May 2025 inflation)**  
- **What it provides (facts, secondhand):** Reports May 2025 CPIH 4.0% and notes ONS correction to April 2025 (+/‑0.1pp issue).  
- **Quality:** Low-to-moderate. It’s derivative (not ONS), but plausibly accurate. Only useful as a cross-check that mid‑2025 CPIH was ~4%.  
- **Date:** May 2025.

5) **Statista / ElectroIQ summaries**  
- **What they provide:** Mix of (a) compilations, (b) projections, (c) non-ONS tables; may quote CPI/CPIH but are not the resolution authority.  
- **Quality:** Low-to-moderate. Useful only for broad context; not needed given ONS.

6) **AskNews political articles (2025-2026)**  
- **What they provide:** UK political context (e.g., references to Liz Truss legacy, bond markets, Reform UK, etc.). Inflation mentions (e.g., “3.8%”) are incidental and not tied to CPIH annual-2025 definition.  
- **Quality:** Low for this question. Mostly irrelevant to the 2025 calendar-year CPIH statistic, which is already realized and measured by ONS.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (drives most of the forecast):**
- **ONS monthly CPIH 12‑month rates throughout 2025** (Dec bulletin and earlier bulletins): these anchor what the 2025 year “looked like” (roughly mid‑3s to low‑4s).  
  *Why strong:* official, direct measure of the underlying series that determines the annual 2025 result.

**Moderate evidence (matters mainly for “definition risk” and small adjustments):**
- **ONS correction note (vehicle excise duty data error in April 2025, ~0.1pp)** as mentioned in the solicitor blog and consistent with typical ONS revisions.  
  *Why moderate:* could slightly change an annual calculation, but effects are small.

**Weak evidence (minimal impact):**
- Barclays/Statista/ElectroIQ and political news: mostly corroborative color; not resolution-defining.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Time left until resolution:** from **2026-02-13** to **2026-04-01** is ~**7 weeks**.  
- **Key point:** although resolution is in the future, **the quantity being resolved (calendar year 2025 CPIH annual inflation) is already determined**; remaining uncertainty is mostly *interpretation/operationalization* (e.g., annual average vs December y/y) and any minor ONS revisions.
- **If timeframe halved/doubled:** It wouldn’t change the “true” 2025 value; it only affects the chance that Metaculus resolves using a different ONS line item/definition than expected (definition risk declines slightly as more annual-summary releases become clearly accessible).

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustments vs outside view)

**Outside view baseline given:** centered near **~3.9%**, with the main ambiguity: whether “annual inflation rate” means (i) **calendar-year average** (as the prompt’s 2021 example suggests) or (ii) **December 12‑month rate** (3.6%).

**My inside-view adjustment:** keep the center near **~3.9%**, but widen modestly toward the downside to explicitly price **definition risk**:
- The question background explicitly cites **2021 = 2.49%** as the “annual inflation rate,” which strongly implies **calendar-year average CPIH inflation** (ONS “annual rate” style) rather than “December y/y.” That supports a median close to the **average of 2025 monthly y/y rates (~3.88%)**.
- However, because community resolution sometimes mistakenly uses the **December 12‑month rate** as “the year’s inflation,” I keep meaningful mass near **~3.6–3.7%**.

Overall: **Median ~3.9%**; tails mainly reflect *how it’s resolved* more than economic uncertainty.

Distribution calibration
- **Outside-view distribution (as provided):** P10 3.6, P20 3.7, P40 3.85, P60 3.95, P80 4.0, P90 4.1  
- **Inside-view changes:** Very small. I (i) keep the middle near 3.9, (ii) slightly widen upper tail (minor revision/averaging differences), (iii) keep lower tail accommodating “Dec y/y” interpretation.

Checklist:
1) **Target variable:** ONS **CPIH** annual inflation **for calendar year 2025**, %.  
2) **Outside view base distribution:** (3.6, 3.7, 3.85, 3.95, 4.0, 4.1).  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ **3.88–3.92**; mean ≈ **3.9**. Yes—matches 2025 monthly CPIH y/y levels and definition risk.  
4) **Key evidence (3–5):**
   - ONS shows **2025 CPIH y/y mostly 3.4–4.2**, ending **Dec 3.6**.  
   - Prompt example **2021=2.49%** implies **calendar-year average** concept.  
   - April 2025 ONS data error was only **~0.1pp** (small annual impact).  
5) **Blind spot:** Resolver uses **Dec 2025 y/y (3.6%)** instead of annual average → outcome lower.  
6) **Status quo:** With realized data, status quo is “mid‑to‑high 3%s” → small adjustments only.  
7) **Technicalities:** Strictly increasing percentiles; units %; within bounds.
