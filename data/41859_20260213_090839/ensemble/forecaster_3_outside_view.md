Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **ONS “Consumer price inflation, UK: December 2025” (ONS website; Dec 2025 release)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Official CPIH 12‑month inflation rate for **Dec 2025 = 3.6%**, plus the **monthly 12‑month CPIH rates across 2025** (roughly 3.4%–4.2%). Also breakdowns (food, housing, services, etc.).
- **Quality:** **Highest**. This is the *resolution authority* for the question (ONS).
- **Limits:** These are **12‑month rates by month**, not explicitly the **calendar-year 2025 annual inflation rate** (which is typically based on annual average indices). Still, it tightly constrains what the 2025 annual figure can be.

2) **ONS “Average weekly earnings” (Jan 2026 bulletin; refers to Sep–Nov 2025)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Wage growth (regular pay ~4.5% y/y) and “real pay growth” computed using CPIH/CPI.
- **Quality:** High for labour market facts, but **indirect** for the 2025 CPIH annual rate level.

3) **The Guardian (July 2022 leadership race article)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Timeline of leadership contest and candidates’ stated positions.
- **Quality:** Reputable journalism for political context, but **not informative** for the numeric 2025 CPIH outcome. Mostly irrelevant for an outside-view estimate of 2025 inflation.

4) **YCharts CPIH inflation rate table (cites ONS)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Repeats the same **monthly 2025 CPIH 12‑month rates** and notes long-run averages.
- **Quality:** Medium. Useful convenience copy of ONS series, but secondary.

5) **BLS CPI page (US CPI)**
- **Relevance:** **Not relevant** (different country, different index). Ignore for forecasting UK CPIH.

6) **Statista CPIH page (redacted values)**
- **What it provides:** Narrative trend, but with key numbers obscured.
- **Quality:** Low-to-medium here due to missing values; not needed given ONS availability.

7) **MoneyWeek “interest rates fall in 2026” (metadata/date inconsistencies)**
- **What it provides:** Claims about BoE rate path and inflation expectations, but the datedness looks inconsistent.
- **Quality:** Medium-low because of apparent publication-date mismatch; also not directly about the 2025 annual CPIH statistic.

8) **Morningstar (Jan/Feb 2026)**
- **What it provides (opinions by identifiable analysts + consensus):** FactSet consensus on CPI (not CPIH) around Dec 2025; BoE expectation of inflation returning to target in 2026; discussion of risks (tariffs/oil).
- **Quality:** Medium-high for *market consensus framing*; still indirect for the 2025 calendar-year CPIH annual rate.

9) **Agent report (summarising OBR/BoE/IMF projections from late 2022, plus some computed historical CPIH averages)**
- **What it provides:**
  - **Facts (if accurately quoted):** Contemporary (Nov 2022) OBR/BoE/IMF *forecasts* that implied very low inflation by 2025 (near 0% to ~2%).
  - **Opinions/interpretation:** Narrative attributing forecast features to the Energy Price Guarantee, gilt-yield shock, etc.
  - **Also claims (needs verification):** It states 2022–2024 calendar-year CPIH averages and that “full-year 2025 average is roughly 3.9%” based on monthly data.
- **Quality:** Mixed. Helpful synthesis, but some numbers are “computed”/secondary and should be treated cautiously versus ONS primary releases. Still, it points to the crucial empirical reality: **by late 2025, CPIH is ~3½–4%**, far above what 2022-era forecasters expected.

10) **FRED CPI index series (UK CPI, not CPIH; quarterly index)**
- **What it provides (facts):** An index level series and implied y/y changes (~3.7% at 2025Q1 for that CPI measure).
- **Quality:** High as a databank, but **not the correct target series** (CPIH annual inflation rate), so only loosely supportive.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view baselines)

We want an **outside view** for **UK CPIH annual inflation in calendar year 2025**, conditional on “Truss wins leadership” (which, historically, did occur—but for outside view we mostly treat politics as a weak predictor of a single-year inflation print compared with energy prices, monetary policy, and global supply factors).

Plausible reference classes:

1) **UK CPIH annual inflation over long periods (e.g., 2010–2019)**
- Typical: ~1–3%.
- **Problem:** Not suitable because 2025 is in a post‑pandemic/post‑energy‑shock regime with higher persistence.

2) **Post-shock disinflation years following a spike (UK 2022–2024 as “cooling-off” years)**
- We have (from the agent report) calendar-year CPIH averages: **2022 ~7.9, 2023 ~7.2, 2024 ~3.6**.
- This is a better regime match for 2025: the question is essentially “does inflation settle near 2% or stick around ~3–4%?”

3) **Within‑year (2025) monthly 12‑month CPIH rates as a constraint on the annual statistic**
- ONS shows 2025 monthly y/y CPIH mostly **3.4%–4.2%**.
- This is the **most suitable practical reference class** for predicting the annual 2025 value, because the annual statistic is mechanically linked to the index path that generates those monthly rates.

**Chosen reference class (best):** The **ONS 2025 monthly CPIH 12‑month rates** (plus the immediate prior-year annual context: 2024 ~3.6). This anchors the annual 2025 inflation rate strongly in the high‑3% range.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecasting horizon to resolution:** From **2026‑02‑13** to **2026‑04‑01** is ~**1.5 months**.
- **But the target period (calendar year 2025) is already in the past**, and ONS has already published at least through **Dec 2025** CPIH 12‑month rates.
- Therefore uncertainty is not “economic future uncertainty”; it’s mostly:
  1) **Definition/measurement:** annual CPIH inflation is an annual-average concept, not simply “December y/y”.
  2) **Data availability in prompt:** we don’t see the exact ONS calendar-year 2025 annual CPIH figure printed in the provided excerpt.

Historically, when you have the full set of monthly y/y rates for a year, the annual-average inflation rate will be close to the “center of mass” of those monthly rates—rarely far outside the year’s min/max unless the index level changes are extremely non-uniform. Here the monthly y/y range is narrow (about 0.8 pp), suggesting the annual number is fairly tightly constrained.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Mechanical anchoring from ONS 2025 monthly CPIH path**
- ONS reports 2025 monthly 12‑month CPIH inflation rates:
  - Low-ish months: **~3.4% (Mar 2025)**
  - High-ish months: **~4.2% (Jul 2025)**
  - End-year: **3.5% (Nov), 3.6% (Dec)**
- With most months clustered near ~4%, the **calendar-year 2025 annual CPIH inflation rate** (annual-average index vs 2024 annual-average index) should plausibly land around **~3.7%–4.1%**, absent a definitional surprise.

**Base-rate check against the immediate past (regime)**
- If 2024 annual CPIH was ~3.6% (agent report; consistent with disinflation from 2023), then 2025 being modestly higher (ONS y/y in 2025 hovering around 3½–4¼) suggests **a small uptick or plateau**, not a return to 2% during 2025.

**Conditional on “Truss wins”**
- From an outside-view lens, leadership outcome is not a strong predictor of the exact 2025 CPIH annual print compared with energy, housing/rents, services inflation persistence, and BoE stance.
- Since we are not yet doing the inside-view policy attribution, the correct move is to weight the **observed 2025 inflation environment** far more than counterfactual politics.

Bottom line outside view: **Center the distribution near ~3.9%** for 2025 CPIH annual inflation, with modest uncertainty.

Outside view calibration:

- I’m targeting a distribution that reflects **(i)** strong constraint from observed 2025 monthly y/y CPIH (~3.4–4.2), but also **(ii)** some slack for:
  - annual-average vs end-period differences,
  - possible small wedge between CPI and CPIH dynamics,
  - the general rate of “statistical/definition surprises” (usually small, but not zero).
- Given the relatively narrow within-year band and the year being complete, I’ll keep the 10–90 band **moderately wide** (about ~1.5 pp) rather than extremely tight, but not so wide as to ignore the strong ONS constraints.

Outside View Prediction (CPIH annual inflation rate for calendar year 2025, %):
Percentile 10: 3.1  
Percentile 20: 3.4  
Percentile 40: 3.7  
Percentile 60: 4.0  
Percentile 80: 4.3  
Percentile 90: 4.6
