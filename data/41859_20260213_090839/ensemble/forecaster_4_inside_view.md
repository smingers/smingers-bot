Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ONS CPIH Dec-2025 bulletin (20 Jan 2026 release). Primary data source for resolution; gives every 2025 monthly 12-month CPIH rate (3.4–4.2 %). Highest quality, purely factual.  
2. ONS CPIH Oct-2025 bulletin (20 Nov 2025). Corroborates monthly path earlier in year. High quality.  
3. ONS May-2025 correction note. Confirms 2025 figures; high quality.  
4. ONS Average-earnings Jan 2026 bulletin. Indirect signal that inflation stayed mid-3 %s; medium quality for our purpose.  
5. Barclays consumer-spending release (Feb 2026). Private dataset, shows CPIH 3.6 % in Jan 2026, consistent with ONS; moderate support.  
6. Statista and Electro-IQ articles give the same 3.8–4.2 % 2025 figures; secondary compilations, medium quality.  
Later political pieces (AskNews) contain opinions, no new inflation data → ignored for quantitative forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• ONS monthly CPIH 12-month rates for all of 2025 (independent official releases, identical trend).  
Moderate evidence:  
• Barclays 3.6 % Jan-2026 headline confirms end-2025 level.  
• Statista / Electro-IQ repeat ONS numbers.  
Weak evidence:  
• Wage and retail anecdotes; political commentary.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution = 47 days.  Final calendar-year CPIH for 2025 will be published by ONS (likely 21 Feb 2026).  Uncertainty therefore almost entirely statistical/definition rather than future macro movement.  If timeframe were halved, uncertainty would shrink slightly as publication nears; doubled, essentially no change—data already fixed.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base (built from the 12 monthly y/y rates): mean ≈3.85 %, central 80 % band 3.3–4.4 %.  
Inside-view refinement:  
• Mechanical relationship between monthly y/y path and annual-average index: with the 2025 index pattern reconstructed from ONS level data, the implied calendar-year rate is 3.8 – 3.9 %.  
• The April data correction lowered April by 0.1 pp; impact on the calendar year ≈ -0.008 pp – negligible.  
• No further revisions announced by ONS; historical revision magnitude <0.1 pp.  
=> distribution tightened a little (tails trimmed) but still allows low-probability data-revision surprises.

Distribution calibration
Percentiles (CPIH, calendar-year 2025, %):
10th: 3.2 – allows a sizeable downward revision scenario.  
20th: 3.5  
40th: 3.8  
60th: 4.0  
80th: 4.2  
90th: 4.5 – covers improbable upward revision beyond any monthly print.

Checklist:
1. Target: UK CPIH annual inflation rate for 2025, % (Liz Truss win assumed).  
2. Outside-view distribution above; final forecast anchored to it.  
3. Implied median ≈3.9 %, mean ≈3.9 %; aligns with evidence and reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) ONS monthly CPIH 2025 (3.4–4.2 %); (ii) ONS Dec-2025 CPIH = 3.6 %; (iii) negligible historical revision size; (iv) April 2025 0.1 pp correction.  
5. Blind-spot: ONS methodological re-base unexpectedly subtracts >0.4 pp → outcome <3 %.  
6. Status-quo (mid-3 %s) already matches central estimate; small mean-reversion bias included.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units %, within open bounds (-5, 20).
