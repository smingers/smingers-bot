Analysis:
a.  Source analysis  
•  ONS December-2025 CPIH bulletin (two identical summaries): High-quality official data; purely factual monthly and annual CPIH readings.  No forward-looking statements.  Publication date Jan 2026 but data cover Jan–Dec 2025 → useful to benchmark historical vol but not to build an ex-ante base rate.  
•  ONS January-2026 Average Weekly Earnings: High-quality official labour-market data; backward-looking; tangential to CPI but shows wage pressure.  
•  Guardian 11 Jul 2022 article on leadership timetable: Good for contemporaneous political context; not an economic forecast.  
•  Statista page & Y-Charts table: Both re-publish ONS figures; factual but secondary sources.  
•  Morningstar & MoneyWeek (2026 pieces): Journalistic commentary citing BoE projections; give flavour of expert expectations in early-2026, not relevant for an outside view set in 2022.  
•  Agent report (consolidated after Truss “mini-budget”): Carefully referenced extracts from OBR Nov-2022 EFO, BoE Nov-2022 MPR and IMF Oct-2022 WEO.  These are the only genuine forecasts of 2025 inflation that were produced immediately after Liz Truss took office and therefore are the best guide to a contemporaneous “outside view”.  The report distinguishes facts (published tables) from interpretation and cites identifiable expert bodies.  Very useful.  
•  FRED CPI quarterly series: Long historical index; high-quality factual data—good for estimating long-run volatility.

b.  Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes considered:  
1.  Calendar-year UK CPIH five years after a large energy-price shock (e.g., post-1973, post-1990, post-2008).  
2.  UK CPIH in “normal” non-shock years since Bank of England independence (1998–2019).  
3.  Published official forecasts made immediately after a change of government with a big fiscal loosening (OBR, BoE, IMF November/October 2022).  

Class 1 is too small (n≈3) and events were pre-inflation-target era.  
Class 2 (mean 1.8 %, sd 0.8 %) ignores the 2022 commodity spike that was still influencing expectations.  
Class 3 is tailor-made: it reflects (i) the macro environment in late-2022, (ii) incorporates the Truss fiscal package and the Energy Price Guarantee, and (iii) is produced by institutions whose forecasting record for one-to-three-year horizons is measurably better than ad-hoc pundits.  I therefore adopt Class 3 as the central reference class and use Classes 1 & 2 to widen tails.

c.  Time-frame analysis  
We are forecasting the calendar-year 2025 CPIH rate from a start-point of September 2022 → horizon ≈ 3¼ years (about 1 200 days).  Historical root-mean-square forecast error (RMSE) for BoE/OBR CPI at three-year horizon is roughly 1½ ppt.  Unexpected shocks (COVID-19, Ukraine war) show tail risk ≥ 3 ppt.

d.  Justification  
Base-rate (median) from reference forecasts:  
•  OBR 0.3 %  
•  BoE ≈ 0 %  
•  IMF 1.8 %  
Simple equal-weight average → 0.7 %.  CPIH normally runs ≈ 0.2 ppt below CPI, nudging the median to 0.5 %.  

Adjustments:  
+ 0.3 ppt for possible under-estimation of persistence in domestic services inflation (wage growth > 4 %, as 2022 data already showed).  
+ 0.2 ppt because EPG was scheduled to expire April 2024, so 2025 energy bills might be higher than in the models.  
– 0.1 ppt for likely monetary tightening: gilt-yield spike priced Bank Rate > 5 %, which would lean against inflation by 2025.  

Resulting adjusted median ≈ 0.9 %.  

Uncertainty:  
•  Symmetric macro forecast error σ ≈ 1½ ppt (BoE back-tests).  
•  Add fat tails for energy/FX shock (+3 ppt) and for global recession (-2 ppt).  

I therefore construct a wide but centred distribution:

Outside view calibration:
Anchor the CDF to N(0.9 %, 1.5 %²) for the inner 60 % of probability, then bleed additional weight into the tails to reflect 10 % combined probability of extreme shocks.  That produces the following rounded percentiles (monotonic, %, CPIH):

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: -0.5  
Percentile 20: 0.0  
Percentile 40: 0.8  
Percentile 60: 1.5  
Percentile 80: 2.5  
Percentile 90: 4.0
