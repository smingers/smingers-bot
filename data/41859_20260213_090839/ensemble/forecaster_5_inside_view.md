Analysis:
1. Source analysis
   a. ONS Consumer Price Inflation bulletins (Jan-Dec 2025). Primary, official statistics. Pure fact; highest weight.  
   b. Barclays consumer-spending note (Jan 2025). Uses ONS CPIH (3.6 %) and card-transaction data. Reliable but secondary.  
   c. Statista & Electro IQ compilations. Repackage ONS figures; no new data. Moderate quality.  
   d. Press articles (2025–26) on UK politics/bond markets. Opinion and context; negligible for 2025 CPIH level.  

2. Evidence analysis
   • Strong: Monthly ONS CPIH 12-month rates for every month of 2025 (Jan 3.9 % … Dec 3.6 %).  
   • Moderate: Barclays chief economist expects “inflation to fall quickly in coming months” – confirms late-year easing.  
   • Weak: Political commentary linking inflation to Truss legacy – causation unproven; ignored for numeric estimate.

3. Time-frame analysis
   Outcome will be fixed once ONS publishes the calendar-year figure (normally in the February 2026 CPI dataset), i.e. ≈3 weeks from today.  If the horizon were halved we would already know the answer; if doubled uncertainty would shrink only marginally because the 2025 monthly path is already observed.

4. Justification / inside-view shift
   Outside view (established earlier) median 3 %,  central 50 % band 2-4 %.  
   Inside view: we now possess the full set of monthly 12-month rates for 2025.  The calendar-year average of those twelve numbers is 3.88 %.  Revisions between provisional and final CPIH are historically ≤ 0.05 pp.  Therefore:

   • Up-shift the whole distribution by +0.9 pp.  (Strong evidence)  
   • Narrow the spread because 11/12 of the input data are already final and the December figure is published: shrink 80 % interval from 3 pp to 1.4 pp.  
   • Leave light tails for an extreme revision or methodology change (never happened but conceivable).

Distribution calibration
Base-rate (mean 2.3 %, σ 2.1 %) → after adjustments:  
10th ≈ 3.2 %  
20th ≈ 3.5 %  
40th ≈ 3.7 %  
60th ≈ 3.9 %  
80th ≈ 4.2 %  
90th ≈ 4.6 %

Checklist:
1. Target: calendar-year 2025 CPIH annual inflation rate, %, published by ONS.  
2. Outside view anchored; inside view uses observed monthly data.  
3. Implied median = 3.9 %, mean ≈ 3.9 % – consistent with arithmetic average.  
4. Key evidence: (i) ONS monthly CPIH series; (ii) negligible historical revision size; (iii) arithmetic shows 3.88 %; (iv) no planed methodology change.  
5. Blind-spot: Major retrospective re-benchmarking of owner-occupier housing costs could add ≥0.3 pp (push outcome up or down).  
6. Status-quo gently falling inflation already embedded in data, nudging toward 3.9 %.  
7. Percentiles rising, within open bounds, units %.
