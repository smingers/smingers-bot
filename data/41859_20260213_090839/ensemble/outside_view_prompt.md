The United Kingdom is experiencing a cost-of-living-crisis, which the Office of National Statistics [primarily attributes](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/latest#notable-movements-in-prices) to increases in the prices of motor fuels and food.  Motor fuel prices increased by 42% in June 2022 compared to 12 months prior, and food and non-alcoholic beverages prices increased by 10% in the same period, according to [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/latest#notable-movements-in-prices). With growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) at 4.3% from [March to May 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/latest#main-points-for-march-to-may-2022), many Britons are struggling with expenses.

The ongoing Conservative Party leadership election will determine the next leader of the Conservative Party and therefore the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Only two candidates are left: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. Results are expected by [September 5, 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/11/britain-new-pm-5-september-tory-leadership-rules-announced).

# Summary of ONS Article: Average Weekly Earnings in Great Britain (January 2026)

## Key Statistics and Facts

- Annual growth in regular earnings (excluding bonuses): 4.5%
- Annual growth in total earnings (including bonuses): 4.7%

**Real Earnings Growth (adjusted for CPIH inflation):**
- Real regular pay growth: 0.6%
- Real total pay growth: 0.8%

**Real Earnings Growth (adjusted for CPI inflation):**
- Real regular pay growth: 0.9%

**Inflation Rate:**
- CPIH (Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs) averaged 3.8% for September to November 2025

- Private sector annual regular earnings growth: 3.6%
- Public sector annual total earnings growth: 7.8%

**Industry-Specific Growth:**
- Wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants sector: 5.1% regular annual growth (strongest after public sector)
- Finance and business services sector: 2.2% regular annual growth (lowest)

## Methodological Notes

- Data comes from the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS), sampling around 9,000 employers covering approximately 12.8 million employees in Great Britain
- Survey response rate for November 2025: 88.5%
- AWE is calculated as the ratio of estimated total pay for the whole economy divided by total number of employees
- AWE does not adjust for compositional changes in the workforce (e.g., full-time vs. part-time workers)

## Relevant Context

The article notes that an error was identified in inflation measures for April 2025 related to Vehicle Excise Duty, which overstated transport figures and some higher-level aggregates. This error was not revised per established policies but would have minimal impact on real measures of earnings for April 2025.

# Summary of Article: "Will UK interest rates fall in 2026? Latest Bank of England predictions"

**Source:** MoneyWeek  
**Date:** April 21, 2023  
**Author:** Daniel Hilton

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Current Interest Rate:** Bank of England held rates at 3.75% at its February 2026 meeting (following a December 2025 cut)
- **MPC Vote Split:** 5 members voted to hold, 4 voted to cut by 25 basis points - a narrow margin
- **Inflation Data:** 
  - December 2025 inflation: 3.4% (0.2 percentage points higher than November)
  - Bank of England target: 2%
  - Forecast: Expected to reach 2% target by early 2027
- **Labour Market:**
  - Unemployment: 5.1% (three months to November) - highest since January 2021
  - Regular wage growth: 4.5% (same period)
- **GDP Growth:** 0.3% in three months to November
- **Rate Cut History:** Six cuts since August 2024, each by 25 basis points, bringing rates down from 5.25% to 3.75%

## Named Source Opinions:

**Andrew Bailey (Bank of England Governor):**
- "The risks from inflation persistence appear to have continued to reduce. I therefore see scope for some further easing of policy"
- "This does not mean that I expect to cut Bank Rate at any particular meeting. I will go into the coming meetings asking whether a cut is justified"

**Laith Khalaf (Head of Investment Analysis, AJ Bell):**
- "In short, it looks like a rate cut is now a question of when, not if"
- Described the result as "a far more dovish result than was expected"

**Sanjay Raja (Chief UK Economist, Deutsche Bank Research):**
- "[February's] decision was a closer decision than we anticipated"
- "Many on the MPC still see Bank Rate as overly restrictive amidst the current economic conjecture"
- **Deutsche Bank Forecast:** Two rate cuts in 2026 (March and June), bringing bank rate to 3.25%

## Key Context:

- MPC minutes stated: "On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call"
- Economists note the bank rate is approaching R* (neutral rate), meaning more caution needed to avoid accidentally encouraging inflation
- Most forecasters believe December's inflation rise will be short-lived

Query: Find reports or analyses discussing how Liz Truss's 2022 “mini-budget” and subsequent fiscal plans would affect the UK’s medium-term inflation outlook through 2025, citing OBR, IMF, BoE projections and giving numeric CPI/CPIH estimates; also retrieve historical CPIH data series for context.
Below is a consolidation of what the main official forecasters said, immediately after Liz Truss’s September 2022 “mini-budget”, about the path of UK inflation to (and through) 2025, together with the most recent historical CPIH data that will be used to verify the Metaculus question at resolution.

1.  What the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) assumed in its November 2022 Economic and Fiscal Outlook  
   •  Peak and subsequent path.  The OBR estimated CPI inflation would peak at 11.1 % in 2022 Q4 and then “decline before finally stabilising around the 2 % target in 2027” (Traderemedies.blog.gov.uk, 8 Dec 2022).  
   •  Calendar-year averages in the OBR’s published Table 1.1 (November 2022 EFO) – reproduced in many summaries – were:  
        2022 = 9.1 %, 2023 = 7.4 %, 2024 = 0.6 %, 2025 = 0.3 %.   
   •  Explanation of the mini-budget impact.  The OBR said the late-September fiscal package implied a net fiscal loosening of around 0.9 % of GDP in 2023-24.^1  Relative to the OBR’s March 2022 forecast, that extra demand added roughly 0.3 percentage points to CPI in 2023-24, but the temporary Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) simultaneously cut the headline rate by about 2½ ppts at its peak, so the near-term effect was disinflationary, while medium-term inflation (2025-26) was projected to sit just above zero before rising back to target.

2.  What the Bank of England (BoE) said in its November 2022 Monetary Policy Report  
   •  Conditioned on market expectations that Bank Rate would rise to 5¼ %, the BoE central projection had CPI “fall sharply from the middle of next year … CPI inflation is projected to be around 1 % in 2024 Q4 and – on headline definitions – turn slightly negative for a period during 2025 before returning to 2 % in 2026” (Bankofengland.co.uk, Monetary Policy Report, Nov 2022, Chart 1.1 discussion).  
   •  The MPC explicitly noted that the EPG lowered the headline path in 2023 but, because it raised households’ real incomes, “support could augment inflationary pressures in non-energy goods and services” later on (ibid.).  Hence, compared with the BoE’s August projections (pre-mini-budget), medium-term inflation was fractionally higher.

3.  What the IMF projected immediately after the Truss episode  
   •  October 2022 World Economic Outlook (baseline incorporating policies announced up to 30 Sept 2022) put UK CPI inflation at an annual-average 9.0 % (2022), 9.0 % (2023), 2.6 % (2024) and 1.8 % (2025).  
   •  The subsequent 2023 Article IV mission (May 2023) said that, under the policies in place after the mini-budget reversal, “inflation will ‘substantially’ reduce to around 5 % by end-2023 and return close to target by 2025” (GOV.UK, 23 May 2023 press conference).

4.  Quantifying 2025 under the three forecasters  
   •  OBR: CPI ≈ 0.3 % y/y calendar average; CPIH was not separately published, but historically the CPIH rate averages about 0.2 ppts below CPI, implying CPIH around 0.1 %.  
   •  BoE: headline CPI slightly negative mid-2025 and “a little below 0 % on average for the year”, so CPIH likewise near 0 %.  
   •  IMF: CPI ≈ 1.8 % for 2025; applying the CPI-CPIH wedge gives CPIH ≈ 1.6 %.  
   The spread therefore ran from roughly 0 % (BoE/OBR) to just under 2 % (IMF), with all three expecting inflation back at – or below – target by 2026.

5.  How the mini-budget itself altered those numbers  
   •  Near-term (2022-23): lower because of the EPG cap on energy bills (-2½ ppts according to the OBR).  
   •  Medium-term (2024-25): marginally higher than pre-mini-budget because the unfunded tax cuts and energy support were stimulative, but the effect was small (≈ +0.3 ppts on CPI according to the OBR).  
   •  Market reaction fed directly into the BoE’s forecasts: the spike in gilt yields raised the assumed Bank Rate path by c.2¼ ppts, which in turn subtracted demand and offset some of the fiscal stimulus.  Hence the very low BoE projection for 2025 was, paradoxically, partly the consequence of the market turbulence triggered by the mini-budget itself.

6.  Latest out-turns to put the forecasts in context  
   •  ONS CPIH 12-month rates (calendar-year averages, %):  
        2016 = 0.7, 2017 = 2.6, 2018 = 2.2, 2019 = 1.8, 2020 = 0.8, 2021 = 2.5 (given in Metaculus prompt), 2022 = 7.9 ^2, 2023 = 7.2 ^2, 2024 = 3.6 ^2.  
   •  December 2025 release shows a 12-month CPIH rate of 3.6 % (Ons.gov.uk, “Consumer Price Inflation, December 2025”).  Full-year 2025 average is running at roughly 3.9 % on the provisional monthly data – noticeably higher than the 2022-era forecasts, reflecting the fact that the EPG was scaled back and underlying services inflation proved stickier than envisaged.

7.  Key take-aways for forecasters on Metaculus  
   •  The contemporaneous official projections made immediately after the Truss/Kwarteng fiscal package thought inflation would all but disappear by 2025, with the OBR/BoE clustered around 0 % and the IMF at c.2 %.  
   •  Those forecasts already embedded the mini-budget’s tax cuts and the large energy subsidy.  They judged the EPG to push inflation down in the near term but, via stronger demand, up slightly in 2024-25 – though the tightening in financial conditions that followed the gilt sell-off more than neutralised that.  
   •  Subsequent policy reversals (most of the tax cuts were cancelled on 17 Oct 2022 and the EPG was curtailed) and bigger-than-expected persistence in wage-core inflation dynamics mean that, as of the December 2025 ONS data-set, CPIH is running materially above what all three institutions had pencilled in.  That empirical miss should temper confidence in using those November 2022 numbers mechanically; nevertheless they remain the best published, policy-consistent estimates of the “Truss-era” medium-term outlook.

Remaining information gaps
•  A single document that explicitly decomposes by how many percentage points the September 2022 Growth Plan (mini-budget) raised the BoE’s 2025 inflation projection would tighten the attribution.  The BoE MPR only states directionally that fiscal policy “supports demand relative to August”.  
•  The exact CPIH numbers in the IMF and OBR forecast tables are not published in headline summaries; full reports would need to be consulted for the CPIH split if required for absolute precision.

Overall, however, the available material does allow us to answer the Metaculus sub-question: at the time Liz Truss assumed office, the consensus of official forecasters was for UK CPIH in calendar-year 2025 to sit somewhere around 0 %-2 %, with most weight on a number close to zero.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
