Motor fuel prices increased by 42% in June 2022 compared to 12 months prior, and food and non-alcoholic beverages prices increased by 10% in the same period, according to [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/latest#notable-movements-in-prices). With growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) at 4.3% from [March to May 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/latest#main-points-for-march-to-may-2022), many Britons are struggling with expenses.\n\nThe ongoing Conservative Party leadership election will determine the next leader of the Conservative Party and therefore the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Only two candidates are left: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss.
