Analysis:
We already know Liz Truss did become Conservative leader/PM in September 2022, so the condition is satisfied. Because today is 13 Feb 2026, the Office for National Statistics should have published a January 2026 CPI release that includes the full-year (calendar-year) CPIH inflation figure for 2025. Locating that figure—plus any press or analytical coverage confirming it—is the key piece of information. Therefore the most useful sources are:  
• The ONS CPIH bulletin and accompanying datasets (likely published mid-January 2026).  
• News articles from early 2026 summarising “UK inflation in 2025” or “annual CPIH 2025” figures.  

The queries below focus on finding:  
1) The official ONS release/dataset.  
2) News coverage announcing the 2025 CPIH rate.  
3) A direct AskNews request for the precise CPIH annual rate.
