The United Kingdom is experiencing a cost-of-living-crisis, which the Office of National Statistics [primarily attributes](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/latest#notable-movements-in-prices) to increases in the prices of motor fuels and food.  Motor fuel prices increased by 42% in June 2022 compared to 12 months prior, and food and non-alcoholic beverages prices increased by 10% in the same period, according to [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/latest#notable-movements-in-prices). With growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) at 4.3% from [March to May 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/latest#main-points-for-march-to-may-2022), many Britons are struggling with expenses.
