Analysis:
To build an outside‐view for UK inflation in 2025 under a (hypothetical continued) Liz Truss premiership we need:  
• A long historical series of UK CPIH so we can quantify base rates and volatility.  
• Medium-term (2024-26) inflation forecasts from authoritative bodies produced after Truss’s mini-budget / Energy Price Guarantee announcements and any later revisions, because these incorporate assessments of how her fiscal stance would have influenced inflation had it persisted.  
• Commentary on the specific policy mix (large unfunded tax cuts, energy-bill cap, planned supply-side reforms) and its expected pass-through to prices—especially from the Bank of England, OBR, IMF, and ratings agencies.  
With those elements we can compare historical distributions with policy-conditioned forecasts to generate a probabilistic estimate for the 2025 CPIH rate.
