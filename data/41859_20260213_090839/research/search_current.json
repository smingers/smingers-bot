(2025)\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**View from The Hill: Sussan Ley leaves Angus Taylor his first hurdle, and it's a high one**\nAfter losing the Liberal Party leadership ballot to Angus Taylor with a 17-34 result, Sussan Ley announced her resignation from parliament, triggering a byelection in her New South Wales seat of Farrer. The seat, historically conservative and formerly held by Tim Fischer, is now contested by the Liberals, Nationals, One Nation, and independent candidate Michelle Milthorpe, a teacher who previously received support from Climate 200 and polled 44% in the last election. Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation has confirmed its entry into the race, intensifying competition. The Nationals, led by David Littleproud, aim to reclaim the seat, creating a potential Liberal-Nationals rivalry. Taylor\u2019s victory was facilitated by internal party discontent, with some of Ley\u2019s supporters defecting. His new leadership team includes Victorian Senator Jane Hume as deputy, providing gender and factional balance\u2014Hume is a moderate, countering Taylor\u2019s conservative stance. This balance aims to stabilize internal tensions and broaden appeal, especially to women voters, though the Liberals will have only five women in the House of Representatives after Ley\u2019s departure. Taylor\u2019s economic credentials are seen as an advantage amid high inflation (3.8%), rising interest rates, and public skepticism. He acknowledged past mistakes, particularly on personal income tax, and pledged a return to core values, stating, 'We're in this position because we stopped listening to Australians.' He has promised an upcoming immigration policy to appeal to the conservative base, but critics like Malcolm Turnbull warn that adopting a harder stance than One Nation is a losing strategy. Taylor lacks a clear roadmap for urban areas, where the Liberals face strong competition from Labor and the teals. While the leadership change signals a 'reset,' it does not resolve the party\u2019s deep structural and electoral challenges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 03:16 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-sussan-ley-leaves-angus-taylor-his-first-hurdle-and-its-a-high-one-275912)\n\n**'Change or die': Taylor topples Ley to take charge of embattled Liberals**\nAngus Taylor has defeated Sussan Ley in a leadership ballot on February 12, 2026, becoming the 17th leader of the federal Liberal Party following a 24-hour frontbench revolt that revealed deep internal divisions over the party's identity, direction, and electoral viability. The vote, which ended Ley\u2019s brief tenure as opposition leader and the first female federal leader of the party, passed by a margin of 34 to 17. The leadership spill, the first since 2018, followed months of destabilization and warnings that the Coalition faces an existential threat unless it rebuilds economic credibility and halts a mass voter exodus. Senator Jane Hume was elected deputy leader after a four-way contest. Ley, who had narrowly defeated Taylor in a post-election ballot nine months prior, announced her retirement from a 25-year parliamentary career after winning the Farrer seat in 2001 by 206 votes. Her retirement triggers a by-election in southwestern NSW, a key test of Taylor\u2019s leadership and the potential for One Nation to gain ground, as the party surged to 27% in recent Newspoll figures while the Coalition\u2019s primary vote fell to 18%. The revolt began with resignations from Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler and WA senator Matt O'Sullivan on Thursday morning, followed by multiple senior figures stepping down. Taylor\u2019s allies described the ballot as a 'change or die moment.' His immediate challenges include crafting an economic policy to regain voters and determining whether the party should lean further into cultural conservatism to counter One Nation\u2019s appeal. A review into the party\u2019s 2025 election loss is due by the end of March, providing an early test of Taylor\u2019s leadership. The speed of the coup\u2014from Taylor\u2019s resignation on Wednesday evening to his ascension on Friday morning\u2014underscores the volatility within the party. Senator James Paterson, who resigned to support Taylor, claimed the party was losing over 7,000 votes per day. Moderates warned against moving too far right, while conservatives criticized the opposition for lacking a clear economic narrative and differentiation from Labor.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 10:38 PM\nSource:[farmweekly.com.au](https://farmweekly.com.au/story/9174284/liberal-leader-decided-at-special-party-room-meeting/)\n\n**UK's Brexit Journey and Political Transitions from 2016 to 2024**\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum on its EU membership, with the 'Leave' option winning 51.9% of the vote, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron. Theresa May succeeded Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party and became the UK's second female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. In June 2017, the UK held a snap general election; May's Conservative Party remained the largest party but failed to secure a parliamentary majority. In November 2018, the UK government reached a Brexit agreement and a political declaration on future UK-EU relations with the EU, but both were rejected multiple times in the House of Commons, leading to May's resignation amid internal party pressure. Boris Johnson was elected Conservative Party leader in July 2019 and became Prime Minister. In December 2019, Johnson led the Conservatives to a decisive victory in a snap election, securing his reappointment as Prime Minister. On January 31, 2020, the UK officially left the EU, ending its 47-year membership, followed by an 11-month transition period. On December 24, 2020, the UK and EU announced the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into effect at 23:00 GMT on December 31, 2020 (00:00 CET on January 1, 2021), ensuring a smooth transition in UK-EU relations. In July 2022, Johnson resigned under party pressure. In September 2022, Elizabeth Truss was elected Conservative Party leader and became Prime Minister, but resigned in October. Rishi Sunak succeeded her as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. On July 4, 2024, the Labour Party won a decisive victory in the general election, with Keir Starmer becoming Prime Minister.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 06:06 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001902clm0.html)\n\n**Inside Farage's plans to put Reform on an 'election war footing'**\nNigel Farage declared that Reform UK is now on a 'general election war footing' during a rally at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre on February 12, 2026. He warned that political and economic crises\u2014such as a leadership change in the Labour Party leading to a shift to the hard left, capital flight, and loss of bond market confidence\u2014could trigger an early election, despite most analysts expecting the next general election by August 15, 2029. Farage emphasized readiness to win, citing opinion polls showing Reform UK ahead of both the Conservatives and Labour. To prepare, the party has opened a candidate portal with a \u00a3250 application fee (\u00a350 for Scottish Parliament and Senedd candidates), with over 1,000 applications reportedly received in under a week, potentially raising over \u00a3250,000. Farage is also assembling a prospective leadership team, with names for key policy spokespersons to be announced, including frontrunners for Chancellor: Richard Tice (Reform deputy leader, business background) and Robert Jenrick (former Conservative Cabinet minister, media-savvy). Suella Braverman and Sarah Pochin are also considered for key roles. The party is moving beyond being a 'one-man band,' with efforts to diversify leadership and talent, including non-parliamentarians and potential appointments to the House of Lords. Policy development is being led by Zia Yusuf, aiming for a 'plan for government' by early 2027. Despite skepticism about the immediacy of an early election, Farage's announcement signals a strategic push to professionalize Reform UK and demonstrate its readiness to govern, responding to scrutiny over its ability to lead. Gawain Towler, a Reform board member, stated the party is 'getting there' but not yet ready. The speech marked a shift toward structured, note-driven delivery, reflecting a broader strategic evolution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/farage-plans-reform-election-war-4226177)\n\n**Manchester United Owner Claims UK Is Being 'Colonized by Immigrants,' Sparking Political Firestorm**\nJim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United and founder of Ineos Group, sparked a national controversy in the UK by claiming the country is being 'colonized by immigrants.' UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the remarks as offensive and incorrect, stating that Britain is a proud, tolerant, and diverse nation and demanding an apology. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called the comments 'entirely wrong' and a violation of British values, urging immediate apology. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader John Swinney stated he strongly disagreed, emphasizing that immigration has brought benefits to both the UK and Scotland. Labour MP Alex Sobel described the remarks as a '\u717d\u52a8\u6027\u5984\u8a00' (seditious rant) from a detached billionaire, lacking empathy for ordinary people's struggles. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham criticized the statements as inaccurate, offensive, and incendiary, arguing they contradict Manchester's long-standing tradition of multicultural unity and calling for their withdrawal. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss supported Ratcliffe, stating he was right and urging business leaders to help revive the country, while also calling for the removal of incompetent senior officials. Reform Party leader Nigel Farage echoed the sentiment, noting unprecedented levels of immigration have transformed many UK regions, and his party would not ignore the issue. Immigration remains a top voter concern in the UK, a key driver behind the 2016 Brexit referendum. Despite this, net migration has risen in recent years, with illegal crossings surging\u2014official data from the UK Home Office on October 23, 2025, revealed nearly 37,000 undocumented migrants arrived via the English Channel, surpassing the 2024 total and marking the second-highest on record, behind only 2022.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 12:54 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8qgpostoyOp)\n\n**Ratcliffe apologises over 'UK colonised by immigrants' comment**\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United and founder of INEOS, issued an apology after making controversial remarks during an interview with Sky's Ed Conway, in which he stated that the UK had been 'colonised by immigrants.' In a formal statement, Ratcliffe expressed regret for the offensive language, clarifying that his intent was to emphasize the need for controlled, well-managed immigration that supports economic growth. He stressed the importance of balancing migration with investments in skills, industry, and employment to ensure long-term prosperity, and called for an open debate on the UK's challenges. His comments drew sharp criticism from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, all of whom demanded an apology. However, Ratcliffe also received support from former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss. The Football Association (FA) is now reviewing his remarks due to his role as co-owner of Manchester United. The incident occurred during the European Industry Summit in Antwerp and was published on February 12, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 12:20 PM\nSource:[Vanguard](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2026/02/ratcliffe-apologises-over-uk-colonised-by-immigrants-comment/)\n\n**Despite Crises and Pressure, Why Does Keir Starmer Remain in Power?**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces unprecedented political pressure following a series of scandals and crises that have damaged his public image. Despite calls for his resignation, including a notable one from Anas Sarwar, leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Starmer remains in power due to strong institutional support. The Cabinet has fully backed him, undermining any momentum for removal. Potential rivals are either legally disqualified\u2014such as Angela Rayner, under tax investigation, or Andy Burnham, who is not a Member of Parliament\u2014or unwilling to run. Labour MPs demonstrated strong support during a recent meeting, applauding him enthusiastically after a passionate speech. Financial markets also play a role: any leadership change is seen as a threat to economic stability, particularly bond markets. Labour leadership lessons from the Conservatives\u2019 rapid leadership turnovers\u2014such as those of Theresa May and Liz Truss\u2014have reinforced the party\u2019s caution against internal chaos. While Starmer\u2019s position is currently secure due to the absence of viable alternatives, lack of strong opposition, and economic concerns, his situation remains fragile. If public approval does not improve or if major government failures occur, his leadership could face renewed challenges.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6867962)\n\n**'Spending \u00a345 million on council tax reduction is simply not affordable for Bristol' | Bristol Live**\nBristol City Council is set to vote on its 2026-2027 budget on Thursday, 12 February, with the Green-led authority proposing a \u00a3634 million day-to-day budget, partially funded by a 4.99% council tax increase. Additional funding includes \u00a3232 million for long-term infrastructure, \u00a3180 million from rent on council homes, and \u00a3583 million from the government for education. The Conservative Party has submitted an amendment to reduce the Council Tax Reduction Scheme (CTRS) by \u00a345 million to fund frontline services, eliminate parking fees on the Downs and in district car parks, and support parks, community safety, and libraries. Critics argue that Bristol's current level of 100% council tax relief for eligible applicants is unsustainable, especially given forecasts from the Local Government Association that nearly half of councils may need financial bailouts and 80% could face bankruptcy by 2028/29 due to Special Educational Needs (SEND) deficits. Reader Jacksthelad04 states that spending \u00a345 million on CTRS is 'simply not affordable' for Bristol, noting that central government already funds council tax benefits for pensioners on pension credit. Other readers express skepticism about Conservative fiscal credibility, referencing the Liz Truss budget, a tripling of national debt, and a 60% cut in council funding. Some highlight the impact of austerity, Brexit\u2019s economic shrinkage, and the 40% central budget cut over 14 years. Others call for reinstating the two-child benefit cap, free waste collections, and removing charges for domestic refuse centres. One Facebook user supports scrapping the ULEZ, calling it a 'ridiculous rip off' for average families. The government has clarified it will lift the 5% council tax cap for authorities with fewer deprived wards, potentially leading to higher local taxes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 06:46 AM\nSource:[Bristol Post](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/news-opinion/spending-45-million-council-tax-10807865)\n\n**UK Bond Markets Driven by Global Forces, Not Westminster Drama**\nDespite the ongoing political drama in Westminster, UK government bond (gilts) movements are primarily driven by global factors rather than domestic political shifts. Although Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership faces internal challenges\u2014such as attempts by figures like Andy Burnham, Ed Miliband, and Angela Rayner to challenge him\u2014market analysts have observed only modest increases in gilt yields, suggesting limited immediate fiscal instability. The recent rise in bond yields over the past month is more closely linked to global developments, such as Sanae Takaichi\u2019s decisive electoral victory in Japan, which triggered synchronized yield increases across developed economies. A five-year analysis by Breakingviews shows that 57% of the cumulative change in UK 10-year gilt yields is explained by U.S. Treasury yields, reflecting coordinated global monetary policy, central bank actions, and international inflation trends. Fiscal risk, previously significant during Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 mini-budget crisis, has receded under Starmer\u2019s leadership. Domestic inflationary policies, such as Rachel Reeves\u2019 2025 Social Security contribution hike, have had minimal impact on long-term bonds. The second-largest driver of gilt movements is a residual 'other' category, likely including Bank of England bond sales, reduced demand from insurers, and broader investor disinterest in the UK post-Brexit. Ultimately, despite political attention on fiscal rules, UK borrowing costs have risen under Starmer due to external forces beyond his control.

According to the poll, 64% of respondents believed Badenoch would be a better premier compared to 36% for Farage, while Starmer narrowly led Farage with 51% to 49%. The poll also noted that the combined support for the two traditional main parties\u2014Labour and the Conservatives\u2014reached 44%, marking the highest such level since October 2025, according to More in Common UK director Luke Tryl. This result signals a slight recovery for the Conservative Party in recent polling. The findings were published on February 11, 2026, by the EXPRESS.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 02:04 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2169635/kemi-badenoch-po9ll-nigel-farage-keir-starmer)\n\n**Shift to Reform UK: When Conservatives Move Right**\nSuella Braverman, former UK Home Secretary (September 2022\u2013November 2023) under Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, has officially joined Reform UK, calling the move 'feeling like coming home.' She criticized the Conservative Party for failing to deliver on promises and for not changing despite its 2024 parliamentary election defeat. Braverman stated, 'The Conservative Party is dead,' and argued that the party cannot win while defending past policies. Her departure follows that of Nadhim Zahawi and Robert Jenrick, both former senior Conservative figures, who also joined Reform UK. The party has surged in popularity, with 26% of voters supporting it according to a mid-January 2026 YouGov poll\u2014surpassing the Conservatives (19%) and Labour (18%). Reform UK has gained strongest support among older, lower-income, and less-educated voters, particularly men. Nigel Farage, Reform UK\u2019s leader, welcomed the influx of experienced politicians, saying it dispels claims that the party is unprepared for government. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch responded with irony, joking that Farage now has 'the spring cleaning' to handle, indicating she no longer sees the departures as her responsibility.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 09:29 AM\nSource:[SRF News](https://www.srf.ch/news/international/wechsel-zur-reform-uk-wie-politische-gegner-ziemlich-beste-freunde-werden)\n\n**Storm Clouds Gather Over Starmer: Alleged Attempt to Oust UK Prime Minister**\nBritish media are closely monitoring developments surrounding Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with reports suggesting an internal attempt to remove him from office. The alleged plot is linked to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is considered a potential future party leader due to his effective government communication. Streeting denied any intention to overthrow Starmer, calling the reports 'absolutely meaningless' and accusing the source of being influenced by the reality show 'Celebrity Betrayals.' He emphasized that discussions about leadership challenges are 'doomed to fail and self-destructive.' The concerns stem from low approval ratings for the Labour Party less than 18 months after their decisive election victory. Labour lawmakers are particularly worried about polling data showing the party trailing the right-wing 'Reform UK' party led by Nigel Farage, despite leading the main opposition Conservative Party. Economic challenges include rising unemployment\u2014up to 5% in the last quarter, the highest since 2016\u2014and persistent inflation. The government faces pressure over its November 26 budget announcement, expected to include a rise in income tax, breaking a key election promise. Under Labour Party rules, a leadership challenge can be initiated if a candidate gains support from 20% of MPs (currently 81). The UK\u2019s parliamentary system allows a change in prime minister without early elections, though un-elected leaders face pressure to prove legitimacy through public mandate. This context echoes recent instability, with three Conservative prime ministers\u2014Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak\u2014serving between December 2019 and July 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/11/12/nad-starmerom-sgustilis-tuchi-zapodozrena-popytka-sverzheniya-britanskogo-premera.html)\n\n**Lettuce Liz Truss has backed the Greens as the next official opposition party - Daily Star**\nLettuce Liz Truss, the former UK Prime Minister and shortest-serving leader in British history (49 days in office), has publicly endorsed the Green Party as the likely next official opposition party. She praised the Greens for their 'certain kind of honesty' that she claims is absent in the Labour Party. Truss criticized Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, calling her a 'disingenuous liar' and accusing her of promoting a 'false narrative' about the economic fallout from Truss's mini-budget, which Reeves blamed for Britain's economic woes. Truss denied plans to join Reform UK, despite criticizing her former Conservative Party's record. She also accused Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of indecisiveness and claimed that Nigel Farage has occupied the political space that the Conservatives failed to define, posing an 'existential threat' to the party. Truss argued that the Conservatives have not yet confronted the reasons for their defeat after 14 years in power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 06:12 PM\nSource:[Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/lettuce-liz-truss-backed-greens-36122834)\n\n**UK Conservatives Under Kemi Badenoch Pursue Radical Economic and Policy Shift**\nThe Conservative Party in the UK, under leader Kemi Badenoch, is pursuing a radical economic and policy shift to regain public trust after a period of financial instability. Badenoch pledged that a future Conservative government would cut annual state spending by \u00a347 billion (\u20ac54 billion), with roughly half targeted at social welfare, aiming to reduce the deficit, stimulate economic growth, and lower taxes. This comes after the party's 2022 fiscal crisis under Liz Truss, which triggered a financial downturn and damaged its credibility. Despite this, public opinion still largely trusts the Conservatives to manage debt, cut taxes, and boost growth. The UK\u2019s financial situation remains fragile, with national debt at 100% of GDP and projected interest payments of \u00a3111 billion in the next fiscal year\u2014nearly 9% of total spending. While the incumbent Labour government also aims to reduce debt, it faces internal pressure to increase public spending, whereas Badenoch opposes this, advocating for the complete abolition of the stamp duty on property purchases. She also plans to repeal the 2019 legally binding climate neutrality target by 2050, arguing that expanding fossil fuel use and investing in new nuclear power are necessary to lower electricity prices. This reversal drew criticism from British chambers of commerce, warning it could deter investment. In immigration policy, Badenoch aligns with Reform UK by promising to deport 150,000 undocumented migrants annually\u2014potentially requiring the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. She refrained from direct confrontation with Nigel Farage, citing George Bernard Shaw: 'Never fight with a pig. You\u2019ll both get dirty, and the pig enjoys it.' Badenoch\u2019s strategy is expected to be tested in May 2026 regional elections in Wales, Scotland, and England. Analyst Maxwell Marlow of the Adam Smith Institute noted that while the Conservatives have not yet won, these radical plans signal a party committed to economic, social, and moral freedom. Whether Badenoch can revive the party depends on the outcome of the upcoming elections; a poor result could make her leadership in Manchester her final appearance.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/grossbritannien-britische-konservative-suchen-nach-neuem-profil/100159674.html)\n\n**Kemi Badenoch to give major speech as top Tory makes Liz Truss 'nonsense' claim**\nKemi Badenoch is set to deliver a major closing speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on October 8, 2025, focusing on the economy. She will introduce a 'golden rule' stating that half of all savings from government cuts must be used to reduce the deficit, while the other half would fund spending or tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. Badenoch is expected to criticize Chancellor Rachel Reeves' fiscal plans, claiming they will double the deficit over the next decade and calling them 'not sustainable' and 'not fair,' accusing them of 'stealing from our children and grandchildren.' The speech comes amid ongoing internal party dynamics, including denial of leadership challenges and controversy over Robert Jenrick\u2019s remarks on race and the judiciary. Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake dismissed claims that Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget continues to harm the economy, calling such concerns 'nonsense,' and defended Badenoch\u2019s leadership, stating she has 'backbone' and 'all the time she needs' to rebuild the party\u2019s poll ratings. Hollinrake also admitted the Conservatives were 'too soft' on welfare during their 14 years in power, arguing they failed to enforce 'tough love' and responsible behavior.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 08:31 AM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-speech-tory-live-36030459)\n\n**Kemi Badenoch to focus on economy in crunch leader's speech to Tory conference**\nKemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, delivered a closing speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on October 8, 2025, focusing on economic reform. She introduced a new 'golden economic rule' stating that half of all savings from government cuts must be used to reduce the deficit, while the other half would fund tax cuts or increased spending to stimulate the economy. This follows the party\u2019s pledge to cut \u00a347 billion by reducing welfare and shrinking the Civil Service. Badenoch criticized Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 economic plans, claiming they would double the deficit over 10 years, calling them 'not sustainable' and 'not fair,' and accusing them of 'stealing from our children and grandchildren.' She also proposed cutting student numbers by 100,000 annually\u2014capping all subject areas and gradually reducing enrollment in courses with poor graduate outcomes\u2014to save \u00a33 billion, which would be redirected to double the apprenticeship budget. Labour responded by demanding an apology for the economic turmoil caused by former Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget, calling Badenoch\u2019s stance 'brass neck' and accusing the Tories of having learned nothing. The Liberal Democrats dismissed the Conservatives\u2019 economic credibility, citing past failures in public finances and even mocking a misspelled slogan on chocolate bars distributed at the conference: 'When Labour negotiates, Britian loses.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 07:21 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/kemi-badenoch-focus-economy-crunch-072133017.html)\n\n**Kemi Badenoch wants us to trust the Tories on the economy. The problem? Liz Truss**\nAt the 2025 Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, only 250 attendees came to shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride\u2019s keynote speech, reflecting a lack of enthusiasm among party members. Despite Stride being positioned as the potential economic leader for a future Conservative government, there is little confidence in the party\u2019s ability to regain public trust. A key obstacle is the lingering shadow of former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose 2022 'mini-Budget' caused economic turmoil and whose recent statements\u2014such as claiming far-right activist Tommy Robinson was 'unfairly demonised'\u2014continue to damage the party\u2019s image. Although Kemi Badenoch, the current Conservative leader, has stated that Truss 'carries quite a lot of the blame' for Tory failures, she has not expelled her from the party, a move some MPs believe is necessary. The decision to expel Truss would require a formal complaint and a ruling by a disciplinary panel, which has not yet been discussed. Truss is absent from the conference, reportedly focusing on the international MAGA circuit instead. While Stride emphasized fiscal responsibility and pledged not to make uncosted tax commitments\u2014citing the 2022 crisis\u2014his plans include cutting civil service numbers to 2016 levels, scrapping business rates, and offering a \u00a35,000 national insurance rebate for first-time full-time workers. However, core elements of Truss\u2019s economic ideology\u2014such as the belief that tax cuts stimulate growth and skepticism toward the public sector\u2014remain central to mainstream Tory thinking. The party avoids naming Truss directly, treating her as a 'drunk uncle at Christmas'\u2014acknowledged but ignored. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer named Truss in his keynote but did not mention Badenoch, signaling that the Tories will not be taken seriously until their leader is recognized by the opposition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 06:25 PM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/kemi-badenoch-wants-us-to-trust-the-tories-on-the-economy-the-problem-liz-truss-3961579)\n\n**Robert Jenrick hits out at Liz Truss's 'careless' and 'un-conservative' mini-Budget**\nRobert Jenrick delivered a strong critique of Liz Truss's 2022 mini-Budget at the Conservative Party conference, calling it 'careless', 'cack-handed', and 'un-conservative', citing its role in spooking financial markets, triggering a spike in mortgage rates, and leading to Truss's resignation. Speaking in a packed room, Jenrick acknowledged past mistakes, stating that honesty about them is essential to rebuild public trust. He emphasized the party's commitment to 'fiscal responsibility', pledging to only cut taxes when affordable\u2014drawing a contrast with Truss\u2019s approach. Jenrick also unveiled plans to slash \u00a347 billion in government spending, abolish business rates for high street shops and pubs, and introduce a \u00a35,000 'first job bonus' for young people. Despite being seen as a potential rival to current leader Kemi Badenoch, Jenrick publicly dismissed leadership ambitions, affirming his support for her as the party\u2019s leader, stating, 'My expectation is that Kemi will lead the party into the next general election.' His remarks came amid low Conservative approval ratings and growing defections to Reform UK. The party\u2019s conference slogan\u2014'Stronger Economy, Stronger Borders'\u2014underscores its focus on economic credibility and migration control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-jenrick-liz-truss-mini-budget-tory-conference-b2840232.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
