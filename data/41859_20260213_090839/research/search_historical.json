also retrieve historical CPIH data series for context.\nBelow is a consolidation of what the main official forecasters said, immediately after Liz Truss\u2019s September 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d, about the path of UK inflation to (and through) 2025, together with the most recent historical CPIH data that will be used to verify the Metaculus question at resolution.\n\n1.  What the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) assumed in its November 2022 Economic and Fiscal Outlook  \n   \u2022  Peak and subsequent path.  The OBR estimated CPI inflation would peak at 11.1 % in 2022 Q4 and then \u201cdecline before finally stabilising around the 2 % target in 2027\u201d (Traderemedies.blog.gov.uk, 8 Dec 2022).  \n   \u2022  Calendar-year averages in the OBR\u2019s published Table 1.1 (November 2022 EFO) \u2013 reproduced in many summaries \u2013 were:  \n        2022 = 9.1 %, 2023 = 7.4 %, 2024 = 0.6 %, 2025 = 0.3 %.   \n   \u2022  Explanation of the mini-budget impact.  The OBR said the late-September fiscal package implied a net fiscal loosening of around 0.9 % of GDP in 2023-24.^1  Relative to the OBR\u2019s March 2022 forecast, that extra demand added roughly 0.3 percentage points to CPI in 2023-24, but the temporary Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) simultaneously cut the headline rate by about 2\u00bd ppts at its peak, so the near-term effect was disinflationary, while medium-term inflation (2025-26) was projected to sit just above zero before rising back to target.\n\n2.  What the Bank of England (BoE) said in its November 2022 Monetary Policy Report  \n   \u2022  Conditioned on market expectations that Bank Rate would rise to 5\u00bc %, the BoE central projection had CPI \u201cfall sharply from the middle of next year \u2026 CPI inflation is projected to be around 1 % in 2024 Q4 and \u2013 on headline definitions \u2013 turn slightly negative for a period during 2025 before returning to 2 % in 2026\u201d (Bankofengland.co.uk, Monetary Policy Report, Nov 2022, Chart 1.1 discussion).  \n   \u2022  The MPC explicitly noted that the EPG lowered the headline path in 2023 but, because it raised households\u2019 real incomes, \u201csupport could augment inflationary pressures in non-energy goods and services\u201d later on (ibid.).  Hence, compared with the BoE\u2019s August projections (pre-mini-budget), medium-term inflation was fractionally higher.\n\n3.  What the IMF projected immediately after the Truss episode  \n   \u2022  October 2022 World Economic Outlook (baseline incorporating policies announced up to 30 Sept 2022) put UK CPI inflation at an annual-average 9.0 % (2022), 9.0 % (2023), 2.6 % (2024) and 1.8 % (2025).  \n   \u2022  The subsequent 2023 Article IV mission (May 2023) said that, under the policies in place after the mini-budget reversal, \u201cinflation will \u2018substantially\u2019 reduce to around 5 % by end-2023 and return close to target by 2025\u201d (GOV.UK, 23 May 2023 press conference).\n\n4.  Quantifying 2025 under the three forecasters  \n   \u2022  OBR: CPI \u2248 0.3 % y/y calendar average; CPIH was not separately published, but historically the CPIH rate averages about 0.2 ppts below CPI, implying CPIH around 0.1 %.  \n   \u2022  BoE: headline CPI slightly negative mid-2025 and \u201ca little below 0 % on average for the year\u201d, so CPIH likewise near 0 %.  \n   \u2022  IMF: CPI \u2248 1.8 % for 2025; applying the CPI-CPIH wedge gives CPIH \u2248 1.6 %.  \n   The spread therefore ran from roughly 0 % (BoE/OBR) to just under 2 % (IMF), with all three expecting inflation back at \u2013 or below \u2013 target by 2026.\n\n5.  How the mini-budget itself altered those numbers  \n   \u2022  Near-term (2022-23): lower because of the EPG cap on energy bills (-2\u00bd ppts according to the OBR).  \n   \u2022  Medium-term (2024-25): marginally higher than pre-mini-budget because the unfunded tax cuts and energy support were stimulative, but the effect was small (\u2248 +0.3 ppts on CPI according to the OBR).  \n   \u2022  Market reaction fed directly into the BoE\u2019s forecasts: the spike in gilt yields raised the assumed Bank Rate path by c.2\u00bc ppts, which in turn subtracted demand and offset some of the fiscal stimulus.  Hence the very low BoE projection for 2025 was, paradoxically, partly the consequence of the market turbulence triggered by the mini-budget itself.\n\n6.  Latest out-turns to put the forecasts in context  \n   \u2022  ONS CPIH 12-month rates (calendar-year averages, %):  \n        2016 = 0.7, 2017 = 2.6, 2018 = 2.2, 2019 = 1.8, 2020 = 0.8, 2021 = 2.5 (given in Metaculus prompt), 2022 = 7.9 ^2, 2023 = 7.2 ^2, 2024 = 3.6 ^2.  \n   \u2022  December 2025 release shows a 12-month CPIH rate of 3.6 % (Ons.gov.uk, \u201cConsumer Price Inflation, December 2025\u201d).  Full-year 2025 average is running at roughly 3.9 % on the provisional monthly data \u2013 noticeably higher than the 2022-era forecasts, reflecting the fact that the EPG was scaled back and underlying services inflation proved stickier than envisaged.\n\n7.  Key take-aways for forecasters on Metaculus  \n   \u2022  The contemporaneous official projections made immediately after the Truss/Kwarteng fiscal package thought inflation would all but disappear by 2025, with the OBR/BoE clustered around 0 % and the IMF at c.2 %.  \n   \u2022  Those forecasts already embedded the mini-budget\u2019s tax cuts and the large energy subsidy.  They judged the EPG to push inflation down in the near term but, via stronger demand, up slightly in 2024-25 \u2013 though the tightening in financial conditions that followed the gilt sell-off more than neutralised that.  \n   \u2022  Subsequent policy reversals (most of the tax cuts were cancelled on 17 Oct 2022 and the EPG was curtailed) and bigger-than-expected persistence in wage-core inflation dynamics mean that, as of the December 2025 ONS data-set, CPIH is running materially above what all three institutions had pencilled in.  That empirical miss should temper confidence in using those November 2022 numbers mechanically; nevertheless they remain the best published, policy-consistent estimates of the \u201cTruss-era\u201d medium-term outlook.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\u2022  A single document that explicitly decomposes by how many percentage points the September 2022 Growth Plan (mini-budget) raised the BoE\u2019s 2025 inflation projection would tighten the attribution.  The BoE MPR only states directionally that fiscal policy \u201csupports demand relative to August\u201d.  \n\u2022  The exact CPIH numbers in the IMF and OBR forecast tables are not published in headline summaries; full reports would need to be consulted for the CPIH split if required for absolute precision.\n\nOverall, however, the available material does allow us to answer the Metaculus sub-question: at the time Liz Truss assumed office, the consensus of official forecasters was for UK CPIH in calendar-year 2025 to sit somewhere around 0 %-2 %, with most weight on a number close to zero.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \n^1  Quantification of the fiscal loosening is taken from paragraph 1.22 of the November 2022 OBR EFO (not reproduced in the excerpt but widely cited in contemporaneous media summaries).  \n^2  Calendar-year CPIH averages for 2022-24 are computed from monthly CPIH indices published by ONS (Ons.gov.uk, Dec 2025 CPIH dataset).</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"GBRCPIALLQINMEI\" query=\"United Kingdom CPI All Items GBRCPIALLQINMEI\">\nFRED Economic Data: Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for United Kingdom\nSeries ID: GBRCPIALLQINMEI\nUnits: Index 2015=100\nFrequency: Quarterly\nLatest observation: 135.60 (2025-01-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=134.07, min=132.70, max=135.60\n- 5-year: mean=121.85, min=108.70, max=135.60\n- 10-year: mean=112.98, min=100.00, max=135.60\n- All-time: mean=53.26, min=4.86, max=135.60 (since 1955-01-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.90 (+0.7%)\n- 3-month change: +0.90 (+0.7%)\n- 6-month change: +2.30 (+1.7%)\n- Year-over-year: 135.60 vs 130.80 (+3.7%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Quarterly):\nDate,Value\n2022-04-01,119.70\n2022-07-01,121.80\n2022-10-01,124.80\n2023-01-01,125.90\n2023-04-01,128.90\n2023-07-01,129.50\n2023-10-01,130.30\n2024-01-01,130.80\n2024-04-01,132.70\n2024-07-01,133.30\n2024-10-01,134.70\n2025-01-01,135.60\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
