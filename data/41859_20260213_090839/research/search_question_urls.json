This error was not revised per established policies but would have minimal impact on real measures of earnings for April 2025.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/11/britain-new-pm-5-september-tory-leadership-rules-announced\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Britain to have new PM by 5 September as Tory leadership rules announced\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** July 11, 2022  \n**Author:** Aubrey Allegretti\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n- **New PM announcement date:** September 5, 2022\n- **Leadership race timeline:** Final two candidates to be decided by end of Thursday the following week (July 21, 2022), with knockout votes beginning Wednesday afternoon (July 13, 2022)\n- **Entry requirements:** Candidates need 20 MP backers to enter (increased from 8), and at least 30 votes to pass the first round\n\n## Candidate Support Levels (as of July 11, 2022):\n\n- **Rishi Sunak:** Nearly 40 MPs backing him\n- **Penny Mordaunt:** 24 MPs (polling showed she was preferred candidate among party members according to Conservative Home)\n- **Tom Tugendhat:** Third highest number of backers\n- **Suella Braverman:** 12 MPs\n- **Grant Shapps:** 8 MPs (fewest public supporters)\n\n## Economic Policy Positions:\n\n**Rishi Sunak:**\n- Plans to warn that rivals' tax-cutting promises will fuel inflation\n- Emphasizes need to deal with deficit ahead of major tax rises\n- Hints at possible further public spending cuts\n- Will say: \"We need a return to traditional Conservative economic values \u2013 and that means honesty and responsibility, not fairy tales\"\n\n**Tom Tugendhat:**\n- Pledges \"10-year plan for growth\"\n- Argues tax cuts should be directed towards stimulating investment\n- States: \"Tax cuts cannot be the only round in the magazine to fire growth in the economy\"\n\n**Nadhim Zahawi:**\n- Promises to cut income tax from 20p to 19p next year, and to 18p in 2024\n- Pledges: \"Tax as a percentage of GDP will fall year on year if I become prime minister\"\n- Would suspend all VAT and green levies on energy bills for two years\n- Plans to finance tax cuts by getting every government department to cut costs by 20% (later qualified as reducing headcount rather than departmental spending)\n\n**Jeremy Hunt:**\n- Pledged to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2027/28\n\n## Political Context:\n\n- Multiple candidates on the right competing for votes, described by sources as a \"fight on the right\"\n- Labour leader Keir Starmer condemned the rush to cut taxes among Tory candidates, calling it an \"arms race of fantasy economics\"\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on the leadership race mechanics and candidate positioning rather than specific inflation forecasts or economic analysis.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
