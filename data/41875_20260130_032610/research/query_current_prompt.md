The forecasting question is:
What will be Donald Trump's approval rating on February 14, 2026?

Question background:
According to the [resolution source](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin):&#x20;

> **Updated January 21, 2026**

> We’ve seen lots of new polls this week, and they haven’t been great for Donald Trump. **His net approval rating in our average dropped from -12.0 on Monday to -12.9 today.** That means Trump is still slightly more popular than he was at this point during his first term (-16.4 net approval rating), but he’s far less popular than Barack Obama (-8.5) and George W. Bush (-10.4) were one year into their second terms.

> Approval of Trump’s handling of immigration also hit a second term low of net -10.0 in our average yesterday. But his approval on the economy has actually risen somewhat to net -16.5 — it was around -20 at the start of the year. Previously, when pollsters measured Trump’s overall job approval and his rating on the economy, the former was meaningfully higher than the latter. But the two have been much closer in this week’s releases:

> [Marist](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/u-s-foreign-policy-january-2026/): -18 overall vs. -21 economy.

> [Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3945): -14 overall vs. -11 economy.

> [AP-NORC](https://apnorc.org/projects/fewer-want-the-u-s-to-take-an-active-role-in-global-affairs/): -19 overall vs. -25 economy.

> [Reuters/Ipsos](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-oppose-using-military-force-take-possession-greenland): -17 overall vs. -19 economy.

> [CNN/SSRS](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/16/politics/trump-economy-first-year-cnn-poll): -22 overall vs. -22 economy.

> [Navigator](https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Navigator-January-1-Topline-F01.12.26.pdf): -14 overall vs. -15 economy.

> [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-approval-rating-economy-poll-b3a62e57): -9 overall vs. -10 economy.
