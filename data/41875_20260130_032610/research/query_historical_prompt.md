The forecasting question is:
What will be Donald Trump's approval rating on February 14, 2026?

Question background:
According to the [resolution source](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin):&#x20;

> **Updated January 21, 2026**

> We’ve seen lots of new polls this week, and they haven’t been great for Donald Trump. **His net approval rating in our average dropped from -12.0 on Monday to -12.9 today.** That means Trump is still slightly more popular than he was at this point during his first term (-16.4 net approval rating), but he’s far less popular than Barack Obama (-8.5) and George W. Bush (-10.4) were one year into their second terms.

> Approval of Trump’s handling of immigration also hit a second term low of net -10.0 in our average yesterday. But his approval on the economy has actually risen somewhat to net -16.5 — it was around -20 at the start of the year. Previously, when pollsters measured Trump’s overall job approval and his rating on the economy, the former was meaningfully higher than the latter. But the two have been much closer in this week’s releases:

> [Marist](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/u-s-foreign-policy-january-2026/): -18 overall vs. -21 economy.

> [Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3945): -14 overall vs. -11 economy.

> [AP-NORC](https://apnorc.org/projects/fewer-want-the-u-s-to-take-an-active-role-in-global-affairs/): -19 overall vs. -25 economy.

> [Reuters/Ipsos](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-oppose-using-military-force-take-possession-greenland): -17 overall vs. -19 economy.

> [CNN/SSRS](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/16/politics/trump-economy-first-year-cnn-poll): -22 overall vs. -22 economy.

> [Navigator](https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Navigator-January-1-Topline-F01.12.26.pdf): -14 overall vs. -15 economy.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
