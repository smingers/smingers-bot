    "description": "In 2015, Nepal adopted a [new constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Nepal), providing for a bicameral legislature consisting of the upper [National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_\\(Nepal\\)) and the lower [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_\\(Nepal\\)). The House of Representatives is made up of 275 members, of which 165 are elected in single-member constituencies and 110 are elected via a nationwide party-list proportional election.\n\nAs of early 2026, Nepal has held two elections under this system. In [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Nepalese_general_election), the [Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Nepal_\\(Unified_Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist\\)) won the most seats in the House, winning 80 of the 165 constituencies and, with 33.25% of the proportional vote, 41 of the 110 proportional seats. Afterward, [K.P. Sharma Oli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._P._Sharma_Oli), of the CPN (UML), was appointed prime minister, with the support of the [Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Nepal_\\(Maoist_Centre\\)), which had come in third in the election.\n\nIn the [2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Nepalese_general_election) election, the [Nepali Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Congress) won the most seats, winning 57 of the 165 constituencies and 32 of the 110 proportional seats, though the Congress received fewer proportional votes than the CPN (UML). After the election, however, Nepali Congress was unable to draw enough support to form a government, and several other parties, including the next largest four parties in the House (the CPN (UML), the CPN (MC), the [Rastriya Swatantra Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastriya_Swatantra_Party), and the [Rastriya Prajatantra Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastriya_Prajatantra_Party)) came together to form a government under the premiership of [Pushpa Kamal Dahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpa_Kamal_Dahal), of the CPN (MC).\n\nIn July 2024, the CPN (UML) pulled out of the governing coalition with the CPN (MC) and allied itself with the Nepali Congress instead. This caused a loss in confidence in Dahal's government and resulted in Oli's returning to the premiership.\n\nIn September 2025, Nepal was rocked by [widespread youth protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Nepalese_Gen_Z_protests) that came to be known as the \"Gen Z protests.\" Among other things, these protests resulted in Oli's resignation and the dissolution of the House of Representatives, which has remained vacant ever since. An interim government was established, which is now organizing the upcoming election.\n\nIn November 2025, several leftist parties, including the CPN (MC) but not the CPN (UML), [merged to create](https://english.nepalnews.com/s/politics/nine-leftist-factions-merge-to-form-nepali-communist-party-jhalanath-khanal-joins/) the [Nepali Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Communist_Party).",
