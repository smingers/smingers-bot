Since the November 2022 general election five different governing combinations have ruled, none commanding the 138-seat majority required in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR). The mixed electoral system (165 FPTP + 110 PR) continues to fragment representation and to magnify the largest vote-getter in the constituency tier.  \n\u2022  The Gen-Z anti-corruption revolt of 8-11 Sept 2025 was the single biggest shock since the 2006 Jana Andolan. It toppled the Oli government, gutted party offices and forced dissolution of parliament on 12 Sept 2025 (Nepal News, The Diplomat, Context.news). The caretaker cabinet headed by retired chief-justice Sushila Karki scheduled snap polls for 5 March 2026 and has so far kept to the constitutional calendar.  \n\u2022  Oli\u2019s Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) and the Nepali Congress (NC) have oscillated between rivalry and pragmatic pacts. Their latest cooperation was on 25 Jan 2026 when they, with Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), ran a joint slate for 17 of 19 National Assembly seats, producing a 9-seat NC, 8-seat UML and 1-seat JSP outcome (Devdiscourse). This upper-house bargain stopped short of a formal seat-sharing accord for the lower house but signals renewed bargaining space.  \n\u2022  Madhes parties have consolidated. JSP and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) formally merged in January 2026, presenting a single \u201cUnified Madhesi Front\u201d banner throughout the 32 Terai constituencies (Kathmandu Post cited in earlier memo).  \n\u2022  \u201cThird-force\u201d expansion: The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) absorbed Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah\u2019s local platform and Ujyalo Nepal\u2019s energy-reform group and is standing in 164 of 165 FPTP seats (Nepal News FAQ; The Diplomat). Its social-media reach and association with the 2025 protests give it disproportionate urban visibility.  \n\nHistorical election patterns  \n\u2022  No outright majority has ever emerged from Nepal\u2019s 10 parliamentary elections since 1959; coalitions are structural.  \n\u2022  Since the 2008 re-introduction of multiparty democracy the mixed system has consistently over-rewarded alliances in the FPTP tier: the NC-led bloc won 37 % of the 2013 vote but 46 % of seats, and the UML-Maoist \u201cleft alliance\u201d converted 43 % of votes into 63 % of seats in 2017. The 2022 contest was more fractured: NC 89, UML 78, Maoist Centre 32, RSP 20, JSP 12, LSP 9, RPP 14, independents 5 (IPU Parline).  \n\u2022  Voter turnout has hovered between 67 % and 69 % in the past three general elections (IDEA database), but precinct-level digitised data remain unavailable, complicating granular modelling.  \n\nAdministrative picture for 2026  \n\u2022  Candidates: 3 487 valid FPTP nominations (11 % women, 15 % under 35) across 68 parties (Himalayan Times, The Diplomat).  \n\u2022  PR lists: 63 parties filed 3 213 names; Election Commission scrutiny of quota compliance ended 3 Feb 2026 (Gorkhapatra). Final machine-readable cluster data are still pending.  \n\u2022  Security: 338 000 personnel under an Integrated Election Security Plan; roughly one-third of Nepal\u2019s 11 901 polling stations are classed \u201chighly sensitive\u201d (Nepal News FAQ).  \n\nCurrent party strengths entering March 2026  \n\n1.  Nepali Congress (NC \u2013 Gagan Thapa faction)  \n    \u2013 HoR seats at dissolution: 89  \n    \u2013 Nationwide FPTP candidates: 165 (Nepal News FAQ)  \n    \u2013 Assets: oldest grassroots machinery, control of the \u201ctree\u201d symbol, moderate brand with renewed youth leadership.  \n    \u2013 Liabilities: organisational rupture with Sher Bahadur Deuba\u2019s \u201cCongress (Democratic)\u201d splinter; ideological ambiguity after flirting with both UML and Maoists.  \n\n2.  CPN-UML (K. P. Sharma Oli)  \n    \u2013 Seats: 78  \n    \u2013 Candidates: 165  \n    \u2013 Assets: disciplined cadre network in hill districts; still the largest left party.  \n    \u2013 Liabilities: personal unpopularity of Oli after the protest deaths; unclear coalition posture (NA aligned with NC, but Maoist back-channel talks reportedly alive).  \n\n3.  Nepali Communist Party (Maoist-led merger)  \n    \u2013 Seats: 32 (+ small left micro-parties)  \n    \u2013 Candidates: 164  \n    \u2013 Assets: residual wartime loyalty in select rural pockets; exclusive use of hammer-and-sickle symbol.  \n    \u2013 Liabilities: funding shortfall, urban vote erosion, isolated in upper-house race, no seat-sharing with UML by 21 Jan deadline.  \n\n4.  Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP-Balen-Ghising bloc)  \n    \u2013 Seats in last HoR: 20  \n    \u2013 Candidates: 164  \n    \u2013 Assets: protest legitimacy, social-media dominance, fresh urban appeal; Balendra Shah vs. Oli \u201cold-vs-new\u201d contest highlighted by The Diplomat.  \n    \u2013 Liabilities: thin rural apparatus, donor-funding scrutiny, internal rivalry between Rabi Lamichhane and Shah.  \n\n5.  Unified Madhesi Front (JSP-LSP)  \n    \u2013 Combined seats pre-merger: 21  \n    \u2013 Candidates: full coverage of 32 Madhes constituencies; alliance-friendly posture.  \n    \u2013 Assets: clearer single banner, caste/community networks.  \n    \u2013 Liabilities: dependence on larger parties for federal ministries.  \n\n6.  Royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) and independents  \n    \u2013 Seats: 14 + 5 independents  \n    \u2013 Assets: potential king-maker if verdict is highly fragmented.  \n\nProvince-level battlegrounds  \n\u2022  Madhes Province (32 FPTP): pivotal; all marquee leaders have registered here. High youth unemployment (22.7 % nationally; higher in Madhes \u2013 earlier memo) amplifies anti-incumbent sentiment.  \n\u2022  Urban swing belts: Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur (9 FPTP) are arenas where RSP\u2019s digital campaigning could translate into up to 15-20 PR seats if youth turnout spikes (The Diplomat, Context.news).  \n\u2022  Economic backdrop: FY 2025 GDP growth rebounded to 4.6 % but is projected to slow to 2.1 % in FY 2026 because of post-protest uncertainty; poverty is expected to edge up to 6.6 % (World Bank Nepal Development Update). Provincial GDP concentration remains stark: Bagmati generates 36.5 % of output while Karnali provides only 4.2 % (Nepsetrading). Such disparities may fuel regional protest voting.  \n\nCoalition arithmetic for the 2026 HoR  \n\nA.  NC-UML \u201cGrand Coalition\u201d  \n    Probability rising. Based on 2022 seat counts an NC+UML reprise would control c. 167 seats\u2014well above 138. NA joint list and ongoing ministry-sharing talks (Khabarhub July 2024 agreement) show elite receptiveness, but premiership rotation remains the sticking point.  \n\nB.  NC-Maoist-Madhesi \u201cConstitutional Centre\u201d  \n    Still feasible if NC calculates that left unity would alienate urban youth; requires Maoists to regain leverage by holding 25-30 seats.  \n\nC.  Re-stitched Left Front (UML + Maoists)  \n    Probability falling: they are opponents in the NA race and have no seat deal for HoR. Would need 30-plus seats from third forces to govern.  \n\nD.  Third-force pivot outcome  \n    Scenarios in which RSP wins 20-25 FPTP seats and 10-12 % of PR vote (~35-40 total) could force either NC- or UML-led blocs to court it; leadership rivalries inside RSP add uncertainty.  \n\nE.  Highly fragmented verdict  \n    Historical precedent plus 68 parties on ballot keep this as the base case; minority government with revolving-door coalitions and \u201coutside support\u201d agreements remains plausible.  \n\nKey drivers to monitor before 5 March  \n1.  Opinion polling: no public nationwide survey exists post-candidate finalisation, creating a major analytic blind spot.  \n2.  Late seat-withdrawal or tacit \u201cfriendly fights\u201d in the 165 FPTP seats\u2014especially any last-minute NC-UML non-compete signals\u2014could re-shape constituency maths.  \n3.  Final, cluster-validated PR lists: without machine-readable data it is impossible to model whether parties meet gender/caste quotas and how many \u201cphantom seats\u201d risk annulment.  \n4.  Turnout propensity among first-time voters: the Gen-Z uprising may either energise or depress participation; no credible turnout survey is yet public.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \n\u2022  Independent, post-Jan 22 opinion polls on vote intention and youth turnout.  \n\u2022  Election Commission\u2019s machine-readable final PR list with gender and ethnicity tagging.  \n\u2022  Any documented FPTP seat-sharing or tacit withdrawal arrangements filed after 23 Jan for NC-UML, UML-Maoist or NC-Maoist configurations.  \n\u2022  Province-level unemployment and GDP 1H FY 2025/26 update to refine economic-voting models.  \n\u2022  Digitised precinct-level turnout data from 2017 and 2022 to calibrate constituency forecasts.  \n\nThese gaps limit the precision of seat projections and coalition probability estimates.  \n\nRecommended next research actions  \n1.  Track Election Commission bulletins daily for the February 3 publication of final PR lists and subsequent withdrawals.  \n2.  Monitor leading pollsters (Interdisciplinary Analysts, Centre for Social Development & Research) for any February releases; if none appear, commission a private poll or rely on stratified focus-group data.  \n3.  Scrape Finance Ministry and National Statistics Office mid-year economic updates once tabled in parliament (expected early February).  \n4.  Approach UNDP Electoral Support Project or International IDEA for digitised turnout micro-data; if unavailable, request CSV exports from the EC\u2019s internal results portal.  \n5.  Watch the Supreme Court docket for any last-minute candidacy litigations that could force by-elections in key constituencies (five complaints already filed in Sunsari-2, Rautahat-1, Bhaktapur-2, Kailali-2\u2014Himalayan Times).\n\nWith these additions the analytical model would achieve materially higher confidence; until then coalition scenarios should be treated as indicative rather than predictive.</Agent_report>\n"
