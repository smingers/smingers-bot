(d) Justification:
Key Forecasting Factors:

- Consolidated Madhesi parties
- Chronic coalition dynamics
- Economic uncertainty

Outside View Calibration:
Considerations:
- Historical unpredictability of Nepalese elections
- Multiple viable coalition scenarios

- No recent comprehensive opinion polling

Adjustment Factors:
- Increase uncertainty due to recent political volatility
- Recognize potential for unexpected outcomes
- Account for fragmented political landscape

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 28%
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 25%
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 16%
Nepali Communist Party: 12%
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 7%
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 4%
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 3%

Rationale: Prediction reflects historical fragmentation, gives slight edge to traditional parties while acknowledging the rising third-force potential, and maintains significant uncertainty given the complex political environment.
