- Emergence of Rastriya Swatantra Party as potential kingmaker
- Youth voter bloc potentially reshaping electoral dynamics

Probability Calibration:

Checklist:
1. Options: Predict which party wins most seats in Nepal's 2026 House of Representatives election
2. Base Rate: Previously established fragmented multi-party landscape
3. Consistency Check: Nepali Congress and UML most likely; smaller parties least likely
4. Key Evidence:
   - Gen Z protests challenging political status quo
   - No single party majority history
   - 1 million new youth voters
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected coalition formation or last-minute political merger
6. Technicalities: Probabilities will sum to 100, no % sign

Probabilities: [30, 25, 15, 12, 7, 4, 3, 4]

Rationale for Probabilities:
- Slight increase for Nepali Congress due to established infrastructure
- Maintained strong position for UML
- Increased probability for Rastriya Swatantra Party reflecting youth movement
- Reduced probabilities for smaller parties
- Small "Other" probability to account for potential unexpected outcomes

The probabilities reflect the complex, fluid political landscape, acknowledging both historical patterns and transformative recent events.
