Most Suitable Reference Class: Post-Conflict Electoral Systems with Mixed Voting Methods (Nepal's unique political context)

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: Approximately 38 days from today (5 March 2026 election)
- Historical Pattern: Consistent coalition governments, no single party majority since 2008

(d) Justification:
- Fragmented political landscape
- Strong historical precedent for coalition governments
- Emerging "third force" with Rastriya Swatantra Party
- Significant youth political engagement
- Complex electoral system favoring alliances

Outside View Calibration:
- Historical Upset Rate: Moderate (coalition dynamics unpredictable)
- Probability Distribution Considerations:
  1. No single party has consistently dominated
  2. Electoral system rewards coalition-building
  3. Youth movement could introduce unexpected dynamics

Adjustment Factors:
- Reduce probability for smaller parties
- Increase probability for top 3-4 parties
- Include buffer for potential unexpected outcomes

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 28%
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 25%
Nepali Communist Party: 15%
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 12%
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 7%
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 4%
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 3%
Other: 6%

Rationale: Reflects historical fragmentation, potential for coalition-building, and emerging political dynamics, with Nepali Congress and UML maintaining slight edge due to established infrastructure.
