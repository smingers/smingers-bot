(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Date: March 5, 2026 (38 days from today)
- If timeframe halved: Increased uncertainty, more volatile predictions
- If timeframe doubled: More time for coalition formations, potentially more stable predictions

(d) Justification:
Key Transformative Factors:
- Gen Z protest movement's impact on political dynamics
- Breakdown of traditional party structures
- Emergence of new political actors like Rastriya Swatantra Party
- Economic and climate challenges creating demand for systemic change

Consistency Check:
Most likely categories: Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (UML)
Least likely categories: Ujyaalo Nepal Party, Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party
This alignment makes sense given historical political patterns and recent developments.

Significant Evidence:
1. Gen Z protests exposed deep political dysfunction
2. No single party has secured majority in recent decades
3. 1 million new youth voters potentially reshaping electoral landscape

Blind Spot Statement:
Unexpected coalition formation or last-minute political realignment could dramatically shift predicted outcomes.

Checklist Verification:
1. Options: Predict party with most seats in 2026 Nepali House of Representatives election
2. Base rate distribution maintained with moderate adjustments
3. Consistency check confirms logical prediction
4. Key evidence critically examined
5. Blind spot scenario identified
6. Probabilities will sum to 100

Probability Calibration:
Adjusting outside view prediction based on recent transformative events, particularly the Gen Z protests and emerging political dynamics. Reducing probabilities for traditional parties, increasing for newer political actors.

Probabilities: [22, 20, 16, 15, 10, 6, 4, 7]

Rationale for Probability Distribution:
- Slightly reduced Nepali Congress probability (from 24% to 22%) due to recent political instability
- Reduced Communist Party of Nepal (UML) probability (from 22% to 20%) reflecting challenges
- Increased Rastriya Swatantra Party probability (from 14% to 15%) due to youth momentum
- Modest increases for other emerging parties reflecting political transformation
- 'Other' category maintained to account for potential unexpected developments

The probabilities reflect a nuanced understanding of Nepal's complex political landscape, acknowledging both historical patterns and recent transformative events.
