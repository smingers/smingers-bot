(d) Justification:

- Complex coalition-building dynamics

Outside View Calibration:
- Base Rate: No single party has won outright majority in recent elections
- Uncertainty Factors:
  1. Youth voter sentiment
  2. Protest movement's electoral impact
  3. Potential last-minute alliance shifts
- Upset Potential: Moderate to High (given recent political volatility)

Considerations:

- Account for potential unexpected coalitions
- Recognize high variability in Nepali electoral outcomes

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 24%
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 22%
Nepali Communist Party: 15%
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 14%
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 8%
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 5%
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 3%
Other: 9%

Rationale: Reflects historical fragmentation, emerging party dynamics, and potential for surprise outcomes, while maintaining Nepali Congress and UML as leading contenders with reduced margins compared to previous elections.
