(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Suitable reference classes:

2. Proportional representation systems in developing democracies
3. South Asian coalition government formations

Most suitable: Nepal's post-2008 parliamentary elections, given identical electoral system and recent historical context

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction timeframe: Approximately 38 days from today (5 March 2026 election)
- Historical pattern: Consistent coalition governments, no single party majority
- Typical electoral volatility: Significant inter-election seat shifts (e.g., UML from 121 to 78 seats)

(d) Justification:
The 2026 election appears highly competitive with multiple potential coalition scenarios. Key factors include:
- Gen-Z anti-corruption movement's impact
- Fragmented party landscape
- Emerging third-force (Rastriya Swatantra Party)
- Madhesi party consolidation

Outside view calibration:
- Historically, no single party has achieved outright majority
- High uncertainty due to recent political disruptions
- Need to account for potential unexpected outcomes
- Importance of granular probability distinctions

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 25%
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 23%
Nepali Communist Party: 15%
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 14%
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 8%
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 5%
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 3%
Other: 7%

Rationale: Reflects historical fragmentation, gives slight edge to traditional parties while acknowledging rising third-force potential, and leaves room for unexpected outcomes.
