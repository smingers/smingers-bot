(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Timeframe: 38 days until election (March 5, 2026)
- Short-term Scenario: High volatility, rapid political shifts possible
- Long-term Scenario: More consolidated party strategies emerge

(d) Justification:
The 2026 election represents a potential transformative moment in Nepali politics. The September 2025 protests fundamentally challenged existing political structures, creating an unprecedented environment of political uncertainty.

Consistency Check:
Most likely categories: Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (UML)
Least likely categories: Ujyaalo Nepal Party, Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party
This alignment seems reasonable given historical patterns and current political dynamics.

Key Evidence Influencing Prediction:
1. Gen Z protests dramatically reshaping political landscape
2. No single party has secured majority in recent decades
3. 1 million new youth voters entering electoral process

Blind Spot Statement:
Potential scenario rendering forecast incorrect: Unexpected coalition formation or emergence of a completely new political movement that consolidates multiple protest-driven factions.

Checklist Verification:
1. Options: Nepali House of Representatives election, March 5, 2026
2. Base rate distribution maintained with moderate adjustments
3. Consistency check passed
4. Key evidence validated
5. Blind spot identified
6. Probabilities will sum to 100

Probabilities: [28, 25, 16, 15, 7, 4, 3, 2]

Rationale for Probability Adjustment:
- Slightly increased Nepali Congress probability due to historical resilience
- Reduced Communist Party probabilities reflecting recent instability
- Increased Rastriya Swatantra Party probability reflecting youth momentum
- Modest probabilities for smaller parties reflecting potential coalition dynamics

The probabilities reflect a nuanced view of Nepal's complex political ecosystem, acknowledging both historical patterns and transformative recent events.
