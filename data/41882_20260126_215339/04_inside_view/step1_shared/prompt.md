Query: Recent political trends in Nepal, analyze historical election patterns, examine current party strengths and potential coalitions for 2026 parliamentary election
Recent political trajectory (2022-Jan 2026)  
•  Chronic coalition churn has intensified. Since the November 2022 general election five different governing combinations have ruled, none commanding the 138-seat majority required in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR). The mixed electoral system (165 FPTP + 110 PR) continues to fragment representation and to magnify the largest vote-getter in the constituency tier.  
•  The Gen-Z anti-corruption revolt of 8-11 Sept 2025 was the single biggest shock since the 2006 Jana Andolan. It toppled the Oli government, gutted party offices and forced dissolution of parliament on 12 Sept 2025 (Nepal News, The Diplomat, Context.news). The caretaker cabinet headed by retired chief-justice Sushila Karki scheduled snap polls for 5 March 2026 and has so far kept to the constitutional calendar.  
•  Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) and the Nepali Congress (NC) have oscillated between rivalry and pragmatic pacts. Their latest cooperation was on 25 Jan 2026 when they, with Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), ran a joint slate for 17 of 19 National Assembly seats, producing a 9-seat NC, 8-seat UML and 1-seat JSP outcome (Devdiscourse). This upper-house bargain stopped short of a formal seat-sharing accord for the lower house but signals renewed bargaining space.  
•  Madhes parties have consolidated. JSP and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) formally merged in January 2026, presenting a single “Unified Madhesi Front” banner throughout the 32 Terai constituencies (Kathmandu Post cited in earlier memo).  
•  “Third-force” expansion: The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) absorbed Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah’s local platform and Ujyalo Nepal’s energy-reform group and is standing in 164 of 165 FPTP seats (Nepal News FAQ; The Diplomat). Its social-media reach and association with the 2025 protests give it disproportionate urban visibility.  

Historical election patterns  
•  No outright majority has ever emerged from Nepal’s 10 parliamentary elections since 1959; coalitions are structural.  
•  Since the 2008 re-introduction of multiparty democracy the mixed system has consistently over-rewarded alliances in the FPTP tier: the NC-led bloc won 37 % of the 2013 vote but 46 % of seats, and the UML-Maoist “left alliance” converted 43 % of votes into 63 % of seats in 2017. The 2022 contest was more fractured: NC 89, UML 78, Maoist Centre 32, RSP 20, JSP 12, LSP 9, RPP 14, independents 5 (IPU Parline).  
•  Voter turnout has hovered between 67 % and 69 % in the past three general elections (IDEA database), but precinct-level digitised data remain unavailable, complicating granular modelling.  

Administrative picture for 2026  
•  Candidates: 3 487 valid FPTP nominations (11 % women, 15 % under 35) across 68 parties (Himalayan Times, The Diplomat).  
•  PR lists: 63 parties filed 3 213 names; Election Commission scrutiny of quota compliance ended 3 Feb 2026 (Gorkhapatra). Final machine-readable cluster data are still pending.  
•  Security: 338 000 personnel under an Integrated Election Security Plan; roughly one-third of Nepal’s 11 901 polling stations are classed “highly sensitive” (Nepal News FAQ).  

Current party strengths entering March 2026  

1.  Nepali Congress (NC – Gagan Thapa faction)  
    – HoR seats at dissolution: 89  
    – Nationwide FPTP candidates: 165 (Nepal News FAQ)  
    – Assets: oldest grassroots machinery, control of the “tree” symbol, moderate brand with renewed youth leadership.  
    – Liabilities: organisational rupture with Sher Bahadur Deuba’s “Congress (Democratic)” splinter; ideological ambiguity after flirting with both UML and Maoists.  

2.  CPN-UML (K. P. Sharma Oli)  
    – Seats: 78  
    – Candidates: 165  
    – Assets: disciplined cadre network in hill districts; still the largest left party.  
    – Liabilities: personal unpopularity of Oli after the protest deaths; unclear coalition posture (NA aligned with NC, but Maoist back-channel talks reportedly alive).  

3.  Nepali Communist Party (Maoist-led merger)  
    – Seats: 32 (+ small left micro-parties)  
    – Candidates: 164  
    – Assets: residual wartime loyalty in select rural pockets; exclusive use of hammer-and-sickle symbol.  
    – Liabilities: funding shortfall, urban vote erosion, isolated in upper-house race, no seat-sharing with UML by 21 Jan deadline.  

4.  Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP-Balen-Ghising bloc)  
    – Seats in last HoR: 20  
    – Candidates: 164  
    – Assets: protest legitimacy, social-media dominance, fresh urban appeal; Balendra Shah vs. Oli “old-vs-new” contest highlighted by The Diplomat.  
    – Liabilities: thin rural apparatus, donor-funding scrutiny, internal rivalry between Rabi Lamichhane and Shah.  

5.  Unified Madhesi Front (JSP-LSP)  
    – Combined seats pre-merger: 21  
    – Candidates: full coverage of 32 Madhes constituencies; alliance-friendly posture.  
    – Assets: clearer single banner, caste/community networks.  
    – Liabilities: dependence on larger parties for federal ministries.  

6.  Royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) and independents  
    – Seats: 14 + 5 independents  
    – Assets: potential king-maker if verdict is highly fragmented.  

Province-level battlegrounds  
•  Madhes Province (32 FPTP): pivotal; all marquee leaders have registered here. High youth unemployment (22.7 % nationally; higher in Madhes – earlier memo) amplifies anti-incumbent sentiment.  
•  Urban swing belts: Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur (9 FPTP) are arenas where RSP’s digital campaigning could translate into up to 15-20 PR seats if youth turnout spikes (The Diplomat, Context.news).  
•  Economic backdrop: FY 2025 GDP growth rebounded to 4.6 % but is projected to slow to 2.1 % in FY 2026 because of post-protest uncertainty; poverty is expected to edge up to 6.6 % (World Bank Nepal Development Update). Provincial GDP concentration remains stark: Bagmati generates 36.5 % of output while Karnali provides only 4.2 % (Nepsetrading). Such disparities may fuel regional protest voting.  

Coalition arithmetic for the 2026 HoR  

A.  NC-UML “Grand Coalition”  
    Probability rising. Based on 2022 seat counts an NC+UML reprise would control c. 167 seats—well above 138. NA joint list and ongoing ministry-sharing talks (Khabarhub July 2024 agreement) show elite receptiveness, but premiership rotation remains the sticking point.  

B.  NC-Maoist-Madhesi “Constitutional Centre”  
    Still feasible if NC calculates that left unity would alienate urban youth; requires Maoists to regain leverage by holding 25-30 seats.  

C.  Re-stitched Left Front (UML + Maoists)  
    Probability falling: they are opponents in the NA race and have no seat deal for HoR. Would need 30-plus seats from third forces to govern.  

D.  Third-force pivot outcome  
    Scenarios in which RSP wins 20-25 FPTP seats and 10-12 % of PR vote (~35-40 total) could force either NC- or UML-led blocs to court it; leadership rivalries inside RSP add uncertainty.  

E.  Highly fragmented verdict  
    Historical precedent plus 68 parties on ballot keep this as the base case; minority government with revolving-door coalitions and “outside support” agreements remains plausible.  

Key drivers to monitor before 5 March  
1.  Opinion polling: no public nationwide survey exists post-candidate finalisation, creating a major analytic blind spot.  
2.  Late seat-withdrawal or tacit “friendly fights” in the 165 FPTP seats—especially any last-minute NC-UML non-compete signals—could re-shape constituency maths.  
3.  Final, cluster-validated PR lists: without machine-readable data it is impossible to model whether parties meet gender/caste quotas and how many “phantom seats” risk annulment.  
4.  Turnout propensity among first-time voters: the Gen-Z uprising may either energise or depress participation; no credible turnout survey is yet public.  

Remaining information gaps  
•  Independent, post-Jan 22 opinion polls on vote intention and youth turnout.  
•  Election Commission’s machine-readable final PR list with gender and ethnicity tagging.  
•  Any documented FPTP seat-sharing or tacit withdrawal arrangements filed after 23 Jan for NC-UML, UML-Maoist or NC-Maoist configurations.  
•  Province-level unemployment and GDP 1H FY 2025/26 update to refine economic-voting models.  
•  Digitised precinct-level turnout data from 2017 and 2022 to calibrate constituency forecasts.  

These gaps limit the precision of seat projections and coalition probability estimates.  

Recommended next research actions  
1.  Track Election Commission bulletins daily for the February 3 publication of final PR lists and subsequent withdrawals.  
2.  Monitor leading pollsters (Interdisciplinary Analysts, Centre for Social Development & Research) for any February releases; if none appear, commission a private poll or rely on stratified focus-group data.  
3.  Scrape Finance Ministry and National Statistics Office mid-year economic updates once tabled in parliament (expected early February).  
4.  Approach UNDP Electoral Support Project or International IDEA for digitised turnout micro-data; if unavailable, request CSV exports from the EC’s internal results portal.  
5.  Watch the Supreme Court docket for any last-minute candidacy litigations that could force by-elections in key constituencies (five complaints already filed in Sunsari-2, Rautahat-1, Bhaktapur-2, Kailali-2—Himalayan Times).

With these additions the analytical model would achieve materially higher confidence; until then coalition scenarios should be treated as indicative rather than predictive.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for perplexity), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Perplexity report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
