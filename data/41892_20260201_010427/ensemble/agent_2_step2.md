## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large shifts justified):**

1. **Convergent polling consensus**: Five independent major polls (Yomiuri/Nikkei, JNN, Mainichi, Kyodo, Asahi) all project LDP at or near 233-seat threshold. Historical accuracy of these organizations (especially Kyodo's ±15 seat precision) provides strong signal. This is the most compelling evidence.

2. **Structural seat-conversion advantage**: Japan's parallel SMD/PR system historically inflates plurality party's seat share. With LDP leading in ~170 of 289 SMDs and opposition fragmented, mechanical translation favors crossing 233 threshold even with modest vote share (~30%).

3. **Opposition fragmentation**: Centrist Reform Alliance (CRA) suffering from low name recognition, projected to fall below 167 pre-election seats across all polls. No coordinated opposition challenge emerging in final week.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate shifts):**

4. **Takaichi approval ratings**: 59-60% cabinet approval (down from 70% but still historically strong). Named experts (Koll, Govella) attribute potential LDP success directly to her personal popularity. However, LDP party approval remains ~30%, creating leader-party gap.

5. **Short campaign timeframe**: 12-16 day campaign (shortest postwar) favors incumbents with established machinery, especially with Kyodo noting LDP leads in proportional representation where late-deciding voters matter less.

6. **Historical rebound pattern**: Outside view notes 2/2 times LDP regained majority after falling below 233 (1996, 2012). Current scenario fits this pattern.

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Small adjustments):**

7. **Undecided voters**: 20-50% undecided across polls creates volatility. However, direction of late breaks unclear - could favor status quo (LDP) or protest votes.

8. **Weather/turnout speculation**: Cold snap mentioned but no quantified turnout impact data. Anecdotal.

9. **Scandal overhang**: 40+ candidates linked to funding scandal, but no polling showing this actively depressing LDP support in final week.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 7 days until Feb 8, 2026 election.

**If halved to 3-4 days**: Confidence would increase toward polling consensus. Japanese final-week polling error averages ±12 seats (Kyodo series), so with 3-4 days remaining, late momentum shifts become less likely. Would adjust UP to ~75-78%.

**If doubled to 14 days**: Greater uncertainty about late-breaking events, opposition coordination, or scandal impact. The 50% undecided rate would matter more. Would adjust DOWN to ~65-68%.

Current 7-day window sits in middle zone where polls are highly predictive but not determinative.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline: 71%** (73% historical LDP majority rate, adjusted for Kōmeitō absence and 2024 setback)

**Upward pressure (+8-10pp):**
- **Polling convergence**: Five independent high-quality polls all showing LDP at threshold represents stronger signal than typical pre-election environment. Historical reference class (73%) didn't always have such clear polling consensus.
- **Mechanical advantage**: With opposition split three ways (CRA, DPFP, minor parties) and LDP leading in majority of SMDs, seat-conversion bonus is maximized. 2024's 191-seat result came with unified opposition; that's reversed.
- **Leader approval**: 60% cabinet approval in final week is near Koizumi 2005 (landslide) and Abe 2014 (comfortable win) levels, not typical of the 73% historical average which includes many closer elections.

**Downward pressure (-3-5pp):**
- **Genuine uncertainty**: 20-50% undecided is higher than typical final week. Kyodo's model shows LDP "narrowly" positioned, not comfortably above threshold.
- **Structural headwinds**: Loss of Kōmeitō's urban machinery is real. LDP must win marginal seats without traditional partner's GOTV operation.
- **Recent volatility**: 2024's 56-seat loss demonstrates electorate's willingness to punish LDP. Only 15 months ago.

**Net adjustment**: The polling consensus and mechanical advantages are sufficiently strong to justify moving UP from 71% baseline, but persistent undecided voters and structural uncertainties prevent moving to 85%+ confidence. The current circumstances make the reference class somewhat less analogous (stronger late-stage polling data, different coalition structure) but not radically different.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 71% outside view, I adjust:
- +7pp for unprecedented polling convergence showing LDP at threshold
- +3pp for maximized seat-conversion advantage with fragmented opposition  
- +2pp for strong leader approval in final week
- -2pp for high undecided voter rate
- -2pp for loss of Kōmeitō machinery in urban marginals

**Calibrated probability: 79%**

This reflects roughly 4:1 odds that LDP crosses 233 seats. In 100 elections with this configuration (strong but not overwhelming polling lead, fragmented opposition, 7 days out, 20-50% undecided), I expect the plurality party to achieve majority ~79 times.

A 10pp shift to 69% would imply polling consensus is misleading or late break strongly favors opposition - possible but inconsistent with structural advantages. A shift to 89% would require near-certainty that undecided voters break for LDP - overconfident given volatility signals.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will LDP win ≥233 of 465 House seats on Feb 8, 2026? (7 days out)

2. **Base rate**: 71% from historical LDP majority rate (73%), adjusted for recent setback and coalition change. Final prediction (79%) remains anchored to this, shifted by current polling strength.

3. **Consistency**: "79 out of 100 times, LDP wins 233+ seats in this configuration." Yes - aligns with strong-but-not-overwhelming polling consensus and structural advantages.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Five independent polls converge on LDP at/near 233-seat threshold (STRONG)
   - Seat-conversion mechanics favor plurality party with fragmented opposition (STRONG)
   - Takaichi 60% approval driving late momentum (MODERATE)
   - 20-50% undecided voters create residual uncertainty (MODERATE)
   - Loss of Kōmeitō urban machinery raises difficulty (MODERATE)

5. **Blind spot**: Late-breaking scandal revelation or coordinated opposition surge in final 48 hours could flip 15-20 marginal seats, dropping LDP to 215-225 range. This scenario (~15% probability) would make forecast look overconfident. However, no current signals suggest this is developing.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is LDP minority (198 seats). Forecast predicts significant change (gain of 35+ seats). However, this aligns with historical rebound pattern and polling data, not mere extrapolation. The 7-day timeframe with clear polling signals justifies confidence in change over stasis.

**Probability: 79%**
