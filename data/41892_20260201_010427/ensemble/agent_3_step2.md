Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves **Yes** if, in Japan’s Feb 8, 2026 House of Representatives election, the **LDP alone** wins **≥233 of 465 seats**.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs opinion)
Key: I treat **seat-projection polling** as the most relevant “facts”; pundit takes as **opinions** (weighted lower unless clearly expert + mechanism).

1. nippon.com data article (Jan 29, 2026) summarizing Yomiuri + Nikkei polls  
- **Quality:** Good secondary summary of major Japanese polls; not primary crosstabs.  
- **Facts:** Polls (Jan 27–28) say LDP “favorably positioned,” with **prospect of LDP simple majority** and even “stable majority” (243) within range.  
- **Opinion:** Interpretive language (“within range”), but grounded in poll reporting.

2. NHK World / NHK poll (Jan 26, 2026)  
- **Quality:** High (public broadcaster; clear methodology).  
- **Facts:** Cabinet approval ~59%; dissolution viewed negatively (49% “not appropriate”); electorate priorities (prices).  
- **Opinion:** None; descriptive.  
- **Relevance:** Indirect (approval/issue salience), not a seat forecast.

3. CFR analysis (Jan 28, 2026)  
- **Quality:** High think-tank analysis.  
- **Facts:** Coalition realignment; recent election losses; Takaichi approval ~60–70; Sanseitō pressure, etc.  
- **Opinion:** Interpretations about realignment and issue salience; useful for mechanisms (vote splits, conservative consolidation).

4. nippon.com opinion/analysis (Jan 28, 2026) about “neo-1955” stability unlikely  
- **Quality:** Reasonable commentary.  
- **Facts:** Structural point about Upper House arithmetic and longer-term governance.  
- **Opinion:** Central claim is interpretive; **not** directly about LDP hitting 233 seats in Lower House.

5. CNBC (Jan 30, 2026)  
- **Quality:** Good international journalism; some numeric/contextual inconsistencies can occur.  
- **Facts:** Inflation/wage context; notes Takaichi popularity; expert quotes; turnout conditionality.  
- **Opinion:** Expert takes (Koll/Solís/Govella/Schaap) about “landslide” vs “close race,” turnout sensitivity.

Asknews / Japanese media items (mostly Jan 29–30, 2026) — I treat these as multiple partially independent signals:
6. JNN/TBS early survey (Yahoo Japan, Jan 30)  
- **Quality:** High if it’s JNN election survey; details summarized secondhand here.  
- **Facts:** Says LDP **on track for single-party majority**; coalition could exceed 261.  
- **Opinion:** Analyst commentary about Kōmeitō/Sōka Gakkai voter behavior (mechanism).

7. Mainichi analysis based on poll (Jan 30)  
- **Quality:** High (major newspaper; election desk).  
- **Facts:** LDP could reach ~233; leading in >half of SMDs; PR seats rising; CRA struggling.  
- **Opinion:** Some narrative framing, but anchored to survey.

8. Asahi special survey (Jan 28–29; reported Jan 30)  
- **Quality:** High; but methodology described as large internet panel (bias risk vs phone).  
- **Facts:** LDP “near or above” 233 early; ~46% undecided in SMDs.  
- **Opinion:** Minimal; mainly descriptive.

9. Nikkei/Yomiuri joint poll (Jan 27–28; widely reported incl. Straits Times/Nikkei Asia summaries)  
- **Quality:** High (top-tier pollsters; large-N reporting in multiple outlets).  
- **Facts:** LDP projected **over 233**; language often “majority in sight.”  
- **Opinion:** Interpretations about mandate for fiscal expansion.

10. Pundit segments (Tazaki comments; Jan 30)  
- **Quality:** Low–moderate predictive value; useful as a caution flag.  
- **Facts:** Reports what the early survey says + large undecided share.  
- **Opinion:** “Feels too good to be true” skepticism; I weight lightly.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (moves probability materially upward)
1) **Convergent seat-projection polling across multiple major outlets** (Yomiuri, Nikkei, JNN, Mainichi, Asahi summaries) pointing to **LDP at/above 233**. This is directly tied to the resolution criterion (LDP seat count).  
2) **Status-quo advantage + snap-election timing**: PM called an election when polling is favorable; historically that tends to correlate with winning outcomes (though not determinative).  
3) **Opposition fragmentation/realignment costs** (CRA new brand, reported low name recognition) plausibly increases LDP seat efficiency in SMDs.

Moderate evidence (nudges, not decisive)
4) **Cabinet approval ~59–60%** (NHK and others) supports an LDP-friendly environment, though party support is lower and approval doesn’t map 1:1 to seats.  
5) **High undecided share (20–46% depending on survey)** increases variance; with the threshold at 233, variance matters a lot.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
6) Pundit vibes / rally crowd anecdotes / “momentum” talk.  
7) Macro conditions (inflation, weak yen, real wage declines): relevant, but voters may have already priced this in and it cuts both ways (anti-incumbent vs pro-stimulus).

Key structural caution (pulls probability down)
8) The question is **LDP alone**, and many reports emphasize coalition totals (and sometimes even mention Kōmeitō in error/inconsistently). The most important uncertainty is whether “LDP majority” language is being overstated early and the true central estimate is **just below** 233 with coalition comfortably above.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time to outcome known: **~8 days** (from Feb 1 to after Feb 8 vote / Feb 9 resolution window).  
- With only one week left, big national swings are less likely than months out, but **seat allocation can still move** with late coordination in SMDs and turnout.
- If timeframe were **halved** (4 days to election): I’d expect **slightly less uncertainty**, so I’d move a bit **away from 50–50**—either up if late polls hold, or down if a late story breaks.  
- If timeframe were **doubled** (16 days to election): uncertainty would be higher (more time for gaffes/scandals/coordination), so I’d pull probability **closer to the outside-view base rate**.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view
Outside-view base rate (from your prior work): roughly **mid-to-high 60s (≈65–72%)** for LDP achieving ≥233.

What changes inside-view vs outside-view:
- Since the outside-view writeup, we now have **multiple independent late-January seat projections** (JNN, Mainichi, Asahi, Nikkei/Yomiuri summaries, plus international re-reporting) that consistently put the LDP **at/near/over** the 233 line. That convergence is **strong evidence** and merits an upward update.
- However, the phrasing in several sources is “**near or above**” / “**prospect** of a majority,” which implies the distribution mass is clustered around the threshold. Combined with **large undecided shares**, that argues against pushing to extreme confidence (e.g., 85–90%).
- Net: I update upward modestly from the outside-view midpoint, but keep substantial tail risk of finishing at ~225–232.

Probability calibration
I model this as: polls imply an LDP central estimate modestly above 233, but with meaningful seat error (SMD volatility + PR allocation + undecideds). With a threshold so close to the inferred mean, the chance of falling short remains material.

My inside-view probability that the LDP wins **≥233 seats**: **71%**.

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: “Yes” if **LDP alone ≥233 seats** in Feb 8, 2026 Lower House election (465 seats).  
2) Outside view anchored at ~65–72%. Final stays rooted but adjusted by late polling convergence.  
3) Consistency: **71 out of 100** similar worlds → LDP reaches **233+** seats.  
4) Key evidence (top 4):
   - Yomiuri/Nikkei (Jan 27–28) reported LDP **can reach majority alone**.  
   - JNN/Mainichi/Asahi early surveys also place LDP **near/above 233**.  
   - Cabinet approval around **~60%** supports incumbent performance.  
   - Opposition realignment + low CRA recognition plausibly reduces anti-LDP coordination.  
5) Blind spot: Late-breaking turnout/coordination shock in close SMDs (or polling bias) drops LDP to ~225–232.  
6) Status quo: LDP currently below majority; but status quo of **polling momentum** in final week favors LDP—still, threshold proximity tempers confidence.

Probability: 71%
