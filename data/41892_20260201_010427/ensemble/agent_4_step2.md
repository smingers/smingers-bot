Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality, fact vs opinion, recency)

   Strong polling/seat-projection sources (high quality, late Jan 2026, factual seat numbers, transparent):

   • Yomiuri/Nikkei joint poll 27-28 Jan: telephone + internet n≈296k. Reports LDP “can reach 233, 243 possible”.  
   • Mainichi special poll 28-29 Jan: finds LDP leading in >½ of 289 SMDs, PR vote share ≈70 seats ⇒ majority likely.  
   • JNN (TBS) poll 28-29 Jan: similar seat map; coalition may clear 261; gives SMD detail by region.  
   • Kyodo News survey 27-28 Jan: LDP leads in ≈170 SMDs; 20 % undecided; coalition majority certain, LDP majority “probable”.  
   These four mutually independent, methodologically orthodox outlets are the backbone of the evidence.

   Supplementary factual context (moderate quality):

   • NHK cabinet poll 26 Jan: approval 59 %, confirms Takaichi popularity.  
   • CNBC, CFR, Nippon.com, Asahi opinion pieces: give expert commentary, structural factors (loss of Kōmeitō, short campaign, voter concerns).  

   Opinion / commentary (useful but lower weight):

   • TBS pundit F. Tazaki (“momentum feels too good to be true”).  
   • Nippon.com political-science essay on limits of a “neo-1955” revival.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)

   Strong evidence (moves probability up):

   • Four independent national seat-projection polls all put LDP alone at or above 233 or within ±10 seats.  
   • High leader approval (≈60 %) during a 16-day campaign historically correlates with late swing to incumbents.  
   • Opposition fragmentation: brand-new Centrist Reform Alliance + minor parties split anti-LDP vote in SMDs.

   Moderate evidence (downward pressure):

   • 30-46 % of respondents remain undecided => last-minute volatility plausible.  
   • Loss of Kōmeitō field organization may cost LDP several urban seats; Ishin’s Osaka focus cannot fully replace it.  
   • Two recent elections (2024 LH, 2025 UH) showed voters will punish LDP; therefore rebound is not guaranteed.

   Weak evidence:

   • Weather/turn-out speculation; anecdotal rally crowd sizes; pundit scepticism.

3. Timeframe analysis

   • Resolution in 7 days. Very little time for structural parameters (party alliances, candidate lists) to change.  
   • If time were doubled (14 days) I would widen uncertainty only marginally (+/-3 pp) because campaign is already near the end.  
   • If halved (3-4 days) volatility shrinks further; I would tighten toward the mean (+1 pp).

4. Justification & inside-view adjustment

   Outside-view base rate (post-1996 LH elections) of LDP single-party majorities ≈70 %.  
   Down-adjusted to 43 % in my earlier out-view to reflect 2024 loss and end of Kōmeitō alliance.

   New inside factors:

   + Consistent, high-quality polling shows net LDP gain of 35-50 seats → enough for 233.  
   + Short campaign plus Takaichi’s 60 % approval reduce late-swing risk.  
   – Large undecided bloc and Kōmeitō’s defection introduce real downside tail.  
   – Need for +37 seats means a small polling error (~4 ppt in PR or 10-12 SMD flips) could sink majority.

   Net: shift up by 25 percentage points from 43 % → 68 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that in 68 out of 100 plausible re-runs of the coming week the Liberal Democratic Party secures at least 233 seats on 8 Feb 2026.

Checklist:

1. Resolution: “LDP ≥233 seats in the 465-seat House of Representatives elected 8 Feb 2026.”  
2. Base rate 43 %, updated to 68 % with current polling/structural data.  
3. Consistency line: “68 out of 100 times, the LDP wins a single-party majority.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   a) Four separate late-Jan national seat projections show LDP at/above threshold.  
   b) PM Takaichi’s 60 % approval with 16-day campaign.  
   c) Opposition newly formed, poorly recognized, still fragmented.  
   d) 37-seat gap only; polling margin ≈+40 seats, but undecided >30 %.  
5. Blind spot: coordinated late tactical voting by CRA + Kōmeitō machinery in metro areas swings 20-25 tight SMDs, cutting LDP to ~220.  
6. Status quo drift still favors coalition majority; but single-party line is the knife-edge—hence probability remains well below 80 %.

Probability: 68%
