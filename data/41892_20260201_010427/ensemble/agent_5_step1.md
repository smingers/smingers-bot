Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   • NHK World back-story on 2025 Upper-House election – factual vote totals, turnout and party statements; high-quality public broadcaster.  Relevance: shows the LDP has recently been losing nationwide contests and organisational momentum.  
   • Nippon.com article on the Oct-2024 general election – well-sourced seat counts and exit-poll data; again high reliability.  Key fact: the LDP fell to 191 seats, well short of a solo majority.  
   • IPU PARLINE data on the 2017 general election – official statistics, excellent quality.  Useful as part of a long-run seat/vote time-series.  
   • CFR (Smith & Baylor) 28 Jan 2026 – policy think-tank analysis combining polling, seat history and coalition moves; mostly factual with clearly identified expert commentary.  
   • Mezha relay of Kyodo News seat projection, 29 Jan 2026 – Kyodo’s large-N phone canvass is the Japanese industry benchmark for campaign seat modelling; secondary relay but methodology well established.  Critical numbers: LDP leads in c.170 SMDs and is “likely to exceed 60” proportional seats.  
   • CNBC, 20 Jan 2026 – cites JNN and Nikkei approval polls and expert quotes.  Hard facts: LDP party support ≈30 %, Takaichi personal approval 75 – 78 %.  Opinion segments clearly flagged.  
   • Agent report – compiles the above and adds one Asahi Shimbun vote-intention poll (LDP 29.4 %).  Gives a coherent picture; data points cross-check with original outlets.

2. Reference class analysis  
   Candidate classes:  
   a) All 11 Lower-House elections since the current 465-seat format (1993–2024).  
   b) Elections immediately following an LDP loss of majority (1996 and 2012).  
   c) Elections held ≤12 months after a snap dissolution without Kōmeitō support (only the present case – too narrow).

   Class (a) offers size and comparability: 8/11 times (≈73 %) the LDP has cleared 233 seats on its own.  Class (b) isolates “rebound” cases (2/2 successes, 100 %) but both rebounds benefited from Kōmeitō’s ground game, which the LDP now lacks.  I therefore adopt class (a) as the main baseline, applying downward adjustments for today’s atypical loss of the Kōmeitō vote-transfer machine.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Time to resolution: 7 days.  Last-week swings of ±2-3 % in national vote share have frequently moved 20-40 marginal districts (e.g., 2021, 2017).  
   • Historical pattern: when the LDP’s PR vote share is ≤30 % (1993, 2009, 2024) it has never reached 233 seats.  With 31–35 % it has usually made it (2000, 2003, 2021) but those elections featured Kōmeitō coordination in the SMD tier.

4. Justification  
   Baseline: 73 % (class a).  
   Adjustments (additive logic, rounded to nearest 5 % for transparency before final fine-tuning):  
   • –20 % for sub-30 % vote-intention readings (Asahi 29.4 %, CNBC 29.7 %).  
   • –10 % for the first general election fought without Kōmeitō; past scholarship credits the Kōmeitō ground game with 20-25 SMDs in tight races.  
   • +5 % for the favourable seat arithmetic implied by Kyodo’s first model (170 SMD leads + 60 PR ≈ 230 seats, i.e., very close to the bar).  
   • –5 % to reflect one-fifth of voters still undecided and a historical tendency for late undecideds to drift away from incumbents.  

   Net outside-view estimate = 73 % –20 % –10 % +5 % –5 % = 43 %.

Outside view calibration:
There is one concrete outside tether – Kyodo’s seat arithmetic signalling ~230 seats.  Treating “230 ± 15” as a 1-σ band suggests something like a 40–45 % chance of landing at or above 233.  This aligns closely with the 43 % derived from the historical‐adjustment exercise, providing a cross-check.  Given modest data noise and the 7-day window, I nudge the figure to 42 % to avoid false precision.

Outside View Prediction:
42 % chance that the Liberal Democratic Party will win at least 233 seats (a single-party majority) in the 8 February 2026 Japanese general election.
