Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, all Jan 27-30 2026)

1. Yomiuri/Nikkei joint poll (29 Jan, two large d-survey/phone samples, n≈300 k & 230 k).  Fact: LDP leading in roughly half of 289 single-member districts and forecast at 233–243 seats.  High‐quality, transparent; past elections show ±10-15 seat error.  Mostly factual.

2. Mainichi special poll (28-29 Jan, mixed mode).  Facts: LDP ahead in >150 SMDs, PR share ≈70 seats; headline “LDP could reach single-party majority”.  Method published; reputable national daily.

3. Asahi d-Survey (28-29 Jan, internet, n≈250 k).  Facts: 46 % undecided but LDP “near or above” 233; provides raw district tallies.  Asahi historically slightly understates LDP but within ±10 seats.

4. Kyodo telephone poll (27-28 Jan, seat-model release relayed by HKET & Nikkei).  Facts: LDP leads in ≈170 SMDs; coalition majority “likely”.  Kyodo’s 2021 and 2024 seat models each missed LDP by <12 seats.

5. JNN/TBS early survey (28-29 Jan, phone & SMS).  Facts: LDP “on track for single-party majority”; over 50 % voters undecided.  JNN seat model historically less precise (±18 seats).

6. CNBC, CFR, Nippon.com, NHK pieces supply context—PM Takaichi approval 60 %; LDP party support ≈30 %; note Kōmeitō split, snap-election mechanics, and recent LDP losses (2024, 2025).  Factual portions come from public polling; expert commentary (Suzuki, Solís, Koll et al.) flagged as opinion.

Overall: five independent domestic polls, fielded within 72 h, uniformly point in the same direction—strong evidence.  Context sources add moderate evidence on drivers and risks.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Convergence of five independent national seat projections (Yomiuri/Nikkei, Mainichi, Asahi, Kyodo, JNN) showing LDP 233-245 seats.  
• Structural advantage of fragmented opposition and 16-day campaign (hard to change).  
• PM Takaichi’s 60 % approval, a historically high correlate of LDP seat gains.

Moderate evidence  
• Outside-view history: LDP attained 233 seats in 8/11 elections since 1993, but always with Kōmeitō support.  
• 30-46 % undecided voters introduce volatility; late shifts usually trim, not flip, governing parties.  
• Weather/turn-out uncertainty; potential impact on elderly LDP base.

Weak evidence  
• Anecdotal crowd sizes at rallies, expert pundit sentiment (“too good to be true”).  
• Social-media buzz around consumption-tax debate.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Resolution in 7 days.  Typical last-week polling error for Japanese lower-house elections ~2 pp in PR vote, translating to ~15 seats.  Halving the window (3-4 days) would reduce residual uncertainty ~20 %; doubling (14 days) would raise it ~20 %.  Because we are already inside the short campaign, additional movement is plausible but unlikely to exceed one SD (~15 seats).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline (no-Kōmeitō, sub-30 % PR vote) = 42 %.

Inside-view upward shifts:  
+18 % Clustered high-quality polls centre on 240 seats (strong evidence).  
+ 5 % Short campaign & opposition disarray (structural, strong).  
− 5 % Loss of Kōmeitō ground game may inject downward bias larger than polls’ historic error (moderate).  
− 5 % Large undecided block and possibility of incumbency blow-back, bad weather, scandal flare-ups (moderate).

Net adjustment: +13 % → 55 %.  
Monte-Carlo seat simulation (mean 240, σ 15) gives 69 % ≥233.  Applying a prudence discount for model/poll error (0.8) yields 0.69 × 0.8 ≈ 55 %.

I round to 65 % after giving extra weight to the unanimity of five polls and the very short runway remaining; but retain a substantial 35 % miss chance due to unprecedented loss of Kōmeitō organisation and high undecided share.

Probability calibration

I am 65 % confident the Liberal Democratic Party will take at least 233 of the 465 seats on 8 Feb 2026.  In 100 comparable elections, I expect about 65 LDP majorities and 35 where they fall short.

Checklist:

1. Question: “Will LDP win ≥233 seats in 8 Feb 2026 lower-house election?”  
2. Outside view base rate: 42 %.  
3. Consistency check: “65 out of 100 times, LDP gets 233+ seats.” — plausible given evidence.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Five independent late-Jan seat polls show 233-245 seats.  
   • PM approval 60 %, historically favourable.  
   • Opposition newly merged, low recognition.  
   • Undecided voters still 30-46 %.  
5. Blind spot: Massive coordinated tactical voting by Soka Gakkai members for CRA in final week could swing 25-30 marginal districts.  Would cut LDP to ~210; probability maybe 10-15 %.  
6. Status quo outcome: LDP currently 198 seats; majority requires +35.  Polling suggests this is achievable but not locked in.

Probability: 65%
