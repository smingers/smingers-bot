The forecasting question is:
Will the Liberal Democratic Party win a majority in the 2026 Japanese general election?

Question background:
[General elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Japanese_general_election) are planned for February 8, 2026, to elect the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Japanese parliament. The House of Representatives has 465 seats, so 233 are needed for a majority.

The [Liberal Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_\(Japan\)) (LDP) has been the senior partner or sole party in government [almost continuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_System) since its founding in 1955. The party is currently led by [Sanae Takaichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanae_Takaichi).

The LDP suffered its second worst electoral result ever in the [2024 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_general_election), falling short of a majority even together with its traditional coalition partner [Komeito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komeito). Since Takaichi took the reins, however, approval of the LDP and Takaichi herself [has surged](https://www.ft.com/content/0d19bc73-b82c-4764-9785-661e8dbd49e0). To capitalize on this, a snap election [has been called](https://www.ft.com/content/5d6de78f-10a0-4883-8437-c05b9562ab37) for February 8, 2026.
