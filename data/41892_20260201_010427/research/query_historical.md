Analysis:
The key to an outside-view forecast is understanding (a) the LDP’s long-run dominance, (b) recent exceptions when it failed to secure an outright majority, (c) how pre-election polls translate into seats under Japan’s mixed electoral system, and (d) current February-2026 polling/seat projections since the snap election was only called a few weeks ago.  
Therefore I need:  
• Historical seat totals for the LDP in the last several elections, especially 2024 (second-worst result) and the few elections when it missed a majority (1993, 2009, 2024).  
• Recent nationwide voter-intention polls and seat-projection models after Sanae Takaichi became PM (mid-2025) and in January 2026.  
• Analyses of approval ratings and reasons for the reported “surge” to gauge staying power.  
• Expert commentary on whether coalition partner Komeito will split votes or whether tactical nominations help LDP win SMD districts.
