The LDP's projected gains\u2014rising from 198 seats before the election\u2014suggest a significant increase, with political analyst Masahiko Ichisawa of TBS Television's Election Headquarters noting that the LDP's proportional representation seats are likely to rise substantially. This surge is attributed to high approval ratings for Prime Minister K\u014dji's cabinet, which is seen as a key driver of the LDP's momentum. The LDP, along with its coalition partner Japan Innovation Party (34 seats), is projected to exceed the 'absolute stable majority' of 261 seats, enabling the ruling coalition to dominate committee leadership and committee membership, ensuring smoother legislative operations\u2014a situation not seen since the 2021 election under Prime Minister Kishida. Meanwhile, the opposition landscape shows a significant decline for centrist parties. The survey indicates the 'Centrist Reform Coalition,' formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and K\u014dmeit\u014d, faces a challenging outlook, with the Communist Party likely to lose many seats and the National Democratic Party in a precarious position. The key determinant of the coalition's success, according to Ichisawa, will be the voting behavior of K\u014dmeit\u014d's support base, whose shift could dramatically influence the final outcome.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/133bbb2d2cf472fde68a10376b39de0062ac7ae7)\n\n**JNN Survey Reveals LDP Aiming for Absolute Stable Majority in House of Representatives Election; Key Kansai Battlegrounds in Focus**\nAccording to a JNN survey conducted on January 28 and 29, 2026, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is on track to significantly increase its seats in the House of Representatives, aiming for a single-party majority. The LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, are projected to exceed the 'absolute stable majority' threshold of 261 seats, which would allow the ruling coalition to dominate all standing committees in the Diet\u2014not only by appointing committee chairs but also by securing a majority of committee members. This would strengthen the ruling bloc\u2019s ability to advance legislation and budgets. The opposition 'Centrist Reform Coalition,' formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and K\u014dmeit\u014d, is expected to fall well below its pre-election total. Other parties face varied outcomes: the Nippon Minshut\u014d is uncertain about maintaining its current seats, the Japanese Communist Party is projected to lose seats from its current 8, the S\u014dseit\u014d is expected to gain significantly in proportional representation, Team Mirai is likely to win seats in multiple proportional blocks, and Shinken Nihon and Y\u016bkoku Renr\u014d may secure multiple seats. However, Reiwa Shinsengumi, Nihon Hoshush\u016bt\u014d, and the Social Democratic Party face significant challenges in winning seats.

Takaichi, who has maintained over 60% approval since taking office in October 2025, is seen as a unifying figure whose popularity may draw back conservative voters who previously defected to the emerging conservative party, the Komeito. Media analyses from major outlets including Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei, and Yomiuri Shimbun suggest the LDP could secure a majority of seats on its own, surpassing the previous benchmark of a parliamentary majority for the ruling coalition. However, concerns are emerging within the LDP about overconfidence, with party officials urging discipline and caution, warning against complacency. Meanwhile, opposition parties, particularly the newly formed 'Centrist Reform Alliance' (a coalition of the main opposition and Komeito), face challenges due to fragmented anti-government votes and lack of early public visibility. Some opposition figures anticipate a late surge in momentum, but media projections suggest the alliance may lose seats. The LDP\u2019s general secretary, Junichi Suzuki, issued a statement emphasizing that 'the real campaign has just begun' and urging the party to treat every day as a voting day.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:27 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260130_0003496537)\n\n**LDP Expected to Increase Japan Lower House Seats While CRA Struggles: Mainichi Analysis**\nAccording to a Mainichi Shimbun analysis based on a special opinion poll conducted January 28\u201329, 2026, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to significantly increase its seats in the February 8, 2026, House of Representatives election, potentially reaching a single-party majority of 233 seats\u2014up from the preannouncement count of 198. The LDP is leading in over half of the 289 single-seat constituencies and is gaining ground in urban areas like Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, where it previously struggled. It is also poised to exceed its previous 59 proportional representation seats. The LDP\u2019s coalition partner, Nippon Ishin (JIP), faces challenges outside Osaka Prefecture, where it leads in 17 of 19 districts but lacks broader influence. The new Centrist Reform Alliance (CRA), formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) and Komeito, is struggling to gain traction, with projections indicating it will fall below its pre-election count of 167 seats. The CRA\u2019s proportional representation seats are expected to be in the 40s to 50s, below the combined 64 seats previously held by the CDP and Komeito. The Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) is projected to maintain its preannouncement count of 27 seats. The Japanese Communist Party is expected to drop below its pre-election count of eight seats, possibly to half. Reiwa Shinsengumi is projected to lose its eight seats, and the Tax Cuts Japan-Patriotic Alliance may lose its five. Sanseito is expected to increase from two to seven or eight seats, and Team Mirai, which held no seats previously, is likely to secure multiple seats.

According to a JNN early survey, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to gain significantly in seats, potentially securing a majority, while a coalition of the LDP and Komeito could achieve an 'absolute stable majority' of over 261 seats. Meanwhile, the centrist coalition 'Ch\u016bd\u014d Kaikaku Renraku' is expected to lose substantial ground from its pre-election 172 seats, while the Constitutional Democratic Party's seat retention is uncertain. The Japanese Communist Party is projected to lose seats from its current 8, while the S\u014dseikaku Party is expected to gain significantly in proportional representation, and Team Mirai is also projected to win multiple seats in proportional blocks. Rerwa Shinsh\u016bnt\u014d, Nihon Hosh\u016bt\u014d, and the Social Democratic Party are seen as facing difficult prospects. However, over half of respondents indicated they had not yet decided their vote, suggesting the situation could shift significantly. When asked about the lack of strong public evaluation of the 'centrist' bloc, Tazaki noted that the concept and ideology of 'centrism' remain unclear.

According to Professor Miki Iyanagi of Shizuoka University, the key question in this election is whether the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will secure a single-party majority to enable free policy implementation, or continue governing through coalition with opposition parties. The central focus is whether the LDP can reclaim its traditional supporters from conservative parties like the Komeito and the Shinto Party, especially under the popularity and policy direction of Prime Minister Sanae Higashi. In Shizuoka Prefecture, the 7th district features candidates from the LDP, Komeito, and Shinto Party, drawing close attention. The performance of the centrist reform coalition\u2014formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito\u2014will also be crucial, particularly in district 6 where the LDP and the coalition\u2019s candidate are in a tight race, with public attention on the impact of Komeito\u2019s voter base. Nationally, the main issue is consumption tax reduction to combat inflation, though the LDP\u2019s proposal for temporary tax cuts on food and beverages has diminished its political impact. In Shizuoka, the controversy over falsified seismic data at Chubu Electric Power\u2019s Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant (in Omaezaki City) has reignited debate over restarts. While the Communist Party has fielded a candidate opposing restarts in district 3, safety concerns are widely acknowledged, making the issue less distinct. Due to the short campaign period, new candidates are particularly vulnerable to party momentum and name recognition, giving an advantage to strong party-backed candidates and well-known local figures. However, recent local mayoral elections in Shizuoka have seen conservative candidates lose to reform-oriented challengers, suggesting growing voter demand for change. The extent to which this reform sentiment translates into the general election is a key point of observation.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:13 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/2279574662c2bae33373dec4057a5b538e63e68f)\n\n**Early Election Outlook: LDP Aims for Majority as Super-Short Campaign Begins**\nThe Asahi Shimbun conducted a special public opinion survey on January 28\u201329, 2026, to assess the early political landscape of the upcoming House of Representatives election. The election is described as a 'super-short campaign' lasting only 16 days from dissolution to voting. The survey indicates that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to significantly increase its seats from 198 before the announcement to near or above the 233-seat majority threshold, driven by high approval ratings for Prime Minister Sanae Takagi. The LDP leads in over half of the 289 single-member constituencies. The Komeito party, a coalition partner, is expected to maintain its 34 seats, with strength concentrated in Osaka but limited elsewhere. Together, the ruling coalition is projected to surpass the 233-seat majority mark by a wide margin. The centrist reform coalition, formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito, is expected to fall below its previous 167 seats. Other parties show mixed trends: the Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Innovation Party) is expected to hold steady, while the Communist Party, Reiwa Shinsengumi, and Tax Reduction Japan\u2013Y\u016bkoku Renmei are projected to lose seats. The Sanka Party is expected to gain seats, and the new party Team Mirai, previously without seats in the House, may win multiple seats. The survey also found that 46% of respondents in single-member districts had not yet decided their vote, indicating significant potential for change in the final outcome.

The election is described as a 'super-short campaign' lasting only 16 days from dissolution to voting. The survey indicates that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), benefiting from high approval ratings for Prime Minister Sanae Takagi\u2019s cabinet, is projected to increase from 198 to near or above the 233-seat majority threshold, leading in over half of the 289 single-member districts. The Komeito party, which forms a coalition with the LDP, is expected to maintain its 34 pre-election seats, with strongholds in Osaka but limited national reach. As a result, the ruling coalition is projected to exceed the 233-seat majority target significantly. The centrist reform alliance, formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito, is expected to fall below its pre-election 167 seats due to limited support.

Polls indicate the LDP could secure a single-party majority or, combined with the Komeito Party, achieve an 'absolute stable majority' in the House of Representatives. Takaichi's personal appeal has driven strong public interest, with campaign flyers bearing her image quickly distributed, and rallies drawing thousands\u2014comparable to concert crowds. Even former Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi, once seen as critical of Takaichi, publicly endorsed her policies. In proportional representation voting, the LDP leads with over 35% support, followed by the 'Center-Right Reform Coalition' (Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito) at around 20%. The LDP is projected to regain about 70 proportional seats\u2014close to its 2021 level of single-party majority. Analysts cite a 'return of conservative votes' as conservative voters, previously drawn to parties like the Party of Hope or the Nippon Ishin no Kai due to the LDP\u2019s perceived liberal tilt under Shigeru Ishiba, are returning to the LDP under Takaichi\u2019s emphasis on fiscal expansion, conservative values, and constitutional revision. Kyodo News forecasts the LDP and Komeito could surpass the majority threshold; if the LDP wins in competitive districts, it may achieve a single-party majority. The LDP leads in over half of the 289 single-member districts, especially in conservative strongholds like Ch\u016bgoku, Kyushu, and Kumamoto, where it may win all seats. In contrast, the center-left coalition faces challenges due to the new party\u2019s short history, low public recognition of its 'People First' platform, and uncertainty about Soka Gakkai\u2019s full support for the coalition. The Yomiuri and Mainichi report that the LDP\u2019s dominance in traditional strongholds like Hokkaido (9\u20133) and T\u014dhoku (12\u20139) has weakened, with few strong candidates, suggesting the coalition may fall below the 167-seat projection, possibly dropping below 100 total seats. Other parties: Komeito remains competitive in Kansai but weak in proportional voting; the Party of Hope remains stable; the Party of Hope is seen as a 'proportional dark horse' with seats expected to rise from 3 to 7\u201310; the new party 'Future Team' is gaining traction among youth and urban voters, with a strong chance of entering the House of Representatives for the first time.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/paper/1741960)\n\n**LDP Aims for Single-Majority in Japan's Upcoming General Election Amid High Approval for Prime Minister Takagi**\nJapan's upcoming general election on January 8, 2026, is expected to result in a significant gain for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), with strong indications that it may achieve a single-party majority in the House of Representatives. The LDP, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takagi, maintains a high approval rating of around 60%, contributing to its strong position. According to a Yomiuri Shimbun survey of approximately 296,000 respondents conducted on January 27\u201328, the LDP is projected to secure over 233 of the 465 total seats\u2014exceeding the 233-seat threshold for a majority. The party is expected to win about half of the 289 single-member constituencies and secure over 70 seats in the proportional representation bloc, similar to its performance in the 2021 general election. With the LDP and its coalition partner, the Komeito Party, potentially achieving an 'absolute stable majority' of 261 seats, the ruling coalition would control all standing committee chairmanships and a majority of committee seats, giving it significant legislative advantage. In contrast, the new centrist coalition 'Center Reform Alliance'\u2014formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito\u2014faces a decline from 167 to around 100 seats. The Yomiuri Shimbun attributes the LDP's strength to the return of conservative voters who had defected during former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's administration, the strong conservative leadership of Prime Minister Takagi, and the lack of notable success by opposition parties in single-member districts. A separate survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun also forecasts the LDP securing a single majority and potentially reaching 243 seats, though it predicts the Komeito may lose seats in proportional representation. The Kyodo News also reported that the LDP and Komeito combined could secure a majority, with the possibility of a single LDP majority if support continues to grow. However, about 20% of voters have not yet decided their candidate, leaving room for last-minute shifts. Prime Minister Takagi officially declared on January 23 that securing a majority for both the LDP and Komeito was the goal of the upcoming election.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 11:52 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/jp/jp-international/2026/01/29/BFBEEPJZKBAKFLEGJGADBJEZJY/)\n\n**Liberal Democratic Party Poised for Single-Party Majority in Japan's General Election**\nThe Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan is poised to secure a single-party majority in the upcoming House of Representatives general election on February 8, 2026, according to multiple surveys and analyses. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's cabinet maintains a high approval rating of approximately 60%, which is fueling strong conservative voter support. A Yomiuri Shimbun survey of 296,000 respondents from January 27\u201328 projected the LDP\u2014currently holding 198 seats\u2014could gain at least 233 seats, surpassing the 233-seat threshold needed for a majority in the 465-seat House. The LDP leads in nearly half of the 289 single-member districts and is projected to win around 70 proportional representation seats, similar to 2021. Combined with its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, the ruling bloc could achieve an 'absolute stable majority' of 261 seats, enabling control over all standing committee chair positions and legislative advantages. In contrast, the newly formed Moderate Reform Alliance\u2014formed by the former Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito Party\u2014is expected to lose seats, dropping from 167 to around 100. The Nikkei Shimbun survey (232,000 respondents) projected a potential LDP majority of 243 seats, though the Japan Innovation Party may underperform in proportional seats, possibly falling below its current 34. Key factors cited include the return of conservative voters from Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s administration, Takaichi\u2019s consolidation of power as a hardline conservative, and the opposition\u2019s failure to translate momentum from last year\u2019s upper house election into single-member district gains. Kyodo News noted that while the LDP and Japan Innovation Party are likely to secure a majority in initial race dynamics, approximately 20% of voters remain undecided, leaving room for final shifts. On January 23, Prime Minister Takaichi announced the early dissolution of the House and set the goal of securing a majority for the LDP and Japan Innovation Party.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 11:32 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/world-en/2026/01/29/7TYQEJHPZJETPPS7DJQZVLNJAM/)\n\n**Japan General Election: Polls Suggest LDP May Win Majority Amid Focus on Consumption Tax and Inflation**\nA recent survey by Kyodo News, conducted from January 27 to 28, 2026, indicates that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Japan Innovation Party may secure a majority of seats in the upcoming general election, with the LDP potentially winning over 233 seats\u2014exceeding the 233-seat threshold needed for a majority in Japan's 465-member House of Representatives. The LDP leads in approximately 170 of 289 constituencies and maintains strong proportional representation support. The Innovation Party's support has grown only slightly outside Osaka, and may not retain its previous 34 seats. The 'Centrist Reform Coalition,' formed by Komeito and the Constitutional Democratic Party, is underperforming, leading in only 80 constituencies and likely falling short of its previous 167 seats. Meanwhile, emerging political parties are projected to gain significantly. Social media analysis by Brandwatch revealed that discussions on consumption tax and inflation dominated online discourse on X (formerly Twitter), with about 330,000 posts related to these topics between January 9 and 25, 2026. The LDP's proposal to temporarily exempt food from the 8% consumption tax for two years sparked significant online debate, with some praising the move and others questioning its consistency with earlier statements by LDP leadership and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who had previously argued that reforming the tax system would take time. The 'Centrist Reform Coalition's' proposal to fully abolish the food consumption tax also generated considerable public attention.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 06:49 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/4076854/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%A4%A7%E9%81%B8%EF%BD%9C%E6%B0%91%E8%AA%BF%E6%96%99%E8%87%AA%E6%B0%91%E9%BB%A8%E6%88%96%E5%8F%96%E9%81%8E%E5%8D%8A%E8%AD%B0%E5%B8%AD%20%E6%B6%88%E8%B2%BB%E7%A8%85%E5%8F%8A%E9%80%9A%E8%84%B9%E6%88%90%E7%84%A6%E9%BB%9E)\n\n**Japan's House of Representatives Election Outlook: LDP May Secure Majority in Upcoming Vote**\nA preliminary survey by Nikkei News released on January 29, 2026, indicates that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takagi, may win a majority of seats in the upcoming House of Representatives election on February 8, 2026, potentially securing a majority without coalition partners. Takagi has stated that if the ruling coalition fails to gain a majority, she will resign immediately. The early dissolution of the House of Representatives was aimed at securing greater authority to advance her expansionary fiscal policies, sparking market concerns over increased bond issuance and a subsequent rise in bond yields. Prior to the dissolution, the LDP and Japan Innovation Party coalition held 233 of 465 seats in the House, meeting the minimum threshold for a majority. However, the LDP remains a minority party in the House of Councillors. The survey, based on combined data from Nikkei News and Yomiuri Shimbun's joint poll conducted from January 27 to 28, 2026, suggests the LDP may win over 233 seats, up from its current 198 seats. The Kyodo News agency estimates the ruling coalition will secure a majority. However, the LDP has faced criticism for allowing over 40 candidates linked to a political secret funding scandal to run in the election, despite internal disciplinary actions. The Asahi Shimbun reported that the final list of confirmed candidates included more than 40 individuals involved in the scandal, many of whom were barred from running in the 2024 general election. The Tokyo Shimbun criticized Prime Minister Takagi for failing to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the scandal and for not pushing for fundamental political reforms, stating such actions undermine public trust in politics, which is foundational for policy-making.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:50 AM\nSource:[\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u62a5](https://www.sinchew.com.my/news/20260129/international/7226967)\n\n**Preliminary Election Survey in Japan: LDP May Secure Majority Alone**\nA preliminary survey by Nikkei Chinese, conducted from January 27\u201328, 2026, on the upcoming February 8, 2026, Japanese House of Representatives election, projects that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may secure over half of the 465 total seats\u2014233 or more\u2014up from its current 198 seats. The LDP is expected to gain over 70 seats in the 176 proportional representation districts, surpassing its 59 seats from 2024. In the 289 single-member districts, the LDP has 'high likelihood' of winning in nearly 40% of them, with strongholds in Yamaguchi, Tokushima, and Kumamoto prefectures. Over 150 districts feature intense competition, with the LDP holding 'advantage' in about 100 and 'possibility of victory' in over 50, many of which are closely contested. The LDP aims for a 'stable majority' of 243 seats to control all standing committees. Prime Minister Sanae Takagi (LDP President) has set 'a majority for the ruling party' as the electoral benchmark. The LDP currently holds 198 seats, and with the Komeito party at 34, the total is 232\u2014just one short of a majority. Internal LDP discussions are pushing for an 'exclusive majority' (233+). The 'Center-Right Reform Coalition' (composed of Constitutional Democratic Party and Komeito) is projected to lose ground, possibly falling below 100 seats. In single-member districts, the coalition has 'high likelihood' of winning in only a few, 'advantage' in about 40, and 'possibility' in around 100. In proportional districts, it may win about 40 seats.

The LDP is expected to increase its seats from 198 to over 233 out of 465 available, surpassing the majority threshold. This projection comes after Takaichi called a snap election to gain public mandate for her expansionary fiscal policy, which has already caused a spike in bond yields due to market concerns over increased government debt issuance. The LDP currently governs in coalition with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), which together hold a narrow majority in the lower house but are a minority in the upper house.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Current Projections and Polling Data**\n- **Majority threshold**: The LDP needs **233 seats** for a single-party majority in the 465-seat House of Representatives. [14][15][19]\n- **Latest polls (late January 2026)**:\n  - Mainichi Shimbun analysis projects LDP gaining **~233 seats** (up from 198), likely achieving a majority. [6][8]\n  - Nikkei/Yomiuri joint poll shows LDP leading in **~40% of single-member districts** (150+ of 289), with proportional representation potentially pushing them past 233 seats. [11][13]\n  - Kyodo News survey indicates LDP coalition (with Japan Innovation Party) securing **233+ seats**. [11]\n- **Coalition strength**: The ruling bloc (LDP + Japan Innovation Party) may reach **~261 seats**, exceeding the \"absolute stable majority\" threshold. [6][9]\n\n### 2. **Key Factors Driving LDP Momentum**\n- **Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's popularity**: Her approval ratings (60-70%) are driving LDP support, despite the party's own ratings hovering near 30%. [5][10][12]\n- **Opposition fragmentation**: The new Centrist Reform Alliance (CRA), formed by Komeito and the Constitutional Democratic Party, is struggling to consolidate support. Polls show it falling **below 167 pre-election seats**. [6][8][11]\n- **Strategic advantages**: \n  - The **short 12-16 day campaign** (shortest in postwar history) favors the incumbent. [3][14][16]\n  - LDP is gaining ground in urban areas (e.g., Tokyo) where it previously underperformed. [6]\n\n### 3. **Risks and Uncertainties**\n- **Undecided voters**: 30-46% of voters remain uncommitted, leaving room for shifts. [4][7][8][11]\n- **Weather and turnout**: A historic cold snap could suppress turnout, particularly affecting older LDP bases. [5][10]\n- **Key battlegrounds**: The LDP faces tight races in regions like Hokkaido and Yamaguchi due to Komeito's withdrawal from their coalition. [1][4]\n- **Takaichi's ultimatum**: She pledged to resign if the LDP fails to secure a majority, adding high-stakes pressure. [14][16]\n\n### 4. **Opposition Challenges**\n- The Centrist Reform Alliance (CRA) suffers from low name recognition, internal divisions, and vote-splitting in **170 districts**. [11]\n- Smaller parties (e.g., Japanese Communist Party, Reiwa Shinsengumi) are projected to lose seats. [6][8]\n\n### 5. **Broader Context**\n- This snap election (called January 2026) aims to legitimize Takaichi's fragile coalition after Komeito's exit. [5][10][17]\n- Key issues include inflation relief, defense posture (e.g., Taiwan contingency stance), and Takaichi's \"expansionary fiscal policy\". [11][13][20]\n\n### Conclusion\n**The LDP is favored to win a majority based on current polling**, with projections consistently showing them at or above the 233-seat threshold. However, the large pool of undecided voters and extreme weather introduce volatility. If trends hold, the LDP will likely secure a mandate\u2014but falling short would trigger Takaichi's resignation per her public pledge. [6][11][14][15]\n\n**Sources**: Polls by Nikkei [11][12][13], Mainichi [6][8], Kyodo [11], and JNN [7]; seat data from Diet records [14][19]; context from Asahi [3][8] and international outlets [5][10][17].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
