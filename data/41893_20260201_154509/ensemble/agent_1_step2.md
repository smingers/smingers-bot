**Key Factual Consensus from Sources:**
1. Official campaign period starts Feb 16, election March 5 (32 days away)
2. NC-UML formed alliance for National Assembly but no announcement of House alliance
3. Newly merged Nepali Communist Party won 0/18 National Assembly seats despite being second-largest party
4. RSP showing strong urban performance (Kathmandu constituencies)
5. 18.9 million voters, high youth engagement expected
6. No opinion polling data available

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **National Assembly Results (Jan 25, 2026):** Multiple independent sources confirm NC-UML alliance won 17/17 contested seats while NCP won 0/18. This demonstrates:
   - NC and UML can coordinate effectively when aligned
   - NCP merger has not translated to electoral effectiveness (at least in indirect elections)
   - Current organizational strength hierarchy: NC > UML >> NCP
   - **Causal mechanism:** Electoral college voting rewards party discipline and alliance coordination; NCP's failure suggests internal coordination problems or weak support among local/provincial officials
   - **Direction:** Strongly favors NC and UML over NCP

2. **Mixed Electoral System Mechanics:** Historical pattern across 2017 and 2022 shows FPTP tier systematically advantages parties with broad geographic organization:
   - 2017: Left alliance converted 47% PR votes → 63% seats
   - 2022: Without alliance, NC/UML with ~30% each won more seats than vote share suggests
   - **Structural factor:** 165 FPTP seats create winner-take-all dynamics difficult to overcome without local infrastructure
   - **Direction:** Strongly favors NC and UML, disadvantages RSP and NCP

3. **No Pre-Election Alliance Announced:** Unlike National Assembly, no major alliance announced for House elections with 32 days remaining. Historical precedent:
   - 2017: Alliance announced well in advance, dominated results
   - 2022: No major alliance, fragmented results
   - **Causal mechanism:** FPTP coordination requires advance planning; absence suggests parties competing independently
   - **Direction:** Reduces probability of overwhelming single-party victory, increases competitive balance between NC and UML

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Urban-Rural Divide in RSP Performance:** 
   - 2023 by-elections: RSP won landslides in urban Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1
   - Kathmandu-6: RSP incumbent won 14,221 votes in 2022
   - Makwanpur-1: Population grew from 124,799 to 158,435 due to urbanization
   - **Logical link:** Urbanization + youth protests → RSP gains in cities
   - **Limitation:** Only 2 by-elections, unclear if pattern holds nationally
   - **Direction:** Moderately favors RSP improvement over 2022 baseline, but organizational limits in rural FPTP seats remain

2. **Youth Demographic and Protest Impact:**
   - 52% of 18.9M voters aged 18-40
   - September 2025 protests: 72+ deaths, toppled government
   - High youth voter registration activity reported
   - **Logical link:** Protest trauma + youth demographics → anti-establishment voting
   - **Limitation:** Youth turnout historically lower; unclear if protest translates to votes
   - **Direction:** Moderately favors RSP, moderately harms traditional parties

3. **Campaign Dynamics - Jhapa-5 Symbolism:**
   - Balen (RSP) challenging Oli (UML) in his stronghold
   - Oli won 52,000+ votes with 28,000 margin in 2022
   - High-profile contest drawing national attention
   - **Logical link:** If Balen wins Oli's seat, signals broader RSP momentum
   - **Limitation:** Single constituency, may not be representative
   - **Direction:** Indicator of RSP ceiling; if Balen loses despite national profile, confirms organizational limits

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Party Official Claims:** UML's Bhattarai claiming "easy victory" in Jhapa-5, Gagan Thapa claiming NC is "newest party" - partisan statements with no predictive value

2. **Unnamed Expert Predictions:** Asia-Pacific analysis predicting "left-wing dominance" without methodology or attribution - speculative

3. **Voter Concern Reporting:** Parbat voters raising unemployment/corruption concerns - anecdotal, doesn't indicate voting intention

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 32 days until March 5, 2026 election (from Feb 1)

**If Halved (16 days):**
- Official campaign period (Feb 16-March 2) would barely begin
- Less time for RSP to overcome organizational disadvantages
- Incumbent parties' existing infrastructure more decisive
- **Impact:** Would increase NC/UML combined probability by ~5-8%, decrease RSP/NCP proportionally

**If Doubled (64 days):**
- Full campaign cycle completed, allowing RSP to build organization
- More time for youth mobilization to materialize
- More time for potential NC-UML alliance negotiations
- **Impact:** Uncertainty increases both ways - either RSP gains momentum OR traditional parties form alliance. Net effect: spread probability more evenly (+3-5% to RSP, -3-5% from NC)

**Current 32-day Window Assessment:**
- Official campaign starts Feb 16 (15 days from now)
- Only 17 days of active campaigning before 48-hour silence
- Insufficient time for major organizational buildout
- Favors parties with existing infrastructure (NC, UML)

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Baseline (from 2022 results):**
- NC: 32% of seats (89/275)
- UML: 28% of seats (78/275)
- Maoist Centre: 12% of seats (32/275)
- RSP: 7% of seats (20/275)

**Major Adjustments:**

1. **NC: 32% → 42% (+10 points)**
   - **Strong evidence:** National Assembly dominance (9/18 seats) demonstrates current organizational superiority
   - **Strong evidence:** Youth rebranding under Gagan Thapa addresses protest backlash
   - **Moderate evidence:** No alliance means NC's slight edge over UML (vs. 2022 parity) becomes decisive
   - **Justification:** The National Assembly result is a recent, direct test of party organizational strength. NC's victory there, combined with successful leadership transition, suggests they've adapted better to post-protest environment than UML.

2. **UML: 28% → 26% (-2 points)**
   - **Strong evidence:** National Assembly performance (8/18) slightly weaker than NC
   - **Weak evidence:** Oli's personal unpopularity from protests (he was toppled PM)
   - **Moderate evidence:** High-profile Jhapa-5 challenge from Balen creates vulnerability perception
   - **Justification:** UML retains strong organization but Oli's baggage and slightly weaker National Assembly showing suggest marginal disadvantage vs. NC. Small decrease reflects this.

3. **Nepali Communist Party: 12% → 18% (+6 points)**
   - **Strong evidence (negative):** 0/18 National Assembly performance is catastrophic
   - **Moderate evidence (positive):** Merger combines 2022 Maoist (32 seats) + Unified Socialist (10 seats) + smaller parties
   - **Strong evidence (negative):** Mixed electoral system punishes organizational weakness
   - **Justification:** The merger SHOULD help (hence increase from 12%), but National Assembly disaster suggests serious coordination problems. Increase is modest because organizational failure in indirect elections may predict FPTP struggles. The +6 reflects merger arithmetic partially offset by execution concerns.

4. **RSP: 7% → 11% (+4 points)**
   - **Moderate evidence:** Urban by-election dominance in 2023
   - **Moderate evidence:** Youth demographic (52% aged 18-40) and protest momentum
   - **Strong evidence (negative):** FPTP system requires local infrastructure RSP lacks
   - **Moderate evidence:** High-profile candidates (Balen) create visibility
   - **Justification:** RSP should improve on 2022 debut given protest context and youth energy, but organizational limits in FPTP tier prevent major breakthrough. The +4 reflects genuine momentum constrained by structural barriers.

5. **Other parties (RPP, etc.): Minimal changes**
   - RPP won 14 seats in 2022; no evidence of major momentum
