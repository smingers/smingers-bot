Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Hindu (January 26, 2026):** Factual report on National Assembly election results showing Nepali Congress won 9 seats, CPN-UML won 8 seats. High-quality mainstream source reporting completed election results. However, this concerns the upper house, not the House of Representatives that is the subject of our question.

**Rising Nepal Daily (January 31, 2026):** Economic impact piece noting the March 5, 2026 election date and increased business activity. Primarily anecdotal with business leader quotes about economic effects. Limited forecasting value but confirms election timing.

**Xinhua (January 26, 2026):** Factual reporting on National Assembly results, noting the NC-UML alliance succeeded while the newly merged Nepali Communist Party won zero seats in the upper house. Reliable state news agency providing factual election results.

**Nepal News (October 24, 2025):** Reports the impending merger of CPN-Maoist Centre and CPN-Unified Socialist before November 16, 2025, to form a unified party for the March 2026 elections. Factual reporting of party developments. Key fact: the merger did occur (confirmed by later sources).

**Grand Pinnacle Tribune (undated, covering events through November 2025):** Reports that ten leftist parties merged on November 5, 2025 to form the Nepali Communist Party, with Prachanda as coordinator. Includes direct quotes from party leaders. The article notes critics question whether all merging groups have significant grassroots support.

**Jacobin (September 2025):** Heavily ideological analysis of the Gen Z protests from a leftist perspective. Provides useful factual timeline (72 deaths, thousands injured, Oli government fell, interim PM appointed, elections scheduled for March 5, 2026) but opinions are from a specific political viewpoint rather than neutral expert analysis.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis noting the absence of opinion polling in Nepal. Key factual findings:
- 2023 by-elections showed RSP landslides in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1
- 2022 results: NC 29.3% PR vote/89 seats; UML 30.7%/78 seats; Maoist 12.7%/32 seats; RSP 12.2%/20 seats
- 2017 results: UML-Maoist alliance converted 47% of votes into 63% of seats
- 18.9 million registered voters, 52% aged 18-40
- Gen Z protests in September 2025 killed 70+, toppled government
- No pre-election alliance between NC and UML for March 2026

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Nepal's previous House of Representatives elections (2017, 2022):** Most directly relevant. Same electoral system (165 FPTP + 110 PR seats), same major parties, same institutional context. However, 2025 Gen Z protests represent a significant discontinuity.

2. **Nepali elections following major political disruptions:** 2008 elections after monarchy abolition; 2013 elections after Maoist decline. These show how dramatic events can reshape party systems, though each had unique circumstances.

3. **South Asian elections following youth-led uprisings:** Bangladesh 2024-25, Sri Lanka 2022. Shows regional pattern of anti-establishment sentiment, but different party systems and contexts limit direct comparability.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Nepal's 2022 House of Representatives election, adjusted for the impact of the 2025 Gen Z protests and the left-party merger. The 2022 election provides the most recent baseline under the same electoral rules, while the 2023 by-elections and 2025 political developments indicate directional shifts.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 33 days from February 1, 2026 to March 5, 2026 (election day), with results determined shortly thereafter.

**Historical Patterns:**
- **2022 election:** NC won most seats (89) despite UML having higher PR vote share (30.7% vs 29.3%). Mixed electoral system created divergence between vote share and seat count.
- **2017 election:** UML-Maoist alliance dominated with 174 combined seats (63% of total) on ~47% of votes, showing how pre-election coordination multiplies FPTP gains.
- **2023 by-elections:** RSP won decisive victories in urban/semi-urban constituencies (Chitwan-2, Tanahun-1), suggesting growing strength but from a small base.

**Key Pattern:** In Nepal's mixed system, FPTP performance matters more than PR vote share for determining the largest party. Candidate quality, local organization, and vote-splitting among competitors significantly impact outcomes.

## (d) Justification

**Baseline from 2022 Results:**
- Nepali Congress: 89 seats (32%)
- CPN-UML: 78 seats (28%)
- Maoist Centre: 32 seats (12%)
- RSP: 20 seats (7%)

**Adjustments for 2026:**

**Factors Favoring Nepali Congress:**
1. Won most seats in 2022 despite slightly lower PR vote share
2. Strong FPTP machinery and candidate-centric voting (e.g., Gagan Thapa's personal appeal)
3. Successfully contested 2026 National Assembly elections in alliance with UML, showing organizational strength
4. Elected younger leadership (Gagan Thapa, 49) to respond to Gen Z sentiment
5. Historically resilient across multiple electoral cycles

**Factors Favoring CPN-UML:**
1. Highest PR vote share in 2022 (30.7%)
2. Deep rural networks and organizational capacity
3. Successful National Assembly performance
4. Second-largest party in 2022

**Factors Favoring Nepali Communist Party (merged entity):**
1. Combined 2022 baseline: Maoist 32 + Unified Socialist ~10 = ~42 seats
2. Unified campaign should reduce left vote-splitting
3. However: Zero seats won in January 2026 National Assembly elections raises serious questions about organizational effectiveness
4. Critics note some merging parties lack grassroots support
5. Lost significant credibility after being blamed for Gen Z protest crackdown

**Factors Favoring Rastriya Swatantra Party:**
1. Dramatic by-election victories in 2023 (54,176 votes in Chitwan-2)
2. Strong association with Gen Z protest movement
3. Youth demographic advantage (52% of voters aged 18-40)
4. Urban momentum, with Balen Shah as PM candidate
5. However: Only 20 seats in 2022, lacks rural penetration and upper house presence

**Critical Uncertainties:**
1. No opinion polling data to measure post-protest sentiment shifts
2. NC-UML running separately (no alliance) means potential vote-splitting
3. RSP's urban strength may not translate to rural FPTP constituencies
4. Impact of 70+ deaths on traditional party vote unclear
5. 136 registered parties creating fragmentation

**Seat Conversion Dynamics:**
The mixed system favors parties with strong FPTP performance. RSP's concentrated urban support may win some high-profile seats but struggle to match NC/UML's broad geographical coverage. The merged Nepali Communist Party's poor National Assembly showing (0/17 seats) suggests organizational weakness that could hurt FPTP performance despite reasonable PR prospects.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Established Distributions:**
- 2022 results provide strongest anchor: NC 32%, UML 28%, Left parties combined ~15%, RSP 7%
- Historical pattern: largest party typically wins 30-35% of seats in competitive elections
- 2017 showed alliance effects can push winner to 44%, but no major alliance exists for 2026

**Probability Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Nepali Congress:** Strong baseline (won 2022), organizational strength, but Gen Z backlash is real. Estimate 40-50% probability of winning most seats.

2. **CPN-UML:** Second in 2022, strong rural base, but also tainted by Oli's role in protests. Estimate 25-35% probability.

3. **Nepali Communist Party:** Combined historical base (~42 seats) suggests potential, but catastrophic National Assembly performance (0/17) indicates serious organizational problems. The merger may not have gelled. Estimate 10-18% probability.

4. **Rastriya Swatantra Party:** Strong momentum and youth appeal, but starting from only 20 seats with limited rural reach. Winning most seats would require unprecedented swing. Estimate 8-15% probability.

5. **Other parties:** Combined probability for RPP, Ujyaalo Nepal, Pragatisheel Loktantrik, and truly minor parties. Historical baseline suggests ~5% combined.

**Rate of Upsets:**
- 2022 was relatively predictable (NC won as expected from polls)
- 2017 saw expected alliance victory
- Major upsets are rare in Nepali elections, but the 2025 protests represent unprecedented disruption
- However, 33 days is short for complete party system realignment

**Final Calibration:**
Given the absence of polling, I'm working with higher uncertainty than ideal. The Gen Z protests create real possibility of RSP breakthrough, but organizational realities favor established parties. The merged NCP's National Assembly failure is a strong negative signal. I'll weight NC highest given their 2022 victory and organizational strength, with meaningful probabilities for UML, NCP, and RSP reflecting genuine uncertainty.

Outside View Prediction:

Nepali Congress: 46%
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 28%
Nepali Communist Party: 13%
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 9%
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 2%
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 0%
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 1%
Other: 1%
