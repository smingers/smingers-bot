## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

**AskNews Articles (Jan 25-Feb 1, 2026):**

7. **UML confidence statement (Feb 1)** - Yogesh Bhattarai claims UML will become "leading party" and win Jhapa-5 easily. This is **opinion/campaign rhetoric**, not evidence.

16. **Makwanpur-1 race (Jan 29)** - 23 candidates including NC, UML, RPP, NCP, RSP. Notes urban population growth favoring educated, mobile voters. Weak predictive evidence.

17. **Ravindra Mishra profile (Jan 25)** - RPP leader's third attempt in Kathmandu-1 after losing by 125 votes in 2022. Shows RPP competitive in specific urban seats but not national force.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical seat conversion patterns** (2022: NC 32% seats on 29% vote; UML 28% seats on 31% vote; RSP 7% seats on 12% vote): Shows NC and UML have superior FPTP machinery. This structural advantage persists absent major alliance shifts.
- **National Assembly alliance success** (NC-UML swept all 17 contested seats on Jan 25): Demonstrates current coordination capacity and organizational strength of both parties. However, they've declared no pre-poll pact for House elections, limiting direct applicability.
- **2022 baseline** (NC 89 seats, UML 78, Maoist 32, RSP 20): Most recent reference point. NC won plurality despite being second in PR votes.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **NCP formation** (Maoist Centre + Unified Socialist merger = ~40 seats combined in 2022): Creates third pole but still smaller than NC or UML individually. No evidence of super-additive electoral synergy yet.
- **Jhapa-5 high-profile race** (Balen challenging Oli): Symbolic of RSP's national ambitions, but outcome uncertain. Oli's 28,000-vote margin in 2022 suggests incumbency advantage, but Balen's mayoral victory shows urban appeal.
- **No NC-UML pre-poll alliance**: Unlike 2017 when UML-Maoist alliance swept to victory, 2026 sees major parties running separately. This fragments the vote and reduces seat efficiency for both.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Campaign rhetoric** (UML claiming "leading party" status, NC claiming to be "most new"): Standard campaign hyperbole with no predictive value.
- **Youth mobilization for RSP**: Balen's "silent campaign" across 16 constituencies and Gen Z protest legacy suggest RSP energy, but translating urban youth enthusiasm into rural FPTP seats remains unproven.
- **Regional analysis opinion** (unnamed
