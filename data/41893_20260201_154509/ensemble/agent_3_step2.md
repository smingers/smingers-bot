2) Outside view base rates (given)
Nepali Congress 46; CPN-UML 28; Nepali Communist Party 13; RSP 9; RPP 2; Ujyaalo Nepal 0; Pragatisheel Loktantrik 1; Other 1.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; fact vs opinion)

Upper-house (National Assembly) election reporting (Jan 25–26, 2026)
- Xinhua (2026-01-26): Reports NA results: NC 9, UML 8, LSP 1; NCP 0; notes NC-UML alliance. High reliability for basic tallies; directly factual; but different electorate/system than HoR. Useful as a signal about elite coordination/organization, not a direct predictor.
- Times of India (2026-01-25) / Millennium Post (2026-01-25) / The Indian Awaaz (2026-01-26) / People.cn (2026-01-26) / Youth.cn (2026-01-25): All echo NA results and alliance. Medium-to-high reliability on the core fact (seat tallies), because results are easily verifiable and consistent across multiple outlets; limited incremental insight beyond “NC-UML can coordinate effectively.”
- Kathmandu Post (2026-01-25): Reports process details and that NC-UML-JSP formed an alliance for NA. High-quality domestic reporting; mostly factual.
- LatestLY (2026-01-06): Pre-election coalition negotiations for NA, including tentative seat splits. Medium quality (syndicated/agency style); useful as background on alliance bargaining; not a HoR forecast.

Constituency/campaign stories and party messaging (late Jan–Feb 1, 2026)
- Nepal News “Jhapa-5: Balen vs Oli” (2026, exact date not shown; context pre-election): Describes a high-profile contest (Oli/UML vs Balen/RSP) and frames “old vs new.” Mostly narrative + analyst quotes; factual elements include prior margins and candidate decisions; opinion elements (bellwether claims) are plausible but not rigorously evidenced.
- Online Khabar (multiple, 2026-01-25 to 2026-02-01): Local reporting on candidate slates and constituency dynamics (Kathmandu-6, Kathmandu-1, Makwanpur-1, Parbat campaigns, Pyuthan candidates), plus statements by UML’s Yogesh Bhattarai and NC leader Gagan Thapa messaging.
  - Quality: generally good for “who is running where / what was said,” but weak for national seat forecasting. Distinguish:
    - Facts: candidate lists, number of candidates, prior vote totals/margins, dates, EC procedural info.
    - Opinions/claims: “we will be first party,” “easy victory,” “Congress is the most new,” etc. These are partisan assertions—low evidentiary weight.
- Election Commission sample ballot story (Online Khabar 2026-01-31): Administrative fact; reliable; no directional seat implication.

Background / broader contextual pieces
- Nepal News election history explainer (date not specified; used here for 2022/2017 seat baselines): Helpful factual recap; medium quality; main value is the 2022 seat distribution anchor (already in outside view).
- Al Jazeera global elections (2026-01-01): Notes youth protest context and potential youth political mobilization. High-quality outlet; but Nepal section is brief and not a quantitative forecast.
- AL Masry Al Youm (2026-01-31, Arabic): Claims Nepal election “likely” restores traditional left dominance with UML+Maoist Centre leading a united left front; no methodology shown; medium/low weight as “expert expectation” because it’s (i) not Nepal-specialist reporting in evidence provided and (ii) unclear sourcing.
- News18 (2026-01-30) / Newsdrum (2026-01-31): Confirms campaign window, voter count, and basic context (post-protest interim govt; election date). Useful factual timeline; no seat model.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors that matter for “most seats”)

Strong evidence (structural/base-rate, big weight)
1) 2022 HoR results and party capacity: NC 89, UML 78, RSP 20, RPP 14 (hung parliament). Under the same mixed system, the “plurality winner” has recently been NC or UML. This anchors NC/UML as the dominant contenders for “most seats.”
2) Electoral system mechanics (165 FPTP + 110 PR): FPTP rewards nationwide organization and efficient vote distribution; this structurally advantages NC and UML over newer parties whose support may be geographically concentrated (even if PR rises).

Moderate evidence (directional, but not determinative)
3) National Assembly coalition performance (Jan 2026): NC-UML alliance swept contested NA seats and NCP got zero. While the NA electorate differs, it signals (i) NC/UML coordination competence and (ii) that NCP may struggle with elite networks/coalition-making right now. Moderately negative for NCP’s “most seats” chances; mildly positive for NC/UML overall.
4) Post-2025 protest environment + “new vs old” salience: Multiple sources emphasize youth mobilization and reformist sentiment; Balen/RSP campaigning style appears to draw crowds. This is moderately positive for RSP vote share and some FPTP pickups, but translating that into “most seats nationally” is a higher bar.
5) Candidate refresh / repositioning: NC claims to have fielded many new candidates (106 new candidates mentioned) and is explicitly trying to blunt “old party” backlash. This modestly mitigates the anti-incumbent penalty risk for NC.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
6) Constituency anecdotes (e.g., Jhapa-5 “bellwether,” local races in Kathmandu): Useful for texture, but too many degrees of freedom to extrapolate nationally.
7) Partisan confidence statements (“UML will be first party,” “Congress is newest”): essentially cheap talk; near-zero weight.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: 33 days until resolution (Feb 1 → Mar 6, 2026), and 32 days until election day (Mar 5).
- If timeframe were halved (≈16 days to election): less time for narrative shifts; I’d put slightly more weight on base-rate organization (NC/UML) and slightly less on late surges (RSP). That would nudge probability toward NC/UML by a few points total.
- If timeframe were doubled (≈64 days): more time for alliance bargaining, scandals, or coordinated “left front / anti-establishment” consolidation. That would increase tails: higher chance UML (via alliances) or RSP (via momentum) overtakes NC, and higher uncertainty overall (spread out probabilities).

(d) Justification: updating the outside view into an inside view

Key question: who gets the *plurality of seats*, not who leads government.

1) NC remains the modal plurality winner, but slightly less than the outside view
- Outside view had NC at 46%. Inside view adjustment downward: The 2025 protest-triggered election increases volatility and anti-establishment appetite (Al Jazeera; campaign reporting). NC’s “we are the newest” messaging and many new candidates partially offsets this, but I still shave NC because volatility tends to punish top incumbents unless there’s clear polling evidence (none here).

2) UML improves modestly versus outside view
- UML’s outside-view 28% rises because:
  - UML retains deep organizational capacity and rural penetration (structural FPTP advantage).
  - NA alliance success indicates strong coalition discipline at elite level (though HoR alliances are unclear).
  - There is at least one external-media expectation (AL Masry Al Youm) of left dominance/unity—low quality, but directionally consistent with UML’s structural strength.
Net: I lift UML a bit, making the NC/UML race closer.

3) NCP (merged communist party) stays a contender but looks less likely to be #1
- The NA “zero seats” outcome undercuts perceptions of NCP strength/coordination right now. Even though NA ≠ HoR, it’s one of the few hard competitive signals we have in the last week. That pushes NCP down somewhat from the outside view.

4) RSP rises meaningfully but still unlikely to win the most seats
- Evidence suggests real momentum and a national-profile campaign (Balen as PM candidate; multiple stories emphasize “new forces”), so RSP’s chance of becoming *largest party* increases versus 9%.
- However, to be the largest party, RSP likely needs broad FPTP efficiency across many constituencies, not just urban enthusiasm. With limited evidence of nationwide machine parity with NC/UML, I cap RSP below NC/UML but increase it materially.

5) RPP and minor parties: low probability of plurality
- RPP can win pockets and has recognizable leaders, but base rates and the “most seats” criterion keep it low. Ujyaalo/Pragatisheel/Other are essentially “tail risk” outcomes requiring an extreme fragmentation scenario.

Probability calibration

I’m reducing confidence in the top option (NC) relative to the outside view due to (i) protest-triggered volatility and (ii) visible “new vs old” salience, while raising UML and RSP. The absence of reliable national polling is a major blind spot, so I avoid pushing any option much above ~40.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options: Party winning the most HoR seats in Nepal’s March 5, 2026 election (resolved by Mar 6).
2) Outside view distribution: [46, 28, 13, 9, 2, 0, 1, 1].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Nepali Congress / CPN-UML; Least likely = Ujyaalo Nepal / Pragatisheel Loktantrik / Other; yes.
4) Top evidence (3–5):
- 2022 seat baseline + mixed system favors NC/UML nationwide machines.
- NA election: NC-UML alliance strong; NCP shut out (signal of weakness).
- Youth/protest context elevates anti-establishment demand; RSP high-profile campaign.
- No credible polling → keep probabilities spread.
5) Blind spot: A late, effective pre-election alliance (e.g., consolidated left front or anti-NC tactical voting) could swing many FPTP seats and make UML or RSP the plurality.
6) Technicalities: Probabilities are 0–100 integers and sum to 100.

Probabilities: [40, 31, 11, 14, 2, 0, 1, 1]
