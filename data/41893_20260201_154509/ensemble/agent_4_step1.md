Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Hindu (26 Jan 2026) – Straightforward report of National Assembly (upper-house) by-election. High factual reliability; not directly about the lower house but shows organisational strength of Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML.  
2. Xinhua/Rising Nepal (26 Jan 2026) – Same event as #1, similar quality. Confirms NC-UML tactical capacity.  
3. GorakhaPatra (31 Jan 2026) – Colour story on the economic boost from campaigning. Factual but politically uninformative.  
4. Nepal News evening briefing (24 Oct 2025) – Reports imminent Maoist Centre + CPN-Unified Socialist merger. Reasonable local outlet, mostly factual.  
5. Grand Pinnacle Tribune (Nov 2025) – Long feature on Gen-Z protests and the Nov-2025 ten-party communist merger now registered as “Nepali Communist Party” (NCP). Mix of fact and commentary; hard data confined to merger announcement and protest casualty figures.  
6. Jacobin (Sept 2025) – Left-wing opinion piece. Provides historical timeline that matches public record; interpretive sections treated as opinion.  
7. Agent report (compiled 1 Feb 2026) – Secondary synthesis of electoral history, by-elections, alliance patterns and institutional rules. No new primary data but collates official Election Commission numbers from 2017 & 2022 and reputable press. Useful for baseline statistics.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• Past Nepali lower-house elections since the 2008 republic (four observations).  
• Mixed-member parliamentary systems world-wide where parties contest without pre-electoral coalitions (e.g., Germany, New Zealand).  
• Emerging-democracy elections that have just witnessed large youth protests (e.g., Sri Lanka 2022).  

The first class is closest: same electoral law (165 FPTP + 110 PR), same parties, and comparable time horizon (4–5 yr cycle). It is therefore adopted.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to polling: 33. Historically in Nepal, the largest-party ranking has not flipped in the last month of campaigning; seat totals have tracked opinion and alliance status formed at least two months out. Thus with 4–5 weeks left, late swings seldom overturn long-term organisational advantages.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• Base-rate frequencies: 2008 Maoists; 2013 NC; 2017 UML (or UML-led bloc); 2022 NC. Frequency for “largest party” = NC 2/4, UML 1/4 (2/4 if counting UML-Maoist merger), Maoist/NCP 1/4, others 0.  
• Organisational depth: Only NC and UML field viable candidates in all 165 constituencies every cycle.  
• Proven seat-getter premium: In 2022 NC won 32 % of seats on 29 % list vote; UML won 28 % seats on 31 % vote; Maoist Centre under-converted; RSP was seat-inefficient (7 % seats on 12 % vote).  
• Alliance posture today: NC and UML have sworn off pre-poll pacts, so neither can rely on the 2017-style seat-sweep. That slightly equalises their chances but still leaves them clearly ahead of the pack.  
• New Nepali Communist Party combines Maoist Centre + Unified Socialist (≈ 40 seats in 2022) – still materially smaller than either NC or UML, yet bigger than 2022 Maoists alone.  
• Rastriya Swatantra Party captured two April-2023 by-elections but lacks rural machinery; even a vote surge would translate poorly into FPTP seats.  
• Upset frequency: In the four republic-era elections, no newcomer has ever vaulted directly to largest-party status; ergo base-rate for a surprise > 0 but small (≈ 5-10 %).  

Outside view calibration:

Start with historical frequencies (NC 50 %, UML 25 %, Maoist/NCP 15 %, All others 10 %).  
Adjust for:  
• Absence of NC-led or UML-led electoral alliances this year (slightly lowers both, raises NCP and “other”).  
• Demonstrated youth surge favouring RSP (raise RSP a few points, shave from NC/UML).  
• 33-day window – late shocks possible but uncommon (leave 5-point “tail” across smaller options).  

After calibration:

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 40%  
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 35%  
Nepali Communist Party: 15%  
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 7%  
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 1%  
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 0.5%  
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 0.5%  
Other: 1%
