Analysis
(a) Source analysis (key items only; dates ≤ 1 Feb 2026)

1. Xinhua, Times of India, Kathmandu Post, Indian Awaaz (25-26 Jan 2026) – factual vote-count for National Assembly election. Independent wire services, high factual reliability. Shows NC 9, UML 8, others marginal. Opinion content minimal.

2. Nepal News “All eyes on Jhapa-5” (late Jan 2026) – constituency feature. Provides past FPTP margins for Oli (UML) and indicates RSP’s strategic push. Reputable local outlet; mostly factual.

3. “Everything you need to know about Nepal’s election history” (Nepal News, 25 Jan 2026) – historical seat tallies 2017 & 2022, context of Gen-Z protests. Reliable for published past results.

4. Newsdrum / News18 reports (30-31 Jan 2026) – election schedule, campaign window, voter roll. Straightforward logistics; factual.

5. Cluster of Online Khabar constituency reports (31 Jan – 1 Feb 2026) – local campaign colour, candidate lists. Good for breadth, but anecdotal.

6. Al Jazeera global round-up (1 Jan 2026) – brief, macro framing that youth protest may reshape vote. Moderate quality, partly analytical.

Overall signal: hard counts (upper-house), historical HoR numbers, confirmation of party mergers, evidence of youth-driven anti-incumbent mood, and RSP expansion.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• Historical pattern: in both 2017 & 2022 the largest HoR party was NC or UML (institutional + empirical).
• Organisational footprint: NC & UML dominate local governments (corroborated by National Assembly electoral-college results).

Moderate
• Left consolidation: Maoist Centre + splinters now Nepali Communist Party (NCP) – could lift its seat tally.
• Anti-establishment youth surge that toppled Oli; RSP won 2023 by-elections and is fielding 160+ FPTP candidates.
• Oli’s September 2025 resignation may dampen UML brand in short run.

Weak
• Single-seat constituency stories (Jhapa-5, Kathmandu-6) – illustrative but not predictive nationally.
• Leaders’ public claims of victory, satire posts, etc.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to election: 33; results 34. Structural factors (party machines, candidate slates) unlikely to move drastically, but late alliances or a scandal could still shift ±5-7 percentage-points in the top bracket. If time were halved (16 days), confidence would rise a little; if doubled (66 days), allow wider swings from possible alliances or economic shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment from base rate
Starting base (derived from 2017 & 2022, see prompt): NC 33 | UML 31 | NCP 14 | RSP 16 | others 6.

Adjustments:
• −6 pp UML: toppled government + protest blame (moderate evidence).
• +3 pp NCP: merger removes left vote-splitting (moderate).
• +3 pp RSP: sustained youth momentum, full national slate (moderate).
• +1 pp RPP: slight edge because of Kathmandu-1 viability.
• Re-allocate residual 1 pp to “Other”.

Calibrated probabilities

Nepali Congress – retains biggest nationwide network, new leadership narrative, largest in upper house. 32 %

CPN-UML – still strong rural machine but image dented; 25 %

Nepali Communist Party – unified left but weak in local bodies; 18 %

Rastriya Swatantra Party – rapid rise yet FPTP conversion hurdle; 19 %

Rastriya Prajatantra Party – pockets of strength but unlikely plurality; 3 %

Ujyaalo Nepal Party – micro-party; 1 %

Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party – micro-party; 1 %

Other – residual small parties or independents; 1 %

Blind-spot: last-minute NC–UML electoral pact or a corruption bombshell hitting NC. Either could swing 10-15 pp.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Option = party with most HoR seats decided by 6 Mar 2026.  
2. Base distribution stated & updated above.  
3. Most likely = NC; least likely = Ujyaalo/PLP. Coherent.  
4. Key evidence: a) NC/UML local dominance (strong). b) Youth-led anti-Oli protests (moderate). c) RSP by-election wins (moderate). d) Left merger (moderate). e) No national polling (uncertainty).  
5. Blind-spot: surprise grand coalition or scandal.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, 0-100 range.

Probabilities: [32, 25, 18, 19, 3, 1, 1, 1]
