Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Hindu (26 Jan 2026) – Straight news wire with seat counts for the 2026 National Assembly by-election.  High factual reliability; opinions absent.  Relevance: reminds us that the organisational “machines” of Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML can still mobilise when they collaborate.  
2. Xinhua / Rising Nepal Daily synthesis (26 Jan 2026) – Same result set as The Hindu, identical strengths and limits.  
3. GorakhaPatra (31 Jan 2026) – Economic colour piece on campaign spending.  Contains no data on party support; low analytical value for a forecast.  
4. Nepal News Evening Briefing (24 Oct 2025) – Reports the imminent Maoist Centre–Unified Socialist merger.  Factual core is solid; commentary minimal.  The item predates the legal registration of the “Nepali Communist Party” (NCP) but is still useful background.  
5. Grand Pinnacle Tribune (Nov 2025) – Describes September 2025 “Gen Z” protests and confirms the 10-party communist merger on 5 Nov 2025.  Factual segments are verifiable in multiple dailies; the quoted critics are clearly labelled opinion.  
6. Jacobin (Sept 2025) – Ideological magazine.  Provides a longer‐run narrative of Nepal’s left, but analysis is openly opinion-laden.  Factual chronologies (e.g., seat tallies in 2008-2022) cross-check with Election-Commission records and can be retained; prescriptive language is ignored.  
7. Agent report (1 Feb 2026) – Collates published election statistics (2017 & 2022 seat/vote shares, 2023 by-elections), alliance statements and institutional facts.  Most numbers are public-record; the uncertainty lies in the absence of conventional polling, a limitation the report itself flags.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• “Last two Nepali House elections” (2017, 2022).  Very small N, but exactly the same institution and parties; most direct.  
• “All multiparty national elections since 1991” (1991, 1994, 1999, 2008, 2013, 2017, 2022).  N = 7 gives a less noisy base rate, though pre-2006 monarchy period differs constitutionally.  
• “Emerging parliamentary democracies using mixed FPTP + PR systems” (e.g., Bolivia, Lesotho).  Wider N but structural and cultural distance.  

I choose the second class (1991-2022).  It captures six competitive elections under broadly comparable party line-ups and the same 165 FPTP + 110 PR formula since 2017.  Frequency of ‘largest-party’ outcomes in that set:  
– Nepali Congress largest 4/7 times (1991, 1994*, 1999, 2022) = 57 %  
– CPN-UML largest 1/7 times (2017) = 14 %  
– Maoist family largest 1/7 times (2008) = 14 %  
– Other 1/7 times (1994: NC and UML tied at 83 seats each; UML had more PR votes but same seat count – treat as split, so neither class gains).  Treating the tie as half-credit leaves NC 3.5, UML 1.5.  

Rounded base rates therefore start around: 55 % NC, 20 % UML, 15 % Maoist bloc (now NCP), 10 % everyone else.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is 1 Feb 2026; election is 33 days away, results due in 34–35 days.  In Nepal, late-campaign realignments can still matter (e.g., the left alliance announced in Oct 2017).  However, historical record shows only one instance (2017) where a last-month alliance flipped the “largest-party” slot.  Thus, with one month to go, roughly 70-80 % of the eventual seat hierarchy has already been baked in by organisational reach and candidate filings.  Upsets within the final month have occurred in 1/7 elections ≈ 14 %.

(d) Justification  
• Organisational depth: NC and UML remain the only parties with strong ward-level cadres in all 165 constituencies.  RSP is expanding rapidly but lacks village networks; Maoists (now NCP) retain pockets of strength but have haemorrhaged cadres since 2013.  
• Electoral system: 60 % of seats are FPTP; the vote–seat conversion curve rewards parties that can finish first even on modest pluralities.  No evidence yet of a pre-poll NC–UML pact, so they will cannibalise each other’s vote just as in 2022.  
• Recent empirical signals: the January 2026 upper-house election, despite an NC–UML tactical deal, reconfirmed that those two parties win the lion’s share when they cooperate, but also that NCP failed to capture a single seat.  That suggests the new communist merger has not (yet) rebuilt the 2008-style wave.  
• Absence of polling: with no national surveys, the best quantitative clue remains the 2022 seat shares: NC 89, UML 78, Maoist family 42 (counting ex-Unified Socialist), RSP 20.  A uniform swing large enough for either NCP or RSP to leapfrog both NC and UML would have to exceed 40–50 seats—an event with low base-rate frequency (0/7 times for a party starting outside the top two).  
• Upset frequency: In seven elections since 1991, a party that did not place in the top-two in the previous election has never jumped to first within one cycle.  That further trims the outside-view odds for RSP, RPP and other newcomers.  
• Expert/market expectations: no betting market exists; Nepali pundit commentary (Kathmandu Post, Setopati op-eds) mostly frames the race as NC vs UML, with curiosity about whether the youth surge can push RSP to a “third-largest” finish.

Outside view calibration:

1. Start with the long-run base rates above (NC 55, UML 20, NCP 15, Others 10).  
2. Adjust down NC a bit because the “largest-party repeats” only 3 of 6 transitions (50 %); split the freed-up 10 % proportionally between UML and NCP.  
3. Apply a 5 % bonus to RSP because it is the only newcomer with demonstrated by-election wins and clear post-protest momentum.  Deduct 5 % from “Other” to keep the total at 100.  
4. Fine-tune for structural hurdles: RPP, Ujyaalo, Pragatisheel and micro-parties have never topped 5 seats; assign them residual probabilities below 2 % combined.  Return the surplus to the big three players in proportion to their weights.

The calibrated outside-view distribution therefore becomes:

• Nepali Congress ≈ 40 %  
• CPN-UML ≈ 33 %  
• Nepali Communist Party (new Maoist-Unified Socialist merger) ≈ 14 %  
• Rastriya Swatantra Party ≈ 9 %  
• Rastriya Prajatantra Party ≈ 1 %  
• Ujyaalo Nepal Party ≈ 0.4 %  
• Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party ≈ 0.3 %  
• Other ≈ 2.3 %

These numbers sum to 100 %, reflect historical frequencies, recent organisational evidence, and the empirically low rate of last-month upsets in Nepalese elections while remaining agnostic about any inside-view campaign gossip that may yet emerge.

Outside View Prediction:
Nepali Congress: 40%  
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist): 33%  
Nepali Communist Party: 14%  
Rastriya Swatantra Party: 9%  
Rastriya Prajatantra Party: 1%  
Ujyaalo Nepal Party: 0.4%  
Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party: 0.3%  
Other: 2.3%
