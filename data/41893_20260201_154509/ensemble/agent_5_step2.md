Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, ≥ = factual, ~ = opinion)
1. Xinhua (26 Jan 26) – Upper-house results ≥; organisational alliance details ≥; no opinion. Reliable wire, very recent.
2. Kathmandu Post (25 Jan 26) – Same election facts ≥; province-level numbers ≥; neutral tone. Reliable national daily.
3. Times of India wire (25 Jan 26) – Duplicates 1–2 ≥; good for cross-check.
4. Nepal News explainer (25 Jan 26) – Full 1991-2022 HoR seat history ≥; expert comment on ‘evolving landscape’ ~. Factual section robust.
5. Al Jazeera global preview (1 Jan 26) – Notes Gen-Z protests and likely “traditional left dominance” ~. Single journalist view; moderate quality.
6. OnlineKhabar bundle (31 Jan – 1 Feb 26) – Local race stories ≥; party leaders’ claims ~. Good pulse of ground but anecdotal.
7. News18 & NewsDrum (30–31 Jan 26) – EC timetable ≥; campaign rules ≥. Pure facts.
8. Asknews deep search – Admits lack of polling ≥. Confirms evidence gap.
Convergence: Multiple independent, recent, professional outlets put Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML as the only parties winning sizeable new seats (upper house) while the newly-minted Nepali Communist Party (NCP-Maoist merger) scored zero.  

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong
• Historical largest-party record 1991-2022: NC 4/7, UML 1.5/7, Maoist bloc 1/7.  
• National Assembly 25 Jan 26 results show NC 9, UML 8, NCP 0 – three separate wires confirm.  
• Structural reach: only NC & UML have ward-level machinery in all 165 FPTP seats (documented in Nepal News history piece).
Moderate
• Youth-driven protest mood + RSP by-election successes (OnlineKhabar, Al Jazeera) indicate rising urban support.  
• Oli’s Sept 25 resignation may dent UML brand (Al Jazeera, local commentary).  
Weak
• High-profile contests (Jhapa-5, Kathmandu-6) could signal shifting winds but remain anecdotal.  
• Leaders’ public bravado (“we will be first”)—pure spin.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to polls: 33.  Nepal’s last-month alliances have flipped “largest party” only once in seven elections (2017 ≈ 14 %).  If the timeframe were halved (16 d) I would widen uncertainty by +3 % for late pacts; doubled (66 d) I would narrow spreads by ≈2 % as more polling/data would surface.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment
1. Upper-house wipe-out of NCP is a hard signal that the new merger has yet to re-energise its base.  I cut its chance from 14 → 10 % (strong evidence).  
2. NC not only led the January contest but also fields 106 fresh faces, is re-branding as “new”, and avoided the protest backlash.  Bumped 40 → 44 % (moderate evidence stacked on strong historical base).  
3. UML still shows organising muscle (8 National-Assembly wins) but is slightly handicapped by Oli’s recent fall and RSP challenge in its eastern heartland.  Trim 33 → 32 %.  
4. RSP has momentum, charismatic Balen campaign, and 20 seats already; loyalty of first-time voters unknown.  Lift 9 → 11 % (moderate evidence).  
5. RPP & micro-parties have no path to 50 + 1 seats; keep residual ≈ 2 %.  

Blind-spot: a last-minute NC–UML electoral pact (like their upper-house deal) where UML dominates FPTP splits while NC focuses on PR could hand UML the seat plurality.  Estimated likelihood 10 %; hence I restrain NC to mid-40s, not 50 +.

Probability calibration
• Small ±10 % shifts materially change odds (e.g., NC 44 % vs 34 % swings expected seats difference ≈ 14).  
• Given limited polling, I keep the top two within 12 pts and give RSP double-digit room for surprise.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Option = party winning most HoR seats on/after 5 Mar 26.  
2. Outside base: [40, 33, 14, 9, 1, 0.4, 0.3, 2.3].  
3. Most likely = NC; least = Ujyaalo/Pragatisheel. Looks coherent.  
4. Key evidence: (a) 25 Jan upper-house numbers; (b) historic NC dominance; (c) NCP zero seats; (d) youth protest → RSP lift; (e) Oli resignation.  
5. Blind-spot: NC-UML joint list. Could flip winner → raise UML to >40 %.  
6. Probabilities sum 100, each 0–100.

Probabilities: [44, 32, 10, 11, 1, 0.4, 0.3, 1.3]
