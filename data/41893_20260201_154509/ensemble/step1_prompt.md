# Summary of "Nepal's Protests Are the Result of a Blocked Revolution"

**Source:** Jacobin

## Key Facts and Timeline:

- **Recent Protests (September 2025):** Nepal experienced major protests over the past month, triggered initially by a government ban on social media but expanding to broader issues of corruption, unemployment, and authoritarianism. Tens of thousands of young people (many in teens and early twenties) participated in cities including Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Biratnagar.

- **Casualties:** By mid-September, at least 72 people were dead and over 2,000 injured from state response including rubber bullets, water cannons, tear gas, and live fire.

- **Historical Context:**
  - 2001: Palace massacre killed King Birendra
  - 2005: King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and imposed emergency rule
  - 2006: People's Movement II forced king to reinstate parliament
  - 2008: Monarchy abolished, Nepal declared a "federal democratic republic"
  - 2008 elections: Maoists won nearly two-fifths of constituent assembly seats
  - 2013 elections: Maoists lost support, falling behind CPN-UML and Nepali Congress
  - 2018: Maoists and CPN-UML merged into single Nepal Communist Party (Maoists had 53 seats, CPN-UML had 121)
  - 2020: PM K.P. Sharma Oli dissolved parliament (later reversed by Supreme Court); unified party split back into component parts
  - 2022-2024: Coalition with Maoist leader Prachanda as PM
  - Current: Oli-led government (excluding Maoists) introduced social media ban that triggered recent protests

## Analysis/Opinions (from article author - Jacobin):

- The protests are framed as part of a broader South Asian regional wave of revolt (referencing Sri Lanka 2022, Bangladesh 2024-25)
- Article argues the communist parties' "programmatic limitations facilitated their seamless integration into the very capitalist system they once vowed to overthrow"
- Claims the Maoist movement "lacked a vision for workers' power in the cities or the construction of socialist institutions beyond the battlefield"
- Characterizes the transition from insurgency to governance as "the logical culmination of the movement's ideological limits" rather than an accident
- Suggests the Gen Z movement represents "a delayed reckoning with the compromises of the Maoists and the CPN-UML"

<Agent_report>
Query: Opinion polling, by-election results and party alliances for 2026 Nepali general election; comparative seat/vote conversion in 2017 and 2022; impact of 2025 Gen Z protests on party popularity
State of data availability
The documentary record continues to show that Nepal remains virtually poll-free at the national level. None of the press coverage retrieved for January-February 2026 carries statistically weighted vote-intention figures. Journalists therefore rely on by-election returns, party membership surges and anecdotal “street mood” reporting to gauge the balance of forces.

1. Opinion-polling snapshot
• No firm national polls. Neither the Election Commission, the think-tank community nor private survey houses have released sample-based national barometers for the 5 March vote. The Economic Times article that labelled the youth-led Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) “increasingly popular” cited no numbers, and the Kathmandu Post “House election explained” feature repeats past turnout data but offers no opinion percentages [Asianews.network, 30 Jan 2026; Kathmandu Post, 30 Jan 2026].  
• Constituency-level hints. An Annapurna Express deep dive into Kathmandu-4 shows how journalists use the 2022 PR vote as a proxy for current strength: it notes that RSP collected 9 412 list votes in the seat without running an FPTP candidate, concluding that the party starts “from a baseline of nearly 10 000” votes and could win if it attracts 5 000–7 000 swing voters [Annapurna Express, 31 Jan 2026]. Such pieces reinforce the impression of strong urban momentum for RSP but still fall short of a genuine poll.

2. By-election and mid-term signals since 2022
The three simultaneous by-elections of 23 April 2023 remain the only ballot-box evidence between the 2022 and 2026 general contests. They produced landslide wins for RSP in Chitwan-2 (54 176 votes) and Tanahun-1 (34 919), while veteran Madhesi leader Upendra Yadav recaptured Bara-2 for the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) [Setopati, 26 Apr 2023]. In January 2026, a tactical Nepali Congress (NC)–CPN-UML alliance swept 17 of 18 National Assembly seats, showing that the two largest machines can still convert their local-government strength into seats when they cooperate [Kathmandu Post & Xinhua, 25 Jan 2026].

3. Party configurations for the 2026 race
• Nepali Congress and UML: after their one-off upper-house pact, both insist they will “contest independently” on 5 March [Nepal News, 30 Jan 2026].  
• Left mergers: CPN-Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist) have reunited as the Nepali Communist Party (NCP) and will run on a common ticket.  
• RSP: fielding candidates nationwide and projecting former Kathmandu mayor Balendra “Balen” Shah as its prime-ministerial face; it still lacks an upper-house presence.  
• Regional/Madhes forces—JSP, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), Janamat Party—are competing separately, banking on vote splits among the national parties.  
• Smaller constitutional update: President Paudel issued an ordinance adjusting the caste/ethnic quotas within the PR tier to reflect the 2021 census, slightly reducing the Khas-Arya and Janajati shares while raising Madheshi and Muslim allocations [Kathmandu Post, 19 Dec 2025]. Parties have had to amend their closed lists accordingly.

4. Seat–vote conversion: 2017 versus 2022
Nepal’s mixed electoral system (165 first-past-the-post + 110 closed-list PR) produces markedly different seat yields from identical vote shares.

2017 House of Representatives (Election Commission figures distilled in IFES guide & Nepalresearch):
• CPN-UML – 33 % of PR vote; 121 seats (44 %).  
• CPN-Maoist Centre – 14 % PR vote; 53 seats (19 %).  
• Nepali Congress – 33 % PR vote; 63 seats (23 %).  
A tight UML–Maoist alliance converted a combined 47 % of list votes into 63 % of total seats, underlining how coordinated constituency strategies multiply gains in the FPTP tier.

2022 House of Representatives (final Election Commission tally reported by Rising Nepal Daily, 8 Dec 2022):
• Nepali Congress – 29.3 % PR vote (2 715 225); 89 seats (32 %).  
• CPN-UML – 30.7 % PR vote (2 845 641); 78 seats (28 %).  
• Maoist Centre – 12.7 % PR vote (1 175 684); 32 seats (12 %).  
• RSP – 12.2 % PR vote (1 130 344); 20 seats (7 %).  
Because the three traditional parties ran in rival alliances and a new urban force (RSP) spread its vote thinly across many districts, seat proportionality improved: the largest coalition (NC-led) won 49 % of seats on roughly 45 % of votes, a far narrower conversion premium than in 2017.

Micro-evidence from Kathmandu-4 (2022 data reproduced by Annapurna Express) further illustrates how candidate-centred voting distorts overall proportionality: NC’s star Gagan Thapa took 21 302 constituency votes but only 11 808 list votes, suggesting nearly 9 500 personal-rather-than-party ballots. RSP, which fielded no direct candidate, still scored 9 412 PR votes—almost matching NC’s party tally—showing the limits of list totals as predictors of FPTP outcomes.

5. Impact of the 2025 “Gen Z” protests on party popularity
Political narrative shift
• The September 2025 youth uprising toppled the Oli–Deuba coalition after 70+ deaths and forced President Paudel to appoint former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim prime minister [NPR & Carnegie Endowment, Sept 2025; Science Survey, 8 Oct 2025].  
• Traditional parties suffered reputational damage: their offices were torched, and their leaders blamed for corruption and for ordering lethal force (Save the Children rapid assessment, 2025).  
• The uprising popularised anti-establishment figures on Discord and other social-media platforms, boosting the visibility of RSP’s Balen Shah and independent civic activists.

Observable electoral repercussions
• Youth-labelled newcomers—RSP above all—gained credibility from their distance to the old guard and from their visible role in protest logistics (coordination via Discord, VPN use up 8 000 % during the social-media ban—Science Survey).  
• Established parties have tried to rebrand: NC elected 49-year-old Gagan Thapa as president and prime-ministerial candidate; UML is running younger provincial chiefs in several urban seats.  
• Alliance fatigue: all major parties now publicly reject pre-election seat-sharing arrangements, a practice denounced during the protests as cartel politics [Nepal News, 30 Jan 2026].

Quantifiable evidence remains scarce. No post-September survey has measured favourability or vote intention, but the 2023 by-elections and the Kathmandu-4 numbers quoted above indicate that:
– RSP converts protest sympathy into real votes in urban and semi-urban districts;  
– UML’s urban base has eroded, though it retains deep rural networks;  
– Nepali Congress still benefits from candidate personal followings but risks fragmentation where incumbents shift constituencies (example: Thapa leaving Kathmandu-4).

6. Institutional and demographic context of the 2026 contest
• Voters: 18 903 689 registered, up 915 119 since 2022; 52 % are aged 18-40, giving the post-protest youth cohort potential decisive weight [Asianews.network, 30 Jan 2026].  
• Parties: 136 registered; 120 cleared to contest, of which 63 submitted PR lists and 68 fielded FPTP candidates [ibid.]. One quarter of the registered parties were born after the Gen Z movement, confirming a surge in political entrepreneurship.  
• Candidates: 3 406 for FPTP (1 143 independents); 3 213 on PR lists. Only 388 women are running directly, meaning gender-quota compliance will again depend heavily on the PR tier.  
• Security and logistics: 325 000 security personnel are being deployed; the government has budgeted NPR 19.21 billion for the election, two-thirds of it for security [Asianews.network].

7. Synthesis: what is known and remaining uncertainties
Known
• RSP has replaced the Maoists as the principal anti-establishment pole and has proven vote-pulling power in by-elections;  
• NC and UML can still reap a seat bonus if they coordinate, as the 2026 National Assembly vote showed; no such alliance exists for 5 March;  
• The 2025 protests have delegitimised large pre-poll coalitions and accelerated generational turnover in candidate selection;  
• Changes in PR quota shares slightly strengthen Madheshi and Muslim representation, forcing parties to recalibrate lists.

Unknown
• National vote-intention percentages by party since 2022.  
• FPTP-tier popular-vote totals for 2017 and 2022 at party level (the EC publishes only constituency winners; aggregations are scattered).  
• Hard survey data on how the protest cohort (18-29) intends to vote, or on leader favourability ratings.

To close these gaps researchers would need:
1. Raw Election Commission spreadsheets of both PR and FPTP vote totals by party for 2017 and 2022.  
2. Any polling micro-data held by Nepali universities (Tribhuvan U, Kathmandu U) or private agencies such as Interdisciplinary Analysts.  
3. Turnout and margin tables for municipal by-elections held since 2022, which may reveal age-cohort swings.  
4. Social-media sentiment analytics segmented by age and district to substitute for absent surveys.

Until such data emerge, by-election trends and constituency-level vote transfers remain the best—though imperfect—guide to Nepal’s fluid 2026 electoral landscape.</Agent_report>
