Analysis:
To forecast which party will win the most seats, the most helpful information will include: 
• Recent or still-active opinion polls and seat-projection models for the 2026 Nepalese general election.  
• News on evolving party alliances or mergers (especially involving Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, the new Nepali Communist Party, Rastriya Swatantra Party).  
• Reporting on campaign momentum, candidate slates, fund-raising and endorsements that could shift voter support.  
• Commentary by Nepali political analysts on the electoral map under the mixed FPTP + PR system.  

The three queries below aim to surface these elements: a broad Google web search for any 2026 polling data, a Google News search focused on seat projections and coalition talk, and an AskNews natural-language request for the very latest pre-election polling and alliance coverage.
