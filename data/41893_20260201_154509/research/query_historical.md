Analysis:
Nepal’s three most powerful vote-gathering brands since the civil war have been  
• Nepali Congress (NC): centrist, pro-parliament. 2017 share 23 % list vote / 63 seats; 2022 share 26 % / 89 seats (largest bloc because left vote was split).  
• CPN-UML (UML): left-nationalist under K.P. Sharma Oli. 2017 share 33 % / 121 seats; 2022 share 28 % / 78 seats.  
• CPN-Maoist Centre (MC): guerrilla-turned-mainstream; collapsed to 11 % list vote / 32 seats in 2022.  

The November 2025 merger that created the Nepali Communist Party (NCP) reunited MC with seven other small left factions (but not UML).  In 2017 those factions together received roughly 14 % of the proportional vote; combined with MC’s 11 % from 2022, the new NCP plausibly starts with a 20–25 % national base.  Whether it finishes first will depend on a three-cornered left contest against UML plus the reformist Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP, 21 PR seats in 2022 and a magnet for Gen-Z protest voters).

Structural facts to anchor an outside view:
1. Seat bonus from first-past-the-post: 60 % of seats are constituency-based.  A plurality, not a majority, is enough to top the table, so vote splits matter more than raw popularity.
2. Since 1990, no party that finished second in the previous election has bounced back to first without the first-placed party splitting beforehand.  NC edged UML only because the left was fractured in 2022; the fracture now runs through the left again but in a different way (UML vs. NCP).
3. Youth mobilisation in 2025 hurt both legacy parties; early local by-elections in late-2025 showed RSP gaining urban constituencies at the expense of NC more than UML.

Implications for 2026:
• If the anti-UML left (NCP) poaches more from NC than from UML, the two left parties may cannibalise one another, enabling UML to win the most FPTP races even on 28–30 % of the vote, exactly as in 2017.  
• NC would need to remain clearly ahead in the proportional ballot (≈30 %+) and stay competitive in three-way constituency fights—difficult with RSP peeling off urban youth.  
• RSP’s surge could make it the second-largest list-vote party but, like other new parties in 2008 and 2013, its lack of entrenched local machines will likely cap FPTP wins, limiting its total seat haul.  
• Unless a formal electoral alliance forms between NC and NCP (so far ruled out by both sides), the arithmetic favours UML narrowly topping the seat count.

Therefore, based on past electoral arithmetic, organisational depth, and the current three-way left split, the default outside-view favorite is the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
