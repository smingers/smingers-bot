Balen subsequently became \"a vocal critic of Oli's style of governance,\" pointing to \"instances of corruption and inefficiency where Oli and the UML were linked.\"\n\n## Campaign Approaches:\n\n- **Balen's Strategy:** Mass rallies, personal outreach, direct engagement with youth voters, establishing local offices, and attempting to engage \"disaffected youth leaders from other parties\" to consolidate a broader reformist vote base.\n- **Oli's Strategy:** Relying on experience, legacy, and development achievements; campaigning on infrastructure, urban planning, and economic policy accomplishments; mobilizing traditional party loyalists through UML's organizational strength.\n\n## Stakes and Implications:\n\nAccording to political analysts cited in the article:\n- **For Oli:** A loss would weaken the UML's legacy and question the perception of Oli's \"invincibility as a political force.\" The constituency is monitored as \"a bellwether of the party's fortune nationally.\"\n- **For Balen:** Victory would \"catapult him onto the national stage\" and demonstrate that RSP can compete with established parties. It would signal that \"a new generation of political leaders with their roots in reformist agendas and experience in urban governance can make their presence felt even in the traditional remote strongholds.\"\n\n## Broader Electoral Context:\n\nThe article characterizes the 2026 elections as \"a fight between the so-called old, entrenched political class and the so-called new, emerging political forces,\" with Jhapa-5 representing the \"most strongly\" reflected example of this dynamic across all 165 constituencies.\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end mid-sentence.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2026/01/25/national-assembly-polls-begin-across-provinces\">\n# Summary of Kathmandupost Article on National Assembly Polls\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n**Election Details:**\n- Voting underway on Sunday to elect 17 members of the National Assembly\n- Terms of 19 members set to expire on March 4\n- Of the 19 vacant seats: 1 member from Koshi Province elected unopposed, 1 to be nominated by the President, and 17 being contested\n- Constitutional requirement: elections must be held at least 35 days before seats fall vacant (Article 86(3))\n- Voting hours: 9 am to 3 pm, with counting to begin immediately after\n\n**Voter Eligibility and Numbers:**\n- Eligible voters: provincial assembly members, mayors, chairpersons, deputy mayors, and vice-chairpersons of local units\n- Total voters: 2,056 (including 550 provincial assembly members and 753 local-level chiefs and deputies)\n- 14 positions already vacant due to various reasons\n- 16 provincial assembly members and 11 local-level officials resigned to contest the upcoming House of Representatives election, making them ineligible to vote\n- Final voters' list: 545 provincial assembly members and 1,497 local-unit chiefs and deputies\n- Vote weightage: Provincial assembly members = 53;

Thirteen political parties have fielded candidates in the district, with key contenders including Arjun Prasad Joshi (Nepali Congress), Padam Giri (Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist, UML), Manhari Sharma (Nepali Communist Party), and Sagar Bhusal (Rastriya Swatantra Party). Candidates are actively engaging with voters at the village level, presenting their platforms and policy proposals. Voters are raising concerns about national issues such as unemployment, corruption, and poor governance, as well as local priorities including road development, quality healthcare, irrigation, job creation, and monkey menace control. While most villages in Parbat\u2019s seven municipalities have access to blacktopped roads, residents are demanding higher-quality roads extending to individual hamlets. The monkey menace remains a major challenge, with promises to address it through effective policies and legislation, though no concrete implementation has yet occurred. Joshi emphasized pragmatic, need-based development over grandiose projects, citing his five-decade political experience. Giri highlighted unfinished development work from his previous terms, while Sharma called for systematic development across the district, citing comprehensive plans in education, health, agriculture, livestock, employment, infrastructure, and industrialization. Bhusal advocated for systemic policy and legal reforms to address governance failures. Other parties, including Rastriya Prajatantra Party, CPN Maoist Centre, Rastriya Janamorcha, Ujyalo Nepal, Mongol National Party, Aam Janata Party, National Republic Nepal, Rastriya Janmukti Party, and Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party, are also conducting detailed election campaigns.

Single-constituency districts include Salang, Dolpa, Mugu, Jumla, Kalikot, Humla, Jajarkot, and Rukum West in Karnali Province, and two constituencies each in Dailekh and Surkhet. In Sudurpaschim Province, districts such as Bajura, Bajhang, Doti, Darchula, Baitadi, and Dadelhura have one constituency each, while Achham has two, Kanchanpur has three, and Kailali has five.

Speaking at a campaign event in Kathmandu-4 on Saturday, Thapa challenged voters who claim they are voting for a 'new' party by asking them to reflect on the definition of 'old' and 'new.' He argued that since no party is newer than the current Congress\u2014reformed under his leadership before Falgun 6 (February 2026)\u2014the Congress is, in fact, the most new party in Nepal. Thapa stated that a party cannot be considered truly new merely by having a new face, and that one cannot become a new party overnight by simply winning elections. He urged party workers to communicate this message directly to the electorate.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:21 AM\nSource:[Online Khabar](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2026/01/1860386/gagans-instructions-tell-those-who-say-dont-vote-for-the-old-ones-congress-is-the-newest)\n\n**Beyond Eight General Elections in Asia and the Pacific in 2026: Stability, Transition, and Exceptionalism**\nThe article analyzes eight general elections in Asia and the Pacific region scheduled for 2026, highlighting their political significance and context. Seven elections were pre-scheduled by constitution or circumstance, while the eighth\u2014Japan\u2019s early parliamentary election\u2014was announced unexpectedly on January 19, 2026, to be held on February 8, 2026. Six of the eight elections determine the head of state or government, including Myanmar, Thailand, Japan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and New Zealand. In Laos and Vietnam\u2014single-party states\u2014parliamentary elections serve as formalities following national party congresses, where top leaders are appointed. In Myanmar, elections (held in three phases: December 28, 2025, and January 11 and 25, 2026) are seen as symbolic, with the military-backed 'Union Solidarity and Development Party' securing over 260 of 330 elected seats in the House of Representatives and over 160 of 224 seats in the House of Nationalities, despite military control since the 2021 coup and ongoing armed conflict. In Bangladesh, the first election since the fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024 after student-led protests, will be held on February 12, 2026, with 350 seats contested; the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by Tarique Rahman, is expected to win, facing a fragmented opposition coalition including the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami and the youth-led 'National Citizen' party. In Nepal, following the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in September 2025 due to youth-led protests, elections on March 5, 2026, will likely restore the traditional left-wing dominance, with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist) and the Maoist Centre leading a united left front; no single party is expected to win a majority, likely resulting in a coalition government. In Thailand, early elections on February 8, 2026, follow rapid political turnover since 2023, with four prime ministers in two years and a constitutional court ruling that ousted two. The election, contested by the People\u2019s Party, Palang Pracharath, and Move Forward Party, is expected to result in a fragmented parliament, with no single party securing a majority, reflecting ongoing instability. In Japan, early elections were called by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s successor, Sanae Takaichi, on January 19, 2026, after her government\u2019s instability and the right-wing shift within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), prompting a new centrist coalition between Komeito and opposition parties to counter the rightward trend. In New Zealand, the only 'normal' parliamentary election among the six, scheduled by no later than December 19, 2026, will elect 120 MPs and include a referendum on extending the parliamentary term from three to four years. The election will feature a competitive race between the ruling National Party and the opposition Labour Party, which suffered a major defeat in October 2023. In Laos and Vietnam, elections on February 22 and March 15, 2026, respectively, are formalities following national party congresses\u2014Laos\u2019 12th and Vietnam\u2019s 14th\u2014where leaders such as Thongloun Sisoulith and To Lam were reappointed, with new development plans for 2026\u20132030 and long-term visions to 2045 adopted. The article concludes by noting that five of the eight elections are exceptional\u2014due to coups, protests, or early calls\u2014raising questions about political stability, while Laos and Vietnam, despite single-party systems, exhibit greater stability in leadership selection.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:31 AM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4187553)\n\n**Kathmandu-6 Election Race: RSP Aims for Re-election, Congress and UML Seek Comeback, RPP Fields New Candidate**\nIn the upcoming general election for the House of Representatives, Kathmandu-6 constituency features a competitive political landscape with 20 candidates\u201415 from political parties and 5 independent candidates.

RSP secured the highest votes in both direct and proportional representation in the previous election, with Khadka receiving 14,221 votes. The Nepali Congress has nominated Krishna Subba Baniya, a 61-year-old former district chairperson, who is seeking to reclaim the seat lost in the previous election. Baniya is emphasizing river conservation and urban revitalization as key campaign issues. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist, CPN-UML) has nominated Aman Kumar Maski, a former provincial minister and central committee member, who is promoting long-term development planning and public service over politics as a profession. The CPN (Maoist Centre) is fielding Himal Sharma, a second-time candidate, who claims to represent the legacy of the late Jhala Nath Khanal and is campaigning under the slogan 'Responsibility of the present, hope for the future.' The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has chosen Uddhav Raj Bhatwal, a 36-year-old with postgraduate qualifications, as a new face, promoting a 'victory or nothing' stance and advocating for national sovereignty and democratic institutions. The constituency includes wards from Kathmandu Metropolitan City (26, 27, 28), Tokha Municipality (1, 8, 9, 10, 11), and Tarkeshwar Municipality (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:35 AM\nSource:[Online Khabar](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2026/01/1860128/kathmandu-6-rsp-seeks-to-repeat-congress-uml-wants-to-return)\n\n**Basukota's Satire on Nepal's Election Rhetoric: 'Hype and Accusations Are Ordinary Here, Not Abroad'**\nNepali Congress leader Gokul Basukota has used satire to critique the current political discourse in Nepal, particularly the overlapping claims by political parties of winning elections and forming single-party governments.

Balen, the 35-year-old prime ministerial candidate of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), conducted a two-week 'silent campaign' visiting at least 16 constituencies in eastern and western Nepal, including districts in Sudur Paschim and Karnali provinces, without formal speeches. Instead, he engaged crowds by waving, shaking hands, and ringing a bell\u2014his party\u2019s election symbol\u2014drawing spontaneous crowds of all age groups who sought selfies and autographs. His spouse, Sabina Kafley, campaigned door-to-door in his constituency, Jhapa-5. Prachanda, leader of the Nepali Communist Party and former prime minister, emphasized unity among communist parties to defend national sovereignty against 'reactionary forces and foreign elements,' stating he is running at 72 and remains committed to struggle. He highlighted the formation of over 20 political groups into a unified Nepali Communist Party. Nepali Congress president Gagan Thapa, also the party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate, pledged to create domestic employment to reduce youth emigration. The party has fielded 106 new candidates across 165 direct constituencies. Nepali Congress spokesperson Devraj Chalise warned that failing to elect reliable candidates could turn Nepal into a 'laboratory.' Vice President Ram Sahaya Yadav stressed the need for a free, fair, and fearless electoral environment, calling it foundational to Nepal\u2019s federal democratic republic. A total of 18.9 million voters are eligible to elect 165 members directly, with 110 additional members chosen via proportional representation. The elections were triggered after Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli resigned on September 9, 2025, following youth-led Gen Z protests over corruption and a social media ban.

Sushila Karki, 73, was appointed interim prime minister on September 12, 2025, and recommended the dissolution of the House of Representatives, leading to the announcement of the election date.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 02:46 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/election-campaign-in-nepal-to-begin-from-february-16-9868604.html)\n\n**Makwanpur-1 Faces New Challenge as Veteran Candidates Meet Fresh Faces in Upcoming Election**\nIn the Makwanpur-1 constituency, the upcoming House of Representatives election on February 21, 2026, features 23 candidates, including 13 party-backed and 10 independent contenders. The main competition is expected between candidates from the Nepali Congress (NC), Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist) (CPN-UML), Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), Nepal Communist Party (NCP), and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Notably, Mahalakshmi Upadhyay 'Dina' and Deepak Bahadur Singh are contesting their fifth consecutive election in this constituency. Dina has lost all previous elections, while Singh won in 2079 (2022) by a margin of 2,382 votes. CPN-UML\u2019s Vijay Gautam and RSP\u2019s Prakash Gautam are making their first direct electoral challenge. The constituency has seen a significant population increase\u2014from 124,799 in 2074 to 158,435 in 2082\u2014largely due to urbanization in Hetauda Sub-metropolitan City, which hosts 15 wards. The urban population is more educated and politically mobile, increasing the potential for vote shifts. Political analysis indicates that NC and CPN-UML view each other as primary rivals, while downplaying Singh\u2019s threat. NC\u2019s Bhim Sen Mahat anticipates improved performance due to internal party cohesion and stronger urban outreach. CPN-UML\u2019s Hidem Lama expresses confidence in candidate Ramshwar Rana, citing strong party organization and favorable past results. Maoist leader Pralhad Lamichhane believes youth candidates with experience in governance and good governance will gain support, particularly in rural areas. RPP\u2019s Sandip Sapkota Singh claims he will win again, citing consistent public engagement despite not completing a full term in parliament. The election is further shaped by historical trends: Maoists previously won the 2070 Constituent Assembly election and held key local posts in 2079, but have not won a House seat since. The constituency remains politically competitive, with shifting alliances and evolving voter dynamics.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:28 AM\nSource:[Online Khabar](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2026/01/1859181/new-challenge-for-candidates-who-have-contested-elections-repeatedly-in-makawanpur-1)\n\n**Nepali Congress emerges as largest party in Upper House**\nThe Nepali Congress (NC) emerged as the largest party in Nepal's Upper House, the National Assembly, securing nine out of 18 seats in the January 25, 2026, elections, according to the Election Commission of Nepal.

The election will fill 18 seats vacated by members completing their six-year terms, as part of the chamber\u2019s biennial retirement cycle. According to preliminary discussions, the seat allocation is tentatively set at seven for the Nepali Congress, six for the CPN-UML, four for the Nepali Communist Party, and one for the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. Senior leaders from the Nepali Congress, including Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, met with CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel to finalize arrangements. The UML is expected to have the highest number of retiring members (eight), followed by the Nepali Communist Party (seven). The Nepali Congress, despite being the second-largest party in the upper house, has no members retiring in March. All candidates must file nominations by January 7, 2026. Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat stated, 'If we do not tie up, it will be difficult to win even a single seat.' The alliance discussions were initiated after an understanding was reached between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli, with subsequent coordination involving Nepali Communist Party coordinator Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Of the 19 seats to be filled, 18 are elected by an electoral college composed of provincial assembly members (weighted at 53) and local government leaders (weighted at 19), while one is nominated by the President on government recommendation. The National Assembly is a permanent chamber of Parliament, established under the Constitution. The lower house was dissolved on September 12, 2025, following the Gen Z movement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 12:44 AM\nSource:[LatestLY](https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-major-political-parties-move-toward-alliance-for-upper-house-election-7264331.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nI regret that I cannot provide the requested polling, alliances, or seat forecasts for Nepal's 2026 House of Representatives election.
