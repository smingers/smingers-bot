Tens of thousands of young people (many in teens and early twenties) participated in cities including Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Biratnagar.\n\n- **Casualties:** By mid-September, at least 72 people were dead and over 2,000 injured from state response including rubber bullets, water cannons, tear gas, and live fire.\n\n- **Historical Context:**\n  - 2001: Palace massacre killed King Birendra\n  - 2005: King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and imposed emergency rule\n  - 2006: People's Movement II forced king to reinstate parliament\n  - 2008: Monarchy abolished, Nepal declared a \"federal democratic republic\"\n  - 2008 elections: Maoists won nearly two-fifths of constituent assembly seats\n  - 2013 elections: Maoists lost support, falling behind CPN-UML and Nepali Congress\n  - 2018: Maoists and CPN-UML merged into single Nepal Communist Party (Maoists had 53 seats, CPN-UML had 121)\n  - 2020: PM K.P. Sharma Oli dissolved parliament (later reversed by Supreme Court); unified party split back into component parts\n  - 2022-2024: Coalition with Maoist leader Prachanda as PM\n  - Current: Oli-led government (excluding Maoists) introduced social media ban that triggered recent protests\n\n## Analysis/Opinions (from article author - Jacobin):\n\n- The protests are framed as part of a broader South Asian regional wave of revolt (referencing Sri Lanka 2022, Bangladesh 2024-25)\n- Article argues the communist parties' \"programmatic limitations facilitated their seamless integration into the very capitalist system they once vowed to overthrow\"\n- Claims the Maoist movement \"lacked a vision for workers' power in the cities or the construction of socialist institutions beyond the battlefield\"\n- Characterizes the transition from insurgency to governance as \"the logical culmination of the movement's ideological limits\" rather than an accident\n- Suggests the Gen Z movement represents \"a delayed reckoning with the compromises of the Maoists and the CPN-UML\"\n\n**Note:** This article provides heavily ideological analysis from a leftist perspective (Jacobin) rather than neutral reporting.

None of the press coverage retrieved for January-February 2026 carries statistically weighted vote-intention figures. Journalists therefore rely on by-election returns, party membership surges and anecdotal \u201cstreet mood\u201d reporting to gauge the balance of forces.\n\n1. Opinion-polling snapshot\n\u2022 No firm national polls. Neither the Election Commission, the think-tank community nor private survey houses have released sample-based national barometers for the 5 March vote. The Economic Times article that labelled the youth-led Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) \u201cincreasingly popular\u201d cited no numbers, and the Kathmandu Post \u201cHouse election explained\u201d feature repeats past turnout data but offers no opinion percentages [Asianews.network, 30 Jan 2026; Kathmandu Post, 30 Jan 2026].  \n\u2022 Constituency-level hints. An Annapurna Express deep dive into Kathmandu-4 shows how journalists use the 2022 PR vote as a proxy for current strength: it notes that RSP collected 9 412 list votes in the seat without running an FPTP candidate, concluding that the party starts \u201cfrom a baseline of nearly 10 000\u201d votes and could win if it attracts 5 000\u20137 000 swing voters [Annapurna Express, 31 Jan 2026]. Such pieces reinforce the impression of strong urban momentum for RSP but still fall short of a genuine poll.\n\n2. By-election and mid-term signals since 2022\nThe three simultaneous by-elections of 23 April 2023 remain the only ballot-box evidence between the 2022 and 2026 general contests. They produced landslide wins for RSP in Chitwan-2 (54 176 votes) and Tanahun-1 (34 919), while veteran Madhesi leader Upendra Yadav recaptured Bara-2 for the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) [Setopati, 26 Apr 2023]. In January 2026, a tactical Nepali Congress (NC)\u2013CPN-UML alliance swept 17 of 18 National Assembly seats, showing that the two largest machines can still convert their local-government strength into seats when they cooperate [Kathmandu Post & Xinhua, 25 Jan 2026].\n\n3. Party configurations for the 2026 race\n\u2022 Nepali Congress and UML: after their one-off upper-house pact, both insist they will \u201ccontest independently\u201d on 5 March [Nepal News, 30 Jan 2026].  \n\u2022 Left mergers: CPN-Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist) have reunited as the Nepali Communist Party (NCP) and will run on a common ticket.  \n\u2022 RSP: fielding candidates nationwide and projecting former Kathmandu mayor Balendra \u201cBalen\u201d Shah as its prime-ministerial face; it still lacks an upper-house presence.  \n\u2022 Regional/Madhes forces\u2014JSP, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), Janamat Party\u2014are competing separately, banking on vote splits among the national parties.  \n\u2022 Smaller constitutional update: President Paudel issued an ordinance adjusting the caste/ethnic quotas within the PR tier to reflect the 2021 census, slightly reducing the Khas-Arya and Janajati shares while raising Madheshi and Muslim allocations [Kathmandu Post, 19 Dec 2025]. Parties have had to amend their closed lists accordingly.\n\n4. Seat\u2013vote conversion: 2017 versus 2022\nNepal\u2019s mixed electoral system (165 first-past-the-post + 110 closed-list PR) produces markedly different seat yields from identical vote shares.\n\n2017 House of Representatives (Election Commission figures distilled in IFES guide & Nepalresearch):\n\u2022 CPN-UML \u2013 33 % of PR vote; 121 seats (44 %).  \n\u2022 CPN-Maoist Centre \u2013 14 % PR vote; 53 seats (19 %).  \n\u2022 Nepali Congress \u2013 33 % PR vote; 63 seats (23 %).  \nA tight UML\u2013Maoist alliance converted a combined 47 % of list votes into 63 % of total seats, underlining how coordinated constituency strategies multiply gains in the FPTP tier.\n\n2022 House of Representatives (final Election Commission tally reported by Rising Nepal Daily, 8 Dec 2022):\n\u2022 Nepali Congress \u2013 29.3 % PR vote (2 715 225); 89 seats (32 %).  \n\u2022 CPN-UML \u2013 30.7 % PR vote (2 845 641); 78 seats (28 %).  \n\u2022 Maoist Centre \u2013 12.7 % PR vote (1 175 684); 32 seats (12 %).  \n\u2022 RSP \u2013 12.2 % PR vote (1 130 344); 20 seats (7 %).  \nBecause the three traditional parties ran in rival alliances and a new urban force (RSP) spread its vote thinly across many districts, seat proportionality improved: the largest coalition (NC-led) won 49 % of seats on roughly 45 % of votes, a far narrower conversion premium than in 2017.\n\nMicro-evidence from Kathmandu-4 (2022 data reproduced by Annapurna Express) further illustrates how candidate-centred voting distorts overall proportionality: NC\u2019s star Gagan Thapa took 21 302 constituency votes but only 11 808 list votes, suggesting nearly 9 500 personal-rather-than-party ballots. RSP, which fielded no direct candidate, still scored 9 412 PR votes\u2014almost matching NC\u2019s party tally\u2014showing the limits of list totals as predictors of FPTP outcomes.\n\n5. Impact of the 2025 \u201cGen Z\u201d protests on party popularity\nPolitical narrative shift\n\u2022 The September 2025 youth uprising toppled the Oli\u2013Deuba coalition after 70+ deaths and forced President Paudel to appoint former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim prime minister [NPR & Carnegie Endowment, Sept 2025; Science Survey, 8 Oct 2025].  \n\u2022 Traditional parties suffered reputational damage: their offices were torched, and their leaders blamed for corruption and for ordering lethal force (Save the Children rapid assessment, 2025).  \n\u2022 The uprising popularised anti-establishment figures on Discord and other social-media platforms, boosting the visibility of RSP\u2019s Balen Shah and independent civic activists.\n\nObservable electoral repercussions\n\u2022 Youth-labelled newcomers\u2014RSP above all\u2014gained credibility from their distance to the old guard and from their visible role in protest logistics (coordination via Discord, VPN use up 8 000 % during the social-media ban\u2014Science Survey).  \n\u2022 Established parties have tried to rebrand: NC elected 49-year-old Gagan Thapa as president and prime-ministerial candidate; UML is running younger provincial chiefs in several urban seats.  \n\u2022 Alliance fatigue: all major parties now publicly reject pre-election seat-sharing arrangements, a practice denounced during the protests as cartel politics [Nepal News, 30 Jan 2026].\n\nQuantifiable evidence remains scarce. No post-September survey has measured favourability or vote intention, but the 2023 by-elections and the Kathmandu-4 numbers quoted above indicate that:\n\u2013 RSP converts protest sympathy into real votes in urban and semi-urban districts;  \n\u2013 UML\u2019s urban base has eroded, though it retains deep rural networks;  \n\u2013 Nepali Congress still benefits from candidate personal followings but risks fragmentation where incumbents shift constituencies (example: Thapa leaving Kathmandu-4).\n\n6. Institutional and demographic context of the 2026 contest\n\u2022 Voters: 18 903 689 registered, up 915 119 since 2022; 52 % are aged 18-40, giving the post-protest youth cohort potential decisive weight [Asianews.network, 30 Jan 2026].  \n\u2022 Parties: 136 registered; 120 cleared to contest, of which 63 submitted PR lists and 68 fielded FPTP candidates [ibid.]. One quarter of the registered parties were born after the Gen Z movement, confirming a surge in political entrepreneurship.  \n\u2022 Candidates: 3 406 for FPTP (1 143 independents); 3 213 on PR lists. Only 388 women are running directly, meaning gender-quota compliance will again depend heavily on the PR tier.  \n\u2022 Security and logistics: 325 000 security personnel are being deployed; the government has budgeted NPR 19.21 billion for the election, two-thirds of it for security [Asianews.network].\n\n7. Synthesis: what is known and remaining uncertainties\nKnown\n\u2022 RSP has replaced the Maoists as the principal anti-establishment pole and has proven vote-pulling power in by-elections;  \n\u2022 NC and UML can still reap a seat bonus if they coordinate, as the 2026 National Assembly vote showed; no such alliance exists for 5 March;  \n\u2022 The 2025 protests have delegitimised large pre-poll coalitions and accelerated generational turnover in candidate selection;  \n\u2022 Changes in PR quota shares slightly strengthen Madheshi and Muslim representation, forcing parties to recalibrate lists.\n\nUnknown\n\u2022 National vote-intention percentages by party since 2022.  \n\u2022 FPTP-tier popular-vote totals for 2017 and 2022 at party level (the EC publishes only constituency winners; aggregations are scattered).  \n\u2022 Hard survey data on how the protest cohort (18-29) intends to vote, or on leader favourability ratings.\n\nTo close these gaps researchers would need:\n1. Raw Election Commission spreadsheets of both PR and FPTP vote totals by party for 2017 and 2022.  \n2. Any polling micro-data held by Nepali universities (Tribhuvan U, Kathmandu U) or private agencies such as Interdisciplinary Analysts.  \n3. Turnout and margin tables for municipal by-elections held since 2022, which may reveal age-cohort swings.  \n4. Social-media sentiment analytics segmented by age and district to substitute for absent surveys.\n\nUntil such data emerge, by-election trends and constituency-level vote transfers remain the best\u2014though imperfect\u2014guide to Nepal\u2019s fluid 2026 electoral landscape.</Agent_report>\n"
