Analysis:

## 1) Resolution criteria (target variable)
Number of Oscars **won** (not nominated) by **Sinners (2025)** at the **98th Academy Awards** (ceremony March 15, 2026; resolves by March 16, 2026). Units: Oscars won.

## (a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)

**GoldDerby (Jan 22, 2026)**
- **What it is:** Awards-forecasting outlet aggregating expert picks/odds; fast post-nominations reaction.
- **Quality:** Moderate. Useful as a “wisdom-of-pundits” snapshot but prone to herding.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Mostly **opinion** (predicted wins: 4) with implied probabilities.

**Covers.com odds page (date not stated in prompt; context suggests late Jan 2026)**
- **What it is:** Betting-odds style summary (Kalshi/market-implied probabilities).
- **Quality:** Moderate-to-good as a **current sentiment indicator**; markets can be noisy but often well-calibrated near close.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Mix: factual nominations + **market-implied probabilities** (not “truth,” but informative).

**Hollywood Reporter / Scott Feinberg (Jan 23, 2026)**
- **What it is:** Named expert forecaster with industry sourcing and a track record.
- **Quality:** Good. Not infallible, but among the more credible “inside baseball” reads.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Uses factual nomination totals + **expert judgment**: projects *Sinners* 1st in Picture, 1st in Original Screenplay/Casting, but 2nd in Director and some crafts.

**Deadline nominations list (Jan 22, 2026)**
- **What it is:** Nominations list.
- **Quality:** High for facts.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Almost entirely **factual** (the 16 nominations and categories).

**SuperTalk Mississippi (Jan 30, 2026)**
- **What it is:** Local-interest reporting + brief awards-season recap.
- **Quality:** Moderate for facts; limited analytical value.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Mostly factual wins/losses at precursors; some narrative framing.

**NJArts.net (Jan 22, 2026)**
- **What it is:** Commentary on nominations and the race.
- **Quality:** Moderate; not a primary awards-forecasting authority.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Mix; “two-person race” framing is **opinion**.

**AskNews articles (late Jan–Feb 2, 2026)**
- Several are **factual nominee recaps** in other languages. Value mostly redundant with Deadline.
- **ScreenRant** pieces are commentary/speculation (weak forecasting signal).
- **Collider** article is largely unrelated to predicting *Sinners* wins.
- One item (eldiario.es) appears to contain **clear inconsistencies/errors** (e.g., mismatched nominees); I treat it as **low reliability** for specifics.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence
1) **Category-specific “front-runner” signals for *Sinners*** (Covers odds + GoldDerby + Feinberg converge on the same core set):
   - **Original Screenplay**: repeatedly framed as *Sinners*’ best above-the-line chance.
   - **Original Score**: Göransson described as extremely likely; consistent across sources.
   - **Best Casting**: repeatedly framed as a *Sinners* strength.
   Mechanism: these are discrete categories with relatively stable late-stage favorites.

2) **Competitive field + vote-splitting dynamic** (Deadline nominations + multiple forecasts):
   - *One Battle After Another* is a strong rival across Picture/Director/Editing, which tends to cap total wins for any single film in the modern era.

### Moderate evidence
3) **Feinberg projecting *Sinners* to win Best Picture**
   - If true, it usually increases expected total wins by 1-3 (Picture itself plus correlated boosts in editing/sound/acting/crafts).
   - But: other indicators (GoldDerby, Covers) still lean toward *One Battle After Another* for Picture/Director, so I treat Feinberg as a meaningful but not dominant signal.

4) **Historical base rates for “most-nominated film” not necessarily sweeping**
   - The prompt’s outside-view analysis is directionally strong: modern preferential-ballot era rarely produces 8+ wins.

### Weak evidence
5) **General “record 16 nominations” narrative**
   - It indicates breadth of support, but nomination breadth does not translate linearly into wins, especially with strong competitors in crafts.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **Feb 2, 2026**. Ceremony: **Mar 15, 2026**. Resolution by **Mar 16, 2026**.
- Time left: ~**42 days**. Final voting: **Feb 26–Mar 5**.

**If timeframe were halved (≈21 days left):**
- We’d likely have more guild/precursor outcomes that reduce uncertainty; I would **narrow** the distribution (less probability on 0-1 and 8+).

**If timeframe were doubled (≈84 days left):**
- More time for narrative swings/scandals/late precursor shocks; I would **widen** tails slightly, especially upward if momentum consolidated behind *Sinners*.

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view

### Outside-view baseline (given in prompt)
P10 2, P20 3, P40 4, P60 5, P80 6, P90 7 (central mass 3–6; median around 4–5).

### Inside-view adjustments
**What pushes wins upward (vs baseline):**
- Multiple sources converge that *Sinners* is favored in **Score + Original Screenplay + Casting** (a plausible “floor” of ~2-3 if things go normally).
- Feinberg’s **Best Picture #1** projection meaningfully raises the probability of a 5–7 outcome.

**What pushes wins downward / caps the ceiling:**
- Markets/pundits still treat **One Battle After Another** as a major winner (often Picture/Director/Editing), which suppresses *Sinners*’ sweep potential.
- Several technical categories appear plausibly “spoken for” by other films (e.g., a *Frankenstein* craft package is a common pattern in years like this), limiting *Sinners*’ high-end.

**Net effect:** I keep the **center of gravity near 4–5 wins**, but retain a real (not cosmetic) chance of a low outcome (0–2) and a thinner right tail (7–10).

Probability calibration

A quick category Fermi-style expectation (rough, not additive-certainty):
- Near-favorites: Score, Original Screenplay, Casting → expected ~2.0 wins combined.
- Competitive adds: Cinematography, Picture, Editing/Sound, select crafts/acting → expected ~2.0 more.
This supports an implied mean around **4.0–4.5** and a median around **4–5**.

So I stay close to the provided outside view, with a slightly more explicit low-end tail (recognizing shutouts can happen even to highly nominated films) and a modest but non-zero chance of 8+ if *Sinners* takes Picture and overperforms in crafts.

Checklist:
1) Target: Oscars **won** by *Sinners* at the **98th Oscars** (by Mar 16, 2026), units = count.
2) Outside view base rate used: central range **3–6**, outside-view median ~4–5.
3) Consistency: implied median ≈ 4.5; mean ≈ 4.3; aligns with “3 likely categories + a couple competitive.”
4) Key evidence:
   - Markets/pundits consistently favor *Sinners* in Score/Screenplay/Casting.
   - Strong rival (*One Battle After Another*) likely absorbs Picture/Director/Editing share.
   - Feinberg projects *Sinners* #1 for Picture (raises upper-middle outcomes).
5) Blind spot: a late-breaking consolidation behind *Sinners* (guilds + preferential ballot) could push outcome **up** into 7–9.
