Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Deadline (22 Jan 2026) – straight news; gives the full list of Sinners’ 16 nominations. High quality, purely factual.  
   b. Hollywood Reporter/Feinberg Forecast (23 Jan) – veteran awards journalist. Opinion but methodology explained (talks to voters, guild trends). Moderate-to-strong weight.  
   c. Gold Derby odds article (22 Jan) – crowd-sourced expert odds; useful directional signal but volatile. Moderate weight.  
   d. Covers.com market‐odds piece (late Jan) – cites Kalshi prices for individual categories (e.g., 65 % to win Casting). Relatively reliable for probability sizes; moderate weight.  
   e. SuperTalk MS, NJArts, Asknews foreign re-reports – factual on nomination tally only; minimal predictive value.  
   f. ScreenRant/Collider/Vogue etc. – feature pieces; mostly colour, weak predictive power.  

   Separation of fact vs. opinion: nomination counts, guild calendar, voting window = facts; “Sinners will win 4 Oscars” = opinion.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)  
   Strong evidence  
   • 16 nominations → structural opportunity to win many categories.  
   • Three categories in which both markets and pundits rate Sinners clear favourite (Original Score, Original Screenplay, Casting).  
   Moderate evidence  
   • Betting markets give 55–65 % in Cinematography, 25 % in Picture, ~14 % in Director.  
   • Modern 13 + nomination films usually win 4–7 Oscars (historical base rate).  
   Weak evidence  
   • Articles claiming a late-breaking “industry shift” toward Sinners for Best Picture – unverified narrative.  
   • Genre bias against horror-adjacent films.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Today 2 Feb 2026; ceremony 15 Mar 2026 → 42 days, with final voting 26 Feb–5 Mar.  
   • If the horizon were halved (three weeks left), guild outcomes would already be known and variance would shrink ~10 %.  
   • If doubled (12 weeks), precursors could still swing strongly; variance would widen ~15–20 %.

4. Justification / outside-view blend  
   Outside view: Modern ≥13-nom films average roughly 5-6 wins, with a fat tail on both sides.  
   Inside adjustments:  
   +2/3 locked-in style wins (Score, Screenplay, Casting) raise the floor.  
   +Cinematography is a coin-flip.  
   –Picture/Director odds still favour One Battle After Another, limiting the ceiling.  
   –Craft categories such as Costume, Production Design, Makeup likely go to Frankenstein or others.  
   Result: mean about 5½ wins; 90 % of probability between 2 and 9.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: “Number of Oscars won by Sinners at 98th Academy Awards (outcome known 16 Mar 2026).”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 4–7 wins, mean ≈5.  
3. Consistency check: median ≈5.5; mean implied ≈5.6 – aligns with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) 16 nominations; b) market odds >70 % in three categories; c) historical conversion rates for highly-nominated films; d) strong rival for Picture/Director; e) guild dates still ahead.  
5. Blind-spot: Sinners sweeps Picture + Director after surprise PGA/DGA wins, pushing total to 9–11 wins (would shift outcome upward).
