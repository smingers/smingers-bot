# Summary of IndieWire Article: "2026 Oscar Predictions: Who Will Win at the Academy Awards?"

**Source:** IndieWire  
**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Author:** Marcus Jones

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Sinners' historic nomination count:** The film received 16 Oscar nominations, breaking the all-time record by two nominations (previous record was 14, held by "All About Eve," "Titanic," and "La La Land")

- **Best Picture ranking:** According to the author's predictions, "Sinners" is ranked second most likely to win Best Picture, behind "One Battle After Another"

## Opinions from Named Sources:

**Marcus Jones (IndieWire Awards Editor):**

- Acknowledges that "Sinners'" record-breaking nominations cannot be discredited, though notes that eligible categories have shifted over time (e.g., there were two Sound categories when "Titanic" and "La La Land" were nominated)

- States that "Sinners" receiving more nominations "does not totally derail the prevailing theory that Paul Thomas Anderson's 'One Battle After Another' will win Best Picture, but it does indicate that the fellow Warner Bros. Pictures release is not the far and away frontrunner it's been thought to be"

- Notes as a "safer prediction" that the Academy will treat "One Battle" like last year's winner "Anora" and give its director Anderson an Oscar for every category he is nominated in

- Observes that Best Picture and Best Director Oscars have been split between two films "plenty of times in recent history"

- Highlights that if Ryan Coogler wins Best Director for "Sinners," he would be "the first ever Black filmmaker to win the Oscar category in its near century-old history"

## Additional Context:

- The article mentions that Miles Caton, a breakout star from "Sinners," was "fully snubbed" despite being in play for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Song for "Last Time (I Seen the Sun)." He is only credited as performer for "I Lied to You," the nominated song from the soundtrack.

# Summary of "2026 Oscar Predictions: Can Sinners Become the New Frontrunner?" - Awards Daily

## Key Statistics and Historical Context:

**Preferential Ballot Era Analysis:**
- Only four films in the preferential ballot era have received 13+ nominations: La La Land, Oppenheimer, Emilia Perez, and Gone with the Wind
- Of those, only two won Best Picture: Gone with the Wind and Oppenheimer
- In the modern expanded ballot era, 7 Oscars is the maximum won by Best Picture winners (Oppenheimer and Everything Everywhere All At Once)
- Films that won 7+ Oscars historically came from the era with only five Best Picture nominees

**Sinners' Competitive Position:**
- Sinners received 16 nominations (record-breaking)
- Its main competitor, "One Battle After Another," received 13 nominations but lacks nominations in visual effects, makeup, and costumes
- Sinners "cost less and made more than One Battle After Another"
- The film had strong theatrical performance, which the author emphasizes as exceptional in the current environment

## Opinions from the Author (Awards Daily - unnamed individual author):

**On Sinners' 16 Nominations:**
- Describes it as "a blessing and a curse"
- Notes the film crosses into all different genres and had "excellent crafts that would make it qualify for every category"
- Attributes high nomination count partly to "a weak year where many films disappointed, especially Wicked: For Good"

**Prediction/Argument:**
- States Sinners "looks to me like an offer the Academy can't and shouldn't refuse"
- Believes "its success is undeniable" and compares it favorably to Top Gun: Maverick
- Argues the Academy needs to stay connected to "the real world" and "the pulse of the zeitgeist"
- Notes Sinners, unlike some past winners, "is actually a film people saw and a film people remember"

**Concerns About Vote-Splitting:**
- Warns that if Sinners wins Best Picture but Paul Thomas Anderson wins Best Director (for presumably "One Battle After Another"), it would be "the third time a film by a Black director won without winning Best Director" (after 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight)
- If Sinners only wins Original Screenplay or Original Score, the author suggests this would undermine the Academy's diversity efforts

**On the Modern Academy:**
- Notes 3,000 new voters have changed voting patterns
- States this new group "follow the critics more than they do even the industry"
- Cites recent pattern of concentrated voting on single films: Parasite, CODA, Everything Everywhere All At Once

**Historical Precedent Concern:**
- Acknowledges "it would be highly unusual for a horror film featuring vampires to win Best Picture, let alone Best Director"

## Note on Source Reliability:
This is an opinion piece from Awards Daily (author not named in the extracted content). The historical statistics appear to be factual, but the predictions and arguments represent the author's personal analysis and advocacy for Sinners to win, rather than objective reporting.

Query: Summarize guild and critics awards results for Sinners 2025 film and compare category strengths vs competitors ahead of 98th Oscars
Ryan Coogler’s Sinners (Warner Bros.) has piled up an exceptional haul from both the Hollywood guilds and the nationwide critics groups in the run-up to the 98th Academy Awards, positioning itself as the chief challenger to Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another (OBAA).  Below is a synthesis of every guild or critics result contained in the search set, followed by a head-to-head look at the film’s categorical strengths and the information that is still missing.

1.  Guild performance to date  
   •  Directors Guild of America – nominee, Outstanding Directorial Achievement (Ryan Coogler) (IMDb awards page).  
   •  Producers Guild of America – nominee, Darryl F. Zanuck Award (IMDb awards page).  
   •  Writers Guild of America – nominee, Original Screenplay (Los Angeles Times, 27 Jan 2026).  
   •  Screen Actors Guild – nominee, Outstanding Cast + nominee, Stunt Ensemble (IMDb awards page).  
   •  American Society of Cinematographers – nominee, Theatrical Feature (IMDb awards page).  
   •  American Cinema Editors (ACE Eddie) – no data yet in the provided results.  
   •  Cinema Audio Society – nominee, Live-Action Feature (IMDb awards page).  
   •  Art Directors Guild – nominee, Excellence in Production Design – Period Feature (IMDb awards page).  
   •  Casting Society of America (Artios) – nominee, Big-Budget Drama (IMDb awards page).  
   •  Guild of Music Supervisors – most-nominated film this year: 3 nods (best supervision-major film + 2 songs) (Hollywood Reporter, 14 Jan 2026).  
   •  Costume Designers Guild, Make-Up Artists & Hair Stylists Guild, Motion Picture Sound Editors, Visual Effects Society – not reflected in current results.

   Bottom line: Sinners has already secured nominations from every “big four” guild that has announced (PGA, DGA, WGA, SAG) plus key crafts (ASC, CAS, ADG) and leads the GMS awards.  That breadth equals OBAA so far and exceeds Frankenstein, Hamnet and Marty Supreme, which do not appear in every list above.

2.  Critics awards snapshot  
   •  Sweeps/Best-Picture style wins: Boston Society of Film Critics, Washington DC Area FCC, San Diego FCS, National Board of Review Top Ten, AFI Movie of the Year and numerous regional critics citations (consolidated on the IMDb page).  
   •  Chicago Indie Critics – field-leading 10 wins including Best Film, Director, Actor, Ensemble, Editing, Cinematography & Sound (AwardsWatch, 16 Jan 2026).  
   •  Critics Choice Awards – 4 wins (Original Screenplay, Casting/Ensemble, Score, Young Actor) from 17 nominations; lost Best Picture & Director to OBAA (Hollywood Reporter, 5 Jan 2026).  
   •  Golden Globes – wins for Original Score and the box-office achievement trophy; nominations for Drama Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay, Song (GoldenGlobes.com).  

   Verdict: Among critics, Sinners has dominated the screenplay, score, ensemble/casting and multiple craft categories, while OBAA has edged it for overall picture and direction at the larger televised shows (Globes drama picture, Critics Choice picture/director).

3.  Category-by-category strength versus principal rivals  

   A. Best Picture  
   – Guild metric: Sinners, like OBAA, now owns that crucial quartet of PGA / DGA / SAG / WGA nominations—a threshold hit by 8 of the last 10 Oscar winners.  Frankenstein, Hamnet, etc., have not (no SAG ensemble for them).  
   – Critics metric: Sinners leads the regional critics tally; OBAA leads the televised critics prizes.  Race looks genuinely two-horse.

   B. Director  
   – Coogler carries DGA and multiple critics wins but lost Critics Choice and Globe to Anderson.  Still a top-tier threat, but momentum leans slightly to Anderson.

   C. Original Screenplay  
   – Sinners won Critics Choice and Chicago Critics; WGA nomination locked.  No other contender has a parallel sweep, making Coogler the Oscar frontrunner here.

   D. Lead Actor  
   – Michael B. Jordan: Critics wins (Chicago), major nominations (Globe, Critics Choice, Oscar); no SAG individual nomination in the data (SAG noms aren’t final yet).  OBAA’s Leonardo Di Caprio won neither Globe nor Critics Choice; Marty Supreme’s Timothée Chalamet took Critics Choice.  Actor race is divided; Sinners not dominant.

   E. Supporting Actress / Supporting Actor  
   – Wunmi Mosaku (nominee Globe + Critics Choice) and Delroy Lindo (Oscar nom) give the film depth, but no critics or guild wins surfaced yet.  Conversely OBAA’s Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn have won key critics prizes.

   F. Ensemble / Casting (new Oscar category)  
   – Francine Maisler won the inaugural Critics Choice casting award, plus Artios nomination and SAG ensemble nod.  Sinners is the early favorite here.

   G. Score & Song  
   – Ludwig Göransson won Golden Globe & Critics Choice, Chicago Critics and many regionals; plus two GMS best-song nominations and Oscar nomination.  Score appears locked for Sinners; song race is between Sinners selections and K-Pop Demon Hunters’ Golden.

   H. Cinematography  
   – ASC nomination, Chicago Critics win.  Rivals: F1 (Claudio Miranda, Critics Choice win), Frankenstein (Dan Laustsen), Hamnet (Łukasz Żal).  Sinners is competitive but not dominant.

   I. Editing, Sound, Production Design, Costumes, Makeup, Visual Effects  
   – Editing: Chicago Critics win, ACE nominations still TBA.  
   – Sound: CAS nomination and Chicago Critics win; F1 (Critics Choice sound win) and Warfare loom.  
   – Production Design: ADG nomination; Frankenstein just won Critics Choice.  
   – Costume & Makeup: Sinners has Critics Choice noms but Frankenstein has already swept Critics Choice wins.  
   – VFX: Critics Choice nomination only; Avatar and F1 ahead.

   In short, Sinners’ clearest Oscar advantages are Original Screenplay, Score, Casting/Ensemble, and a possibly co-favoured position in Picture and Director.  It is an across-the-board contender but faces stiffer competition from OBAA in Picture/Director/Actor and from Frankenstein or F1 in several craft races.

4.  Remaining information gaps  
   •  Final nomination lists (and later winners) for ACE Eddie, Costume Designers Guild, Make-Up & Hair Stylists Guild, Visual Effects Society, Motion Picture Sound Editors and Producers Guild winners have not been captured.  
   •  Whether Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku scored individual SAG nominations is not yet established.  
   •  We lack direct guild tallies for the competitors (OBAA, Frankenstein, Hamnet) to quantify “nominations vs wins” side-by-side.  
   •  PGA, DGA, SAG, and WGA winners will be critical once announced and are still pending.

5.  Suggested follow-up searches (to close gaps, if needed later)  
   – Producers Guild Awards 2026 nominees list  
   – ACE Eddie nominations 2026 film  
   – Costume Designers Guild nominees 2026  
   – Visual Effects Society nominations 2026  
   – SAG Awards 2026 film nominations  

With those data points Sinners’ guild-score spreadsheet could be finalized and a more granular numeric comparison produced.  Nonetheless, based on the current evidence Sinners enters the final stretch of awards season with the widest guild footprint and the most critics support of any contender, and leads unequivocally in Original Screenplay, Score and Casting, while OBAA presently edges it for televised Best Picture/Director honors and Frankenstein dominates the craft-heavy design fields.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
