Analysis:
Sinners has 16 nominations – the most ever – which places it in elite company but also highlights the historical difficulty of translating many nominations into many wins.  
Key reference points:  
• All About Eve (1950) turned 14 nominations into 6 wins; Titanic (1997) converted 14 into 11; La La Land (2016) converted 14 into 6.  
• No film has ever exceeded 11 wins.  
• Horror films rarely dominate the top categories (Silence of the Lambs is the lone Best-Picture winner), but Sinners’ unprecedented nomination haul and wide guild support reported so far suggest it is a major cross-genre contender.  
To gauge a realistic win total we need:  
1. Pre-Oscar precursor awards (Producers Guild, Directors Guild, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA, Critics’ Choice) to see where Sinners is actually winning vs. merely being nominated.  
2. Category-level competition (e.g., how strong are rival frontrunners like The Conquistador or The Timekeepers in technical races?).  
3. Historical conversion rates when a film leads the field by 3-plus nominations.  
Collecting this data will allow us to estimate a probability distribution over 0-16 wins, with special attention to the record-tying threshold (11) and record-breaking outcomes (12-16).
