The 'Best Director' nominees are Paul Thomas Anderson, Chloe Zhao, Josh Safdie, Ryan Coogler (known for 'Black Panther' and 'Creed'), and Joachim Trier. In 'Best Actor,' Leonardo DiCaprio ('The Master of the Battle'), Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet ('Marty the Magnificent'), Wagner Moura ('The Secret Agent'), and Michael B. Jordan ('The Sinners') are in contention, with DiCaprio facing strong competition from Chalamet. In 'Best Actress,' Jessie Buckley ('Gumnet'), Rose Byrne ('I Would Kick You If I Could'), Renate Reinsve ('Sentimental Value'), Emma Stone ('Bougainvillea'), and Kate Hudson ('Melodies of Their Dreams') are nominated. The 'Best International Feature Film' category includes 'The Secret Agent' (Brazil), 'The Voice of Hind Rajab' (Tunisia, co-produced with France, UK, directed by Kaouther Ben Hania), 'A Simple Accident' (Iran, directed by Jafar Panahi, banned in Iran until 2030), 'Sentimental Value' (Norway), and 'Siraat' (Spain, directed by Oliver Laxe).

The film's record-breaking haul includes a surprise Best Supporting Actor nomination for Delroy Lindo. 'Sinners' is widely expected to win multiple awards, drawing little controversy. In contrast, 'Shakespeare in Love'\u2014which won Best Picture at the 1999 Oscars\u2014remains one of the most controversial winners in Academy history. The film, directed by John Madden, earned $279.5 million globally on a $26 million budget, making it the second-highest-grossing Miramax film of all time and one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1998. Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Best Actress win for portraying Viola De Lesseps is frequently cited as one of the worst of the 1990s.

Despite this record-breaking achievement, the movie was notably snubbed in the Best Supporting Actor category for Jack O'Connell, whose performance was widely praised as pivotal to the film\u2019s impact. Critics highlighted his standout scene leading a vampire hive in a dance to 'Rocky Road to Dublin,' describing his portrayal as a powerful embodiment of monstrous transformation and emotional depth. Although Delroy Lindo received a nomination in the same category, O'Connell\u2019s absence was seen as a significant oversight. The article suggests that O'Connell may secure his first Oscar nomination in 2027, particularly due to his acclaimed role in '28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,' a film expected to receive strong recognition as horror genres gain greater Academy appreciation. The piece is written by Dhruv, a Lead Writer at Screen Rant, who emphasizes O'Connell\u2019s rising prominence and the likelihood of future award consideration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:43 AM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/oscars-2026-jack-o-connell-sinners-snub/)\n\n**It Looked Dead, But There's Hope A Great 3-Year Oscars Streak Continues In 2026**\nThe 2026 Academy Awards are shaping up with several seemingly secure frontrunners, including Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, who is nearly certain to win Best Original Score for 'Sinners,' and Paul Thomas Anderson, poised for his first Oscar win in Best Director for 'One Battle After Another.' However, the most dominant contender is Jessie Buckley for Best Actress, whose performance in 'Hamnet' has generated consistent acclaim since the fall film festivals. Buckley, who has yet to win an Oscar despite multiple acclaimed roles, is leading in all major precursor awards. Nevertheless, there is a growing possibility of a competitive two-person race, as Rose Byrne has emerged as a strong challenger for her role in 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.' Byrne won the Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy category, a category often exploited by campaigns to elevate contenders. Though her film is less widely seen than 'Hamnet,' Byrne\u2019s sustained critical attention and recent accolades\u2014such as a Berlin Film Festival win\u2014have solidified her as a serious threat. If Buckley\u2019s dominance becomes too predictable, some voters may feel emboldened to support Byrne, potentially leading to a surprise outcome reminiscent of past years, such as Olivia Colman\u2019s upset over Glenn Close. This potential for an unexpected result adds excitement to the Best Actress category, making it one of the most anticipated races of the season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 11:23 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/oscars-2026-best-actress-jessie-buckley-rose-byrne-trend/)\n\n**Oscars 2026 Nominations: Quick Guide to the Main Categories**\nThe nominations for the 98th Academy Awards, the most prestigious film ceremony of the year, were announced on January 22, 2025, revealing a highly competitive race among several films, actors, and directors that defined 2025.

Despite being a top contender, 'Sinners' was not universally predicted. The author, who has covered awards season for 12 years, expressed surprise at several snubs, including the complete absence of 'Wicked: For Good' from all categories and Paul Mescal's omission for his role in 'Hamnet,' leaving Jessie Buckley as the sole representative for Chloe Zhao's adaptation. Notable surprises included Emma Stone's Best Actress nomination for 'Bugonia,' the film's inclusion in Best Picture, Kate Hudson's nod for 'Song Sung Blue,' and Ethan Hawke's Best Actor nomination\u2014all of which have significantly reshaped the race.

Jordan, is poised to receive 15 nominations at the 2026 Oscars, potentially making it the most nominated film in Academy history. This would surpass the previous record of 14 nominations held by 'Titanic' since 1998. 'Sinners' is expected to be nominated across nearly all categories, including multiple nods in acting and musical awards. The film faces strong competition from other 2025 releases such as 'Hamnet' by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, which is also considered a top contender. However, despite the record-breaking nomination count, the article notes that historical trends suggest the Academy often overlooks horror or fantasy films, meaning 'Sinners' may not win all its categories even if it achieves the most nominations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[SDPnoticias.com](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/espectaculos/cine/sinners-domina-las-predicciones-de-los-premios-oscar-2026)\n\n**Why Sinners Could Win the 2026 Oscars**\nSinners, directed by Ryan Coogler, is emerging as a leading contender for the 2026 Oscars, having dominated the Critics Choice Awards with 17 nominations, including Best Picture. It leads titles such as Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 'A Battle After Another', Josh Safdie\u2019s 'Marty Supreme', Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s 'Hamnet', and Joachim Trier\u2019s 'Sentimental Value'. The film, set in 1930s Mississippi during the end of Prohibition, follows twin former Chicago gangsters returning to Louisiana to open a Black-only blues club\u2014a symbol of freedom in a deeply segregated society. On opening night, the celebration turns into a nightmare when three white men arrive, followed by a vampire siege that transforms the club into a battleground. The film uses vampirism as a metaphor for racial exploitation and predation. While the Academy has historically overlooked horror and genre films\u2014except for rare cases like 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1992) and 'Get Out' (2018)\u2014the enthusiastic reception of 'Substance' at the 2025 Oscars may signal a shift in Academy taste, potentially opening the door for Sinners to break through. Coogler, already known for revitalizing the Rocky franchise and creating global cultural phenomena with 'Black Panther', is seen as a major influence in contemporary cinema, and Sinners marks his most personal and ambitious project yet.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[Vogue Paris](https://www.vogue.fr/article/sinners-film-cinema-oscars-2026)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
