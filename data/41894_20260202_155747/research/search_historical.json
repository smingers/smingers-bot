Below is a synthesis of every guild or critics result contained in the search set, followed by a head-to-head look at the film\u2019s categorical strengths and the information that is still missing.\n\n1.  Guild performance to date  \n   \u2022  Directors Guild of America \u2013 nominee, Outstanding Directorial Achievement (Ryan Coogler) (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  Producers Guild of America \u2013 nominee, Darryl F. Zanuck Award (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  Writers Guild of America \u2013 nominee, Original Screenplay (Los Angeles Times, 27 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022  Screen Actors Guild \u2013 nominee, Outstanding Cast + nominee, Stunt Ensemble (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  American Society of Cinematographers \u2013 nominee, Theatrical Feature (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  American Cinema Editors (ACE Eddie) \u2013 no data yet in the provided results.  \n   \u2022  Cinema Audio Society \u2013 nominee, Live-Action Feature (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  Art Directors Guild \u2013 nominee, Excellence in Production Design \u2013 Period Feature (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  Casting Society of America (Artios) \u2013 nominee, Big-Budget Drama (IMDb awards page).  \n   \u2022  Guild of Music Supervisors \u2013 most-nominated film this year: 3 nods (best supervision-major film + 2 songs) (Hollywood Reporter, 14 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022  Costume Designers Guild, Make-Up Artists & Hair Stylists Guild, Motion Picture Sound Editors, Visual Effects Society \u2013 not reflected in current results.\n\n   Bottom line: Sinners has already secured nominations from every \u201cbig four\u201d guild that has announced (PGA, DGA, WGA, SAG) plus key crafts (ASC, CAS, ADG) and leads the GMS awards.  That breadth equals OBAA so far and exceeds Frankenstein, Hamnet and Marty Supreme, which do not appear in every list above.\n\n2.  Critics awards snapshot  \n   \u2022  Sweeps/Best-Picture style wins: Boston Society of Film Critics, Washington DC Area FCC, San Diego FCS, National Board of Review Top Ten, AFI Movie of the Year and numerous regional critics citations (consolidated on the IMDb page).  \n   \u2022  Chicago Indie Critics \u2013 field-leading 10 wins including Best Film, Director, Actor, Ensemble, Editing, Cinematography & Sound (AwardsWatch, 16 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022  Critics Choice Awards \u2013 4 wins (Original Screenplay, Casting/Ensemble, Score, Young Actor) from 17 nominations; lost Best Picture & Director to OBAA (Hollywood Reporter, 5 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022  Golden Globes \u2013 wins for Original Score and the box-office achievement trophy; nominations for Drama Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay, Song (GoldenGlobes.com).  \n\n   Verdict: Among critics, Sinners has dominated the screenplay, score, ensemble/casting and multiple craft categories, while OBAA has edged it for overall picture and direction at the larger televised shows (Globes drama picture, Critics Choice picture/director).\n\n3.  Category-by-category strength versus principal rivals  \n\n   A. Best Picture  \n   \u2013 Guild metric: Sinners, like OBAA, now owns that crucial quartet of PGA / DGA / SAG / WGA nominations\u2014a threshold hit by 8 of the last 10 Oscar winners.  Frankenstein, Hamnet, etc., have not (no SAG ensemble for them).  \n   \u2013 Critics metric: Sinners leads the regional critics tally; OBAA leads the televised critics prizes.  Race looks genuinely two-horse.\n\n   B. Director  \n   \u2013 Coogler carries DGA and multiple critics wins but lost Critics Choice and Globe to Anderson.  Still a top-tier threat, but momentum leans slightly to Anderson.\n\n   C. Original Screenplay  \n   \u2013 Sinners won Critics Choice and Chicago Critics; WGA nomination locked.  No other contender has a parallel sweep, making Coogler the Oscar frontrunner here.\n\n   D. Lead Actor  \n   \u2013 Michael B. Jordan: Critics wins (Chicago), major nominations (Globe, Critics Choice, Oscar); no SAG individual nomination in the data (SAG noms aren\u2019t final yet).  OBAA\u2019s Leonardo Di Caprio won neither Globe nor Critics Choice; Marty Supreme\u2019s Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet took Critics Choice.  Actor race is divided; Sinners not dominant.\n\n   E. Supporting Actress / Supporting Actor  \n   \u2013 Wunmi Mosaku (nominee Globe + Critics Choice) and Delroy Lindo (Oscar nom) give the film depth, but no critics or guild wins surfaced yet.  Conversely OBAA\u2019s Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn have won key critics prizes.\n\n   F. Ensemble / Casting (new Oscar category)  \n   \u2013 Francine Maisler won the inaugural Critics Choice casting award, plus Artios nomination and SAG ensemble nod.  Sinners is the early favorite here.\n\n   G. Score & Song  \n   \u2013 Ludwig G\u00f6ransson won Golden Globe & Critics Choice, Chicago Critics and many regionals; plus two GMS best-song nominations and Oscar nomination.  Score appears locked for Sinners; song race is between Sinners selections and K-Pop Demon Hunters\u2019 Golden.\n\n   H. Cinematography  \n   \u2013 ASC nomination, Chicago Critics win.  Rivals: F1 (Claudio Miranda, Critics Choice win), Frankenstein (Dan Laustsen), Hamnet (\u0141ukasz \u017bal).  Sinners is competitive but not dominant.\n\n   I. Editing, Sound, Production Design, Costumes, Makeup, Visual Effects  \n   \u2013 Editing: Chicago Critics win, ACE nominations still TBA.  \n   \u2013 Sound: CAS nomination and Chicago Critics win; F1 (Critics Choice sound win) and Warfare loom.  \n   \u2013 Production Design: ADG nomination; Frankenstein just won Critics Choice.  \n   \u2013 Costume & Makeup: Sinners has Critics Choice noms but Frankenstein has already swept Critics Choice wins.  \n   \u2013 VFX: Critics Choice nomination only; Avatar and F1 ahead.\n\n   In short, Sinners\u2019 clearest Oscar advantages are Original Screenplay, Score, Casting/Ensemble, and a possibly co-favoured position in Picture and Director.  It is an across-the-board contender but faces stiffer competition from OBAA in Picture/Director/Actor and from Frankenstein or F1 in several craft races.\n\n4.  Remaining information gaps  \n   \u2022  Final nomination lists (and later winners) for ACE Eddie, Costume Designers Guild, Make-Up & Hair Stylists Guild, Visual Effects Society, Motion Picture Sound Editors and Producers Guild winners have not been captured.  \n   \u2022  Whether Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku scored individual SAG nominations is not yet established.  \n   \u2022  We lack direct guild tallies for the competitors (OBAA, Frankenstein, Hamnet) to quantify \u201cnominations vs wins\u201d side-by-side.  \n   \u2022  PGA, DGA, SAG, and WGA winners will be critical once announced and are still pending.\n\n5.  Suggested follow-up searches (to close gaps, if needed later)  \n   \u2013 Producers Guild Awards 2026 nominees list  \n   \u2013 ACE Eddie nominations 2026 film  \n   \u2013 Costume Designers Guild nominees 2026  \n   \u2013 Visual Effects Society nominations 2026  \n   \u2013 SAG Awards 2026 film nominations  \n\nWith those data points Sinners\u2019 guild-score spreadsheet could be finalized and a more granular numeric comparison produced.  Nonetheless, based on the current evidence Sinners enters the final stretch of awards season with the widest guild footprint and the most critics support of any contender, and leads unequivocally in Original Screenplay, Score and Casting, while OBAA presently edges it for televised Best Picture/Director honors and Frankenstein dominates the craft-heavy design fields.</Agent_report>\n"
