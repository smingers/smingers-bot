# Forecasting Analysis: 2026 WBC Knockout Stage Run Total

## Checklist Item 1: Target Variable
**Total runs scored in 7 knockout games (4 QF, 2 SF, 1 Final) of 2026 WBC, March 13-17, 2026**

## (a) Source Analysis

**Context Summaries (Pre-tournament structure):**
- **World Baseball Network (April 2025)**: High quality. Confirms 20-team field, 7-game knockout format (4 QF, 2 SF, 1 Final). Factual tournament structure information.
- **Just Baseball (Feb 2, 2026)**: High quality, very recent. Confirms dates (March 13-14 QF, March 15-16 SF, March 17 Final), venues, single-elimination format. 30-player rosters announced Feb 5.
- **MLB.com**: High quality official source. Confirms pool structure and knockout progression.
- **The Athletic (Feb 2, 2026)**: High quality. **Critical information**: Puerto Rico may withdraw 8-10 players due to insurance issues, including Francisco Lindor and Carlos Correa. This could significantly weaken one potential knockout team.
- **ESPN (Jan 2026)**: Medium quality opinion piece. Predicts Dominican Republic to win; lists strong rosters but purely speculative.

**AskNews Articles (Recent roster/team news):**
- **Multiple sources (Feb 3-4, 2026)**: Masataka Yoshida confirmed for Japan (strong 2023 performer: 13 RBIs). Juan Soto confirmed for Dominican Republic ($2.23B roster value). Clayton Kershaw (38, retired) joining USA but acknowledges limited role.
- **Team USA roster (Dec 31, 2025)**: Confirmed elite players - Aaron Judge, Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, Cal Raleigh, Kyle Schwarber. Strong offensive lineup.
- **Japan roster (Feb 4, 2026)**: 9 MLB players including Ohtani (hitting only), Yamamoto, Yoshida. Very strong team defending title.
- **Strategy articles (Feb 4, 2026)**: South Korea planning to target Taiwan game specifically; competitive pool play expected.

**Historical Data (Agent Report):**
- 2023 (7 games): 76 runs, 10.9 runs/game
- 2017 (3 games): 18 runs, 6.0 runs/game  
- 2013 (3 games): 12 runs, 4.0 runs/game
- 2009 (3 games): 33 runs, 11.0 runs/game
- 2006 (3 games): 26 runs, 8.7 runs/game

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Tournament format confirmed**: 7 games (4 QF + 2 SF + 1 Final) matching 2023 structure. This is the only directly comparable reference class.
- **2023 baseline**: 76 runs in identical format provides strong anchor point (10.9 runs/game)
- **Elite roster quality confirmed**: Multiple sources confirm top MLB talent participating (Ohtani, Judge, Soto, etc.), suggesting high offensive capability similar to 2023

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Historical variance**: Per-game averages across all tournaments range 4.0-11.0 runs/game, showing substantial volatility. 2023's 10.9 was at the high end but 2009 was similar (11.0).
- **Puerto Rico roster concerns**: Insurance issues may weaken one potential knockout team, but (1) uncertain if they'll advance, (2) unclear final roster impact, (3) other strong teams remain
- **Pitching quality**: Modern WBC features elite pitchers (Skubal, Skenes, Yamamoto), but also elite hitters. Historically, knockout stages don't show systematic scoring suppression vs pool play.
- **Competitive balance**: News suggests multiple strong contenders (Japan, USA, Dominican Republic, Venezuela), which can produce both blowouts and tight games

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Expert predictions**: ESPN's Dominican Republic prediction is pure speculation
- **Individual player narratives**: Yoshida's 2023 performance doesn't predict 2026 tournament-wide scoring
- **Weather/venue factors**: Not discussed in sources; Miami in mid-March typically mild

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 43 days until resolution (Feb 4 → March 19, 2026)

**If halved (21 days):** Would be mid-tournament; some pool results known, clearer picture of which teams advance and their offensive strength. Uncertainty would decrease significantly.

**If doubled (86 days):** Would be pre-tournament by ~1 month. Minimal additional information; perhaps injury updates or final roster tweaks. Uncertainty similar to current.

**Current position:** Rosters nearly finalized (announced Feb 5-6), pool compositions known, but no games played. Substantial uncertainty remains about: (1) which 8 teams advance, (2) matchup dynamics, (3) pitcher usage/fatigue, (4) game competitiveness.

## (d) Justification & Outside View Calibration

### Checklist Item 2: Base Rate
**2023 WBC knockout stage: 76 runs in 7 games (10.9 runs/game)**

### Key Factors Influencing Prediction:

**1. Format Identity (Strong +)**: 2026 uses identical 7-game knockout structure to 2023. This is the most critical factor anchoring prediction near 76 runs.

**2. Historical Variance (Moderate -)**: Pre-2023 tournaments showed wide per-game range (4.0-11.0). While format was different (3 games), this demonstrates baseball's inherent scoring volatility. Applying historical mean (8.7 runs/game) to 7 games yields ~61 runs, suggesting 2023 may have been above average.

**3. Roster Quality (Moderate +)**: Confirmed elite talent on multiple teams (USA, Japan, Dominican Republic) suggests offensive firepower comparable to 2023. No evidence of systematic talent decline.

**4. Puerto Rico Uncertainty (Weak -)**: Insurance issues may weaken one team, but impact on tournament-wide scoring uncertain and limited to one potential participant.

**5. Structural Baseball Trends (Weak +)**: Modern MLB features higher strikeout rates but also more power. Net effect unclear for international play.

### Distribution Reasoning:

**Central Tendency:** The 2023 result (76 runs) provides the strongest anchor. However, acknowledging this is a single observation with high variance sport, I'll center slightly lower around 68-72 runs (median ~70) to account for potential regression toward historical mean.

**Lower Tail (P10-P20):** Must account for scenarios resembling 2013/2017 low-scoring tournaments. If 2026 features:
- Dominant pitching performances (multiple 1-0, 2-1 games)
- Weather delays/shortened games (unlikely but possible)
- Defensive-oriented matchups
Then 7 games × 6-7 runs/game = 42-49 runs is plausible lower bound.

**Upper Tail (P80-P90):** Must account for high-scoring scenarios:
- Multiple blowouts (like 2023's USA 14-2 Cuba)
- Offensive explosions in favorable conditions
- Extra-inning games (add runs)
Then 7 games × 12-13 runs/game = 84-91 runs is plausible upper bound.

**Uncertainty Calibration:** With only one comparable tournament and baseball's inherent randomness, 80% confidence interval should span ~45 runs (from P10 to P90), reflecting genuine uncertainty about scoring environment.

### Checklist Item 3: Consistency Check
**Implied median ≈ 70 runs; mean ≈ 71 runs. This makes sense: slightly below 2023's 76 but well above historical 3-game tournaments when adjusted for format. Reflects modest regression toward mean while respecting format identity.**

### Checklist Item 4: Most Significant Evidence

1. **2023 WBC had 76 runs in identical 7-game knockout format** (factual, high quality)
2. **Historical per-game scoring ranges 4.0-11.0 across tournaments** (factual, shows high variance)
3. **Elite MLB rosters confirmed for multiple teams** (factual, suggests offensive capability)
4. **Single observation of 7-game format creates substantial uncertainty** (structural limitation)
5. **No systematic evidence of scoring environment change from 2023** (absence of evidence)

### Checklist Item 5: Blind Spot
**"The 2026 knockout stage features unusually dominant pitching (multiple no-hitters or 1-run games) and/or weather-shortened games, producing scoring more like 2013 (4 runs/game × 7 = 28 runs)."** This would push outcome DOWN significantly, potentially below the 29.5 lower bound. My forecast may be anchoring too heavily on 2023's high scoring.

Alternative blind spot: "Multiple extra-inning games and offensive explosions produce 2009-level scoring (11 runs/game × 7 = 77+ runs)," pushing outcome UP to 90-100 range.

### Final Calibration:

Given:
- Strong anchor to 2023 (76 runs)
- Moderate evidence for regression toward historical mean
- High inherent uncertainty in baseball scoring
- Need for wide confidence intervals

I'll construct a distribution centered around 68-70 (slightly below 2023) with substantial tails to capture uncertainty:

**Percentile 10: 48** (reflects 2017-level scoring: ~6.9 runs/game)
**Percentile 20: 56** (reflects below-average but not extreme: ~8.0 runs/game)
**Percentile 40: 66** (reflects modest regression from 2023: ~9.4 runs/game)
**Percentile 60: 74** (reflects near-2023 levels: ~10.6 runs/game)
**Percentile 80: 84** (reflects above-2023 scoring: ~12.0 runs/game)
**Percentile 90: 94** (reflects very high-scoring tournament: ~13.4 runs/game)

This distribution:
- Centers median at 70 (between P40 and P60)
- Maintains 80% CI width of 46 runs (48-94), reflecting genuine uncertainty
- Respects 2023 baseline while allowing for variance
- Extends beyond question bounds at both ends (acknowledging tail risks)
