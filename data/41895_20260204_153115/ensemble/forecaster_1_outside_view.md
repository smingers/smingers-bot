- Per-game averages: 2023 (10.9), 2009 (11.0), 2006 (8.7), 2017 (6.0), 2013 (4.0)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All WBC knockout stages (2006-2023)**: 
   - Mean: 33 runs, but highly skewed by format change
   - Not suitable due to structural change in 2023

2. **Pre-2023 WBC knockout stages (3-game format)**:
   - Data: 26, 33, 12, 18 runs
   - Mean: 22.25, Median: 22, Range: 12-33
   - Not suitable: 2026 will use 7-game format like 2023

3. **2023 WBC knockout stage only (7-game format)**:
   - Single data point: 76 runs
   - Most suitable: Same format expected for 2026
   - Per-game average: 10.9 runs/game
   - Limitation: Only one observation

4. **Per-game scoring rates across all tournaments**:
   - Range: 4.0 to 11.0 runs per game (tournament averages)
   - 2023 and 2009 were highest scoring
   - Could project 7 games × various per-game rates

**Chosen Reference Class:** The 2023 WBC knockout stage (76 runs, 7 games) is most suitable as it shares the same tournament structure. However, I'll also consider per-game variance from historical tournaments.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Today: February 4, 2026
- Resolution: March 19, 2026
- Time horizon: ~43 days (about 6 weeks)
- The 2026 WBC knockout stage will occur in mid-March 2026

**Historical Patterns:**
- Tournament occurs every 3-4 years (2006, 2009, 2013, 2017, 2023, 2026)
- Knockout stage typically spans 3-5 days
- 2023 established the 7-game knockout format (4 QF, 2 SF, 1 Final)
- High variance in scoring: tournament-average runs per game ranged from 4.0 (2013) to 11.0 (2009)
- 2023's 76 runs came from competitive games with mix of blowouts (USA 14-2 over Cuba) and tight contests (Japan 3-2 over USA)

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from 2023:**
The 2026 tournament will almost certainly use the same 7-game knockout format as 2023, making that tournament the primary reference point. The 2023 knockout stage produced 76 runs.

**Factors Suggesting Similar or Higher Scoring:**
- Same format (7 games)
- Modern baseball trends toward higher offense
- Elite international talent continues to improve
- Competitive balance can create more runs

**Factors Suggesting Lower Scoring:**
- 2023 may have been an outlier (10.9 runs/game vs historical 4.0-11.0 range)
- Pitching quality in knockout stage typically improves (best teams advance)
- 2013 and 2017 showed very low scoring (12 and 18 runs in 3 games)
- If 2026 featured 2013-level per-game scoring (4.0), we'd expect 7 × 4.0 = 28 runs
- If 2026 featured 2017-level per-game scoring (6.0), we'd expect 7 × 6.0 = 42 runs

**Statistical Considerations:**
- With only one observation of the 7-game format, uncertainty is high
- Per-game scoring average across all tournaments: (26+33+12+18+76)/(3+3+3+3+7) = 165/19 ≈ 8.7 runs/game
- Applying 8.7 runs/game to 7 games: 7 × 8.7 ≈ 61 runs
- Standard deviation of per-game averages across tournaments is substantial (roughly 2.5-3 runs)

Outside view calibration:

The key challenge is extrapolating from a single observation (2023's 76 runs) while acknowledging:
1. High historical variance in per-game scoring (4.0 to 11.0)
2. Unknown factors: team matchups, weather, pitcher availability, game competitiveness
3. Baseball's inherent randomness

**Anchoring Strategy:**
- Central tendency: 60-75 runs (based on 2023 result adjusted slightly downward toward historical mean)
- Lower bound consideration: If scoring resembles 2013/2017 rates, could see 28-42 runs
- Upper bound consideration: If scoring exceeds 2023 or features more blowouts, could see 85-100+ runs

**Distribution Shape:**
- Slightly right-skewed (more potential for high-scoring outliers than extremely low)
- The question bounds (29.5 to 120.5) seem reasonable but I should allow for outcomes beyond them
- 10th percentile should capture pessimistic but plausible scenarios (low-scoring tournament)
- 90th percentile should capture optimistic but plausible scenarios (very high-scoring tournament)

**Confidence Intervals:**
Given only one comparable tournament and high historical variance:
- 80% confidence interval (P10 to P90): Should span roughly 40-50 runs to capture uncertainty
- Median (P50): Around 65-70 runs (slightly below 2023's 76)
- Mode: Likely around 70-75 runs (close to 2023 result)
