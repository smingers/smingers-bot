## (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

**World Baseball Network (Apr 10, 2025) – schedule/matchups**  
- **Quality:** Medium (niche outlet, but reports straightforward logistics).  
- **Facts used:** Knockout stage starts Mar 13; confirms structural expectation of a 7-game knockout.  
- **Opinion:** None relevant.

**Just Baseball (Feb 2, 2026) – tournament logistics + some player commitments**  
- **Quality:** Medium (credible baseball site; still largely preview material).  
- **Facts used:** Knockout dates; quarterfinal sites (Houston/Miami), semis/final in Miami; roster timing.  
- **Opinion:** “contender” talk is not directly scoring-relevant.

**MLB.com pools finalized (date not shown; official)**  
- **Quality:** High (primary source).  
- **Facts used:** Confirms format; provides **2023 knockout game scores** (useful anchor for run environment in the same 7-game structure).  
- **Opinion:** None; mostly descriptive.

**The Athletic (Feb 2, 2026) – Puerto Rico insurance/availability**  
- **Quality:** High (Ken Rosenthal/Levi Weaver; well-sourced reporting).  
- **Facts used:** Puerto Rico may lose 8–10 players due to insurance denials (incl. Lindor/Correa issues), creating real roster-quality uncertainty.  
- **Opinion:** Some framing, but the key is factual reporting of insurance constraints.

**ESPN bold predictions (approx early Jan 2026) – DR wins**  
- **Quality:** Medium (identifiable analyst, but explicitly “bold picks”).  
- **Facts used:** Essentially none for totals; mostly speculative roster talk.  
- **Opinion:** Winner pick; not directly useful for total runs.

**AskNews items (Feb 4, 2026 unless noted) – roster/strategy notes**  
- **Japan roster finalized / Yoshida added (multiple Japanese/Korean outlets):**  
  - **Quality:** Medium-High for “roster finalized/permission granted” (these are routine, verifiable announcements).  
  - **Facts used:** Japan has strong lineup; **Ohtani will not pitch** (pitching-depth implication).  
- **South Korea articles (Chinese-language):**  
  - **Quality:** Medium; plausible reporting on tactics/availability.  
  - **Facts used:** Korea missing some MLB players; bullpen depth concerns under pitch limits (could increase runs in some games).  
- **USA Today (Dec 31, 2025) – Team USA commitments:**  
  - **Quality:** Medium-High mainstream reporting; lists many committed stars.  
  - **Facts used:** Strong USA pitching commitments (Skubal/Skenes) plus elite power bats (Judge/Schwarber/Raleigh) — relevant to run environment.  
- **Riley Greene declines Puerto Rico (Yahoo, Feb 4):**  
  - **Quality:** Medium-High; specific, checkable decision.  
  - **Facts used:** Another data point suggesting Puerto Rico talent depth may be thinner.

## (b) Evidence analysis with weights (what matters for total runs)

### Strong evidence (big levers)
1. **Format is 7 knockout games** (structural; hard to change).  
2. **Direct comparable: 2023 knockout total = 76 runs** (same 7-game knockout structure).  
3. **Pitch-count/usage constraints and short-rest dynamics in WBC** (structural; tends to expose middle relievers and depth, raising variance and blowout risk).

### Moderate evidence (meaningful but smaller)
4. **Venue shift vs 2023:** 2026 QFs in **Houston + Miami** (no Tokyo Dome QFs). Park/context can move totals a bit; Miami is generally less homer-friendly than Tokyo Dome, while Houston can play lively. Net effect: slight downward pull vs 2023 is plausible.  
5. **Roster quality signals:**  
   - USA appears to bring unusually strong pitching (Skubal/Skenes) → can suppress runs in some games.  
   - DR/Japan bring elite bats; Japan losing Ohtani-as-pitcher marginally weakens run prevention → can add runs.

### Weak evidence (small nudges / uncertainty)
6. **Puerto Rico insurance issue** may or may not matter to knockout totals because PR might not reach knockout; if they do, mismatch risk could increase runs.  
7. **Team strategy talk (e.g., Korea targeting matchups)** mostly affects pool play; indirect link to who reaches knockouts.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** Feb 4, 2026. **Resolution:** by Mar 19, 2026.  
- **Time left:** ~6 weeks; knockout stage itself is mid-March.

**If timeframe were halved (~3 weeks left):** we’d know finalized rosters, likely rotations/roles, late injuries → I’d **narrow** the interval somewhat and potentially shift based on confirmed ace participation.  
**If timeframe were doubled (~12 weeks left):** more uncertainty about participation/health/insurance → I’d **widen** tails (especially upper tail due to depth failures).

## (d) Justification (update from outside view)

### Outside-view anchor (base rate)
- Best single analog: **2023 knockout stage = 76 total runs** across 7 games (10.9 per game).

### Fermi decomposition (simple model)
- 7 games × (expected runs/game).  
- A reasonable central expectation is **~10 runs/game** in WBC knockout play given: strong offenses, limited pitcher workload, and relief-depth stress.  
- That implies **~70 runs**, with big variance depending on whether we get a 14–2 type blowout (as in 2023) and/or extra-inning runner-on-2nd games.

### Inside-view adjustments vs 2023
- **Slight downward pull:** 2026 QFs in Houston/Miami (vs 2023 having Tokyo QFs); Miami tends to suppress HR somewhat → fewer “cheap” runs than Tokyo, all else equal.  
- **Offsetting upward pull:** Japan without Ohtani pitching; some teams’ depth/insurance constraints; bullpen stress under pitch limits can create crooked innings.  
- **USA’s improved ace participation** plausibly reduces runs in *some* games, but it can also create asymmetric results (USA scoring a lot while allowing few) — total-runs effect is ambiguous.

**Net:** I move the center **a bit below/around 2023**, but keep a **fat upper tail** because one or two blowouts can add 15–30 runs quickly.

## Quick checklist (quality control)
1. **Target variable:** total **runs** in **all 2026 WBC knockout games**.  
2. **Outside view base rate:** 2023 knockout total **76** (same 7-game structure).  
3. **Consistency:** implied median ≈ **72**; implied mean ≈ mid/high-70s. This matches “near 2023 with wide variance.”  
4. **Most important evidence (≤20 words each):**  
   - 2023 knockout total: **76 runs in 7 games**.  
   - 2026 knockout still **7 games**, same structural exposure to bullpen depth.  
   - **Venues**: QFs Houston/Miami (no Tokyo) → mild park-factor shift.  
   - **Rosters**: USA ace pitching; Japan bats strong but Ohtani not pitching.  
5. **Blind spot:** If multiple ace-driven, low-scoring nail-biters occur (2–1, 3–2 repeatedly), totals could land much lower.
