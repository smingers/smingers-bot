SOURCE ANALYSIS (key items only – all dates before 2026-02-04 are past facts)

1. MLB.com game pages / box scores (2006-2023).  
   • Factual, official scoring data – highest-quality source.  
   • Provide final scores for every historical WBC knockout game.

2. Agent-compiled table of knockout totals 2006-2023 (26, 33, 12, 18, 76).  
   • Derived from MLB box scores; cross-checked spot-checks against MLB.com (e.g., 2023 USA-Cuba 14-2, Japan-USA 3-2).  
   • Accept as accurate but treat with slight caution (secondary aggregation).

3. 2025-26 news/preview pieces (MLB.com, JustBaseball, ESPN, The Athletic, etc.).  
   • High-quality on schedule, format, ballparks, marquee roster commitments/defections.  
   • Contain opinions on who will win, but almost no quantitative run-scoring projections.  
   • Factual elements (ballpark list, dates, Shohei Ohtani will not pitch, Puerto Rico insurance issues) are rated strong to moderate evidence; roster speculation is weak evidence.

EVIDENCE WEIGHTING

Strong evidence  
• Knockout stage will again be 7 games (4 QF, 2 SF, 1 Final) – confirmed by multiple independent sources.  
• Historical per-game scoring in WBC knockouts = 4 – 11 runs (MLB data 2006-2023).

Moderate evidence  
• 2023 tournament (same 7-game format) produced 10.9 runs/game (76 total).  
• 2026 pitching talent: some elite starters absent (Ohtani pitching, maybe Puerto Rican MLB arms), but USA & DR bringing deep staffs (Skubal, Skenes, Peralta, Alcantara). Net effect probably slightly below 2023 slugfest level.  
• Ballparks: Houston’s Daikin Park and Miami’s loanDepot Park are both hitter-friendly relative to Tokyo Dome/Petco (per Statcast park factors). Seven knockout games = four in Miami, three in Houston. Favors runs modestly.

Weak evidence  
• Weather (all games are in retractable-roof or indoor parks).  
• Extra-inning tiebreak chaos – inherently unpredictable.  
• One-off anecdotes on individual player decisions (e.g., Riley Greene) barely move run totals.

TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS  
• 43 days until the championship ends.  
• If I were asked with half this lead time (≈3 weeks out) I would modestly narrow the distribution once full rosters, pool results, and bullpen usage are known (likely 10-15 % tighter).  
• If time were doubled, I would keep the same wide range because many drivers will remain uncertain until the actual bracket is set.

JUSTIFICATION & ADJUSTMENTS

Outside-view base rate (7-game structure):  
Mean ≈ 9.5 runs/game → 66–67 total.

Adjustments:  
+1.0 runs/game for hitter-friendly parks and WBC pitch-count limits.  
–0.3 runs/game for slightly stronger front-end pitching depth than 2023 (Skubal, Skenes, Sasaki, Yamamoto healthy, etc.).  
Net ≈ +0.7 → expected 10.2 runs/game → 71 total.

Add fat-tail right risk (one or two blowouts) and left-tail risk (two low-scoring duels). Resulting subjective distribution:

• 10th pct: 52 (≈7.4 r/g) – needs several tight games.  
• 20th pct: 59 (≈8.4 r/g).  
• 40th pct: 68 (≈9.7 r/g).  
• 60th pct: 76 (≈10.9 r/g).  
• 80th pct: 87 (≈12.4 r/g).  
• 90th pct: 97 (≈13.9 r/g, implies at least one 15-plus-run blowout).

FORECASTING CHECKLIST (abridged)

1. Target variable: total runs scored in the 2026 WBC knockout stage (7 games, Mar 13-17), per MLB.com.  
2. Base rate: historical 7-game expectation ≈ 66 runs.  
3. Consistency: median 72; mean ~74; matches justification.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) 2023 knockout produced 76 runs (strong).  
   b) Same 7-game format confirmed (strong).  
   c) Roofed, hitter-leaning parks (moderate).  
   d) Star pitchers Ohtani out, but USA/DR staffs deep (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: Multiple mercy-rule blowouts in quarterfinals could drive totals >110; would push forecast too low.
