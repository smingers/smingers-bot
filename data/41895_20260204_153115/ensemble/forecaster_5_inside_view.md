SOURCE ANALYSIS  (concise notes; all dates ≤ 4 Feb 2026, so all are historical)

1. MLB.com pools-finalized piece (Jan 2026).  Factual tournament structure; reliable, no scoring data.  
2. JustBaseball preview (2 Feb 2026).  Factual dates/venues/rosters-due; moderate quality; no run-totals.  
3. WorldBaseballNetwork (Apr 2025).  Early schedule/venues; consistent with later sources.  
4. The Athletic (2 Feb 2026).  Reports Puerto-Rico insurance withdrawals; credible but roster outcome still uncertain (opinion on “might”).  
5. ESPN “Bold 2026 predictions” (Dec 2025).  Pure pundit opinion that DR will win; weak for run projection.  
6. Asknews batch (Feb 2026).  Mostly roster announcements (Japan, Korea, DR, USA) from mainstream sports outlets in several languages.  Good for confirming star-power, not for run estimates.  
7. “Agent table” (internal) that lists every knockout-round score 2006-2023 copied from MLB.com box scores.  High-quality, directly relevant quantitative history.

EVIDENCE WEIGHING

Strong  
• Historical knockout games 2006-2023: 165 runs in 19 games = 8.7 runs/game (directly on-point, multiple MLB.com boxes).  
• 2026 format identical to 2023 (quarter-finals added → 7 games), a structural factor baked in.

Moderate  
• Star-laden 2026 rosters (USA, DR, Japan) + WBC pitch-count limits → modestly higher scoring potential.  
• Quarter-final mismatches (pool winners vs runners-up) logically raise blow-out risk, evidenced by 2023 (44 runs in four QF games).  
• Parks: five of seven games in Miami (pitcher-friendly), two in Houston (neutral).  Slight downward pull.

Weak  
• Puerto-Rico insurance issue (could lower one line-up) – single team, effect small on 7-game total.  
• Media predictions of “memorable home runs” – anecdotal hype.

TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS  
Now to final: 42 days.  Rosters lock 5 Feb 2026, so only injuries can move expectation.  Halving timeframe (three weeks out) would not change outside view much; doubling (three months) would add larger injury and rule-change uncertainty → ±2 runs on the mean, ±5 runs on SD.

JUSTIFICATION / INSIDE-VIEW UPDATE

Base rate: 8.7 runs/game × 7 games = 61 runs.  
Adjustments:

+4 runs  Star-heavy 2026 offences vs historically weaker 2013–17 line-ups.  
+5 runs  Quarter-final blow-out likelihood (based on 2023 empirical 11.0 runs/game vs 6.0 in 2017, 4.0 in 2013).  
-0.5 run  Miami park factor (~0.90 run multiplier).  
Net inside-view mean ≈ 70 runs.

Variance: Historical per-game SD ≈ 5.0.  Over seven games: √7×5 ≈ 13.2.  Add 10 % structural uncertainty → SD rounded to 15 runs.

Assuming an approximately normal shape (reasonable for sum of seven moderately correlated totals):

Percentile 10  = 70 − 1.28 × 15 ≈ 51  
Percentile 20  = 70 − 0.84 × 15 ≈ 57  
Percentile 40  = 70 − 0.25 × 15 ≈ 66  
Percentile 60  = 70 + 0.25 × 15 ≈ 74  
Percentile 80  = 70 + 0.84 × 15 ≈ 83  
Percentile 90  = 70 + 1.28 × 15 ≈ 89

Rounded to whole runs, monotonic.

FORECASTING CHECKLIST (abridged)

1. Target: “Total runs in all 7 knockout games (QF, SF, Final) WBC 2026, 13–17 Mar 2026”.  
2. Outside-view base = 61 runs; final mean 70 rooted in base, adjusted by roster/format factors.  
3. Consistency: median (≈70) close to mean 70, matches justification.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical 165 runs/19 games record.  
   b) 2026 keeps 7-game structure like 2023.  
   c) 2026 rosters stacked with MVP-level hitters.  
   d) Quarter-final mismatches historically produced high run totals.  
   e) Miami park factor slightly suppresses scoring.  
5. Blind spot: Multiple extra-inning pitcher’s-duel games (or rain-shortened mercy rules) could push total into low 40s.
