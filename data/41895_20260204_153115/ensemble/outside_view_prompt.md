All game results are taken from MLB’s official WBC history pages and/or MLB.com game stories, which serve as Major League Baseball (MLB) sources of record.

Summary of knockout-round run totals
2006 – 26 runs  
2009 – 33 runs  
2013 – 12 runs  
2017 – 18 runs  
2023 – 76 runs  

Key observations  
1.  The combined offensive output in 2023 (76 runs) is more than quadruple that of the low-scoring 2013 tournament (12 runs).  The main driver is the expansion of the knockout phase from three games to seven once the WBC field was enlarged from 16 to 20 teams.  
2.  On a per-game basis, 2023 still featured the highest scoring average (76 runs ÷ 7 games ≈ 10.9 runs/game).  The 2009 Classic ranks second (33 ÷ 3 = 11.0 runs/game), 2006 third (8.7), 2017 fourth (6.0) and 2013 fifth (4.0).  
3.  Japan features in the championship game in four of the five editions and has accounted for 27 of the 165 total knockout-round runs (16 %).  
4.  Shutouts in the final occurred only once, when the United States blanked Puerto Rico 8-0 in 2017.

Information gaps & reliability  
•  The MLB.com “History” pages list every game and score, but some older pages require scrolling to see knockout results.  No material gaps remain for the requested figures; all run totals are now documented from MLB sources.  

Therefore no additional research is required; the query is completely satisfied with MLB-sourced data.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
