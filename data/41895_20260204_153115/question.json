The knockout stage consists of single-elimination games following the group stage and includes the Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and the Championship Final.\n\nKnockout-stage games are played under standard WBC rules, including extra innings if necessary, and runs are scored in the same manner as in professional baseball.\n\nPrevious WBC tournaments have generally featured higher run scoring than Major League Baseball games, though scoring in individual knockout-stage games can vary widely depending on matchups and game conditions.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41684,\"question_id\":41423}}`",
