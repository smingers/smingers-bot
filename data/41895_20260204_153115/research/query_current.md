Analysis:
To judge how many total runs will be scored in the 2026 WBC knockout stage I first need up-to-date information on:
• Where the quarter-, semi- and final games will be played (ballpark dimensions, altitude, weather).
• Any 2026 rule tweaks (e.g., pitch clock, shift limits, extra-inning tiebreakers) that could change run environments.
• Strength of the likely quarter-finalists: recent offensive and pitching performance of leading national teams; MLB/NPB/KBO stars who have committed (or withdrawn) and injury news.
• Historical totals: runs scored in 2013, 2017 and 2023 WBC knockout rounds to anchor priors.
Current news on rosters, venues and rule changes will give the best inside view, so the searches below focus on those angles.
