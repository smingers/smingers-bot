The forecasting question is:
How many runs will be scored in the knockout stage of the 2026 World Baseball Classic?

Question background:
The [World Baseball Classic](https://www.mlb.com/world-baseball-classic) (WBC) is an international baseball tournament featuring players from leagues such as [Major League Baseball](https://www.mlb.com/), [Nippon Professional Baseball](https://npb.jp/eng/), and [the KBO League](http://eng.koreabaseball.com/). The knockout stage consists of single-elimination games following the group stage and includes the Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and the Championship Final.

Knockout-stage games are played under standard WBC rules, including extra innings if necessary, and runs are scored in the same manner as in professional baseball.

Previous WBC tournaments have generally featured higher run scoring than Major League Baseball games, though scoring in individual knockout-stage games can vary widely depending on matchups and game conditions.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.
