Analysis:
To estimate 2026 knockout-stage scoring it helps to build an outside-view baseline using prior World Baseball Classics.  Knockout structure has usually meant 3 games (semifinals + final) in 2006-2017 and 7 games (4 quarterfinals, 2 semifinals, 1 final) in 2023—the same format announced for 2026.  Summing official MLB box scores yields:  
• 2006: 26 runs in 3 games (8.7 r/g)  
• 2009: 33 runs in 3 games (11.0 r/g)  
• 2013: 12 runs in 3 games (4.0 r/g)  
• 2017: 18 runs in 3 games (6.0 r/g)  
• 2023: 76 runs in 7 games (10.9 r/g)  

Across all 19 historical knockout games: 165 runs, or 8.7 runs per game.  If the 2026 bracket again contains 7 games, a naïve historical mean would project about 61 runs.  Variation is high (range 12-76 total; SD ≈ 20), so any forecast must incorporate team quality, park effects, and the tendency for WBC offenses to outperform MLB averages.  Nevertheless, the historical record anchors a middle estimate near 55-70 runs, with long tails below 30 (if every game is low-scoring) or above 100 (if 2023-style slugfests recur and several extras occur).
