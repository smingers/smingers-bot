Kang Jung-ho Predicts Won Dae-in to Start Against Taiwan**\nIn the 2026 Classic Series C Group preliminary round, held at Tokyo Dome, Taiwan is grouped with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Czech Republic, with the top two teams advancing to the U.S. 8-team knockout stage. South Korea's former power hitter, 38-year-old Kang Jung-ho, analyzed the group stage on his personal YouTube channel, predicting that Samsung Lions' ace pitcher Won Dae-in should start against Taiwan. He noted that despite the absence of key MLB players\u2014such as Kim Hae-sung (Atlanta Braves), Song Sung-won (San Diego Padres), and Tommy Edman (Dodgers), who are injured or declined due to surgery\u2014South Korea's national team, led by hitters like Hong Chang-gi, Kim Hyeon-seong, and Lee Jeong-ho, remains competitive. Won Dae-in, a consistent South Korean starter with 5 consecutive seasons of at least 26 starts and 150+ innings, posted a 12-4 record and 3.24 ERA in 27 starts with 166.2 innings in 2025. Kang predicted that South Korea should deploy Won Dae-in against Taiwan, Ryu Hyun-jin against the Czech Republic, Guo Bin or Go Young-pyo against Australia, and Moon Dong-joo against Japan, with Go Woo-sik as the closer. He emphasized that while South Korea has a chance against Japan and Taiwan, bullpen depth remains a concern\u2014especially under the 65-pitch limit\u2014making the second starter crucial. He advised minimizing errors and walks against Japan, focusing on winning against Taiwan, holding leads in later innings against Australia, and avoiding surprises against the Czech Republic. Kang believes South Korea\u2019s realistic goal is a 3-1 record in the preliminary round to advance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:55 AM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831](https://sports.ltn.com.tw/news/breakingnews/5332876)\n\n**WBC 2026: South Korea's 'Grab Taiwan' Strategy in Critical Matchup**\nThe sixth World Baseball Classic (WBC) Group C preliminary round begins on March 5, 2026, with Japan widely regarded as the strongest team in the group. The decisive match for advancement to the knockout stage in Miami, the 'Taiwan vs. Korea' game, is scheduled for March 8 at noon at Tokyo Dome. Facing a strong Chinese Taipei team, South Korea is reportedly adopting a 'avoid Japan, target Taiwan' strategy, planning to reserve its top pitchers and elite offensive firepower for the Taiwan matchup. This approach stems from extreme scheduling pressure: South Korea must play Japan on the evening of March 7, followed by a midday game against Chinese Taipei the next day\u2014a 'hell-level' back-to-back schedule typically considered a scheduling disadvantage. However, South Korea aims to bypass Japan's strength and deploy its best players specifically for the critical game against Chinese Taipei. The article notes this as a strategic 'grab Taiwan' playbook, highlighting the high stakes and tactical planning involved.

Under head coach Hirotaka Iwata, Japan aims to defend its back-to-back WBC titles. Yoshida, who played in 303 MLB games across three seasons with a .282 batting average, 29 home runs, 154 RBIs, 132 runs scored, and an OPS of .762, had a disappointing 2025 season with a .266 average, 4 home runs, 26 RBIs, and an OPS of .696. However, he previously excelled in the 2023 WBC, hitting .409 with 9 hits, 2 home runs, and 13 RBIs in 7 games, helping Japan win the title. With Yoshida\u2019s inclusion, Japan now has nine MLB players on its roster, including stars Shohei Ohtani (Dodgers), Yoshinobu Yamamoto (Dodgers), Yuuki Matsui (San Diego Padres), Yusei Kikuchi (LA Angels), Kazuma Okamoto (Toronto Blue Jays), Munetaka Murakami (Chicago White Sox), Seiya Suzuki (Chicago Cubs), and Tomoyuki Sugano (free agent). Ohtani will focus solely on hitting in 2026, after previously pitching and hitting in 2023. Former star Yu Darvish, who underwent elbow surgery in November 2025 and will miss the tournament, will serve as a temporary coach. Japan is grouped with South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and the Czech Republic in Group C of the first round. The highly anticipated matchup between Japan and South Korea will take place on March 7, 2026, at Tokyo Dome. South Korea\u2019s national team, led by manager Jihyun Ryu, will announce its final roster on February 6, 2026.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:29 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260204_0003503036)\n\n**Final Piece of Samurai Japan\u2019s Roster Revealed: Sh\u014dsuke Yoshida Joins for WBC Defense**\nThe final member of Japan's national baseball team, Samurai Japan, for the 2026 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was announced as Sh\u014dsuke Yoshida, an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, on February 4, 2026, at approximately 3:00 PM Japan time. This announcement, made during a weekday afternoon, caused excitement among Japanese fans, who reacted with enthusiasm on X (formerly Twitter), posting comments such as 'Sh\u014dsuke Yoshida, so happy!', 'It\u2019s Yoshida after all!', 'Yoshida is here! I can\u2019t wait to hear that chant again\u2014tears are coming!', and 'He\u2019s finally here! Please, do your best!'. Yoshida, who previously played a pivotal role in the 2023 WBC by hitting a crucial three-run home run in the 7th inning of the semifinal against Mexico while down by three runs, recorded a total of 13 RBIs in the tournament. He expressed his determination, stating, 'I will fight with full resolve to share the greatest moments with all of you once again.'

According to the Detroit Free Press, Greene, who previously played for Team USA at the 2018 Pan-American Championships, chose to hold out for a U.S. invitation that never materialized. As a result, he will remain focused on full spring training and the start of the 2026 MLB season. At 25 years old, Greene has already established himself as a cornerstone player after a strong 2025 season featuring 36 home runs, 111 RBIs, and an OPS+ of 120. The World Baseball Classic is scheduled from March 5 to March 17, 2026. His decision reflects a strategic pause in international play, not a lack of interest, but a commitment to the country he hopes to represent.

Cotillo stated that while the team believes Yoshida will join the WBC, circumstances could change, but emphasized there are no insurance-related issues or injuries preventing his participation\u2014despite a prior injury in 2025. Yoshida previously excelled at the 2023 WBC, playing in all seven games, hitting .409 with 2 home runs and a record-breaking 13 RBIs. He delivered a crucial two-out, two-run home run in the 7th inning of the semifinal against Mexico to tie the game, and later drew a walk in the 9th inning with the bases loaded, setting up a walk-off two-run double by teammate Yukiya Matsui. In the 2024 season, Yoshida played in 55 games due to a right shoulder surgery he underwent in October 2024, recording a .266 batting average, 4 home runs, and 26 RBIs.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:20 AM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20260204/spp/sp0/102/124000c)\n\n**Japan Time Early Morning 'Too Hot!' Yoshida Masataka's WBC Participation Approved by Red Sox, Final Spot Nearly Confirmed**\nRed Sox outfielder Masataka Yoshida has received team approval to participate in the 2026 World Baseball Classic (WBC), according to local media 'MassLive' reporting on February 4, 2026 (Japan time). This development has generated significant excitement among fans, as Yoshida is now considered 'nearly certain' to secure the final spot on Samurai Japan's roster. Yoshida underwent right shoulder surgery in October 2024, which caused him to miss most of the previous season; he made his MLB return in July, playing only 55 games with just six appearances in the outfield. Despite concerns over his physical condition, the Red Sox's approval is a major boost for Samurai Japan. Yoshida previously delivered an outstanding performance in the 2023 WBC, posting a .409 batting average, 2 home runs, and 13 RBIs, including a game-tying three-run homer in the semifinal against Mexico that became a symbolic moment in Japan's path to victory. Meanwhile, Shohei Ohtani of the Dodgers has confirmed he will not pitch in the 2026 WBC, raising the possibility that the final spot could go to a pitcher. Social media reactions, including 'Yoshida\u2019s coming!?', 'This is so hot!', and 'The final spot is almost certain to be Yoshida,' reflect widespread anticipation for his return to the national team.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:46 PM\nSource:[Full-Count\uff08\u30d5\u30eb\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\uff09 \u2015 \u91ce\u7403\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u901f\u5831\u30fb\u30b3\u30e9\u30e0 \u2015](https://full-count.jp/2026/02/04/post1900239/)\n\n**Japan's 30-Man Roster for the World Baseball Classic Confirmed: Giyama Shohei on Fighting with Resolve**\nJapan has officially confirmed its 30-player roster for the upcoming World Baseball Classic, set to begin in March 2026.

Giyama, who had a subpar regular season with 55 games played, 4 home runs, 26 RBIs, and a .266 batting average, showed strong performance in the postseason against the Yankees. He previously excelled in the last World Baseball Classic, posting a .409 batting average, 2 home runs, and 13 RBIs, including a crucial three-run homer in the semifinal against Mexico that helped Japan stage a comeback.

As a result, the final roster spot, which may go to a position player, is still under consideration, and Yoshida\u2019s inclusion depends on the official team announcement.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:29 PM\nSource:[tw.sports.yahoo.com](https://tw.sports.yahoo.com/news/wbc-%E5%90%89%E7%94%B0%E6%AD%A3%E5%B0%9A%E7%8D%B2%E7%B4%85%E8%A5%AA%E6%94%BE%E8%A1%8C-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E9%9A%8A%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C-%E5%80%8B%E5%90%8D%E9%A1%8D%E4%B8%8D-%E5%AE%9A%E7%B5%A6%E4%BB%96-232937613.html)\n\n**Juan Soto joins $2.2B Dominican Republic roster aiming for World Baseball Classic glory | MLB News - The Times of India**\nJuan Soto, a 28-year-old New York Mets player, has officially committed to represent the Dominican Republic in the 2026 World Baseball Classic (WBC), marking a major boost for the team's roster. Soto, who holds a record-breaking 15-year, $765 million contract with the Mets, is one of the most prolific hitters of his generation, with a career batting average of .282, 244 home runs, 697 RBIs, 775 runs scored, 95 stolen bases, and a .948 OPS over 1,096 games. He previously stood out in the 2023 WBC, posting a 1.500 OPS in 15 at-bats with six hits and two home runs. The Dominican Republic's 2026 squad, which includes elite MLB players such as Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Julio Rodr\u00edguez, Fernando Tatis Jr., Ketel Marte, Gerardo Perdomo, and Junior Caminero, is estimated to be worth approximately $2.23 billion. The team, which won the WBC title in 2013 and reached the semifinals in 2006, has been eliminated in the early stages in 2017 and 2023. The 2026 tournament is seen as a redemption opportunity, with Soto leading a historically talented and expensive lineup. According to The Times of India, the Dominican Republic is not just a competitor in the 2026 WBC but is viewed as a legitimate chance to reclaim the title.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:09 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/juan-soto-joins-2-2b-dominican-republic-roster-aiming-for-world-baseball-classic-glory/articleshow/127867174.cms)\n\n**2026 Classic Baseball World Cup: Schedule, Groups, and Latin American Teams**\nThe 2026 Classic Baseball World Cup, the sixth edition of the tournament, will begin on March 5, 2026, with the group stage held across four host cities: Tokyo, Japan (Group C); San Juan, Puerto Rico (Group A); Houston, Texas (Group B); and Miami, Florida (Group D).

However, at 38 years old and with a history of injuries, Kershaw acknowledges he will not play a major role. When asked about a potential matchup against former Los Angeles Dodgers teammate Shohei Ohtani, the two-way Japanese superstar in his prime, Kershaw humorously stated, 'I think something will have gone terribly wrong if I have to pitch against Team Japan in the finals or something. I think we've got plenty of guys to get that guy out. Not me.' Ohtani, who has won four of the last five MVP awards (two in each league), led the Dodgers to back-to-back World Series titles, and led MLB in home runs in 2023 and 2024, is widely regarded as the best player in baseball.

The team's standout player, Yu-Cheng Chang, who overcame military service controversies, delivered key performances in the 2023 WBC, hitting two memorable home runs against Italy and the Netherlands, earning him national hero status and a popular 'salute' gesture in Taiwan. Despite playing only four preliminary games, Chang posted a .438 batting average, 2 doubles, 2 home runs, 8 RBIs, and 5 runs scored, with an OPS of 1.438, earning him A-group MVP and best first baseman honors. The media highlighted the passionate home crowd support as a key factor.

In a lighthearted moment during the Winter Meetings, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, a 435-home run MLB legend and future manager of Puerto Rico\u2019s WBC team, was asked how to handle Ohtani.

He praised Japan\u2019s sustained strength, citing the success of Japanese players in MLB as evidence of their deep talent pool.
