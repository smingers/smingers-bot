The combined offensive output in 2023 (76 runs) is more than quadruple that of the low-scoring 2013 tournament (12 runs).  The main driver is the expansion of the knockout phase from three games to seven once the WBC field was enlarged from 16 to 20 teams.  \n2.  On a per-game basis, 2023 still featured the highest scoring average (76 runs \u00f7 7 games \u2248 10.9 runs/game).  The 2009 Classic ranks second (33 \u00f7 3 = 11.0 runs/game), 2006 third (8.7), 2017 fourth (6.0) and 2013 fifth (4.0).  \n3.  Japan features in the championship game in four of the five editions and has accounted for 27 of the 165 total knockout-round runs (16 %).  \n4.  Shutouts in the final occurred only once, when the United States blanked Puerto Rico 8-0 in 2017.\n\nInformation gaps & reliability  \n\u2022  The MLB.com \u201cHistory\u201d pages list every game and score, but some older pages require scrolling to see knockout results.  No material gaps remain for the requested figures; all run totals are now documented from MLB sources.  \n\nTherefore no additional research is required; the query is completely satisfied with MLB-sourced data.</Agent_report>\n"
