## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Egypt's post-2016 currency reform period (2017-2019)**
   - Peak inflation 2017: ~23-33% → declined to ~14% by 2019
   - Suitability: Moderate - similar reform-driven spike but different global context

2. **Egypt's recent inflation cycle (2022-2026)**
   - 2022: 13.9% → 2023: 33.88% (crisis spike) → 2025: declining to ~13-14%
   - Suitability: HIGH - most relevant recent cycle with similar monetary policy framework

3. **Emerging market disinflation episodes with central bank targeting**
   - Various EM countries achieving 5-10% inflation targets after spikes
   - Suitability: Moderate - provides general patterns but lacks Egypt-specific factors

**Selected Reference Class**: Egypt's 2022-2026 inflation cycle - most relevant given:
- Same monetary policy framework
- Recent actual data points
- CBE's explicit forward guidance
- Similar structural economic conditions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: March 2026 is approximately 14 months from today (January 30, 2026). Wait - today IS January 30, 2026, so March 2026 is only ~2 months away.

**Recent Monthly Pattern (2025)**:
- June 2025: 14.9%
- July 2025: 13.9% (down 1.0 pp)
- October 2025: Increased (specific number not provided)
- December 2025: 12.3% (from agent report)

**Observed Trend**:
- Peak in 2023 at 33.88%
- Declining through 2024-2025
- December 2025 at 12.3% represents continued disinflation
- Some volatility (October uptick) but overall downward trajectory

**CBE's Explicit Guidance**:
- Expected temporary rise in late Q4 2025 due to energy prices
- Medium-term decline expected in H2 2026
- Target: 7% (±2%) by Q4 2026, meaning 5-9% range

**Historical Volatility**:
Monthly YoY changes in Egypt typically show:
- 0.5-2.0 pp month-to-month variation during stable periods
- Larger swings during shock periods (currency devaluation, subsidy reforms)

## (d) Justification

**Baseline from December 2025**: 12.3%

**Factors for March 2026 (2 months ahead)**:

**Downward Pressures**:
1. CBE's explicit guidance of continued disinflation in H2 2026
2. Established downward trend from 33.88% (2023) to 12.3% (Dec 2025)
3. Base effects: comparing against elevated March 2025 readings
4. Monetary policy: rates held steady at restrictive levels (22-23%)
5. Expected resumption of disinflation in Q1 2026 per Capital Economics

**Upward Pressures**:
1. CBE warned of temporary rise in late Q4 2025 due to energy price increases
2. October 2025 showed increase (services inflation sticky)
3. Regional geopolitical tensions (ongoing risk)
4. Only 2 months for adjustment - limited time for major changes

**Most Likely Scenario**:
- March 2026 represents Q1 2026, when disinflation expected to resume
- Energy price effects from Q4 2025 may still be partially reflected
- Trajectory toward 7% target by Q4 2026 suggests ~1-1.5 pp decline per quarter
- From 12.3% in December 2025, a 2-month progression suggests range of 10.5-12.5%

**Risk Assessment**:
- Downside risk: faster disinflation if base effects strong
- Upside risk: policy shocks, geopolitical escalation, supply disruptions
- Historical upset rate: Egypt has experienced sudden spikes (2016, 2022-23) but current trajectory is stable

Outside view calibration:

Given December 2025 baseline of 12.3% and 2-month horizon to March 2026:

**Central tendency**: 10.5-12.0% range
- CBE guidance suggests disinflationary path
- Q1 2026 expected to show resumed decline
- Energy price effects from Q4 2025 partially dissipating

**Distribution considerations**:
1. **Narrow timeframe** (2 months) limits extreme movements
2. **Recent volatility**: October 2025 uptick shows month-to-month variability of 0.5-1.5 pp
3. **Policy anchor**: CBE's 7% target by Q4 2026 implies ~5 pp decline over 9 months from December
4. **Historical patterns**: Egypt's monthly YoY changes typically 0.3-1.0 pp during stable disinflation
5. **Tail risks**: 
   - Lower tail: accelerated disinflation (unlikely given only 2 months)
   - Upper tail: policy shock, geopolitical crisis (low probability but possible)

**Percentile reasoning**:
- 10th percentile: Optimistic scenario with strong disinflation - around 9.5%
- 20th percentile: Faster-than-expected decline - around 10.2%
- 40th percentile: Modest continued decline - around 11.0%
- 60th percentile: Slower decline or stability - around 11.8%
- 80th percentile: Minimal progress or slight increase - around 12.8%
- 90th percentile: Adverse shock scenario - around 14.0%

**Calibration checks**:
- Median (50th): ~11.4% represents 0.9 pp decline from December, consistent with CBE path
- 90/10 range: 9.5-14.0% (4.5 pp spread) accounts for unknown unknowns
- Mode around 11-12% aligns with continuation of established trend

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 9.5
Percentile 20: 10.2
Percentile 40: 11.0
Percentile 60: 11.8
Percentile 80: 12.8
Percentile 90: 14.0
