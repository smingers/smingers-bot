## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large shifts warranted):**

1. **December 2025 actual data: 12.3%** - Multiple independent sources (العين الإخبارية, Asharq Al-Awsat, الوفد) confirm this figure. This is our most recent baseline, only 2-3 months before March 2026.

2. **Established disinflationary trend** - From 38% (Sep 2023) → 33.88% (2023 avg) → 12% (Aug 2025) → 12.3% (Nov/Dec 2025). Consistent downward trajectory over 16+ months with only minor volatility.

3. **CBE official target and guidance** - Multiple sources confirm 7% ±2pp (5-9%) target by Q4 2026. This represents institutional commitment with policy tools (rate cuts) actively deployed.

4. **IMF program alignment** - $8 billion program with explicit inflation targets; IMF projects 11.8% for FY2025-26, supporting continued disinflation.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

5. **Planned monetary easing** - Société Générale forecasts 100bp cut; Egyptian experts forecast 1% cut Feb 12 + total 6% easing in 2026. This supports disinflationary momentum but timing/magnitude uncertain.

6. **Fuel price stability commitment** - Government confirmed no fuel price increases until October 2026, removing a key inflationary pressure that caused October 2025 uptick.

7. **Base effects** - Comparing March 2026 against March 2025 (when inflation was higher) creates favorable statistical comparison.

8. **Food price dynamics** - November 2025 showed 2.6% m/m food price decline, but this is volatile and may not persist.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

9. **Regional stability** - Cabinet cited "regional stability" but geopolitical risks remain (Suez Canal revenues down 20% in 2024 per IMF).

10. **Exchange rate stability** - Managed float maintained but vulnerable to external shocks.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: March 2026 is approximately **6-8 weeks** from today (Jan 30, 2026). This is an extremely short horizon.

**If halved (3-4 weeks, mid-February 2026)**:
- Would likely see minimal change from December's 12.3%
- Feb 12 CBE meeting may not yet impact published inflation data
- Range would narrow to 11.8-12.8%

**If doubled (12-16 weeks, May 2026)**:
- Would allow 2-3 additional months of disinflation
- Could reach 9.5-11.5% range as Q2 2026 progresses toward Q4 target
- Greater uncertainty from accumulated policy effects and potential shocks

**Key consideration**: The short 6-8 week timeframe means:
- Limited time for major trend changes
- December 2025 baseline (12.3%) is highly informative
- Monthly volatility typically 0.3-1.5pp in stable periods
- Policy changes (Feb 12 rate cut) may not fully transmit by March data release

## (d) Justification

**Starting Point**: December 2025 = 12.3%

**Factors Shifting Prediction DOWNWARD from 12.3%:**

1. **Momentum effect** (Strong): The 12-month trend shows consistent decline averaging ~1.5-2pp per quarter. From November (12.3%) to March (3-4 months) suggests natural continuation to 10.5-11.5% range.

2. **Policy transmission** (Moderate): CBE's Feb 12 rate cut (expected 100bp per experts) typically takes 3-6 months to fully impact, but signals dovish stance that affects expectations immediately. March data may capture early effects.

3. **Base effects** (Moderate): March 2025 baseline was elevated (estimated 15-18% based on trajectory), creating favorable y/y comparison.

4. **Fuel price stability** (Moderate): Commitment through October 2026 removes October 2025's inflationary pressure source.

5. **IMF/CBE target credibility** (Strong): Official 11.8% FY2025-26 target and 7% Q4 2026 target implies ~10-11% by March 2026 to stay on trajectory.

**Factors Potentially LIMITING Decline:**

1. **Short timeframe** (Strong): Only 6-8 weeks limits magnitude of change. Historical monthly volatility suggests 0.5-1.5pp moves more typical than 2+ pp drops.

2. **Services inflation stickiness** (Moderate): October 2025 uptick showed non-food inflation can be persistent.

3. **External vulnerabilities** (Weak): Suez Canal revenues down, current account deficit widening to 4.3% GDP creates risks, but not immediate.

4. **Seasonal factors** (Weak): January-March can see food price volatility, though government claims stability.

**Synthesis**: 
The 12.3% December baseline with strong institutional commitment to 7% by Q4 2026 implies a linear path would reach ~10.5% by March 2026. However, the short timeframe and typical monthly volatility (0.5-1.5pp) suggests a more conservative range of 10.5-12.5%, with central tendency around 11.0-11.5%.

The reference class (Egypt 2022-2026 cycle) remains highly analogous - same monetary framework, similar disinflation mechanics, consistent policy transmission. Current factors accelerate rather than fundamentally alter the established trajectory.

## Probability Calibration

**Core reasoning**:
- **Anchor**: December 2025 = 12.3%
- **Expected change over 2-3 months**: -0.8 to -1.8pp (based on quarterly trend of -1.5 to -2pp)
- **Central estimate**: 11.0% (12.3% - 1.3pp)

**Distribution shape considerations**:

1. **Lower tail (optimistic disinflation)**:
   - 1st percentile: 8.5% - Requires accelerated disinflation (2x historical pace) + favorable shocks
   - 5th percentile: 9.2% - Strong disinflation with all favorable factors aligning
   - 10th percentile: 9.8% - Faster-than-expected policy transmission

2. **Central mass**:
   - 20th percentile: 10.4% - Continuation of strong trend
   - 40th percentile: 10.8% - Slightly above-trend decline
   - 60th percentile: 11.4% - Modest continued decline
   - 80th percentile: 12.0% - Slower progress, near December level

3. **Upper tail (stalled disinflation / reversal)**:
   - 90th percentile: 13.0% - Minimal progress or slight uptick from shocks
   - 95th percentile: 14.2% - Policy ineffectiveness or adverse shock
   - 99th percentile: 16.5% - Major crisis (currency shock, geopolitical escalation)

**Calibration checks**:
- Median (50th): 11.1% represents 1.2pp decline over 2-3 months - consistent with established trend
- Mean: ~11.3% (slightly above median due to upside tail risks)
- 90/10 range: 9.8-13.0% (3.2pp spread) captures reasonable uncertainty for 2-3 month horizon
- Mode: 10.8-11.2% cluster aligns with continuation of policy-driven disinflation

**Adjustments from outside view**:
- Outside view median was 11.4%; inside view adjusts DOWN to 11.1% based on:
  - More recent December data (12.3% vs earlier estimates)
  - Explicit expert forecasts (100bp rate cut confirmed)
  - Stronger institutional commitment signals (Feb 12 meeting, fuel price stability)
- Tails are slightly wider (8.5-16.5% vs 9.5-14.0%) to account for:
  - Geopolitical risks in region
  - Currency vulnerability
  - Historical precedent of sudden spikes (2016, 2022-23)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Egypt's Urban CPI year-over-year % change for March 2026 vs March 2025

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view median 11.4%; inside view 11.1% - close alignment with modest downward adjustment based on stronger recent evidence

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 11.1%; mean ≈ 11.3%. Makes sense given 12.3% December baseline, 2-3 month horizon, and established -1.5pp quarterly trend. Slight positive skew from tail risks appropriate.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - December 2025 actual: 12.3% (factual, official CAPMAS data)
   - CBE/IMF target: 11.8% FY2025-26, 7% Q4 2026 (factual, official statements)
   - Expert forecast: 100bp rate cut Feb 12 (opinion from Société Générale's Ormosi, credible)
   - Trend momentum: -1.5 to -2pp per quarter sustained 16+ months (factual, calculated from official data)
   - Fuel stability: No increases until Oct 2026 (factual, government commitment)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Regional geopolitical escalation (Suez Canal closure, currency crisis) would push outcome UP sharply to 14-18% range. This is the most likely scenario to make forecast look silly, though probability is low (~5-10%). Alternatively, accelerated IMF-driven reforms + stronger global conditions could push DOWN to 9-10% range, but this seems less likely given policy transmission lags.
