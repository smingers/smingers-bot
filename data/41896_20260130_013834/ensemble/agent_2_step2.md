- Oct 2025: 12.5% (some sources cite 13.8%, reconciliation needed)

**Expert opinions:**
- **IMF (Oct 2025)**: 11.8% for FY2025-26 (fiscal year average, not March specifically)

- **CBE (multiple sources)**: Target 7%±2pp by Q4-2026, expects 14-15% calendar-2025 average
- **Egyptian economists (Jan 2026)**: 5-9% by end-2026, continued disinflation expected

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence (warrant large shifts):**
1. **Established disinflation trend**: Multiple official CAPMAS releases show sustained decline from 38% (Sep 2023) → 24% (Dec 2024) → 12-13% (Q4 2025). Causal mechanism: CBE rate hikes (1600bp Mar 2022-Apr 2025), exchange rate stabilization post-March 2024 float, IMF program restoring FX liquidity.
2. **CBE policy guidance**: 525bp cuts since April 2025, more expected (100bp forecast Feb 2026). Real rates remain highly positive (deposit rate 22% vs 12% inflation), supporting continued disinflation without overheating risk.
3. **IMF institutional forecast**: 11.8% FY2025-26 average (July 2025-June 2026). March 2026 falls in Q3 of this fiscal year. IMF has strong Egypt-specific modeling given active $8bn program.

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **Base effects**: March 2025 YoY was elevated (15.7% per outside view), providing favorable comparison base for March 2026. This mechanically reduces YoY inflation.
2. **Food price stabilization**: Multiple sources cite declining food inflation (–2.6% MoM Nov 2025), food is ~1/3 of CPI basket.
3. **FX stability**: EGP trading 47-51 per USD since mid-2025, reduced imported inflation pressure.

**Weak evidence:**
1. **Government aspirational targets**: PM's "10% by 2026" statement is political messaging, not rigorous forecast.
2. **Regional stability assumption**: Cabinet cites "regional stability" but this is fragile (Gaza, Red Sea).

**Reconciling conflicting data:**
The Oct 2025 figure shows discrepancy: some sources cite 12.5%, others 13.8%. Cross-referencing: the 12.5% appears in Nov comparison contexts (CAPMAS Nov release says "down from 12.5% in Oct"), while 13.8% may be headline vs core confusion. I weight CAPMAS official releases most heavily: Nov=12.3%, Oct=12.5%.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction horizon:** 30 Jan 2026 → March 2026 data (released ~10 Apr 2026) = 10 weeks / 2 unreleased data points (Jan, Feb).

**Trajectory implications:**
- Current monthly decline: Dec 2025 (12.3%) vs Sep 2025 (13.5%) = –1.2pp over 3 months = –0.4pp/month average
- If this continues: March 2026 = 12.3% – (3 months × 0.4pp) = 11.1%
- If halved (–0.2pp/month): March 2026 = 12.3% – 0.6pp = 11.7%
- If doubled (–0.8pp/month): March 2026 = 12.3% – 2.4pp = 9.9%

**Timeframe sensitivity:**
- **Shorter horizon (1 month)**: Less room for shocks, would tighten distribution around current trend.
- **Longer horizon (6 months)**: More exposure to FX volatility, geopolitical shocks, administered price changes (fuel hikes typically July). Would widen distribution significantly.

At 2-3 months, we're in a sweet spot where trend momentum is strong but shocks (currency crisis, oil spike) could still materialize.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline:** 10.8% mode, 7.5-15.0% (10th-90th percentile), based on historical Egyptian volatility and –1.8pp average decline from Dec 2025.

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **IMF institutional forecast (11.8% FY2025-26 average) is strong anchor**: The IMF figure represents a fiscal-year average (July 2025-June 2026). If inflation was 12-13% in Q1 (Jul-Sep 2025) and is targeting lower by Q4 (Apr-Jun 2026), March 2026 (Q3 midpoint) should be near the 11.8% average or slightly above. This supports 11-12% range.

2. **CBE's credible commitment to 7%±2pp by Q4-2026**: Multiple independent sources confirm this target. For CBE to hit 5-9% by June 2026, March must be in 10-12% range (allowing 1-2pp further decline Apr-Jun). This narrows the upper tail.

3. **Momentum stronger than historical average**: The –0.4pp/month recent pace exceeds the –0.15pp/month implied by outside view (–1.8pp over 12 months). Current disinflation has institutional drivers (IMF program compliance, CBE credibility rebuilding) absent in some historical episodes. This justifies shifting the mode down from 10.8% to ~10.5%.

4. **Downside risks limited by sticky components**: Services inflation remains elevated; core inflation (11.8% Dec) hasn't declined as fast as headline. This prevents collapse below 9%.

5. **Upside risks contained by policy framework**: Real rates deeply positive, FX reserves building ($50bn+), no scheduled fuel hike before July. Probability of sharp rebound (>14%) is lower than historical volatility suggests.

**Conclusion:** Current circumstances warrant moderate narrowing and slight downward shift from outside view. The 10th-90th range compresses from 7.5-15.0% to 8.5-13.5%, and mode shifts from 10.8% to 10.5%.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point:** Dec 2025 = 12.3%

**Central scenario (60% probability):** Disinflation continues at –0.3 to –0.5pp/month → March 2026 = 10.5-11.5%

**Optimistic scenario (20% probability):** Strong base effects + food deflation accelerates → March 2026 = 8.5-10.5%
- Trigger: Global commodity prices fall further, EGP strengthens to 45/USD

**Pessimistic scenario (20% probability):** Shock disrupts trend → March 2026 = 11.5-13.5%
- Triggers: EGP devaluation to 55/USD, oil spike to $100/bbl, early fuel subsidy cut

**Tail risks (<10% each):**
- Very low (<8.5%): Requires deflationary shock or data error. Implausible given monetary expansion.
- Very high (>13.5%): Requires major crisis (currency collapse, war escalation). CBE/IMF framework makes this unlikely in 10-week horizon.

**Distribution shape:** Slightly left-skewed (longer left tail due to possible sharp disinflation) but constrained by sticky core inflation. Mode at 10.5%, median at 10.8%, mean at 10.9%.

Checklist:
1. **Target variable:** Egypt Urban CPI YoY % change for March 2026, published by May 1, 2026 on Trading Economics.
2. **Outside view:** 10.8% mode, 7.5-15.0% (10th-90th). Final prediction shifts to 10.5% mode, 8.5-13.5% (10th-90th) based on IMF anchor and momentum.
3. **Consistency:** Implied median ≈10.8%, mean ≈10.9%. Aligns with IMF 11.8% FY average and CBE's Q4-2026 glide path.
4. **Key evidence:** (a) Dec 2025 CAPMAS 12.3%, (b) IMF 11.8% FY2025-26 forecast, (c) CBE 7%±2pp Q4-2026 target, (d) –0.4pp/month recent trend, (e) 100bp rate cut expected Feb 2026.
5. **Blind spot:** EGP sudden devaluation to 55+ (e.g., IMF review failure, regional war escalation) would spike inflation to 14-16%, making forecast look too optimistic.
