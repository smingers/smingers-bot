Analysis:
• Source Analysis:
  – Statista: Provides historical inflation data up to 2018–2019 with commentary that inflation was very high (around 20–23 percent) in past years, and that future projections were “expected to level off below 10 percent.” However, the article’s age (circa 2018–2019) limits its direct relevance; its factual data (the 2017 and 2018 figures) is solid but its forward‐looking statements carry opinion from that period.
  – Macrotrends: Summarizes historical annual inflation figures up to 2023 (e.g., 33.88 percent in 2023) and shows considerable volatility. Its numbers are factual and provide context on Egypt’s unstable inflation history, though they are retrospective.
  – World Bank: Offers an interface with long-term data that confirms historical trends but does not provide forecasts—it is reliable for back-testing trends.
  – CBE and Egyptian Streets Articles (Nov 2025 and Aug 2025): Both report recent monetary policy actions and updated inflation readings. Egyptian Streets reports that headline inflation was near 13.9 percent in July 2025 (down from 14.9 percent in June) while CBE commentary along with Capital Economics’ preview signal that disinflation is expected to resume in early 2026. Their expert opinions and policy discussions are current and highly relevant.
  – Capital Economics: Indicates that despite recent pauses, the central bank may ease further in 2026, and forecasts a gradual decline in inflation over Q1 2026. Their assessment is based on careful review of policy stance and economic performance.
  – Agent Report: Maps out a detailed plan for assembling the full Urban CPI series and policy commentary. While it is more of a methodological guide than a forecast, it provides context for the data collection process and confirms that Trading Economics remains a trustworthy source.
  
• Reference Class Analysis:
  – One reference class is Egypt’s past episodes of high inflation that later moderated following aggressive monetary tightening and stabilization policies.
  – Another is the trend seen from mid-2025 through the end of 2025, when inflation showed moderation (from roughly 15 percent in mid-2025 to around 12.3 percent in December 2025 according to TE).
  – Given that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is holding and then hinting at potential rate cuts as disinflation sets in, the most relevant reference class is the recent period (late 2025) combined with historical episodes of policy-induced disinflation in Egypt’s Urban CPI.
  
• Timeframe Analysis:
  – The prediction is for March 2026, which is about two months from today (January 30, 2026). This short timeframe increases the relevance of very recent data (August–November 2025) and near‐term CBE policies.
  – Historically, early Q1 inflation readings in Egypt have sometimes moderated compared to late-year peaks, but the process is often gradual and uncertain.
  
• Justification:
  – Synthesizing the above, recent evidence (Egyptian Streets and CBE articles) indicates that after a period of high monthly inflation in 2025 (with values in the mid-teens), disinflation is expected to resume in Q1 2026. However, the pace of this disinflation is not certain—policy easing, geopolitical uncertainties, and supply-chain factors all play a role.
  – Trading Economics’ historical data (with December 2025 Urban CPI inflation at 12.3 percent) combined with disinflation expectations from Capital Economics suggest that by March 2026 the inflation rate may drift lower, but not dramatically.
  – Recognizing the inherent uncertainty, particularly in an economy with a history of volatility, our distribution is deliberately broad. There is a moderate chance that inflation may drop faster (if policy transmission is very efficient) and also a moderate risk it could remain stubbornly high due to external shocks.
  – Therefore, our outside view sets a median around the low-to-mid 12–13 percent range with a wide 90/10 interval to account for unknown unknowns.

Outside view calibration:
  – We start by tethering our prediction to the late-2025 figure (around 12.3 percent from TE) and then adjust based on the policy signals (expected disinflation in Q1 2026) and historical disinflation behavior. 
  – Recognizing a non-negligible chance of acceleration (if policy measures have a strong effect) or deceleration (if shocks or structural pressures persist), we use a wide distribution.
  – Historical “upset” frequencies in inflation forecasts in Egypt (where external shocks or policy missteps occur) advise us not to overcompress our uncertainty.
  – Thus our cumulative distribution function (CDF) is designed with lower tail (10th percentile) near 9 percent and upper tail (90th percentile) near 15 percent, allowing for both a more optimistic and a more pessimistic scenario.
