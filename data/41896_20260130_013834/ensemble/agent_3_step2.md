Analysis:
We focus on forecasting the Egypt Urban CPI annual inflation rate (year‐over‐year percent change) for March 2026. In brief, we start with the most recent hard data – December 2025 figures from CAPMAS reporting 12.3%—and combine that with the official guidance and expert assessments. The Egyptian Central Bank and several expert sources indicate that after a display of temporary volatility in late Q4 2025 (with some upward pressure from energy and food price movements), disinflation is expected to resume in early 2026. In fact, the CBE‘s forward guidance suggests a gradual decline toward its medium‑term target of around 7% (with target uncertainty of ±2 percentage points) by the final quarter of 2026. Our reference class is Egypt’s recent disinflation cycle (from peaks of over 30% in 2023 down to single‐digit rates in late 2025) and its established policy response.

(a) Source analysis:
– The CAPMAS reports (e.g., “Egypt’s Urban Inflation Slows to 12.3% in November/December 2025”) provide factual and official data on recent inflation.
– Articles from ArabFinance, En.majalla and BNP Paribas Economic Research give background on the government’s inflation target (approximately 10% by 2026) and expert interpretations.
– CBE releases and associated official analyses (e.g., November 2025 communications) are strong, recent evidence that mention a temporary Q4 rise, with disinflation resuming in Q1 2026.
– Other Asknews articles and market surveys from Africa (which mention rate-cut expectations in Egypt) support a view of easing inflation pressures.
The factual data (published up to December 2025) anchor our baseline, whereas expert opinions and CBE forward guidance point to a continuation of disinflation into early 2026.

(b) Evidence analysis:
• Strong evidence: The official CAPMAS figures and recent CBE communications showing a decline from 14% in mid‐2025 to 12.3% by December and targeting further declines through 2026.
• Moderate evidence: Expert and market surveys (e.g., from BNP Paribas and local analysts) noting gradual easing and expected rate cuts.
• Weak evidence: Anecdotal reports on food price changes or very short‐term volatility components.
Overall, multiple independent reliable sources are pointing to a disinflationary path from December 2025 onward.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
Our forecast target is March 2026, roughly 2–3 months from the latest available published data. If the disinflation pace were twice as fast, we could see rates closer to 9% in March; if slower, rates might remain in the low 13% range. With current evidence, we expect a moderate monthly decline on the order of 0.3–0.4 percentage points once disinflation reasserts itself.

(d) Justification:
Starting from December 2025 at 12.3%, and given an anticipated decline of roughly 0.3–0.4 points per month once early 2026—and accounting for some temporary Q1 volatility—we set our median around 10.5% by March 2026. Our inside view shifts the base historical disinflation trend to reflect the weight of official guidance (targeting 7% eventually by Q4 2026) and current expert estimates. Given moderate uncertainty regarding the precise resumption timing and pace of disinflation, we assign a reasonable spread, with lower-tail outcomes near 8.0% and higher-tail outcomes nearing 14.5% for the full distribution.

Probability calibration
Our calibration centers on a median of about 10.5% (implied mean in a similar range), with the distribution reflecting uncertainty from policy timing and external shocks. This distribution is consistent with the outside view base rate from the recent disinflation trend and official forward guidance.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Egypt’s annual Urban CPI inflation rate for March 2026 in percent.
2. Outside view base rate: Declining trend from >30% in 2023 to roughly 12.3% in December 2025, with policy guidance targeting 7% by Q4 2026.
3. Consistency check: "Implied median = 10.5%; mean ~10.5% – in line with the guidance and experts’ assessment."
4. Key evidence:
   • December 2025 CAPMAS figure of 12.3%.
   • CBE communications indicating resumption of disinflation in Q1 2026.
   • Expert opinions and market surveys forecasting gradual easing.
5. Blind-spot: A scenario where geopolitical tensions or unexpected energy price shocks persist into Q1 2026, which would push March inflation significantly higher.
