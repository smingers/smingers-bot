Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological & most relevant)
   • Trading Economics (TE) time-series – factual, high quality. Latest published data: Nov-25 = 12.3 % y/y; Oct-25 = 12.5 %; Sep-25 = 11.7 %; Aug-25 = 12.0 %.  
   • CAPMAS press releases – primary data supplier to TE; fully reliable, but lag three-to-four weeks.  
   • ArabFinance 02-25-2025 – quotes Prime-Minister; factual Nov/Feb figures, but target of “10 % by 2026” is policy aspiration (opinion).  
   • BNP Paribas research 14-Nov-2025 – forecasts FY-26 average inflation 10.7 %; source is a professional forecaster with transparent methodology (moderate evidence).  
   • Majalla 31-Dec-2025 – reviews policy; confirms end-2025 inflation “around 13 %”. Narrative, but factual numbers match TE (moderate evidence).  
   • Al-Ain 15-Jan-2026 & Al-Jazeera 29-Jan-2026 – cite local analysts & Société Générale; expect further CBE rate cuts of 100 bp in Feb-26. Gives forward-looking judgment that disinflation is continuing (opinion from identifiable experts, moderate evidence).  
   • IMF WEO Oct-2025 – projects calendar-year-26 CPI 11-12 %; strong institution, but published three months ago (moderate due to age).  
   • No high-quality source post-Dec-25 reports a re-acceleration; all point to gentle downward trend.

2. Evidence weighing
   Strong:  • TE/CAPMAS hard data show five-month trend of 11-13 % inflation.  
            • Historic pattern: once Egypt’s CPI breaks below 15 %, subsequent three-month change rarely exceeds ±1 pp absent FX shock (2017-18, 2019-20 episodes).  
   Moderate:• BNP and IMF forecasts cluster near 11 %-12 % for early-mid-2026.  
            • Expected 100 bp CBE cut in Feb implies policymakers confident about further easing.  
   Weak:    • Government goal of “10 % by 2026” – aspirational.  
            • Possibility of Ramadan food spike (17 Feb-17 Mar) – historically adds ≤0.6 pp m/m but large base effect March-25 (≈14 %) offsets.

3. Timeframe analysis
   Days to data-point: 60.  
   If horizon were halved (one month), March reading largely baked in → distribution 10 % tighter.  
   If doubled (four months), larger monetary policy feedback & FX uncertainty → tails widen by ≈1 pp each side.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments
   Outside-view base rate = simple average of latest four TE prints → 12.1 %.  
   Downward pull factors (–): base effect (Mar-25 ≈14 %), continuing disinflation momentum, modest EGP appreciation, expected fuel-price freeze until Oct-26.  
   Upward push factors (+): Ramadan food demand, still-high M2 growth (≈22 %), risk of commodity-price uptick.  
   Net: shift median –0.5 pp to 11.6 %. Retain moderately right-skewed distribution because upside shocks historically more frequent than downside surprises.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈ 12.2 %; median = 11.6 %; consistent with narrative and historic volatility (σ six-month ≈ 1.2 pp).

Checklist:
1. Target: Egypt Urban CPI y/y % for Mar-2026 (TE print between question date and 01-May-26).  
2. Base rate: 12.1 %.  
3. Consistency line: “Implied median = 11.6; mean ≈ 12.2; coherent with justification.”  
4. Key evidence: a) TE trend 12-13 % and falling. b) High Mar-25 base 14 %. c) BNP/IMF forecasts 10.7-12 %. d) Expected 100 bp CBE cut signals confidence.  
5. Blind-spot: Sharp EGP depreciation before end-Mar would lift CPI above 15 %.
