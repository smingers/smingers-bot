Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   • CAPMAS/TradingEconomics (hard data, Dec 2025 12.3 % YoY, Dec 2025 publication). Very reliable primary data.  
   • ArabFinance 18 Feb 2025 quoting PM Madbouly: govt target 10 % inflation by 2026. Medium reliability, but target not guarantee.  
   • BNP Paribas Economic-Research note 14 Nov 2025: projects FY 2026 average 10.7 %. Professional forecast, good methodology.  
   • Asharq Al-Awsat & bne IntelliNews (10 Dec & 10 Sep 2025): confirm disinflation trend and policy-rate cuts. Reliable news quoting CAPMAS/CBE.  
   • Al-Ain 15 Jan 2026: domestic analysts expect a 100 bp cut at 12 Feb MPC; YoY inflation 12.3 % in Dec; CBE aims 5–9 % by Q4 2026. Moderate reliability.  
   • Al-Jazeera 29 Jan 2026: SocGen strategist sees “several-hundred-bp” easing in Egypt through 2026. Opinion, but from named expert.  
   • No credible source reports an imminent large devaluation or subsidy hike before May 2026.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)  
   Strong: a) Dec 2025 hard data at 12.3 %; b) Twelve-month downward trend of –1 pp per quarter since mid-2025; c) Tight real rates (+9 pp) and IMF conditionality limiting FX shocks.  
   Moderate: a) Professional forecasts (BNP Paribas 10.7 % FY 2026); b) Expected gradual policy easing (100 bp) still leaves policy tight in real terms; c) Ramadan food-price bump mid-Feb.  
   Weak: a) Political statements about “10 % by 2026”; b) Generic emerging-market talk about African rate-cut cycle.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Days to target data point ≈ 60.  Two-month historical 1-σ move in Egypt’s Urban-CPI YoY during tranquil periods ≈ 0.7 pp; during shock months (>5 % chance) up to 5 pp.  
   If horizon were halved (one month), I would tighten the 90 % interval by ~20 %; doubled (four months) I would widen by ~30 % because risk of subsidy adjustment or FX move grows.

4. Justification / inside-view shift  
   Outside-view base rate (Jan 2024-Dec 2025 trend extrapolation) = 11.5 % for Mar 2026.  
   • Continued base-effects and tight policy (–0.3 pp per month) → –0.6 pp.  
   • Ramadan food demand adds +0.2 pp.  
   • Small probability (15 %) of fuel-price tweak (+1 to +2 pp) and 5 % of FX slippage (>+3 pp).  
   • 25 % chance of faster disinflation on stronger pound (–1 pp).  
   Net effect nudges the median slightly down to 11.0 % and keeps a right-skewed tail. 90 % interval set at 8 %–16 %.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈ 11.3 %; median 11.0 %. Distribution is right-skewed; matches evidence and retains 4 pp 90 % half-width, consistent with past forecast error.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Egypt Urban CPI YoY % for Mar 2026, as reported by TradingEconomics before 1 May 2026.  
2. Outside-view base 11.5 %.  
3. Consistency check: median 11.0 %, mean 11.3 % – coherent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Dec 2025 12.3 % data; (ii) 18-month disinflation trend; (iii) tight real policy rate & IMF program; (iv) BNP Paribas FY 2026 forecast 10.7 %; (v) no sign of imminent devaluation.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden March fuel-price hike or currency slip pushing YoY above 16 %.
