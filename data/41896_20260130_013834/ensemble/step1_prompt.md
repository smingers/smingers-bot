- **GDP**: Around 2017, Egypt's GDP dropped to below $240 billion USD, described as a historical low
- **Unemployment**: Has steadily remained between 12-13 percent

**Historical Context Provided:**
The article attributes Egypt's economic instability to prolonged political unrest, including:
- January 2011 protests against President Hosni Mubarak
- Mohamed Morsi's election in 2012 and overthrow in 2013

# Summary of CBE Interest Rate Decision Article (November 21, 2025)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Interest Rates:**
- The Central Bank of Egypt's Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold key interest rates steady (specific rates mentioned but values not provided in extracted text)

**Economic Growth:**
- Real GDP growth increased to 5.2% in Q3 2025 (up from 5.0%)
- Growth driven by non-petroleum manufacturing, trade, and tourism sectors
- CBE projects economy will reach maximum capacity by end of FY 2025/2026
- Unemployment rate rose slightly to 6.4% in Q3 2025

**Inflation Data:**
- Both annual headline inflation and core inflation increased in October 2025 (specific percentages not provided in extracted text)
- Monthly increase attributed to rising non-food prices, particularly services
- Food price inflation showed moderation

## CBE's Inflation Forecast and Outlook:

- **Near-term:** Annual headline inflation forecast to temporarily rise in late Q4 2025 due to energy price increases
- **Medium-term:** Expected to decline again in the second half of 2026 toward the bank's target
- **Target:** 7% (± unspecified percentage points) by Q4 2026

## Upside Risks to Inflation Identified:

1. Escalating geopolitical tensions
2. Stubborn services inflation
3. Unforeseen effects from fiscal consolidation measures
4. Potential supply chain disruptions (globally)

## Policy Stance:

The MPC adopted a "wait-and-see" or cautious approach, maintaining steady rates to contain inflationary pressures, anchor market expectations, and ensure inflation remains on a downward path.

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve Egypt monthly Urban CPI YoY 2014-2025 and policy commentary from Trading Economics, IMF reports, and CBE statements
The objective is to assemble (a) the full 2014-2025 monthly Urban-CPI year-on-year series for Egypt and (b) a coherent body of policy commentary drawn from three streams – Trading Economics (TE) news, Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) press material, and IMF country reports.  

1. Numerical backbone – Urban CPI YoY 2014-2025  
   • Trading Economics explicitly exposes the whole history through its open “guest” API:  
     https://api.tradingeconomics.com/inflation/country/egypt?c=guest:guest&d1=2014-01-01&d2=2025-12-31&f=csv.  
     The indicator labelled “Inflation Rate” in TE is the CAPMAS-published Urban CPI YoY series; the HTML page confirms the December-2025 YoY figure of 12.3 % (source: Trading Economics Egypt Inflation Rate page).  
   • None of the search hits display the 144 individual monthly values, but the API call is documented and public, so a one-shot CSV download will yield the full table.  
   • Spot-checking can be done with CAPMAS bulletins – e.g., the “Monthly Bulletin of Consumer Price Index – Oct 2016” (CAPMAS metadata catalogue) – to validate a few months.  

   Remaining gap: the CSV itself still needs to be downloaded and pasted into the deliverable; the search results do not list the rows.

2. CBE policy commentary (inflation notes & Monetary Policy Committee communiqués)  
   • Isolated PDFs have surfaced: a July-2018 CPI press release mirrored on Enterprise Press and the December-2025 MPC decision located earlier (not in the current round).  
   • The CBE site search returns 1 676 PDFs and reveals the repository path where Monetary Policy publications live (cbe.org.eg search-results page).  
   • The “MPC Meetings Schedule” landing page shows that decisions are archived back to 2005 but the individual statement links are not enumerated in the HTML snippet provided (cbe.org.eg/en/monetary-policy/mpc-meetings-schedule).  
   • A 2015-2016 CBE Annual Report PDF is now captured (annual-report-2015-2016.pdf) and certainly contains a narrative of inflation developments and policy actions for that fiscal year.  

   Coverage assessment: we still lack the systematic monthly CPI press releases (≈12 × 12 years) and the eight-times-a-year MPC statements for 2014-2024. A year-by-year “site:cbe.org.eg CPI press release yyyy pdf” scrape is still required.

3. IMF inflation discussion  
   • One IMF Country Report is confirmed – “Arab Republic of Egypt: 2021 Article IV Consultation and Second SBA Review” (Ideas.Repec / EconBiz bibliographic record).  
   • Reports for 2014-2018 (start of the Extended Fund Facility), 2019-2020 (SBA), and 2022-2025 (Post-Program Monitoring, Resilience & Sustainability Facility) are still missing.  
   • No barrier other than retrieval remains: IMF.org hosts all Country Reports free of charge.

4. Trading Economics news flow  
   • The TE “news” endpoint is documented:  
     https://api.tradingeconomics.com/news?c=guest:guest&country=egypt&category=Inflation%20Rate&d1=2014-01-01&d2=2024-12-31&f=csv.  
     Only two 2025 stories have been captured so far; 2014-2024 remain to be exported.  
   • These news blurbs typically summarise each monthly CPI print and often quote CBE or ministerial remarks, covering the “policy commentary from Trading Economics” aspect of the user’s request.

5. Ancillary factual confirmations discovered this round  
   • Producer-price and core-inflation pages on TE (core inflation rate, producer prices) reaffirm CAPMAS as primary source and demonstrate TE’s data depth but do not change the Urban-CPI task.  
   • World Bank inflation page and Brookings-Doha analysis of the 2016 IMF program surfaced but are background, not primary series.  

Conclusions on completeness relative to the user brief  
• Numeric series: a guaranteed retrieval path exists via TE API, but the actual 144-row series has not yet been pasted into an answer – still missing.  
• CBE commentary: proof-of-concept documents found; bulk of 2014-2024 PDFs still outstanding.  
• IMF commentary: only the 2021 report is in hand; at least six more annual Article IV / program reviews are absent.  
• TE news commentary: only 2025 covered; 2014-2024 to be exported.  

Therefore, while the architecture for fulfilling the request is now fully mapped and all sources are publicly accessible, three substantive data-collection passes remain before a finished deliverable (numbers + stitched narrative) can be produced.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.
- Always start with a smaller number (more negative if negative) and then increase from there
