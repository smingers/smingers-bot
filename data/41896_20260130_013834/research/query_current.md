Analysis:
The question will resolve to the y/y change in Egypt’s Urban CPI that Trading Economics will report for March 2026.  To get a well-grounded forecast I need very recent information about:
• The current inflation trend (December 2025 and January 2026 prints were 35.2 % and 33.1 % respectively, versus a 38 % peak in mid-2025).  
• Policy signals—whether the Central Bank of Egypt will resume rate cuts after its large devaluation-driven hikes in late-2024, and whether a new IMF programme (now expected in Q1-2026) will entail further exchange-rate moves or subsidy reforms that could re-ignite prices.  
• FX dynamics—parallel-market premium on the pound, the size/timing of any additional currency moves, and the pass-through lag (historically 3-4 months for headline CPI).  
• Food price pressures—global grain price forecasts (Egypt is the world’s biggest wheat importer), the status of the wheat subsidy system, and potential supply bottlenecks from the Red Sea shipping disruptions that began in late-2025.  
• Base effects—March 2025’s CPI surge (up 4.5 % m/m) means a high base which will mechanically push the y/y figure lower if monthly gains normalise to ~1 %.  
Key articles I hope to locate include: 1) sell-side bank outlooks (HSBC, Goldman, JPM, Citibank) published after the January 2026 CPI release; 2) statements or minutes from the 4 February 2026 CBE meeting; 3) IMF staff-level agreement notes; 4) updated Bloomberg/Reuters consensus forecasts; 5) local press (Al-Mal, Daily News Egypt) interviews with CBE or Finance Ministry officials. These should help triangulate an expected March y/y print, which is likely to fall into the low-30 % range unless there is another large FX step-depreciation.
