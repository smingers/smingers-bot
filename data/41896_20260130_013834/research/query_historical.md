Analysis:
Egypt’s Urban CPI inflation has been highly sensitive to exchange-rate adjustments, subsidy reforms, and food price shocks. The most recent bout of inflation was triggered by successive devaluations in March 2022, October 2022 and January 2023, driving the headline YoY rate to a record 38% in September 2023. Since then, three factors have pushed inflation lower: 1) a prolonged period of tight monetary policy (policy rate at 21.75% since August 2023); 2) favourable base effects once the large price jumps of 2023 dropped out of the annual comparison; and 3) a partial easing in global food and fuel prices. By December 2025 the Urban CPI YoY rate had fallen to roughly the mid-teens (TradingEconomics shows 15-16%), and the central bank has signalled it may begin an easing cycle if disinflation stays on track.

To forecast March 2026 we need an outside view of reasonable inflation ranges given Egypt’s historical behaviour and policy constraints:

1. Exchange-rate pass-through. A further FX step-devaluation is possible before the IMF programme review expected in Q2 2026, but authorities have tried to smooth volatility via increased FX availability and a gradual crawl. Assuming no 20-30% one-off devaluation before March, pass-through is likely muted compared with 2023.

2. Food prices seasonality. March tends to see slightly higher MoM prints because of Ramadan demand, but the effect on YoY is limited unless shocks occur.

3. Base effects. March 2025 registered about 17%. With MoM inflation running near 0.7% on average recently, maintaining that pace implies a YoY figure for March 2026 near 14-15%. A modest acceleration (e.g., due to a 5-10% pound weakening) could lift it toward 18-20%; a faster disinflation path could push it into the 11-13% band.

4. Policy. The Central Bank of Egypt remains under pressure to cut rates to support growth and fiscal sustainability, but will likely move cautiously until inflation is solidly in the single-digit trajectory targeted for 2027. Therefore a dramatic re-acceleration before March 2026 appears unlikely barring a sharp currency shock.

Putting these elements together, the historical outside view suggests a central tendency around 13-17%, with tail risk skewed upward if a sizable devaluation occurs and downward if global food prices fall further and fiscal consolidation continues.
