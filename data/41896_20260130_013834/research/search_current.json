According to the IMF's Article IV consultation, recent policy missteps have reduced cash buffers, weakened the currency, and pushed inflation back into double digits after the conclusion of a Fund-supported programme in March 2025. The IMF reported that Suriname's gross debt has risen to 106% of GDP, primarily due to a liability management operation, while the current account deficit exceeded 30% of GDP due to imports for offshore oil field development. Although GDP growth is slowing due to declining gold production, non-natural resource growth is forecast at 4.7% in 2026, with a projected surge to around 30% in 2028 when offshore oil production begins. The IMF called for significant fiscal adjustment in 2026, urging Suriname to raise its primary surplus by resuming electricity subsidy cuts, restraining the wage bill, and improving tax administration. Directors emphasized the importance of strong institutions for managing future oil wealth and urged full implementation of recently passed public financial management and sovereign wealth fund legislation. The Fund also recommended bringing reserve money to target through open-market operations and limiting foreign exchange interventions to cases of disorderly market conditions. The IMF expects the next consultation with Suriname to occur on the standard 12-month cycle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:36 PM\nSource:[Newsbase](https://newsbase.com/story/imf-warns-suriname-s-policy-slippages-threaten-stability-ahead-of-oil-boom-422988)\n\n**Ukraine Suddenly Cuts Interest Rates by 50 Basis Points**\nOn January 29, 2026, the National Bank of Ukraine lowered its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 15%, marking the first rate cut since March 2024 and the first since June 2024. This decision ended nearly a year of unchanged borrowing costs. The central bank cited declining price pressures and reduced external financing risks\u2014due to EU's pledge of a 90-billion-euro loan and an IMF agreement for over $8 billion over four years\u2014as key reasons for the move. Inflation had eased from 15.9% in May to 8% by December 2025, with the bank projecting a further slowdown in 2026, though a rebound is expected due to rising costs from energy infrastructure damage. Inflation is forecast to reach 7.5% in 2026, up from the previous estimate of 6.6%. The IMF program remains pending board approval, contingent on Ukraine completing preconditions, including a proposed bill to raise taxes on self-employed individuals and expand duties on foreign parcels\u2014though the cabinet has not yet submitted the draft. The central bank projects foreign exchange reserves to reach a record $65 billion by 2026.

While analysts predict the South African Reserve Bank will revise its 2026 inflation forecast downward to 3.3% from 3.5%, nearing its 3% target, opinions are divided on whether rates should be cut. Bloomberg surveyed 24 economists: 13 expect rates to remain unchanged at 6.75%, while 11 anticipate a 25-basis-point reduction. The debate centers on whether policymakers will wait for clearer signals from the rand and oil prices or act now amid recent currency strength. South Africa\u2019s decision will influence neighboring countries\u2014Eswatini, Namibia, and Lesotho\u2014whose currencies are pegged to the rand, with their own decisions expected in the coming days. Other key African economies, including Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya, are also poised to cut rates in their first policy meetings of 2026, as inflation pressures continue to ease. According to Angela Golligher, lead economist at Ernst & Young Africa, African policymakers must balance the opportunity for monetary easing against persistent external vulnerabilities, especially with global growth projected at 3.1%. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s emerging markets strategist, Giorgio Ormosi, forecasts rate cuts of 100 basis points in Egypt, 25 in Kenya, and 200 in Nigeria. He notes that while domestic inflation trends and expectations allow for cuts, timing and size remain uncertain, largely due to potential shifts in global investor sentiment. Ormosi expects several hundred basis points in cuts in Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria by 2026, with Kenya\u2019s final rate potentially reaching 8.5%, though risks of further decline remain. Mauritius and Uganda are expected to hold rates steady for further inflation monitoring. In Ghana, the central bank reduced rates by 250 basis points to 15.50% on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, following inflation\u2019s drop to 5.4% in December\u2014below the 6% target for the first time since 2019. Mozambique also cut its rate from 9.50% to 9.25%, as inflation declines and real interest rates stand at 6.3%. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained rates at 3.5%-3.75% in its first 2026 meeting, with Chair Jerome Powell warning that the U.S. federal budget deficit is on an 'unsustainable path' and urging swift action.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:17 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2026/1/29/african-economies-interest-rate)\n\n**Analysts Predict Small Selic Rate Cut in March 2026 After Copom Signals Shift in Monetary Policy**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) announced it will maintain the Selic rate at 15% per year, but signaled it intends to begin lowering interest rates in its upcoming meeting on March 17\u201318, 2026. Analysts highlighted the shift in tone, particularly the removal of the previous directive requiring a 'significantly contractionary monetary policy for a prolonged period.' Adriana Dupita of Bloomberg noted the commitment to start rate cuts in March is a 'welcome and important signal' for market agents, providing a clear timeline. Jos\u00e9 Marcio Camargo of Genial Investimentos emphasized the significance of this shift in communication. Juliana Inhasz of Insper stated the softer tone was expected, but noted the central bank's 'we're watching' approach. Most economists anticipate a modest 0.25 percentage point cut in March, though Dupita predicts a larger 0.5-point reduction, arguing it is necessary to loosen policy, especially if inflation expectations continue to decline. She cited the weakening Brazilian real, which closed at R$ 5.207 on January 28, 2026, its lowest level in nearly two years. Andr\u00e9 Braz of Ibre-FGV warned of a cautious approach, stating the central bank will 'feel the temperature' before acting. He cited potential inflation-reducing factors such as a projected 2% drop in gasoline prices (which could reduce the IPCA by 0.1 percentage points) and the possibility of a green electricity tariff. However, he noted rising school fees may contribute to broader price increases. Ailton Braga, former BC analyst and current Senate advisor, pointed to economic deceleration, citing the IBC-Br (Central Bank's Economic Activity Index) showing the peak of economic activity occurred early in 2025. He also noted that the three-month inflation trend is moving closer to the 3% target midpoint.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2026/01/anuncio-de-corte-de-juros-em-proxima-reuniao-do-copom-da-prazo-para-mercado-se-ajustar-dizem-analistas.shtml)\n\n**Market Majority Views Selic Rate Cut as Justifiable, Survey Shows**\nA BTG survey of 66 market participants conducted between January 26 and 27, 2026, found that a majority view a potential Selic rate cut by the Central Bank's Copom as justifiable, with 3% considering it 'neutral', 21.2% viewing it as 'questionable' due to persistent inflation risks, and 7.6% labeling it a 'monetary policy error'. Most respondents expect the Copom's communication tone to be predominantly neutral, with a smaller share anticipating a dovish bias. A majority predict a marginal adjustment to the statement affirming the contractionary policy stance is appropriate, and half expect the removal of the phrase 'will not hesitate to resume the adjustment cycle'. Regarding inflation projections, 65% expect the 2027 third-quarter IPCA forecast to remain at 3.2%, while 31% project 3.1% or lower. For March 2026, 68% forecast a 50-basis-point Selic cut. By the end of 2026, 71% of responses converge on a rate range of 12% to 12.5%, keeping monetary policy contractionary. On the economic outlook, 53% see a moderate improvement in external conditions for disinflation, 47% perceive moderate improvement in inflation dynamics since the last meeting, and 50% report no significant change in domestic economic activity indicators. Inflation expectations show 61% projecting IPCA between 3.5% and 4.0% in 2026, 29% between 4.0% and 4.5%, and 11% below 3.5%. Risk balance is seen as neutral by 47%, with 36% perceiving downside asymmetry. On the exchange rate, 53% project the dollar at R$ 5.30\u2013R$ 5.40 over the next 3\u20136 months, with 41% expecting appreciation below R$ 5.25. On January 28, 2026, the dollar initially declined and then rose, after reaching its lowest closing level since May 28, 2024, in the previous session.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 04:34 PM\nSource:[E-Investidor](https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas/copom-maioria-mercado-avalia-corte-selic-justificavel/)\n\n**IMF Warns of Economic Overheating in Kazakhstan Amid High Inflation and Growth Risks**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of economic overheating in Kazakhstan, citing rising inflation and unsustainable growth trends. According to the IMF report published by Tengrinews.kz, Kazakhstan's economy is projected to grow by 6.2% in 2025, up from approximately 5% in 2023\u20132024, driven by increased oil production, loose fiscal policy, expanded quasi-fiscal activities by state-owned companies, and rapid consumer credit growth. Inflation remains persistently high at 12\u201312.5%, more than double the National Bank\u2019s target. The IMF identifies key risks including high inflation, rising household debt from consumer lending, soft fiscal policy with large transfers from the National Fund, expansion of state company quasi-fiscal operations, and external uncertainty, particularly the potential decline in global oil prices. Despite tightening monetary policy, its impact is partially offset by excess liquidity and large government programs. The IMF notes clear signs of economic overheating, with strong domestic demand and external factors pushing inflation well above target. The current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4% of GDP in 2025 due to rising imports, fueled by investments and state support programs. The IMF recommends maintaining a tight monetary policy until inflation stabilizes, potentially raising the base rate, accelerating fiscal consolidation, reducing quasi-fiscal activities, limiting procyclical spending, and advancing structural reforms to reduce state involvement and boost the private sector. In the medium term, growth is forecast to slow to 3\u20133.5%, with inflation gradually declining and reaching the 5% target only by 2030. The National Bank of Kazakhstan maintained its base rate at 18% annually with a \u00b11 percentage point corridor, signaling it is likely to remain unchanged until the end of the first half of 2026. Kazakhstan remains the top performer in the CIS for real GDP growth, according to the IMF\u2019s October 2025 assessment.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:42 AM\nSource:[Tengrinews.kz](https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/mvf-predupredil-ob-ugroze-peregreva-ekonomiki-kazahstana-591310/)\n\n**In First 2026 Meeting, Copom Expected to Keep Interest Rate Stable at 15% Amid Inflation Concerns**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate unchanged at 15% per year during its first meeting of 2026\u2014the highest level in nearly 20 years. This would mark the fifth consecutive hold in the rate, according to market economists. The decision, announced after 6:00 PM, reflects the Central Bank's ongoing strategy to control inflation by maintaining high rates, despite signs of economic deceleration. Economists note that inflation remains above the target range of 1.5% to 4.5%, with the goal set at 3% under the continuous target system introduced in early 2025. The Central Bank evaluates future inflation projections, not current price changes, as rate adjustments take six to 18 months to fully impact the economy. As of now, the Bank is assessing inflation trends through the third quarter of 2027. Analysts such as S\u00e9rgio Samuel dos Santos of Sistema Ailos and Gustavo Sung of Suno Research emphasize that Copom should remain cautious, citing strong economic activity, a tight labor market with unemployment at historic lows, and the need for clearer signals before initiating rate cuts. The economy continues to operate above its potential without significantly increasing inflation, as indicated by a positive 'output gap' in the previous Copom minutes. Market forecasts project the first rate reduction to occur in March 2026, lowering the Selic to 14.5% per year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:01 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2026/01/28/na-primeira-reuniao-de-2026-copom-deve-manter-juro-estavel-em-15percent-ao-ano-maior-nivel-em-quase-20-anos.ghtml)\n\n**Sri Lanka central bank holds policy rate steady as IMF review looms**\nSri Lanka's Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) maintained its overnight policy rate at 7.75%, as unanimously predicted by a Reuters poll of twelve economists, amid anticipation of the IMF's latest review of the $2.9 billion four-year debt bailout programme. The decision follows a period of stability since May 2024, during which the rate has remained unchanged as the country recovers from the 2022 financial crisis triggered by a severe dollar shortage. The CBSL cited stable inflation, healthy credit growth, and steady economic expansion as key reasons for the hold. Inflation stood at 2.1% at the end of 2025, with core inflation expected to accelerate as economic demand strengthens. An IMF fact-finding mission is currently in Colombo, concluding its visit on January 28, 2026, to assess government policies ahead of approving the sixth tranche of the IMF programme. Meeting IMF targets is critical for improving Sri Lanka\u2019s credit rating after its default, enabling re-entry into international financial markets by 2028. The recovery was disrupted by Cyclone Ditwah in late November 2025, which killed approximately 650 people and affected nearly 10% of the 22 million population, causing an estimated $4.1 billion in infrastructure damage according to the World Bank.

This decision ended nearly a year of unchanged borrowing costs. The central bank cited declining price pressures and reduced external financing risks\u2014due to EU's pledge of a 90-billion-euro loan and an IMF agreement for over $8 billion over four years\u2014as key reasons for the move. Inflation had eased from 15.9% in May to 8% by December 2025, with the bank projecting a further slowdown in 2026, though a rebound is expected due to rising costs from energy infrastructure damage. Inflation is forecast to reach 7.5% in 2026, up from the previous estimate of 6.6%. The IMF program remains pending board approval, contingent on Ukraine completing preconditions, including a proposed bill to raise taxes on self-employed individuals and expand duties on foreign parcels\u2014though the cabinet has not yet submitted the draft. The central bank projects foreign exchange reserves to reach a record $65 billion by 2026. GDP growth forecast for 2026 was revised downward from 2% to 1.8% due to widespread damage to energy infrastructure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:27 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202601293635655127.html)\n\n**Despite Projections: Central Bank May Not Cut Key Rate at Upcoming Meetings**\nDespite widespread expectations, the Central Bank of Russia may not lower its key interest rate at its upcoming meetings on February 13 and March 20, 2026, according to a report by 'Roscongress' which forecasts continued tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, expert opinions vary: Financial analyst Mikhail Belyaev argues that inflation in Russia is non-monetary in nature, driven by pricing behavior of trading organizations, and that effective antitrust enforcement\u2014such as empowering the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to curb excessive price hikes\u2014is essential. Without such measures, inflation will persist. He warns that maintaining a high key rate of 16% annually will stifle business growth due to limited credit access, effectively placing an economic straitjacket on the economy, potentially leading to a survival of only state-supported or subsidized firms. Meanwhile, Georgy Ostapkovich, head of the Center for Conjointure Research at HSE University, challenges the 'Roscongress' forecast, citing a 1.72% cumulative inflation rate from January 1 to 19, suggesting January inflation could exceed 2%\u2014the highest in 10\u201315 years. He also notes that public inflation expectations are around 13.5\u201314.5%, which, per economic theory, justifies maintaining the current rate. However, he highlights signs of economic stagnation and recessionary trends, especially in the civilian sector, driven by the high rate. Ostapkovich believes the Central Bank may choose to prioritize economic stability over inflation control and could symbolically cut the rate by 0.25 percentage points at the February meeting, signaling a shift in policy. He emphasizes that the February decision will be difficult and advocates for supporting the economy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:28 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/economics/2026/01/29/vopreki-prognozam-cb-mozhet-ne-ponizit-klyuchevuyu-stavku-na-blizhayshikh-zasedaniyakh.html)\n\n**Africa's Economies Prepare for Interest Rate Cuts Amid Shifting Inflation Trends**\nAfrica's major economies are preparing to cut interest rates, with South Africa's central bank decision on interest rates drawing significant attention on Thursday, January 29, 2026. While analysts predict the South African Reserve Bank will revise its 2026 inflation forecast downward to 3.3% from 3.5%, nearing its 3% target, opinions are divided on whether rates should be cut. Bloomberg surveyed 24 economists: 13 expect rates to remain unchanged at 6.75%, while 11 anticipate a 25-basis-point reduction. The debate centers on whether policymakers will wait for clearer signals from the rand and oil prices or act now amid recent currency strength. South Africa\u2019s decision will influence neighboring countries\u2014Eswatini, Namibia, and Lesotho\u2014whose currencies are pegged to the rand, with their own decisions expected in the coming days. Other key African economies, including Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya, are also poised to cut rates in their first policy meetings of 2026, as inflation pressures continue to ease. According to Angela Golligher, lead economist at Ernst & Young Africa, African policymakers must balance the opportunity for monetary easing against persistent external vulnerabilities, especially with global growth projected at 3.1%. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s emerging markets strategist, Giorgio Ormosi, forecasts rate cuts of 100 basis points in Egypt, 25 in Kenya, and 200 in Nigeria. He notes that while domestic inflation trends and expectations allow for cuts, timing and size remain uncertain, largely due to potential shifts in global investor sentiment. Ormosi expects several hundred basis points in cuts in Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria by 2026, with Kenya\u2019s final rate potentially reaching 8.5%, though risks of further decline remain. Mauritius and Uganda are expected to hold rates steady for further inflation monitoring. In Ghana, the central bank reduced rates by 250 basis points to 15.50% on Wednesday, January 28, 2026, following inflation\u2019s drop to 5.4% in December\u2014below the 6% target for the first time since 2019. Mozambique also cut its rate from 9.50% to 9.25%, as inflation declines and real interest rates stand at 6.3%. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained rates at 3.5%-3.75% in its first 2026 meeting, with Chair Jerome Powell warning that the U.S. federal budget deficit is on an 'unsustainable path' and urging swift action.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 07:17 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2026/1/29/african-economies-interest-rate)\n\n**Analysts Predict Small Selic Rate Cut in March 2026 After Copom Signals Shift in Monetary Policy**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) announced it will maintain the Selic rate at 15% per year, but signaled it intends to begin lowering interest rates in its upcoming meeting on March 17\u201318, 2026. Analysts highlighted the shift in tone, particularly the removal of the previous directive requiring a 'significantly contractionary monetary policy for a prolonged period.' Adriana Dupita of Bloomberg noted the commitment to start rate cuts in March is a 'welcome and important signal' for market agents, providing a clear timeline. Jos\u00e9 Marcio Camargo of Genial Investimentos emphasized the significance of this shift in communication. Juliana Inhasz of Insper stated the softer tone was expected, but noted the central bank's 'we're watching' approach. Most economists anticipate a modest 0.25 percentage point cut in March, though Dupita predicts a larger 0.5-point reduction, arguing it is necessary to loosen policy, especially if inflation expectations continue to decline. She cited the weakening Brazilian real, which closed at R$ 5.207 on January 28, 2026, its lowest level in nearly two years. Andr\u00e9 Braz of Ibre-FGV warned of a cautious approach, stating the central bank will 'feel the temperature' before acting. He cited potential inflation-reducing factors such as a projected 2% drop in gasoline prices (which could reduce the IPCA by 0.1 percentage points) and the possibility of a green electricity tariff. However, he noted rising school fees may contribute to broader price increases. Ailton Braga, former BC analyst and current Senate advisor, pointed to economic deceleration, citing the IBC-Br (Central Bank's Economic Activity Index) showing the peak of economic activity occurred early in 2025. He also noted that the three-month inflation trend is moving closer to the 3% target midpoint.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2026/01/anuncio-de-corte-de-juros-em-proxima-reuniao-do-copom-da-prazo-para-mercado-se-ajustar-dizem-analistas.shtml)\n\n**Market Majority Views Selic Rate Cut as Justifiable, Survey Shows**\nA BTG survey of 66 market participants conducted between January 26 and 27, 2026, found that a majority view a potential Selic rate cut by the Central Bank's Copom as justifiable, with 3% considering it 'neutral', 21.2% viewing it as 'questionable' due to persistent inflation risks, and 7.6% labeling it a 'monetary policy error'. Most respondents expect the Copom's communication tone to be predominantly neutral, with a smaller share anticipating a dovish bias. A majority predict a marginal adjustment to the statement affirming the contractionary policy stance is appropriate, and half expect the removal of the phrase 'will not hesitate to resume the adjustment cycle'. Regarding inflation projections, 65% expect the 2027 third-quarter IPCA forecast to remain at 3.2%, while 31% project 3.1% or lower. For March 2026, 68% forecast a 50-basis-point Selic cut. By the end of 2026, 71% of responses converge on a rate range of 12% to 12.5%, keeping monetary policy contractionary. On the economic outlook, 53% see a moderate improvement in external conditions for disinflation, 47% perceive moderate improvement in inflation dynamics since the last meeting, and 50% report no significant change in domestic economic activity indicators. Inflation expectations show 61% projecting IPCA between 3.5% and 4.0% in 2026, 29% between 4.0% and 4.5%, and 11% below 3.5%. Risk balance is seen as neutral by 47%, with 36% perceiving downside asymmetry. On the exchange rate, 53% project the dollar at R$ 5.30\u2013R$ 5.40 over the next 3\u20136 months, with 41% expecting appreciation below R$ 5.25.

According to the IMF report published by Tengrinews.kz, Kazakhstan's economy is projected to grow by 6.2% in 2025, up from approximately 5% in 2023\u20132024, driven by increased oil production, loose fiscal policy, expanded quasi-fiscal activities by state-owned companies, and rapid consumer credit growth. Inflation remains persistently high at 12\u201312.5%, more than double the National Bank\u2019s target. The IMF identifies key risks including high inflation, rising household debt from consumer lending, soft fiscal policy with large transfers from the National Fund, expansion of state company quasi-fiscal operations, and external uncertainty, particularly the potential decline in global oil prices. Despite tightening monetary policy, its impact is partially offset by excess liquidity and large government programs. The IMF notes clear signs of economic overheating, with strong domestic demand and external factors pushing inflation well above target. The current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4% of GDP in 2025 due to rising imports, fueled by investments and state support programs. The IMF recommends maintaining a tight monetary policy until inflation stabilizes, potentially raising the base rate, accelerating fiscal consolidation, reducing quasi-fiscal activities, limiting procyclical spending, and advancing structural reforms to reduce state involvement and boost the private sector. In the medium term, growth is forecast to slow to 3\u20133.5%, with inflation gradually declining and reaching the 5% target only by 2030. The National Bank of Kazakhstan maintained its base rate at 18% annually with a \u00b11 percentage point corridor, signaling it is likely to remain unchanged until the end of the first half of 2026. Kazakhstan remains the top performer in the CIS for real GDP growth, according to the IMF\u2019s October 2025 assessment.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:42 AM\nSource:[Tengrinews.kz](https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/mvf-predupredil-ob-ugroze-peregreva-ekonomiki-kazahstana-591310/)\n\n**Powell Expected to Pause Interest Rate Cuts Amid Strong Economic Data and Leadership Transition Uncertainty**\nAnalysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate cuts during its January 28, 2026, meeting, citing strong macroeconomic data as a reason to halt the current easing cycle. Despite a 75 basis point cumulative rate reduction over the last three meetings, including a hawkish cut in December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is likely to adopt a cautious stance. Michael Krautzberger, Global CIO of Public Markets at Allianz Global Investors, notes that robust GDP growth in Q3, a declining unemployment rate in December, and persistent underlying inflation\u20142.8% year-on-year in the PCE index\u2014support a resilient economic environment. Although inflation has moderated, it remains elevated. Revised projections show stronger GDP growth forecasts and only modest downward adjustments in unemployment and inflation, reflecting growing confidence in an AI-driven productivity boom. Despite this optimism, the median rate path still anticipates 25 basis point cuts in both 2026 and 2027, with significant dispersion in expectations. Bankinter Gest\u00e3o de Ativos agrees, stating that current data\u2014moderating inflation and a balanced labor market\u2014do not justify immediate rate changes. However, signs of labor market softening and the upcoming Federal Reserve leadership transition may lead to additional cuts. Analysts anticipate two further cuts in 2026, though caution is advised due to uncertainty. Political pressures, including legal scrutiny over Jerome Powell\u2019s Senate testimony and the impending departure of Governor Cook, may encourage Fed policymakers to project unity and avoid rate cuts without visible economic weakness. The most impactful element for markets may be Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference comments, particularly any indication of his intention to remain on the Board beyond his presidential term ending May 15, 2026. A hold on rates\u2014widely expected\u2014would likely not trigger significant market reactions. Allianz GI maintains its base case of a final rate cut in Q2 2026, with a terminal rate slightly above current market pricing. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for March 17\u201318, 2026, still under Powell\u2019s chairmanship.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:15 AM\nSource:[SAPO](https://sapo.pt/artigo/powell-devera-fazer-uma-pausa-na-descida-dos-juros-6979b7bc0c790b08bd2cc075)\n\n**In First 2026 Meeting, Copom Expected to Keep Interest Rate Stable at 15% Amid Inflation Concerns**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic interest rate unchanged at 15% per year during its first meeting of 2026\u2014the highest level in nearly 20 years. This would mark the fifth consecutive hold in the rate, according to market economists. The decision, announced after 6:00 PM, reflects the Central Bank's ongoing strategy to control inflation by maintaining high rates, despite signs of economic deceleration. Economists note that inflation remains above the target range of 1.5% to 4.5%, with the goal set at 3% under the continuous target system introduced in early 2025. The Central Bank evaluates future inflation projections, not current price changes, as rate adjustments take six to 18 months to fully impact the economy. As of now, the Bank is assessing inflation trends through the third quarter of 2027. Analysts such as S\u00e9rgio Samuel dos Santos of Sistema Ailos and Gustavo Sung of Suno Research emphasize that Copom should remain cautious, citing strong economic activity, a tight labor market with unemployment at historic lows, and the need for clearer signals before initiating rate cuts. The economy continues to operate above its potential without significantly increasing inflation, as indicated by a positive 'output gap' in the previous Copom minutes. Market forecasts project the first rate reduction to occur in March 2026, lowering the Selic to 14.5% per year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 03:01 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2026/01/28/na-primeira-reuniao-de-2026-copom-deve-manter-juro-estavel-em-15percent-ao-ano-maior-nivel-em-quase-20-anos.ghtml)\n\n**Sri Lanka central bank holds policy rate steady as IMF review looms**\nSri Lanka's Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) maintained its overnight policy rate at 7.75%, as unanimously predicted by a Reuters poll of twelve economists, amid anticipation of the IMF's latest review of the $2.9 billion four-year debt bailout programme. The decision follows a period of stability since May 2024, during which the rate has remained unchanged as the country recovers from the 2022 financial crisis triggered by a severe dollar shortage. The CBSL cited stable inflation, healthy credit growth, and steady economic expansion as key reasons for the hold. Inflation stood at 2.1% at the end of 2025, with core inflation expected to accelerate as economic demand strengthens. An IMF fact-finding mission is currently in Colombo, concluding its visit on January 28, 2026, to assess government policies ahead of approving the sixth tranche of the IMF programme. Meeting IMF targets is critical for improving Sri Lanka\u2019s credit rating after its default, enabling re-entry into international financial markets by 2028. The recovery was disrupted by Cyclone Ditwah in late November 2025, which killed approximately 650 people and affected nearly 10% of the 22 million population, causing an estimated $4.1 billion in infrastructure damage according to the World Bank.

Experts predict a potential rate cut of around 1% in the upcoming meeting, supported by declining inflation indicators. The core inflation rate dropped to 11.8% in December 2025, down from 12.5% in November, while the annual urban inflation rate stabilized at 12.3%, reflecting the effectiveness of monetary policy in curbing price pressures. The central bank aims to bring inflation into the single-digit range (5%\u20139%) by the end of 2026. Mahmoud Nagele, CEO of fixed income and money markets at a financial investment firm, expects a gradual easing path, possibly starting with a 1% reduction, and notes the central bank may also use tools like lowering mandatory reserve requirements. Economist Mohamed Abdel Aal forecasts a total easing of up to 6% in 2026, supported by stable exchange rates and slowing inflation. However, some experts suggest a temporary pause in February to absorb potential seasonal inflation spikes in January data. Experts affirm that continued rate cuts will not undermine the attractiveness of Egyptian debt instruments, as real returns will remain positive, ensuring sustained foreign capital inflows of $40\u201350 billion, barring unexpected geopolitical shocks. Dr. Mostafa Badr, an economic expert, stated that Egypt\u2019s monetary policy is closely aligned with global trends, projecting interest rates to approach 14% by year-end. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 03:47 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/scenarios-central-bank-egypt-on-journeya-landing)\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Inflation Eases to 12.3% in November**\nEgypt's annual urban consumer inflation eased to 12.3% in November 2025, down from 12.5% in October, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). The decline followed a month-on-month drop in food prices, which fell by 2.6% despite a 0.7% annual increase. The inflation rate was lower than the median analyst forecast of 13.1% from a poll of 14 economists. Month-on-month, urban consumer prices rose by 0.3% in November. The annual inflation rate has significantly declined from a record high of 38% in September 2023, aided by an $8 billion financial support package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March 2024. Inflation has been driven by an expanding money supply, with M2 money supply growing by 21.68% annually in October.

The monthly inflation rate was 0.3%, a significant decrease from 1.8% in the previous month, primarily due to weak growth in food and beverage prices, which mitigated the impact of increases in other consumer basket items. This decline follows a record high of 38% in September 2023, driven by an $8 billion financial support package between the Egyptian government and the International Monetary Fund in March 2024. The slowdown in inflation prompted the Central Bank of Egypt to cut the overnight lending rate by 100 basis points in October and 200 basis points in August. The Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet on December 25 to review interest rates. Macro-economic experts predict that inflation will continue to slow in January 2026, approaching the Central Bank's target of 7% \u00b1 2% by the final quarter of 2026. Analysts also expect November's increase to be the last of the year, with the index set to trend downward toward the target. Supporting factors include sustained declines in food prices, a stable Egyptian pound exchange rate against the dollar, restored industrial production capacity, increased foreign exchange inflows, and lower financing costs.

This follows a meeting to review Egypt's $8 billion IMF-supported economic reform program, which began in March 2024 after a period of foreign currency shortages and soaring inflation. Inflation peaked at 38% in September 2023 but has since shown signs of moderation. The IMF team is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on 1 December 2025 for the combined fifth and sixth reviews of the program, critical for unlocking further loan tranches. Cabinet spokesperson Mohamed El-Homsani reported improvements in key economic indicators, including sustained inflation decline, reduced public debt, stronger tax revenues, and progress in tax policy reforms. Structural reforms include divestment from select sectors, enhanced public debt management, financial transparency, and alignment with the IMF\u2019s medium-term economic strategy. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) floated the Egyptian pound on 6 March 2025, a key IMF condition. The meeting also reviewed climate-related reforms under the NWFE (Nexus of Water, Food, and Energy) platform, launched during COP27 in 2022, which aims to accelerate Egypt\u2019s climate agenda and mobilize concessional financing. Investment incentives in manufacturing and energy have attracted new capital. Prime Minister Madbouly highlighted that Egypt recorded its highest primary surplus on record in the first quarter of the 2025/2026 fiscal year (July\u2013September), reaching EGP 179 billion\u2014nearly double the EGP 90 billion from the same period the previous year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 06:25 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645](https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/557186.aspx)\n\n**Economic Expert Predicts Interest Rate Hold in Next Central Bank Meeting**\nDr. Abd al-Mun'im al-Sayyid, Director of the Cairo Center for Economic and Strategic Studies, stated that current economic conditions place significant pressure on monetary policymakers, who must balance fighting inflation\u2014requiring higher interest rates\u2014with encouraging real investment and growth, which demands lower borrowing costs. He expects the Egyptian Central Bank to maintain interest rates at their current level in the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting, continuing its gradual easing cycle, with a planned reduction of 100 to 200 basis points in December 2025. This outlook is supported by recent improvements in key macroeconomic indicators: stability in the foreign exchange market, adherence to a flexible exchange rate regime since March 2024, progress in implementing the IMF program, reduced import restrictions limiting imported inflation, and Egypt\u2019s foreign exchange reserves rising above $50 billion for the first time. The central bank\u2019s gold reserves increased by $702 million in October, reaching $16.545 billion, placing Egypt 17th globally in gold purchases among central banks during the first nine months of 2025. This strengthens international confidence in Egypt\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, particularly amid global economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical risks. The expert noted this approach aligns with global trends, particularly the U.S.-led shift from peak monetary tightening to moderate easing, reducing risks from widening interest rate differentials between Egypt and global markets. Globally, the U.S. dollar accounts for 57.8% of central bank reserves, followed by the euro (19.8%), yen (5.8%), pound sterling (4.7%), and the Chinese yuan (2.2%).\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/8175941)\n\n**IMF Upgrades Egypt\u2019s Economic Outlook Amid Reform Progress and New Challenges**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its economic growth forecast for Egypt to 4.5%, citing progress in the 46-month, $8 billion reform program approved in March 2024. The adjustment follows a reduction in inflation expectations from 12.5% (April 2024) to 11.8% (October 2025), and a slight improvement in the Egyptian pound\u2019s exchange rate forecast\u2014projected at 51.48 EGP per USD in 2025 (down from 52.26), 54.05 in 2026 (down from 54.13), and 55.31 in 2027. This improvement reflects the success of structural reforms, including the disbursement of an additional $2 billion in the fourth review in March 2025. The forecast relies on sustained inflation reduction\u2014from 38% in September 2023 to 24.1% in December 2024\u2014and strong tourism revenues exceeding $15 billion in 2024. However, the IMF warns of a slight rise in the current account deficit to 4.3% of GDP in 2025 (up from 3.8%), driven by a 10% drop in oil imports due to regional tensions and a 20% decline in Suez Canal revenues in 2024 due to the Gaza conflict. The Egyptian Ministry of Finance confirms alignment with these projections, aiming to reduce the budget deficit to 4.5% through increased luxury taxes, expanded social spending, and expected interest rate cuts in Q1 2025 to boost private consumption, which accounts for 80% of total demand.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 08:27 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/business/1720763-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%87/)\n\n**IMF Expects Egypt's Inflation to Drop to 11.8% in 2025\u20132026**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced during a special press conference on global economic outlook on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, that inflation in Egypt is projected to reach 20.4% in the fiscal year 2024\u20132025, with a projected decline to 11.8% in the following fiscal year, 2025\u20132026. The annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, held in Washington, D.C., from October 13 to 18, 2025, featured a high-level Egyptian delegation including senior officials from the Central Bank of Egypt, the Ministries of Finance, Planning, International Cooperation, and Investment, as well as bank leaders and representatives from government, private sector, and media. The event included regional briefings, press conferences, and discussions on global economic trends, climate change, international development, and the global financial system. The IMF\u2019s Global Economic Outlook report, one of the key publications issued during the spring meetings, provides analysis and forecasts on economic developments in major country groups and individual nations, focusing on key economic policy issues and future economic prospects. The IMF and World Bank hold spring meetings in April and annual meetings in October each year, attracting central bank governors, finance ministers, development officials, private sector executives, civil society representatives, academics, media, and economic analysts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 01:07 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/14/%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B6%D8%AE%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-11-8/7156958)\n\n**Egypt\u2019s urban inflation slows to 12% in August, below expectations**\nEgypt\u2019s Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) released a press statement on September 10, 2025, reporting that the annual urban consumer inflation rate fell to 12% in August, down from 13.9% in July. The 12% figure is the lowest since March 2022, when inflation was 10.49%, and continues a three\u2011month easing trend. On a monthly basis, the headline consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.4% in August. CAPMAS noted that grain and bread prices rose 0.1%, household appliances increased 1.4%, medical products and equipment climbed 0.3%, while meat and poultry prices fell 1.3%, which helped offset some upward pressure.\n\nThe Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) had cut its overnight lending rate by 200 basis points on August 28, bringing total rate cuts for the year to 525 basis points. The CBE said the move was aimed at stimulating investment and economic activity after a prolonged period of monetary tightening to curb the country\u2019s record inflation wave. The bank expects inflation to average between 14\u201115% in 2025 before moving closer to its medium\u2011term target by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nAnalysts attribute the recent slowdown to several factors, most notably the $8\u202fbillion financing package signed with the IMF in March 2024, which helped stabilise markets, ease currency pressures, and reduce inflationary momentum. Despite the downward trend, the CBE cautions that global market volatility, import\u2011cost fluctuations, and risks tied to external financing could still test the resilience of the recovery. The latest figures, however, signal a gradual rebalancing between price stability and economic growth, giving policymakers more room to support investment and domestic demand.\n\nKey metrics: \n- Annual urban inflation: 12% in August (down from 13.9% in July). \n- Monthly CPI: \u20130.4% in August. \n- Grain & bread: +0.1%; household appliances: +1.4%; medical products: +0.3%; meat & poultry: \u20131.3%. \n- CBE rate cuts: 200 basis points on August 28, total 525 basis points for the year. \n- IMF package: $8\u202fbillion (March 2024). \n- CBE inflation outlook: 14\u201115% average in 2025.\n\nQuotes: \n- 'The figure came in below analyst forecasts, as apoll had projected inflation at 12.7%.' \n- 'The CBE said then that the move was aimed at stimulating investment and economic activity after a prolonged period of monetary tightening to curb the country\u2019s record inflation wave.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 07:21 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/egypt-s-urban-inflation-slows-to-12-in-august-below-expectations-400474/)\n\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
