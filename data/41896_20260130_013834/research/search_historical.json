Numerical backbone \u2013 Urban CPI YoY 2014-2025  \n   \u2022 Trading Economics explicitly exposes the whole history through its open \u201cguest\u201d API:  \n     https://api.tradingeconomics.com/inflation/country/egypt?c=guest:guest&d1=2014-01-01&d2=2025-12-31&f=csv.  \n     The indicator labelled \u201cInflation Rate\u201d in TE is the CAPMAS-published Urban CPI YoY series; the HTML page confirms the December-2025 YoY figure of 12.3 % (source: Trading Economics Egypt Inflation Rate page).  \n   \u2022 None of the search hits display the 144 individual monthly values, but the API call is documented and public, so a one-shot CSV download will yield the full table.  \n   \u2022 Spot-checking can be done with CAPMAS bulletins \u2013 e.g., the \u201cMonthly Bulletin of Consumer Price Index \u2013 Oct 2016\u201d (CAPMAS metadata catalogue) \u2013 to validate a few months.  \n\n   Remaining gap: the CSV itself still needs to be downloaded and pasted into the deliverable; the search results do not list the rows.\n\n2. CBE policy commentary (inflation notes & Monetary Policy Committee communiqu\u00e9s)  \n   \u2022 Isolated PDFs have surfaced: a July-2018 CPI press release mirrored on Enterprise Press and the December-2025 MPC decision located earlier (not in the current round).  \n   \u2022 The CBE site search returns 1 676 PDFs and reveals the repository path where Monetary Policy publications live (cbe.org.eg search-results page).  \n   \u2022 The \u201cMPC Meetings Schedule\u201d landing page shows that decisions are archived back to 2005 but the individual statement links are not enumerated in the HTML snippet provided (cbe.org.eg/en/monetary-policy/mpc-meetings-schedule).  \n   \u2022 A 2015-2016 CBE Annual Report PDF is now captured (annual-report-2015-2016.pdf) and certainly contains a narrative of inflation developments and policy actions for that fiscal year.  \n\n   Coverage assessment: we still lack the systematic monthly CPI press releases (\u224812 \u00d7 12 years) and the eight-times-a-year MPC statements for 2014-2024. A year-by-year \u201csite:cbe.org.eg CPI press release yyyy pdf\u201d scrape is still required.\n\n3. IMF inflation discussion  \n   \u2022 One IMF Country Report is confirmed \u2013 \u201cArab Republic of Egypt: 2021 Article IV Consultation and Second SBA Review\u201d (Ideas.Repec / EconBiz bibliographic record).  \n   \u2022 Reports for 2014-2018 (start of the Extended Fund Facility), 2019-2020 (SBA), and 2022-2025 (Post-Program Monitoring, Resilience & Sustainability Facility) are still missing.  \n   \u2022 No barrier other than retrieval remains: IMF.org hosts all Country Reports free of charge.\n\n4. Trading Economics news flow  \n   \u2022 The TE \u201cnews\u201d endpoint is documented:  \n     https://api.tradingeconomics.com/news?c=guest:guest&country=egypt&category=Inflation%20Rate&d1=2014-01-01&d2=2024-12-31&f=csv.  \n     Only two 2025 stories have been captured so far; 2014-2024 remain to be exported.  \n   \u2022 These news blurbs typically summarise each monthly CPI print and often quote CBE or ministerial remarks, covering the \u201cpolicy commentary from Trading Economics\u201d aspect of the user\u2019s request.\n\n5. Ancillary factual confirmations discovered this round  \n   \u2022 Producer-price and core-inflation pages on TE (core inflation rate, producer prices) reaffirm CAPMAS as primary source and demonstrate TE\u2019s data depth but do not change the Urban-CPI task.  \n   \u2022 World Bank inflation page and Brookings-Doha analysis of the 2016 IMF program surfaced but are background, not primary series.  \n\nConclusions on completeness relative to the user brief  \n\u2022 Numeric series: a guaranteed retrieval path exists via TE API, but the actual 144-row series has not yet been pasted into an answer \u2013 still missing.  \n\u2022 CBE commentary: proof-of-concept documents found; bulk of 2014-2024 PDFs still outstanding.  \n\u2022 IMF commentary: only the 2021 report is in hand; at least six more annual Article IV / program reviews are absent.  \n\u2022 TE news commentary: only 2025 covered; 2014-2024 to be exported.  \n\nTherefore, while the architecture for fulfilling the request is now fully mapped and all sources are publicly accessible, three substantive data-collection passes remain before a finished deliverable (numbers + stitched narrative) can be produced.</Agent_report>\n"
