- Grossi statements reinforce pattern of warnings about nuclear safety

**ANS Article (October 20, 2025):**

**Agent Report (Chronological Blackout List):**
- Attempts comprehensive reconstruction but acknowledges gaps
- Lists 6 blackouts from August 2022 to March 2023
- Durations range from <1 hour to ~15 hours
- Pattern shows both lines repeatedly damaged and restored
- Important limitation: Only covers through March 2023; missing 2024-2025 blackouts #7-9

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All complete blackouts at ZNPP during Russian occupation (2022-present):**
   - Most specific and relevant
   - Known: 10 blackouts from March 2022 to September 23, 2025 (~3.5 years)
   - Rate: ~2.86 blackouts per year or ~0.24 per month
   - Strengths: Directly applicable, same facility, same conflict conditions
   - Weaknesses: Small sample size, conditions may be changing

2. **Nuclear plants in active war zones:**
   - Too broad and insufficient historical data
   - No comparable modern precedent

3. **Critical infrastructure attacks in Russia-Ukraine war:**
   - Too general; doesn't capture nuclear-specific vulnerabilities
   - Different risk profiles

**Selected Reference Class:** Complete blackouts at ZNPP during Russian occupation (2022-present) is most suitable due to specificity and direct relevance.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From Agent Report (partial data through March 2023):
- Aug 25, 2022 → Sep 2, 2022: 8 days
- Sep 2, 2022 → Oct 9, 2022: 37 days
- Oct 9, 2022 → Oct 12, 2022: 3 days
- Oct 12, 2022 → Nov 23, 2022: 42 days
- Nov 23, 2022 → Mar 9, 2023: 106 days

From TIME/ANS articles:
- 10 total blackouts through September 23, 2025
- September 23, 2025 was the longest and most recent
- As of October 2025, repairs were initiated but situation remained "not sustainable"

**Key Observations:**
1. Blackouts cluster in time (3 in October 2022)
2. Gaps between blackouts vary widely (3 days to 106 days)
3. Average interval: ~127 days between blackouts (10 blackouts over ~1,260 days)
4. Recent trend (2025): Two blackouts mentioned (May 7 affecting 330 kV, September 23 affecting both lines)

**Current Status (as of Jan 30, 2026):**
- 129 days since the September 23, 2025 blackout
- Both power lines were out as of late September 2025
- Repairs were "underway" in mid-October 2025
- No source confirms successful restoration of external power
- This is critical: if external power hasn't been restored, we're still in the same blackout event

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:**

1. **Unresolved power situation:** The September 23, 2025 blackout was ongoing as of October 2025 reports. No source confirms restoration of the 750 kV or 330 kV lines by January 30, 2026.

2. **"Not sustainable" assessment:** IAEA Director Grossi repeatedly characterized the diesel generator reliance as unsustainable, suggesting high ongoing vulnerability.

3. **Historical frequency:** 10 blackouts in ~3.5 years = ~2.86 per year. For a 3-month period, base rate would be ~0.72 blackouts expected.

4. **Infrastructure degradation:** With only 2 of original 10 power lines remaining and repeated damage, the system is increasingly fragile.

5. **Ongoing conflict:** Active war zone with continued strikes on energy infrastructure (per Newsweek article on Chernobyl attacks).

6. **Strategic value:** TIME article notes Putin views the plant as a negotiating asset, suggesting continued military activity in the area.

**Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:**

1. **Recent repairs:** October 2025 reports indicated both sides agreed to allow repairs, with work underway.

2. **Potential restoration:** If external power was restored between October 2025 and January 30, 2026 (no confirmation either way), then a *new* blackout would be required.

3. **Diminishing returns:** Repeated attacks may have already achieved strategic objectives.

4. **International pressure:** IAEA presence and monitoring may deter some actions.

**Critical Uncertainty:**

The resolution criteria require "another" complete loss of external power "after the opening of this question." This implies external power must first be restored for a new blackout to count. However, **no source confirms restoration occurred** between the September 23, 2025 blackout and today (January 30, 2026).

If external power remains disconnected, the question cannot resolve "Yes" unless power is first restored and then lost again within the 91-day window.

Outside view calibration:

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- 10 blackouts over 1,260 days (March 2022 - September 2025) = 0.79% per day
- For 91 days: 1 - (0.9921)^91 = ~52% probability of at least one blackout

**Adjustments:**

1. **Current status uncertainty (+20%):** If power hasn't been restored, we need TWO events (restoration + new blackout) rather than one. However, repairs were reportedly underway, suggesting restoration is likely imminent or already occurred. The lack of reporting on restoration is concerning but may reflect limited media access.

2. **Increasing fragility (+10%):** Infrastructure degradation and the September 2025 event being the "longest" suggests worsening conditions.

3. **Repair progress (-15%):** October 2025 reports of bilateral agreement and active repairs suggest some improvement in the situation.

4. **Time-limited window (-5%):** Only 91 days vs. the ~127-day average interval between blackouts.

**Calibrated estimate:** 52% + 20% + 10% - 15% - 5% = 62%

However, this assumes power has been or will be restored. The critical question is: what's the probability that (a) power gets restored AND (b) another blackout occurs?

If we estimate:
- P(power restored by May 1) = 85% (given repair reports)
- P(blackout | power restored) = 60% (based on historical rate adjusted for fragility)
- P(another blackout) = 0.85 × 0.60 = 51%

Alternatively, if power is already restored (unreported), the 62% estimate applies directly.

Given uncertainty about current status and the need for conservative forecasting, I weight these scenarios:
- 40% chance power already restored → 62% probability applies
- 40% chance power restored soon → 51% probability applies  
- 20% chance power not restored by May 1 → 0% probability

Weighted: (0.40 × 0.62) + (0.40 × 0.51) + (0.20 × 0) = 0.248 + 0.204 = 45%

This seems too mechanistic. The fundamental question is whether the pattern of repeated infrastructure failure will continue. Given:
- 10 precedents in 3.5 years
- Ongoing conflict
- Fragile infrastructure
- But also recent repair efforts

A probability in the 45-55% range seems appropriate, reflecting genuine uncertainty about both current status and future events.
