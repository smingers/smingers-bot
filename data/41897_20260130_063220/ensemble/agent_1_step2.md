## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **External power WAS restored on January 19, 2026** (Multiple Russian sources - Kommersant, RT, Interfax, Izvestia all confirm "Ferrosplavna-1" line restoration): This is critical - it means the plant currently HAS external power, and the question asks about "another" loss
2. **Pattern of 10 complete blackouts in 3.5 years** (Multiple independent sources - TIME, ANS, NucNet, RFE/RL): Establishes clear historical frequency
3. **Backup line damaged January 2, 2026, repaired January 19, 2026** (Moscow Times, multiple sources): Shows 17-day vulnerability window just occurred
4. **Ongoing attacks on regional transmission infrastructure** (Meduza, multiple IAEA statements): Demonstrates continued threat to power grid

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **IAEA warning of "increasingly degraded and unstable" grid** (Grossi, December 23, 2025): Expert assessment of systemic vulnerability
2. **This is 4th IAEA-negotiated ceasefire for repairs** (Moscow Times): Shows pattern of repeated damage requiring international intervention
3. **Russian forces advancing toward Zaporizhzhia city** (Aif-Moscow, January 29): Increased military activity in region could affect infrastructure
4. **Plant operating on single restored line** (implied from sources): Still vulnerable to single-point failure

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Speculation about control negotiations** (various sources): Political factors uncertain
2. **General statements about nuclear safety risks** (various officials): Not specific to power loss probability

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **91 days (3 months)**

**Current Status**: External power was restored on January 19, 2026 (11 days ago), so the plant currently has power via the Ferrosplavna-1 line.

**Historical Rate Analysis**:
- 10 blackouts over ~1,260 days (March 2022 - September 2025) = 0.79% daily probability
- For 91 days: 1 - (0.9921)^91 = **52% base probability**
- Average interval between blackouts: ~127 days
- Our 91-day window is 72% of average interval

**Recent Pattern (2025)**:
- 330 kV line lost: ~April-May 2025
- 750 kV line lost: September 23, 2025 (~140 days later)
- Both lines out: September 23 - January 19 (~118 days)
- Current status: Single line operational (Ferrosplavna-1, which is likely the 330 kV line)

**If timeframe halved (45 days)**: Probability would drop to ~30% (less than half the average interval)

**If timeframe doubled (182 days)**: Probability would increase to ~78% (exceeds average interval, making at least one event highly likely)

## (d) Justification

**Factors Increasing Probability from Base Rate:**

1. **Single-line vulnerability (+15%)**: Plant is operating on only one restored line (Ferrosplavna-1), not both the 750 kV and 330 kV lines. The resolution criteria require loss of "all external power lines" - currently only one line is operational, making complete loss easier to achieve.

2. **Recent damage pattern (+10%)**: The backup line was just damaged on January 2, 2026 and required 17 days plus international ceasefire to repair. This shows active, recent targeting of ZNPP power infrastructure.

3. **Regional infrastructure attacks (+8%)**: Meduza reports ongoing systematic attacks on transmission substations in the Zaporizhzhia region throughout January 2026, demonstrating continued threat to the power grid feeding ZNPP.

4. **IAEA "degraded and unstable" assessment (+7%)**: Expert characterization from December 2025 suggests systemic fragility beyond historical norms.

**Factors Decreasing Probability from Base Rate:**

1. **Recent restoration and repair focus (-10%)**: The January 19 restoration involved international coordination and ceasefire. Both sides may have incentive to maintain power for near-term stability, especially with IAEA attention.

2. **Year-long repair campaign underway (-5%)**: Russian sources report comprehensive maintenance program starting, suggesting operational focus rather than continued degradation.

3. **Political attention (-5%)**: Emergency IAEA Board meeting on January 30 and increased international scrutiny may temporarily reduce attacks on nuclear infrastructure.

**Net Adjustment**: +15% + 10% + 8% + 7% - 10% - 5% - 5% = **+20%**

**Calibrated Probability**: 52% (base rate) + 20% = **72%**

However, this seems high given that we need a complete failure within just 91 days after recent restoration. Let me reconsider:

The base rate of 52% for 91 days assumes random distribution of events. But:
- We just had a restoration 11 days ago
- Repairs typically hold for some period
- The average interval is 127 days, and we're only forecasting 91 days

A more nuanced view: The probability should be lower in the immediate aftermath of restoration, then increase over time. Given we're 11 days into a 91-day window:
- Days 1-30: Lower risk (fresh repairs) → ~30% probability
- Days 31-91: Higher risk (approaching historical interval) → ~70% probability
- Weighted average considering we're already 11 days in: ~55%

Adding the adjustment factors (+20% for current vulnerabilities), I arrive at: **55% + 15% = 70%**

But this still feels aggressive. The critical insight is that **only one line is currently operational**, making the threshold for "complete loss" lower than historical average (when sometimes 2 lines were available). This genuinely increases risk.

Final calibration considering:
- Base rate: 52% for 91 days
- Single-line vulnerability: significant increase
- Recent restoration: modest decrease
- Ongoing regional attacks: moderate increase

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 52% base rate for 91 days:
- +18% for single-line vulnerability (easier to lose all power with only 1 line vs 2)
- +10% for demonstrated January 2026 targeting pattern
- +5% for regional infrastructure attacks
- -8% for recent restoration and repair focus
- -5% for increased international attention

**Calibrated Inside View: 52% + 18% + 10% + 5% - 8% - 5% = 72%**

This aligns with 72 out of 100 similar 91-day periods experiencing at least one complete blackout given current conditions. Given the single-line vulnerability is a structural change from historical conditions, this upward adjustment from the base rate seems justified.

However, considering forecasting humility and the recent restoration, I'll moderate slightly to **68%** to account for uncertainty about the effectiveness of recent repairs and potential deterrent effect of international attention.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will ZNPP lose all external power lines simultaneously before May 1, 2026 (91 days from now)?

2. **Base rate alignment**: 52% base rate for 91 days from historical pattern of 10 blackouts in 3.5 years. Final prediction (68%) is moderately higher due to structural vulnerability (single line operational vs historical 2 lines).

3. **Consistency check**: "68 out of 100 times in similar 91-day periods with single-line operation and recent regional attacks, ZNPP loses all external power." This seems reasonable given historical frequency and current vulnerability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - External power restored January 19, 2026 via single line (Ferrosplavna-1)
   - 10 historical blackouts over 3.5 years (52% base rate for 91 days)
   - Backup line was damaged January 2, 2026, showing recent targeting
   - Plant operating on single line only, not both original lines
   - Ongoing attacks on Zaporizhzhia region transmission infrastructure

5. **Blind spot**: If international pressure from the January 30 IAEA emergency meeting leads to a genuine de-escalation or protection zone around ZNPP, the probability could be significantly lower (perhaps 35-40%). Also, if the 750 kV line is quietly restored without media coverage, having two lines operational would reduce vulnerability.

6. **Status quo**: Current status is "power connected via single line after recent restoration." The volatile recent pattern (damage January 2, restoration January 19) suggests this is NOT a stable equilibrium. The 91-day window is long enough for patterns to reassert, supporting a probability above 50%.

Probability: 68%
