Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**BBC (November 2022):**
Provides foundational context on the plant's specifications and early power incidents. Key facts: Plant has 6 reactors, built with 1.75m reinforced concrete containment, originally had 4 power lines reduced to 1 by late August 2022. The August 25, 2022 incident represents the first documented complete loss of external power. Expert opinions from Mark Wenman, Claire Corkhill, and Iztok Tiselj provide technical risk assessments but are dated. Factual content is reliable; expert opinions reflect 2022 understanding.

**AP News (October 1, 2025):**
High-quality contemporaneous reporting. Key facts: September 23, 2025 blackout is the longest since the war began and the plant's 10th complete blackout overall. Plant operating on 8 diesel generators with 9 on standby and 3 under maintenance. Fuel reserves expected to last >10 days with ongoing resupply. Rafael Grossi (IAEA) confirms conditions stable but "clearly not a sustainable situation." This is factual reporting with expert opinion from the most authoritative source (IAEA Director).

**TIME (October 23, 2025):**
In-depth feature article. Confirms the September 23, 2025 blackout as the "10th blackout" since Russian takeover. States Putin knows technical details "very precisely" (Grossi's assessment). By October 18, 2025, repairs were underway with "some light at the end of the tunnel." Contains both factual reporting and strategic analysis. Grossi's statements are authoritative expert opinion.

**Stimson Center (August 4, 2025):**
Brief mention characterizing the situation as "fragile" in July 2025. Limited specific information but from a credible nuclear policy think tank. Minimal factual content for this analysis.

**Newsweek (undated, appears recent):**
Focuses on Chernobyl power loss, not Zaporizhzhia. Mentions Zaporizhzhia only as "under Russian occupation and not operational." Limited relevance to the specific question. Contains factual reporting on Chernobyl and expert opinion from Grossi on general nuclear safety concerns.

**ANS (October 20, 2025):**
Technical publication from American Nuclear Society. Key facts: September 23 blackout was the 10th complete loss and the longest during the conflict. Plant reduced from 10 power lines pre-war to 2 lines in recent years. 330 kV line lost May 7, 2025; 750 kV line lost September 23, 2025. Currently 7 EDGs producing electricity, 13 in standby. Grossi states situation "not sustainable" but repairs indicated by both sides. High-quality technical source with authoritative expert opinion.

**Agent Report:**
Attempts chronological reconstruction of all blackouts 2022-2026. Lists 6 documented complete blackouts from August 2022 through March 2023:
1. Aug 25, 2022 (temporary, same day)
2. Sep 2, 2022 (4-5 hours)
3. Oct 9, 2022 (~8 hours)
4. Oct 12, 2022 (<1 hour)
5. Nov 23, 2022 (~15 hours)
6. Mar 9, 2023 (11 hours)

The report acknowledges gaps and incomplete retrieval of IAEA updates. However, it only lists 6 events through March 2023, while other sources confirm 10 total blackouts by September 2025, indicating 4 additional blackouts occurred between March 2023 and September 2025 that are not documented in the agent report.

**Factual Synthesis:**
- Confirmed complete blackouts: At least 10 as of September 23, 2025
- Current status (as of late October 2025): Both 750 kV and 330 kV lines are down; plant on diesel generators
- Repairs underway as of mid-October 2025
- Historical pattern: 6 documented blackouts in first 7 months of occupation (Aug 2022 - Mar 2023), then 4 more over next 30 months (Mar 2023 - Sep 2025)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Historical blackout frequency at ZNPP during Russian occupation (March 2022 - September 2025)**
   - Period: ~42 months
   - Events: 10 complete blackouts
   - Rate: ~0.24 blackouts/month or ~2.9 blackouts/year
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most directly relevant, same facility, same conflict conditions

2. **Nuclear plants in active war zones globally**
   - Extremely limited historical precedent
   - Suitability: LOW - Insufficient comparable data

3. **Blackout frequency in recent period (2024-2025) vs. early occupation (2022-2023)**
   - Early period (Aug 2022 - Mar 2023, ~7 months): 6 blackouts = 0.86/month
   - Later period (Mar 2023 - Sep 2025, ~30 months): 4 blackouts = 0.13/month
   - Suitability: MEDIUM-HIGH - Shows declining frequency, possibly due to adaptation or changing conflict dynamics

**Selected Reference Class:** Historical blackout frequency at ZNPP during Russian occupation, with attention to the declining trend over time.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 91 days (~3 months)

**Historical Patterns:**

*Early occupation phase (Aug 2022 - Mar 2023, 7 months):*
- 6 complete blackouts
- Average interval: ~35 days between events
- Causes: Active shelling, grid instability from nationwide strikes

*Middle/late phase (Mar 2023 - Sep 2025, 30 months):*
- 4 complete blackouts  
- Average interval: ~7.5 months (225 days) between events
- Declining frequency suggests either: (a) improved protective measures, (b) reduced active combat near the plant, (c) more stable grid management, or (d) strategic decisions to avoid escalation

*Current situation (as of Jan 30, 2026):*
- Last blackout: September 23, 2025 (129 days ago)
- Status: Repairs underway as of mid-October 2025, suggesting external power may have been restored between October 2025 and January 2026
- Both 750 kV and 330 kV lines were down as of October 2025

**Critical Unknown:** Whether external power has been restored between October 2025 and January 30, 2026. The question states "after the opening of this question" suggesting the plant currently has external power (otherwise it would already be in blackout and the question would be moot).

**Pattern Analysis for 3-month window:**
- Early phase rate: 0.86 blackouts/month × 3 months = 2.58 expected events
- Later phase rate: 0.13 blackouts/month × 3 months = 0.39 expected events
- Overall rate: 0.24 blackouts/month × 3 months = 0.72 expected events

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Lower Probability:**

1. **Declining trend:** Blackout frequency decreased significantly after March 2023, from 0.86/month to 0.13/month, suggesting adaptation and improved stability.

2. **Recent repair efforts:** Multiple sources confirm repairs were underway in October 2025, with Grossi noting "light at the end of the tunnel" and both sides agreeing to restoration.

3. **Increased international attention:** The September 2025 blackout being the longest prompted significant diplomatic attention, potentially creating incentives to avoid repetition.

4. **Time since last event:** If power was restored by November 2025, the plant would have maintained external power for ~3 months by the end of the forecast period, consistent with recent historical patterns.

5. **Technical improvements:** The plant has adapted to operate with reduced external connections and has robust diesel backup systems with fuel reserves.

**Factors Supporting Higher Probability:**

1. **Active war zone:** The facility remains in an active combat zone with ongoing military operations. The ANS article notes "military activities continue at various distances from the site."

2. **Infrastructure vulnerability:** The plant is down to only 2 power lines (from 10 pre-war), making it inherently more vulnerable to any disruption.

3. **Precedent for repeated events:** 10 blackouts over 42 months demonstrates persistent vulnerability despite adaptations.

4. **Strategic targeting:** Sources indicate both sides have engaged in strikes on energy infrastructure. The Newsweek article documents large-scale strikes on Ukrainian electrical substations.

5. **"Not sustainable" assessment:** Grossi's repeated characterization of the diesel generator situation as "not sustainable" suggests ongoing fragility.

6. **Recent major blackout:** The September 2025 event was the longest and most serious, potentially indicating escalating rather than declining risk.

**Integration:**

The base rate from the later occupation period (0.13 blackouts/month) suggests a 13% probability per month, or approximately 34% over 3 months using simple multiplication (though this assumes independence). However, the Poisson distribution is more appropriate for rare events:

P(≥1 event in 3 months) = 1 - P(0 events) = 1 - e^(-λt)
Where λ = 0.13 blackouts/month, t = 3 months
P(≥1) = 1 - e^(-0.39) = 1 - 0.677 = 32.3%

However, this calculation assumes the recent declining trend continues. Key adjustments:

- **Positive adjustment:** The September 2025 blackout and subsequent repairs may have improved resilience, and the long duration may have prompted enhanced protective measures.
- **Negative adjustment:** The ongoing war, strategic importance of energy infrastructure, and "fragile" characterization suggest continued vulnerability.
- **Uncertainty adjustment:** We don't know current power status definitively, though the question's framing suggests power is currently connected.

The historical base rate of ~32% appears reasonable, but given the declining trend and recent repair efforts, a modest downward adjustment is warranted. Conversely, the "not sustainable" characterization and active war zone status prevent too aggressive a reduction.

## Outside view calibration:

The most relevant anchor is the later-period blackout rate (post-March 2023) of 0.13/month, yielding ~32% probability over 3 months via Poisson distribution. This figure:

1. **Accounts for adaptation:** Uses the more recent, lower rate rather than the early high-intensity period
2. **Reflects actual conditions:** Based on same facility, same conflict, similar timeframe
3. **Is empirically grounded:** Derived from 4 events over 30 months

**Calibration considerations:**

- The 32% figure assumes conditions similar to March 2023 - September 2025 period
- Recent repair efforts and the severity of the September 2025 event may have prompted additional protective measures, suggesting lower risk
- However, the war continues with no indication of de-escalation, maintaining baseline vulnerability
- The question asks about "another" complete loss, implying external power is currently connected (otherwise there would be nothing to lose)

**Probability calibration:**
- 32% base rate from recent historical period
- -5% adjustment for recent repair efforts and heightened attention post-September 2025
- +3% adjustment for ongoing war conditions and infrastructure vulnerability
- Net: 30%

This represents roughly 3:7 odds, meaning in 10 similar scenarios, we'd expect ~3 to experience another complete blackout in a 3-month window. This feels appropriately calibrated to the evidence: more likely than not to avoid blackout (reflecting improvements), but with substantial risk remaining (reflecting ongoing war and infrastructure fragility).
