**Current News (Jan 29-30, 2026):**

7. **IAEA Board Meeting (Jan 30, 2026 - multiple sources)**: 13 countries convened emergency meeting citing "growing concern" over nuclear safety. Netherlands' Potman references Dec 23 Grossi statement that grid is "increasingly degraded and unstable." Chernobyl lost power last week. ZNPP backup line damaged early January, repaired Jan 19 under ceasefire. **Strong evidence**: Multiple independent sources (AFP, FMT) confirm same facts; IAEA institutional assessment.

8. **Repair Campaign Reports (Jan 29, 2026 - Russian sources)**: Kommersant, RT, Interfax report year-long 2026 repair campaign beginning at ZNPP. First-time involvement of external specialists for diesel generator overhauls. Work under IAEA supervision. Power restored Jan 19 via "Ferrosplavna-1" line. **Moderate evidence**: Single-source cluster (Russian state media) but corroborated by IAEA ceasefire announcement.

9. **Military Context (Jan 29, 2026)**: Aif-Moscow reports Russian forces 12-14 km from Zaporizhzhia city, advancing toward Orikhiv. **Weak-to-moderate evidence**: Single military analysis; relevant for assessing continued combat pressure near transmission infrastructure.

10. **Izvestia (Jan 29, 2026)**: Reports IAEA expert rotation expected in February. Notes attacks resumed after Jan 19 repairs (drone strike Jan 24). **Moderate evidence**: Indicates ceasefire was temporary, military activity ongoing.

11. **Historical IAEA Reports (Oct 2025)**: Multiple sources confirm Sep 23, 2025 blackout was longest complete loss during conflict. Repairs began mid-October with both sides cooperating. **Strong evidence**: Consistent across multiple IAEA statements.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large Impact):**

1. **Power restored Jan 19, 2026 after 4-month blackout**: The "Ferrosplavna-1" backup line was successfully repaired under IAEA-brokered ceasefire. This directly addresses the Sep 23, 2025 blackout that lasted until mid-January. Plant now has external power again.
   - *Direction*: Significantly reduces immediate blackout risk
   - *Weight*: Multiple independent confirmations (IAEA, Moscow Times, Russian technical sources)

2. **Grid infrastructure "increasingly degraded and unstable" per IAEA DG (Dec 23)**: Grossi's institutional assessment that Ukrainian grid is deteriorating, cited by 13 countries in emergency board request. Chernobyl lost power last week (late Jan 2026).
   - *Direction*: Increases systemic blackout risk
   - *Weight*: Official IAEA position; demonstrated by recent Chernobyl incident

3. **Military activity resumed after temporary ceasefire**: Izvestia reports attacks continued after Jan 19 repairs, including Jan 24 drone strike. Russian forces advancing 12-14 km from Zaporizhzhia city.
   - *Direction*: Increases risk of line damage
   - *Weight*: Multiple sources; consistent with 38-month pattern of combat near site

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Year-long repair campaign with diesel generator overhauls**: First-time major maintenance of emergency backup systems under IAEA supervision. Indicates focus on resilience.
   - *Direction*: Slightly reduces risk of prolonged blackout (better backup systems)
   - *Weight*: Single-source cluster but technically detailed

5. **Only 1-2 transmission lines remain operational**: Plant depends on fragile infrastructure. Loss of single line = complete blackout.
   - *Direction*: Maintains high structural vulnerability
   - *Weight*: Confirmed across all technical sources since 2022

6. **Forecast window includes late winter/early spring**: Historical pattern shows major grid attacks in deep winter (Nov-Mar). Window ends May 1, potentially capturing tail end of winter campaign season.
   - *Direction*: Moderate risk period
   - *Weight*: Historical pattern from 2022-2025

**Weak Evidence:**

7. **Potential diplomatic discussions on ZNPP control**: Vague references to Abu Dhabi talks; no concrete agreements.
   - *Direction*: Uncertain
   - *Weight*: Highly speculative

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast Window**: Jan 30, 2026 → May 1, 2026 = **91 days / ~3.0 months**

**If halved to 1.5 months (mid-March)**:
- Would miss potential late-winter grid strikes (historically March has seen attacks)
- Recent Jan 19 repair would have less time to fail
- Probability would decrease to ~35-40%

**If doubled to 6 months (through July)**:
- Would capture entire spring thaw period when military operations typically intensify
- More time for transmission line damage from accumulated military activity
- Summer months (May-July) historically have lower grid attack frequency but higher combat intensity near front lines
- Probability would increase to ~70-75%

**Key temporal factors**:
- Jan 19 repair is only 11 days old as of forecast opening
- 91-day window represents ~3.6 average inter-blackout periods (based on 25-day historic average)
- Window includes remainder of winter strike season (Feb-Mar) plus spring transition

## (d) Justification & Shift from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate**: 58% (10 blackouts over 25 months = 0.40/month × 3 months, adjusted for recent 4-month lull)

**Current Factors Requiring Adjustment**:

**Downward Pressure (-15 to -20 pp):**

1. **Jan 19 power restoration is game-changing**: Unlike previous blackouts that resolved within hours/days, the Sep 2025 blackout lasted 4 months. The successful repair under IAEA ceasefire represents a material change in the plant's power status. The base rate calculation included this 4-month period as a "single blackout," but it was actually an ongoing crisis that is now resolved. This fundamentally changes the starting conditions.

2. **Institutional focus on ZNPP safety**: The Jan 30 IAEA Board meeting with 13 countries signals unprecedented diplomatic attention. While this doesn't prevent line damage, it increases pressure for protective measures and rapid repair response.

3. **Repair campaign improving backup resilience**: First-time overhaul of diesel generators reduces consequence severity if blackout occurs (though doesn't prevent it).

**Upward Pressure (+10 to +15 pp):**

1. **Grid systemically more fragile**: IAEA's Dec 23 assessment that Ukrainian grid is "increasingly degraded and unstable" is new information post-dating the outside view analysis. Chernobyl's late-January blackout demonstrates this isn't theoretical. The Meduza analysis details substation vulnerability affecting electricity transmission to ZNPP.

2. **Military activity ongoing and intensifying**: Russian forces 12-14 km from Zaporizhzhia city; attacks resumed immediately after Jan 19 ceasefire. The temporary nature of ceasefires means repair gains can be quickly reversed.

3. **Structural vulnerability unchanged**: Still only 1-2 lines; any single line failure = complete blackout. The fundamental fragility that caused 10 previous blackouts remains.

4. **Winter strike season continues through March**: The forecast window captures Feb-March, historically high-risk months for grid attacks.

**Net Adjustment**: The Jan 19 power restoration is a major positive development that wasn't reflected in the outside view (which counted through Sep 2025 data). However, the IAEA's assessment of worsening grid stability and demonstrated Chernobyl incident partially offset this. The military pressure remains constant.

**Calibrated Probability**: 
- Start: 58% (outside view)
- Subtract 15% for Jan 19 restoration and current power status: 43%
- Add 8% for grid degradation and ongoing military pressure: 51%
- Slight downward adjustment (-3%) for institutional attention and backup improvements: 48%

The ~10 pp downward shift from the outside view is justified because:
1. The plant currently HAS external power (as of Jan 19), whereas the outside view calculation included the 4-month blackout period
2. The immediate post-repair period (11 days) has lower failure probability than the long-term average
3. However, the systemic factors (grid instability, military activity, structural vulnerability) prevent a larger decrease

## Probability Calibration

My outside view established a 58% baseline based on historic frequency (10 blackouts/25 months). The most significant new information is that external power was restored on January 19, 2026, just 11 days ago, ending a 4-month blackout. This materially improves the plant's immediate status compared to the outside view calculation period.

However, three factors prevent a dramatic downward revision:

1. **Grid instability is worsening**: The IAEA Director General's December 23 assessment that Ukraine's power grid is "increasingly degraded and unstable" represents institutional expert judgment. This was validated by Chernobyl's power loss in late January. The Meduza analysis detailing substation vulnerability shows the transmission infrastructure ZNPP depends on is under severe stress.

2. **Military pressure persists**: Attacks resumed immediately after the January 19 ceasefire. Russian forces are reportedly 12-14 km from Zaporizhzhia city. The 38-month pattern of combat near transmission infrastructure continues unchanged.

3. **Structural fragility remains**: The plant still operates with only 1-2 external lines. Any single line failure produces a complete blackout. This hasn't improved since 2022.

The January 19 repair justifies a ~10 percentage point decrease from the 58% base rate (to ~48%), but not more, because:
- The repair is very recent (11 days old); vulnerability to re-damage is high
- The forecast window is 3 months, giving substantial time for line damage
- The systemic factors (grid degradation, military activity) that caused previous blackouts remain active

A 48% probability means "slightly less likely than not" - reflecting that while the plant currently has power and recent repairs help, the combination of grid instability, ongoing combat, and structural vulnerability makes another blackout a near-even proposition over 3 months.

**Sensitivity check**: 
- At 38% (10 pp lower): Would require believing the Jan 19 repair fundamentally changed the risk environment, which contradicts the resumed military activity and IAEA grid assessment
- At 58% (no change): Would ignore the material fact that power was just restored and plant is no longer in blackout
- At 48%: Balances the positive development (current power) against unchanged systemic risks

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will ZNPP lose all external power lines simultaneously before May 1, 2026 (91-day window from Jan 30)?
   - ✓ Analysis focuses on complete blackout risk, not partial outages

2. **Base rate**: 58% from outside view (10 blackouts/25 months, adjusted for recent lull)
   - ✓ Final 48% represents 10pp decrease, justified by Jan 19 power restoration but constrained by systemic risks

3. **Consistency**: "48 out of 100 times, ZNPP experiences complete external power loss in a 3-month period starting with restored power but facing grid instability and ongoing military pressure."
   - ✓ Aligns with near-even odds given current mixed conditions

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Power restored Jan 19 (11 days ago) - verified by multiple sources
   - IAEA assessment: Ukrainian grid "increasingly degraded/unstable" (Dec 23) - official institutional statement
   - Military activity resumed post-ceasefire; forces 12-14km from city - multiple reports
   - Chernobyl blackout late January demonstrates grid vulnerability - confirmed
   - Only 1-2 lines remain; structural fragility unchanged - technical consensus

5. **Blind spot**: A major Russian offensive targeting Ukrainian grid infrastructure in February-March (similar to winter 2022-2023 campaigns) could cause widespread blackouts including ZNPP. This would make 48% look too optimistic. Conversely, an unexpected ceasefire or demilitarization agreement would make it look too pessimistic.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is "plant has external power as of 11 days ago." Given 91-day window and historical 25-day average between blackouts, maintaining current power status for full period is plausible but not highly likely. 48% reflects meaningful chance of status quo persisting while acknowledging substantial risk.

Probability: 48%
