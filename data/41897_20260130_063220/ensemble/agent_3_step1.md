Analysis:
We begin by reviewing the sources and the historical chronology provided. The Agent Report reconstructs, in chronological order, at least six distinct events (from as early as August 2022 through March 2023) in which the plant experienced a full blackout—defined as the simultaneous loss of both the 750 kV and 330 kV lines. Although the reconstruction is not perfectly complete and some gaps remain (for example, precise durations and exact technical details in certain cases are inferred from IAEA updates or mainstream reporting), it does provide a picture of repeated events under conflict stress. Mainstream sources—the BBC, AP News, TIME, Stimson Center, and Newsweek—support the general background that the Zaporizhzhia facility has repeatedly lost external power due to shelling, missile strikes, or related disruptions. The AP piece in October 2025, for instance, describes a severe outage beginning on 23 September 2025 (with the plant running on diesel backup), highlighting that even in recent months incidents continue to occur.

In terms of source quality, the international media and IAEA director comments are credible and fact‐checked; they separate factual event reporting (the outage dates, durations, cause descriptions) from opinion (analysis of risk, assessments of sustainability of diesel backup). The Agent Report, while a reconstruction and somewhat incomplete compared to official IAEA bulletins, still aggregates widely reported incidents. We have enough data points to identify a reference class: namely, “complete loss of external power incidents at a nuclear facility operating in an active conflict zone” (in this case, Zaporizhzhia). Historically, over a period of about three to four years since the start of the conflict, there have been roughly 6–10 such complete outages, translating to an average frequency on the order of one incident every 4–6 months. This reference class is highly suitable because it directly features the same operational, technical, and conflict-related risk factors as the forecasting question.

Timeframe analysis is critical. The forecasting window now is from today (January 30, 2026) until May 1, 2026—a period of about 3 months. In earlier parts of the conflict, incidents were more frequent (often clustered in periods of intense fighting or when repairs had not yet been stabilized). More recently, as seen in October 2025, there has been an effort at repairs and restoration. However, the plant remains in an active conflict zone with ongoing risks (including shelling and operational challenges with backup systems). In addition, while winter months sometimes see a dip in military operations due to weather, in this instance the strategic importance of the plant means that political and military dynamics can override seasonal calm. Therefore, even though repair efforts might lower the expected frequency somewhat from the historical average, the inherent risk factors remain significant.

Justification for the outside view prediction comes from integrating the historical frequency (e.g., roughly one outage every 4–6 months) with the current situation: it has been nearly four years of conflict, the plant’s infrastructure remains vulnerable, and recent reports confirm that backup systems are stressed and repairs are ongoing. Although efforts to restore and stabilize the plant’s power supply exist, the combination of repeated past events and persistent conflict dynamics leads us to judge that over a short 3‐month period, the risk of another complete loss of external power remains materially high. 

Outside view calibration:
From the historical record, complete blackouts have occurred many times (estimated 6–10 events over ~3.5 years under conflict). This approximates to about 1–2 events per year. Since the forecasting window is roughly one quarter of a year (3 months), if we were to simply “scale” the frequency from the past, the pure historical base rate might indicate about a 25–35% chance. However, there are extenuating factors:
 • The most recent event in late September 2025 was one of the more severe outages, and it has triggered intensified attention from the IAEA and repair efforts.
 • The technical vulnerabilities and the dynamics of conflict remain largely unchanged.
 • Conversely, repair and restoration efforts may have slightly lowered the risk.
Balancing these factors, and considering that even with partial improvements the underlying conflict risk persists, the overall calibrated estimate edges upward moderately from the simple scaling of historical frequency. We arrive at a calibrated probability in the upper “tens” – roughly around 45–50% chance.

Outside View Prediction:
Based on the above reasoning and calibration, the outside view prediction is:
Approximately a 47% chance that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will experience another complete loss of external power (simultaneous loss of both the 750 kV and 330 kV lines) before May 1, 2026.
