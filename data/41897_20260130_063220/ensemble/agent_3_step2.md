Analysis:
1. Source analysis:
   • The Moscow Times (Jan 17, 2026) reports that a localized ceasefire was agreed to repair the damaged backup power line; this account comes from AFP/IAEA and is recent and reliable.
   • ANS (Oct 20, 2025) documents that the plant had its 10th complete blackout on September 23, 2025, and details its reduced power line status and diesel backup operations; technical and expert-sourced.
   • Meduza (Jan 19, 2026) highlights the stresses on Ukraine’s grid amid military attacks, reinforcing the context of ongoing fragility near the plant.
   • RFERL (Oct 1, 2025) describes the September 23 blackout incident, including generator failures and urgent nuclear safety warnings from Grossi and Zelenskyy.
   • United24Media (Aug 7, 2025) focuses on military activities around the plant and expresses concerns over nuclear safety amid repeated disruptions.
   • The Asknews articles (January 2026) include multiple IAEA board meetings, repair campaign updates, and expert commentary (e.g., Grossi’s statements) detailing the critical condition of power lines, recent repairs, and sustained risk due to conflict.
   Overall, the sources are recent, come from reliable organizations (IAEA, AFP, ANS, Interfax, etc.), and provide a mix of factual reports (dates and technical details) and expert opinions. Factual details (e.g., blackout dates, repair actions, power line status) are clearly distinguished from opinions urging caution.

2. Evidence analysis:
   – Strong evidence: Multiple IAEA reports and AFP/Interfax updates confirm the severe and repetitive blackout events (10 blackouts to date, with the last major event on September 23, 2025) and emphasize the degradation of external power connectivity. These sources establish the historical pattern and the facility’s structural vulnerability.
   – Moderate evidence: Recent ceasefires and repair campaigns (Moscow Times, Kommersant.ru, Izvestia.ru) indicate that steps are being taken to restore power. Their impact is moderate because despite repairs, the conflict remains active.
   – Weak evidence: Anecdotal information about isolated missile or drone strikes (Meduza) that hint at transient disruptions but do not alone move the overall risk much.
   
3. Timeframe analysis:
   – Prediction timeframe: January 30, 2026 to May 1, 2026 (approximately 3 months).
   – If the timeframe were halved (1.5 months), the probability of another complete blackout would roughly be halved (given a Poisson-like process from recent historical rates). If doubled (6 months), the cumulative risk would increase proportionally. Our prediction is thus sensitive to the duration of exposure.
   
4. Justification:
   – Historical rate during the later phase (from March 2023 to September 2025) averages about 0.13 blackouts/month; over 3 months this gives about a 32% chance (using a Poisson calculation: P(≥1)=1–e^(–0.39) ≈ 32%).
   – Recent repair efforts and the agreed ceasefire to restore the damaged power line likely reduce risk slightly, while ongoing military activities and inherent infrastructure vulnerability act in the opposite direction.
   – Balancing these factors, a modest downward adjustment of about 2 percentage points (from ~32%) is justified, resulting in an inside view probability near 30%.
   – In sum, the strong structural risk remains but recent interventions suggest a slightly lower chance than historical averages would imply.

Probability calibration:
Using the latest evidence, the outside view base rate from the recent period (0.13 events/month) gives roughly a 32% chance over 3 months. Adjusting modestly downward for intensive repair efforts and heightened international oversight but not too far due to persistent war conditions yields an inside view prediction of about 30%. This means that in 100 similar three‐month periods, we estimate that approximately 30 would see a complete loss of external power at Zaporizhzhia.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Zaporizhzhia experience another simultaneous loss of its remaining external power lines (750 kV and 330 kV) before May 1, 2026?
2. Base rate: From historical data, recent period average ~0.13/month → ~32% in 3 months.
3. Consistency check: "30 out of 100 times, a complete loss of external power occurs before May 1, 2026."
4. Key evidence: (i) IAEA and AFP confirmations of multiple past blackouts; (ii) recent repair and ceasefire efforts; (iii) the active conflict environment; (iv) the structural vulnerability from reduced power lines.
5. Blind-spot: A sudden escalation in military targeting the power infrastructure unexpectedly could significantly raise the probability.
6. Status quo outcome: Given ongoing slow changes and repair measures, it’s plausible that the current conditions persist with moderate risk.

Probability: 30%
