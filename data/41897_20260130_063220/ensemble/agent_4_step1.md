Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. BBC, 21 Nov 2022 – Factual recap of first months of Russian occupation plus expert commentary on general safety mechanisms.  Reliability: high for factual timeline of 2022 events; opinion pieces clearly attributed to named academics.  
2. AP, 1 Oct 2025 – Straight-news wire giving hard data on the 10th blackout that began 23 Sep 2025; quotes IAEA and Ukrainian officials.  Reliability: very high.  
3. TIME, 23 Oct 2025 – Long-form magazine piece; mixes narrative, quotes from IAEA DG Grossi, U.​S. officials and the Enerhodar mayor.  Factual nuggets (e.g., “10th blackout”) cross-checked with AP; reliability: good for facts, medium for political framing.  
4. ANS (American Nuclear Society) brief, 20 Oct 2025 – Technical note that summarises IAEA status reports; reliability: high for line status and reactor condition.  
5. Stimson Center note, 4 Aug 2025 – Only qualitative (“fragile”); low information density.  
6. Newsweek, 2025 – Article is about Chernobyl; only tangential mention of ZNPP.  Not used for quantitative base rate.  
7. Agent-compiled chronology – Attempts a complete blackout list 2022-2025 using IAEA updates and World Nuclear News.  Some gaps flagged by the author; still the single best quantitative tally.  Treated as a credible but not definitive count; cross-checked against AP and ANS.

Factual consensus extracted:  
• Ten complete losses of external power (“full blackouts”) at ZNPP between 25 Aug 2022 and 23 Sep 2025.  
• During that span the plant never had more than two high-voltage lines and often only one.  
• No publicly reported blackout between 23 Sep 2025 and today (30 Jan 2026).  (Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence but there has been no IAEA alert, which is unusual if a full blackout had occurred.)

(b)  Reference class analysis  

Possible classes:  
1. Rate of complete blackouts at ZNPP itself (Aug 2022–Sep 2025).  
2. All Ukrainian NPPs under wartime conditions 2022-2026.  
3. Historical record of NPPs worldwide in active war zones (very small N).  

Class 1 is most directly applicable: same asset, same two transmission lines, same military geography.  Using the plant’s own history avoids stretching a flimsy global database.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  

Forecast window: 30 Jan 2026 → 1 May 2026 = 92 days ≈ 3.0 months.  

Empirical frequency: 10 blackouts over 25 months (25 Aug 2022 → 23 Sep 2025) = 0.40 blackouts / month.  
That yields an average inter-arrival time ≈ 2.5 months.

Updated recent trend: 0 blackouts in last 4.3 months.  If that lull is real (and not merely unreported), the current rate ≲ 0.23 / month.  

Using a simple exponential (Poisson) model:

• Base-rate λ₁ (historic) = 0.40 × 3 months = 1.2 expected events → P(at least 1) = 1 – e^(-1.2) = 70%.  
• Adjusted λ₂ (recent) = 0.23 × 3 months = 0.69 → P = 50%.  

(d)  Justification of outside-view figure  

Reasons to shade downward from the historic 70 %:

1. The last blackout (Sep 2025) triggered an intensive, internationally monitored repair effort; both Russia and Ukraine publicly endorsed it.  Even a modest reduction in vulnerability materially lowers λ.  
2. Seasonality: the most lethal missile waves that caused three earlier blackouts (Nov 2022, Mar 2023, Mar 2024) came during heavy nationwide strikes on energy infrastructure in the depth of winter.  The current window ends 1 May, when such campaigns typically abate.  
3. Only two grid lines remain.  Any one line failure now produces an automatic full blackout, so the system is still fragile – preventing probability from dropping too low.  
4. IAEA still labels safety situation “unsustainable,” suggesting risk remains significant; there is no sign of demilitarisation of the area.  

Balancing these, I weight the recent-trend model at 60 % and the full-history model at 40 %:

P = 0.60 × 50 %  + 0.40 × 70 % = 58 %.

Rounding to the nearest percent for clarity and acknowledging ±10 pp uncertainty, I state the outside-view probability at 58 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 10 blackouts/25 months → 70 % in a 3-month window.  
• Dampening factors: 4-month lull, winter-strike season ending, partial line repairs.  
• Result after linear blend = 58 %.  The figure sits comfortably between the historic and recent-trend extremes and is well inside a reasonable 40-70 % calibration band.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 58 % chance that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will suffer at least one more complete loss of external power before 1 May 2026.
