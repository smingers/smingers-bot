Analysis:

1. Source analysis (condensed to the most decision-relevant items)

a. IAEA Board of Governors communiqués, 21 & 30 Jan 2026 (AFP, Free Malaysia Today).  
   • Factual: only one 330 kV (“Ferrosplavna-1”) line is presently energised; 750 kV line remains severed.  
   • Quality: very high – communiqué excerpts & DG Grossi quotations.  
   • Opinion: member-state worry; treat as context.

b. Moscow Times, 17 Jan 2026.  
   • Factual: 4th IAEA-brokered local ceasefire; repair of last backup line began 19 Jan after 17 days of total disconnection.  
   • Quality: high (IAEA press note; independent newsroom).  
   • Opinion: none relied upon.

c. Meduza, 19 Jan 2026.  
   • Factual: Russian strikes increasingly target 330 kV hubs in Zaporizhzhia region.  
   • Quality: moderate; well-sourced Ukrainian grid data.  
   • Opinion: commentators blame inadequate air defence - filtered out.

d. NucNet, 10 Jun 2025 & RFE/RL, 1 Oct 2025.  
   • Factual: tenth full blackout on 23 Sep 2025; longest outage (≈3 weeks).  
   • Quality: high – IAEA-validated.  
   • Opinion: Zelenskyy accusations ignored for prediction.

e. Russian-language trade press (Kommersant, RT, Interfax), 29 Jan 2026.  
   • Factual: year-long repair campaign just started; two diesel generators offline for overhaul.  
   • Quality: moderate – corporate press releases but easily falsifiable; accepted with caution.  
   • Opinion: boasts of “sufficient capacity” discarded.

f. Izvestia & Aif, 29 Jan 2026.  
   • Factual: continuous skirmishes, drone strike 24 Jan; Russian forces within 12-14 km of Zaporizhzhia city.  
   • Quality: low–moderate; still useful for front-line proximity.

2. Evidence weighting

Strong  
• Historical record: 10 complete blackouts in 38 months ⇒ λ≈0.26/month (IAEA, multiple outlets).  
• Single remaining high-voltage line as of 30 Jan 2026 (IAEA). Losing it automatically meets resolution criteria.  
• Active combat zone with increasing strikes on 330 kV nodes (Meduza, IAEA DG Grossi letter).

Moderate  
• Temporary ceasefire enabled initial repairs (Moscow Times) – marginally lowers risk while it lasts.  
• Planned restoration of 750 kV “Dniprovska” line later in 2026 (Kommersant) – outside forecast window.

Weak  
• Russian-press claims that plant can power crypto farms if fighting stops – not causal.  
• Forecasts of imminent Russian breakthrough – speculative.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days until cut-off: 92 (~3 months).  
If window halved to 46 days: Poisson λ≈0.26×1.5 = 0.39 ⇒ P≈32%.  
If doubled to 184 days: λ≈1.6 ⇒ P≈80%.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Start with Poisson-derived base rate P=1–e^(–0.78)=54% for 3 months.

Downward pressures (–5 pts)  
• Freshly restored 330 kV line; ceasefire still nominally in force.  
• Heightened IAEA and international scrutiny.

Upward pressures (+3 pts)  
• Still only ONE external line – zero redundancy.  
• Two diesel generators under overhaul reduces graceful-failure margin; an outage could last longer but criteria need only a momentary loss.  
• Front line activity & systematic targeting of 330 kV hubs continues; January saw multiple strikes despite winter.

Net: 54 – 5 + 3 ≈ 52%.

Probability calibration
My best estimate: 52 % chance that at least one further complete loss of external power occurs at Zaporizhzhia NPP between now (30 Jan 2026) and 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 30 Jan – 1 May 2026, will ZNPP simultaneously lose all external power lines (full blackout)?”  
2. Outside base: 54 % (Poisson from 10 events/38 mo).  
3. Consistency: “About 52 out of 100 similar 3-month periods would see a blackout.”  
4. Key evidence: a) only one active line, b) 10 prior blackouts, c) combat near 330 kV nodes, d) ceasefire & repairs 19 Jan, e) reduced generator redundancy.  
5. Blind-spot: rapid restoration of a second line in February combined with sustained ceasefire could slash risk.  
6. Status quo: pattern of an outage every ≈5 months is the status quo; next “due” around Feb–Mar.

Probability: 52%
