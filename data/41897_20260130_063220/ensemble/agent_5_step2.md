Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological, concise)
1. ANS 20 Oct 2024 – Technical note confirming 10th full blackout on 23 Sep 2025 and status of only two remaining lines. High‐quality, factual, IAEA-based.
2. NucNet 10 Jun 2025 – Details the 23 Sep 2025 blackout, diesel-generator response, fuel autonomy. High quality, purely factual.
3. RFERL 01 Oct 2025 – Adds generator-failure claim from Zelenskyy; corroborates 10th blackout. Mixed factual/opinion, but core facts match IAEA reports.
4. Moscow Times 17 Jan 2026 – Reports 750 kV line intact, 330 kV line cut on 02 Jan; localized cease-fire to repair. Factual quotes from IAEA. Reliable.
5. Meduza 19 Jan 2026 – Describes intensified Russian strikes on Ukrainian grid, several regional blackouts. Indirect but reliable.
6. AFP/Free Malaysia Today 30 Jan 2026 – IAEA board called over “growing concern”; repeats 02 Jan damage and single-line situation. High‐quality wire copy.
7. Aif-Moscow 29 Jan 2026 – Russian advance toward Zaporizhzhia, likely uptick in combat near plant. Source partisan, but troop-movement facts echoed elsewhere.
8. Russian/UA press 29 Jan 2026 – Start of 2026 repair campaign, first major diesel-generator overhaul. Factual but operator-controlled messaging.

b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• 10 historical complete blackouts in 29 months (IAEA, ANS, NucNet) → robust base rate.  
• Plant now running on a single 750 kV line after 02 Jan cut (IAEA, Moscow Times, AFP) → structural vulnerability.  
• Ongoing artillery/missile activity within 10 km of site (IAEA, Moscow Times, Aif) → causal mechanism for line loss.

Moderate evidence
• Localized cease-fire allowed engineers to begin repairs on 330 kV line 19 Jan (IAEA) → second line may return within weeks.  
• IAEA-supervised “repair campaign” and diesel-generator servicing (Interfax) → marginally more resilience if blackout occurs.  
• Four-month blackout-free spell since 23 Sep 2025 → suggests hazard rate may be trending down.

Weak evidence
• Speculation about buffer zone or shared control; no binding agreement yet.  
• Winter grid-stress article (Meduza) only indirectly linked to ZNPP risk.

c) Timeframe analysis
Remaining window: 92 days (≈3.0 months).  Doubling to six months would materially raise risk; halving to six weeks would cut probability roughly one-third, because expected blackout arrivals are well modelled by a Poisson process with λ≈0.34 mo⁻¹ when single-line and ≈0.17 mo⁻¹ when two-line.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base (Poisson on 10 blackouts / 29 mo) → P₀ = 64 %.  
Adjustments:
+6 pts Currently only one functioning line, identical set-up at time of past blackouts.  
+4 pts Fighting near plant expected to intensify per multiple sources.  
−5 pts Repair work on 330 kV “Ferrosplavna-1” line underway; if finished by mid-Feb, risk in latter two months falls sharply.  
−2 pts Slight downward trend: only two blackouts in last 12 mo.  
Net shift: +3 pts → 64 % + 3 % ≈ 67 %.  
Round conservatively to reflect parameter uncertainty → 65 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that, if we could re-run the next 92 days 100 times under similar conditions, ZNPP would suffer at least one complete loss of external power about 65 times.”

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase: “Will ZNPP lose all external power again before 1 May 2026 (full blackout of both remaining lines)?”  
2. Base rate: 64 % (10 events/29 mo Poisson).  
3. Consistency: “65 out of 100 times, a full blackout occurs.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Single operational 750 kV line since 02 Jan 26.  
   – 10 prior blackouts; mean interval ≈ 3 mo.  
   – Active combat & fresh grid attacks near plant.  
   – Repairs to second line started 19 Jan 26.  
   – No blackout in last 4 months.  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid successful repair of both 330 kV and an auxiliary 750 kV tie within weeks coupled with sustained cease-fire could slash risk below 30 %.  
6. Status-quo: Historical pattern is recurrence; situation (one line, war zone) largely unchanged, so lean marginally toward “Yes”.

Probability: 65%
