    "description": "Ukraine's Ministry of Energy (reported)[https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/01/03/8014459/] that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost power from one of its high-voltage lines on the night of January 2-3, 2026, due to renewed hostilities, forcing the plant onto backup diesel generators. This follows a December 6, 2025, incident where the IAEA reported the ZNPP temporarily lost all connection to external power. The plant's reactors, in cold shutdown, still require a constant power supply for essential safety functions. With a history of roughly 12 blackouts since February 2022 and frequent reliance on single high-voltage lines, the situation remains extremely fragile, necessitating reliance on emergency diesel generators as a last line of defense.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"dd97f29e612a33a3\",\"sheet_id\":95}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This resolves as \"Yes\" if, after the opening of this question and before May 1, 2026, there are credible reports, for example from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or international news media, that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has simultaneously lost connection to all its external power lines (currently the 750 kV and 330 kV lines), resulting in a \"full blackout\". The loss of only one of its remaining power lines does not count. The duration of the power loss does not affect the resolution.",
