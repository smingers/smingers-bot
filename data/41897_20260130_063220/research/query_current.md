Analysis:
The market hinges on one binary event: at any moment between now (30 Jan 2026) and 1 May 2026, could all external power lines to ZNPP fail simultaneously again?  Key variables that drive that risk and, therefore, the articles we need to monitor are:

1. Current grid configuration and resilience  
   • How many 750 kV and 330 kV lines are actually operative today?  
   • Repair timelines and redundancy measures promised by Energoatom/IAEA.  

2. Military activity in the vicinity  
   • Frequency and intensity of artillery, drone and missile strikes around the plant, Enerhodar and the two corridor-lines that bring in power from Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.  
   • Russian fortification or de-escalation signals; any Ukrainian counter-offensive that might endanger pylons.

3. IAEA on-site inspection notes  
   • The IAEA’s daily status updates are the gold standard for confirming a total blackout; their communiqués typically mention “complete loss of off-site power” when it occurs.  
   • Any IAEA statements warning that only one line is presently available, which implies fragile single-point-of-failure risk.

4. Fuel and generator status  
   • Diesel reserves (normally about 10 days) and reports of logistics constraints that might raise the probability of a critical incident should a blackout occur.

5. Political and diplomatic context  
   • Talks on creating a nuclear safety zone, or—conversely—signs that such negotiations have collapsed, potentially signalling higher hostilities.

Most relevant, therefore, are:  
• IAEA Director General Grossi’s latest briefings (often via press releases and X/Twitter threads).  
• Statements from Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy and Energoatom.  
• Russian Defence Ministry communiqués or regional occupation authorities’ Telegram channels confirming or denying damage to power lines.  
• High-resolution satellite imagery or OSINT reports showing shell impacts on power lines.

The searches below aim to surface fresh incidents (Google & Google News) and layered expert commentary (Assistant) that directly speak to line outages, IAEA warnings and battlefield developments after the 2-3 Jan 2026 outage, allowing a forward-looking probability estimate of another full blackout before 1 May 2026.
