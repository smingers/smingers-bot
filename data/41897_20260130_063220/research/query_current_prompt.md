You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant experience another complete loss of external power before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Ukraine's Ministry of Energy (reported)[https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/01/03/8014459/] that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost power from one of its high-voltage lines on the night of January 2-3, 2026, due to renewed hostilities, forcing the plant onto backup diesel generators. This follows a December 6, 2025, incident where the IAEA reported the ZNPP temporarily lost all connection to external power. The plant's reactors, in cold shutdown, still require a constant power supply for essential safety functions. With a history of roughly 12 blackouts since February 2022 and frequent reliance on single high-voltage lines, the situation remains extremely fragile, necessitating reliance on emergency diesel generators as a last line of defense.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This resolves as "Yes" if, after the opening of this question and before May 1, 2026, there are credible reports, for example from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or international news media, that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has simultaneously lost connection to all its external power lines (currently the 750 kV and 330 kV lines), resulting in a "full blackout". The loss of only one of its remaining power lines does not count. The duration of the power loss does not affect the resolution.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For assistant:
Your query for your assistant will be processed more naturally, so feel free to to write a sentence-long query in natural language. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'Assistant:' or something similar. Please add the word 'Assistant' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and Assistant. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for your assistant.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for assistant?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (Assistant) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
