Analysis:
To evaluate the likelihood of another full external-power blackout, I need a clear historical baseline:  
a) how often the Zaporizhzhia NPP has lost all external power since Russia occupied it in 2022,  
b) how those outages were caused (artillery, grid instability, maintenance),  
c) the current configuration and vulnerability of its 750 kV and 330 kV lines, and  
d) any recent IAEA or Ukrainian/Russian energy-ministry statements about repairs or remaining damage.  
Timelines and authoritative IAEA communiqués are therefore the most relevant context.
