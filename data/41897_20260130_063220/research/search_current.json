Peter Potman, the Netherlands' permanent representative to the IAEA, wrote to Board President Ian David Graining Biggs on January 21, stating that delegations share 'growing concern about the seriousness and urgency of the nuclear safety risks posed by this situation.' He cited support from Canada, Lithuania, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan for the emergency meeting. Potman emphasized that recent attacks caused 'significant additional damage to energy infrastructure essential for the safe operation of nuclear power plants.' He referenced IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi\u2019s December 23 statement that Ukraine\u2019s power grid had become 'increasingly degraded and unstable,' posing a threat to nuclear safety, and noted Grossi\u2019s announcement of a new expert mission to electrical substations beginning January 26. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of targeting its nuclear facilities, warning that Russian bombardments risk triggering a new nuclear disaster. Last week, attacks temporarily cut off external power to the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Meanwhile, Zaporizhzhia, occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, despite having all six reactors shut down, still requires electricity for reactor cooling systems.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94BY7KE)\n\n**Kyiv May Disrupt IAEA Expert Rotation at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant in February**\nThe next rotation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAEPS) is expected within the next month, according to Yevgenia Yashina, Director of Communications at ZAEPS, as reported by Izvestia.ru. The last scheduled rotation occurred at the end of the previous year. IAEA experts monitor safe operation conditions and assist in repairing damaged external power lines, such as the 'Ferrosplavna-1' line, which was restored during a temporary ceasefire on January 19. However, attacks resumed afterward, including a Ukrainian drone strike on an emergency medical vehicle in Energodar on January 24, which caused no casualties. Ukrainian shelling has repeatedly disrupted or delayed IAEA expert rotations. Ukraine has attempted to blame Russia for these disruptions, prompting an emergency meeting of the IAEA governing board on January 30. While the IAEA acknowledges the risks of nuclear catastrophe and the need for demilitarization around the plant, it avoids direct accusations. The idea of establishing a demilitarized or buffer zone around ZAEPS has been repeatedly proposed by Russia and IAEA chief Rafael Grossi since 2022, but political will from Kyiv remains lacking. Russia maintains that ZAEPS is under its ownership and operated by Rosatom\u2019s 'Rosenergoatom' subsidiary, with no official talks of joint management with the U.S. or Ukraine. U.S. Vice President JD Vance raised the possibility of shared control during talks in Abu Dhabi in January 2026, though Russia denies such discussions. Western media reported on potential fair energy distribution from ZAEPS, but control remains unresolved. Meanwhile, Yashina confirmed that ZAEPS has sufficient capacity to power industrial facilities, including cryptocurrency mining farms, provided military actions cease and safety guarantees are upheld.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:01 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/2033540/semen-boikov-anastasiia-kostina/tok-shou-kiev-mozhet-sorvat-rotaciyu-na-zaehs-v-fevrale)\n\n**Repair Campaign Begins at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant**\nA 'repair campaign' has begun at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAES), scheduled to last throughout 2026.

Military expert Captain First Rank (ret.) Vasiliy Dandykin stated that Russian units from the 'Dnepro' and 'Vostok' groups are approaching Zaporizhzhia from two directions, with immediate combat expected for the enemy's largest fortified area, Orikhiv. He predicted a swift capture and subsequent advance toward the city. The industrial significance of Zaporizhzhia is highlighted, particularly the 'Motor Sich' plant, which produces drones used in attacks on Russian regions; the facility has already been targeted and will likely remain a focus. Other key industrial sites include 'Zaporozhstal' metallurgical combine, the Zaporozhye iron ore combine, and machinery manufacturing enterprises. Targeting these facilities could significantly weaken Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex. Russian forces are prepared to counter Ukrainian attempts to cross the Dnepro River near Energodar and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, with Dandykin stating that river assault bases are being systematically destroyed. He emphasized that the decision to cross the Dnepro will be made by the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, noting the difficulty of crossing the river due to its height and the destruction of the Kakhovka reservoir, though alternative crossing points exist. Dandykin also claimed that senior NATO generals have fled Zaporizhzhia, while foreign mercenaries remain, suggesting deteriorating conditions for Ukrainian forces and strengthening Russian positions. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:22 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/reshit-genshtab-boycy-rf-vyshli-na-trudnyy-marshrut-geroev-pod-zaporozhem)\n\n**IAEA board meets over nuclear safety concerns in Ukraine**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors convened on Friday, January 30, 2026, to address escalating nuclear safety concerns in Ukraine.

The aid was distributed across regions including Chernihiv, Kherson, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykola\u00efv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporijia, Donetsk, and Kyiv. Additionally, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) convened its Board of Governors on January 30, 2026, at the request of several member states alarmed by the deteriorating nuclear safety situation. The Netherlands' IAEA representative, Peter Potman, cited growing concern over the risks posed by Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, which he stated had caused significant damage to systems vital for nuclear plant safety. He referenced a December 23 statement by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi warning that Ukraine\u2019s power grid had become increasingly unstable, threatening nuclear safety. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of targeting nuclear facilities, citing the January 25 bombardment that temporarily cut off external power to the Chernobyl nuclear plant.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:46 AM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/europe/ukraine/guerre-en-ukraine-frappe-a-zaporijia-une-partie-de-kiev-toujours-sans-chauffage-le-point-sur-la-nuit-d722203e-fd8f-11f0-be0e-292cccbfadc3)\n\n**IAEA Convenes Board of Governors Over Escalating Nuclear Safety Concerns in Ukraine**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) convened its Board of Governors on Friday at the request of multiple member states concerned about the nuclear safety situation in Ukraine following Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Peter Potman, the Netherlands' permanent representative to the IAEA, wrote to Board President Ian David Graining Biggs on January 21, stating that delegations share 'growing concern about the seriousness and urgency of the nuclear safety risks posed by this situation.' He cited support from Canada, Lithuania, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan for the emergency meeting. Potman emphasized that recent attacks caused 'significant additional damage to energy infrastructure essential for the safe operation of nuclear power plants.' He referenced IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi\u2019s December 23 statement that Ukraine\u2019s power grid had become 'increasingly degraded and unstable,' posing a threat to nuclear safety, and noted Grossi\u2019s announcement of a new expert mission to electrical substations beginning January 26. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of targeting its nuclear facilities, warning that Russian bombardments risk triggering a new nuclear disaster. Last week, attacks temporarily cut off external power to the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Meanwhile, Zaporizhzhia, occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, despite having all six reactors shut down, still requires electricity for reactor cooling systems.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94BY7KE)\n\n**Kyiv May Disrupt IAEA Expert Rotation at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant in February**\nThe next rotation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAEPS) is expected within the next month, according to Yevgenia Yashina, Director of Communications at ZAEPS, as reported by Izvestia.ru. The last scheduled rotation occurred at the end of the previous year. IAEA experts monitor safe operation conditions and assist in repairing damaged external power lines, such as the 'Ferrosplavna-1' line, which was restored during a temporary ceasefire on January 19. However, attacks resumed afterward, including a Ukrainian drone strike on an emergency medical vehicle in Energodar on January 24, which caused no casualties. Ukrainian shelling has repeatedly disrupted or delayed IAEA expert rotations. Ukraine has attempted to blame Russia for these disruptions, prompting an emergency meeting of the IAEA governing board on January 30. While the IAEA acknowledges the risks of nuclear catastrophe and the need for demilitarization around the plant, it avoids direct accusations. The idea of establishing a demilitarized or buffer zone around ZAEPS has been repeatedly proposed by Russia and IAEA chief Rafael Grossi since 2022, but political will from Kyiv remains lacking. Russia maintains that ZAEPS is under its ownership and operated by Rosatom\u2019s 'Rosenergoatom' subsidiary, with no official talks of joint management with the U.S. or Ukraine. U.S. Vice President JD Vance raised the possibility of shared control during talks in Abu Dhabi in January 2026, though Russia denies such discussions. Western media reported on potential fair energy distribution from ZAEPS, but control remains unresolved. Meanwhile, Yashina confirmed that ZAEPS has sufficient capacity to power industrial facilities, including cryptocurrency mining farms, provided military actions cease and safety guarantees are upheld.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:01 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/2033540/semen-boikov-anastasiia-kostina/tok-shou-kiev-mozhet-sorvat-rotaciyu-na-zaehs-v-fevrale)\n\n**Repair Campaign Begins at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant**\nA 'repair campaign' has begun at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAES), scheduled to last throughout 2026.

The campaign started with the shutdown of main and auxiliary equipment for safety systems on Unit 5\u2019s second channel. Work is underway in the reactor and turbine compartments, as well as specialized workshops. While some tasks are handled by the plant\u2019s internal repair teams, the primary work is assigned to the contractor 'Atomenergoremont'. For the first time, specialized external companies have been engaged for the major overhaul of safety system diesel generators. The campaign is scheduled to last the entire year, with personnel and equipment safety as the top priority. All activities are conducted under the supervision and inspection of IAEA inspectors. Earlier, power supply via the 'Ferrosplavna-1' high-voltage line was restored. Additionally, the issue of control over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was discussed during trilateral talks between Russian, Ukrainian, and U.S. delegations in Abu Dhabi.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:40 AM\nSource:[RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c](https://russian.rt.com/russia/news/1589153-zaes-remont-2026)\n\n**For the First Time, Specialized External Organizations Involved in ZAES Repair Campaign**\nThe 2026 repair campaign at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAES), including maintenance and major overhauls of key equipment, has officially begun, marking the first time specialized external organizations are being involved. The campaign started with the removal of main and auxiliary equipment from the safety systems of Unit 5\u2019s second channels, with work underway in the reactor and turbine sections, as well as equipment owner workshops. For the first time, external specialists will conduct major repairs on two safety system diesel generators, while station personnel will handle part of the work. The primary contractor is 'Atomenergoremont'. Safety of personnel and equipment remains the top priority, with strict oversight throughout the entire repair cycle\u2014from personnel training and material inspection to documentation and equipment handover. The quality of these works directly impacts the safe and reliable future operation of the plant. The campaign will last one year. ZAES, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe with six VVER-1000 reactors, has been offline since September 11, 2022, with all six reactors in cold shutdown. The plant is owned by the Russian federal state unitary enterprise 'Zaporozhskaya AES' and operated by 'Exploitation Organization of Zaporozhskaya AES', a subsidiary of 'Rosenergoatom' (part of the 'Rosatom' State Corporation).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 10:36 AM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/world/1070090)\n\n**Russian Forces Advance Toward Zaporizhzhia: A Strategic Push on the Frontlines**\nRussian forces are advancing toward Zaporizhzhia, now within 12\u201314 km of the city, according to a report by Aif-Moscow published on January 29, 2026. Military expert Captain First Rank (ret.) Vasiliy Dandykin stated that Russian units from the 'Dnepro' and 'Vostok' groups are approaching Zaporizhzhia from two directions, with immediate combat expected for the enemy's largest fortified area, Orikhiv. He predicted a swift capture and subsequent advance toward the city. The industrial significance of Zaporizhzhia is highlighted, particularly the 'Motor Sich' plant, which produces drones used in attacks on Russian regions; the facility has already been targeted and will likely remain a focus. Other key industrial sites include 'Zaporozhstal' metallurgical combine, the Zaporozhye iron ore combine, and machinery manufacturing enterprises. Targeting these facilities could significantly weaken Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex. Russian forces are prepared to counter Ukrainian attempts to cross the Dnepro River near Energodar and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, with Dandykin stating that river assault bases are being systematically destroyed. He emphasized that the decision to cross the Dnepro will be made by the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, noting the difficulty of crossing the river due to its height and the destruction of the Kakhovka reservoir, though alternative crossing points exist. Dandykin also claimed that senior NATO generals have fled Zaporizhzhia, while foreign mercenaries remain, suggesting deteriorating conditions for Ukrainian forces and strengthening Russian positions. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:22 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/reshit-genshtab-boycy-rf-vyshli-na-trudnyy-marshrut-geroev-pod-zaporozhem)\n\n**Greenpeace Condemns France\u2019s Nuclear Trade with Russia Amid Ukraine War**\nGreenpeace has condemned France's continued nuclear trade with Russia despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, stating that 'the trade between the French and Russian nuclear industries continues as if Russia had not started a war against Ukraine.' According to Pauline Boyer of Greenpeace France, this trade supports Russia's economy and, by extension, its war machine. A report published on January 28, 2026, reveals that France continues to import enriched and re-enriched uranium from Russia, including from the Siberian facility in Seversk, where used fuel elements are reprocessed. The report claims France is '100% dependent on Russia' for re-enriched uranium. Additionally, France imports natural uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan\u2014former Soviet republics\u2014where much of the material is transported through Russian state territory via Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear company. Greenpeace criticized Rosatom as 'the only company in the world that has forcibly taken control of a foreign nuclear facility,' citing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Boyer declared the nuclear trade with Rosatom 'unacceptable' and called on the French government and the EU to impose sanctions, noting that Rosatom has not yet been sanctioned due to lack of EU consensus. Greenpeace also demanded greater transparency in uranium imports, highlighting that in the past two years, the origin of about half of the imported enriched uranium could not be traced. Although France does not rely on Russian gas, it depends on uranium to power its 57 nuclear reactors, which supply approximately 70% of the country\u2019s electricity. President Emmanuel Macron announced in 2022 a 'renaissance of nuclear power' and pledged the construction of 14 new-generation reactors.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:43 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94A77KE)\n\n**IAEA Reports Repair Work Begins at Occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant After Local Ceasefire**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that repair work on damaged external power transmission lines at the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has begun, following a four-week period without electricity. According to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, the repairs became possible after the establishment of local ceasefire zones, which enabled safe access for specialists to the site. Grossi emphasized that restoring external power supply is critical for nuclear safety, as the plant had been operating solely on backup diesel generators for an extended period. The IAEA noted that both sides of the conflict have cooperated constructively with the agency to implement the complex repair plan. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been under Russian occupation since 2022, and the IAEA has repeatedly warned of nuclear safety risks due to ongoing military activities around the facility.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2025/10/18/8003299/)\n\n**IAEA Reports Initiation of External Power Restoration at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the process of restoring external power supply to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAES) has begun via the 'Dniprovska' and 'Ferrosplavna-1' transmission lines. According to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, this follows intensive consultations with both Ukrainian and Russian representatives over recent weeks. The IAEA emphasized that the primary focus has been establishing necessary safety conditions for repair work on damaged sections of the 750 kV 'Dniprovska' and 330 kV 'Ferrosplavna-1' power lines, which are located on opposite sides of the front line near the plant. Grossi stated that although time is still needed for full reconnection, both sides are constructively cooperating with the IAEA to achieve this critical goal for nuclear safety. He warned that no one benefits from further deterioration of the situation. The blackout at ZAES, which began on September 23, 2025, has left the plant dependent on diesel generators and disconnected from Ukraine\u2019s power grid. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate warns that prolonged absence of external power, combined with depleted diesel fuel reserves, risks a nuclear accident due to rising reactor water temperatures. The IAEA confirmed that Russian actions at the plant pose a direct threat to nuclear and radiation safety not only for Ukraine but for the entire region. If backup power systems fail completely, there is a risk of nuclear fuel meltdown, according to the agency.

The plant, which has been under Russian control for three years, currently relies solely on emergency diesel generators for power. Six reactors remain in cold shutdown, but their fuel is still inside the reactors\u2014four with U.S.-supplied fuel and two with Russian fuel. Expert Maxim Shingarikin states that storing nuclear fuel in reactors for years after shutdown violates Russian law and international safety standards, as fuel should be removed within days or weeks. The IAEA's stress tests after Fukushima allow for 72 hours of operation on backup power, which has already been exceeded twice. Shingarikin criticizes the lack of action over three years: no connection to the Russian power grid, no removal of foreign fuel, and no use of the nearby Zaporozhye Thermal Power Plant (which could supply power but remains under Ukrainian ownership). He argues that the claim of ongoing shelling preventing repairs lacks verifiable evidence and that the IAEA should have established an operational task force with Russian, Ukrainian, and international experts to monitor the situation. The IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has confirmed the risk of a nuclear accident, which Shingarikin attributes to systemic failures in safety compliance and international coordination.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/10/02/ekspert-shingarkin-rasskazal-kak-mozhno-izbezhat-kriticheskoy-situacii-na-zaporozhskoy-aes.html)\n\n**Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant Loses All External Power, Endangering Safety**\nOn 23 September 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine had lost all external power for the tenth time during the Russia\u2011Ukraine conflict.

This situation creates serious safety risks, Grossi said, because the reactors are in a cold\u2011shutdown state and cannot be safely restarted under current conditions.  He noted that the level of the cooling pool has dropped to 13.4\u202fm, approaching the 12.0\u202fm threshold below which cooling systems fail.  Grossi added that isolation measures of the inlet channel provide only short\u2011term relief and that a long\u2011term solution, such as building a pumping station, is required.  He also expressed serious concern over continuous military activity near the site, which adds stress and risk.  The IAEA has reported that all six reactors have been in cold shutdown since spring\u202f2024 but still require cooling water for safety systems, active reactor zones, and spent\u2011fuel pools.  Earlier this year, IAEA staff were denied access to a newly built dam on one of the cooling channels, highlighting difficulties in ensuring reliable water supply.  In July, a Russian attack on the transmission line that connects ZAP to the Ukrainian grid caused a blackout, but subsequent reports indicated that the lines are now operating stably, providing reliable external power for radiation safety.
