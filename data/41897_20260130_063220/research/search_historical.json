Built in the 1980s with a containment building 1.75m (5.75 ft) thick of heavily reinforced concrete on a seismic bed.\n\n2. **Power line status (as of late August 2022):** The plant was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine's grid on August 25, 2022, when fires twice brought down its last remaining 750 kilovolt power line. The other three power lines were put out of action during the war.\n\n3. **Backup power:** In the August incident, electricity was sourced to a less powerful line from a nearby coal-fired thermal power station, and diesel generators were also used.\n\n4. **Reactor status (as of November 2022):** Only two of the six reactors were operating at the time of this article; the other four were in cold shutdown.\n\n5. **Historical context:** Russia seized the plant at the start of the war. Both sides have accused each other of repeatedly shelling it.\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Rafael Grossi (IAEA head):**\n- Warned of a \"very real risk of nuclear disaster\"\n- Led a team to inspect the plant\n\n**Mark Wenman (Head of Centre for Doctoral Training in Nuclear Energy Futures):**\n- Rejects comparisons with Chernobyl or Fukushima\n- States the containment building \"takes a hell of a lot to breach\"\n- Believes diesel generators should be able to cool the reactor if grid power is lost, provided they're in good shape\n- Identifies the human factor (chronic fatigue/stress of staff) as the biggest risk of nuclear accident: \"And that violates all the safety principles\"\n- Praises Ukrainian staff for reducing the number of operating reactors\n\n**Prof. Claire Corkhill (University of Sheffield, professor of nuclear material degradation):**\n- States a pump/generator failure could lead to reactor core overheating, though \"that wouldn't be as serious as Chernobyl\"\n- Believes \"the risk of something going wrong is genuine\"\n- Notes Russia would be at risk just as much as Central Europe\n- Expresses concern that stressed staff may not be \"on top form\" if something goes wrong\n\n**Prof. Iztok Tiselj (University of Ljubljana, chair of nuclear engineering):**\n- Believes \"the risk of a major radioactive incident is minimal\" since only two of six reactors were operating\n- States \"From the standpoint of European citizens there's no reason to worry\"\n- Believes any release from damaged spent fuel would be \"so small as to be negligible\"\n\n**Lt Gen Igor Kirillov (Russia's nuclear protection corps):**\n- Says shelling has damaged the plant's support systems\n- Warns pump and generator failure could lead to reactor core overheating and plant facilities being destroyed\n\n## Risk Assessment from Article:\n\n- **Most worrying risk:** Loss of power supply to nuclear reactors combined with diesel backup generator failure, leading to loss of coolant and fuel melting\n- **Less serious risks:** Damage to spent fuel pools or dry cask storage (would release radioactivity but less serious than loss of coolant)\n- **Containment building damage:** Considered less likely due to robust construction\n\n## Other Information:\n\n- Ukraine's nuclear agency warned that diesel generators \"do not provide a long-term solution\"\n- Plant staff working under Russian occupation under significant stress; two workers told BBC of daily kidnapping risk\n- UN Secretary General called on Russia in August to pull troops out and demilitarize the area; Russia refused\n- Employee letter warned of disaster if Russia tries to shut down the plant to reconnect it to Crimea instead of Ukraine\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-zaporizhzhia-a0273ea4558a7b26cf232edd620942cc\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Ukrainian nuclear plant's longest power outage since war began is 'critical' moment\"\n\n**Source:** AP News  \n**Date:** October 01, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Current Outage Details:**\n   - Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost external power on September 23, 2025\n   - As of the article date (October 1, 2025), the plant had been without external power for more than a week\n   - This is the longest outage since Russia's invasion in 2022\n   - The plant is currently operating on emergency diesel generators\n\n2. **Generator Status:**\n   - Eight generator units are currently operating\n   - Nine units are on standby\n   - Three units are under maintenance\n   - Fuel reserves are expected to last more than 10 days (with ongoing resupply)\n\n3. **Plant Status:**\n   - All six reactors have been shut down for more than three years\n   - Reactors are in \"cold shutdown\" (fission reactions stopped, temperatures and pressure gradually declining)\n   - The plant no longer supplies power to the grid but still needs electricity to cool inactive reactors and spent fuel\n\n4. **Historical Context:**\n   - Russia captured the facility early in the war\n   - Russia declared the plant annexed in September 2022\n   - This is the latest in a series of power incidents caused by fighting in the eastern region\n\n## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:\n\n1. **Rafael Grossi (IAEA Head):**\n   - Conditions remain stable for now\n   - Warned that restoring reliable external power is vital\n   - Stated the current backup system is \"clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety\"\n\n2. **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:**\n   - Described the situation as \"critical\"\n   - Stressed that backup systems were never intended for prolonged use\n\n3. **Dmytro Gumeniuk (senior official at Ukraine's state nuclear safety agency):**\n   - Warned that Russian forces must ensure fuel deliveries to keep generators running\n   - \"The fact that it is running on diesel generators already represents a risk. Even if they are refueled, this is still not a typical situation. Generators can fail, and they must be constantly monitored. We've never had a case like this before.\"\n\n4. **IAEA (general assessment):**\n   - Says the plant is stable for now\n   - Any disruption to backup systems could quickly escalate the risk\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Equipment and staff are available to repair the main power line and backup line, but ongoing fighting has blocked access\n- Ukraine blamed Russian artillery for the power loss; Russia rejected this accusation through Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, calling it \"stupid\" to suggest Russia shelled a facility it controls\n- Cooling remains essential, especially for spent fuel stored on-site, which must stay submerged to prevent overheating\n- A complete loss of power could lead to fuel overheating if cooling systems fail\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://time.com/7327608/russia-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/\">\n# Summary of TIME Article: \"How Putin Stole a Nuclear Power Plant (And Got Away With It)\"\n\n**Date:** October 23, 2025  \n**Author:** Simon Shuster  \n**Source:** TIME\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Putin's Knowledge:** Rafael Grossi (IAEA head) states that Putin knows the technical details of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant \"very precisely,\" including layout, cooling water sources, high-voltage cables, and damage locations.\n\n2. **Seizure Timeline:** Russian forces seized the facility in spring 2022. The first attempt was during opening days of invasion; successful takeover occurred March 3-4, 2022 after a nighttime battle.\n\n3. **Plant Status:** The Russians placed the plant into cold shutdown in 2022; reactors have not produced electricity since then.\n\n4. **Blackout Count:** As of September 23, 2025, the plant experienced its **10th blackout** since Russia took over the facility (note: this differs from the background information stating ~12 blackouts).\n\n5. **September 2025 Blackout:** On September 23, 2025, intense fighting cut off external power supply. This outage lasted longer than previous ones, with the plant running on emergency backup diesel generators for at least 7+ days.\n\n6. **Population Impact:** The town of Energodar had a population of just over 50,000 at the time of invasion, including thousands of plant employees and their families.\n\n## Opinions from Reliable/Named Sources:\n\n**Rafael Grossi (IAEA Director General):**\n- Describes the plant as having become \"larger than life\" in Putin's military strategy\n- States nuclear safety risks \"remain dangerously high\"\n- Called emergency power supply the \"last line of defense\" and stated \"It is clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety\"\n- As of October 18, 2025: confirmed repairs to restore power were underway but would take \"some time,\" adding \"there is now finally some light at the end of the tunnel\"\n- Noted that restoring power lines won't resolve broader stalemate over reactor future\n\n**Senior U.S. Administration Official (Trump Administration):**\n- In October 17, 2025 interview: stated both Russians and Ukrainians had agreed to power restoration, and \"Grossi's team is fixing it right now\"\n\n**Oleg Orlov (Mayor of Energodar):**\n- Organized resistance efforts to block Russian advance initially\n- Stated their aim was \"not to let them rush in like a blitzkrieg\"\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- The article frames the plant as a \"valuable asset\" for Putin that can be traded for concessions from the West\n- Nuclear fuel stockpile remains on site\n- If cooling systems fail or run out of diesel, there's potential for nuclear fuel to overheat and potentially melt down\n- Russian troops used the facility as a forward operating base\n- Russians imposed ~$700 bribes for civilians to leave Energodar\n\n**Note:** The article appears to cut off mid-sentence and may be incomplete in the extraction provided.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.stimson.org/2025/nuclear-security-news-and-member-updates-roundup-july-2025/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** Stimson Center  \n**Date:** August 04, 2025  \n**Author:** Joaquin Matamis\n\n## Key Relevant Information:\n\n**Facts and Context:**\n- July 2025 marked the 80th anniversary of the Trinity nuclear test\n- July 2025 also marked the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials (A/CPPNM)\n- The second Conference of the Parties to the Amendment is scheduled for April 2027\n\n**Relevant Opinion/Assessment:**\n- The article characterizes the safety and security situation for Ukraine's nuclear power plants as \"fragile,\" with specific mention of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted web content appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence with \"Read to the end of the\"), so this summary may not capture the full scope of the article.

This occurred when electrical substations \"vital for nuclear safety\" were affected.\n\n2. **Power Restored**: Ukraine's energy ministry subsequently reported that Chernobyl's power was restored and there is no direct threat to people. All facilities are now being supplied under normal conditions by Ukraine's electricity grid.\n\n3. **Impact on Other Plants**: Other Ukrainian nuclear power plants were also impacted when their power lines were disrupted by the strikes.\n\n4. **Attack Scale**: Ukraine's air force command said that 27 missiles and 315 drones were shot down or jammed, while five missiles and 24 drones hit 11 locations.\n\n5. **Ukraine's Nuclear Infrastructure**: According to the World Nuclear Association, Ukraine operates four nuclear power plants with 15 reactors that typically generate about half its electricity.\n\n6. **Zaporizhzhia Status**: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, is currently under Russian occupation and not operational. It is the subject of fractious peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n**Statements from Named Sources:**\n\n- **IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi**: Said \"The IAEA is actively following developments in order to assess impact on nuclear safety.\" He has repeatedly warned Russia and Ukraine of severe threats posed to nuclear infrastructure.\n\n- **Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha**: Accused Russia of a \"reckless\" attack that imperiled nuclear safety, calling it \"the use of nuclear risk as a tool of coercion.\"\n\n- **Mikhail Ulyanov (Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna)**: Stated that strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are carried out in response to Ukrainian attacks on civilian facilities in Russia, primarily to disrupt energy supply of Ukraine's military-industrial complex. He claimed \"The Russian Armed Forces are not taking targeted steps to undermine the power supply of nuclear power plants under Kyiv's control.\"\n\n- **Russian defense ministry**: Said its forces targeted Ukrainian military and industrial installations, as well as energy and transport infrastructure used by Kyiv's armed forces.\n\n- **Ukrainian energy ministry**: Confirmed radiation levels at Chernobyl's industrial site and within the exclusion zone do not exceed control limits. The plant has necessary fuel reserves and fully operational backup power sources in the event of repeat attacks.\n\n**Note**: This article focuses on Chernobyl, not Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, though it mentions Zaporizhzhia's current status as under Russian occupation and not operational.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ans.org/news/2025-10-20/article-7472/update-on-zaporizhzhia/\">\n# Summary of Article on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\n**Key Facts and Timeline:**\n\n- **Repairs initiated**: As of mid-October (timeframe appears to be 2024 based on context), repairs had reportedly started to restore off-site power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\n- **10th blackout**: Approximately one month before October 15, the site lost connection to the grid for the 10th time during the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, according to IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.\n\n- **Current power situation**: \n  - Before the conflict, the plant had access to 10 power lines\n  - This has been reduced to two lines in recent years\n  - One 330-kilovolt line was lost on May 7\n  - The sole remaining 750-kV line was disconnected on September 23\n  - This represents the plant's longest complete loss of off-site power during the conflict\n\n- **Emergency diesel generators (EDGs)**: \n  - Seven EDGs are currently producing electricity for the site\n  - Primary use is for water pumps to cool fuel in six shut-down reactors and spent fuel\n  - Another 13 EDGs are in standby mode\n  - The plant alternates which generators are in use for servicing\n\n**Statements from IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi (October 15):**\n- \"The current situation\u2014with the plant relying on emergency diesel generators for weeks now\u2014is not sustainable.\"\n- Both Russia and Ukraine indicated they want the repairs to proceed\n- Repairs are needed on both sides of the front line, at locations several kilometers from the site\n\n**Safety Status (per IAEA monitoring):**\n- Safety systems continue operating for all reactor units and spent fuel pools\n- No increase in temperatures within reactor coolant or spent fuel pools\n- Nuclear fuel continues to be cooled effectively\n- Radiation levels confirmed as normal for the site\n- All essential service sprinkler ponds were full and operating\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Military activities continue at various distances from the site\n- The region is described as \"an active war zone\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide a chronological list (2022-Jan 30 2026) of every instance when Zaporizhzhia NPP lost all external power, citing IAEA or major international media;
