## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Rivian's own quarterly delivery history (2023-2025)**
   - Suitability: High - most direct comparison
   - Pattern: Quarterly deliveries ranged 9,745 (Q4 2025 low) to 14,183 (Q4 2024 high)
   - Average quarterly 2025: 42,247/4 = 10,562 deliveries

2. **Tesla Model 3 ramp during initial launch quarters**
   - Suitability: Low-Medium - different scale, market conditions, and timeframe
   - Model 3 had severe production hell; Rivian claims better preparation

3. **Legacy automaker new model launches**
   - Suitability: Low - Rivian is still scaling, not an established high-volume manufacturer

4. **Rivian Q1 historical pattern**
   - Suitability: High - Q1 is specifically what we're forecasting
   - Q1 2025 data not explicitly provided, but can infer from full-year numbers

**Selected reference class: Rivian's quarterly delivery history (2024-2025)**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (currently Jan 30, 2026)
- ~60 days remaining in the quarter
- ~70% of the quarter has already elapsed

**Historical quarterly patterns:**
- Q3 2025: 13,201 (highest of 2025, boosted by tax credit expiration)
- Q4 2025: 9,745 (lowest, post-credit cliff)
- 2025 average: ~10,562/quarter
- 2024 quarterly average: ~12,875/quarter

**Q1 seasonal considerations:**
- Typically slower quarter for auto sales (post-holiday, winter weather)
- Tax credit dynamics: Credit expired Sept 30, 2025; potential new eligibility for Rivian in 2026 per draft legislation
- R2 impact: Validation units just started; "saleable units" expected late Q1 or early Q2

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from recent quarters:**
Rivian's Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 vehicles in a depressed demand environment post-tax-credit expiration. Q3 2025 delivered 13,201 in an artificially elevated environment (credit pull-forward). The "normalized" baseline appears to be 10,000-11,000 quarterly deliveries for legacy R1/EDV models.

**Q1 2026 specific factors:**

*Headwinds:*
- Q1 is historically a slower sales quarter
- Only ~60 days remain; most of January likely already reflected in production/delivery pipeline
- R2 is still in validation phase; mass deliveries unlikely before late March at earliest
- Demand uncertainty following credit expiration

*Tailwinds:*
- Potential tax credit reinstatement for Rivian (below 200k threshold)
- R2 initial deliveries could begin in late Q1 (even small numbers would be additive)
- Production capacity is no longer constrained (215k annual capacity)
- Some pent-up demand from Q4 2025 suppression

**Scenario modeling:**

*Conservative (30% probability):*
- Legacy R1/EDV continues Q4 2025 run-rate: ~9,500-10,000
- Zero R2 deliveries in Q1
- Total: 9,500-10,000

*Base case (50% probability):*
- Legacy models recover modestly: 10,500-11,500
- Small R2 contribution in late March: 200-500 units
- Total: 10,700-12,000

*Optimistic (20% probability):*
- Legacy models return to Q3 2025 levels: 12,000-13,000
- Meaningful R2 ramp begins: 1,000-2,000 units
- Total: 13,000-15,000

The agent report consensus of 65-70k for full-year 2026 implies ~16,250-17,500 quarterly average, but this assumes a back-loaded year with R2 ramping. Q1 2026 would be well below this average given timing.

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:
1. **High certainty floor:** Very unlikely to fall below Q4 2025's 9,745 (10th percentile: ~9,500)
2. **Modal range:** Most likely 10,500-12,000 based on modest recovery + minimal R2
3. **Upside tail:** Small probability of 13,000-15,000+ if R2 launches early and strong
4. **Shape:** Right-skewed distribution (bounded floor, unbounded upside from R2 surprise)

Historical upset rate in EV sector is moderate-high (production delays, demand volatility), suggesting wider confidence intervals are prudent. However, Rivian has met recent guidance and R2 validation is progressing on schedule.

The hint suggests answers between 0-20,000, with my range of 9,500-15,000 sitting comfortably in the middle third of that range, which seems appropriate given current circumstances.
