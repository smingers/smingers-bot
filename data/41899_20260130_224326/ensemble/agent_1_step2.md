## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries** (multiple independent sources confirm): Establishes floor baseline for legacy R1/EDV models post-tax credit expiration
- **R2 validation units just started late January 2026** (Carscoops Jan 29): Direct causal mechanism - cannot deliver vehicles that haven't entered production yet
- **Tax credit expired Sept 30, 2025** (multiple sources): Structural policy change with demonstrated Q3→Q4 impact (-31% QoQ)
- **Full year 2025 = 42,247** (official data): Historical pattern shows quarterly average ~10,562

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Analyst consensus ~66,000 for full year 2026** (247wallst, Intellectia): Implies ~16,500 quarterly average, but distribution heavily back-loaded
- **R2 deliveries "as early as June 2026"** (Carscoops): Suggests late Q1/early Q2 timing, minimal Q1 contribution likely
- **Management says Q4 results "in line with expectations"** (Carscoops): Indicates controlled transition, not demand collapse
- **Plant capacity 215,000 annual** (Carscoops): Production constraint removed, but demand is the bottleneck

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Broader EV market down 41% in Nov 2025** (Cryptopolitan): Anecdotal monthly data, not specific to Rivian's premium segment
- **Wedbush calls 2026 "turning point"** (Intellectia): Speculative opinion without quantitative backing
- **Stock price movements** (various): Volatile short-term indicator, not predictive of deliveries

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026
- Current date: January 30, 2026
- **Days remaining: ~60 days (67% of quarter elapsed)**

**Critical timing implications:**
- Most January deliveries likely already occurred/in pipeline
- February-March = ~60 days for additional deliveries
- R2 validation just started Jan 29; typical ramp = 4-8 weeks to customer deliveries
- "As early as June" language suggests March deliveries unlikely or minimal

**If timeframe halved (45 days remaining):**
- Would increase confidence in lower bound (less time for R2 surprise)
- Narrow range to 10,000-11,500 as base case

**If timeframe doubled (Q1+Q2 2026):**
- Would significantly increase upper bound (12,000-18,000 range)
- R2 ramp would be fully captured in H1 2026
- Analyst 66,000 full-year implies ~30,000-35,000 for H1 2026

**Seasonal considerations:**
- Q1 historically weakest auto sales quarter (post-holiday, winter weather)
- But EV buyers less seasonal than ICE (fewer "model year" concerns)

## (d) Justification

**Outside view base rate:** Rivian quarterly deliveries 2024-2025 averaged 10,562-12,875

**Key factors shifting prediction:**

1. **Floor established by Q4 2025 (9,745):** Strong evidence this represents post-credit "new normal" for legacy models. Unlikely to fall below this absent production disruption.

2. **R2 timing mismatch:** Moderate-strong evidence suggests R2 customer deliveries begin late Q1 at earliest, more likely early Q2. Validation vehicles just started Jan 29. Even optimistic 6-week ramp = mid-March for first customer deliveries. Realistically contributes 0-500 units to Q1.

3. **Tax credit uncertainty:** Credit expired Sept 30, 2025, but potential reinstatement for Rivian (below 200k cumulative threshold). No evidence of actual reinstatement yet. Neutral factor.

4. **Demand environment:** Broader EV market weak (-41% Nov 2025), but Rivian's premium segment may be less affected. Management's "in line with expectations" suggests controlled transition. Slightly negative factor.

5. **Production capacity:** No longer constrained (215k annual capacity), so deliveries = demand, not supply. This shifts uncertainty from "can they build it?" to "will customers buy it?"

**Distribution shape justification:**
- **Left tail bounded:** Very unlikely <9,000 (below Q4 2025 without negative catalyst)
- **Right tail open:** R2 surprise deliveries, tax credit reinstatement, or demand recovery could push to 13,000-15,000
- **Mode:** 10,500-11,500 (modest recovery from Q4 + minimal R2)
- **Skew:** Right-skewed (bounded floor, unbounded upside from R2)

**Scenario probabilities:**
- 20%: Weak (9,000-10,000) - Q4 weakness persists, zero R2
- 50%: Base (10,000-12,000) - Modest recovery + 0-500 R2 units
- 25%: Strong (12,000-14,000) - Better recovery + 500-1,500 R2 units  
- 5%: Very strong (14,000+) - Aggressive R2 ramp + demand surge

The 66,000 full-year analyst consensus implies Q1 would be ~12-14% of annual total (8,000-9,200) if evenly distributed, but distribution is clearly back-loaded. Q1 likely represents 14-18% of full year (9,200-11,900), accounting for R2 late start.

## Probability Calibration

**Calibration against outside view:**
- Historical quarterly average (2025): 10,562
- Q4 2025 (most recent): 9,745
- Implied Q1 from 66k annual: 9,200-11,900 (assuming back-loaded year)

**My prediction should:**
1. Be anchored to Q4 2025 as floor (9,745)
2. Allow modest upside from recovery + minimal R2 (10,500-12,000 as mode)
3. Include tail risk for aggressive R2 ramp (13,000-15,000 at 90th+ percentile)
4. Respect 67% of quarter already elapsed (limits upside variance)

**Distribution construction:**
- P10: 9,500 (slight downside from Q4, 10% chance of worse environment)
- P20: 10,000 (Q4 baseline hold)
- P40: 10,700 (modest recovery begins)
- P60: 11,500 (recovery + small R2 contribution)
- P80: 12,500 (stronger recovery + meaningful R2 start)
- P90: 13,500 (optimistic recovery + 1,000+ R2 units)

**Adjustments for 67% elapsed:**
- Tighten distribution slightly (less time for surprises)
- Increase weight on 10,000-11,500 range
- Reduce P90-P99 tail (R2 ramp unlikely to accelerate dramatically in 60 days)

**Final calibration check:**
- Median (~11,000): Reasonable given Q4 base + modest improvement
- Mean (~11,200): Slightly above median due to right skew (R2 upside)
- 80% CI (10,000-12,500): Captures most realistic scenarios
- Tails (9,500 at P10, 15,000 at P99): Account for downside risk and R2 surprise

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Rivian total vehicle deliveries (all models) for Q1 2026 (Jan 1-Mar 31, 2026), in units.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Rivian quarterly deliveries 2024-2025 averaged 10,562-12,875; Q4 2025 = 9,745 establishes post-credit floor.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 11,000; mean ≈ 11,300. Makes sense: modest recovery from Q4 2025 base (9,745) + minimal R2 contribution, aligned with 67% quarter elapsed and validation vehicles just starting.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries establishes floor (strong, multiple sources)
   - R2 validation units started Jan 29, 2026; deliveries "as early as June" (strong, Carscoops)
   - Tax credit expired Sept 30, 2025, caused Q3→Q4 drop (strong, policy change)
   - Analyst consensus ~66k for full 2026, implies back-loaded year (moderate, Intellectia/247wallst)
   - 67% of Q1 already elapsed, limits variance (strong, calendar fact)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** R2 production ramp dramatically accelerates with Rivian delivering 2,000-3,000 R2 units in March (early reservations fulfilled rapidly). This would push outcome to 13,000-14,000, making my forecast look conservative. Direction: UP.
