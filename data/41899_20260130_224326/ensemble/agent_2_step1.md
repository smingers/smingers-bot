Analysis:

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Rivian's quarterly delivery pattern in 2025:**
   - Q1-Q4 2025: Not all quarters disclosed individually, but full year = 42,247
   - Average per quarter: ~10,562
   - Suitability: Medium - reflects recent operational reality but doesn't account for R2 launch

2. **Rivian's Q1 performance historically:**
   - Limited data available; typically Q1 is seasonally weaker in auto industry
   - Suitability: Low - insufficient historical Q1 data for Rivian specifically

3. **Legacy vehicle production (R1/EDV) in transition year with new model launch:**
   - 2025 run-rate suggests ~40k annual legacy deliveries
   - Q1 2026 legacy baseline: ~10,000 vehicles
   - Suitability: High for legacy vehicles only

4. **New EV model launch ramps (industry comparables):**
   - Tesla Model 3, Model Y early quarters showed slow initial ramps
   - First full quarter often delivers 1,000-5,000 units
   - Suitability: Medium - useful for R2 component but each launch differs

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026
- Today is January 30, 2026 - we're already 30 days into the quarter
- 60 days remaining until quarter end

**Key timing factors:**

1. **R2 delivery timeline:** Multiple sources confirm "end of Q1 or beginning of Q2" for first deliveries
   - Validation units just started rolling out (late January 2026)
   - Manufacturing validation → certification → first customer deliveries typically takes 6-10 weeks
   - Most likely scenario: 0-500 R2 deliveries in Q1, with volume starting in Q2

2. **Legacy vehicle production:**
   - Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 vehicles
   - Q3 2025 delivered 13,201 vehicles (inflated by tax credit deadline)
   - Without tax credit and in typical Q1 seasonal weakness, expect closer to Q4 levels or slightly lower

3. **Tax credit impact:**
   - Federal credit expired Sept 30, 2025
   - Q4 showed 31% YoY decline, attributed to this expiration
   - Q1 2026 will be first full quarter without the credit for most buyers
   - Agent report notes potential legislative exception for Rivian (sub-200k sales), but no confirmation this is active

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Base case reasoning:**

The most relevant reference class is Rivian's recent quarterly delivery performance, adjusted for known factors:

1. **Legacy vehicle baseline (R1T/R1S/EDV):** 
   - Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries
   - Q1 typically sees seasonal weakness (post-holiday, weather)
   - No tax credit headwind worsening (already reflected in Q4)
   - Expect: 8,000-10,000 legacy deliveries

2. **R2 contribution in Q1 2026:**
   - Validation units just started (late January)
   - "End of Q1 or beginning Q2" guidance suggests minimal Q1 volume
   - Best case: 200-500 units if deliveries start in late March
   - Most likely: 0-100 units (primarily to employees/insiders)
   - Conservative estimate: 0-200 R2 deliveries

3. **Combined Q1 2026 estimate:**
   - Conservative: 8,000 legacy + 0 R2 = 8,000
   - Base: 9,000 legacy + 100 R2 = 9,100
   - Optimistic: 10,000 legacy + 500 R2 = 10,500

**Risk factors:**

- **Downside risks:** Production disruptions, continued demand weakness, R2 delays pushing all deliveries to Q2
- **Upside risks:** Stronger-than-expected legacy demand, earlier R2 ramp, tax credit reinstatement

**Analyst consensus check:**
- Full year 2026 consensus: 65k-70k deliveries
- If evenly distributed: ~16k-17k per quarter
- BUT Q1 will be heavily weighted toward legacy vehicles; R2 ramp occurs later
- Q1 should be well below quarterly average: 8k-11k range is reasonable

Outside view calibration:

Given the analysis above, I need to construct a distribution that:

1. **Centers around 9,000-10,000 deliveries** (legacy vehicle baseline with minimal R2)
2. **Accounts for significant uncertainty** in both legacy demand and R2 timing
3. **Respects the hint range** of 0-20,000 but recognizes most probability mass should be in lower half
4. **Allows for tail scenarios:**
   - Downside: Severe production issues or demand collapse → 5,000-7,000
   - Upside: Aggressive early R2 push or unexpectedly strong legacy → 12,000-14,000

**Distribution construction:**

The distribution should be roughly normal but slightly right-skewed (upside from potential R2 surprise).

- **10th percentile:** Conservative scenario - weak legacy demand, no R2 deliveries, possible disruptions → 7,000
- **20th percentile:** Below-average legacy performance, no meaningful R2 → 8,000
- **40th percentile:** Slightly below base case, minimal R2 → 9,000
- **60th percentile:** Base case with small R2 contribution → 9,800
- **80th percentile:** Strong legacy quarter, modest R2 start → 11,000
- **90th percentile:** Very strong performance, earlier R2 ramp → 12,500

This distribution:
- Centers median around 9,400 (between 40th and 60th percentiles)
- Provides 80% confidence interval of 7,000-11,000
- Allows for reasonable tails without extreme values
- Reflects that Q1 is a transition quarter with limited R2 impact

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7000
Percentile 20: 8000
Percentile 40: 9000
Percentile 60: 9800
Percentile 80: 11000
Percentile 90: 12500
