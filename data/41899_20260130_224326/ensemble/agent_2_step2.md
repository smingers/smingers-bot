Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources (Pre-January 30, 2026):**

1. **Morningstar (Jan 5, 2026)** - High quality. Reports Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries (-31% YoY); FY 2025: 42,284 deliveries (-18% YoY). Expert opinion from CFA analyst expects lower H1 2026 volumes during R2 ramp, growth in H2. Factual data reliable; forward opinion is qualified expert view.

2. **Intellectia.ai (promotional content)** - Medium quality. Confirms Q3 2025: ~18,000 deliveries; projects ~66,000 deliveries for full 2026. Mix of factual historical data and aggregated analyst opinions without clear attribution.

3. **Tridens Technology (Jan 15, 2026)** - High quality for historical data. Confirms FY 2025: 42,247 deliveries. Notes factory shutdown for R2/R3 retooling affected 2025 production. Factual reporting of official figures.

4. **Electrek on Lucid (Jan 5, 2026)** - Tangential relevance. Shows competitor Lucid delivered 5,345 in Q4 2025 (+73% YoY), contrasting with Rivian's decline. Useful for competitive context.

5. **CBT News (Oct 2, 2025)** - Medium quality. Q3 2025: 13,201 deliveries (+32% sequential), attributed to tax credit rush before Sept 30 expiration. Demonstrates demand volatility around incentives.

6. **RivianTrackr (Jan 2, 2026)** - High quality. Confirms official Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries, 10,974 production. Notes tax credit expiration as headwind.

**Current Context (AskNews Articles, Jan 28-30, 2026):**

7. **Motley Fool (Jan 30, 2026)** - Medium-high quality. States 2025 guidance was 40,000-46,000 deliveries (actual: 42,247). Projects 66,000 deliveries for full 2026 (analyst consensus). No Q1 2026 specific guidance.

8. **CNET/Carscoops (Jan 29-30, 2026)** - High quality for production timing. **Critical fact**: R2 validation vehicles on production line; customer deliveries expected "as early as June 2026." Plant capacity: 215,000 annual (155,000 allocated to R2).

9. **Parameter (Jan 29, 2026)** - Medium quality. Confirms stock decline, notes Q4 2025 below some analyst expectations. R2 launch scheduled "first half of 2026" with potential margin pressure.

10. **ETAuto/Cryptopolitan (Jan 2-3, 2026)** - High quality for recent data. Q4 2025 deliveries: 9,745 (vs. analyst estimate of 10,050). Emphasizes tax credit expiration impact and R2 as critical for 2026 recovery.

**Key Factual Findings:**
- Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries (confirmed across multiple sources)
- Q3 2025: 13,201 deliveries (pre-tax credit expiration)
- FY 2025: 42,247 deliveries
- R2 first deliveries: "end of Q1 or early Q2" per latest sources
- No official Q1 2026 guidance issued
- Analyst consensus for full 2026: ~66,000 deliveries

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Tax credit cliff effect**: Multiple independent sources confirm Sept 2025 expiration caused Q4 decline from 13,201 → 9,745 (-26%). This structural change removes ~$7,500 incentive, creating sustained demand headwind. Q3 showed artificial pull-forward; Q4 represents new baseline demand.

2. **R2 production timing**: Multiple sources (Carscoops, CNET, Parameter) confirm validation units on line with deliveries "June 2026" or "end of Q1/early Q2." This strongly suggests minimal Q1 2026 R2 contribution (likely 0-500 units maximum).

3. **Production capacity constraint**: Q4 2025 production of 10,974 with 9,745 deliveries shows ~1,200 inventory build. Normal plant operating near current capacity for R1 models during R2 transition.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Seasonal patterns**: U.S. auto sales typically weaker in Q1 (post-holiday). Historical Rivian Q1 performance: Q1 2024 likely ~11,000-12,000 based on FY patterns.

2. **Analyst full-year estimate of 66,000**: If distributed evenly, implies ~16,500/quarter. However, Morningstar explicitly states "lower volumes in H1" during R2 ramp, suggesting Q1 below this average.

3. **Inventory dynamics**: ~1,200 unit build in Q4 2025 provides modest buffer for Q1 deliveries exceeding production.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Competitive dynamics**: Lucid's Q4 surge and Tesla's Model S/X discontinuation are tangential; don't directly predict Rivian Q1 volumes.

2. **Stock price movements**: Reflect sentiment but not predictive of deliveries.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Q1 2026 ends March 31, 2026 (60 days from now). Results reported ~30 days later (early May 2026).

**Timeframe Sensitivity:**
- **If halved (30 days to Q1 end)**: Would increase uncertainty about R2 contribution; production ramp trajectory less clear. Might widen confidence intervals by 15-20%.
  
- **If doubled (120 days, covering Q1+Q2)**: Would dramatically increase expected deliveries due to full R2 ramp in Q2. Combined Q1+Q2 estimate would be ~25,000-30,000 (Q1: 10,000-12,000; Q2: 15,000-18,000).

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- R2 deliveries timing is binary: either late March (200-500 units) or April onward (0 units in Q1)
- Tax credit absence is persistent throughout Q1
- No scheduled factory shutdowns in Q1 2026
- 60-day window limits ability to recover from slow start

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Baseline**: 11,500 vehicles (range: 7,500-15,000 at 10th-90th percentiles)

**Adjustment Factors:**

1. **Tax Credit Structural Headwind (-10% to -15%)**: The Q3→Q4 drop from 13,201 to 9,745 (-26%) was partially artificial (Q3 had pull-forward). However, the loss of $7,500 incentive is permanent. Q4 2025 represents new demand baseline for R1 models. This suggests Q1 baseline closer to 10,000 than 11,500 for R1-only sales.

2. **R2 Minimal Contribution (+0 to +800 units)**: Latest sources indicate "June 2026" or "end of Q1/early Q2" for first deliveries. Conservative estimate: 200-500 R2 deliveries in late March if aggressive ramp; 0 if production validation extends into April. Expected value: ~300 units.

3. **Inventory Release (+500 to +1,000 units)**: Q4 built 1,229 inventory units (10,974 production - 9,745 deliveries). Some portion likely delivered in Q1, partially offsetting lower production during R2 line conversion.

4. **Seasonal Weakness (-5% to -10%)**: Q1 historically softer for auto sales. However, Rivian's delivery-driven model (less dealer inventory) may dampen this effect.

5. **Production Transition Friction (-500 units)**: R2 line conversion may temporarily reduce R1 output as factory reconfigures. Morningstar explicitly warned of "lower H1 volumes."

**Net Adjustment**: The outside view of 11,500 appears slightly optimistic. The tax credit loss is a permanent structural change that reset demand baseline to ~9,700 (Q4 2025 level). Adding modest inventory release (+700), minimal R2 contribution (+300), and seasonal/transition friction (-500) yields adjusted center around 10,200 vehicles.

**Distribution Shape**: The uncertainty remains high due to:
- Unknown exact R2 delivery start date (could be 0 or 700 units)
- Unclear demand elasticity post-tax credit
- Production line transition risks

However, hard constraints exist:
- **Floor**: ~7,000 (catastrophic production issues or demand collapse)
- **Ceiling**: ~14,000 (requires strong R1 demand recovery + significant R2 contribution + full inventory release)

## Probability Calibration

**Central Tendency**: 10,200 vehicles (median)

**Reasoning**:
- Q4 2025 baseline: 9,745 deliveries represents post-tax credit demand floor for R1
- Inventory buffer: +700 units from Q4 build
- Early R2 trickle: +300 units (conservative, assumes late-March start)
- Production/seasonal friction: -500 units
- Net: 10,200 vehicles

**Distribution Construction**:

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) because:
1. R2 could surprise with earlier/faster ramp (upside)
2. Demand floor is more certain than ceiling
3. Production capacity limits extreme upside

**Percentile Calibration**:
- **1st percentile (7,000)**: Severe production disruption or demand collapse. Requires R1 sales dropping 25% below Q4 AND no R2 deliveries AND inventory not released. Probability ~1%.

- **10th percentile (8,500)**: Weak scenario. R1 demand continues softening to ~8,000, minimal inventory release (+300), zero R2 deliveries. Represents pessimistic but plausible outcome.

- **25th percentile (9,300)**: Below-baseline scenario. R1 at Q4 levels (~9,700), small inventory release (+200), no R2 contribution, some production friction (-600).

- **Median (10,200)**: Central estimate as justified above.

- **75th percentile (11,500)**: Above-baseline scenario. R1 demand stabilizes at 9,700, full inventory release (+1,000), modest R2 contribution (+600), minimal friction.

- **90th percentile (13,000)**: Optimistic scenario. R1 demand rebounds slightly to 10,500, full inventory (+1,000), strong R2 ramp (+1,500), smooth transition.

- **99th percentile (15,500)**: Very optimistic. Requires R1 demand recovery + aggressive R2 ramp (2,000+ units) + full inventory release. Near production capacity limits.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries reported for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), in units.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 11,500 vehicles; adjusted to 10,200 based on structural tax credit loss resetting demand baseline to Q4 2025 levels (~9,700) plus modest inventory/R2 additions.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 10,200; mean ≈ 10,500 (slight right skew). Aligns with Q4 2025 baseline (9,745) + small positive adjustments. Reasonable given transition period.

4. **Key evidence influencing forecast**:
   - Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 (post-tax credit baseline)
   - R2 deliveries expected "June 2026" or late Q1 (minimal Q1 contribution)
   - 1,229 inventory units built in Q4 available for Q1 release
   - Morningstar expert expects "lower H1 2026 volumes" during ramp
   - No official Q1 guidance; analyst full-year consensus ~66,000 implies uneven quarterly distribution

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: R2 production validation completes faster than expected, enabling 1,500-2,000 early deliveries in March. This would push outcome to 11,500-12,000 (upside). Alternatively, production line conversion causes more R1 disruption than anticipated, dropping deliveries to 8,000-8,500 (downside). Upside scenario slightly more likely given management's conservative guidance history.
