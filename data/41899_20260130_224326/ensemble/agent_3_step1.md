Analysis:
• Source Analysis:
  – Reddit Q3 2025 summary (dated late 2025) reports a high-delivery quarter (13,201 vehicles) but is based on a community post summarizing official figures. It provides a useful reference for legacy vehicle delivery volumes.
  – The EV.com/Proactive investors/other news articles on Q4 2025 (from early January 2026 and late 2025) consistently report Q4 deliveries around 9,700–10,000 vehicles. They also document the impact of the federal tax-credit expiration, which pulled demand into Q3 2025 and depressed Q4.
  – The Nasdaq article (dated January 28, 2026) and the Agent Report offer detailed context on the R2 launch. They note that while the R2 “validation” and production builds are underway and first customer deliveries are scheduled for early-to-mid 2026, deliveries are “likely to start at the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter.”
  – The Agent Report further outlines consensus expectations for 2026 annual totals (roughly 65k–70k vehicles) and breaks down that legacy (R1/EDV) models are expected to remain at about 40k units for the year, with the R2 ramp contributing the balance. Because the R2 production ramp is anticipated to start around April 2026, Q1 will likely be weighted heavily toward legacy models.

• Reference Class Analysis:
  – One suitable reference class is Rivian’s quarterly performance in 2025 (with Q3 at roughly 13k and Q4 at roughly 10k deliveries). Given that Q4’s number reflects a more run-rate level when incentives had taken a toll and before the new R2 catch-up, this class provides a baseline for legacy deliveries.
  – Another reference class is other EV makers’ early production runs when launching a new, lower-priced platform. Those cases typically show a modest start in the launch quarter with most of the annual ramp deferred to later quarters.
  – Combining these, the most suitable reference for Q1 2026 is the legacy volume run rate (about 10k per quarter) plus a potential small addition from an early R2 launch if it starts before the quarter ends.

• Timeframe Analysis:
  – We are forecasting Q1 2026 deliveries as of January 30, 2026. Q1 runs from January 1 to March 31, so about two months remain in the quarter.
  – Historical quarterly patterns in 2025 suggest that without a full ramp of a new model, Q1 (or a transitional quarter) might be lower than quarters with full production of established models.

• Justification:
  – Based on the legacy model’s running pace (roughly 40k annually, or about 10k per quarter) and given that Q4 2025 ended at around 9,700 units, Q1 2026 is likely to show a similar level from legacy models.
  – The R2 midsize SUV is scheduled to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026. However, consensus and the Nasdaq article indicate that deliveries from the new R2 may only appear at the very end of Q1 or may predominantly come in Q2. Therefore, only a modest bonus (if any) would be expected in Q1.
  – In a conservative scenario, Q1 2026 deliveries might solely reflect legacy performance, while an upside scenario would see a brief run of early R2 deliveries pushing total Q1 deliveries somewhat higher.
  – Given the relatively high uncertainty during a model ramp transition—and noting that historical EV ramp launches can be later-than-anticipated—a true probability distribution should reasonably span a range from around 9,000 (if no R2 volumes materialize in Q1) up to 15,000 vehicles (if early R2 deliveries contribute materially).

Outside view calibration:
  – We tie our prediction roughly to the historical quarterly data from 2025 and adjust for the announced R2 launch.
  – Small shifts in when the R2 deliveries begin (end of Q1 vs. start of Q2) could alter the distribution’s tails.
  – Historically, EV manufacturers experience “upset” dynamics around a new model launch – with early production hiccups and ramp uncertainty. Thus, a wide 90% confidence interval is warranted.
  – Given that our reference classes and expert comments trend toward a legacy baseline of about 10k vehicles per quarter and minimal R2 contribution in Q1, we adjust our distribution so that the median is a modest 12,000 vehicles, with a 10th percentile at about 9,000 and a 90th percentile at 15,000.
