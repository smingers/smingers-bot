Analysis:
We are forecasting Rivian’s total vehicle deliveries (all models) for Q1 2026. Our sources indicate that in Q4 2025 Rivian delivered 9745 vehicles (Tridens, RivianTrackr, CBT News). Historical Q1 performance for legacy models (R1T, R1S, EDV) tends to be a bit lower than the high Q3 surge seen during the tax‑credit rush. Now, with the federal EV tax credit having expired last September, Q4 2025 was already depressed by about 31% compared with Q3. For Q1 2026 we expect the legacy vehicle baseline to roughly mirror Q4 (around 9000–10000 vehicles), but note that the R2 midsize SUV—Rivian’s new model with production set to ramp up—is only expected to begin delivering near the very end of the quarter (or perhaps spill into early Q2). Thus, its contribution in Q1 will likely be minimal (perhaps only a few dozen to a few hundred vehicles). Overall, our reference class (using Q4’s 9745 as a baseline, adjusted for seasonal weakness and the slow start of the new product) leads us to a median in the high 9000 to low 10000 range.

Let’s summarize key source points:
• Morningstar and RivianTrackr both report Q4 2025 deliveries of about 9745 vehicles, with full‑year 2025 in the low-to-mid 42000 range.
• Articles from CBT News and Tridens note that the drop was partly due to the expiration of tax credits and a planned production retooling (for the upcoming R2 and R3).
• Analyst and media reports (Motley Fool, Carscoops) note that the R2 production ramp is scheduled but will not significantly contribute in Q1 2026.
• Opinions from several outlets stress that while overall 2026 deliveries might be projected (by some analysts) near 65000 for the year, the first quarter will be light as the new model’s ramp is meager.

Evaluating evidence:
– Strong evidence: Q4 2025 delivery numbers from multiple independent sources; clear causal explanation (tax credit expiration, production retooling).
– Moderate evidence: Analyst commentary on the R2 launch timing and its slow ramp in early 2026.
– Weak evidence: Anecdotal hints from promotional articles whose optimistic language may overstate the early R2 impact.
Our weighting thus centers our view on legacy deliveries (around 9000–10000) while allowing for minimal upsides (if R2 starts early and adds a few hundred).

Timeframe analysis:
Prediction timeframe: Q1 2026 (January 1 through March 31, 2026). Today is January 30, so roughly 60 days remain in the quarter. If the time window were halved (i.e. only January–mid‑February), we would expect deliveries even lower (perhaps closer to the Q4 level or slightly below); if doubled (an entire quarter plus extra time), the cumulative delivery total would be higher—so our short‑term prediction remains focused on the current quarter’s transitional dynamics.

Justification:
Considering the available evidence, the base rate is set by Q4’s nearly 9700 deliveries. We adjust downward slightly for typical Q1 (seasonal weakness and post‑holiday slowdown) and upward modestly for any R2 deliveries in the final weeks. Therefore, our outside view predicts a median in the vicinity of 9800 vehicles. The range reflects risks such as production disruptions (pushing numbers toward 6000–7000 in a downside scenario) or an unexpectedly strong early R2 and legacy rebound (raising totals to perhaps 12500–15000 in extreme cases). The historical trends and published Q4 numbers are our most reliable anchors.

Probability calibration:
Based on the factors and evidence, our best estimate centers around 9800 deliveries with considerable probability mass between about 8000 and 11000. There is an 80% confidence interval roughly between 7000 (low extreme in a severe downturn) and 11000 (if legacy performs well and R2 starts modestly). The tail risks – if production problems materialize or if R2 is delayed further – could push the low end to around 6000, while an early and vigorous R2 launch combined with an unusually strong legacy recovery might raise the high end to near 15000.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries (vehicles) for Q1 2026.
2. Outside view base rate: Q4 2025 deliveries (~9745) adjusted for Q1 seasonal effects and R2 ramp.
3. Consistency check: Implied median = 9800 vehicles; mean likely similar. This aligns with the justification.
4. Top evidence:
   - Q4 2025 deliveries at 9745 (multiple high‐quality sources).
   - Minimal expected Q1 R2 contribution (reliably reported by Carscoops and others).
   - Expected seasonal slowdown in Q1.
5. Blind-spot: A rapid, unexpected ramp in R2 deliveries (pushing totals significantly above forecast) would push the number upward.
