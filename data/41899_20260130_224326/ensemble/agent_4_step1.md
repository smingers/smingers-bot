Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Reddit summary of Rivian Q3-2025 results (posted Oct-25).  Factual nuggets: 13 ,201 deliveries in Q3-25; highest quarter that year.  Quality: medium—community post but numbers match Rivian IR deck released the same day.  
2. EV.com article on Q4-25 deliveries (6 Jan 26).  Gives 9 ,745 deliveries and 10 ,974 production for Q4-25, plus the “tax-credit pull-forward” explanation.  Source cites Rivian press release; judged high quality.  
3. Nasdaq / Motley-Fool note (28 Jan 26).  Confirms 9 ,745 Q4-25 and 42 ,247 full-year deliveries; adds analyst consensus of ≈66 k deliveries for full-year 2026.  Quality: good for backward data, medium for forward opinions.  
4. RivianTrackr (15 Jan 26).  Re-states the official FY-25 totals (42 ,247 deliveries) and quarterly production figures; quality high—numbers taken from Rivian SEC 8-K.  
5. “Finally, the Moment Rivian Investors …” (Motley Fool, 24 Jan 26).  Purely qualitative: R2 validation units are now on line; customer deliveries expected “end of Q1 or early Q2 26”.  Good for timing colour.  
6. Agent_report (synthesis through 27 Jan 26).  Compiles management commentary from Q3-25 call and street models (65 k–70 k deliveries for full-year 2026).  Useful for consensus framing; not primary data.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Two candidate classes:  
• Rivian’s own quarterly delivery history (8 quarters since Q1-24).  
• Other U.S. EV start-ups in the first full year before a new-model launch (Tesla Model 3 in 2017, Lucid Air Pure in 2023, etc.).  
Because company-specific production constraints and tax-credit dynamics matter most here, I adopt “Rivian-quarter” as the main reference class.  Mean of the last four quarters = 10 ,900; σ ≈ 1 ,700.

c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 61 days from the end of Q1 and ~90 days from when Rivian will disclose the number.  Quarter-to-quarter moves for Rivian have stayed within ±3,500 units (≈30 %) except for the Q3 pull-forward.  No factory shutdown is scheduled in Q1 26, and R2 saleable production is guided to start late in the quarter.

d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Status-quo (no R2) delivery rate: take Q4-25 production (10 ,974) plus the 1 ,200-vehicle inventory build as evidence Normal can output ~11 k sellable units in a steady quarter.  
Demand headwinds: loss of the federal credit after Sept-25 appears to have lopped roughly 3 k units off sequential demand (13.2 k → 9.7 k).  That demand level probably persists into Q1.  
Upside factors:  
• A modest release of R1 inventory (~1 k).  
• First trickle of R2 deliveries—management says “end of Q1”; assume 300-700 units hand-over.  
Downside factors:  
• Seasonality (U.S. auto Q1 often softer).  
• Any further macro EV slowdown.

Putting these together, I peg the outside-view centre at 11 ,500 vehicles with a plausible 80 % range of roughly ±3 ,500.

Outside view calibration:
I model deliveries as Normal(11 ,500; σ = 2 ,000) but trim the tails at 5 ,000 and 18 ,000 to respect physical capacity (≈18 k is the plant’s single-quarter max).  Converting that to percentiles and rounding to the nearest 100:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7,500  
Percentile 20: 8,900  
Percentile 40: 10,400  
Percentile 60: 11,600  
Percentile 80: 13,400  
Percentile 90: 15,000
