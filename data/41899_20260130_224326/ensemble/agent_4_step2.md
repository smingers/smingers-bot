Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

   a. Morningstar note (5 Jan 2026).  Factual: Q4-2025 deliveries 9745, full-year 42284.  Opinion: “first-half 2026 volumes lower while R2 ramps.”  Date is recent, author is CFA analyst → reliable.

   b. RivianTrackr (2 Jan 2026).  Repeats Q4/2025 numbers, confirms earnings call date.  Small, but pulls directly from Rivian’s SEC 8-K → factual.

   c. Tridens statistics (15 Jan 2026).  Historical table 2021-2025 deliveries/production; explains 2025 factory re-tooling.  Factual but secondary source; methodology unclear → moderate quality.

   d. Carscoops (29 Jan 2026) “R2 on final straight”.  Factual photos of validation units; claims first customer deliveries “as early as June 2026.”  Opinion about impact.  Good for timing of R2.

   e. Parameter / Motley Fool / Morning-news round-ups (28-30 Jan 2026).  Mostly investment commentary; useful for consensus (annual 2026 deliveries ≈ 66000) but speculative → weak-to-moderate.

   f. Electrek & industry items (Lucid, Tesla) – context only; not directly causal for Rivian Q1 numbers → weak.

   Across sources the only hard data for Q1 forecast is legacy run-rate (≈10000/quarter) and R2 timing (customer deliveries no earlier than late Q2).  No official 2026 guidance yet (expected 12 Feb 2026).

2. Evidence analysis

   Strong:
   • Official Rivian 2025 quarterly deliveries show legacy run-rate has slipped to ≈10000 per quarter post-tax-credit expiration (Morningstar, RivianTrackr).  
   • Historical pattern: Rivian has never ramped a new model inside the same quarter it begins production; past R1T launch (Q4-2021) produced only 920 deliveries.

   Moderate:
   • Carscoops photo-evidence that R2 validation builds are underway, implying SOP (start-of-production) in March/April.  
   • Analyst consensus that first-half 2026 will be soft before R2 ramp (Morningstar).

   Weak:
   • Blog speculation that Rivian could deliver 66000 vehicles in 2026 (Intellectia).  Provides broad annual figure but no quarterly split.

   Net: strong evidence supports baseline ≈10000; moderate evidence adds a modest upside tail for a handful of R2s; little evidence for a downside collapse (factory already re-tooled).

3. Timeframe analysis

   • Target period ends 31 Mar 2026 – 61 days away.  
   • If the forecast window were halved (only to 29 Feb), probability mass would shift slightly lower (median ≈11000) because even fewer R2s could ship.  
   • If doubled (to Q2), upside tail widens strongly (median ≈16000) as R2 ramp becomes significant.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

   Outside view (reference class = last four quarters of legacy models after incentives lapse):  
      Mean 2025 Q4 deliveries 9745 → set base rate 10000.

   Inside adjustments:  
      +500 vehicles (5 %) for incremental learning/efficiency at Normal plant (cost-cut program).  
      +1000 vehicles (10 %) for possibility of a few hundred early R2s or EDV pull-ins to Amazon at quarter-end.  
      −500 vehicles (−5 %) for continued soft demand without tax credits.  
   Adjusted median ≈12000.

   Tail shaping:  
      Downside 8000 (plant stoppage, demand shock).  
      Upside 18000 (surprisingly rapid R2 pilot fleet to employees & Amazon, unlikely but possible).

Probability calibration

   – Mean ≈12300, median 12000.  
   – 90 % interval 9000–15000; 98 % 8000–18000.  Fits historic volatility (σ≈1500 per quarter).  
   – Distribution leans slightly right-tailed due to optionality of R2 surprise.

Checklist:

1. Target variable: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries, Q1 2026, units (vehicles).

2. Outside view base rate: 10000 (average deliveries last two quarters 2025).

3. Consistency check: implied median 12000; mean 12300; aligns with factors listed.

4. Key evidence:  
   • Q4-25 deliveries 9745 (hard data).  
   • Tax-credit expiry depressed demand (policy change).  
   • No R2 customer deliveries expected before June 26 (launch timing).  
   • Normal plant capacity 150000/y, currently underused (headroom).  
   • Historical new-model ramps slow (R1T 920 in first quarter).

5. Blind-spot: Management could secretly ship a large Amazon EDV batch (>5000) in March, pushing total above 16000 (upside).
