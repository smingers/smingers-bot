Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Reddit summary of Rivian’s Q3-25 results (13 Jan 2026 post, data from Rivian IR).  Factual: 13 ,201 Q3 deliveries, record for 2025.  Quality: medium – secondary source but numbers match IR slide deck released 8 Nov 2025.  
2. EV.com article on Q4-25 (4 Jan 2026).  Factual: 9 ,745 Q4 deliveries, -31 % YoY; expiration of US tax credit 30 Sep 2025 pulled demand into Q3.  Quality: good – cites SEC 8-K. Opinion about being “in-line” is management spin.  
3. Nasdaq/Motley Fool (28 Jan 2026).  Factual: Validation R2 units now coming off Normal, Ill. line; first customer deliveries “end Q1 or early Q2 26”.  Quality: good—quotes COO Frank Klein from Detroit Auto Show interview.  Forward-looking numbers (66 k FY-26 consensus) are analyst opinions.  
4. RivianTrackr (15 Jan 2026).  Factual: 2025 totals 42 ,247 deliveries; reiterates Q4 figure; notes two 2025 production shutdowns for R2 tooling. Quality: good—site scrapes Rivian filings.  
5. Agent report (compiled 29 Jan 2026).  Synthesises call transcripts & analyst notes.  Factual takeaways: no official 2026 delivery guidance; Normal plant capacity lifted to 215 k; R2 H1-26 launch. Quality: high – primary-source cross-checking is transparent, though still a secondary summary.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. Rivian’s own quarter-to-quarter delivery history (best fit; same firm, same models).  
2. Other US EV start-ups during a new-model ramp (Lucid, Fisker) – less suitable; product cadence and scale differ.  
3. Mature OEMs launching an EV refresh – far too large and diversified.  
Chosen class: Rivian quarterly deliveries (2023-2025), adjusted for known demand shock (tax credit sunset) and upcoming but uncertain R2 trickle.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast horizon: end of Q1 2026 result will be published ~3 Apr 2026 → 64 days from today.  
• Historical pattern (Rivian consumer + EDV):  
  – 2024 average per quarter ≈ 12 ,900 (51 ,500 ÷ 4).  
  – 2025: Q1≈? , Q2≈? , Q3 13 ,201, Q4 9 ,745.  Using FY total, Q1+Q2 sum 19 ,301 → simple split 9 ,650 each.  
  – Seasonality weak; policy incentives caused one-time spike Q3 2025 then pull-back Q4.  
• Lead indicators for Q1-26: no tax credit in force; reservation backlog for R1 unclear; economic backdrop is flat.  Production is unconstrained (Normal capable of 50-60 k per quarter).  Demand, not capacity, is binding.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
1. Status-quo demand (R1S/T + EDV) looks roughly equal to Q4-25 (9 ,745) because the credit headwind persists and no major marketing catalyst arrives before April.  
2. R2 contribution: management goal “deliveries end of Q1”.  Historically, Tesla Model 3 (2017) and Ford F-150 Lightning (2022) shipped <500 units in their first quarter of customer hand-offs.  Applying that reference, expectation is 0–800 R2 units in Q1 with modal ≈300.  
3. Therefore baseline central estimate: 9 ,745 + 300 ≈ 10 ,000.  
4. Upside risks:  
   • Faster-than-expected R2 regulatory approvals, could lift R2 to ~2 ,000 units → headline ≈12 ,000.  
   • Fleets (Amazon EDV) pull forward deliveries to offset 2025 shortfall.  
5. Downside risks:  
   • R2 slips to Q2 ⇒ zero new-model volume.  
   • Consumer demand softens further in absence of incentive ⇒ R1 deliveries dip to ~7 ,500.  
   • Any production hiccup during R2/legacy line coexistence.

Outside view calibration:

Chosen distribution: Log-normal-ish but expressed by empirical percentiles.  I anchor the median at 10 ,500 (slightly above baseline to reflect mild probability of small R2 lift) and allow a two-tailed 80 % CI of roughly ±3 ,000 vehicles.  Tail probability of extreme miss (<6 ,000 or >15 ,000) judged at ~5 % each based on historical upset frequency for Rivian (one quarter in eight has delivered outside ±35 % band).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7,000  
Percentile 20: 8,000  
Percentile 40: 9,500  
Percentile 60: 10,500  
Percentile 80: 12,500  
Percentile 90: 14,000
