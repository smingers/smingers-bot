Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, all dates ≤ 30 Jan 2026)  
1. Morningstar note (05 Jan 2026).  Factual Q4-25 and FY-25 delivery numbers; opinion on valuation.  Reliable, analyst-authored, SEC filings cited → high quality.  
2. RivianTrackr (02 Jan 2026).  Mirrors Rivian 8-K; gives identical Q4/FY delivery figures and plant commentary.  Data-driven blog that links primary filings → good quality corroboration.  
3. Tridens stats post (15 Jan 2026).  Historical annual production/deliveries; reason for 2025 production shut-down.  Numbers match SEC filings → moderate quality.  
4. CBT News (02 Oct 2025) & Investing.com Italia (29 Sep 2025).  Q3-25 delivery surge (13201) and management comment that Q3 would be peak quarter.  Uses Rivian press release → reliable historical context.  
5. Carscoops / newsyou.info (29 Jan 2026).  Reports first R2 validation units off Normal line; target “customers by June 2026”.  Quotes COO Frank Klein – primary interview → moderate-to-strong for timing but still forward-looking.  
6. Parameter & other stock-commentary pieces (29-30 Jan 2026).  Re-assert no 2026 guidance before 12 Feb earnings.  Opinion heavy; factual elements = “no guidance issued” → weak-to-moderate evidentiary weight.  
7. Electrek Lucid article (05 Jan 2026).  Only shows peer market softness; indirect evidence → weak for the target variable.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)  
Strong evidence  
• Two independent SEC-based sources agree Q4-25 deliveries = 9745 vehicles (Morningstar, RivianTrackr).  
• Rivian has historically delivered roughly 9–13 k vehicles per quarter for eight consecutive quarters (2024-25).  
Moderate evidence  
• Management/COO quotes that R2 customer deliveries begin “end Q1 or early Q2 26”; validation units already built (Carscoops).  
• Factory re-tooling for R2 finished; Normal plant capacity up to 215000, so production is not the constraint (Tridens, RivianTrackr).  
• Expiration of US $7500 tax credit in Sep 2025 materially hurt Q4 demand and persists into Q1 26 (Morningstar, CBT).  
Weak evidence  
• Analyst compilation claiming 66000 FY-26 deliveries (Intellectia).  
• General EV-market malaise articles (Electrek, Parameter).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 92 days (01 May 2026 publication of Q1 10-Q).  If horizon were halved (46 days), almost no new information on R2 ramp would emerge → forecast variance would widen slightly.  If doubled (184 days), the actual figure would already be known, collapsing uncertainty to zero.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate = median of last four quarters (Q2-Q4 25 + est Q1 25) ≈ 10000 deliveries.  
Shifters downward  
• Ongoing demand drag from lapsed tax credit; Q4 25 fell 31 % YoY.  
• No price cuts announced pre-earnings; macro EV demand still weak.  
Shifters upward  
• Even a token R2 launch could add 100–2000 vehicles.  
• Amazon EDV contract may pull some fleet deliveries back to normal seasonal level (~2000/qtr vs ~1200 in Q4).  
Net: central estimate 10500 vehicles, slightly above the Q4 trough but well below 2024 quarterly norms.  Uncertainty: R2 timing, fleet pull-forward, possible additional demand slide.  90 %-CI chosen as 7000–15000 (wide enough for a zero-R2 scenario on the low end and a small but brisk R2 mini-ramp on the high end).

Probability calibration

Mean ≈ 10900; median 10500.  Right tail slightly fatter because R2 upside is larger than plausible downside (plant already idled once, unlikely to crash below 6000 without catastrophic stoppage).

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: “Vehicles Rivian reports delivered in Q1 2026 (all models, units).”  
2. Base rate: 10000 per quarter from 2025 history.  
3. Consistency: implied median 10500; mean 10900 – matches justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) Q4 25 actual 9745; b) tax-credit expiry persists; c) first R2 deliveries likely late Q1; d) capacity no longer limiting.  
5. Blind-spot: R2 certificate/recall delay pushes first deliveries into Q2 (downside to <7000).
