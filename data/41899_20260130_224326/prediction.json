Q3 2025 delivered 13,201 in an artificially elevated environment (credit pull-forward). The \"normalized\" baseline appears to be 10,000-11,000 quarterly deliveries for legacy R1/EDV models.\\n\\n**Q1 2026 specific factors:**\\n\\n*Headwinds:*\\n- Q1 is historically a slower sales quarter\\n- Only ~60 days remain; most of January likely already reflected in production/delivery pipeline\\n- R2 is still in validation phase; mass deliveries unlikely before late March at earliest\\n- Demand uncertainty following credit expiration\\n\\n*Tailwinds:*\\n- Potential tax credit reinstatement for Rivian (below 200k threshold)\\n- R2 initial deliveries could begin in late Q1 (even small numbers would be additive)\\n- Production capacity is no longer constrained (215k annual capacity)\\n- Some pent-up demand from Q4 2025 suppression\\n\\n**Scenario modeling:**\\n\\n*Conservative (30% probability):*\\n- Legacy R1/EDV continues Q4 2025 run-rate: ~9,500-10,000\\n- Zero R2 deliveries in Q1\\n- Total: 9,500-10,000\\n\\n*Base case (50% probability):*\\n- Legacy models recover modestly: 10,500-11,500\\n- Small R2 contribution in late March: 200-500 units\\n- Total: 10,700-12,000\\n\\n*Optimistic (20% probability):*\\n- Legacy models return to Q3 2025 levels: 12,000-13,000\\n- Meaningful R2 ramp begins: 1,000-2,000 units\\n- Total: 13,000-15,000\\n\\nThe agent report consensus of 65-70k for full-year 2026 implies ~16,250-17,500 quarterly average, but this assumes a back-loaded year with R2 ramping. Q1 2026 would be well below this average given timing.\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\nThe distribution should reflect:\\n1. **High certainty floor:** Very unlikely to fall below Q4 2025\\'s 9,745 (10th percentile: ~9,500)\\n2. **Modal range:** Most likely 10,500-12,000 based on modest recovery + minimal R2\\n3. **Upside tail:** Small probability of 13,000-15,000+ if R2 launches early and strong\\n4. **Shape:** Right-skewed distribution (bounded floor, unbounded upside from R2 surprise)\\n\\nHistorical upset rate in EV sector is moderate-high (production delays, demand volatility), suggesting wider confidence intervals are prudent. However, Rivian has met recent guidance and R2 validation is progressing on schedule.\\n\\nThe hint suggests answers between 0-20,000, with my range of 9,500-15,000 sitting comfortably in the middle third of that range, which seems appropriate given current circumstances.\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\nPercentile 10: 9500\\nPercentile 20: 10200\\nPercentile 40: 11000\\nPercentile 60: 11800\\nPercentile 80: 12800\\nPercentile 90: 14000', step2_output='Analysis:\\n\\n## (a) Source Analysis\\n\\n**Historical Context Sources (Pre-January 2026):**\\n\\n1. **Morningstar (Jan 5, 2026)** - High quality financial analysis\\n   - Facts: Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries (-31% YoY);

typical ramp = 4-8 weeks to customer deliveries\\n- \"As early as June\" language suggests March deliveries unlikely or minimal\\n\\n**If timeframe halved (45 days remaining):**\\n- Would increase confidence in lower bound (less time for R2 surprise)\\n- Narrow range to 10,000-11,500 as base case\\n\\n**If timeframe doubled (Q1+Q2 2026):**\\n- Would significantly increase upper bound (12,000-18,000 range)\\n- R2 ramp would be fully captured in H1 2026\\n- Analyst 66,000 full-year implies ~30,000-35,000 for H1 2026\\n\\n**Seasonal considerations:**\\n- Q1 historically weakest auto sales quarter (post-holiday, winter weather)\\n- But EV buyers less seasonal than ICE (fewer \"model year\" concerns)\\n\\n## (d) Justification\\n\\n**Outside view base rate:** Rivian quarterly deliveries 2024-2025 averaged 10,562-12,875\\n\\n**Key factors shifting prediction:**\\n\\n1. **Floor established by Q4 2025 (9,745):** Strong evidence this represents post-credit \"new normal\" for legacy models. Unlikely to fall below this absent production disruption.\\n\\n2. **R2 timing mismatch:** Moderate-strong evidence suggests R2 customer deliveries begin late Q1 at earliest, more likely early Q2. Validation vehicles just started Jan 29. Even optimistic 6-week ramp = mid-March for first customer deliveries. Realistically contributes 0-500 units to Q1.\\n\\n3. **Tax credit uncertainty:** Credit expired Sept 30, 2025, but potential reinstatement for Rivian (below 200k cumulative threshold). No evidence of actual reinstatement yet. Neutral factor.\\n\\n4. **Demand environment:** Broader EV market weak (-41% Nov 2025), but Rivian\\'s premium segment may be less affected. Management\\'s \"in line with expectations\" suggests controlled transition. Slightly negative factor.\\n\\n5. **Production capacity:** No longer constrained (215k annual capacity), so deliveries = demand, not supply. This shifts uncertainty from \"can they build it?\" to \"will customers buy it?\"\\n\\n**Distribution shape justification:**\\n- **Left tail bounded:** Very unlikely <9,000 (below Q4 2025 without negative catalyst)\\n- **Right tail open:** R2 surprise deliveries, tax credit reinstatement, or demand recovery could push to 13,000-15,000\\n- **Mode:** 10,500-11,500 (modest recovery from Q4 + minimal R2)\\n- **Skew:** Right-skewed (bounded floor, unbounded upside from R2)\\n\\n**Scenario probabilities:**\\n- 20%: Weak (9,000-10,000) - Q4 weakness persists, zero R2\\n- 50%: Base (10,000-12,000) - Modest recovery + 0-500 R2 units\\n- 25%: Strong (12,000-14,000) - Better recovery + 500-1,500 R2 units  \\n- 5%: Very strong (14,000+) - Aggressive R2 ramp + demand surge\\n\\nThe 66,000 full-year analyst consensus implies Q1 would be ~12-14% of annual total (8,000-9,200) if evenly distributed, but distribution is clearly back-loaded. Q1 likely represents 14-18% of full year (9,200-11,900), accounting for R2 late start.\\n\\n## Probability Calibration\\n\\n**Calibration against outside view:**\\n- Historical quarterly average (2025): 10,562\\n- Q4 2025 (most recent): 9,745\\n- Implied Q1 from 66k annual: 9,200-11,900 (assuming back-loaded year)\\n\\n**My prediction should:**\\n1. Be anchored to Q4 2025 as floor (9,745)\\n2. Allow modest upside from recovery + minimal R2 (10,500-12,000 as mode)\\n3. Include tail risk for aggressive R2 ramp (13,000-15,000 at 90th+ percentile)\\n4. Respect 67% of quarter already elapsed (limits upside variance)\\n\\n**Distribution construction:**\\n- P10: 9,500 (slight downside from Q4, 10% chance of worse environment)\\n- P20: 10,000 (Q4 baseline hold)\\n- P40: 10,700 (modest recovery begins)\\n- P60: 11,500 (recovery + small R2 contribution)\\n- P80: 12,500 (stronger recovery + meaningful R2 start)\\n- P90: 13,500 (optimistic recovery + 1,000+ R2 units)\\n\\n**Adjustments for 67% elapsed:**\\n- Tighten distribution slightly (less time for surprises)\\n- Increase weight on 10,000-11,500 range\\n- Reduce P90-P99 tail (R2 ramp unlikely to accelerate dramatically in 60 days)\\n\\n**Final calibration check:**\\n- Median (~11,000): Reasonable given Q4 base + modest improvement\\n- Mean (~11,200): Slightly above median due to right skew (R2 upside)\\n- 80% CI (10,000-12,500): Captures most realistic scenarios\\n- Tails (9,500 at P10, 15,000 at P99): Account for downside risk and R2 surprise\\n\\nChecklist:\\n\\n1. **Target variable:** Rivian total vehicle deliveries (all models) for Q1 2026 (Jan 1-Mar 31, 2026), in units.\\n\\n2. **Outside view base rate:** Rivian quarterly deliveries 2024-2025 averaged 10,562-12,875; Q4 2025 = 9,745 establishes post-credit floor.\\n\\n3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 11,000; mean \u2248 11,300. Makes sense: modest recovery from Q4 2025 base (9,745) + minimal R2 contribution, aligned with 67% quarter elapsed and validation vehicles just starting.\\n\\n4. **Key evidence:**\\n   - Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries establishes floor (strong, multiple sources)\\n   - R2 validation units started Jan 29, 2026; deliveries \"as early as June\" (strong, Carscoops)\\n   - Tax credit expired Sept 30, 2025, caused Q3\u2192Q4 drop (strong, policy change)\\n   - Analyst consensus ~66k for full 2026, implies back-loaded year (moderate, Intellectia/247wallst)\\n   - 67% of Q1 already elapsed, limits variance (strong, calendar fact)\\n\\n5. **Blind-spot scenario:** R2 production ramp dramatically accelerates with Rivian delivering 2,000-3,000 R2 units in March (early reservations fulfilled rapidly). This would push outcome to 13,000-14,000, making my forecast look conservative.

typically Q1 is seasonally weaker in auto industry\\n   - Suitability: Low - insufficient historical Q1 data for Rivian specifically\\n\\n3. **Legacy vehicle production (R1/EDV) in transition year with new model launch:**\\n   - 2025 run-rate suggests ~40k annual legacy deliveries\\n   - Q1 2026 legacy baseline: ~10,000 vehicles\\n   - Suitability: High for legacy vehicles only\\n\\n4. **New EV model launch ramps (industry comparables):**\\n   - Tesla Model 3, Model Y early quarters showed slow initial ramps\\n   - First full quarter often delivers 1,000-5,000 units\\n   - Suitability: Medium - useful for R2 component but each launch differs\\n\\n## (c) Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n**Prediction timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026\\n- Today is January 30, 2026 - we\\'re already 30 days into the quarter\\n- 60 days remaining until quarter end\\n\\n**Key timing factors:**\\n\\n1. **R2 delivery timeline:** Multiple sources confirm \"end of Q1 or beginning of Q2\" for first deliveries\\n   - Validation units just started rolling out (late January 2026)\\n   - Manufacturing validation \u2192 certification \u2192 first customer deliveries typically takes 6-10 weeks\\n   - Most likely scenario: 0-500 R2 deliveries in Q1, with volume starting in Q2\\n\\n2. **Legacy vehicle production:**\\n   - Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 vehicles\\n   - Q3 2025 delivered 13,201 vehicles (inflated by tax credit deadline)\\n   - Without tax credit and in typical Q1 seasonal weakness, expect closer to Q4 levels or slightly lower\\n\\n3. **Tax credit impact:**\\n   - Federal credit expired Sept 30, 2025\\n   - Q4 showed 31% YoY decline, attributed to this expiration\\n   - Q1 2026 will be first full quarter without the credit for most buyers\\n   - Agent report notes potential legislative exception for Rivian (sub-200k sales), but no confirmation this is active\\n\\n## (d) Justification for Outside View\\n\\n**Base case reasoning:**\\n\\nThe most relevant reference class is Rivian\\'s recent quarterly delivery performance, adjusted for known factors:\\n\\n1. **Legacy vehicle baseline (R1T/R1S/EDV):** \\n   - Q4 2025 = 9,745 deliveries\\n   - Q1 typically sees seasonal weakness (post-holiday, weather)\\n   - No tax credit headwind worsening (already reflected in Q4)\\n   - Expect: 8,000-10,000 legacy deliveries\\n\\n2. **R2 contribution in Q1 2026:**\\n   - Validation units just started (late January)\\n   - \"End of Q1 or beginning Q2\" guidance suggests minimal Q1 volume\\n   - Best case: 200-500 units if deliveries start in late March\\n   - Most likely: 0-100 units (primarily to employees/insiders)\\n   - Conservative estimate: 0-200 R2 deliveries\\n\\n3. **Combined Q1 2026 estimate:**\\n   - Conservative: 8,000 legacy + 0 R2 = 8,000\\n   - Base: 9,000 legacy + 100 R2 = 9,100\\n   - Optimistic: 10,000 legacy + 500 R2 = 10,500\\n\\n**Risk factors:**\\n\\n- **Downside risks:** Production disruptions, continued demand weakness, R2 delays pushing all deliveries to Q2\\n- **Upside risks:** Stronger-than-expected legacy demand, earlier R2 ramp, tax credit reinstatement\\n\\n**Analyst consensus check:**\\n- Full year 2026 consensus: 65k-70k deliveries\\n- If evenly distributed: ~16k-17k per quarter\\n- BUT Q1 will be heavily weighted toward legacy vehicles; R2 ramp occurs later\\n- Q1 should be well below quarterly average: 8k-11k range is reasonable\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\nGiven the analysis above, I need to construct a distribution that:\\n\\n1. **Centers around 9,000-10,000 deliveries** (legacy vehicle baseline with minimal R2)\\n2. **Accounts for significant uncertainty** in both legacy demand and R2 timing\\n3. **Respects the hint range** of 0-20,000 but recognizes most probability mass should be in lower half\\n4. **Allows for tail scenarios:**\\n   - Downside: Severe production issues or demand collapse \u2192 5,000-7,000\\n   - Upside: Aggressive early R2 push or unexpectedly strong legacy \u2192 12,000-14,000\\n\\n**Distribution construction:**\\n\\nThe distribution should be roughly normal but slightly right-skewed (upside from potential R2 surprise).\\n\\n- **10th percentile:** Conservative scenario - weak legacy demand, no R2 deliveries, possible disruptions \u2192 7,000\\n- **20th percentile:** Below-average legacy performance, no meaningful R2 \u2192 8,000\\n- **40th percentile:** Slightly below base case, minimal R2 \u2192 9,000\\n- **60th percentile:** Base case with small R2 contribution \u2192 9,800\\n- **80th percentile:** Strong legacy quarter, modest R2 start \u2192 11,000\\n- **90th percentile:** Very strong performance, earlier R2 ramp \u2192 12,500\\n\\nThis distribution:\\n- Centers median around 9,400 (between 40th and 60th percentiles)\\n- Provides 80% confidence interval of 7,000-11,000\\n- Allows for reasonable tails without extreme values\\n- Reflects that Q1 is a transition quarter with limited R2 impact\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\nPercentile 10: 7000\\nPercentile 20: 8000\\nPercentile 40: 9000\\nPercentile 60: 9800\\nPercentile 80: 11000\\nPercentile 90: 12500', step2_output='Analysis:\\n\\n## (a) Source Analysis\\n\\n**Historical Context Sources (Pre-January 30, 2026):**\\n\\n1. **Morningstar (Jan 5, 2026)** - High quality.

Emphasizes tax credit expiration impact and R2 as critical for 2026 recovery.\\n\\n**Key Factual Findings:**\\n- Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries (confirmed across multiple sources)\\n- Q3 2025: 13,201 deliveries (pre-tax credit expiration)\\n- FY 2025: 42,247 deliveries\\n- R2 first deliveries: \"end of Q1 or early Q2\" per latest sources\\n- No official Q1 2026 guidance issued\\n- Analyst consensus for full 2026: ~66,000 deliveries\\n\\n## (b) Evidence Analysis\\n\\n**Strong Evidence:**\\n1. **Tax credit cliff effect**: Multiple independent sources confirm Sept 2025 expiration caused Q4 decline from 13,201 \u2192 9,745 (-26%). This structural change removes ~$7,500 incentive, creating sustained demand headwind. Q3 showed artificial pull-forward; Q4 represents new baseline demand.\\n\\n2. **R2 production timing**: Multiple sources (Carscoops, CNET, Parameter) confirm validation units on line with deliveries \"June 2026\" or \"end of Q1/early Q2.\" This strongly suggests minimal Q1 2026 R2 contribution (likely 0-500 units maximum).\\n\\n3. **Production capacity constraint**: Q4 2025 production of 10,974 with 9,745 deliveries shows ~1,200 inventory build. Normal plant operating near current capacity for R1 models during R2 transition.\\n\\n**Moderate Evidence:**\\n1. **Seasonal patterns**: U.S. auto sales typically weaker in Q1 (post-holiday). Historical Rivian Q1 performance: Q1 2024 likely ~11,000-12,000 based on FY patterns.\\n\\n2. **Analyst full-year estimate of 66,000**: If distributed evenly, implies ~16,500/quarter. However, Morningstar explicitly states \"lower volumes in H1\" during R2 ramp, suggesting Q1 below this average.\\n\\n3. **Inventory dynamics**: ~1,200 unit build in Q4 2025 provides modest buffer for Q1 deliveries exceeding production.\\n\\n**Weak Evidence:**\\n1. **Competitive dynamics**: Lucid\\'s Q4 surge and Tesla\\'s Model S/X discontinuation are tangential; don\\'t directly predict Rivian Q1 volumes.\\n\\n2. **Stock price movements**: Reflect sentiment but not predictive of deliveries.\\n\\n## (c) Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n**Prediction Window**: Q1 2026 ends March 31, 2026 (60 days from now). Results reported ~30 days later (early May 2026).\\n\\n**Timeframe Sensitivity:**\\n- **If halved (30 days to Q1 end)**: Would increase uncertainty about R2 contribution; production ramp trajectory less clear. Might widen confidence intervals by 15-20%.\\n  \\n- **If doubled (120 days, covering Q1+Q2)**: Would dramatically increase expected deliveries due to full R2 ramp in Q2. Combined Q1+Q2 estimate would be ~25,000-30,000 (Q1: 10,000-12,000; Q2: 15,000-18,000).\\n\\n**Key Temporal Factors:**\\n- R2 deliveries timing is binary: either late March (200-500 units) or April onward (0 units in Q1)\\n- Tax credit absence is persistent throughout Q1\\n- No scheduled factory shutdowns in Q1 2026\\n- 60-day window limits ability to recover from slow start\\n\\n## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts from Outside View\\n\\n**Outside View Baseline**: 11,500 vehicles (range: 7,500-15,000 at 10th-90th percentiles)\\n\\n**Adjustment Factors:**\\n\\n1. **Tax Credit Structural Headwind (-10% to -15%)**: The Q3\u2192Q4 drop from 13,201 to 9,745 (-26%) was partially artificial (Q3 had pull-forward). However, the loss of $7,500 incentive is permanent. Q4 2025 represents new demand baseline for R1 models. This suggests Q1 baseline closer to 10,000 than 11,500 for R1-only sales.\\n\\n2. **R2 Minimal Contribution (+0 to +800 units)**: Latest sources indicate \"June 2026\" or \"end of Q1/early Q2\" for first deliveries. Conservative estimate: 200-500 R2 deliveries in late March if aggressive ramp; 0 if production validation extends into April. Expected value: ~300 units.\\n\\n3. **Inventory Release (+500 to +1,000 units)**: Q4 built 1,229 inventory units (10,974 production - 9,745 deliveries). Some portion likely delivered in Q1, partially offsetting lower production during R2 line conversion.\\n\\n4. **Seasonal Weakness (-5% to -10%)**: Q1 historically softer for auto sales. However, Rivian\\'s delivery-driven model (less dealer inventory) may dampen this effect.\\n\\n5. **Production Transition Friction (-500 units)**: R2 line conversion may temporarily reduce R1 output as factory reconfigures. Morningstar explicitly warned of \"lower H1 volumes.\"\\n\\n**Net Adjustment**: The outside view of 11,500 appears slightly optimistic. The tax credit loss is a permanent structural change that reset demand baseline to ~9,700 (Q4 2025 level). Adding modest inventory release (+700), minimal R2 contribution (+300), and seasonal/transition friction (-500) yields adjusted center around 10,200 vehicles.\\n\\n**Distribution Shape**: The uncertainty remains high due to:\\n- Unknown exact R2 delivery start date (could be 0 or 700 units)\\n- Unclear demand elasticity post-tax credit\\n- Production line transition risks\\n\\nHowever, hard constraints exist:\\n- **Floor**: ~7,000 (catastrophic production issues or demand collapse)\\n- **Ceiling**: ~14,000 (requires strong R1 demand recovery + significant R2 contribution + full inventory release)\\n\\n## Probability Calibration\\n\\n**Central Tendency**: 10,200 vehicles (median)\\n\\n**Reasoning**:\\n- Q4 2025 baseline: 9,745 deliveries represents post-tax credit demand floor for R1\\n- Inventory buffer: +700 units from Q4 build\\n- Early R2 trickle: +300 units (conservative, assumes late-March start)\\n- Production/seasonal friction: -500 units\\n- Net: 10,200 vehicles\\n\\n**Distribution Construction**:\\n\\nThe distribution should be slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) because:\\n1. R2 could surprise with earlier/faster ramp (upside)\\n2. Demand floor is more certain than ceiling\\n3. Production capacity limits extreme upside\\n\\n**Percentile Calibration**:\\n- **1st percentile (7,000)**: Severe production disruption or demand collapse. Requires R1 sales dropping 25% below Q4 AND no R2 deliveries AND inventory not released. Probability ~1%.\\n\\n- **10th percentile (8,500)**: Weak scenario. R1 demand continues softening to ~8,000, minimal inventory release (+300), zero R2 deliveries. Represents pessimistic but plausible outcome.\\n\\n- **25th percentile (9,300)**: Below-baseline scenario. R1 at Q4 levels (~9,700), small inventory release (+200), no R2 contribution, some production friction (-600).\\n\\n- **Median (10,200)**: Central estimate as justified above.\\n\\n- **75th percentile (11,500)**: Above-baseline scenario. R1 demand stabilizes at 9,700, full inventory release (+1,000), modest R2 contribution (+600), minimal friction.\\n\\n- **90th percentile (13,000)**: Optimistic scenario. R1 demand rebounds slightly to 10,500, full inventory (+1,000), strong R2 ramp (+1,500), smooth transition.\\n\\n- **99th percentile (15,500)**: Very optimistic. Requires R1 demand recovery + aggressive R2 ramp (2,000+ units) + full inventory release. Near production capacity limits.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n\\n1. **Target variable**: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries reported for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), in units.\\n\\n2. **Outside view base rate**: 11,500 vehicles; adjusted to 10,200 based on structural tax credit loss resetting demand baseline to Q4 2025 levels (~9,700) plus modest inventory/R2 additions.\\n\\n3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 10,200; mean \u2248 10,500 (slight right skew). Aligns with Q4 2025 baseline (9,745) + small positive adjustments. Reasonable given transition period.\\n\\n4. **Key evidence influencing forecast**:\\n   - Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 (post-tax credit baseline)\\n   - R2 deliveries expected \"June 2026\" or late Q1 (minimal Q1 contribution)\\n   - 1,229 inventory units built in Q4 available for Q1 release\\n   - Morningstar expert expects \"lower H1 2026 volumes\" during ramp\\n   - No official Q1 guidance; analyst full-year consensus ~66,000 implies uneven quarterly distribution\\n\\n5. **Blind-spot scenario**: R2 production validation completes faster than expected, enabling 1,500-2,000 early deliveries in March. This would push outcome to 11,500-12,000 (upside). Alternatively, production line conversion causes more R1 disruption than anticipated, dropping deliveries to 8,000-8,500 (downside). Upside scenario slightly more likely given management\\'s conservative guidance history.\\n\\nDistribution:\\nPercentile 1: 7000\\nPercentile 5: 8000\\nPercentile 10: 8500\\nPercentile 20: 9300\\nPercentile 40: 10000\\nPercentile 60: 10500\\nPercentile 80: 11500\\nPercentile 90: 13000\\nPercentile 95: 14000\\nPercentile 99: 15500', error=None, probability=None, probabilities=None, percentiles={1: 7000.0, 5: 8000.0, 10: 8500.0, 20: 9300.0, 40: 10000.0, 60: 10500.0, 80: 11500.0, 90: 13000.0, 95: 14000.0, 99: 15500.0}, cdf=[0.0, 9.949609473418997e-05, 0.00019899218946837994, 0.00029848828420256997, 0.00039798437893675994, 0.0004974804736709499, 0.0005969765684051399, 0.00069647266313933, 0.00079596875787352, 0.00089546485260771, 0.0009949609473419, 0.0010944570420760899, 0.0011939531368102797, 0.0012934492315444695, 0.0013929453262786593, 0.001492441421012849, 0.001591937515747039, 0.0016914336104812287, 0.0017909297052154185, 0.0018904257999496083, 0.0019899218946837984, 0.0020894179894179886, 0.002188914084152179, 0.002288410178886369, 0.0023879062736205593, 0.0024874023683547496, 0.00258689846308894, 0.00268639455782313, 0.0027858906525573203, 0.0028853867472915106, 0.002984882842025701, 0.003084378936759891, 0.0031838750314940813, 0.0032833711262282715, 0.003414631498248753, 0.003585248456436262, 0.0037609500856719052, 0.003941825886543011, 0.004127965359636905, 0.004319458005540915, 0.004516393324842367, 0.004718860818128588, 0.004926949985986907, 0.005140750329004648, 0.005360351347769138, 0.005585842542867707, 0.005817313414887678, 0.006054853464416381, 0.0062985521920411415, 0.0065484990983492855, 0.0068047836839281416, 0.007067495449365036, 0.007336723895247293, 0.007612558522162243, 0.007895088830697214, 0.008184404321439529, 0.008480594494976519, 0.008783748851895505, 0.009093956892783814, 0.009411308118228781, 0.009735892028817727, 0.01006779812513798, 0.010407115907776866, 0.010753934877321712, 0.011108344534359847, 0.011470434379478594, 0.011840293913265285, 0.012218012636307242, 0.012603680049191796, 0.01299738565250627, 0.013399218946837993, 0.014311674494183852, 0.016172230516842603, 0.018883452005854357, 0.02234790395225922, 0.026468151347097308, 0.03114675918140873, 0.036286292446233596, 0.041789316132612025, 0.047558395231584116, 0.05349609473418998, 0.06075004159353643, 0.07006034145987333, 0.08071827736995614, 0.09201513236053993, 0.10324218946837993, 0.1139960833013148, 0.12456623410490172, 0.13528310337247362, 0.14647715259736338, 0.15847884327290396, 0.1716186368924283, 0.18622699494926928, 0.2026343789367598, 0.22233265035279837, 0.24611220946130324, 0.2732513259046373, 0.30302826932516325, 0.3347213093652437, 0.3676087156672416, 0.4009687578735197, 0.438538719169538, 0.481581076871998, 0.5256618918201249, 0.5663472248531438, 0.5992031368102796, 0.6260797575774587, 0.6517054531705597, 0.6759636386237371, 0.6987377289711444, 0.7199111392469355, 0.739367284485265, 0.756989579720286, 0.7726614399861528, 0.7862662803170193, 0.7976875157470396, 0.8075707732966586, 0.8166864245272485, 0.8251050012843516, 0.832897035413512, 0.8401330587602728, 0.846883603170177, 0.8532192004887681, 0.8592103825615893, 0.864927681234184, 0.8704416283520954, 0.8758227557608669, 0.8811415953060416, 0.8864686788331632, 0.8918745381877745, 0.897429705215419, 0.903087987962025, 0.908724918368556, 0.9142936141231076, 0.919747192913776, 0.9250387724286571, 0.9301214703558468, 0.9349484043834408, 0.9394726921995353, 0.943647451492226, 0.947425799949609, 0.9509638065587962, 0.9544397077722715, 0.9578398724761868, 0.9611506695566948, 0.9643584678999474, 0.9674496363920974, 0.9704105439192968, 0.9732275593676982, 0.9758870516234539, 0.9783753895727163, 0.9806789421016378, 0.9827840780963706, 0.9846771664430671, 0.9863445760278797, 0.9877726757369609, 0.9878721718316951, 0.9879716679264292, 0.9880711640211634, 0.9881706601158975, 0.9882701562106316, 0.9883696523053658, 0.9884691484000999, 0.9885686444948341, 0.9886681405895682, 0.9887676366843023, 0.9888671327790365, 0.9889666288737706, 0.9890661249685048, 0.9891656210632389, 0.989265117157973, 0.9893646132527072, 0.9894641093474413, 0.9895636054421755, 0.9896631015369096, 0.9897625976316438, 0.9898620937263779, 0.989961589821112, 0.9900610859158462, 0.9901605820105803, 0.9902600781053145, 0.9903595742000486, 0.9904590702947828, 0.9905585663895169, 0.990658062484251, 0.9907575585789852, 0.9908570546737193, 0.9909565507684535, 0.9910560468631876, 0.9911555429579217, 0.9912550390526559, 0.99135453514739, 0.9914540312421242, 0.9915535273368583, 0.9916530234315925, 0.9917525195263266, 0.9918520156210607, 0.9919515117157949, 0.992051007810529, 0.9921505039052632, 0.9922499999999973])",

It provides a useful reference for legacy vehicle delivery volumes.\\n  \u2013 The EV.com/Proactive investors/other news articles on Q4 2025 (from early January 2026 and late 2025) consistently report Q4 deliveries around 9,700\u201310,000 vehicles. They also document the impact of the federal tax-credit expiration, which pulled demand into Q3 2025 and depressed Q4.\\n  \u2013 The Nasdaq article (dated January 28, 2026) and the Agent Report offer detailed context on the R2 launch. They note that while the R2 \u201cvalidation\u201d and production builds are underway and first customer deliveries are scheduled for early-to-mid 2026, deliveries are \u201clikely to start at the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter.\u201d\\n  \u2013 The Agent Report further outlines consensus expectations for 2026 annual totals (roughly 65k\u201370k vehicles) and breaks down that legacy (R1/EDV) models are expected to remain at about 40k units for the year, with the R2 ramp contributing the balance. Because the R2 production ramp is anticipated to start around April 2026, Q1 will likely be weighted heavily toward legacy models.\\n\\n\u2022 Reference Class Analysis:\\n  \u2013 One suitable reference class is Rivian\u2019s quarterly performance in 2025 (with Q3 at roughly 13k and Q4 at roughly 10k deliveries). Given that Q4\u2019s number reflects a more run-rate level when incentives had taken a toll and before the new R2 catch-up, this class provides a baseline for legacy deliveries.\\n  \u2013 Another reference class is other EV makers\u2019 early production runs when launching a new, lower-priced platform. Those cases typically show a modest start in the launch quarter with most of the annual ramp deferred to later quarters.\\n  \u2013 Combining these, the most suitable reference for Q1 2026 is the legacy volume run rate (about 10k per quarter) plus a potential small addition from an early R2 launch if it starts before the quarter ends.\\n\\n\u2022 Timeframe Analysis:\\n  \u2013 We are forecasting Q1 2026 deliveries as of January 30, 2026. Q1 runs from January 1 to March 31, so about two months remain in the quarter.\\n  \u2013 Historical quarterly patterns in 2025 suggest that without a full ramp of a new model, Q1 (or a transitional quarter) might be lower than quarters with full production of established models.\\n\\n\u2022 Justification:\\n  \u2013 Based on the legacy model\u2019s running pace (roughly 40k annually, or about 10k per quarter) and given that Q4 2025 ended at around 9,700 units, Q1 2026 is likely to show a similar level from legacy models.\\n  \u2013 The R2 midsize SUV is scheduled to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026. However, consensus and the Nasdaq article indicate that deliveries from the new R2 may only appear at the very end of Q1 or may predominantly come in Q2. Therefore, only a modest bonus (if any) would be expected in Q1.\\n  \u2013 In a conservative scenario, Q1 2026 deliveries might solely reflect legacy performance, while an upside scenario would see a brief run of early R2 deliveries pushing total Q1 deliveries somewhat higher.\\n  \u2013 Given the relatively high uncertainty during a model ramp transition\u2014and noting that historical EV ramp launches can be later-than-anticipated\u2014a true probability distribution should reasonably span a range from around 9,000 (if no R2 volumes materialize in Q1) up to 15,000 vehicles (if early R2 deliveries contribute materially).\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n  \u2013 We tie our prediction roughly to the historical quarterly data from 2025 and adjust for the announced R2 launch.\\n  \u2013 Small shifts in when the R2 deliveries begin (end of Q1 vs. start of Q2) could alter the distribution\u2019s tails.\\n  \u2013 Historically, EV manufacturers experience \u201cupset\u201d dynamics around a new model launch \u2013 with early production hiccups and ramp uncertainty. Thus, a wide 90% confidence interval is warranted.\\n  \u2013 Given that our reference classes and expert comments trend toward a legacy baseline of about 10k vehicles per quarter and minimal R2 contribution in Q1, we adjust our distribution so that the median is a modest 12,000 vehicles, with a 10th percentile at about 9,000 and a 90th percentile at 15,000.\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\nPercentile 10: 9000  \\nPercentile 20: 10000  \\nPercentile 40: 11000  \\nPercentile 60: 12000  \\nPercentile 80: 13500  \\nPercentile 90: 15000', step2_output='Analysis:\\nWe are forecasting Rivian\u2019s total vehicle deliveries (all models) for Q1 2026. Our sources indicate that in Q4 2025 Rivian delivered 9745 vehicles (Tridens, RivianTrackr, CBT News). Historical Q1 performance for legacy models (R1T, R1S, EDV) tends to be a bit lower than the high Q3 surge seen during the tax\u2011credit rush. Now, with the federal EV tax credit having expired last September, Q4 2025 was already depressed by about 31% compared with Q3. For Q1 2026 we expect the legacy vehicle baseline to roughly mirror Q4 (around 9000\u201310000 vehicles), but note that the R2 midsize SUV\u2014Rivian\u2019s new model with production set to ramp up\u2014is only expected to begin delivering near the very end of the quarter (or perhaps spill into early Q2). Thus, its contribution in Q1 will likely be minimal (perhaps only a few dozen to a few hundred vehicles). Overall, our reference class (using Q4\u2019s 9745 as a baseline, adjusted for seasonal weakness and the slow start of the new product) leads us to a median in the high 9000 to low 10000 range.\\n\\nLet\u2019s summarize key source points:\\n\u2022 Morningstar and RivianTrackr both report Q4 2025 deliveries of about 9745 vehicles, with full\u2011year 2025 in the low-to-mid 42000 range.\\n\u2022 Articles from CBT News and Tridens note that the drop was partly due to the expiration of tax credits and a planned production retooling (for the upcoming R2 and R3).\\n\u2022 Analyst and media reports (Motley Fool, Carscoops) note that the R2 production ramp is scheduled but will not significantly contribute in Q1 2026.\\n\u2022 Opinions from several outlets stress that while overall 2026 deliveries might be projected (by some analysts) near 65000 for the year, the first quarter will be light as the new model\u2019s ramp is meager.\\n\\nEvaluating evidence:\\n\u2013 Strong evidence: Q4 2025 delivery numbers from multiple independent sources; clear causal explanation (tax credit expiration, production retooling).\\n\u2013 Moderate evidence: Analyst commentary on the R2 launch timing and its slow ramp in early 2026.\\n\u2013 Weak evidence: Anecdotal hints from promotional articles whose optimistic language may overstate the early R2 impact.\\nOur weighting thus centers our view on legacy deliveries (around 9000\u201310000) while allowing for minimal upsides (if R2 starts early and adds a few hundred).\\n\\nTimeframe analysis:\\nPrediction timeframe: Q1 2026 (January 1 through March 31, 2026). Today is January 30, so roughly 60 days remain in the quarter. If the time window were halved (i.e. only January\u2013mid\u2011February), we would expect deliveries even lower (perhaps closer to the Q4 level or slightly below); if doubled (an entire quarter plus extra time), the cumulative delivery total would be higher\u2014so our short\u2011term prediction remains focused on the current quarter\u2019s transitional dynamics.\\n\\nJustification:\\nConsidering the available evidence, the base rate is set by Q4\u2019s nearly 9700 deliveries. We adjust downward slightly for typical Q1 (seasonal weakness and post\u2011holiday slowdown) and upward modestly for any R2 deliveries in the final weeks. Therefore, our outside view predicts a median in the vicinity of 9800 vehicles. The range reflects risks such as production disruptions (pushing numbers toward 6000\u20137000 in a downside scenario) or an unexpectedly strong early R2 and legacy rebound (raising totals to perhaps 12500\u201315000 in extreme cases). The historical trends and published Q4 numbers are our most reliable anchors.\\n\\nProbability calibration:\\nBased on the factors and evidence, our best estimate centers around 9800 deliveries with considerable probability mass between about 8000 and 11000. There is an 80% confidence interval roughly between 7000 (low extreme in a severe downturn) and 11000 (if legacy performs well and R2 starts modestly). The tail risks \u2013 if production problems materialize or if R2 is delayed further \u2013 could push the low end to around 6000, while an early and vigorous R2 launch combined with an unusually strong legacy recovery might raise the high end to near 15000.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n1. Target variable: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries (vehicles) for Q1 2026.\\n2. Outside view base rate: Q4 2025 deliveries (~9745) adjusted for Q1 seasonal effects and R2 ramp.\\n3. Consistency check: Implied median = 9800 vehicles; mean likely similar. This aligns with the justification.\\n4. Top evidence:\\n   - Q4 2025 deliveries at 9745 (multiple high\u2010quality sources).\\n   - Minimal expected Q1 R2 contribution (reliably reported by Carscoops and others).\\n   - Expected seasonal slowdown in Q1.\\n5. Blind-spot: A rapid, unexpected ramp in R2 deliveries (pushing totals significantly above forecast) would push the number upward.\\n\\nDistribution:\\nPercentile 1: 6000\\nPercentile 5: 6700\\nPercentile 10: 7000\\nPercentile 20: 8000\\nPercentile 40: 9000\\nPercentile 60: 9800\\nPercentile 80: 11000\\nPercentile 90: 12500\\nPercentile 95: 13500\\nPercentile 99: 15000', error=None, probability=None, probabilities=None, percentiles={1: 6000.0, 5: 6700.0, 10: 7000.0, 20: 8000.0, 40: 9000.0, 60: 9800.0, 80: 11000.0, 90: 12500.0, 95: 13500.0, 99: 15000.0}, cdf=[0.0, 9.94962216624685e-05, 0.000198992443324937, 0.0002984886649874055, 0.000397984886649874, 0.0004974811083123425, 0.0005969773299748111, 0.0006964735516372797, 0.0007959697732997482, 0.0008954659949622168, 0.0009949622166246853, 0.0010944584382871537, 0.0011939546599496222, 0.0012934508816120906, 0.0013929471032745591, 0.0014924433249370276, 0.001591939546599496, 0.0016914357682619645, 0.001790931989924433, 0.0018904282115869014, 0.0019899244332493697, 0.002089420654911838, 0.0021889168765743066, 0.002288413098236775, 0.0023879093198992435, 0.002487405541561712, 0.0025869017632241804, 0.002707706255614626, 0.0028812212067625413, 0.003061526454088122, 0.0032487833370904873, 0.0034431531952687556, 0.0036447973681220454, 0.0038538771951494755, 0.004070554015850165, 0.004294989169723229, 0.004527343996267788, 0.004767779834982962, 0.005016458025367867, 0.005273539906921623, 0.0055391868191433475, 0.005813560101532159, 0.006096821093587178, 0.006389131134807519, 0.006690651564692303, 0.007001543722740649, 0.007321968948451675, 0.007652088581324498, 0.007992063960858237, 0.008342056426552011, 0.008702227317904938, 0.009072737974416137, 0.009453749735584726, 0.009845423940909823, 0.010247921929890548, 0.010661405042026019, 0.011086034616815354, 0.01152197199375767, 0.011969378512352084, 0.01242841551209772, 0.012899244332493695, 0.014352585598129342, 0.017606099350215048, 0.0224303560531815, 0.028595926171459382, 0.035873380169479385, 0.044033288511672194, 0.052846221662468496, 0.06685536458423177, 0.08585502184660461, 0.10249244332493712, 0.11462018578939356, 0.12524687505282905, 0.13475386455462943, 0.14352250773418077, 0.15193415803086904, 0.1603701688840802, 0.16921189373320025, 0.17884068601761524, 0.18963789917671114, 0.20198488664987396, 0.2162816172950018, 0.23250147386389647, 0.2503859306368007, 0.26967646189395666, 0.2901145419156066, 0.31144164498199295, 0.3333992453733579, 0.3557288173699439, 0.3781718352519931, 0.4004697732997479, 0.4237442750070467, 0.4488305241623993, 0.4750403054880554, 0.5016854037062644, 0.528077603539276, 0.5535286897093398, 0.5773504469387052, 0.5988546599496217, 0.6189294409160925, 0.6388286141020353, 0.6584125323645735, 0.6775415485608297, 0.6960760155479272, 0.713876286182989, 0.7308027133231382, 0.7467156498254973, 0.7614754485471897, 0.7749424623453383, 0.7869770440770658, 0.7974395465994956, 0.8067473004403924, 0.8154460100854461, 0.823588589328668, 0.8312279519640688, 0.8384170117856596, 0.8452086825874515, 0.8516558781634551, 0.8578115123076819, 0.8637284988141425, 0.869459751476848, 0.8750581840898093, 0.8805767104470373, 0.8860682443425433, 0.8915856995703381, 0.8971819899244324, 0.9028402870529747, 0.9084772317866856, 0.9140459416934357, 0.9194995343410954, 0.9247911272975352, 0.9298738381306256, 0.9347007844082368, 0.9392250836982395, 0.943399853568504, 0.9471782115869009, 0.9507162271407672, 0.9541921371396577, 0.9575923104347688, 0.9609031158772973, 0.9641109223184394, 0.967202098609392, 0.9701630136013517, 0.9729800361455151, 0.9756395350930787, 0.9781278792952393, 0.9804314376031933, 0.9825365788681373, 0.984429671941268, 0.9860970856737817, 0.9875251889168756, 0.9876246851385381, 0.9877241813602006, 0.9878236775818631, 0.9879231738035256, 0.9880226700251881, 0.9881221662468506, 0.9882216624685131, 0.9883211586901756, 0.9884206549118381, 0.9885201511335006, 0.9886196473551631, 0.9887191435768256, 0.988818639798488, 0.9889181360201506, 0.989017632241813, 0.9891171284634755, 0.989216624685138, 0.9893161209068005, 0.989415617128463, 0.9895151133501255, 0.989614609571788, 0.9897141057934505, 0.989813602015113, 0.9899130982367755, 0.990012594458438, 0.9901120906801005, 0.990211586901763, 0.9903110831234255, 0.990410579345088, 0.9905100755667505, 0.990609571788413, 0.9907090680100755, 0.990808564231738, 0.9909080604534005, 0.991007556675063, 0.9911070528967255, 0.991206549118388, 0.9913060453400505, 0.991405541561713, 0.9915050377833755, 0.991604534005038, 0.9917040302267005, 0.991803526448363, 0.9919030226700255, 0.992002518891688, 0.9921020151133505, 0.992201511335013, 0.9923010075566755, 0.992400503778338, 0.9925000000000005])",

Mostly investment commentary; useful for consensus (annual 2026 deliveries \u2248 66000) but speculative \u2192 weak-to-moderate.\\n\\n   f. Electrek & industry items (Lucid, Tesla) \u2013 context only; not directly causal for Rivian Q1 numbers \u2192 weak.\\n\\n   Across sources the only hard data for Q1 forecast is legacy run-rate (\u224810000/quarter) and R2 timing (customer deliveries no earlier than late Q2).  No official 2026 guidance yet (expected 12 Feb 2026).\\n\\n2. Evidence analysis\\n\\n   Strong:\\n   \u2022 Official Rivian 2025 quarterly deliveries show legacy run-rate has slipped to \u224810000 per quarter post-tax-credit expiration (Morningstar, RivianTrackr).  \\n   \u2022 Historical pattern: Rivian has never ramped a new model inside the same quarter it begins production; past R1T launch (Q4-2021) produced only 920 deliveries.\\n\\n   Moderate:\\n   \u2022 Carscoops photo-evidence that R2 validation builds are underway, implying SOP (start-of-production) in March/April.  \\n   \u2022 Analyst consensus that first-half 2026 will be soft before R2 ramp (Morningstar).\\n\\n   Weak:\\n   \u2022 Blog speculation that Rivian could deliver 66000 vehicles in 2026 (Intellectia).  Provides broad annual figure but no quarterly split.\\n\\n   Net: strong evidence supports baseline \u224810000; moderate evidence adds a modest upside tail for a handful of R2s; little evidence for a downside collapse (factory already re-tooled).\\n\\n3. Timeframe analysis\\n\\n   \u2022 Target period ends 31 Mar 2026 \u2013 61 days away.  \\n   \u2022 If the forecast window were halved (only to 29 Feb), probability mass would shift slightly lower (median \u224811000) because even fewer R2s could ship.  \\n   \u2022 If doubled (to Q2), upside tail widens strongly (median \u224816000) as R2 ramp becomes significant.\\n\\n4. Justification / inside-view adjustment\\n\\n   Outside view (reference class = last four quarters of legacy models after incentives lapse):  \\n      Mean 2025 Q4 deliveries 9745 \u2192 set base rate 10000.\\n\\n   Inside adjustments:  \\n      +500 vehicles (5 %) for incremental learning/efficiency at Normal plant (cost-cut program).  \\n      +1000 vehicles (10 %) for possibility of a few hundred early R2s or EDV pull-ins to Amazon at quarter-end.  \\n      \u2212500 vehicles (\u22125 %) for continued soft demand without tax credits.  \\n   Adjusted median \u224812000.\\n\\n   Tail shaping:  \\n      Downside 8000 (plant stoppage, demand shock).  \\n      Upside 18000 (surprisingly rapid R2 pilot fleet to employees & Amazon, unlikely but possible).\\n\\nProbability calibration\\n\\n   \u2013 Mean \u224812300, median 12000.  \\n   \u2013 90 % interval 9000\u201315000; 98 % 8000\u201318000.  Fits historic volatility (\u03c3\u22481500 per quarter).  \\n   \u2013 Distribution leans slightly right-tailed due to optionality of R2 surprise.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n\\n1. Target variable: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries, Q1 2026, units (vehicles).\\n\\n2. Outside view base rate: 10000 (average deliveries last two quarters 2025).\\n\\n3. Consistency check: implied median 12000; mean 12300; aligns with factors listed.\\n\\n4. Key evidence:  \\n   \u2022 Q4-25 deliveries 9745 (hard data).  \\n   \u2022 Tax-credit expiry depressed demand (policy change).  \\n   \u2022 No R2 customer deliveries expected before June 26 (launch timing).  \\n   \u2022 Normal plant capacity 150000/y, currently underused (headroom).  \\n   \u2022 Historical new-model ramps slow (R1T 920 in first quarter).\\n\\n5.

Status-quo demand (R1S/T + EDV) looks roughly equal to Q4-25 (9 ,745) because the credit headwind persists and no major marketing catalyst arrives before April.  \\n2. R2 contribution: management goal \u201cdeliveries end of Q1\u201d.  Historically, Tesla Model 3 (2017) and Ford F-150 Lightning (2022) shipped <500 units in their first quarter of customer hand-offs.

Only shows peer market softness; indirect evidence \u2192 weak for the target variable.  \\n\\n(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)  \\nStrong evidence  \\n\u2022 Two independent SEC-based sources agree Q4-25 deliveries = 9745 vehicles (Morningstar, RivianTrackr).  \\n\u2022 Rivian has historically delivered roughly 9\u201313 k vehicles per quarter for eight consecutive quarters (2024-25).  \\nModerate evidence  \\n\u2022 Management/COO quotes that R2 customer deliveries begin \u201cend Q1 or early Q2 26\u201d; validation units already built (Carscoops).  \\n\u2022 Factory re-tooling for R2 finished; Normal plant capacity up to 215000, so production is not the constraint (Tridens, RivianTrackr).  \\n\u2022 Expiration of US $7500 tax credit in Sep 2025 materially hurt Q4 demand and persists into Q1 26 (Morningstar, CBT).  \\nWeak evidence  \\n\u2022 Analyst compilation claiming 66000 FY-26 deliveries (Intellectia).  \\n\u2022 General EV-market malaise articles (Electrek, Parameter).  \\n\\n(c) Timeframe analysis  \\nResolution in 92 days (01 May 2026 publication of Q1 10-Q).  If horizon were halved (46 days), almost no new information on R2 ramp would emerge \u2192 forecast variance would widen slightly.  If doubled (184 days), the actual figure would already be known, collapsing uncertainty to zero.\\n\\n(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  \\nOutside-view base rate = median of last four quarters (Q2-Q4 25 + est Q1 25) \u2248 10000 deliveries.  \\nShifters downward  \\n\u2022 Ongoing demand drag from lapsed tax credit; Q4 25 fell 31 % YoY.  \\n\u2022 No price cuts announced pre-earnings; macro EV demand still weak.  \\nShifters upward  \\n\u2022 Even a token R2 launch could add 100\u20132000 vehicles.  \\n\u2022 Amazon EDV contract may pull some fleet deliveries back to normal seasonal level (~2000/qtr vs ~1200 in Q4).  \\nNet: central estimate 10500 vehicles, slightly above the Q4 trough but well below 2024 quarterly norms.  Uncertainty: R2 timing, fleet pull-forward, possible additional demand slide.  90 %-CI chosen as 7000\u201315000 (wide enough for a zero-R2 scenario on the low end and a small but brisk R2 mini-ramp on the high end).\\n\\nProbability calibration\\n\\nMean \u2248 10900; median 10500.  Right tail slightly fatter because R2 upside is larger than plausible downside (plant already idled once, unlikely to crash below 6000 without catastrophic stoppage).\\n\\nChecklist:  \\n1. Target variable: \u201cVehicles Rivian reports delivered in Q1 2026 (all models, units).\u201d  \\n2. Base rate: 10000 per quarter from 2025 history.  \\n3. Consistency: implied median 10500; mean 10900 \u2013 matches justification.  \\n4. Key evidence: a) Q4 25 actual 9745; b) tax-credit expiry persists; c) first R2 deliveries likely late Q1; d) capacity no longer limiting.  \\n5. Blind-spot: R2 certificate/recall delay pushes first deliveries into Q2 (downside to <7000).\\n\\nDistribution:\\nPercentile 1: 5000\\nPercentile 5: 6500\\nPercentile 10: 7000\\nPercentile 20: 8000\\nPercentile 40: 9500\\nPercentile 60: 10500\\nPercentile 80: 12500\\nPercentile 90: 14000\\nPercentile 95: 15500\\nPercentile 99: 18000', error=None, probability=None, probabilities=None, percentiles={1: 5000.0, 5: 6500.0, 10: 7000.0, 20: 8000.0, 40: 9500.0, 60: 10500.0, 80: 12500.0, 90: 14000.0, 95: 15500.0, 99: 18000.0}, cdf=[0.0, 9.949545913218971e-05, 0.00019899091826437943, 0.00029848637739656917, 0.0003979818365287589, 0.0004974772956609486, 0.0005969727547931383, 0.0006964682139253281, 0.0007959636730575178, 0.0008954591321897076, 0.0009949545913218974, 0.0010944500504540872, 0.001193945509586277, 0.0012934409687184666, 0.0013929364278506564, 0.00151601378556515, 0.0016756138495543104, 0.0018430697434598268, 0.0020184766325988903, 0.002201929682288694, 0.0023935240578464283, 0.002593354924589286, 0.002801517447834459, 0.0030181067928991387, 0.0032432181251005167, 0.0034769466097557848, 0.0037193874121821354, 0.00397063569769676, 0.004230786631616851, 0.004499935379259598, 0.004778177105942195, 0.005065606976981833, 0.005362320157695705, 0.005668411813401002, 0.005983977109414917, 0.006309111211054638, 0.006643909283637359, 0.006988466492480274, 0.007342878002900573, 0.007707238980215447, 0.00808164458974209, 0.00846618999679769, 0.008860970366699444, 0.00926608086476454, 0.009681616656310172, 0.01010767290665353, 0.010544344781111808, 0.010991727445002196, 0.011449916063641884, 0.011919005802348068, 0.012399091826437938, 0.013046007090180865, 0.014011419224377568, 0.015289175409142241, 0.016873122824589096, 0.018757108650832324, 0.020934980067986154, 0.023400584256164744, 0.026147768395482295, 0.02917037966605305, 0.032462265247991194, 0.036017272321410915, 0.03982924806642643, 0.04389203966315194, 0.04819949429170164, 0.05274545913218973, 0.05931156035386442, 0.06883777835470696, 0.08005549165793122, 0.09169607878675078, 0.10249091826437953, 0.112322341640805, 0.1219707252061002, 0.1315145145936066, 0.14103215543666586, 0.15060209336861946, 0.16030277402280907, 0.17021264303257624, 0.18041014603126249, 0.19097372865220952, 0.20198183652875884, 0.21331756775624522, 0.22482703929106648, 0.23653322505815985, 0.24845909898246207, 0.26062763498891, 0.27306180700244065, 0.28578458894799064, 0.2988189547504971, 0.31218787833489675, 0.3259143336261265, 0.3400212945491233, 0.35453173502882385, 0.36946862899016525, 0.38485495035808415, 0.40071367305751754, 0.41807617623056564, 0.4375650290242115, 0.45858999037071674, 0.4805608192023428, 0.502887274451351, 0.5249791150500028, 0.5462460999305598, 0.5660979880252834, 0.583944538266435, 0.5991955095862762, 0.6126783185827744, 0.6256314040442352, 0.6380810581884271, 0.650053573233118, 0.6615752413960766, 0.6726723548950715, 0.6833712059478703, 0.6936980867722417, 0.703679289585954, 0.7133411066067755, 0.7227098300524747, 0.7318117521408198, 0.7406731650895793, 0.7493203611165214, 0.7577796324394144, 0.7660772712760265, 0.7742395698441265, 0.7822928203614822, 0.7902633150458622, 0.7981773461150348, 0.8060482973596746, 0.8138550532359362, 0.8215721569598075, 0.8291741517472762, 0.8366355808143304, 0.8439309873769582, 0.8510349146511469, 0.8579219058528851, 0.8645665041981602, 0.8709432529029603, 0.8770266951832736, 0.8827913742550877, 0.8882118333343905, 0.8932626156371698, 0.897918264379414, 0.9022942165621027, 0.9065229711122704, 0.9106046641349866, 0.9145394317353205, 0.9183274100183415, 0.9219687350891189, 0.9254635430527223, 0.9288119700142208, 0.9320141520786839, 0.9350702253511809, 0.9379803259367814, 0.9407445899405544, 0.9433631534675695, 0.945836152622896, 0.9481637235116033, 0.9504111157387239, 0.9526405995058063, 0.9548478418126936, 0.9570285096592288, 0.9591782700452552, 0.961292789970616, 0.963367736435154, 0.965398776438713, 0.9673815769811351, 0.9693118050622644, 0.9711851276819435, 0.9729972118400159, 0.9747437245363243, 0.9764203327707123, 0.9780227035430227, 0.9795465038530989, 0.9809874007007837, 0.9823410610859205, 0.9836031520083524, 0.9847693404679223, 0.9858352934644736, 0.9867966779978494, 0.9876491610678927, 0.9883884096744469, 0.9890100908173548, 0.989109586276487, 0.9892090817356193, 0.9893085771947515, 0.9894080726538838, 0.989507568113016, 0.9896070635721482, 0.9897065590312805, 0.9898060544904127, 0.9899055499495449, 0.9900050454086772, 0.9901045408678094, 0.9902040363269417, 0.9903035317860739, 0.9904030272452061, 0.9905025227043384, 0.9906020181634706, 0.9907015136226028, 0.9908010090817351, 0.9909005045408673, 0.9909999999999995])"

This deadline pulled demand forward into Q3 2025, creating a \"lopsided second half of the year\"\n\n- **Production vs. Deliveries**: The sequential production increase from Q3 to Q4 suggests Rivian was rebalancing inventory after delivering significantly more vehicles than it produced in Q3\n\n## Forward-Looking Information:\n\n- **R2 Launch**: The R2 vehicle is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026 and is viewed as a potential catalyst for sales growth\n- **Current Challenges**: Rivian continues to burn cash, remains unprofitable, and faces concerns about sustained demand amid intensifying competition\n\n*Source attribution: According to the Motley Fool (cited in article) for the sector-wide incentive-driven pattern explanation*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/finally-moment-rivian-investors-have-long-waited\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Finally, the Moment Rivian Investors Have Long Waited For\"\n\n**Source:** Nasdaq (The Motley Fool content)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **R2 Production Status:** As of last week (approximately late January 2026), Rivian has officially begun rolling out validation units of the R2 from its Normal, Illinois factory.\n\n2. **Factory Updates:** Rivian's Illinois plant was modified with new assembly lines for the dedicated R2 platform, with tooling installed in \"record time\" to meet delivery targets for the first half of 2026.\n\n3. **Cost Savings:** The decision to produce R2 at the Illinois facility rather than waiting for the Georgia factory saved the company over $2.25 billion.\n\n4. **Pricing:** The R2 base trim is expected to start around $45,000, though premium trims will likely be produced first at higher price points.\n\n5. **Stock Performance:** Rivian stock rose nearly 50% in 2025, despite it being a slow year with no vehicle launches.\n\n6. **Delivery Timeline:** Deliveries are likely to start \"at the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter\" (of 2026).\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- **Validation Units Explained:** These are the final stage before \"saleable\" production begins. They are built on the real production assembly line with production tooling (not hand-assembled prototypes) and are used for certifications, crash testing, and EPA range estimates.\n\n- **Strategic Importance:** The R2 is described as \"critically important\" - designed to be higher-volume and lower-cost than Rivian's premium R1S and R1T models, opening access to a larger addressable market.\n\n- **What to Watch:** The article emphasizes that investors should focus on the R2's impact on Rivian's gross margin in coming quarters, as this will significantly affect how the stock trades.\n\n## Opinions (Article Author/The Motley Fool):\n\n- The validation production represents a potential \"Model 3 moment\" for Rivian\n- Investors should be \"excited\" about the company in the near term\n- The R2 will be \"a huge step forward for Rivian\"\n- If the R2 helps drive gross profitability higher, \"it will be a huge leap forward for investors\"\n\n**Note:** This article does not provide specific Q1 2026 delivery numbers or forecasts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-hits-2025-targets-despite-ev-policy-and-demand-pressure/\">\n# Summary of Key Information from Article\n\n## Objective Facts and Statistics:\n\n**2025 Full Year Performance:**\n- Total production: 42,284 vehicles\n- Total deliveries: 42,247 vehicles\n- Result: Finished inside company's revised guidance\n\n**Q4 2025 Performance:**\n- Production: 10,974 vehicles\n- Deliveries: 9,745 vehicles\n\n**Historical Comparison:**\n- 2023: ~57,000 vehicles produced, ~50,000 delivered\n- 2024: ~49,500 vehicles produced, ~51,500 delivered\n- 2025: ~42,000 vehicles produced and delivered\n\n**Policy Context:**\n- Federal EV tax credit (up to $7,500 for new EVs) expired on September 30, 2025\n- Expiration occurred under tax law signed by President Trump earlier in 2025\n- Credit removal affected leases after that date\n\n**Upcoming Event:**\n- Full Q4 and 2025 financial results scheduled for release: February 12, 2026, after market close\n- Earnings webcast: 5:00 p.m. ET on February 12, 2026\n\n## Analysis/Opinions (from article author):\n- The year-over-year decline reflects \"tighter demand and more conservative production\"\n- Rivian \"navigated a tougher EV market and shifting incentives\"\n- Meeting revised guidance represents \"stabilization compared to earlier volatility\" rather than a \"blowout result\"\n- The company \"was able to manage through a tougher demand environment instead of missing targets outright\"\n- Tax credit expiration \"has been widely cited as a headwind for EV demand and new EV sales\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1085074/rivian-reports-drop-in-q4-and-full-year-2025-vehicle-deliveries-1085074.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Rivian reports drop in Q4 and full-year 2025 vehicle deliveries\"\n\n**Disclaimer:** The extracted content appears to be incomplete, containing primarily navigation menu items and other non-article content from the Proactiveinvestors NA website.

The latest primary sources (FY-25 earnings call transcripts) and the recently published plant-upgrade articles confirm the picture that emerged in earlier work:  \n\n1.  What Rivian management is now saying about 2026  \n   \u2022 Timing but no numbers.  In both the FY-25 Q1 and Q3 earnings calls, CEO RJ Scaringe reiterated only that \u201cfirst customer deliveries of R2 will occur in the first half of 2026,\u201d with no explicit 2026 production or delivery target for the company or for the R2 itself (Stockinsights.ai FY25-Q1, FY25-Q3).  \n   \u2022 Capacity in place for the launch.  Scaringe told investors the 1.1 million-sq-ft expansion at Normal, Illinois is structurally complete, and shop equipment commissioning is under way.  With paint-shop upgrades, rated plant capacity rises from 150 k to 215 k vehicles per year and is \u201cbeing tooled specifically for R2\u201d (FY25-Q3 transcript).  \n   \u2022 Georgia deferred.  Management again framed the planned Georgia factory (400 k annual capacity for R2/R3) as \u201clonger-term\u201d; groundbreaking occurred in September 2025, but the site will not contribute to 2026 output (FY25-Q3 transcript).  \n\n   Bottom-line disclosure status: as of the most recent public call, Rivian still provides only milestone language (\u201cH1 2026 deliveries\u201d)\u2014no numeric 2026 guidance by model or in total.\n\n2.  Production groundwork and disruptions that will shape 2026 volume  \n   \u2022 2025 shutdowns.  Normal was paused twice in 2025 to install R2 tooling, including a three-week stoppage beginning 15 Sept 2025 (EV, 10-Sep-25; RivianTrackr, 10-Sep-25).  The pauses hurt 2025 output\u2014Rivian built 42,284 vehicles vs. 49,476 in 2024 (Tridens, 15-Jan-26)\u2014but leave the line configured for a concurrent R1 / R2 / EDV mix in 2026.  \n   \u2022 2H-26 upgrade.  A further four-week shutdown pencilled in for late-2026 is mentioned in Rivian\u2019s SEC filings but still lacks schedule detail or volume effect (original gap remains).  \n\n3.  R2 programme status and cost/margin implications  \n   \u2022 Validation builds.  R2 design-validation builds are already underway; manufacturing-validation builds start \u201cat year-end 2025 following full commissioning\u201d (FY25-Q3 transcript).  \n   \u2022 Cost structure.  Management continues to highlight the midsize platform\u2019s Gen-2 zonal electronics, die-cast structures and structural battery pack, citing roughly 45 % lower material cost per unit vs. R1 (Motley Fool summary, 11-Dec-25, referenced in prior work).  These savings underpin Rivian\u2019s goal of positive gross profit in 2027.  \n   \u2022 Pricing.  Rivian still advertises a ~$45 k base MSRP; dual-motor \u201cLaunch Edition\u201d is expected in the mid-$50 k range (TopElectricSUV, 25-Jan-26).  \n   \u2022 Reservations.  No updated reservation count has been given since the generic \u201cwell over 100 k\u201d comment in early 2025.  The reservation data gap therefore persists.\n\n4.  Street expectations for 2026 deliveries (unchanged but reinforced)  \n   \u2022 Consensus remains 65 k\u201370 k total deliveries: roughly 40 k legacy R1 and EDV plus 25 k\u201330 k R2 units in a partial-year ramp (EV blog synthesis, 2-Jan-26).  \n   \u2022 Upside models cited by Stifel and others still top out near 100 k total deliveries if R2 exits 2026 at \u22658 k units/month\u2014well below the 215 k physical ceiling at Normal (EV blog, 15-Oct-25).  \n   No analyst has revised these ranges since the Q3 call, because Rivian supplied no new guideposts.\n\n5.  Commercial-van (EDV) colour  \n   \u2022 Rivian\u2019s fleet website was quietly updated to state \u201cDelivery of Rivian Commercial Vans will begin in 2025\u201d with a generic invitation to contact sales, but provides no 2026 volume expectations (Rivian Fleet page, accessed Jan-26).  \n   \u2022 The long-standing Amazon order (100 k vans by 2030) reached ~20 k delivered by YE-2025 (Tridens, 15-Jan-26).  Management has not broken out a 2026 EDV figure, leaving another data gap.\n\n6.  Policy backdrop influencing 2026 demand  \n   \u2022 Potential tax-credit advantage.  Electrek (13-May-25) notes draft legislation that would end the $7,500 Clean Vehicle Credit after 2025 except for OEMs with <200 k cumulative U.S. sales.  Rivian would still be below that threshold, implying its R2 could be one of the few EVs eligible in 2026.  Rivian has not quantified how this assumption is baked into volume planning.  \n   \u2022 Demand elasticity.  The sequential 31 % drop in Q4-25 deliveries after the 2025 credit sunset underscores sensitivity; management has not provided economic or policy scenarios for 2026.  \n\n7.  Working delivery maths using only disclosed facts  \n   Conservative case  \n     \u2013 R1T/S + EDV hold flat at 40 k (equal to 2025 run-rate).  \n     \u2013 R2 SOP April-26, average 3 k/mo for nine months \u2192 27 k.  \n     \u2192 ~67 k total\u2014squarely in consensus band.  \n   Upside case  \n     \u2013 Legacy 40 k.  \n     \u2013 R2 ramps to 8 k/mo exit-rate; achieves 60 k in the year.  \n     \u2192 ~100 k total\u2014comfortably within 215 k plant headroom.  \n   Downside case  \n     \u2013 If Normal\u2019s planned late-26 shutdown costs one month, knock off 4\u20136 k units of combined volume; totals drop to roughly 60 k (consensus low).\n\n8.  Remaining information gaps  \n   a. Still no official 2026 delivery, production or mix guidance from Rivian.  \n   b. No updated R2 reservation tally since early-2025.  \n   c. No model-level split of 2026 EDV vs. consumer vehicles.  \n   d. No quantified impact of the tentative late-2026 retool shutdown.  \n   e. No disclosure of economic or incentive assumptions underlying Rivian\u2019s internal 2026 plan.\n\n9.  Assessment  \n   \u2022 As of January 2026, the only \u201chard\u201d commitment is that customer deliveries of R2 begin in H1 2026.  Management continues to emphasise capacity readiness and cost-down benefits but offers no numeric guidance.  \n   \u2022 Sell-side and media models therefore remain the only quantitative frame, clustering around 65 k\u201370 k deliveries for 2026.  At that level, a sub-year R2 ramp more than offsets 2025\u2019s demand dip and begins to shift Rivian\u2019s mix toward a lower-price, potentially higher-margin platform.  \n   \u2022 The key valuation swing factors\u2014not yet disclosed\u2014are (i) the pace of the R2 ramp after SOP, (ii) how much R1/EDV volume can be preserved during the transition, and (iii) whether tax-credit eligibility creates a material demand lift.\n\nUntil Rivian publishes its FY-25 10-K or holds the FY-25 earnings call\u2014both expected in March 2026\u2014analysts and investors will have to rely on the consensus scenarios above.  Future disclosures to watch for include an updated reservation count, a 2026 volume commentary in the shareholder letter, and any colour on EDV contract scheduling.\n\nVerification checklist\n1.

The company produces the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans (EDVs) for Amazon and others, with plans to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026. In 2022, Rivian produced only 24,337 vehicles (vs. a 50,000 target), delivering 20,332. Production rose to 57,232 in 2023 with 50,122 deliveries, but dipped to 49,476 in 2024, with deliveries reaching 51,579 despite inflation, high interest rates, reduced EV subsidies, and competition. For 2025, Rivian expects deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. Over the next five years, analysts project Rivian\u2019s revenue will grow at a 31% CAGR from 2024 to 2027, with net losses narrowing. The company aims to boost gross margins through clean energy credit sales, subscription services, upgrades, and licensing. A joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) is advancing new EV architecture and software. Rivian plans to open its Georgia plant and triple production capacity by 2028. If Rivian achieves a 20% revenue CAGR through 2031 and trades at 5x sales by 2031\u2014up from under 3x sales in 2024\u2014its stock could rise more than sixfold. However, this growth depends on successful scaling, market expansion, and overcoming macro and microeconomic headwinds.

The investment will expand production across multiple factories, scale the nascent robotaxi business, and build AI infrastructure. Tesla also revealed plans to discontinue the high-end Model S and Model X vehicles, redirecting that production capacity toward building Optimus humanoid robots. CEO Elon Musk emphasized the company\u2019s 'very, very big investments' during a post-earnings call. The company reached a $2 billion investment agreement with Musk\u2019s xAI startup, including a framework to enhance AI development and deployment in the physical world. This move reinforces the deep integration between Tesla and Musk\u2019s other ventures, despite a prior shareholder vote that failed to pass a nonbinding measure supporting such an investment. Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents, beating analyst estimates by 5 cents, marking the first profit beat in four quarters. However, vehicle deliveries declined 9% year-over-year in 2025, with a 16% drop in the fourth quarter, driven by lower EV demand, increased competition, and the loss of regulatory credit revenue, which fell 22% in Q4. Regulatory credits, once a lucrative income stream, have dried up following the Trump administration\u2019s elimination of penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards. Despite the EV sales slump, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software now has 1.1 million active subscribers\u2014up nearly 40% from a year earlier\u2014and will become subscription-only after February 14.

The decision follows years of declining sales, with Model S and Model X combined accounting for a small percentage of Tesla's annual deliveries\u2014over 1.7 million units annually since 2022\u2014leading Tesla to stop reporting their sales separately starting in 2023, grouping them with Cybertruck and Tesla Semi under 'other vehicles.' The Fremont factory, which previously produced these models with a design capacity of about 100,000 units annually, has been operating at low capacity. Elon Musk cited 'autonomy' as the primary reason for the shutdown, stating that production lines will be repurposed for Optimus robots, with a target annual output of 1 million units. Tesla will continue providing after-sales service but will stop deliveries after the second quarter of 2026, with no further production once current inventory is depleted. A minor update in July 2025\u2014adding new colors, a front camera, slightly improved range, and ambient lighting\u2014was widely seen as a token gesture, with prices increased by $5,000 (Model S to $84,990, Model X to $89,990), signaling a farewell tour. Historically, Model S (2012\u20132026) and Model X (2015\u20132026) were pivotal in establishing Tesla\u2019s brand, serving as financial foundations for the more mass-market Model 3 and Model Y, and defining the premium electric vehicle segment. However, platform aging and competition from Lucid Air and Rivian R1S have eroded their market leadership. Industry analysts, including Electrek, note that the decision was 'inevitable' from a manufacturing standpoint due to the high complexity and low volume of these models. The move symbolizes the end of an era, as these vehicles once inspired early adopters and forced traditional automakers to embrace electrification. With the discontinuation of Model S and Model X, Tesla has officially closed the chapter on its flagship era, redirecting resources toward future automation goals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[inside.com.tw](https://www.inside.com.tw/article/40584-tesla-ends-model-s-and-model-x-as-flagship-line-makes-way-for-optimus)\n\n**Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now?**\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) is at a critical juncture in its development, with its long-term viability hinging on the success of its upcoming lower-priced truck, the R2, set for release in 2026.

The company produces the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans (EDVs) for Amazon and others, with plans to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026. In 2022, Rivian produced only 24,337 vehicles (vs. a 50,000 target), delivering 20,332. Production rose to 57,232 in 2023 with 50,122 deliveries, but dipped to 49,476 in 2024, with deliveries reaching 51,579 despite inflation, high interest rates, reduced EV subsidies, and competition. For 2025, Rivian expects deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. Over the next five years, analysts project Rivian\u2019s revenue will grow at a 31% CAGR from 2024 to 2027, with net losses narrowing. The company aims to boost gross margins through clean energy credit sales, subscription services, upgrades, and licensing. A joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) is advancing new EV architecture and software. Rivian plans to open its Georgia plant and triple production capacity by 2028. If Rivian achieves a 20% revenue CAGR through 2031 and trades at 5x sales by 2031\u2014up from under 3x sales in 2024\u2014its stock could rise more than sixfold.

The recommendation is to approach with caution and delay investment until post-launch performance data is available.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 11:45 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/28/is-rivian-stock-a-buy-now/)\n\n**Rivian's 2025 deliveries slip below expectations as EV demand pressure persists**\nRivian reported 42,247 electric vehicle deliveries in 2025, a decline of approximately 18% compared to the previous year, falling slightly below the 42,500 deliveries expected by analysts according to Visible Alpha data\u2014representing a consensus forecast of a 17.6% drop. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 delivery count was 9,745, below the Wall Street expectation of 10,050, while production reached 10,974 units at its Normal, Illinois plant. The decline underscores persistent pressure on demand for higher-priced EVs, exacerbated by the expiration of the US $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of September 2025, which led to higher vehicle prices. Rivian, which sells the R1T pickup and R1S SUV at premium price points, is under scrutiny over whether demand can remain resilient as it scales production. The company is implementing efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to reduce material and manufacturing costs in an effort to improve profitability without relying solely on volume growth. Investors are now focusing on the upcoming launch of the lower-cost R2 SUV, expected in the first half of 2026, which is positioned to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y. Rivian plans to release its full-year and fourth-quarter 2025 financial results on February 12, after market close.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 09:38 AM\nSource:[ETAuto.com](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/rivians-2025-deliveries-slip-below-expectations-as-ev-demand-pressure-persists/126319911)\n\n**Rivian follows Tesla in underperforming sales expectations**\nRivian Automotive reported 2025 delivery figures of 42,247 electric vehicles, an 18% decline from 2024 and slightly below analyst expectations of 42,500 units. The company delivered 9,745 vehicles in the fourth quarter, narrowly missing Wall Street's forecast of 10,050. Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, facility during the same period. The decline follows the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025, which increased consumer prices and reduced demand. Premium models like the R1T and R1S were hit hardest due to economic volatility. Rivian is responding with efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to achieve sustainable profitability, as investor patience has waned since the 2020\u20132021 EV boom. The company is preparing to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026, targeting a lower price point to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y and expand its customer base. Rivian\u2019s CEO, RJ Scaringe, announced that point-to-point automated driving will debut in 2026, following the launch of Universal Hands-Free in December 2025 under the Rivian Autonomy+ subscription ($49.99/month or $2,500 one-time). The company will release full-year 2025 financial results on February 12, 2026. U.S. new EV sales in November 2025 totaled 70,255 units, a 41.2% drop year-on-year, with EV market share falling to 5.4%, the lowest since April 2022. Despite this, analysts project U.S. EV sales will reach 2.25 million by end-2025 and account for 11.8% of total sales in 2026. Tesla also underperformed in 2025, according to Cryptopolitan.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/rivian-underperforming-sales-expectations/)\n\n**Rivian Lost Thousands Of Buyers Almost Overnight | Carscoops**\nRivian reported a 31.3% decline in fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle deliveries, with 9,745 units delivered compared to 14,183 in the same period of 2024. For the full year 2025, deliveries totaled 42,247 vehicles, down from 51,579 in 2024, representing an 18.1% year-over-year decrease. Production also declined, with 10,974 units made in Q4 2025 (down from 12,727 in Q4 2024) and 42,284 for the year (down from 49,476). The company stated these declines were 'in line with their expectations,' attributing the drop to the elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit in September 2025. Rivian's stock fell 1.95% to $19.32 per share as of January 2, 2026, though it has risen significantly from $13.25 on January 2, 2025. Looking ahead, Rivian plans to launch the new R2 model in the first half of 2026, starting at $45,000, featuring an all-new platform, up to 300 miles (483 km) of range, and powertrains offering 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) acceleration in under three seconds. The company also announced the rollout of Universal Hands-Free Driving on over 3.5 million miles (5,632,704 km) of roads in the U.S. and Canada, available via a new Autonomy+ subscription priced at $49.99/month or a one-time $2,500 fee. Rivian\u2019s full-year 2025 financial results are scheduled for release on February 12, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 08:34 PM\nSource:[Carscoops](https://www.carscoops.com/?p=3347511)\n\n**Rivian's 2025 Deliveries Fall Short of Expectations Amid Sustained Pressure on EV Demand**\nRivian's vehicle deliveries in 2025 totaled 42,247 units, a decline of approximately 18% compared to the previous year, falling slightly short of analysts' expectations of 42,500 deliveries\u2014representing an average consensus forecast of a 17.6% decrease. The company continues to implement efficiency measures at its Illinois plant, simplifying components to reduce material and manufacturing costs, aiming to improve profitability without relying solely on sales volume growth. This comes amid weakening demand for electric vehicles in the U.S., following the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of September 2024, which led to higher prices. Rivian, which sells the premium R1T pickup and R1S SUV, now faces increased scrutiny over whether demand can remain robust as production scales. Investors are turning attention to Rivian\u2019s upcoming, more affordable R2 SUV, which is expected to compete directly with Tesla\u2019s Model Y. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles and delivered 9,745, slightly below Wall Street\u2019s expectation of 10,050 deliveries.

Production at the Normal, Illinois plant reached 10,720 units. Despite the strong delivery numbers, Rivian's stock dropped by over 7%, driven by a revised annual guidance that now forecasts between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles\u2014down 500 units from the previous range of 40,000 to 46,000. The downward revision is attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle leasing, which had previously supported demand. Experts predict a sharp decline in EV sales and leasing. Additionally, high import tariffs on auto parts are forcing Rivian to restructure supply chains and increase domestic production, raising costs. This cost pressure threatens Rivian\u2019s efforts to improve profitability ahead of the 2025 launch of the more affordable R2 SUV. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter financial results, expected on November 4, 2025, will reveal the extent of margin compression.

The stock, trading at $15.59, has risen 26% over the past six months, according to InvestingPro data.  The firm projects Rivian will deliver 15,675 vehicles in Q3\u202f2025, surpassing the Visible Alpha Consensus estimate of 12,690 units.  Rivian\u2019s management recently confirmed that Q3 would be the company\u2019s best sales quarter during a lunch with investors in New York, where the CFO highlighted the company\u2019s focus on the Rivian Autonomy Platform.  Production figures show 20,590 vehicles were built and 19,301 delivered in the first half of 2025, after a 2024 annual production of 41,476 units and 51,579 deliveries.  Rivian maintains its 2025 delivery forecast of 40,000\u201346,000 vehicles.  The next platform, R2, is slated to begin production in the first half of 2026, with a base price of roughly $45,000.  The company is also recalling more than 24,000 2025 R1S and R1T models due to a software defect in the Hands\u2011Free Highway Assist system, and its electric delivery vans are under investigation by the NHTSA for potential seat\u2011belt performance issues affecting about 17,198 vehicles.  Rivian has begun work on a new plant in Georgia that is expected to create 7,500 jobs by 2030 and will produce the next\u2011generation R2 SUV and R3 crossover, with construction starting in 2026 and production by 2028.  Amazon is testing GM BrightDrop electric vans alongside its existing Rivian fleet as part of a strategy to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles by 2030.  \"Il titolo, attualmente scambiato a 15,59 dollari, ha mostrato un forte slancio con un guadagno del 26% negli ultimi sei mesi,\" noted the analyst.  \"La dirigenza di Rivian ha recentemente riaffermato che il Q3 sarebbe stato il suo trimestre pi\u00f9 forte per le vendite di veicoli,\" added the CFO.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 11:41 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Italia](https://it.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-mantiene-rating-neutrale-su-rivian-prevede-un-forte-q3-93CH-3017562)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on available data through January 30, 2026:  \n1. **Analyst Estimates for Q1 2026:**  \n   No specific projections for Rivian's Q1 2026 deliveries appear in recent reports.
