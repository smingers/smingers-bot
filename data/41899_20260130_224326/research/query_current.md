Analysis:
Rivian’s Q1-2026 delivery figure will depend on:  
• The ramp of existing R1T/R1S production in Normal, Illinois.  
• Whether R2 customer deliveries actually begin inside the quarter (the Electrek article suggests “soon,” but the company still needs EPA certification, logistical set-up and may initially count only a few hundred units).  
• Official guidance Rivian provides on its Q4-2025 earnings call (likely late February 2026) plus subsequent production updates.  
Key information to track therefore includes: 1) any January-to-April 2026 press releases or SEC filings disclosing cumulative production/deliveries, 2) analyst research notes revising delivery expectations, and 3) news on supply-chain constraints or plant downtime that could cap output. Current articles that cite internal targets or leaked production schedules will help form a base-rate; likewise, coverage of how fast Rivian scaled in the comparable quarter a year earlier (Q1-2025 deliveries were 13,588) provides trend context. The most relevant pieces will be recent (Q4-2025–Jan 2026) reports containing hard numbers or quoted guidance, especially from Rivian’s Investor Relations site, reputable financial outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters), and EV-centric publications (Electrek, InsideEVs).
