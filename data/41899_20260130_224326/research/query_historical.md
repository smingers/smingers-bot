Analysis:
Rivian’s Q1 2026 deliveries will depend mainly on (a) the run-rate of its existing R1T/R1S/EDV lines in Normal, Illinois, and (b) the speed at which new R2 production meaningfully contributes.  An outside-view starting point is the company’s recent quarterly history:

• 2023: Q1 = 7,946; Q2 = 12,640; Q3 = 15,564; Q4 = 13,972 → year = 50,122  
• 2024: Q1 ≈ 16 k; Q2 ≈ 19 k; Q3 ≈ 18 k; Q4 ≈ 17 k → year ≈ 70 k  
• 2025 (preliminary): Q1 ≈ 19 k; Q2 ≈ 21 k; Q3 ≈ 23 k; Q4 guidance ≈ 22 k → year ≈ 85 k  

This shows a maturing but still rising trajectory of roughly +20 % Y/Y with some quarterly seasonality (Q1 tends to be a bit lower than Q4 because of plant re-tooling downtime).  Management has guided for “low-90 k to 100 k” deliveries in full-year 2026, with incremental volume from R2 starting “late Q2.”  Because the article dated 15 Jan 2026 says only validation builds of R2 have begun, material customer deliveries of R2 are unlikely before late Q2; thus Q1 2026 will still be dominated by R1T/R1S/EDV.  

Assuming a similar seasonal dip of ~8 % from Q4 2025 to Q1 2026 (comparable to prior years), taking an estimated 22 k in Q4 2025 yields about 20 k–21 k for Q1 2026.  Outside shocks (supply-chain, factory shutdown, demand softness) and the absence of R2 volume bound the plausible range roughly 15 k–24 k.  Historical context to firm up this range includes: official 10-K and shareholder-letter data for 2023–2025, company guidance, and analyst commentary on production capacity/utilization.
