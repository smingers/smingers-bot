The company produces the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans (EDVs) for Amazon and others, with plans to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026. In 2022, Rivian produced only 24,337 vehicles (vs. a 50,000 target), delivering 20,332. Production rose to 57,232 in 2023 with 50,122 deliveries, but dipped to 49,476 in 2024, with deliveries reaching 51,579 despite inflation, high interest rates, reduced EV subsidies, and competition. For 2025, Rivian expects deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. Over the next five years, analysts project Rivian\u2019s revenue will grow at a 31% CAGR from 2024 to 2027, with net losses narrowing. The company aims to boost gross margins through clean energy credit sales, subscription services, upgrades, and licensing. A joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) is advancing new EV architecture and software. Rivian plans to open its Georgia plant and triple production capacity by 2028.

The vehicle is being produced at a newly expanded 2.6 million square foot manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, which was completed in just 11 months. The first validation vehicles\u2014actual production prototypes, not early models\u2014have already rolled off the assembly line, confirming the readiness of key manufacturing processes. The plant has a peak capacity of 215,000 vehicles annually, with 155,000 units allocated to the R2 model. Initially, Rivian planned to produce the R2 in Georgia, but due to delays in that project, the company shifted production to Illinois for speed. The R2 is built on a completely new midsize platform, and while final specifications remain unannounced, Rivian aims to maintain a starting price of approximately $45,000. This pricing is critical for direct competition with the Tesla Model Y; if achieved, the R2 could transition from a brand image vehicle to a serious market contender. The success of the R2 launch could determine whether Rivian becomes a major player in the U.S. mass-market electric vehicle sector or remains a niche producer of premium vehicles.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2026/01/rivian-r2-na-finishnij-pryamij-dolenosnij-elektrokrosover-vzhe-na-konveyeri)\n\n**Rivian Electric Vehicles: Reviews, Pricing, and Specs**\nRivian, a California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, offers a range of vehicles including the R1T pickup truck, the R1S full-size SUV, the mid-size R2 SUV, and upcoming entry-level models R3 and R3X. The R1T has received a perfect 10/10 rating from Car and Driver, with starting prices from $69,300 (2022) to $74,885 (2026) and an EPA-estimated range of 67\u201387 combined miles. The R1S SUV has consistently earned an 8.5/10 rating, with starting prices ranging from $76,700 (2024) to $79,800 (2023), and an EPA-estimated range of 258\u2013410 miles. The R2 SUV is projected to start at $45,000 (estimated) for the 2026 model year, while the R3 and R3X are expected to launch in 2027 as more affordable, compact options. Rivian also produces an electric commercial van used by Amazon, with a starting price of $79,900 (2026 model). All vehicles emphasize off-road capability and advanced technology. Car and Driver has awarded the R1T and R1S the '10Best' and 'EV of the Year' accolades, and both models are recognized as 'Editors' Choice' and 'C/D Rating' winners.\nOriginal language: unknown\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:26 PM\nSource:[caranddriver.com](https://caranddriver.com/rivian/)\n\n**Rivian (RIVN) Stock: Dips Ahead of Feb. 12 Earnings Amid Weak EV Demand**\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares declined to $15.20 on January 29, 2026, a 0.5% drop for the day but a nearly 30% decline since late December 2025, when they closed at $21.75. The stock dip reflects investor concerns over weak demand for Rivian\u2019s high-end electric trucks and SUVs, as well as uncertainty ahead of the company\u2019s Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings report on February 12. Despite producing 10,974 vehicles and delivering 9,745 in Q4, Rivian\u2019s total 2025 deliveries reached 42,247 units\u2014below some analyst expectations. The company\u2019s planned expansion into the smaller R2 model, scheduled for release in the first half of 2026, may pressure margins if delayed. Rivian\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen, particularly the software collaboration tied to a new EV platform and a potential $1 billion milestone payment, is under scrutiny, with winter testing ongoing in Sweden. Additionally, Rivian\u2019s ambitious software and services strategy\u2014including self-driving technology and AI-driven features\u2014faces market skepticism, especially after gains from its December Autonomy and AI Day were reversed. The broader EV sector remains turbulent, with the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit in September 2025 and rising competition from Tesla and Lucid compounding challenges. Analysts emphasize Rivian\u2019s need to balance software innovation with cash conservation amid a market reshaped by shifting consumer incentives and technological advancements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/rivian-rivn-stock-dips-feb-12-earnings-ev-demand/)\n\n**Tesla plots $20 billion spending spree to build Elon Musk's AI future**\nTesla Inc. announced a $20 billion capital expenditure plan for 2026\u2014double what Wall Street expected\u2014to pivot from an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer toward artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and autonomous driving. The investment will expand production across multiple factories, scale the nascent robotaxi business, and build AI infrastructure. Tesla also revealed plans to discontinue the high-end Model S and Model X vehicles, redirecting that production capacity toward building Optimus humanoid robots. CEO Elon Musk emphasized the company\u2019s 'very, very big investments' during a post-earnings call. The company reached a $2 billion investment agreement with Musk\u2019s xAI startup, including a framework to enhance AI development and deployment in the physical world. This move reinforces the deep integration between Tesla and Musk\u2019s other ventures, despite a prior shareholder vote that failed to pass a nonbinding measure supporting such an investment. Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents, beating analyst estimates by 5 cents, marking the first profit beat in four quarters. However, vehicle deliveries declined 9% year-over-year in 2025, with a 16% drop in the fourth quarter, driven by lower EV demand, increased competition, and the loss of regulatory credit revenue, which fell 22% in Q4. Regulatory credits, once a lucrative income stream, have dried up following the Trump administration\u2019s elimination of penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards. Despite the EV sales slump, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software now has 1.1 million active subscribers\u2014up nearly 40% from a year earlier\u2014and will become subscription-only after February 14. Tesla is expanding its robotaxi service to Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas in the first half of 2026. The company launched automated rideshare operations in Austin in June 2025, began rolling out robotaxis without human supervisors in January 2026, and continues to operate non-autonomous rideshare services in the San Francisco Bay Area, with testing permits in Nevada and Arizona. The stock rose 1.2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor optimism about Tesla\u2019s AI and robotics future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:56 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/tesla-plots-20-billion-spending-spree-to-build-elon-musks-ai-future/articleshow/127751060.cms)\n\n**Tesla Discontinues Model S and Model X, Paving the Way for Optimus Robot Production**\nTesla has announced the discontinuation of the Model S and Model X, marking the end of its flagship vehicle lineup as part of a strategic shift toward automation and the production of Optimus humanoid robots. The decision follows years of declining sales, with Model S and Model X combined accounting for a small percentage of Tesla's annual deliveries\u2014over 1.7 million units annually since 2022\u2014leading Tesla to stop reporting their sales separately starting in 2023, grouping them with Cybertruck and Tesla Semi under 'other vehicles.' The Fremont factory, which previously produced these models with a design capacity of about 100,000 units annually, has been operating at low capacity. Elon Musk cited 'autonomy' as the primary reason for the shutdown, stating that production lines will be repurposed for Optimus robots, with a target annual output of 1 million units. Tesla will continue providing after-sales service but will stop deliveries after the second quarter of 2026, with no further production once current inventory is depleted. A minor update in July 2025\u2014adding new colors, a front camera, slightly improved range, and ambient lighting\u2014was widely seen as a token gesture, with prices increased by $5,000 (Model S to $84,990, Model X to $89,990), signaling a farewell tour. Historically, Model S (2012\u20132026) and Model X (2015\u20132026) were pivotal in establishing Tesla\u2019s brand, serving as financial foundations for the more mass-market Model 3 and Model Y, and defining the premium electric vehicle segment. However, platform aging and competition from Lucid Air and Rivian R1S have eroded their market leadership. Industry analysts, including Electrek, note that the decision was 'inevitable' from a manufacturing standpoint due to the high complexity and low volume of these models. The move symbolizes the end of an era, as these vehicles once inspired early adopters and forced traditional automakers to embrace electrification. With the discontinuation of Model S and Model X, Tesla has officially closed the chapter on its flagship era, redirecting resources toward future automation goals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[inside.com.tw](https://www.inside.com.tw/article/40584-tesla-ends-model-s-and-model-x-as-flagship-line-makes-way-for-optimus)\n\n**Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now?**\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) is at a critical juncture in its development, with its long-term viability hinging on the success of its upcoming lower-priced truck, the R2, set for release in 2026. While Rivian has achieved notable milestones\u2014producing award-winning vehicles, scaling production, and achieving gross profit in multiple quarters of 2024 and 2025\u2014it remains unprofitable overall, with net losses persisting. The company posted a modest gross profit in Q4 2024, Q1 2025, and Q3 2025, but not in Q2 2025. Despite having $7 billion in cash as of Q3 2025, Rivian's future depends on its ability to transition from serving business customers and high-end consumers to capturing the mass market with the R2. The article cautions that while Rivian has made impressive progress, its capital-intensive nature and intense competition make mass-market success uncertain. The Motley Fool advises most investors to wait for evidence of the R2\u2019s market reception before investing, noting that a weak launch could severely impact the company.

Automotive revenue fell 11% as total vehicle deliveries dropped 16%. CEO Elon Musk confirmed the discontinuation of Model S and Model X production starting in Q1 2026, marking a strategic pivot toward autonomy. Full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions reached 1.1 million users, a 38% year-over-year increase, outpacing vehicle delivery growth of 22%. Robotaxi operations currently serve Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area with around 500 vehicles, with plans to expand to seven new cities in H1 2026. Cybercab production is set to begin in April 2026, with Tesla aiming to double its robotaxi fleet monthly. The company plans to spend over $20 billion on capital expenditures in 2026\u2014more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2025. Free cash flow declined 30% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.

The vehicle is being produced at a newly expanded 2.6 million square foot manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, which was completed in just 11 months. The first validation vehicles\u2014actual production prototypes, not early models\u2014have already rolled off the assembly line, confirming the readiness of key manufacturing processes. The plant has a peak capacity of 215,000 vehicles annually, with 155,000 units allocated to the R2 model. Initially, Rivian planned to produce the R2 in Georgia, but due to delays in that project, the company shifted production to Illinois for speed. The R2 is built on a completely new midsize platform, and while final specifications remain unannounced, Rivian aims to maintain a starting price of approximately $45,000. This pricing is critical for direct competition with the Tesla Model Y; if achieved, the R2 could transition from a brand image vehicle to a serious market contender. The success of the R2 launch could determine whether Rivian becomes a major player in the U.S. mass-market electric vehicle sector or remains a niche producer of premium vehicles.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2026/01/rivian-r2-na-finishnij-pryamij-dolenosnij-elektrokrosover-vzhe-na-konveyeri)\n\n**Rivian Electric Vehicles: Reviews, Pricing, and Specs**\nRivian, a California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, offers a range of vehicles including the R1T pickup truck, the R1S full-size SUV, the mid-size R2 SUV, and upcoming entry-level models R3 and R3X. The R1T has received a perfect 10/10 rating from Car and Driver, with starting prices from $69,300 (2022) to $74,885 (2026) and an EPA-estimated range of 67\u201387 combined miles.

The stock dip reflects investor concerns over weak demand for Rivian\u2019s high-end electric trucks and SUVs, as well as uncertainty ahead of the company\u2019s Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings report on February 12. Despite producing 10,974 vehicles and delivering 9,745 in Q4, Rivian\u2019s total 2025 deliveries reached 42,247 units\u2014below some analyst expectations. The company\u2019s planned expansion into the smaller R2 model, scheduled for release in the first half of 2026, may pressure margins if delayed. Rivian\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen, particularly the software collaboration tied to a new EV platform and a potential $1 billion milestone payment, is under scrutiny, with winter testing ongoing in Sweden. Additionally, Rivian\u2019s ambitious software and services strategy\u2014including self-driving technology and AI-driven features\u2014faces market skepticism, especially after gains from its December Autonomy and AI Day were reversed. The broader EV sector remains turbulent, with the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit in September 2025 and rising competition from Tesla and Lucid compounding challenges. Analysts emphasize Rivian\u2019s need to balance software innovation with cash conservation amid a market reshaped by shifting consumer incentives and technological advancements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/rivian-rivn-stock-dips-feb-12-earnings-ev-demand/)\n\n**Tesla to Discontinue Model S and Model X Production by Q2 2026 to Accelerate Optimus Robot Rollout**\nTesla has announced that the production of its flagship vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, will cease by the second quarter of 2026, according to CEO Elon Musk during the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings call. The vehicles are currently produced at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California factory. Musk stated that the decision marks a transition toward a future centered on autonomous driving, and urged potential buyers to purchase Model S or Model X now. After the discontinuation, the same production space will be repurposed for the production of the humanoid robot project, Optimus, with a target annual capacity of 1 million units at the Fremont plant. Model S, launched in 2012, was widely regarded as the first mass-appeal luxury electric car, while Model X, introduced in 2015, was Tesla\u2019s second major electric vehicle project. Despite upgrades, sales of both models have stagnated in recent years amid increasing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants like Rivian and Lucid. Tesla has been training Optimus prototypes at the Fremont factory for over a year. Musk confirmed in Davos that the robots have already performed simple tasks in the factory and are expected to handle more complex duties by the end of 2025, with public sales projected to begin by the end of 2026. Data collection for Optimus will also start at Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas factory in February 2026. Musk acknowledged the emotional weight of ending the Model S and Model X era, but emphasized that it is time to shift focus toward higher-volume vehicles and cutting-edge initiatives like autonomous driving and robotics, signaling a new phase of scalability and automation for Tesla.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f unwire.hk \u73a9\u751f\u6d3b\uff0e\u6a02\u79d1\u6280](https://unwire.hk/2026/01/29/tesla-ends-model-s-x-production-optimus-robots/life-tech/auto/)\n\n**Tesla plots $20 billion spending spree to build Elon Musk's AI future**\nTesla Inc. announced a $20 billion capital expenditure plan for 2026\u2014double what Wall Street expected\u2014to pivot from an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer toward artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and autonomous driving. The investment will expand production across multiple factories, scale the nascent robotaxi business, and build AI infrastructure. Tesla also revealed plans to discontinue the high-end Model S and Model X vehicles, redirecting that production capacity toward building Optimus humanoid robots. CEO Elon Musk emphasized the company\u2019s 'very, very big investments' during a post-earnings call. The company reached a $2 billion investment agreement with Musk\u2019s xAI startup, including a framework to enhance AI development and deployment in the physical world. This move reinforces the deep integration between Tesla and Musk\u2019s other ventures, despite a prior shareholder vote that failed to pass a nonbinding measure supporting such an investment. Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents, beating analyst estimates by 5 cents, marking the first profit beat in four quarters. However, vehicle deliveries declined 9% year-over-year in 2025, with a 16% drop in the fourth quarter, driven by lower EV demand, increased competition, and the loss of regulatory credit revenue, which fell 22% in Q4. Regulatory credits, once a lucrative income stream, have dried up following the Trump administration\u2019s elimination of penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards. Despite the EV sales slump, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software now has 1.1 million active subscribers\u2014up nearly 40% from a year earlier\u2014and will become subscription-only after February 14. Tesla is expanding its robotaxi service to Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas in the first half of 2026. The company launched automated rideshare operations in Austin in June 2025, began rolling out robotaxis without human supervisors in January 2026, and continues to operate non-autonomous rideshare services in the San Francisco Bay Area, with testing permits in Nevada and Arizona. The stock rose 1.2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor optimism about Tesla\u2019s AI and robotics future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 02:56 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/tesla-plots-20-billion-spending-spree-to-build-elon-musks-ai-future/articleshow/127751060.cms)\n\n**Tesla Discontinues Model S and Model X, Paving the Way for Optimus Robot Production**\nTesla has announced the discontinuation of the Model S and Model X, marking the end of its flagship vehicle lineup as part of a strategic shift toward automation and the production of Optimus humanoid robots. The decision follows years of declining sales, with Model S and Model X combined accounting for a small percentage of Tesla's annual deliveries\u2014over 1.7 million units annually since 2022\u2014leading Tesla to stop reporting their sales separately starting in 2023, grouping them with Cybertruck and Tesla Semi under 'other vehicles.' The Fremont factory, which previously produced these models with a design capacity of about 100,000 units annually, has been operating at low capacity. Elon Musk cited 'autonomy' as the primary reason for the shutdown, stating that production lines will be repurposed for Optimus robots, with a target annual output of 1 million units. Tesla will continue providing after-sales service but will stop deliveries after the second quarter of 2026, with no further production once current inventory is depleted. A minor update in July 2025\u2014adding new colors, a front camera, slightly improved range, and ambient lighting\u2014was widely seen as a token gesture, with prices increased by $5,000 (Model S to $84,990, Model X to $89,990), signaling a farewell tour. Historically, Model S (2012\u20132026) and Model X (2015\u20132026) were pivotal in establishing Tesla\u2019s brand, serving as financial foundations for the more mass-market Model 3 and Model Y, and defining the premium electric vehicle segment. However, platform aging and competition from Lucid Air and Rivian R1S have eroded their market leadership. Industry analysts, including Electrek, note that the decision was 'inevitable' from a manufacturing standpoint due to the high complexity and low volume of these models. The move symbolizes the end of an era, as these vehicles once inspired early adopters and forced traditional automakers to embrace electrification. With the discontinuation of Model S and Model X, Tesla has officially closed the chapter on its flagship era, redirecting resources toward future automation goals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[inside.com.tw](https://www.inside.com.tw/article/40584-tesla-ends-model-s-and-model-x-as-flagship-line-makes-way-for-optimus)\n\n**Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now?**\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) is at a critical juncture in its development, with its long-term viability hinging on the success of its upcoming lower-priced truck, the R2, set for release in 2026. While Rivian has achieved notable milestones\u2014producing award-winning vehicles, scaling production, and achieving gross profit in multiple quarters of 2024 and 2025\u2014it remains unprofitable overall, with net losses persisting. The company posted a modest gross profit in Q4 2024, Q1 2025, and Q3 2025, but not in Q2 2025. Despite having $7 billion in cash as of Q3 2025, Rivian's future depends on its ability to transition from serving business customers and high-end consumers to capturing the mass market with the R2. The article cautions that while Rivian has made impressive progress, its capital-intensive nature and intense competition make mass-market success uncertain. The Motley Fool advises most investors to wait for evidence of the R2\u2019s market reception before investing, noting that a weak launch could severely impact the company.

The company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 delivery count was 9,745, below the Wall Street expectation of 10,050, while production reached 10,974 units at its Normal, Illinois plant. The decline underscores persistent pressure on demand for higher-priced EVs, exacerbated by the expiration of the US $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of September 2025, which led to higher vehicle prices. Rivian, which sells the R1T pickup and R1S SUV at premium price points, is under scrutiny over whether demand can remain resilient as it scales production. The company is implementing efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to reduce material and manufacturing costs in an effort to improve profitability without relying solely on volume growth.

Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, facility during the same period. The decline follows the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025, which increased consumer prices and reduced demand. Premium models like the R1T and R1S were hit hardest due to economic volatility. Rivian is responding with efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to achieve sustainable profitability, as investor patience has waned since the 2020\u20132021 EV boom. The company is preparing to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026, targeting a lower price point to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y and expand its customer base.

The downward revision is attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle leasing, which had previously supported demand.

The company is expected to address 2026 outlook during its February 12 earnings call [20].  \n\n**Supporting Context:**  \n- Q4 2025 deliveries fell to 9,745 units (-31% YoY), attributed partly to the September 2025 expiration of EV tax credits [8][15][19].  \n- The R2 SUV remains Rivian's key growth catalyst for 2026, with production starting in Normal, Illinois (not Georgia) by June 2026 [6][13].  \n- Investor caution persists due to Rivian's 2025 delivery decline (-18% YoY) and unprofitability [11][14][19].  \n\n**Sources:**  \n- 2025 delivery figures [8][14][19][20]  \n- R2 production plans [6][11][13]  \n- Upcoming earnings date [8][20]  \n- Impact of expired EV credits [13][15][19]\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
