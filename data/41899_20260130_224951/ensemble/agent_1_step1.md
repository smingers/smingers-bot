## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Rivian Q1 Historical Performance (2022-2025):**
   - Q1 2022: 1,227
   - Q1 2023: 7,946
   - Q1 2024: 13,588
   - Q1 2025: 8,640
   - **Suitability:** High - directly comparable timeframe and company-specific

2. **Rivian Recent Quarterly Average (2024-2025):**
   - 2024 average: 12,895/quarter
   - 2025 average: 10,562/quarter
   - **Suitability:** Medium - captures recent trend but masks seasonal variation

3. **Post-Tax-Credit EV Market (Q4 2025 onward):**
   - Q4 2025: 9,745 (first full quarter without credits)
   - **Suitability:** High - reflects current market conditions

**Selected Reference Class:** Rivian Q1 2025 (8,640) adjusted for operational changes and market conditions, triangulated with Q4 2025 (9,745) as the most recent data point.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (91 days from today, Jan 30, 2026)

**Historical Q1 Patterns:**
- Q1 typically shows seasonal weakness in auto industry
- Q1 2025 was Rivian's weakest quarter of the year (8,640 vs Q3's 13,201)
- However, Q1 2025 was impacted by demand uncertainty ahead of tax credit expiration
- Q1 historically shows production-delivery alignment except Q1 2025's unusual gap

**Relevant Trends:**
- 36% YoY decline Q1 2024→2025 (13,588→8,640)
- 18% decline FY 2024→2025 (51,579→42,247)
- Q4 2025 showed recovery to 9,745 from Q1's trough
- R2 validation builds ongoing but customer deliveries unlikely before June 2026

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Base Case Reasoning (10,000-11,500 range):**

1. **Sequential Momentum:** Q4 2025's 9,745 deliveries suggests operational stabilization post-tax-credit transition. Q1 2026 should maintain or slightly exceed this baseline.

2. **YoY Comparison Normalization:** Q1 2025's 8,640 was artificially depressed by tax credit uncertainty. With that resolved, demand should be more stable, suggesting 10-20% improvement to 9,500-10,400 range.

3. **Production Capacity:** No confirmed February shutdown. Normal plant can produce ~13,000 units/quarter at current utilization. Management's conservative approach suggests targeting 10,000-12,000 deliveries.

4. **R2 Impact:** Minimal. Validation builds won't contribute to customer deliveries in Q1 2026.

5. **Market Headwinds:** Post-subsidy EV market contraction and Rivian's premium positioning limit upside.

6. **Inventory Release Potential:** The 6,000-unit production-delivery gap from Q1 2025 may have created inventory buffer, allowing deliveries to exceed production if needed.

**Risk Factors:**
- **Downside:** Unannounced plant shutdown, demand deterioration, R1 model obsolescence concerns
- **Upside:** Aggressive inventory clearance, surprise R2 "founder edition" deliveries, improved operational efficiency

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central Tendency:** Agent report suggests 10,500-11,500 base case. This aligns with Q4 2025 (9,745) plus modest sequential growth.

2. **Historical Volatility:** Rivian has shown ±20% quarterly variance. Q1 2025 was 36% below Q1 2024, but this was exceptional.

3. **Asymmetric Risks:** 
   - Downside: Limited to ~7,000 (matching weakest recent quarters with potential shutdown)
   - Upside: Limited to ~14,000 (matching 2024 quarterly peaks without R2 contribution)

4. **Uncertainty Factors:**
   - Feb 12 guidance announcement could shift expectations
   - Unannounced operational changes
   - Market demand volatility
   - Potential early R2 deliveries (low probability)

5. **Tethering to Historical Distribution:**
   - Recent quarters (Q3 2024 - Q1 2026) ranged: 8,640 - 14,183
   - Post-tax-credit quarters: 9,745 - 13,201
   - Q1 specific: 1,227 - 13,588 (but early years irrelevant)

6. **90/10 Confidence Interval:**
   - P10: Conservative scenario with 2-week shutdown or demand shock: ~8,000
   - P90: Optimistic scenario with inventory release and strong demand: ~13,500

**Calibration Logic:**
- P10 (8,000): Slightly below Q1 2025, accounting for potential shutdown
- P20 (9,200): Below Q4 2025, modest sequential decline
- P40 (10,300): Base case lower bound, matching stabilized operations
- P60 (11,200): Base case upper bound, modest sequential growth
- P80 (12,500): Strong quarter matching 2024 averages
- P90 (13,500): Near-optimal performance with inventory release
