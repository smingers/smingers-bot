- No confirmed Q1 2026 shutdown

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large shifts justified):**

1. **Q4 2025 Baseline (9,745):** Multiple independent sources confirm this recent data point. This represents post-tax-credit market reality and operational stabilization. *Direction: Establishes floor around 9,000-10,000.*

2. **R2 Timeline Clarity:** Carscoops (Jan 29) confirms validation builds ongoing but customer deliveries not until June 2026. This eliminates R2 contribution to Q1 2026. *Direction: Caps upside potential.*

3. **Historical Q1 Weakness:** Q1 consistently weakest quarter (2024: 13,588 → 2025: 8,640 = 36% drop). Structural seasonal pattern. *Direction: Suggests Q1 2026 may underperform Q4 2025.*

4. **Production Capacity Utilization:** Q4 2025 produced 10,974 with 9,745 delivered. Plant can sustain 11,000-13,000 quarterly production without R2 ramp. *Direction: Suggests 10,000-12,000 feasible range.*

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate shifts):**

1. **Tax Credit Normalization:** Q4 2025 was first full post-credit quarter. Market has adjusted to new pricing reality. Q1 2026 should reflect similar demand levels. *Direction: Stabilizes around Q4 baseline.*

2. **Inventory Buffer:** Q1 2025 had 6,000-unit production-delivery gap (14,611 produced, 8,640 delivered per electrive.com). Some inventory may be available for Q1 2026 release. *Direction: Modest upside potential.*

3. **Management Guidance Timing:** Feb 12 earnings call will provide Q1 2026 outlook. Current silence suggests cautious positioning. *Direction: Neutral to slightly bearish.*

4. **Analyst Sentiment:** Morgan Stanley downgrade (Dec 2025) and stock decline (30% since Dec) indicate weak near-term expectations. *Direction: Bearish on demand.*

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Minimal adjustments):**

1. **R2 "Halo Effect":** Speculation that R2 buzz could boost R1 sales is unsubstantiated. *Direction: Ignore.*

2. **Unconfirmed Shutdown Rumors:** Agent report states no confirmed February shutdown, but Yahoo (Sept 2025) mentioned September shutdown. *Direction: Assume normal operations.*

3. **Competitive Dynamics:** Tesla Model S/X discontinuation (per AskNews) unlikely to materially impact Rivian Q1. *Direction: Ignore.*

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (61 days remaining from Jan 30, 2026)

**If Timeframe Halved (45 days = Jan-Feb only):**
- Would predict lower (~8,500-9,500) due to capturing only January's typical post-holiday weakness and February's partial month
- Less time for operational improvements or inventory releases

**If Timeframe Doubled (6 months = Q1-Q2 2026):**
- Would predict higher (~22,000-25,000) due to:
  - Q2 seasonal strength (historically stronger than Q1)
  - Potential early R2 deliveries in June 2026
  - Two quarters of stabilized post-credit operations

**Seasonal Pattern Impact:**
- Q1 historically 15-25% below prior Q4 for Rivian
- Q1 2025: 8,640 vs Q4 2024: 14,183 (39% drop, but tax credit distortion)
- Q1 2024: 13,588 vs Q4 2023: 13,972 (3% drop, normal pattern)

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Anchor:** 10,300-11,200 base case (P40-P60)

**Adjustments Based on Evidence:**

1. **Q4 2025 Baseline (9,745) vs Q1 Seasonality:** 
   - Strong evidence suggests Q1 typically 5-15% below Q4
   - Shift: Lower P40 from 10,300 to 9,800; P60 from 11,200 to 10,800
   - *Reasoning:* Q4 2025 is most relevant recent data point, but Q1 seasonal weakness is persistent pattern

2. **No R2 Contribution:**
   - Strong evidence eliminates upside scenario
   - Shift: Cap P90 at 12,500 (down from 13,500)
   - *Reasoning:* June delivery timeline confirmed by multiple sources

3. **Inventory Release Potential:**
   - Moderate evidence of 6,000-unit buffer from Q1 2025
   - Shift: Maintain P60-P80 range for potential inventory drawdown
   - *Reasoning:* Company may prioritize revenue recognition in Q1 before R2 launch

4. **Market Headwinds:**
   - Moderate evidence from analyst downgrades and stock decline
   - Shift: Widen P10-P20 range to 7,500-8,800 (down from 8,000-9,200)
   - *Reasoning:* Demand risk higher than initially assessed

5. **Production Stability:**
   - Strong evidence of consistent ~11k quarterly production capability
   - Shift: Tighten P40-P60 range around 9,500-10,500
   - *Reasoning:* Operational execution has stabilized post-2025 adjustments

**Final Justification:**
The outside view base case of 10,300-11,200 is adjusted downward to 9,500-10,500 due to:
- Q1 seasonal weakness (historical pattern)
- Q4 2025 baseline being more relevant than Q1 2025 (which was distorted)
- No R2 upside contribution
- Balanced by production stability and potential inventory release

The distribution remains relatively wide (P10: 7,500 to P90: 12,500) to account for:
- Uncertainty around unannounced operational changes
- Demand volatility in post-subsidy market
- Potential inventory management strategies
- Unknown unknowns ahead of Feb 12 guidance

## Probability Calibration

**Central Tendency Reasoning:**

**Median (P50) = 10,200:**
- Slightly above Q4 2025 (9,745) due to:
  - Potential inventory release from Q1 2025 buffer
  - Full quarter of stabilized operations
  - Normal seasonal decline (5-10%) from Q4
- Calculation: 9,745 × 1.05 = 10,232 ≈ 10,200

**Mean ≈ 10,100:**
- Slightly below median due to left-tail risk (demand shocks, potential shutdowns)
- Distribution is slightly left-skewed

**Distribution Shape:**
- **P1-P10 (7,000-8,500):** Severe downside scenarios
  - Unannounced 2-week shutdown
  - Demand collapse
  - Major operational disruption
  - Probability: ~9%

- **P10-P40 (8,500-9,800):** Below-baseline scenarios
  - Normal Q1 seasonal weakness
  - Modest demand softness
  - Sequential decline from Q4
  - Probability: ~30%

- **P40-P60 (9,800-10,600):** Base case
  - Q4 baseline with typical seasonal adjustment
  - Stable operations
  - Probability: ~20%

- **P60-P80 (10,600-11,800):** Above-baseline scenarios
  - Inventory release
  - Better-than-expected demand
  - Operational efficiency gains
  - Probability: ~20%

- **P80-P99 (11,800-13,500):** Strong performance
  - Aggressive inventory drawdown
  - Unexpected demand surge
  - Early R2 "preview" deliveries (low probability)
  - Probability: ~19%

**Tail Risk Considerations:**

**Left Tail (P1 = 7,000):**
- Represents catastrophic scenario: major plant shutdown + demand collapse
- Historical minimum recent quarter: Q1 2025 at 8,640
- 7,000 would be ~28% below Q1 2025, requiring severe disruption
- Set conservatively to account for unknown unknowns

**Right Tail (P99 = 13,500):**
- Represents near-optimal scenario: full inventory release + strong demand
- Historical maximum 2025 quarter: Q3 at 13,201
- 13,500 would match 2024 peak quarters
- Requires exceptional execution without R2 contribution
- Capped due to production constraints and R2 resource allocation

**Percentile Calibration Logic:**

- P1 (7,000): Extreme downside, 2+ standard deviations below mean
- P5 (7,800): Severe but plausible downside (10% below Q1 2025)
- P10 (8,500): Conservative scenario, matching Q1 2025 low
- P20 (9,200): Modest underperformance vs Q4 2025
- P40 (9,800): Slight Q1 seasonal decline
- P60 (10,600): Modest outperformance, inventory release
- P80 (11,800): Strong quarter, approaching 2024 averages
- P90 (12,500): Exceptional performance without R2
- P95 (13,000): Near-peak 2025 performance
- P99 (13,500): Theoretical maximum given constraints

## Checklist:

**1. Target Variable:** Total Rivian vehicle deliveries reported for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), all models, in units.

**2. Outside View Base Rate:** 10,300-11,200 (P40-P60), anchored to Q4 2025 baseline (9,745) with seasonal adjustment and historical patterns.

**3. Consistency Check:** 
Implied median = 10,200; mean ≈ 10,100. This aligns with Q4 2025 baseline (9,745) plus modest sequential growth, accounting for Q1 seasonal weakness. Reasonable given production capacity (~11k/quarter) and no R2 contribution.

**4. Top Evidence Pieces:**
- Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries (establishes post-credit baseline)
- R2 customer deliveries not until June 2026 (eliminates upside)
- Q1 historical weakness: 5-15% below Q4 (seasonal pattern)
- Production capacity stable at 11k/quarter (operational floor)
- 6,000-unit inventory buffer from Q1 2025 (modest upside potential)

**5. Blind-spot Scenario:** 
Most likely to make forecast look silly: **Surprise R2 "Founder's Edition" deliveries in March 2026** (pushing outcome to 12,000-14,000). Would push outcome UP significantly. Alternatively, **unannounced 3-week February plant shutdown** for R2 retooling (pushing outcome to 7,000-8,000), would push outcome DOWN.
