4. **Electric-vehicles.com (June 25, 2025)** - Industry publication with analyst opinion. **Key facts:** Q1 2025 confirmed at 8,640 deliveries. **Expert opinion:** Ben Kallo (Baird analyst) projected Q2 2025 at 9,900 deliveries, expecting to miss consensus of 10,600. Revised 2025 guidance to 40,000-46,000 from 46,000-51,000. R2 launch planned for first-half 2026. Factory shutdown planned for H2 2025 for R2 retooling.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive and well-sourced analysis covering Q3 2021 through Q4 2025. **Key historical data:**
- Q1 2024: 13,588 deliveries
- Q1 2025: 8,640 deliveries (36% decline YoY)
- Q4 2025: 9,745 deliveries
- Full-year 2025: 42,247 deliveries (mid-point of 41,500-43,500 guidance)

**Critical facts for Q1 2026:**
- R2 validation builds started January 2026
- First R2 customer deliveries expected June 2026 (not Q1)
- Normal plant capacity: 155k annual (≈3,000/week)
- No confirmed February 2026 shutdown announced
- FY 2026 guidance to be released Feb 12, 2026

**Expert assessment:** Base case 10,500-11,500 deliveries assuming normal operations and no R2 customer units.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Rivian Q1 historical performance (2022-2025):** Q1 2022: 1,227; Q1 2023: 7,946; Q1 2024: 13,588; Q1 2025: 8,640. High variance due to production ramp and market conditions.

2. **Recent quarterly trend (Q3 2025-Q4 2025):** Q3 2025: 13,201; Q4 2025: 9,745. Shows 26% decline from Q3 to Q4, likely due to tax credit expiration pull-forward effect.

3. **2025 quarterly average:** 42,247 ÷ 4 = 10,562 average per quarter.

4. **Post-tax-credit quarters (Q4 2025 onward):** Only Q4 2025 available at 9,745, representing new baseline without federal incentive.

**Most suitable reference class:** The 2025 quarterly average (10,562) adjusted for post-tax-credit reality, using Q4 2025 (9,745) as the most recent comparable data point. Q1 typically shows seasonal weakness in auto sales, but Rivian's limited production history makes this less reliable.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Q1 2026 covers January 1 - March 31, 2026. We are currently at January 30, 2026, meaning ~60% of the quarter remains.

**Historical Q1 patterns:**
- Q1 tends to be weaker seasonally for auto sales
- Q1 2024 → Q1 2025 showed 36% decline (13,588 → 8,640)
- Q4 2025 → Q1 2026 comparison: Q4 2025 was 9,745

**Key differences for Q1 2026:**
- No federal tax credit (ended Sept 30, 2025)
- R2 in validation phase but no customer deliveries expected until June
- No confirmed plant shutdowns
- Plant operating at higher efficiency post-expansion (155k annual capacity)
- Demand uncertainty after tax credit expiration

## (d) Justification

**Outside view synthesis:**

The most reliable baseline is the recent quarterly performance. Q4 2025 delivered 9,745 units in a post-tax-credit environment. Q1 2026 faces similar headwinds:
- Continued absence of federal incentives
- Seasonal weakness in Q1 auto sales
- R2 still in validation (no customer volume contribution)
- Potential demand softness after credit expiration

However, offsetting factors include:
- Plant operating at higher capacity (155k annual = ~38,750 quarterly theoretical max)
- No announced February shutdown
- Management's ability to modulate production to match demand
- Inventory from Q4 2025 production-delivery gap could support Q1 deliveries

The agent's base case of 10,500-11,500 appears reasonable, representing slight improvement over Q4 2025's 9,745 as operations stabilize post-credit expiration. However, downside risks include:
- Unannounced production pauses
- Weaker-than-expected R1 demand
- Seasonal Q1 weakness

Upside potential is limited since R2 customer deliveries won't materialize until Q2 2026 at earliest.

**Central estimate:** ~10,500 deliveries, with meaningful uncertainty band given limited post-tax-credit data and potential for operational surprises.

Outside view calibration:

Given the limited data in the new post-tax-credit regime (only Q4 2025 as reference), I need to establish wide confidence intervals. The historical volatility in Rivian's quarterly deliveries has been substantial:
- Q3 2024 to Q4 2024: +41% (10,018 → 14,183)
- Q4 2024 to Q1 2025: -39% (14,183 → 8,640)
- Q3 2025 to Q4 2025: -26% (13,201 → 9,745)

This volatility suggests a wide distribution is appropriate. Key anchors:
- **Floor (P10):** Severe downside scenario with unannounced shutdown or demand collapse: ~7,500 (similar to Q1 2025's 8,640 but worse)
- **Central tendency (P40-P60):** Based on Q4 2025 performance with modest improvement: 9,500-11,000
- **Ceiling (P90):** Strong execution, no downtime, inventory release, early R2 founders units: ~13,500

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed given management's confidence in maintaining operations and the theoretical capacity to deliver more if demand materializes.
