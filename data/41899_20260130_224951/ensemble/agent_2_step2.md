Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
- **Agent_report (Jan 30, 2026)**: Comprehensive compilation of SEC filings and Rivian press releases. Provides complete quarterly delivery history Q3-2021 through Q4-2025. Most reliable for historical data. Notes R2 customer deliveries "by June 2026" per management.
- **Fintool/Rivian investor relations (Jan 2, 2026)**: Official 2025 annual delivery figure (42,247), Q4 2025 (9,745). Confirms R2 "weeks away from production" as of early January. High factual reliability.
- **Multiple news sources (Jan 28-30, 2026)**: Carscoops, Parameter, Motley Fool reporting R2 validation vehicles already rolling off line in January 2026, with customer deliveries expected "by June 2026." Consistent across sources.

**Secondary Sources (Moderate Quality):**
- **InsideEVs, Intellectia (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026)**: Trade press articles with Q3-Q4 2025 context. Reliable for reporting company statements but include analyst speculation.
- **Morgan Stanley downgrade (Dec 8, 2025)**: Expert opinion on headwinds (EV tax credit expiration, R2 cannibalization risk). Credible source but inherently speculative.

**Key Factual Information vs. Opinion:**
- **Facts**: Q4-2025 deliveries = 9,745; 2025 total = 42,247; R2 validation vehicles in production Jan 2026; no announced Q1-2026 plant shutdown; Normal plant capacity 215,000/year with 155,000 allocated to R2.
- **Opinions**: "Make-or-break" characterizations of R2; analyst price targets; demand projections. These inform context but aren't predictive data.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical Q1 pattern (2022-2025)**: Q1 consistently weakest quarter (Q1-2022: 2,553; Q1-2023: 7,946; Q1-2024: 13,588; Q1-2025: 8,640). Three of four Q1s below annual quarterly average. Structural factor: post-holiday seasonality, winter logistics challenges.
2. **No R2 volume contribution in Q1-2026**: Multiple independent sources confirm R2 customer deliveries begin Q2-2026 at earliest. R2 validation vehicles ≠ customer deliveries. This removes potential upside catalyst.
3. **Tax credit expiration impact**: September 2025 credit expiration demonstrably pulled forward Q3-2025 demand (13,201 deliveries, best quarter), followed by Q4 collapse to 9,745. Q1-2026 faces same post-credit environment as Q4-2025.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **No announced downtime**: Unlike 2025 (3-week summer shutdown), no confirmed Q1-2026 production halt. Allows continuous R1 production but factory likely prioritizing R2 line validation over maximizing R1 output.
2. **Demand ceiling for R1 models**: Morgan Stanley and CEO Scaringe acknowledge premium R1 demand plateauing. Average price ~$90,000 limits addressable market. Q4-2025's 9,745 may represent new steady-state absent stimulus.
3. **Inventory dynamics**: Agent_report notes Rivian entered 2026 with built inventory. Could smooth Q1 deliveries but doesn't indicate pent-up demand surge.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Analyst sentiment shift**: Stock down 30% in January 2026, but this reflects long-term R2 execution risk, not Q1-2026 delivery forecast.
2. **VW partnership milestone**: Potential $1B payment tied to software JV doesn't directly impact Q1 vehicle deliveries.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: 60 days (Jan 30 → Mar 31, 2026 quarter-end; results reported early April 2026).

**If timeframe halved (30 days)**: Would predict Jan-Feb partial deliveries only. Historical monthly patterns show back-loaded quarters, so 30-day forecast would be ~40-50% of quarterly total (4,000-5,000 range).

**If timeframe doubled (120 days, through June)**: Would include early R2 deliveries. June target for first R2 customer units could add 1,000-3,000 vehicles if ramp proceeds smoothly, pushing total to 12,000-15,000 range.

**Key temporal factors**:
- 60-day window too short for production line reconfiguration
- Long enough for seasonal demand patterns (weak Q1) to manifest
- R2 timing creates sharp discontinuity: zero contribution in Q1, potential 20-30% boost in Q2

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 10,800 (mean of last four quarters), 90/10 range 7,500-13,500.

**Adjustments warranted**:

1. **Downward pressure (moderate)**: 
   - Q1 seasonal weakness: Historical Q1 average (2022-2025) = 8,182, 24% below four-quarter average
   - Post-tax-credit environment: Q4-2025 (9,745) represents new baseline without stimulus
   - R2 production prioritization: Factory resources diverted to validation, not maximizing R1 output

2. **Upward pressure (weak)**:
   - No scheduled downtime vs. 2025's summer shutdown
   - Inventory buffer entering 2026

**Net adjustment**: Shift median down ~15% from outside-view baseline to 9,200, reflecting Q1 seasonality and structural demand weakness. However, maintain wide distribution due to:
- Uncertainty in R1 demand stability (could collapse further or stabilize)
- Potential inventory liquidation push (minor upside)
- Macro volatility (interest rates, competition)

**Reference class remains valid**: Despite R2 transition, Q1-2026 deliveries still driven by R1 production at same Normal facility under same market conditions as 2025. Not a regime change—yet.

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency**: Median 9,200 reflects:
- Q4-2025 baseline (9,745) adjusted down 5-6% for typical Q1 seasonal dip
- No R2 contribution
- Weak EV demand environment

**Distribution shape**:
- **Lower tail risk** (P10 = 6,500): Severe demand collapse, unexpected production issues, or inventory glut forcing production cuts
- **Upper tail risk** (P90 = 12,000): Stronger-than-expected R1 demand, aggressive inventory clearance ahead of R2, or delayed R2 ramp keeping R1 production high
- **Asymmetry**: Slightly right-skewed (mean ~9,400 > median 9,200) because upside scenarios (inventory push, demand surprise) can add 2,000-3,000 units, while downside capped by minimum viable production levels (~6,000)

**90/10 confidence interval**: 6,500-12,000 (5,500-unit range, ~60% of median). Wide interval justified by:
- Only one post-tax-credit quarter observed (Q4-2025)
- R2 transition uncertainty affecting factory focus
- Volatile EV market conditions

Checklist:
1. **Target**: Total Rivian vehicle deliveries Q1-2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31), all models, reported ~early April 2026
2. **Base rate**: 10,800 (four-quarter average), adjusted to 9,200 median for Q1 seasonality and post-credit environment
3. **Consistency**: Implied median 9,200, mean ~9,400; aligns with Q4-2025 baseline (9,745) minus seasonal dip, no R2 boost
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Q1 historically 24% below average; (2) No R2 deliveries in Q1; (3) Post-tax-credit demand weakness; (4) Q4-2025 = 9,745 new baseline; (5) No announced downtime
5. **Blind spot**: R1 demand collapses faster than Q4 suggests (e.g., 40% drop to ~6,000) if market perceives R1 as obsolete ahead of R2—would push outcome to lower tail
