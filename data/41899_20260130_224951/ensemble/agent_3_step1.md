Analysis:
• Source analysis:
  – Rivian Q1 2024/2025 articles and SEC filings (including the Agent Report) provide a detailed historical record of quarterly deliveries from Q3 2021 through Q4 2025. Although some earlier extractions (from Rivian’s newsroom and Electrive) suffered from incomplete details, the compiled Agent Report synthesizes raw quarterly numbers with source citations and includes management guidance and details on potential plant downtime.
  – The electrive.com and Yahoo/TechStock² articles offer dated quantitative data (up through early January 2026 for Q4 2025) and opinions on near‐term challenges such as production–delivery gaps and planned factory retooling. These opinions come from identifiable experts (e.g., analysts from Baird and quoted factory/management commentary) and are thus weighed as factually informative.
  – The Agent Report, dated early January 2026 and compiled from multiple sources, combines hard numbers, management guidance for 2026, and an analysis of the rumored February downtime. It clearly distinguishes between historical facts (e.g., actual quarterly deliveries) and forward‐looking assessments (scenarios for Q1 2026).
  
• Reference class analysis:
  – One class is the historical quarterly delivery data for Rivian, which reveals substantial variation—from a low of about 8,640 (Q1 2025) to highs above 13,500 (Q1/ Q4 2024). However, production–delivery gap factors, planned production outages, and the introduction of the R2 platform advise caution when directly extrapolating.
  – A second class is the operational throughput and capacity trends. With Normal plant now rated at a capacity of 3,000 vehicles per week and recent performance trending around 10,500 to 11,500 deliveries (base case scenario), this reference better suits the short-term forecast.
  – The most suitable reference class is the throughput/capacity trend data combined with management’s 2025–2026 operational guidance, since it reflects both historical run rates and anticipated operating conditions.
  
• Timeframe analysis:
  – The forecast horizon is Q1 2026 (a 13‐week period from January to March 2026) with the outcome revealed on or just after May 1, 2026.
  – Historical patterns over comparable quarters (adjusted for noted anomalies such as the September 2025 tool-out pause and the tax credit expiration) suggest that under normal operating conditions Q1 deliveries would be near the 10,500 to 11,500 mark.
  
• Justification:
  – The Agent Report’s scenario analysis indicates a base case (normal three-shift operations with no unplanned downtime) expecting deliveries between 10,500 and 11,500. A downtime scenario (two‐week stoppage) lowers this to roughly 8,500–9,500, whereas an upside case with the addition of a token batch of R2 units in late March raises the range to 11,000–12,000.
  – Given the current lack of confirmed Q1 2026 downtime and management’s intent to maintain efficiency, the base case appears the most likely outcome. However, uncertainty about any last‐minute schedule adjustments or unexpected market/macro demand shifts calls for a distribution with a wider tail.
  – Considering the historical rate of upsets in production/delivery numbers in the EV sector, a wide 90/10 confidence spread is justified. This analysis thus integrates hard data, scenario evaluation, and informed assumptions on operational continuity.

Outside view calibration:
  – We base our distribution on the three scenarios. Using the base scenario as the center, we set a lower 10th percentile near the downturn scenario (about 8,500 vehicles) and an upper 90th percentile near the upside scenario (about 12,000 vehicles). Intermediate percentiles are then positioned to capture moderate uncertainties and the inherent quarter-to-quarter volatility in delivery numbers.
  – We anchor the true probability distribution to these scenarios, mindful that even small shifts in designations can reshape the cumulative distribution function. Historical variability and occasional unexpected disruptions in production justify a relatively wide spread.

Percentile 40: 10200
Percentile 60: 11000
