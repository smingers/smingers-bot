Analysis:
We are forecasting the total number of Rivian vehicles delivered in Q1 2026 (measured in vehicles, for the period January 1 – March 31, 2026). Our outside view starts with the historical quarterly performance. In 2025, Rivian delivered an average of roughly 10500 vehicles per quarter (42,247 for 2025 overall) but with notable volatility. Q4 2025 came in at 9745 deliveries; Q1 2025 was much lower (about 8640), likely influenced by the pull‐forward effect before the expiry of the federal EV tax credit. In Q1 2026 we face a comparable post-tax-credit environment with no R2 customer deliveries (their production is only beginning validation and won’t contribute until June 2026). Thus, we expect that operations for the R1 models (R1T and R1S) will continue on a similar basis to late 2025 but with a slight potential for operational stabilization. 

(a) Source analysis:
• Articles from Fintool, InsideEVs, and Carscoops (dated late 2025 and early January 2026) confirm that 2025 ended at roughly 42,247 deliveries overall and Q4 deliveries were near 9745. These are independent and reliable (from established industry and financial sources), and they present factual quarterly delivery numbers.
• Additional Asknews articles and investor commentaries (from early January 2026) explain that while R2 validation has begun, customer deliveries for the new mainstream model won’t appear until mid-2026. Thus, none of the R2 unit numbers will help boost Q1 2026.
• Opinions by analysts (Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, etc.) generally underline existing demand headwinds in the post-tax-credit environment.
The factual delivery numbers (Q4 2025 = 9745, 2025 annual ~42247) combined with expert analysis are strong evidence for our reference class, and the direct causal mechanism (loss of the tax credit, seasonal weakness in Q1, no R2 deliveries) is clear.

(b) Evidence analysis:
• Strong evidence: The Q4 2025 delivery number (9745) and full‐year 2025 total (42247) are key historical facts.
• Moderate evidence: The seasonal patterns seen in Q1 2025 (down from Q4) and the absence of R2 volumes in Q1 2026 suggest that Q1 2026 won’t see a dramatic uplift.
• Weak evidence: Anecdotal forward–looking comments from management have less weight since early R2 validation does not generate sales.
This evidence weighs toward a base case in the 10000–11200 range with a median central scenario near 10000–10500, though our distribution must reflect uncertainty.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
The forecast covers Q1 2026 – a three‐month window starting January 1 and ending March 31, 2026 (about 90 days). As of today (January 30, 2026) roughly two months remain. If the timeframe were halved (e.g. a one‐month period), deliveries would be lower in absolute numbers; if doubled (six months), cumulative deliveries would approximately double subject to production capacity. Hence our forecast remains tied to quarterly performance.

(d) Justification:
The most compelling factors are:
1. Q4 2025 deliveries of 9745 units represent the most recent experience in the current post-tax-credit environment.
2. In contrast, Q1 2025 had a noticeable seasonal dip (about 8640 units), but that was influenced by the tax credit pull-forward effect earlier. In Q1 2026, while still challenging, operations are expected to maintain near Q4 2025 performance as production normalizes.
3. The R2 remains on validation, so its expected “make‐or‐break” impact will not help Q1 2026, keeping deliveries in a similar range.
4. Analyst sentiment and structural factors (loss of federal EV credit, uncertainty in demand for R1 models) point toward only modest improvement.
These reasons justify shifting the outside view from the quarterly average slightly upward relative to Q4 2025 (to account for stabilization) while keeping the median below 11000. Our chosen probability distribution is therefore rooted in the historical performance with an allowance for variability.

Probability calibration:
Our calibrated distribution centers around roughly 10000–10500 as the likely median outcome. Given the evidence, there is a probability of strong downside (if further operational or demand issues arise) with outcomes around 7500–8500 on the low side, and a moderate chance of better-than-expected stabilization pushing Q1 numbers to 13800–15000 in extreme cases. Hence, we assign wide 90/10 intervals to cover unknown unknowns.

Checklist:
1. Target: Total vehicle deliveries (vehicles) in Q1 2026 (Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026).
2. Outside view base rate: ~10500 per quarter in 2025; adjust for tax credit and seasonal effects.
3. Consistency check: Implied median ≈10000–10500; mean slightly above median; this aligns with the historical Q4 data and our reasoning.
4. Significant evidence:
   • Q4 2025 delivery count (9745) as a strong factual anchor.
   • Seasonal dip in Q1 2025 due to pull-forward effects (supports lack of tax credit boost).
   • R2’s delayed ramp (ensures focus remains on R1 models).
5. Blind-spot: An unexpected surge from an early R2 production breakthrough in Q1 2026 could push deliveries up; if this happens, our forecast will look low.
