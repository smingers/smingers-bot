Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Rivian Q1-2024 financial-results and production-figures press releases – Primary data, company-issued, April 2024.  High factual value for historic deliveries but the crawled text supplied is incomplete.  
2. Electrive.com, 4-Apr-2025 – Trade-press article quoting Rivian’s Q1-2025 8-K.  Gives 14 611 produced / 8 640 delivered.  Factual numbers come straight from Rivian; commentary on the “striking” gap is journalist opinion.  Reliable for the raw figures.  
3. EV/Cláudio Afonso, 25-Jun-2025 – Analyst note (Baird).  Provides consensus forecasts and mentions a three-week 2H-2025 shutdown.  The shutdown dates are expert opinion; delivery numbers for Q1-2025 are factual.  
4. Yahoo Finance, 4-Sep-2025 – Lay-offs article.  Confirms September-2025 re-tooling and quotes Rivian CFO that Q3-2025 would be the peak quarter.  Factual for dates and quotes; the inference of “surge then slump” is reporter opinion.  
5. Unrelated “Grey’s Anatomy” piece – irrelevant, ignored.  
6. Agent_report (30-Jan-2026) – Compiles SEC filings, Rivian press releases, local media (WGLT, Pantagraph, TechStock²).  Dates are current (Jan-2026).  Gives a full quarterly-deliveries table Q3-2021–Q4-2025, notes no confirmed February-2026 downtime, and summarises management statements on R2 timing (first customer deliveries “by June 2026”).  Quality: very high for historic numbers (all trace to Rivian filings) but still second-hand for 2026 guidance (which Rivian will not release until 12-Feb-2026).

Factual nuggets extracted  
• Q1-2024 deliveries: 13 588  
• Q1-2025 deliveries: 8 640  
• Q2-Q4-2025 deliveries: 10 661 / 13 201 / 9 745  
• No announced plant shutdown for Jan-Mar 2026.  
• R2 customer deliveries start no earlier than Q2-2026.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Rivian’s own past Q1 deliveries (2022–2025).  
2. Rivian’s overall quarterly deliveries regardless of season (Q3-2021–Q4-2025).  
3. Other US EV start-ups’ first quarters (Lucid, Fisker, Nikola) – rejected: different scale and business models.  
Class 2 is best: 17 observations, same plant, same reporting conventions; captures production volatility and policy shocks.

Quarterly deliveries distribution (class 2)  
Min = 11, 25th ≈ 4 500, median ≈ 8 900, 75th ≈ 13 800, max ≈ 15 600.  A simple log-normal fit gives geometric mean around 8 900 and σln ≈ 0.45.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome due 92 days from today (Jan 30 → Mar 31 close; Rivian usually reports first week of April).  Over such a short horizon Rivian cannot meaningfully add extra lines; deliveries are capped by Normal plant throughput (≈ 3 000/week ≈ 39 000/quarter potential).  In 2025 the plant averaged ~2 050/week in its best quarter (Q3).  So capacity ceiling is not binding; demand and any downtime drive the result.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Status quo (no downtime, no R2 yet) implies repeating a “middle” 2025 quarter.  Mean of the last four non-tax-credit quarters (Q2-25, Q3-25, Q4-25): 11 202.  Policy environment is slightly worse (credit gone), but Rivian enters 2026 with more built inventory and no known shutdown.  I therefore anchor the central estimate at 10 800.  Historical quarter-to-quarter σ is about 1 900; that scale defines the width of the forecast distribution.  Unknown-unknown upside is limited by 20 000 vehicle upper bound in the task; downside bounded at zero.

Outside view calibration:

• Distribution taken as normal with μ = 10 800, σ = 2 000 but truncated at 0 and 20 000.  
• That yields the following percentiles (rounded to nearest 100).  
• 90/10 interval spans 6 000 vehicles, consistent with roughly three standard deviations of past variability.  
• Historical “upsets” (e.g., Q1-2025 plunge) suggest ~10 % chance of < 8 000 even without scheduled downtime; that is reflected in the 10th percentile.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7 500  
Percentile 20: 8 500  
Percentile 40: 9 800  
Percentile 60: 10 800  
Percentile 80: 12 000  
Percentile 90: 13 500
