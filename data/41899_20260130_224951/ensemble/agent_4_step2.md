Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight first)

1. Fintool 2 Jan 2026 “Rivian Meets 2025 Guidance…” – Hard numbers for 2025 and Q4 2025 deliveries, factory capacity, and management quotes. Reliability: high; cites Rivian filings and earnings calls.  (Facts>opinions)

2. InsideEVs / Carscoops Oct 2025–Jan 2026 pieces – Give quarterly delivery history, revised 2025 guidance, and detailed R2 timing (validation vehicles January 2026, mass-production June 2026). Reliability: medium/high; specialist EV outlets with access to Rivian spokespeople.

3. Parameter & ETAuto Jan 2026 market notes – Repeat the 2025 actual deliveries and emphasise weak R1 demand ahead of Feb 12 earnings. Reliability: medium; data cross-checks with 1.

4. Volkswagen-JV/Rivian shareholder letters (quoted in 1) – Factory capacity (Normal 215000 units p.a.), no sign of planned Q1 downtime. Reliability: high; primary company source.

5. Sell-side analyst sentiment pieces (Morgan Stanley, Cantor, Motley Fool) – Only opinions; used for context but not counted as hard evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• 42 247 deliveries in 2025, split 9745 in Q4 → recent run-rate ≈ 3250/wk production, 3000/wk deliveries. (Sources 1,3)  
• No scheduled shutdowns before late-May R2 re-tool; Normal plant rated at 3000+/wk (Sources 1,4).  
Moderate evidence  
• Post-tax-credit demand sag: Q4 deliveries –31 % y/y (Sources 1,3) → risk R1 sales soften further.  
• Possible light R2 pilot batch late-March (Sources 2) could add a few hundred units upside.  
Weak evidence  
• Analyst downgrades citing “EV demand collapse” – qualitative, non-quantified (Source 5).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until quarter-end: 61; until resolution: 92.  
Halving (46 days): we would already have mid-quarter production whispers → narrower IQR, maybe ±800 vehicles.  
Doubling (184 days): by then we’d have actual Q1 number; residual uncertainty ≤200 vehicles (reporting adjustments).

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view baseline: average of last four quarters = 11275.  
Adjustments:  
– Demand softening after tax-credit expiry (-1500).  
– Early-Q R1 price incentives add back perhaps +300.  
– No plant downtime (+0).  
– Chance of 200–400 R2 “pre-deliveries” late March (+250 median).  
Net inside-view median ≈ 10600.  
Historical q-to-q sd ~1200; keep similar spread but fatten tails for execution risk.

Probability calibration
Implied median ≈ 10600; mean ≈ 10750. Distribution skewed slightly high in case R2 pilot batch materialises; 90 % range 8000–12000 accounts for demand or logistics shocks.

Checklist:
1. Target: “Total Rivian vehicle deliveries, Q1 2026, units, worldwide.”  
2. Outside base 11275 → inside 10600 after demand & pilot-batch adjustments.  
3. Implied median 10600; mean 10750; consistent with factors.  
4. Key evidence: Q4 run-rate 9745; plant capacity steady; tax-credit expiry drag; no Q1 downtime; possible R2 trickle-in.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden two-week parts shortage halts production → deliveries <7500 (downside).
