Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Electrive (4-Apr-2025) – Factual reporting of Rivian’s Q1-2025 production (14 611) and deliveries (8 640). Good specialist outlet, numbers match subsequent SEC filings.  
2. EV / “Baird Sees Rivian Missing Q2 Delivery Consensus” (25-Jun-2025) – Provides Wall-St. consensus, quotes named analyst Ben Kallo.  Useful for gauging market expectations; opinion content clearly attributed.  
3. Yahoo Finance (4-Sep-2025) – Reports 200 layoffs and September-25 three-week plant shutdown.  Straight-news piece, quotes Rivian CFO.  Reliable for operational timing.  
4. TechStock² summary of Rivian 8-K (3-Jan-2026) – Gives audited Q4-2025 deliveries (9 745) and FY-2025 total (42 247).  Primary data originates from Rivian’s SEC filing → high confidence.  
5. WGLT (26-Jan-2026) – Local NPR affiliate covering Rivian plant.  States post-expansion rated capacity 155 k/yr and first R2 customer deliveries “by June 2026”.  Credible regional source.  
6. Agent_report – Compiles a full quarterly delivery series 2021-2025 and collates guidance/downtime rumours.  Most figures traceable to Rivian IR or SEC documents; I cross-checked three spot numbers (Q1-2024, Q1-2025, Q4-2025) and all match the public record.  Treated as a high-quality digest, not an independent primary source.  
Irrelevant (discarded): Grey’s Anatomy article.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. Rivian’s own historical first-quarter deliveries (2022-2025).  
2. Lucid or Fisker early-scale EV startups.  
3. Seasonality of mature OEM BEV divisions (Tesla, GM).  
Rivian’s own Q1 history is closest in product mix, price band and factory constraints, so I adopt it as the primary reference class, augmented with Rivian’s most recent quarter (Q4-2025).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → 30-Jan-2026. Deliveries to be measured over 1 Jan – 31 Mar 2026; results likely released first week of April, i.e. ~65 days until data are locked in and ~90 days to public disclosure.  
Historical Q1 pattern:  
Q1-2022 1 227  
Q1-2023 7 946  
Q1-2024 13 588  
Q1-2025 8 640  
Mean = 7 850 Median = 8 293.  
Variation is driven by ramp-ups, incentives and a 2025 production-delivery gap.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Baseline: use the last two quarters as the best demand-constrained steady-state.  
• Q3-2025 13 201 (pre-credit pull-forward)  
• Q4-2025  9 745 (post-credit slump)  
Simple average = 11 473; however, Q4-2025 better mirrors the incentive-free environment of Q1-2026.  

Adjustments to Q4-2025 baseline:  
+ Seasonality Historically Q1 runs ≈ 0.88 of Q4 (from 2023-25 data) → 9 745 × 0.88 ≈ 8 575.  
± Plant downtime No firm February shutdown announced; assign 30 % chance of a 2-week stoppage (≈ –2 000 units), 70 % chance of none.  Expected impact = –600.  
+ Logistics catch-up The 2025 production-delivery gap left ~5 000 vehicles in inventory.  Assume 1 000 are cleared in Q1-2026 → +1 000.  
+ Early R2 trickle Management guides “by June 2026”.  I give 20 % chance of 500 R2s shipping in late March → +100 expected units.

Expected value ≈ 8 575 – 600 + 1 000 + 100 = 9 075 → round to 9 100 vehicles.

Uncertainty drivers: unannounced downtime, demand erosion, the size and timing of any R2 founders’ batch.  A look at Rivian’s quarterly volatility since 2023 suggests a ±2 000 vehicle one-sigma band, giving 90 % of mass inside roughly ±3 000.

Outside view calibration:

I model a roughly normal core with fatter tails clipped at 0 and 20 000. The 10th/90th percentiles are set ~3 000 either side of the mean (9 100), with a slight right skew for the low-probability R2 upside.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 6 000  
Percentile 20: 7 000  
Percentile 40: 8 500  
Percentile 60: 9 700  
Percentile 80: 11 000  
Percentile 90: 12 200
