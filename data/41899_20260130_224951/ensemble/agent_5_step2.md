Analysis:  
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, all dates ≤ 30 Jan 2026)  
1. Rivian 8-K (3 Jan 2026) – primary, audited delivery totals for 2025; high quality, purely factual.  
2. Fintool (2 Jan 2026) – recaps FY-25 deliveries, Q4-25 numbers, cites 8-K; mixes data (strong) and author opinion (ignore).  
3. InsideEVs (2 Oct 2025) – Q3-25 delivery data and revised 2025 guidance; reputable EV outlet; factual + CEO quotes.  
4. Carscoops (29 Jan 2026) – photos/description of first R2 validation vehicles and Normal-plant capacity; factual, first-hand images; some enthusiasm is opinion.  
5. Parameter (29 Jan 2026) – market wrap; repeats Q4-25 data; opinions from unnamed analysts (down-weight).  
6. Sherwood News (8 Dec 2025) – Morgan Stanley downgrade; sentiment only, no delivery data; weak evidence.  
7. Motley Fool (30 Jan 2026) – long-term revenue discussion; repeats FY-25 deliveries; mostly opinion; weak for Q1-26.  
8. WGLT local radio (26 Jan 2026) – states Normal capacity 155000 for R2, first customer units “by June 26”; quote from plant spokesperson; moderate quality.  

(b) Evidence weighting (re: Q1 2026 deliveries)  
Strong:  
• Rivian’s own Q4-25 delivery (9745) & FY-25 total (42247) – establishes most recent run-rate after tax-credit expiry.  
Moderate:  
• Historical Q1 pattern (2022-25) – shows seasonality & volatility.  
• Capacity utilisation data from Rivian/WGLT – indicates no major physical constraint.  
• InsideEVs/Carscoops – R2 validation timing implies negligible Q1 contribution (<500 units).  
Weak:  
• Analyst sentiment, share-price moves, macro EV demand articles – indirect link to near-term deliveries.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome locked 1 Apr 2026 → 62 days away.  If the horizon were halved (31 days) most Q1 production already scheduled, variance would narrow ~20 %.  If doubled (124 days) R2 ramp uncertainty would grow, widening right-tail above 12000.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments to outside-view base rate  
Outside-view base: average of last two quarters (Q3-25 13201, Q4-25 9745) = 11473; choose Q4-25 (9745) as better match to post-credit demand.  
Adjustments:  
− Seasonality: Rivian Q1 tends to run 0.85-0.90 of preceding Q4 (historical mean 0.88) → 8570.  
− Possible two-week February retooling (30 % chance) → expected –600.  
+ Inventory draw-down (~5000 carried end-25, typical 20 % cleared next quarter) → +1000.  
+ Micro batch of R2 founder vehicles (20 % chance of 500 units late-March) → +100.  
Expected value ≈ 8570 - 600 + 1000 + 100 ≈ 9070 → round 9100 as median.  Historical quarterly σ≈1800; retain but skew slightly right for R2 upside.  

Probability calibration  
Mean ≈ 9200, median ≈ 9100.  90 % CI set [5000, 13000] acknowledging execution/demand risk but capping below 20000 plant limit.  Right-tail small probability of early R2 success; left-tail covers severe demand drop or unplanned shutdown.  

Checklist:  
1. Target: “Total vehicles Rivian delivers worldwide 1 Jan-31 Mar 2026, units”.  
2. Outside-view base: Q4-25 deliveries 9745.  
3. Consistency: implied median 9100, mean 9200; aligns with adjustments & σ.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Q4-25 deliveries 9745 after tax-credit expiry.  
   – Historical Q1≈0.88×Q4 seasonality.  
   – No announced Q1 downtime; small 30 % risk scenario.  
   – 5000 vehicles in inventory available to ship.  
   – R2 validation cars spotted, but customer deliveries unlikely before June.  
5. Blind-spot: fleet deal or incentive revival triggers sudden R1 demand spike → outcome >13000.
