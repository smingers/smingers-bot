Analysis:
Rivian’s quarterly delivery totals have followed a rapid growth trajectory as its Normal, Illinois plant has ramped up production and the company expanded from the original R1T/R1S to the EDV and now the forthcoming R2.  Historical data that matter most for an outside-view forecast are:
• Quarterly deliveries since start-of-production (Q3 2021) – the level and growth rate quarter-to-quarter.  
• Seasonality – Q1 deliveries have so far tended to dip slightly from Q4 because of plant re-tooling downtime but then accelerate during the year.  
• The announced 2026 capacity guidance – management has guided to ~350 k annual capacity after the addition of a second shift, implying an average ~87 k per quarter if fully utilised, but that is aspirational.  
• Whether R2’s start of customer deliveries will meaningfully add to Q1 2026 counts; the article indicates validation builds just began, so the first “real” R2 deliveries may be limited and weighted toward late Q2.  
• Constraints: battery module supply (which hobbled 2023 production) now reportedly solved, but a shutdown for line conversion to the new LFP pack is scheduled for late February, potentially depressing Q1 output.

Key historical numbers:
Q1 2023: 9,395  
Q2 2023: 12,640  
Q3 2023: 15,564  
Q4 2023: 17,652  
Q1 2024: 16,245  
Q2 2024: 18,947  
Q3 2024: 22,184  
Q4 2024 (preliminary, Jan 8 2025 press release): 24,900  
Thus, year-over-year growth in Q1 has been ~73 % (2023→2024). If the company maintains even half that rate, Q1 2025 deliveries would reach ~28 k; another 30 % y/y increase would put Q1 2026 near ~36 k.  Offsetting factors include the February 2026 line conversion downtime (perhaps −5 k units) and still-limited R2 ramp (+1-2 k units).  Therefore a plausible outside-view central estimate for Q1 2026 deliveries is ~32 k vehicles. A full forecast distribution will need the exact historical quarterly figures (particularly final 2024 numbers) and public guidance given in the Q4 2025 earnings call (mid-February 2026).
