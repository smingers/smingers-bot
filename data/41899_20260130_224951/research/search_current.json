The company produces the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans (EDVs) for Amazon and others, with plans to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026. In 2022, Rivian produced only 24,337 vehicles (vs. a 50,000 target), delivering 20,332. Production rose to 57,232 in 2023 with 50,122 deliveries, but dipped to 49,476 in 2024, with deliveries reaching 51,579 despite inflation, high interest rates, reduced EV subsidies, and competition. For 2025, Rivian expects deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. Over the next five years, analysts project Rivian\u2019s revenue will grow at a 31% CAGR from 2024 to 2027, with net losses narrowing. The company aims to boost gross margins through clean energy credit sales, subscription services, upgrades, and licensing. A joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) is advancing new EV architecture and software. Rivian plans to open its Georgia plant and triple production capacity by 2028. If Rivian achieves a 20% revenue CAGR through 2031 and trades at 5x sales by 2031\u2014up from under 3x sales in 2024\u2014its stock could rise more than sixfold. However, this growth depends on successful scaling, market expansion, and overcoming macro and microeconomic headwinds. The Motley Fool notes Rivian\u2019s stock is currently undervalued, trading at less than three times 2024 sales.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:35 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/30/where-will-rivian-stock-be-in-5-years/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=6667fdc5-1538-43b3-9d48-2e406b810d1a)\n\n**CNET Cars: Navigate Your World in This New Age of Transportation**\nCNET Cars presents a comprehensive overview of the evolving transportation landscape, highlighting key developments in electric vehicles, autonomous technology, and personal mobility.

In the United States, key developments include GM\u2019s Chevy Silverado EV Max launch in January 2026 with bidirectional charging, which outsold expectations by 30%, a DOE grant supporting QuantumScape\u2019s sodium-ion battery pilots, and 10,000 new residential chargers deployed in high-density states like California and Texas. Ford introduced the next-gen F-150 Lightning with solid-state battery technology in December 2025, offering a 400-mile range and 20-minute charging, securing major fleet orders. Rivian received a $5 billion DOE loan for a gigafactory in Georgia, and regulatory updates accelerated NEVI charging corridor deployments, adding 500 new fast chargers nationwide. In November 2025, the U.S. government expanded federal tax credits for domestic EV battery production, boosting investments by Tesla and GM to localize supply chains. Monthly EV sales reached a record 15% market share, driven by affordable models from legacy automakers. In Japan, Mitsubishi launched an eK X EV successor with a 200km range in January 2026, reinforcing kei-car dominance at 75% of BEV sales. Panasonic-Idemitsu\u2019s joint venture scaled solid-electrolyte production to support Toyota\u2019s EV roadmap. Japan reaffirmed its 100% electrified new vehicle sales goal by 2035, including HEVs and PHEVs, with tax incentives for compliant models. Honda unveiled AI-integrated electrified powertrains for its 0 Series EVs in December 2025, featuring predictive energy management, while hybrid sales rose to 35% share, led by Toyota\u2019s Allfard and Vellfire plug-in models. Toyota began mass production of sulfide-based solid-state batteries in Tokyo in November 2025, targeting 60,000 units annually. Nissan expanded its Sakura kei-car BEV lineup, and METI approved new incentives for FCEV infrastructure linked to 2035 electrification targets.

The vehicle is being produced at a newly expanded 2.6 million square foot manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, which was completed in just 11 months. The first validation vehicles\u2014actual production prototypes, not early models\u2014have already rolled off the assembly line, confirming the readiness of key manufacturing processes. The plant has a peak capacity of 215,000 vehicles annually, with 155,000 units allocated to the R2 model. Initially, Rivian planned to produce the R2 in Georgia, but due to delays in that project, the company shifted production to Illinois for speed. The R2 is built on a completely new midsize platform, and while final specifications remain unannounced, Rivian aims to maintain a starting price of approximately $45,000. This pricing is critical for direct competition with the Tesla Model Y; if achieved, the R2 could transition from a brand image vehicle to a serious market contender. The success of the R2 launch could determine whether Rivian becomes a major player in the U.S. mass-market electric vehicle sector or remains a niche producer of premium vehicles.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2026/01/rivian-r2-na-finishnij-pryamij-dolenosnij-elektrokrosover-vzhe-na-konveyeri)\n\n**Rivian Electric Vehicles: Reviews, Pricing, and Specs**\nRivian, a California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, offers a range of vehicles including the R1T pickup truck, the R1S full-size SUV, the mid-size R2 SUV, and upcoming entry-level models R3 and R3X. The R1T has received a perfect 10/10 rating from Car and Driver, with starting prices from $69,300 (2022) to $74,885 (2026) and an EPA-estimated range of 67\u201387 combined miles.

The R2 SUV is projected to start at $45,000 (estimated) for the 2026 model year, while the R3 and R3X are expected to launch in 2027 as more affordable, compact options. Rivian also produces an electric commercial van used by Amazon, with a starting price of $79,900 (2026 model). All vehicles emphasize off-road capability and advanced technology. Car and Driver has awarded the R1T and R1S the '10Best' and 'EV of the Year' accolades, and both models are recognized as 'Editors' Choice' and 'C/D Rating' winners.\nOriginal language: unknown\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:26 PM\nSource:[caranddriver.com](https://caranddriver.com/rivian/)\n\n**Rivian (RIVN) Stock: Dips Ahead of Feb. 12 Earnings Amid Weak EV Demand**\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares declined to $15.20 on January 29, 2026, a 0.5% drop for the day but a nearly 30% decline since late December 2025, when they closed at $21.75. The stock dip reflects investor concerns over weak demand for Rivian\u2019s high-end electric trucks and SUVs, as well as uncertainty ahead of the company\u2019s Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings report on February 12. Despite producing 10,974 vehicles and delivering 9,745 in Q4, Rivian\u2019s total 2025 deliveries reached 42,247 units\u2014below some analyst expectations. The company\u2019s planned expansion into the smaller R2 model, scheduled for release in the first half of 2026, may pressure margins if delayed. Rivian\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen, particularly the software collaboration tied to a new EV platform and a potential $1 billion milestone payment, is under scrutiny, with winter testing ongoing in Sweden. Additionally, Rivian\u2019s ambitious software and services strategy\u2014including self-driving technology and AI-driven features\u2014faces market skepticism, especially after gains from its December Autonomy and AI Day were reversed. The broader EV sector remains turbulent, with the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit in September 2025 and rising competition from Tesla and Lucid compounding challenges. Analysts emphasize Rivian\u2019s need to balance software innovation with cash conservation amid a market reshaped by shifting consumer incentives and technological advancements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/rivian-rivn-stock-dips-feb-12-earnings-ev-demand/)\n\n**Tesla to Discontinue Model S and Model X Production by Q2 2026 to Accelerate Optimus Robot Rollout**\nTesla has announced that the production of its flagship vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, will cease by the second quarter of 2026, according to CEO Elon Musk during the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings call. The vehicles are currently produced at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California factory. Musk stated that the decision marks a transition toward a future centered on autonomous driving, and urged potential buyers to purchase Model S or Model X now. After the discontinuation, the same production space will be repurposed for the production of the humanoid robot project, Optimus, with a target annual capacity of 1 million units at the Fremont plant. Model S, launched in 2012, was widely regarded as the first mass-appeal luxury electric car, while Model X, introduced in 2015, was Tesla\u2019s second major electric vehicle project. Despite upgrades, sales of both models have stagnated in recent years amid increasing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants like Rivian and Lucid. Tesla has been training Optimus prototypes at the Fremont factory for over a year. Musk confirmed in Davos that the robots have already performed simple tasks in the factory and are expected to handle more complex duties by the end of 2025, with public sales projected to begin by the end of 2026. Data collection for Optimus will also start at Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas factory in February 2026. Musk acknowledged the emotional weight of ending the Model S and Model X era, but emphasized that it is time to shift focus toward higher-volume vehicles and cutting-edge initiatives like autonomous driving and robotics, signaling a new phase of scalability and automation for Tesla.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f unwire.hk \u73a9\u751f\u6d3b\uff0e\u6a02\u79d1\u6280](https://unwire.hk/2026/01/29/tesla-ends-model-s-x-production-optimus-robots/life-tech/auto/)\n\n**Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now?**\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) is at a critical juncture in its development, with its long-term viability hinging on the success of its upcoming lower-priced truck, the R2, set for release in 2026. While Rivian has achieved notable milestones\u2014producing award-winning vehicles, scaling production, and achieving gross profit in multiple quarters of 2024 and 2025\u2014it remains unprofitable overall, with net losses persisting. The company posted a modest gross profit in Q4 2024, Q1 2025, and Q3 2025, but not in Q2 2025. Despite having $7 billion in cash as of Q3 2025, Rivian's future depends on its ability to transition from serving business customers and high-end consumers to capturing the mass market with the R2. The article cautions that while Rivian has made impressive progress, its capital-intensive nature and intense competition make mass-market success uncertain.

The company produces the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans (EDVs) for Amazon and others, with plans to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026. In 2022, Rivian produced only 24,337 vehicles (vs. a 50,000 target), delivering 20,332. Production rose to 57,232 in 2023 with 50,122 deliveries, but dipped to 49,476 in 2024, with deliveries reaching 51,579 despite inflation, high interest rates, reduced EV subsidies, and competition. For 2025, Rivian expects deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles. Over the next five years, analysts project Rivian\u2019s revenue will grow at a 31% CAGR from 2024 to 2027, with net losses narrowing. The company aims to boost gross margins through clean energy credit sales, subscription services, upgrades, and licensing. A joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) is advancing new EV architecture and software. Rivian plans to open its Georgia plant and triple production capacity by 2028. If Rivian achieves a 20% revenue CAGR through 2031 and trades at 5x sales by 2031\u2014up from under 3x sales in 2024\u2014its stock could rise more than sixfold. However, this growth depends on successful scaling, market expansion, and overcoming macro and microeconomic headwinds. The Motley Fool notes Rivian\u2019s stock is currently undervalued, trading at less than three times 2024 sales.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:35 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/30/where-will-rivian-stock-be-in-5-years/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=6667fdc5-1538-43b3-9d48-2e406b810d1a)\n\n**CNET Cars: Navigate Your World in This New Age of Transportation**\nCNET Cars presents a comprehensive overview of the evolving transportation landscape, highlighting key developments in electric vehicles, autonomous technology, and personal mobility.

According to Nick Twork, Lucid's Head of Communications, the prototypes retain the core design DNA of the Air sedan and Gravity SUV, including space efficiency, driving dynamics, and long range. The new platform prioritizes 'dramatically improved manufacturability and cost structure,' aiming to reduce production costs while preserving key performance advantages. The platform will underpin three non-sedan body styles, enabling greater scalability than the current Air and Gravity models. Production is scheduled for late 2026, positioning the vehicle behind Rivian's R2, which is set to launch 'by June' in 2026. Despite the prototype build being complete, Lucid has not yet unveiled the vehicle publicly, indicating significant development work remains. Pricing is expected to start around $50,000. Lucid's ability to scale production profitably remains critical to its long-term viability, as previous models have achieved engineering excellence but at high costs and with significant cash burn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:55 PM\nSource:[Carscoops](https://www.carscoops.com/?p=3362356)\n\n**Rivian R2 on the Final Straight: The Game-Changing Electric Crossover Now on the Production Line**\nRivian's R2, a midsize electric crossover, is nearing production readiness and is expected to reach customers as early as June 2026, according to Carscoops. The vehicle is being produced at a newly expanded 2.6 million square foot manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, which was completed in just 11 months. The first validation vehicles\u2014actual production prototypes, not early models\u2014have already rolled off the assembly line, confirming the readiness of key manufacturing processes. The plant has a peak capacity of 215,000 vehicles annually, with 155,000 units allocated to the R2 model. Initially, Rivian planned to produce the R2 in Georgia, but due to delays in that project, the company shifted production to Illinois for speed. The R2 is built on a completely new midsize platform, and while final specifications remain unannounced, Rivian aims to maintain a starting price of approximately $45,000. This pricing is critical for direct competition with the Tesla Model Y; if achieved, the R2 could transition from a brand image vehicle to a serious market contender. The success of the R2 launch could determine whether Rivian becomes a major player in the U.S. mass-market electric vehicle sector or remains a niche producer of premium vehicles.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2026/01/rivian-r2-na-finishnij-pryamij-dolenosnij-elektrokrosover-vzhe-na-konveyeri)\n\n**Rivian Electric Vehicles: Reviews, Pricing, and Specs**\nRivian, a California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, offers a range of vehicles including the R1T pickup truck, the R1S full-size SUV, the mid-size R2 SUV, and upcoming entry-level models R3 and R3X.

The stock dip reflects investor concerns over weak demand for Rivian\u2019s high-end electric trucks and SUVs, as well as uncertainty ahead of the company\u2019s Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings report on February 12. Despite producing 10,974 vehicles and delivering 9,745 in Q4, Rivian\u2019s total 2025 deliveries reached 42,247 units\u2014below some analyst expectations. The company\u2019s planned expansion into the smaller R2 model, scheduled for release in the first half of 2026, may pressure margins if delayed. Rivian\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen, particularly the software collaboration tied to a new EV platform and a potential $1 billion milestone payment, is under scrutiny, with winter testing ongoing in Sweden. Additionally, Rivian\u2019s ambitious software and services strategy\u2014including self-driving technology and AI-driven features\u2014faces market skepticism, especially after gains from its December Autonomy and AI Day were reversed. The broader EV sector remains turbulent, with the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit in September 2025 and rising competition from Tesla and Lucid compounding challenges.

The vehicles are currently produced at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California factory. Musk stated that the decision marks a transition toward a future centered on autonomous driving, and urged potential buyers to purchase Model S or Model X now. After the discontinuation, the same production space will be repurposed for the production of the humanoid robot project, Optimus, with a target annual capacity of 1 million units at the Fremont plant. Model S, launched in 2012, was widely regarded as the first mass-appeal luxury electric car, while Model X, introduced in 2015, was Tesla\u2019s second major electric vehicle project. Despite upgrades, sales of both models have stagnated in recent years amid increasing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants like Rivian and Lucid. Tesla has been training Optimus prototypes at the Fremont factory for over a year. Musk confirmed in Davos that the robots have already performed simple tasks in the factory and are expected to handle more complex duties by the end of 2025, with public sales projected to begin by the end of 2026. Data collection for Optimus will also start at Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas factory in February 2026.

The company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 delivery count was 9,745, below the Wall Street expectation of 10,050, while production reached 10,974 units at its Normal, Illinois plant. The decline underscores persistent pressure on demand for higher-priced EVs, exacerbated by the expiration of the US $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of September 2025, which led to higher vehicle prices. Rivian, which sells the R1T pickup and R1S SUV at premium price points, is under scrutiny over whether demand can remain resilient as it scales production. The company is implementing efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to reduce material and manufacturing costs in an effort to improve profitability without relying solely on volume growth. Investors are now focusing on the upcoming launch of the lower-cost R2 SUV, expected in the first half of 2026, which is positioned to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y.

Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, facility during the same period. The decline follows the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025, which increased consumer prices and reduced demand. Premium models like the R1T and R1S were hit hardest due to economic volatility. Rivian is responding with efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and simplifying vehicle components to achieve sustainable profitability, as investor patience has waned since the 2020\u20132021 EV boom. The company is preparing to launch the R2 SUV in early 2026, targeting a lower price point to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y and expand its customer base. Rivian\u2019s CEO, RJ Scaringe, announced that point-to-point automated driving will debut in 2026, following the launch of Universal Hands-Free in December 2025 under the Rivian Autonomy+ subscription ($49.99/month or $2,500 one-time). The company will release full-year 2025 financial results on February 12, 2026.

The company projects adjusted EBITDA losses of $2 billion to $2.25 billion for 2025 and analysts do not expect profitability until at least 2032. The U.S. battery-electric vehicle (BEV) market is projected to decline by 2.1% in 2025\u2014the first year-over-year drop since 2019\u2014due to high upfront costs, range anxiety, and inadequate charging infrastructure. Demand for hybrids and plug-in hybrids has risen, with Ford scaling back BEV plans and Tesla acknowledging a challenging EV sales environment. Rivian\u2019s stock surged over 52% in one month, driven by analyst upgrades tied to the R2 launch and a new in-house AI chip for autonomous driving. However, its strong Q3 2025 performance\u201413,201 deliveries and 78% YoY revenue growth\u2014was largely driven by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it expired on September 30, 2025.

Despite recording its best sales quarter in Q3 2025\u2014delivering 13,201 vehicles, a 32% increase from the prior quarter\u2014the company still expects lower annual volume. This revision follows strong demand driven by U.S. buyers rushing to secure federal tax credits before they expired on Tuesday, even through leasing.

Rivian has also begun work on a new factory in Georgia that is expected to create 7,500 jobs by 2030 and will produce the next\u2011generation R2 SUV and R3 crossover, with construction starting in 2026 and production slated for 2028. Amazon is testing GM BrightDrop electric vans alongside its existing Rivian fleet as part of a strategy to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles by 2030. These developments underscore Rivian\u2019s expansion efforts and the challenges it faces in the electric\u2011vehicle market.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 11:41 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Italia](https://it.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-mantiene-rating-neutrale-su-rivian-prevede-un-forte-q3-93CH-3017562)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on the latest information available as of January 30, 2026, here's a comprehensive overview of Rivian's delivery projections for 2025 through Q1 2026 and details on the R2 launch ramp:\n\n### 2025 Delivery Performance\n- **Actual 2025 Deliveries:** Rivian delivered **42,247 vehicles** in 2025, falling short of analyst expectations (which anticipated ~42,500 units) and marking an **18% decline** from 2024's 51,579 deliveries [7][13][15]. This underperformance is attributed to:\n  - Expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in September 2025, raising consumer prices [7][13][15].\n  - Weaker demand for premium EVs amid economic volatility [13][15].\n  - Production headwinds at its Normal, Illinois facility [7][16].\n\n- **Guidance Revisions:** Rivian revised its 2025 delivery guidance downward twice:\n  1. Initial 2025 target: **Up to 51,000 vehicles** [19][20].  \n  2. May 2025 revision: **40,000\u201346,000 vehicles** [16][19][20].  \n  3. October 2025 revision: **41,500\u201343,500 vehicles** [15][18][19][20].  \n  The final figure (42,247) landed within the Q4-adjusted range but below initial optimism.\n\n### Q4 2025 and Early 2026 Dynamics\n- **Q4 2025 Deliveries:** **9,745 vehicles** delivered (below Wall Street's 10,050 estimate) [7][13][15].  \n- **Q1 2026 Expectations:** No formal guidance yet, but key factors include:  \n  - Ongoing demand pressure for R1T/R1S models [7][15].  \n  - Preparations for the R2 launch, shifting resources to validation and testing [6][11].  \n  - Full-year 2025 financial results will be released on **February 12, 2026**, likely including Q1 2026 indicators [7][13][15].\n\n### R2 Launch Ramp (Critical 2026 Catalyst)\n- **Production Timeline:**  \n  - **Validation Phase:** First R2 validation vehicles (R2VVs) rolled off the Normal, IL production line in **January 2026** [6][11]. Real-world testing is now underway.  \n  - **Mass Production Start:** **June 2026** (accelerated from original plans) [6][11].  \n  - **Initial Capacity:** **155,000 units/year** allocated to R2 within Normal's expanded 215,000-unit capacity [6][11].  \n\n- **Strategic Pivot:**  \n  - Production shifted from Georgia to Normal, IL, to expedite launch by 11 months [6][11][12].  \n  - Georgia plant ($5B DOE loan) will handle scaling later, targeting 100k units/year eventually [4][11].  \n\n- **Market Positioning:**  \n  - **Price:** ~$45,000 starting point to compete with Tesla Model Y [6][11][17][18].  \n  - **Significance:** CEO RJ Scaringe calls R2 \"make-or-break\" for Rivian\u2019s transition from niche premium to mass-market viability [10][12][18].  \n\n### Analyst Sentiment & Projections\n- **Bearish Near-Term:** Concerns persist about cash burn ($7B on hand as of Q3 2025) and slower R1 demand [7][10]. Stock fell ~30% in January 2026 amid pre-earnings jitters [7][12].  \n- **Bullish Long-Term:**  \n  - Successful R2 execution could drive **31% revenue CAGR (2024\u20132027)** [1].  \n  - Partnerships (e.g., Volkswagen\u2019s $1B investment in software JV) add stability [1][7][17].  \n- **2026 Volume Hope:** R2 targets 100k annual units by 2027, but 2026 delivery projections hinge on H1 2026 ramp efficiency [11][12].\n\n### Key Uncertainties\n1. **R2 Demand Elasticity:** Will the $45k price point revive growth amid high interest rates? [6][18].  \n2. **Margin Pressure:** R2\u2019s lower price could strain profitability if production delays occur [7][10].  \n3. **Macro Risks:** EV tax credit uncertainty, tariff policies, and competitive pressure from Tesla [16][19][20].\n\n### Conclusion\nRivian's 2025 deliveries landed at the low end of revised guidance due to subsidy expiration and demand headwinds. The company is now all-in on the R2 launch, with production validation underway and volume deliveries expected by mid-2026. Analysts view the R2 as pivotal for Rivian\u2019s survival, though Q1 2026 deliveries will likely remain subdued as resources pivot to R2 readiness. Clarity on 2026 guidance is anticipated during the February 12 earnings call.  \n\n**Citations:** [1][6][7][10][11][12][13][15][16][17][18][19][20]\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
