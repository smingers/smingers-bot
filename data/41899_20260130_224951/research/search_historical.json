FULL QUARTERLY DELIVERY RECORD (Q3-2021 \u2013 Q4-2025)  \nAll figures are the customer-delivery numbers Rivian itself reported (or that press reports repeated directly from Rivian 8-K filings and news releases).\n\nQuarter | Vehicles delivered | Public source  \nQ3-21 | 11 | InsideEVs, 3-Jan-2022 \u2013 Rivian Q4-21 production update (prior round)  \nQ4-21 | 909 | The Verge, 10-Mar-2022 quoting Rivian S-1 update (prior round)  \nQ1-22 | 1,227 | Teslarati, 5-Apr-2022 citing Rivian Form 8-K (prior round)  \nQ2-22 | 4,467 | Rivian IR post, 6-Jul-2022 (prior round)  \nQ3-22 | 6,584 | InsideEVs, 3-Oct-2022 (prior round)  \nQ4-22 | 8,054 | Motley Fool, 4-Jan-2023, reiterating Rivian press release (prior round)  \nQ1-23 | 7,946 | Yahoo Finance, 3-Apr-2023 (prior round)  \nQ2-23 | 12,640 | Electrek, 3-Jul-2023 (prior round)  \nQ3-23 | 15,564 | InsideEVs, 3-Oct-2023 (prior round)  \nQ4-23 | 13,972 | Teslarati, 2-Apr-2024 (prior round)  \nQ1-24 | 13,588 | InsideEVs / Teslarati, 2-Apr-2024 (prior round)  \nQ2-24 | 13,790 | Electrek production recap, 24-Feb-2025 (prior round)  \nQ3-24 | 10,018 | same Electrek article, 24-Feb-2025 (prior round)  \nQ4-24 | 14,183 | CNBC citing 3-Jan-2025 Rivian release (prior round)  \nQ1-25 | 8,640 | Rivian IR note, 2-Apr-2025 (prior round)  \nQ2-25 | 10,661 | Rivian IR note, 2-Jul-2025 (prior round)  \nQ3-25 | 13,201 | Rivian IR note, 2-Oct-2025 (prior round)  \nQ4-25 | 9,745 | Rivian 8-K filed 2-Jan-2026, summarised by TechStock\u00b2, 3-Jan-2026 (TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026)\n\nWith the Q4-25 figure now confirmed in an SEC filing (TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026) the data set is complete and auditable from Rivian\u2019s first customer hand-over through year-end 2025.\n\nB. WHAT MANAGEMENT HAS GUIDED FOR 2026\n\n1. Timing of formal guidance.  On 3-Jan-2026 Rivian said full-year 2026 production-and-delivery guidance will be published on the FY-2025 earnings call scheduled for 12-Feb-2026 (TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026).\n\n2. Capacity expansion.  Rivian reiterates Normal-plant rated capacity of 155 k units a year following the R2-related expansion (WGLT 26-Jan-2026).\n\n3. R2 programme milestones.  \n   \u2022 Manufacturing-validation R2 units are now coming off the Normal line (Yahoo Finance 20-Jan-2026; WGLT 26-Jan-2026).  \n   \u2022 First customer deliveries are \u201cexpected by June 2026\u201d (WGLT 26-Jan-2026).  \n   \u2022 The crossover will be priced \u201cabout $45 k\u201d and target far higher volumes than the premium R1 models (WGLT 26-Jan-2026; EV Sportline undated summary).\n\n4. 2025 performance as a baseline.  FY-2025 deliveries finished at 42,247, mid-point of the 41,500-43,500 range management reaffirmed on 2-Oct-2025 (TechCrunch recap 2-Oct-2025; TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026).\n\nC. STATUS OF A FEBRUARY-2026 LINE-CONVERSION SHUTDOWN\n\n\u2022 No definitive scheduling.  A broad scan of local outlets (Pantagraph / WGLT), union bulletins (UAW Local 2488), Rivian IR press releases and SEC 8-Ks through 29-Jan-2026 shows no notice of a February-2026 plant halt.  \n\u2022 The only recently reported outage is a one-month shutdown \u201cin the second half of 2025\u201d to integrate tooling\u2014reported by 25 News Now on 5-Jan-2025, not 2026 (25 News Now 5-Jan-2025).  \nConclusion: the rumoured February-2026 conversion remains unsubstantiated. Until Rivian or local media publish firm dates, planning should assume normal operations in Q1-2026.\n\nD. OPERATING BASELINE HEADING INTO 2026\n\n1. Throughput trend.  \n   \u2022 2024: 51,579 deliveries \u2192 12,895 per half-year, \u224811,100 per 13-week quarter.  \n   \u2022 2025: 42,247 deliveries \u2192 10,823 per quarter, depressed by the September-25 tooling outage and by the Q4 pull-forward effect of the expiring US tax credit (TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026).\n\n2. Plant efficiency.  Normal can now physically build up to 3,000 vehicles per week post-expansion (WGLT 26-Jan-2026), but Rivian continues to modulate output to match demand and conserve cash.  Hence a short outage (\u22643 weeks) could be offset through overtime or inventory release.\n\n3. Mix shift risk.  R1 demand softened after the federal $7,500 tax credit ended 30-Sep-2025 (TechStock\u00b2 3-Jan-2026).  Early-stage R2 volumes will therefore be incremental only once customer deliveries start (likely Q2-2026).\n\nE. Q1-2026 DELIVERY FORECAST\n\nKey variables  \n\u2022 Plant availability \u2014 each lost production week equated to roughly 1,050 deliveries in 2025.  \n\u2022 R2 timing \u2014 validation builds in January mean customer units are unlikely to ship before April.  \n\u2022 Macro demand \u2014 no new US incentives are in place for Q1-2026 and overall BEV demand is forecast to contract slightly year-on-year (24/7 Wall St. 22-Dec-2025).\n\nScenario analysis (Jan-Mar 2026):\n\n1. Base case: normal three-shift operations, no R2 customer units  \n   Expected deliveries: 10,500 \u2013 11,500 (in line with the underlying 2025 run-rate).\n\n2. Downtime case: unplanned two-week February stoppage  \n   Expected deliveries: 8,500 \u2013 9,500 (subtract \u22482,000 units).\n\n3. Upside case: no downtime plus a token 500-vehicle R2 \u201cfounders\u201d batch in late March  \n   Expected deliveries: 11,000 \u2013 12,000.\n\nBecause no evidence backs a February shutdown, Scenario 1 remains the planning assumption.  The model can be updated immediately if Rivian issues downtime dates on or before the 12-Feb-2026 earnings call.\n\nF. REMAINING INFORMATION GAPS\n\n1. Definitive announcement (or denial) of any Q1-2026 plant stoppage: dates and duration.  \n2. Numeric FY-2026 delivery / production guidance to be issued 12-Feb-2026.  \n3. Management\u2019s planned R1 : R2 mix for 1H-2026 and whether R2 will launch as a trickle or in a pronounced step-function.  \n4. Confirmation that the September-2025 \u201cone-month\u201d shutdown referenced by 25 News Now is the same three-week event already captured in Q3-2025, or an additional downtime period.  Clarification would refine the weekly-throughput assumption.\n\nUntil those datapoints surface, the historical delivery ledger is complete, and the Q1-2026 delivery forecast above is the most evidence-based view that can be generated.</Agent_report>\n"
