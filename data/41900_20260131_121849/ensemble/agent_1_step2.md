- **Key fact:** Over 99.9% of users have transitioned to GPT-5.2
- **Key fact:** No mention of GPT-6 in any official OpenAI communications
- **Factual content:** GPT-5.2 is current flagship as of December 2025
- Quality: High - multiple independent confirmations of same events

**Critical finding from AskNews:** The January 30-31, 2026 articles about model deprecation make NO mention of GPT-6, despite being perfect opportunities to tease or announce it. This is strong negative evidence.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against Pre-May 1 Release:**

1. **Official October 2025 denial** (Multiple sources: Data Studios, Overchat.ai, Bleeping Computer)
   - OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 will NOT ship in 2025
   - Weight: Very strong - direct company statement
   - Implication: Company knew in October that even Q1 2026 was unrealistic, otherwise they would have said "not in 2025, coming early 2026"

2. **Complete absence of GPT-6 in January 2026 communications** (AskNews articles)
   - January 30-31, 2026: Major model deprecation announcement with zero GPT-6 mention
   - OpenAI announcing end-of-life for older models while focusing on GPT-5.2
   - Weight: Very strong - 90 days before deadline with no announcement signals
   - Implication: No imminent release planned

3. **Training infrastructure timeline** (Multiple sources)
   - GB200 racks arrived mid-2025
   - Training likely began July-October 2025
   - Weight: Strong - physical constraints on development timeline
   - Implication: Only 6-10 months from training start to May 2026 deadline, unprecedented for OpenAI flagship

**Moderate Evidence Against:**

4. **Historical development cycles** (Outside view analysis)
   - GPT-4 to GPT-5: 29 months
   - Even "faster" timeline suggests 12-24 months
   - 8 months (August 2025 to May 2026) would be 72% faster
   - Weight: Moderate - historical patterns have predictive power but can be broken

5. **GPT-5 rollout issues** (Yahoo Finance, August 2025)
   - Rocky launch requiring tone adjustments
   - Weight: Moderate - suggests organizational caution
   - Implication: Company likely to be more conservative with GPT-6 timeline

**Weak Evidence For (but ultimately insufficient):**

6. **Altman's "faster" statement** (CNBC, August 2025)
   - Commitment to shorter gap than GPT-4→GPT-5
   - Weight: Weak-moderate - CEO statements have poor predictive accuracy (GPT-5 "weeks/months" slipped 6+ months)
   - Even if true, "faster" could mean 20 months (April 2027), not 8 months

7. **Competitive pressure** (Various sources mention Gemini 3)
   - Could theoretically accelerate timeline
   - Weight: Weak - insufficient to overcome physical development constraints

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 90 days (January 31 to May 1, 2026)

**Critical Timing Constraints:**
- For May 1 release: Announcement needed within next 0-90 days
- Modern OpenAI pattern: Same-day or near-same-day GA after announcement
- Zero announcement signals as of January 31, 2026
- Major model deprecation announcement (Jan 30-31) made no GPT-6 reference

**If Timeframe Halved (45 days to March 17, 2026):**
- Probability would drop to ~1% (even less time for surprise announcement)
- Would require announcement within days, which has zero current evidence

**If Timeframe Doubled (180 days to August 1, 2026):**
- Probability would increase to ~15-20%
- August 2026 represents 12-month gap from GPT-5 (plausible "faster" timeline)
- Would align with infrastructure timeline (12-14 months from training start)
- Still faces uncertainty around safety testing, competitive dynamics

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Outside View:** 2%

**Adjustments Based on Current Evidence:**

The outside view already incorporated most relevant factors, but new January 2026 information provides critical updates:

**Downward pressure (reducing from 2% to lower):**
1. **January 30-31, 2026 model deprecation announcement:** OpenAI made major product announcements with zero GPT-6 mention. This is the most recent official communication and strongly suggests no imminent release.

2. **Time constraint tightening:** We're now 90 days from deadline (vs. 120+ days when outside view was calculated). Each passing day without announcement exponentially reduces probability.

3. **GPT-5.2 positioning:** December 2025 launch of GPT-5.2 as "most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work" suggests company is still investing in GPT-5 family, not pivoting to GPT-6.

**Upward pressure (minimal):**
1. Overchat.ai claim of "sometime in 2026" confirmation - but this is unattributed and contradicted by absence of official announcements.

**Integration:**
The convergence of evidence is overwhelming:
- Official denial for 2025 (October)
- Zero announcement signals (January 31)
- Infrastructure timeline incompatible with May deadline
- Recent major product communications ignoring GPT-6
- Historical CEO prediction unreliability

The only scenario supporting >5% probability would require:
- Stealth development completion (contradicts all available evidence)
- Willingness to rush safety testing (contradicts post-GPT-5 caution)
- Surprise announcement within days (no precedent)

**Final Assessment:**
The outside view 2% was already appropriately calibrated. New January 2026 information, particularly the model deprecation announcement with zero GPT-6 mention, provides additional confirmation. If anything, probability should decrease slightly, but 2% already captures the tail-risk scenarios adequately.

The structural constraints (training timeline, safety testing, organizational caution post-GPT-5) combined with complete absence of release signals make pre-May 1 release extraordinarily unlikely.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 2%, I evaluate whether January 2026 information warrants adjustment:

**Evidence Summary:**
- Strong negative: Official October denial + January 30-31 announcements with zero GPT-6 mention
- Strong negative: 90-day window with no announcement signals
- Strong negative: Training timeline incompatible with May deadline
- Weak positive: Unattributed "2026" claims (insufficient to overcome negatives)

**Calibration Questions:**

"2% means 1 in 50 times this happens." Does this align with my analysis?
- Yes. This captures scenarios like: (1) stealth-completed model with surprise announcement, (2) major breakthrough reducing training needs, (3) competitive emergency forcing rushed release
- These are tail-risk scenarios, appropriately weighted at ~2%

"What would need to be true for 5% to be correct?"
- Would need some signal of imminent announcement (leaks, API updates, executive hints)
- Zero such signals exist as of January 31

"What would need to be true for 0.5% to be correct?"
- Would require essentially zero probability of surprise
- But history shows tech companies can occasionally surprise (though not OpenAI with flagship models)
- 2% appropriately accounts for unknown unknowns

**Testing ±10% shifts:**
- 12% probability: Would imply 1-in-8 chance. This would require believing announcement is plausible within 90 days despite zero signals. Inconsistent with evidence.
- 0.2% probability: Would essentially rule out any possibility. Too extreme given irreducible uncertainty about internal company decisions.

**Final Calibration:**
The outside view 2% remains appropriate. January 2026 information confirms rather than contradicts this assessment. The convergence of negative evidence (official denial, announcement absence, timeline constraints) is offset by irreducible uncertainty about potential surprises.

Maintaining 2% probability.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will OpenAI make a model explicitly named "GPT-6" generally available via API or ChatGPT before May 1, 2026 (90 days from now)?
   ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria (general public availability, not closed beta)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 2% based on reference class of OpenAI flagship release timelines and infrastructure constraints.
   ✓ Final prediction remains rooted in this base rate; current circumstances confirm rather than contradict it

3. **Consistency check:** "2 out of 100 times, OpenAI releases GPT-6 for general public use before May 1, 2026."
   ✓ This makes sense - captures tail-risk scenarios (surprise announcements, breakthroughs) while acknowledging overwhelming evidence against

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - Official October 2025 denial that GPT-6 ships in 2025 (factually valid)
   - January 30-31, 2026 model deprecation announcement with zero GPT-6 mention (factually valid)
   - Training infrastructure timeline: GB200s arrived mid-2025, insufficient time for May release (factually valid)
   - Complete absence of announcement signals 90 days before deadline (factually valid)
   - Historical pattern: GPT-4→GPT-5 took 29 months; even "faster" suggests 12+ months (factually valid)

5. **Blind spot:** OpenAI has completed GPT-6 development in stealth and announces surprise launch in February/March 2026 for competitive reasons. This would require: (a) training completed much faster than infrastructure timeline suggests, (b) safety testing compressed, (c) willingness to surprise-launch despite GPT-5 rollout lessons. Even if this occurred, would only raise probability to ~15-20%, not enough to change forecast category.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is "no GPT-6 release." This is a stable state with strong structural support (development timelines, safety requirements, organizational caution). Volatility is low - each passing day without announcement reinforces status quo. 2% already appropriately favors status quo while accounting for tail risks.

Probability: 2%
