Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**LifeArchitect.ai (Dr. Alan D. Thompson, March 26, 2024, updated through August 2025):**
- A comprehensive timeline document tracking OpenAI model releases
- Contains a specification table listing "GPT-6" with estimated 2026 release date
- Includes multiple dated statements from Sam Altman
- Quality: Mixed. The specification table appears speculative (uses "est" extensively). However, the timeline of actual releases and dated quotes appear factual and corroborated by other sources
- Key factual elements: GPT-5 released August 7, 2025; Altman stated (Aug 19, 2025) GPT-6 will arrive faster than GPT-4→GPT-5 gap
- The "2026" release estimate in the table is not attributed to any OpenAI source—appears to be the author's projection

**CNBC (MacKenzie Sigalos, August 19, 2025):**
- Direct interview/statements from Sam Altman
- Quality: High credibility, mainstream financial news outlet
- Key facts: Altman confirmed GPT-6 "already on the way," will arrive "faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5"
- Notably absent: Any specific date or commitment to 2026, let alone before May 1, 2026
- Altman's quote about models having "saturated the chat use case" suggests potential strategic shifts

**ZDNET (August 2025):**
- Secondary reporting on Altman's statements
- Quality: Reasonable tech journalism source
- Adds context: GPT-4 to GPT-5 gap was "over two years"
- Notes important caveat: "product launch timelines constantly get pushed back" with example of GPT-5 delay
- No specific GPT-6 date provided

**Times of India (October 31, 2025):**
- Reports Altman's social media post about renaming "GPT-6" to "GPT-6-7"
- Quality: Low relevance to the question. Appears to be a humorous social media post tied to slang terminology
- Does not provide substantive information about actual release plans

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive synthesis of available sources
- Key finding: "18 Oct 2025 – OpenAI spokesperson statement... 'officially confirmed that GPT-6 will not ship in 2025'"
- This is the most critical piece of information, though I note the original source link (datastudios.org) was not provided in the historical context for direct verification
- Timeline shows consistent pattern: most major releases had same-day announcement and GA

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **GPT-4 to GPT-5 interval (March 2023 → August 2025 = ~29 months)**
   - Suitability: High. Altman explicitly referenced this gap when discussing GPT-6 timing
   - Pattern: Major flagship model upgrade under similar organizational maturity
   - Caveat: This was an unusually long gap, possibly due to safety reviews, o-series development, or technical challenges

2. **All major GPT flagship releases (GPT-3 → GPT-3.5 → GPT-4 → GPT-5)**
   - GPT-3 to GPT-3.5: ~19 months (May 2020 → Jan 2022)
   - GPT-3.5 to GPT-4: ~14 months (Jan 2022 → March 2023)
   - GPT-4 to GPT-5: ~29 months (March 2023 → August 2025)
   - Average: ~21 months
   - Suitability: Moderate. Shows variability but general pattern of 1-2+ year cycles

3. **OpenAI's stated timeline reliability**
   - Example: GPT-5 initially suggested for "weeks/months" in February 2025, actually released August 2025
   - Suitability: High for understanding execution risk
   - Pattern: Significant delays common; aggressive timelines often slip

**Selected reference class:** GPT-4 to GPT-5 interval, adjusted by Altman's "faster" commitment and organizational statements.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** January 31, 2026 → May 1, 2026 = **90 days (3 months)**

**Key temporal facts:**
- GPT-5 released: August 7, 2025 (~5.8 months before question opens)
- Current date (question opening): January 31, 2026
- Resolution date: May 1, 2026
- Time from GPT-5 to resolution: ~9 months
- Time from GPT-5 to end of 2025: ~5 months

**Critical constraint:** OpenAI officially stated (October 18, 2025) that "GPT-6 will not ship in 2025." This means:
- At minimum, GPT-6 would release in 2026
- The question asks for release before May 1, 2026
- This leaves only a 4-month window (January 1 - May 1, 2026)

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- No major GPT flagship has been released within 9 months of its predecessor
- Shortest gap between major releases: GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 at 14 months
- Even with Altman's "faster" commitment, if we assume 50% reduction from the 29-month GPT-4→GPT-5 gap, that's ~14-15 months
- 14 months from GPT-5 (Aug 2025) = October 2026, well past the May 1 deadline

## (d) Justification

**Factors strongly suggesting "No":**

1. **Official denial of 2025 release:** OpenAI explicitly stated GPT-6 won't ship in 2025, leaving only 4 months in the prediction window

2. **Historical precedent:** No major GPT flagship has ever been released within 9 months of its predecessor. The fastest was 14 months.

3. **"Faster" is relative:** Altman's August 2025 statement that GPT-6 will come "faster than GPT-4→GPT-5" is comparing against a 29-month gap. Even a 50% reduction (14.5 months) would place GPT-6 in October 2026.

4. **Recent point releases:** GPT-5.1 (Nov 2025) and GPT-5.2 (Dec 2025) suggest OpenAI is still iterating on GPT-5, not ready for GPT-6

5. **Strategic uncertainty:** Altman's comment about models having "saturated the chat use case" and potentially getting "worse" suggests possible strategic pivots that could delay or restructure releases

6. **Consistent delay pattern:** ZDNET noted timelines "constantly get pushed back" with GPT-5 as a recent example

**Factors suggesting possible "Yes":**

1. **Accelerating pace:** Altman explicitly committed to faster release than previous cycle

2. **Infrastructure ready:** Stargate capacity and GB200 chips reportedly operational since mid-2025

3. **Naming announcement:** The October 2025 "GPT-6-7" naming joke suggests the model is at least on their radar for near-term planning

**Weight of evidence:** The combination of (a) official denial of 2025 release, (b) historical 14+ month minimum gaps, (c) only 4-month window remaining, and (d) recent GPT-5.x iterations strongly suggests GPT-6 will not be released before May 1, 2026.

The most likely scenario is a late 2026 release (Q3-Q4 2026), which would represent the "faster" timeline Altman referenced while still respecting the technical and organizational constraints evident in OpenAI's history.

## Outside view calibration:

The base rate from historical patterns suggests approximately 0% probability (no precedent for 9-month flagship release cycle). However, we must account for:

1. **Stated acceleration:** Altman's explicit commitment to faster release creates some non-zero probability
2. **Organizational capability:** OpenAI has scaled significantly and may have improved development velocity
3. **Definition ambiguity:** The question asks for "general public availability," which OpenAI typically achieves same-day with announcements—no extended rollout period to worry about
4. **Black swan possibility:** Unexpected breakthroughs or competitive pressure could force early release

However, the October 2025 official statement ruling out 2025 release is a strong anchor. For GPT-6 to release before May 1, 2026, OpenAI would need to:
- Complete development in the ~8 months from GPT-5 (by end of Q1 2026)
- Compress their historical 14+ month cycle by nearly 50%
- Reverse or dramatically accelerate beyond their October 2025 guidance

The probability should be low but not infinitesimal. Comparable situations (major tech product released within 4 months of official "not this year" statement) are rare but not impossible, particularly if the October statement was conservative positioning.

**Calibration anchors:**
- Base rate from historical pattern: <1%
- Adjustment for stated acceleration: +2-3%
- Adjustment for official denial of 2025: -1-2%
- Residual uncertainty and black swan events: +1-2%

Outside View Prediction:
**3%**
