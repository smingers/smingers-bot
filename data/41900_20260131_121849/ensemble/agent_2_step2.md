Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**

1. **CNBC (Aug 19, 2025)**: Sam Altman on-record statement that GPT-6 "will arrive faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5." High-quality primary source. No specific date given. **Fact**: GPT-6 in development; **Opinion**: timing will be faster.

2. **Data Studios/Exafin (Oct 26, 2025)**: Reports OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 will NOT be released in 2025. Attributes this to "company representatives" speaking to technology outlets on Oct 18, 2025. **Fact**: Official denial of 2025 release.

3. **Bleeping Computer (Oct 18, 2025)**: OpenAI employee (@tszzl/Roon) explicitly denied GPT-6 would ship in 2025 on X. Contradicted analyst Mark Mahaney's claim. **Fact**: Internal source denial.

4. **AskNews Articles (Jan 30-31, 2026)**: Multiple sources report OpenAI retiring GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and older models on Feb 13, 2026. No mention of GPT-6 in any official OpenAI announcements, documentation, or Newsroom posts through Jan 31, 2026. **Fact**: GPT-6 not announced as of Jan 31, 2026.

**Secondary/Speculative Sources (Lower Quality):**

5. **Overchat.ai (undated)**: Claims OpenAI confirmed GPT-6 "sometime in 2026" with "most likely timeframe" being first half of 2026. No direct source citation. Mix of speculation and attributed claims. **Weak evidence**.

6. **Yahoo Finance (Aug 20, 2025)**: Reports Altman acknowledged GPT-5 issues and is "betting on GPT-6." Article title editorial interpretation. **Opinion/weak evidence**.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- GPT-4: March 2023
- GPT-5: August 2025 (29 months after GPT-4)
- Today: January 31, 2026 (5.5 months after GPT-5)
- Resolution date: May 1, 2026 (9 months after GPT-5, 3 months from now)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence AGAINST resolution:**

1. **Official denial (Oct 2025)**: OpenAI officially confirmed no 2025 release, with internal employee confirmation. This is 3 months before the question opened. Given typical development timelines, a model not ready by Oct 2025 is extremely unlikely to ship by May 2026. *Weight: Very strong negative*.

2. **Complete absence from Jan 2026 documentation**: Comprehensive search of OpenAI Newsroom and documentation shows zero mention of GPT-6 as of Jan 31, 2026. For a May 1 release (90 days away), we would expect pre-announcements, API documentation updates, or developer previews. *Weight: Strong negative*.

3. **Historical pattern**: 0/2 previous numbered GPT releases occurred within 9 months of predecessor. Shortest gap was 29 months. *Weight: Strong negative*.

**Moderate Evidence AGAINST:**

4. **GPT-5 ecosystem expansion**: Multiple Jan 2026 articles show OpenAI actively expanding GPT-5 variants (5.1, 5.2, o3-mini), retiring older models, and focusing on refinement. This suggests resource allocation away from GPT-6 launch. *Weight: Moderate negative*.

5. **Recent GPT-5 issues**: Aug-Oct 2025 articles document rocky GPT-5 rollout requiring tone adjustments and user feedback incorporation. Companies typically don't rush next major release during active problem-solving phase. *Weight: Moderate negative*.

**Weak Evidence FOR:**

6. **Altman's "faster" comment**: August 2025 statement suggests acceleration. However, "faster than 29 months" could mean 20-24 months, still well beyond May 2026. *Weight: Weak positive*.

7. **Infrastructure readiness**: Stargate compute capacity available mid-2025. However, training + safety testing for GPT-5 took ~11 months; similar timeline from mid-2025 would yield completion around April-May 2026 at earliest, with no buffer for delays. *Weight: Weak positive*.

**Critical Negative Factor:**

8. **Naming uncertainty**: Oct 2025 tweet about "GPT-6-7" naming and OpenAI's trend toward variant naming (4o, 5.1, 5.2) creates substantial risk that next major model won't be called "GPT-6" explicitly. Resolution requires exact name "GPT-6". *Weight: Moderate negative*.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current timeframe**: 90 days until May 1, 2026

**If timeframe was 180 days (Aug 2026)**: Probability would increase to ~15-20%. This would allow for:
- Typical 3-6 month pre-announcement period
- Emergency acceleration from current development state
- Buffer for unexpected delays

**If timeframe was 45 days (mid-March 2026)**: Probability would decrease to ~1-2%. Model would need to be essentially ready now, with documentation already prepared. Complete absence of evidence makes this nearly impossible.

**Current 90-day window**: Sits in uncomfortable middle ground where:
- Too short for normal development cycle (would need announcement NOW)
- Too long to completely rule out emergency surprise launch
- Long enough that absence of any signals is highly informative

## (d) Justification & Adjustment from Outside View

**Starting point**: Outside view established 22% base rate based on exponential waiting-time distribution adjusted for empirical precedent.

**Major downward adjustments:**

1. **Official October denial + January absence** (-12 pp): The combination of explicit "not in 2025" statement in October and complete absence from January documentation is devastating evidence. For a May release, we'd need announcement by now.

2. **Resource allocation to GPT-5 refinement** (-3 pp): Active expansion of GPT-5 ecosystem and retirement of older models suggests GPT-6 not imminent.

3. **Naming risk** (-3 pp): Substantial probability next model is "GPT-5.5" or variant rather than "GPT-6" exactly.

**Minor upward adjustment:**

4. **Acceleration possibility** (+2 pp): Altman's comments and infrastructure readiness provide slim possibility of faster-than-historical timeline.

**Net adjustment**: -16 pp from 22% base → **6%**

However, this still feels too high given the complete absence of any preparatory signals 90 days out. In modern AI development, general availability releases are preceded by:
- Developer preview announcements (typically 1-3 months prior)
- API documentation updates
- Blog posts/newsroom announcements
- Benchmark result publications

None of these exist. Further adjustment: **-2 pp → 4%**

## Probability Calibration

The 4% probability reflects:
- **3%**: Emergency surprise launch scenario (company decides to rush release without typical announcement cycle due to competitive pressure)
- **1%**: Model already exists internally and company reverses October decision for strategic reasons

This is consistent with "1 in 25 times this happens" - essentially requiring either:
1. OpenAI lying in October 2025 about readiness
2. Unprecedented acceleration in final 6 months
3. Model secretly ready but held back for strategic timing

The probability is not lower because:
- 90 days is enough time for a surprise announcement + immediate launch (though highly unusual)
- Competitive pressure from Google/Anthropic could force hand
- Infrastructure theoretically capable of supporting accelerated timeline

The probability is not higher because:
- Zero preparatory signals as of Jan 31, 2026
- Official denial just 3 months ago
- Historical precedent strongly negative
- Active investment in GPT-5 ecosystem suggests different focus

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will OpenAI release a model explicitly named "GPT-6" for general public self-serve access before May 1, 2026 (90 days)?

2. **Base rate**: 22% from outside view (exponential waiting-time + empirical adjustment). Current circumstances ARE vastly different: official denial + zero evidence vs. typical pre-launch signals.

3. **Consistency**: "4 out of 100 times, OpenAI releases GPT-6 for general public availability within 90 days despite official denial and zero preparatory announcements." This aligns with my justification of requiring emergency/surprise scenario.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Official Oct 2025 statement: No 2025 release (factually valid, primary source)
   - Complete absence from Jan 2026 OpenAI documentation (factually valid, comprehensive search)
   - 0/2 historical precedent for <9 month gaps (factually valid, verifiable)
   - Active GPT-5 ecosystem expansion in Jan 2026 (factually valid, multiple sources)
   - Naming uncertainty from Oct 2025 tweet (factually valid but interpretation uncertain)

5. **Blind spot**: OpenAI has GPT-6 secretly ready and announces surprise launch in February/March for competitive reasons (Google Gemini threat). This could push probability to 15-20%. However, this requires believing October denial was strategic misdirection.

6. **Status quo**: Status quo is "GPT-6 not released." Given low volatility of major model releases (they follow predictable patterns) and complete absence of signals, strong nudge toward status quo is appropriate. Current 4% already reflects this.

Probability: 4%
