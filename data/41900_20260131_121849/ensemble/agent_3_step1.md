Analysis:

## (a) Source analysis

### Big Technology (Kantrowitz interview intro excerpt)
- **What it says (facts):** Only sets context (competition, “Code Red,” infrastructure costs, IPO chatter). **No GPT‑6 timeline claims** in the excerpt provided.
- **What it implies (opinions/speculation):** None usable for timing.
- **Source quality:** Big Technology can be solid for tech business reporting, but **this excerpt is incomplete** and **contains no directly decision‑relevant factual content** for GPT‑6 timing. Net: **uninformative**.

### LifeArchitect.ai “GPT‑6 (2026)” living document
- **What it says (facts vs. non-facts):**
  - Contains a **mixture** of (i) curated timelines, (ii) unattributed/secondhand claims, and (iii) forecasts/estimates (e.g., “training start/end 2026 (est)”, “release date (public): 2026”).
  - Some entries look like they’re referencing real public reporting (e.g., hardware deliveries, partnerships), but the document itself is not a primary source for OpenAI release schedules.
- **Source quality:** Useful as a **compendium of rumors + references**, but as a forecasting input it has **high noise** and mixes verifiable items with conjecture. I treat its “GPT‑6 due: 2026” line as **speculation/consensus-y** rather than a hard tether.

### CNBC (Aug 19, 2025) Altman comments (“GPT‑6 … on the way”; “faster than the gap between GPT‑4 and GPT‑5”)
- **What it says (facts):**
  - Altman: GPT‑6 is coming; **no date**; it will arrive **faster than the GPT‑4→GPT‑5 gap**; focus on memory/personalization.
- **Interpretation limits:**
  - “Faster than ~29 months” is a **wide constraint**: it permits anything from “soon” to “still 1–2 years.”
- **Source quality:** **High** (mainstream outlet, direct quotes). Still, it’s an **executive expectation**, not a commitment.

### ZDNET (“might launch sooner than you think”)
- **What it says (facts):** Mostly reiterates the CNBC/Altman remark; warns that timelines slip; gives historical dates.
- **Source quality:** **Medium**; mostly **derivative** and framed as a teaser headline. Adds little beyond “could be sooner; could slip.”

### Times of India (Oct 31, 2025) “GPT‑6 renamed GPT‑6‑7” (X post)
- **What it says (facts):** Reports an alleged Altman X post about naming.
- **Relevance:** Naming volatility matters because the question requires **explicitly named “GPT‑6”** (or versioned variant). If OpenAI changes branding conventions, that could reduce “Yes” probability even if a next-gen model ships.
- **Source quality:** **Medium-low** for this purpose: TOI can accurately repeat a viral post, but the post itself reads like **joke/banter** and is not a product roadmap.

### Agent report (timeline + leadership statements list)
- **What it contains:** A compiled release timeline and a list of GPT‑6 mentions, but it leans heavily on LifeArchitect.ai for exact dates for several models.
- **Source quality:** As a synthesis it’s helpful, but because it **inherits the weaknesses** of LifeArchitect.ai for many date claims, I treat the fine-grained timeline as **approximate** rather than authoritative. The CNBC quote remains the strongest “anchor” inside it.

**Bottom line on sources for an outside view:** We have **one high-quality directional constraint** (Altman: sooner than 4→5 gap), and otherwise **speculative “2026” expectations** with limited timing precision—especially for “before May 1, 2026.”

## (b) Reference class analysis

To build an *outside view* base rate, we need reference classes that map to: “OpenAI releases a new, explicitly numbered flagship model (GPT‑X) for broad self‑serve public availability” within a short horizon.

Plausible reference classes:

1. **Numbered GPT flagship releases (GPT‑3 → GPT‑4 → GPT‑5)**
   - Pros: Closest match to the event definition (“named GPT‑6”).
   - Cons: Very small sample (n≈2 gaps) and spans eras with different scaling laws, regulation, and deployment norms.
   - Observed cadence (from commonly known history + the provided context): multi‑year gaps; GPT‑4→GPT‑5 was ~2+ years.

2. **Major OpenAI “frontier model” releases broadly available (including GPT‑4o and/or o‑series)**
   - Pros: Larger sample; captures current faster iteration.
   - Cons: Not directly about **explicitly numbered GPT‑X** names; the question is name‑sensitive.

3. **Time from “flagship release” to next “flagship release” in leading labs (OpenAI/Google/Anthropic)**
   - Pros: More data, captures competitive dynamics.
   - Cons: Cross‑org differences; branding differs; still not name‑matching.

**Most suitable:** (1) **Numbered GPT flagship releases**, because the resolution criteria are explicitly tied to the “GPT‑6” name. I’ll use (2) only as a sanity check that things can move faster—but discount it because of naming mismatch.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026‑01‑31  
- **Resolution deadline:** 2026‑05‑01  
- **Time remaining:** ~90 days (about **3 months**).

Outside-view implication: even if “GPT‑6 in 2026” is plausible in the abstract, the question is asking about **a very early‑2026 slice**. For a “Yes,” OpenAI must:
1) have a model explicitly named GPT‑6, and  
2) make it **self‑serve publicly accessible** (API or ChatGPT),  
3) all within ~3 months.

Historically, **numbered flagship jumps** have not been that frequent. Even if the long-run cadence accelerates, the probability mass for a launch in a specific 3‑month window is typically limited unless there are strong signals that the launch is imminent (which we do not have in the provided context).

---

## (d) Justification (outside view)

Starting from the reference class of **numbered GPT releases**, the base rate of seeing a new numbered model within **9 months** of the previous numbered release (GPT‑5 in Aug 2025) appears **low**. Add the additional constraint that it must occur within **the next ~3 months** (Feb–Apr 2026), and the outside-view probability declines further.

Key outside-view pressures toward **No**:
- **Base-rate cadence:** Numbered GPT generations have historically taken **years**, not quarters.
- **Operational constraint:** “General public availability” is a higher bar than “demo” or “limited preview.” Outside view says many frontier systems spend meaningful time in staged rollouts.
- **Name constraint risk:** Even if OpenAI releases something “next-gen,” outside view says naming/branding could shift (e.g., “o‑series,” or some new scheme). The event requires explicit “GPT‑6” naming.

Key pressures toward **Yes** (still outside-view, but acknowledging acceleration trend):
- Competitive dynamics and infrastructure ramping can compress cycles, and we have at least one credible directional statement (“sooner than the GPT‑4→GPT‑5 gap”), which leaves room for a release in 2026.
- OpenAI has sometimes shipped major updates without extremely long public run-ups.

Net: Without strong imminent-launch indicators, the outside view for **“GPT‑6 GA by May 1, 2026”** should be **well below 50%**, and plausibly **in the low teens or single digits**.

---

Outside view calibration:

- **A rough tether from sources:** The only relatively hard tether is Altman’s “faster than the GPT‑4→GPT‑5 gap,” which merely implies **before ~early 2028** if interpreted literally; it does **not** concentrate probability before May 2026.
- Given the **short 90‑day window** and the historically slower cadence of **numbered** releases, I calibrate to a probability where “Yes” is plausible but clearly the underdog.
- I land in the **~10%** neighborhood rather than ~1–2% because the post‑2024 era shows faster iteration and there is at least some public talk of GPT‑6 being “on the way.” But I keep it below ~15% because “explicitly named GPT‑6” + “general public availability” + “within 3 months” is a demanding conjunction.

Outside View Prediction:
**11%**
