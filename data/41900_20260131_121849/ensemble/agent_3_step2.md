Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what is factual vs opinion/speculation)
- CNBC (Aug 19, 2025) interview with Sam Altman — High-quality mainstream outlet; primary-source quotes.
  - Factual: Altman says GPT-6 is coming and “faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5.”
  - Opinion/ambiguity: “faster” is non-quantified; could still mean late 2026+.
- DataStudios / Exafin (Oct 26, 2025) — Medium quality; secondary reporting that claims “OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 will NOT be released in 2025.”
  - Factual if accurate: a spokesperson confirmation; but we don’t have the original primary statement in the prompt, so treat as somewhat weaker than direct OpenAI.
  - Opinion: “at least months away” is vague.
- BleepingComputer (Oct 18, 2025) — Medium-high quality tech press; timely.
  - Factual: OpenAI/employee denial of “GPT-6 shipping in 2025.” This is the strongest “not-2025” item in the set.
- TecMundo / 3DNews (Oct 19–20, 2025) — Medium quality; largely echoes the denial narrative.
  - Factual core likely repeats the same denial; limited incremental value.
- Microsoft Azure blog (Aug 7, 2025) — High-quality for GPT-5 availability facts, but says nothing about GPT-6.
- SD Times DevDay writeup (Oct 6, 2025) — Medium quality; product announcements, no GPT-6.
- Yahoo Finance (Aug 20, 2025) — Medium; mostly about GPT-5 rollout issues; thin GPT-6 detail in excerpt.
- Overchat.ai (undated in summary; appears 2025) — Low quality; mixes unattributed speculation (“sometime in 2026”, “most likely first half”) with some Altman paraphrase. Use minimally.
- AskNews / “Deep Research Analysis” (Jan 2026 targeted search) — Mixed: the meta-conclusion “no GPT-6 listed/announced” is useful, but it’s a synthesis rather than a primary source.
  - The included January 30–31, 2026 coverage (CNET, ITmedia, etc.) is credible as secondary reporting of an OpenAI deprecation post; importantly it indicates OpenAI messaging is about retiring older models and consolidating on GPT-5.2—no GPT-6 mention.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted by strength vs resolution criteria)
Resolution requires: an explicitly named “GPT-6” model becomes self-serve available via API or ChatGPT, before May 1, 2026.

Strong evidence (large directional pull toward “No”):
1) Time-to-deadline + historical cadence (structural): We have ~90 days total until May 1, 2026. Major flagship naming jumps (GPT-4→GPT-5) have been long, and even the shortest historic “major” interval cited (GPT-3.5→GPT-4) is ~14 months. Compressing to ~9 months post–GPT-5 (Aug 2025 → Apr 2026) is extreme. This is a base-rate argument with strong predictive power.
2) January 2026 OpenAI behavior: retiring/forcing migration from GPT-4o/4.1/etc and emphasizing GPT-5.2 rollout and GPT-5.x iteration. This is not direct proof GPT-6 won’t ship, but it is consistent with “we’re still in GPT-5 platform consolidation mode,” which tends to precede—not coincide with—an immediate next-number flagship GA.

Moderate evidence (meaningful but not decisive):
3) Multi-outlet reporting of “no GPT-6 in 2025” (Oct 2025) + current date is Jan 31, 2026: Even if true, it still leaves Q1/Q2 2026 possible. But it implies (at least as of Oct 2025) OpenAI was not imminently ready to ship, and “not in 2025” often correlates with “not in the next couple of months,” absent an emergency.
4) Absence check: targeted searches in Jan 2026 found no GPT-6 in official docs/newsroom. This mostly tells us “not yet,” which we already knew, but it also implies no obvious public pre-announcement/early access program under the GPT-6 name as of late Jan 2026.

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
5) Altman “faster than GPT-4→GPT-5” (CNBC) — supports “earlier than a 29-month gap,” but that could still be mid/late 2026. Weak-to-moderate for this specific May 1, 2026 cutoff.
6) Overchat.ai “first half 2026” — low credibility; small weight.

Key nuance: naming risk cuts against “Yes.”
- Even if OpenAI releases a new frontier model or a “secret olympiad” model in early 2026, it might be branded as o-series, GPT-5.3/5.5, or a new product name—not explicitly “GPT-6.” Since the resolution is name-dependent, that lowers “Yes” relative to “OpenAI releases a new top model.”

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window remaining: Jan 31, 2026 → May 1, 2026 ≈ 90 days (~3 months).
- If halved (≈45 days): probability would drop further because product launches, safety reviews, comms, and staged rollouts have minimum practical lead times; I’d move to ~1% or lower.
- If doubled (≈180 days, to ~late July 2026): probability would rise meaningfully because “first half / mid-2026” becomes plausible and fits Altman’s “faster than 29 months” claim; I’d move into perhaps ~8–15% depending on intervening signals.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: 3% for GPT-6 GA before May 1, 2026.

Inside-view adjustments:
- Downward adjustments:
  1) Current (Jan 2026) OpenAI messaging and operations appear centered on GPT-5.2 consolidation + model retirements, not a pre-briefing/tease of a GPT-6 GA. This doesn’t preclude a surprise, but it makes an April GA less likely. (Moderate downward)
  2) Name-specific criterion: OpenAI could ship something “new” without calling it GPT-6; the more OpenAI emphasizes “model families” (GPT-5.x, o-series) and iterative updates, the greater the chance “GPT-6” naming is delayed beyond May 1 even if capability advances ship. (Moderate downward)
  3) Compressed schedule: only ~3 months left. To make “Yes” happen, GPT-6 would need to be essentially ready now or within weeks, plus a decision to label it GPT-6 and make it self-serve. No strong public indications of that. (Strong downward)

- Upward adjustments (small):
  4) Competitive pressure can force timeline pulls, and Altman has signaled a shorter gap than GPT-4→GPT-5. So a small residual chance of a surprise GA remains. (Small upward)

Net: these factors make the reference class (long intervals, pre-launch signaling) still fairly analogous; nothing in the Jan 2026 information convincingly breaks the base-rate logic. So I move probability down from 3% to a lower-but-not-zero level.

Probability calibration:
- Outside view: 3%
- Key inside-view evidence pushes toward “No” (consolidation on GPT-5.2; no GPT-6 traces; name-specific hurdle; only 90 days left).
- I reduce by ~1 percentage point (and a bit more), but keep a non-trivial tail for “surprise GPT-6 GA for paid tiers” or “branding decision to jump to GPT-6 sooner than expected.”

Final inside-view probability: 2%

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Will OpenAI make a self-serve, generally available model explicitly named ‘GPT-6’ (or variant) accessible via API or ChatGPT before May 1, 2026?”
2) Outside view base rate: 3%.
3) Consistency check: 2 out of 100 times, OpenAI releases a generally available model explicitly named GPT-6 before May 1, 2026.
4) Key evidence:
   - Only ~90 days remain; major-model cadence historically much longer.
   - Jan 2026 news focuses on retiring older models and standardizing on GPT-5.2, not GPT-6 launch.
   - No GPT-6 listed/announced in official docs/newsroom as of Jan 31, 2026.
   - Name-specific resolution: new model could ship under GPT-5.x or o-series instead.
5) Blind spot: A competitive “emergency launch” where OpenAI brands the next release as “GPT-6” and makes it self-serve quickly (paid tiers first).
6) Status quo outcome: Status quo is “no GPT-6 GA yet; continued GPT-5.x iteration,” which aligns with “No.”

Probability: 2%
