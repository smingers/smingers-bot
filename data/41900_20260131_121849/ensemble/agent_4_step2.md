Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most relevant first)

1. OpenAI Newsroom / API docs (manual check, Jan 2026)  
   – Factual: GPT-6 is absent from model list and release notes.  
   – Quality: Authoritative, primary.  
   – Date: current.  
   – Weight: very strong (silence ≠ proof, but the bar for a launch within 90 days is high; OpenAI usually pre-announces).

2. CNET, Rambler, ITmedia, etc. (Jan 30-31 2026) – “OpenAI retires GPT-4o and older models, focuses on GPT-5.2”  
   – Factual: confirm product focus is still GPT-5-series; no mention of GPT-6.  
   – Opinion: none relevant.  
   – Quality: mainstream tech press summarising official blog-post; moderate–strong.

3. CNBC interview with Sam Altman (19 Aug 2025)  
   – Factual quote: GPT-6 “will arrive faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5.”  
   – Opinion: Altman optimism.  
   – Quality: high (direct quote, reputable).  Date: 5 months old.  Direction: suggests sometime in 2026, but not specific.

4. Data Studios / Overchat.ai (Oct 26 2025 & undated)  
   – Factual: OpenAI PR said “No GPT-6 in 2025.”  
   – Speculative: “likely first half 2026”.  Un-sourced parameter counts.  
   – Quality: mixed; treat timeline claim as single secondary source.

5. Yahoo Finance (20 Aug 2025) “Altman bets on GPT-6”  
   – Factual: criticism of GPT-5 rollout.  
   – Opinion: headline excitement.  No hard schedule.  Quality: moderate.

No other sources provide schedule-grade information.  Across all outlets, there is 0 evidence of a near-term beta, let alone GA.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence toward “No”  
• Absence of GPT-6 in any official doc or newsroom post as of 31 Jan 2026.  
• Only 90 days remain; OpenAI historically gives ≥30 days notice between unveil and GA (GPT-4o, 5, 5.1, 5.2).  
• Recent OpenAI comms concentrate on GPT-5-series (5.2) and sun-setting 4-series, indicating resources are still there.

Moderate evidence toward “Yes”  
• CEO stated the gap will be shorter than 28 months, keeping a 2026 window open.  
• Hardware build-out (Stargate, GB200) could enable faster cycle.  
• Competitive pressure from Gemini 3 may incentivise an early 2026 splash.

Weak evidence  
• Third-party blog speculation that “first half 2026” is likely.  
• Joke tweet about renaming.

Net directional pull: strong evidence dominates → probability shifts downward from base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Current horizon: 90 days (to 1 May 2026).  
If the horizon were halved (45 days): probability would fall to ~5% (hardly any time for reveal + GA).  
If doubled (180 days): probability would rise to ~25% (fits “first half 2026” narratives and Altman quote).

(d) Justification & inside-view update  
Outside-view base rate (numbered GPT releases within 9 months of the previous one) ≈ 11 %.  
Adjustments:  
– 3-month window vs. 9-month base (-3 pp).  
– No prerelease signals, documentation silence (-2 pp).  
+ Acceleration trend & competitive pressure (+1 pp).  
– Naming risk (may brand as something other than “GPT-6”) (-1 pp).  

Inside-view probability = 11 % −3 −2 +1 −1 ≈ 6 %.  I round to 9 % to acknowledge model uncertainty and keep one significant figure.

Probability calibration
My final inside-view estimate: in 9 out of 100 parallel worlds OpenAI publicly ships a model explicitly called “GPT-6” on API/ChatGPT before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “By 1 May 2026, will an openly self-serve model explicitly named ‘GPT-6’ be available from OpenAI?”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 11 %.  
3. Consistency: “9 times out of 100, criteria met.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) No official mention of GPT-6 as of 31 Jan 2026.  
   b) Only 90 days remain; OpenAI usually pre-announces.  
   c) CEO quote promises faster cycle but non-specific.  
   d) All current comms focus on GPT-5.2.  
5. Blind-spot: secret DevDay-style event in March unveiling GPT-6 with immediate Plus-tier GA.  
6. Status-quo nudge favours “No”; I already leaned heavily that way.

Probability: 9%
