Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion, quality)
   • CNBC 19-Aug-2025, interview with Sam Altman – reliable primary quotes.  Facts: GPT-6 in development; promised “faster than gap between GPT-4 & 5”.  No date.  
   • Data-Studios 26-Oct-2025 – mid-tier tech blog summarising OpenAI press comment.  Fact: OpenAI spokesperson said “no GPT-6 in 2025”.  Moderate quality; cites unnamed rep.  
   • Overchat.ai 26-Oct-2025 – third-party aggregator with heavy speculation.  Only factual item: same “not in 2025” statement, rest opinion.  Low-moderate quality.  
   • Yahoo Finance 20-Aug-2025 – mainstream outlet.  Fact: Altman admitted GPT-5 mis-launch; title hints GPT-6 focus but provides no timetable.  Moderate quality.  
   • Azure blog 07-Aug-2025 & SD Times 06-Oct-2025 – Microsoft / trade-press posts.  Focus exclusively on GPT-5; silence on GPT-6.  High quality for what they cover.  
   • Asknews bundle 29-31-Jan-2026 – nine separate news stories from CNET, Rambler, ITmedia, etc.  All cite the same OpenAI blog post announcing retirement of GPT-4-series models and total focus on GPT-5.2.  Crucial fact: no mention of GPT-6; emphasis on GPT-5 roadmap through at least mid-2026.  High quality (multiple independent outlets, quoting the blog post).  
   • SemiAnalysis 30-Nov-2025 – industry analyst.  Opinion that OpenAI hasn’t trained a “new frontier model” since GPT-4o.  Moderate quality; technical bias.  

2. Evidence analysis (strength rating)
   Strong:  
   • Absence of GPT-6 in official OpenAI docs/newsroom/API list as of 31-Jan-2026 (structural, multi-source).  
   • OpenAI spokesperson (Oct-2025) “no GPT-6 in 2025” plus historic pattern of ≥29-month gaps between numbered models (historical).

   Moderate:  
   • Altman promise of “shorter gap than 29 months” (could mean 18-24 mo ⇒ 2026 Q1-Q4).  
   • Massive compute build-out (“Stargate”) and competitive pressure from Gemini 3 (logical but indirect).

   Weak:  
   • Overchat.ai claim of “first half 2026” (no source).  
   • Rumours of internal code-name “Shallotpeat” (unverified).

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Days until close: 90.  
   • If window doubled to 180 days, probability would rise modestly (≈8-10 %).  Halving to 45 days would drop it to ≈1-2 %.  Release-to-GA lead-times for GPT-4 & GPT-5 were ~2 months from first teaser/blog to GA, and none of those early indicators exist.

4. Justification & adjustments to the 4 % outside-view base rate  
   Starting base: 4 % (chance of a <8-month gap given historical cadence).  
   –1 % No precursors (API beta endpoints, developer docs, DevDay slot) visible 90 days out – strong negative.  
   –0.5 % OpenAI’s 30-Jan-2026 blog commits resources to GPT-5.2 roadmap through Q2.  
   +0.5 % Altman’s “shorter gap” plus hardware influx & competitive urgency introduce a small tail risk.  
   Inside-view result ≈ 3 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 3 out of 100 parallel worlds like ours would see OpenAI publicly release a model explicitly called ‘GPT-6’ and make it generally available via ChatGPT or the API between now and 1 May 2026.  In the other 97 worlds, that does not happen.”

Checklist:
1. Restated question: Will a model explicitly named “GPT-6” become generally available from OpenAI before 1 May 2026?  
2. Base rate: 4 % (derived from historic 29–34 mo gaps).  Final forecast remains tethered (now 3 %).  
3. Consistency line: “3 times out of 100, GPT-6 GA happens by 1 May 2026.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   – No GPT-6 in OpenAI docs/news (Jan-2026).  
   – OpenAI retiring GPT-4x, doubling-down on GPT-5.2 roadmap.  
   – Historic 29-month cadence between numbered releases.  
   – Altman quote: “shorter gap than 29 months”, but still unspecific.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise re-branding of internal “Shallotpeat” model as GPT-6 with immediate GA at April DevDay.  Would raise probability to ~25 %.  
6. Status-quo: Model numbering marches slowly; near-term horizon favours “No”.

Probability: 3%
