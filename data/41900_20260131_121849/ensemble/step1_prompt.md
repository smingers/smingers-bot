- Company is working with psychologists to develop future user experiences

**OpenAI Business Metrics (from The Information reports):**
- $12 billion in revenue reached (double the $5.5 billion reported in December 2024)
- Company is not yet profitable
- ~700 million active users for ChatGPT products (including enterprise and business customers)
- 30% revenue increase in first three months of 2025

## Important Caveats:

The article notes that product launch timelines "constantly get pushed back" and cites an example where Altman initially said GPT-5 would launch in "weeks/months" in February, but it was pushed back and ultimately launched in August 2025.

**Note:** This article does not provide a specific release date or firm timeline for GPT-6, only that it will arrive "sooner than" the two-year gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5.

# Article Summary

**Source:** The Times of India (TOI Tech Desk)  
**Date:** October 31, 2025

## Key Information:

### Main Announcement:
- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced via X (formerly Twitter) that "GPT-6 will be renamed GPT-6-7"
- The post stated: "GPT-6 will be renamed GPT-6-7, you're welcome"

### Context Provided:
- The announcement follows Dictionary.com naming "6-7" as the 2025 Word of the Year
- Altman's post does not explicitly mention a correlation between the naming decision and Dictionary.com's announcement, though the timing is noted

### Definition of "6-7":
According to Dictionary.com (as cited in the article):
- "6-7" (also spelled "67" or "six-seven") is viral, ambiguous Gen Alpha slang
- Largely nonsensical; some interpret it as meaning "so-so" or "maybe this, maybe that"
- Often paired with a hand gesture (palms up, moving alternately)
- Used as a response to questions or when seeing the numbers "67" consecutively
- Considered an example of "brainrot slang" intended to be nonsensical and playfully absurd
- Origin: thought to come from drill song "Doot Doot (6 7)" by Skrilla and viral content about NBA players like LaMelo Ball (who is 6'7")

### Public Reaction:
The article notes mixed reactions from Twitter users, including sarcastic and humorous comments about naming conventions and confusion.

**Note:** This article does not provide concrete information about actual GPT-6 release timelines, technical specifications, or public availability plans. It focuses solely on a naming announcement made via social media.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a timeline of OpenAI model releases from GPT-3 onward with announcement and general availability dates; then list and cite every public statement since 2024 in which OpenAI leadership discussed GPT-6 development or release expectations. Include source URLs.
Below is a consolidated answer to the two-part brief, built only on material surfaced in the supplied search results.

PART A – Timeline of OpenAI model releases (GPT-3 → present)  
For every model family the first date is the public announcement; the second is the first day it was usable by ordinary customers (general availability, “GA”).  Citations are placed after the GA date.

1. GPT-3 – 28 May 2020 → 18 Nov 2021 (API opened to everyone after a 16-month beta, per LifeArchitect.ai chronology which repeats VentureBeat’s report). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
2. GPT-3.5 (InstructGPT / text-davinci-002) – 27 Jan 2022 → 27 Jan 2022 (same-day API launch). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
3. ChatGPT (dialogue-tuned GPT-3.5) – 30 Nov 2022 → 30 Nov 2022 research preview for all users. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
4. GPT-4 – 14 Mar 2023 → 14 Mar 2023 for ChatGPT Plus; API wait-list opened the same day. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
5. GPT-4 Turbo – 6 Nov 2023 → 6 Nov 2023 for ChatGPT Plus and the API. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
6. GPT-4o (“omni”) – 13 May 2024 → 13 May 2024 for text & image in all ChatGPT tiers and the API (voice/video entered limited alpha). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
7. GPT-4o-mini – 18 Jul 2024 → 18 Jul 2024 (roll-out began same day). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
8. GPT-o1 (reasoning-focused model) – 12 Sep 2024 → 12 Sep 2024 for Pro and API users. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
9. o3-mini – 31 Jan 2025 → 31 Jan 2025. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
10. o3 and o4-mini – 16 Apr 2025 → 16 Apr 2025. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
11. o3-pro – 10 Jun 2025 → 10 Jun 2025. (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
12. GPT-5 (flagship pair “Instant” & “Thinking”) – 7 Aug 2025 press briefing → 7 Aug 2025 roll-out to all ChatGPT paid tiers, per WIRED’s launch story. (https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here/)  
13. GPT-5.1 – 12 Nov 2025 → 12 Nov 2025 (API & ChatGPT update). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  
14. GPT-5.2 – 11 Dec 2025 → 11 Dec 2025 (incremental upgrade). (https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)  

Notes on residual uncertainty  
• OpenAI has not published traditional release notes for several 2025 reasoning variants (o-series) or for the 5.1 / 5.2 upgrades; LifeArchitect.ai’s research compilation is presently the only public source pinning those exact days.  
• No model called “GPT-6” is released yet (see next section).

PART B – Public statements (2024-present) in which OpenAI leadership reference GPT-6  

Only five distinct, citable statements were located:

1. 2 Feb 2025 – Sam Altman (Tokyo media Q&A, translated from Japanese)  
   Altman contrasted “pre-training paradigms” (GPT-3/4) with future “reinforcement learning”-based GPT-5 and GPT-6 and said the next generations “will be like discovering new science.” (LifeArchitect.ai timeline, https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-6/)

2. 19 Aug 2025 – Sam Altman round-table with reporters, San Francisco  
   Told CNBC that GPT-6 “will arrive faster than the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5” and will center on long-term user memory and personalisation. (https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/sam-altman-on-gpt-6-people-want-memory.html)

3. 20 Aug 2025 – Follow-up comments captured by American Bazaar  
   Re-emphasised memory and encryption, adding that GPT-6 would be “much sooner” than the prior upgrade cycle. (https://americanbazaaronline.com/2025/08/20/gpt-6-preview-openais-big-step-toward-personalized-ai-466456/)

4. 18 Oct 2025 – OpenAI spokesperson statement to technology outlets  
   The company “officially confirmed that GPT-6 will not ship in 2025,” countering social-media rumours. (Data Studios round-up, https://www.datastudios.org/post/chatgpt-6-what-we-know-so-far-about-openai-s-new-model)

5. 6 Oct 2025 – Sam Altman interview cited by India Today  
   While defending GPT-5 against critics, Altman said merely that “GPT-6 will be better,” offering no timetable. (https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-critics-are-wrong-calls-it-a-big-leap-toward-real-scientific-ai-2798430-2025-10-06)

No 2024-dated public remarks from Altman, Mira Murati, Greg Brockman or other executives that explicitly name “GPT-6” surfaced in the current corpus.

PART C – Gap analysis & recommended follow-ups  

1. Model-release timeline  
   • Primary, date-stamped OpenAI or Microsoft blog posts for GPT-4o-mini, o-series reasoning models, and the GPT-5.x point releases are still missing.  LifeArchitect.ai is presently the only aggregated source; corroborating blog entries or press releases would strengthen confidence.  
   • Exact time-of-day GA for GPT-5 (“rolling staggered release versus global switch-on”) remains unverified beyond WIRED’s description that “OpenAI has begun rolling out … to all ChatGPT users.”

2. GPT-6 leadership statements  
   • There may be additional brief mentions in long-form interviews (e.g., World Government Summit 2024 fireside chat, Greg Brockman’s DevDay 2025 keynote).  Those transcripts were not in the provided results.  
   • No explicit GPT-6 comments from CTO Mira Murati have been located.

Given these gaps, the most promising next web queries would target original OpenAI blog domains or talk-transcript repositories (e.g., “site:openai.com GPT-5 release notes” or “Altman World Government Summit transcript GPT-6”).  However, based on the evidence currently available, the timeline and quotation list above represents the full public record.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
