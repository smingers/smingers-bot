It distinguishes between marketing announcements and the actual ability for the general public to build applications using the model.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"bb43c81151ff3eac\",\"sheet_id\":53}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves to Yes if, after the opening of this question and before May 1, 2026, OpenAI makes a model explicitly named 'GPT-6' (or a versioned variant such as 'gpt-6-0314') available for general public use in at least one geographic region via its official API or through its ChatGPT website/app interface. \u201cGeneral public use\u201d means accessible via self\u2011serve access (i.e. creating an OpenAI account through standard signup and/or obtaining access by subscribing to a publicly available plan and/or enabling billing), without requiring a specific individual invitation, manual whitelist/allowlist approval, or participation in a closed/private alpha/beta (or application-only limited preview). Resolution sources include official OpenAI API documentation (https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), being announced as generally available via the OpenAI Newsroom (https://openai.com/news/), or [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).",
    "fine_print": "If a model is released with a different name (e.g., 'GPT-Next' or 'o3') but is widely reported by credible sources to be the successor to GPT-5, it will not count unless OpenAI officially designates it as 'GPT-6'.",
