Analysis:
The question hinges on whether, at any time between its opening and April 30 2026 23:59 UTC, OpenAI has actually made a model explicitly named “GPT-6” self-serve accessible (API or ChatGPT) to anyone who can create an ordinary OpenAI account or pay for a standard subscription—no wait-list, no enterprise-only gating. Evidence would most plausibly come from:
• The official OpenAI model index (platform.openai.com/docs/models).  
• A Newsroom post or blog post announcing GPT-6 general availability.  
• Mainstream tech press or developer community write-ups citing that the model is now live in the API or ChatGPT.  
Because today is 31 Jan 2026, any article dated on or before today describing GPT-6 GA would settle the question. Conversely, if only rumors, closed betas, or future-dated plans are found, the criterion is not yet satisfied. Therefore, searches should target January 2026 coverage, OpenAI documentation change-logs, or developer testimonials that explicitly confirm “GPT-6” appearing in the model list or being selectable in ChatGPT Plus/Team/Enterprise.  

Search queries:
1. OpenAI GPT-6 public release (Google)  
2. GPT-6 general availability OpenAI (Google News)  
3. Search recent OpenAI documentation or Newsroom posts from January 2026 confirming whether GPT-6 is listed as a generally available model. (Assistant)
