Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether GPT-6 will be generally available before 1 May 2026 is understanding (a) how long previous OpenAI model generations have taken to progress from announcement to broad public availability, (b) OpenAI’s recent cadence of major releases (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo/Omni, GPT-5 if any), and (c) any on-record statements from OpenAI leadership about GPT-6 development or expected launch windows. Therefore, the most relevant historical context includes the release timelines of GPT-3 through any GPT-5 variant, plus credible interviews, blog posts, regulatory filings, or conference talks from 2024-2026 in which Sam Altman, Mira Murati, or other OpenAI representatives mention GPT-6. News coverage in late-2025 to January-2026 is especially valuable because it would contain the latest status updates shortly before today’s date.
