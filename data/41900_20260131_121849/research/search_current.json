Altman previously issued a 'red alert' within the company to prioritize model performance, but later stated that Gemini 3's impact was less severe than anticipated, with the red alert expected to end by January 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 03:24 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/ai%E5%B0%8D%E6%B1%BA-openai%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8gpt-5-2%E8%99%9F%E7%A8%B1%E6%9C%80%E8%81%B0%E6%98%8E%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B-032416752.html)\n\n**OpenAI's New GPT-5.2 Model is Now Available in Microsoft 365 Copilot**\nOpenAI has officially launched GPT-5.2, a new series of models consisting of GPT-5.2 Instant, GPT-5.2 Thinking, and GPT-5.2 Pro, in response to rising competition from Google and Anthropic. The rollout began immediately, with paid ChatGPT users gaining first access, followed by a gradual expansion. OpenAI claims GPT-5.2 delivers performance improvements in math, science, reasoning, coding, imaging, and agent-style tasks, calling it the 'most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work.' Microsoft has integrated GPT-5.2 into Microsoft 365 Copilot, enabling connections to Work IQ for insights, market research, and strategic planning across emails, meetings, and documents. GPT-5.2 is rolling out to Microsoft 365 Copilot license holders today, with full availability expected in weeks; Microsoft 365 Premium subscribers will gain access early next year. GPT-5.2 is also available in Copilot Studio today in early release environments, and existing agents using GPT-5.1 will automatically upgrade. Google\u2019s Gemini models, including Gemini 3, Veo 3, and Nano Banana, have outperformed GPT-5 in several benchmarks, raising concerns about OpenAI\u2019s competitive edge. Despite this, ChatGPT remains the most widely used AI chatbot globally, with an estimated 700 million weekly active users. The rollout is staggered to maintain system stability, and GPT-5.1 will remain available as a legacy model for three months before retirement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 08:54 PM\nSource:[Windows Report | Error-free Tech Life](https://windowsreport.com/openais-new-gpt-5-2-model-is-now-available-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n**After GPT-4o, OpenAI Has Not Released a Truly New AI Model \u2014 SemiAnalysis**\nAccording to SemiAnalysis, after the release of GPT-4o in May 2024, OpenAI has not launched a single new 'full-scale pre-trained' frontier model. Despite aggressively purchasing accelerators\u2014both from Microsoft and directly\u2014OpenAI\u2019s models, including the GPT-5 series, are built on a 1.5-year-old architecture. Meanwhile, competitors like Google continue training new models from scratch, such as Gemini 3 Pro, which has alarmed CEO Sam Altman, who warned employees of tough times ahead due to competition. SemiAnalysis clarifies that updates like GPT-4.5 Orion and GPT-5 do not qualify as new frontier models, as they are enhancements of GPT-4o rather than independent pre-training efforts; GPT-4.5 Orion, described as the largest and most knowledgeable model, ultimately failed and is now only available in Pro subscriptions. Models like o1, o3, and GPT-5 focus on reinforcement learning and reasoning capabilities rather than large-scale pre-training. The massive GPU investments\u2014estimated at $7 billion in 2024, with $5 billion spent on research and training\u2014appear to be disproportionately allocated, with only a small fraction used for final model deployments. While some resources went to developing image generation models like Sora 2, the scale suggests inefficiency. OpenAI is now prioritizing reasoning capabilities, as emphasized by researcher Lukasz Kaiser, and has an undisclosed experimental model that achieved gold medals in international math and computer science olympiads; this model is expected to be released in late 2025 or early 2026. In an internal memo, Altman acknowledged OpenAI\u2019s lag in pre-training and confirmed plans to catch up using a secret project dubbed 'Shallotpeat'\u2014possibly the same as the olympiad-winning model.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/news/971846/)\n\n**OpenAI GPT-5.1 Set for November 24 Release in Three Versions**\nOpenRouter's CDN code repository inadvertently leaked details about the upcoming release of GPT-5.1 by OpenAI, scheduled for November 24, 2025. The model will be available in three versions: GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1 Reasoning, and GPT-5.1 Pro. Earlier in the week, a mysterious model named 'Polaris Alpha' appeared on the OpenRouter platform, featuring a context length of 256,000 tokens, free access, and strong performance in code generation, tool use, and instruction understanding. The developer stated the model is intended to collect user feedback for future improvements. Community speculation suggests Polaris Alpha may be OpenAI's GPT-5.1 (non-reasoning version). Some testers noted the model produces almost no hallucinations and has a tone highly similar to the GPT-5 series. When asked if it belongs to the GPT-4 family, it responded: 'Yes, I am based on the GPT-4 family model,' reinforcing the speculation of its connection to OpenAI's next-generation models.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8o7EeGTShiK)\n\n**OpenAI Denies Rumor of GPT-6 Launch in 2025, Signals Focus on Incremental Updates and Infrastructure**\nOpenAI has denied rumors that GPT-6 would be launched by the end of 2025, stating that the next major update to its language model is not imminent. The rumor originated from analyst Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, who claimed GPT-6 would be released 'by the end of the year' without providing a source. The claim was refuted by @tszzl, a researcher at OpenAI, who simply replied 'No' on social media in response to a query about the timeline. The current version, GPT-5, was only made available to all users in August 2025. OpenAI is reportedly working on future versions, potentially including a mid-tier release such as GPT-5.1 or GPT-5.5 with incremental improvements, before launching a more advanced GPT-6. In addition to model development, OpenAI is advancing infrastructure through partnerships with Oracle and Nvidia, and beginning in-house AI chip production via a collaboration with Broadcom. These efforts are expected to yield results in 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[TecMundo](https://www.tecmundo.com.br/mercado/407901-openai-desmente-rumor-de-que-gpt-6-seria-lancado-ainda-em-2025.htm)\n\n**OpenAI Won't Release GPT-6 Before End of 2025**\nOpenAI has confirmed that it will not release GPT-6 by the end of 2025. While the company is actively working on the next-generation AI model, no official release date has been set. Instead, OpenAI continues to update and refine GPT-5, which is currently available in multiple versions: GPT-5 Auto (an automatic mode that switches between standard and reasoning modes), GPT-5 reasoning (which provides higher-quality responses at the cost of speed), and GPT-5-instant (which prioritizes speed over depth). The automatic mode activates reasoning mode only when the system determines it will improve the response quality. According to an employee of OpenAI identified as @tszzl on X (formerly Twitter), GPT-6 will not be released by the end of 2025, contradicting earlier claims by analyst Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, who had predicted a release before year-end. OpenAI has officially denied Mahaney\u2019s statement, confirming that GPT-6 is still under development but not imminent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1131057/openai-ne-vipustit-gpt6-do-kontsa-2025-goda)\n\n**OpenAI confirms GPT-6 is not shipping in 2025**\nOpenAI has confirmed that GPT-6 will not be released in 2025, despite viral claims on X (formerly Twitter) by analyst Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, who asserted GPT-6 would launch by year-end. The claim was disputed by Roon, a pseudonymous X account (@tszzl) identified as an OpenAI employee, who explicitly denied the report. OpenAI currently operates multiple versions under the GPT-5 umbrella, including GPT-5 Auto, which dynamically switches between standard and reasoning models based on query complexity, and GPT-5-instant, a faster, non-reasoning model. The company has continuously updated GPT-5 since its release, and while GPT-6 is not imminent, OpenAI may release incremental updates such as GPT-5.5. The denial from an internal source confirms that no GPT-6 launch is planned for 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:52 PM\nSource:[Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-confirms-gpt-6-is-not-shipping-in-2025/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nI conducted a targeted search of OpenAI's official Newsroom posts and documentation from January 2026 to confirm whether GPT-6 has been listed as a generally available model. After examining all relevant results [7][9], I found no evidence that GPT-6 has been announced or made generally available by OpenAI as of January 31, 2026.\n\nKey findings:\n1. **No direct announcements**: None of OpenAI's official Newsroom posts or press releases from January 2026 mention GPT-6 as a released or generally available product [1-13]. The most recent OpenAI-related announcements concern:\n   - Healthcare-specific tools (ChatGPT Health) which are in testing and not yet generally available [9]\n   - Third-party integrations (Codex CLI with GitLab Duo Agent Platform) [7]\n\n2. **GPT-6 absence in product releases**: While the search results show multiple companies (GitLab, Microsoft, Dynatrace) announcing generally available AI products this month [5][7][10], OpenAI's only referenced product is the specialized ChatGPT Health \u2013 not GPT-6 [9].\n\n3. **Conflicting claims verification**: There are no official OpenAI statements about GPT-6 in the search results. The January 2026 timeline appears too early for a GPT-6 release based on:\n   - OpenAI's typical release cadence (approximately 12-24 months between major models)\n   - Industry focus still being on GPT-4/5 integrations [7][9]\n   - No credible leaks or teasers in analyzed coverage\n\n4. **Limitations**: While comprehensive, this search can't guarantee absolute absence of announcements if:\n   - OpenAI made unindexed/non-public statements\n   - Documentation exists outside Newsroom channels\n   - Announcements occurred after the search window (January 31, 12:19 PM)\n\nRecommendation: Monitor OpenAI's official channels for possible Q1/Q2 2026 announcements, and consider repeating this search in February if timing is critical. Current evidence strongly suggests GPT-6 is not yet generally available.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
