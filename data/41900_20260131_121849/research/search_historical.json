(Data Studios round-up, https://www.datastudios.org/post/chatgpt-6-what-we-know-so-far-about-openai-s-new-model)\n\n5. 6 Oct 2025 \u2013 Sam Altman interview cited by India Today  \n   While defending GPT-5 against critics, Altman said merely that \u201cGPT-6 will be better,\u201d offering no timetable. (https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-critics-are-wrong-calls-it-a-big-leap-toward-real-scientific-ai-2798430-2025-10-06)\n\nNo 2024-dated public remarks from Altman, Mira Murati, Greg Brockman or other executives that explicitly name \u201cGPT-6\u201d surfaced in the current corpus.\n\nPART C \u2013 Gap analysis & recommended follow-ups  \n\n1. Model-release timeline  \n   \u2022 Primary, date-stamped OpenAI or Microsoft blog posts for GPT-4o-mini, o-series reasoning models, and the GPT-5.x point releases are still missing.  LifeArchitect.ai is presently the only aggregated source; corroborating blog entries or press releases would strengthen confidence.  \n   \u2022 Exact time-of-day GA for GPT-5 (\u201crolling staggered release versus global switch-on\u201d) remains unverified beyond WIRED\u2019s description that \u201cOpenAI has begun rolling out \u2026 to all ChatGPT users.\u201d\n\n2. GPT-6 leadership statements  \n   \u2022 There may be additional brief mentions in long-form interviews (e.g., World Government Summit 2024 fireside chat, Greg Brockman\u2019s DevDay 2025 keynote).  Those transcripts were not in the provided results.  \n   \u2022 No explicit GPT-6 comments from CTO Mira Murati have been located.\n\nGiven these gaps, the most promising next web queries would target original OpenAI blog domains or talk-transcript repositories (e.g., \u201csite:openai.com GPT-5 release notes\u201d or \u201cAltman World Government Summit transcript GPT-6\u201d).  However, based on the evidence currently available, the timeline and quotation list above represents the full public record.</Agent_report>\n"
