Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **FREE NETWORK (Dec 2025)**: Documents the October 22, 2025 sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, including secondary sanctions clauses. Provides specific market data (share price drops, oil price discounts, revenue impacts). High quality factual source with quantifiable metrics.

2. **Treasury Department (Dec 23, 2025)**: Official OFAC announcement of Rosneft/Lukoil designations. States that transactions "may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions" but describes existing legal authorities rather than announcing NEW secondary sanctions. Primary source, highest reliability for what was actually announced.

3. **Arnold Porter (Oct 2025)**: Legal analysis noting the U.S. "left open the possibility" of secondary sanctions but had NOT imposed them as of October 2025. Professional legal assessment distinguishing between threats and actual implementation.

4. **UNITED24 Media (July 2025)**: Ukrainian source discussing proposed 500% tariff bill. Contains expert opinion from Maximilian Hess (FPRI Fellow) expressing skepticism Trump would implement. Potential bias given Ukrainian source, but quotes identifiable expert.

5. **Financial Post/Bloomberg**: Reports U.S. held back on China secondary sanctions due to ongoing trade negotiations. Ambassador Whitaker's statements are factual but represent diplomatic positioning.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive timeline distinguishing between primary sanctions, secondary sanctions threats, and actual secondary sanctions implementation. Key finding: The Jan 10, 2025 "Energy-Sector Secondary-Sanctions Determination" and Oct 22, 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations created the FRAMEWORK for secondary sanctions but the report notes enforcement has been selective. High-quality synthesis with proper sourcing.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 2026):**

1. **EU 20th Sanctions Package (multiple sources, Jan 31, 2026)**: Multiple credible sources (Bloomberg, France24, etc.) report EU preparing comprehensive sanctions package for Feb 24, 2026 adoption. This is EU action, NOT U.S. action. Important distinction.

2. **Trump Cuba Executive Order (Jan 30, 2026)**: Factual report of Trump signing order authorizing secondary tariffs on countries supplying oil to Cuba. This shows Trump IS willing to use secondary sanctions mechanisms, but for Cuba, not Russia.

3. **India/GTRI Analysis (Nov 2025)**: Think tank urging India to halt Russian oil imports to avoid secondary sanctions. This reflects FEAR of potential sanctions, not actual new announcements.

4. **October 2025 Market Reports**: Multiple sources document the October 22, 2025 sanctions and their market impact. Chinese/Indian refiners suspending purchases shows the threat of secondary sanctions is affecting behavior even without formal new designations.

**Key Factual Distinctions:**
- The October 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil sanctions included secondary sanctions WARNINGS and FRAMEWORKS
- No new secondary sanctions have been formally announced since October 2025
- The question asks about NEW secondary sanctions before May 1, 2026

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **U.S. Secondary Sanctions on Iran (2010-2019)**: 
   - Took 9 years from first oil-banking sanctions to NIOC designation
   - Involved multiple legislative mandates and presidential determinations
   - Suitability: Moderate - different geopolitical context, but shows U.S. pattern of gradual escalation

2. **Trump Administration Sanctions Patterns (2017-2021, 2025-2026)**:
   - First term: Inconsistent on Russia, focused on Iran/Venezuela
   - Second term (2025-): October 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil sanctions were first major Russia action
   - Cuba secondary sanctions (Jan 2026) show willingness to use mechanism
   - Suitability: High - most relevant to current administration's behavior

3. **Post-Ukraine Invasion Sanctions Escalation (2022-2026)**:
   - Gradual tightening over 3+ years
   - Price cap mechanism (Dec 2022) took precedence over volume restrictions
   - Secondary sanctions framework established but selectively enforced
   - Suitability: High - directly relevant timeframe and context

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Trump administration's second-term sanctions pattern (2025-2026), combined with the post-invasion escalation trajectory. This captures both the political decision-making style and the strategic context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 90 days (January 31, 2026 to May 1, 2026)

**Historical Patterns:**

1. **October 22 - January 31 (101 days elapsed)**:
   - No new secondary sanctions announced since Rosneft/Lukoil designations
   - Trump administration focused on: Cuba sanctions (Jan 30), trade negotiations with China, Ukraine peace talks
   - EU preparing 20th package (Feb 24 target) but this is EU, not U.S.

2. **Trump's Decision-Making Speed**:
   - Cuba sanctions: Announced within days of perceived need
   - Russia sanctions (Oct 2025): First major action came 9 months into second term
   - Pattern suggests: Quick action on priorities, slow/reluctant on Russia

3. **Seasonal/Political Factors**:
   - Feb-April 2026: Potential for EU coordination (Feb 24 EU package)
   - No major U.S. political deadlines in this window
   - Ukraine war dynamics: Reports suggest Trump pursuing negotiations, not escalation

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Low Probability:**

1. **Recent Administrative Focus**: Trump's Jan 30, 2026 Cuba sanctions show he can act quickly on secondary sanctions when motivated, but Russia is not the current focus.

2. **Existing Framework Sufficiency**: The October 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations already created secondary sanctions exposure for foreign entities. Market behavior (Chinese/Indian refiners reducing purchases) shows the threat is working without new formal announcements.

3. **Political Constraints**: 
   - Ambassador Whitaker explicitly stated (per Financial Post) that secondary sanctions on China are held back due to trade negotiations
   - Trump's pattern shows preference for deals over sanctions escalation with Russia

4. **Legislative Stalemate**: The Graham bill (500% tariffs) has been stalled since November 2025 with no Trump endorsement.

5. **Enforcement vs. New Announcements**: The Agent report notes enforcement has been selective. OFAC could increase enforcement of existing authorities without announcing "new" secondary sanctions.

**Factors Supporting Higher Probability:**

1. **EU Coordination Possibility**: If EU adopts aggressive 20th package (Feb 24), U.S. might coordinate complementary measures.

2. **Unpredictability**: Multiple sources note Trump's erratic behavior; sudden escalation cannot be ruled out.

3. **Ukraine War Dynamics**: Major Russian escalation could trigger rapid U.S. response.

4. **Technical Interpretation**: OFAC could issue new determinations or designations under existing E.O. 14114 authority that would technically qualify as "new secondary sanctions."

**Critical Question Resolution Criteria**:
The question requires "new sanctions that explicitly target non-Russian persons, entities, or countries for their role in purchasing, financing, insuring, or transporting Russian crude oil or petroleum products." The October 2025 measures created this framework but haven't been followed by additional explicit announcements targeting third parties.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Source Data:**
- 101 days since last major announcement (Oct 22, 2025) with no new secondary sanctions
- Trump administration has shown it CAN act quickly (Cuba sanctions) but HASN'T on Russia
- EU preparing action (Feb 24) but question is specifically about U.S. action
- Agent report timeline shows ~3-month gaps between major escalations historically

**Probability Calibration:**
- Base rate from reference class: In the 9 months of Trump's second term (Jan-Oct 2025), one major secondary sanctions framework was announced. That's roughly 1 announcement per 270 days.
- For a 90-day window: 90/270 = 33% if pattern continues
- However, adjustment factors:
  * October announcement was the FIRST major action; second actions typically take longer
  * Current focus on trade negotiations and Cuba suggests Russia not priority
  * Existing framework may be sufficient for administration's goals
  * EU action could trigger coordination, but U.S. tends to lead, not follow

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce from 33% base to account for:
  * Administration's demonstrated reluctance (halving to ~16%)
  * Sufficiency of existing framework (further reduction to ~12%)
  * But maintain some probability for:
    * EU coordination possibility (+3%)
    * Unpredictability/sudden escalation (+3%)
    * Technical new designations under existing authority (+2%)

**Final Calibration**: The probability should reflect that new announcements are possible but not likely given current patterns. The 15-20% range captures meaningful possibility while acknowledging the dominant factors point toward no new action.
