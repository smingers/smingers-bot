Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Official U.S. Government Sources:**

1. **Treasury Department Press Release (Dec 23, 2025)**: Primary source documenting Rosneft/Lukoil sanctions. States transactions "may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions" but this describes existing legal framework, not NEW secondary sanctions. Highest reliability. **Factual**: Designation occurred. **Opinion**: Secretary Bessent's statement about being "prepared to take further action" is forward-looking intent, not announcement.

2. **Trump Cuba Executive Order (Jan 30, 2026)**: Factual report of secondary tariffs mechanism for Cuba oil suppliers. Demonstrates Trump's willingness to use secondary sanctions tools, but for Cuba, not Russia. High reliability.

**Legal/Professional Analysis:**

3. **Crowell & Moring (Oct 28, 2025)**: Legal analysis distinguishing between secondary sanctions authority (exists since Jan 10, 2025) and actual implementation. Notes the Rosneft/Lukoil designations create "threat" of secondary sanctions to "deter" third parties. **Factual**: Framework exists. **Opinion**: Expert legal assessment that threat, not implementation, is the current strategy.

4. **Arnold Porter, Mondaq, BIPC (Oct-Dec 2025)**: Multiple legal firms confirming October 2025 sanctions were PRIMARY sanctions on Russian entities, with secondary sanctions as potential consequence. Consistent professional consensus. High reliability for distinguishing sanction types.

**News Reporting:**

5. **CNN (Oct 22, 2025)**: Eddie Fishman (Atlantic Council) explicitly states: "the key will be if there's a threat of secondary sanctions" - distinguishing what was announced (primary) from what would be impactful (secondary). **Expert opinion** from identifiable source with relevant credentials.

6. **France 24 (Jan 31, 2026)**: Reports Trump administration "expanded" secondary sanctions to cover "four-fifths of Russia's oil production." This is potentially significant but needs verification - it may refer to the scope of entities covered under existing framework rather than NEW announcements. Mixed reliability - factual on market impacts, but the "expanded" claim requires scrutiny.

7. **AskNews Deep Research Analysis**: Claims "highly likely" new secondary sanctions will be imposed, citing Graham-Blumenthal bill with "84 senators backing it" and Trump endorsement. However, this contradicts other sources showing Trump has NOT endorsed the bill and has actually delayed it. **Critical discrepancy** - the analysis appears to conflate proposed legislation with actual policy.

**EU Sources (Jan 31, 2026):**

8. **Bloomberg/Multiple EU Sources**: EU preparing 20th sanctions package for Feb 24, 2026 adoption, potentially banning services for Russian oil transport. This is EU action, NOT U.S. action. Factual reporting but not directly relevant to question.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Against New Secondary Sanctions):**

1. **101-day gap with no action**: Since Oct 22, 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations, no new U.S. secondary sanctions announced despite multiple opportunities. This is direct observational evidence over a substantial timeframe.

2. **Multiple independent legal sources**: Crowell & Moring, Arnold Porter, Mondaq all independently confirm October 2025 measures were primary sanctions with secondary sanctions framework, not new secondary sanctions themselves. Professional consensus from identifiable experts.

3. **Administrative focus elsewhere**: Jan 30, 2026 Cuba sanctions demonstrate Trump CAN act quickly on secondary sanctions when motivated, but Russia is not receiving similar attention. Behavioral pattern evidence.

4. **Explicit diplomatic statements**: Financial Post reports Ambassador Whitaker stated secondary sanctions on China held back due to trade negotiations. Direct causal mechanism explained by official source.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Mixed Signals):**

1. **France 24 "expansion" claim**: If accurate that secondary sanctions were "expanded" to cover four-fifths of Russian production, this could qualify as "new" secondary sanctions. However, single source and unclear whether this refers to new announcements or just the cumulative effect of October designations. Requires verification.

2. **Market behavior changes**: Chinese/Indian refiners reducing purchases shows sanctions framework is having effect, but this could be response to existing threats rather than new measures. Indirect evidence.

3. **EU coordination timing**: Feb 24, 2026 EU package could trigger U.S. coordination, but historically U.S. leads rather than follows. Speculative causal link.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Graham-Blumenthal bill**: AskNews analysis claims strong support and Trump endorsement, but this contradicts other sources. Even if bill exists, legislative process typically takes months. Speculative and potentially inaccurate.

2. **Expert predictions**: Various analysts predict sanctions likely, but these are opinions about future actions, not evidence of actual policy direction.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: 90 days (Jan 31 - May 1, 2026)

**Historical Pattern**: 
- Jan 10, 2025: Secondary sanctions authority established
- Oct 22, 2025: Major designation (285 days later)
- Jan 31, 2026: Current date (101 days later, no new action)

Pattern suggests ~9-month intervals between major escalations.

**If Timeframe Halved (45 days to ~March 15, 2026)**:
- Would include Feb 24 EU package adoption - potential coordination window
- Probability would increase to ~25% due to EU coordination possibility
- Still constrained by Trump's demonstrated reluctance and trade negotiation priorities

**If Timeframe Doubled (180 days to ~August 2026)**:
- Probability would increase to ~35-40%
- More time for: (1) legislative process, (2) failed negotiations triggering escalation, (3) market conditions requiring intervention
- Historical ~9-month pattern would suggest another action cycle possible

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Adjustment from 18% Outside View:**

**Factors Supporting Lower Probability (Downward Pressure):**

1. **Definitional scrutiny**: The France 24 "expansion" claim is the only potential evidence of new secondary sanctions post-October. Upon examination, this likely refers to the cumulative scope of October designations (Rosneft + Lukoil = 80% of production) rather than a NEW announcement. This removes the strongest piece of evidence for "Yes."

2. **AskNews analysis reliability issues**: The deep research analysis claims Trump endorsed the Graham bill and that 84 senators support it, but provides no verifiable source links. This contradicts other reporting showing Trump has actually delayed sanctions to maintain negotiating leverage. This removes another pillar of the "Yes" case.

3. **Behavioral consistency**: Trump's Jan 30 Cuba action demonstrates he uses secondary sanctions when strategically motivated. The 101-day gap on Russia shows Russia is not similarly prioritized. Strong behavioral evidence.

**Factors Supporting Higher Probability (Upward Pressure):**

1. **EU coordination window**: Feb 24 EU package is confirmed by multiple sources. While U.S. typically leads, coordinated announcements are possible. However, this is only ~24 days away - very tight timeline for U.S. bureaucratic process.

2. **Existing framework**: OFAC could issue new designations under existing E.O. 14114 authority without major policy announcement. This would technically qualify as "new" secondary sanctions. However, pattern suggests selective enforcement rather than expansion.

3. **Unpredictability factor**: Trump's decision-making is documented as erratic. Cannot completely rule out sudden policy shift.

**Net Assessment:**

The evidence strongly suggests the October 2025 framework is being enforced through threats and selective action rather than new formal announcements. The absence of action over 101 days, combined with clear administrative focus elsewhere (Cuba, trade negotiations), indicates low probability of new announcements in next 90 days.

The France 24 "expansion" claim, if verified, could shift probability upward, but current evidence suggests this is misinterpretation rather than new policy.

**Adjustment from 18% Outside View:**
- Remove France 24 evidence (unverified): -3%
- Remove AskNews legislative claims (unreliable): -2%  
- Add EU coordination window: +2%
- Add unpredictability factor: +2%
- Maintain existing framework sufficiency: -2%

**Net adjustment: -3%**

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 18% outside view, the inside view analysis reveals:

1. **The strongest evidence for "Yes" (France 24 expansion, Graham bill) is either unverified or contradicted by other sources**
2. **The 101-day gap represents strong negative evidence - Trump has shown he CAN act quickly (Cuba) but ISN'T on Russia**
3. **The EU coordination window (Feb 24) provides a narrow opportunity but insufficient evidence of U.S. planning**

The resolution criteria requires "new sanctions that explicitly target non-Russian persons, entities, or countries." The October 2025 framework created this mechanism but subsequent enforcement has been through threats rather than new explicit announcements.

**Calibration Check:**
- At 15%: "15 out of 100 times, U.S. announces new secondary sanctions on Russian oil by May 1, 2026"
- This feels aligned with: low but non-zero probability, accounting for EU coordination possibility and Trump unpredictability
- At 10%: Would underweight the EU window and technical designation possibilities
- At 20%: Would overweight unverified evidence and ignore the strong behavioral pattern

**Final calibrated probability: 15%**

This reflects:
- Strong evidence against new announcements (behavioral pattern, administrative focus, trade priorities)
- Weak evidence for new announcements (unverified expansion claims, speculative legislative process)
- Meaningful but constrained upside risk (EU coordination, technical designations, unpredictability)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will U.S. announce new secondary sanctions explicitly targeting third parties for Russian oil trade by May 1, 2026 (90 days)?

2. **Base rate**: 18% from outside view (one major action per ~270 days, adjusted for context). Final prediction 15% is tethered to this base with justified downward adjustment.

3. **Consistency**: "15 out of 100 times, U.S. announces new secondary sanctions targeting third parties for Russian oil by May 1, 2026." Yes - this aligns with low probability given 101-day gap, administrative focus elsewhere, but acknowledges EU coordination window and unpredictability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - 101 days since last major action with no new announcements (STRONG, verified)
   - Trump Cuba sanctions show capability but Russia not prioritized (STRONG, verified)
   - France 24 "expansion" claim unverified, likely misinterpretation (WEAK, contradicted)
   - EU Feb 24 package creates coordination window (MODERATE, verified but speculative link)
   - Multiple legal sources confirm October = framework, not new secondary sanctions (STRONG, verified)

5. **Blind spot**: If OFAC issues technical designations of specific foreign banks/entities under existing E.O. 14114 authority in coordination with Feb 24 EU package, this would qualify as "new" secondary sanctions and make forecast wrong. Probability of this scenario: ~10-12%, already incorporated.

6. **Status quo**: Strong status quo bias warranted. World changes slowly, Trump has shown 9-month action cycles on Russia, current focus is trade/Cuba. Status quo = no new announcements. This supports the 15% probability.

Probability: 15%
