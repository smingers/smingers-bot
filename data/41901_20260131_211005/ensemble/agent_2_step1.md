Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **FREE NETWORK (Dec 2025)**: Reports on October 22, 2025 sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, including secondary sanctions clause. Provides specific market data (share price drops, import volumes, discount widening). High-quality source with quantifiable metrics. Key fact: Secondary sanctions were threatened but not yet imposed as new measures—they describe existing legal authorities.

2. **Treasury Department (Dec 23, 2025)**: Official OFAC announcement designating Rosneft and Lukoil. States that "engaging in certain transactions... may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions" but describes existing frameworks under E.O. 14024, not new secondary sanctions. This is a primary source of highest reliability.

3. **Arnold Porter (Oct 2025)**: Legal analysis noting U.S. "left open the possibility" of secondary sanctions but had not imposed them as of October 2025. Professional legal assessment distinguishing between primary sanctions (imposed) and secondary sanctions (threatened but not enacted).

4. **UNITED24 Media (July 2025)**: Ukrainian media reporting Trump considering 500% tariff bill. Includes expert opinion from Maximilian Hess (FPRI) expressing skepticism about full implementation. Source bias should be noted given Ukrainian perspective, but expert opinion is identifiable and credible.

5. **Financial Post/Bloomberg**: Reports U.S. held back from secondary sanctions on China due to ongoing trade negotiations. Ambassador Whitaker's statements are factual and attributable. Notes tariffs on India but not China.

6. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive timeline 2022-Jan 2026. High-quality synthesis distinguishing between: (1) primary sanctions on Russian entities, (2) warnings/threats of secondary sanctions, and (3) actual secondary sanctions authorities (E.O. 14114, Dec 2023). Key insight: E.O. 14114 authorized secondary sanctions but focused on military-industrial base; January 10, 2025 determination expanded to energy sector but applied to existing designations.

**Recent News (AskNews articles, Jan 2026):**

7. **EU Sanctions Packages**: Multiple sources report EU preparing 20th package by Feb 24, 2026, potentially replacing price cap with maritime services ban. These are EU measures, not U.S. secondary sanctions.

8. **Trump Cuba Order (Jan 30, 2026)**: Trump signed order imposing secondary tariffs on countries supplying oil to Cuba—this is a NEW secondary sanctions measure but targets Cuba, not Russia.

9. **U.S. Sanctions Analysis (Jan 8, 2026)**: National Law Review confirms October 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations included secondary sanctions warnings but describes existing legal framework, not new announcements.

10. **Deep Research Analysis**: Concludes new U.S. secondary sanctions unlikely before May 2026, citing legislative stalemate, Trump's unpredictability, and competing priorities.

**Key Distinction**: The October 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations included language about secondary sanctions exposure but relied on existing E.O. 14114 authority (established Dec 2023, expanded Jan 2025). The question asks about "NEW secondary sanctions"—meaning new announcements explicitly targeting third parties beyond existing frameworks.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **U.S. Secondary Sanctions on Iran (2010-2019)**: Took 9 years from first oil-banking sanctions to NIOC designation. However, different geopolitical context and congressional mandates vs. executive discretion for Russia.

2. **Trump Administration Russia Policy (2017-2021, 2025-present)**: First term showed reluctance for aggressive Russia sanctions despite congressional pressure (CAATSA). Second term (2025-) shows similar pattern—threats but limited follow-through, focus on deal-making.

3. **Recent U.S. Sanctions Escalation Timeline (2022-2026)**: From initial import ban (Mar 2022) to Rosneft/Lukoil designations (Oct 2025) = 3.5 years. Pattern shows gradual escalation with long gaps between major steps.

4. **Secondary Sanctions Announcements Specifically**: E.O. 14114 (Dec 2023) authorized framework; Jan 2025 energy-sector determination expanded it; Oct 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil triggered exposure. No new announcement of secondary sanctions since Jan 2025.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Trump administration Russia policy patterns (2025-present) combined with recent sanctions timeline, as these most directly inform near-term probability given current political context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 89 days (Jan 31, 2026 to May 1, 2026)—approximately 3 months.

**Historical Patterns**:
- Oct 22, 2025: Rosneft/Lukoil designated (primary sanctions with secondary exposure under existing framework)
- Jan 10, 2025: Energy-sector secondary sanctions determination (last major secondary sanctions announcement)
- Gap between Jan 2025 and Oct 2025 = 9 months with no new secondary sanctions announcements
- Current gap (Oct 2025 to Jan 31, 2026) = 3+ months with no new announcements

**Relevant Timeline Factors**:
- EU 20th package expected Feb 24, 2026 (24 days away)
- Trump's 90-day China trade truce mentioned in sources suggests major decisions deferred
- No active U.S. legislation on Russian oil secondary sanctions
- Trump Cuba order (Jan 30) shows capacity for secondary sanctions but different target

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Low Probability**:

1. **Existing Framework Sufficiency**: The Jan 2025 energy-sector determination already exposes third parties to secondary sanctions for dealing with designated entities. The Oct 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil designations activated this framework without requiring new announcements.

2. **Political Dynamics**: Trump has shown reluctance to impose aggressive Russia sanctions, preferring negotiation. The Financial Post article explicitly states U.S. held back on China secondary sanctions due to trade talks. Trump's focus on Cuba (Jan 30 order) suggests other priorities.

3. **Market Impact Already Achieved**: Sources show Indian refiners cut purchases 13%, Chinese traders paused, without new secondary sanctions—existing measures are working.

4. **Legislative Stalemate**: The 500% tariff bill has stalled since November 2025 with no presidential support. No congressional momentum for new measures.

5. **Time Constraints**: 89 days is a short window. Major sanctions packages typically require months of interagency coordination. EU's 20th package has been in works since December 2025.

**Factors Supporting Higher Probability**:

1. **Trump Unpredictability**: The Cuba order (Jan 30) demonstrates Trump can act quickly on secondary sanctions when motivated.

2. **EU Coordination**: If EU implements aggressive measures Feb 24, U.S. might follow with complementary secondary sanctions.

3. **Geopolitical Triggers**: Russian escalation in Ukraine or elsewhere could prompt rapid response.

4. **Existing Authority**: OFAC can issue new determinations under E.O. 14114 without legislation.

**Resolution Criteria Considerations**:
- Must be "new sanctions that explicitly target non-Russian persons, entities, or countries"
- Must be "for their role in purchasing, financing, insuring, or transporting Russian crude oil or petroleum products"
- "Renewals or expansions of existing primary sanctions against Russian entities do not count"
- Must be "secondary in nature, penalizing third parties"

The October 2025 designations included secondary sanctions language but applied existing authority. A NEW announcement would need to explicitly designate third-party entities (e.g., specific Chinese banks, Indian refiners, or shipping companies) or announce new secondary sanctions determinations beyond the Jan 2025 framework.

Outside view calibration:

**Base Rate Anchoring**:
- Historical pattern: 1 major secondary sanctions announcement in past 12 months (Jan 2025 energy determination)
- Probability of another in next 3 months ≈ 12-month rate × (3/12) = ~25% × 0.25 = ~6-7% baseline

**Adjustments**:

*Downward* (-3-4%):
- Trump's demonstrated reluctance and competing priorities
- Existing framework already operational
- No legislative momentum
- Market impact achieved without new measures

*Upward* (+1-2%):
- Trump's capacity for sudden action (Cuba example)
- Possible EU coordination effect
- Geopolitical wildcards

**Comparable Probabilities**:
- 5% = 1-in-20 odds (very unlikely but not negligible)
- 10% = 1-in-10 odds (unlikely)
- 15% = ~1-in-7 odds (moderately unlikely)

**Tethering to Sources**:
The Deep Research Analysis concluded "improbable" which suggests <20%. The pattern of 9-month gap (Jan-Oct 2025) followed by current 3+ month gap with 89 days remaining suggests low single-digit probability per month, compounding to ~5-8% over 3 months.

**Calibration Consideration**:
Given the high bar for "NEW" secondary sanctions (not just using existing frameworks) and Trump's demonstrated pattern, but acknowledging non-zero probability from unpredictability and geopolitical risks, a probability in the 6-9% range appears justified.
