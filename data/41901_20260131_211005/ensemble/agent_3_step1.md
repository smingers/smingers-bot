Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says + quality)

1) **FREE NETWORK / Freepolicybriefs (Dec 7, 2025)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Reports U.S. sanctions announced Oct 22, 2025 on Rosneft/Lukoil with a *secondary-sanctions mechanism* (foreign banks could be restricted from U.S. correspondent banking if they do significant transactions). Notes market impacts (Urals-Brent discount widening; import shifts in India/China).  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** Causal claims about “caught Putin off guard,” and projected/attributed impacts are partly interpretive.  
- **Quality:** Medium. Useful narrative and indicative data points, but not a primary U.S. government record; possible selectivity and the excerpt is incomplete.

2) **U.S. Treasury / OFAC press release (Dec 23, 2025; sb0290)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Primary documentation that Rosneft and Lukoil were designated under E.O. 14024; includes explicit language warning foreign financial institutions that certain dealings “may risk” secondary sanctions via correspondent/payable-through restrictions.  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** None needed; this is authoritative for what the U.S. announced.  
- **Quality:** High (primary source). Also clarifies an important nuance: it reads more like a warning/available authority than a brand-new secondary-sanctions program.

3) **Arnold & Porter advisory (Oct 2025)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Summarizes US/UK/EU measures and explicitly says the U.S. “left open the possibility” of secondary sanctions; discusses exposure of banks in China/India/Turkey.  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** Legal-risk framing and scenario analysis is advisory judgment.  
- **Quality:** High for legal characterization, but it’s still a secondary summary (not the official act itself).

4) **UNITED24 Media (July 11, 2025)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Reports Trump considering a bill for extremely high tariffs tied to Russian oil; quotes an identified expert (Maximilian Hess).  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** Strongly speculative; frames as “global embargo equivalent”; outlet has clear pro-Ukraine perspective.  
- **Quality:** Medium-low. Useful mainly as evidence that “secondary tariff/sanctions” ideas were being floated in 2025, not as a reliable indicator of near-term enactment.

5) **Financial Post / Bloomberg summary (date not shown here; content clearly late 2025/early 2026)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Says U.S. has “held back” secondary sanctions on China due to trade negotiations; mentions tariffs on India tied to Russian crude; notes European pressure for secondary sanctions.  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** Some causal interpretation (negotiations as the reason).  
- **Quality:** High-medium. Bloomberg sourcing is generally strong; still, it’s reporting on deliberations (inherently squishier than announcements).

6) **Financial Times headline stub (“EU weighs sanctions on China…”)**  
- **What it contributes (facts):** Essentially none beyond “EU is considering.”  
- **Quality:** Low for this exercise because the substantive content is missing.

7) **Agent report (timeline 2022–Jan 2026 + Iran comparison)**  
- **What it contributes (facts/claims):** Assembles a coherent chronology, including: E.O. 14114 (Dec 2023) as a secondary-sanctions-style authority; Jan 10, 2025 “energy-sector secondary-sanctions determination”; Oct 22, 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil SDN designations; GL carve-outs.  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** The Russia–Iran parallels and some “pivotal” language are interpretive. Also, some specifics (e.g., exact content of the Jan 10, 2025 determination) are presented without embedded primary links in the excerpt.  
- **Quality:** Medium. Useful structure and reference-class anchoring, but should be treated cautiously where it asserts details not directly quoted from primary documents.

8) **Asknews articles (Jan 30–31, 2026; mostly about EU 20th package; one about Cuba tariffs)**  
- **What they contribute (facts):** Indicate EU is likely to tighten oil-service restrictions by late Feb 2026; show the broader sanctions environment is active. One article says Trump signed an emergency declaration enabling “secondary tariffs” on oil suppliers to Cuba (if accurate, it suggests willingness to use extraterritorial economic tools).  
- **What is interpretation/opinion:** Many are secondhand Bloomberg retellings in other languages; Russia/Ukraine-related outlets may amplify.  
- **Quality:** Medium overall. Useful for “policy atmosphere,” weak for directly proving imminent *U.S.* action on *Russian* oil secondary sanctions.

**Key takeaway from sources for the outside view:** the U.S. has already moved to a posture where secondary sanctions risk around Russian oil is real (and was explicitly messaged in late 2025), but reporting also suggests the U.S. sometimes holds back—especially regarding China—when trade diplomacy is in play.

### (b) Reference class analysis (base rates)

I see three plausible reference classes:

1) **“U.S. announces at least one new Russia-oil-related secondary/extraterritorial measure in a 3-month window.”**  
- Pros: Closest to the resolution criteria and the short horizon.  
- Cons: Small-n and definitional ambiguity (what counts as “secondary” vs simply designating a foreign entity under primary SDN authorities for sanctions evasion).

2) **“U.S. announces any new Russia sanctions package (any sector) in a 3-month window.”**  
- Pros: More data (especially 2022–2024).  
- Cons: Overstates oil-specific probability; oil has been treated more cautiously than other sectors.

3) **“U.S. announces new secondary sanctions in any major sanctions program (Iran/Russia/etc.) in a 3-month window.”**  
- Pros: Helps with the “rare event” nature of truly new secondary sanctions architecture.  
- Cons: Too broad; different geopolitics and legal tools.

**Most suitable:** (1), but with a conservative interpretation: we’re looking for *a new U.S. announcement that explicitly targets non-Russian third parties* for purchasing/financing/insuring/transporting Russian oil—i.e., a new “secondary-style” move, not merely rhetoric.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast window:** from **Jan 31, 2026 to May 1, 2026** ≈ **90 days (~3 months)**.
- **Pattern over similar periods:**  
  - When the U.S. is in an active sanctions phase, OFAC actions can occur monthly.  
  - But “new secondary sanctions” (as defined here: explicitly targeting third parties for Russian oil trade) are **less frequent** than generic SDN additions.  
  - Recent context suggests **late 2025 was a major escalation** (Rosneft/Lukoil), which often produces **follow-on enforcement/designations** in subsequent months—but not always within just one quarter, and not always framed as “secondary” rather than “evasion/material support” designations.

---

### (d) Justification (outside-view synthesis)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** the U.S. maintains the late-2025 posture—major Russian oil firms sanctioned; secondary-sanctions risk is communicated; enforcement may continue but could also be throttled for diplomatic/trade reasons (notably vis-à-vis China).

**Mechanisms that yield a “Yes” within ~3 months (what would have to happen):**
- OFAC/White House/Congress announces a new measure explicitly aimed at **non-Russian**:
  - a foreign bank facilitating Russian oil payments,
  - non-Russian shipowners/insurers/traders materially enabling Russian crude exports,
  - or a clear new rule/determination that penalizes third-country purchase/transport/insurance of Russian oil (including “secondary tariffs” explicitly tied to Russian oil buyers, if structured as sanctions).

**Mechanisms that yield a “No”:**
- The U.S. limits itself to:  
  - renewals, guidance, enforcement of existing constraints without new third-party targeting, or  
  - primarily Russia-facing designations and rhetoric, while avoiding measures that directly hit major third-country buyers/financial channels, especially amid sensitive trade negotiations.

**Outside-view leaning:** In a random 3-month slice, the probability of a genuinely new, explicitly third-party-targeting U.S. action tied to Russian oil exports is **meaningful but not dominant**. The strongest base-rate argument for “Yes” is that once you have major oil-sector designations, follow-on actions against facilitators are common. The strongest base-rate argument for “No” is that (i) the window is short, and (ii) U.S. administrations often hesitate to trigger broad extraterritorial blowback (China/India) unless there’s a forcing event.

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor:** Treat “new U.S. secondary-style sanctions tied to Russian oil” as occurring on the order of **~0.3 to 0.6 times per quarter** in periods of active escalation, but lower in periods where diplomacy/energy-price stability dominate. A mid-anchor might imply ~25–45% chance in a quarter (Poisson-style intuition).
- **Adjustments (outside view, not inside):**
  - Upward: late-2025 escalation increases the base rate of follow-on actions in early 2026.  
  - Downward: the horizon is only ~90 days and “secondary” is a narrower criterion than “any new sanctions.”

Netting those, I land in the low-to-mid 30s.
