Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / what counts
Question: Between now (2026-01-31) and before 2026-05-01, will the U.S. announce *new* “secondary” sanctions explicitly penalizing non‑Russian third parties for buying/financing/insuring/transporting Russian crude or petroleum products? Primary sanctions on Russian entities alone do not count.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs opinion)
1. U.S. Treasury / OFAC press release (Dec 23, 2025) — https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290  
High reliability primary source. Fact: Rosneft/Lukoil designated (primary blocking). Fact: text warns foreign financial institutions that significant transactions with designees “may risk” secondary sanctions (correspondent/payable-through restrictions). Key: this is mainly a warning/authority framing, not an announcement of *new* secondary sanctions targeting third parties.

2. Mondaq client article (posted 2025; discusses Oct 2025 actions)  
Medium reliability (secondary summary). Mostly factual recitation of UK/US actions and general licenses; not an official source. Useful for context; not dispositive for “new secondary sanctions.”

3. BIPC commentary article (date not specified in snippet; discussing 2025 environment)  
Lower-moderate reliability (commentary + some factual claims). Contains discussion of proposed U.S. legislation and asserted effects on India/China. Treat legislative descriptions as plausible but verify elsewhere; treat geopolitical interpretations as opinion.

4. Crowell & Moring client alert (Oct 28, 2025)  
High reliability legal analysis. Fact: explains existing authorities and that Rosneft/Lukoil designations increase secondary-sanctions exposure. Opinion/analysis: expected deterrent effects. Strong on the key definitional point: “threat/authority” ≠ “newly imposed secondary sanctions.”

5. CNN report (Oct 22, 2025)  
High reliability mainstream reporting. Fact: U.S. imposed primary sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil; Treasury Sec. Bessent quote “sanctions, not secondary tariffs.” Contains identifiable expert opinion (Eddie Fishman) that the “real test” is whether U.S. proceeds to secondary sanctions on third-country actors.

6. National Security News piece (Jan 30, 2026) about Cuba oil-supply tariff mechanism  
Moderate reliability (niche outlet; describes an EO). Key factual claim: Trump signed EO enabling tariff-based penalties on countries supplying oil to Cuba. Relevant as a “revealed preference” that this administration will use quasi-secondary economic tools quickly—though not Russia-related.

AskNews article set (Jan 30–31, 2026):
7. Multiple EU-sanctions-package reports (Bloomberg-cited via various outlets; Jan 30–31, 2026)  
Moderate reliability as repeated Bloomberg-attributed claims (even if reprinted in RU/UKR outlets). Fact (if Bloomberg is accurate): EU considering a major tightening on maritime services for Russian oil and additional actions on shadow fleet / third-country facilitators around late Feb 2026. Relevance: increases odds the U.S. may coordinate or escalate, but these are EU actions, not direct evidence of U.S. secondary sanctions.

8. France24 explainer (Jan 31, 2026) claiming “U.S. imposed secondary sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil”  
Mixed: France24 is generally reliable, but that phrasing is ambiguous and may conflate (i) primary SDN designations with (ii) secondary-sanctions *risk* for third parties. I treat it as weak evidence for *new* secondary sanctions (it does not clearly state the U.S. designated non‑Russian parties or announced a new secondary sanctions program).

9. Other energy/business commentary (Newsmax, Investing.com, Newsbase, etc., Oct–Nov 2025)  
Variable reliability. Useful mainly for market/behavioral signals (buyers pausing, compliance chilling effect) and for indicating the policy conversation; weaker for adjudicating whether *new* secondary sanctions have been announced.

10. “Deep Research Analysis” block (undated within prompt; references Jan 2026 state)  
Not a primary source; appears to assert legislative momentum and Trump endorsement. Treat as hypothesis-generation, not as a firm fact basis unless corroborated by primary reporting.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Reminder: We need an official U.S. announcement of *new secondary sanctions* targeting *non-Russian* actors for Russian oil export facilitation.

Strong evidence
- OFAC/Treasury Dec 2025 release + Crowell legal analysis: the U.S. is emphasizing secondary-sanctions *exposure* for foreign financial institutions dealing with Rosneft/Lukoil, and the legal machinery exists to act quickly without Congress. This is a strong structural factor (capability + explicit signaling), though not itself “Yes” evidence.

Moderate evidence
- EU’s expected late-Feb 2026 escalation (multiple Bloomberg-cited stories): raises coordination/reciprocity odds. Historically, big EU moves sometimes coincide with U.S. follow-ons, and sanction-evasion enforcement often targets third-country shippers/insurers/banks. Still indirect: EU action doesn’t force U.S. action.
- CNN + identifiable expert commentary: clear articulation that secondary sanctions on third-country banks/refiners is the next step if the U.S. wants maximum impact—plausible causal mechanism.

Weak evidence
- Cuba EO (Jan 30, 2026): indicates willingness to deploy “secondary-like” tariff tools fast, but the target is Cuba, not Russia; transferability is uncertain.
- France24 phrasing about “secondary sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil”: likely definitional slippage; weak for the precise resolution criteria.
- Commentary outlets predicting imminent secondary sanctions: suggests salience, but timing/implementation is speculative.

Net: Evidence points to (1) high *capacity* and (2) a plausible near-term trigger (EU Feb package / ongoing enforcement needs), but still limited direct indication that the U.S. has decided to newly penalize non-Russian purchasers/financiers/insurers/shippers in the next ~3 months.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 90 days (2026-01-31 to 2026-05-01).

If timeframe were halved (~45 days): probability would drop meaningfully because new secondary sanctions (especially on major third-country banks/refiners) require interagency process, evidence packages, and political timing; I’d expect roughly ~0.6x the 90-day probability.

If timeframe were doubled (~180 days): probability would rise substantially because (i) enforcement cycles and (ii) potential Ukraine-war escalations have more time to generate a clear trigger; I’d expect roughly ~1.6–2.0x the 90-day probability (capped below 50% absent a clear policy pivot).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments vs outside view)
Outside-view base rate given: 7% (very low).

Key reasons to adjust upward from 7%:
1. Post–Oct 2025 policy posture: The U.S. has already crossed a major threshold by SDN’ing Rosneft/Lukoil and repeatedly foregrounding secondary-sanctions risk for foreign banks. Historically, when the U.S. moves from “threat” to “make examples,” it often does so via a small number of high-signal designations (e.g., a shipping network, a trader, or a bank). This makes a “new secondary sanctions” announcement within 90 days more plausible than the longer-run baseline that included long periods of restraint. (Moderate-to-strong upward.)
2. Coordination pressure around late Feb 2026: Multiple reports suggest the EU may adopt a materially tougher oil-transport-services regime around Feb 24, 2026. If that happens, U.S. follow-on enforcement targeting third-country facilitators becomes more likely (even if still not the modal outcome). (Moderate upward.)
3. Administration willingness to use secondary-like tools: The Cuba EO (tariff weapon) is not Russia-related, but it reduces my uncertainty about “will this White House use novel coercive tools quickly?”—answer appears to be “yes, when motivated.” (Weak-to-moderate upward.)

Key reasons not to move too high:
1. Resolution criteria are strict: It’s not enough that OFAC reiterates that secondary sanctions are possible; there must be a *new* measure explicitly targeting non-Russian parties for Russian oil trade. Many news accounts conflate “secondary sanctions risk” with “secondary sanctions imposed.” (Moderate downward.)
2. Trade/geopolitical blowback: True secondary sanctions on major China/India nodes would be a significant escalation with broader trade consequences; the U.S. may prefer continued deterrent threats and selective enforcement rather than announcing a clearly new secondary program in this short window. (Moderate downward.)
3. Status quo momentum: Since Oct 2025, the U.S. has (so far) leaned on the chilling effect without a clearly documented, headline “new secondary sanctions” package on third parties. In a 90-day window, inertia matters. (Moderate downward.)

Probability calibration
- Outside view anchor: 7%
- Adjustments:
  - +6%: elevated post–Oct 2025 likelihood of “example-setting” action on third-party facilitators (capability + signaling)
  - +4%: potential EU Feb 2026 escalation increasing coordination/enforcement pressure
  - +2%: demonstrated willingness to deploy secondary-like tools quickly (Cuba EO signal), modest portability
  - −1%: short window + definitional strictness risk (many actions won’t qualify)
Net inside view: 18%

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: By May 1, 2026, will U.S. announce *new* secondary sanctions penalizing non‑Russian third parties for Russian oil export transactions?  
2) Outside view base rate: 7%.  
3) Consistency: 18 out of 100 times, the U.S. announces qualifying new secondary sanctions on third parties for Russian oil before May 1, 2026.  
4) Top evidence:
   - OFAC explicitly highlights secondary-sanctions exposure for foreign FIs dealing with Rosneft/Lukoil.
   - EU likely to tighten Russian oil maritime-services regime around Feb 24, 2026 (coordination pressure).
   - U.S. has shown willingness to use novel “secondary-like” tariff tools quickly (Cuba EO).  
5) Blind spot: A sudden Ukraine escalation or a high-profile sanctions-evasion scandal could trigger rapid U.S. secondary designations—making 18% too low.  
6) Status quo outcome: Continued threats/deterrence without a clearly “new” secondary-sanctions announcement is still the most likely path in a 90-day window.

Probability: 18%
