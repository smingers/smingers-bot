Analysis:

A.  Source analysis (quality-weighted facts only)

1. FREE NETWORK brief (7 Dec 2025).  
   • Facts: Oct-Nov 2025 U.S. sanctioned Rosneft & Lukoil, secondary-sanction clause applies to foreign banks; market reaction figures.  
   • Reliability: Academic network, cites public price data; good for factual chronology.

2. Treasury press release (23 Dec 2025).  
   • Facts: Lists Rosneft/Lukoil as SDNs; warns FFIs they “may risk” secondary sanctions under existing authority.  
   • Reliability: Primary U.S.-government source—high.

3. Arnold & Porter memo (15 Oct 2025).  
   • Facts: Describes 22 Oct 2025 U.S. measures as primary; notes possibility, not imposition, of secondary sanctions.  
   • Reliability: Legal analysis, generally solid.

4. UNITED24 (11 Jul 2025) and Financial Post (Bloomberg pick-up).  
   • Facts: Trump “studying” 500 % tariff bill; none enacted.  
   • Reliability: One partisan Ukrainian outlet, one Bloomberg clip. Factual statements attributed to identifiable officials—usable with caution.

5. Bloomberg/Financial Post (undated Jan 2026) – quotes NATO ambassador on holding back China secondary sanctions.  
   • Facts: No new measures; tariffs on India only.  
   • Reliability: Bloomberg original, high.

6. France 24 (31 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: U.S. Rosneft/Lukoil sanctions already in force; describes revenue impact; no mention of new sanctions in pipeline.  
   • Reliability: International broadcaster, good for descriptive economics.

7. News feeds on prospective EU 20th sanctions package (multiple Jan 30-31 2026 articles).  
   • Facts: EU debating service ban & Kyrgyz evasion tool, to be decided by 24 Feb 2026; no U.S. action referenced.  
   • Reliability: Bloomberg/Reuters derivatives—medium-to-high.

8. Agent-report chronology.  
   • Facts: Lays out U.S. sanction steps 2022-Jan 2026; cites executive orders and OFAC docs; no evidence of pending secondary sanctions after Oct 2025.  
   • Reliability: Synthetic but source-backed; cross-checks with Treasury notices—good.

Opinion content appears mainly in analyst quotes about market impact; those are excluded from factual base.

B.  Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes:

1. “New U.S. Russia-oil secondary-sanctions announcements per calendar quarter since Feb 2022.”  
   • 3 events in 15 quarters → base quarterly rate ≈ 20%.

2. “Escalatory secondary-sanctions steps on major oil exporters (Iran 2010-13; Venezuela 2017-19) after a large designation of a state oil firm.”  
   • In both cases the U.S. waited ≥ 6 months before the next step. Quarterly rate inside the first 3 months ≈ 10-15%.

3. “Any new Russia sanctions package (primary or secondary) in a given 90-day window 2022-25.”  
   • Very frequent (≈ 60%), but over-broad—includes financial or technology, not oil. Not suitable.

We adopt reference class 2 because it mirrors the current situation: a very large oil-sector SDN action has just occurred (Oct 2025) and the question asks about whether an additional, separate *secondary* escalation on oil will follow inside three months.

C.  Time-frame analysis

Time remaining until resolution: 91 days (1 Feb – 30 Apr 2026 inclusive).

Historical pattern in chosen class: probability of a follow-on secondary-sanction package inside three months ≈ 12% (Iran: 0 of 3 instances; Venezuela: 1 follow-on at month 4).

D.  Justification for outside view

1. Recency of major step: The U.S. only three months ago applied its heaviest oil-related Russia sanctions yet; bureaucratic cadence (inter-agency development, inter-allied consultation, Federal Register publication) makes another *new* secondary-sanctions instrument inside the next 90 days mechanically unlikely.

2. Political signals:  
   • President Trump explicitly *threatens* tariffs and sanctions but has not moved forward despite pressure—suggests “wait-and-see” stance.  
   • Congress: the 500 % tariff bill is stalled; no alternative bipartisan bill scheduled for markup.

3. Market/ally coordination: EU is preparing its own February service ban. Washington tends to avoid parallel escalation while gauging allied effect; likelihood of letting Brussels move first is high.

4. Diminishing marginal returns: After designating companies that cover ~50 % of Russian output, the next incremental targets are banks/insurers in third countries—politically costlier and diplomatically sensitive (China, India). Outside-view odds therefore lower than long-run quarterly average.

5. Base-rate anchoring: Starting from 12 % (reference class), we nudge slightly upward to 15 % to reflect:  
   • Short window but presence of EU action could create band-wagon pressure.  
   • Trump’s proven willingness to act unpredictably.

Outside view calibration:

Base probability (reference class) ………………… 12 %  
+ EU possible February ban (coordination risk) … +2 %  
+ Trump volatility factor …………………………… +1 %  
Final outside-view estimate ……………………… 15 %  

Rounded to nearest 1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
15 %
