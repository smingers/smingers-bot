Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most recent first)

1. National Security News – 30 Jan 2026 – presidential EO creating tariff-based secondary-style penalties on countries that sell oil to Cuba.  
   • Fact: Trump shows willingness to reach beyond classic OFAC tools only 24 h ago.  
   • Opinion: “Novel application” labelled by reporters.  
   • Quality: Medium; niche outlet but EO text is publicly posted – verifiable.

2. Cascade of ~10 regional re-writes of the same 30-31 Jan 2026 Bloomberg wire on the EU’s forthcoming 20th package (Dialog.ua, NV.ua, inbusiness.kz, Radio Svoboda, Mail.ru, etc.).  
   • Fact: EU debating full services ban on Russian seaborne crude, target adoption 24 Feb 2026.  
   • Opinion: “Would make exports impossible” – projection.  
   • Quality: Medium; primary data ultimately from Bloomberg.

3. France 24 analytical piece – 31 Jan 2026 – summarises 2025 market impact of U.S. sanctions; claims secondary sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil already “imposed”.  
   • Factual part: Russian revenue down, Urals <$40.  
   • Quality: Medium; conflates threat and imposition – requires caution.

4. U.S. Treasury press release sb0290 – 23 Dec 2025 – designates Rosneft/Lukoil; explicitly warns foreign FIs they “may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions”.  
   • Pure primary source.  
   • Key: establishes that authority exists but was not yet exercised.

5. Crowell & Moring legal note – 28 Oct 2025 – details Oct sanctions, emphasises “threat” of secondary sanctions.  
   • High quality legal commentary; confirms none announced on third parties.

6. NewsMax, L’Express, Investing.com, etc. – Oct/Nov 2025 – describe same Oct 22 package; note 30-day wind-down, future possibility of secondary sanctions; mixed quality, largely consistent on facts.

7. Capitol-Hill tracker articles (BIPC, NatLawReview) – Dec 2025/Jan 2026 – list bills: “Sanctioning Russia Act 2025”, “STOP China and Russia Act 2025”, 84 Senate co-sponsors, Trump public endorsement.  
   • High (statutory text public).  
   • Provide explicit legislative pathway.

8. IMF report – 14 Oct 2025 – warns price risk if U.S. pursues secondary sanctions.  
   • Reliable macro source, but opinion not evidence of intent.

(b) Evidence analysis (graded)

Strong evidence
• Legislative momentum: bipartisan Senate bill already introduced, 84 co-sponsors, explicit secondary-sanctions language, presidential endorsement.  
• Institutional set-up: OFAC already possesses authority (Jan 10 2025 Determination + EO 14024 §1(a)(ii)) — only needs designation notice, not new law.

Moderate evidence
• EU poised for severe service ban on 24 Feb 2026 – structural alignment habitually accompanied by a parallel U.S. action.  
• Trump’s Cuba EO (30 Jan 2026) signals readiness to use extraterritorial economic coercion within weeks of signature.

Weak evidence
• Media comments claiming secondary sanctions are already in force (France 24) – factually incorrect; treated as noise.  
• Speculative pieces on 100 % tariffs proposal to G-7 (Sept 2025) – no current legislative track.

Net directional pull: modestly upward from outside-view base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window = 90 days (31 Jan – 1 May 2026).  
Halved (45 d): probability would drop roughly one-third because most “natural” announcement dates (24 Feb EU package; end-March FY26 omnibus) occur after mid-March.  
Doubled (180 d): probability would climb to ~60 % as legislative and executive calendars offer more bites at the apple.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

1. Reference-class base (outside view): 34 %.  
2. Up-adjust +6 %: very high congressional support plus presidential buy-in makes at least one secondary-sanctions clause likely to be enacted or triggered in next 90 d.  
3. Up-adjust +4 %: EU set to tighten oil services ban on 24 Feb – historic pattern (Iran 2011, Russia 2022) shows U.S. usually unveils complementary OFAC designations within ±7 d.  
4. Down-adjust –2 %: enforcement bandwidth in State/DoJ reportedly downsized; could slow new designations.  
5. Down-adjust –2 %: White House sensitivity to pump-price spikes; Urals already <$45 so political urgency somewhat lower.

Final inside-view estimate = 34 + 6 + 4 – 2 – 2 ≈ 40 – 41 %. Rounded: 42 %.

Probability calibration
I am 42 % confident that, between 31 Jan 2026 and 1 May 2026, the U.S. government will announce at least one new sanction that explicitly penalises non-Russian persons or entities for purchasing, financing, insuring, or transporting Russian crude or petroleum products (i.e., secondary sanctions).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “By 1 May 2026 will the U.S. announce secondary sanctions on third-party actors in Russian oil trade?”  
2. Outside view: 34 %.  
3. Consistency: “About 42 out of 100 times, yes” – coherent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) 84-senator bill with Trump backing; b) OFAC already holds authority; c) EU 20th package due 24 Feb; d) Trump’s Cuba EO shows appetite; e) past follow-on pattern (Iran 2011).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden de-escalation deal (ceasefire) prompts White House to freeze new measures. Would cut probability by ≥25 pts.  
6. Status-quo bias: inertia favours “no”, kept probability <50 %.

Probability: 42%
