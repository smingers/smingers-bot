Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (factual signal vs. opinion)

1. FREE NETWORK brief (Dec 2025): Factual chronicle of the Oct/Nov 2025 Rosneft-Lukoil package and its early market impact. Credible, uses exchange-listed price data and CREA revenue tracker. Contains little opinion.

2. US Treasury press release (23 Dec 2025): Primary legal document. Clarifies that the Rosneft-Lukoil designations were primary sanctions; the “may risk” language merely points to existing secondary-sanctions authorities. Pure fact.

3. Arnold & Porter client note (Oct 2025): Legal‐practice summary of the October actions. Accurate on mechanics; the “open possibility” of secondary sanctions is clearly labelled as conjecture.

4. UNITED24 Media (Jul 2025): Report on draft 500 % tariff bill. Mix of fact (bill exists) and analyst opinion (Hess). Possible pro-Ukrainian bias but facts cross-check.

5. Bloomberg/Financial Post (Aug 2025): Quotes US NATO ambassador on why China has not yet been hit with secondary sanctions. Credible mainstream source; statements attributable to named official.

6. Pay-walled FT headline (2025): Insufficient content—ignored for evidence.

7. Agent report (timeline 2022-Jan 2026): Synthetic but well-sourced chronology, citing Federal Register, OFAC notices, CREA, CEPA etc. Good factual spine.

8. Asknews compilation (31 Jan 2026): Batch of day-of-press items. They show (i) the EU—not the US—preparing a 20th package, and (ii) no fresh US movement in January 2026. Factual nuggets; opinions largely from unnamed “sources familiar”.

Overall factual take-aways:
• The US executed two large steps that exposed foreign actors to secondary sanctions in 2025 (Jan 2025 “energy-sector determination” and Oct 2025 Rosneft-Lukoil SDN listings).
• Since Oct 2025 nothing fresh has been announced; Treasury’s Dec 2025 note simply reiterated the October authority.
• Active public discussion of new US secondary sanctions (e.g., 500 % tariff bill) has stalled.

(b) Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes:
1. “Any new US secondary-sanctions program world-wide” (Iran 2010, DPRK 2016, Venezuela 2017, Russia 2023-25) ≈ 6–7 events in 16 years → base rate ≈ 0.40 events / yr → 10 % in any random 90-day window.  
2. “New US secondary sanctions targeting crude-oil trade” (Iran 2010, 2011, 2013; Russia Jan 2025, Oct 2025) = 5 events in 16 years → 0.31 / yr → 7.5 % per 90 days.  
3. “New US secondary sanctions on Russia since Feb 2022” (Dec 2023 EO 14114; Jan 2025 determination; Oct 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil) = 3 events in 3 yrs → 1 / yr → 25 % per 90 days.

Class #3 is closest to the question (same target, same policy arena) and captures the current high-tempo environment, so we adopt it. Raw base-rate: 25 % for any given quarter.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time remaining to resolution: 90 days (1 Feb – 30 Apr 2026).  
Historical spacing of Russia-oil secondary-sanctions steps: Jan 2025 → Oct 2025 (≈ 9 mo); Oct 2025 → now (3 mo and counting). No instance yet of two packages falling within three months.

(d) Justification for outside-view figure

Starting from the 25 % quarterly base-rate (class #3) we apply generic, not case-specific, adjustments:

• Regression toward longer-term average (classes #1–2 average ≈ 8–10 %).  Half-weighting recent and long-term rates gives (25 + 10)/2 ≈ 17.5 %.  
• Calendar seasonality: Big Russia measures in 2025 both arrived in Q4, historically linked to EU anniversaries and budget cycles. Q1 historically quieter. Minor downward tweak: –2 pp.  
• Diminishing-returns logic: two escalations already inside 15 months; probability of a third so soon slightly lower than naïve frequency. –3 pp.

17.5 % – 2 % – 3 % = 12.5 %, rounded to 13 %.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor on 25 % (recent Russia-specific base rate) and blend in multi-cycle averages and generic spacing effects, leading to a calibrated outside-view probability of roughly 13 %. 95 % confidence interval on this outside-view estimate is wide (±8 pp) because of the small-N reference class.

Outside View Prediction:
13 % chance that the U.S. will announce new secondary sanctions related to Russian oil exports before 1 May 2026.
