Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

1. US Treasury press release (23 Dec 2025) – primary-source document; confirms only primary sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil plus a standing “may risk” warning to foreign banks. 100 % factual.  
2. Crowell & Moring legal note (28 Oct 2025) – reputable law-firm brief; factually distinguishes primary designations from mere threat of secondary sanctions.  
3. CNN report (22 Oct 2025) – mainstream U.S. outlet; quotes Treasury Secretary that measures are “sanctions, not secondary tariffs.” Good factual value, minimal opinion.  
4. Arnold & Porter client alert (Jan 2026, NatLawReview) – accurate legal summary; notes that secondary sanctions “may apply” but none announced yet.  
5. Bipartisan “Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025” coverage (The Politics of Oil article, Oct 2025) – identifies bills that would mandate secondary sanctions/tariffs; one identifiable bill number, bipartisan sponsors; still pending. Moderate reliability, forward-looking.  
6. National Security News (30 Jan 2026) – factual EO on Cuba introducing tariff-style secondary measures; shows presidential willingness to innovate on sanctions.  
7. Asknews batch (31 Jan 2026) – largely EU-focused Bloomberg leaks; reliable on EU plans, but only indirectly relevant to U.S. action.  
8. Deep-research summary (inside the prompt) – compiled analysis, mixes fact and inference; useful for legislative head-count but not an independent source.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Raising probability  
• Moderate: Bipartisan bills in Congress (84 co-sponsors reported) explicitly mandate secondary sanctions/tariffs on countries buying Russian oil. (Single, identifiable source; legislation in motion.)  
• Moderate: President Trump’s public endorsement of such bills and his signature of a Cuba EO using a tariff-based secondary tool 24 h ago – signals executive receptivity.  
• Moderate: Likely sanctions “moment” on 24 Feb 2026 (four-year war anniversary) when EU will unveil its 20th package; U.S. historically synchronises big Russia moves with allies (Feb 2022, Dec 2023, Oct 2025).  
• Weak-to-moderate: Oil prices subdued (Urals ≈ $41) and supply ample, lowering domestic political cost of tougher action.

Lowering probability  
• Strong: No U.S. secondary designations yet despite having the authority since Jan 2025; three months have passed since last escalation.  
• Moderate: India and China are key diplomatic partners; Treasury has so far preferred “deterrent language” over enforcement to avoid confrontation.  
• Moderate: Sanctions-coordination staff cuts inside State/Justice (L’Express, Oct 2025) may slow complex secondary actions.  
• Weak: Election cycle pressure currently low (mid-term still 10 months away); urgency for symbolic measures less acute.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 90.  If the window were cut to 45 days I would drop probability about 5 pp (fewer legislative days, less prep time).  If doubled to 180 days I would raise probability ~10 pp (more time for bill passage or OFAC designations).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view quarterly base rate for new Russia-oil secondary sanctions: 13 %.  

Upward adjustments (+)  
+4 pp   Legislative momentum (bipartisan bill at committee stage; Senate leadership signalling vote “this spring”).  
+3 pp   Executive signalling (Cuba EO, Trump quote) and low oil-price cushion.  
+2 pp   Anticipated allied move on 24 Feb prompting U.S. to “match”.  

Downward adjustments (–)  
–3 pp   Past pattern of U.S. withholding actual secondary designations to preserve leverage.  
–1 pp   Bureaucratic capacity concerns.  

Net shift: +5 pp → 18 % rounded.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 18 out of 100 times, between now (31 Jan 2026) and 1 May 2026, the U.S. would announce a new set of secondary sanctions that explicitly targets non-Russian actors for purchasing/financing/insuring/transporting Russian oil.

Checklist:
1. Resolves “Yes” if before 1 May 2026 the U.S. officially announces secondary sanctions on third-party actors linked to Russian oil.  
2. Outside-view base rate: 13 %.  
3. Sanity check: “18/100 times a new U.S. secondary-sanctions package appears in a 90-day window” feels plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) bipartisan bill with 84 sponsors; b) Trump backs it & just used similar tool on Cuba; c) EU 20th package due 24 Feb; d) none announced despite authority.  
5. Blind spot: sudden Russia-Ukraine cease-fire deal prompting sanctions pause could drop probability below 5 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: No move is still the default; forecast remains below 1-in-5.

Probability: 18%
