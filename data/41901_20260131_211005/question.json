    "description": "Following unsuccessful U.S.-Russia talks regarding Ukraine in December 2025, the U.S. is weighing new actions concerning Russian oil. Previous threats included tariffs on nations buying Russian oil if no peace deal was reached. Sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil took effect in November 2025, adding pressure on importers like India and China. The question is whether the U.S. will now impose secondary sanctions targeting those who continue to facilitate Russian oil exports\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"f88e394d7b56227e\",\"sheet_id\":99}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This resolves as \"Yes\" if the U.S. government announces new sanctions that explicitly target non-Russian persons, entities, or countries for their role in purchasing, financing, insuring, or transporting Russian crude oil or petroleum products. The announcement must be made by an official body of the U.S. government, such as the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (see for example OFAC's [Recent Actions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions) portal, the White House, or through enacted legislation. Renewals or expansions of existing primary sanctions against Russian entities do not count. The new measures must be secondary in nature, penalizing third parties for engaging with Russia's energy sector.",
