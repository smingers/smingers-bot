Analysis:
The market-moving fact we are looking for is any U-S GOVERNMENT announcement—White House, OFAC, State, Congress—that threatens or enacts penalties on non-Russian parties for buying, financing, insuring, transporting, or otherwise facilitating Russian crude or refined products. Key things to watch in the latest coverage:

• Whether the Biden administration has moved from “considering” to “announcing” secondary sanctions in the wake of the failed December 2025 talks.  
• Congressional initiatives (e.g., bipartisan bills mandating secondary energy sanctions) that might have been introduced in January 2026.  
• OFAC’s “Recent Actions” releases since mid-December 2025 for any new determinations or executive orders aimed at third-country entities (especially Indian, Chinese, Emirati, Turkish or Greek shippers, traders and insurers).  
• Statements by senior Treasury officials (e.g., Deputy Secretary Adeyemo) or State Department Envoy for Energy Security on expanded enforcement.  
• Coverage in energy-focused outlets (Argus, Platts), Russian press, and Indian or Chinese business papers that often pick up early warnings sent through U.S. diplomatic channels.  
If no such official action exists yet, the best articles will instead describe 1) ongoing internal administration debates, 2) draft legislative text, or 3) foreign governments’ contingency planning—all useful leading indicators for forecasters.
