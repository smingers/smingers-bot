Analysis:
The forecast hinges on how often the United States has actually moved from threatening to imposing secondary sanctions on third-party buyers of Russian crude. To judge the plausibility of a new move between now and May 2026 it helps to know:  
• Whether the U.S. has ever imposed true secondary sanctions on Russian oil before (or has only talked about them).  
• What exactly was announced in November 2025 re: Rosneft/Lukoil and whether that step already targeted non-Russian actors or merely tightened primary sanctions.  
• Precedents in other sanction regimes (e.g., Iran) that illustrate the mechanics and political triggers for secondary measures.  
Therefore the historical context we need is a timeline of U.S. energy-related sanctions on Russia since 2022, with special attention to any earlier secondary provisions, key threats issued in 2025 after the stalled Ukraine talks, and how OFAC usually publicizes such actions.
