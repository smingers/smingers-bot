You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the U.S. impose new secondary sanctions related to Russian oil exports before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Following unsuccessful U.S.-Russia talks regarding Ukraine in December 2025, the U.S. is weighing new actions concerning Russian oil. Previous threats included tariffs on nations buying Russian oil if no peace deal was reached. Sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil took effect in November 2025, adding pressure on importers like India and China. The question is whether the U.S. will now impose secondary sanctions targeting those who continue to facilitate Russian oil exports

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This resolves as "Yes" if the U.S. government announces new sanctions that explicitly target non-Russian persons, entities, or countries for their role in purchasing, financing, insuring, or transporting Russian crude oil or petroleum products. The announcement must be made by an official body of the U.S. government, such as the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (see for example OFAC's [Recent Actions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions) portal, the White House, or through enacted legislation. Renewals or expansions of existing primary sanctions against Russian entities do not count. The new measures must be secondary in nature, penalizing third parties for engaging with Russia's energy sector.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
