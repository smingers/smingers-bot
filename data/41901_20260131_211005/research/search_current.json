Secretary of Commerce determines if a foreign country sells/provides oil to Cuba\n  2. Secretary of State (consulting with Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and USTR) recommends whether to impose duties and at what rate\n  3.

According to the Brookings Institution, exports from several EU countries to Kyrgyzstan have surged dramatically: Estonia\u2019s exports rose by 10,000%, Finland\u2019s by 3,100%, Poland\u2019s and Greece\u2019s by 2,200% and 2,100% respectively, while exports from Norway, the UK, Germany, and the Czech Republic increased by over 1,000%. Economist Robin Brooks of Brookings Institution stated that Kyrgyzstan has become a de facto major destination for European exports that end up in Russia. In response, the EU has already added two Kyrgyz banks\u2014'Tolubay' and Eurasian Savings Bank\u2014to its sanctions list in October 2025, and in February 2025, 'Keremet Bank' was sanctioned by the UK, having previously been listed by the US. The EU plans to finalize the 20th package of sanctions against Russia on February 24, 2026, which may include restrictions on services critical for the maritime transport of Russian oil. These measures are part of broader efforts to counter evasion of sanctions on Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:39 AM\nSource:[inbusiness.kz](https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/evrosoyuz-dumaet-o-sankciyah-protiv-soseda-kazahstana)\n\n**EU Preparing Stricter Measures Against Russian Oil \u2013 Bloomberg**\nThe European Union is discussing more stringent measures against Russian oil exports, potentially replacing the current price cap mechanism with a full ban on maritime services related to the transport of Russian crude oil. According to Bloomberg, the proposed restrictions would prohibit EU-based companies from providing services such as insurance, freight, and shipping, which are essential for sea-based oil exports. If adopted by all EU member states, this measure would make Russian oil exports by sea effectively impossible regardless of price. Sources indicate the change would simplify sanctions enforcement and increase their effectiveness. The current price cap, set at $44.10 per barrel since February 1, 2026, is calculated as 15% below the average market price of Urals crude and is reviewed every six months. EU officials believe the existing mechanism is administratively complex and inconsistently effective. Member states have been briefed on the potential content of the 20th sanctions package against Russia, with the EU aiming to adopt it by the end of February 2026. However, consensus is required, and several capitals have expressed reservations about replacing the price cap with a total service ban. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly offered record discounts on oil to India, selling its crude at prices comparable to those from 25 years ago.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 07:48 AM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/business/327978_1769845103)\n\n**Are the West's tightening oil sanctions finally taking their toll on Russia's economy?**\nRussian oil and gas revenue fell by a fifth in 2025 to its lowest level in five years, driven by a combination of global oil oversupply, a strong rouble, and increasingly stringent Western sanctions. The United States, under President Donald Trump, imposed secondary sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil\u2014Russia\u2019s two largest oil exporters\u2014and expanded them to cover four-fifths of Russia\u2019s oil production. These measures have forced Russia to sell crude at steep discounts, with Urals crude falling below $40 a barrel in December, its lowest since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The price cap on Russian seaborne oil exports, initially set at $60 a barrel and set to fall to under $44 by February 2026, has driven a wedge between global oil prices and what Russia receives. As a result, Russia has increasingly relied on a 'shadow fleet' of aging, often unregistered tankers to transport oil, prompting increased enforcement by France and other Western nations, including ship seizures and detentions. Buyers in India and China, previously eager to purchase discounted Russian crude, have become more cautious\u2014India reduced volumes and China demanded higher discounts. Lukoil has agreed to sell $22 billion in overseas assets, excluding those in Kazakhstan, to the Carlyle Group, a move likely to boost Russia\u2019s foreign reserves but reduce long-term oil and gas profits. The declining revenue has strained the Russian budget: oil and gas accounted for less than 23% of federal revenue by the end of 2025, the lowest in 20 years, contributing to a 2.6% GDP deficit. To compensate, Russia has raised VAT to 22% and cut social spending from 38% in 2021 to 25% in 2026. Despite economic pressures, including high interest rates and slowing growth, analysts such as Alexander Kolyandr and Daniel Spiro argue that these measures are unlikely to alter President Putin\u2019s determination to continue the war in Ukraine, as geopolitical goals remain prioritized over economic stability. According to Catherine Wolfram of MIT, the current situation reflects a 'cat-and-mouse game' where sanctions are forcing Russia to make short-term financial sacrifices\u2014such as selling assets at a discount\u2014while attempting to sustain its war effort.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:56 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-are-the-west-tightening-oil-sanctions-finally-taking-toll-russia-economy)\n\n**EU Prepares 20th Sanctions Package Targeting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector, Banks, Shadow Fleet, and Evasion Schemes**\nThe European Union is preparing its 20th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to intensify pressure on Moscow's oil revenues and expand restrictions on banks, Russia's shadow fleet, and schemes to circumvent sanctions. According to Bloomberg, if approved, the package could ban European companies from providing critical services\u2014such as insurance and transportation\u2014for the export of Russian oil regardless of its value. This full ban would significantly strengthen existing oil restrictions and simplify enforcement. The European Commission has not commented. The proposed measures also include new limitations on Russian banks, oil companies, cryptocurrency services, and financial institutions in third countries aiding Russia\u2019s evasion efforts, along with an expanded list of shadow fleet vessels. For the first time, the EU may invoke a mechanism to counter sanctions evasion by banning exports of certain machinery and radio equipment to Kyrgyzstan, a transit route used for supplying goods to Russia. The package also proposes new trade restrictions on additional companies and goods essential for Russia\u2019s weapons production, as well as reduced imports of specific Russian metals. High-level EU official Kaja Kallas stated on January 29, 2026, that the 20th package is expected to be adopted on February 24, 2026, though consensus among member states has not yet been reached. The European Council\u2019s conclusion from December 18, 2025, indicated that the 20th package would be adopted at the beginning of 2026. On December 18, 2025, the EU had already imposed sanctions restricting 41 vessels linked to Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, including oil tankers generating revenue for Russia\u2019s energy sector.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:54 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/world/geopolitics/20-y-paket-sankciy-yes-planuyetsya-zaprovaditi-novi-obmezhennya-na-naftu-banki-ta-tinoviy-flot-rf-50579920.html)\n\n**EU Preparing 20th Sanctions Package Targeting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector, Banks, Shadow Fleet, and Sanctions Evasion Mechanisms**\nThe European Union is preparing its 20th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting the country's oil sector, banks, shadow fleet, and evasion schemes.

The proposed restrictions, expected to be approved by the end of February 2026, would prohibit EU companies from providing these essential services, effectively blocking sea shipments of Russian oil. The current price cap, set at $44.10 per barrel as of February 1, 2026, is established at 15% below the average market price of Urals crude and is reviewed every six months. Some EU member states have expressed opposition to abandoning the price cap in favor of a full service ban. The new package may also include restrictions on Russian banks, oil companies, cryptocurrency services, and financial institutions in third countries aiding sanctions evasion. Additional measures could target Russia\u2019s so-called 'shadow fleet' and introduce export controls on machinery and electronic equipment to Kyrgyzstan. The EU may also impose new trade restrictions on companies and goods used in Russian military production, as well as limit imports of certain Russian metals. Since the introduction of the price cap in December 2022, Russian oil prices have dropped to $41.73 per barrel\u2014close to early 2000s levels\u2014well below Russia\u2019s 2026 budget assumption of $59 per barrel. According to Reuters, Russia\u2019s federal budget missed one-fifth of its oil and gas revenues from January to November 2025, with a 49% year-on-year decline in December. India has reduced Russian oil purchases by 28%, and Turkish refineries are increasingly sourcing Kazakh oil instead.

If approved by all EU member states, European companies could be prohibited from providing essential services such as insurance and maritime transport for Russian oil, regardless of price. This proposal, previously discussed with the G7 in December, is expected to be finalized by the end of February 2026, pending unanimous support. However, some member states have already signaled opposition to replacing the price cap with service restrictions. The proposed 20th sanctions package may also include new measures targeting Russian banks, oil companies, cryptocurrency services, and financial institutions in third countries suspected of aiding sanctions evasion. Additionally, restrictions could be extended to new vessels classified as part of Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet. The EU is also considering using its new sanctions evasion countermeasure tool for the first time\u2014prohibiting exports to Kyrgyzstan of certain machine tools and radio equipment. The package includes expanded trade restrictions on dual-use goods and new sanctions on imports of Russian metals. The EU originally introduced a price cap on Russian crude oil due to ongoing military actions in Ukraine, with the cap set at $44.1 per barrel starting 1 February 2026. The previous caps were $100 per barrel for diesel and $45 for fuel oil. Russia has responded with retaliatory measures, including a ban on oil and petroleum product exports under contracts tied to the price cap, extended until 30 June 2026.

The announcement was reported on January 30, 2026, by PRIME.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:17 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20260130/sanktsii-867061576.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Emergency Declaration: Imposing Tariffs on Countries Supplying Oil to Cuba**\nOn January 30, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency regarding Cuba, authorizing Washington to impose secondary tariffs on countries that directly or indirectly supply oil to Cuba. According to the White House- published order, Cuba poses an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to U.S. national security by collaborating with 'numerous hostile countries, transnational terrorist groups, and malicious actors,' including Russia, China, Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The order cites Cuba as hosting the largest foreign Russian electronic intelligence facility, which attempts to steal confidential U.S. national security information, and notes ongoing deepening defense and intelligence cooperation between Cuba and China. Secondary tariffs will be applied to goods from nations that supply oil to Cuba, with final decisions on tariff implementation to be made by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State. This follows a similar bill introduced by U.S. senators last year targeting Russia. According to media reports, Trump is prepared to sign additional sanctions against Russia if he retains final authority over such measures.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:56 AM\nSource:[\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2026/01/30/7230123/)\n\n**US Sanctions Targeting Russia's Oil Giants Heighten Biz Risks**\nOn October 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Rosneft Oil Co. and Lukoil OAO, two of Russia\u2019s largest oil companies, under Executive Order No. 14024, which authorizes blocking property of persons operating in key sectors of the Russian economy, including energy. As a result, all U.S. property and interests in property of these entities are blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them unless authorized. Subsidiaries in which Rosneft, Lukoil, or other blocked persons hold 50% or more ownership are automatically blocked under OFAC\u2019s 50% rule. Export controls now require a license for any items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to be exported or reexported to these entities due to a presumption of denial. Secondary sanctions may apply to non-U.S. persons engaging in significant transactions with them or providing material support. The U.S. action followed similar sanctions by the U.K. and the EU\u2019s 19th round of sanctions, which include a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports and further restrictions on Rosneft. OFAC issued temporary general licenses allowing certain activities, including maintenance of operations and contract negotiations (but not execution) for entities owned by Lukoil International GmbH until January 17, 2026, with actual sales requiring specific authorization. Rosneft and Lukoil together account for roughly half of Russia\u2019s oil production and a major share of its seaborne exports, making these sanctions a critical blow to Russia\u2019s energy revenue. Prior to the sanctions, Russia\u2019s oil and gas revenues had already declined by 21% in the first 10 months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Third-country importers\u2014such as India, China, and certain EU states\u2014face reputational, financial, and potential secondary sanction risks by continuing to import from these companies; reports indicate Chinese and Indian importers have already reduced or suspended purchases. U.S. companies with exposure to Rosneft or Lukoil must wind down such activities except where authorized by general licenses. Non-U.S. entities in the energy sector must review operations for any ties to these companies, as even indirect involvement may trigger U.S. jurisdiction\u2014especially through U.S. financial institutions or transactions. Financial institutions and businesses globally face potential sanctions for maintaining relationships with these entities. Section 744.8 of the EAR mandates a license for exports of any item subject to U.S. export controls to Rosneft or Lukoil, regardless of origin, if the item contains controlled U.S. content or is a product of U.S. technology. The previously adopted but suspended affiliates rule\u2014restricting exports to foreign affiliates with 50%+ ownership by sanctioned entities\u2014was suspended by the U.S. Department of Commerce on November 10, 2025, through November 9, 2026, but exporters should prepare for its potential reinstatement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 01:22 AM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/us-sanctions-targeting-russias-oil-giants-heighten-biz-risks)\n\n**US Sanctions Threaten to Cripple Russia's Shadow Oil Fleet**\nThe United States is preparing to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, marking the first direct targeting of Russian oil exports by Washington, as reported by NewsMax on November 4, 2025. The sanctions, set to take effect later that month, threaten secondary penalties on banks and financial institutions facilitating payments for Russian crude, a move analysts say could severely disrupt Moscow's global trade. Maritime intelligence firm Windward AI reported a 510% increase in GPS-jamming incidents since January and over 1,000 ships currently operating under false flags\u2014key indicators of evasion efforts. These vessels form part of Russia\u2019s 'shadow fleet,' consisting of hundreds of older tankers that conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters\u2014off Cyprus, near the Suez Canal, and off Oman\u2014to conceal the origin of oil before delivering it to buyers in India, China, and Turkey. While the U.K. and EU have expanded their blacklists to include over 1,000 vessels, the Trump administration had previously refrained from new designations, allowing some Russian-linked ships to operate freely. Data from Kpler shows U.S.-sanctioned vessels experience a 74% drop in activity, compared to 31% for those sanctioned by the U.K. or EU. As a result, major Indian refineries and Chinese state oil firms have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil due to compliance risks. Analysts warn that if the U.S. enforces secondary sanctions, it could paralyze half of Russia\u2019s oil export system. With oil prices stable and global supply abundant, Washington appears willing to test the limits of pressure on Moscow\u2019s wartime economy without destabilizing markets. According to Kimberly Donovan of the Atlantic Council, 'If the U.S. follows through on secondary sanctions, it could paralyze half of Russia's oil export system.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/russia-sanctions-oil/2025/11/04/id/1233188/)\n\n**India should halt Russian oil imports, press US to withdraw punitive tariffs: GTRI**\nThe Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has urged India to halt imports from sanctioned Russian oil firms, press the United States to withdraw the 25% 'Russian oil' tariff imposed on Indian exports, and resume bilateral trade talks only on fair and equitable terms. According to GTRI, ending these imports would prevent exposure to secondary sanctions and allow India to demand tariff removal. The 25% tariff, introduced on July 31, 2024, has doubled total duties on Indian exports to 50%, contributing to a 37% decline in shipments between May and September 2024. GTRI warns that secondary sanctions could restrict access to critical infrastructure such as SWIFT, freeze dollar transactions, and disrupt digital services used by refineries, ports, and banks. The think tank also recommends that India seek parity with key partners like the European Union by targeting average industrial tariffs of around 15% and securing duty-free access for priority sectors including textiles, gems and jewellery, and pharmaceuticals. Removing the 'Russian oil' tariff would reduce India\u2019s overall US duty burden from 50% to 25%, restoring export competitiveness. This call follows the US October 22 sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, which account for 57% of Russia\u2019s crude output, and comes amid reports that India and the US were 'very near' to finalizing the first tranche of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) on October 24, 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:58 AM\nSource:[ETEnergyworld.com](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/india-urged-to-halt-russian-oil-imports-and-negotiate-tariff-withdrawal-with-us/125012021)\n\n**Secondary sanctions on China, India key to US efforts to clamp down on Russian oil exports**\nThe United States imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and LUKoil on October 22, 2025, blocking their access to the US financial system and threatening secondary sanctions against third-party countries or companies conducting business with them. These measures aim to restrict Russia\u2019s access to foreign currency and cut off energy revenues funding its war in Ukraine. The sanctions have disrupted global energy markets and prompted major Chinese importers, including state-owned firms PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC, and Zhenhua Oil, to temporarily suspend seaborne purchases of Russian crude linked to the sanctioned entities. China, which has become one of Russia\u2019s largest oil buyers since 2022, imported approximately 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude in the first nine months of 2025\u2014accounting for about a fifth of its total imports. To mitigate supply risks, China has stockpiled an estimated 1.25 billion barrels of oil, with projections indicating this could rise to 1.5 billion by 2026. Pipeline deliveries under a long-term contract between Rosneft and China National Petroleum Corporation, totaling about 900,000 bpd, are expected to continue, though they may face scrutiny if sanctions expand. Moscow is likely to rely more on its 'shadow fleet' of aging tankers operating under opaque ownership to maintain exports. China has publicly condemned the US actions as unilateral and legally unfounded, while also protesting EU penalties on two Chinese refiners. The US faces a delicate balancing act: enforcing sanctions to maintain credibility without provoking a broader confrontation with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Analysts predict Washington will target high-profile cases to signal resolve while leaving room for diplomatic flexibility if Russia signals willingness to negotiate on Ukraine. In the short term, China\u2019s strategic reserves and past experience with sanctions (e.g., on Iran) allow it to absorb the disruption, but in the long term, Beijing must navigate energy security and economic interests without triggering Western punitive measures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:51 AM\nSource:[Newsbase](https://newsbase.com/story/secondary-sanctions-on-china-india-key-to-us-efforts-to-clamp-down-on-russian-oil-exports-408209)\n\n**Crude Oil: US Sanctions on Russian Exports Threaten to Reroute Millions of Barrels | Investing.com**\nThe U.S. has imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, disrupting a critical flow of over three million barrels per day from Siberia to South Asia. Unlike the 2022 sanctions, this round is more targeted and consequential, signaling a broader message to global traders, shippers, and refiners in markets such as Mumbai and Istanbul. The threat of secondary sanctions\u2014penalties for those engaging with sanctioned entities\u2014has already triggered market anxiety, prompting voluntary rerouting of tankers even before enforcement begins. While China\u2019s major refiners (PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC) have publicly stepped back from seaborne Russian crude, independent 'teapot' refiners in Shandong continue to access discounted backdoor cargoes, and pipeline oil remains unaffected. India, reliant on cheap Russian crude for its refining boom, faces a geopolitical dilemma: maintaining supply while avoiding U.S. backlash, likely through creative use of ship registries and insurance routes. Enforcement remains a challenge, as the 'shadow fleet'\u2014sanctioned tankers with deactivated transponders\u2014continues to transport millions of barrels daily, evading detection despite efforts by Europe and the U.K. Even partial disruption, such as the potential removal of two million barrels from the open market, could drive Brent crude prices upward, especially given thin inventories and OPEC+'s reluctance to increase output. The sanctions are not just punitive but strategic: the U.S. aims to reshape global oil power dynamics, leveraging its status as the world\u2019s top producer and most aggressive regulator. This dual role\u2014market sheriff and speculator\u2014creates a paradoxical environment where transparency erodes, premiums rise, and traders adept at navigating sanctions' gray zones stand to profit. As Brent fluctuates around mid-$60s, the key question is not whether the sanctions will work, but what kind of market they will leave behind: a darker, thinner, and more opaque one where barrels hide, risk premiums soar, and the rule of law in energy trade becomes increasingly ambiguous.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 08:59 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-oil-us-sanctions-on-russian-exports-threaten-to-reroute-millions-of-barrels-200669024)\n\n**Trump\u2019s New Oil Sanctions on Russia: Why the Real Test Begins Now**\nOn October 22, 2025, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, which together account for 55% of Russia\u2019s oil production. This marks the first time Trump has authorized sanctions against Moscow since his return to the White House in January 2025, contrasting with the 140 sanction packages issued by his predecessor over three years of war. The sanctions target 34 subsidiaries of the two firms and include secondary sanctions, threatening financial institutions that facilitate transactions with the designated companies\u2014giving them until November 21 to comply or face exclusion from the U.S. financial system. This move is aimed at disrupting Russia\u2019s ability to circumvent Western restrictions, particularly through offshore 'ghost fleets' and shadow trade networks. Economists like Elina Ribakova of Bruegel note that targeting foreign banks is the most effective way to enforce sanctions. As a result, several Indian and Chinese refineries have already suspended Russian oil imports. The market reacted with a 5.6% spike in Brent crude prices, reaching over $66 per barrel, though analysts expect this to be short-lived. Experts emphasize that while Russia has adapted to sanctions since 2022\u2014relying on oil exports for 30\u201350% of its budget\u2014its ability to sustain exports depends on new pricing discounts and alternative shipping routes. However, challenges remain: U.S. sanctions enforcement has been weakened since Trump\u2019s inauguration, with key departments like the State Department\u2019s sanctions coordination unit and Justice Department\u2019s financial oversight units dismantled or downsized. Only the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) remains fully operational. As Ribakova cautions, real impact will depend on consistent enforcement, not just announcements. The true test of these sanctions lies ahead, in their implementation and global compliance.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 08:20 AM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https://www.lexpress.fr/monde/amerique/sanctions-de-donald-trump-sur-le-petrole-russe-pourquoi-le-vrai-test-commence-maintenant-5TNYSEANIRDNRKL4SNFIRR4QKU/)\n\n**IMF Warns of Global Oil Market Disruptions from Potential U.S. Secondary Sanctions on Russian Exports**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that potential secondary U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports could disrupt global supply chains, posing a significant risk of driving up energy prices. According to the IMF's report released on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, 'potential disruptions in Russian supplies represent a risk that cannot be ignored and could lead to price increases.' The warning comes amid U.S. threats to impose 100% tariffs on Russian goods and secondary sanctions on countries importing Russian oil, unless a ceasefire agreement is reached between Moscow and Kyiv. Despite these risks, the IMF projected a 12.9% decline in the average oil price in 2025, falling to $68.92 per barrel from $79.17 in 2024, with an additional 4.5% drop expected in 2026, bringing the price down to $65.84 per barrel.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 02:43 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/business/1720679-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7/)\n\n**US Urges G7 to Impose Secondary Sanctions on China and India and Seize Frozen Russian Assets**\nBloomberg and UNN report that the United States will ask its G7 allies to impose tariffs of up to 100\u202f% on China and India for purchases of Russian oil, in an effort to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

Legislative Activity: Multiple bills proposing secondary sanctions on Russian oil exports have been introduced in the U.S. Congress. The most prominent one, co-sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, proposes a 500% tariff on goods from countries that purchase Russian oil, petroleum products, or uranium [11][12][13][14][15][16]. As of January 2026, this bill has strong bipartisan support (with 84 senators backing it) and is under active consideration in the Senate.\n\n2. Presidential Endorsement: President Donald Trump has publicly endorsed the bill, stating, \"I support it. I hope we don't have to use it\" [14][15]. This indicates executive branch approval, which is critical for enactment.\n\n3. Timeline: The legislative process began in earnest in late 2025. Senator Graham announced in November 2025 that the U.S. Congress, with President Trump's approval, had started the process to pass these sanctions [17][19][20]. The bill was formally introduced to the Senate in early January 2026 [16], leaving ample time (until May 1, 2026) for passage and implementation.\n\nHowever, there is a note of caution: \n- The bill has faced delays in the past, partly due to President Trump's desire to retain personal authority over sanctions policy [11][12]. \n- Trump's statement also suggests he might not enforce the sanctions if he deems it unnecessary.\n\nGiven the strong bipartisan backing and the advanced stage of the legislative process, the odds of these secondary sanctions being imposed by May 1, 2026, appear high. But we should acknowledge that unforeseen political developments could alter this trajectory.\n\nIn summary, based on current legislative momentum and executive support, we can expect new U.S. secondary sanctions on Russian oil exports to be imposed before May 1, 2026.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
