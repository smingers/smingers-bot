## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **UK CPI trajectory from previous inflation peaks (2011, 2022-2023):**
   - 2011 peak: ~5.2% (September 2011), fell to ~2.7% by March 2012 (6 months)
   - 2022-2023 peak: ~11.1% (October 2022), fell to ~3.2% by March 2024 (17 months)
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Different underlying causes (energy shocks vs post-pandemic)

2. **Recent UK CPI monthly changes (2025):**
   - Peaked at 3.8% (August-September 2025)
   - Fell to 3.2% (November 2025)
   - Rose to 3.4% (December 2025)
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most recent data showing actual trajectory toward target

3. **BoE/OBR forecast accuracy for 3-6 month horizons:**
   - Central banks typically have reasonable accuracy for near-term forecasts (1-2 quarters)
   - Suitability: HIGH - March 2026 is only 2 months away, within high-confidence forecast horizon

4. **Seasonal CPI patterns in UK:**
   - January often sees increases (post-holiday adjustments, utility price changes)
   - March typically more stable
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Relevant for monthly volatility but less so for trend

**Selected Reference Class:** Recent UK CPI trajectory (2025) combined with BoE/OBR near-term forecasts, given the short timeframe and availability of authoritative institutional projections.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 1, 2026
- Target: March 2026 CPI (released mid-April 2026)
- Horizon: ~2 months from now

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

Recent trajectory (August 2025 to January 2026):
- August-September 2025: 3.8% (peak)
- November 2025: 3.2% (decline of 0.6pp over 2 months)
- December 2025: 3.4% (increase of 0.2pp in 1 month)
- January 2026: ~3.2% (implied from Guardian article)

This shows:
- Clear downward trend from peak
- Monthly volatility (±0.2pp)
- Deceleration consistent with BoE expectations

Typical 2-month changes from recent history:
- The 0.6pp decline from September to November suggests ~0.3pp/month average decline
- However, December showed reversal, indicating path is not linear
- Seasonal factors in Q1 can cause volatility

## (d) Justification

**Integration of Factors:**

1. **Authoritative Institutional Forecasts:**
   - BoE November 2025 MPR: "close to 3% early next year"
   - BoE statement (via Yahoo): "closer to 2% target in April [2026]"
   - BoE Q1 2026 projection: 3.1% (from Agent report via MoneyWeek)
   - Alan Taylor (BoE MPC member): "close to 2% by mid-2026"

2. **Recent Data Points:**
   - December 2025: 3.4%
   - January 2026: ~3.2% (implied)
   - Trend: Downward with volatility

3. **Time Interpolation:**
   - If Q1 2026 average is 3.1%, and January is ~3.2%, then February-March average would be ~3.05%
   - March specifically would likely be in range of 2.9-3.2%
   - BoE's "closer to 2% in April" suggests March should be in low 3% range

4. **Risk Factors:**
   - Megan Greene warns of persistence risks, suggesting slower decline
   - Monthly volatility has been ±0.2pp recently
   - Energy prices and budget measures (per Alan Taylor) support disinflation
   - Trade diversion effects helping lower prices

5. **Base Rate Calculation:**
   - Starting point: January 2026 at ~3.2%
   - Expected trajectory: Continuing decline toward 2% target
   - Two-month horizon: Limited time for major deviation
   - Central tendency: 2.9-3.2% range
   - Most likely: ~3.0-3.1% (consistent with Q1 average of 3.1%)

**Synthesis:**
Given the short 2-month timeframe, recent actual data showing 3.2-3.4% range, and multiple BoE sources pointing to Q1 average of 3.1% with continued decline toward 2% by mid-year, the most probable outcome for March 2026 is in the 2.9-3.2% range, with central tendency around 3.0-3.1%.

Outside view calibration:

The key anchors for calibration are:
1. **BoE Q1 2026 projection: 3.1%** - This is a quarterly average, so March could be slightly below this if the trend continues downward
2. **Recent actuals:** December 3.4%, January ~3.2% - showing 0.2pp decline
3. **BoE institutional guidance:** "close to 3%" for early 2026, "closer to 2%" by April

For a numeric forecast, I need to consider the distribution:
- **Central estimate:** 3.0-3.1% (most consistent with all evidence)
- **Realistic range:** 2.8-3.3% (accounting for monthly volatility of ±0.2pp and forecast uncertainty)
- **Tail risks:** <2.5% or >3.5% seem very unlikely given only 2-month horizon

The question asks for the specific value, not a probability distribution. Given:
- Q1 average of 3.1%
- Downward trend from January's 3.2%
- March is the last month of Q1
- BoE expects "closer to 2%" by April

**Most likely single point estimate: 3.0%**

This represents:
- 0.1pp below Q1 average (reasonable for last month of quarter in declining trend)
- 0.2pp below January 2026 (consistent with recent monthly changes)
- Still "close to 3%" as BoE predicted
- Positioned for further decline to "closer to 2%" by April

**Confidence distribution:**
- 2.8-2.9%: ~15% probability
- 3.0-3.1%: ~50% probability (central case)
- 3.2-3.3%: ~25% probability
- 3.4-3.5%: ~8% probability
- Outside 2.7-3.6%: ~2% probability

Outside View Prediction:
3.0%
