## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Official ONS data trajectory** (December 2025: 3.4%): Primary source showing actual recent inflation
2. **BoE institutional guidance** (Q2 2026 target of 2%): Multiple independent sources confirm this timing
3. **OBR 2026 annual average of 2.5%**: Official fiscal authority projection
4. **Consistent expert consensus**: Deutsche Bank (2.4% avg), Treasury survey (2.2% Q4), all pointing to continued disinflation

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Historical 2025 pattern**: Peak of 3.8% declining to 3.2-3.4% range shows established downward momentum
2. **ONS methodology change**: Scanner data implementation in February may reduce reported CPI by ~0.03pp
3. **Core inflation stability at 3.2%**: Suggests underlying price pressures moderating but sticky
4. **Services inflation at 4.5%**: Higher than headline, indicating some persistence risk

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Food inflation projections** (3.8% for 2026): Sector-specific, limited impact on headline
2. **Seasonal factors**: December uptick described as temporary

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Today: February 1, 2026
- Target: March 2026 CPI (reported mid-April 2026)
- Horizon: ~2 months (very short-term)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- March 2025: 2.6%
- Peak (July-Sept 2025): 3.8%
- November 2025: 3.2%
- December 2025: 3.4%
- Expected path to Q2 2026: ~2%

**If timeframe halved (1 month - February 2026):**
- Would expect CPI very close to December's 3.4% or January's implied ~3.2%
- Less time for disinflation to manifest
- Prediction: 3.2-3.4%

**If timeframe doubled (4 months - May 2026):**
- Would be in Q2 2026, where BoE expects ~2% target
- More time for disinflationary forces to work
- ONS methodology change would have full effect
- Prediction: 2.3-2.7%

## (d) Justification and Shift from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate:** 3.0%

**Key Factors for Adjustment:**

1. **Q1 2026 Average vs March Specific Timing:**
   - Multiple sources cite Q1 2026 projections around 3.1%
   - March is final month of Q1
   - If disinflation continues linearly: Jan ~3.2%, Feb ~3.1%, Mar ~3.0%
   - This supports the 3.0% base rate

2. **BoE Q2 2026 Target of 2%:**
   - April would be first month of Q2
   - For inflation to reach ~2% by April, March must be transitional
   - Suggests March should be 2.7-3.1% range
   - This argues for potential downside to 3.0% estimate

3. **ONS Methodology Change:**
   - Scanner data implementation in February reduces CPI by average 0.03pp
   - Effect on March data: Small downward bias (~0.03pp)
   - Minor adjustment: 3.0% → 2.97%

4. **Recent Volatility:**
   - December showed +0.2pp increase (3.2% → 3.4%)
   - Pattern of monthly fluctuations ±0.2pp
   - Argues for wider confidence interval but doesn't shift central estimate

5. **OBR 2026 Annual Average of 2.5%:**
   - If full-year average is 2.5%, and we expect ~2% in Q2-Q4
   - Q1 must be higher to balance: ~3.0-3.2% average
   - Consistent with March at 3.0%

**Synthesis:**
The convergence of evidence supports March 2026 CPI in the 2.8-3.2% range, with central estimate remaining at 3.0%. The short 2-month timeframe limits major deviation from recent actuals (3.2-3.4%), while institutional projections for Q2 2026 (~2%) require March to be transitional. The methodology change provides minor downward pressure.

**Adjustment from Outside View:**
- Base rate: 3.0%
- ONS methodology: -0.03pp
- Q2 target pressure: Supports lower end of range
- Recent volatility: Widens uncertainty but doesn't shift center
- **Revised central estimate: 2.95-3.0%**

Given the question asks for a specific value and rounding conventions, **3.0%** remains the most defensible point estimate.

## Probability Calibration

For a numeric question asking for a specific percentage value, I need to assess the probability distribution around my central estimate of 3.0%.

**Distribution Assessment:**

Given the evidence:
- Very short timeframe (2 months) limits extreme deviations
- Recent actuals: 3.2-3.4% range
- Institutional guidance: Q1 avg ~3.1%, Q2 target ~2%
- Monthly volatility: ±0.2pp typical

**Probability Ranges:**
- 2.5-2.7%: ~5% (requires accelerated disinflation, unlikely in 2 months)
- 2.8-2.9%: ~20% (faster decline than expected but possible)
- 3.0-3.1%: ~45% (central case, consistent with all evidence)
- 3.2-3.3%: ~22% (slower decline, sticky inflation scenario)
- 3.4-3.5%: ~6% (stagnation at December levels)
- >3.5% or <2.5%: ~2% (tail risks)

**Most Likely Single Value:**
The mode of this distribution is **3.0%**, with 3.1% as close second.

For a point estimate forecast, I assign:
- **3.0%: 25% probability** (most likely single value)
- **3.1%: 20% probability** (second most likely)
- **2.9%: 18% probability**
- **3.2%: 17% probability**

However, the question format appears to ask for a probability of a specific outcome. Given the context and that this is a numeric question with continuous outcomes, I interpret this as providing my best point estimate with associated confidence.

**Final Answer: 3.0%** with ~45% confidence in the 3.0-3.1% range.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Forecast March 2026 UK CPI 12-month rate (year-over-year %) as reported by ONS before May 1, 2026.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view of 3.0% based on Q1 2026 projections (~3.1% avg), recent actuals (3.2-3.4%), and BoE Q2 target (~2%). Inside view confirms this estimate.

3. **Consistency check:** "In 3 out of 10 similar forecasts, March 2026 UK CPI would be exactly 3.0%." This seems reasonable given the evidence concentration around 2.9-3.1% range.

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - ONS December 2025 CPI: 3.4% (official, factual)
   - BoE expects Q2 2026 inflation at ~2% target (institutional, high credibility)
   - OBR projects 2026 annual average of 2.5% (official forecast)
   - Multiple experts project Q1 2026 around 3.0-3.1% (consensus)
   - ONS methodology change reduces CPI by ~0.03pp (quantified impact)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** External shock (energy price spike, tariff war escalation, sterling collapse) causes March inflation to remain at 3.4%+ or spike higher. This would make my 3.0% forecast look too optimistic. However, 2-month horizon limits such scenario probability to ~5-8%.

6. **Status quo consideration:** December 2025 status quo is 3.4%. Given established downward trend and short timeframe, a modest decline to 3.0-3.1% represents gradual evolution rather than dramatic change. This supports the forecast.

Probability: 3.0%
