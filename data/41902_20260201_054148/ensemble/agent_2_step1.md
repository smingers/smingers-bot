## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **UK CPI trajectories following inflation peaks (2008, 2011, 2022-2023):**
   - Suitability: Medium-High. The current situation (peak at 3.8% in Sept 2025, declining) resembles post-peak disinflation periods.
   - 2008: CPI peaked at 5.2% (Sept 2008), fell to 3.0% by March 2009 (6 months: -2.2pp decline)
   - 2011: CPI peaked at 5.2% (Sept 2011), fell to 3.5% by March 2012 (6 months: -1.7pp decline)
   - 2022-2023: CPI peaked at 11.1% (Oct 2022), fell to 10.1% by March 2023 (5 months: -1.0pp decline)

2. **BoE inflation forecasts vs. actual outcomes (historical accuracy):**
   - Suitability: High. Central bank forecasts are sophisticated but have known biases.
   - Recent track record (2021-2024): BoE consistently underestimated inflation during the surge and may now be cautious in projecting declines.

3. **Month-to-month CPI changes in Q1 periods:**
   - Suitability: Medium. Seasonal patterns exist but are less relevant than the underlying disinflationary trend.

**Selected reference class:** UK CPI trajectories following inflation peaks, supplemented by BoE forecast accuracy considerations.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** March 2026 is approximately 2 months from today (February 1, 2026).

**Recent trajectory (factual data points):**
- September 2025: 3.8% (peak)
- November 2025: 3.2%
- December 2025: 3.4%

This shows: -0.6pp decline Sept→Nov, then +0.2pp rebound Nov→Dec. The path is not monotonic but shows underlying downward pressure with volatility.

**Historical patterns over 2-3 month periods from peaks:**
- Post-peak periods typically show continued but uneven decline
- Q1 often sees base effects and energy price adjustments
- The 2-month horizon from January to March typically shows modest changes (±0.2-0.5pp)

## (d) Justification

**Integration of factors:**

1. **Current position:** December 2025 CPI at 3.4%, having peaked at 3.8% in September 2025.

2. **Expert forecasts convergence:**
   - BoE November 2025 MPR: "close to 3% early next year"
   - BoE (institutional, January 2026): "closer to 2% target in April"
   - Alan Taylor (BoE MPC, January 2026): "close to 2% by mid-2026"
   - Agent report secondary source: BoE projects 3.1% for Q1 2026

3. **Trajectory analysis:** From 3.4% in December 2025 to March 2026 (3 months):
   - If Q1 2026 average is 3.1%, and assuming relatively smooth decline, March would likely be at or slightly below 3.1%
   - The BoE's April target of "closer to 2%" suggests March should be in the 2.5-3.2% range
   - Alan Taylor's "close to 2% by mid-2026" suggests gradual decline, not immediate drop

4. **Disinflationary factors identified:**
   - Cooling energy prices
   - Budget measures to cut living costs
   - Restrictive monetary policy effects (Bank Rate at 3.75%)
   - Weakening labor market (unemployment at 4.8%)
   - Declining wage growth

5. **Countervailing risks:**
   - December uptick (3.2%→3.4%) shows volatility remains
   - Megan Greene's warnings about inflation persistence
   - Potential external shocks (trade tensions mentioned)

**Synthesis:** The most probable outcome for March 2026 CPI is in the range of 2.7-3.2%, with central tendency around 2.9-3.0%. This reflects:
- Continuation of the disinflationary trend from the 3.8% peak
- Consistency with BoE's Q1 2026 forecast of 3.1%
- Positioning between December's 3.4% and April's expected "closer to 2%"
- Historical post-peak decline rates (typically 0.3-0.5pp over 3 months in similar contexts)

Outside view calibration:

The most reliable anchor is the BoE's Q1 2026 projection of 3.1% (from secondary source in agent report). If we assume Q1 comprises January, February, and March 2026:
- December 2025 actual: 3.4%
- Q1 2026 average projection: 3.1%
- This implies a declining path through Q1

For March specifically (the final month of Q1), if the quarter averages 3.1%, March would likely be at or below this figure given the declining trajectory. Historical patterns suggest:
- January 2026: ~3.3% (modest decline from December's 3.4%)
- February 2026: ~3.1% 
- March 2026: ~2.9%

This would yield a Q1 average of approximately 3.1%, consistent with the BoE projection.

The BoE's statement that inflation will be "closer to 2%" in April suggests March should be in the 2.7-3.1% range. Alan Taylor's forecast of "close to 2% by mid-2026" supports a gradual decline rather than a sharp drop.

**Distribution estimate:**
- 10th percentile: 2.4% (faster disinflation than expected)
- 25th percentile: 2.7% (moderately faster decline)
- 50th percentile (median): 2.9% (base case)
- 75th percentile: 3.2% (slower decline, more persistence)
- 90th percentile: 3.5% (sticky inflation, external shocks)

The median of 2.9% represents the most balanced view integrating:
- BoE institutional forecasts
- Recent trajectory from 3.4%
- Historical post-peak patterns
- Expert opinions from named MPC members

Outside View Prediction:
2.9%
