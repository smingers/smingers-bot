Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**

1. **ONS Consumer Price Inflation Bulletin (December 2025)** - Official government statistics showing December 2025 CPI at 3.4%, with historical monthly data through 2025. This is the gold standard source - factual, reliable, and directly relevant. Published mid-January 2026.

2. **Bank of England Forecast Evaluation Report (January 29, 2026)** - Recent institutional document discussing forecasting methodology. Contains no specific March 2026 projection but confirms BoE forecasts are "at least as accurate as external forecasters." Primarily methodological rather than predictive.

3. **MoneyWeek Article (November 4, 2024)** - Contains multiple expert opinions:
   - **Sanjay Raja (Deutsche Bank)**: Revised 2026 average to 2.4% (identifiable expert, moderate weight)
   - **Treasury survey**: Average Q4 2026 prediction of 2.2% (consensus of 21 economists, strong weight)
   - **OBR**: Q4 2026 projection of 2.1% (official institutional forecast, strong weight)
   - **Bank of England**: Expects 2% by early 2027 (institutional view, strong weight)

4. **AHDB Economic Outlook (February 2026)** - Most recent source, published today. Cites OBR projections: 2026 average CPI of 2.5%. Food inflation projected at 3.8% for 2026 (down from 4.3% in 2025). Identifiable institutional source (strong weight).

5. **Morningstar Article (January 20, 2026)** - Contains expert opinions:
   - **Grant Slade (Morningstar)**: Expects inflation "close to 2% target by end of 2026" (identifiable expert, moderate weight)
   - **BoE statement**: Expects 2% in Q2 2026 (institutional, strong weight)

6. **LSE Business Review (January 28, 2026)** - Academic analysis showing public forecasts have been more accurate than BoE recently. December 2025 CPI confirmed at 3.4%. Notes inflation momentum and public expectations as key drivers (academic source, moderate weight for methodology, weak for specific predictions).

**Secondary Sources (Lower Quality):**

7. **AskNews Articles** - Multiple articles about India, Spain, Portugal, and UK methodology changes. The UK-specific articles note:
   - ONS implementing new grocery price data collection from February 2026 using scanner data
   - Expected to reduce CPI by approximately 0.03 percentage points on average
   - Could create 0.1pp difference in 39 out of 66 months historically

8. **Historical UK CPI data articles** - Confirm September 2025 CPI at 3.8%, August at 3.8%, showing the declining trend through year-end.

**Key Factual Data Points:**
- December 2025 CPI: 3.4% (confirmed, ONS)
- November 2025 CPI: 3.2% (confirmed, ONS)
- March 2025 CPI: 2.6% (confirmed, ONS)
- Core inflation: 3.2% (stable for 3 months)
- Services inflation: 4.5%

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large Shift Potential):**

1. **Multiple institutional forecasts converging on 2.0-2.5% range for 2026:**
   - OBR: 2.5% average for 2026 (from AHDB, February 2026)
   - BoE: 2% target by Q2 2026 (from Morningstar)
   - Treasury consensus: 2.2% average Q4 2026 (21 economists)
   - Deutsche Bank: 2.4% average for 2026
   
   These independent, identifiable sources all point to continued disinflation through 2026, suggesting March 2026 should be in the 2.0-3.0% range.

2. **Established disinflationary trend with clear momentum:**
   - July-September 2025: 3.8%
   - October 2025: 3.6%
   - November 2025: 3.2%
   - December 2025: 3.4%
   
   Average monthly decline of ~0.15-0.20pp when smoothing the December uptick (which experts called "seasonal" and "short-lived").

3. **Structural disinflationary factors from Autumn Budget:**
   - Extended 5p fuel duty cut
   - Removal of green levies on energy
   - Rail fare freeze until March 2027
   - BoE analysis: ~0.5pp downward pressure on prices

**Moderate Evidence (Moderate Shift):**

1. **ONS methodology change (February 2026):**
   - New scanner data for groceries expected to reduce CPI by ~0.03pp on average
   - Could create 0.1pp difference in specific months
   - Timing is relevant: affects data from February onwards, which feeds into March YoY comparison

2. **Seasonal pattern analysis:**
   - March 2025 CPI was 2.6%
   - March historically shows moderate inflation (outside view: 2.1% mean)
   - No major energy price changes expected in Q1 2026 based on current information

3. **Food inflation moderating:**
   - December 2025: 4.5% (down from 5.1% in August)
   - IGD forecast: 3.8% average for 2026
   - Food has significant weight in CPI basket

**Weak Evidence (Small Adjustments):**

1. **December uptick to 3.4%:**
   - Multiple experts (Raja, Haine) called this "seasonal" and "short-lived"
   - Driven by airfares and tobacco duty timing
   - Suggests February-March should resume decline

2. **Interest rate environment:**
   - Base rate at 3.75%, restrictive policy continues
   - Further cuts expected (March, June per Deutsche Bank)
   - Lagged effect supports continued disinflation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 59 days from today (February 1, 2026) to March 2026 data release (mid-April 2026). The March 2026 CPI measures the 12-month change from March 2025 to March 2026.

**Critical consideration:** March 2025 had CPI of 2.6%. This creates a favorable base effect - we're comparing against a relatively low number, which could mechanically push the March 2026 YoY rate higher than if we were comparing against the 3.8% peak from mid-2025.

**If timeframe halved (30 days):** Would be forecasting February 2026 CPI instead. Given December was 3.4% and experts expect continued disinflation, February would likely be 3.1-3.3%. The shorter timeframe reduces uncertainty but also reduces time for disinflation to progress.

**If timeframe doubled (120 days):** Would be forecasting May 2026 CPI. This would likely be closer to 2.0-2.5% range given BoE's Q2 2026 target of 2% and continued policy effects. More time allows stronger convergence to target.

## (d) Justification and Shift from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate:** 2.4% (based on historical patterns and institutional forecasts)

**Key Factors Requiring Adjustment:**

1. **Base effect from March 2025 (2.6%):** This is crucial. The YoY calculation compares March 2026 prices to March 2025 prices. Since March 2025 was relatively low (2.6%), even if absolute price levels continue rising moderately, the YoY rate could be higher than if we were comparing to the 3.8% peak months.

2. **Recent trajectory stronger than expected:** The decline from 3.8% (July-Sep) to 3.2% (November) was 0.6pp in 4 months, or 0.15pp/month. Extrapolating forward 2 months (to March data collection) suggests: 3.4% - 0.3pp = 3.1%.

3. **Institutional consensus clustering 2.0-2.5% for 2026:** 
   - If average for full year is 2.4-2.5%, and we expect continued decline through the year, Q1 should be higher than the average
   - March is in Q1, so should be 2.5-3.0% to allow room for further decline to reach 2.0% by Q2

4. **ONS methodology change:** Small downward bias of ~0.03-0.10pp from February onwards.

5. **Seasonal December uptick already reverting:** Experts unanimous this was temporary, suggesting January-March resume decline.

**Reconciling the base effect:**
The March 2025 base of 2.6% is actually LOWER than the outside view historical March average of 2.1%... wait, that's incorrect. Let me reconsider: the outside view stated the historical March mean is 2.1%, but March 2025 actual was 2.6%, which is 0.5pp HIGHER than the historical average. This means March 2025 provides a slightly elevated base for comparison.

**Revised calculation:**
- December 2025: 3.4%
- Expected monthly decline: 0.15pp
- Two months to March: -0.3pp
- March 2026 estimate: 3.1%
- ONS methodology adjustment: -0.05pp (midpoint of 0.03-0.10pp)
- **Adjusted estimate: 3.0%**

However, checking against institutional forecasts:
- If BoE expects 2% by Q2 2026 (April-June), March needs to be higher to allow that transition
- If OBR expects 2.5% average for full year 2026, and Q2-Q4 average around 2.0-2.2%, then Q1 must average ~2.8-3.2%
- March as the last month of Q1 could be 2.7-3.1%

**Final justification for shift from 2.4% outside view to ~2.8-3.0% inside view:**
The outside view of 2.4% appears too low because:
1. It underweights the current starting point (3.4% in December)
2. It doesn't account for the gradual nature of disinflation (0.15pp/month is slow)
3. The timeframe is too short (2 months) for a 0.6pp+ decline to 2.4%
4. Institutional forecasts suggest Q1 should be 2.8-3.2% to reach their year-end targets

The evidence strongly supports continued disinflation but at a measured pace, pointing to 2.7-3.1% range for March 2026.

## Probability Calibration

Given the analysis, I need to construct a probability distribution centered around 2.8-3.0%:

**Central scenario (2.5-3.0%): 50%**
- Most likely outcome given current trajectory
- Consistent with 0.15pp/month decline from 3.4%
- Aligns with institutional forecasts for Q1 2026
- Accounts for ONS methodology change

**Lower than expected (2.0-2.5%): 25%**
- Possible if disinflation accelerates
- BoE Q2 target of 2% suggests this is plausible
- Would require 0.2-0.3pp/month decline
- Food inflation moderating faster than expected

**Higher than expected (3.0-3.5%): 20%**
- Sticky services inflation (currently 4.5%)
- Wage growth (4-5%) feeding through
- Potential energy price volatility
- December uptick proving less temporary

**Much higher (>3.5%): 3%**
- Major shock required (energy, sterling crisis)
- Very unlikely given current macro environment

**Much lower (<2.0%): 2%**
- Would require sharp disinflation
- Inconsistent with all institutional forecasts
- Possible but improbable

**Expected value:** (0.25 × 2.25%) + (0.50 × 2.75%) + (0.20 × 3.25%) + (0.03 × 3.75%) + (0.02 × 1.75%) = 2.8%

Given the question asks for a point estimate and the distribution is relatively tight around 2.7-3.0%, I'll center my prediction at **2.8%**.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Predict UK CPI 12-month YoY rate for March 2026 as reported by ONS series D7G7, resolving before May 1, 2026.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view was 2.4%; inside view shifts to 2.8% due to short timeframe (2 months), current level (3.4%), and gradual disinflation pace (0.15pp/month). Shift is justified by strong institutional consensus and clear momentum.

3. **Consistency:** "28 out of 100 times, March 2026 UK CPI is exactly 2.8%." More accurately: "50 out of 100 times, March 2026 CPI falls between 2.5-3.0%." This aligns with measured disinflation from current 3.4% over 2 months.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - December 2025 CPI confirmed at 3.4% by ONS (factual, reliable)
   - Multiple institutions forecast 2.4-2.5% average for 2026 (strong consensus)
   - Historical decline rate of 0.15pp/month since July 2025 (demonstrated momentum)
   - BoE expects 2% by Q2 2026, implying Q1 higher (institutional forecast)
   - ONS methodology change reduces CPI by ~0.03-0.10pp from February (official announcement)

5. **Blind spot:** A sudden energy price shock (geopolitical event, severe weather) or sterling depreciation crisis could push inflation higher than expected. Alternatively, a faster-than-expected economic slowdown could accelerate disinflation beyond forecasts. The 2-month window limits major structural shifts, but commodity markets can move quickly.

6. **Status quo:** Current trajectory is clearly disinflationary but gradual. December's 3.4% represents a slight uptick from November's 3.2%, which experts attribute to seasonal factors. The status quo suggests continued slow decline, supporting the 2.7-3.0% range rather than dramatic moves in either direction.

**Probability:** 2.8% is my point estimate, but recognizing this is a continuous variable, I should express confidence in a range. The question likely resolves to a specific decimal (e.g., 2.7%, 2.8%, 2.9%). 

Given the evidence, my probability distribution:
- 2.5-2.7%: 25%
- 2.7-2.9%: 35%
- 2.9-3.1%: 25%
- 3.1-3.3%: 10%
- Other: 5%

For a point prediction of the most likely outcome: **2.8%**

Probability: 2.8%
