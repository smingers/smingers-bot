Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **World Bank Open Data page (UK “Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)”)**  
- **What it contains:** Essentially a data-portal shell; no usable numbers in the excerpt.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** High-quality if the actual data were extracted, but **the provided snippet contains no data** and is **not directly about ONS CPI D7G7** (it’s typically IMF/IFS annual CPI inflation, not the ONS monthly CPI 12‑month rate required here).  
- **Actionable content:** None for March 2026.

2) **ONS CPI dataset landing page**  
- **What it contains:** Metadata about tables, formats, accessibility; no CPI values or forecasts.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** Authoritative about the *dataset*, but **no quantitative content** for forecasting.  
- **Actionable content:** None.

3) **FT paywalled article on ONS methodology revamp (scanner data)**  
- **What it contains:** Only a headline-level indication of methodological change; no detail in the excerpt.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** Potentially relevant longer-run (measurement effects), but **no extractable facts** here and unclear magnitude/direction.  
- **Actionable content:** Minimal.

4) **Bank of England Monetary Policy Report (MPR), Nov 2025**  
- **Key factual statements in excerpt:**  
  - CPI inflation was **3.8% in Aug/Sep 2025**; described as a peak.  
  - BoE expects CPI to fall **close to 3% early next year** and then **gradually return toward 2%** over the subsequent year.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** High-quality institutional forecast narrative; however, the excerpt lacks the fan-chart numerical path. Still, it provides a credible directional baseline: **disinflation continuing through 2026**.

5) **The Guardian (Jan 14, 2026) quoting MPC member Alan Taylor**  
- **Factual claims (as reported):** “Current” inflation cited as **3.2%** (at that time).  
- **Expert opinion:** Taylor expects inflation to **fall sharply** and reach **~2% by mid‑2026** (also citing drivers like energy, budget measures, cheaper goods).  
- **Quality/usefulness:** Medium-high: it’s a secondary report but names an identifiable policymaker. The numeric “3.2%” is likely based on recent ONS CPI prints (but not directly cited from ONS here).

6) **Yahoo Finance (Jan 23, 2026) quoting MPC member Megan Greene + “BoE expects inflation closer to 2% in April”**  
- **Factual claims:** **Dec 2025 CPI 3.4%** (up from 3.2% in Nov) and first rise since July 2025.  
- **Expert/institutional opinion:** Risks around persistence; and a key anchor statement that the **BoE expects inflation closer to 2% in April 2026**.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** Medium-high: named policymaker + concrete recent CPI data point. Still secondary reporting, but the Dec CPI number is a strong tether.

7) **Agent report (meta-search results)**  
- **What it adds:**  
  - Confirms ONS D7G7 data are downloadable but not extracted here.  
  - Provides a **secondary citation** (MoneyWeek live blog) that BoE projections put CPI at **~3.1% in 2026 Q1** (central projection).  
  - Notes OBR annual average cited elsewhere (~**2.5% for CY 2026**) but missing quarterly/monthly.  
- **Quality/usefulness:** Mixed. Helpful for *where numbers are*, but the key numeric (3.1% in Q1 2026) is **second-hand**. Still, it’s consistent with the general disinflation narrative.

**Net takeaway from sources:** Recent CPI is in the **low-to-mid 3%s** (3.2–3.4 cited for late 2025/early 2026 context). BoE narrative and MPC commentary suggest continued disinflation toward **~2% by mid‑2026**, with an institutional hint of being **nearer 2% by April**.

### (b) Reference class analysis (base-rate framing)

Because we lack a full extracted monthly history in the prompt, the most useful reference classes are qualitative/structural:

1) **UK CPI outcomes during “post-peak disinflation” episodes** (inflation coming down from an elevated plateau due to easing energy/supply shocks + restrictive policy)  
- **Suitability:** High. The UK appears in this regime (BoE: inflation peaked 3.8% in Sep 2025; policy still restrictive but easing).  
- **Base-rate implication:** Once inflation has peaked and underlying pressures ease, 12‑month CPI typically declines **gradually over several quarters**, not collapsing in 1–2 months—unless there are large base effects.

2) **UK CPI distribution in the inflation-targeting era (roughly 1997–2019) vs shock era (2021–2025)**  
- **Suitability:** Medium. It provides a long-run anchor (often ~2%), but the near-term regime still reflects post-shock normalization.  
- **Base-rate implication:** A reversion toward ~2% is plausible, but the *timing* is uncertain; March 2026 may still be above target.

3) **Near-term month-to-month persistence of YoY CPI** (how much YoY CPI typically moves in 2–3 months)  
- **Suitability:** High for a March 2026 forecast given today is Feb 1, 2026.  
- **Base-rate implication:** YoY CPI usually changes by **tenths of a percentage point per month**, with occasional larger moves due to energy/base effects.

**Chosen reference class:** *Near-term persistence within a post-peak disinflation regime* (1 + 3). It’s best matched to “March 2026, two months ahead, in a cooling-inflation environment.”

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how far out; what patterns matter)

- **Today:** 2026-02-01.  
- **Target month:** March 2026 CPI 12‑month rate.  
- **Time until the month occurs:** ~2 months.  
- **Time until likely publication/resolution:** Typically mid‑April 2026; resolution by May 1, 2026.

**Implication:** This is a very short-horizon inflation forecast. The biggest drivers over ~2 months are:
- **Inflation persistence** (inertia in services/wages),
- **Energy/food volatility** (can move headline),
- **Base effects** (comparison month March 2025),
- **Administrative/tax changes** (often seen around April more than March).

Given sources explicitly mention “closer to 2% in April,” March is likely **not far from** that directionally, but may still be above 2% if the final drop is expected later in spring/early summer.

### (d) Justification for an outside-view point estimate

**Start with a base-rate anchor:**  
- Current-ish headline CPI is described as **~3.2–3.4%** (late 2025 / early 2026 context). Absent a major shock, the outside-view expects **incremental** moves over two months.

**Add regime information (post-peak disinflation):**  
- BoE (Nov 2025) says inflation likely peaked at **3.8%** and should fall toward **2%** over the subsequent year. That implies a downward slope through 2026.

**Add a short-horizon extrapolation:**  
- If CPI was ~3.4% in Dec 2025 and (per commentary) ~3.2% around mid-Jan 2026, that suggests a pace on the order of **~0.1 pp per month** recently (very rough, but consistent with typical persistence).  
- Extending that mechanically to March (two more months) suggests something like **~3.0%**.

**But incorporate the “April near-2%” narrative as a constraint:**  
- If the BoE expects inflation “closer to 2% in April,” the outside-view should allow for a somewhat faster drop between Feb–Apr than the simple 0.1pp/month trend—potentially via base effects or energy.  
- March would then plausibly land **between** “around 3%” and “nearer 2%”, i.e., **high‑2s**.

**Outside-view synthesis:** a reasonable base-rate point for March 2026 is **around 2.8–3.0%**, with skew depending on energy/base effects. Given the multiple qualitative anchors pointing to “mid‑2026 ~2%” and “April closer to 2%,” I place March slightly below 3%.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether points from sources:**  
  - Recent level: **3.2–3.4%** (secondary reporting of recent CPI).  
  - BoE narrative: **~3% early 2026** (Nov 2025 MPR) and “closer to 2% in April” (Yahoo summary).  
- **My calibrated uncertainty (because we don’t have the March 2025 base nor full fan-chart path):**  
  - Central estimate around **2.9%**.  
  - (Informal) 50% range: **2.6%–3.2%**; 80% range: **2.2%–3.6%**.

Outside View Prediction:
**2.90%**
