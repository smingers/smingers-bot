Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria (numeric target)**
This resolves to the **ONS time series D7G7** (“CPI ANNUAL RATE 00: ALL ITEMS 2015=100”) value for **March 2026** (12‑month rate, %) using the latest value published before **May 1, 2026**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
1) **ONS CPI bulletin (Dec 2025)** (primary, high quality, Jan 2026 release for Dec data)  
   - **Facts:** Dec 2025 CPI **3.4%** (up from 3.2% Nov), services inflation **4.5%**, core CPI **3.2%**; detailed drivers (airfares, tobacco duty timing, etc.).  
   - **Use:** Best anchor for *current level* and *composition* (services still sticky).

2) **MoneyWeek inflation outlook** (secondary media, medium quality, Nov 2024 but includes late-2025 figures and named economists)  
   - **Facts (as reported):** Dec 2025 CPI 3.4; late-2025 path (3.8 plateau, then down, then uptick).  
   - **Opinions:** Deutsche Bank’s Raja: 2026 avg inflation **2.4%**; more rate cuts likely. Bestinvest: disinflation resumes.  
   - **Use:** Helps triangulate market/economist expectations; not definitive for March.

3) **Morningstar (Jan 20, 2026)** (secondary but cites consensus/FactSet; medium-high quality)  
   - **Facts:** Mentions market pricing for rate cuts; repeats BoE-type guidance that inflation nearer target by Q2 2026.  
   - **Opinions:** Morningstar economist expects slowing in 2026; notes slack in labour market.  
   - **Use:** Good for “expert/market expectation” directionally (down).

4) **LSE Business Review (Jan 28, 2026)** (academically informed, medium quality for forecasting level; high for meta-point)  
   - **Facts:** Documents systematic BoE forecast bias (often underpredicting when inflation >2).  
   - **Use:** Suggests not leaning *too hard* into optimistic/rapid drops to 2%.

5) **AHDB (Feb 2026 outlook, citing OBR Nov 2025)** (secondary, medium quality; relies on OBR)  
   - **Facts/forecast:** OBR-based statement: 2026 CPI eases to ~**2.5%** (annual).  
   - **Use:** Broad macro anchor; not month-specific.

6) **BoE Forecast Evaluation Report (Jan 29, 2026)** (primary BoE doc, high quality but **no numeric March path**)  
   - **Facts:** Process/accuracy discussion; no direct March 2026 CPI number.  
   - **Use:** Minimal for level forecast.

7) **Reuters/Investing.com on ONS methodology change (Jan 28, 2026)** (high relevance; Reuters is high quality; Investing summaries are medium but reflect Reuters/ONS statements)  
   - **Facts:** ONS will introduce **scanner data for groceries starting with Feb 2026 CPI**, plus sampling changes (hotels, video games). Backcast indicates **avg CPI would have been ~0.03pp lower**, with **0.1pp differences** fairly common historically.  
   - **Use:** Directly affects the measured CPI from Feb onward—small but *real* downward nudge to March 2026 reported CPI.

8) **UK labour market article (Manchester Evening News citing ONS, Dec 16, 2025)** (secondary, medium quality)  
   - **Facts:** Regular earnings growth slowing (~4.6% to Oct 2025), unemployment ~5.1%.  
   - **Use:** Directionally disinflationary via slack/wage cooling; timing lag is the caveat.

(Other AskNews items on India/Spain inflation are not UK-relevant for this resolution.)

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence**
- **Current inflation level and composition from ONS:** headline 3.4% with **services 4.5%** (services stickiness tends to slow the last mile).  
- **Institutional/market consensus direction:** multiple sources converge on inflation **falling through 2026** toward ~2% by late-2026/early-2027 (BoE/OBR/economists broadly aligned on direction).

**Moderate evidence**
- **ONS measurement change starting Feb 2026** likely to **lower reported CPI slightly** (typical effect ~0.03pp, sometimes ~0.1pp). This is directly relevant to March’s printed value.  
- **Labour market cooling (higher unemployment, slower wage growth)** supports disinflation over coming quarters, but pass-through is uncertain and lagged.

**Weak evidence**
- **Geopolitical/trade-war hypotheticals** (oil spikes/tariffs) are plausible but not yet clearly evidenced as of Feb 1, 2026; I treat them as tail risk rather than central.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **2026-02-01**. Target month: **March 2026** (about **2 months** away; outcome published mid‑April 2026, but the value is for March).  
- **If timeframe were halved (≈1 month; February 2026):** I’d stay closer to current 3.4% because there’s less time for the YoY rate to move and base effects dominate.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (≈4 months; June 2026):** I’d move closer to “near‑2% by mid‑2026” narratives (probably low‑2s) because more disinflation momentum and base effects can accumulate.

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view (2.9%) to an inside view
**Outside view anchor (given):** median around **2.9%** for March 2026.

Key updates since that base-rate framing:
1) **Measurement change (Feb 2026 onward) slightly lowers printed CPI**  
   - Expected effect is small but systematic: roughly **-0.03pp** on average historically; occasionally **-0.1pp**.  
   - Since March 2026 will be computed under the new method, I apply a modest downward adjustment (~0.03–0.05pp).

2) **Services inflation remains high (4.5%)** → argues *against* a rapid plunge to ~2.0 by March  
   - This offsets some of the “close to target by Q2 2026” optimism. The last mile usually requires clearer services/wage cooling.

3) **Macro consensus still points down into Q2 2026**  
   - Even with stickier services, the broad expectation is continued disinflation; March should likely be below Dec’s 3.4% unless an energy/oil shock hits.

Netting these: I shift the outside-view **2.9% slightly downward** (measurement + ongoing disinflation), but not dramatically (services stickiness).

**Inside-view point forecast (March 2026 CPI YoY): 2.85%**  
Suggested uncertainty (percentiles for March 2026 CPI):
- 10th: **2.35%** (faster services cooling / benign energy / favourable base effects)
- 25th: **2.60%**
- 50th: **2.85%**
- 75th: **3.10%** (services persist; slower fall)
- 90th: **3.45%** (oil/energy shock or renewed supply/tax pressures)

Probability calibration
- **Outside view median:** 2.9%  
- **Adjustments:**  
  - ONS scanner-data methodology from Feb: **~−0.03 to −0.05pp** (moderate evidence, directly relevant)  
  - Sticky services/wages: **+0.00 to +0.05pp** (moderate evidence; offsets some)  
  - Net: **~−0.05pp** vs outside view  
- **Inside view (final):** **2.85%** (with moderate uncertainty; tails still meaningful given energy sensitivity)

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** Forecast the **ONS D7G7 CPI 12‑month rate for March 2026**, using the latest value published before **May 1, 2026**.  
2) **Outside view distribution (given):** P10 2.4, P25 2.7, P50 2.9, P75 3.2, P90 3.5.  
3) **Consistency line:** In repeated worlds, March 2026 CPI would print about **2.85%** on average, with common outcomes in roughly **2.6–3.1%**.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - ONS: Dec 2025 CPI **3.4%**, services **4.5%** (sticky component).  
   - ONS/Reuters: **Feb 2026 methodology** likely lowers CPI **~0.03pp** on average.  
   - Broad BoE/OBR/economist direction: disinflation through 2026 toward ~2%.  
   - Labour market slack/wage growth cooling supports further disinflation (lagged).  
5) **Blind spot:** A sudden **oil/energy spike** or large regulated-price reset could keep March CPI near/above ~3.3–3.5%.  
6) **Status quo check:** Starting from **3.4%** (Dec), a move to the **high‑2s** by March is plausible but not guaranteed; I did not over-pull toward 2.0 given services stickiness.

Probability: 2.85%
