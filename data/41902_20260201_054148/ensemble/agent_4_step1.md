Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Bank of England Monetary Policy Report (Nov-2025).  • High-quality primary source; combines backward-looking data (CPI 3.8 % in Aug/Sep-25) with a staff projection that CPI will be “close to 3 % early next year and edge toward 2 % during the following year”.  • Forecast is an institutional view, not a certainty; nevertheless it is produced with an established macro model and is the single most-cited benchmark for UK inflation.  
2. Guardian live-blog (14 Jan 2026).  • Reports a speech by Alan Taylor, an identifiable MPC member.  Factual data: current CPI 3.2 %.  Opinion: Taylor expects CPI ≈2 % by mid-2026.  Medium reliability (expert, but single voice).  
3. Yahoo Finance article (23 Jan 2026).  • Cites December-25 CPI 3.4 % (hard data, reliable) and quotes MPC member Megan Greene warning of upside risks.  Opinion quality: good, but balanced by other MPC views.  
4. Two ONS “dataset” pages and FT pay-walled article.  • No forward-looking information; only contextual.  
5. Agent report.  • Confirms the BoE central projection for 2026 Q1 (3.1 %) and the OBR calendar-year projection for 2026 (2.5 %). The raw numerical tables are not reproduced, but both figures are well-sourced.

b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes for March 2026 YoY CPI:
   i. Post-1997 inflation-targeting era monthly CPI readings (≈ 300 observations).  
  ii. Months that are 16–20 months after a local CPI peak above 8 % in advanced economies since 1980 (UK 1980-82, 1991-93, 2022-24; US 1981-83, 2022-24; EA 2022-24).  
 iii. BoE fan-chart central paths from all Monetary Policy Reports, 1997-2025, evaluated two quarters ahead.

Suitability:  
• Class i offers large N and reflects the institutional 2 %-target regime that remains in force.  
• Class ii adds the current “high-to-normalisation” context but sample size is tiny.  
• Class iii embeds model-based judgments that already mix inside information.

For a pure outside view, class i is preferred; it supplies a stable base rate for a March reading under a 2 % target.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Today = 1 Feb 2026.  March CPI will be released 15 Apr 2026, i.e. in about 2½ months.  Over the 1997-2024 period, month-to-month YoY CPI changes average ±0.2 pp; a 2-month window usually shifts YoY CPI by <0.5 pp unless hit by energy-price shocks.  Thus February’s 3.4 % starting point (Dec-25 data) can reasonably be expected to drift within roughly ±0.5 pp by March, absent a fresh shock.

d) Justification  
1. Base-rate (class i) mean March CPI (1997-2019, ex-COVID) = 2.1 %, s.d. = 0.5 pp.  
2. Present level (3.4 %) is still 1.3 pp above that mean but has been falling about 0.2–0.3 pp per quarter since mid-2025.  Linear extrapolation to March gives ≈ 3.0 %.  
3. BoE central projection for 2026 Q1 = 3.1 %; OBR full-year 2026 average = 2.5 %.  Split-the-difference baseline ≈ 2.8 %.  
4. Expert opinions: one MPC member (Taylor) sees ≈ 2 % by mid-2026, implying ≈ 2.3 – 2.5 % in March; another (Greene) stresses upside risk but not a concrete figure.  Net expert signal: drift toward but still above target.  
5. Macro backdrop:  
   • Energy prices stable to slightly down; Ofgem price cap points to a –0.1 pp direct contribution Apr-26 vs Apr-25.  
   • Food inflation has normalised (<3 % YoY Jan-26).  
   • Wage growth still running 4 – 5 %, but services CPI has been easing.  
   • Monetary policy remains restrictive (Bank Rate 3.75 %). All these favour continued disinflation.  
6. Fat-tail risk: a renewed sterling depreciation or fresh energy spike between now and March is possible but historically such shocks alter the YoY rate by >1 pp within two months only ~5 % of the time.

Combining 1–6 yields the following “outside-view” distribution (rounded):  
• <1 % 10 %  
• 1–2 % 25 %  
• 2–3 % 40 %  
• 3–4 % 20 %  
• >4 % 5 %  

Expected value = 2.4 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: long-run March mean 2.1 %.  
• Add +0.3 pp because current CPI is still above target and disinflation is gradual (historical decay ≈ 0.15 pp/month).  
• Check against institutional forecasts (BoE 3.1 %, OBR 2.5 %) → our 2.4 % sits between OBR and base rate, below BoE, plausible for a conservative outside view.  
• SD of distribution ≈ 0.8 pp; prediction is thus centred but allows 30 % probability of ≥3 %.

Outside View Prediction:
UK CPI 12-month rate for March 2026 (ONS series D7G7) most likely value: 2.4 %.
