Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ONS CPI December-2025 bulletin (19 Jan 2026 release). Facts: headline CPI 3.4 %, core 3.2 %. Authoritative, most recent hard data.  
2. MoneyWeek (4 Nov 2024). Facts: plateau and subsequent fall of CPI in 2025; Opinions: Deutsche Bank, OBR, BoE forecasts. Medium quality, dated but still useful for trend direction.  
3. Bank of England Monetary Policy Report, Nov 2025. Facts: CPI peaked 3.8 % (Jul-Sep 2025). Opinion: staff projection “around 3 % early-2026, near 2 % mid-2026”. Strong, expert, recent.  
4. Reuters / Investing.com (28 Jan 2026). Facts: ONS methodological change from Feb 2026; back-testing would have cut CPI by 0.03 pp on average, up to 0.1 pp some months. Official, high quality.  
5. Yahoo Finance (23 Jan 2026) quoting MPC member Megan Greene. Facts: Dec CPI 3.4 %. Opinion: BoE expects “closer to 2 % in April 2026”. Identifiable expert, moderate quality.  
6. LSE Business Review blog (28 Jan 2026). Facts: public vs BoE forecast accuracy. Opinion: suggestion BoE use public expectations. Academic, moderate quality, limited direct bearing.  
7. Spanish/Portuguese January-2026 CPI reports. Facts: rapid energy-led disinflation in Euro-area to ≈2.4 %. Indirect, but confirm wider European disinflation trend. Moderate.  
8. AHDB economic-outlook (Feb 2026). Facts: OBR projects UK CPI average 2.5 % in 2026. Official forecast, moderate.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Recent ONS prints show headline CPI already down from 3.8 % to 3.4 % (structural disinflation).  
• BoE & MPC public projections converge on ≈2 % by mid-2026 (multiple independent expert sources).  
Moderate evidence  
• Method change from Feb 2026 mechanically shaves ≈0.03–0.10 pp from CPI (direct causal, single source).  
• Euro-area January data signal continued energy-driven disinflation that typically spills into UK with a lag.  
• OBR 2026 annual average 2.5 % implies spring values in high-2 s (indirect inference).  
Weak evidence  
• Academic piece on forecast accuracy; helpful but no numeric trajectory.  
• MoneyWeek commentary (dated one year).

Net directional pressure: downward 0.3-0.5 pp from the outside-view 2.9 % baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Now to publication: ~70 days.  Two-month horizon means inertia dominates; CPI yo-y usually moves ≤0.3 pp per month unless energy/base effects large.  Halving the horizon (forecasting Feb) would reduce room for scanner-data and base-effect shifts; point estimate +0.1 pp.  Doubling (forecasting May) would lower central estimate by another ≈0.2 pp as BoE aims for target.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate (outside view) 2.9 %.  
Adjustments:  
• Euro-gasoline & utility prices down sharply in Jan; March-2025 comparison month had strong 0.6 % m/m print → favourable base effect (-0.15 pp).  
• Scanner-data & sampling tweak effective from Feb (-0.05 pp expected March).  
• Wage growth cooling, unemployment edging up (-0.05 pp).  
• Tobacco duty bump (Nov 2025) no longer in 12-month window by March (+0.05 pp).  
Aggregate net: -0.25 pp → 2.65 %.  Round to one decimal for reporting conventions: 2.7 %.

Uncertainty: 50 % CI 2.4–2.9 %, 80 % CI 2.1–3.3 %.  Skew slightly high because services inflation sticky.

Probability calibration
My point forecast for the March 2026 CPI 12-month rate (ONS series D7G7) is 2.7 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Predict the %-change in UK CPI (D7G7) for Mar-2026, value published before 1 May 2026.  
2. Outside view distribution centred 2.9 % (50 % 2.6–3.2 %).  
3. “Roughly 1 time in 2 the March print lands within 2.4–2.9 %; my best single guess is 2.7 %.”  
4. Key evidence: a) BoE projection to ~2 % by Apr, b) ONS 3.4 % Dec actual, c) scanner-data downward bias, d) favourable base-effect from Mar-2025, e) falling energy prices in Europe.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden spike in oil or sterling depreciation >10 % by March would push headline above 3 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; still downward trend so nudged 0.1 pp below outside view.

Probability: 2.7%
