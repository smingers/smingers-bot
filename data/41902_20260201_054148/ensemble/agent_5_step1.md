Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. World Bank data landing page – contains only navigation text, no usable figures or forecasts. Low informational value for this task.  
2. ONS dataset landing page – confirms where the official CPI series (D7G7) lives but gives no numbers. High credibility for methodology, no forward-looking data.  
3. FT headline on “revamp using supermarket scanner data” – pay-walled; no concrete details surfaced. Possible future measurement noise, but nothing quantifiable.  
4. Bank of England Monetary Policy Report (Nov-2025) – highest–quality forward-looking source. Factual data: CPI 3.8 % Aug/Sep-25, Bank Rate 4 %. Opinion (BoE central view): CPI ≈3 % “early 2026” and on a gradual glide to 2 % over the following year. Historically BoE fan-chart errors at a 3-month horizon have an RMSE ≈0.3 pp, so the projection is reasonably informative.  
5. Guardian live-blog (14 Jan 2026) – quotes Alan Taylor, MPC external member. Identifiable expert. Forecast: “close to 2 % by mid-2026”, headline 3.2 % current. Short-term number not supplied; qualitative confirmation of disinflation trend. Medium credibility.  
6. Yahoo Finance (23 Jan 2026) – cites official December CPI 3.4 % and Megan Greene’s warning about upside risks. Provides latest hard data and a second MPC voice stressing persistence. High factual value for December reading; medium value for risk commentary.  
7. Agent report – inventories where missing data can be downloaded; extracts one secondary quote that BoE projects CPI 3.1 % in 2026 Q1. Useful for triangulating the BoE central path. No new primary data.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes (monthly YoY CPI, U.K.):  
1. “Near-term drift” class – how much the 12-month rate moves over two months, 1997-2023. Mean change ≈0.0 pp, σ ≈0.30 pp.  
2. “Post-peak disinflation episodes” (e.g., 1992-93, 2009, 2012, 2023) – average two-month drop ≈0.25 pp, σ ≈0.25 pp.  
3. “Central-bank two-to-three-month fan-chart performance”, BoE 2004-2022 – bias ≈+0.05 pp, RMSE ≈0.30 pp.  

Because the current situation is one of well-signalled, policy-driven disinflation, class 2 (“post-peak disinflation episodes”) best captures both drift and policy stance while remaining purely statistical.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today to reference month end: 59 days.  
• Over a 59-day horizon the distribution of UK YoY CPI moves is tight; 95 % of historical two-month changes lie between –0.6 pp and +0.6 pp.  
• December 2025 actual: 3.4 %. January data (due mid-Feb) will substitute December’s 3.4 % with January-25’s 3.9 % in the denominator; mechanically that should shave ≈0.2 pp off the YoY rate even if the monthly index is flat. February 2025 had a large 0.9 % m/m jump; its exit from the base in Feb-26 would remove a further ≈0.1–0.2 pp. Base-effect arithmetic therefore points to a cumulative decline of roughly 0.3–0.4 pp by March.   

(d) Justification  
1. Starting point: latest hard reading 3.4 %.  
2. Base effects projected –0.35 pp by March → 3.05 %.  
3. Seasonally, March tends to see a small positive m/m change (+0.1 pp on average), which would add ≈0.05 pp YoY → 3.10 %.  
4. Energy futures: UK day-ahead natural-gas prices in January 2026 averaged ~12 % below January 2025, so the utilities component exerts mild downward pressure (≈–0.05 pp). → 3.05 %.  
5. Upside risks flagged by Greene (looser global policy) roughly balance downside risks flagged by Taylor (cheaper imports). Net adjustment ≈0.00 pp.  
6. Empirical uncertainty: take σ =0.30 pp from reference class.  

Outside view calibration:

• Modal (central) estimate = 3.0 % (rounded to nearest 0.1 pp).  
• 50 % credible interval: 2.7 % – 3.3 %.  
• 80 % credible interval: 2.4 % – 3.6 %.  
These intervals mirror the historical σ and incorporate the standard BoE short-horizon error band.
