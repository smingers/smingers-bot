Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ONS December-2025 CPI bulletin (19 Jan 26): definitive 3.4 % YoY. High-quality, purely factual.  
2. MoneyWeek (4 Nov 24): combines ONS data to Oct-25 with forecasts from Deutsche Bank & OBR. Useful for direction, moderate quality, somewhat stale.  
3. Morningstar (20 Jan 26): consensus survey & expert quotes. Identifiable economists, recent, good for “street” expectations.  
4. BOE Forecast-Evaluation Report (29 Jan 26): methodological, not forward-looking. Little weight.  
5. AHDB Economic Outlook (Feb 26): cites OBR Nov-25 central projection 2026 avg = 2.5 %. Moderate quality, time-lagged.  
6. Reuters / Investing.com (28 Jan 26): ONS methodological change to grocery scanner data from Feb-26; would have lowered past CPI by -0.03 pp on average. Recent, factual, small quantitative effect.  
7. Misc. Spanish & Indian CPI articles: Not UK-specific; ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Base-effect arithmetic: January & February 25 had high monthly prints. Their removal between now (Dec 25) and March 26 mechanically subtracts ≈ 0.35 pp from the YoY rate.  
• Long UK history: two-month changes in YoY CPI are tightly distributed (σ ≈ 0.30 pp).  
Moderate evidence  
• BOE & OBR central paths (late-25) converge on 2.5 – 3 % for early-/mid-2026.  
• Labour-market slack: pay growth slowing to 3.5 – 4 % and unemployment edging to 5 %—disinflationary but gradual.  
• Future scanner-data tweak probably trims reported CPI by ≈ 0.03 pp from Feb-26 onward.  
Weak evidence  
• Geopolitical energy shocks and trade-war chatter—possible but presently subdued.  
• Opinions of single commentators (Greene, Schulz).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
T₀ = 1 Feb 26; resolution month = March 26 release (to be published 15 Apr 26). Horizon ≈ 2.5 months (74 days).  
If the horizon were halved (mid-March): most February data still missing, uncertainty ↑ ~15 %.  
If doubled (July): new shocks (eg, energy) could dominate, widening σ to ~0.45 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view mode (from reference class) = 3.0 %.  
Adjustments:  
• Base effects −0.35 pp → 2.65 %.  
• Typical Mar seasonality +0.05 pp → 2.70 %.  
• Scanner-data change −0.03 pp → 2.67 %.  
• Energy futures (Brent & UK gas year-ahead both ~10 % y/y lower) −0.05 pp → 2.62 %.  
• Services stickiness (core still 3.2 %) +0.15 pp → 2.77 %.  
Net central forecast ≈ 2.8 %.  
Uncertainty: assume normal, σ = 0.30 pp.  

Subjective distribution  
• 10 % ile = 2.3 %  
• 25 % ile = 2.6 %  
• Median = 2.8 %  
• 75 % ile = 3.0 %  
• 90 % ile = 3.3 %  

Probability calibration
I interpret the required “Probability” line as the chance that the March-2026 CPI 12-month rate lands in the 2.5 – 3.1 % band (±0.3 pp around my point estimate).  
Using the N(μ=2.8, σ=0.30) approximation, P(2.5 ≤ CPI ≤ 3.1) ≈ 64 %.

Checklist:
1. Metric: March-2026 CPI y/y rate (series D7G7), resolved before 1 May 26.  
2. Outside view mean 3.0 %, sd 0.3 %.  
3. “64 out of 100 times, CPI will print between 2.5 % and 3.1 %.”  
4. Key evidence: a) base-effects −0.35 pp; b) BOE/OBR path 2.5–3 %; c) scanner-data tweak −0.03 pp; d) services/core stickiness +0.15 pp.  
5. Blind spot: sharp oil spike (> $120) in Feb-Mar that adds +0.4 pp to CPI.  
6. Status-quo pull checked – small change typical over 2 months, aligns with forecast near present 3.4 % minus base-effects.

Probability: 64%
