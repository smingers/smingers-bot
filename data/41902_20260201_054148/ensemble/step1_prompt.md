# Summary of Bank of England Monetary Policy Report - November 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Current Inflation Data:**
- CPI inflation was 3.8% in August and September 2025
- CPI inflation in September was lower than forecast in the August Monetary Policy Report
- Inflation is judged to have peaked at 3.8%
- The unemployment rate has risen to 4.8%

**Monetary Policy Decision:**
- On November 5, 2025, the MPC voted 5-4 to maintain Bank Rate at 4%
- Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75%
- Bank Rate has been cut five times since August 2024 (from 5.25% to 4%)

**Economic Indicators:**
- Underlying GDP growth remained weak in Q2 2025
- Employment growth has stalled
- Job vacancies have fallen
- Wage growth has continued to decline
- Services price inflation has fallen

## Inflation Forecasts and Projections:

**Official Bank of England View:**
- CPI inflation "is likely to be the peak" at 3.8%
- Inflation is "likely to fall to close to 3% early next year before gradually returning towards to the 2% target over the subsequent year"
- Progress on underlying disinflation continues, supported by restrictive monetary policy stance
- Underlying price and wage pressures have continued to ease

## Key Risks Identified:

**Upside Risks to Inflation:**
- Inflation might remain persistently high if increases in administered prices were repeated
- Cost pressures could remain strong
- Firms might increase profit margins
- The period of high inflation may have affected wage and price determination
- Current wage growth and services price inflation need to fall further to reach 2% target

**Downside Risks to Inflation:**
- Economic activity is below potential
- Risk that households and businesses remain cautious about spending and investment
- Could lead to inflation falling below the 2% target
- Labour market softening could result in more pronounced increases in unemployment
- Household saving rate increased during pandemic and hasn't returned to normal levels

## MPC's Assessment:

The report states that "the risk from greater inflation persistence has become less pronounced recently, and the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand more apparent, such that overall the risks are now more balanced."

The MPC concludes: "If progress on disinflation continues, Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path."

**Note:** This is a policy report containing forward-looking statements and risk assessments from the Bank of England, the UK's central bank and monetary policy authority.

# Summary of Article: "Falling inflation this year should smooth way for more interest rate cuts, says Bank of England policymaker"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Author:** Lauren Almeida

## Key Information Relevant to UK CPI Forecast:

### Named Expert Opinion - Bank of England Policymaker:
- **Alan Taylor** (external member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee) provided specific inflation forecasts and commentary:
  - Predicts a "sharp slowdown in inflation" in 2026
  - Expects inflation to return to the 2% target "by mid 2026"
  - Current UK inflation rate cited as **3.2%** (as of the article date in January 2026)
  - Factors expected to help reduce inflation include:
    - Cooling energy prices
    - Measures to cut living costs from Rachel Reeves's autumn budget
  - Taylor suggests the UK has seen an influx of cheaper goods due to trade diversion from tariff policies, helping to lower inflationary pressures
  - States: "headline UK inflation should fall sharply from the current rate of 3.2% close to 2% by mid-2026"
  - Taylor believes these conditions should enable further interest rate cuts in 2026

### Context:
- The speech was delivered in Singapore on January 14, 2026
- Taylor focused on risks from Donald Trump's tariff wars and geopolitical tensions but gave an "unusually upbeat assessment"
- He argues that over the long term, trade barriers tend to be broken down, which should help keep inflation low

**Note:** The article is primarily a business news roundup covering multiple topics (offshore wind contracts, BP write-downs, Costa Coffee sale, US bank earnings, FTSE 100 performance, Guinness price increases, WEF survey, and Netflix-Warner Bros deal). The inflation-related content appears in the latter portion of the article.

# Summary of Article: Bank of England Policy Setter Warns of Inflation Risk and Slowing Interest Rate Cuts

**Source:** Yahoo Finance  
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Author:** Pedro Goncalves

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Recent UK Inflation Data:**
   - December 2025 headline annual inflation rate: 3.4% (up from 3.2% in November 2025)
   - This was the first rise in the Consumer Price Index since July 2025
   - The increase was slightly above market expectations

2. **Bank of England Interest Rate Actions:**
   - The BoE cut its benchmark interest rate to 3.75% in December 2025
   - This was the fourth rate reduction in 2025

3. **MPC Voting:**
   - Four out of nine Monetary Policy Committee members (including Megan Greene) preferred to keep rates unchanged at the December meeting

## Named Source Opinions:

**Megan Greene (Bank of England Policymaker):**
- Warned that looser US Federal Reserve policy could increase UK inflationary pressures
- Stated: "If this were to materialise, then it would — all else equal — push up on UK inflation"
- Said this "would, in my view, give even greater cause for concern about a risk of UK inflation persistence over that of weaker demand, warranting a slower withdrawal of monetary policy restriction in the UK"
- Indicated she is now "less concerned" than a few months ago that underlying disinflation has slowed
- Continues to place greater weight on inflation persistence than on weaker demand
- Noted that surprise US rate cuts would likely lower UK gilt yields and support equity markets, loosening financial conditions in the UK

**Bank of England (institutional statement):**
- Expects inflation to be closer to its 2% target in April [2026]

## Market Expectations (less reliable/unnamed sources):

- Markets expect both the Federal Reserve and Bank of England to cut interest rates in 2026
- European Central Bank widely expected to keep rates on hold
- Investors have effectively ruled out a BoE rate cut in February 2026
- Expectations have shifted towards April 2026 at the earliest for the next rate cut

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide UK CPI YoY 2010-2025 from ONS D7G7 and summarise latest BoE and OBR forecasts for headline CPI in Q1 2026, including any numeric projections for March 2026.
The extra searches confirm where all three sets of numbers live, but they still do not surface the numbers themselves.

1.  UK CPI (ONS series D7G7) for 2010-2025  
    •  The Time-Series Explorer now lists the series and offers “Download .csv” for the latest release dated 21 Jan 2026 (ONS time-series tool for D7G7, MM23 dataset).  
    •  The CSV is behind one click; none of the snippets shows the 12-month rates for the individual months or the calendar-year averages that the query wants.  
    →  We now know with certainty that the data are available free of charge, but we still have to open the file (or call the ONS API) to read the 16 annual averages.

2.  Bank of England projection for headline CPI in 2026 Q1 and March 2026  
    •  The November-2025 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) page is located, but the on-line HTML stops at narrative; the embedded fan-chart spreadsheet is not exposed (Bank of England, MPR November 2025).  
    •  Secondary coverage (MoneyWeek live blog, 17 Dec 2025) cites “Bank of England projections see CPI … 3.1 % in the first quarter of 2026.”  
    •  No search result shows the single-month point estimate for March 2026, which normally appears in the fan-chart data sheet named “Inflation central-projection”.  
    →  We have a credible central number for Q1 (3.1 %) but still lack the month-specific figure for March 2026.

3.  Office for Budget Responsibility projection for headline CPI in 2026 Q1 and March 2026  
    •  The full November-2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO) PDF is reachable on Scribd but not searchable via snippet; Table 1.1 (Quarterly path for CPI) is therefore still unseen.  
    •  Other hits only quote the OBR’s calendar-year or fiscal-year averages (2.5 % for CY 2026 or FY 2026/27).  
    →  Both the Q1-2026 and March-2026 numbers remain missing.

4.  What we can answer today  
    •  Location and accessibility of each primary source have been pinned down.  
    •  We can quote the Bank’s 3.1 % central projection for Q1 2026 and the OBR’s 2.5 % full-year figure for 2026, duly sourced.  
    •  We cannot yet deliver:  
        – the 16 calendar-year averages of D7G7 (2010-2025)  
        – the Bank’s point estimate for March 2026  
        – the OBR’s quarterly/monthly path for early-2026.

5.  Remaining gaps and how to close them  
    a.  Download ONS CSV for D7G7 and compute/calendar-average the annual rates.  
    b.  Download the “fan-chart data” spreadsheet that accompanies every MPR (sheet: “Inflation central-projection”, row for Mar-2026).  
    c.  Open Table 1.1 of the OBR November-2025 EFO (or the associated ‘EFO supplementary tables’) to read CPI for 2026 Q1 and the monthly profile.

6.  Follow-up search queries likely to surface the missing numeric cells  
    •  bank of england fan chart data  
    •  obr efo november 2025 table 1.1  
    •  ons api d7g7 csv  
    •  inflation central-projection mpr csv  
    •  obr supplementary tables cpi quarterly

**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
