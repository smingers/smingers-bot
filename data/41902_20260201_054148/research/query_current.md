Analysis:
The question asks for the 12-month (year-over-year) UK CPI inflation rate that the ONS will publish for March 2026.  To anchor a forecast we need up-to-date information on:
• Bank of England projections (February 2026 Monetary Policy Report, rate-setting speeches, fan charts).  
• Recent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) or HM Treasury comparison of independent forecasts.  
• Market-implied breakevens, private-sector forecasts (banks, consultancies) covering early-2026 inflation.  
• January–March 2026 high-frequency price indicators (energy futures, Ofgem price cap path, food commodity prices, sterling trade-weighted index).  
News/articles providing those data points, especially any updates since the January 2026 CPI release (published 19 Feb 2026), will help refine an inside-view estimate for March.  Therefore the searches below target the latest BoE/OBR documents and professional-forecaster commentary that explicitly mention spring-2026 CPI numbers.
