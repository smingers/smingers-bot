The new CPI series, based on the 2023-24 Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES), introduces a revised inflation basket with 358 items\u2014up from 299\u2014reflecting changing consumption patterns. Key changes include reducing the weight of food and beverages from 54% to 37%, expanding rural and urban market coverage by 25%, and including new items such as rural house rent, OTT services, international air travel, and CNG/PNG. Methodologies for handling missing prices, house rent, electricity, and elementary indices have been refined, and centrally administered prices (e.g., rail fares, fuel, LPG, postal charges) will be compiled using administrative data. Online data will be used for telecom, OTT, and airfares, with e-commerce prices tracked in 12 major cities. The CPI will adopt the UNSD's COICOP 2018 classification for global comparability. A chain-weighted approach is not fully implemented, but the Jevons index\u2014a chain-price method\u2014is used to reduce base-year bias and improve handling of missing prices and item replacement. MoSPI will not publish core inflation but will release granular item-level data and weights for users, including the RBI, to compute their own measures. For GDP, the base year shifts to 2022-23, replacing the 2011-12 base. The household sector will now be estimated using annual data from the Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), replacing proxy indicators. Double deflation will be introduced in manufacturing and agriculture, and Supply Use Tables will be integrated into the national accounts framework to reduce discrepancies. Greater use of MCA MGT-7, GST, PFMS, and e-Vahan databases enhances sectoral coverage and data reliability. MoSPI also addresses IMF concerns regarding outdated base years, single deflation, estimation gaps, and proxy reliance\u2014issues being mitigated through updated methodologies. The e-Sankhyiki portal will be updated for seamless data release on February 12, 2026, and pre-release workshops have been conducted in Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai. Field staff have been trained, and trial runs are underway to ensure data accuracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:04 AM\nSource:[The New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2026/Feb/01/new-inflation-tracking-method-reduces-base-year-bias-improves-handling-of-missing-prices)\n\n**New Consumer Price Index (CPI) series**\nThe Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) series for India, revising the base year from 2011-12 to 2023-24 and reducing the weight of food and beverages from approximately 46% to 37%. The updated CPI series is constructed using data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023-24, with an expanded item basket increasing from 299 to 358 items. Key improvements include the inclusion of e-commerce prices for airfares, OTT subscriptions, and telecom plans in the House Rent Index, and enhanced methodology to better reflect current consumption patterns, particularly in digital services. The new CPI serves as India's headline inflation measure and anchors the country's inflation targeting framework. The change aligns with standard international practice of periodic base-year revisions to maintain accuracy. The revised series is expected to improve inflation measurement credibility, reduce noise from supply-side shocks in food prices, and better reflect India's structural shift from food-dominated to housing- and services-led consumption. The nodal ministry responsible is MoSPI, and the data source is the HCES 2023-24.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:43 AM\nSource:[INSIGHTSIAS](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2026/01/31/new-consumer-price-index-cpi-series/)\n\n**New CPI series cuts food weight, after base year revision**\nThe Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) has released documents outlining a major revision of India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) series, effective from January 2026. The new CPI series, based on the 2023-24 Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES), revises the base year from 2011-12 to 2023-24, reflecting updated household consumption patterns. The weight of food and beverages in the CPI basket will decrease from 45.86% to 36.75%, with food alone accounting for 34.77% and beverages for 1.77%. This reduction aims to lower inflation volatility, as food price fluctuations previously had a disproportionate impact on overall inflation. The new series shows lower food expenditure: rural households now spend 47.04% (down from 52.9%) and urban households 39.68% (down from 42.62%) of their monthly per capita consumption expenditure on food. Conversely, housing, water, electricity, and gas will rise from 10.07% to 17.66% in the basket, with house rent coverage expanded to rural areas for the first time. Other categories include transport (8.79%), clothing and footwear (6.38%), and health (6.10%). For the first time, the CPI will include prices from e-commerce platforms such as airfares, OTT services (Netflix, Amazon Prime), and telecom plans. The new series increases the number of items from 299 to 358 and expands the sample to 1,465 rural markets and 1,395 urban markets across 434 towns, with 12 online markets added in cities with populations over 2.5 million. The new CPI will be used for the first time to calculate January 2026 inflation data, to be released in February 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:49 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/food/new-cpi-series-cuts-food-weight-after-base-year-revision)\n\n**Year-on-year inflation slows to 1.9% in January**\nThe Portuguese National Institute of Statistics (INE) reported that the year-on-year inflation rate for January 2026 decreased to 1.9%, a reduction of 0.3 percentage points from the 2.2% recorded in December 2025. In month-on-month terms, the Consumer Price Index (IPC) fell by 0.7% compared to December, indicating a downward trend in prices at the start of the year.

This decrease, five tenths of a percentage point lower than December's rate, was primarily driven by a moderation in electricity price increases and a decline in fuel prices. The INE described this as the largest drop in inflation since March 2025 and noted that it marks the most moderate inflation level since June 2025, when the IPC stood at 2.3%. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, remained stable at 2.6% for the third consecutive month and has not exceeded the general IPC since May 2025. The Ministry of Economy stated that inflation continues to moderate in line with the European Central Bank\u2019s target of maintaining price stability near 2%, allowing households to retain purchasing power. In monthly terms, consumer prices fell by 0.4% compared to December. The harmonized index (IPCA) showed an annual rate of 2.5%, down five tenths, with a core rate of 2.8% and a monthly decrease of 0.7%. The INE emphasized that these are the first IPC figures under the new 2025 base, which includes 13 major groups (up from 12), updated basket of goods, revised weights, and new methodological adjustments. New products included are avocados, blueberries, tea-based soft drinks, lemon beer, and X-rays; discontinued items include ties and handkerchiefs.

This marks the third consecutive month of declining inflation, following a peak of 3.1% in October 2025, the highest in 16 months. The decline is primarily attributed to falling prices for vehicle fuels and lubricants compared to January 2025, as well as a slower increase in electricity prices. The Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Enterprise highlighted that this was the sharpest drop in inflation since March 2025 and reflects ongoing moderation in prices, aligning with the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) target of keeping inflation near 2%. The ministry noted this trend helps preserve household purchasing power. The underlying inflation rate (excluding non-processed food and energy products) remained stable at 2.6% for the third consecutive month, the highest since December 2024. On a monthly basis, the IPC fell by 0.4% in January 2026 compared to December 2025\u2014the largest monthly decline since September 2024, when it dropped by 0.6%. The harmonized IPC (IPCA) also decreased by five-tenths to 2.5% annually, with a monthly drop of 0.7%. The underlying IPCA inflation is estimated at 2.8% for January.

The preliminary data, released by the National Statistics Institute (INE) on January 30, 2026, will be officially confirmed on February 13, 2026. This marks the largest moderation in the annual inflation rate since March 2025, driven primarily by the energy sector, which offset increases in food and service prices. The IPC has now recorded three consecutive monthly declines since its peak in October 2025. Meanwhile, the underlying inflation rate\u2014excluding volatile energy and non-manufactured food prices\u2014remained unchanged at 2.6% for the third consecutive month, holding its highest level since December 2024.

This marks the third consecutive month of declining inflation, following a peak of 3.1% in October 2025, the highest in 16 months. The decline is primarily attributed to lower prices for vehicle fuels and lubricants compared to January 2025, as well as a slower increase in electricity prices. The Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Enterprise noted that this was the sharpest drop in inflation since March 2025, indicating ongoing moderation in prices in line with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of stable inflation near 2%. The ministry emphasized that this trend helps preserve household purchasing power. The underlying inflation rate (excluding non-processed food and energy products) remained unchanged at 2.6% for the third consecutive month, the highest level since December 2024. On a monthly basis, the IPC fell by 0.4% in January 2026 compared to December 2025\u2014the largest monthly drop since September 2024, when it declined by 0.6%. The harmonized consumer price index (IPCA) also decreased by five tenths to 2.5% annually, with a monthly drop of 0.7%. The underlying IPCA inflation is estimated at 2.8% for January.

The new approach uses supermarket scanner data, along with revised sampling methods for hotel accommodation and video game prices. According to ONS, if the supermarket scanner data had been used from January 2019 to June 2025, it would have reduced the average CPI inflation rate by 0.03 percentage points, with a difference of up to 0.1 percentage points in 39 out of 66 months.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 10:36 AM\nSource:[JP](https://jp.reuters.com/markets/japan/7VSNYZTE6VKMLDYH3CHJBNRNLA-2026-01-28/)\n\n**UK statistics office's grocery price changes likely to lower CPI rate slightly By Reuters**\nThe UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) plans to implement changes in February 2026 to how it collects grocery price data, including the use of supermarket scanner data, and will also revise its sampling methods for overnight hotel stays and video games. According to the ONS, if the new grocery scanner data had been used between January 2019 and June 2025, it would have lowered the average Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate by 0.03 percentage points. Additionally, it would have caused a 0.1 percentage point difference in the published CPI rate in 39 out of 66 months, the ONS stated.

According to the ONS, applying the new method retroactively between January 2019 and June 2025 would have resulted in a 0.1 percentage point difference in the published inflation rate in 39 out of 66 months. The new approach would have reduced the reported consumer price inflation rate by 0.03 percentage points if applied previously. In addition to grocery data, the ONS will also revise its sampling methods for overnight hotel stays and video games, with these changes taking effect in the February 2026 inflation data release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 09:49 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/uks-ons-to-implement-grocery-price-data-collection-changes-93CH-4469469)\n\n**UK wage increase update as cost of living crisis rumbles on - Manchester Evening News**\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UK regular earnings grew by 4.6% over the three months to October 2025, marking a slowdown from previous months. However, this still exceeds the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate, resulting in a real-terms earnings growth of 0.9%. This indicates that, despite the deceleration, average workers' spending power has marginally improved. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.1% in the three months to October, up from 5.0% in the prior period, reflecting a weakening labor market. The ONS reported a decline in payroll numbers and subdued hiring activity, with the drop in employment particularly notable among younger age groups. Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, stated that the data reflects 'a weakening labour market' and noted that job vacancies remained broadly flat. The combination of falling payroll numbers, rising unemployment, and flat vacancies signals ongoing economic pressure despite modest real-terms wage gains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 07:40 AM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/uk-wage-increase-update-cost-33063758)\n\n**UK Consumer Price Index Rises 3.8% Year-on-Year in September 2025, Monthly Change Stable**\nThe UK's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.8% year-on-year in September 2025, remaining unchanged from August 2025, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on October 22, 2025. On a monthly basis, CPI increased by 0.1% in September 2025, matching the same period in 2024. The year-on-year rise was driven by increases in transportation and housing prices, while declines in entertainment and culture, and food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the overall inflation. Core CPI (excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco) rose 3.5% year-on-year, slightly down from 3.6% in August 2025. Goods CPI rose slightly from 2.8% to 2.9%, while services CPI remained stable at 4.7%. The Bank of England continues to grapple with rising inflation and weak economic growth, maintaining its base interest rate at 4%. Financial market traders estimate a 70% probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut in December 2025. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate fell to $1.33, and the two-year UK government bond yield dropped 0.11 percentage points to 3.75%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=ada67ed7-d6c8-4d40-bb91-b8f8bd40bef8)\n\n**Inflation remains at 3.8% but food outstrips CPI - Retail Gazette**\nThe UK's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate remained stable at 3.8% for the 12 months ending September 2025, unchanged from August 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Monthly CPI rose 0.3% in August, matching the same rate in August\u202f2024. Air fares made the largest downward contribution to the monthly change, while restaurants, hotels and motor fuels added large, partially offsetting, upward contributions. Core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food, was 3.6% in the 12 months to August, down from 3.8% in July and in line with forecasts. Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI, said 'Inflation remained elevated in August, consistent with the Bank of England\u2019s projections. Higher food and energy prices, alongside the passthrough from increased labour costs, are expected to keep price growth firm in the near term.' He added that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow and that its November decision will hinge on whether future data give the MPC confidence that a further cut will not contribute to inflation staying elevated for longer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 08:33 AM\nSource:[eastmidlandsbusinesslink.co.uk](https://www.eastmidlandsbusinesslink.co.uk/mag/news/uk-inflation-stood-stubborn-at-3-8-in-august/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nWe have conducted a search for the latest projections of UK CPI inflation for March 2026 from the Bank of England (BoE), the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and major banks. Here is a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)**: \n   - In its November 2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the OBR projected that the annual average CPI inflation for 2026 would be 2.5% [14][17]. However, the OBR did not provide a specific projection for March 2026 in the documents we reviewed.\n\n2. **Bank of England (BoE)**:\n   - We did not find any explicit projections for March 2026 CPI inflation from the Bank of England in the available search results. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been focusing on interest rate decisions and economic growth, but without a specific inflation projection for March 2026 in the documents we found [11][12][19].\n\n3. **Major Banks**:\n   - Our search did not yield any projections for March 2026 CPI inflation from major banks in the results.\n\n**Context and Limitations**: \n- The available projections are from late 2025 (November) and do not include more recent updates (e.g., January or February 2026) that might have been released. \n- The projections we found (such as the OBR's annual average for 2026) are not broken down by month, so we cannot derive a specific March 2026 figure from them.\n- It is possible that more specific projections for March 2026 exist but were not captured in our search.\n\nGiven the above, we must conclude that the search results do not contain explicit projections for UK CPI inflation in March 2026 from the requested sources. If more recent projections have been released, they were not found in the search.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
