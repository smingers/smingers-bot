These tables complement the consumer price inflation time series dataset.\n\n2. **Accessibility Initiative**: The ONS has published sample versions of consumer price inflation tables following GSS (Government Statistical Service) guidance on releasing statistics in spreadsheets. The goal is to improve usability, accessibility, and machine readability of published statistics.\n\n3. **Format Transition**: The ONS plans to change the format of consumer price inflation tables over the coming months. During this transition, tables will be published in both new and current formats, with a mapper tool to help users navigate the new format.\n\n4. **Interactive Tool**: The ONS has published a Personal Inflation Calculator that allows individuals to enter their spending amounts across different categories to estimate their personal inflation rate based on their spending patterns.\n\n5. **Contact Information**: \n   - Email: cpi@ons.gov.uk\n   - Consumer Price Inflation Enquiries phone: +44 1633 456900\n   - Recorded message (available after 8 am on release day): +44 808 196 1267\n\n**Note**: This article does not contain any actual CPI data, forecasts, statistics, or expert opinions about future inflation rates.

Bank of England Policymaker:\n- **Alan Taylor** (external member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee) provided specific inflation forecasts and commentary:\n  - Predicts a \"sharp slowdown in inflation\" in 2026\n  - Expects inflation to return to the 2% target \"by mid 2026\"\n  - Current UK inflation rate cited as **3.2%** (as of the article date in January 2026)\n  - Factors expected to help reduce inflation include:\n    - Cooling energy prices\n    - Measures to cut living costs from Rachel Reeves's autumn budget\n  - Taylor suggests the UK has seen an influx of cheaper goods due to trade diversion from tariff policies, helping to lower inflationary pressures\n  - States: \"headline UK inflation should fall sharply from the current rate of 3.2% close to 2% by mid-2026\"\n  - Taylor believes these conditions should enable further interest rate cuts in 2026\n\n### Context:\n- The speech was delivered in Singapore on January 14, 2026\n- Taylor focused on risks from Donald Trump's tariff wars and geopolitical tensions but gave an \"unusually upbeat assessment\"\n- He argues that over the long term, trade barriers tend to be broken down, which should help keep inflation low\n\n**Note:** The article is primarily a business news roundup covering multiple topics (offshore wind contracts, BP write-downs, Costa Coffee sale, US bank earnings, FTSE 100 performance, Guinness price increases, WEF survey, and Netflix-Warner Bros deal).

UK CPI (ONS series D7G7) for 2010-2025  \n    \u2022  The Time-Series Explorer now lists the series and offers \u201cDownload .csv\u201d for the latest release dated 21 Jan 2026 (ONS time-series tool for D7G7, MM23 dataset).  \n    \u2022  The CSV is behind one click; none of the snippets shows the 12-month rates for the individual months or the calendar-year averages that the query wants.  \n    \u2192  We now know with certainty that the data are available free of charge, but we still have to open the file (or call the ONS API) to read the 16 annual averages.\n\n2.  Bank of England projection for headline CPI in 2026 Q1 and March 2026  \n    \u2022  The November-2025 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) page is located, but the on-line HTML stops at narrative; the embedded fan-chart spreadsheet is not exposed (Bank of England, MPR November 2025).  \n    \u2022  Secondary coverage (MoneyWeek live blog, 17 Dec 2025) cites \u201cBank of England projections see CPI \u2026 3.1 % in the first quarter of 2026.\u201d  \n    \u2022  No search result shows the single-month point estimate for March 2026, which normally appears in the fan-chart data sheet named \u201cInflation central-projection\u201d.  \n    \u2192  We have a credible central number for Q1 (3.1 %) but still lack the month-specific figure for March 2026.\n\n3.  Office for Budget Responsibility projection for headline CPI in 2026 Q1 and March 2026  \n    \u2022  The full November-2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO) PDF is reachable on Scribd but not searchable via snippet; Table 1.1 (Quarterly path for CPI) is therefore still unseen.  \n    \u2022  Other hits only quote the OBR\u2019s calendar-year or fiscal-year averages (2.5 % for CY 2026 or FY 2026/27).  \n    \u2192  Both the Q1-2026 and March-2026 numbers remain missing.\n\n4.  What we can answer today  \n    \u2022  Location and accessibility of each primary source have been pinned down.  \n    \u2022  We can quote the Bank\u2019s 3.1 % central projection for Q1 2026 and the OBR\u2019s 2.5 % full-year figure for 2026, duly sourced.  \n    \u2022  We cannot yet deliver:  \n        \u2013 the 16 calendar-year averages of D7G7 (2010-2025)  \n        \u2013 the Bank\u2019s point estimate for March 2026  \n        \u2013 the OBR\u2019s quarterly/monthly path for early-2026.\n\n5.
