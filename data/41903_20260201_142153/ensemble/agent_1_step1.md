- **Quality:** High-quality journalism with named expert sources (Matthew Savill from RUSI, John Herbst from Atlantic Council, Olga Ivshina)
- **Key Facts:** All major ceasefires (Minsk I, Minsk II, Easter truces, school ceasefires) failed within hours or minutes; Easter 2025 truce lasted only 30 hours
- **Expert Opinion:** Matthew Savill states Russia "has never been sincere" about ceasefires; John Herbst identifies Russia as "serial violator"
- **Assessment:** Factual historical record is robust; expert consensus clearly identifies pattern of Russian bad faith

**PILPG Article:**
- **Summary:** Description of preparatory materials for Ukraine's ceasefire negotiation planning
- **Quality:** Organizational webpage describing resources, not analytical content

- **Key Facts:** Jared Kushner calls Tuesday a "milestone" but warns peace "not imminent"; UK-France Declaration of Intent signed; Russia repeatedly rejected NATO troop deployments
- **Assessment:** Shows progress on security architecture but no ceasefire agreement; Kushner's "milestone" statement tempered by "not imminent" qualifier

**Euronews Article (January 7, 2026):**
- **Summary:** Third session of talks focusing on "most difficult issues"
- **Quality:** Current reporting with official statements
- **Key Facts:** Discussions on Zaporizhzhia plant and eastern territory control; Budanov mentions "concrete results" but won't disclose details; Putin opposes NATO troops; Moscow's position "far from clear"

**Agent Report:**
- **Summary:** Comprehensive timeline from Nov 2023 to Feb 1, 2026 of ceasefire diplomacy
- **Quality:** Detailed synthesis with specific dates and sources referenced
- **Key Facts:** Every ceasefire pathway blocked by (1) Moscow's territorial/neutrality demands or (2) Kyiv's refusal without security guarantees; June 2025 Russian memorandum demanded Ukrainian withdrawal from four oblasts; leaked Nov 2025 U.S. draft rejected by EU; Jan 30, 2026 one-week Kyiv pause violated immediately
- **Assessment:** Excellent synthesis showing systematic pattern of failed negotiations; identifies structural impediments

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Historical Russia-Ukraine ceasefire attempts (2014-2025):**
   - Most relevant: Same parties, same conflict
   - Data: BBC documents 25+ failed ceasefires; Minsk I failed within hours; Minsk II failed within minutes; Easter truces consistently violated
   - Base rate: 0% success rate for ceasefires intended to last 30+ days
   - Suitability: HIGH - directly applicable

2. **Post-2022 invasion ceasefire attempts:**
   - Narrower timeframe focusing on current phase
   - Data: Agent report shows no successful ceasefire since Feb 2022; Jan 2026 Kyiv pause violated immediately
   - Base rate: 0% success rate
   - Suitability: VERY HIGH - most directly relevant to current situation

3. **International ceasefires in active conflicts (general):**
   - Broader category including Syria, Yemen, Colombia
   - PILPG references these as case studies
   - Suitability: MODERATE - less specific to Russia-Ukraine dynamics

4. **Ceasefires where one party maintains territorial control and military superiority:**
   - Harvard article emphasizes this dynamic
   - Historical pattern: Difficult to achieve without military stalemate or exhaustion
   - Suitability: HIGH - captures structural impediment

**Selected Reference Class:** Post-2022 Russia-Ukraine ceasefire attempts, supplemented by 2014-2025 historical pattern

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 89 days (February 1, 2026 to May 1, 2026)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**

- **90-day windows in 2024-2025:** Agent report shows multiple 3-month periods with negotiations but zero successful ceasefires
- **Jan-Apr 2024:** "No verifiable trilateral or multilateral cease-fire meetings"
- **Recent 3-month period (Nov 2025-Jan 2026):** Leaked U.S. draft, EU rejection, Abu Dhabi talks, but no ceasefire agreement
- **Most recent attempt (Jan 29-30, 2026):** One-week Kyiv pause announced, immediately violated with 111 drone launches

**Seasonal Factors:**
- Timeframe includes Orthodox Easter (April 2026)
- Historical pattern: Easter truces in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2025 all failed
- No evidence Easter timing increases ceasefire success probability

## (d) Justification

**Structural Impediments:**

1. **Incompatible Core Demands:**
   - Russia (June 2025 memorandum): Ukrainian withdrawal from four annexed oblasts, neutrality, demilitarization
   - Ukraine (consistent position): No ceasefire without binding security guarantees, no territorial concessions
   - Gap unbridged despite 26+ months of negotiations

2. **Historical Pattern of Bad Faith:**
   - 25+ documented ceasefire violations by Russia since 2014
   - Expert consensus (Savill, Herbst) that Russia never negotiates ceasefires in good faith
   - Most recent example: Jan 30, 2026 pause violated within 24 hours

3. **Current Negotiating Dynamics:**
   - As of Feb 1, 2026: Paris talks show progress on security architecture but Starmer states "hardest yards still ahead"
   - Putin described as "not showing he is ready for peace"
   - Moscow's position "far from clear" and insists on comprehensive settlement before ceasefire
   - Abu Dhabi follow-up round postponed

4. **Definition Requirements:**
   - Question requires ceasefire "intended to last minimum of 30 days"
   - Even short tactical pauses (Easter 2025: 30 hours; Jan 2026: <24 hours) have failed
   - No ceasefire in conflict history has lasted 30+ days since 2014

5. **Time Constraint:**
   - Only 89 days remaining
   - Agent report shows ceasefire negotiations typically require months of groundwork
   - Current talks still addressing "most difficult issues" (territorial control, Zaporizhzhia)

**Positive Indicators (Weak):**
- Paris meetings show continued engagement
- UK-France military hub commitments could provide security framework
- U.S. involvement through Kushner/Witkoff

**Counter-Evidence Assessment:**
- Kushner's "milestone" language contradicted by "not imminent" qualifier
- "Concrete results" mentioned by Budanov but not disclosed, suggesting limited scope
- Security guarantees framework ≠ ceasefire agreement
- European troop deployments require parliamentary approvals, extending timeline

**Expert Opinion Synthesis:**
- Matthew Savill (RUSI): Russia never sincere about ceasefires
- Harvard analysis: Military possession trumps diplomacy
- Belfer Center: U.S. draft "structurally vulnerable to Russian manipulation"
- French FM Barrot: "Peace cannot be considered until ceasefire in effect" (circular problem)

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring Considerations:**

1. **Historical Base Rate:** 0% success rate for 30+ day ceasefires in Russia-Ukraine conflict (2014-2026)

2. **Recent Trajectory:** Negative momentum - Jan 2026 pause lasted <24 hours, shortest attempt on record

3. **Structural Analysis:** Two insurmountable obstacles (territorial demands vs. security requirements) with no convergence mechanism

4. **Time Pressure:** 89 days is insufficient given:
   - Current talks still on "most difficult issues"
   - Parliamentary approvals needed for security guarantees
   - No draft ceasefire text publicly acknowledged
   - Historical pattern shows even tactical pauses take weeks to negotiate

5. **Expert Consensus:** Unanimous skepticism about Russian good faith; structural impediments identified

**Calibration Reasoning:**

- Pure historical base rate suggests 0-1%
- However, unprecedented factors warrant slight upward adjustment:
  - Highest-level U.S. engagement (Trump administration priority)
  - European security architecture taking shape
  - Both sides economically strained after 3 years of war
  
- Counterbalancing factors:
  - Most recent attempt (Jan 2026) failed faster than any previous attempt
  - Russia's June 2025 demands show maximalist position unchanged
  - No evidence of Russian military exhaustion forcing compromise
  - Definition requires 30-day intention (high bar given historical violations)

**Probability Calculation:**

- Base rate: 0-1% (historical failure rate)
- Adjustment for current engagement: +2-3%
- Adjustment for structural impediments: -1-2%
- Adjustment for time constraint (89 days): -0.5-1%
- Adjustment for recent negative trajectory: -0.5-1%

**Final Calibration:** The question asks specifically about a signed agreement with 30-day minimum intention. Even if talks produce a framework, the probability of Russia signing such an agreement (given historical pattern and current demands) remains extremely low. The Jan 2026 violation of a one-week pause suggests Russia won't commit to 30-day intentions.
