**AskNews Articles (Jan 29-31, 2026):**

*Energy Ceasefire Reports (Jan 29-31):*
- **Multiple sources** (Glavcom, URA.RU, Dagospia, RBC, Phoenix, RIA Novosti, etc.) report "energy ceasefire" until Feb 1, 2026
- **Quality:** Mix of Ukrainian, Russian, Italian, Chinese sources; dates Jan 29-31
- **Key Facts:** Trump personally requested Putin halt strikes on Kyiv/infrastructure for one week; Putin agreed until Feb 1; Kremlin's Peskov confirmed; Zelenskyy confirmed Ukraine won't strike Russian energy if Russia stops; **ceasefire ends Feb 1, coinciding with severe cold**
- **Critical Detail:** This is a **one-week tactical pause on energy infrastructure only**, NOT a comprehensive ceasefire. Russian military bloggers report ban on striking Kyiv/infrastructure but not other targets
- **Assessment:** STRONG evidence of limited tactical pause, NOT the 30-day bilateral ceasefire required by resolution criteria

*Abu Dhabi Talks (Jan 31, 2026):*
- **RBC (Russian source):** Second round scheduled Feb 1, 2026; bilateral Russia-Ukraine with US observation; first round (Jan 23-24) was trilateral; "qualitative change" in Russian delegation but territorial disputes remain central
- **Quality:** Russian state-affiliated but detailed reporting
- **Key Facts:** Energy ceasefire Jan 29-Feb 1 precedes talks; Ukraine faces "worst winter energy shortage since war began"; Rubio confirms territorial issues (Crimea, Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson) are central
- **Assessment:** Talks ongoing but no indication of imminent comprehensive ceasefire agreement

*Zelenskyy Statements (Jan 30, 2026):*
- **Multiple Chinese sources** (Phoenix, Securities Times): Zelenskyy says US-Ukraine security agreement must be signed BEFORE peace deal with Russia; Ukraine demands right to 800,000-strong military and adequate weapons post-ceasefire
- **Assessment:** Shows Ukraine prioritizing security guarantees over immediate ceasefire; sequencing issue delays comprehensive agreement

*Historical Context (Oct-Dec 2025):*
- **Dostor (Nov 21, 2025):** Ukrainian officials expected ceasefire before Nov 27 under US pressure (28-point plan)—this did not happen
- **El Comercio/Noticias ao Minuto (Dec 12, 2025):** Kremlin suspects Zelenskyy only agreeing to elections as tactic for ceasefire; Russia rejects truce, wants "peace not truce"
- **Daily Economic News (Dec 11, 2025):** Zelenskyy insists ceasefire must precede formal agreement; Russia won't agree without framework agreement first (circular problem)
- **Assessment:** Pattern of failed predictions and circular negotiating positions

*Olympics Truce (Oct 10, 2025):*
- **Dialog.UA:** Ukraine agreed to ceasefire during 2026 Winter Olympics (Feb 6-22, 2026)—but spokesperson warned Russia invaded Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014) during Olympics
- **Assessment:** Proposed but highly uncertain given historical pattern

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG Evidence (Large Shifts):**

1. **Energy ceasefire structure contradicts resolution criteria** (Multiple independent sources: Kremlin/Peskov, Zelenskyy, Trump, Russian/Ukrainian/Western media)
   - Confirmed: One-week pause on **energy infrastructure only**, ending Feb 1, 2026
   - Does NOT meet resolution criteria: Not "bilateral ceasefire" of all hostilities; not intended for 30+ days; explicitly temporary until talks
   - **Direction:** Strongly negative—demonstrates what parties CAN agree to falls far short of required criteria

2. **Sequencing deadlock confirmed by multiple officials** (Zelenskyy Jan 30, Rubio, RBC analysis)
   - Ukraine: Security agreement must come BEFORE ceasefire
   - Russia: Framework agreement must come BEFORE ceasefire  
   - US: Believes only framework enables ceasefire
   - **Causal mechanism:** Each party conditions ceasefire on prerequisites the other rejects
   - **Direction:** Strongly negative—structural impediment to 30-day ceasefire agreement

3. **Territorial demands unchanged despite negotiations** (Putin Oct/Jan proposals, Kremlin positions, Lavrov statements)
   - Russia still demands Ukrainian withdrawal from annexed oblasts (beyond current frontlines)
   - Ukraine rejects any formal territorial concessions
   - Oct 2025 Budapest cancellation shows Trump rejected Putin's maximalist demands
   - **Historical pattern:** 25+ failed ceasefires with same dynamic (per outside view)
   - **Direction:** Strongly negative—core incompatibility persists

**MODERATE Evidence:**

4. **Feb 1 Abu Dhabi talks represent continued engagement** (RBC, PBS, Al Jazeera)
   - Second bilateral round with US observation
   - "Qualitative change" in Russian delegation per Ukrainian officials
   - Discusses ceasefire parameters, monitoring mechanisms
   - **Counter-evidence:** First round (Jan 23-24) produced no deal; "fundamental differences" acknowledged
   - **Direction:** Slightly positive but insufficient to overcome structural barriers

5. **Recent diplomatic failures accelerating** (Democracy Now Jan 30, Guardian Oct 21)
   - Budapest summit canceled Oct 21, 2025
   - Second Budapest summit canceled Jan 30, 2026 (Trump: "wasted meeting")
   - Pattern: Higher-level engagement producing faster failures
   - **Direction:** Negative—suggests diminishing returns from diplomacy

6. **Winter Olympics ceasefire proposal (Feb 6-22, 2026)** (Dialog.UA Oct 10)
   - Ukraine agreed to Italy's proposal
   - Falls within prediction timeframe
   - **Counter-evidence:** Ukrainian spokesperson warned Russia violated Olympic truces in 2008, 2014
   - **Direction:** Weak positive—low probability given historical pattern, but non-zero

**WEAK Evidence:**

7. **Failed Nov 27, 2025 prediction** (Dostor Nov 21)
   - Egyptian media reported Ukrainian officials expected ceasefire before Nov 27 under US pressure
   - Did not materialize
   - **Direction:** Demonstrates unreliability of "expected soon" reports; calibrates against overconfidence

8. **European stabilization force plans** (Guardian Oct 21)
   - 30 countries (led by UK/France) agreed to provide multinational force
   - Could enable ceasefire monitoring
   - **Counter-evidence:** Requires parliamentary approvals; Russia opposes NATO troops
   - **Direction:** Weak positive—necessary but insufficient condition; timeline extends beyond May 1

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 89 days (Feb 1 to May 1, 2026)

**Current Trajectory:**
- Feb 1: Abu Dhabi talks begin (TODAY per article dates)
- Feb 1: Energy ceasefire expires
- Feb 6-22: Winter Olympics (potential ceasefire window)
- May 1: Resolution deadline

**If timeframe HALVED (45 days, to ~March 17):**
- Probability would DROP to 1-2%
- Rationale: Insufficient time for security agreement ratification (Zelenskyy's prerequisite), parliamentary approvals for European force, comprehensive framework negotiation
- Olympics window (Feb 6-22) would be only realistic opportunity

**If timeframe DOUBLED (178 days, to ~August 1):**
- Probability would INCREASE to 8-12%
- Rationale: Allows time for (a) security agreement Congressional approval, (b) framework agreement negotiation, (c) potential military stalemate forcing compromise, (d) multiple negotiation rounds
- Spring 2026 offensive outcomes could shift calculus
- However, still constrained by structural incompatibility on territory

**Seasonal Factors:**
- Winter Olympics (Feb 6-22): Proposed ceasefire window but historically violated
- Orthodox Easter 2026 (April 19-20): Historical pattern shows Easter truces fail
- Spring offensive season (March-May): Typically increases hostilities, not conducive to ceasefire

## (d) Justification

**Factors Shifting from 3% Outside View:**

**NEGATIVE Shifts (-2 to -3%):**

1. **Energy ceasefire reveals negotiating ceiling** (STRONG evidence)
   - Parties demonstrated they CAN negotiate limited pauses (one week, infrastructure-only)
   - What they ACHIEVED falls dramatically short of resolution criteria (30-day bilateral ceasefire)
   - Analogy: If a couple can only agree to sleep in separate rooms for one night, predicting they'll agree to a month-long separation is less likely, not more
   - **Impact:** -1.5%

2. **Sequencing deadlock is formalized** (STRONG evidence)
   - Unlike vague "incompatible positions," now have explicit statements that each side conditions ceasefire on prerequisites
   - Ukraine: Security agreement first (requires Congressional approval, weeks minimum)
   - Russia: Framework agreement first (territorial settlement, no timeline)
   - Circular dependency with no resolution mechanism
   - **Impact:** -1%

3. **Recent acceleration of diplomatic failures** (MODERATE evidence)
   - Two Budapest summit cancellations (Oct 2025, Jan 2026)
   - Energy ceasefire is SHORTEST pause achieved (one week vs. past Easter truces of 30+ hours)
   - Trend: More engagement producing less substantive agreements
   - **Impact:** -0.5%

**POSITIVE Shifts (+1 to +2%):**

4. **Unprecedented US presidential engagement** (MODERATE evidence)
   - Trump personally negotiated energy ceasefire with Putin
   - US mediating Feb 1 talks in Abu Dhabi
   - Higher stakes than previous attempts (2024 had "no verifiable trilateral meetings")
   - **Counter:** Oct/Jan Budapest cancellations show Trump engagement insufficient
   - **Impact:** +0.5%

5. **Olympics ceasefire window (Feb 6-22)** (WEAK-MODERATE evidence)
   - Ukraine formally agreed to Italy's proposal
   - 16-day window within prediction timeframe
   - International pressure/monitoring
   - **Counter:** Russia violated Olympic truces in 2008, 2014; Ukrainian officials warned of this pattern
   - **Probability Olympics ceasefire happens:** 10-15%
   - **Probability it meets 30-day intention criteria:** 30-40% (if it happens)
   - **Combined contribution:** 10% × 35% = 3.5% → rounds to +1% given other uncertainties
   - **Impact:** +1%

6. **"Qualitative change" in Russian delegation** (WEAK evidence)
   - Ukrainian officials noted more substantive military discussions
   - Could indicate Russian seriousness
   - **Counter:** No concrete outcomes from first round; "fundamental differences" persist
   - **Impact:** +0.3%

**Net Adjustment:** -2.7% from 3% base = 0.3%

**Calibration Check:**
- 0.3% implies 1-in-333 odds
- Does this align with evidence? 
  - Energy ceasefire shows parties can negotiate but only achieve 1-week, limited-scope pauses
  - Sequencing deadlock has no clear resolution path within 89 days
  - Olympics window provides non-zero probability but historical violations pattern is strong
  
**Recalibration:** 0.3% seems too low given:
- Olympics window has some institutional backing (Italy proposal, UN support)
- US engagement is genuinely unprecedented in intensity
- 89 days allows for 2-3 more negotiation rounds

**Adjusted reasoning:**
- Base scenario (no Olympics factor): 0.5%
- Olympics scenario (ceasefire Feb 6-22 with 30-day stated intention): Add 1.5%
- Combined: 2%

**Final sanity check:**
- 2% = 1-in-50 odds
- Implies: "If we observed 50 parallel universes with identical conditions, in 1 of them Russia and Ukraine sign a 30-day ceasefire agreement before May 1, 2026"
- Does this align with:
  - 0% historical success rate for 30-day ceasefires? Yes—2% acknowledges unprecedented factors (Trump, Olympics) while respecting historical pattern
  - Energy ceasefire achievement? Yes—shows parties can negotiate but 2% reflects low probability they'll expand scope/duration 4-5x
  - Sequencing deadlock? Yes—2% allows for low-probability breakthrough (e.g., simultaneous signing of security agreement + ceasefire) but recognizes structural barrier

## Probability Calibration

**Outside View Base Rate:** 3% (based on 0% historical success rate with adjustments for unprecedented US engagement and economic strain)

**Inside View Adjustments:**

**Major Negative Factors:**
- Energy ceasefire reveals negotiating ceiling far below resolution criteria (-1.5%)
- Formalized sequencing deadlock with no resolution mechanism (-1%)
- Accelerating diplomatic failures despite increased engagement (-0.5%)

**Major Positive Factors:**
- Olympics ceasefire window (Feb 6-22) with institutional backing (+1.5%)
- Unprecedented direct Trump-Putin engagement (+0.5%)
- Continued substantive talks (Feb 1 Abu Dhabi) with "qualitative change" (+0.3%)

**Net Adjustment:** -0.7%

**Preliminary Calibration:** 3% - 0.7% = 2.3
