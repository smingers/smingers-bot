Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary News Sources (January 25-31, 2026):**

1. **Al Jazeera, PBS (Jan 25-26)**: High-quality mainstream sources. **Facts**: Abu Dhabi talks Jan 23-24 included military representatives; no deal emerged; Zelenskyy stated US security agreement "100% ready"; territorial disputes remain fundamental. **Opinions**: Zelenskyy (identifiable leader): "Americans are trying to find a compromise." **Quality**: Excellent, current.

2. **Guardian, China US Focus (Oct 21-28, 2025)**: Reputable sources, but **3+ months old**. **Facts**: Budapest summit canceled; Putin rejected Trump's freeze-along-frontlines proposal; Russia demanded additional territory beyond current lines. **Opinions**: Zelenskyy: "Only pressure can bring peace." **Quality**: Good but dated; shows historical pattern of failed initiatives.

3. **Democracy Now (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reliable source. **Facts**: Budapest summit canceled; Russia rejected ceasefire calls; 7 killed in recent strikes. **Opinions**: Zelenskyy (identifiable): Russia "less interested in diplomacy" after long-range weapons issue moved away. **Quality**: Excellent, very current.

4. **Manifold Markets**: Prediction market summary, not primary source. **Facts**: 19-point peace plan emerged Nov 2025; Putin called positions "absolutely contradictory." **Quality**: Moderate; aggregates public information but lacks verification.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 29-31, 2026):**

5. **Multiple Russian/Ukrainian sources (Jan 29-31)**: **Facts**: "Energy ceasefire" agreed Jan 29-Feb 1, 2026 (confirmed by Peskov, Zelenskyy, Trump); second round of talks scheduled Feb 1 in Abu Dhabi; bilateral format (Russia-Ukraine) with possible US observers. **Opinions**: Kremlin (Peskov, identifiable): "We work for peace, not for a truce"; Ushakov (identifiable): suspects Zelenskyy uses elections as ceasefire tactic. **Quality**: High for immediate developments; multiple independent confirmations.

6. **RBC, Süddeutsche Zeitung (Jan 30-31)**: **Facts**: Energy ceasefire until Feb 1 confirmed; Feb 1 talks to include military/economic matters; US-Ukraine security agreement near completion; EU accession debates ongoing. **Quality**: Excellent, current.

**Historical Context Sources (Nov-Dec 2025):**

7. **Egyptian, Spanish, Portuguese sources (Nov-Dec 2025)**: **Facts**: Kremlin rejected energy truce in Nov-Dec; Putin claimed Zelenskyy lost legitimacy; Zelenskyy stated ceasefire must precede formal agreement. **Quality**: Moderate; shows evolution of positions but 2-3 months old.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (favoring increased probability):**

1. **Active diplomatic track with concrete progress** (Jan 25-31, 2026):
   - Multiple independent sources (Al Jazeera, PBS, RBC, AskNews) confirm Abu Dhabi talks Jan 23-24 included military representatives for first time
   - Second round scheduled Feb 1 (today) with bilateral format
   - US officials (identifiable via multiple sources) describe talks as covering "ceasefire parameters" and "monitoring mechanisms"
   - **Causal mechanism**: Military-level participation suggests operational ceasefire discussions, not just political posturing
   - **Weight**: This is the strongest positive signal; prior talks rarely included military representatives

2. **Short-term energy ceasefire demonstrates feasibility** (Jan 29-Feb 1):
   - Confirmed by Kremlin (Peskov), Ukraine (Zelenskyy), and US (Trump) independently
   - Russia agreed to Trump's "personal request" despite prior rejections
   - **Causal mechanism**: Proves both sides can coordinate cessation, even if temporary
   - **Weight**: Strong; shows operational capability and some willingness, though limited to 3 days

3. **US-Ukraine security agreement "100% ready"** (Jan 25):
   - Zelenskyy (identifiable, direct quote) stated agreement ready for ratification
   - **Causal mechanism**: Zelenskyy previously stated (Dec 11, 2025) security agreement must precede ceasefire; this removes one prerequisite
   - **Weight**: Moderate-strong; addresses Ukraine's security guarantee demand

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

4. **Trump administration engagement** (Jan 25-31):
   - Trump personally requested energy ceasefire from Putin (confirmed)
   - US envoys (Witkoff, Kushner) held "constructive" talks in Miami (Jan 31)
   - **Causal mechanism**: High-level US pressure creates diplomatic incentive
   - **Weight**: Moderate; Trump's unpredictability cuts both ways

5. **Timeframe pressure** (Feb 6-22: Winter Olympics):
   - Ukraine agreed to "Olympic truce" proposal (Oct 10, 2025 statement)
   - Italy proposed global ceasefire during Games
   - **Causal mechanism**: Creates natural deadline for face-saving agreement
   - **Weight**: Weak-moderate; historical precedent shows Russia invaded during Olympics (2008, 2014)

**STRONG EVIDENCE (against resolution):**

6. **Fundamental territorial deadlock** (confirmed Jan 25-31):
   - Multiple sources confirm Russia demands Ukraine cede territory beyond current frontlines
   - Zelenskyy (Jan 25): "Two fundamentally different positions" on territory
   - Kremlin (Peskov, Jan 31): "We work for peace, not for a truce"—rejects temporary ceasefires
   - **Causal mechanism**: No compromise framework visible; both sides state positions as non-negotiable
   - **Weight**: Very strong; this is the core structural obstacle

7. **Historical failure rate** (2014-2026):
   - 25+ ceasefire attempts since 2014, all violated quickly (BBC Apr 2025)
   - Zero bilateral ≥30-day ceasefires signed since Feb 2022 (48 months)
   - Budapest summit canceled Oct 2025; multiple rounds stalled
   - **Weight**: Very strong; establishes extremely low base rate

8. **Russia's stated rejection of ceasefire concept** (Nov 2025-Jan 2026):
   - Peskov (Jan 31): Ceasefire only until Feb 1, then "free from restrictions"
   - Ushakov (Dec 12): Suspects ceasefire is Ukrainian tactic to regroup
   - Putin (Nov 2025): Called positions "absolutely contradictory"
   - **Weight**: Strong; shows Russia views ceasefire as strategic disadvantage

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

9. **Increased Russian strikes post-energy truce** (Jan 31):
   - Russian sources indicate shift to "logistics facilities" targeting
   - **Weight**: Weak; suggests tactical repositioning, not strategic shift

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 89 days (Feb 1 - May 1, 2026)

**If halved to 45 days (Feb 1 - Mar 15)**:
- Probability would increase to ~20-25%
- Rationale: Feb 1 talks + Olympic truce window (Feb 6-22) + immediate Trump pressure create concentrated near-term opportunity
- Energy ceasefire demonstrates short-term coordination is possible

**If doubled to 178 days (Feb 1 - Jul 28)**:
- Probability would increase to ~25-30%
- Rationale: More time allows multiple negotiating rounds; reduces pressure of single-point failure
- However, extended timeframe also increases risk of escalatory events that derail talks

**Current 89-day window assessment**:
- Goldilocks zone: Long enough for 2-3 negotiating rounds (Feb 1, mid-March, April), but short enough that current momentum matters
- Olympics (Feb 6-22) and spring offensive season (March-April) create natural pressure points
- However, 89 days is insufficient to resolve fundamental territorial dispute without major concessions

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 13%** (from long interstate wars reference class)

**Factors warranting UPWARD adjustment (+12 percentage points):**

1. **Military-level talks are unprecedented** (+4 ppt):
   - Jan 23-24 Abu Dhabi talks included military representatives for first time
   - Directly addresses operational ceasefire mechanics, not just political frameworks
   - This is qualitatively different from prior failed attempts (2014-2025)

2. **Energy ceasefire proves coordination capacity** (+3 ppt):
   - Jan 29-Feb 1 truce confirmed by all parties
   - Demonstrates both sides can implement cessation when motivated
   - Question criteria allows agreement "even if immediately violated"—this lowers bar significantly

3. **US security agreement removes Ukraine's key prerequisite** (+2 ppt):
   - Zelenskyy stated (Dec 11) ceasefire requires security guarantees first
   - Agreement now "100% ready" (Jan 25)
   - Removes structural blocker from Ukraine's side

4. **Trump's direct engagement** (+2 ppt):
   - Personal request to Putin succeeded (energy truce)
   - Creates face-saving opportunity for both leaders
   - Trump's unpredictability could force unexpected breakthrough

5. **Olympic truce window** (+1 ppt):
   - Natural deadline Feb 6-22
   - Ukraine already agreed to concept
   - Creates international pressure for temporary cessation

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD adjustment (-8 percentage points):**

1. **Territorial deadlock is unresolved** (-4 ppt):
   - Russia demands more than current frontlines; Ukraine refuses any concessions
   - Peskov (Jan 31): "We work for peace, not truce"—explicitly rejects temporary ceasefires
   - No compromise framework visible despite talks

2. **Russia's strategic incentives favor continued war** (-2 ppt):
   - Ushakov (Dec 12): Views ceasefire as Ukrainian regrouping tactic
   - Russia increasing strikes post-energy truce (Jan 31)
   - Military momentum favors Russia in Donbas

3. **Extremely low historical success rate** (-2 ppt):
   - 0/48 months since Feb 2022 have produced ≥30-day ceasefire
   - 25+ prior attempts all failed quickly
   - Pattern suggests structural impossibility, not just bad timing

**Net adjustment: +12 -8 = +4 percentage points**

**Critical insight on resolution criteria**:
The question asks for an agreement "intended to last a minimum of 30 days...even if immediately violated." This significantly lowers the bar:
- Energy ceasefire (Jan 29-Feb 1) was only 3 days but shows parties can coordinate
- If parties agree to a "30-day Olympic truce" that collapses after 1 day, it still resolves YES
- This favors face-saving "paper agreements" that both sides know won't hold

**Additional upward adjustment for low bar**: +3 ppt

**Final calculation: 13% (base) + 4% (net factors) + 3% (resolution criteria leniency) = 20%**

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate anchor**: 13% (long interstate wars, 90-day window)

**Key calibration questions**:

1. **Does 20% feel right for "1 in 5 chance"?**
   - YES: Given active talks (Feb 1), energy truce precedent, and low resolution bar (agreement need not hold), 1-in-5 captures the tension between unprecedented diplomatic activity and fundamental deadlock

2. **What would 10% vs. 30% imply?**
   - 10% (1-in-10): Would underweight current momentum; energy ceasefire + military talks represent genuine novelty
   - 30% (1-in-3): Would overweight diplomacy; territorial deadlock remains unresolved, Russia explicitly rejects temporary truces

3. **Scenario testing**:
   - Feb 1 talks produce framework → 40% chance of signing by May 1
   - Feb 1 talks stall → 5% chance (only if unexpected shock)
   - Weighted average: 0.5 × 40% + 0.5 × 5% = 22.5%

4. **Comparison to prediction markets**:
   - Manifold summary suggests community skepticism about 2026 ceasefire
   - 20% is cautiously optimistic but defensible given recent developments

5. **Blind-spot check**:
   - If Trump threatens to cut Ukraine aid unless ceasefire signed, probability jumps to 40-50%
   - If Russia launches major offensive in March, probability drops to 5-10%
   - 20% accounts for both tails without overcommitting

**Final calibrated probability: 20%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Russia-Ukraine sign bilateral ceasefire (≥30-day intent) taking effect before May 1, 2026? Agreement counts even if violated.

2. **Base rate**: 13% (long interstate wars, 90-day window). Final 20% represents +7 ppt shift driven by unprecedented military-level talks, energy truce precedent, and lenient resolution criteria (agreement need not hold).

3. **Consistency**: "20 out of 100 times, Russia and Ukraine sign a ≥30-day ceasefire before May 1, 2026." YES—captures genuine but fragile diplomatic opening against structural deadlock.

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Military representatives in Abu Dhabi talks (Jan 23-24)—first time, suggests operational focus
   - Energy ceasefire (Jan 29-Feb 1) confirmed by all parties—proves coordination capacity
   - Territorial deadlock unresolved—Russia demands more than frontlines, Ukraine refuses concessions
   - Peskov (Jan 31): "We work for peace, not truce"—explicit rejection of temporary ceasefires
   - Resolution bar is low—agreement counts even if immediately violated

5. **Blind-spot**: Trump threatens Ukraine aid cutoff in March, forcing Zelenskyy to sign face-saving "Olympic truce" that collapses within days. This scenario (15% probability) would make 20% forecast look too conservative. Conversely, major Russian offensive in March (20% probability) would make 20% look too optimistic. Net: 20% is defensible.

6. **Status quo**: No ceasefire for 48 months. However, current situation is NOT status quo—energy truce + military talks represent regime change in diplomatic activity. Modest upward shift from 13% base justified, but not dramatic given territorial deadlock persists.

**Probability: 20%**
