Analysis:
### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality)
1) **BBC (Apr 21, 2025) – “Attempts to reach ceasefire in Ukraine littered with years of failure”**  
   - **What it provides (facts):** A catalogue of past ceasefire attempts since 2014 (Minsk-1, Minsk-2, multiple “Easter / school / bread / Christmas” ceasefires, July 2020 “comprehensive ceasefire”), many of which **collapsed quickly**. Notes a **30-hour Easter 2025 truce** and that a US effort for a **30-day ceasefire** didn’t take hold (per BBC).  
   - **What it provides (opinions):** Expert assessments (Savill, Herbst) arguing Russia has not negotiated in good faith; interpretations of culpability and sincerity.  
   - **Quality:** High for broad historical narrative and named expert quotes. The “many ceasefires since 2014” claim is plausible and consistent with public record; however the *exact* number of “25 ceasefire agreements” attributed to Zelensky is a political claim, not a neutral dataset.

2) **PILPG (policy-planning resource page)**  
   - **What it provides (facts):** PILPG prepared negotiation support materials (handbook, red teaming, case studies).  
   - **What it does *not* provide:** Evidence that negotiations are succeeding or failing; no probabilistic judgment.  
   - **Quality:** Credible as institutional description, but **low direct forecasting value** for whether a ceasefire will be signed.

3) **Harvard Epicenter / WCFIA blog (May 18, 2022) on Minsk**  
   - **What it provides (facts):** Structural/accountability weaknesses of Minsk (political commitment status, vague terms, sequencing disputes, border-control disputes).  
   - **What it provides (opinions):** The author’s explanatory frame that territory + force dominance limits diplomacy; interpretive but grounded in direct experience.  
   - **Quality:** Reasonably strong qualitative analysis; not a statistical base-rate source, but useful for identifying recurring failure modes.

4) **NPR (Jan 6, 2026), ABC News (Jan 2026), Euronews (Jan 7, 2026) – Paris talks & “security guarantees” discussions**  
   - **What they provide (facts):** Allied planning around monitoring/verification and possible European deployments *after a ceasefire*; public statements that talks made progress but “hardest yards ahead”; Russia’s continued objections to NATO troops.  
   - **What they provide (opinions):** Optimism/pessimism from political leaders; these are *stakeholder statements* with incentives.  
   - **Quality:** High as journalism on what was said/done publicly; still, these are **signals of intent**, not proof that agreement is near.

5) **Agent_report (Nov 2023–Feb 1, 2026 timeline)**  
   - **What it provides (facts):** A detailed timeline of purported talks, drafts, and backchannels; roles of US/EU/China/Türkiye; claims about leaked drafts and specific conditions.  
   - **Quality concerns:** This is explicitly “sourced from the internet/language models,” includes many precise-seeming claims that are hard to verify from the summary alone (e.g., named backchannels, specific draft contents). I treat it as **directionally useful** (it reinforces “many rounds, no durable ceasefire”), but **not** as a reliable quantitative anchor.

**Net from sources:** The record shows **many attempted ceasefires historically**, a pattern of **rapid collapse**, and (since 2022) a notable absence of any broadly accepted, durable ceasefire—despite repeated diplomatic pushes.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choosing a base-rate lens)
Possible reference classes:

1) **“Russia–Ukraine war since Feb 2022: probability of signing a 30+ day bilateral ceasefire in a given 3‑month window.”**  
   - **Pros:** Closest match in actors, issues (territory, sovereignty), and intensity.  
   - **Cons:** Small sample (only ~16 quarters from 2022–2025) and essentially **zero observed successes**, which risks overfitting to a short history.

2) **“Post‑2014 Donbas conflict: frequency of signed ceasefires (intended to last) that later broke.”**  
   - **Pros:** Many observations; shows that **signing** ceasefires can be common even when compliance is poor (important because the question counts agreements even if immediately violated).  
   - **Cons:** Conflict intensity/scale differs from the full‑scale 2022+ war; bargaining stakes are higher now.

3) **“Modern high-intensity interstate wars with territorial conquest + external backers: chance of ceasefire within next quarter.”**  
   - **Pros:** Conceptually relevant.  
   - **Cons:** Hard to parameterize without an external dataset in the prompt; risk of handwaving.

**Most suitable approach:** Blend (1) and (2):  
- Use (1) to reflect the **post‑2022 reality**: ceasefire signing has been extremely hard.  
- Use (2) to avoid an overconfident near-zero and to reflect that **paper ceasefires can still be signed** even amid distrust and violations (and the resolution criteria count “intended 30 days” even if violated).

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** From **Feb 1, 2026 to May 1, 2026** = **~3 months** (~89 days).
- **Pattern in similar settings:**  
  - In protracted wars, major diplomatic breakthroughs typically require either (i) a decisive change in battlefield leverage, (ii) a large shift in external support/pressure, or (iii) a mutually acceptable enforcement/guarantee mechanism.  
  - Over short horizons (a quarter), absent a clear forcing event, the default is **continued fighting** with intermittent limited pauses (humanitarian, energy, localized), not a comprehensive 30+ day bilateral ceasefire.

---

### (d) Justification for an outside-view probability
Key base-rate considerations:

1) **Status quo is “no comprehensive ceasefire.”**  
   The dominant historical pattern (especially post‑2022) is that negotiations recur but do not culminate in a broad bilateral ceasefire intended to last 30+ days.

2) **However, “signing” is easier than “holding.”**  
   The BBC history since 2014 indicates multiple ceasefires were *agreed* yet quickly violated. Because this question counts a ceasefire even if immediately violated (so long as it was intended to last 30+ days), the probability is higher than if we required meaningful compliance.

3) **Short window penalty.**  
   Even if a deal is plausible over a year, converting it into an executed bilateral statement/agreement that “goes into effect” within ~3 months is still a relatively low-frequency outcome for high-stakes interstate wars.

4) **Structural bargaining gaps remain large.**  
   Across sources, Russia’s publicly stated conditions (neutrality/demilitarization/territorial issues; objections to NATO troops) and Ukraine’s insistence on strong security guarantees create a durable mismatch. Historically, that mismatch has repeatedly prevented durable, broad ceasefires.

**Outside-view conclusion:** Not near-zero (because “paper ceasefires” are historically signable), but still **well below 50%** given the post‑2022 record and the short timeframe.

Outside view calibration:
- A reasonable “tether” from the provided historical context is:  
  - **Many ceasefires were signed in 2014–2021** but failed quickly (BBC).  
  - **No clear successful broad ceasefire is evidenced for the full-scale war period**, despite repeated diplomatic initiatives (multiple sources).  
- Translating that into a quarterly base rate: I would place the chance of a qualifying bilateral ceasefire being signed and going into effect within a random quarter of the current phase of the war in the **~10–25%** range.  
- Given the short horizon and entrenched bargaining gaps, I calibrate toward the lower-middle of that range.

Outside View Prediction:
**17%**
