Analysis:
### 1) Resolution-criteria alignment (what counts)
Question resolves **Yes** if **Russia and Ukraine** conclude a **bilateral** ceasefire that **goes into effect** before **May 1, 2026**, and is **intended to last at least 30 days (or indefinitely)** per the text/joint statement, **even if immediately violated**.  
Partial/sectoral pauses (e.g., “energy” or “Kyiv only”), or truces <30 days, **do not** qualify.

Time window from today (2026-02-01) to resolution deadline (2026-05-01): **89 days**.

### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality/date + what is fact vs opinion)

**Al Jazeera (Jan 26, 2026) – Zelenskyy says US security agreement ready**
- **Quality/date:** High-quality major outlet; timely.
- **Facts:** Trilateral Abu Dhabi talks occurred; no deal emerged. Zelenskyy says US security guarantees document is ready to sign; more talks expected. Territorial positions “fundamentally different.”
- **Opinion/stance:** Zelenskyy framing; Kremlin conditions as reported.
- **Relevance:** Indicates active diplomacy but also core deadlock on territory.

**PBS (Jan 25, 2026) – similar reporting**
- **Quality/date:** High; corroborative of Al Jazeera.
- **Facts:** Abu Dhabi talks; discussed “possibility of a ceasefire before a deal” (attributed to a US official). Next round expected Feb 1. Territorial dispute central.
- **Opinion:** Leader statements.
- **Relevance:** Adds credible detail that interim ceasefire is at least on agenda.

**The Guardian (Oct 21, 2025) – Budapest summit shelved**
- **Quality/date:** High; older but still informative.
- **Facts:** Trump canceled Budapest meeting; outlines competing ceasefire concepts; Russia demanded more territory; West floated ceasefire along line of contact; stabilization force idea.
- **Opinion:** Some interpretive framing; but quotes and reported positions are key.
- **Relevance:** Shows repeated failure cycles and Russia’s maximalist bargaining.

**Democracy Now (Jan 30, 2026) – summit canceled; Kremlin rejects ceasefire calls**
- **Quality/date:** Mixed-to-moderate; often advocacy framing but includes real events/quotes.
- **Facts:** Trump canceled summit; Russian strikes killed civilians; calls for ceasefire along frontlines; Kremlin rejected.
- **Relevance:** Reinforces that Russia publicly rejects broad ceasefire despite pressure.

**Manifold market page (accessed Feb 1, 2026)**
- **Quality:** Low-to-moderate as an indicator. It is **not** a source of ground truth; useful only as a sentiment/aggregation signal. Also its criteria differ (whole front, any time in 2026, no 30-day requirement).
- **Relevance:** Weak as direct evidence, modest as “market expectation” context.

**ChinaUSFocus (Oct 28, 2025) – analysis of why Budapest summit canceled**
- **Quality/date:** Analytical commentary; not primary reporting; older.
- **Facts vs opinion:** Many claims are interpretive (EU split, Russia confidence). Some factual timeline points.
- **Relevance:** Useful for structural constraints; treat specific claims cautiously.

**AskNews articles (various, mostly Jan 29–31, 2026; mixed languages/outlets)**
Key ones:
- **RBC / RBC-Ukraine (Jan 29–31, 2026)**
  - **Quality:** Generally medium-to-high among Russian/Ukrainian business/political outlets; still subject to wartime info constraints.
  - **Facts:** A temporary “energy ceasefire”/pause described as running roughly **Jan 29/30 to Feb 1**; linked to Abu Dhabi talks; discussions included ceasefire parameters/monitoring terminology. Territorial disputes remain central.
  - **Relevance:** Strongly indicates **short, sectoral/time-bound** pauses are feasible; does not yet meet 30-day full ceasefire threshold.
- **Glavcom (Jan 31, 2026)**
  - **Quality:** Ukrainian outlet; medium; likely accurate on Ukrainian conditions, but interpretive tone.
  - **Facts:** Energy truce effectively ended night of Jan 31–Feb 1; Kremlin said pause only until Feb 1.
  - **Relevance:** Negative signal: Russia constrains pauses tightly; suggests reluctance to commit ≥30 days.
- **URA.RU, Tsargrad, mk.ru, RIA Novosti (Jan 30–31, 2026)**
  - **Quality:** Generally low-to-medium; some are overtly propagandistic (Tsargrad, RIA). mk.ru/blogger claims are noisy.
  - **Facts:** They confirm (from Russia-side narrative) a limited pause was tied to Trump’s request and negotiations, but details vary (one week vs until Feb 1).
  - **Relevance:** Confirms existence of a **limited** pause; not reliable for predicting a 30-day bilateral agreement.
- **Ifeng/Chinese finance syndication (Jan 30–31, 2026)**
  - **Quality:** Medium; often repackages wire/official statements.
  - **Facts:** Zelenskyy says US security pact prerequisite; Ukraine wants to keep large army post-ceasefire; Russia shifts targeting.
  - **Relevance:** Important constraint: Ukrainian sequencing may slow ceasefire timing.
- **Dialogue.ua (Oct 10, 2025) – “Olympic truce”**
  - **Quality:** Low-to-medium; and the “Olympic truce” as described would be <30 days anyway.
  - **Relevance:** Even if true, it likely **does not qualify** (Feb 6–22 < 30 days).

**AskNews “Deep Research Analysis” snippet**
- **Quality:** Unclear provenance; treat as **tentative** unless independently corroborated.
- **Claims:** “7-day truce until Feb 4,” talks Feb 4–5, “constructive” Miami talks narrowing to one point.
- **Relevance:** If accurate, suggests momentum; but because corroboration is unclear, weight lightly.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criteria)

**Strong evidence (structural / historically predictive)**
1) **Core incompatibility on territory and security architecture** remains explicit (Al Jazeera, PBS; consistent with 2014–2025 pattern).  
   - Mechanism: Without movement on territory/sovereignty/security guarantees, a ≥30-day full-front ceasefire is politically costly for both sides.
2) **Russia’s demonstrated preference for short, tactical pauses** (energy/infrastructure pause ending Feb 1 per multiple sources) rather than committing to longer ceasefires.  
   - Mechanism: Short pauses reduce diplomatic pressure while preserving operational freedom; this pattern reduces likelihood of a 30+ day intended ceasefire.

**Moderate evidence (momentum, agenda-setting, but not decisive)**
1) **Active negotiations in Abu Dhabi with US mediation** and discussion of “ceasefire before a deal” (PBS; also Al Jazeera).  
   - Mechanism: Sustained talks increase probability of some formalized ceasefire text, even if fragile.
2) **Zelenskyy: US security agreement “ready”** but requires US congressional and Ukrainian parliamentary steps (Al Jazeera/PBS; Ifeng).  
   - Mechanism: Could enable ceasefire if signed/ratified quickly; but sequencing could delay beyond May 1.

**Weak evidence (noisy / speculative / misaligned with criteria)**
1) Prediction-market framing (Manifold) because criteria mismatch (no 30-day requirement; whole front requirement differs).  
2) Propaganda/blogger claims (Tsargrad, mk.ru, RIA framing) and “Olympic truce” reports (<30 days anyway).  
3) Claims of “one solvable point” progress from the synthetic “deep research” without clear independent confirmation.

**Net directional take from evidence:**  
- There is **real diplomatic activity** (slightly pro-Yes), but the **observable agreements so far are short and limited** (anti-Yes for a 30+ day bilateral ceasefire).

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** **89 days**.
- **If timeframe were halved (~45 days):** probability would drop meaningfully because ratification/sequencing and drafting/monitoring terms rarely conclude that fast; I’d expect a low-single-digit to high-single-digit probability.
- **If timeframe were doubled (~178 days, to ~late July 2026):** probability would rise because repeated negotiation rounds could culminate in a formal 30+ day ceasefire even if violated; I’d expect a noticeable increase (roughly +5 to +10 points from the current estimate), conditional on US pressure and battlefield dynamics.

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view (12%) to an inside view
**Outside-view anchor:** 12% (based on long history of failed ceasefires, persistent territorial deadlock, and short time window).

**Reasons to move upward (pro-Yes, but limited magnitude)**
- **Credible reporting that an interim ceasefire is being discussed explicitly** (“ceasefire before a deal”) and that trilateral talks occurred and will continue (PBS/Al Jazeera). This is more concrete than vague “talks about talks.”
- **Demonstrated ability to implement at least a temporary pause** (energy/infrastructure) suggests coordination channels exist and can produce written/declared commitments (even if narrow/short).

**Reasons to move downward / keep low (anti-Yes)**
- The **implemented pause is explicitly short** (ends Feb 1 per several accounts) and appears **sectoral**, which is a poor match to a **bilateral 30+ day** ceasefire.
- **Sequencing constraint**: Zelenskyy saying a US security agreement (and even congressional approval) is a **prerequisite** for ceasefire is a potential bottleneck within 89 days.
- **Russia continues to reject broad ceasefire calls publicly** (Democracy Now summary consistent with other reporting; also consistent with long-run pattern).

**Conclusion:** These new facts modestly increase “process probability” (talks ongoing) but do not yet increase “resolution probability” (a 30+ day bilateral ceasefire in effect) by much, because the only concrete ceasefire-like outcome is short/limited and Russia is drawing tight temporal boundaries.

Probability calibration:
- Start from outside view **12%**.
- **+3 pp** for sustained, credible high-level diplomacy explicitly discussing ceasefire mechanics (PBS/Al Jazeera; multiple sources).
- **-2 pp** for evidence that Russia is only accepting very short, time-bound pauses (ending Feb 1) and for Ukraine’s stated sequencing/ratification constraint.
- **Net inside-view estimate: 13%**.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: **By May 1, 2026, will Russia and Ukraine implement a bilateral ceasefire intended for ≥30 days (even if violated)?**
2) Outside view base rate used: **12%**.
3) Consistency: **13 out of 100 times**, a qualifying 30+ day intended bilateral ceasefire takes effect before May 1, 2026.
4) Key evidence (3–5):
   - PBS/Al Jazeera: ceasefire discussed; Abu Dhabi talks ongoing; core territorial gap persists.
   - Multiple reports: “energy/infrastructure truce” is short and ends Feb 1 (doesn’t meet criteria).
   - Zelenskyy: US security pact/ratification framed as prerequisite (possible timing bottleneck).
   - Historical pattern: Russia-Ukraine ceasefires frequently fail and are often tactical.
5) Blind spot: **A sudden US-brokered “30-day renewable ceasefire” announcement** designed to lock in talks (even if violated) could resolve Yes quickly.
6) Status quo: Ongoing fighting with only limited pauses is the default; short window favors **No**.

Probability: 13%
