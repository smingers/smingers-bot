Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, newest first)
   • Jan 31 2026 Glavcom / URA / Dagospia / RBC / Ifeng / RIA / Tsargrad / Süddeutsche / MK-ru / RBC-UA: all describe the very limited “energy ceasefire” (29 Jan-1 Feb), quoting named officials (Putin, Zelenskyy, Peskov, Trump).  Factual core: narrow, temporary pause, verbally confirmed, expires 1 Feb.  Quality: mixed—main facts cross-confirmed by Reuters, PBS and other Tier-1 outlets; Russian tabloids add opinion.  Reliability rated Moderate.  
   • Jan 25-26 2026 Al Jazeera, PBS: Zelenskyy says US-Ukraine security pact “100 % ready”; trilateral Abu-Dhabi talks produced no deal but will continue 1 Feb.  Factual, well-sourced, High quality.  
   • Jan 30 2026 Democracy Now!, Guardian: recall Oct 2025 aborted Trump-Putin summit, highlight continuing Russian rejection of ceasefire.  Historical recap, High quality for public quotes.  
   • Oct-Dec 2025 cluster (ChinaUSFocus, El Comercio, others): underscores long-running pattern of cancelled summits, Russian territorial demands, and Ukraine insisting ceasefire precede major concessions.  Older but still relevant context.  
   • Manifold market (Jan 2026): crowd odds (~28 % YES) give a public aggregated sentiment; useful as a weak signal.  
   • BBC 2025 reference piece (not re-quoted above): documents >20 failed ceasefires since 2014.  High quality historical record.

   Opinions distinguished: leaders’ public statements accepted as position indicators; punditry/anonymous Telegram posts treated as low-weight.

2. Evidence weighting
   Strong evidence
   • Structural gap: Russia demands Ukrainian withdrawal/territorial concessions; Ukraine rejects.  Positions unchanged since 2022 (many independent sources).  
   • Historical base-rate: zero comprehensive 30-day ceasefires in 4 years of full-scale war despite >10 negotiating cycles (BBC, PBS timelines).

   Moderate evidence
   • Active high-level diplomacy (Abu Dhabi round 2 on 1 Feb; US security pact near-ready) shows momentum, increases chance of an “arranged pause”.  
   • Temporary energy truce just implemented shows the two sides can obey a narrow verbal pause when the US leans in—proof-of-concept for a longer ceasefire.

   Weak evidence
   • Prediction market ≈28 % YES (liquidity low).  
   • Rumours of Trump-brokered 19-point plan.

   Net directional pull: diplomacy/US pressure +5-7 pp; still-large territorial gap −3 pp; short three-month window −4 pp.

3. Time-frame
   • 89 days remain until 1 May 2026.  If window were doubled to six months I would add ~+10 pp (terrain, elections, Olympics).  If halved to six weeks, I’d subtract ~5 pp—talks would have to crystallise immediately.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment
   Outside-view base rate (full-scale war, quarterly) = 17 %.  
   Adjust upward for: unusual density of high-level talks; US security pact near signature; demonstrated seven-day truce (shows feasibility).  +8 pp.  
   Adjust downward for: positions still “fundamentally different”, Kremlin rhetoric against lasting truce, and requirement that agreement actually “go into effect” (paper alone not enough). −3 pp.  
   Net inside view ≈22 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 22 out of 100 worlds similar to today’s, a bilateral ceasefire intended for ≥30 days will enter into force before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase: “Signed Russia-Ukraine bilateral ceasefire ≥30 days in effect by 1 May 2026?”  
2. Base rate used: 17 % per quarter.  
3. Consistency line: “22 out of 100 times, such a ceasefire happens.”  
4. Key evidence: a) No long ceasefire yet in 4 yrs; b) large unresolved territorial gap; c) intense US-led mediation & Feb-1 talks; d) parties obeyed 7-day energy pause, indicating some capacity.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden battlefield shock (e.g., Russian offensive rout or Ukrainian breakthrough) forces an immediate stop-line ceasefire brokered by Trump—would raise probability.  
6. Status-quo bias checked: continued fighting still likelier; modest upward adjustment only.

Probability: 22%
