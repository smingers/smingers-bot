Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Al-Jazeera, 26 Jan 2026 – Straight news.  Quotes Zelenskyy, U.S. official.  Factual: trilateral Abu Dhabi talks to resume 1 Feb; security-guarantee text ready.  Opinions: Zelenskyy acknowledges “fundamental differences”.  High quality, recent.  
2. PBS, 25 Jan 2026 – Same press conference, additional detail on agenda (territory, Zaporizhzhia).  Good mainstream U.S. outlet.  
3. Manifold prediction market page, updated continuously – Aggregated crowd odds (~18 % YES as of 1 Feb).  Useful glimpse of informed lay consensus; not primary evidence.  
4. Guardian, 21 Oct 2025 – Reports cancellation of Budapest summit; lays out Russian and Ukrainian red lines.  Older but still shows enduring gaps.  High quality.  
5. Asknews bundle, 29–31 Jan 2026 – Multiple outlets (RBC, RIA, Süddeutsche, etc.) on the one-week “energy ceasefire”.  Facts: pause runs to 1 Feb; verbal only; Russia stresses it is temporary.  Opinions vary; Russian pundits deride it.  Mixed quality but convergent on main fact.  
Overall: recent frontline reporting predominantly factual; older pieces establish structural bargaining positions.  No single unsourced rumour is relied upon.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Structural disagreement on territory reiterated by both sides (Al-Jazeera, PBS, Guardian).  
• Historical pattern: zero durable ceasefires in 16 consecutive quarters (2019-25).  
Moderate evidence  
• Intensification of U.S. mediation and rare trilateral format (Al-Jazeera, PBS).  
• One-week energy truce shows capability to coordinate limited pauses (Asknews).  
• Prediction-market probability around 15-20 %.  
Weak evidence  
• Commentary that “real window” could open Feb 2026 (Postimees citing Budanov).  
• Olympic-truce diplomacy (Dialogue.ua) – largely symbolic.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window to 1 May 2026 = 90 days.  If the deadline were 45 days, probability would drop roughly one-third (to ~5 %).  If extended to 180 days, I’d raise the forecast to ~15 %, reflecting the higher annual hazard rate once summer campaigning stalls.

(d) Justification and inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view base rate (reference class: RU-UA war 2014-25) → 4 % chance a qualifying ceasefire is reached in any 90-day period.  

Adjustments upward  
+2 pp  Active, U.S.-brokered negotiations resumed, first to include military reps from all three sides – raises odds above background noise.  
+1 pp  Trump administration has clear political incentive to claim a diplomatic “win” before U.S. mid-terms; both Moscow and Kyiv signal readiness to keep talking.  
+1 pp  Repeated short pauses (energy truce) demonstrate minimal trust and a working channel, lowering coordination barriers for a longer text.  

Adjustments downward  
–1 pp  Kremlin orders to secure full Donbas by spring 2026 suggest Russia expects more military gains before freezing lines.  
–0.5 pp  Zelenskyy’s domestic constraints: public opinion and parliament oppose territorial concessions, limiting room for compromise.  
–0.5 pp  Agreement must specify 30-day minimum; even if signed late April, would have to enter into force immediately—compressing drafting/ratification schedule.

Net shift: +3 pp → 7 % final probability.

Probability calibration  
I am 70 % confident the true probability lies between 4 % and 12 %.  A ±10 % absolute change would require either (a) a public draft text showing convergence on territory (+) or (b) evidence of a large new Russian offensive forcing talks back to square one (–).

Checklist:  
1. Criterion: bilateral ceasefire ≥30 days in effect before 1 May 2026.  
2. Base rate: 4 %.  
3. Sanity: “About 7 out of 100 times, a qualifying ceasefire would be in force by 1 May 2026.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Still-irreconcilable territorial demands.  
   • Active U.S.-mediated talks, next round 1 Feb.  
   • One-week energy pause shows limited cooperation.  
   • Russia signals spring military objectives.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden domestic shock (Putin health crisis or regime split) precipitating an immediate stand-down—would push probability sharply higher.  
6. Status-quo bias check: with front lines static and both sides preparing for spring ops, inertia still favours “no agreement”.

Probability: 7 %
