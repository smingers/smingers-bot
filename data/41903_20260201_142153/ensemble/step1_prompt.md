# Summary of BBC Article: "Attempts to reach ceasefire in Ukraine littered with years of failure" (April 21, 2025)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Recent Easter Truce (April 2025)**: Russia's Easter ceasefire lasted only 30 hours and was limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides. Kyiv reported no "air raids alerts" on Sunday during Putin's "Easter truce."

2. **Historical Ceasefire Violations**: President Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014 during a February meeting with Donald Trump.

3. **Ilovaysk Incident (August 2014)**: At least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed when withdrawing convoys came under fire, despite agreements allowing pullout.

4. **Minsk-1 (September 5, 2014)**: Broken within hours of signing, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport.

5. **Minsk-2 (February 15, 2015)**: Broken within minutes of going into effect, with OSCE observers reporting mortar and artillery fire.

6. **Failed Ceasefire Attempts**: Multiple failed truces including:
   - Easter truces in 2016, 2017, 2018
   - "School ceasefires" in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
   - Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
   - "Bread ceasefires" in 2017, 2018, 2019
   - "Comprehensive ceasefire" (July 27, 2020) lasted only 20 minutes according to Kyiv, though it halved Ukrainian soldier fatalities in the following year

7. **Russia's Conditions**: Russia insisted on conditions including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters, as well as addressing "underlying causes of the conflict."

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

1. **Matthew Savill** (Director of Military Sciences, Royal United Services Institute, London): States that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith and "has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives." Acknowledges Ukraine bears some responsibility but argues "the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat."

2. **John Herbst** (Former US Ambassador to Kyiv, Atlantic Council): Argues that Russia, not Ukraine, was the "serial violator" of the Minsk ceasefire accords.

3. **Olga Ivshina** (BBC journalist): Reported that Ukraine retook villages in 2016-19, conducted a successful offensive outside Mariupol, and had tanks spotted too close to the frontline. Notes Moscow proclaimed these as violations but "forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all."

4. **Vladislav Surkov** (Former close adviser to Putin, "grey cardinal" of Russian politics): Celebrated the Minsk accords as a way of "legitimising" Ukraine's initial partition, stating that peace was "nothing but a continuation of war by other means."

## Political Statements:

1. **President Zelensky**: Suggested the Easter truce format could be the "easiest" to extend for 30 days and possibly more. Described the Minsk accords as a "trap" for Ukraine that allowed Russia to prepare for full-scale invasion.

2. **President Putin**: Says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers intended to implement the Minsk deals.

3. **President Trump**: Said "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week" and warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, "we're just gonna take a pass" and walk away.

4. **Russian Officials**: Moscow's stated objectives include a demilitarized, neutral, and non-nuclear Ukraine. Russia demands "underlying causes of the conflict" be resolved, suggesting it hasn't moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty.

## Additional Context:

- The US had tried to organize a 30-day ceasefire but it never took hold.
- Deep mistrust exists between the two countries due to long history of broken deals.
- Verification of ceasefire violations is difficult because independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.
- As of article date, there was no indication the Kremlin would accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine.

# Summary of Article: Policy Planning Ukraine Ceasefire — Public International Law & Policy Group

## Key Facts and Information:

**Organization and Purpose:**
- The Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG) has developed materials to assist Ukraine in preparing for ceasefire negotiations with Russia
- PILPG has actively supported over two dozen peace negotiations and ceasefire efforts globally and continues these efforts in Ukraine

**Resources Developed:**
The organization has created several types of resources:

1. **Policy Planning Papers** - Developed by the PILPG Ceasefire Policy Planning Working Group in collaboration with Ukrainian colleagues, involving retired Generals, policymakers, and subject matter experts

2. **Red Team Initiative** - A sub-group that met intensively over four weeks to analyze Russia's behavior, position, and objectives. The Red Team sought to answer key questions including:
   - What does Russia want to achieve in a ceasefire that it wasn't able to achieve on the battlefield?
   - What do Ukrainian negotiators need to be prepared for when facing Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks?

3. **Case Studies** - Produced in partnership with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe and Milbank LLP, investigating prior ceasefire negotiations in the Balkans, Syria, Colombia, and Yemen, analyzing lessons learned for Ukraine

4. **Expert Interviews** - Focused conversations with experts who have worked in various conflict contexts including Darfur, Guatemala, Bosnia and Kosovo

5. **Ceasefire Drafter's Handbook** - A guide drawing from PILPG's experience and comparative analysis of over 200 ceasefire agreements from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America

**Expert Working Group Members:**
- Brigadier General Robert S. Cooley, Jr., US Army (Ret.)
- Major General Darrell Guthrie, US Army (Ret.)
- Colonel Rick Lorenz, USMC (Ret.)
- Drew Mann, Former U.S. Senior Foreign Service Officer
- Major General Hugh Van Roosen, US Army (Ret.), UN Project Leader

**Note:** This article describes preparatory resources and planning materials rather than reporting on actual ceasefire negotiations or agreements. It does not contain predictions or opinions about whether a ceasefire will occur.

# Summary of Article: "Through the Ashes of the Minsk Agreements"

**Source:** Epicenter.wcfia.harvard  
**Date:** May 18, 2022  
**Author:** Lidia Powirska (former member of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine)

## Key Facts and Context:

### Background on Minsk Agreements
- The Minsk agreements (2014/2015) were signed by the Trilateral Contact Group: Ukraine, Russia, OSCE, and representatives of self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics
- The agreements aimed to end the separatist war in the Donbas region
- High-profile endorsement from Angela Merkel, François Hollande, and Vladimir Putin
- **Critical limitation:** Signatories did not have authority to sign international treaties on behalf of heads of state, so agreements had status of "political commitments rather than legally binding documents"

### Key Provisions of Minsk Protocol (September 5, 2014):
- Ceasefire implementation
- Impunity for offenses during military operations
- Decentralization of power in Ukraine
- Interim status for self-proclaimed republics
- Local elections in these territories
- Economic and humanitarian improvements
- Established approximately 420-kilometer line of contact (though this line was "fluid" and eventually moved deeper into Ukrainian territory)

### Minsk II (February 2015):
- Imposed more obligations on Ukraine
- Required Ukraine to change its constitution to grant "special status" to the republics
- Constitutional changes would need approval from DPR and LPR representatives, giving Russia influence over Ukraine's legal order
- Russia demanded provisions on Ukraine's neutrality to prevent NATO membership (Ukraine refused this)
- Ukraine agreed to extensive "special status" provisions including linguistic self-determination and separate police units for the republics

### Why the Agreements Failed:

1. **Vague provisions:** Terms were too general, allowing parties to interpret them differently
2. **Military reality:** Armed actions continued despite ceasefire; possession of territory trumped diplomatic agreements
3. **Election disputes:** Self-proclaimed republics held "national" elections on November 2, 2014 (less than two months after Minsk Protocol), rather than the "local" elections stipulated in the agreement
4. **Sequencing disagreement:** Ukraine wanted full border control before allowing local elections; Russia maintained troops in the territories, preventing Ukraine's security conditions from being met
5. **Constitutional concerns:** Ukraine feared concessions would legitimize independence aspirations of the republics

### Author's Assessment:
The article emphasizes that "diplomacy can only go so far if one party maintains possession of a territory and the military force to hold it" - suggesting that Russia's continued military presence and territorial control undermined any diplomatic progress.

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the complete analysis may contain additional points.

# Summary of NPR Article: "The U.K. and France would install 'military hubs' in Ukraine as part of a peace plan"

**Date:** January 06, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Paris Meeting Outcomes:**
- Ukraine's allies agreed to provide multilayered international defense guarantees as part of a proposal to end Russia's invasion
- Meeting included 35 participants, including 27 heads of state and government
- Participants included European countries, Canada, U.S. representatives, and top officials from EU and NATO

**Proposed Security Framework:**
- Allies would provide Kyiv's forces with equipment, training, and air, land, and sea support to deter future Russian attacks
- U.K. and France would "establish military hubs across Ukraine and build protected facilities for weapons and military equipment to support Ukraine's defensive needs" in the event of a ceasefire
- Size of supporting forces was not made public; many details remain unclear
- Allies will participate in U.S.-led monitoring and verification of any ceasefire

**Five Key Priorities Identified:**
1. Ways to monitor a ceasefire
2. Support for Ukraine's armed forces
3. Deployment of a multinational force on land, at sea, and in the air
4. Commitments in case of more Russian aggression
5. Long-term defense cooperation with Ukraine

## Named Source Statements:

**U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer:**
- Said the meeting made "excellent progress" but "the hardest yards are still ahead"
- Stated "Putin is not showing that he is ready for peace"
- Noted that peace can only come if Russia compromises

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:**
- Said progress was made, though commitments need ratification by each country
- Stated: "We determined what countries are ready to take leadership in the elements of security guarantees on the ground, in the air, and at sea, and in restoration"
- Noted that details on monitoring, size and financing of Ukrainian army remain to be determined
- Said during the weekend that potential European troop deployments still face hurdles and "not everyone is ready" to commit forces
- Stated deployments by Britain and France would be "essential"
- Noted many countries would need approval from lawmakers

**French President Emmanuel Macron:**
- Called the security statement a "significant step" toward ending Russia's invasion

## Russian Position:

- No immediate comment from Russian officials on Tuesday (eve of Orthodox Christmas)
- Moscow has revealed few details of its stance in U.S.-led peace negotiations
- Officials have reaffirmed Russia's demands and insisted there can be no ceasefire until a comprehensive settlement is agreed
- Russian President Vladimir Putin has ruled out any deployment of troops from NATO countries on Ukrainian soil

## Complicating Factors:

- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio changed plans to attend after U.S. military intervention in Venezuela
- Trump's renewed calls for U.S. control of Greenland caused tension with Europe
- Moscow shows no signs of compromise
- Ukraine seeks firm guarantees from Washington, seen as crucial to securing commitments from other allies
- Kyiv remains wary of any ceasefire that could provide Russia time to regroup and attack again

────────────────────────
2. Role and leverage of key external actors  

United States  
• Continues to act as the indispensable broker—drafting the Riyadh maritime/energy package (Mar 2025) and the leaked 28-point peace outline (Nov 2025).  
• Policy divided: President Trump and VP Vance push for a rapid freeze; Secretary of State Marco Rubio and European allies argue for tighter safeguards.  
• Leverage constrained in early 2024 when Congress stalls Ukraine funding, a fact Moscow cites to question U.S. staying power (CNBC, 12 Jan 2024).

European Union & UK-led “coalition of the willing”  
• Has drawn a red line that any cease-fire must be coupled with robust security guarantees and sustained arms deliveries (EP resolution, 27 Nov 2025).  
• Working on a European reassurance (not peace-keeping) force of 10 000–30 000 troops to deploy close to the front line; concept note stresses multi-domain deterrence and envisions a U.S. “back-stop”, although the force could, in extremis, deploy without U.S. troops (ECFR, 23 Apr 2025).  
• French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot insists “peace cannot be considered until a cease-fire is in effect on the front lines” and hints at a 20th EU sanctions package if Moscow stalls (French MFA, 20 Nov 2025).

China  
• Put forward a rhetorical six-point cease-fire initiative in May 2024 but has not hosted follow-up talks.  
• Has repeatedly called for a “comprehensive cease-fire” yet abstains in UN votes that condemn Russia and continues deep trade ties (USCC timeline, 30 Dec 2025).  
• Beijing offers to host Trump-Putin talks and frames participation as a test of its “responsible-stakeholder” narrative (Brookings, 04 Mar 2025), but has shown no willingness to use economic leverage to press Moscow.

Türkiye  
• Instrumental in re-opening direct talks (May-Jun 2025) and remains the preferred venue for both Kyiv and Moscow, yet its influence waned after Ankara’s corridor talks failed in Aug 2024.  
• President Erdogan backs a leaders’ summit and offers Turkish observers, but Ankara has tabled no new cease-fire text since mid-2024 (CNN, 02 Jun 2025; NPR, 23 Jul 2025).

────────────────────────
3. Representative official (or semi-official) statements on long-term truce prospects  

Ukraine  
• Zelenskyy, 11 Jan 2024: “A pause would play into [Russia’s] hands… it might crush us afterward” (Los Angeles Times).  
• Zelenskyy, 25 Mar 2025: “We do not trust [Russia]” when commenting on the Riyadh package.  
• Foreign Affairs Committee chair Oleksandr Merezhko, 30 Jan 2026: labels the one-week Kyiv pause a “huge mistake” (Kyiv Independent).

Russia  
• Lavrov, 25 Mar 2025: SWIFT reconnection for the Russian Agricultural Bank is a pre-condition for any broader deal.  
• Russian memorandum, 02 Jun 2025: makes any cease-fire conditional on Ukrainian withdrawal and neutrality (OSW, 03 Jun 2025).  
• Putin, Jan 2026: limited Kyiv pause “concerns the capital only” and hinges on U.S. follow-through.

United States  
• Trump, multiple 2025-26 speeches: only he can “break the deadlock”; extolls a 24-hour deal once parties comply.  
• Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, 21 Nov 2025: leaked draft “best win-win scenario”.  
• Secretary Rubio, 24 Nov 2025: admits “still some work to be done” after European backlash.

European Union & NATO  
• EP resolution, 27 Nov 2025: any peace must rest on “robust EU and U.S. guarantees… amounting to Article 5-like commitments.”  
• NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, 2025: Allies “are not going anywhere” despite bilateral U.S.–Russia channel.

China  
• Foreign Ministry spokespeople throughout 2025 reiterate the “three no’s”: no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation, no fanning the flames (USCC timeline, 30 Dec 2025).  
• No Chinese statement has endorsed Ukrainian territorial integrity beyond generalities, nor has Beijing criticised Moscow’s maximalist June 2025 memorandum.

Think-tank & expert validation  
• Belfer Center warns leaked U.S. draft “less aimed at ending the war than at reordering the global security landscape” (10 Dec 2025).  
• ECFR and Brookings analysts caution against a cease-fire that freezes Russian gains and leaves Kyiv vulnerable (ECFR, 23 Apr 2025; Brookings, 19 Feb 2025).

────────────────────────
4. Consequential evidence gaps  

a. January–April 2024: absence of primary-source confirmation for any formal or informal contacts.  
b. Full texts of U.S. “freeze-in-place” drafts (Apr & Nov 2025) and the UK-France-Germany counter-proposal remain unpublished.  
c. Monitoring Annexes negotiated in Istanbul (May–Jun 2025) have not leaked.  
d. Russian domestic deliberations (Duma, Security Council) on cease-fire parameters are scarcely covered in open-source English materials.  
e. Operational planning documents for the proposed EU reassurance force are still limited to concept papers; no rules-of-engagement draft or cost-sharing model is public.  
f. The precise status of Chinese economic or dual-use technology transfers that might affect battlefield calculations remains murky despite periodic U.S. briefings.

────────────────────────
5. Overall picture

Between November 2023 and February 2026, every pathway toward a sustained cessation of hostilities has hit one of two structural roadblocks: (1) Moscow’s insistence that any cease-fire lock in territorial gains and Ukrainian neutrality, codified in the June 2025 Russian memorandum; and (2) Kyiv’s refusal—backed by the EU and, inconsistently, the United States—to accept a pause divorced from binding security guarantees and a roadmap for full sovereignty. The United States retains agenda-setting power but is internally divided; the European Union is willing to pay the financial and military price of a reassurance force but lacks unity on territorial trade-offs; China offers rhetorical balance but no coercive leverage; and Türkiye provides convening space without the clout to forge compromise. As of 1 Feb 2026 no verified cease-fire is in force, the scheduled Abu Dhabi follow-up round is on hold, and the conflict retains a high risk of sudden escalation even as back-channels on prisoners, energy infrastructure and maritime safety continue to function.

No additional open-source searches appear likely to fill the key documentary gaps (draft texts, Russian internal debates) without leaks or de-classification; hence no new search queries are proposed at this stage.</Agent_report>
