    "description": "As of early January 2026, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine have intensified, spearheaded by the U.S. administration. A potential peace settlement framework is under discussion, following high-level meetings in Paris involving U.S. envoys and Ukrainian officials. Key components involve security guarantees and addressing territorial disputes, though a planned summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Budapest may be uncertain. Despite progress on a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, the Kremlin remains opposed to key elements, especially the deployment of European peacekeepers and any compromise on Ukraine's future alignment.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"8fd79ffad6baa440\",\"sheet_id\":93}}`",

In order to count, a ceasefire must be intended to last a minimum of 30 days (or indefinitely), as specified by the agreement text or joint statement, even if it is immediately violated.",
