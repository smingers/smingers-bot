Analysis:
The key to this forecast is identifying whether there is fresh, concrete movement toward a bilateral cease-fire deal (minimum 30-day intent) between Kyiv and Moscow, not just broad “peace” talks or unilateral pauses.  Evidence to look for over the next few weeks includes:  
• Any joint communiqué, draft text, or leak that specifies a start date, monitoring mechanism, or duration clause.  
• Scheduling or cancellation of the mooted Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest, which could be the venue for an announcement.  
• Statements from Russian, Ukrainian, or U.S./EU negotiators indicating convergence on the main sticking points—security guarantees, territorial lines, and presence of foreign forces.  
• Preparations for third-party verification (e.g., OSCE, UN) that normally accompany a formal ceasefire.
