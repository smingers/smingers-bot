Analysis:
To judge the odds that Moscow and Kyiv will formalize a ≥30-day cease-fire before 1 May 2026, I need an outside view of (a) how often previous Russia-Ukraine truces have been agreed to and how durable they were (Minsk I & II, July 2022 grain-corridor pauses, holiday cease-fires, etc.); (b) how negotiations have progressed since the 2024–25 military stalemate and especially the fresh U.S./Paris initiative in late-2025/early-2026; (c) public red-lines stated by the Kremlin and Kyiv regarding territory, peacekeepers, and security guarantees; and (d) comparable timelines in other modern wars. The historical record of attempts, successes, and failures—plus current diplomatic momentum—will anchor a base-rate forecast and help identify which concessions are plausible before the May deadline.
