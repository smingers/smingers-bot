Transatlantic Strategic Differences:**\n- Trump favored using existing front lines as basis for talks to secure rapid ceasefire\n- EU opposed this approach as it could legitimize Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory\n- Hungary supported the summit due to economic ties with Russia\n- Poland and Baltic states opposed it vehemently due to fears of Russian expansion\n- France and Germany held ambivalent positions, balancing energy security concerns with alliance dynamics\n\n**2. Russia's Uncompromising Negotiating Posture:**\n- Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated Moscow's conditions for peace have not changed since the Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska\n- Russia rejected Trump's proposal to freeze conflict along current fronts\n- Moscow demanded Ukraine cede additional territory beyond current front lines\n- Russia demonstrated strategic confidence based on: resilient wartime economy, expanded defense-industrial output, and stabilized military expenditures\n- Ukrainian strikes targeted Russian refineries (estimated at roughly 22 percent), but surplus energy capacity mitigated impact\n\n**3. Ukraine's Wartime Imperatives:**\n- President Zelenskyy stated on Telegram (October 21): \"Only pressure can bring peace. Once the pressure eases, Russia will postpone the dialogue.\"\n- Trump's \"land-for-peace\" approach conflicts with Ukraine's core red lines\n- Domestic nationalist sentiment and commitment to territorial integrity constrain Zelenskyy's negotiating space\n- Ukraine views long-range strike capabilities as critical leverage in prospective negotiations\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- The summit would have marked Putin's first visit to EU territory since the war's onset\n- U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth urged allied states to expand investment in arms procurement for Ukraine at a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at NATO headquarters\n- Ukraine has effectively become embedded within NATO's broader defense architecture, even absent formal NATO membership\n\n## Analysis (from article author):\n\nThe article concludes that the cancellation underscores the fragility of peace initiatives and suggests the war is likely to continue for a long time. The author asserts that any future peace process will require broader international coordination to reconcile the core interests of all parties.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2025/10/22/headlines/trump_putin_summit_in_budapest_is_canceled\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trump-Putin Summit in Budapest Is Canceled\"\n\n**Source:** Democracy Now!  \n**Date:** January 30, 2026\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Summit Cancellation:** President Trump announced that his planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest has been canceled.

According to public statements from the Kremlin, Russia agreed to a pause in attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure not for a week, as suggested by U.S. President Donald Trump, but only until February 1. Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov confirmed that after February 1, Russia considers itself free from any restrictions on attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that discussions about a temporary halt in strikes occurred during indirect talks, including in Abu Dhabi, and emphasized that Ukraine would refrain from retaliatory strikes on Russian energy facilities if Russia ceased attacks. However, the Kremlin did not commit to any obligations beyond February 1. The move drew strong negative reactions from Russian propagandists, who openly called for not sparing Ukraine\u2019s civilian population during extreme cold, framing attacks on energy infrastructure as a key leverage tool. The end of the ceasefire coincides with the onset of the strongest winter cold of the season, with nighttime temperatures expected to drop to -20\u00b0C to -21\u00b0C in multiple regions, significantly increasing risks of critical infrastructure failure.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 10:22 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/country/incidents/naperedodni-silnikh-moroziv-zakinchilosja-enerhetichne-peremirja-jak-rozhortalisja-podiji-1100659.html)\n\n**Pause Until Frost: How the Energy Truce Is Playing Out in Ukraine**\nRussia agreed on January 30, 2026, to a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump for an energy ceasefire with Ukraine, which will last until February 1, 2026. The decision was made to create favorable conditions for upcoming negotiations in Abu Dhabi. According to Western politicians, Russia's adherence to the agreement demonstrates that Russia is a country that values treaties. The article, published by URA.RU on January 31, 2026, details how the energy ceasefire is being implemented.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1053064832)\n\n**The Ice Truce Is a Bluff: Russia-Ukraine Tension Over Ceasefire and Trump's Role**\nRussia has agreed to suspend attacks on Kyiv until February 1, 2026, due to extreme cold weather in Ukraine, following a proposal from the United States. President Vladimir Putin reportedly accepted a request from Donald Trump to halt bombardments to create 'favorable conditions' for peace talks. The U.S. stated it would refrain from attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy sector for one week, with the countdown beginning immediately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine is ready and has not attacked Russian energy infrastructure, though no direct agreement with Russia has been formalized. The Kremlin, through spokesperson Peskov, stated the ceasefire was already in effect and would last until Sunday, February 1, 2026, to facilitate negotiations. However, skepticism persists in Kyiv: despite a brief pause in attacks, temperatures are plummeting to -26\u00b0C, leaving over 300 buildings without heating. Zelensky warned that the pause may only allow Russia to replenish supplies for more devastating strikes. He also emphasized that the U.S. is not providing Patriot missiles free of charge, and European funding has not arrived in time. Despite the uncertainty, Trump claims Putin and Zelensky are 'close to an agreement,' though mutual animosity remains.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 07:30 AM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/politica/tregua-ghiaccio-e-bluff-lite-distanza-russia-ucraina-tregua-trump-462439)\n\n**Russia and Ukraine Prepare for Second Round of Peace Talks in Abu Dhabi Amid Energy Ceasefire and EU Accession Debates**\nThe second round of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations is scheduled for February 1, 2026, in Abu Dhabi, with the United States acting as mediator. The meeting will be bilateral between Russia and Ukraine, with possible observer presence from the U.S., though key figures such as Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will not attend. The previous round, held January 23\u201324, 2026, in Abu Dhabi, was a trilateral session involving Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine. Ukrainian officials noted a 'qualitative change' in the Russian delegation, describing the discussions as more focused, particularly on military-related topics such as ceasefire parameters, monitoring mechanisms, and terminology. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the central issue remains territorial disputes, including Crimea, Donbas (DNR/LNR), Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Ukraine, under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, remains firm in rejecting voluntary territorial concessions, advocating for a 'stay where we stand' approach, while Russia asserts de facto control over these areas. Prior to the second round, both sides agreed to a temporary energy ceasefire from January 29 to February 1, 2026, following a request by U.S. President Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin, which was confirmed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This ceasefire followed previous temporary truces in 2025 and reflects a worsening energy crisis in Ukraine, with Kyiv experiencing its worst winter energy shortage since the war began, as reported by Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and energy company DTEK\u2019s CEO Maxim Timchenko. Parallel to the peace talks, the U.S. and Ukraine are finalizing two additional agreements: a security guarantee pact and a prosperity treaty. The security agreement includes a potential European military contingent, primarily from France and the UK, but requires U.S. logistical and technical support. European diplomats express concern over their limited role in the negotiations, stressing that the conflict is European in scope and that Ukraine\u2019s EU membership is a key issue. Although the EU has granted Ukraine candidate status since June 2022 and formally began accession talks in June 2024, progress remains slow due to Hungary\u2019s opposition and concerns over economic and security implications. EU Commission Vice President for Enlargement, Martha Kost, stated that while many EU members support Ukraine\u2019s accession, specific timelines like 2027 are not binding, and full technical readiness is required. Zelenskyy\u2019s criticism of European allies at the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, where he accused them of 'cowardice,' sparked backlash, including from Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who called the remarks 'insufficiently generous.' Zelenskyy later clarified that his frustration stemmed from delays in U.S. arms deliveries due to European funding shortfalls for the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), though Western officials disputed this claim without providing details.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:39 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/31/01/2026/697cc53a9a7947999c7e386e)\n\n**Zelenskyy: 'Energy Ceasefire' Begins as Russia Shifts Focus to Logistics Facilities**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on January 30, 2026, that a one-week 'energy ceasefire' had begun following a U.S.-proposed agreement, halting attacks on energy infrastructure by both Ukraine and Russia. According to Zelenskyy, Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities had nearly ceased, and Ukraine was prepared to reciprocate by ceasing attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. However, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia had shifted its aerial targeting to logistical and\u540e\u52e4 facilities. Earlier that day, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine and the United States should first sign a security agreement before a broader peace deal, with the agreement requiring approval by the U.S. Congress. Ukraine is demanding the right to maintain an 800,000-strong military and retain adequate weaponry after a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated during a meeting on January 30, 2026, that Russia's weapons exports were expected to exceed $15 billion in 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:47 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8qMRPj6ubku)\n\n**Energy Truce: How Russia Endures 'Hellish Humiliation' on Its Knees**\nThe article claims that Russia is facing an 'anomalous nervous radioactivity' due to the alleged news of a '100,000-person humanitarian energy ceasefire' supposedly concluded between Russia and Ukraine. According to the article, this agreement is portrayed as unfavorable to Russia. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared on stage and expressed gratitude for the 'kindness and understanding,' stating that 'Ukraine is not ready for compromises on Donbas and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station' and that 'nothing will be given up without a fight.'

He emphasized that the agreement must be approved by the U.S. Congress before any peace deal with Russia is finalized. Zelenskyy highlighted that territorial integrity is the key issue to be resolved, and Ukraine will not accept any compromise that alters its territorial boundaries. He stressed that the agreement with the U.S. must be signed and ratified by Congress before any final decision is made. The agreement would include provisions to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s military, with Ukraine retaining an 800,000-strong armed force and receiving 'appropriate weapons' after a ceasefire. Zelenskyy also said that territorial disputes\u2014including areas in eastern Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and regions where Russia has indicated willingness to withdraw\u2014must be addressed at the leadership level. He reiterated Ukraine\u2019s willingness to make compromises that could end the war, but clarified: 'This is not a compromise that involves changing Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:39 PM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](https://stcn.com/article/detail/3623727.html)\n\n**'Pause Before Counteroffensive?'

He emphasized the need for caution, noting that recent reconnaissance detected troop concentrations near Kharkiv\u2013Sumy, though this could be a diversion. The real offensive may instead target the southern, Donetsk, or Orikhiv directions. Popov identified key warning signs, including active troop repositioning, increased arms and equipment deliveries, trench digging, and the transport of concrete materials for fortifications. According to Popov, Russia agreed to the pause until February 1, 2026, following a personal request from Donald Trump. However, a Ukrainian presidential aide anonymously confirmed to The New York Times that Kyiv initiated the 'energy ceasefire' and that Russia agreed verbally during recent talks. The agreement is referred to in Kyiv as an 'honorable gentlemen\u2019s agreement' without formal documentation.

According to military bloggers with ties to active units in the Russian Armed Forces, a ban on striking any targets in Kyiv and infrastructure across Ukraine had been issued in the Russian military. This contradicted previous official narratives that Russia would not agree to any ceasefire and would continue targeting Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure to cripple its defense industry. The article claims that the military establishment, referred to as 'Ohranita' (the guardians), initially refused to believe the report, fearing that allowing Ukraine to recover would quickly restore its defense production, increasing Russian casualties. The Kremlin\u2019s silence after Dmitry Peskov refused to comment created tension, which was broken by Donald Trump, who stated he personally requested President Vladimir Putin to suspend attacks on Kyiv and other cities for one week, and that Putin agreed. Trump called it a 'pleasant' achievement. Peskov confirmed on January 31, 2026, that Trump had indeed made a personal request to Putin to halt strikes until February 1, 2026, to create favorable conditions for new peace talks set to begin in the UAE on that date. However, the article notes a critical ambiguity: neither Trump nor Peskov specified when the request was made. The last reported Russian military strike on Ukraine was on January 23, 2026, suggesting the ceasefire may have started earlier than officially acknowledged. The article concludes with skepticism, asking readers to calculate the timeline and implying that the official narrative may be misleading.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:21 PM\nSource:[mk.ru](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2026/01/30/energeticheskoe-peremirie-s-ukrainoy-nachalos-ranshe-chem-o-nem-obyavili.html)\n\n**'Energy Truce' Between Ukraine and Russia: Where the Rumors Came From and What Happened Before**\nOn January 29, 2026, Telegram channels widely circulated claims that Russia had agreed to a temporary 'energy ceasefire' with Ukraine, halting attacks on energy infrastructure starting January 29, including all targets in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast. The rumors originated from alleged Russian military sources and were amplified by Russian media, suggesting the agreement was reached during negotiations in Abu Dhabi on January 23\u201324, 2026, with U.S. participation. The Financial Times had previously reported that Ukrainian and American negotiators proposed an energy ceasefire in exchange for Ukraine halting attacks on Russian oil refineries and the 'shadow fleet'. Ukrainian sources reportedly issued a similar directive to refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure, but no official confirmation has been provided by either Ukraine or Russia. The Kremlin, through spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment, stating, 'I cannot comment on this.' President Volodymyr Zelensky had expressed openness to an energy ceasefire in December 2025, but the Kremlin rejected the idea, claiming it was working on 'peace, not a truce.' In March 2025, a technical-level agreement on a temporary moratorium on attacks was reportedly discussed during talks in Riyadh, though Kyiv and Moscow disagreed on timing. No formal agreement was established, and violations by Russia were frequent. Military expert Alexander Musienko of Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces stated that Russian strikes on energy infrastructure remain a tactic of pressure, not genuine negotiation, and warned that rumors of a ceasefire may signal an upcoming attack. While a ceasefire cannot be ruled out entirely, especially ahead of a February 1 meeting, no official or verified agreement exists as of January 29, 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 01:08 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/energetichne-peremir-ya-ukrayini-ta-rosiyi-1769692093.html)\n\n**Kremlin Suspects Zelensky's Election Push Is a Tactic to Secure a Ceasefire**\nThe Kremlin expressed suspicion that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is only agreeing to hold presidential elections\u2014aligned with demands from Russia and the U.S.\u2014as a strategy to secure a ceasefire. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin international policy advisor, stated, 'It cannot be ruled out that he sees it merely as a way to achieve a ceasefire. That\u2019s all.' Russia has rejected a potential energy truce as a condition for elections, with presidential spokesperson Dmitri Peskov asserting, 'We work for peace, not for a truce,' arguing that a ceasefire would only allow Ukraine to regroup and reinforce its military. In late November, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed it is 'practically impossible, impossible from a legal standpoint' to reach an agreement with Ukraine, citing Zelensky\u2019s loss of 'legitimacy' after failing to hold elections upon the expiration of his mandate in May 2024. Zelensky recently expressed willingness to reform Ukrainian law to enable elections before the war ends, but demanded security guarantees from the U.S. and European allies. He also acknowledged that Russia would only accept a ceasefire if the U.S.-promoted peace framework agreement is signed. Ushakov added that Moscow has not yet received the European-modified version of the U.S. peace plan, noting, 'There will be much that we may not like.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 05:26 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mundo/europa/guerra-rusia-ucrania-el-kremlin-sospecha-que-volodymyr-zelensky-acepta-elecciones-solo-para-lograr-una-tregua-de-rusia-vladimir-putin-ultimas-noticia/)\n\n**Russia Skeptical of Zelensky's Move Toward Elections**\nThe Kremlin expresses skepticism about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's willingness to hold elections, with international policy advisor Yuri Ushakov stating that Zelensky may view elections merely as a means to achieve a ceasefire. Russia has rejected the idea of a truce, asserting it would only allow Ukraine time to rearm and strengthen its military positions. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's presidential spokesperson, emphasized that Russia is working toward peace, not a temporary ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously claimed it is 'practically impossible, impossible from a legal standpoint' to reach an agreement with Kyiv, arguing that Zelensky lost legitimacy by not holding elections after his term expired in May 2024. Zelensky has indicated willingness to amend Ukrainian law to allow elections before the end of the war, but only with security guarantees from the U.S. and European allies. He acknowledged that Russia would only accept a ceasefire if the U.S.-backed peace framework, supported by former President Donald Trump, is formally signed. Ushakov also noted that the Kremlin has not yet received the revised version of the U.S.-proposed peace plan from European mediators and warned that 'there will be much that the Kremlin will not like.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 11:23 AM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2903086/russia-desconfia-de-abertura-de-zelensky-a-eleicoes)\n\n**Zelenskyy: Ukraine Still Insists on Ceasefire Before Signing Agreement with Russia**\nOn December 11, 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated during a press briefing that Ukraine maintains its position that a ceasefire must precede the signing of any formal agreement with Russia. He noted that, according to information received by Ukraine, Russia will not agree to a ceasefire without a preliminary framework agreement in place, a stance that is no longer a secret. While the United States, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Russia, believes only a framework agreement can lead to full de-escalation, Ukraine insists that achieving a ceasefire first is essential. This reflects Ukraine\u2019s continued insistence on a phased approach: ceasefire before formal agreement.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b0\u95fb](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2025-12-12/4177969.html)\n\n**Zelenskyy: Ukraine Insists on Ceasefire Before Signing Any Agreement with Russia**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated on December 11, 2025, during a press conference, that Ukraine remains committed to achieving a ceasefire before signing any formal agreement with Russia.

Zelenskyy emphasized Ukraine's unchanged position: a ceasefire must come first. However, Ukraine has been informed that the only viable path to a ceasefire is through signing a framework agreement. Regarding an energy ceasefire, Zelenskyy said Turkey is developing a plan, and Ukraine is prepared to support it. He also confirmed that the current U.S. stance is to first secure a comprehensive ceasefire before addressing other issues.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202512123589299854.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Officials Expect Zelenskyy to Sign Ceasefire Agreement with Russia Before November 27**\nUkrainian officials, according to a report by Egypt's Al-Qahira News Channel citing the Financial Times, expect President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sign a ceasefire agreement with Russia before November 27, 2025, amid increasing U.S. pressure.

Reports from Reuters indicate that the U.S. shared details of the proposed peace plan with Ukraine just before a new round of talks. Media coverage suggests the plan involves contacts between U.S. and Russian envoys\u2014specifically U.S. Special Presidential Representative Uitkoff and Russian Special Presidential Representative Dimitriev. An anonymous U.S. administration official told Politico that agreements could be reached soon. The article notes that Ukrainian President, under pressure from a major corruption scandal, may be forced to quickly approve the initiative. Russia\u2019s press secretary stated it was too early to speak of progress, noting that no real negotiations followed the Alaska meeting, though contacts occurred. The leak is seen as a sign of Western weakness. Subsequently, Western media raced to publish fragments of the alleged plan, claiming the U.S. had fully accepted Russia\u2019s key demands as ceasefire conditions. Turkish President confirmed Ankara\u2019s recognition of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty after a meeting with Ukrainian President in Istanbul, who also stated that prisoner exchanges could resume before New Year. U.S. sources say Turkey and Qatar were involved in crafting the American peace plan, while other sources suggest Ukraine, with Turkey and European partners, is leading its own initiative. Ukrainian President\u2019s internal political position has weakened due to the corruption scandal, and calls are growing within his party for replacing the head of his office, seen as indirectly linked to the scandal. Despite ongoing fighting, no major breakthroughs have occurred on the frontlines. According to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR) chief General Budanov, the first real window for a ceasefire agreement may open in February 2026. Russian leadership has reportedly tasked its army with capturing all of Donbas by spring 2026 (March\u2013April), with the next goal being to reach Zaporizhzhia and conduct sustained artillery and drone attacks. In a recent attack on Ternopil, 26 people were killed and around 100 injured after 48 missiles and 476 drones were launched, including Kh-101 cruise missiles. Evidence shows the missiles were recently manufactured, indicating Russia may lack significant stockpiles and relies on a strategic reserve. Ukrainian air force reports the missiles were launched from six Tu-95MS and four Tu-160 strategic bombers, suggesting the use of strategic reserves\u2014more active since Ukraine\u2019s earlier strikes on Russian bombers. ATACMS missile attacks may have targeted the Russian air base in Voronezh. GUR chief Budanov stated that Russia\u2019s current strikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure are a deliberate pressure tactic, designed to force negotiations on Russia\u2019s terms. This strategy is expected to be effective only until late February. Russia has attacked Ukraine\u2019s energy system every winter since the war began, but failed to break Ukrainian resistance. The situation in early 2026 may depend on battlefield developments and international dynamics, which could either prolong the war or open space for negotiations. Overnight, Ukrainian drones attacked the Ryazan region, possibly targeting a power plant. Russian ground forces remain passive on the Kursk, Sumy, and Belgorod fronts due to weather. On the Kharkiv front, activity increased slightly without significant changes. Fighting near Kupiansk remains unchanged; Ukrainian forces have not fully cleared the city, and Russian command cannot reinforce. On the Lymansky and Seversky fronts, Russian activity has risen slightly with minor positional gains. The situation in Severodonez\u2019k remains unclear. Russian forces are gradually increasing activity near Chasov Yar, but without major results. Intense fighting continues near Kostiantynivka. No major changes in Pokrovsk or the southern front. Russian attacks near Huliaipole continue, and several assault attempts were made on the Orikhiv direction. The front line remains unchanged.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8364974/rayner-saks-ssha-ne-izvlekli-urokov-iz-svoih-oshibok-teper-ponyatno-chego-dobivaetsya-rossiya)\n\n**Ukraine Agrees to 'Olympic Truce' with Russia Amid Global Call for Ceasefire**\nUkraine has agreed to a temporary ceasefire with Russia during the 2026 Winter Olympics, which will take place from February 6 to February 22, 2026, according to Georgiy Tikhyy, spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tikhyy stated that Ukraine supports Italy\u2019s proposal for a global ceasefire during the Games, which was introduced by Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani in October 2025. However, he cautioned that Russia has previously launched military invasions during Olympic periods, citing the 2008 invasion of Georgia and the 2014 invasion of Ukraine as examples, noting that such actions were strategically timed to attract global media attention. Tikhyy emphasized that Ukraine remains ready for a ceasefire at any time and believes a cessation of hostilities could be achieved before the Olympics begin. The proposal has also been supported by the United Nations. Additionally, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to mediate the conflict and stated that Ukraine and Russia would soon begin peace negotiations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/ukraine/321994_1760133068)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nThe latest developments in Russia-Ukraine ceasefire negotiations (early 2026) center on **upcoming trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5, 2026**, involving Ukraine, Russia, and the US [1][11].
