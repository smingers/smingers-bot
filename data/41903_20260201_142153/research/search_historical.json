Kyiv reported no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Putin's \"Easter truce.\"\n\n2. **Historical Ceasefire Violations**: President Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014 during a February meeting with Donald Trump.\n\n3. **Ilovaysk Incident (August 2014)**: At least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed when withdrawing convoys came under fire, despite agreements allowing pullout.\n\n4. **Minsk-1 (September 5, 2014)**: Broken within hours of signing, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport.\n\n5. **Minsk-2 (February 15, 2015)**: Broken within minutes of going into effect, with OSCE observers reporting mortar and artillery fire.\n\n6. **Failed Ceasefire Attempts**: Multiple failed truces including:\n   - Easter truces in 2016, 2017, 2018\n   - \"School ceasefires\" in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n   - Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n   - \"Bread ceasefires\" in 2017, 2018, 2019\n   - \"Comprehensive ceasefire\" (July 27, 2020) lasted only 20 minutes according to Kyiv, though it halved Ukrainian soldier fatalities in the following year\n\n7. **Russia's Conditions**: Russia insisted on conditions including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters, as well as addressing \"underlying causes of the conflict.\"\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n1. **Matthew Savill** (Director of Military Sciences, Royal United Services Institute, London): States that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith and \"has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives.\" Acknowledges Ukraine bears some responsibility but argues \"the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat.\"\n\n2. **John Herbst** (Former US Ambassador to Kyiv, Atlantic Council): Argues that Russia, not Ukraine, was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords.\n\n3. **Olga Ivshina** (BBC journalist): Reported that Ukraine retook villages in 2016-19, conducted a successful offensive outside Mariupol, and had tanks spotted too close to the frontline. Notes Moscow proclaimed these as violations but \"forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all.\"\n\n4. **Vladislav Surkov** (Former close adviser to Putin, \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics): Celebrated the Minsk accords as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition, stating that peace was \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means.\"\n\n## Political Statements:\n\n1. **President Zelensky**: Suggested the Easter truce format could be the \"easiest\" to extend for 30 days and possibly more. Described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine that allowed Russia to prepare for full-scale invasion.\n\n2. **President Putin**: Says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers intended to implement the Minsk deals.\n\n3. **President Trump**: Said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\" and warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\n\n4. **Russian Officials**: Moscow's stated objectives include a demilitarized, neutral, and non-nuclear Ukraine. Russia demands \"underlying causes of the conflict\" be resolved, suggesting it hasn't moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- The US had tried to organize a 30-day ceasefire but it never took hold.\n- Deep mistrust exists between the two countries due to long history of broken deals.\n- Verification of ceasefire violations is difficult because independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\n- As of article date, there was no indication the Kremlin would accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.publicinternationallawandpolicygroup.org/policy-planning-ukraine-ceasefire\">\n# Summary of Article: Policy Planning Ukraine Ceasefire \u2014 Public International Law & Policy Group\n\n## Key Facts and Information:\n\n**Organization and Purpose:**\n- The Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG) has developed materials to assist Ukraine in preparing for ceasefire negotiations with Russia\n- PILPG has actively supported over two dozen peace negotiations and ceasefire efforts globally and continues these efforts in Ukraine\n\n**Resources Developed:**\nThe organization has created several types of resources:\n\n1. **Policy Planning Papers** - Developed by the PILPG Ceasefire Policy Planning Working Group in collaboration with Ukrainian colleagues, involving retired Generals, policymakers, and subject matter experts\n\n2. **Red Team Initiative** - A sub-group that met intensively over four weeks to analyze Russia's behavior, position, and objectives. The Red Team sought to answer key questions including:\n   - What does Russia want to achieve in a ceasefire that it wasn't able to achieve on the battlefield?\n   - What do Ukrainian negotiators need to be prepared for when facing Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks?\n\n3. **Case Studies** - Produced in partnership with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe and Milbank LLP, investigating prior ceasefire negotiations in the Balkans, Syria, Colombia, and Yemen, analyzing lessons learned for Ukraine\n\n4. **Expert Interviews** - Focused conversations with experts who have worked in various conflict contexts including Darfur, Guatemala, Bosnia and Kosovo\n\n5. **Ceasefire Drafter's Handbook** - A guide drawing from PILPG's experience and comparative analysis of over 200 ceasefire agreements from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America\n\n**Expert Working Group Members:**\n- Brigadier General Robert S.

Full texts of U.S. \u201cfreeze-in-place\u201d drafts (Apr & Nov 2025) and the UK-France-Germany counter-proposal remain unpublished.  \nc.

Russian domestic deliberations (Duma, Security Council) on cease-fire parameters are scarcely covered in open-source English materials.  \ne. Operational planning documents for the proposed EU reassurance force are still limited to concept papers; no rules-of-engagement draft or cost-sharing model is public.  \nf.

Overall picture\n\nBetween November 2023 and February 2026, every pathway toward a sustained cessation of hostilities has hit one of two structural roadblocks: (1) Moscow\u2019s insistence that any cease-fire lock in territorial gains and Ukrainian neutrality, codified in the June 2025 Russian memorandum; and (2) Kyiv\u2019s refusal\u2014backed by the EU and, inconsistently, the United States\u2014to accept a pause divorced from binding security guarantees and a roadmap for full sovereignty. The United States retains agenda-setting power but is internally divided; the European Union is willing to pay the financial and military price of a reassurance force but lacks unity on territorial trade-offs; China offers rhetorical balance but no coercive leverage; and T\u00fcrkiye provides convening space without the clout to forge compromise. As of 1 Feb 2026 no verified cease-fire is in force, the scheduled Abu Dhabi follow-up round is on hold, and the conflict retains a high risk of sudden escalation even as back-channels on prisoners, energy infrastructure and maritime safety continue to function.\n\nNo additional open-source searches appear likely to fill the key documentary gaps (draft texts, Russian internal debates) without leaks or de-classification; hence no new search queries are proposed at this stage.</Agent_report>\n"
