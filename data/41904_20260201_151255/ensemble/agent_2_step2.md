## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Electoral system structural bias** (PubAffairs, POLITICO, EUobserver): Multiple expert sources confirm Tisza needs >3-4pp popular vote margin to win seat plurality due to gerrymandering, winner compensation, and diaspora voting. This is a **structural factor difficult to change** and directly impacts resolution criteria. Shifts probability downward significantly (~15-20pp from naive poll reading).

2. **Polling convergence pattern** (multiple sources): Independent polls consistently show Tisza lead narrowing from 10-12pp (Nov-Jan) to mid-single digits in some recent polls. **Historical pattern** in Hungary shows opposition leads evaporate in final 60 days. Multiple independent sources (Medián, 21 Kutatóközpont, IDEA) confirm trend. Moderate-to-strong evidence of momentum shift against Tisza.

3. **Resource asymmetry** (POLITICO, bne IntelliNews): Government controls 80% of media, full state resources, established ground game. **Institutional factor** that historically favored Fidesz in 2014/18/22 final stretches. Strong evidence for status quo bias.

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Roma controversy impact** (multiple Feb 2026 sources): Lázár's remarks alienated 8-10% of electorate that traditionally votes Fidesz. However, unclear if this translates to Tisza votes or abstention. Single demographic, short-term indicator. Moderate evidence for Tisza opportunity.

5. **Economic stagnation** (Reuters, multiple): 3-year near-stagnation, but Orbán maintains subsidies (3% mortgages, tax exemptions). Logical causal link to voter dissatisfaction, but Fidesz mitigating with spending. Moderate evidence, direction uncertain.

**Weak Evidence:**

6. **Candidate quality** (EUobserver): Tisza fielding newcomers (1/3 women) vs. Fidesz replacing 42 weak candidates. Anecdotal, limited predictive power.

7. **International endorsements** (bne IntelliNews): Netanyahu, Meloni, Weidel back Orbán. Speculative impact on domestic voters.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 71 days to election (April 12, 2026); 89 days to resolution (May 1, 2026).

**If halved (35 days):** Would increase Tisza's chances moderately (+5-7pp). Less time for Fidesz's superior ground game and media saturation to erode Tisza's lead. Historical Hungarian pattern shows most opposition collapse occurs 30-60 days out.

**If doubled (142 days):** Would decrease Tisza's chances significantly (-10-15pp). More time for resource asymmetry to dominate, more opportunity for Fidesz to recover from Roma controversy, and more time for undecided voters (26% per IDEA) to default to status quo.

**Critical window:** Next 30 days (Feb-March) will determine if Tisza can maintain 3-4pp margin needed for seat plurality. Roma controversy is fresh (1 week old); its electoral impact will clarify by mid-February.

## (d) Justification

**Outside view base rate:** 25% (newcomer beating decade-plus incumbent in CEE, adjusted for electoral tilt).

**Upward adjustments (+8-10pp total):**
- Current polling shows Tisza maintaining lead across multiple independent pollsters (Medián +12pp, 21 Kutatóközpont +11pp among decided voters as of mid-Jan). This is **stronger than typical opposition positions** 70 days out in Hungarian history.
- Roma controversy is a **concrete, recent shock** (1 week old) affecting 8-10% of electorate. If even 30% of Roma swing or abstain, that's 2-3pp shift in a tight race. Moderate probability this materializes.
- Tisza has demonstrated organizational capacity (200k at Heroes' Square rally) exceeding past opposition efforts.

**Downward adjustments (-3-5pp total):**
- Polling gap has **narrowed from 12pp to ~6-8pp** in some polls (Real-PR Oct showed Fidesz ahead, though outlier). Momentum appears to favor Fidesz or stabilization.
- **71 days is sufficient time** for Fidesz's media/resource advantages to compress further. Historical reference class shows this timeframe as dangerous for challengers.
- **Undecided voters (26%)** historically break toward incumbents in Hungary, especially under information asymmetry.

**Net adjustment:** +5pp from outside view base rate of 25% → **30%**.

**Verification against structural threshold:** Tisza needs ~4pp popular vote margin on election day. Current mid-range estimate is ~7-8pp lead (averaging independent polls). Historical volatility suggests 50% chance this narrows below 4pp by April 12. If Tisza maintains >4pp, seat plurality probability is ~70-80% (accounting for system bias). Combined: 0.50 × 0.75 ≈ 37.5%. This upper bound corroborates 30% as reasonable given downside risks.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 25%, the inside view evidence suggests modest upward revision:

**Key factors increasing probability:**
1. Tisza maintains polling lead across multiple independent sources 71 days out (stronger position than typical opposition)
2. Recent Roma controversy creates concrete demographic risk for Fidesz
3. Tisza organizational capacity demonstrated

**Key factors limiting increase:**
1. Electoral system requires 3-4pp margin; current lead may not suffice
2. Polling momentum shows narrowing trend
3. Resource asymmetry and historical pattern of late opposition collapse
4. 71 days is sufficient for Fidesz advantages to manifest

**Calibrated probability:** The evidence supports moving from 25% to approximately **30-32%**. The Roma controversy and sustained polling lead warrant upward adjustment, but structural barriers and momentum trends prevent higher confidence. 

Settling on **31%** as the inside view prediction, reflecting:
- ~40% chance Tisza maintains >4pp margin on election day
- ~75% chance this converts to seat plurality given system bias
- Combined probability: 0.40 × 0.75 ≈ 30%
- +1pp for organizational capacity edge over historical opposition

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Tisza win more seats than Fidesz-KDNP in Hungary's April 12, 2026 election? Resolved by official results by May 1, 2026.

2. **Base rate:** 25% from reference class (newcomer vs. entrenched incumbent in CEE with electoral system bias). Final prediction 31% is anchored to this base rate with modest inside-view adjustment.

3. **Consistency:** "31 out of 100 times, Tisza wins more seats than Fidesz." This aligns with: Tisza currently leads polls but faces structural disadvantages and narrowing momentum; outcome highly uncertain but Fidesz remains favorite.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Electoral system requires Tisza to win popular vote by >3-4pp for seat plurality (structural, high confidence)
   - Polling lead narrowed from 12pp to 6-8pp over 2 months (trend, high confidence)
   - Roma controversy affects 8-10% of electorate, traditionally Fidesz voters (demographic shock, medium confidence)
   - 80% government media control and resource asymmetry (institutional, high confidence)
   - 71 days allows time for Fidesz ground game to compress race (historical pattern, medium-high confidence)

5. **Blind spot:** Tisza's lead could prove more durable than historical opposition due to Magyar's unique profile (ex-insider, conservative credentials). If Roma controversy cascades into broader government legitimacy crisis, or if economic pain accelerates, Tisza could maintain 5-6pp margin, making seat plurality likely (~60-70%). This would make 31% look overly conservative.

6. **Status quo:** Fidesz has won every election since 2010. Volatility is moderate (new strong opposition, but entrenched incumbent). 71-day timeframe is short-to-medium. Slight nudge toward status quo already embedded in 31% (vs. naive 50% from current polling).

Probability: 31%
