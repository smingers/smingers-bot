Analysis:
1) Resolution-focused restatement
Resolves **Yes** if, in Hungary’s **April 12, 2026** parliamentary election, the **official final seat totals** show **Tisza Party > Fidesz–KDNP** seats (strictly more). **No** otherwise. Source: official results portal (vtr.valasztas.hu/ogy2026).

(a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and what’s fact vs opinion)

- DailyNewsHungary (Jan 30, 2026) – Tisza policy messaging (euro adoption, end rule-by-decree).
  - Quality: Medium-low for forecasting seats; useful for campaign positioning, not measurement.
  - Fact vs opinion: Facts = stated policy positions and personnel; opinion = claims about “competence” resonance.

- POLITICO “Poll of Polls” page (extraction incomplete/dated artifact)
  - Quality: Unclear from provided extract because the key numbers/trend are missing here. I treat it as weak evidence in this packet.

- PubAffairs Bruxelles (Zselyke Csaky, CER fellow) (undated in excerpt but clearly about 2026 context; includes polling)
  - Quality: Medium-high analysis outlet with identifiable author; cites polling averages from analyst Gábor Tóka.
  - Facts: election date; cited polling levels (~44 Tisza, ~41 Fidesz); system bias claims referencing past vote→seat disproportionality (2022).
  - Opinions/expert judgment: “Tisza needs >3pp popular-vote lead to win due to bias” (plausible and echoed elsewhere, but still an expert assertion).

- Central European Times (Dec 18, 2025) – 21 Kutatóközpont poll
  - Quality: Medium (single poll, not fully auditable here).
  - Facts: reported toplines (e.g., Tisza 49 vs Fidesz 38 among party-choosers).
  - Opinions: “realignment” characterization, and implications for Fidesz recoverability.

- EUobserver (Jan 15, 2026) – Medián poll: Tisza +12 among certain voters; candidate rollout details
  - Quality: High-medium. EUobserver is reputable; Medián is a known independent pollster (as represented here).
  - Facts: mixed electoral system seat counts (199 total; 106 SMC + 93 list); Medián lead magnitude; campaign/candidate facts.
  - Opinions: “unprecedented deficit” framing (though supported by historical context).

- POLITICO explainer (Jan 15, 2026) – claims Poll of Polls: Tisza 49, Fidesz 37; structural/media tilt; “dirty tricks” expectations from Tarr; expert commentary from Bene/Metz (TK Institute)
  - Quality: High. Named experts; system description is directly relevant.
  - Facts: system structure; campaign start date; media market share claim (~80%).
  - Opinions: Metz/Bene assessments of competitive tilt; Tarr’s “dirty tricks” expectations.

Asknews articles (late Jan–Feb 1, 2026):
- AP (Jan 31, 2026) and other syndicated foreign-language pickups (RFI, Ouest-France, etc.) – Roma remarks controversy and protests
  - Quality: AP is high; the republished/translated variants are medium and mostly duplicative.
  - Facts: Lázár remarks; protest size (~1,000); Fidesz concern about Roma bloc; context that polls show Tisza leading (often without methodological detail).
  - Opinions: speculation about electoral impact; claims about political motives.

- Reuters via Straits Times (Jan 31, 2026) – Orbán denies austerity; notes stagnation/deficit; Fitch outlook negative
  - Quality: High. Macro context can affect incumbent vote share.
  - Facts: deficit target changes; Fitch negative outlook; stagnation; pre-election spending measures.
  - Opinions: economists’ expectations about post-election tightening.

- bne IntelliNews (Jan 14, 2026) – election date mechanics; notes Tisza rally size; details on structural advantages and diaspora voting rules
  - Quality: Medium-high. Detailed institutional context; some claims (crowd sizes, “leaks”) are softer.
  - Facts: legal timeline; voting rules and asymmetries; structural advantages described.
  - Opinions: “high-stakes contest” framing; implications for outcome.

- Magyar Nemzet (Jan 30–31, 2026) – pro-government messaging attacking Tisza
  - Quality: Low for inference about true electoral standing (high partisanship), but useful as evidence of Fidesz strategy.
  - Facts: what Fidesz officials said (messaging content).
  - Opinions/propaganda: characterizations of Tisza as provocateurs/Brussels tool.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (materially moves the forecast)
1) Structural/institutional bias in translating votes to seats (mixed system + SMC geography + “winner compensation” + districting + state resource/media advantage).
   - Supported across POLITICO experts + PubAffairs + bne IntelliNews; matches Hungary 2010–2022 disproportionality.
   - Direction: pushes toward **No** (Fidesz seat advantage even if vote is close).

2) Multiple reputable sources citing a meaningful Tisza polling lead close to election (EUobserver/Medián + POLITICO Poll of Polls; also referenced by Reuters contextually).
   - Direction: pushes toward **Yes** (if lead is real and sustained, it can overcome structural tilt).

Moderate evidence (nudges, but not decisive alone)
3) Economic stagnation + fiscal looseness + credit outlook deterioration (Reuters/Fitch).
   - Mechanism: anti-incumbent sentiment; but Orbán has repeatedly survived economic headwinds with targeted transfers and message discipline.
   - Slight push toward **Yes**.

4) Roma remarks controversy (AP) potentially weakening a historically Fidesz-leaning bloc (Roma share ~8–10%).
   - Mechanism: could matter in close SMCs via turnout/defection; but translation from outrage → vote switch is uncertain.
   - Small-to-moderate push toward **Yes**.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
5) Tisza policy announcements (euro adoption, ending emergency rule) and day-to-day campaign antics (domain name story).
   - Likely second-order compared to structure and topline polling.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until election day: **70 days** (from Feb 1 to Apr 12, 2026). Resolution by May 1.
- If timeframe were halved (~35 days left): I would expect **less volatility** from campaign dynamics, and would lean a bit more on current polling → slightly higher confidence in the current leader (small move toward **Yes**, maybe +2–4pp).
- If timeframe were doubled (~140 days left): much more time for incumbency/media advantages, opposition errors, rule changes, and agenda shocks → more regression to the historical/status quo pattern (move toward **No**, maybe −4–7pp).

(d) Justification: updating the outside view (25%) to an inside view
Outside view anchor: **25%** Yes (Tisza seat plurality) based on (i) Hungary 2010–2022 reference class dominance by Fidesz and (ii) acknowledged vote→seat bias requiring Tisza to win by a clear margin.

Why update upward at all?
- The current cycle appears atypical versus the reference class because **credible independent polling now places Tisza ahead**, in some reports by **~10–12 points among decided/certain voters** (EUobserver/Medián; POLITICO). If that were even roughly correct at election time, the structural advantage likely becomes insufficient to keep Fidesz ahead in seats.
- Additionally, there is **new downside risk to Fidesz coalition maintenance** (Roma controversy) and continued macro drag (stagnation/deficit) that plausibly reduces the chance of a late Fidesz rebound.

Why not update to >50%?
- The single biggest seat-relevant factor remains the **SMC-heavy, pro-incumbent electoral translation** plus **state/media resource asymmetry**. This creates a wide band of popular-vote outcomes where Tisza can “win the vote but lose the seats,” and it increases the payoff to any late-campaign swing.
- Poll uncertainty is unusually large (explicitly noted divergence between pro-government vs independent polling in the materials). That warrants conservatism: treat headline leads as real-but-noisy, not as determinative.

Probability calibration
I model three coarse scenarios for *seat plurality* (not popular vote), weighting toward structural/status quo:

1) Tisza finishes with a clear national lead (≈4–5pp+) and avoids SMC underperformance → Tisza likely wins more seats.
2) Race is close (within ~3pp) → Fidesz more likely to win more seats due to SMC/district and resource advantages.
3) Fidesz leads (≈3pp+) → Fidesz very likely wins more seats.

Given current information (credible reports of Tisza leading, but with high uncertainty and a known pro-Fidesz seat bias), I put more mass on scenario (2) than the toplines alone suggest.

Net update: from **25%** to **33%** for “Tisza wins more seats than Fidesz–KDNP.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will official final 2026 Hungarian parliamentary seat totals show Tisza strictly exceeding Fidesz–KDNP?
2. Outside view base rate: 25% Yes.
3. Consistency check: 33 out of 100 times, Tisza ends with more seats than Fidesz–KDNP—despite structural bias and incumbency advantages.
4. Key evidence (most significant):
   - Mixed system + SMC/districting/media/state-resource tilt favors Fidesz in seats.
   - Multiple reputable sources cite Tisza leading by ~10–12pp in some polls near Feb 2026.
   - High polling divergence/measurement uncertainty; late incumbency consolidation is plausible.
   - Economic stagnation + fiscal strain adds anti-incumbent pressure.
5. Blind spot: If independent polls are systematically overstating Tisza (turnout/hidden Fidesz vote), my 33% is too high (would drop toward ~15–20%).
6. Status quo outcome: Fidesz has retained power and seat pluralities repeatedly; I keep a meaningful pull toward No.

Probability: 33%
