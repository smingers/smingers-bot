Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, newest first)

• Ouest-France, Espreso, Eurointegration, RFI, AP (31 Jan-1 Feb 2026) – Factual core: minister János Lázár’s anti-Roma remarks triggered 1 000+-person Budapest protest; Roma traditionally lean Fidesz, risk of defection.  Opinion: opposition/Tisza exploiting scandal.  Quality: mainstream wire/print; dates within 48 h → reliable current facts.

• Straits Times/Reuters (31 Jan 2026) – Orbán denies post-election austerity while deficits rise; economists disagree.  Quality: high; contains macro facts and expert quotes.

• Magyar Nemzet (31 Jan 2026 x2) – Pro-government daily; alleges Tisza “provocateurs” and portrays Orbán as sole Ukraine shield.  Provides insight into campaign framing more than neutral facts.  Bias acknowledged.

• EUobserver, POLITICO, PubAffairs, bne IntelliNews, Central European Times, Rzeczpospolita, Budapester Zeitung (Dec 2025-Jan 2026) – Consistent polling snapshots from independent institutes (Medián, IDEA, 21 Kutatóközpont): Tisza lead 10-12 pp among decided voters; some note narrowing trend.  Quality: reputable regional outlets citing named pollsters and sample sizes.

• TASS, TVN24 (Oct 2025-Jan 2026) – Include government-aligned or Russian-language commentary; acknowledge large rallies and poll divergence; useful mainly for noting partisan poll spread.

• Politico Poll-of-Polls page (continually updated) – Jan 15 snapshot 49 (Tisza)-37 (Fidesz).  Method: weighted aggregation of publicly released polls.  High transparency.

• Historical baseline: 2014, 2018, 2022 official results (Hungarian National Election Office).  Fidesz seat share 66-68 % each cycle.  High quality, structural fact.

2. Evidence analysis (using weighting scheme)

Strong evidence
• Structural bias of mixed system (106 single-member districts, list fragment bonus, gerrymandering) favouring largest party – documented by academic Gábor Tóka, TK Institute, and official 2022 data (53 % vote ⇒ 68 % seats).  
• Independent polls (Medián, IDEA, 21 Kutatóközpont, Politico aggregation) show Tisza +10-12 pp national lead among certain voters – multiple, methodologically transparent, mutually consistent.  

Moderate evidence
• Roma backlash after Lázár scandal could dent Fidesz turnout in key rural districts – plausible but magnitude unmeasured.  
• Evidence of polling-house polarisation (gov-aligned Századvég shows Fidesz +6) – suggests high measurement error.  
• Economic malaise & Fitch negative outlook may erode incumbent support; past CEE cases (Croatia 2015, Slovakia 2020) show economic grievances can flip pluralities.

Weak evidence
• Claims of “dirty tricks / AI fakes” by Tisza officials – speculative.  
• Crowd-size comparisons at October rallies – anecdotal.

3. Timeframe analysis

• 70 days until ballots; official campaign starts 21 Feb.  
• Late-campaign swings in Hungary historically ≤ 5 pp.  Halving window to 35 days would slightly increase weight on already-banked lead; doubling to 140 days would widen uncertainty and raise Fidesz comeback odds.

4. Justification – moving from outside to inside view

Outside-view base (1 Feb build): 29 % chance Tisza seat plurality, driven by Fidesz incumbency + system tilt.

Inside-view adjustments  
+12 %  Independent polling advantage (strong evidence) – Tisza currently exceeds the ∼3-5 pp popular-vote hurdle by a factor of 2-3.  
+5 %  Fidesz Roma controversy plus stagnant economy raise risk of further slippage.  
-6 %  Structural seat bias, gerrymander, expatriate mail vote, state-media dominance remain intact.  
-3 %  Execution risk of a two-year-old party fielding 106 SMC candidates, ground game unknown.  
Net shift: +8 pp.

Probability calibration:

Final estimate: 45 %  

Interpretation: In roughly 45 out of 100 comparable 2026-style elections held today, the official seat tally would show the Tisza Party with strictly more seats than Fidesz-KDNP.  Small ±10 pp shocks (e.g., polling error, turnout differential) plausibly flip the outcome.

Checklist:

1. Restated question – “By May 2026 will Tisza have more seats than Fidesz-KDNP in the 199-seat National Assembly elected 12 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base rate 29 %, updated to 45 % via current polls vs structural tilt.  
3. Consistency line – “45 out of 100 times, Tisza wins the seat count.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Poll-of-polls Tisza +12 pp.  
   • Electoral system gives Fidesz ≈+4 pp seat bonus.  
   • Roma backlash threatens Fidesz rural margins.  
   • New-party organisational risk for Tisza.  
5. Blind-spot – Coordinated opposition vote-splitting or late legal change boosting Fidesz SMC edge could drop Tisza seat haul below expectations.  
6. Status-quo bias noted; kept probability below 50 %.

Probability: 45%
