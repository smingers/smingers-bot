Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, Jan–1 Feb 2026)

1. EUobserver 15 Jan 2026 – Independent Brussels-based outlet, long record of factual political reporting. Gives Medián poll (Tisza +12 among certain voters) and hard numbers on Hungary’s 199-seat mixed system and candidate filings.  Strong factual value, very recent.

2. POLITICO “5 key questions”, 15 Jan 2026 – Major European newsroom, transparent poll-of-polls methodology. Shows Tisza 49 %, Fidesz 37 %. Adds expert quotes on structural seat bias.  High quality; mixture of facts (polls, rules) and sourced opinion (named academics).

3. PubAffairs Bruxelles op-ed by Zselyke Csaky, 15 Jan 2026 – Think-tank piece; gives Gábor Tóka polling averages (Tisza 44 %, Fidesz 41 %) and explains that a 3 pp vote lead is needed to beat bias.  Moderate quality (single analyst, clear disclosure).

4. Medián poll via hvg.hu / Rzeczpospolita 14 Jan 2026 – Well-regarded Hungarian pollster; Tisza +12.  High data quality, single source.

5. 21 Kutatóközpont poll, Central European Times 18 Dec 2025 – Independent Budapest institute; Tisza +8 (all adults) to +17 (certain voters).  Moderate quality, older.

6. IDEA poll, 15 Dec 2025 – University-linked institute; Tisza +7-9.  Moderate quality, one month old.

7. Magyar Nemzet & Ouest-France / AP / RFI, 31 Jan–1 Feb 2026 – Cover Roma backlash after János Lázár’s remarks.  Factual protest numbers from AP; Magyar Nemzet partisan, but confirms government concern.  Weak–moderate predictive value (possible turnout/loyalty swing).

8. Straits Times / Reuters 31 Jan 2026 – Macro-economic piece quoting Orbán. Reputable wire; useful for economic headwinds context.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent polls in Jan 2026 put Tisza ahead by 7-12 pp (sources 1–4).  
• Structural electoral bias: needs c. 4-5 pp popular-vote cushion (sources 1–3).  
• Fidesz enjoys entrenched advantages (gerrymander, media, diaspora mail vote) which historically converted <53 % votes into 68 % seats in 2022 (source 3).  

Moderate evidence  
• Poll divergence: pro-government houses show Fidesz +6-7 (source Hungarian Conservative, 19 Jan – not used for weighting, but divergence signals measurement uncertainty).  
• Roma controversy may shave a few points from Fidesz in some districts (sources 7).  
• Macroeconomic stagnation & Fitch negative outlook → anti-incumbent mood (source 8).  

Weak evidence  
• Crowd sizes at rallies, anecdotal campaign incidents.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• 71 days until polls close (12 Apr 2026).  In European elections, average late-campaign swing ≈ ±3 pp; swings ≥ 5 pp occur ~20 % of the time.  
• If we were 35 days out, less time for reversion → probability would rise by ~3 pp.  
• If 140 days out, wider uncertainty → probability would fall by ~3-4 pp.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline (regional dominant-party turnover class) = 27 %  
–7 pp Bias: Tisza must win vote by > 4 pp and district map still uncertain.  
–3 pp Diaspora mail votes & media dominance historically worth ~1-2 pp to Fidesz.  
+12 pp Current independent polling shows Tisza lead well above bias threshold.  
+6 pp Economy weak, fresh ethnic-relations scandal hurting incumbent mobilisation.  

Net = 35 % (rounded).  Sensitivity: ±5 pp subjective 1σ.

Probability calibration:

“I expect that roughly 35 out of 100 times, the official seat count on 1 May 2026 would show Tisza with more seats than Fidesz–KDNP.”

Checklist (abridged)

1. Event: by 1 May 2026 Tisza holds strictly more seats than Fidesz-KDNP.  
2. Base rate 27 %, final 35 % anchored and adjusted.  
3. Consistency line above – passes sense check.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Independent polls Tisza +7-12 (strong).  
   • 4-5 pp seat-bias hurdle (structural).  
   • Fidesz institutional/media edge (structural).  
   • Economic stagnation & Roma controversy (momentum).  
5. Blind spot: major last-minute external shock (e.g., security crisis) swinging undecideds to the “safe choice”. Could cut Tisza vote lead to ≤ 3 pp.  
6. Status-quo inertia favours continued Fidesz dominance → small downward nudge already incorporated.

Probability: 35%
