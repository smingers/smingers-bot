Analysis:
The key to judging whether the brand-new Tisza Party can out-seat the governing Fidesz–KDNP coalition in 2026 is (a) understanding Hungary’s mixed electoral system and how vote share translates into seats, (b) reviewing every Hungarian parliamentary result since 2010 to see the size of Fidesz’s historical dominance, and (c) collating the handful of polls taken since the Tisza Party’s late-2025 launch to gauge its momentum versus Fidesz. I therefore need sources that give: official past seat totals, recent nationwide polling and seat-projection articles, details on the Tisza Party’s creation, and analysis of the electoral rules that could amplify or blunt its vote share.
