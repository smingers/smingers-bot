Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
