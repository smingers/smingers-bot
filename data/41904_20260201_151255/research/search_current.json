PubAffairs Bruxelles  \n**Author**: Zselyke Csaky, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Election Date**: Hungary's parliamentary elections are scheduled for April 12, 2026\n\n2. **Current Polling** (based on polling averages collected by political analyst G\u00e1bor T\u00f3ka):\n   - Tisza Party: ~44%\n   - Fidesz: ~41%\n   - Mi Haz\u00e1nk (Our Homeland): ~6%\n   - Note: Independent pollsters show Tisza leading by as much as 10 percentage points, while pro-government polling shows Fidesz ahead by 6-7 percentage points\n\n3. **Polling Trend**: The gap between Tisza and Fidesz has been narrowing since summer 2025\n\n4. **Electoral System Impact**: \n   - In 2022, Fidesz received 53% of the popular vote but 68% of the seats\n   - According to polling experts, Tisza would need to win the popular vote by more than 3 percentage points to secure an election victory due to the system's bias toward Fidesz\n\n5. **Electoral Threshold**: 5% required for parliamentary representation\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been in power for more than 15 years\n- This is the first time Orb\u00e1n faces a strong opponent who could potentially defeat him\n- The traditional left-right political divide has collapsed, replaced by an opposition-to-Fidesz alignment\n- P\u00e9ter Magyar (leader of Tisza Party) is a conservative politician and ex-husband of Fidesz's former justice minister\n- Left-liberal parties (Democratic Coalition and Momentum) have been \"decimated\"\n- Current polls suggest a three-party parliament as most likely outcome\n\n## Electoral System Features:\n\n- Mixed system with \"winner compensation\" that favors the largest party\n- Gerrymandering benefits Fidesz (some Fidesz strongholds are smaller than average voting districts)\n- Ethnic Hungarian vote beyond Hungary's borders strongly favors Fidesz\n- Elected minority representative has traditionally aligned with Fidesz\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\nAccording to polling experts cited in the article, the electoral system disproportionately favors Fidesz, requiring Tisza to win by more than 3 percentage points in the popular vote to secure victory.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://centraleuropeantimes.com/tisza-party-widens-lead-in-hungary-poll-suggests/\">\n# Summary of Article:

Kutat\u00f3k\u00f6zpont:**\n- Among all adults: Tisza Party 34%, Fidesz-KDNP 26%\n- Among respondents who could name a preferred party: Tisza 49%, Fidesz-KDNP 38%\n- Among certain voters: Tisza leads by 17 percentage points\n- These figures represent Tisza Party's highest support recorded to date by this polling institute\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n- Compared to a late-November survey, the changes are modest and largely within the poll's margin of error\n- Tisza Party's numbers edged up slightly\n- Fidesz support dipped modestly\n- Pollsters characterize this as a \"re-alignment\" rather than a dramatic shift\n\n## Opinions and Analysis:\n\n**From political commentators (unnamed):**\n- A double-digit deficit at this stage of the campaign could be difficult for Fidesz to overcome, particularly if 21 Kutat\u00f3k\u00f6zpont's trends are confirmed by other polling\n\n**Context noted by analysts:**\n- Other recent surveys have reported somewhat varied results\n- Some polls show narrower differences between the two major parties\n- This underscores the fluidity of public opinion as the campaign continues\n\n## Additional Context:\n- The 2026 general election campaign is increasingly underway\n- Fidesz-KDNP's recent recovery has stalled according to this poll\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://euobserver.com/rule-of-law/ar6b59c2fe\">\n# Summary of Article: \"87 days to election: Hungary sees widening gap in favour of Tisza over Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz\"\n\n**Source:** EUobserver  \n**Date:** January 15, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Election Date:** Hungary's parliamentary elections officially set for April 12, 2026\n\n2. **Parliamentary Structure:** 199 total seats\n   - 106 MPs elected in single-member constituencies (first-past-the-post)\n   - 93 seats allocated proportionally from national party lists\n\n3. **Latest Polling Data (Medi\u00e1n Institute):**\n   - Tisza Party leads Fidesz by 12 percentage points among voters certain to choose a party (as of January 2026)\n   - This represents an increase from a 10-percentage-point lead in November 2025\n   - This deficit is unprecedented for Fidesz in the past 16 years of uninterrupted rule since 2010, especially this close to an election\n   - Four years ago (at comparable point before 2022 election), Fidesz was already leading the then-united opposition\n\n4. **Candidate Information:**\n   - **Tisza Party:** Presented candidates in November, fielding exclusively political newcomers; approximately one-third are women\n   - **Fidesz:** Presented 106 candidates, replacing 42 of its 2022 candidates in constituencies where polling shows weakening support and Tisza appears more competitive; only 14 out of 106 candidates (13.2%) are women (double the 2022 number but still low)\n\n5. **Support Trends:**\n   - Tisza has drawn support primarily from smaller opposition parties rather than directly from Fidesz\n   - Democratic Coalition has fallen to around 1% support (described as \"once significant\")\n   - Fidesz support has \"at best stagnated and in some groups has slightly declined\"\n\n## Other Developments:\n\n-

**Diplomatic Tensions:** Dispute between P\u00e9ter Magyar and Slovak leadership over Bene\u0161 Decrees and use of term \"Felvid\u00e9k\"\n- **Asylum Controversy:** Hungary granted asylum/refugee status to former Polish officials (Marcin Romanowski and Zbigniew Ziobro), justifying it as protection from \"political vendetta\"\n\n## Notable Context:\nThe article characterizes this as \"a contest without precedent in the region over the past decade and a half,\" led by P\u00e9ter Magyar, described as \"a new opposition figure who previously moved within the orbit of the governing elite.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-fidesz-peter-magyar-tisza-5-key-questions-election-2026/\">\n# Summary of POLITICO Article: \"Hungary: 5

Controversial Remarks by Minister J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r**\nHungarian Transport Minister J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r sparked national outrage by stating during a public rally that if no migrants were available to clean Intercit\u00e9s train toilets\u2014due to Hungarian voters' reluctance to do so\u2014then internal reserves, specifically Roma citizens, would have to be used. The remark, widely seen as contemptuous toward Hungary's approximately 800,000 Roma people (8% of the population), prompted widespread condemnation. L\u00e1z\u00e1r, considered a potential successor to Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, apologized\u2014a rare move for him\u2014but did not quell calls for his resignation from Roma associations and the opposition. The incident occurred ahead of the April 12 legislative elections, during which Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party seeks a fifth consecutive term. Opposition groups, including Momentum, protested by placing hundreds of toilet brushes at the entrance of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s estate, while the Tisza party, leading in polls, broadcast L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s comments in Roma neighborhoods. Despite some Roma support for Fidesz since 2010, the controversy has intensified scrutiny. L\u00e1z\u00e1r defended himself by citing a successful pilot program to end Roma school segregation during his tenure as mayor. Meanwhile, Orb\u00e1n released videos featuring Romani music (mulat\u00f3s) and engaged with the influential Romani figure Kis Gr\u00f3fo, who publicly condemned racist rhetoric against Roma. However, the backlash suggests such gestures may not be sufficient to repair the damage.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/europe/hongrie/en-hongrie-les-roms-cibles-avant-les-elections-ae1f633a-fdea-11f0-8cae-30ca3642bcdf)\n\n**Over 1,000 Protest in Budapest Demand Resignation of Hungarian Minister Over Racist Remarks on Roma**\nOver 1,000 protesters, many representing Hungary's Romani community, gathered in Budapest on January 31 to demand the resignation of Minister J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r from Viktor Orb\u00e1n's government following provocative remarks described by attendees as racist. The protest was triggered by L\u00e1z\u00e1r's statement at a public forum in early January, in which he referred to Roma people as a domestic labor reserve capable of performing undesirable work, such as cleaning toilets in intercity trains, saying, 'If there are no migrants, and someone has to clean other people\u2019s toilets, then we must use our internal reserves. Hungarian voters don\u2019t have much enthusiasm to clean others\u2019 toilets, so the internal reserve is the Roma in Hungary. That\u2019s reality.' The comments sparked widespread backlash, raising concerns within the government that they could alienate Romani voters, a traditionally reliable bloc for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party. Prominent Romani leaders and celebrities condemned the remarks on social media, and a group of Romani activists disrupted L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s forum that week, demanding his resignation. L\u00e1z\u00e1r publicly apologized, claiming his statements were misinterpreted. At the protest, where demonstrators carried Romani flags and toilet brushes as symbolic references to the remarks, Romani musician Istv\u00e1n S\u00edlv\u00e1si stated, 'This deeply offended our humanity, our children, our parents, our ancestors, our culture, and our future. L\u00e1z\u00e1r won\u2019t resign, the government won\u2019t resign, but that\u2019s okay. However, on April 12, we will know who we should vote for.' Many were angered by L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s distinction between Roma and Hungarians, implying that Roma are not full members of the nation, and rejected the notion that Roma should be relegated to low-paying, undesirable labor. The ruling Fidesz party attempted to defuse tensions by accusing the opposition right-center party Tisza of inciting division between Roma and non-Roma Hungarians. Tisza party leader and prime ministerial candidate P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay condemned L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s comments.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:25 AM\nSource:[espreso.tv](https://espreso.tv/svit-nazvav-romiv-trudovim-rezervom-u-budapeshti-proyshov-masoviy-protest-cherez-zayavi-ministra-z-uryadu-orbana)\n\n**Mass Protest in Budapest Over Controversial Remarks by Minister L\u00e1z\u00e1r**\nOver 1,000 protesters, many from Hungary's Romani community, gathered in Budapest on Saturday evening to demand the resignation of Minister J\u00e1nos L\u00e1z\u00e1r following his controversial remarks described as racist. The protest, reported by 'Europay' citing AP, took place outside L\u00e1z\u00e1r's office, with demonstrators calling for an apology and his removal from office. The Romani population in Hungary, estimated at around 1 million\u2014over 10% of the total population\u2014is the largest but most marginalized minority. Historically, Roma face poverty, systemic discrimination, segregation, and periodic racial violence. At a community forum earlier in the month, L\u00e1z\u00e1r sparked outrage by describing Roma as an 'internal labor reserve' to address Hungary\u2019s chronic labor shortage, stating, 'If migrants aren't available, and someone must clean toilets in intercity trains, we must use our internal reserves... the Roma in Hungary.' His comments triggered widespread backlash and concern within the government that they could alienate Roma voters, traditionally a reliable base for Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party. Prominent Romani leaders and celebrities voiced anger on social media, and a group of Romani activists disrupted another forum hosted by L\u00e1z\u00e1r that week, demanding his resignation. L\u00e1z\u00e1r publicly apologized, claiming his statements were misinterpreted. At the protest, Romani musician Istv\u00e1n S\u00edlv\u00e1sh\u00ed said the remarks deeply offended the patriotism of Hungarian Roma, stating they 'deeply hurt us as people, our children, parents, ancestors, culture, and future.' He added, 'L\u00e1z\u00e1r won\u2019t resign, the government won\u2019t resign, but it\u2019s not scary. On April 12, we will learn whom we should vote for.' Meanwhile, polling shows opposition party Tisza, led by P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, maintains a 10-percentage-point lead over Fidesz. Orb\u00e1n previously stated he is not afraid of losing the next elections and identified Brussels\u2014not M\u00e1rki-Zay\u2014as his main opponent.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:02 AM\nSource:[\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2026/02/1/7230229/)\n\n**Hungary: Protesters Carry Toilet Brushes Against Minister\u2019s Anti-Roma Remarks**\nSeveral hundred people marched in Budapest on Saturday, January 31, protesting against remarks made by Hungarian Transport Minister Janos Lazar, who stated on January 22 that Roma people would be ideal for cleaning train toilets. Protesters carried brooms for cleaning toilets and the Rom flag, symbolizing resistance to ethnic stereotyping. The comments sparked national outrage, prompting celebrities and citizens, both Roma and non-Roma, to post selfies holding brooms. The Roma minority, making up 8\u201310% of Hungary\u2019s population, typically votes for Viktor Orban\u2019s Fidesz party, but the minister\u2019s remarks have caused concern ahead of the April 12 parliamentary elections, as Fidesz trails in polls behind conservative opposition leader P\u00e9ter Magyar and his Tisza party. Protesters like Lajos, a high school teacher, and Greta, a waitress, condemned the remarks and the government\u2019s broader policies, citing damage to education and public health. Although the minister apologized, stating he did not intend to offend Roma people, analysts suggest his comments were politically motivated, aiming to appeal to far-right voters despite risking alienation of the Roma community.

L\u00e1z\u00e1r described the Roma as an 'internal reserve' of labor, suggesting they should perform undesirable jobs\u2014such as cleaning toilets on intercity trains\u2014because ethnic Hungarians are unwilling to do so.

Protesters at the demonstration in front of L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s office carried Romani flags and toilet brushes as symbolic protest items. Istv\u00e1n Solt\u00e9sz, a Roma demonstrator, said Roma people have contributed to Hungary\u2019s history through wars and revolutions but are consistently treated as second-class citizens. Roma musician Istv\u00e1n Szilv\u00e1si stated the remarks deeply offended Roma patriotism, humanity, and cultural dignity. L\u00e1z\u00e1r issued a public apology, claiming his statements were misinterpreted, but critics argue he reinforced harmful racial distinctions by implying Roma are not full members of the Hungarian nation. The governing Fidesz party blamed the opposition Tisza party for stoking ethnic division.

Speaking at a rally in Hatvan, northeast of Budapest, for members of his ruling party Fidesz \u2013 Hungarian Civic Union, Orb\u00e1n criticized European pressure, comparing Brussels-driven decisions to a game of table tennis, and questioned why Hungary must choose between Ukraine and Russia. He affirmed that Hungary\u2019s foreign policy is based on its own interests, including cooperation with both Eastern and Western nations. Orb\u00e1n confirmed Hungary\u2019s continued purchase of gas and energy resources from Russia, with plans to source from Ukraine after the war ends, and expressed interest in maintaining active economic and investment ties with China. He reiterated that Hungary will not financially support Kyiv, as it does not wish to prolong the military conflict. Orb\u00e1n dismissed Western hopes of defeating Russia or securing reparations and debt repayment as illusions, warning that Ukraine\u2019s leadership and Brussels failed to heed his 2024 warning that defeating a nuclear power on the battlefield is impossible. He argued that the situation has worsened since then, citing military power as decisive in war. Orb\u00e1n also cautioned against Ukraine\u2019s rapid EU accession, claiming it would trigger open conflict with Russia and harm the European economy, stating that EU membership for Ukraine would drag all EU countries, including Hungary, into war. These remarks were part of a series of 'anti-war gatherings' by Fidesz ahead of the April 12 parliamentary elections, which the government and party describe as a pivotal moment for 'war and peace'. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party faces a fierce challenge from the opposition Tisza party, led by former government official and European Parliament member P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, backed by the EU leadership and the European People\u2019s Party.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 04:37 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1753614-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A3%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%B2%D9%85-%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%85/)\n\n**Hungary's Orban denies need for spending cuts after April election**\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban denied on January 31, 2026, that he would need to implement austerity measures if his right-wing Fidesz party wins the April 12, 2026, election, asserting that Hungary's economy does not require any kind of austerity. Despite the country's economy being in near-stagnation for a third consecutive year\u2014underperforming Poland and the Czech Republic\u2014Orban claimed that the budget deficit, which has exceeded forecasts, would be reduced 'calmly, slowly and gradually' as economic conditions improve. He reiterated that flagship policies such as a 3% subsidized mortgage rate and a plan to exempt mothers of two from income tax would remain in place. His government has launched a 100 billion forint ($310 million) scheme to support the restaurant industry and a 50 billion forint ($160 million) measure to reduce household heating costs. Economists, however, argue that whoever wins the election will likely have to tighten fiscal policy after significant pre-election spending, which included raising the 2025 and 2026 budget deficit targets to 5%. Fitch Ratings has already downgraded Hungary\u2019s debt outlook to negative due to these fiscal moves. Orban dismissed the need for cuts, stating, 'We need no austerity and nothing should be taken away from the people.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:54 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-denies-need-for-spending-cuts-after-april-election)\n\n**PM Orban Warns Against Actions of Tisza Provocateurs, Criminal Elements**\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban accused the Tisza political movement of sending criminals and provocateurs to intimidate and harass Fidesz supporters at the Lazarrinfo event in Gyongyos on Thursday, calling the incident 'shocking.' He criticized the so-called 'Tisza country of love,' suggesting it is a facade that masks criminal behavior. Orban urged all Hungarians\u2014regardless of political affiliation or ethnicity, including Roma and non-Roma\u2014to remain vigilant, support one another, and avoid being influenced by Tisza-linked provocateurs and criminal elements.

According to Politico, the two main contenders in the upcoming elections are Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party and the opposition party Tisza, led by P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay.

For the first time in years, Orb\u00e1n faces a strong opponent, with the opposition party led by Tisza gaining momentum. According to a January 14, 2026, survey by the research firm Median published on hvg.hu, Tisza has increased its lead over Fidesz to 12 percentage points, up from 10 points in the November 2025 survey. Despite Fidesz\u2019s efforts to regain voter support following three years of economic stagnation, the party has failed to reestablish its previous popularity. The outcome of the April vote may have far-reaching implications not only for Hungary\u2019s political future but also for nationalist and far-right movements across Europe.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[Rzeczpospolita](https://www.rp.pl/polityka/art43637871-sondaze-na-wegrzech-przed-wiosennymi-wyborami-tisza-umacnia-sie-przed-fideszem)\n\n**President sets April 12 as date for Hungary's parliamentary election**\nHungarian President Tamas Sulyok has officially set the date for the next parliamentary election as April 12, 2026, the earliest possible date under constitutional and electoral law, which requires elections to be called 70\u201390 days in advance and held on a Sunday in April or May, excluding public holidays, Easter, and Pentecost. The decision aligns with prior signals, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s visible display of the date on a T-shirt in July 2023 and public remarks from a government-funded political institute. The official campaign period begins 50 days before election day, but both Fidesz and the opposition Tisza Party launched early mobilization efforts, with Tisza drawing nearly 200,000 to Budapest\u2019s Heroes\u2019 Square\u2014seen as a test of organizational strength. The 2026 election is widely viewed as a high-stakes contest between Fidesz\u2019s long-standing rule and a potential shift led by Peter Magyar and the Tisza Party. Despite Tisza leading in some polls by up to 10 percentage points among decided voters, Fidesz maintains structural advantages through gerrymandered constituency boundaries, a mixed-member voting system with partial vote compensation, and control over public media, advertising access, and campaign regulations. Fidesz reduced Budapest\u2019s constituencies from 18 to 16 in 2022, and further changes are possible before the election. Ethnic Hungarians abroad with Hungarian citizenship can vote by mail, while those with a residence in Hungary must vote at one of 151 foreign consular offices\u2014many requiring long travel. Fidesz frames the election as a choice between stability and uncertainty, promoting its slogan 'the safe choice' and emphasizing national sovereignty, security, and economic protection, while portraying the opposition as inexperienced and foreign-aligned. Government officials highlight social benefits and economic policies. Orban received endorsements from foreign leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, and AfD co-chair Alice Weidel. The Tisza Party has focused on anti-corruption, institutional reform, and restoring EU relations, arguing that a government change is necessary to regain public trust and access withheld EU funds. Unlike past opposition efforts, Tisza seeks broad appeal beyond ideological lines, emphasizing governance and economic renewal. Analysts note that the outcome may depend on turnout, undecided voters, and seat distribution across 106 constituencies. A leaked internet domain registration by Tisza shortly after the Fidesz congress suggests possible early intelligence leaks, raising concerns for Fidesz, as Magyar has previously anticipated party announcements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 10:21 AM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/president-sets-april-12-as-date-for-hungary-s-parliamentary-election-419929/)\n\n**Hungary\u2019s 2026 Elections: Can Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s 15-Year Rule End?**\nHungary is approaching its 2026 parliamentary elections amid escalating tensions with Brussels, energy instability, and intense domestic political competition. The ruling party Fidesz-KDNP, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has held power for 15 years and is seeking re-election, though its position has weakened. According to research by the independent Hungarian Institute for Political Studies (Policy Solutions), public confidence in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has declined, with growing criticism of Hungary\u2019s international standing and EU fund freezes attributed to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration. A majority of Hungarians now view opposition leader P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay of the Tisza party as a more suitable candidate than Orb\u00e1n, with support for M\u00e1rki-Zay rising even among undecided voters. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s campaign focuses on maintaining neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, warning that pro-Bruce-loyal candidates would drag Hungary into war. However, public fear of war has decreased: in 2023, 59% feared Hungary\u2019s involvement; by autumn 2025, this dropped to 46%, and further to 43% by late 2025. Another key issue is opposition to Ukraine\u2019s EU accession, with 64% of Hungarians opposing it and only 31% supporting it by 2025. Orb\u00e1n has leveraged this sentiment, aligning with farmers\u2019 protests against EU subsidies. The Tisza party, a pro-European liberal force, criticizes Orb\u00e1n\u2019s foreign policy, especially ties with Russia, China, and Turkey, and promotes cooperation with the EU and Ursula von der Leyen. Tisza has gained popularity due to its competence narrative and anti-corruption stance, with 58% of respondents believing it is more capable than Fidesz in handling state affairs. The Democratic Coalition (DK), led by Kl\u00e1ra Dobrev, is weaker but may coordinate with Tisza. The far-right 'Our Homeland' (Mi Haz\u00e1nk), led by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3thk\u00e1cs, has grown steadily, gaining nearly 7% in the 2024 European Parliament elections, advocating for Hungarian rights in Transcarpathia and promoting anti-immigrant, anti-Islamic, and anti-Semitic views. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has tightened media control through a state oversight body targeting foreign-funded outlets, drawing criticism from the EU for restricting press freedom. The opposition uses this to discredit Orb\u00e1n. Despite Orb\u00e1n\u2019s strong base of around two million voters, political analysts like Zolt\u00e1n Kiseli suggest this is insufficient for victory. The outcome will shape Hungary\u2019s future: a Fidesz win would maintain resistance to Ukraine\u2019s EU integration and skepticism toward EU-led escalation; a Tisza victory would align Hungary more closely with EU pro-Ukraine policies. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s foreign policy, including close ties with U.S. figures like Donald Trump and JD Vance, suggests a strategic positioning in a shifting global order, though he avoids explicitly defining it.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 09:29 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/article/012bea5a)\n\n**Orb\u00e1n: 'I am ready.' 'This is not the time for experimenters'**\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, during the 31st congress of his party Fidesz, stated he remains ready to serve as prime minister after 20 years in office and emphasized that he is still considered relatively young among international leaders. He argued that only reliable and experienced governments can ensure peaceful, safe, and predictable lives, declaring 'this is not the time for experimenters.' The congress in Budapest presented a list of 106 candidates\u201465 from previous lists and 41 new ones\u2014for single-member constituencies in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Hungary\u2019s mixed electoral system includes 106 directly elected deputies and 93 additional members chosen from national party lists. Orb\u00e1n announced that the Fidesz-KDNP coalition list will be unveiled on February 20. He framed the upcoming elections as a choice between 'war and peace,' accusing opposition parties of bringing a 'Brussels-style wartime economy' to Hungary. On migration, Orb\u00e1n claimed the country faces a critical choice: either submit to Brussels and become a migrant destination or continue resisting EU pressures. He advocated for 'continuing the rebellion' and warned that migration brings violence and aggressive antisemitism. He noted that Jewish families from Western Europe are increasingly relocating to Hungary for safety, and asserted that Fidesz-KDNP is the only political force capable of guaranteeing Jewish safety in Budapest. Orb\u00e1n also declared that the liberal international order is collapsing and a new era of nations is emerging, naming Washington, Beijing, Moscow, and Istanbul as cities aligned with Hungary. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for April 2026; while independent polls have consistently shown opposition party TISZA leading, recent surveys indicate a narrowing gap between TISZA and Fidesz.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 05:38 AM\nSource:[TVN24](https://tvn24.pl/swiat/wegry-viktor-orban-oglosil-ze-jest-gotowy-aby-dalej-byc-premierem-st8840371)\n\n**Bad News for Orb\u00e1n: New Polls Show TISZA Leading Over Fidesz**\nA recent poll conducted by IDEA shows that TISZA, led by opposition figure Peter Magyar, would win the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary elections if they were held last Sunday, with 35% of national support compared to Fidesz's 28%. Among declared voters, TISZA leads with 47%, significantly ahead of Fidesz's 39%. The Democratic Coalition, another opposition party, receives only 5% of declared voters' support, a result near the margin of statistical error, indicating its precarious position. Additionally, 26% of respondents remain undecided, possibly due to years of state-controlled media and propaganda under Viktor Orb\u00e1n's leadership.

The ruling party Fidesz, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, held a rally at Lajos Kossuth Square with 80,000 attendees, while the opposition party Tisza, led by P\u00e9ter M\u00e1d\u00e1ry, gathered 45,000 at Heroes' Square. According to official figures and media coverage, Orb\u00e1n's event drew more participants and was watched live by 28% of adult Hungarians, compared to 17% for M\u00e1d\u00e1ry\u2019s speech. State broadcaster M1 did not broadcast M\u00e1d\u00e1ry\u2019s address in full. Aerial photos showed Fidesz\u2019s rally was packed, while Tisza\u2019s event had noticeable gaps in the crowd. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s tone was described as conciliatory, aiming to attract undecided voters, while M\u00e1d\u00e1ry\u2019s speech was confrontational, accusing the government of corruption and pro-Russian policies, and calling for 'Russians, go home!'. The opposition is accused by Fidesz of being 'Brussels puppets' and of pursuing populist policies without a concrete economic plan. Fidesz emphasizes its achievements, including price controls, a 30% increase in minimum wage (to \u20ac910), tax exemptions for mothers with two or three children, and housing subsidies. Tisza, a newly revived party formed from the 'Respect and Freedom' movement, gained prominence after M\u00e1d\u00e1ry\u2019s rise in February 2024 following a political scandal. It won 29.69% of votes in the June 2024 European Parliament elections, securing seven seats. Despite early polling showing Tisza surpassing Fidesz, a Real-PR survey in October 2025 found 47% support for Fidesz versus 39% for Tisza. Fidesz has intensified its digital outreach and youth mobilization ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections, expected in April 2026. The government warns that a Tisza victory would lead to higher taxes, cuts in social benefits, and increased EU alignment, while Tisza maintains its stance on peaceful conflict resolution and national sovereignty. The political battle is intensifying, with both sides accusing external forces\u2014especially the EU\u2014of interference.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:31 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/opinions/25464829)\n\n**Scenario of a Two\u2011Party Battle \u2013 Budapester Zeitung**\nThe article reports on recent polling data for Hungary\u2019s upcoming parliamentary elections.

The right\u2011wing Mi Haz\u00e1nk is projected at 4%, failing to cross the threshold.
