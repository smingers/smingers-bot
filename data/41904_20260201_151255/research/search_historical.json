The article presents statistical analysis that favors one interpretation of polling data.\n\n## Key Claims and Analysis:\n\n**Main Argument:**\nThe article argues that opposition-aligned polls showing Tisza Party leading may be \"wildly inaccurate\" or potentially fraudulent, while government-aligned polls (showing Fidesz leading by ~7 points) are more reliable.\n\n**Polling Landscape:**\n- **Opposition-aligned polls:** Show Tisza with roughly a 10-point lead over Fidesz\n- **Government-aligned polls:** Show Fidesz with roughly a 7-point lead over Tisza\n- This creates approximately a 17-point difference between the two sets of polls\n- The Wikipedia article on election polling has acknowledged this discrepancy and separated pollsters by affiliation\n\n**Statistical Analysis Presented:**\nThe author conducted econometric analysis using a \"Hodrick-Prescott filter\" to examine polling consistency:\n\n- **Opposition-aligned polls for Tisza:** Show very high \"cyclical component\" (fluctuating between +7 and -6), indicating large discrepancies between individual polls\n- **Opposition-aligned polls for Fidesz:** Show more muted cyclical components\n- **Government-aligned polls:** Show more consistent, \"normal\" cyclical components for both parties\n\nThe author interprets high cyclical components as suspicious, suggesting opposition-aligned pollsters may publish favorable Tisza results during difficult political weeks.\n\n**Supporting Evidence Cited:**\n1. One opposition-aligned poll (21 Kutat\u00f3k\u00f6zpont, mid-December) showed Tisza with a 17-point lead, which the author calls \"extreme and unbelievable\" and potentially \"not even mathematically possible\" given the electoral map\n2. Reference to \"fraudulent polling used in other countries\u2014like Georgia\"\n3. \"Polling inflation\" - opposition-aligned polls are \"much more numerous,\" potentially skewing overall averages\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Election date: April 12, 2026\n- The author characterizes Tisza's recent messaging as having \"strayed from initial optimism into aggressive paranoia\"\n- Cites P\u00e9ter Magyar's New Year's speech claiming the government would conduct drone sabotage acts to prevent him from becoming Prime Minister\n- Notes that Tisza's \"initial surge\" momentum appears to have \"run out\"\n\n**Author's Assessment:** The article concludes these statistical tests \"seriously call into question the reliability of the opposition-aligned polling.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.foederalist.eu/2026/01/ep-seat-projection-january-2026.html\">\n# Summary of Article: European Parliament Seat Projection (January 2026)\n\n**Source:** Foederalist.eu, February 01, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Question:\n\n### Hungary-Specific Information:\n\n1. **Tisza Party (EPP member):**\n   - Has recorded **slight losses** compared to the November projection\n   - These losses contributed to the EPP's overall performance in Hungary\n\n2. **Fidesz (Pf E group member):**\n   - Has made **gains** in the projection\n   - However, the article notes these gains are \"**at least partly attributable to the bias of pro-government Hungarian polling institutes**\"\n\n3. **Hungarian Social Democrats (S&D):**\n   - Would **not win any seats** in the European Parliament according to current polls\n   - This applies to polls conducted by both pro-government and opposition-aligned opinion research institutes\n\n### Broader Context:\n\n- The article discusses European Parliament seat projections, showing a slight decline in far-right groups for the second consecutive projection period\n- EPP (Tisza's group): 177 seats (+2 vs November)\n- Pf E (Fidesz's group): 104 seats (-1 vs November)\n- The changes are described as \"very small\" and may represent statistical fluctuations rather than definitive trends\n\n**Important Caveat:** This article focuses on European Parliament projections, not Hungary's 2026 parliamentary election. The relevance is limited to showing recent polling trends for Tisza and Fidesz in a different electoral context.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

important election of 2026\"\n\n**Source:** POLITICO  \n**Date:** January 15, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Election Date:** Sunday, April 12, 2026\n- **Parliament Size:** 199-seat National Assembly\n- **Electoral System:** Mixed system with 106 MPs elected in single-member constituencies and 93 from national party lists\n- **Hungary's Population:** 9.6 million\n- **Media Control:** Government controls roughly 80 percent of the media market\n- **Rule of Law Ranking:** Hungary sits at the bottom of the World Justice Project's rule-of-law index for EU countries\n\n## Polling Data:\n\n- **POLITICO's Poll of Polls:** Tisza leading with 49% support, Fidesz at 37%\n- **Trend:** Orb\u00e1n's party has been trailing for almost a year\n- **Article characterization:** Tisza is \"running 12 points ahead in the polls\"\n\n## Key Political Context:\n\n**Viktor Orb\u00e1n (Fidesz):**\n- 62 years old\n- Has held power for 15 years\n- Described as the EU leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin\n- Has tightened government grip on media and state companies, weakened judicial independence\n- In 2011, Orb\u00e1n's government redrew electoral districts and overhauled the voting system to maximize Fidesz's chances\n\n**P\u00e9ter Magyar (Tisza Party):**\n- Conservative leader, former ally of Orb\u00e1n\n- His surname literally means \"Hungarian\"\n- Accuses Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz of nepotism, corruption, and weakening the economy by favoring oligarchs\n- His base spans green and left-wing voters to disenchanted former Orb\u00e1n loyalists\n\n## Campaign Strategies and Positions:\n\n**Tisza's Strategy:**\n- Avoiding positioning itself on controversial issues to garner an absolute majority\n- Goal: Reform electoral law (which they say Orb\u00e1n rigged) and enable constitutional changes\n- According to Zolt\u00e1n Tarr (Tisza's No. 2): Plans to \"keep border fence, oppose mandatory migration quotas and accelerated Ukraine accession, pursue peace, fight Russian propaganda, strengthen V4\"\n- Magyar has been noncommittal about Brussels, stating in October 2024: \"we certainly don't believe in a European superstate\"\n\n**Fidesz's Strategy:**\n- Frame Magyar as a puppet controlled by Brussels\n- Orb\u00e1n at party congress: \"Tisza's boss is Herr Weber, Europe's biggest warmonger\" (referring to EPP chief Manfred Weber)\n- Launched public debates to divide Magyar's base on subjects like LGBTQ+ Pride ban\n\n## Expert Analysis:\n\n**M\u00e1rton Bene (TK Institute of Political Science):**\n- \"There is no direct interference with the act of voting itself, yet the broader competitive environment \u2014 both in terms of institutional rules and access to resources \u2014 tilts heavily in favor of the governing parties\"\n- Even unfair conditions don't preclude a Magyar victory \"as long as the integrity of the voting process is preserved\"\n\n**Rudolf Metz (TK Institute):**\n- \"One side enjoys access to the full resources of the state, while the challenger receives no public campaign funding and has virtually no presence in state-controlled media\"\n- A Magyar victory \"would not mean a radical U-turn or a return to some idealized past\"\n- \"Hungary's role as the EU's permanent disruptor would probably fade, not because national interests disappear, but because th[e]\"

Hungarian addresses must travel to embassies to cast ballots\n- Official campaign period begins Feb. 21, though race has been in full swing for months\n\n## Other Parties:\n\n- Democratic Coalition (DK)\n- Far-right Mi Haz\u00e1nk (Our Homeland) movement\n- Satirical Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party (MKKP)\n- These parties are fighting for survival as they may not meet the threshold for winning seats\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the final analysis from Rudolf Metz is incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

To understand the race, four elements are required: (1) the recent electoral record, (2) the emergence of the new Tisza Party, (3) where the polls stand as of 1 February 2026, and (4) how Hungary\u2019s mixed electoral system converts votes into seats \u2013 and what that means for any newcomer that hopes to unseat the long-ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition.\n\n1.  Parliamentary election results, 2010-2022  \n(The size of the National Assembly was cut from 386 seats to 199 after 2011; percentages below are list-vote shares.)\n\n\u2022 2010 \u2013 Fidesz-KDNP 52.7 % / 263 of 386 seats; Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) 19.3 % / 59; radical-right Jobbik 16.7 % / 47; green LMP 7.5 % / 16.  Fidesz secured the two-thirds super-majority that allows constitutional amendments (PolitPro historical dataset).  \n\u2022 2014 \u2013 Fidesz-KDNP 44.9 % / 133 of 199; centre-left Unity alliance 26.0 % / 38; Jobbik 20.2 % / 23; LMP 5.3 % / 5 (PolitPro).  \n\u2022 2018 \u2013 Fidesz-KDNP 49.3 % / 133 of 199; Jobbik 19.1 % / 26; Socialist\u2013Dialogue list 12.0 % / 20; Democratic Coalition (DK) 5.4 % / 9; LMP 7; newcomers Momentum and Mi Haz\u00e1nk fell short (PolitPro; OSCE final report).  \n\u2022 2022 \u2013 Fidesz-KDNP 53.0 % / 135 of 199; six-party opposition alliance \u201cUnited for Hungary\u201d 35.0 % / 56; far-right Mi Haz\u00e1nk 6.2 % / 7 (Robert-Schuman Centre report, 4 Apr 2022).\n\nAcross all four elections Fidesz never fell below 44 % of the list vote and never below 133 seats, twice regaining the constitutional two-thirds.\n\n2.  Timeline of the Tisza Party  \n\u2022 Nov 2023 \u2013 former Fidesz insider P\u00e9ter Magyar breaks publicly with the government after the corruption case surrounding then-justice minister Judit Varga (his former wife).  \n\u2022 Early 2024 \u2013 Magyar launches a civic movement branded \u201cTISZA\u201d (an acronym of the Hungarian for \u201cRespect and Freedom\u201d) and campaigns in the June 2024 European Parliament election, where the movement, still without formal party registration, wins 29 % and five MEPs, finishing ahead of every traditional opposition list (EUobserver, 16 Apr 2025).  \n\u2022 20 December 2024 \u2013 founders file to register Tisza as a political party.  \n\u2022 28 February 2025 \u2013 the Budapest Court officially registers Tisza P\u00e1rt; nationwide organisation begins.  \n\u2022 May\u2013September 2025 \u2013 Tisza builds an extensive online supporter network (\u201cTisza-islands\u201d) and overtakes Fidesz in several polls (EA WorldView, 10 Sep 2025; DW interview with Magyar, 2025).  \nIn short, while the civic brand dates from early 2024, the legal party exists only since February 2025.\n\n3.  Polling picture to 1 February 2026  \nBecause Hungary lacks a single, agreed, non-partisan poll-aggregator, the best approach is to bracket the range:\n\n\u2022 Opposition-leaning averages (POLITICO \u201cPoll of Polls\u201d, updated mid-Jan 2026) put Tisza on 49 %, Fidesz-KDNP on 37 %, Mi Haz\u00e1nk on 6 %, others below 5 %.  \n\u2022 Government-aligned Center for Fundamental Rights (fielded 5-8 Jan 2026) finds the reverse: Fidesz-KDNP 49 %, Tisza 41 %, Mi Haz\u00e1nk 6 % (Hungarian Conservative, 15 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Independent institutes (Medi\u00e1n, Republikon, Z\u00e1vecz, aggregated informally by Hungarian press) in December 2025\u2013January 2026 tend to place the two blocs within the margin of error of each other, generally 44-46 % each, with Mi Haz\u00e1nk 5-7 %.  \n\nTaking the midpoint of the publicly available series to 1 Feb 2026 gives an indicative \u201cpoll-of-polls\u201d:  \nTisza \u2248 45 %, Fidesz-KDNP \u2248 44 %, Mi Haz\u00e1nk \u2248 6 %, all others below the 5 % list threshold.  Importantly, Tisza polls particularly strongly in Budapest and larger cities, whereas Fidesz retains a lead in many rural single-member districts.\n\n4.  How the mixed electoral system allocates seats  \n(as explained by the UK Electoral Reform Society article of 1 Apr 2022 and Volt Magyarorsz\u00e1g primer):\n\n\u2022 Total seats: 199.  \n\u2022 Single-member constituencies (SMCs): 106, elected by first-past-the-post in one round.  \n\u2022 National list seats: 93, distributed proportionally (d\u2019Hondt) using (a) each party\u2019s separate list vote plus (b) \u201cfragment votes\u201d \u2013 votes cast for losing SMC candidates and excess votes above the winner\u2019s total.  \n\u2022 Thresholds: 5 % for single parties, 10 % for a two-party list, 15 % for lists of three or more. Recognised ethnic-minority lists can win one spokes-seat on about 0.27 %.  \n\u2022 Biases: because list seats are not fully compensatory and SMC boundaries were redrawn by Fidesz in 2011, the system structurally favours the largest party.  In 2018 Fidesz turned 49 % of votes into 67 % of seats; in 2022, 53 % of votes yielded 68 % of seats (ERS; Robert-Schuman Centre).  Model exercises by Hungarian pollsters show that an opposition force probably needs a national vote lead of 4-5 percentage points to win a simple majority of seats, and an 8-9-point lead for the two-thirds super-majority.\n\n5.  Likelihood that a new party can surpass Fidesz-KDNP in 2026  \nAdvantages for Tisza:  \n\u2022 Polling momentum: all series agree that Magyar\u2019s movement rose from zero in 2024 to the mid-40s by late 2025, something no previous opposition force managed (EUobserver; POLITICO).  \n\u2022 Ideological breadth: Tisza positions itself as a conservative, anti-corruption alternative that can pick off moderate Fidesz voters while also attracting liberal and green supporters (DW, 2025).  \n\u2022 Digital reach and volunteer infrastructure that outperforms Fidesz online (EA WorldView, 10 Sep 2025).\n\nBarriers:  \n\u2022 Structural tilt of the electoral system \u2013 needing a clear several-point popular-vote margin to translate into a seat lead.  \n\u2022 Resource asymmetry \u2013 Fidesz controls roughly 80 % of the domestic media market and enjoys the advantages of incumbency (EUobserver, 16 Apr 2025).  \n\u2022 Geography \u2013 Fidesz still leads in many small-town and rural SMCs where 106 \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d seats are decided.  \n\u2022 Poll uncertainty \u2013 wide divergence between government- and opposition-aligned survey houses, and the Center for Fundamental Rights poll in January 2026 still shows Fidesz ahead among committed voters.  \n\nAssessment:  \nIf the mid-range poll figure (Tisza ~45 %, Fidesz ~44 %) holds through April, the seat projection is a knife-edge: Fidesz could retain a plurality thanks to its SMC advantage, though its two-thirds majority would be lost.  For Tisza actually to \u201csurpass\u201d Fidesz in seats it probably needs to widen its national lead to at least 3-4 points and win most urban and suburban constituencies \u2013 a plausible but by no means assured scenario.  Achieving a governing majority without coalition partners therefore requires (a) continued mobilisation, (b) discipline in candidate selection to avoid vote-splitting in SMCs, and (c) neutral or favourable election-day administration.  A two-thirds super-majority for either side looks highly unlikely under present polling.\n\nInformation gaps  \n\u2022 Exact day-by-day poll averages from all major institutes for January 2026 (only partial figures appear in open sources).  \n\u2022 Official election-commission data on Tisza\u2019s membership and national-list signature collection, which will not be published until late February 2026.  \nThese gaps are not essential for the broad assessment but would sharpen seat-projection models.</Agent_report>\n"
