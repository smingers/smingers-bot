Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**STAT (October 30, 2025):**
High-quality financial journalism source. Reports Q3 2025 tirzepatide sales of $10.1B (combined Mounjaro/Zepbound) and YTD through Q3 of $24.8B. Includes analyst predictions for full-year 2025 of $32.2B. Factual data from earnings reports with minimal opinion content.

**BioPharma Dive (October 30, 2025):**
Industry trade publication with strong credibility. Confirms Q3 2025 tirzepatide revenue of $10.1B, up from $4.37B in Q3 2024. Notes raised full-year 2025 guidance to $63-63.5B total company revenue. Contains expert opinion that GLP-1 market will exceed $100B in next decade, though this is speculative.

**Eli Lilly Press Release (Q3 2025):**
Primary source - official company filing. Reports U.S. Zepbound revenue of $3.57B in Q3 2025 (184% YoY growth). Notably, only provides U.S. figures for Zepbound, not global. Mounjaro worldwide was $6.52B. This is factual data with no opinion.

**CNBC (February 6, 2025):**
Reputable financial news covering Q4 2024 results. Reports Zepbound Q4 2024 revenue of $1.91B (slightly below $1.98B analyst expectations). CFO Lucas Montarce's quote about expecting continuation of prescription growth is an informed opinion from a key executive. 2025 guidance of $58-61B in sales is factual.

**BioSpectrum Asia (Q4 2024):**
Reports Zepbound Q4 2024 sales of $1.2B, which contradicts CNBC's $1.91B figure. This discrepancy suggests lower source quality or possible reporting of U.S.-only vs. global figures. Exercise caution with this source.

**The Globe and Mail (January 23, 2026):**
Recent article but focuses on oncology portfolio, not Zepbound specifically. Notes Q4 2025 earnings scheduled for February 4, 2026. Limited direct relevance to the forecasting question.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive compilation of quarterly revenues through Q3 2025. Shows Zepbound progression: Q4-23 ($0.175B), Q1-24 ($0.517B), Q2-24 ($1.24B), Q3-24 ($1.257B), Q4-24 (~$1.94B derived), Q2-25 ($3.38B), Q3-25 ($3.588B). Also documents extensive manufacturing capacity expansion timeline with first meaningful incremental supply expected late-2025/2027. This is well-sourced compilation but Q1-25 data is notably absent.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Sequential quarterly growth of Zepbound (Q4-23 to Q3-25):**
   - Most directly relevant
   - Shows actual product trajectory
   - Accounts for seasonality, market penetration, supply constraints
   - Limitation: Only ~7 quarters of data, product still in rapid growth phase

2. **Other blockbuster GLP-1 drugs' growth trajectories:**
   - Novo Nordisk's Wegovy could provide comparison
   - Limitation: Different competitive dynamics, market timing

3. **Eli Lilly's historical new blockbuster drug launches:**
   - Broader company pattern
   - Limitation: GLP-1 market is unprecedented in growth rate

**Selected Reference Class:** Sequential quarterly growth of Zepbound is most suitable given direct relevance and availability of granular data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 results (Jan-Mar 2026), to be reported ~April/May 2026. We are currently on February 1, 2026, so Q1 2026 is just beginning.

**Historical Quarterly Pattern (Zepbound only):**
- Q4-23: $0.175B (launch quarter)
- Q1-24: $0.517B (+195% QoQ)
- Q2-24: $1.24B (+140% QoQ)
- Q3-24: $1.257B (+1.4% QoQ - minimal growth)
- Q4-24: ~$1.94B (+54% QoQ - derived)
- Q1-25: Unknown
- Q2-25: $3.38B
- Q3-25: $3.588B (+6.2% QoQ)

**Key Observations:**
1. Growth rate has decelerated from triple-digit to single-digit QoQ
2. Q3-24 showed near-stagnation, possibly due to supply constraints
3. Significant acceleration in Q4-24 and into 2025
4. Q2-25 to Q3-25 showed modest 6.2% growth
5. Seasonality: Q1 typically shows strong demand (New Year's resolutions for weight loss)

**Missing Q1-25 Data:** This is a critical gap. If we assume Q1-25 followed similar pattern to Q4-24→Q1-24 growth (~195% is too high given maturation), a more conservative estimate might be Q1-25 ≈ $2.5-2.8B.

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Growth Trajectory Analysis:**
From Q3-25 ($3.588B) to Q1-26, we need to project ~6 months forward. Key factors:

1. **Supply Expansion:** Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin facility expected to deliver first lots in 1H-2026, which could positively impact Q1-26 or more likely Q2-26.

2. **Seasonal Factors:** Q1 historically shows strong weight-loss drug demand. However, the Q3-24 to Q4-24 pattern and Q2-25 to Q3-25 pattern suggest growth is moderating.

3. **Market Saturation Signals:** The deceleration from triple-digit to single-digit QoQ growth suggests market is maturing. However, the absolute market size is still expanding (GLP-1 market expected >$100B long-term).

4. **Competitive Dynamics:** Zepbound became market leader in new prescriptions in Q4-24, suggesting continued market share gains.

5. **Price Pressure:** Multiple sources note "lower realized prices" due to rebates/discounts, which could dampen revenue growth even as volume increases.

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- Q3-25: $3.588B
- Assuming modest QoQ growth of 8-12% for Q4-25 → Q4-25 estimate: $3.88-4.02B
- Q4-25 to Q1-26 could see 5-15% growth given seasonality and new capacity

**Expected Range for Q1-26:**
- Conservative: $3.9-4.1B (minimal growth from Q4-25)
- Moderate: $4.2-4.5B (10-15% growth)
- Optimistic: $4.6-5.0B (new capacity + strong seasonal demand)

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Tethering to Established Patterns:** The quarterly progression shows clear deceleration but continued growth. The 90/10 range should capture both the possibility of continued deceleration and potential upside from new manufacturing capacity.

2. **Uncertainty Factors:**
   - Missing Q1-25 and Q4-25 actual data creates significant uncertainty
   - New manufacturing capacity timing is uncertain (could be late Q1 or Q2)
   - Competitive pressure from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy
   - Potential regulatory or reimbursement changes
   - Macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending on weight-loss drugs

3. **Historical Upset Rate:** Pharmaceutical revenue forecasts have historically been volatile. Zepbound has both exceeded and fallen short of analyst expectations in different quarters. This suggests a moderately wide distribution is appropriate.

4. **Asymmetric Risk:**
   - Downside: Supply disruptions, faster-than-expected price erosion, competitive pressure
   - Upside: New capacity comes online early, stronger seasonal demand, international expansion

**Calibration Logic:**

Given Q3-25 base of $3.588B:
- **10th percentile:** Should account for scenario where growth stalls or reverses due to unexpected issues. Set at $3.6B (minimal growth from Q3-25).
- **20th percentile:** Modest growth scenario with some headwinds. Set at $3.9B.
- **40th percentile:** Below-median outcome with ~10% growth over two quarters. Set at $4.1B.
- **60th percentile:** Above-median with ~15% growth, capturing expected trajectory. Set at $4.4B.
- **80th percentile:** Strong performance with new capacity and seasonal boost. Set at $4.8B.
- **90th percentile:** Optimistic scenario with all factors aligning positively. Set at $5.2B.

This distribution reflects:
- Central tendency around $4.2-4.5B (15-25% growth from Q3-25)
- Wide tails to capture uncertainty from missing data
- Slight positive skew reflecting growth momentum and new capacity
