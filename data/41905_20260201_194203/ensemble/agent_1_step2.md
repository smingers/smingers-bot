**Quality Assessment:**
- Highest quality: CNBC, Fierce Pharma, AP (primary earnings data)
- Moderate: Morningstar, Yahoo Finance (analyst compilations)
- Lower: Motley Fool, Benzinga (opinion-heavy, promotional)
- Uncertain: Chosunbiz (potential typo on magnitude)

**Factual vs. Opinion:**
- **Factual:** Q3 2025 Zepbound $3.59-3.6B; Q4 2024 $1.91B; combined tirzepatide Q3 2025 $10.1B; CVS formulary exclusion July 2025; shortage ended Dec 2024; Pennsylvania plant $3.5B investment
- **Expert Opinion:** Ricks on "global demand" and Medicare "game-changer"; CFO on prescription growth continuation; analyst projections of $100B market
- **Speculation:** Orforglipron approval timing; Q1 2026 revenue estimates; market share projections

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large Shifts):**
1. **Sequential Growth Deceleration:** Q2-25 to Q3-25 only 6% QoQ growth vs. Q4-24 to Q2-25 much higher rates. Multiple sources confirm this trend. Suggests market maturation or supply constraints. **Direction: Downward pressure on aggressive growth assumptions.**

2. **Manufacturing Capacity Timeline:** Pennsylvania plant not operational until 2031. Pleasant Prairie facility "first lots" expected H1-2026 per agent report, but uncertain if impacting Q1-26. Multiple sources confirm capacity expansions are multi-year projects. **Direction: Limits upside for Q1-26 specifically.**

3. **Price Realization Pressure:** CNBC Oct 2025 explicitly notes "lower realized prices" offsetting volume growth. This is structural pressure from PBM negotiations. **Direction: Dampens revenue growth even with volume increases.**

**Moderate Evidence (Moderate Shifts):**
1. **CVS Formulary Exclusion (July 2025):** Fierce Pharma notes "limited impact" on Q3-25 results, but this is only one quarter of data post-exclusion. CVS is largest PBM. **Direction: Modest downward pressure, but already reflected in Q3-25 baseline.**

2. **Seasonal Demand (Q1):** Weight-loss drugs typically see Q1 demand surge (New Year's resolutions). However, this is partially speculative for Zepbound specifically. **Direction: Modest upward pressure for Q1-26.**

3. **Novo Nordisk Oral Wegovy Launch (Jan 2026):** AskNews reports "strong" early prescription data. Morningstar notes this as competitive threat. However, launch is very recent (mid-Jan 2026), so Q1-26 impact limited. **Direction: Minimal for Q1-26, larger for later quarters.**

4. **Medicare Coverage Expansion:** CEO Ricks calls this "game-changing" but tied to oral orforglipron launch in Q2 2026, not Q1-26. **Direction: Minimal for Q1-26.**

**Weak Evidence (Small Adjustments):**
1. **Analyst Sentiment:** Multiple Motley Fool articles bullish on 2026. This is opinion without specific Q1-26 forecasts. **Direction: Slight upward bias in market expectations.**

2. **Competitive Positioning:** Zepbound became market leader in new prescriptions Q4-24. Anecdotal evidence of sustained demand. **Direction: Slight upward pressure.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), reported late April/early May 2026. We are currently Feb 1, 2026, so 89 days until quarter end, ~120 days until resolution.

**Current Data Gaps:**
- Q4 2025 actual results (reporting Feb 4, 2026 - 3 days away)
- Q1 2025 actual results (never publicly reported separately in sources)

**Quarterly Progression (Zepbound only):**
- Q4-23: $0.175B
- Q1-24: $0.517B (+195% QoQ)
- Q2-24: $1.24B (+140% QoQ)
- Q3-24: $1.257B (+1.4% QoQ)
- Q4-24: $1.91B (+52% QoQ)
- Q1-25: Unknown
- Q2-25: $3.38B
- Q3-25: $3.588B (+6.2% QoQ)
- Q4-25: Unknown (reporting Feb 4)
- Q1-26: Target

**If Timeframe Halved (Q1-26 to mid-Feb 2026):**
Only 45 days of sales data. Would dramatically reduce revenue proportionally - perhaps $2-2.5B. Manufacturing capacity changes would be even less relevant. Seasonal effects would be incomplete.

**If Timeframe Doubled (6-month period through June 2026):**
Would include Q2-26, capturing orforglipron launch impact and full Medicare coverage effects. Estimate would increase to $8-10B range. New manufacturing capacity more likely to contribute.

**Implication:** The 90-day Q1-26 window is critical. Q4-25 results (3 days away) will significantly inform the forecast, but we must predict without them. The short timeframe means structural factors (new plants, oral formulation) have limited impact, while near-term dynamics (pricing, competition, seasonality) dominate.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Base Rate Anchor (Outside View):**
From earlier analysis: Q3-25 baseline of $3.588B with expected Q1-26 range of $3.9-5.2B (10th-90th percentile), centered around $4.2-4.5B.

**Key Factors Shifting Prediction:**

1. **Growth Deceleration Signal (Strong Evidence, Downward):**
The 6.2% Q2-25→Q3-25 growth is dramatically slower than earlier quarters. If Q4-25→Q1-26 follows similar pattern, we'd expect $3.8-4.0B. However, Q1 seasonality could offset this.

2. **Missing Q4-25 and Q1-25 Data (Increases Uncertainty):**
Without these critical data points, uncertainty is higher. Q4-25 could range from $3.8-4.2B based on analyst estimates ($3.62B) and growth patterns. This creates a wider confidence interval.

3. **Price Pressure Structural Factor (Moderate Evidence, Downward):**
"Lower realized prices" is explicitly mentioned for Q3-25. This is unlikely to reverse in Q1-26. Even with volume growth, revenue growth dampened.

4. **Limited New Capacity for Q1-26 (Strong Evidence, Caps Upside):**
Pennsylvania plant irrelevant. Pleasant Prairie "first lots" in H1-2026 likely means late Q1 at earliest, more likely Q2. Supply constraints may persist through Q1-26.

5. **Competitive Dynamics (Moderate Evidence, Mixed):**
Oral Wegovy launch is very recent (mid-Jan 2026). Impact on Q1-26 minimal but exists. However, Zepbound's "superior profile" and market leadership position provide some buffer.

6. **Seasonal Boost (Moderate Evidence, Upward):**
Q1 is strongest quarter for weight-loss drugs. Could add 5-10% to baseline expectations.

**Synthesis:**
The outside view suggested $4.2-4.5B central estimate. However:
- Growth deceleration is more pronounced than initially weighted
- Price pressure is structural, not transient
- New capacity unlikely to materially impact Q1-26
- Seasonal boost partially offsets but doesn't reverse these factors

**Revised Central Estimate:** $4.0-4.3B (slightly lower than outside view due to deceleration evidence)

**Distribution Shape:**
- Lower tail risk: Supply disruption, faster price erosion, competitive shock → $3.2-3.6B
- Upper tail opportunity: Stronger seasonal demand, Q4-25 momentum, early capacity → $4.8-5.5B
- Asymmetry: Slightly positive skew due to potential upside surprises, but constrained by capacity

**Calibration to Missing Data:**
The Feb 4, 2026 Q4-25 earnings will be critical. If Q4-25 comes in at:
- Low ($3.7B): Suggests continued deceleration, Q1-26 likely $3.8-4.1B
- Mid ($3.9-4.0B): Supports current estimate of $4.0-4.3B
- High ($4.2B+): Would shift Q1-26 estimate to $4.3-4.6B

Given we must forecast without Q4-25 data, maintaining wider confidence intervals is prudent.

## Probability Calibration

**Anchoring to Q3-25 Baseline ($3.588B):**

**10% Scenario (Downside):**
- Q4-25 shows continued deceleration (~$3.7B)
- Q1-26 flat or minimal growth due to price pressure
- Competitive impact from oral Wegovy begins
- Supply constraints persist
- **Estimate: $3.5B** (slight decline from Q3-25)

**1% Scenario (Extreme Downside):**
- Major supply disruption or safety issue
- Dramatic market share loss to competition
- Regulatory setback
- **Estimate: $2.8B** (20% decline from Q3-25)

**50% Scenario (Median):**
- Q4-25 ~$3.9B (8% growth from Q3-25)
- Q1-26 shows 5-8% growth from Q4-25
- Seasonal boost partially offsets price pressure
- Market share stable
- **Estimate: $4.1B** (14% growth from Q3-25 over 2 quarters)

**90% Scenario (Upside):**
- Q4-25 strong at $4.1-4.2B
- Q1-26 benefits from full seasonal demand
- Early manufacturing capacity contributions
- Minimal competitive impact
- **Estimate: $4.9B** (37% growth from Q3-25 over 2 quarters)

**99% Scenario (Extreme Upside):**
- Unexpected capacity breakthrough
- Major market expansion event
- Competitor stumble
- **Estimate: $5.8B** (62% growth from Q3-25)

**Percentile Assignments:**
- 1%: $2.8B (extreme negative scenario)
- 5%: $3.3B (significant deceleration)
- 10%: $3.5B (minimal growth, multiple headwinds)
- 20%: $3.8B (below-trend growth)
- 40%: $4.0B (modest growth with price pressure)
- 60%: $4.2B (baseline growth with seasonal boost)
- 80%: $4.6B (strong seasonal demand, stable pricing)
- 90%: $4.9B (optimistic capacity and demand)
- 95%: $5.3B (very strong performance)
- 99%: $5.8B (breakthrough scenario)

**Consistency Check:**
- Implied median: ~$4.1B
- Implied mean: ~$4.15B (slight positive skew)
- Range: $2.8-5.8B (3.0B spread, ~73% range around median)

This distribution reflects:
1. Central tendency around 10-15% growth from Q3-25 baseline
2. Downside risk from deceleration and price pressure
3. Upside potential from seasonality and possible capacity
4. Wide tails to account for missing Q4-25 data and market volatility
5. Slight positive skew recognizing growth momentum despite headwinds

## Checklist:

1. **Target Variable:** Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar) global Zepbound revenue in USD, as reported in LLY earnings.

2. **Outside View Base Rate:** Q3-25 baseline $3.588B; historical QoQ growth 1.4%-52%; recent trend 6%; expected Q1-26 range $3.9-5.2B centered $4.2-4.5B.

3. **Consistency Check:** Implied median = $4.1B; mean = $4.15B. Reasonable given Q3-25 base $3.588B and 14% growth over 2 quarters accounting for deceleration and seasonal offset.
