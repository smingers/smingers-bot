Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**STAT (Oct 30, 2025):** High-quality pharmaceutical industry publication. Reports Q3 2025 tirzepatide (combined Mounjaro + Zepbound) sales of $10.1B, with YTD through Q3 at $24.8B. Projects full-year 2025 at $32.2B based on Visible Alpha analyst consensus. **Factual data with clear attribution to analyst forecasts.**

**BioPharma Dive (Oct 30, 2025):** Reputable industry news source. Confirms Q3 2025 combined tirzepatide revenue of $10.1B (up from $4.37B in Q3 2024). Notes 184% YoY growth for Zepbound specifically. Mentions GLP-1 market expected to exceed $100B in next decade (analyst opinion). **Solid factual reporting with clearly labeled market projections.**

**Eli Lilly Press Release (Oct 30, 2025):** Primary source - official company earnings. Reports Q3 2025 U.S. Zepbound revenue of $3.57B (184% increase YoY from $1.26B). Notably, only provides U.S. figures for Zepbound, not global. Mounjaro worldwide revenue: $6.52B. **Most reliable factual source but incomplete for global Zepbound.**

**CNBC (Feb 6, 2025):** Reliable financial news. Reports Q4 2024 Zepbound revenue of $1.91B (missed expectations of $1.98B). Notes Zepbound became market leader in obesity prescriptions in Q4 2024. Provides 2025 guidance: $58-61B total company sales. **Historical data point, high quality.**

**BioSpectrum Asia (date unclear, reporting Q4 2024):** Reports Q4 2024 Zepbound sales of $1.2B, conflicting with CNBC's $1.91B figure. **Lower reliability due to discrepancy; likely reporting different geography or metric.**

**Globe and Mail (Jan 23, 2026):** Focuses on oncology; mentions Lilly's Q4 2025 earnings scheduled for Feb 4, 2026. Limited relevance to Zepbound forecasting. **Minimal value for this question.**

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive compilation of quarterly revenues 2023-2025. Key findings: Q2 2025 Zepbound = $3.38B, Q3 2025 = $3.588B. Notes Q1 2025 and Q4 2025 data not yet public. Manufacturing capacity expansions detailed with timelines (Pleasant Prairie 1H 2026, major facilities 2027+). **Useful synthesis but relies on secondary sources; gaps acknowledged.**

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Sequential quarterly growth of Zepbound (Q4 2024 → Q3 2025):** Most direct reference class. Shows trajectory from $1.91B (Q4 2024) → $3.38B (Q2 2025) → $3.588B (Q3 2025). **Highly suitable** - same product, recent data.

2. **Tirzepatide combined (Mounjaro + Zepbound) quarterly pattern:** Broader view showing total tirzepatide momentum. Q3 2025 combined = $10.1B. **Moderately suitable** - includes diabetes indication which may have different growth dynamics.

3. **GLP-1 market leader transitions (Novo Nordisk's Wegovy trajectory):** Wegovy launched 2021, faced supply constraints, gradual ramp. **Less suitable** - different company, earlier market conditions, less competitive landscape.

**Selected Reference Class:** Zepbound sequential quarterly growth (Q4 2024 through Q3 2025), supplemented by manufacturing capacity constraints and market expansion factors.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar 2026), results reported ~April/May 2026. We're forecasting approximately 2-4 months forward from today (Feb 1, 2026).

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

- Q4 2024: $1.91B (global figure from CNBC)
- Q1 2025: Not disclosed (gap in data)
- Q2 2025: $3.38B (77% increase from Q4 2024 if sequential)
- Q3 2025: $3.588B (6% QoQ growth)

**Key Observations:**
1. **Deceleration visible:** Q2→Q3 growth slowed dramatically (77% → 6% QoQ)
2. **Seasonality unknown:** Q1 2025 data missing prevents clear seasonal pattern identification
3. **Supply constraints easing:** FDA declared shortage over Dec 2024; Pleasant Prairie facility targeting 1H 2026 (could impact Q1 2026)
4. **Market penetration:** Became prescription leader Q4 2024, suggesting market share gains stabilizing

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
If Q3 2025 Zepbound = $3.588B and we assume modest sequential growth continuing:
- Conservative (2-5% QoQ): $3.66-3.77B
- Moderate (5-10% QoQ): $3.77-3.95B  
- Optimistic (10-15% QoQ): $3.95-4.13B

**Adjusting Factors:**

*Upward pressures:*
1. **Seasonal Q4→Q1 boost:** Pharmaceutical products often see Q1 uptick (new insurance coverage, deductible resets)
2. **Supply improvements:** Shortage ended Dec 2024; Pleasant Prairie facility may contribute marginal capacity
3. **International expansion:** Mounjaro launching in new markets 2025; Zepbound likely following
4. **Competitive advantage:** Head-to-head study showed 47% greater weight loss vs. Wegovy

*Downward pressures:*
1. **Growth deceleration:** Sharp slowdown Q2→Q3 suggests market saturation approaching
2. **Price pressure:** Q3 2025 results noted "lower realized prices" due to rebates/discounts
3. **Missing Q1 2025 baseline:** Without this data point, seasonal patterns unclear
4. **Market expectations:** Q4 2024 missed analyst expectations; pattern of underperformance

**Critical Insight:** The agent report shows Q3 2025 U.S. Zepbound = $3.57B (from Lilly's official release), while Q3 2025 total Zepbound = $3.588B. This implies international sales ≈$18M, or <1% of total. **Zepbound remains overwhelmingly U.S.-centric as of Q3 2025.** International expansion is nascent.

**Synthesis:**
Given the 6% QoQ growth Q2→Q3 2025, the lack of Q1 2025 data to establish seasonality, supply improvements offset by price pressures, and predominantly U.S. market with limited international contribution, I project Q1 2026 Zepbound revenue in the $3.7-4.2B range as the central tendency, with wider tails to account for:
- Downside: Further deceleration, unexpected supply issues, aggressive competitor actions
- Upside: Strong seasonal effect, faster international rollout, new indication approvals

Outside view calibration:

The key challenge is balancing recent deceleration (6% QoQ Q2→Q3) against potential seasonal strength and supply improvements. 

**Anchoring on Q3 2025 = $3.588B:**

For the **10th percentile** (pessimistic scenario): Significant headwinds - continued deceleration, pricing pressure intensifies, or Q1 seasonal weakness. A flat to slightly negative quarter: **$3.4B**

For the **20th percentile**: Modest deceleration continues, minimal seasonal benefit: 3% growth = **$3.7B**

For the **40th percentile**: Slight acceleration from Q3 baseline, small seasonal boost: 7% growth = **$3.84B**

For the **60th percentile** (median): Moderate growth resumption with supply improvements and seasonality: 12% growth = **$4.02B**

For the **80th percentile**: Strong seasonal effect, international expansion begins contributing meaningfully: 18% growth = **$4.23B**

For the **90th percentile** (optimistic): Exceptional performance - major international launches, new indication approval impact, strong U.S. growth: 25% growth = **$4.49B**

**Distribution check:** This creates a right-skewed distribution centered around $4.0B with meaningful downside protection (acknowledging deceleration risk) and upside potential (supply improvements, international expansion). The 10-90 range of $3.4-4.49B represents approximately ±25% from the median, appropriate given the 2-4 month forecast horizon and pharmaceutical market volatility.

**Validation against historical variance:** Q2→Q3 showed 6% growth; Q1→Q2 (inferred) showed ~77% growth. This enormous variance suggests high uncertainty is justified. The GLP-1 market has shown both explosive growth and sudden decelerations.
