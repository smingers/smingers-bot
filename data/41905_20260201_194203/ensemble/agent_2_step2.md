Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **Fierce Pharma (Oct 30, 2025)**: High-quality pharma industry outlet. Reports audited Q3 2025 results: Zepbound $3.6B (+185% YoY, +6% QoQ), Mounjaro $6.5B. Factual data from earnings release. Citi analyst opinion on CVS formulary impact being "limited" - credible named source.

2. **Yahoo Finance (Jan 15, 2026)**: Pre-earnings preview citing model estimates for Q4 2025: Zepbound $3.62B, Mounjaro $6.55B. These are analyst consensus estimates, not actuals. Moderate reliability for directional trends.

3. **CNBC Q3 2025 (Oct 30, 2025)**: First-tier financial news. Reports identical Q3 figures ($3.59B Zepbound, $6.52B Mounjaro). CEO Dave Ricks quotes on international expansion and direct-to-consumer strategy - highly credible named source.

4. **CNBC Q4 2024 (Feb 6, 2025)**: Historical baseline. Zepbound Q4 2024 = $1.91B (missed estimates by $70M). Critical for establishing growth trajectory.

5. **Fierce Pharma Q4 2024 (Feb 6, 2025)**: Confirms Q4 2024 figures. Notes 11-fold increase from Q4 2023 ($175M). Production capacity statement: 1.6x more doses in H1 2025 vs H1 2024.

6. **Morningstar (Jan 28, 2026)**: Focuses on Novo Nordisk but provides competitive context. Notes Lilly's orforglipron launch expected April 2026, Zepbound has "superior profile" to Wegovy. Expert analyst opinion, high credibility.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **CNBC (Feb 1, 2026)**: Current week preview noting Eli Lilly earnings scrutiny on GLP-1 sales and orforglipron FDA approval timing. No specific Q1 2026 forecasts.

8. **Benzinga (Jan 31, 2026)**: CEO Dave Ricks statement on Medicare coverage as "game-changing" for tirzepatide oral launch Q2 2026. Estimates 20-30M Medicare beneficiaries addressable. Named source, high credibility for strategic direction.

9. **Parameter/CNBC (Jan 30, 2026)**: $3.5B Pennsylvania plant announcement for retatrutide (next-gen drug), operational 2031. Confirms Q3 2025 combined tirzepatide sales >$10B. Factual, first-party announcement.

10. **Motley Fool (Jan 19, 2026)**: Analysis piece noting orforglipron regulatory submission late 2025, projected cheaper manufacturing than injectables. Opinion-based but logical competitive analysis.

11. **Bloomberg/Chosunbiz (Jan 8, 2026)**: Reports 2024 full-year GLP-1 sales: tirzepatide ~$358B globally, surpassing Keytruda's $315B. **Critical error check**: These figures appear to be in Korean won (₩), not USD. Converting: ₩358B ≈ $270M USD - this contradicts other sources showing quarterly sales >$3B. **Disregarding this source due to unit ambiguity.**

12. **Yahoo Finance (Oct 31, 2025)**: Confirms Q3 2025 results, notes tirzepatide surpassed Keytruda as world's top-selling drug. Projects orforglipron $11B sales by 2031 (GlobalData forecast). Moderate reliability for long-term projections.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Confirmed quarterly progression** (Multiple sources - Lilly filings, CNBC, Fierce Pharma):
   - Q4 2024: $1.91B → Q1 2025: ~$2.4B (derived) → Q2 2025: $3.38B → Q3 2025: $3.59B
   - Sequential growth slowing: Q2→Q3 only +6% vs prior 50-70% jumps
   - **Implication**: Supply constraints binding, not demand saturation

2. **Manufacturing capacity timeline** (Lilly CEO statements, press releases):
   - Pleasant Prairie, WI facility: "H1 2026" start-up, likely late Q2 per management
   - Q1 2026 operates under Q3 2025 constraints + marginal debottlenecking
   - **Implication**: Limited volume upside for Q1 2026, +10-20% realistic maximum

3. **International expansion limited** (Q3 2025 earnings, Morningstar):
   - EU/Canada/Japan approvals in 2H 2025 but allocations minimal
   - Ex-US <1% of Q3 2025 volume
   - **Implication**: Q1 2026 international contribution remains <5-8% of total

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Pricing pressure** (Multiple analyst reports, CEO commentary):
   - Gross-to-net deterioration cited in Q3 2025 call
   - CVS formulary exclusion since July 2025 (though Citi says "limited impact")
   - Walmart partnership for discounted vials (Oct 2025)
   - **Implication**: Blended ASP decline 3-5% plausible for Q1 2026

5. **Competitive dynamics** (Morningstar, Motley Fool):
   - Novo's oral Wegovy launched Jan 2026, "strong early prescriptions"
   - Lilly's orforglipron not launching until Q2 2026 (April expected)
   - **Implication**: Modest share pressure in Q1 2026, but injectable Zepbound still differentiated

6. **Seasonality** (Implicit in prescription data):
   - January typically sees New Year's resolution demand spike for weight-loss
   - **Implication**: +5-10% volume boost vs Q4 2025 baseline possible

**Weak Evidence:**

7. **Medicare coverage expansion** (Benzinga, CEO statement Jan 31):
   - Policy effective "later in 2026," not Q1
   - **Implication**: No material Q1 2026 impact, future upside only

8. **Direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth** (Q3 2025 commentary):
   - Lilly Direct gaining traction, but absolute contribution unclear
   - **Implication**: Directionally positive, magnitude uncertain

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Q1 2026 = Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026. Reported ~early May 2026.
- **Current date**: Feb 1, 2026 → 58 days into the quarter (65% complete)
- **Data lag**: Most January sales already occurred; February/March still uncertain

**If timeframe halved (to 45 days, ~half-quarter)**:
- Would predict ~50% of quarterly revenue: $2.0-2.5B range
- Less uncertainty due to shorter horizon

**If timeframe doubled (to 6 months, H1 2026)**:
- Would incorporate Pleasant Prairie capacity coming online in Q2
- Expected range: $8-10B for H1 2026 total
- Much wider uncertainty due to manufacturing ramp unknowns

## (d) Justification & Base Rate Adjustment

**Outside view base rate** (from provided context):
- Median: $4.2B, 10th percentile: $3.5B, 90th percentile: $6.7B
- This assumes ~17% growth vs Q3 2025 ($3.59B)

**Key adjustments to base rate:**

1. **Supply constraint reality** (Strong evidence): Q3 2025 growth decelerated to +6% QoQ despite demand signals remaining strong. Without new capacity in Q1 2026, expecting >20% QoQ growth is unrealistic. **Adjustment**: Lower median to $4.0B from $4.2B.

2. **Seasonal boost partially offset by pricing** (Moderate evidence): January demand spike (+5-10% volume) counteracted by gross-to-net erosion (-3-5% price). Net effect: +2-5% vs Q4 2025 implied run-rate. **Adjustment**: Maintains $4.0B median as reasonable.

3. **International contribution marginal** (Strong evidence): Even with EU/Japan launches, allocation limits mean <5% of volume. If Q3 2025 was 99% US, Q1 2026 might be 94% US - not material to top-line. **Adjustment**: No change to median, slight widening of upside tail if allocations exceed expectations.

4. **Competitive pressure muted** (Moderate evidence): Novo's oral Wegovy launched Jan 2026, but Zepbound's superior efficacy (per Morningstar) and existing market share (~60% of incretin prescriptions per Q3 data) provide buffer. Orforglipron not arriving until Q2. **Adjustment**: No significant downward revision needed.

5. **Q4 2025 baseline unknown** (Weak evidence): Yahoo Finance model estimate of $3.62B for Q4 2025 is unconfirmed. If actual Q4 2025 came in at $4.0B (10% above estimate due to holiday stockpiling), then Q1 2026 flat QoQ at $4.0B would still represent strong performance. **Adjustment**: Widens uncertainty range, particularly 40th-60th percentiles.

**Revised logic**:
- **Bear case** (10th percentile): Supply disruption (injector device shortage repeat), CVS impact worse than stated, Q4 2025 was inflated by channel stuffing → Q1 2026 reverts to $3.3B (flat vs Q3 2025).
- **Base case** (50th percentile): Modest volume growth (+8-12%) offset by pricing (-4%), international adds 3% → $3.59B × 1.07 = $3.84B. Round to $4.0B accounting for January seasonality.
- **Bull case** (90th percentile): Pleasant Prairie validation lots ship early Feb, DTC surge, international 10% of mix, minimal pricing pressure → $3.59B × 1.40 = $5.0B. Extend tail to $5.5B for unknown upside.

**Distribution shape**: Log-normal with right skew. Manufacturing is a hard ceiling (can't sell what isn't produced), but demand upside is theoretically unbounded if supply surprises.

Probability Calibration:

Starting from outside view, I adjust:

- **10th percentile**: $3.5B → $3.3B (downside if Q4 2025 baseline was weaker or supply issues)
- **Median (50th)**: $4.2B → $4.0B (temper optimism given supply constraints)
- **90th percentile**: $6.7B → $5.5B (Pleasant Prairie unlikely to contribute meaningfully in Q1; cap bull case)

Interpolating percentiles with log-normal assumption (σ ≈ 0.25 in log-space):

- 1st: $2.8B (extreme bear: major recall or capacity fire)
- 5th: $3.1B (persistent supply issues)
- 10th: $3.3B (flat QoQ from weak Q4 baseline)
- 20th: $3.6B (modest growth, high pricing pressure)
- 40th: $3.9B (base case lower bound)
- 60th: $4.3B (base case upper bound)
- 80th: $4.9B (strong execution, early capacity)
- 90th: $5.5B (all positives align)
- 95th: $6.0B (Pleasant Prairie early surprise)
- 99th: $7.0B (demand explosion + unforeseen capacity unlock)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Zepbound global Q1 2026 revenue (USD), Jan-Mar 2026, reported May 2026. ✓ Analysis focuses on quarterly sales drivers.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view median $4.2B anchored to Q3 2025 $3.59B + supply-constrained growth. ✓ Final prediction ($4.0B median) rooted here with modest downward adjustment.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = $4.0B; mean ≈ $4.2B (right-skewed). ✓ Aligns with supply ceiling logic and seasonal demand boost.

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Q3 2025 sequential growth only +6% (supply-bound)
   - Pleasant Prairie capacity not live until late Q2 2026
   - Pricing pressure from CVS exclusion + DTC discounting
   - International <5% contribution in Q1 2026
   - January seasonal demand partially offsets pricing headwinds

5. **Blind spot**: Q4 2025 actual revenue significantly exceeded $3.62B estimate (e.g., $4.5B due to year-end wholesaler stocking), making Q1 2026 appear as deceleration even if absolute level is strong. This would push my forecast DOWN (current prediction assumes ~$3.6-3.8B Q4 baseline). Alternatively, if Pleasant Prairie shipped validation lots in late January (unannounced), outcome could exceed $5.5B (pushes UP).
