Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and how I use it)

1) **STAT (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Tirzepatide (Mounjaro+Zepbound) combined sales were **$10.1B in Q3 2025**; YTD through Q3 2025 **$24.8B**; analyst full-year 2025 projection **$32.2B** (Visible Alpha).  
- **What it provides (opinions/interpretation):** “Best-selling medicine” framing and competitive narrative vs Keytruda.  
- **Quality:** High-quality journalism; the key numeric facts likely drawn from Lilly reporting and/or consensus aggregators. Useful as a **scale check** but not directly Zepbound-only.

2) **BioPharma Dive (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **Facts:** Confirms **Q3 2025 tirzepatide combined revenue $10.1B**; discusses historical issues like compounders during shortages; mentions Walmart discount deal implementation timing.  
- **Opinions:** Market growth expectations (“GLP-1 market > $100B next decade”) are broad and not directly forecastable into one quarter of one product’s net sales.  
- **Quality:** Solid industry outlet; good for **context/risk factors** (supply, pricing) more than point estimates.

3) **Eli Lilly Q3 2025 press release (PR Newswire copy)**  
- **Facts:** Official product detail for the quarter: **U.S. Zepbound revenue $3.57B in Q3 2025**; Mounjaro worldwide **$6.52B**; and commentary that volume growth was partly offset by **lower realized prices**.  
- **Quality:** Primary-source financial disclosure; **highest reliability** for anchoring levels/trends.  
- **Limitation:** It cites **U.S. Zepbound**, while the question asks **global** Zepbound. Still very useful to anchor magnitude and pricing/volume dynamics.

4) **CNBC (Feb 6, 2025) re: Q4 2024 earnings**  
- **Facts:** Reports **Q4 2024 Zepbound revenue $1.91B** (and Mounjaro $3.53B). Notes both slightly below analyst expectations; mentions rebate/discount dynamics.  
- **Quality:** Mainstream outlet summarizing earnings; generally reliable, but we should prefer Lilly’s own filings when possible. Still helpful for **recent-quarter trajectory** and **gross-to-net** dynamics.

5) **BioSpectrum Asia (Q4 2024 recap)**  
- **Facts:** Claims **Q4 2024 Zepbound sales $1.2B**, which conflicts with CNBC’s $1.91B and other compiled sources.  
- **Quality:** Lower reliability given the conflict; I treat this as **potentially mistaken** or using a different definition (e.g., geography, gross vs net, partial-quarter, etc.). I put little weight on it.

6) **Globe and Mail / Zacks-themed preview (Jan 23, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Mostly oncology-related and general mentions of tirzepatide leadership; no Zepbound revenue numbers.  
- **Quality/use:** Not directly useful for quantifying Zepbound Q1 2026.

7) **Agent report (compiled quarterly revenues + capacity timeline)**  
- **Facts presented:** A quarter-by-quarter table including **Zepbound worldwide** estimates such as **Q2 2025 $3.380B** and **Q3 2025 $3.588B**, plus earlier quarters; also a manufacturing expansion timeline.  
- **Quality:** This is a **secondary compilation** with some “derived” numbers and some sources I cannot verify from inside this prompt. I use it as a **structured starting point** and consistency check, but I avoid treating it as definitive where it conflicts or where it’s “derived.”

**Net: For an outside-view baseline, the most dependable numeric anchor is the official Q3 2025 disclosure (U.S. Zepbound $3.57B) plus the broad confirmation that tirzepatide is now extremely large ($10.1B combined in Q3 2025). For global Zepbound specifically, the agent-compiled “worldwide Zepbound” series is plausible and internally consistent (Q2–Q3 2025 near-flat at ~$3.4–$3.6B), but I keep uncertainty wide.**

### (b) Reference class analysis (what past patterns are most comparable?)

Possible reference classes:

1) **Zepbound’s own last ~6 quarters (launch-to-hypergrowth-to-slowing growth)**  
- **Why suitable:** Same product, same reporting conventions (net sales), same payer dynamics, same supply expansions.  
- **Key pattern:** Early explosive growth (2024) shifting toward **capacity/pricing-limited** growth by mid/late 2025.

2) **Other GLP-1 obesity drug ramp (e.g., Wegovy) — blockbuster constrained by supply and reimbursement**  
- **Why suitable:** Similar demand curve and “shortage/pricing/coverage” constraints.  
- **Limitation:** Different company strategies and reporting; also Zepbound’s ramp appears faster given Lilly’s position and demand.

3) **General “new pharma blockbuster” quarterly net sales after ~2 years on market**  
- **Why suitable:** Provides generic guardrails on deceleration and seasonality.  
- **Limitation:** GLP-1 obesity is unusually demand-elastic and supply-constrained; generic blockbuster curves may understate volatility.

**Most suitable:** (1) **Zepbound’s own trajectory** (supplemented by (2) for supply/pricing constraint intuition).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Target quarter:** **Q1 2026** (Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026).  
- **Today:** Feb 1, 2026. We are **inside the quarter** with about **2 months remaining** in the sales period, and about **~3 additional months** until reporting (by early May 2026).

**Typical quarter-to-quarter considerations for this domain:**
- Q/Q changes can be driven by: (i) **supply available** (fill/finish and pen capacity), (ii) **gross-to-net swings** (rebates/discounts, payer mix), (iii) **coverage expansion** (employer/PBM decisions), and (iv) **demand persistence** (adherence/continuation).  
- Seasonality is ambiguous in obesity meds: New-year “weight loss” demand could help Q1, but insurance resets and affordability frictions can also bite. Netting these out is uncertain, reinforcing the need for wide intervals.

### (d) Justification for an outside-view baseline

**Anchor the level:**  
- By Q3 2025, Zepbound is already a multi-billion-per-quarter product (officially **$3.57B in the U.S.** alone in Q3 2025). Even if global is not much higher than U.S. at that time, the “global Zepbound” figure plausibly sits in the **$3.5B–$4.0B** range by late 2025.

**Trend extrapolation (base-rate style):**
- The compiled series suggests Zepbound growth **slowed** by mid-2025 (Q2 to Q3 2025 roughly flat-to-slightly-up). That pattern is consistent with a product hitting **near-term capacity and/or payer friction**, not lack of demand.  
- Over the next two quarters (Q4 2025 and Q1 2026), the outside-view expectation is **continued growth but decelerating**, unless a major capacity step-change arrives exactly in that window.

**Key uncertainties that widen the distribution:**
- **Supply step-ups:** If incremental capacity (including new/expanded fill-finish) meaningfully comes online by early 2026, Q1 2026 could jump.  
- **Price/realized net:** Lilly has explicitly cited **lower realized prices** offsetting volume; a larger-than-expected gross-to-net shift could depress reported net sales even if prescriptions rise.  
- **Coverage/discounting:** Deals (e.g., large retail/employer programs) can increase volume but sometimes reduce realized net, making revenue response non-linear.  
- **Reporting definition risk:** “Zepbound global” depends on how Lilly books any non-U.S. Zepbound-branded sales (and whether some obesity use abroad remains under Mounjaro branding). This creates measurement uncertainty.

**Outside-view central tendency:**  
Given the late-2025 run-rate around the mid–high $3Bs per quarter and the likelihood of some continued expansion, my outside-view median for Q1 2026 global Zepbound net sales is around the **mid $4B** range.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I’m aiming for a **true uncertainty distribution** rather than a tight point estimate. In pharma quarterly net sales—especially in GLP-1s—**surprises of ±15–30% vs trend** are common due to supply and gross-to-net.  
- I therefore set a **wide 10–90 interval** (roughly spanning about ~2x from low to high tail) to reflect:  
  - downside: pricing pressure/gross-to-net swing or supply interruptions  
  - upside: step-change in supply + strong Q1 demand + broader coverage  
- I keep the upper tail meaningful (but not extreme) because revenue growth can be lumpy if production constraints ease.
