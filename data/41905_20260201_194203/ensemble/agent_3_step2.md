Analysis:
1) Target variable / resolution criteria
Forecast the value of Eli Lilly’s reported “Global” (or “Total”) net sales for Zepbound (tirzepatide) for Q1 2026 (quarter ending 2026-03-31) as shown in Lilly’s first official earnings release or 10-Q for that quarter. Units: dollars.

(a) Source analysis (what each source contributes; quality; fact vs opinion)
- CNBC (Oct 30 2025) on Q3 2025 earnings: High-quality secondary reporting of primary earnings data. Key factual datapoint: Q3 2025 Zepbound revenue 3590000000. Also reports Mounjaro 6520000000 and company total 17600000000. Minimal opinion.
- Fierce Pharma (Oct 30 2025): Reputable trade press, consistent with CNBC. Factual: “nearly 3.6B” for Q3 2025 Zepbound; notes sequential growth 6% vs Q2 2025. Also describes CVS formulary removal as limited impact (attributed to Citi). Citi view is expert opinion.
- Yahoo Finance (Jan 15 2026) preview: Medium-quality secondary source; key item is model/consensus-style estimates (not facts). Opinion/estimate: Q4 2025 Zepbound 3620000000; Mounjaro 6550000000. Useful as a market-expectations anchor.
- CNBC (Feb 6 2025) on Q4 2024 earnings: High-quality historical datapoint: Q4 2024 Zepbound 1910000000 (fact).
- Morningstar (Jan 28 2026) re Novo Nordisk: High-quality analyst commentary but indirect for Zepbound. Relevant opinions: US GLP-1 prices may fall sharply in 2026; oral Wegovy launch early data “really good”; Lilly orforglipron expected to launch April 2026 (timing matters because it is mostly after Q1).
- AskNews / CNBC (Feb 1 2026 “7 big things…”): High-quality but contains no numbers for Q1 2026 Zepbound; just highlights investor focus on GLP-1 sales (context only).
- AskNews / Motley Fool & Nasdaq opinion pieces: Low-to-medium forecasting value; largely promotional/optimistic narratives, not decision-grade quantitative evidence.
- AskNews / AP and other outlets on new Lilly plant: High-quality for long-run capacity narrative, but plant operational 2031 so not directly relevant to Q1 2026 volumes (near-zero direct impact).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large shifts):
- Actual recent revenue trajectory is the best anchor: Q4 2024 Zepbound 1910000000 (CNBC) and Q3 2025 3590000000 (CNBC). This establishes the “current level” and the growth regime.
- Q3 2025 sequential growth reported as only ~6% (Fierce Pharma/CNBC). This is a structural warning against extrapolating earlier hypergrowth.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):
- Street/preview estimate for Q4 2025 Zepbound around 3620000000 (Yahoo Finance, Jan 15 2026). While uncertain until Feb 4, it suggests a plateau around mid-3B rather than an immediate jump to >4B.
- 2026 price pressure/competition signals: oral Wegovy launched early Jan 2026 with strong early scripts (Morningstar; also echoed by other pieces). Mechanism: competitor could slow Zepbound volume growth and/or push rebates/discounting, lowering realized price.

Weak evidence (small shifts):
- CVS formulary exclusion narrative (“limited impact”) is plausible but hard to quantify for Q1 2026 without updated channel data.
- Long-term capacity expansions and pipeline enthusiasm do not move Q1 2026 much (timing mismatch).

Net: compared to the provided outside-view distribution (median ~4020000000), the strongest “inside view” update is that the most recent hard datapoint (Q3 2025) plus near-term consensus (Q4 2025) implies slower near-term ramp and possibly more pricing pressure in early 2026.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Today: 2026-02-01. Outcome quarter: 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31. Resolution via earnings release/10-Q around late April/early May 2026. Roughly 3 months until the quarter ends and ~3 months until the report.
- If the timeframe were halved (forecasting a single month or to mid-quarter), uncertainty would drop (less room for pricing/formulary shocks), and I’d narrow the 90/10 range.
- If doubled (forecasting a full year ahead), uncertainty would rise sharply due to policy/pricing/competition and capacity changes; I’d widen tails substantially.

(d) Justification (how I move from outside view to inside view)
Outside view baseline given: centered around ~4020000000 with 10-90 of 3400000000 to 4490000000.

Key inside-view adjustments:
1) “Level-setting” via near-term consensus: If Q4 2025 is about 3620000000 (Yahoo Finance estimate) and Q3 2025 actual was 3590000000 (CNBC), that pattern implies a plateau around 3.6B heading into 2026, not a step-change to >4B immediately. This pushes my median down modestly versus the outside view.
2) Competition/pricing in early 2026: oral Wegovy launched in Jan 2026 with strong early scripts (Morningstar and other summaries). Even if it doesn’t reduce Zepbound volume outright, it can increase rebate competition, lowering net realized price. That also tilts me downward and slightly widens downside tail.
3) Offsetting positives: supply is no longer in official shortage (historical context) and Lilly continues to push cash-pay/direct channels; these support continued growth and keep the upper tail meaningful.

Result: modest downward shift of central tendency (outside-view median ~4.02B to inside-view median ~3.9-4.0B) and slightly wider tails to reflect price/competitive uncertainty.

Probability calibration:
- Status quo / trend continuation: Q3 2025 3590000000 and (estimated) Q4 2025 3620000000 implies very low sequential growth; projecting another quarter of low-to-mid single-digit growth plus pricing pressure yields ~3.8-4.0B.
- Upside scenario (drives 80th-99th): better-than-expected net pricing stability + continued volume ramp + channel fill effects could push to ~4.7-6.0B.
- Downside scenario (drives 1st-20th): aggressive discounting/rebate resets in early 2026, competitor share capture, or channel inventory corrections could keep Q1 near ~3.3-3.6B (or lower in a sharper correction).

Checklist:
1) Target variable: Lilly-reported global net sales for Zepbound in Q1 2026, in dollars.
2) Outside view base rate used: median ~4020000000 (given distribution centered near 4.0B).
3) Consistency: Implied median ~4000000000; mean ~4050000000; consistent with mild right-skew and competitive/pricing uncertainty.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Q3 2025 Zepbound revenue 3590000000 (CNBC, factual).
   - Reported sequential growth around 6% in mid-2025 (Fierce Pharma/CNBC, factual).
   - Market expectation Q4 2025 Zepbound ~3620000000 (Yahoo Finance, estimate).
   - Oral Wegovy launch early Jan 2026 with strong early scripts (Morningstar, analyst observation).
5) Blind spot: A major positive pricing/coverage change or unexpected international acceleration in Q1 2026 would push revenue materially higher than forecast.
