Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. STAT (30 Oct 2025) – Well-regarded industry outlet. Provides audited Q3-25 results ($10.1 B tirzepatide total, $17.6 B company revenue) and Visible Alpha consensus for FY-25. Information is factual; tone is descriptive.  
2. BioPharma Dive (30 Oct 2025) – Repeats Q3-25 figures, offers analyst commentary on guidance. Factual numbers are identical to Lilly filings; opinions (“stock has remained flat…”) are journalistic.  
3. PR Newswire / Lilly press release (30 Oct 2025) – First-party data. Gives the split: Zepbound U.S. $3.57 B, Mounjaro worldwide $6.52 B. Highest reliability.  
4. CNBC (6 Feb 2025) – Summarises Lilly Q4-24. Factual, drawn from SEC filings.  
5. BioSpectrum Asia (6 Feb 2025) – Same Q4-24, smaller readership, but figures mirror CNBC.  
6. Globe and Mail (23 Jan 2026) – Preview of Q4-25 earnings focused on oncology; no new tirzepatide data, low direct relevance.  
7. Agent report (compiled 1 Feb 2026) – Collates quarterly tirzepatide splits 2023-Q3 2025 and maps capacity projects. Raw numbers all trace back to Lilly filings; where “derived” or “n/a” is flagged, uncertainty is noted. Useful as structured historical series.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Trajectory of Zepbound’s own quarterly sales since launch (most direct).  
• Ramp pattern of other mega-blockbuster launches with supply constraints (e.g., Humira, Keytruda, Wegovy).  
• Company-wide new-product ramps at Lilly.  
Given product-specific supply limits and the unprecedented demand for GLP-1s, the closest fit is Zepbound’s own series adjusted for capacity announcements. I adopt that as primary reference class.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome quarter: Jan–Mar 2026, reported early May 2026 → 3 months of sales roughly 60–90 days from today; 90 days until disclosure.  
Historic pattern (Zepbound global, $ B):  
Q4-23 0.18 → Q1-24 0.52 (+190 %) → Q2-24 1.24 (+138 %) → Q3-24 1.26 (+2 %) → Q4-24 1.94 (+54 %) → Q2-25 3.38 (+74 % vs Q4-24) → Q3-25 3.59 (+6 %). Growth has clearly decelerated as supply became binding.  

d) Justification (outside view)  
1. Base-rate growth: Over the five consecutive quarters from Q2-24 to Q3-25, CAGR ≈ 79 %. Extrapolating that would overshoot because Q3-25 growth was only 6 %.  
2. Supply: First incremental new fill-finish capacity (Pleasant Prairie, WI) is due “1H-2026”. Management guidance on prior calls said “late Q2 start-up”; therefore Q1-26 should still operate under Q3-25 constraints plus marginal internal efficiencies (RTP, NC line debottlenecking end-2025). Net: assume 10–25 % volume lift vs Q3-25.  
3. Geography: EU, Canada and Japan marketing authorisations came in 2H-25 but launches were limited by allocation. Ex-US share was <1 % in Q3-25. Assume it rises to 5-10 % of volume in Q1-26 (regulator-mandated minimum supply + early private pay).  
4. Price/mix: Lilly signalled further US gross-to-net pressure of 3-5 pp in 2026; partially offset by modestly higher ex-US price points. We model a blended ASP decline of 4 %.  
5. Therefore: Global revenue = Q3-25 baseline 3.59 B × (1.15 median volume gain) × (0.96 price factor) ≈ 3.96 B.  
6. Uncertainty tails: Upside if Pleasant Prairie quietly started validation lots in Feb-26 (+0.8 B); downside if injector device shortage resurfaces (-0.6 B).

Outside view calibration:
I centre the distribution at 4.2 B (slightly above point estimate reflecting seasonally higher January prescription uptick) with σ ≈ 0.8 B (20 %). A log-normal shape is reasonable; I convert to percentiles:
