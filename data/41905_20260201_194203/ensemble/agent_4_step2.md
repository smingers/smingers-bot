All other Asknews pieces either duplicate the above numbers or offer distant-horizon speculation and are assigned weak weight.

B. Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• Audited sales trajectory: 1910 m (Q4-24) → 3380 m (Q2-25) → 3588 m (Q3-25).  
• Capacity still the binding constraint; no reported production setbacks.

Moderate evidence  
• Street Q4-25 consensus 3620 m suggests growth plateau.  
• International launches (EU, Brazil, India late-25) add incremental volume.  
• Fresh deductible resets in Jan historically trim realised prices 5-7 % for GLP-1 class.

Weak evidence  
• CVS exclusion impact conjecture; lack of granular data.  
• Long-term manufacturing announcements (Pennsylvania 2031).

C. Timeframe analysis

Target event: Q1 2026 revenue, to be reported ~90 days from now.  
Halving timeframe (forecast made mid-Mar): most of quarter already booked → narrower distribution (≈ –20 % width).  
Doubling timeframe (forecast for Q3 2026): new capacity and orforglipron approval could shift mean upward ≥ 20 %, widen tails.

D. Outside-view base rate & inside-view adjustments

Base rate (extrapolation of 3-quarter CAGR ≈ 30 %): Points to ~4650 m.  
Adjustments:  
– Supply still limiting (−300 m)  
+ International roll-outs (+350 m)  
– Gross-to-net pressure, deductible reset (−250 m)  
Net shift −200 m → Median ≈ 4450 m.

Upside tail drivers: unexpected fill-finish uptick; Medicare early pilot; limited price erosion.  
Downside tail drivers: production hiccup; aggressive rebating to retain share vs oral Wegovy.

Probability calibration
Mean ≈ 4500 m; stdev ≈ 900 m (coefficient of variation 0.2). 90 % CI spans 3200–6000 m.

Checklist (abridged)

1. Variable: Global net sales of Zepbound, Q1 2026, USD.  
2. Base rate: 30 % yoy growth from 3588 m in Q3-25.  
3. Consistency: Implied median 4450 m; mean 4500 m; matches narrative.  
4. Key evidence: a) Official run-rate 3588 m Q3-25; b) Street 3620 m Q4 model; c) capacity still tight; d) international launches Q4-25; e) Q1 gross-to-net seasonality.  
5. Blind-spot: Major fill-finish expansion quietly came online 1 Jan 2026 → revenue leaps > 6500 m (upside).
