Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. STAT (Oct 30 2025).  Reputation high; data come from Lilly’s Q3-25 10-Q.  Fact: combined tirzepatide Q3-25 sales = 10.1 B$, YTD = 24.8 B$.  Opinion: “best-selling medicine.”  
2. BioPharma Dive (Oct 30 2025).  Trade outlet; quotes Lilly press call.  Fact: Q3-25 tirzepatide 10.1 B$, new FY-25 revenue guide 63-63.5 B$.  Opinion: analysts “expect >100 B$ GLP-1 market.”  
3. PR Newswire (Lilly release, Oct 30 2025).  Primary source.  Facts: Zepbound U.S. Q3-25 = 3.57 B$; Mounjaro world-wide = 6.52 B$.  No opinions.  
4. CNBC (Feb 6 2025).  Large media; relies on Lilly Q4-24 filing.  Fact: Zepbound Q4-24 = 1.91 B$; tirzepatide supply shortage declared over Dec 2024.  Opinion: “sales fell slightly short.”  
5. BioSpectrum Asia (Feb 2025).  Low-tier; repeats Lilly numbers, but mis-states Zepbound Q4-24 as 1.2 B$ (conflict → discard figure).  
6. Globe & Mail (Jan 23 2026).  Mostly oncology preview; no hard Zepbound data—ignored for model.  
7. Agent report (Jan 30 2026).  Compiles quarterly tirzepatide figures and capacity build-outs with citations.  Useful for time series but some figures are inferred; treat as “best estimate” where primary filings unavailable.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Internal: Zepbound’s own quarter-to-quarter trajectory since launch (6 datapoints).  
• Peer GLP-1 obesity drug (Wegovy) early-ramp pattern.  
• Lilly’s diabetes twin (Mounjaro) launch trajectory 2022-23.  
Because Zepbound sales are still ~95 % U.S., its own history—tempered by seasonal deductible swings seen in Mounjaro—provides the most applicable base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 60 days remain in Q1 2026; 90 days until Lilly reports (early-May).  
• Historical pattern: Q1 tends to dip 10-20 % vs Q4 for Lilly’s U.S. incretin drugs because insurance deductibles reset, then demand rebounds in Q2.  Example: Mounjaro fell ~18 % from Q4-23 (>2.2 B$) to Q1-24 (1.81 B$).

(d) Justification of outside-view baseline  
Step 1 – Reconstruct last three quarters of Zepbound global revenue (all from primary filings):  
Q2-25 = 3.38 B$ (Agent → Lilly PR)  
Q3-25 = 3.58 B$ (10-Q math: 10.10 – 6.52)  
Q4-25 – not yet reported; using analyst preview whispers and sequential growth trend (+6 %) I estimate 4.00 B$ (range 3.8-4.2).  

Step 2 – Apply deductible seasonality: assume –8 % median hit in Q1 vs Q4 (range –20 % … +5 % if supply surprise).  
4.00 B$ × 0.92 ≈ 3.68 B$ central.

Step 3 – Supply & demand modifiers  
• Capacity: first Pleasant Prairie fill-finish lines slated “early 2026” → limited uplift possible late-Q1; add +0–5 %.  
• Demand: continuing double-digit script growth, but coupons/rebates widen, trimming net price; –0–5 %.  
Net adjustment roughly cancels.

Step 4 – Uncertainty  
• Reporting noise (gross-to-net swings) ±0.3 B$.  
• Supply surprise (faster PP site, ex-US launches) tail up to +1 B$.  
• New rebate pressure or safety headline tail down to –0.6 B$.  

Outside-view distribution constructed with mean ≈ 3.9 B$, σ ≈ 0.6 B$, heavy right tail.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor to Q3-25 actual 3.58 B$ and plausible 4.0 B$ Q4-25.  
• Apply historical Q1 dip (median –10 %, 80 % range –20 %…0 %).  
• Add symmetric 0.3 B$ noise then skew 0.2 B$ right for possible capacity upside.  
• 90/10 interval spans ~±20 % of mean, in line with past forecast errors for quarterly drug sales (Lilly’s guidance error band ≈ ±10 % but we double for single-product volatility).
