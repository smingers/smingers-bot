Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight given to primary SEC-quality data)

1. Eli Lilly 10-Q & press release for Q3 2025 (30 Oct 2025, SEC filing / PR).  
   • Facts: global Zepbound 3590 million, sequential +6 %, y/y +184 %. No opinion. – Strong, primary.

2. Fierce Pharma & CNBC articles covering the same filing (30 Oct 2025).  
   • Add no new numbers but confirm 3590 million and 6 % q/q. – Strong corroboration.

3. Lilly Q4 2024 10-K & CNBC coverage (6 Feb 2025).  
   • Facts: global Zepbound 1910 million, +11× y/y. – Strong.

4. Yahoo Finance preview of Q4 2025 (15 Jan 2026).  
   • Analyst consensus: Zepbound 3620 million for Q4 2025. – Moderate (single-analyst model).

5. CNBC market-week preview (1 Feb 2026).  
   • Notes that Street is “focused on GLP-1 sales”, but gives no forecast. – Weak.

6. Misc. articles on capacity expansion, CVS exclusion, oral Wegovy launch (Oct 2025–Jan 2026).  
   • Provide context on supply, competition and pricing. Data points are qualitative. – Weak-to-moderate.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong evidence  
• Verified quarterly trajectory: 1910 M (Q4 24) → ~3350 M (Q2 25) → 3590 M (Q3 25).  
• Historical seasonality for GLP-1s: Q1 usually 8-18 % lower than Q4 because of US deductible reset.

Moderate evidence  
• Street estimate of 3620 M for Q4 25 (implies continuing double-digit growth).  
• Manufacturing statements: supply constraints largely solved by mid-2025, new lines start early 2026.  
• International launches (China, Brazil, India) give steady ex-US tail-wind.

Weak evidence  
• Competitive noise from CVS and oral Wegovy (too recent to shift Q1 materially).  
• Speculative Medicare coverage later in 2026 (outside Q1 window).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast horizon: 90 days until Q1 2026 results (~early-May 2026).  
• If horizon were halved (45 days of sales left) I would narrow S.D. by ~15 %.  
• If doubled (180 days) I would widen S.D. by ~25 % because oral competitors and wider price pressure would start to matter.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment of outside base rate

1. Reconstructed sequential run-rate  
   – Q2 25 3380 M (filings)  
   – Q3 25 3590 M (+6 %)  
   – Q4 25 Street 3620 M (+1 %) -- I adopt 3700 M as midpoint (filing not yet out, 4 Feb).

2. Apply seasonality: median drop –10 % from Q4 to Q1 → 3700 M × 0.90 ≈ 3330 M.

3. Volume growth offset: continuing 3-4 % monthly TRx growth and partial DTC shift adds +10 % back by March. Net: 3330 M × 1.10 ≈ 3660 M.

4. Price mix and rebate drift (CVS, larger Medicaid share): -2 % (~-70 M).

Central estimate ≈ 3600 M.

Uncertainty:  
• Gross-to-net swings ±6 % (±220 M)  
• Supply upside tail (earlier Pleasant Prairie fill-finish) up to +800 M  
• Safety/pricing headline tail down to -600 M

=> Approx. log-normal-ish distribution with mean 3900 M, median 3600 M, 80 % range 3000–4500 M.

Probability calibration

I translate the above to discrete percentiles (strictly increasing):

Distribution:  
Percentile 1: 2500 000 000  
Percentile 5: 2800 000 000  
Percentile 10: 3000 000 000  
Percentile 20: 3300 000 000  
Percentile 40: 3600 000 000  
Percentile 60: 3900 000 000  
Percentile 80: 4400 000 000  
Percentile 90: 5000 000 000  
Percentile 95: 5500 000 000  
Percentile 99: 6200 000 000  

Checklist:

1. Target variable: “Global Zepbound net revenue in Q1 2026, USD, as per first Lilly 10-Q.”  
2. Outside-view base: 10 % sequential Q1 dip from Q4 25 on ~3700 M → 3330 M.  
3. Consistency: implied median 3600 M; mean 3900 M; matches justification and fat right tail.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Verified Q3 25 sales 3590 M (+6 % q/q).  
   • Consensus Q4 25 ≈ 3620 M.  
   • Typical Q1 seasonality −10 %.  
   • Capacity expansion largely resolved supply constraints.  
   • CVS formulary loss appears low impact so far.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected FDA safety warning halts new starts in March 2026 (would push revenue far below 3000 M).
