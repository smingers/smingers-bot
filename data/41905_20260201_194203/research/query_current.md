Analysis:
To build a point estimate and a distribution for Zepbound’s 2026-Q1 global revenue I first need:  
• Eli Lilly’s just-released 2025-Q4 earnings (likely issued today/yesterday) – these give the latest actual quarterly Zepbound sales and any 2026 revenue or supply guidance.  
• Management commentary and SEC filings around manufacturing expansion (the RTP, Concord, and Lehigh Valley sites; external contractors such as Samsung Biologics), because capacity is currently the binding constraint.  
• Sell-side analyst notes or major newswire stories published since the earnings call that quantify 2026 expectations (many banks will update their models today).  
• Any 2025 year-end prescription or shipment data from IQVIA/Symphony or Novo regulatory statements that shed light on demand growth going into 2026.  

The three searches below target these needs: one broad Google web search for formal guidance, one Google News search for real-time coverage of the Q4-2025 print, and one AskNews query to surface analyst forecast articles and capacity-expansion reports that may not be in the general news flow.
