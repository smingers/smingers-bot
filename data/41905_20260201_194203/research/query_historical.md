Analysis:
Eli Lilly began commercial sales of Zepbound (tirzepatide for obesity) in the United States in December 2023; ex-US launches have since rolled out but remain limited relative to Mounjaro (diabetes version of tirzepatide).  
Key pieces of historical context I want to assemble before forming a forecast:

1. Quarterly sales history for tirzepatide in both indications.  
   • Mounjaro sales from its May 2022 launch through Q4 2025 give a demand-ramp template.  
   • Zepbound sales first appeared separately in Lilly’s Q4 2023 earnings materials; subsequent quarters (Q1-Q4 2024 and Q1-Q4 2025) will show its growth trajectory and seasonality.

2. Supply-constrained versus demand-constrained growth.  Lilly has repeatedly stated that tirzepatide growth is supply-limited, with large capacity additions scheduled for 2024-25 (Concord, RTP, Alzey, etc.).  Understanding when each plant came/comes online will help project Q1 2026 output.

3. Competitive and reimbursement landscape.  GLP-1–related shortages, Wegovy supply, Medicare/Medicaid coverage, and broad commercial plan adoption all influence achievable revenue in early-2026.

4. Pricing and geography mix.  Because Lilly reports “global” revenue, ex-US launches (EU, Japan) could materially add to sales by Q1 2026, but at lower list prices.  I need launch dates and early uptake figures.

Therefore, the most relevant historical data to collect immediately are:
• Zepbound quarterly net sales Q4 2023–Q4 2025.  
• Mounjaro quarterly net sales over the same window (to gauge total tirzepatide capacity).  
• Press releases / earnings call transcripts on manufacturing capacity timelines.  
• Analyst or company guidance for 2025 and early-2026 tirzepatide sales.
