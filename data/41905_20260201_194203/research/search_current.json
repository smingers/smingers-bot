global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide)?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Here are the 7 big things we're focused on in the stock market this week**\nThe stock market is focused on several key developments this week, beginning with a wave of earnings reports from S&P 500 companies, including six portfolio stocks. Earnings season has been strong so far, with 75% of companies reporting a positive earnings-per-share surprise and 65% a positive revenue surprise. By week's end, over half of the S&P 500 will have reported. The most anticipated economic report is the U.S. nonfarm payrolls for January, released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 75,000 new jobs, a stable unemployment rate of 4.4%, and a 0.3% monthly increase in average hourly earnings. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday and the ADP employment survey on Wednesday are considered less important. The manufacturing PMI is expected to remain in contraction, while the services PMI is likely to show continued expansion. Key earnings highlights include: Eaton Corp. is spinning off its Mobility Group, which investors view positively; Eli Lilly is under scrutiny for GLP-1 drug sales (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and the upcoming FDA approval of orforglipron; Alphabet is being watched for signs that AI investments are paying off, particularly in search and cloud; Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s commercial performance will be critical amid patent expirations; Linde\u2019s earnings will test the sustainability of its recent 17% rally; and Amazon\u2019s AWS performance will be closely analyzed, especially in the context of AI-driven cloud competition. Analysts expect revenue of $211.32 billion and earnings of $1.97 per share for Amazon. A full list of reporting companies is provided by date and time.

According to Ricks, the new policy could dramatically expand access to tirzepatide, enabling millions of Medicare beneficiaries\u2014estimated between 20 million and 30 million\u2014to obtain the drug shortly after its launch. He noted that the program could significantly lower costs, making GLP-1 therapies more widely accessible. Eli Lilly plans to launch tirzepatide in the second quarter, with Medicare coverage expected to take effect later in 2026. Ricks anticipates a 'accelerated volume growth' as more patients gain insurance access by late 2026. He highlighted that demand remains strong, citing that many early users of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy have used GLP-1 therapy for the first time, indicating underserved demand. Eli Lilly\u2019s oral formulation is expected to appeal to patients beyond current injectable users. In contrast, Novo Nordisk outspent Eli Lilly on advertising in 2025: MediaRadar data shows Novo spent $316 million on Wegovy and $169 million on Ozempic from January to September 2025\u2014up 54% and 44% respectively from the same period in 2024. Eli Lilly spent $131 million on its obesity drug Zepbound and $83 million on its diabetes drug Mounjaro, compared to $2 million in 2024. Both companies are scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday, February 4, 2026. Stock prices: According to Benzinga Pro, Eli Lilly (LLY) closed at $1,037.15 on Friday, up 1.27%, but fell 0.12% in after-hours trading to $1,035.88. LLY is ranked favorably in Benzinga\u2019s Edge Stock Rankings for medium- and long-term trends, but has a low value score and a downward short-term trend.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50286167/ceo)\n\n**Should You Buy Novo Nordisk Stock on Oral Wegovy's Strong Launch?**\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) has launched its oral version of Wegovy, approved in December 2025, with early sales data indicating strong performance\u2014prescription volume in the first two weeks exceeded that of the original injectable Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound at the same stage post-launch. The oral formulation aims to expand Novo Nordisk\u2019s addressable market by appealing to patients who avoid injections due to needle phobia or logistical challenges like cold storage. It also offers a lower out-of-pocket cost, increasing accessibility for uninsured individuals. While oral Wegovy is expected to generate peak sales of approximately $3.3 billion, it is unlikely to match the revenue of injectable therapies due to its lower price point. Eli Lilly is expected to launch its own oral GLP-1 drug later in 2026, intensifying competition. Despite this, Novo Nordisk\u2019s robust pipeline\u2014including CagriSema, which outperformed Wegovy in a phase 3 trial, and Amycretin, a next-generation weight-loss drug in late-stage development\u2014supports long-term growth. The company has multiple early-stage candidates in development. Although the stock has declined significantly over the past two years, The Motley Fool recommends Novo Nordisk as a buy, citing its strong product lineup and growth potential, even though it was not included in the analyst team\u2019s recent list of top 10 stocks to buy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:05 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-novo-nordisk-stock-oral-wegovys-strong-launch)\n\n**Should You Buy Novo Nordisk Stock on Oral Wegovy's Strong Launch?**\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) faced challenges in the weight-loss market in 2024, particularly from Eli Lilly, but is regaining momentum with the launch of oral Wegovy, approved in December 2025 and launched in early January 2026. Early data indicates strong initial demand: oral Wegovy\u2019s prescription volume in its first two weeks exceeded that of the original injectable Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound at the same stage post-launch. The oral formulation targets patients who avoid injections due to needle phobia or logistical challenges like cold storage, and offers a lower out-of-pocket cost, broadening the addressable market. While oral Wegovy is expected to generate peak sales of approximately $3.3 billion\u2014less than injectable versions due to lower pricing\u2014it is seen as a key driver of long-term sales growth. Novo Nordisk also has a robust pipeline, including CagriSema (which outperformed Wegovy in phase 3 trials), Amycretin (a next-gen therapy in late-stage trials), and multiple early-stage candidates. Despite competition from Eli Lilly, which is expected to launch its own oral GLP-1 therapy later in 2026, Novo Nordisk\u2019s deep product pipeline and strong clinical progress support sustained revenue and earnings growth. The stock remains down significantly over the past two years, making it a potentially attractive opportunity for investors to consider buying on the dip.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 11:45 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/31/should-you-buy-novo-nordisk-stock-on-oral-wegovys/)\n\n**Obesity Treatment in Transition: Patent Expirations, Generics, and the Rise of Next-Generation Therapies**\nThe article discusses the upcoming transition in the obesity medication market, focusing on the gradual and geographically uneven entry of generic versions of semaglutide following patent expirations. Adele Romano, a professor at Sapienza University and coordinator of the Italian Society of Pharmacology's Obesity and Metabolic Disorders group, notes that while semaglutide's patent expiration is expected around 2026, the timeline varies globally due to multiple overlapping patents covering the molecule, formulations, delivery devices, therapeutic indications, and production processes. In Brazil, the patent expires in March 2026, and at least four generic applications are under review by Anvisa. In contrast, the U.S. and EU will likely maintain patent protection until the early 2030s, with Italy\u2019s protection extending to March 2031 via a Supplementary Protection Certificate. Romano emphasizes that even where patents expire, market entry is complex due to semaglutide\u2019s peptide nature, high production standards, and the need for robust regulatory submissions and pharmacovigilance. The competitive landscape remains dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, with Eli Lilly advancing with tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) and developing next-generation therapies like Orforglipron (oral GLP-1 agonist) and Retatrutide (triple agonist). Novo Nordisk is also developing CagriSema, a combination of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Pfizer has halted development of danuglipron due to safety concerns. Romano concludes that the 2026 market shift will be driven not by generics but by innovation, clinical evidence on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, and scalable delivery\u2014ushering a transformation in how obesity is viewed as a chronic, systemic disease requiring long-term, effective, and safe treatment.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Lapresse](https://www.lapresse.it/salute/farmaci/2026/01/31/obesita-tra-innovazione-e-brevetti-il-futuro-di-semaglutide-co/)\n\n**Five Turnaround Stocks to Watch in 2026: Novo Nordisk, UnitedHealth, Deckers, Comcast, and Airbnb**\nFive stocks are highlighted as potential turnaround candidates for 2026, all having experienced poor performance in 2025 but implementing strategic measures to exceed investor expectations. These include Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which saw its stock drop over 40% in 2025 due to competition from Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro, but rebounded after FDA approval of its first oral GLP-1 therapy, Wegovy. The stock recently broke above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for the first time in nearly 16 months, with strong MACD momentum signaling a shift in trend. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) faced a nearly 20% drop in one day due to Trump\u2019s Medicare rate freeze proposal, though analysts still project 2026 revenue exceeding $44 billion and EPS above $17.75. The stock had previously broken above its 200-day SMA and is now showing signs of recovery from oversold RSI conditions. Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) reported strong Q3 2026 results, surpassing analyst estimates and raising its annual revenue forecast to $540 million, despite ongoing tariff risks. The stock surged over 14% and is now trading above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs, supported by a low P/E ratio of 14 and a high Benzinga Edge quality score of 91.16. Comcast (NYSE:CMCSA), after a decade of underperformance, is benefiting from a strong broadband foundation and a 4.5% dividend yield with 19 consecutive dividend increases. The stock is approaching a 200-day SMA breakout, supported by positive MACD momentum. Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), which has declined nearly 30% from its IPO peak, is seeing a resurgence through technical and fundamental catalysts, including four analyst upgrades in January, expansion into international markets, a new 'Book Now, Pay Later' service, and the 2026 World Cup. The stock recently formed a golden cross with 50-day SMA acting as new support. All five stocks are positioned for potential recovery in 2026, with strong technical indicators and strategic improvements.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:46 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50285726/2026-5)\n\n**Eli Lilly (LLY) Stock: Surges as $3.5B Pennsylvania Plant Fuels Obesity Drug Expansion**\nEli Lilly (LLY) stock surged more than 2% following the company's announcement of a $3.5 billion manufacturing plant in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania, near Allentown, to expand production of obesity and diabetes treatments. The facility, set to begin operations in 2031, will produce retatrutide\u2014a next-generation GLP-1 drug under late-stage development that targets three hormones, potentially offering enhanced weight-loss outcomes. The project will create 850 full-time jobs and 2,000 construction jobs, boosting economic activity in the Lehigh Valley. The expansion supports Eli Lilly\u2019s broader U.S. manufacturing strategy, which includes four major sites announced under a $27 billion domestic investment plan, with facilities in Texas, Virginia, Alabama, and Indiana currently under development. The move addresses prior supply constraints for GLP-1 therapies and strengthens the company\u2019s market leadership, as it gained majority market share in the obesity drug space last year. Sales of Zepbound and Mounjaro drove quarterly revenue past $17 billion and profit to a record level, with both drugs generating $10 billion each in the period. Eli Lilly also plans to release seven Phase 3 trial readouts in 2026 and aims to launch its own oral obesity drug, orforglipron, later this year, amid competitive pressure from Novo Nordisk\u2019s upcoming pill launch.

Retatrutide demonstrated an average 28.7% body weight loss in a Phase 3 study at 68 weeks among participants with obesity and knee osteoarthritis. This investment is part of Eli Lilly\u2019s broader $50 billion commitment to expand U.S. manufacturing, aimed at securing a domestic supply advantage and avoiding import tariffs. The company\u2019s expanding obesity drug portfolio includes Zepbound (once-weekly injectable), orforglipron (soon-to-be FDA-approved once-daily oral pill with lower efficacy and more side effects), and retatrutide (high-efficacy option for patients needing rapid weight loss). The announcement comes amid broader market movements: the S&P 500 is under pressure on Friday, Apple shares are declining despite strong earnings and 23% year-over-year iPhone sales growth, and enterprise software stocks show signs of stabilization after recent volatility. Upcoming earnings reports include Eli Lilly, Alphabet, Bristol Myers, Linde, and Amazon, while the January non-farm payroll report is scheduled for release Friday before the market open.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:55 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/eli-lilly-looks-to-sharpen-supply-edge-by-building-another-us-plant.html)\n\n**5 Stocks Primed for a Turnaround in 2026**\nThe article identifies five stocks with potential for a turnaround in 2026, highlighting their poor performance in 2025 and recent positive developments. Novo Nordisk (NVO) saw its stock fall over 40% in 2025 due to competition from Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro, and missed revenue estimates, but received FDA approval for the oral GLP-1 treatment Wegovy, leading to a Buy rating from CICC Research with a $73.50 price target (implying over 20% upside). The stock has broken above its 200-day SMA for the first time in nearly 16 months, with bullish MACD momentum. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) experienced a nearly 20% drop after President Trump proposed flat Medicare rates, threatening insurer profits, but still projects $440 billion in 2026 revenue and EPS over $17.75. The stock is oversold but showing signs of stabilization after Q4 2025 earnings. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) surged over 14% after hours following a strong Q3 2026 earnings report that beat expectations, raised full-year revenue guidance to $5.4 billion, and increased margin targets despite ongoing tariff headwinds. The stock now trades above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs and holds a Benzinga Edge Quality score of 91.16. Comcast (CMCSA), stagnant since 2016, has a strong balance sheet, a 4.5% dividend yield, and a 22% payout ratio, with signs of a breakout approaching the 200-day SMA and bullish MACD momentum. Airbnb (ABNB), down nearly 30% from its 2021 IPO peak, received four analyst upgrades in January, with catalysts including international expansion, its new 'Reserve Now Pay Later' service, and the 2026 World Cup. A Golden Cross has formed, and the 50-day SMA may serve as new support. The company reports Q4 2025 earnings on February 12, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:35 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/26/01/50274453/5-stocks-primed-for-a-turnaround-in-2026)\n\n**Shi Yao Group Partners with AstraZeneca to Accelerate Innovation in Long-Acting Peptide Drugs**\nOn January 30, 2026, Stone Medicine Group (Shi Yao Group) and its indirect controlling shareholder Xin Nuowei announced a strategic research and development collaboration and licensing agreement with global biopharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. The partnership focuses on innovative peptide molecule discovery and the development of long-acting delivery products. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will gain exclusive global rights outside China to Stone Medicine's 'once-monthly injectable weight management product portfolio,' including the clinical-ready project SYH2082\u2014a long-acting GLP1R/GIPR agonist currently advancing to Phase I clinical trials\u2014and three preclinical-stage research projects with distinct mechanisms of action. AstraZeneca will pay Stone Medicine a $120 million upfront payment, with potential milestone payments of up to $350 million for R&D and up to $1.38 billion for sales milestones, plus royalty rates of up to double-digit percentages on annual net sales. If all milestones are achieved, the total deal value could reach $18.5 billion. According to Wu Wanying, senior researcher at Tianyi Digital Economy Think Tank, this record-breaking collaboration marks a milestone in Stone Medicine's 'innovation + internationalization' strategy, validating the global competitiveness of its AI-driven drug discovery and sustained-release delivery platforms. The deal signifies a shift from 'product export' to 'platform and technology export' by Chinese pharmaceutical firms, reflecting international recognition of China's growing innovation capacity. The core product, SYH2082, is a long-acting GLP1R/GIPR agonist in the high-growth metabolic disease treatment field. Global GLP-1 drug market revenue exceeds $50 billion, with Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide generating $16.466 billion in 2024 and Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide (Wegovy) $8.448 billion. With rising obesity and diabetes rates, the market has significant expansion potential. Jin Chunlin, director of the Shanghai Center for Health and Development Research, noted that the partnership enables AstraZeneca to rapidly strengthen its pipeline in key therapeutic areas like GLP-1, gaining a strategic advantage in the trillion-dollar metabolic disease market through 'capital-for-time' acquisition. It also deepens AstraZeneca\u2019s innovation network in China, creating a high-quality 'Chinese innovation port' within its global R&D system. Industry analysis confirms that current GLP-1 drugs are typically administered weekly, whereas Stone Medicine\u2019s long-acting technology enables monthly dosing. Hu Qimu, special researcher at the China Enterprise Federation, stated that extending dosing frequency from weekly to monthly represents not only a technological breakthrough but a major commercial value enhancement, directly improving patient adherence and market penetration\u2014explaining AstraZeneca\u2019s high valuation. Jin emphasized that this collaboration marks China\u2019s pharmaceutical industry\u2019s historic transition from 'following' to 'racing alongside' global leaders, shifting from 'licensing-in' to 'licensing-out.' However, challenges remain: the vast majority of the $18.5 billion is contingent on future R&D and sales milestones. The true test lies in whether Stone Medicine\u2019s candidates can successfully complete global Phase III trials and achieve commercial success under AstraZeneca\u2019s global push. This demands international vision, world-class scientific platforms, robust preclinical R&D, and strong business negotiation capabilities. Jin concluded that long-term success requires Chinese innovators to move beyond isolated 'blockbuster deals' toward systemic, sustainable high-quality innovation, driven by long-term development of foundational research, talent, regulatory review, and capital markets to achieve 'ecosystem-level success' rather than isolated product wins.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:25 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202601313637431015.html)\n\n**Drugmaker Eli Lilly announces new plant in Pennsylvania as part of broader domestic expansion**\nEli Lilly and Co., headquartered in Indianapolis, announced plans to build a $3.5 billion manufacturing facility in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania, as part of a broader domestic expansion strategy. The new plant, located just outside Allentown, will produce injectable drugs and devices, including retatrutide\u2014a once-weekly injectable weight-loss drug currently under study and not yet available to the public. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and conclude in 2031. This development is part of a larger expansion that includes new facilities in Texas, Virginia, Alabama, and an ongoing project in Indiana. The company reported record third-quarter profits of $5.58 billion, driven by surging sales of its obesity and diabetes treatments, Zepbound and Mounjaro.

In the latest quarter, these drugs generated over $10 billion in revenue, contributing to double-digit overall revenue growth. The company's leadership in this high-demand sector, supported by strong clinical efficacy and expanded manufacturing capacity, has allowed it to outpace rival Novo Nordisk, which produces Ozempic and Wegovy. Analysts project the global obesity drug market will reach $100 billion by the end of the decade. A key catalyst for 2026 is the potential launch of orforglipron, a weight loss pill that Lilly applied for regulatory review on late in 2025. Clinical trial results have been positive, and the pill offers advantages over Novo\u2019s Wegovy, including no dietary restrictions and greater convenience. The pill is also expected to be cheaper and easier to manufacture than injectables. With anticipated regulatory approval, initial revenue from orforglipron, and sustained demand for existing products, Eli Lilly is positioned for significant growth\u2014leading to the prediction that 2026 will be 'the year of Eli Lilly.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 09:10 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/19/prediction-2026-will-be-the-year-of-eli-lilly/)\n\n**GLP-1 Obesity Drugs Surpass Keytruda in Global Sales, Marking a Paradigm Shift**\nIn 2024, global sales of GLP-1 obesity drugs, including Eli Lilly's 'Mounjaro' and 'Zepbound' (tirzepatide) and Novo Nordisk's 'Wegovy' and 'Ozempic' (semaglutide), reached approximately $358 billion and $356 billion respectively, surpassing the $315 billion in sales of the long-standing top-selling immunotherapy cancer drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) by Merck (MSD). Although Keytruda remains the top-selling single product, the combined sales of GLP-1 obesity drugs now exceed Keytruda's revenue by about 13\u201314%, according to a report by Yujeung Investment Securities citing Bloomberg consensus. The report interprets this shift as a structural signal that the paradigm in treatment for obesity and metabolic diseases is reshaping the blockbuster drug landscape, previously dominated by cancer therapeutics. Sales of GLP-1 drugs are projected to reach around $850 billion in 2024, with Mounjaro expected to generate $450 billion and Wegovy $400 billion. Keytruda\u2019s sales forecast for 2024 is below $350 billion. The report attributes the sustained dominance of obesity drugs to the introduction of oral formulations, such as Novo\u2019s recently FDA-approved Wegovy tablets and Eli Lilly\u2019s pending application for its oral version of tirzepatide, dubbed 'Oral Mounjaro'.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 09:19 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/jp/jp-science/2026/01/08/32S5Q6DLDVFB5ACWGKS7AMHTFI/)\n\n**Prediction: This Surprising Growth Stock Will Reach -- and Stay in -- the Trillion-Dollar Club in 2026.**\nThe article predicts that Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), a healthcare company, will become the first non-technology firm to join the 'trillion-dollar club'\u2014defined as companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion\u2014by 2026. While the club currently includes tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the article highlights Eli Lilly\u2019s recent rise: it briefly touched $1 trillion in market cap in November 2025, becoming the first healthcare company to do so, before falling to approximately $904 billion. The prediction is based on Lilly\u2019s strong growth in the weight loss drug market, driven by its drugs tirzepatide\u2014marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss\u2014which have generated blockbuster revenue. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the global weight loss drug market will grow from $28 billion to $95 billion by 2030 and exceed $100 billion, supporting the forecast. The article emphasizes that while market cap alone does not determine investment value, Lilly\u2019s combination of stable revenue, dividends, and explosive growth in its weight-loss portfolio makes it a likely long-term contender for sustained trillion-dollar status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 10:30 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Despite growing competition from pharmaceutical companies like Novo Nordisk and AbbVie, who are developing oral, monthly, or multi-hormone therapies (e.g., Novo Nordisk\u2019s amycretin and AbbVie\u2019s amylin-based product), Eli Lilly is maintaining its competitive edge. The company recently reported positive phase 2 trial results for eloralintide, an investigational amylin agonist, showing a 20.1% mean body weight reduction at the highest dose after 48 weeks\u2014compared to 0.4% in the placebo group. While this falls short of Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 1b/2a results for amycretin (24.3% weight loss), the comparison remains preliminary due to differing trial stages. Lilly\u2019s financial performance remains strong: tirzepatide surpassed Keytruda as the world\u2019s top-selling drug in Q3 2025, generating $10 billion in sales, with projections of $62 billion in revenue by 2030. Additionally, the company is advancing other promising candidates, including orforglipron (an oral GLP-1 therapy) and retatrutide (a triple agonist), which could further solidify its dominance. Despite a high valuation\u2014trading at 27 times forward earnings, above the healthcare sector average of 17.4\u2014the article argues that Lilly\u2019s sustained innovation and market leadership justify its current price, making it a compelling investment opportunity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 09:22 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/12/this-unstoppable-growth-stock-just-delivered-more/)\n\n**Massive sales for weight loss drugs spur Eli Lilly's Q3**\nEli Lilly reported record-breaking Q3 2025 results, with total revenue surging 54% year-over-year to $17.6 billion\u2014exceeding the Zacks consensus estimate of $16.01 billion by 9.91%. This growth was driven by strong demand for tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). Mounjaro generated $6.5 billion in Q3 2025, a 109% increase from the same quarter in 2024, while Zepbound sales rose 185% to $3.6 billion. Global demand for weight-loss drugs offset lower pricing, contributing to the robust performance. Lilly\u2019s shares closed at $844.50 on October 30, 2025, up 3.6% from the prior day, with a market capitalization of $757 billion. Tirzepatide\u2019s sales have surpassed MSD\u2019s Keytruda, signaling a potential shift in the global pharmaceutical market leadership. In response, Lilly raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $63\u201363.5 billion, up from $62 billion. The results were notable amid CVS Caremark\u2019s announcement to make Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy the preferred GLP-1RA treatment from July 2025. On the same day, Novo Nordisk entered a $9 billion bidding war for Metsera, a move Pfizer criticized as 'reckless'\u2014Pfizer had already agreed to acquire Metsera in September. Metsera is developing longer-acting GLP-1RAs, which Novo aims to integrate into its Ozempic and Wegovy brands. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly plans to submit its oral GLP-1RA candidate, orforglipron, to the FDA for obesity approval in 2025, with a type 2 diabetes application expected in 2026.

The company's rapid growth, driven by the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide\u2014marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight management\u2014has fueled a 32% revenue increase in 2024, with combined sales of the two drugs reaching $16.47 billion. In the first half of 2025, tirzepatide sales surged 121% year over year to $14.7 billion. However, concerns persist over generic and compounding pharmacy competition, though evidence suggests such threats remain limited. Despite strong performance, not all revenue streams are growing: Trulicity, a previously top-selling GLP-1 drug, is losing market share to Mounjaro, and Jardiance\u2019s revenue is declining. Eli Lilly\u2019s second-quarter revenue rose 38% year over year, but analysts at Goldman Sachs have downgraded global anti-obesity drug sales forecasts to $95 billion by 2030 from $130 billion. Tirzepatide\u2019s superior efficacy comes with higher side effects\u2014nausea\u2014making it less tolerable than Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy. The stock trades at 35.8 times forward earnings, a premium valuation justified by a 122% EPS growth over three years. However, the company faces patent cliffs: Trulicity may lose exclusivity in the U.S. by 2027, risking biosimilar competition that could pressure Mounjaro sales. Off-label use could also erode Zepbound\u2019s market. With the GLP-1 market maturing, sustained high growth rates may no longer be sustainable. If tirzepatide\u2019s momentum slows, investors could face significant losses as the stock reverts to typical pharmaceutical industry growth rates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/22/3-things-investors-need-to-know-ahead-of-eli-lilly/)\n\n**These 2 AI Stocks Could Surpass Oracle in Market Cap by 2030**\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) has transformed from a legacy database company into a key player in global AI infrastructure, with a $455 billion contracted backlog as of August 31, 2026, and a market cap exceeding $801 billion as of October 2025. Its cloud infrastructure revenue grew 54% year over year to $3.3 billion in Q1, driven by its AI database and multicloud strategy. However, Oracle missed analyst estimates for revenue and earnings, reported negative free cash flow, and plans $35 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2026, indicating a focus on long-term growth over short-term profits. Its reliance on large contracts, such as the $300 billion deal with OpenAI, exposes it to counterparty risk. Despite its strength, two companies\u2014Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)\u2014are seen as having higher growth potential. Palantir\u2019s revenue rose 48% year over year to $1.03 billion in Q2, with a 46% operating margin and $569 million in adjusted free cash flow. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), built on ontology-based architecture and supported by client boot camps, has accelerated sales and delivered real-world efficiency gains. Government contracts, including a $10 billion, 10-year U.S. Army deal, provide sticky revenue. Palantir\u2019s stock trades at 204.8 times forward earnings, but if it sustains over 30% revenue growth and 40%+ operating margins, it could surpass Oracle\u2019s market cap by 2030. Eli Lilly\u2019s revenue grew 38% to $15.6 billion in Q2, with non-GAAP EPS up 61% to $6.31. Its tirzepatide-based drugs\u2014Mounjaro and Zepbound\u2014generated $5.2 billion and $3.4 billion in revenue, respectively, and the company produced 1.6 times more doses in H1 2025 than in H1 2024. Tirzepatide\u2019s cardiovascular benefits may expand insurance coverage, and its oral candidate orforglipron could drive rapid adoption. With a pipeline including donanemab and retatrutide, and market research forecasting $62 billion in annual tirzepatide revenue by 2030, Eli Lilly could grow revenue at over 20% annually and maintain margins above 40%, potentially surpassing Oracle\u2019s market cap before 2030.
