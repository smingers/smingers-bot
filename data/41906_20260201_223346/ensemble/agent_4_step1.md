Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Chalkbeat 24-Sep-2025 – Factual reportage on a $36 m magnet-school grant cancellation.  Clear separation between news and quotations; reputable local-education outlet.  Provides one data point of a funding action well below the ≥$1 bn threshold.  
• NY Governor press release 04-Jul-2025 – Advocacy document describing statewide impacts of a congressional budget bill.  Useful to show that undifferentiated, nationwide cuts are common, but it is not an NYC-specific executive-branch action; therefore it is background “noise” for this forecast.  
• Fortune 01-Feb-2026 – Straight news on the current partial shutdown; nothing NYC-specific.  Demonstrates that most funding fights are broad rather than city-targeted.  
• 6sqft 14-Jan-2026 – Credible local real-estate site summarising the October 2025 DOT freeze of $18 bn for Gateway/Second Ave.  That episode clearly meets the ≥$1 bn NYC-specific threshold and was initiated by DOT/OMB.  
• CNBC 01-Oct-2025 – Main-stream business press confirming the 6sqft account.  Good corroboration.  
• NYC Comptroller newsletter 01-Nov-2025 – Official city source; mentions threats but no new formal action.  Gives the city’s perspective.  
• Agent report – Collates primary documents (EOs, memos, bills, suspension letters, court filings).  Heavily sourced and dates line up with public records.  It provides the best quantitative count of qualifying actions since 2017.

Factual take-aways (filtered for ≥$1 bn NYC-targeted actions actually initiated):  
1. Jan-2017 EO 13768 (grants)  
2. Jun-2020 WH-requested “Anarchy Act” bill  
3. Sep-2020 “Anarchist Jurisdictions” OMB memo  
4. Feb-2025 EO 14218 (sanctuary reviews)  
5. Sep-2025 DOT/OMB freeze of Gateway & Second Ave money  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Number of NYC-targeted ≥$1 bn funding-reduction processes per Trump-administration year.”  
2. “Number of funding-reduction processes aimed at any single Democratic-leaning city by a hostile presidency.”  
3. “Any large ($≥1 bn) discretionary grant cut initiated by any U.S. administration in a year.”

Class 1 is the narrowest, directly aligned with the question, and has a clean countable history: five qualifying attempts over roughly 5.9 Trump-administration years (Jan-2017–Jan-2021 and Jan-2025–Jan-2026).  This yields an historical mean of 0.85 events per administration-year.  However, the tempo has doubled during the second term (2 attempts in 2025 = 2.0/yr).  Because we care about the next 3 months of the same second term, Class 1B (“second-term rate”) is the most predictive.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining until resolution: 90 days (0.25 yr).  
If the 2025 rate (λ ≈ 2 events/yr) continues, expected events in the interval λΔt = 2 × 0.25 = 0.50.  A Poisson model gives P(≥1 event) = 1 – e^-0.5 ≈ 39%.  
At the longer-run average rate (0.85 yr-¹) the probability would be 18%.  Using the pre-2025 first-term rate (≈0.6 yr-¹) would give only 13%.

(d) Justification  
• Structural factors favourable to another action: Trump has repeatedly used city-specific funding threats as political theatre; New York City remains a favoured foil; 2026 is a mid-term election year and immigration/DEI battles are salient.  
• Pathways: DOT has already threatened to pull highway funds over congestion pricing; HUD reviews under EO 14218 could crystalise into formal suspension letters; DOJ could revive the “anarchist” rubric tied to crime or right-to-shelter litigation.  Any one of these could readily top $1 bn.  
• Counter-factors: 1) Several agencies are already enjoined by courts and may be gun-shy; 2) A partial shutdown and the need to conclude FY-26 appropriations consume administrative bandwidth; 3) The administration may prefer to highlight wins rather than start fresh fights so close to the election.  
• Net: Recent cadence (two major NYC-specific actions in the last twelve months) suggests the machinery and political will exist; but legal risk and crowded agenda reduce odds from a simple straight-line projection.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: Poisson estimate at the observed 2025 rate → 39%.  
Adjustments:  
+3 ppt for election-year incentives and several “live” flash-points (congestion pricing, Gateway compliance deadline 6 Feb).  
–5 ppt for legal setbacks and bandwidth constraints.  
Net outside-view probability ≈ 37%.
