Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. ABC-7 NY (13 Jan 26) – Verbatim remarks by President Trump promising to stop “any payments” to sanctuary cities on 1 Feb.   Quality: local TV affiliate quoting on-camera statements; facts = the quote/date; opinion = none.

2. NPR (17 Jan 26) – Explainer noting the threat, the 1 Feb deadline, and that no written directive has yet appeared. Reviews first-term court defeats.   Quality: national public radio, high factual reliability; opinions confined to quoted officials.

3. Truthout (23 Jan 26) – Leaked OMB memo ordering a funding audit of 14 Democratic-run states (inc. NY). Memo published in full. OMB insists “data-gathering only”.   Quality: partisan outlet but provides the primary document; facts = existence/content of memo; editorial tone = opinion.

4. Spectrum (07 Jan 26) – HHS pause of $10 m child-care money to NY State.   Quality: regional cable news; the pause letter is factual, but the amount is far below $1 B.

5. Government-shutdown news bundle (30 Jan – 1 Feb 26) – Senate/House wrangle over FY-26. Shows White House willing to use funding brinkmanship but contains no NYC-specific directive.   Quality: major outlets (CNN, NY Post, etc.); facts = legislative status.

6. CNBC (01 Oct 25) – DOT/OMB froze ≈$18 B for Gateway + Second Av Subway citing new DBE rule. Freeze letter reproduced.   Quality: mainstream business press; strong evidence of prior ≥$1 B NYC-specific action.

7. Series of Nov 25 articles (Axios, Raw Story, Bluewin, etc.) – Trump threatens to cut NYC funds if Zohran Mamdani elected mayor.   Quality: largely political commentary; threats only, no formal action.

8. NYC Comptroller report (Nov 25) – Catalogues first-term and 2025 attempted cuts; provides budget statistics.   Quality: official city analysis; facts = historic numbers, but tone is advocacy.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)

Strong evidence
• 2017 EO 13768 precedent and Oct 25 DOT/OMB $18 B freeze: establishes that the administration has both the willingness and the bureaucratic know-how to initiate very large NYC-targeted funding actions via EO or agency directive.

Moderate evidence
• 13 Jan and 17 Jan threats with a specific 1 Feb date; historically, Trump often converts a public threat into an EO within days (e.g., EO 13768 was signed two days after the first sanctuary-city speech in 2017).
• The partisan OMB audit (23 Jan 26) signals preparatory groundwork for future cuts aimed at Democratic jurisdictions, NYC included.
• Continuing partial shutdown keeps funding leverage and heightens incentives to issue dramatic executive actions that please the political base.

Weak evidence
• $10 m HHS pause – illustrates pattern but falls far below the $1 B criterion.
• Ongoing litigation deterrent – courts blocked similar moves in 2017-20, but legal defeats do not prevent “initiation”, only implementation.

Net evidence direction: pushes probability upward from the statistical outside view but leaves significant doubt because a formal document has not yet surfaced.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Resolution window left: 90 days (1 Feb 26 → 1 May 26).
• If the window were halved to 45 days, probability drops roughly 7 pts (initiation often happens quickly or not at all).
• If doubled to 180 days, probability rises only ~6 pts because post-budget-deal months typically see fewer splashy unilateral moves.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline (NYC-specific ≥$1 B formal cuts under Trump, recent years) ≈ 33 %.

Adjust upward:
+10 % EO precedent and current, well-publicised 1 Feb threat targeting sanctuary cities (moderate→strong).
+7 % OMB audit setting stage for deeper cuts, shows machinery in motion (moderate).
+4 % Shutdown politics give Trump immediate incentive to brandish an EO (weak→moderate).

Adjust downward:
–4 % Repeated loss in federal courts may deter agencies from writing an over-broad order (moderate).
–2 % Administration already fighting on several funding fronts (Gateway, DHS, shutdown) – bandwidth limits (weak).

Net inside-view probability ≈ 48 %.

Probability calibration
I round to a single-digit percentage to reflect uncertainty: 48 %.

Checklist:
1. Forecast paraphrase: By 1 May 26, will a Trump EO/agency directive/administration bill launch ≥$1 B funding cut aimed at NYC?  
2. Base rate stated: 33 %.  
3. Consistency line: “48 out of 100 times, such a formal NYC funding-cut process would begin in the next 90 days.”  
4. Key evidence: (a) 13 Jan threat + 1 Feb deadline, (b) 2017 EO precedent, (c) Oct 25 $18 B freeze precedent, (d) 23 Jan OMB audit memo, (e) continual shutdown leverage.  
5. Blind-spot: Trump issues only narrow DOJ/ICE grant suspension (<$1 B) yet claims victory; my probability would be too high.  
6. Status-quo pull: no signed document exists as of 1 Feb; inertia favours “No”, warranting caution – hence probability remains <50 %.

Probability: 48%
