You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the Trump administration initiate another process to significantly reduce federal funding to New York City before May 1, 2026?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as "Yes" if the Trump administration initiates a formal process to reduce or withhold federal funds specifically allocated to New York City. The proposed reduction must target a major funding stream or be a proposed cut of at least $1 billion in annual federal funds. The action must be initiated by an executive order, a directive from a federal agency (such as the Office of Management and Budget), or the introduction of legislation at the administration's request. A 'formal process' is distinguished from public statements or threats; it requires a documented, official government action. The question resolves to 'Yes' when the process is initiated, regardless of whether it is successfully implemented or survives any legal challenges. General budget cuts that affect all US cities will not be sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution.

# Summary of Article: Trump Administration Cancels Millions in Grants to NYC Schools Over Transgender Policies

**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Source:** Chalkbeat

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The Trump administration canceled **$36 million** in magnet school grant funding to New York City
- The funding was expected to flow over the next **three fiscal years**, beginning October 1
- The grants came from the U.S. Department of Education's **Magnet School Assistance Program**
- The funding would affect approximately **8,500 students** in underserved communities
- Similar funding was also canceled for school districts in **Chicago and Fairfax, Virginia**

## Timeline:

- **September 16:** Federal officials informed NYC Education Department that funding was in jeopardy
- **September 19:** Initial deadline given to NYC to agree to federal demands or appeal
- **Tuesday (specific date not provided):** Extended deadline that NYC missed, resulting in cancellation
- **September 30:** End of federal fiscal year (cited as reason for tight timeline)

## Reason for Cancellation:

The U.S. Department of Education contended that NYC policies allowing transgender students to participate in sports and use bathrooms/facilities aligned with their gender identity violate **Title IX**, which prohibits sex discrimination at educational institutions receiving federal funding.

## Federal Demands:

The federal government demanded NYC adopt "biology-based definitions for the words 'male' and 'female'"

## Official Statements:

**Federal Department of Education (spokesperson Julie Hartman):**
- Funding was canceled because of policies that "blatantly discriminate against students based on race and sex"
- "Parents have every right to expect an excellent education — not ideological indoctrination masquerading as 'inclusive' policy"

**NYC Education Department (spokesperson Jenna Lyle):**
- Officials are "deeply disappointed" by denial of request for more time
- Funding supports after-school programs, specialized curriculums, and summer learning opportunities
- "If the federal government pulls this funding, that means canceled courses and shrinking enrichment"

**Mayor Adams spokesperson (Kayla Mamelak Altus):**
- Accused federal government of "defunding our children's education" for policy concessions
- "We are reviewing all of our options here — including litigation — to safeguard these important resources"

## Political Context:

- Mayor Eric Adams began criticizing city transgender policies after the funding threat
- NYC policies are rooted in **state law and city guidelines**
- The Trump administration has reportedly considered offering Adams a job (denied by Adams spokesperson)
- The Justice Department earlier pressed federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against Adams

**NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams** suggested Adams was angling for a Trump administration job and stated: "I don't know which is more disgraceful – the Trump administration ripping funding away from students' educations in order to further its own transphobic agenda, or Mayor Adams feeding that bigotry and wishing he could rewrite it into our laws"

## Procedural Issues:

NYC Education Department's top lawyer requested 30 days to consider an appeal and indicated the federal government had "deprived the [city] of the procedures and due process required by federal regulations"

# Article Summary

**Source:** Governor Kathy Hochul's office

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

1. **Timeline:** President Trump signed a GOP budget bill into law on July 4, 2025

2. **Health Care Impacts:**
   - 2 million New Yorkers will lose current health insurance coverage
   - $3+ billion in increased costs for hospitals and providers
   - $8 billion in funding cuts potentially forcing hospital service cuts or closures
   - Nearly $13 billion total impact expected on NY's healthcare system
   - 1.5 million New Yorkers will have health care coverage "ripped away"

3. **SNAP (Food Assistance) Impacts:**
   - 1 in 7 New Yorkers currently rely on SNAP
   - 300,000 New York households will lose benefits
   - $220 per month in lost food assistance for seniors, children, and families

4. **Political Context:**
   - All seven Republican members of Congress representing New York voted for the bill
   - The bill is referred to as the "Big Ugly Bill" by Governor Hochul and others

5. **Other Cuts Mentioned:**
   - Counterterrorism funding cuts affecting mass transit safety
   - Cuts to businesses and clean energy programs through the Department of Energy
   - Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) application period delayed by a month due to federal government shutdown

**Nature of Cuts:**
The article describes these as general budget cuts affecting health care, food assistance, and other programs across New York State, rather than cuts specifically targeting New York City alone. The cuts appear to be part of a broader federal budget bill affecting New Yorkers statewide.

**Note:** This article focuses on statewide impacts rather than NYC-specific funding cuts, and describes cuts enacted through Congressional budget legislation rather than executive action.

# Summary of Article: "Partial government shutdown will extend into the week as House Speaker Johnson says it will be a few days before vote on funding"

**Source:** Fortune  
**Author:** Lisa Mascaro

## Key Facts and Developments:

### Government Shutdown Status:
- A partial federal shutdown is ongoing and will extend into the week
- Multiple federal agencies are affected, including Defense, health, transportation, and housing
- Workers could go without pay or be furloughed if the impasse continues
- This is the second shutdown in recent months related to congressional funding disputes

### Current Funding Dispute:
- The dispute centers on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations
- President Trump struck a deal with senators to separate DHS funding from a broader package
- The Senate approved a measure Friday to fund DHS temporarily for two weeks
- House Speaker Mike Johnson said a vote won't occur for a few days (at least Tuesday)

### Context for Dispute:
- Public outrage followed two shooting deaths during protests in Minneapolis against ICE
- Democrats are demanding restrictions on ICE operations beyond what's currently in the bill

### Democratic Demands:
- The bill already includes $20 million for body cameras
- Democrats want additional requirements:
  - Federal immigration agents must unmask and identify themselves
  - End to roving patrols
  - Judicial warrants required before agents enter homes or remove people from cars

### Statements from Officials:

**House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.):**
- "The president is leading this"
- Trump has "already conceded that he wants to turn down the volume" on federal immigration operations
- Body cameras and ending roving patrols are areas of potential agreement
- Opposes removing masks/identifying agents by name, citing safety concerns (agents being targeted, personal information posted online)
- "I don't think the president would approve it — and he shouldn't"

**House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.):**
- "What is clear is that the Department of Homeland Security needs to be dramatically reformed"
- Administration needs to begin negotiations now, not over the next two weeks
- "Masks should come off"
- Judicial warrants should be required "consistent with the Constitution"

**Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.):**
- "What is happening in Minnesota right now is a dystopia"
- "ICE is making this country less safe, not more safe today"
- "Our focus over the next two weeks has to be reining in a lawless and immoral immigration agency"

### Additional Context:
- Growing numbers of lawmakers are calling for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired or impeached
- Previous shutdown reference: Last fall, Democrats sparked a 43-day shutdown (longest in history) over ACA tax credit issues

**Relevance to forecasting question:** This article discusses a government shutdown related to DHS/ICE funding but does not mention New York City-specific federal funding or any formal process to reduce funding specifically to NYC. The shutdown affects federal agencies broadly, not targeted funding to particular cities.

- Characterized the projects as "arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere"
- Indicated the review will take longer due to the government shutdown and furloughed civil rights staff
- Blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the shutdown

**New York Gov. Kathy Hochul:**

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a chronological list (2017-2026) of every documented executive order, OMB directive, DOJ or DOT action, or administration-requested bill that sought to reduce or withhold at least $1 billion in federal funds specifically from New York City, including dates, amount, mechanism used, and eventual outcome.
Below is a revised, fully-sourced chronology of every federal action we have been able to document (calendar-year 2017 through 31 January 2026) that simultaneously  (a) originated with the President, OMB, DOJ or DOT, or took the form of a bill publicly requested by an Administration; and  (b) affirmatively sought to cancel, suspend or block at least $1 billion that would otherwise have flowed to New York City.  Each entry lists the date of the first operative document, the New York City dollars placed at risk, the legal/administrative mechanism invoked, and the latest known disposition.  Where new reporting clarifies or updates earlier figures, those changes are noted.

2017  
1. 25 Jan 2017 – Executive Order 13768 “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.”  
  • NYC exposure: then-Comptroller Scott Stringer estimated the City could forfeit “more than $7 billion a year” in discretionary grants if designated a sanctuary jurisdiction.  
  • Mechanism: directed DOJ & DHS to deem sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for most federal grants.  
  • Outcome: nationwide permanent injunction (San Francisco v. Trump, N.D.Cal., 20 Nov 2017); no NYC funds were actually withheld.  (Order text at Federal Register; comptroller estimate reproduced in NYC Comptroller report).

2020  
2. 30 Jun 2020 – draft bill S.4066 “Ending Taxpayer Funding of Anarchy Act,” introduced at the White House’s request.  
  • Exposure: would have allowed DOJ to strip “anarchist jurisdictions” (explicitly including NYC) of all federal “financial assistance,” >$7 billion annually.  
  • Mechanism: statutory bar embedded in appropriations riders.  
  • Outcome: referred to Senate Homeland Security Committee and never reported out; died at sine die adjournment (Clarksville Online, 7 Jul 2020).

3. 2 Sep 2020 – Presidential Memorandum on “Reviewing Funding to State and Local Governments that Permit Anarchy.”  
  • Exposure: ordered OMB to compile “all Federal funds” to NYC; baseline >$7 billion/yr.  
  • Mechanism: OMB guidance + DOJ designation of “anarchist jurisdictions” (designation issued 21 Sept 2020).  
  • Outcome: memo revoked by Executive Order 13985 on 20 Jan 2021; no NYC-specific dollars were ever frozen (City & State NY, 24 Sep 2020).

2025  
4. 19 Feb 2025 – Executive Order 14218 “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.”  
  • Exposure: HUD, DOT, HHS and other programs that collectively send ≈$9 billion/yr to NYC placed under mandatory review for potential suspension.  
  • Mechanism: directed all agencies and OMB to identify payments “abetting sanctuary policies” and recommend cancellations.  
  • Outcome: on 24 Apr 2025 and 22 Aug 2025, N.D.Cal. judges issued preliminary injunctions barring immediate withholding; as of 31 Jan 2026 no NYC-specific grant terminations have been announced (Immigration Policy Tracking database).

5. 20 Jan 2025 – same-day Department of Transportation implementation of a companion Day-1 EO on “Ending Illegal DEI Programs.”  
  • Exposure: DOT and OMB froze two sets of Capital Investment Grant (CIG) payments:  
    a. Gateway Hudson River Tunnel – $16 billion of remaining federal grant and loan support (ENR, 27 Jan 2026);  
    b. Second Avenue Subway Phase 2 – $2 billion remaining federal share plus a $300 million reimbursement invoice already submitted by MTA (NPR, 2 Oct 2025).  
  • Mechanism: interim final rule prohibiting “race- and sex-based contracting preferences,” followed by 30 Sep 2025 suspension letters issued under 2 C.F.R. §200.  
  • Outcome:  funding for both projects remains frozen; Gateway contractors warned of full shutdown by 6 Feb 2026 and litigation is imminent (ENR, 27 Jan 2026; Yahoo Finance, 29 Jan 2026).

6. 21 Apr 2025 (and reiterations 4 Nov 2025 & 6 Jan 2026) – Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threat to withhold Federal Highway Administration aid unless NYC ends congestion-pricing tolls.  
  • Exposure: State officials say $2–3 billion in formula and discretionary highway dollars for NYC projects could be targeted (New York Post, 21 Apr 2025).  
  • Mechanism: warning letters invoking 23 U.S.C. §106(k) and FHWA tolling authority; no formal suspension notices yet.  
  • Outcome: still a contingent threat; tolls remain in place and FHWA has not frozen funds (Gothamist, 21 Apr 2025).  Because no dollar figure is in a binding document, this episode is tracked but not counted among “confirmed” ≥$1 billion cuts.

Unverified / still-research items  
• 1 Oct 2025 – DOE termination of $7.56 billion in clean-energy grants across 16 states (Energy.gov, 15 Oct 2025; NPR, 2 Oct 2025).  OMB Director Vought listed New York among affected states, but DOE has not released project-level data.  Environmental groups estimate the New York State hit at ≈$900 million, leaving it unclear whether projects physically inside New York City exceed the $1 billion threshold.  Until DOE publishes the terminated-award list or FOIA requests succeed, this cannot be confirmed as an NYC-specific ≥$1 billion cut.

Current count of fully documented ≥$1 billion NYC-targeted attempts (2017-Jan 2026)  
1. 25 Jan 2017 – EO 13768 sanctuary-city grants (≥$7 B/yr) – enjoined  
2. 30 Jun 2020 – “Anarchy Act” bill (≥$7 B/yr) – died in committee  
3. 2 Sep 2020 – “Anarchist Jurisdictions” memo (≥$7 B/yr) – rescinded Jan 2021  
4. 19 Feb 2025 – EO 14218 reviews (≥$9 B/yr) – cuts blocked, reviews ongoing  
5. 30 Sep 2025 – DOT/OMB freeze of Gateway & Second Ave Subway funds ($18 B capital + $0.3 B reimbursement) – still frozen

Information gaps that remain  

1. Exact New York City share of the 1 Oct 2025 DOE clean-energy terminations.  Neither DOE’s 15 Oct 2025 press release nor contemporaneous press coverage supply project-location tables.  A FOIA request or forthcoming litigation filings may be required.  
2. Whether any agency, acting under EO 14218, has issued NYC-specific suspension letters beyond the transit grants already identified (HUD, HHS, DOJ grant programs, etc.).  No such letters have surfaced in PACER or via trade associations as of 31 Jan 2026.  
3. Status of the DOT/OMB freezes after FY 2026 appropriations negotiations: whether any partial reimbursements for Gateway or Second Avenue have been processed since October 2025.  
4. A definitive, documented dollar figure for FHWA funds DOT threatens to withhold over congestion pricing.  The Secretary’s letters do not name an amount, and no formal notice of suspension has been published in the Federal Register.

At present, the five actions listed above constitute the complete, verifiable record of ≥$1 billion federal attempts to withhold funds specifically from New York City between 2017 and January 2026.  The four information gaps identified are the only areas where additional primary-source documents could alter that conclusion.</Agent_report>
