    "description": "Following the 2025 New York City mayoral election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, President Donald Trump has already withheld approximately $18 billion in federal transit funding. President Trump, who previously labeled Mamdani a \"communist\" and threatened funding cuts, now faces an inflamed ideological battle as Mayor Mamdani immediately revoked policies related to federal immigration cooperation in January 2026.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"91e2cb489763fc85\",\"sheet_id\":91}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as \"Yes\" if the Trump administration initiates a formal process to reduce or withhold federal funds specifically allocated to New York City. The proposed reduction must target a major funding stream or be a proposed cut of at least $1 billion in annual federal funds. The action must be initiated by an executive order, a directive from a federal agency (such as the Office of Management and Budget), or the introduction of legislation at the administration's request. A 'formal process' is distinguished from public statements or threats; it requires a documented, official government action. The question resolves to 'Yes' when the process is initiated, regardless of whether it is successfully implemented or survives any legal challenges. General budget cuts that affect all US cities will not be sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "fine_print": "The previously (reported)[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/trump-new-york-funding-infrastructure-vought.html] withholding of transport funding in October 2025 would have been sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution.",
