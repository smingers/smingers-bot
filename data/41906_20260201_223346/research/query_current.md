Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether the Trump administration will launch another formal attempt to cut at least $1 billion from New York City (NYC) before 1 May 2026 is evidence that:  
1) senior White House or agency officials are drafting, circulating, or filing a new executive order (EO), OMB directive, or administration-requested bill that specifically targets NYC;  
2) the proposed cut is large (≥ $1 billion) and directed only or primarily at NYC, not at all U.S. cities;  
3) the action has progressed beyond rhetoric—e.g., an EO entered in the Federal Register, an OMB rescission package formally sent to Congress, or draft legislation transmitted by the White House.  

Therefore, the most relevant current articles would cover:
• Any leaked or announced EO or OMB guidance aimed at sanctuary-city non-cooperation.  
• Capitol Hill reporting on a Trump-requested rescission or supplemental appropriations bill clawing back NYC-specific funds (transit, housing, public safety, etc.).  
• Statements or internal memos from DOT, HUD, DOJ, or DHS referencing a new funding suspension.  
• Reactions from NYC officials indicating receipt of formal federal notices.
