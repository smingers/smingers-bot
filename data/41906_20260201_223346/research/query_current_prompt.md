You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the Trump administration initiate another process to significantly reduce federal funding to New York City before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Following the 2025 New York City mayoral election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, President Donald Trump has already withheld approximately $18 billion in federal transit funding. President Trump, who previously labeled Mamdani a "communist" and threatened funding cuts, now faces an inflamed ideological battle as Mayor Mamdani immediately revoked policies related to federal immigration cooperation in January 2026.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as "Yes" if the Trump administration initiates a formal process to reduce or withhold federal funds specifically allocated to New York City. The proposed reduction must target a major funding stream or be a proposed cut of at least $1 billion in annual federal funds. The action must be initiated by an executive order, a directive from a federal agency (such as the Office of Management and Budget), or the introduction of legislation at the administration's request. A 'formal process' is distinguished from public statements or threats; it requires a documented, official government action. The question resolves to 'Yes' when the process is initiated, regardless of whether it is successfully implemented or survives any legal challenges. General budget cuts that affect all US cities will not be sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.
