You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the Trump administration initiate another process to significantly reduce federal funding to New York City before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Following the 2025 New York City mayoral election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, President Donald Trump has already withheld approximately $18 billion in federal transit funding. President Trump, who previously labeled Mamdani a "communist" and threatened funding cuts, now faces an inflamed ideological battle as Mayor Mamdani immediately revoked policies related to federal immigration cooperation in January 2026.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as "Yes" if the Trump administration initiates a formal process to reduce or withhold federal funds specifically allocated to New York City. The proposed reduction must target a major funding stream or be a proposed cut of at least $1 billion in annual federal funds. The action must be initiated by an executive order, a directive from a federal agency (such as the Office of Management and Budget), or the introduction of legislation at the administration's request. A 'formal process' is distinguished from public statements or threats; it requires a documented, official government action. The question resolves to 'Yes' when the process is initiated, regardless of whether it is successfully implemented or survives any legal challenges. General budget cuts that affect all US cities will not be sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
