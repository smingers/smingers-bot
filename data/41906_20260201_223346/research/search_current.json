We will always defend New Yorkers, even in the face of federal threats to withhold funding.\"\n- At a Tuesday night news conference, Mamdani stated he **reached out to President Trump** to express \"sharp opposition\" to the decision but **had not yet heard back**.\n- When asked about plans if funds were withheld, Mamdani said: \"There are many threats that are made to New York City on a regular basis, and I am confident in our city's ability to fight those threats back. And we've also seen whether it be in the courts or whether it be beyond that our ability to win those fights.\"\n\n### New York State Response:\n- **A spokesperson for Governor Kathy Hochul** said: \"New York will work with the federal government to go after dangerous criminals but we will not support their aggressive attacks on hardworking families. If the Trump Administration tries to go after the funding New Yorkers rely on, we'll see them in court.\"\n- Governor Hochul stated in her State of the State Address that she'd support allowing New Yorkers to sue federal agents if their constitutional rights are violated.\n- Hochul stopped short of including the 'New York For All Act' which would prevent local officials from working with ICE.\n\n**Note:** This article reports on a presidential announcement regarding sanctuary city funding but does not specify whether a formal process (executive order, agency directive, or legislation) has been initiated beyond the verbal statement.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/17/nx-s1-5679562/trump-sanctuary-cities-ice-immigration\">\n# Summary of NPR Article: \"Trump is threatening to cut funding from sanctuary cities. Here's what to know\"\n\n**Date:** January 17, 2026  \n**Author:** Joel Rose  \n**Source:** NPR\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n### Current Threats and Actions:\n- President Trump threatened this week to cut \"significant\" federal funding to sanctuary cities\n- Trump has given a deadline of **February 1** but has not specified exactly what money will be cut or which cities will be targeted\n- The Department of Justice published a list of more than 30 cities, states and counties in August (includes Minnesota state, though not Minneapolis or St. Paul specifically)\n- The administration has already surged federal agents (sometimes with military troops) to Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Charlotte, Memphis, Washington D.C., and New Orleans\n\n### Legal Precedent from Trump's First Term:\n- Trump attempted similar funding cuts during his first term\n- Courts have sided against the administration in nearly every case, ruling that the federal government cannot use funding to coerce state and local governments into changing immigration policies\n- In April (2025), U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 jurisdictions (including San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and New Haven)\n- Judge Orrick stated the threat causes \"irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust\"\n\n### Trump's Stated Rationale:\n- In remarks on Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump focused on places that limit cooperation with ICE, saying: \"They do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens...So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities\"\n\n### State/Local Response:\n- **New York Governor Kathy Hochul** (quoted): \"This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission. And that is something we'll never do. You touch any more money from the state of New York, we'll see you in court.\"\n- Democratic leaders are not backing down after Trump's threats\n- State and city leaders argue sanctuary policies have a public safety rationale: working with ICE would undermine trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities\n\n### Context on Sanctuary Cities:\n- No exact legal definition exists, but broadly refers to cities, states or counties that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities\n- Courts have ruled local law enforcement cannot block federal agents but can withhold some cooperation\n- Many jurisdictions won't honor ICE \"detainer requests\" asking police to hold someone until immigration authorities can take custody\n\n### White House Perspective:\n- Claims lack of local cooperation hinders efforts to build \"the largest deportation operation in the history of our country\"\n- White House statement on Friday: \"Minnesota's 'leaders' have chosen defiance over partnership\"\n\n### Democratic Perspective (less reliable source - article's characterization):\n- Democrats say the administration is deliberately creating confrontations in cities and states led by political opponents, provoking chaotic scenes for reasons beyond simply enforcing immigration law\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2026/01/07/trump-child-care-funding-frozen-\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Child care takes center stage in Albany amid talk of freeze\"\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Federal Funding Pause:**\n- The Trump Administration's Department of Health and Human Services announced a pause on $10 million in social services funding to several Democrat-led states, including New York\n- This pause includes key funding for child care programs\n- As of early Tuesday evening, Gov. Kathy Hochul's office had not received official notice or guidance from federal officials\n\n**Child Care Assistance Program Context:**\n- The Child Care Assistance Program is New York's primary vehicle for assisting low-income families in accessing care\n- The program is valued at $2.2 billion in New York state\n- Nearly half of that funding (approximately $1.1 billion) comes from the federal government\n- Last year, the program experienced a spike in enrollment due to new eligibility standards, which funding levels did not adequately support\n- Counties struggled with being forced to close enrollment and establish waitlists for much of the year\n\n## Opinions from Named Sources:\n\n**Andrew Nixon (HHS spokesperson):**\n- Characterized the pause as oversight\n- Stated: \"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch\"\n- Claimed the administration is \"ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes\"\n\n**Gov. Kathy Hochul:**\n- Called it \"a frontal assault on children in this nation from this administration\"\n- Described the action as \"vindictive\"\n- Promised to take the fight to court if the pause officially moves forward\n- Has long resisted increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners but hasn't ruled out other means like increasing corporate tax rates\n\n**Dede Hill (Vice President of Policy, Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy):**\n- Said it's too soon to tell if the pause will have a long-term impact on the state budget\n- Noted this isn't the first time the Trump Administration has suddenly dropped funding freezes, and several have been rescinded or quickly resolved\n- Emphasized the situation should be taken seriously and funding \"needs to flow without delay\"\n\n**Assemblymember Sarah Clark:**\n- Called the pause \"purely vindictive\" and contrary to how the federal government should operate\n- Expressed hope that Hochul will unveil a budget proposal taking meaningful steps toward universal child care\n- Stressed the need for proportionate funding between New York City and upstate regions\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article describes a federal funding pause affecting New York state (not specifically New York City) involving $10 million in social services funding for child care programs. This does not appear to meet the resolution criteria for the forecasting question, as:\n1. The pause targets New York state, not specifically New York City\n2. The amount ($10 million) is far below the $1 billion threshold specified\n3. The funding stream affected (child care programs) is not explicitly identified as a \"major funding stream\" to NYC specifically\n\nHowever, it does demonstrate the Trump Administration's willingness to pause federal funding to Democrat-led jurisdictions in New York.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://truthout.org/articles/white-house-orders-federal-funding-probe-focused-almost-entirely-on-dem-states/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"White House Orders Federal Funding Probe Focused Almost Entirely on Dem States\"\n\n**Source:** Truthout  \n**Date:** January 23, 2026  \n**Author:** Chris Walker\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**OMB Review Announcement:**\n- The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has ordered an administration-wide review of federal funding for over a dozen states\n- States under review: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, and Washington D.C. - all led by Democratic governors\n- Only one Republican-led state included: Vermont (which has a Democratic-controlled state legislature that controls spending)\n\n**Stated Purpose:**\n- The review is ostensibly aimed at rooting out \"fraud\" in these states\n- According to the memo, the review aims \"to collect a detailed spending report on Federal funds\" and \"be used to better understand the scope of funding in certain States and localities in order to facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds through administrative means or legislative proposals to Congress\"\n- The review will likely target supposed misuse of federal funds by immigrants in particular\n- States must respond by the end of January 2026\n\n**Official Statements:**\n- OMB spokesperson: \"We are moving forward with taking fraud seriously\"\n- The memo states: \"This is a data-gathering exercise only.

Johnson stated in an interview on February 1 that the Republican-led House is confident it can pass the 2026 fiscal year budget bill by Tuesday, February 3, despite challenges posed by a widespread snowstorm that has hindered lawmakers' travel. The shutdown began on January 31, 2026, at 12:01 a.m. EST, affecting all federal agencies except the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which handles immigration enforcement. The House passed a $120 billion budget bill on January 22, 2026, funding six departments: Defense, Labor, Health, Education, DHS, and Housing and Urban Development. However, the Senate passed a revised version of the bill on January 30, 2026, which the House could not act on before its recess. The Senate's version included a two-week temporary funding measure for DHS while negotiations on immigration policy reforms continue. Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York), demand DHS reforms such as mandatory body cameras, banning face masks, requiring identification badges, and prohibiting warrantless arrests. Johnson rejected these measures, calling them 'two conditions that would create more danger' and stating they are unlikely to be approved by the President. The House, with 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats, can pass the budget bill unilaterally if no Republicans defect. The agreement allows all federal agencies except DHS to be funded through September 30, 2026, while DHS reform negotiations proceed.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:32 PM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202602020548196322)\n\n**A legal battle with Trump isn't only option to prevent Gateway Tunnel construction shutdown**\nThe $16 billion Gateway Tunnel project faces a potential shutdown due to the Trump administration's suspension of federal reimbursement payments, despite $4.38 billion in funds having been obligated by the federal government in 2024. The freeze, initiated on October 1, 2024, stems from a new rule finalized less than 24 hours earlier, which prohibits race- and gender-based considerations in Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) contracts. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has not responded to Gateway officials' compliance efforts since December 2024, and questions about the review have been referred to the White House press office. U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5th Dist., is pursuing a legislative solution and negotiating with the White House to avoid a shutdown, emphasizing that the obligated funds are legally binding. Legal action through the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act is an option, but experts like Jeff Davis of the Eno Center for Transportation warn it could take months and delay critical construction, including the start of tunnel boring in North Bergen. New Jersey and New York officials argue they have a strong legal basis due to Biden-era DBE policies during grant negotiations, which may protect them under the 'reliance' doctrine. However, the White House, via spokesperson Kush Desai, claims Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, are blocking a deal by refusing to negotiate on full DHS funding in exchange for Gateway funding. The New Jersey and New York congressional delegation has urged the administration to release the obligated funds without linking them to DHS funding. The political stakes are high, particularly in key districts like those of U.S. Reps. Tom Kean and Mike Lawler, which rely heavily on the rail infrastructure Gateway aims to improve. Despite the legal and political hurdles, Gottheimer advocates for a negotiated resolution to avoid prolonged delays and project disruption.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/news/2026/02/a-legal-battle-with-trump-isnt-only-option-to-prevent-gateway-tunnel-construction-shutdown.html)\n\n**Mammadani Says Wall Street Prosperity Can't Solve NYC's Fiscal Crisis**\nNew York City Mayor Mammadani warns that the city faces a fiscal crisis more severe than any in the past twenty years, despite strong performance in Wall Street and record-breaking profits and bonuses in the financial sector. While Wall Street\u2019s success has helped address approximately $12 billion in fiscal deficits, Mammadani emphasizes that this short-term revenue is insufficient to cover a projected $12.6 billion budget gap over the next two years. City data shows that the financial industry contributed about 7% of total tax revenue in the 2024 fiscal year, and the combined trading income of the five largest U.S. banks reached $134 billion in 2025, a historical high. However, Mammadani stresses that the $12.6 billion deficit reflects deep structural issues, including long-term spending pressures and institutional imbalances, not merely cyclical economic fluctuations. He attributes the crisis to decisions made by previous city and state administrations, specifically naming former Mayor Adams and former Governor Cuomo, both of whom deny the accusations and claim they implemented corrective measures. To close the gap, Mammadani is urging Albany lawmakers and Governor Hochul to support increased taxes on the wealthiest residents and large corporations, as well as additional state aid of several billion dollars. He insists that a 'multi-pronged' strategy is necessary and states that 'the relationship between this city and its wealthiest residents and corporations must change.' Governor Hochul has repeatedly opposed tax increases, stating she 'will not raise taxes for the sake of raising taxes,' though she commits to close collaboration during budget negotiations. State budget officials note that while state tax revenues are $17 billion higher than expected this year, reserves must still be maintained for potential economic slowdowns and federal funding cuts. Mammadani counters that the state has the capacity to both save and support the city. Additionally, Mammadani opposes President Trump\u2019s threat to revoke federal funding for sanctuary cities on February 1, calling such a move 'devastating' for New York, and vows to defend the city\u2019s interests vigorously.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/1/31/n14688045.htm)\n\n**Senate Passes Trump-Backed Funding Bill, Pressures House to End Government Shutdown**\nThe U.S. Senate passed a temporary funding bill backed by former President Donald Trump, averting a government shutdown. The legislation funds the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks, allowing time for long-term negotiations on federal immigration policy. Although a partial government shutdown is expected to begin at midnight, leaders from both parties believe the final bill will reach President Trump's desk early next week, preventing significant disruption to federal workers. The Senate approved the measure just hours before the funding deadline, but the House of Representatives is not expected to return to Washington until Monday, meaning final approval remains uncertain. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tight Republican majority, with some hardline members opposing the two-week extension demanded by Senate Democrats. To pass the bill, Republican leadership may need Democratic support, which would fund the remaining three-quarters of federal agencies\u2014prioritizing the Pentagon, air traffic control, and federal health research\u2014through September 30. The agreement slightly reduces overall congressional spending but largely rejects Trump\u2019s more drastic budget cuts. Democrats secured protections for programs like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Pell Grants, though funding for international aid remains reduced following the closure of USAID last year. The bill also includes Trump priorities such as military pay raises and new investments in aviation security and FAA staffing. Crucially, Democrats won provisions known as 'safety barriers' that require the White House to follow congressional spending directives, preventing unilateral fund transfers between departments\u2014ending a practice under Trump\u2019s administration. The bill includes a detailed spending breakdown, replacing the usual non-binding language sent to the White House. Republican leaders struggled to maintain party unity, with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina objecting to the DHS section and attempting to insert language allowing senators to sue the Department of Justice over phone record seizures during the Biden administration. The Senate later removed this controversial provision after it was included in a bill that ended the historic November shutdown. Graham condemned the decision in an emotional Senate speech: 'He blocked me, Speaker Johnson. I won\u2019t forget it.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:23 AM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/01/30/eeuu/senado-proyecto-ley-financiamiento-trump-fin-al-cierre-trax)\n\n**U.S. Senate Approves Funding Bill for Most of Government**\nThe United States Senate passed, by a majority vote, a funding package comprising six bills that finance most of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. According to The New York Times, the legislation secures funding for key government agencies; however, the Department of the Interior will receive funding only through February 13, 2026, due to ongoing negotiations between President Donald Trump's administration and the Democratic Party. The Democrats are advocating for reduced funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leaving the department\u2019s operations unfunded beyond February 13.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:12 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8397602)\n\n**U.S. Senate Approves Temporary Budget Package \u2013 Last Minute Update**\nThe United States Senate approved a temporary budget package on January 31, 2026, just hours before the expiration of the current funding deadline at 12:00 a.m. local time on January 30. The package included funding for the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education, extending through the end of September, and a two-week temporary funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security. The proposal passed the Senate by a vote of 71 to 29. Due to amendments made during the Senate vote, the package must now be sent back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. If approved by the House, it will be forwarded to President Donald Trump for signature. The House is not expected to reconvene until Monday, meaning a short-term partial government shutdown is anticipated. However, the shutdown is expected to be brief and will not significantly impact most federal services. The Democratic Party had insisted on removing the Department of Homeland Security funding from the package and demanded reforms within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following controversial incidents in Minneapolis: the January 7 killing of a U.S. citizen woman during an ICE operation and the January 24 shooting of a man during an attempted arrest. A bipartisan agreement led to the removal of DHS funding from the main package and the inclusion of a separate two-week temporary funding provision.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:34 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-abd-senatosu-ndan-gecici-butce-onayi-19521215/)\n\n**Senate passes $1.2 trillion spending bill  --  but partial government...**\nThe U.S. Senate passed a $1.2 trillion spending bill on Friday, funding 78% of the federal government through September 30, 2026, but a partial government shutdown is expected to begin at midnight Saturday due to the House being in recess until Monday. The bill passed 71-29, separating Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding from a six-bill 'minibus' package. DHS will receive only two weeks of funding while Congress negotiates restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) practices. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) demanded provisions including 'masks off, body cameras on' for ICE agents, stricter warrant rules, a unilateral code of conduct, and an end to roving patrols. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) opposed the deal, claiming he was excluded from negotiations and demanding a seat at the table for future discussions. President Trump urged Congress to pass a bipartisan 'YES' vote to avoid another shutdown, warning that prolonged shutdowns could slow the country. The shutdown will impact agencies such as the Pentagon, Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and State, while others like Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Interior, Energy, Justice, and Commerce remain fully funded. This follows a record 43-day shutdown in the previous fall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:05 AM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/01/30/us-news/senate-passes-1-2-trillion-spending-bill-but-partial-shutdown-appears-inevitable/)\n\n**Senate Passes Government Funding As Talks Over ICE Continue**\nThe U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan spending package on January 30, 2026, temporarily extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while negotiations continue over restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The agreement, negotiated between Democratic leadership and President Donald Trump, allows Congress two additional weeks to finalize reforms to ICE and CBP following two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minnesota. While most federal departments\u2014including Labor, Health and Human Services, State, Education, Transportation, Defense, and Housing and Urban Development\u2014will be fully funded until September, a temporary funding lapse is expected to persist into early next week due to the need for House approval, which is anticipated on Monday. The House vote will follow a delay caused by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who objected to a provision blocking his ability to sue over the federal collection of his phone records during the Jan. 6 investigation; he relented after assurances that a vote on his 'sanctuary city' immigration legislation would be scheduled. Democrats are pushing for reforms such as mandatory body cameras, the elimination of masked agents, an end to roving immigration patrols, a universal code of conduct, and stricter warrant rules for home entries. Republicans support some measures, like body cameras, but oppose others, particularly those targeting sanctuary cities. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) condemned ICE, stating, 'ICE is killing people in cold blood, shooting them in the back,' and cited public outrage as a driver of reform momentum. Meanwhile, the Trump administration, responding to declining public support for its immigration policies and concerns over Republican electoral losses, has signaled a de-escalation in Minnesota. Tom Homan, the president\u2019s border czar, announced plans to 'draw down' federal officers in the state, stating, 'No agency organization is perfect but President Trump and I, along with others in the administration, have recognized that certain improvements could and should be made.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:47 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/senate-passes-government-funding-talks-234740971.html)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown Risk Rises as Senate Begins Voting on Funding Agreement**\nThe risk of a U.S. federal government shutdown has risen again as the Senate began the voting process on a funding agreement. The government could face at least a brief partial shutdown starting at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Saturday, January 31, 2026 (1:01 p.m. Taiwan time). The key to advancing the vote was South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s decision on Friday, January 30, to lift his procedural blockade of the bill, following a commitment from Senate Majority Leader John Thune. The Senate will first vote on a series of amendments before proceeding to the final vote. However, a brief shutdown remains likely because the House of Representatives is not expected to reconvene until Monday, February 3, 2026. For the bill to take effect, it must pass both chambers and be signed by President Trump. The agreement temporarily excludes long-term funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), opting instead for temporary appropriations to keep it running, while the other five funding bills provide funding for other federal agencies. DHS\u2019s long-term budget will be addressed later. Graham stated he was persuaded by Thune\u2019s promises to advance legislation on 'sanctuary city' policies and to hold discussions on the 'Arctic Frost' investigation. He subsequently announced his support for the funding package. President Trump has publicly urged Congress to support the agreement to ensure most federal agencies continue operating through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 09:48 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6328054)\n\n**U.S. Senate Reaches Agreement on Funding Bill, Avoiding Government Shutdown**\nOn Friday, January 30, 2026, the U.S. Senate reached a bipartisan agreement to advance a funding bill and avoid a government shutdown. As part of the agreement, the Senate will vote on seven amendments to a comprehensive appropriations bill. Following that, the Senate will conduct a final vote on the full package, which will keep multiple federal agencies operational through the remainder of fiscal year 2026 and provide two weeks of funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This temporary funding aims to give lawmakers additional time to negotiate constraints on President Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda. The House of Representatives is expected to begin reviewing the bill as early as next Monday. However, because federal budget funds expire at midnight on Friday, January 30, 2026, some government agencies will remain shut down over the weekend.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 09:40 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/1/30/n14687863.htm)\n\n**W.Post: Government Buys Large Warehouses for ICE Centers in 23 Communities**\nThe Trump administration is significantly expanding its network of immigrant detention centers by acquiring and retrofitting large industrial warehouses in at least 23 U.S. communities, prompting serious concerns among local officials and residents. According to The Washington Post, citing documents and interviews, these facilities\u2014located in at least eight states\u2014could collectively hold up to 80,000 people. In January 2026 alone, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) purchased two buildings: one in Williamstown, Maryland, for $102 million, and another in Surprise, Arizona, for $70 million. The selected sites are mostly hangars in industrial zones, often near airports or major highways. The project faces logistical and humanitarian challenges: in New Jersey, one site uses an aquifer already near capacity; in Oklahoma City, a facility may house up to 1,500 detainees near a public elementary school; and in New York, former warehouse employees reported extreme temperatures and inadequate ventilation systems. At least 15 communities have held protests and public hearings to block the projects. The plan, designed to support the presidential goal of accelerating deportations, follows a 'hub-and-spoke' model with temporary processing hubs and large central facilities where migrants await removal. DHS confirmed new funding for expanding detention capacity but provided few details on specific sites. Legal experts and human rights organizations warn that retrofitting industrial warehouses to meet federal detention standards\u2014covering sanitation, water, and safety requirements\u2014could be complex and costly, especially under the agency\u2019s tight timelines. Despite widespread local opposition, federal court precedent often upholds the government\u2019s right to override local regulations when they obstruct federal policy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:20 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/internazionale/russian/wpost-ice-23_4gKlnL0y1L8Ns4y2AOGeU0)\n\n**NYC nonprofits brace for more federal funding cuts after already scaling back programming**\nNew York City's nonprofit organizations have already scaled back programming, laid off staff, and reduced services due to federal funding cuts, with further reductions expected by 2026 and 2027, according to a report by the Center for an Urban Future. Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the think tank, called the situation 'the biggest threat to a generation of the city's social services organizations.' The Trump administration has cut funding for shelter, emergency food, AmeriCorps, and withheld reimbursements from health care programs, citing efforts to curb waste and fraud. The report found that 22 surveyed nonprofits rely on federal funds for nearly a third of their budgets, with some depending on up to 50%. Consequences include the Food Bank for New York City receiving 10 million fewer pounds of food, Children's Aid ending a weekly food delivery program for 1,000 people, BronxWorks cutting nutrition education classes, and SAGE ending a program for 1,000 isolated LGBTQ+ seniors while laying off 19 staff. In January, the administration cut two-thirds of long-term housing funding, replacing it with short-term grants requiring mandatory treatment and work. Eric Rosenbaum of Project Renewal criticized the move, stating that helping vulnerable populations actually enhances public safety. At least 46 nonprofits currently receive grants for supportive housing, but many fear service reductions, including the potential closure of a 75-unit veteran housing building. Some organizations are refusing new federal grants due to restrictions, such as prohibitions on assisting undocumented individuals\u2014contrary to New York City\u2019s right-to-shelter law. Bowles recommended establishing a city-funded nonprofit stabilization fund to address urgent needs in food, shelter, and healthcare.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 02:01 PM\nSource:[Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-nonprofits-brace-for-more-federal-funding-cuts-after-already-scaling-back-programming)\n\n**After Mamdani's Victory, Will Trump Cut Federal Funds to New York?**\nFollowing Zohran Mamdani's electoral victory in New York, former U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to the city, citing Mamdani's characterization as a 'communist.' Trump stated in a CBS '60 Minutes' interview two days before the election that it would be difficult for him as president to allocate significant funds to New York if a 'communist' leads the city. Federal funds currently make up 6.4% of New York City\u2019s budget, amounting to $7.4 billion for the next fiscal year, with over $30 billion in Medicaid funding for New York State. These funds support critical social programs including public housing (Housing Authority), public transportation, universities, hospitals, and child and family services. The top ten federal programs consume three-quarters of Washington\u2019s city funding. In social services, federal funds cover about 18% of costs; for child services, nearly 43%; and for public housing, more than half. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program supported 146,189 recipients in fiscal year 2025 and covered 44% of the Department of Homeless Services\u2019 family shelter costs. Trump\u2019s administration has already cut or eliminated funding for emergency shelters, vaccination campaigns, and infectious disease research. The current federal government shutdown, beginning October 1, 2025, has already canceled $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, reportedly due to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) compliance. While the Constitution grants the U.S. House of Representatives the authority to withhold funds\u2014not the president\u2014Republicans currently hold a 53\u201347 majority in the House. The potential cancellation of federal funding could severely impact vulnerable populations, particularly in housing, healthcare, and education, posing major challenges for Mayor Mamdani\u2019s administration.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 01:46 PM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/it/attualita/estero/dopo-la-vittoria-di-mamdani-trump-tagliera-i-fondi-federali-a-new-york-2949678.html)\n\n**Trump could yank NYC's housing and school funding in revenge for picking Dem mayor: report**\nAccording to a report by Axios published on November 6, 2025, President Donald Trump is reportedly enraged by New York City's election of left-wing progressive Zohran Mamdani as mayor and is considering retaliatory actions, including revoking or reducing federal funding to critical city services. Trump has previously labeled Mamdani a 'Communist' and threatened retribution, citing Mamdani\u2019s policy platform, which includes free bus service, rent freezes, and publicly-owned grocery stores in low-income areas. The report notes that New York City is projected to receive $7.4 billion in federal funds in fiscal 2026, accounting for 6.4% of its total budget. Specifically, the city\u2019s education department receives over $2 billion in federal money, and the Department of Social Services receives $1.5 billion. The Administration for Children's Services receives 39% of its funding from the federal government, while the Department of Housing Preservation & Development\u2014responsible for affordable housing in a city facing a severe housing crisis\u2014gets 50% of its budget from federal sources. This could significantly hinder Mamdani\u2019s housing development agenda, despite a recent citywide vote to streamline private housing permitting. Trump has previously demonstrated a willingness to punish cities that oppose him, such as deploying federal immigration agents to Los Angeles and Chicago, sparking widespread protests.

Trump labeled Mamdani a 'communist' during a CBS 60 Minutes interview and reiterated this stance in a Truth Social post, stating that he would not contribute 'a lot of money' to New York City under a Mamdani administration, calling it a 'Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster.' However, under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the authority to allocate federal funds, as outlined in Article I, Section 8 and Section 9, which state that no money can be drawn from the Treasury except by law. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 allows the president to delay spending for up to 45 days, but only with congressional approval. While Trump's administration has previously paused or cut federal grants\u2014such as a $12 million MTA grant to the NYPD\u2014these actions are subject to legal challenges. The New York State Comptroller report from April 2025 indicated that New York City requires $7.4 billion in federal funding for fiscal year 2026, which accounts for 6.4% of its total spending. The report also warned of potential budget cuts of up to $400 million in FY2025 and $135 million in FY2026, with the full impact still uncertain. PolitiFact and Stanford professor Anna Grzymala-Busse have debunked claims that Mamdani is a communist, noting that he advocates democratic socialism, not a centrally planned economy. Andrew Cuomo, an independent candidate and former New York governor, also denied Mamdani is a communist, calling him a socialist. Despite this, Trump encouraged voting for Cuomo and discouraged support for Republican Curtis Sliwa, stating that a vote for Sliwa is effectively a vote for Mamdani. As of the election's opening at 6 a.m. local time, RealClearPolitics projected Mamdani with 46.1% of the vote, ahead of Cuomo (31.8%) and Sliwa (16.3%).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/can-trump-legally-stop-federal-funding-to-new-york-city-if-mamdani-wins)\n\n**Hours Before Historic Election, Trump Warns: 'Chance of Survival Would Be Zero' | America News**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump warned that if Zohran Mamdani, whom he labeled a 'communist,' wins the upcoming New York City mayoral election, federal funding for New York would be significantly reduced. Trump stated, 'If the communist candidate Mamdani wins the New York City mayoral election, my chance of providing even the minimum necessary federal funding is very low, because under a communist administration, the city's chances of success, and even survival, would be zero. The situation could get even worse under a communist regime.'

The policy, implemented in January 2025, charges $9 during peak hours for vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street and is projected to raise $500 million in its first year. It is the first such policy in the United States. Trump claimed that New York Governor Kathy Hochul's failure to build necessary pipelines in upstate New York and Long Island has caused energy prices to potentially triple, sparking anger in Connecticut and New England. He also asserted that the congestion fee has devastated New York City's economy, causing a sharp decline in foot traffic, turning Manhattan into a 'ghost town.' Trump stated he would instruct Secretary Duffy to thoroughly review the possibility of ending the fee, arguing that federal intervention is necessary due to the deteriorating state of the region. This marks Trump\u2019s second request to end the policy. In April, Secretary Duffy warned that if the state did not terminate the plan, the Department of Transportation might withhold environmental approvals or delay federal funding. The state sued the federal government, and in May, federal judge Lewis Liman issued a preliminary injunction blocking the DOT from withholding funds, a decision still pending final ruling by December 31, 2025. Governor Hochul countered that congestion pricing has significantly reduced traffic in Manhattan and boosted tourism and business activity, while the collected funds are supporting a $15 billion debt financing initiative to improve critical public transit infrastructure. In November 2025, the federal government froze approximately $18 billion in funding for major transportation projects in New York, including the Hudson River tunnel project connecting New Jersey and Manhattan, which involves Amtrak and commuter rail services. Trump declared the Hudson tunnel project 'terminated' and said it has become a key issue in the New Jersey gubernatorial election. Additionally, on February 19, 2025, the DOT rescinded a federal approval aimed at reducing congestion and funding aging subway and bus systems.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 04:57 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/11/4/n14629056.htm)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Cut New York's Federal Funds if Mamdani Wins Mayoral Race**\nDonald Trump has threatened to significantly reduce federal funding to New York City if Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral candidate, wins the November 2025 mayoral election. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated he would only provide the minimum required federal funds, arguing that he would not spend good money on what he described as bad governance. He warned that Mamdani\u2019s leadership would lead to a complete economic and social collapse in New York City. The magazine Newsweek outlined potential actions Trump might take if Mamdani wins, including increasing enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), suing the city, tying federal funding to compliance with specific priorities, and deploying federal agents. Mamdani, a New York State Assembly member, condemned Trump\u2019s remarks as an 'attack on democracy' and an attempt to intimidate New York residents. Mamdani is currently leading in polls over Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, and if elected, he would become the youngest mayor of New York City in over a century and the first Muslim and South Asian to hold the office.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:52 PM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/american-elections-2016/2025/11/04/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%84%D9%88-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%85%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%84%D8%B5-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%B5%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%83-)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Cut New York City's Federal Funding Over Mayoral Election Outcome**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump stated he would consider significantly reducing federal funding for New York City if Democrat candidate Mammadani wins the mayoral election, in which Mammadani is the leading candidate.

The announcement was published on November 3, 2025, by the Russian news outlet Ridsus.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:33 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/tramp-prigrozil-sokratit-finansirovanie-nyu-jorka-iz-za-vyborov-mera-726424.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nThe Trump administration is preparing executive actions to cut federal funding from New York City starting February 1, 2026, as part of a broader effort targeting \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Announcement and Scope**:  \n   President Trump formally announced the suspension of federal funds to sanctuary cities and states on January 15, 2026 [13][16]. This explicitly targets New York City, which stands to lose approximately $7.4 billion annually in federal funding for essential services like healthcare, education, transportation, and social programs [12][15]. The policy extends beyond NYC to all states hosting sanctuary jurisdictions, including California and Illinois [13][19].\n\n2. **Rationale and Timing**:  \n   The administration justifies this as a response to sanctuary policies that allegedly \"protect criminals at the expense of American citizens\" [13][16]. The February 1 deadline coincides with ongoing federal budget negotiations, including a partial government shutdown driven by Democratic demands for immigration enforcement reforms (e.g., requiring ICE agents to wear body cameras and obtain warrants) [1][6][10].\n\n3. **Impact on NYC**:  \n   - New York City is already grappling with a $12.6 billion structural budget deficit [7][8][11]. Federal cuts would exacerbate this crisis, potentially forcing reductions in public services and derailing Mayor Mamdani's affordable housing initiatives [12].  \n   - Critical programs like Medicaid, food assistance (SNAP), and emergency management rely on federal support. For example, 74% of NYC residents benefit indirectly from federally funded services [12][18].\n\n4. **Legal and Political Challenges**:  \n   - **Legal Precedent**: Similar efforts by the Trump administration in 2025 were blocked by federal courts (e.g., a San Francisco judge ruled such cuts unconstitutional, as only Congress may condition federal funds) [14][15][17]. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Mamdani have pledged immediate lawsuits, citing these precedents [12][14].  \n   - **State Response**: Governor Hochul is leveraging a $17 billion state tax surplus to offset potential losses but opposes new taxes [7][11]. She has also coordinated with California and Illinois on legal strategies [13][19].  \n   - **Federal Dynamics**: Congressional Republicans are divided. Some support policy reforms post-Minneapolis protests, while conservatives warn against concessions weakening enforcement [6]. Senate Democrats unanimously demand stricter ICE accountability before approving Department of Homeland Security funding [6][10].\n\n5. **Limitations and Uncertainties**:  \n   - The administration hasn't clarified which specific grants or programs face cuts, creating uncertainty for state budgets [15][17].  \n   - Estimates of NYC's federal funding exposure vary widely, from $7.4 billion (city-specific) to $96.7 billion (state-wide) [12][14][18].  \n   - Legal experts note the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing a related injunction, which could delay implementation [14][17].\n\nIn summary, while the Trump administration is actively advancing this executive action, its implementation faces significant legal and political headwinds. NYC officials are preparing contingency plans, but the outcome hinges on ongoing litigation and bipartisan negotiations in Congress. For real-time updates, monitor lawsuits filed by New York State and NYC in late January/early February 2026 [12][14].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
