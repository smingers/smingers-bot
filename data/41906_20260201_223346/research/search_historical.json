2 million New Yorkers will lose current health insurance coverage\n   - $3+ billion in increased costs for hospitals and providers\n   - $8 billion in funding cuts potentially forcing hospital service cuts or closures\n   - Nearly $13 billion total impact expected on NY's healthcare system\n   - 1.5 million New Yorkers will have health care coverage \"ripped away\"\n\n3. **SNAP (Food Assistance) Impacts:**\n   - 1 in 7 New Yorkers currently rely on SNAP\n   - 300,000 New York households will lose benefits\n   - $220 per month in lost food assistance for seniors, children, and families\n\n4. **Political Context:**\n   - All seven Republican members of Congress representing New York voted for the bill\n   - The bill is referred to as the \"Big Ugly Bill\" by Governor Hochul and others\n\n5. **Other Cuts Mentioned:**\n   - Counterterrorism funding cuts affecting mass transit safety\n   - Cuts to businesses and clean energy programs through the Department of Energy\n   - Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) application period delayed by a month due to federal government shutdown\n\n**Nature of Cuts:**\nThe article describes these as general budget cuts affecting health care, food assistance, and other programs across New York State, rather than cuts specifically targeting New York City alone. The cuts appear to be part of a broader federal budget bill affecting New Yorkers statewide.\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on statewide impacts rather than NYC-specific funding cuts, and describes cuts enacted through Congressional budget legislation rather than executive action.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/01/partial-government-shutdown-timeline-house-speaker-mike-johnson-vote-dhs-funding-ice/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Partial government shutdown will extend into the week as House Speaker Johnson says it will be a few days before vote on funding\"\n\n**Source:** Fortune  \n**Author:** Lisa Mascaro\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n### Government Shutdown Status:\n- A partial federal shutdown is ongoing and will extend into the week\n- Multiple federal agencies are affected, including Defense, health, transportation, and housing\n- Workers could go without pay or be furloughed if the impasse continues\n- This is the second shutdown in recent months related to congressional funding disputes\n\n### Current Funding Dispute:\n- The dispute centers on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations\n- President Trump struck a deal with senators to separate DHS funding from a broader package\n- The Senate approved a measure Friday to fund DHS temporarily for two weeks\n- House Speaker Mike Johnson said a vote won't occur for a few days (at least Tuesday)\n\n### Context for Dispute:\n- Public outrage followed two shooting deaths during protests in Minneapolis against ICE\n- Democrats are demanding restrictions on ICE operations beyond what's currently in the bill\n\n### Democratic Demands:\n- The bill already includes $20 million for body cameras\n- Democrats want additional requirements:\n  - Federal immigration agents must unmask and identify themselves\n  - End to roving patrols\n  - Judicial warrants required before agents enter homes or remove people from cars\n\n### Statements from Officials:\n\n**House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.):**\n- \"The president is leading this\"\n- Trump has \"already conceded that he wants to turn down the volume\" on federal immigration operations\n- Body cameras and ending roving patrols are areas of potential agreement\n- Opposes removing masks/identifying agents by name, citing safety concerns (agents being targeted, personal information posted online)\n- \"I don't think the president would approve it \u2014 and he shouldn't\"\n\n**House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.):**\n- \"What is clear is that the Department of Homeland Security needs to be dramatically reformed\"\n- Administration needs to begin negotiations now, not over the next two weeks\n- \"Masks should come off\"\n- Judicial warrants should be required \"consistent with the Constitution\"\n\n**Sen.

Each entry lists the date of the first operative document, the New York City dollars placed at risk, the legal/administrative mechanism invoked, and the latest known disposition.  Where new reporting clarifies or updates earlier figures, those changes are noted.\n\n2017  \n1. 25 Jan 2017 \u2013 Executive Order 13768 \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.\u201d  \n  \u2022 NYC exposure: then-Comptroller Scott Stringer estimated the City could forfeit \u201cmore than $7 billion a year\u201d in discretionary grants if designated a sanctuary jurisdiction.  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: directed DOJ & DHS to deem sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for most federal grants.  \n  \u2022 Outcome: nationwide permanent injunction (San Francisco v. Trump, N.D.Cal., 20 Nov 2017); no NYC funds were actually withheld.  (Order text at Federal Register; comptroller estimate reproduced in NYC Comptroller report).\n\n2020  \n2. 30 Jun 2020 \u2013 draft bill S.4066 \u201cEnding Taxpayer Funding of Anarchy Act,\u201d introduced at the White House\u2019s request.  \n  \u2022 Exposure: would have allowed DOJ to strip \u201canarchist jurisdictions\u201d (explicitly including NYC) of all federal \u201cfinancial assistance,\u201d >$7 billion annually.  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: statutory bar embedded in appropriations riders.  \n  \u2022 Outcome: referred to Senate Homeland Security Committee and never reported out; died at sine die adjournment (Clarksville Online, 7 Jul 2020).\n\n3. 2 Sep 2020 \u2013 Presidential Memorandum on \u201cReviewing Funding to State and Local Governments that Permit Anarchy.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Exposure: ordered OMB to compile \u201call Federal funds\u201d to NYC; baseline >$7 billion/yr.  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: OMB guidance + DOJ designation of \u201canarchist jurisdictions\u201d (designation issued 21 Sept 2020).  \n  \u2022 Outcome: memo revoked by Executive Order 13985 on 20 Jan 2021; no NYC-specific dollars were ever frozen (City & State NY, 24 Sep 2020).\n\n2025  \n4. 19 Feb 2025 \u2013 Executive Order 14218 \u201cEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Exposure: HUD, DOT, HHS and other programs that collectively send \u2248$9 billion/yr to NYC placed under mandatory review for potential suspension.  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: directed all agencies and OMB to identify payments \u201cabetting sanctuary policies\u201d and recommend cancellations.  \n  \u2022 Outcome: on 24 Apr 2025 and 22 Aug 2025, N.D.Cal. judges issued preliminary injunctions barring immediate withholding; as of 31 Jan 2026 no NYC-specific grant terminations have been announced (Immigration Policy Tracking database).\n\n5. 20 Jan 2025 \u2013 same-day Department of Transportation implementation of a companion Day-1 EO on \u201cEnding Illegal DEI Programs.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Exposure: DOT and OMB froze two sets of Capital Investment Grant (CIG) payments:  \n    a. Gateway Hudson River Tunnel \u2013 $16 billion of remaining federal grant and loan support (ENR, 27 Jan 2026);  \n    b. Second Avenue Subway Phase 2 \u2013 $2 billion remaining federal share plus a $300 million reimbursement invoice already submitted by MTA (NPR, 2 Oct 2025).  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: interim final rule prohibiting \u201crace- and sex-based contracting preferences,\u201d followed by 30 Sep 2025 suspension letters issued under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.  \n  \u2022 Outcome:  funding for both projects remains frozen; Gateway contractors warned of full shutdown by 6 Feb 2026 and litigation is imminent (ENR, 27 Jan 2026; Yahoo Finance, 29 Jan 2026).\n\n6. 21 Apr 2025 (and reiterations 4 Nov 2025 & 6 Jan 2026) \u2013 Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threat to withhold Federal Highway Administration aid unless NYC ends congestion-pricing tolls.  \n  \u2022 Exposure: State officials say $2\u20133 billion in formula and discretionary highway dollars for NYC projects could be targeted (New York Post, 21 Apr 2025).  \n  \u2022 Mechanism: warning letters invoking 23 U.S.C. \u00a7106(k) and FHWA tolling authority; no formal suspension notices yet.  \n  \u2022 Outcome: still a contingent threat; tolls remain in place and FHWA has not frozen funds (Gothamist, 21 Apr 2025).  Because no dollar figure is in a binding document, this episode is tracked but not counted among \u201cconfirmed\u201d \u2265$1 billion cuts.\n\nUnverified / still-research items  \n\u2022 1 Oct 2025 \u2013 DOE termination of $7.56 billion in clean-energy grants across 16 states (Energy.gov, 15 Oct 2025; NPR, 2 Oct 2025).  OMB Director Vought listed New York among affected states, but DOE has not released project-level data.  Environmental groups estimate the New York State hit at \u2248$900 million, leaving it unclear whether projects physically inside New York City exceed the $1 billion threshold.  Until DOE publishes the terminated-award list or FOIA requests succeed, this cannot be confirmed as an NYC-specific \u2265$1 billion cut.\n\nCurrent count of fully documented \u2265$1 billion NYC-targeted attempts (2017-Jan 2026)  \n1. 25 Jan 2017 \u2013 EO 13768 sanctuary-city grants (\u2265$7 B/yr) \u2013 enjoined  \n2. 30 Jun 2020 \u2013 \u201cAnarchy Act\u201d bill (\u2265$7 B/yr) \u2013 died in committee  \n3. 2 Sep 2020 \u2013 \u201cAnarchist Jurisdictions\u201d memo (\u2265$7 B/yr) \u2013 rescinded Jan 2021  \n4. 19 Feb 2025 \u2013 EO 14218 reviews (\u2265$9 B/yr) \u2013 cuts blocked, reviews ongoing  \n5. 30 Sep 2025 \u2013 DOT/OMB freeze of Gateway & Second Ave Subway funds ($18 B capital + $0.3 B reimbursement) \u2013 still frozen\n\nInformation gaps that remain  \n\n1. Exact New York City share of the 1 Oct 2025 DOE clean-energy terminations.  Neither DOE\u2019s 15 Oct 2025 press release nor contemporaneous press coverage supply project-location tables.  A FOIA request or forthcoming litigation filings may be required.  \n2. Whether any agency, acting under EO 14218, has issued NYC-specific suspension letters beyond the transit grants already identified (HUD, HHS, DOJ grant programs, etc.).  No such letters have surfaced in PACER or via trade associations as of 31 Jan 2026.  \n3. Status of the DOT/OMB freezes after FY 2026 appropriations negotiations: whether any partial reimbursements for Gateway or Second Avenue have been processed since October 2025.  \n4. A definitive, documented dollar figure for FHWA funds DOT threatens to withhold over congestion pricing.  The Secretary\u2019s letters do not name an amount, and no formal notice of suspension has been published in the Federal Register.\n\nAt present, the five actions listed above constitute the complete, verifiable record of \u2265$1 billion federal attempts to withhold funds specifically from New York City between 2017 and January 2026.  The four information gaps identified are the only areas where additional primary-source documents could alter that conclusion.</Agent_report>\n"
