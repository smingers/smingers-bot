## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Q1 deliveries historically (2022-2025):** 
   - Q1 2022: 310,048
   - Q1 2023: 422,875
   - Q1 2024: 386,810
   - Q1 2025: 336,681
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most directly comparable timeframe, accounts for seasonal patterns

2. **Year-over-year Q1 growth rates:**
   - Q1 2023 vs 2022: +36.4%
   - Q1 2024 vs 2023: -8.5%
   - Q1 2025 vs 2024: -13.0%
   - Suitability: HIGH - Shows recent negative trend

3. **Sequential quarterly performance (Q4 to Q1 pattern):**
   - Q4 2021→Q1 2022: -23.5%
   - Q4 2022→Q1 2023: +4.3%
   - Q4 2023→Q1 2024: -20.2%
   - Q4 2024→Q1 2025: -32.1%
   - Q4 2025→Q1 2026: ?
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Q1 typically weaker than Q4, but 2025 showed extreme drop

4. **Full-year delivery totals as baseline:**
   - 2026 guidance: 1.75 million
   - If evenly distributed: 437,500/quarter
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Assumes even distribution which historically doesn't hold

**Chosen Reference Class:** Q1 historical deliveries combined with YoY growth trends, as this captures both seasonal patterns and recent momentum.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 2, 2026
- Q1 2026 ends: March 31, 2026 (58 days away)
- Results announced: Early April 2026 (60-65 days away)

**Historical Q1 Patterns:**
- Q1 is typically the weakest quarter (production shutdowns, end of year push in Q4)
- Q1 2025 was exceptionally weak (-32.1% from Q4 2024, -13% YoY)
- Average Q1 as % of annual total (2022-2025): ~22.5%

**Recent Trends:**
- 2025 showed first full-year revenue decline
- Severe brand damage in Europe (market share halved)
- Competition intensifying from Chinese EV makers
- However, Q3 2025 showed recovery (497,099), suggesting not linear decline

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Base Rate Calculation:**

Starting from Q1 2025 (336,681), I need to consider:

1. **YoY growth expectation:** If 2026 target is 1.75M vs 2025 actual 1.636M, that's +7% growth. Applied to Q1: 336,681 × 1.07 = 360,249

2. **Sequential from Q4 2025:** Q4 2025 was 418,227. Historical Q4→Q1 drops range from -3.5% to -32.1%, with median around -20%. Applied: 418,227 × 0.80 = 334,582

3. **Recovery scenario:** If Tesla recovers to Q1 2024 levels (386,810) given new model launches

4. **Continued decline scenario:** If brand damage persists, could drop below Q1 2025 to ~310,000-320,000 range

5. **2026 annual target implications:** 1.75M target suggests ~437,500/quarter if even, but Q1 typically runs 20-25% below average, suggesting 350,000-380,000

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Model Y refresh impact (mentioned as in production)
- European market recovery potential (currently devastated)
- Chinese competition intensity
- Brand sentiment (political backlash vs. fading)
- New production lines ramping (Cybercab, Semi mentioned for H1 2026 but likely minimal Q1 impact)

**Synthesis:**
The most likely scenario is modest recovery from Q1 2025's disastrous performance, supported by:
- Management's 1.75M annual guidance implies confidence
- Q3 2025 showed Tesla can still deliver strong quarters (497k)
- Model Y refresh should provide some boost
- Base effects (Q1 2025 was exceptionally bad)

However, significant headwinds remain:
- European market hasn't recovered
- Q4 2025 (418k) was weaker than Q3, suggesting momentum loss
- Political/brand issues ongoing
- First quarter seasonal weakness

Outside view central estimate: 360,000-380,000 range

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring on Historical Q1 Performance:**
- Historical Q1 range (2022-2025): 310,048 to 422,875
- This provides natural bounds, though outcomes could exceed

**Distribution Shape Considerations:**

1. **Lower tail (10th-20th percentile):** Risk of continued deterioration
   - Worst historical Q1: 310,048 (2022)
   - If brand damage accelerates or production issues: 300,000-330,000
   - 10th percentile: 310,000 (matching worst recent Q1)
   - 20th percentile: 335,000 (slight improvement over Q1 2025)

2. **Central tendency (40th-60th percentile):** Modest recovery scenario
   - Management guidance implies growth, but Q1 typically weak
   - Model Y refresh provides some support
   - 40th percentile: 360,000 (7% growth from Q1 2025)
   - 60th percentile: 380,000 (approaching mid-point to Q1 2024)

3. **Upper tail (80th-90th percentile):** Strong recovery scenario
   - New model enthusiasm, brand recovery, production efficiency
   - Could approach or exceed Q1 2024 levels
   - 80th percentile: 400,000 (exceeding Q1 2024)
   - 90th percentile: 430,000 (approaching best Q1 ever, accounting for new capacity)

**Calibration Checks:**
- 80% confidence interval (10th to 90th): 310,000 to 430,000 (range of 120,000)
- This represents ±17% from median, appropriate given high uncertainty
- Distribution slightly right-skewed (more upside than downside from median) reflecting management guidance and potential for model refresh success
- Historical upset rate in Tesla deliveries: Moderate-high (frequently misses or beats by 5-10%)
