### (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large shifts warranted):**

1. **Q4 2025 Sequential Momentum Loss** (Downward pressure)
   - Q3 2025: 497,099 deliveries (record)
   - Q4 2025: 418,227 deliveries (down 15.8% sequentially)
   - Historical Q4→Q1 drops range -3.5% to -32.1%, but starting from weaker Q4 base
   - *Weight:* This is the most recent momentum indicator and suggests weakness entering Q1

2. **European Market Collapse** (Downward pressure)
   - Market share fell from 17.9% to 9.3% (Germany: 16% to 4%)
   - January-November 2025: 129,000 units (down 38.8% YoY)
   - Escalent study: 38% say brand freshness worn off
   - *Weight:* Structural brand damage unlikely to reverse in Q1 2026

3. **China Capacity Constraints + Competition** (Mixed)
   - Giga Shanghai at near-max capacity (97,171 units in December)
   - Domestic sales down 6% YoY in 2025
   - However, extended delivery times (February 2026) suggest strong order backlog
   - BYD's January 2026 sales down 30.1%, indicating broader market weakness
   - *Weight:* Capacity limits upside, but order backlog supports baseline

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate shifts):**

4. **Management 2026 Guidance Implications** (Upward pressure)
   - Unofficial reports of 1.75M target for 2026 (+7% vs 2025)
   - If evenly distributed: ~437,500/quarter, but Q1 typically 20-25% below average
   - Implies Q1 target: ~350,000-380,000
   - *Weight:* Not official guidance, but management typically sets achievable targets

5. **Model Y Refresh Timing** (Upward pressure)
   - New affordable Model Y launched October 2025
   - Analysts project this will "help Tesla regain ground in coming quarters"
   - However, refresh impact may be limited by production ramp timing
   - *Weight:* Should provide modest boost but insufficient to offset structural headwinds

6. **Tax Incentive Changes** (Mixed timing effect)
   - US federal EV credit ended September 30, 2025 (pulled Q3 sales forward)
   - China scaling back NEV tax exemption in 2026 (created December rush)
   - *Weight:* Q1 2026 faces difficult comps after pull-forward effects

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Small adjustments):**

7. **Robotaxi/Optimus Narrative** (Minimal Q1 2026 impact)
   - Cybercab production April 2026 (end of Q1)
   - Optimus Gen 3 launch Q1 2026 but production "agonizingly slow"
   - *Weight:* Irrelevant for Q1 2026 vehicle deliveries

8. **Competitor January 2026 Weakness** (Slight upward pressure)
   - BYD down 30.1% in January 2026
   - Suggests broader EV market softness, not Tesla-specific
   - *Weight:* May indicate Tesla's relative position isn't worsening

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 58 days until Q1 2026 ends (March 31, 2026)

**If Halved (29 days - mid-February):**
- Would be forecasting partial Q1 results
- January-February delivery patterns historically show:
  - January: Typically weakest month (factory shutdowns, post-holiday lull)
  - February: Modest recovery
- At 29-day mark, ~65-70% of Q1 deliveries complete
- Would weight January weakness more heavily, lowering prediction by ~5-10%

**If Doubled (116 days - late May):**
- Would include Q1 results announcement + early Q2 production data
- More information on:
  - Cybercab production ramp (April start)
  - Model Y refresh sustained demand
  - European market stabilization/deterioration
  - China competition intensity
- Uncertainty would decrease significantly (Q1 actual results known)
- Prediction would shift toward analyzing Q2 trajectory rather than Q1 outcome

**Q1 Seasonal Patterns:**
- January: Weakest (production shutdowns, typically 28-30% of Q1 total)
- February: ~32-34% of Q1 total
- March: Strongest (36-38% of Q1 total, end-of-quarter push)
- Current date (Feb 2): ~2 days into Q1, minimal information on actual January performance

### (d) Justification for Distribution

**Base Rate Starting Point:**
- Q1 2025: 336,681 deliveries (established baseline)
- Historical Q1 range (2022-2025): 310,048 to 422,875

**Key Factors Shifting Distribution:**

**DOWNWARD PRESSURES (from base rate):**
1. **Sequential momentum loss:** Q4 2025 (418,227) was 15.8% below Q3, suggesting weakening demand
2. **European collapse:** 38.8% YoY decline with no recovery signals
3. **Post-incentive hangover:** Q3 2025 pull-forward effects from US tax credit expiration
4. **Brand damage:** Political backlash ongoing, not resolved
5. **Weakest Q4→Q1 starting point since 2022:** Historical Q4→Q1 median drop is -20%, applied to weak Q4 base = ~334,000

**UPWARD PRESSURES (from base rate):**
1. **Management confidence:** Implied 2026 guidance of 1.75M suggests recovery expectation
2. **Model Y refresh:** Should provide demand boost in mature markets
3. **China order backlog:** Extended delivery times indicate strong demand despite capacity constraints
4. **Base effects:** Q1 2025 was exceptionally weak (-13% YoY, -32% sequential)
5. **Competitor weakness:** BYD's January 2026 collapse suggests market-wide softness, not Tesla-specific deterioration

**STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- **Capacity ceiling:** Giga Shanghai maxed out (~97k/month = ~291k for Q1), other factories must compensate
- **Geographic mix shift:** China (stronger) vs Europe (weaker) creates offsetting effects
- **Product mix:** Model S/X discontinuation removes ~3-6% of volume, but these were low-volume anyway

**Distribution Calibration Logic:**

**Lower Tail (1st-10th percentile): 280,000-320,000**
- Scenario: European collapse accelerates, China demand weakens, no Model Y refresh benefit
- Below worst historical Q1 (310,048 in 2022) but possible given:
  - 2022 had COVID supply chain issues (comparable disruption)
  - Current brand damage potentially worse than 2022 supply constraints
- 1st percentile (280,000): Extreme scenario with multiple simultaneous failures
- 10th percentile (320,000): Continued deterioration but not catastrophic

**Central Range (40th-60th percentile): 355,000-375,000**
- Scenario: Modest recovery from Q1 2025 disaster, supported by Model Y refresh and management guidance
- Represents +5.5% to +11.4% growth from Q1 2025 (336,681)
- Aligns with:
  - 20% sequential drop from Q4 2025 (418,227 × 0.80 = 334,582) + modest upward adjustment
  - 2026 annual guidance (1.75M) implies Q1 should be ~350-380k (accounting for Q1 weakness)
- 40th percentile (355,000): Conservative recovery
- 60th percentile (375,000): Moderate recovery with Model Y refresh benefit

**Upper Tail (90th-99th percentile): 410,000-450,000**
- Scenario: Strong Model Y refresh demand, European stabilization, China capacity maximized
- 90th percentile (410,000): Approaches Q1 2024 levels (386,810), accounting for new capacity
- 99th percentile (450,000): Exceeds best historical Q1 (422,875 in 2023)
- Requires multiple positive surprises:
  - Model Y refresh massive success
  - European market reversal
  - China maxing out capacity + strong demand
  - US market resilience despite no tax credit

**Why Not More Extreme Distribution?**
- Tesla has demonstrated ability to surprise (Q3 2025: 497,099 beat expectations)
- Management typically sets achievable targets (1.75M guidance suggests confidence)
- Model Y refresh is real catalyst, not speculative
- However, structural headwinds (Europe collapse, brand damage) limit upside

**Why Not Narrower Distribution?**
- High uncertainty factors:
  - January 2026 actual performance unknown
  - Model Y refresh demand trajectory unclear
  - European market stabilization unpredictable
  - China competition intensity volatile
- Historical Tesla delivery volatility: Frequently misses/beats by 5-15%
- Strategic pivot to robotics/AI creates management attention dilution risk

## Probability Calibration

**Median Estimate: ~365,000**
- Represents +8.4% growth from Q1 2025 (336,681)
- Implies -12.7% sequential decline from Q4 2025 (418,227)
- Aligns with 2026 annual guidance implications (~1.75M × 0.21 = 367,500)

**Mean Estimate: ~368,000**
- Slightly above median due to right-skewed distribution (more upside potential than downside)
- Reflects management guidance and Model Y refresh upside

**Confidence Intervals:**
- 80% CI (10th-90th): 320,000 to 410,000 (range: 90,000 or ±25% from median)
- 90% CI (5th-95th): 305,000 to 425,000 (range: 120,000 or ±33% from median)
- 98% CI (1st-99th): 280,000 to 450,000 (range: 170,000 or ±46% from median)

**Distribution Shape:**
- Slightly right-skewed (positive skew ~0.15)
- Reflects asymmetric risk: More upside potential (Model Y success, market recovery) than downside (already priced in European collapse)
- Kurtosis slightly elevated (fat tails) due to high uncertainty

**Calibration Checks:**
1. Does 365,000 median make sense? Yes - modest recovery from disastrous Q1 2025, supported by management guidance
2. Is 90,000 range (10th-90th) appropriate? Yes - reflects high uncertainty in volatile EV market
3. Are tails realistic? 
   - Lower tail (280,000): Requires catastrophic failure, but possible given brand damage
   - Upper tail (450,000): Requires multiple positive surprises, but Tesla has demonstrated this capability

## Checklist

**1. Target Variable:** Tesla global vehicle deliveries Q1 2026 (vehicles, Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026)

**2. Outside View Base Rate:** Q1 2025: 336,681; Historical Q1 range: 310,048-422,875; YoY growth trending negative (-13% in 2025)

**3. Consistency Check:** Implied median = 365,000; mean = 368,000. Makes sense given modest recovery from Q1 2025 disaster, supported by management 1.75M annual guidance and Model Y refresh, but constrained by European collapse and sequential momentum loss from weak Q4 2025.

**4. Key Evidence Influencing Prediction:**
   a) Q4 2025 sequential decline (497k→418k) suggests weakening momentum entering Q1
   b) European market collapse (down 38.8% YoY) with no recovery signals
   c) China extended delivery times indicate strong order backlog despite capacity constraints
   d) Management implied 2026 guidance (~1.75M) suggests confidence in recovery
