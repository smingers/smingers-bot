## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Q1 historical pattern (2022-2025):**
   - Q1 2022: 310K
   - Q1 2023: 423K
   - Q1 2024: 387K
   - Q1 2025: 337K
   - Average: 364K; Median: 364K
   - Q1 is typically Tesla's weakest quarter (seasonal, factory shutdowns)
   - Suitability: HIGH - directly comparable timeframe

2. **Recent quarterly trend (last 4 quarters of 2025):**
   - Q1: 337K, Q2: 384K, Q3: 497K, Q4: 418K
   - Shows high volatility; Q3 spike likely due to model refresh/backlog
   - Suitability: MODERATE - captures recent momentum but includes anomalous Q3

3. **Year-over-year Q1 comparison:**
   - Q1 2024→Q1 2025: -13% decline (387K→337K)
   - If similar decline: 337K × 0.87 = 293K
   - If recovery: 337K × 1.15 = 387K
   - Suitability: MODERATE - but 2025 had unique headwinds

**Selected Reference Class: Q1 historical pattern with adjustments for 2026 context**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January-March 2026 (currently Feb 2, 2026, so ~1 month elapsed, 2 months remaining)

**Q1 Historical Patterns:**
- Q1 is consistently Tesla's weakest quarter due to:
  - Chinese New Year production disruptions
  - Factory maintenance/upgrades
  - Weather impacts in key markets
  - Post-holiday demand slowdown

**Sequential Quarter Trends:**
- Q4→Q1 typically shows decline:
  - Q4 2022 (405K)→Q1 2023 (423K): +4% (anomaly)
  - Q4 2023 (485K)→Q1 2024 (387K): -20%
  - Q4 2024 (496K)→Q1 2025 (337K): -32%
  - Q4 2025 (418K)→Q1 2026: ?

**2025 Context:**
- Full year 2025: 1.64M (down 8.4% from 2024's 1.79M)
- Severe challenges: brand crisis, European collapse, political boycotts
- Q1 2025 was historically bad (337K, -13% YoY)

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Factors Suggesting Lower Deliveries (<350K):**
1. **Persistent brand damage:** Musk's political activities continue to impact sales, especially in Europe
2. **European market collapse:** Market share down from 17.9% to 9.3% in 2025; no signs of recovery
3. **Seasonal Q1 weakness:** Historically Tesla's worst quarter
4. **Sequential decline pattern:** Q4→Q1 typically drops 15-25%
5. **Competition intensifying:** Chinese EVs gaining share
6. **Model transition:** X/S ending, new products not yet ramped

**Factors Suggesting Higher Deliveries (>400K):**
1. **2026 annual target:** 1.75M implies ~437K quarterly average
2. **New model ramp:** Refreshed Model Y should boost demand
3. **Cybercab/Semi production:** Starting H1 2026, though likely minimal Q1 impact
4. **Base effect:** Q1 2025 was exceptionally weak; easier comparison
5. **Gene Munster forecast:** 35% growth in 2026 (though likely full-year view)
6. **Q3 2025 showed capability:** 497K demonstrates production capacity exists

**Baseline Calculation:**
- Q1 historical average (2022-2025): 364K
- Q4 2025→Q1 2026 sequential decline of 15%: 418K × 0.85 = 355K
- If 2026 target (1.75M) is accurate and evenly distributed: 437K
- YoY from Q1 2025 (337K) with modest recovery (+10%): 371K

**Critical Uncertainties:**
1. How much has brand recovered since Q1 2025?
2. Will European sales stabilize or continue collapsing?
3. Impact of new Model Y refresh timing
4. Whether 1.75M annual target is realistic or aspirational

## Outside View Calibration

The distribution should reflect:
- **Central tendency:** 350-400K range most likely
- **Lower bound considerations:** Worst case similar to Q1 2025 (337K) or slightly worse if trends continue
- **Upper bound considerations:** Strong recovery scenario toward 2026 target pace (437K+)
- **Tail risks:** 
  - Downside: Further brand deterioration, factory issues (5-10% probability of <320K)
  - Upside: Stronger-than-expected Model Y refresh impact (10-15% probability of >450K)

**Historical volatility:** Q1 deliveries have ranged from 310K to 423K (2022-2025), showing ~30% range. Given 2025's disruption, wider range is appropriate.

**Distribution shape:** Should be slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) because:
- Physical production capacity exists (Q3 2025 showed 497K)
- Company guidance suggests optimism
- But downside more constrained by recent floor (337K)

**90% confidence interval:** I'll set wide bounds given:
- Ongoing brand crisis uncertainty
- Model transition timing unknown
- European market trajectory unclear
- Historical Q1 volatility
