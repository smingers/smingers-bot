Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources (Pre-Feb 2026):**
- **CNBC (Jan 2, 2026)**: Reports Q4 2025 deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, down 16% YoY. High factual reliability - directly cites Tesla IR data. Opinions from Cannacord Genuity analysts are labeled but lack specific attribution.
- **Yahoo Finance (Jan 2, 2026)**: Same Q4 2025 figures. Named analyst opinions from Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu and Wedbush's Dan Ives provide market sentiment context.
- **Teslarati (Dec 15, 2025)**: Reports China delivery timeline extensions to February 2026, suggesting demand/supply dynamics. Mid-tier EV news site; factual on delivery dates but interpretations are speculative.
- **Gasgoo (Jan 12, 2026)**: Comprehensive 2025 performance data (1.636M deliveries, down 8.6%). Cites Escalent study showing brand erosion. Good for regional breakdowns.
- **Electrek (Jan 5, 2026)**: Reports Giga Shanghai December wholesale at 97,171 units (near capacity). Author Fred Lambert provides opinion-heavy analysis on Chinese competition.

**Current Context Sources (Feb 2, 2026):**
- **AskNews - K.sina (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports Q4 2025 earnings with revenue $24.9B (down 3.1% YoY). **Critical fact**: Model S/X production ending "next quarter" (Q1 2026), reducing total production capacity by ~11,000 units/quarter historically. Optimus production plans are future-oriented, not Q1 2026 relevant.
- **AskNews - Blue Whale Finance (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports on autonomous driving legislation - not directly relevant to Q1 2026 deliveries.
- **AskNews - BYD sales (Feb 1, 2026)**: BYD January 2026 sales down 30.1% to 210,051 units - suggests broader industry weakness in early 2026.
- **AskNews - Multiple Chinese sources (Jan 29-31, 2026)**: Confirm Q4 2025 results and strategic pivot to robotics. **Key fact**: Fremont factory retooling means reduced automotive capacity in 2026.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Q4 2025 → Q1 2026 seasonal pattern**: Historical data shows Q1 consistently weaker than Q4. Past three years: Q4 2022→Q1 2023 (+4%), Q4 2023→Q1 2024 (-20%), Q4 2024→Q1 2025 (-32%). Mean = -16%, but trend is worsening.
2. **Model S/X production cessation**: Multiple sources confirm production ending in Q1 2026. Historical contribution ~11,600 units/quarter (Q4 2025 figure). This is a structural capacity reduction.
3. **Industry weakness signal**: BYD's January 2026 sales down 30% suggests broad Q1 2026 demand softness in key markets.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **China delivery timeline extensions**: February 2026 delivery dates for new orders (reported Dec 2025) suggest production/demand imbalance, but could reflect either strong demand or supply constraints.
2. **Factory retooling impact**: Fremont transitioning to Optimus production likely causes Q1 2026 disruptions. Historical precedent: Q1 2025 saw -32% drop partly due to Model Y refresh retooling.
3. **Competitive pressure**: Tesla lost global EV crown to BYD (2.26M vs 1.64M in 2025). European sales down 39% in 11 months of 2025. Structural market share erosion.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Analyst projections of 1.75M for 2026**: Single unconfirmed figure (437k/quarter average) lacks official Tesla guidance.
2. **Tax credit expiration impact**: Already reflected in Q4 2025 weakness; unclear if further drag exists.
3. **Robotaxi/Optimus narrative**: Irrelevant to Q1 2026 vehicle deliveries.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 58 days (Feb 2 to April 1, 2026 press release).

The short timeframe means Q1 2026 production is essentially locked in:
- January 2026 production already completed
- February 2026 production in progress
- March 2026 production plans finalized

**If timeframe halved (29 days)**: Prediction would be more certain - only January deliveries matter, likely ~130-140k based on historical monthly patterns.

**If timeframe doubled (116 days, covering Q1+Q2)**: Would incorporate Model S/X cessation fully, Fremont retooling completion, and potential demand recovery. Distribution would widen significantly (250k-500k range for Q2).

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Starting point**: Outside view baseline of 366,000 with 10th/90th percentiles at 345k/475k.

**Downward adjustments warranted:**
1. **Model S/X production halt** (-11,600 units): This is a hard structural constraint confirmed by multiple sources. Unlike the outside view's generic -16% seasonal pattern, this is a known capacity reduction.
2. **Worsening seasonal trend**: Q4→Q1 changes have deteriorated from +4% (2023) to -20% (2024) to -32% (2025). The -16% mean understates recent momentum.
3. **Industry weakness signal**: BYD's 30% January drop suggests Q1 2026 is weaker than typical seasonal patterns would predict.
4. **Fremont retooling disruption**: Similar to Q1 2025's Model Y refresh impact, but now affecting multiple lines.

**Upward pressure (limited):**
1. **Giga Shanghai capacity**: December 2025 hit 97,171 wholesale units (near max). If sustained, provides ~290k from China alone.
2. **Model Y refresh complete**: Production lines now fully operational versus Q1 2025 disruptions.

**Net assessment**: The structural capacity loss (Model S/X) and accelerating negative seasonal trend justify shifting the distribution downward from the outside view. The reference class remains valid (Tesla Q1 deliveries), but specific 2026 factors are materially worse than the historical mean.

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency reasoning:**
- Q4 2025 base: 418,227
- Model S/X reduction: -11,600 → 406,627
- Seasonal adjustment: Apply -20% (midpoint of recent -20%/-32% trend) → 325,000
- Partial offset from Shanghai strength: +15,000 → 340,000

**Distribution shape:**
- Lower bound constrained by minimum factory output (~280k if severe disruptions)
- Upper bound limited by capacity constraints and demand weakness
- Right tail capped below outside view due to structural headwinds

**Percentile construction:**
- P1: Catastrophic scenario (major factory shutdown, demand collapse) → 280,000
- P10: Severe weakness (Shanghai underperforms, retooling delays) → 310,000
- P50: Central case (moderate seasonal decline + S/X loss) → 340,000
- P90: Optimistic (demand stabilizes, minimal disruption) → 385,000
- P99: Unexpected strength (large fleet order, China surge) → 420,000

Implied mean ≈ 345,000; median = 340,000. This is ~21,000 below the outside view median of 366,000, justified by the structural capacity reduction and worsening trends.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total Tesla global vehicle deliveries reported in Q1 2026 press release (units: vehicles).

2. **Outside view anchor**: 366,000 based on -16% mean Q4→Q1 change; adjusted down to 340,000 median due to Model S/X cessation and worsening seasonal trend.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 340,000; mean ≈ 345,000. Aligns with Q4 2025 base (418k) minus structural losses (-12k) and seasonal weakness (-20% vs -16% historical).

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Model S/X production ending Q1 2026 removes ~11,600 units (confirmed, structural)
   - Q4→Q1 seasonal trend worsening: -20% to -32% past two years (strong historical pattern)
   - BYD January 2026 sales down 30% signals industry weakness (moderate indicator)
   - Fremont retooling disruptions similar to Q1 2025 Model Y refresh (moderate, historical parallel)
   - Giga Shanghai near-capacity December output (97k units) provides floor (moderate, recent data)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Large fleet/government order (e.g., Hertz-style deal or Chinese government EV procurement) announced late Q1 could add 30-50k units, pushing outcome to 380-400k range. This would make the forecast look overly pessimistic.
