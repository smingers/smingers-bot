Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what’s factual vs opinion; quality; recency)
1) **AfroTech recap of Q1 2025 deliveries (links to Reuters/Quartz-type reporting)**  
   - **Factual**: Q1 2025 deliveries **336,681**; YoY decline **13%**; “largest decline in deliveries” framing.  
   - **Opinion**: commentary about “disaster,” boycotts/protests as key drivers.  
   - **Quality/Date**: Secondary media source; useful mainly for the **headline number** (which matches other outlets). Published after Q1 2025, so historical not speculative. Medium reliability for causal claims.

2) **Statista quarterly deliveries page (published Oct 2, 2025; chart not visible in extract)**  
   - **Factual**: Statista claims a Tesla-sourced quarterly series through **Q3 2025**, but we can’t see the actual numbers in the provided extract.  
   - **Quality/Date**: Potentially high if we had the table, but **not usable** here due to missing values in the extract.

3) **CNBC (Apr 2, 2025) on Q1 2025 production/deliveries**  
   - **Factual**: Q1 2025 deliveries **336,681**; mix (Model 3/Y vs other); misses vs consensus; some regional datapoints; mentions planned factory shutdowns for Model Y redesign.  
   - **Opinion**: analyst quotes (Ives, Munster).  
   - **Quality/Date**: High-quality outlet for the **reported delivery number** and contemporaneous context.

4) **Yahoo Finance (Q4 2025 earnings write-up; date not explicitly shown in summary but refers to Q4 2025 results)**  
   - **Factual**: profit/margin metrics; some operational plans; (does not directly give deliveries in the excerpt).  
   - **Opinion**: optimism/forward-looking tone.  
   - **Quality/Date**: Medium-high on financial metrics; limited direct use for Q1 2026 deliveries.

5) **Car Dealership Guy (Dec 31, 2025) about Tesla publishing analyst estimates for Q4 2025**  
   - **Factual**: claim Tesla posted a list of sell-side estimates; consensus estimate cited (**422,850** for Q4 2025).  
   - **Opinion**: narrative about “rare signal,” causes of demand weakness, interpretation.  
   - **Quality/Date**: Mixed—useful as a window into **street expectations** at the time, but not an outcome and not primary.

6) **Electrek (Jan 28, 2026) on Q4 2025 financial results**  
   - **Factual**: earnings/revenue; notes auto performance weak; forward plans (Cybercab, Semi ramp in 1H 2026).  
   - **Opinion**: Electrek’s interpretive framing; also appears incomplete.  
   - **Quality/Date**: Medium reliability; limited direct quantitative guidance for Q1 2026 deliveries.

7) **Agent report (compiled quarterly deliveries 2022–2025; plus a secondary “1.75m in 2026” target)**  
   - **Factual (most useful piece)**: A consistent quarterly delivery history:
     - Q1: **310k (2022)**, **423k (2023)**, **387k (2024)**, **337k (2025)**
     - Q4 2025: **418k** (also supported by Yahoo Finance mention in the agent report)
   - **Quality/Date**: Not primary (it aggregates), but internally consistent and matches major outlets for key quarters. I treat these quarterly figures as credible **base-rate anchors**.  
   - **Caution**: The “**1.75 million** deliveries in 2026” is **secondary reporting** and may represent aspiration, analyst expectation, or informal target—not firm guidance.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choose a baseline)
Plausible reference classes:
1) **Tesla Q1 deliveries in the last 4 years (Q1 2022–Q1 2025)**  
   - Pros: Directly answers “Q1 seasonality + Tesla-specific constraints.”  
   - Cons: Regime changes (price cuts, competition, product refresh disruptions, brand effects).

2) **Tesla quarter-to-quarter seasonal pattern: Q1 vs prior Q4**  
   - Pros: Captures strong recurring pattern: Q1 tends to be weaker than Q4 (logistics, incentives, year-end pushes).  
   - Cons: The ratio is unstable recently (big swings in 2024–2025).

3) **A “post-down-year partial rebound” pattern for mature automakers/EV leaders**  
   - Pros: Helps sanity-check that rebounds often happen but are rarely immediate V-shapes.  
   - Cons: Less precise than Tesla’s own history.

**Most suitable**: A blend of **(1) Q1 history** and **(2) Q1 vs prior Q4 ratio**, because the question is explicitly Q1 2026 and Tesla exhibits strong quarter seasonality.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today**: 2026-02-02.  
- **Forecasted quarter**: Q1 2026 (Jan–Mar 2026).  
- **Time left until the quarter ends**: ~2 months remaining; however, the forecast is about a quarter total that is already ~1/3 complete.  
- **Resolution**: by May 1, 2026 (press release window).

Historical Q1 pattern (from agent report):
- Q1 2022: 310k  
- Q1 2023: 423k  
- Q1 2024: 387k  
- Q1 2025: 337k  
Mean ≈ **364k**, median ≈ **362k**. Range **310k–423k**.

Recent volatility suggests the distribution should be fairly wide: Q1 has swung by ~110k in three years.

### (d) Justification (outside-view)
**Step 1: Start with a base-rate for “typical Tesla Q1”**  
- Using Q1 2022–2025, a naive base rate is ~**360–365k**.

**Step 2: Adjust for the most recent regime (2024–2025 softness + volatility)**  
- Tesla delivered **336,681** in Q1 2025 (very weak) and **418,227** in Q4 2025 (also down from Q4 2024’s ~496k).  
- This suggests **demand/production constraints** persisted into late 2025; not a simple one-off.

**Step 3: Seasonality check using Q1 vs prior Q4**
- Recent ratios:
  - Q1 2024 / Q4 2023 ≈ 387/485 ≈ **0.80**
  - Q1 2025 / Q4 2024 ≈ 337/496 ≈ **0.68**
- If Q1 2026 / Q4 2025 lands around **0.75–0.85**, then Q1 2026 ≈ 418k × (0.75–0.85) ≈ **314k–355k**.
- But that may be too pessimistic if 2025 Q1 was depressed by specific refresh/shutdown effects that are no longer as binding in 2026.

**Step 4: Offset with plausible 2026 rebound forces (but keep outside-view discipline)**
- Some sources mention ramps in 1H 2026 (Cybercab/Semi), but these may have **limited Q1 delivery impact** (ramps usually contribute more later).  
- A secondary “1.75m in 2026” aspiration implies an average of ~438k/quarter, but Q1 is usually below average; that would still be consistent with something like **380k–420k** for Q1 if later quarters compensate.

**Net outside-view conclusion**: Center the forecast modestly above the long-run Q1 average (≈364k) but below the “strong growth” case, landing around **~395k**. The tails remain wide given recent quarter-to-quarter instability and sensitivity to pricing, China/Europe demand, and production line changes.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I’m aiming for a **true distribution** reflecting real volatility seen in Tesla deliveries (swings of 80k–150k have occurred).  
- I anchor the median/center near **395k** (a partial rebound vs Q1 2025 but not a full return to 2023 highs).  
- **Downside (10th percentile)** reflects a renewed demand slump, China weakness, or production hiccups: low **~300k**.  
- **Upside (90th percentile)** reflects a stronger-than-expected Model Y refresh normalization plus incentives and smoother logistics: high **~470k**.  
- I keep the 80–90 range relatively wide because “unexpected outcomes” in this domain are common (price war/incentives, macro shocks, regulatory shifts, or production disruptions).
