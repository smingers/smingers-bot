Analysis:

1) Target / resolution criteria (what exactly resolves)
- The question resolves to Tesla’s total global vehicle deliveries (vehicles) reported in Tesla IR “Production, Deliveries & Deployments” press release for Q1 2026 (Jan–Mar 2026), using the version published after opening and before May 1 2026.

(a) Source analysis (facts vs opinions; quality; date)
- CNBC (Jan 2 2026) on Q4 2025 deliveries: High-quality secondary reporting of Tesla’s official delivery release. Facts: Q4 2025 deliveries 418227; FY 2025 deliveries 1.64m; YoY declines; mix heavily Model 3/Y. Includes analyst commentary and narrative (opinions) about demand/backlash and incentives.
- Yahoo Finance (Jan 2 2026): High-quality financial press summarizing the same official delivery facts; includes identifiable analyst quotes (Edison Yu, Dan Ives)—opinions, useful for sentiment but not direct delivery forecasting.
- Teslarati (Dec 15 2025) on China order lead times: EV-blog source; factual claims about Tesla China configurator delivery estimates are plausible but less rigorous than official data. Interpretation (demand vs supply constraints) is speculative.
- Gasgoo Auto News (Jan 12 2026): Industry publication; likely mixes data and narrative. Facts (FY totals, regional weakness, competitive landscape) broadly consistent with other sources; some assertions and “industry insider” claims are opinion/less verifiable.
- Electrek (Jan 5 2026) on China: Tesla-focused outlet; some facts (e.g., production and China market characterization) may be accurate but the tone is opinionated. Useful mainly for directional signals: China competition intense; Shanghai near capacity; 2026 competition likely higher (opinion).
- Asknews Chinese-language earnings-summary cluster (Jan 29–Feb 2 2026): Mixed quality; appears to summarize Tesla’s Q4/FY 2025 earnings call narrative (robotics pivot, Model S/X discontinuation timing, capex). These are mostly *company statements* (facts about plans) plus heavy editorializing (opinions). Key for Q1 2026 deliveries only insofar as it suggests management attention/capex is shifting, but near-term production capacity for 3/Y remains the driver.
- Provided “outside view prediction” block (historical quarterly deliveries 2022–2025): The hard numbers look consistent with Tesla’s publicly reported quarterly releases (good baseline). The “1.75M annual target” mention is less certain (secondary reporting; treat cautiously).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large shifts)
1) Seasonality + historical Q1 weakness (structural): Q1 has repeatedly been the weakest quarter for Tesla (factory downtime/upgrades, post-holiday demand, China New Year logistics). This is a strong base-rate anchor.
2) Q4 2025 actual delivered 418227 and FY 2025 1636129 (official, widely reported): establishes current run-rate and recent downtrend; also constrains how high Q1 2026 can realistically go given normal Q1 drop.
3) Incentive pull-forward dynamics (structural-ish): End of the US federal incentive in late 2025 plausibly pulled demand earlier (notably inflating Q3 2025), leaving weaker organic demand entering 2026. This supports a lower Q1 baseline than a naive “revert to 2024” view.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
4) China tax/incentive timing + China New Year: reporting suggests China policy changes and end-of-year pushes can shift deliveries across quarters. Likely headwind to Q1 2026 vs a “clean” seasonal pattern.
5) Model Y “more affordable” variant launched Oct 2025: could support incremental demand into early 2026, partially offsetting Q1 seasonality. But magnitude uncertain.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
6) Website lead times for Model 3/Y in China implying demand: ambiguous (could be demand, could be supply/batching/export allocation). I use it only as a small nudge away from extreme downside.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-02. Q1 2026 ends 2026-03-31. Resolution likely in early April 2026 (Tesla’s Q1 deliveries press release), well before May 1 2026.
- Time left: ~2 months until quarter end, ~2–3 months until the delivery number is published.
- If timeframe were halved (we were forecasting closer to late March): I’d tighten the distribution meaningfully using Jan–Feb registration/insurance data in China and Europe plus US delivery channel checks.
- If timeframe were doubled (forecasting much earlier): I’d widen tails further because quarter-to-quarter logistics batching and demand shocks would dominate.

(d) Justification (inside view adjustments to the outside view)
Outside-view baseline given: central mass ~350000–400000, with P10 310000 and P90 460000.

Key adjustments:
1) Downward adjustment to the median: Q4 2025 (418227) looks like a “post pull-forward” reality check after the unusually strong Q3 2025 (497000). Given historical Q4→Q1 drops (often 20%+ recently) and ongoing competitive pressure in China/Europe, the cleanest inside-view move is to pull the median down modestly from ~377000 toward the mid- to high-360000s.
2) Keep a meaningful upside tail: Tesla still has demonstrated capacity to deliver near/above 400000 in weak demand environments via pricing/logistics; a “less bad than feared” Q1 is plausible if Model Y price points and end-of-quarter pushes work.
3) Widen the downside tail slightly: If Europe weakness persists and China demand is pulled into late-2025, Q1 could undershoot 320000 again. Not my central case, but plausible enough for the 10th percentile near ~300000.

Probability calibration (outside view → inside view)
- Outside view median (approx): ~377000 (midpoint of 40th=365000 and 60th=390000).
- Inside view median: shift down ~10000–15000 vehicles, mainly due to (i) pull-forward effects + (ii) Q1 seasonality interacting with weaker organic demand signals.
- Tail shaping:
  - Downside: slightly heavier than the outside-view implied, because “another ugly Q1” is plausible.
  - Upside: still present, but I reduce the very high tail somewhat because Q1 seasonality caps near-term upside absent a major new model ramp (Cybercab mass production is expected April 2026, i.e., after Q1).

Checklist:
1) Resolution criteria paraphrase: Tesla’s total global vehicle deliveries (vehicles) reported for Q1 2026 in Tesla’s IR deliveries press release.
2) Outside view base rate used: Q1 historical average ~364000; outside-view distribution centered ~350000–400000 (median ~377000).
3) Consistency check: Implied median = 372000; mean ≈ 380000; consistent with Q4 2025=418227 and typical Q1 seasonal drop.
4) Top evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Q1 is structurally Tesla’s weakest quarter; repeated historical pattern.
   - Q4 2025 deliveries 418227; FY 2025 down to 1636129 (official).
   - 2025 incentive pull-forward likely depresses underlying demand entering Q1 2026.
   - China/Europe competition remains intense; China policy timing may shift demand into late 2025.
5) Blind spot: A surprise demand/price cut wave (or unusually strong fleet sales) could push Q1 sharply higher.
