Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Afrotech article (Apr-2025): Fact – Q1 2025 deliveries 336 681 (-13 % YoY).  Opinions from Dan Ives (Wedbush) calling the quarter “a disaster.”  Mid-tier tech-news site; data point matches Tesla press release → high factual reliability for the single number, low for broader conclusions.  
2. CNBC Q1 2025 story (Apr-2025): Same delivery figure, plus model split and consensus expectations.  CNBC routinely copies Tesla IR numbers and is reliable for basic data.  Opinions (Ives, Munster) are clearly labeled.  
3. Statista page (Oct-2025): Historical quarterly deliveries 2016-Q3 2025.  Pay-walled chart; we already obtained the underlying numbers elsewhere.  Good cross-check.  
4. Yahoo Finance & Electrek Q4 2025 earnings coverage (Jan-2026): Provide official Q4 2025 delivery total 418 227 and colour on 2025 demand weakness.  Both copy Tesla IR figures; factual component solid, opinions variable (Electrek mildly pro-Tesla).  
5. Dealership Guy newsletter (Dec-2025): Consensus estimate for Q4 2025 (422 850) and commentary on soft demand.  Secondary source, but helpful for gauging Street expectations.  
6. Agent_report (compiled Feb-2026): Collates Tesla press-release delivery numbers 2022-2025 and cites one press-reported 2026 annual target of 1.75 million.  Source list shows multiple mainstream outlets; figures line up with CNBC and Tesla IR.  Because they are repetitively confirmed, I treat the quarterly history as hard data; the single 1.75 M guidance remains unconfirmed and therefore soft.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Tesla’s own Q1 deliveries 2022-2025 (four-year micro-series).  
2. Tesla quarterly deliveries overall (all 16 quarters 2022-2025).  
3. Industry-wide first-quarter EV deliveries of large global OEMs.  

Class 1 focuses on exactly the same quarter and the same firm, so it captures Tesla’s seasonality and model-cycle quirks.  It is therefore the most relevant, despite the small N.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 88 days (today 2 Feb 2026, press release expected 1-3 Apr 2026).  
Historical Q4→Q1 pattern:  
• Q4 2022 → Q1 2023: +4 %  
• Q4 2023 → Q1 2024: –20 %  
• Q4 2024 → Q1 2025: –32 %  

Mean change = –16 % with stdev ≈ 18 pp.  The last two years show steep drops driven by demand softness and factory re-tooling; 2023 was an outlier boost when backlog was high.  Q4 2025 deliveries (418 227) were already 16 % below Q3 2025, so some weakness is arguably baked in.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Baseline: apply the mean Q4→Q1 change (-16 %) to the most recent Q4 (418 227) → 351 000.  
Adjustments:  
+ Demand could stabilise: Street expects 1.75 M for 2026 ⇒ average 437 k/quarter; early quarters usually weaker, so perhaps 10-15 % below the annual run-rate → +40 k.  
+ Completed Model Y line upgrades were cited as reason for 2025 slump; lines are now back up, providing upside of ~10 %.  
– Competition (BYD, VW, GM-Ultium) intensifies and U.S. tax credit expired; risk of another 5-10 % drag.  
Net adjustment ≈ +15 k over baseline.

Point estimate ≈ 366 000, but large uncertainty remains: factory snafus, China demand swings, or a surprise fleet order could shift deliveries ±70 k.

Outside view calibration:

I assume a roughly normal-ish distribution truncated at 0, with mean 410 000 and σ ≈ 45 000, then widen slightly for fat tails.  That yields:  
– 10th percentile ≈ μ – 1.4 σ → 347 k  
– 90th percentile ≈ μ + 1.4 σ → 473 k  
Rounded to the nearest 5 000 to avoid false precision and ensure monotonicity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 345000  
Percentile 20: 360000  
Percentile 40: 390000  
Percentile 60: 420000  
Percentile 80: 455000  
Percentile 90: 475000
