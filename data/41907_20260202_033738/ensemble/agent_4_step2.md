Analysis:

1. Source analysis (facts vs. opinion, quality, recency – abbreviated)
• Tesla Q4-25 delivery press release (Jan 2 2026, ir.tesla.com). 418227 deliveries. Primary, factual, very high quality.  
• Tesla Q4-25 earnings release / call (Jan 28 2026, ir.tesla.com; multiple media summaries). Gives 2025 full-year 1636129 deliveries, confirms Model S/X sunset, cap-ex plans. Factual totals are primary; forward commentary is Musk opinion. High quality for past data, moderate for forecasts.  
• CNBC & Yahoo Finance pieces (Jan 2 2026). Repeat Q4 facts, add analyst quotes. Facts reliable; quotes are opinion.  
• Electrek & Gasgoo (Jan 5 & Jan 12 2026). Provide China wholesale/retail decline data. Mid-quality; numbers sourced from CPCA.  
• AskNews Chinese-language round-ups (Jan 30-Feb 2 2026). Summarise earnings call, Optimus pivot, cap-ex. Past numbers match IR; forward guidance highly speculative. Moderate quality for historical info, weak for outlook.  
• ACEA November 2025 EU registration data. Primary registry numbers. High quality.  
No credible public guidance yet for Q1 2026 deliveries.

2. Evidence weighting
Strong:  
• Historical Q1 deliveries 2022-2025 (310k, 423k, 387k, 337k) – four independent Tesla releases.  
• Seasonality ratio Q1/Q4 usually 0.7-0.85.  
Moderate:  
• China December 2025 wholesale near-max capacity but domestic sales still down → demand headwind persists.  
• Europe registrations -39 % Jan-Nov 25 → ongoing weakness.  
• End of US federal credit (Sept 30 25) likely pulled demand into Q3/Q4 25, leaves soft Q1 26.  
Weak:  
• Analyst talk of “1.75 m deliveries 2026” (single source, no official guide).  
• Cybercab, Semi, Roadster ramps touted for 2026 but minimal Q1 impact.

3. Timeframe analysis
Forecast horizon: outcome known at start of April 2026 press release (≈60 days from today).  If window were halved (30 days left), most production already baked in → distribution would narrow ~10 %.  If doubled (120 days), would widen ~10-15 % because Q1 operations not yet started.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments
Base rate: average Tesla Q1 deliveries 2022-2025 ≈364000.  
Adjustments:  
• Q4 25 to Q1 26 seasonality: apply 0.75–0.85 to 418227 ⇒ 314k-355k (downward).  
• Partial bounce from unusually weak Q1 25 (shutdowns now over) + Model Y Standard price cuts (upward ~30-40k).  
• Ongoing China/Europe demand softness & loss of US credit (downward ~20-25k).  
Net central estimate ≈395000.  Wider tails kept for execution swings, macro uncertainty, or surprise fleet purchases.

Probability calibration

I model a log-normal-ish distribution centred on 395000, σ ≈ 0.19 (in proportional terms).  This reproduces 10th ≈310000 and 90th ≈470000 and yields mean ≈400000, median ≈392000.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Tesla global vehicle deliveries in Q1 2026, vehicles, per official press release.  
2. Outside-view base rate: 364000 (mean Q1 deliveries 2022-2025).  
3. Consistency: median 392000; mean 400000; aligns with justification.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Q1 seasonal ratio 0.7-0.85 of prior Q4.  
   – Q4 25 actual deliveries 418227.  
   – 2025 demand decline (-9 % YoY).  
   – Loss of US tax credit after Sept 25.  
   – No new high-volume model before Q2 26.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected big US fleet order or new Chinese incentive lifting March sales, pushing outcome above 500000.
