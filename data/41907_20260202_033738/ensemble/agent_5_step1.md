Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. AfroTech (Apr-02-2025) – Factual: Q1 2025 deliveries 336 681 (-13 % YoY).  Opinion: analyst Dan Ives calls results “a disaster”.  Quality: Medium; data reproduced elsewhere, but site is not primary finance press.  
2. CNBC (Apr-02-2025) – Same Q1 2025 figure plus model split and consensus numbers.  Quality: High; uses Tesla press release.  
3. Statista (Oct-02-2025) – Confirms a complete quarterly series through Q3 2025 but actual numbers are not visible; value mainly that it corroborates existence of a standard dataset.  Quality: Medium.  
4. Yahoo Finance (Jan-31-2026) – Gives Q4 2025 deliveries 418 227 and colour on earnings.  Quality: High for the headline number, again sourced from Tesla IR.  
5. Dealership Guy (Dec-31-2025) – Provides analyst consensus for Q4 2025 (422 850) that came close to the later actual 418 227.  Quality: Medium; useful as a yard-stick for how expectations track reality.  
6. Electrek (Jan-28-2026) – Q4 2025 earnings recap; no hard delivery data beyond what is already known.  Quality: Medium.  
7. Agent report – Collates Tesla-released delivery numbers 2022-2025 and cites a single press-reported 2026 annual goal of 1.75 million deliveries.  Quality: Good for historic data; the 1.75 m goal is secondary and should be treated cautiously.

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. Tesla’s own Q1 deliveries for the past four years.  
2. Tesla’s deliveries in all quarters, 2022-2025 (16 points).  
3. Global BEV makers’ YoY Q1 growth rates (Tesla + BYD, etc.).  
Best fit: class 1 (Tesla Q1). It captures company-specific seasonality (Q1 is typically lower than Q4 because Shanghai exports are front-loaded and US/Europe demand ebbs after year-end incentives).

c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 2 Feb 2026.  • Outcome known: early-April press release (≈60 days away).  
• Past pattern – Tesla Q1 vs preceding Q4:  
  2022: -24 %  | 2023: -13 %  | 2024: -22 %  | 2025: -20 %  
  Average drop = -19 %.  
• Past YoY change (Q1 vs prior-year Q1):  
  2023: +37 %  | 2024: -9 %  | 2025: -13 %  
  Mean = ----------------> roughly ---------> +5 % to -11 % swing is common.

d) Justification for outside-view point estimate  
Step 1: Start with naïve seasonal rule of thumb: Q1 deliveries ≈ Q4 previous year × (1 – 0.19).  
418 227 × 0.81 = 338 770.  
Step 2: Adjust for expected mild recovery: management’s soft target implies 1.75 m full-year deliveries (= +7 % YoY).  If growth is proportionally distributed, Q1 should be 336 681 × 1.07 ≈ 360 000.  
Step 3: Balance the two: (338 770 + 360 000)/2 ≈ 349 000.  Round to 350 000 as a base (median) value.  

Risk factors pushing low:  
• Continued European weakness, end of US tax credit, factory re-tooling for Cybercab prototype lines.  
Risk factors pushing high:  
• Inventory draw-down after weak Q4, first shipments of refreshed Model Y, bounce-back in China if January CPCA data (not yet available) shows growth.  

Outside view calibration:

Distribution choice – use a symmetric but fat-tailed PERT-like shape centred on 350 000 with σ ≈ 35 000 (10 %).  Historical surprises (e.g., Q3 2025 overshot by +29 %) suggest allocating 10th/90th percentiles roughly ±17 % from the median.

Outside View Prediction (vehicles):

Percentile 10: 300 000  
Percentile 20: 320 000  
Percentile 40: 340 000  
Percentile 60: 360 000  
Percentile 80: 400 000  
Percentile 90: 460 000
