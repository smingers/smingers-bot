Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, factual vs opinion)
   • Tesla IR press release 02-Jan-2026 – Q4-2025 production 434358 / deliveries 418227.  Primary, fully reliable, purely factual.  
   • CNBC & YahooFinance 02-Jan-2026 – repeat same numbers, add analyst expectations.  High quality; analyst commentary (opinion).  
   • CPCA data via Teslarati 15-Dec-2025 – China November retail 73145, order-backlog indicators.  Moderately reliable; factual registrations, speculative demand commentary.  
   • Electrek 05-Jan-2026 – Shanghai wholesale 97171 Dec-2025, trend commentary on China competition.  Factual production number, opinionated analysis.  
   • Gasgoo, Sina, Ifeng, etc. 29-Jan-2026 to 02-Feb-2026 – Tesla FY-2025 results, cap-ex pivot to Optimus / Robotaxi.  All quote Tesla 28-Jan-2026 earnings call (primary) → factual; strategic commentary is opinion.  
   • All AskNews robotics-pivot articles – describe Model S/X phase-out (from Tesla call).  Dates and numbers consistent; good for context, but vehicle-delivery impact after Q2-2026 (not Q1).  
   • No 2026 guidance for Q1 deliveries issued; only scattered analyst projections (~1.75 M full-year) – single-source, forward-looking, therefore weak evidence.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight to Q1-2026 deliveries)
   Strong:  
   • Historical Tesla Q1 seasonality: in last four years Q1 < prior Q4 by 13-32 % (structural shipping/incentive pattern).  
   • Confirmed Q4-2025 actual 418227 (anchor for seasonal adjustment).  
   Moderate:  
   • China December wholesale near max capacity ⇒ little hidden inventory for Q1; CPCA tax-credit pull-forward ⇒ possible softer January demand.  
   • New cheaper Model Y Standard (launched Oct-2025) could add incremental volume (order-book evidence, Teslarati).  
   • Analyst consensus for 2026 full-year ~1.7-1.8 M (implies slight rebound).  
   Weak:  
   • Fremont re-tooling, Model S/X sunset—start Q2, minimal Q1 effect.  
   • Macro headlines on BYD, subsidies, U.S. politics – noisy, hard to quantify for a 90-day horizon.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Resolution in ~60 days.  Only January global registrations are partially known; February/March production can still swing outcome.  
   • If horizon were halved (30 days, before February data) I would widen 90-10 interval by ~10 %.  If doubled (120 days) most deliveries already booked; interval would narrow by ~20 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view base: Q1 deliveries ≈ Q4 previous year × (1 – 19 % 4-yr mean drop) → 338000.  
   Inside adjustments:  
     +5 % for modest recovery from unusually weak Q1-2025 and cheaper Model Y (+17000).  
     –3 % for China tax-credit pull-forward, Europe softness (-10000).  
   Net median ≈ 345000-350000.  
   Historical surprise band (~±25 %) retained for tails because Tesla occasionally over- or under-ships inventories.

Probability calibration
Implied mean (numerically integrating piece-wise linear CDF) ≈ 362000; median = 350000 – consistent with justification and prior pattern.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Tesla global vehicle deliveries reported for Q1 2026, units, press-release before 01-May-2026.  
2. Outside view base = 338000.  
3. Consistency: median 350000; mean 362000; plausible versus factors cited.  
4. Key evidence: Q4-2025 actual 418227; 4-yr Q1 seasonality -19 %; China Dec near max output; tax-credit pull-forward; new low-cost Model Y demand.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected March export surge from Shanghai (post-holiday) pushing deliveries >430000 (upward risk).
