   - This represents a **13% decline** from Q1 2024
   - The decline was approximately **50,000 fewer vehicles** compared to the prior-year period
   - This marks Tesla's **largest decline in deliveries in history**
   - Tesla logged its **lowest quarter since 2022**

   - Stock peaked at **$479** after Trump's election win
   - Stock has since fallen **48%** from that peak

### Named Source Opinions:

1. **Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities analyst** (via Reuters): "We are not going to look at these numbers with rose-colored glasses… they were a disaster on every metric. The Street and us knew a bad 1 Q was coming but this was even worse than expected."

2. **Elon Musk** (March 30 statement, via Quartz): 
   - "What they're trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don't know, stop doing this."
   - "My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it's a big deal."
   - "Long term I think Tesla stock's going to do fine, so maybe it's a buying opportunity."

### Additional Context:

- **NBC survey results**: 46% of voters view DOGE creation positively, while 47% have negative perception of DOGE and 51% have negative perception of Musk
- The article attributes lower sales partly to **declining sales in Europe** and **growing competition from China**

## Summary of Statista Article on Tesla Quarterly Deliveries

**Source:** Statista (data sourced from Tesla)
**Publication Date:** October 2, 2025
**Data Coverage:** Q1 2016 through Q3 2025

### Key Information:

**Facts and Statistics:**
- The article presents a chart/graph showing "Number of Tesla vehicles delivered worldwide from 1st quarter 2016 to 3rd quarter 2025 (in 1,000 units)"
- Data extends through Q3 2025 (the most recent quarter available as of the article's publication date)

### Limitations:

**Disclaimer:** The extracted web content appears to be primarily formatting and citation information from a Statista page rather than the actual data visualization or specific numerical values. The article references a graph/chart that would contain the historical quarterly delivery figures, but the specific numbers for each quarter (including recent quarters like Q3 2025, Q2 2025, Q1 2025, and Q4 2024) are not visible in the extracted text. 

To be useful for forecasting Q1 2026 deliveries, the forecaster would need to access the actual Statista page to view:
- The specific delivery numbers for recent quarters (Q1-Q3 2025 and Q4 2024)
- Any trend patterns visible in the historical data
- Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth rates

The article confirms that Tesla data through Q3 2025 is available, but the extracted content does not contain the actual numerical delivery figures that would be most relevant for making a Q1 2026 forecast.

Query: Retrieve Tesla quarterly global vehicle deliveries 2022 to 2025 and any 2026 guidance
Below is a consolidated picture of Tesla’s reported global vehicle deliveries by quarter from 2022 through 2025, followed by the only publicly-reported delivery guidance that could be located for 2026.

1. 2022 – Reported quarterly deliveries (global)
   • Q1 2022: 310,048 vehicles (Tesla press release data reproduced by CNBC and InsideEVs) [CNBC Apr-02-2022; InsideEVs]
   • Q2 2022: 254,695 vehicles (GlobalData article; identical figure carried in YCharts dataset) [GlobalData]
   • Q3 2022: 343,830 vehicles (YCharts/Fiscal.ai series) [YCharts]
   • Q4 2022: 405,278 vehicles (YCharts/Fiscal.ai series) [YCharts]

2. 2023 – Reported quarterly deliveries
   • Q1 2023: 422,875 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q2 2023: 466,140 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q3 2023: 435,059 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q4 2023: 484,507 vehicles [YCharts]

3. 2024 – Reported quarterly deliveries
   • Q1 2024: 386,810 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q3 2024: 462,890 vehicles (also cited by CNBC Oct-02-2025 recap) [YCharts; CNBC Oct-02-2025]
   • Q4 2024: 495,570 vehicles (Tesla Q4/2024 production & delivery release summarised by CNBC Jan-02-2025) [CNBC Jan-02-2025; YCharts]

4. 2025 – Reported quarterly deliveries
   • Q1 2025: 336,681 vehicles [YCharts]
   • Q2 2025: 384,122 vehicles (CNBC Oct-02-2025 article and YCharts) [CNBC Oct-02-2025; YCharts]
   • Q3 2025: 497,099 vehicles (company release covered by CNBC Oct-02-2025 and YCharts) [CNBC Oct-02-2025; YCharts]
   • Q4 2025: 418,227 vehicles (official Q4/2025 release cited by Yahoo Finance Jan-02-2026 and Tridens blog; figure also appears as latest datapoint in YCharts series) [Yahoo Finance Jan-02-2026; Tridens Feb-01-2026; YCharts]

For ease of reference, the same figures are tabulated:

Year | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Full-year total*
2022 | 310,048 | 254,695 | 343,830 | 405,278 | 1,313,851  
2023 | 422,875 | 466,140 | 435,059 | 484,507 | 1,808,581  
2024 | 386,810 | 443,956 | 462,890 | 495,570 | 1,789,226  
2025 | 336,681 | 384,122 | 497,099 | 418,227 | 1,636,129  

*Full-year totals use the quarterly sums and match annual numbers cited by CNBC (2024) and Tridens (2025).

Source summary: Quarterly data from 2022–2025 are drawn primarily from Tesla’s own production & delivery press releases as republished by CNBC, InsideEVs, GlobalData and Tridens, and from the Fiscal.ai/YCharts “Tesla Total Deliveries” time-series which reflects the same press-release figures. Where duplicate sources exist, the overlapping values are identical, indicating internal consistency.

5. 2026 – Any publicly stated delivery guidance
   • The only explicit quantitative target located is contained in a 1 Jan 2026 MarketMinute/FinancialContent report summarising Tesla’s late-December 2025 “2026 Forecast”.  The article says Tesla is “betting that a favourable federal environment will accelerate…with a target of 1.75 million deliveries” in 2026. [FinancialContent Jan-01-2026]
   • No quarterly breakdown or official SEC-filed guidance has been reported.  CNBC’s 28 Jan 2026 earnings coverage, Yahoo Finance and TradingView pieces reviewed after the Q4/2025 earnings call make no mention of new quantitative 2026 delivery guidance beyond the narrative that Tesla expects a “return to growth” once Cybercab and the refreshed manufacturing lines ramp. [CNBC Jan-28-2026; TradingView Jan-28-2026]

Assessment of information completeness and gaps
• 2022–2025: All four quarters in each year are documented with consistent numerical values from multiple sources; the dataset appears complete.
• 2026: Only an annual goal (1.75 million) from secondary reporting is available.  Tesla has not yet published an Investor Relations deck or SEC filing that formalises quarterly or annual delivery guidance for 2026.  Therefore:
  – There is no firm company-issued number in an 8-K, shareholder deck or earnings call transcript.  
  – No quarterly splits, production assumptions or range (e.g., “20–30 % growth”) have been provided publicly.

Do we need more searches?
Given the uniformity of quarterly delivery figures in the YCharts series and confirmation by multiple news outlets, additional searching is unlikely to uncover different numbers for 2022–2025.  The real gap is an official Tesla document (shareholder deck, earnings call transcript) that states 2026 guidance.  If that material exists, it was not surfaced in the current results.  A targeted follow-up search nearer to or after Tesla’s 2025 Form 10-K filing—or the next quarterly investor deck—would be required once those documents are released.

Conclusion
• Quarterly global delivery numbers for 2022 through 2025 are complete and provided above.
• The only 2026 guidance presently in the public domain is a press-reported goal of approximately 1.75 million deliveries for the year; Tesla has not issued detailed or quarterly guidance yet.  Stakeholders should monitor Tesla’s first-quarter 2026 investor materials for the first formal update.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
