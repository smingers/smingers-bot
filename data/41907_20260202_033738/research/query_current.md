Analysis:
The key to estimating Q1-2026 Tesla deliveries is understanding both 1) the starting point (Q4-2025 global deliveries and current installed capacity) and 2) how those numbers are likely to change over the next 90 days. The most relevant near-dated information therefore includes:

• Tesla’s Q4-2025 “Production & Deliveries” press release – sets the latest base run-rate.  
• Any commentary from the late-January 2026 Q4-2025 earnings call – management guidance on production constraints, demand, and seasonality.  
• January 2026 weekly China insurance-registration data and preliminary CPCA sales – China is ~45 % of Tesla’s volume and shows immediate post-price-cut demand.  
• News on Fremont, Austin, Berlin and Shanghai line-rate increases or downtime; status of the Nuevo León (Mexico) plant and whether initial Model 2/Y volumes begin before end-Q1.  
• Macro/competitor signals: further U.S. IRA credit step-downs, EU tariffs, and additional price cuts by BYD, VW, or GM that might force Tesla’s hand and affect order intake.  
• Sell-side preview notes (e.g., Morgan Stanley, RBC, Deutsche Bank) updating delivery forecasts after the earnings call and January sales prints.

Collecting this information will give an inside view on production capacity, demand elasticity after recent price moves, and likely seasonal drop-off from Q4 to Q1 (historically –6 % to –12 %). With Q4-2025 reportedly near 535 k, an unchanged seasonal pattern implies roughly 470-505 k; upside would come from Mexico-pilot or Berlin Phase-2 volumes, downside from extended retooling in Shanghai or demand softness in China/Europe. Current news articles addressing these exact points are therefore essential.
