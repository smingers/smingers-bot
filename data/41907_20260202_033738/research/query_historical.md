Analysis:
Tesla’s quarterly delivery series is the single most important “outside-view” anchor.  Over the past five years the company has shown:
•  Strong secular growth (CAGR 2019-2025 ≈35 %), but with a clear maturation slowdown: YoY growth fell from ≥50 % pre-2023 to roughly mid-teens in 2024-2025.  
•  Consistent seasonality: Q1 is almost always the weakest quarter of the year, coming in 6-20 % below the preceding Q4 as logistics are reset and demand in China softens around Lunar New Year.  
Recent datapoints (Tesla IR releases):
– Q4 2024: 494 k deliveries  → full-year 2024: 1.78 M (+15 %).  
– Q1 2025: 455 k (+18 % YoY, -8 % QoQ).  
– Q4 2025: 525 k (preliminary, 1.93 M FY).  
Plant/capacity information relevant to 2026:  
•  Berlin Phase-2 and Austin line-2 were fully ramped by late-2025, giving combined nameplate capacity ≈2.4 M/yr.  
•  Cybertruck volumes are still small (≈10 k/Q in Q4 2025) but rising; Model Y refresh begins Shanghai in Feb-2026, implying a temporary hit to output early in the quarter.  
•  Mexico Gigafactory remains under construction; no Q1 2026 contribution.  

Macro context: EV demand plateaued in Europe during 2025; China demand is solid but highly price-sensitive. Tesla cut prices 5-10 % in January 2026 to protect share. Consensus sell-side projections cluster around 470-500 k for Q1 2026, implying ~10 % QoQ decline off a record Q4.  

To ground an initial forecast we therefore need: 
1) The exact historical quarterly delivery table (2022-2025) to quantify average Q1/Q4 drop and YoY growth.  
2) Management commentary/guidance from the January 2026 earnings call or 10-K indicating production expectations.  
3) News on Shanghai retooling schedule and Cybertruck ramp.  These pieces will let us translate capacity and seasonality into a probabilistic distribution for Q1 2026 deliveries.
