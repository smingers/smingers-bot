The decline was primarily driven by a shrinking core automotive business: Q4 vehicle deliveries fell 16% year-over-year to 418,227 units, and annual deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1,636,129 units. CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will phase out production of the Model S and Model X starting in the next quarter, with final units produced at the Fremont factory in California, as the company shifts focus toward a future centered on autonomous driving. As part of its strategic transformation, Musk revealed plans to launch the third-generation Optimus humanoid robot in Q1 2026, the first design intended for mass production. The Fremont factory's former Model S/X production lines will be retooled for Optimus, with dedicated production lines expected to begin operations by the end of 2026, aiming for a long-term annual capacity of 1 million units. Tesla plans to produce 50,000 to 100,000 Optimus robots in 2026, with enterprise deliveries starting in the second half of 2026 and public sales launching in 2027. To support these long-term initiatives, Tesla plans capital expenditures exceeding $20 billion in 2026\u2014more than double the 2025 level of $8.5 billion\u2014allocated across up to six new factory projects, Optimus R&D and production readiness, and AI infrastructure. Musk stated that Tesla is the only company currently capable of mastering the three core pillars of humanoid robotics: replicating human hand dexterity, achieving real-world AI capabilities, and enabling mass production. He acknowledged China as Tesla\u2019s biggest competitor in humanoid robotics, citing China\u2019s strength in mass manufacturing and AI, but emphasized that the third-generation Optimus leads in intelligence,\u673a\u7535\u7075\u5de7\u6027 (mechanical dexterity), and especially in hand design. Additionally, Tesla announced plans to build its own TeraFab chip factory to secure supply for autonomous driving and robotics, including logic chips, memory chips, and packaging. Tesla also signed a framework agreement to invest approximately $2 billion in AI company xAI, aiming to strengthen its ability to develop and deploy AI products into the physical world. Musk described 2026 as a year of unprecedented capital investment, positioning Tesla for a '\u53f2\u8bd7\u822c\u7684 future' (epic future).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:27 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001901ykvk.html)\n\n**Blue Whale Finance: 2026 a Pivotal Year for Global L4 Autonomous Driving Commercialization**\nOn January 21, 2026, the media outlet Blue Whale Finance reported that a Huatai Securities research note indicated the U.S. House of Representatives was set to debate the 'SELF DRIVE Act of 2026' on January 13, 2026. The proposed legislation aims to raise the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) exemption cap from 2,500 to 90,000 vehicles and establish federal preemption, marking a rare bipartisan consensus and potentially breaking a decade-long legislative deadlock. Concurrently, Waymo's weekly order volume has reached 450,000 rides, and Tesla's Cybercab is expected to begin mass production in April 2026, signaling that the U.S. robotaxi market is entering a phase of large-scale expansion. Huatai Securities believes 2026 will be a pivotal year for global L4-level autonomous driving commercialization, with the U.S. federal regulatory framework becoming clearer, China advancing L3-level pilot programs, and L4 commercialization accelerating. The report recommends focusing on key players in the autonomous driving supply chain.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:23 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7879848900_1d5acf3c401902pjiy.html)\n\n**BYD Sales Drop by Nearly a Third at Start of 2026 Amid Global Expansion Plans**\nBYD, the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, reported a 30.1% decline in vehicle sales in January 2026 compared to the same month in 2025, dropping to 210,051 units. This marks the fifth consecutive month of declining sales. The company also reduced production by 29.1% during the same period. Despite the domestic downturn, international sales remained a bright spot, with 100,482 vehicles exported in January. BYD aims to export 1.3 million vehicles in 2026, a 24% increase from 2025, though this falls short of the previously projected 1.6 million. The company plans to expand its global footprint with a new factory in Hungary, scheduled to begin operations this year. In 2025, BYD surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer due to strong overseas sales.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:33 PM\nSource:[www.kleinezeitung.at](https://www.kleinezeitung.at/wirtschaft/20537823/chinesische-elektroautobauer-byd-absatz-bricht-zum-jahresauftakt-ein)\n\n**After 23 Years, Tesla\u2019s First Chapter Ends: The Shift from Electric Vehicles to AI and Robotics**\nTesla reported its Q4 2025 financial results after U.S. market close on February 28, 2026, with total revenue of $24.901 billion, a 3.1% year-over-year decline, slightly above analysts' pessimistic expectations. Operating profit was $1.409 billion, and Non-GAAP EPS reached $0.50, slightly below estimates. The company's narrative has shifted from its original 'new energy vehicle' story to a focus on AI-driven future ventures: Robotaxi, Optimus, and AI Infrastructure, following its investment in xAI. This marks the likely conclusion of Tesla's first chapter, established since its 2003 founding and shaped by Elon Musk's leadership. In the 'old world,' vehicle sales declined to $17.7 billion (down 10.6% YoY), with 418,200 vehicles delivered\u2014down 15% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year\u2014due to subsidy reductions. However, vehicle gross margin reached a 2023 Q1 high, supported by higher-margin markets like Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Model S/X production will cease to free capacity for Optimus III. The energy business performed strongly, with $3.837 billion in revenue (up 25.4% YoY) and a 360-basis-point gross margin improvement, contributing to overall profitability. FSD penetration reached 12.4% (1.1 million units), up from 10.96% in Q4 2024, with a shift to subscription model expected to drive long-term growth despite short-term margin pressure. In the 'new world,' Robotaxi deployed 500+ vehicles in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area by year-end\u2014slightly behind earlier projections. Optimus V3 prototype is scheduled for Q1 2026, but production ramp-up will be gradual, with 2026 full-scale production still targeted. Tesla plans a $20 billion capital expenditure in 2026\u2014double 2025\u2019s\u2014focusing on new factories for Robotaxi, Optimus, and LFP batteries. Elon Musk also announced plans to build a domestic semiconductor fab, citing AI chip shortages and geopolitical risks, though this is not included in the $20 billion budget. Overall, Tesla is transitioning from a physical product company to a 'bit world' entity, with future value dependent on investor confidence in Musk\u2019s vision. The company is now in a transitional phase, where current financials no longer reflect future potential.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:04 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-01/doc-inhkhscn8993307.shtml)\n\n**Tesla's 2026: An Existential Bet on the Future of Physical AI**\nTesla's 2025 financial report revealed its first annual revenue decline, with total revenue falling to $94.827 billion, a 3% drop year-on-year, and net profit plummeting 46%. Despite a global vehicle delivery volume of 1.636 million units\u2014down 8.6% and overtaken by BYD's 2.26 million\u2014Tesla announced a strategic pivot: discontinuing the Model S and Model X by the end of Q2 2026 to prioritize the production of its humanoid robot, Optimus. This move coincided with a record-breaking $20 billion in capital expenditure for 2026\u2014over five times Tesla\u2019s 2025 net profit\u2014allocated to AI chips, supercomputing clusters, robotics, and energy storage. While automotive revenue declined by 10% to $69.526 billion, energy business revenue rose 26.6% to $12.8 billion, and FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions reached 1.1 million users, a 40% increase, accounting for about 12% of total deliveries. FSD\u2019s cumulative driving distance exceeded 7 billion miles by year-end, with 1 billion miles added in Q4 alone. Tesla also advanced its AI chip roadmap with AI5 and AI6 chips expected in 2027 and 2028, respectively, and expanded its Cortex 2 compute cluster in Texas, doubling local compute capacity by mid-2026. The company redefined its mission as 'creating extraordinary abundance,' signaling a shift from an automaker to a 'physical AI company.' Analysts are divided: 30 of 50 recommend 'hold' or 'sell,' reflecting caution, while AI optimists see Tesla\u2019s value in data, algorithm velocity, and network effects. The company\u2019s stock initially dropped 3.45% after the report but rose 3.32% the next day amid broader tech sell-offs, reflecting market ambivalence. Tesla\u2019s strategy embodies a 'second curve' transition, leveraging synergies between car data, AI, energy, and robotics. The 'phase transition' in its business model is driven by a self-reinforcing loop: real-world data trains AI, which improves FSD, increases user adoption, and generates more data. The success of this transformation hinges on the speed and efficiency of AI commercialization, with Tesla betting on long-term industry leadership over short-term profitability. This represents a new value investment framework: valuing vision, ecosystem, and data assets over traditional metrics like margins and sales volume.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:04 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qMn5bUH1WC)\n\n**Tesla's 'Killing' of Model S/X: A $20 Billion Bet on Humanoid Robots**\nTesla has announced the permanent discontinuation of its Model S and Model X vehicles, marking a strategic pivot from being a luxury electric vehicle manufacturer to a leader in humanoid robotics. According to CEO Elon Musk during the Q4 2025 financial earnings call, production of the Model S and X will cease globally by 2026, with Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory in California transitioning into a super-production hub for the Optimus humanoid robot. This shift is part of a $20 billion+ annual capital expenditure plan aimed at achieving 'Amazing Abundance'\u2014a new corporate mission replacing the previous 'accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.' Musk has declared Optimus to be Tesla\u2019s 'greatest product' ever, surpassing even electric vehicles and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Tesla aims to produce 1 million Optimus units annually by 2027, with a target unit cost of $20,000. To support this, Tesla plans to build six new factories and expand its AI infrastructure centered on the Cortex supercomputer. A critical component of this strategy is the TeraFab 2nm chip fabrication plant, designed to achieve full vertical integration in semiconductor production\u2014addressing supply chain risks and geopolitical constraints. Musk emphasized, 'Without AI chips, Optimus is just a human-shaped model.' The company is also preparing to unveil the Optimus Gen 3 in Q1 2026, with production expected to begin by year-end. Despite the ambitious vision, Musk acknowledged the 'almost non-existent' supply chain for Optimus and warned of a 'painfully slow' ramp-up, potentially leading to negative free cash flow in 2026\u2014the first since 2018. The success of this transition hinges on the Gen 3\u2019s ability to achieve mass production and commercialization. This move signals Tesla\u2019s transformation into a technology company focused on AI, robotics, and physical AI systems, rather than traditional automotive manufacturing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 10:34 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5953741034_162dee0ea0670351o0.html)\n\n**Musk, Exposed on Major Move: Building a 'Tech Superpower'**\nElon Musk may be creating a 'tech superpower' by integrating Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. According to Reuters, SpaceX is exploring a potential merger with Tesla and deepening strategic collaboration with AI startup xAI. If realized, this integration would combine rocket launch capabilities, Starlink satellite networks, electric vehicles, social media platforms, and generative AI technologies into a global 'super ecosystem.' On January 30, Tesla's stock rose over 3%, making it one of only two companies among the US tech seven to gain that day. SpaceX is reportedly considering an IPO in June 2026, aiming to raise $50 billion, which could value the company at $1.5 trillion\u2014making it the largest IPO in history, surpassing Saudi Aramco\u2019s $29 billion in 2019. As of 2025, SpaceX has completed over 300 Falcon 9 launches and deployed more than 10,000 Starlink satellites. In 2025 alone, SpaceX conducted about 170 launches (165 Falcon 9, 5 Starship), setting a record. Starlink now has over 9 million users and covers over 155 countries, with potential reach to 3.2 billion people. SpaceX has reduced launch costs to under $1,500 per kg for Falcon 9, with projections to drop to under $200/kg by 2030, enabling commercial space computing. Meanwhile, Tesla reported a 3% year-on-year revenue decline in 2025, totaling $94.827 billion, with a net profit of $3.8 billion, down 46%. However, Tesla\u2019s energy storage installations reached 46.7 gigawatt-hours in 2025, up 48.7%, with Q4 installations hitting 14.2 gigawatt-hours\u2014both record highs. Musk revealed that Tesla\u2019s third-generation humanoid robot, set for release in Q1 2026, will feature advanced hand design and resemble a human closely. The Fremont factory\u2019s Model S/X line will be converted into a robot production line, with full-scale production expected by end-2026 and a planned annual capacity of 1 million units. The robot has a fully independent supply chain based on first-principles design, leading to a longer ramp-up phase than vehicle production.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:28 AM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](https://stcn.com/article/detail/3623920.html)\n\n**Tesla\u2019s 2025 Net Profit Halved: Model S/X to Be Discontinued, Musk Says Chinese Robots Are Strongest Rivals**\nTesla reported its Q4 and full-year 2025 financial results on January 29, 2026, revealing a revenue of approximately $94.8 billion, a 3% year-on-year decline\u2014the first annual revenue drop in the company's history. GAAP net profit fell to $3.8 billion, a 46% decrease, primarily due to reduced vehicle deliveries, lower regulatory subsidy income, and a negative impact from changes in the fair value of Bitcoin holdings. In 2025, Tesla delivered 1.6361 million vehicles, a decline of 8.55% year-on-year, with China accounting for 626,000 units, down 4.8% from the prior year. CEO Elon Musk expressed minimal concern over the automotive business downturn, emphasizing Tesla\u2019s strategic shift from an automaker to a robotics company. In Q2 2026, Tesla will discontinue production of the Model S and Model X at its Fremont, California factory, replacing the assembly line with one for the Optimus (Tesla Bot) humanoid robot, with a long-term goal of producing 1 million units annually at the site. The Model S, launched in 2012, and the Model X, launched in 2015, were already unavailable for new orders on Tesla\u2019s Chinese website starting April 2025. Tesla\u2019s vehicle engineering vice president, Lars Moravec, stated that the company should now be viewed as a provider of 'Transportation as a Service' (TaaS), not just a car manufacturer. The company plans to launch various Robotaxi models, with the CyberCab\u2014designed as a two-seater without a steering wheel or pedals\u2014targeting 90% of common travel scenarios. CyberCab is scheduled for mass production in April 2026, with Tesla aiming to create an Airbnb-like platform allowing owners to monetize their autonomous vehicles. Musk predicted CyberCab output would eventually surpass the combined total of all other Tesla vehicle models. Optimus, first unveiled in October 2022, entered pilot production in 2025. Tesla aims to produce 50,000 to 100,000 units in 2026. Musk stated that the third-generation Optimus 'minimizes differences from humans, making it easily mistaken for a person,' which supports Tesla\u2019s AI strategy by enabling robots to learn human tasks more efficiently. According to GGII Energy Research Institute, global humanoid robot sales are projected to reach 12,400 units in 2025, with a market size of 6.339 billion yuan; by 2030, sales could reach 340,000 units and the market size exceed 64 billion yuan; by 2035, sales could exceed 5 million units and the market size surpass 400 billion yuan. Musk acknowledged that China poses the strongest competition in humanoid robotics, citing Chinese firms' rapid scale-up capabilities and high AI proficiency, though he asserted Optimus will outperform any currently known Chinese robot in development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:50 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1641561812_61d83ed402701bdt8.html)\n\n**Musk to Accelerate Robotics Push: Third-Gen Optimus Set for 2026, Tesla Shifts Focus from Cars to AI and Robots**\nTesla's Q4 2025 revenue was $24.9 billion, a 3.1% decline from the previous year, with full-year revenue of approximately $96.7 billion, marking the first annual revenue drop. This decline is attributed to shrinking core automotive sales: 418,227 vehicles delivered in Q4 2025, down 16% year-on-year, and 1,636,129 vehicles delivered annually, down 8.6%, the first annual delivery decline. In response, Elon Musk announced a strategic pivot toward robotics and AI, stating that 2026 capital expenditures will be 'very large.' Tesla plans to phase out Model S and Model X production, repurposing the Fremont factory for the large-scale production of the third-generation Optimus humanoid robot, with mass production expected by year-end 2026. The company confirmed in the earnings call that it is streamlining its car lineup and allocating $20 billion in 2026 to robotics and autonomous driving. Tesla will simultaneously upgrade factory capacity, expand AI infrastructure, and scale production of Optimus and autonomous Robotaxi vehicles. The third-generation Optimus, described as 'our first design intended for mass production,' will be officially launched in Q1 2026. Despite the optimism, Tesla's 2025 target of producing 5,000 Optimus units was not met\u2014only a few hundred were produced, and they did not meet factory operational standards. While progress has been made in dynamic balance and dexterous hand development, the robot still relies on remote control for autonomous operation; earlier demos showed difficulty navigating open corridors. Key bottlenecks remain in dexterous hand mass production and supply chain readiness. Analysts, including Alexander Potter from Piper Sandler, argue that 'delivery volume is almost irrelevant now,' and Tesla's 2026 performance will be driven by AI and robotics advancements. At the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk stated that public sales of Optimus will begin in 2027, with enterprise deliveries starting in second half 2026. He claimed the robot would transform Tesla into a $25 trillion robotics company, with robotics value far exceeding current operations. Analysts from Dongfang Securities believe the robot supply chain will accelerate, boosting industry sentiment. As volumes rise, robot prices are expected to fall, increasing cost-effectiveness and benefiting companies with proven manufacturing and management capabilities in automotive and industrial sectors. Guolian Minsheng Securities recommends focusing on Tesla's production progress and technology evolution as the core theme, with particular attention to hardware segments showing significant marginal improvements: dexterous hands, PC/ABS exoskeletons, RV-like actuators, lightweight materials, and precision joints.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:35 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001901w4do.html)\n\n**Tesla Shifts Focus from Cars to Robotics Amid China Competition**\nTesla, the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, announced on January 28, 2025, a strategic pivot toward robotics, ceasing production of its high-end Model S and Model X vehicles at its California plant. The space will be reconfigured to produce the humanoid robot Optimus, marking a major shift in the company's trajectory under CEO Elon Musk. Musk stated the goal is to achieve one million Optimus robots annually at the Fremont factory, aligning with Tesla's vision of an 'autonomous future.' This move comes amid significant challenges in the electric vehicle market: Tesla reported a 3% revenue decline in 2025 to US$94.8 billion, its first annual drop in five years, and lost its global EV leadership to China's BYD, which saw nearly 28% growth in battery-electric vehicle deliveries, reaching 2.3 million units in 2025. Tesla's vehicle deliveries fell to 1.6 million in 2025, a 9% decrease from 2024. The company's net profit contracted by 26% year-on-year to US$5.9 billion in 2025. Despite this, Tesla plans to increase capital expenditures to over US$20 billion in 2026, heavily investing in artificial intelligence and robotics. Following the announcement, Tesla's stock rose approximately 2%. Musk warned that China is a formidable competitor in the humanoid robotics sector, stating, 'Hasta donde sabemos, hoy no vemos competidores significativos fuera de China, pero China definitivamente ser\u00e1 un competidor muy duro, no hay dos maneras de verlo.' Tesla also launched the supervised version of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in South Korea in Q4 2025, with customers logging over one million kilometers in a single month. However, regulatory approval for FSD in China remains pending. Tesla's Shanghai factory delivered 851,732 vehicles in 2025, a 7.1% decline from 2024, with domestic sales dropping 4.8% to 625,698 units, underscoring the need for diversification into new technological frontiers like robotics and autonomy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:24 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/autos/la-automotriz-que-deja-de-fabricar-autos-para-competirle-a-china-en-otro-frente-nid30012026/)\n\n**Elon Musk Shifts Tesla\u2019s Focus to Humanoid Robots and Robotaxis Amid Financial and Strategic Reorientation**\nTesla has suspended production of its Model S and Model X vehicles starting in the second quarter of 2026, following a 10% decline in electric vehicle deliveries in 2025. The move marks a strategic shift under Elon Musk toward prioritizing the development of humanoid robots (Optimus) and autonomous robotaxis. These models now represent only 3% to 6% of Tesla\u2019s sales, with approximately 30,000 units sold in 2025. The company aims to free up assembly lines at its Fremont factory for Optimus production. This pivot comes amid financial challenges: Tesla reported a negative operating cash flow, a 15% drop in automotive revenue, and an operating margin of just 4.6%\u2014down from previous levels\u2014due to fierce competition, especially from Chinese firms like BYD, and the end of U.S. EV subsidies. Tesla\u2019s net profit fell 61% in the fourth quarter to $840 million. To fund its new vision, Tesla plans to increase capital expenditures from $8.5 billion to over $20 billion in 2026, nearly double analyst expectations. The company will rely on software subscriptions for Full Self-Driving (FSD) at $99/month and revenue-sharing from robotaxis. Tesla also announced a $2 billion investment in xAI, Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup, which has raised $20 billion. SpaceX is considering a $50 billion fundraising round, potentially the largest IPO in history, with plans to deploy orbital data centers. Despite these ambitions, challenges remain: Tesla delivered only 150 Optimus robots in 2025\u2014far below its initial target of 5,000\u2014and human-piloted demos were reported in late 2024. The FSD system is under investigation by the U.S. NHTSA for safety concerns, and only 1.1 million of Tesla\u2019s 8.9 million vehicles have active FSD. Tesla aims to begin fully driverless taxi operations in Austin and launch Optimus for sale by late 2027.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:54 PM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/innovation/pour-entrer-dans-l-ere-des-robots-humanoides-et-des-robotaxis-elon-musk-arrete-la-production-de-deux-de-ses-modeles-de-tesla_AV-202601300796.html)\n\n**Tesla to Discontinue Model S/X by Q2 2026, Accelerate Shift to 'Physical World AI' Company**\nTesla's 2025 annual financial report, released on January 28, 2026, revealed its first-ever annual decline in both sales and revenue since going public, with global vehicle deliveries dropping to 1.6361 million units (down 8.6% year-on-year) and total revenue falling to $94.827 billion (down 3%). GAAP net profit declined sharply to $3.8 billion, a 46% drop from 2024. The decline was attributed to weak global demand, tighter credit conditions, higher tariffs, increased fixed costs, and significant R&D spending on AI and new products including Cybercab, Semi, Optimus, and Megapack. Despite challenges in automotive sales, Tesla's energy and service businesses grew strongly: energy revenue rose 26.6% to $12.8 billion, driven by Megapack and Powerwall, which enabled over 89,000 virtual power plant events and saved users approximately $1 billion in electricity costs. FSD subscription users reached 1.1 million (up 40%), becoming a key growth driver. In China, Tesla's retail sales fell 4.8% to 626,000 units, pressured by domestic brands like BYD offering better pricing and smart features, while Tesla's FSD remained unapproved. The company plans to discontinue Model S and Model X by the end of Q2 2026, redirecting the Fremont factory to produce Optimus robots, with a long-term goal of 1 million units annually. Tesla is accelerating its transition to a 'physical world AI company' through $9 billion in 2025 capital spending and a planned $20 billion+ in 2026, investing in AI infrastructure, new factories, and the development of AI5 (2027) and AI6 (2028) chips. The Cybercab, a fully autonomous two-seater without steering wheels, is set for mass production in April 2026. Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service, launched in Austin with over 500 vehicles, has received positive feedback, and FSD V14 is expected to enable large-scale deployment in major U.S. cities by late 2025. The company is also building the Terafab trillion-dollar wafer fab to vertically integrate logic chips, memory, and packaging, reducing reliance on external suppliers. According to AI researcher Yang Tong, Tesla\u2019s unique global fleet data and engineering capabilities give it a competitive edge in robotics, though general-purpose humanoid intelligence still requires fundamental breakthroughs. Analyst Zhou Yue noted that Tesla is accepting short-term profit pressure to secure long-term growth by shifting from a car-centric model to a diversified tech company focused on AI, software, energy, and robotics.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:53 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1838672663_6d97eb1702001lnq2.html)\n\n**Tesla 2025 Financial Report: Global EV Production Reaches 1.655 Million, Deliveries Hit 1.636 Million**\nTesla has released its Q4 2025 and full-year financial results, reporting global production of approximately 1.655 million electric vehicles (EVs) and deliveries of 1.636 million EVs.

Q4 2025 deliveries hit 497k (beat estimates), but annual deliveries fell to ~1.64M (down 9% YoY) [7][9][11].\n\n2. **Factory Capacity Updates**:  \n   - **Fremont (California)**: Transitioning from cars to Optimus robots [1][6][15].  \n   - **Giga Texas**: Starting **Cybercab robotaxi production in April 2026**, with slow initial ramp [14][19][20].  \n   - **Giga Berlin**: Producing ~250k vehicles/year, focusing on exports to avoid tariffs [17].  \n   - **Giga Nevada**: New Semi line (50k units/year) launching 2026 [15][19].\n\n### 2026 Delivery Guidance and Challenges\n- **Ambiguous Vehicle Targets**: No formal 2026 delivery guidance exists, but analysts project ~1.75M vehicles (up 6.7% YoY) amid falling market share (4.8% in China) [3][15][16].  \n- **Robotaxi/Optimus Timelines**:  \n  - **Optimus**: Consumer sales expected late 2026, but production will be \"agonizingly slow\" initially [12][14]. Pilot units are being tested in factories [6][19].  \n  - **Robotaxis**: Fleet expansion to 7 U.S. cities by end-2026, pending regulatory approval [1][10][12]. Current fleet: ~500 vehicles in Austin/San Francisco [1][8].  \n- **Major Headwinds**:  \n  - **Competition**: BYD surpassed Tesla globally (2.26M BEVs in 2025), while Chinese robotics firms threaten Optimus [3][7][16].  \n  - **Financial Strain**: $20B capex for robotics/AI in 2026 (doubling 2025) amid falling margins (operating margin: 4.6% in Q4 2025) [4][8][9].  \n  - **Execution Risks**: History of missed timelines (e.g., Optimus targets delayed repeatedly) [14][18].\n\n### Conflicting Perspectives\n- **Bull Case**: Wedbush projects $2T-$3T market cap by 2026 if robotics/autonomy succeed [1][14]. FSD Gen 3 launch (Feb 2026) could catalyze robotaxi growth [11].  \n- **Bear Case**: Critics call the pivot \"desperate,\" citing falling automotive revenue (-10% YoY) and unproven robotics economics [4][9][18]. Optimus lacks real-world utility beyond prototypes [3][9].\n\n### Key Uncertainties\n1. **Regulatory Approval**: Full autonomy and robotaxi expansion hinge on unresolved U.S./EU regulations [10][12][19].  \n2. **Demand Viability**: No data validates Optimus/Cybercab commercial demand at scale [4][9][15].  \n3. **China Competition**: BYD/Geely dominate cost-efficient EV production, while China controls 80% of humanoid robot manufacturing [3][16].\n\n### Conclusion\nTesla's 2026 strategy prioritizes **robotics/autonomy over traditional vehicles**, with Fremont\u2019s capacity fully dedicated to Optimus and Giga Texas scaling robotaxis. Delivery guidance remains opaque, but the pivot risks further automotive declines while betting on unproven markets. Success hinges on overcoming regulatory hurdles, Chinese competition, and Tesla\u2019s execution flaws.\n\n**Weaknesses**: Reliance on speculative tech (Optimus/robotaxis), absence of concrete delivery targets, and unresolved factory underutilization (e.g., Berlin at 70% capacity) [15][17].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
