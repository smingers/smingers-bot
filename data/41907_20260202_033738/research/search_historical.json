The article says Tesla is \u201cbetting that a favourable federal environment will accelerate\u2026with a target of 1.75 million deliveries\u201d in 2026. [FinancialContent Jan-01-2026]\n   \u2022 No quarterly breakdown or official SEC-filed guidance has been reported.  CNBC\u2019s 28 Jan 2026 earnings coverage, Yahoo Finance and TradingView pieces reviewed after the Q4/2025 earnings call make no mention of new quantitative 2026 delivery guidance beyond the narrative that Tesla expects a \u201creturn to growth\u201d once Cybercab and the refreshed manufacturing lines ramp. [CNBC Jan-28-2026; TradingView Jan-28-2026]\n\nAssessment of information completeness and gaps\n\u2022 2022\u20132025: All four quarters in each year are documented with consistent numerical values from multiple sources; the dataset appears complete.\n\u2022 2026: Only an annual goal (1.75 million) from secondary reporting is available.  Tesla has not yet published an Investor Relations deck or SEC filing that formalises quarterly or annual delivery guidance for 2026.  Therefore:\n  \u2013 There is no firm company-issued number in an 8-K, shareholder deck or earnings call transcript.  \n  \u2013 No quarterly splits, production assumptions or range (e.g., \u201c20\u201330 % growth\u201d) have been provided publicly.\n\nDo we need more searches?\nGiven the uniformity of quarterly delivery figures in the YCharts series and confirmation by multiple news outlets, additional searching is unlikely to uncover different numbers for 2022\u20132025.  The real gap is an official Tesla document (shareholder deck, earnings call transcript) that states 2026 guidance.  If that material exists, it was not surfaced in the current results.  A targeted follow-up search nearer to or after Tesla\u2019s 2025 Form 10-K filing\u2014or the next quarterly investor deck\u2014would be required once those documents are released.\n\nConclusion\n\u2022 Quarterly global delivery numbers for 2022 through 2025 are complete and provided above.\n\u2022 The only 2026 guidance presently in the public domain is a press-reported goal of approximately 1.75 million deliveries for the year; Tesla has not issued detailed or quarterly guidance yet.  Stakeholders should monitor Tesla\u2019s first-quarter 2026 investor materials for the first formal update.</Agent_report>\n"
