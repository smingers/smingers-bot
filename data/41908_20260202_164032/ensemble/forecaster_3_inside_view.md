Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / what resolves
Resolves **Yes** if **between Feb 2, 2026 and before May 1, 2026** the WHO Director-General **officially declares a PHEIC** under IHR (2005) **in response to H5N1** (documented by WHO statement/EC report/news release or other credible sources). Otherwise **No**.

## (a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinion)

### WHO cumulative confirmed human cases (Jan 22, 2026) — who.int
- **Type/quality:** Primary WHO webpage; high reliability.  
- **Date:** 22 Jan 2026 (recent).
- **What it says (facts):** Describes WHO’s monthly reporting framework and IHR notification expectations for sporadic human infections.
- **What it does NOT say:** No signal of escalation (no EC, no DG statement, no changed risk).
- **Net relevance:** **Moderate** (confirms “routine monitoring,” not emergency footing).

### WHO WPRO avian influenza surveillance page — who.int (undated/ongoing page)
- **Type/quality:** WHO regional informational page; high reliability but mostly background.
- **What it says (facts):** Generally: avian influenza infections mostly zoonotic; not easy H2H; potential to mutate; ongoing monitoring.
- **Net relevance:** **Low to moderate** (supports “status quo = zoonotic/sporadic”).

### FAO “Global AIV with zoonotic potential” situation update (Jan 22, 2026) — fao.org
- **Type/quality:** UN FAO surveillance summary; high reliability on animal outbreak counts.
- **Date:** 22 Jan 2026.
- **Facts:** Large number of animal outbreaks/events globally; limited “human events” since prior update.
- **Net relevance:** **Moderate** (animal burden high, but doesn’t show a trigger typically required for WHO PHEIC).

### WHO fact sheet: Influenza (avian & other zoonotic) (Jan 21, 2026) — who.int
- **Type/quality:** WHO fact sheet; high reliability, but largely general.
- **Facts:** H5N1 widespread in birds/mammals; human cases occur; **no sustained H2H** stated in general terms.
- **Net relevance:** **Moderate** (reinforces that WHO still frames this as non-sustained H2H).

### CDC situation summary (Jan 9, 2026) — cdc.gov
- **Type/quality:** US CDC; high reliability for US risk framing.
- **Facts:** Characterizes public health risk as **low**; describes routine surveillance/reporting.
- **Net relevance:** **Moderate** (a major national authority not sounding emergency alarms).

### Economic Times India local bird-flu piece (Feb 2026) — economictimes.com
- **Type/quality:** Secondary media; mixed reliability; often informational.
- **Facts:** Local outbreak in birds (crows) and standard precautions; no substantiated international escalation.
- **Net relevance:** **Low** (doesn’t move WHO-level PHEIC likelihood).

### AskNews: WHO funding crisis / Executive Board coverage (AFP, Anadolu; Feb 2, 2026)
- **Type/quality:** Reputable wire/service journalism; reliable for what officials said.
- **Facts:** WHO staffing/funding disruption; priorities, reforms; not H5N1-specific.
- **Opinions:** Tedros framing of crisis as “catalyst,” etc. (institutional narrative).
- **Net relevance:** **Weak to moderate**. Possible second-order effect: constrained capacity/political bandwidth may make new PHEIC less likely unless situation is unmistakable.

### AskNews: Mpox EC meeting / lifting PHEIC (WHO primary + media, Sept–Nov 2025)
- **Type/quality:** WHO primary statement is very high reliability; media repeats are decent.
- **Facts:** Shows WHO continues to use EC process and is willing to end PHEIC when risk declines.
- **Net relevance:** **Moderate** for process/institutional behavior (but not specific to H5N1).

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence (structural / high predictive power)
1. **No sustained human-to-human transmission signal in any provided WHO/CDC materials.**  
   - Mechanism: Influenza PHEIC precedent (e.g., H1N1 2009) aligns with rapid multi-country spread and sustained H2H.  
   - Weight: **Strong against** PHEIC in the next ~3 months.

2. **WHO communications in Jan 2026 appear routine (fact sheets, cumulative tables), not emergency-oriented.**  
   - Mechanism: If DG were moving toward PHEIC, we’d expect stronger risk framing, EC convening hints, or DON emphasis on “potential international spread.”  
   - Weight: **Strong against**.

### Moderate evidence (trend/context)
3. **FAO shows extensive animal outbreaks globally, with limited human events in the update.**  
   - Mechanism: Animal spread increases spillover opportunities, but without H2H it usually does not trigger a PHEIC.  
   - Weight: **Slightly for** PHEIC (via risk of sudden shift), but overall still **more consistent with No**.

4. **CDC assesses current public health risk as low (Jan 2026).**  
   - Mechanism: If a key surveillance power sees low risk, less pressure for WHO to escalate immediately.  
   - Weight: **Moderate against**.

### Weak evidence (small adjustments)
5. **WHO funding/staffing disruption** (Feb 2026 Executive Board remarks).  
   - Mechanism ambiguous: could make WHO more cautious about declaring; or could encourage declarations to mobilize resources. Given politics/fatigue, I lean “less likely absent clear trigger.”  
   - Weight: **Weak against**.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** Feb 2, 2026 → May 1, 2026 = **~88 days**.
- **If halved (~44 days):** probability drops meaningfully because there’s less time for (i) detection of sustained H2H, (ii) EC convening, (iii) DG declaration.  
- **If doubled (~176 days):** probability rises (more time for mutation, clusters, international spread), but still constrained by the long-standing pattern that WHO has tolerated extensive H5N1 animal spread and sporadic human cases without PHEIC.

## (d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from outside view (3%)
Your outside-view base rate (3%) already reflected (i) long history of **no H5N1 PHEIC**, (ii) **recent low WHO risk framing**, (iii) procedural hurdle of convening an EC, and (iv) short horizon.

**What’s changed with the “current info” set?** Nothing here suggests an acceleration toward the PHEIC threshold:
- WHO content in late Jan 2026 reads as **maintenance-mode surveillance**, not emergency escalation.
- FAO data continues to show **high animal incidence** but not a human epidemiological inflection.
- CDC still says **low risk**.
- No article indicates an **IHR Emergency Committee being convened for H5N1**, which is typically a key precursor signal.

So the inside view should **nudge down** slightly from 3% due to continued lack of trigger signals, while keeping a non-trivial tail risk for sudden H2H clusters.

Key “Yes” pathway (still plausible but not evidenced here):
1) A verified cluster of efficient H2H transmission in one country **plus** exportation to others, **or**
2) Clear evidence of sustained community transmission with severe outcomes, prompting EC convening and DG declaration within weeks.

Probability calibration
- **Outside view anchor:** 3%
- **Inside-view adjustments:**
  - Continued routine WHO comms/no escalation cues: **-0.5% to -1%**
  - High animal activity (FAO) maintaining jump-risk: **+0.2% to +0.5%**
  - Net: modest downward revision.
- **Inside view prediction:** **2%**

Checklist:
1. **Criteria check:** PHEIC for **H5N1** declared by WHO DG **between Feb 2 and before May 1, 2026**.
2. **Outside view base rate used:** **3%**.
3. **Consistency check:** “**2 out of 100** times, WHO DG declares a H5N1 PHEIC in the next 88 days.” Plausible given lack of H2H evidence.
4. **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - WHO/CDC materials show **no sustained H2H** and **low risk framing**.
   - WHO late-Jan updates look **routine**, not emergency escalation.
   - FAO shows widespread animal outbreaks but limited human signal.
   - No indication of an **H5N1 EC convening**.
5. **Blind spot:** A sudden, well-documented H2H cluster with exportation could force a rapid EC + DG declaration, making 2% too low.
6. **Status quo:** Status quo is “no PHEIC for H5N1”; short horizon favors status quo.

Probability: 2%
