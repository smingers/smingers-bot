Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, *facts ≠ opinions*)

1. WHO cumulative human-case table (22 Jan 2026).  Facts: monthly surveillance continues; no mention of Emergency Committee or PHEIC.  Quality: primary WHO document, high.
2. WHO Western-Pacific avian-influenza page (undated background).  Facts: viruses rarely transmit human-to-human.  Opinion: none.  Quality: high but generic, limited predictive value.
3. FAO animal-outbreak dashboard (22 Jan 2026).  Facts: 857 new H5N1 animal outbreaks, 6 new human cases since Dec 2025.  Quality: primary FAO data, high.
4. WHO zoonotic-influenza fact sheet (21 Jan 2026).  Facts: global spread, no sustained H-to-H transmission; opinion: “future pandemic timing unknown.”  Quality: high, but background.
5. CDC H5 update (9 Jan 2026).  Facts: U.S. risk assessment “low.” Quality: high.
6. Economic Times India article (late Jan 2026).  Facts: one local H5N1 bird die-off; opinion: precautionary advice.  Quality: local news, low–moderate.
7. Asknews items (2 Feb 2026) about WHO funding crisis, EB meeting etc.  Facts: organisational strain, no mention of H5N1 emergency; opinions: Tedros’ framing of 2025.  Quality: reputable wires, but not epidemiological.
No source since January shows: (i) sustained human transmission, (ii) an IHR Emergency Committee convening for H5N1, or (iii) language that risk is “high.”

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Historical pattern: 0 H5-family PHEICs despite 20 years of epizootics (structural, institutional).  
• Current WHO & CDC risk level explicitly “low”; no Emergency Committee scheduled (direct causal signal).

Moderate evidence
• FAO/WHO data: continued high animal circulation and sporadic human spillover (creates tail risk of viral adaptation).  
• Short 3-month window limits time for evolutionary or bureaucratic steps.

Weak evidence
• Media concern/advocacy pieces urging action.  
• WHO funding/ governance turmoil could, in principle, alter decision thresholds, but direction ambiguous.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window: 88 days (≈0.24 yr).  
Halved (44 days): probability would fall roughly one-third (to ≈1.3%).  
Doubled (176 days): probability would about double (≈4–5%) because more time for (i) viral change, (ii) committee logistics.

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment
Outside-view baseline (see earlier work): 3 % for an H5N1 PHEIC in any 3-month interval.

Downward pressures
1. No Emergency Committee even scheduled; lead-time from scheduling to declaration is usually ≥2 weeks. (strong)
2. Only 6 new human cases globally in past 5 weeks; no H-to-H transmission. (strong)
3. WHO organisational bandwidth strained—less appetite for new emergencies. (moderate)

Upward pressures
1. Very high animal burden continues; evolutionary jump always possible. (moderate)
2. Post-COVID sensitivity could lower threshold for declaring respiratory PHEICs. (weak-moderate)

Net: downward factors dominate, nudging probability slightly below the 3 % baseline.

Probability calibration
Best estimate: 2 %.  (Interpretation: in 2 of 100 comparable 3-month periods we would expect a WHO H5N1 PHEIC.)

Checklist
1. Paraphrase: “Between 2 Feb and 1 May 2026, will WHO DG declare an H5N1 PHEIC?”  
2. Outside base: 3 %.  Final still tethered (2 %).  
3. Consistency: “In 2 out of 100 times, a declaration occurs.”  
4. Key evidence: a) zero historical H5 PHEICs; b) WHO & CDC risk ‘low’; c) no Emergency Committee convened; d) only 6 recent human cases; e) large animal outbreak tail-risk.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden mammal-to-human transmissible variant emerges in March, forcing emergency meeting. Would raise odds sharply.  
6. Status-quo bias check: status quo = no PHEIC; probability favouring status quo is prudent in calm epidemiological context.

Probability: 2%
