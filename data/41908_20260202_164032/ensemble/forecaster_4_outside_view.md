Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. RAND commentary (23 Dec 2024).  – Medium-quality secondary source.  Factual nuggets: 61 U.S. human H5N1 cases (as of 18 Dec 2024), first severe U.S. case, large bovine epizootic, a handful of apparently unlinked human cases.  Opinion: authors argue for a U.S. domestic emergency; they are not insiders at WHO.
2. CDC “Avian timeline 1880-1959” (Apr 2024).  – Pure historical background; no bearing on current decision-making.  High factual reliability, zero forward-looking value.
3. WHO DON 590 on H5N5 (5 Dec 2025).  – High-quality primary source.  Confirms 71 human A(H5) cases in U.S., first H5N5 death, WHO risk assessment = Low.  Although about H5N5, it demonstrates WHO’s continued “low” global-risk stance toward H5 viruses and absence of Emergency-Committee activity.
4. Agent report (1 Feb 2026).  – Synthetic compilation that cross-checks the WHO site, FAO notes, CDC guidance and press coverage.  Key facts: (i) up to 1 Feb 2026 WHO has never declared a PHEIC for H5N1; (ii) no Emergency Committee has even met on H5N1; (iii) cumulative 2023-26 human H5 cases ≈ 80 worldwide, only four deaths; (iv) WHO’s official risk level remains Low; (v) eight PHEICs total have been declared since 2009.

(b) Reference class analysis
Candidates:
1. “Any WHO-declared PHEIC” (8 events in 17 yrs).  Broadest class, gives base rate ≈ 0.47 per year.
2. “First-time PHEIC for a respiratory zoonotic virus with <100 confirmed human cases worldwide.”  Zero historical examples (SARS-1 had thousands of cases before the IHR 2005 era; MERS was never declared a PHEIC despite ~2 600 cases).  Implied base rate ≈ 0.
3. “WHO PHEIC declarations made without a preceding Emergency-Committee meeting.”  Base rate 0 / 8.  (A meeting has always occurred first.)

Class 2 is the closest analogue: a novel or re-emergent zoonotic respiratory virus with limited human-to-human transmission.  The empirical base rate of a PHEIC here is essentially nil, suggesting a very low outside-view probability.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time until resolution: 88 days (~0.24 years).
Using class 1 base rate (0.47 yr⁻¹) → 0.47 × 0.24 ≈ 11 % for “any PHEIC”, but the question concerns one specific pathogen that has not yet even triggered an Emergency-Committee meeting.  Historically, the median interval from first EC meeting to declaration (when it occurs) is about one week; the limiting step is convening the committee, publicising advice and the DG decision.  Therefore, for H5N1 to get a PHEIC before 1 May 2026, three things must all occur in 88 days:
   1. A dramatic, widely publicised change (sustained human-to-human spread or a large fatal cluster).
   2. WHO convenes an Emergency Committee (usually at least two weeks’ notice).
   3. The DG issues a PHEIC on, or shortly after, the meeting.

Historically, only COVID-19 progressed from “first concerning cluster” to PHEIC in < 30 days; all other PHEICs addressed long-running outbreaks.

(d) Justification
• No Emergency Committee: zero historical precedent for a PHEIC without one.
• WHO maintains “Low” global risk for H5 viruses as recently as Dec 2025.
• Human burden to date (≈ 80 cases, 4 deaths) is orders of magnitude below every prior PHEIC.
• Surveillance is intense in North America; if sustained human-to-human transmission had begun, we would likely already know.
• Time window (≤ 3 months) is short; most PHEICs persisted for years after declaration, so WHO typically debates for months before acting.

Putting these outside-view elements together, the baseline odds that H5N1 alone will jump from “no EC” to “declared PHEIC” within 88 days look far smaller than the 11 % general-PHEIC baseline.  A conservative discount factor of ×0.2 converts 11 % to about 2 %.

Outside view calibration:
Start with “any PHEIC” quarterly probability ≈ 11 %.
Condition on the event being a specific pathogen (divide by ≈6–8, the number of plausible PHEIC candidates on WHO’s watch list) → ~1.5 %.
Adjust upward slightly (+0.5 pp) for recent bovine epizootic and sporadic deaths that make H5N1 more salient than, say, Marburg (which presently shows no activity) → ~2 %.
Check against “zero historical declarations for viruses with <100 confirmed cases”; that implies ≤5 % is reasonable.  Our 2 % sits well inside that bound.

Outside View Prediction:
2 % (i.e., a 1-in-50 chance) that the WHO Director-General will declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before 1 May 2026.
