Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, 2025-26)

1. WHO cumulative H5N1 human-case table (22 Jan 26).  Primary data, monthly update.  Purely factual, no policy signals.  High quality.
2. WHO WPR surveillance page (undated, maintained Jan 26).  Background only, no new events.  High quality, low relevance.
3. FAO global AIV situation update (22 Jan 26).  Primary surveillance data on animal & human outbreaks.  Credible (UN agency).  Factual.
4. WHO fact sheet on avian/zoonotic influenza (21 Jan 26).  Static background; confirms no sustained H-to-H spread.  High quality.
5. CDC H5 update (9 Jan 26).  National public-health authority; reiterates “low” public-health risk.  Factual.
6. Economic Times article on local Indian outbreak (late-Jan 26).  Single provincial event, mostly explanatory.  Moderate quality, limited scope.
7. AskNews packet (2 Feb 26) – multiple press stories from WHO Executive Board session.  Authoritative quotes from DG Tedros; no reference to H5N1 or Emergency Committee.  High quality for WHO institutional context.

All sources contain predominantly factual information; opinions appear only in Indian media (precaution advice) and Executive Board speeches (organisational outlook).  No expert opinion advocating a PHEIC for H5N1 is present in this batch.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
• WHO’s last formal virological risk assessment on any H5 virus (for H5N5, 5-Dec-25) labelled overall risk “LOW”; no Emergency Committee convened for H5N1 to-date.  (Institutional inertia, structural hard-to-change)  ⟶ lowers odds.

Moderate evidence
• FAO update: 6 new human H5N1 events globally in last month; animal epizootic continues (1,391 outbreaks).  Shows persistence but not acceleration.  (Trend, indirect causal link)  ⟶ very small upward tug.
• CDC (9-Jan-26): U.S. still rates public-health risk low.  (Single authoritative source)  ⟶ mild downward tug.
• Only 88 days left and no EC announcement yet; historically EC meets ≥ once before decision.  (Historical pattern, structural)  ⟶ moderate downward tug.

Weak evidence
• Single provincial outbreak in India, routine containment.  (Anecdotal)  ⟶ negligible effect.

Net evidence weight: substantially more downward than upward.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 88 days (≈ 0.24 yr).  
If window were halved to 44 days, probability would fall to roughly 0.6× current estimate (administrative lead-time dominates).  
If doubled to 176 days, probability would rise to about 2× current estimate (extra time for signal accumulation and EC process).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view anchor: 1.3 % (any influenza PHEIC in a 3-month period) → earlier rough outside view 6 % after factoring mammalian spread & expert pressure.

Inside-view updates since that calculation:
• No surge in human cases since late-Dec-25 update.  
• WHO leadership and Executive Board communications omit H5N1 entirely, suggesting low agenda salience.  
• Continued designation of risk as low by both WHO (Dec-25) and CDC (Jan-26).  
• Administrative clock: an Emergency Committee still needs to be convened, publicly announced, meet, and have its advice accepted—historically ≥ 3 weeks; therefore any declaration would likely have to be triggered by mid-March at the latest.  Current signals do not point to an imminent EC meeting.

These factors moderate the earlier 6 % down to 4 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that about 4 out of 100 times, the WHO DG would declare an H5N1 PHEIC between now (2 Feb 26) and 1 May 26 under circumstances similar to those currently observed.  A ±10 % absolute change (to 14 % or –6 %) would be inconsistent with absence/presence of an Emergency Committee announcement; a ±3 pp change (1–7 %) could be driven by week-to-week case counts.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will WHO declare an H5N1 PHEIC before 1 May 2026?”  
2. Base rate: 1.3 % per 3-month window for influenza PHEIC; initial adjusted outside view 6 %.  
3. Consistency: “4 times in 100, a declaration occurs.” – plausible given evidence.  
4. Key evidence ( <20 wds each )  
   • No Emergency Committee yet convened for H5N1.  
   • WHO & CDC still rate H5N1 human-health risk low.  
   • Only six new human cases worldwide last month.  
   • 88-day window short relative to historical EC timelines.  
5. Blind spot: sudden H-to-H cluster (e.g., hospital transmission) prompts emergency EC in March.  Would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status quo bias: Declaring a PHEIC is rare; institutional inertia favours “No”.

Probability: 4%
