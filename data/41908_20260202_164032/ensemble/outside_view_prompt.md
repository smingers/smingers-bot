# Summary of "How to Get Ahead of H5N1" (RAND, December 23, 2024)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Human cases**: As of December 18, 2024, 61 human cases of H5N1 have been confirmed in the United States, with 2 cases of unknown origin
- **First severe case**: Louisiana reported the first severe H5N1 case requiring hospitalization
- **California emergency**: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on December 18, 2024, after more than 300 herds tested positive in the last month
- **Animal spread**: The virus is primarily spreading in chickens and dairy cows, with reported infections also in cats, dogs, goats, and various wild animals

## Key Context:

- **COVID-19 comparison**: On January 31, 2020, COVID-19 was declared both a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO and a Public Health Emergency (PHE) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
- **Current transmission**: The current H5N1 strain is not considered contagious enough for sustained human-to-human transmission, though recent cases are calling this into question
- **Concerning cases**: One Canadian teenager contracted H5N1 with no known animal contact and has been in ICU for several weeks; a Missouri case also could not be linked to animal exposure

## Expert Opinions and Assessments (Named Source):

**From authors Adeline E. Williams, Allison Berke, Casey Aveggio, Saskia Popescu, and Aurelia Attal-Juncqua (RAND researchers):**

- "The United States is failing to act decisively against the growing H5N1 threat"
- "Time is running out to contain this threat before it spirals out of control"
- "The ongoing H5N1 outbreak among U.S. dairy farms is proving to be a painful indicator of ever-present failures in response, coordination, and prioritization"
- "Failing to act decisively risks repeating the missteps of early COVID-19 response efforts"
- A recent study found that "a single amino acid mutation allows H5N1 to bind human hemagglutinin (HA) receptors, readily enabling human infection and human-to-human spread"

## Recommendations Made:

The article presents three recommendations (though the text appears cut off before completing all three):

1. **Declare H5N1 a PHE** and mandate nationwide testing of dairy and beef cattle, with increased testing of farm/dairy workers, livestock vaccinations, and indemnity payments
2. USDA has announced a plan to test milk nationwide, but there is no mandate to test farm workers or dairy cows not shipped across state lines

**Note**: The article text appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence while discussing USDA compensation for farmers.

# Summary of Article: "1880-1959 Highlights in the History of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Timeline"

**Source:** CDC Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) webpage  
**Date:** April 30, 2024

## Key Content:

This article provides a historical timeline of avian influenza outbreaks and related events from 1880-1959. It does not contain information directly relevant to forecasting whether WHO will declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before May 1, 2026.

### Historical Facts Documented:

**Early History (1880s-1901):**
- 1878: Term "fowl plague" first used to describe poultry disease in Italy and Europe
- 1880: "Fowl plague" differentiated from fowl cholera
- 1894 and 1901: HPAI outbreaks reported in Italy, spreading to Austria, Germany, Belgium, and France
- 1901: HPAI in domestic poultry identified as caused by a virus

**20th Century Events:**
- 1918: Spanish influenza H1N1 pandemic killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide; later determined to be an avian-like H1N1 virus
- 1924-1925: First HPAI outbreak in poultry in the United States (New York City live bird markets)
- 1950s: By mid-1900s, HPAI reported in poultry across most continents
- 1957: H2N2 virus pandemic ("Asian Flu") emerged in East Asia; estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide, 116,000 in the U.S.
- **1959: First HPAI A(H5N1) virus isolated following an outbreak in chickens in Scotland**

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article provides historical context only and contains no information about current H5N1 situations, WHO activities, PHEIC considerations, or events occurring after 2024 that would be relevant to forecasting a potential PHEIC declaration before May 1, 2026.

# Summary of WHO Article on Avian Influenza A(H5N5) - United States

**Date:** December 5, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Case Details:**
   - On November 15, 2025, WHO was notified of the 71st confirmed human case with influenza A(H5) since early 2024 in the United States
   - This was the first human case reported in the U.S. since February 2025
   - On November 20, CDC laboratory sequencing verified the virus as influenza A(H5N5)
   - This represents the first globally reported human case caused by an influenza A(H5N5) virus

2. **Patient Information:**
   - Adult patient with underlying medical conditions residing in Washington State
   - Developed symptoms including fever during the week ending October 25, 2025
   - Hospitalized with serious illness during the week ending November 8, 2025
   - Patient died on November 21, 2025
   - Patient kept backyard poultry and domestic birds

3. **Virus Classification:**
   - Influenza A(H5N5) virus belonging to H5 haemagglutinin (HA) clade 2.3.4.4b
   - A(H5N5) viruses have been detected in North America in wild birds and wild mammals since at least 2023

4. **Public Health Investigation:**
   - Contact tracing identified no further cases amongst contacts
   - Currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission
   - Active monitoring of close contacts is underway

## WHO Risk Assessment:

- **Overall public health risk** posed by A(H5) viruses: **LOW**
- **Risk for individuals with occupational exposure**: **LOW TO MODERATE**

## Note on Question Relevance:

This article discusses H5N5 (not H5N1 as specified in the forecasting question), and there is **no mention of a PHEIC declaration** or any indication that WHO is considering elevating this to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

This update incorporates the additional material retrieved and revisits every element of the original request:  

1. WHO Public-Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) timeline (status 1 Feb 2026)  
• 25 Apr 2009 – 10 Aug 2010 Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic  
• 5 May 2014 – present Wild poliovirus (type 1)  
• 8 Aug 2014 – 29 Mar 2016 Ebola virus disease, West Africa  
• 1 Feb 2016 – 18 Nov 2016 Zika virus & congenital malformations  
• 17 Jul 2019 – 26 Jun 2020 Ebola virus disease, DRC  
• 30 Jan 2020 – 5 May 2023 COVID-19  
• 23 Jul 2022 – 11 May 2023 Mpox (clade IIb)  
• 2 Aug 2024 – 5 Sep 2025 Mpox (clade I) – declared Aug 2024, terminated Sept 2025 after sustained decline in Africa (Springer Nature blog, 3 Dec 2025)  
No PHEIC has been declared for avian influenza A(H5N1) or for any other influenza A(H5) virus up to February 2026.

2. WHO Emergency-Committee meetings or other official statements on H5N1, 2023 – Feb 2026  
WHO has not convened an International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee on H5N1 during this period; the public record contains only technical risk-assessment products:  
• 24 Jan 2023 DON – Ecuador paediatric case  
• 24 & 28 Feb 2023 DONs – Cambodia father/daughter cluster  
• 21 Apr 2023 DON 461 – first Chilean case (clade 2.3.4.4b)  
• 9 Apr 2024 DON 512 – second U.S. case, first presumed cow-to-human transmission in Texas (WHO, 9 Apr 2024)  
• 30 Mar 2024 Departmental Update – “2023: outbreaks of avian influenza” (WHO)  
• 5 Dec 2025 DON 590 – first recorded human A(H5N5) infection and death, Washington State, USA (WHO, 5 Dec 2025)  

Other agencies issued supportive guidance: CDC interim prevention recommendations for HPAI A(H5N1) (26 Dec 2024) summarise U.S. policy for exposed workers (CDC, 26 Dec 2024).  None of these notices involved a formal IHR Emergency-Committee deliberation.

3. Summary of human cases and geographic spread (Jan 2023 – 1 Feb 2026)  

North America  
• United States: 71 laboratory-confirmed A(H5) infections since early 2024, mostly linked to poultry or dairy cattle. 69 were A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, 2 were A(H5N5). Two fatalities have occurred: an elderly backyard-flock owner in Louisiana (A(H5N1), 6 Jan 2025 – Today.com, previously cited) and an older backyard-flock owner in Washington State (A(H5N5), died 21 Nov 2025 – WHO DON 590; CBS News, 21 Nov 2025).  
• Canada: one critical paediatric A(H5N1) case, British Columbia, autumn 2024 (Today.com, earlier search set), no deaths.  

Latin America & Caribbean  
• Ecuador: 1 paediatric case, Jan 2023 (WHO DON).  
• Chile: 1 adult case, Apr 2023, fatal (WHO DON 461).  
No further WHO-confirmed human H5 infections reported from South America through Feb 2026.

Asia–Pacific  
• Cambodia: 6 cases in 2023 with one death (WHO departmental update, 30 Mar 2024).  No additional WHO-confirmed cases in 2024-25.

Europe, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean  
No human H5 cases have been published by WHO for 2023-early 2026.

Cumulative tallies, Jan 2023 – 1 Feb 2026  
• United States 71 cases / 2 deaths  
• Canada 1 / 0  
• Latin America 2 / 1  
• Cambodia 6 / 1  
Total 80 laboratory-confirmed cases, 4 deaths.  WHO’s global cumulative table (last posted 14 Jul 2023) still shows 873 cases and 458 deaths since 2003; updated global totals for 2024-26 have not yet been issued, so the figures above are compiled from individual event reports.

Clinical picture: the majority of U.S. infections during the dairy-cattle outbreak presented with conjunctivitis only, whereas the two U.S. fatalities and the 2023 Chilean fatality involved severe respiratory disease.

4. Current animal outbreaks and virological evolution  

• The clade 2.3.4.4b panzootic continues to circulate in poultry and wild birds on every continent except Antarctica, with repeated incursions into mammals.  FAO’s “Iguaçu Statement” (16 Oct 2025) acknowledges HPAI as one of today’s most serious animal- and public-health threats and endorses a 2024-2033 Global Strategy for HPAI control (FAO, 16 Oct 2025).  
• United States: detections in wild birds reported in all 50 states since 2022, and in backyard or commercial poultry flocks in 48 states (WHO DON 512).  A multistate outbreak in dairy cattle, first disclosed 25 Mar 2024, had spread to 15 states by Nov 2024 (CDC interim guidance, 26 Dec 2024) and to 17 states with 1 075 herds by June 2025 (Nature comment previously cited).  
• Marine-mammal events: large die-offs of sea-lions and elephant seals in Peru, Chile and Argentina continued in 2024–25 (EID paper list, Dec 2025).  
• Virus diversification: two bovine-adapted genotypes are currently tracked – B3.13 (first detected March 2024) and D1.1 (emerged Aug 2024, carried the PB2 E627K mutation in the Louisiana fatal case).  In November 2025 an A(H5N5) reassortant belonging to the same 2.3.4.4b HA clade caused the first recorded human H5N5 infection and death (WHO DON 590).  

5. Consolidated chronology of notable H5 events, 2023–Feb 2026  
• 9 Jan 2023 First Latin-American human H5N1 case (Ecuador)  
• 24–28 Feb 2023 Cambodia father–daughter cluster  
• 21 Apr 2023 First Chilean human case (fatal) – WHO DON 461  
• 25 Mar 2024 USDA confirms H5N1 in dairy cattle (Texas/Kansas) – start of bovine epizootic  
• 1 Apr 2024 Second U.S. human case, first cow-to-human (Texas) – WHO DON 512  
• 26 Dec 2024 CDC publishes interim H5N1 prevention guidance for exposed workers (CDC, 26 Dec 2024)  
• 6 Jan 2025 First U.S. H5-associated fatality (Louisiana, A(H5N1))  
• 15-21 Nov 2025 First global human A(H5N5) infection and death (Washington State) – WHO DON 590  
• 16 Oct 2025 FAO “Iguaçu Statement” adopts 10-year global HPAI strategy  
At none of these milestones did WHO convene an Emergency Committee or declare a PHEIC.

6. Remaining information gaps  
a. WHO does not publish minutes of informal expert consultations; any closed-door H5N1 discussions remain undisclosed.  
b. Consolidated WHO global human-case tables have not been updated beyond July 2023, so totals for 2024-26 rely on individual DONs and national reports.  
c. Comprehensive WOAH statistics for poultry losses during 2025–26 are not available in the public search results; only narrative summaries are accessible.  
d. An explicit WHO risk assessment addressing the public-health implications of the U.S. dairy-cattle epizootic has not yet been released.  

7. Conclusions  
• Up to 1 Feb 2026 WHO has declared eight PHEICs – none for avian influenza.  
• No WHO IHR Emergency-Committee meeting has been convened for H5N1/H5N5 during 2023-26; official communications comprise six Disease-Outbreak-News items and one departmental review.  
• Human A(H5) activity since 2023 is dominated by the unprecedented U.S. cluster linked to dairy cattle and poultry exposure (71 cases, 2 deaths).  Outside North America only sporadic cases have occurred (Ecuador, Chile, Cambodia).  
• In animals the clade 2.3.4.4b panzootic persists, with sustained circulation in birds, spill-over into multiple mammalian species, and a large-scale outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle.  
• Continued global surveillance, virus sharing and One-Health coordination – emphasised in the October 2025 Iguaçu Statement – are essential while the overall human-to-human transmission risk remains assessed as “low”.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
