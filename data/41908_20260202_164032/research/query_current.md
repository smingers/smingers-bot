Analysis:
WHO has declared only seven PHEICs since 2005 and tends to do so when three conditions are satisfied: 1) an extraordinary event, 2) international spread, 3) need for a coordinated response.  As of 2 Feb 2026 no PHEIC has been declared for H5N1; the most recent one (for mpox) was ended in 2024.  What matters now is whether the virus has recently shown sustained human-to-human transmission, large geographic dispersion, or high mortality in people—developments that would pressure the DG to act.  Key signals we need to monitor are: 
• Minutes or press releases from any Emergency Committee meeting convened specifically on H5N1.  
• Statements by DG Tedros, the WHO Health Emergencies Programme lead, or the Influenza Preparedness & Response team indicating “consideration” or “assessment” of IHR criteria for H5N1.  
• Sharp uptick in confirmed human clusters or mammal-to-mammal spread (e.g., among cattle, sea lions, cats) documented by WHO, CDC, ECDC, or peer-reviewed journals.  
• Government requests (e.g., from affected member states) for a PHEIC.  
Current news articles detailing outbreaks since late 2025 (Chile sea-lion die-offs, U.S. dairy cattle infections, Cambodian family cluster in Jan 2026) and any WHO press briefings in early 2026 will provide the best evidence.  We therefore want sources that mention “Emergency Committee,” “PHEIC,” “H5N1” and “2026” together, plus detailed coverage of recent human or mammalian cases.
