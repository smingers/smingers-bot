Analysis:
To judge whether WHO is likely to declare a PHEIC for H5N1 in the next three months it helps to know 1) how often and under what circumstances WHO has declared PHEICs in the past, 2) whether WHO has ever convened (or plans to convene) an IHR Emergency Committee specifically for H5N1, and 3) the current epidemiological situation and recent WHO/public-health commentary on H5N1 (especially from late-2025 to Feb 2026). Historical WHO statements and media coverage around any previous deliberations on an H5N1 PHEIC, plus the formal criteria and precedent from other diseases, constitute the most relevant context.
