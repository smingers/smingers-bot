The U.S. withdrawal, announced shortly after Donald Trump's return to the White House in January 2025, was accompanied by drastic cuts to U.S. foreign aid. This led to significant funding reductions, forcing the WHO to reduce its workforce: 1,241 staff departures were recorded, including 1,162 members leaving through retirement, early retirement, or natural departure. Tedros described the past 12 months as a 'painful but necessary' process of redefining priorities and realigning operations. He stated that the organization has achieved stability and is moving forward, viewing the crisis as an opportunity to become a leaner, more mission-focused entity. He urged member states to gradually increase mandatory contributions to reduce dependence on volatile voluntary donations. A 20% increase in mandatory contributions was approved in May 2025, with three additional increases planned for May 2027, May 2029, and May 2031, aiming to raise mandatory contributions from 14% of the base budget in 2022 to 50% by 2031. The goal is to avoid reliance on a small number of donors and unpredictable funding. The Executive Board is currently reviewing the U.S. and Argentina withdrawal notifications, but the U.S. withdrawal raises concerns because the country still owes approximately $260 million (\u20ac220 million) to the WHO.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:53 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94UA4WE)\n\n**SNS Director Advances Strategic Alliances During Official Visit to Spain**\nDr. Julio Landr\u00f3n, Director of the National Health Service (SNS) of the Dominican Republic, led a strategic visit to Spain, during which he signed an agreement annex to continue high-level health management training for all public hospital directors. The agreement, part of the University Diploma in Information and Statistics Management, was formalized with Vanessa Pereira Dur\u00e1n, Director General of CDEI Business School, and is developed in collaboration with the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Murcia (UCAM). The program aims to strengthen technical and analytical competencies in health information management, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced these figures during the opening of the 158th Session of the WHO Executive Board in Geneva. He described 2025 as a year of profound contradictions and one of WHO\u2019s most challenging years, citing significant funding cuts that reduced staff and impacted operations, affecting not only WHO but many other international organizations. Despite these challenges, Tedros highlighted key achievements: organizing the transport of 938 truckloads of life-saving medical supplies to Gaza, supporting over 8,000 medical evacuations from Gaza, delivering approximately 3,000 metric tons of medical aid to Sudan since the conflict began in 2023, deploying 17 mobile teams in Ukraine, and providing over 18,500 health consultations across more than 140 locations. WHO also supported the global response to the mpox outbreak by securing 3 million doses and enabling vaccinations for 2 million people, and distributed over 50 million doses of cholera vaccine globally. Tedros emphasized that attacks on healthcare remain a 'disturbing and illegal new normal' in conflict zones and affirmed WHO\u2019s continued collaboration with UN agencies and other organizations, maintaining a firm commitment to action in 2025.

Due to significant funding cuts, WHO was forced to reduce its workforce, making 2025 'one of the most difficult years in our Organization's history.' Tedros highlighted that these challenges are part of a broader crisis affecting international organizations, driven by sudden and severe cuts to bilateral aid. He emphasized that WHO has mobilized 85% of the resources needed for its base budget through assessed contribution increases, with more increases scheduled through 2031. However, he warned that the remaining funding gap would be difficult to close, and earmarked funding continues to create 'pockets of poverty' in critical areas such as emergency preparedness, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), health financing, climate resilience, and determinants of health. Tedros stressed that failure to approve assessed contribution increases would have left WHO in a far worse situation, and that continued reforms are essential to ensure an impartial, science-based organization. 'The story of 2025 is not one of austerity, but resolve,' he said. 'This is your WHO. Its strength is your unity.

The decree issued by the General Secretary of the Council of Ministers on January 26, 2026, sets new evaluation criteria and eligibility requirements for public administrations, legal entities, public bodies, and third-sector organizations, excluding profit-oriented entities. The principle of binding destination of funds remains central: every euro must substantially contribute to the objectives declared by taxpayers. In the 2024 tax return, contributors allocated 202 million euros to the state. The maximum allowable administrative and general expenses, previously capped at 7%, has been revised to a differentiated cap based on project type and average project value: 20,000 euros for 'Assistance to refugees and unaccompanied foreign minors', 300,000 euros for 'Natural disasters', 200,000 euros for 'Conservation of cultural heritage', 20,000 euros for 'Hunger in the world' (with a requirement that projects be located in African countries with which the government has agreements under the Mattei Plan), and 50,000 euros for 'Prevention and recovery from substance addictions and other pathological dependencies'. Projects exceeding 500,000 euros must be divided into functional and operational lots, each with measurable goals and defined technical, functional, and financial aspects. Up to 40% of the budget may be assigned to one or more project partners. The new call also includes a detailed list of non-allowable expenses per category\u2014such as office furniture, phone and mobile phone costs\u2014already present in the 2025 call, aiming to simplify application preparation and reduce interpretative ambiguities, according to government sources.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:07 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2026/02/01/bando-per-l8xmille-al-via-stretta-sugli-importi-rendicontabili_90759c51-8e85-4dc6-a61f-e4e0800b545f.html)\n\n**What Have We Learned from the Pandemic? Lessons from WHO Epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove**\nSix years after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the WHO's Epidemic and Pandemic Threat Management Department, reflects on the lessons learned from the pandemic. She emphasizes that while the world witnessed the rapid spread of a novel virus, it also demonstrated the immense power of science, collaboration, and data sharing when aligned. However, inequalities significantly slowed progress and caused preventable loss of life. Van Kerkhove notes that the pandemic\u2019s end in 2023 did not mark the end of the threat\u2014Sars-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally, evolve, and cause severe illness and Long Covid. She highlights that effective tools now exist, including updated vaccines, treatments, surveillance systems, and preventive measures, but uptake remains insufficient, especially among high-risk populations. The WHO\u2019s updated strategy focuses on protection, integration, and preparedness, integrating Covid-19 care into routine health systems. Van Kerkhove stresses the importance of maintaining surveillance and data sharing, warning that reduced testing and reporting have created critical data gaps. She underscores the growing burden of Long Covid, affecting an estimated 10\u201320% of individuals after initial recovery. She also honors healthcare workers, scientists, and first responders who endured immense personal and professional strain.

She emphasizes that the pandemic fundamentally transformed global health and underscores the importance of preparedness for future crises. Van Kerkhove defends the WHO's decision-making process, noting that it was based on available data at the time and contextual factors, rejecting claims of undue delay as retrospective bias and politicization. She outlines key milestones: the WHO's first alert from Wuhan on December 31, 2019; the first case outside China on January 13, 2020; the emergency committee convening on January 20; and the WHO delegation's visit to China on January 26. The PHEIC declaration followed on January 30, when cases outside China were still under 100. Since then, the WHO has implemented reforms, including a strengthened International Health Regulations, a new 'pandemic emergency' alert level, and the adoption of the Pandemic Agreement. Van Kerkhove stresses that SARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, continuing to circulate, mutate, and cause severe illness and Long COVID. She notes that while the emergency phase ended in 2023, the threat persists. Effective tools\u2014updated vaccines, treatments, surveillance systems, and preventive measures\u2014are available, but uptake remains insufficient, especially among high-risk populations. The WHO's current strategy focuses on protection, integration, and preparedness, embedding COVID-19 care into routine health systems. She warns that reduced testing and reporting have created data gaps, undermining early detection. Long COVID, affecting 10\u201320% of recovered individuals, must be central to impact assessment and recovery planning. Van Kerkhove also honors frontline health workers, recalling a poignant image of a patient\u2019s hand held between rubber gloves filled with warm water to simulate human contact during isolation. Her message for 2026: protect vulnerable populations, maintain rigorous surveillance and data sharing, invest in Long COVID research and care, and prepare for the next crisis proactively, not reactively.

The declaration aimed to alert countries early and enable a coordinated international response, facilitating information sharing and health system preparedness. According to the WHO Director-General, the decision was not based solely on conditions in China but was primarily driven by concerns that the virus could spread to countries with limited medical capacities. This designation was intended to mobilize global action and prevent further international transmission.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[TAG24](https://www.tag24.de/heute-vor-jahren/30-1-2020-who-erklaerte-coronavirus-zum-gesundheitsnotstand-3463992)\n\n**Fifth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General announced on 5 September 2025 that the upsurge of mpox 2024 no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), following the fifth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee on 4 September 2025. The Committee concluded that the event no longer meets the criteria for a PHEIC due to sustained declines in mpox cases globally\u2014particularly in the WHO African Region, where over 80% of cases were reported\u2014along with improved understanding of transmission dynamics, reduced international spread, and strengthened national response capacities. The assessment across five domains\u2014growth rate and incidence, demographics affected and transmission risk, severity, geographical spread, and response capacity and access to countermeasures\u2014showed consistent improvement from 'high' or 'moderate' risk in August 2024 to 'low' risk by September 2025, with confidence levels rising to 'high' in most cases. The Committee advised that temporary recommendations be revised to focus on transitioning from emergency response to programmatic, health system-integrated mpox control efforts. These include sustaining surveillance, decentralizing testing, integrating mpox services into HIV/STI platforms, countering stigma, promoting timely care-seeking, and maintaining vaccine stockpiles with demand-driven strategies. The WHO emphasized that the standing recommendations for mpox, valid until 20 August 2026, remain adequate. The Director-General expressed gratitude to the Committee for its advice, and the transition to routine health system integration was underscored as essential to ensure long-term control and prevent future public health warnings from being undermined by prolonged emergency status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[who.int](https://www.who.int/news/item/30-10-2025-fifth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-%282005%29-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024)\n\n**WHO Declares Mpox No Longer an International Public Health Emergency**\nOn 13 September 2025 the World Health Organization announced that mpox is no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

Experts met again and said, 'the situation no longer represents an international public health emergency', a view he accepted. However, in Africa mpox remains a public health emergency. A meeting on 2 September concluded that keeping the declaration is essential to preserve political will, mobilise resources and keep countries at maximum alert.

The decision follows a sustained decline in reported cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda. In 2022, WHO declared a PHEIC after the virus spread beyond Africa; since then, global cases have fallen sharply since mid\u20112023, aided by containment measures, vaccination campaigns and increased awareness of transmission routes. As of the latest data, more than 88,000 confirmed cases have been reported in 113 countries, with the more virulent clade I (primarily in the DRC) having a case\u2011fatality rate above 10%, compared with clade II (outside Africa) below 1%. Despite the withdrawal of the emergency status, WHO stresses that the threat is not over and that response activities will continue. Tedros said, 'no significa que la amenaza haya terminado, ni que nuestra respuesta vaya a detenerse'. He also noted, '... acept\u00e9 su opini\u00f3n', after the emergency committee concluded the situation had improved. The vaccine JYNNEOS (Imvanex/Imvamune) remains a key tool, especially in the United States, Canada and EU member states.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[Exc\u00e9lsior](https://www.excelsior.com.mx/global/mpox-oms-fin-emergencia-sanitaria/1737798)\n\n**WHO says mpox no longer a global public health emergency**\nOn 6 September 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the spread of mpox in Africa no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The decision followed a meeting of WHO\u2019s Emergency Committee, which convenes quarterly to assess the outbreak. In a media briefing, WHO Director\u2011General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'Yesterday, they met again and advised me that in their view, the situation no longer represents an international health emergency. I have accepted that advice.' He explained that the decision is based on sustained declines in cases and deaths in Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The committee also noted that the WHO will continue to monitor the situation, 'nor that our response will stop, and we note the Africa CDC's decision yesterday that mpox remains a continental emergency.' The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) confirmed that new surges were observed in Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania, even as weekly confirmed cases fell by 52\u202f%. The WHO declared the outbreak a PHEIC in August 2024; since May\u202f2022, more than 100 countries and regions worldwide have reported mpox cases. The article stresses that flare\u2011ups may still occur and that ongoing surveillance and response capacity are essential, especially for vulnerable groups such as young children and people living with HIV. Mpox is a viral zoonotic disease with initial symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain and swollen lymph nodes, which can progress to widespread rashes; most infected individuals recover within weeks, though severe illness or death can occur.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 01:17 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/05/who-says-mpox-no-longer-a-global-public-health-emergency/)\n\n**WHO Lifts MPOX International Public Health Emergency**\nOn September 5, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had lifted the international public health emergency (PHEIC) status for monkeypox (MPOX).
