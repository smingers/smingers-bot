Williams, Allison Berke, Casey Aveggio, Saskia Popescu, and Aurelia Attal-Juncqua (RAND researchers):**\n\n- \"The United States is failing to act decisively against the growing H5N1 threat\"\n- \"Time is running out to contain this threat before it spirals out of control\"\n- \"The ongoing H5N1 outbreak among U.S. dairy farms is proving to be a painful indicator of ever-present failures in response, coordination, and prioritization\"\n- \"Failing to act decisively risks repeating the missteps of early COVID-19 response efforts\"\n- A recent study found that \"a single amino acid mutation allows H5N1 to bind human hemagglutinin (HA) receptors, readily enabling human infection and human-to-human spread\"\n\n## Recommendations Made:\n\nThe article presents three recommendations (though the text appears cut off before completing all three):\n\n1. **Declare H5N1 a PHE** and mandate nationwide testing of dairy and beef cattle, with increased testing of farm/dairy workers, livestock vaccinations, and indemnity payments\n2. USDA has announced a plan to test milk nationwide, but there is no mandate to test farm workers or dairy cows not shipped across state lines\n\n**Note**: The article text appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence while discussing USDA compensation for farmers.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1880-1959.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"1880-1959 Highlights in the History of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Timeline\"\n\n**Source:** CDC Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) webpage  \n**Date:** April 30, 2024\n\n## Key Content:\n\nThis article provides a historical timeline of avian influenza outbreaks and related events from 1880-1959.

WHO Emergency-Committee meetings or other official statements on H5N1, 2023 \u2013 Feb 2026  \nWHO has not convened an International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee on H5N1 during this period; the public record contains only technical risk-assessment products:  \n\u2022 24 Jan 2023 DON \u2013 Ecuador paediatric case  \n\u2022 24 & 28 Feb 2023 DONs \u2013 Cambodia father/daughter cluster  \n\u2022 21 Apr 2023 DON 461 \u2013 first Chilean case (clade 2.3.4.4b)  \n\u2022 9 Apr 2024 DON 512 \u2013 second U.S. case, first presumed cow-to-human transmission in Texas (WHO, 9 Apr 2024)  \n\u2022 30 Mar 2024 Departmental Update \u2013 \u201c2023: outbreaks of avian influenza\u201d (WHO)  \n\u2022 5 Dec 2025 DON 590 \u2013 first recorded human A(H5N5) infection and death, Washington State, USA (WHO, 5 Dec 2025)  \n\nOther agencies issued supportive guidance: CDC interim prevention recommendations for HPAI A(H5N1) (26 Dec 2024) summarise U.S. policy for exposed workers (CDC, 26 Dec 2024).  None of these notices involved a formal IHR Emergency-Committee deliberation.\n\n3. Summary of human cases and geographic spread (Jan 2023 \u2013 1 Feb 2026)  \n\nNorth America  \n\u2022 United States: 71 laboratory-confirmed A(H5) infections since early 2024, mostly linked to poultry or dairy cattle. 69 were A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, 2 were A(H5N5). Two fatalities have occurred: an elderly backyard-flock owner in Louisiana (A(H5N1), 6 Jan 2025 \u2013 Today.com, previously cited) and an older backyard-flock owner in Washington State (A(H5N5), died 21 Nov 2025 \u2013 WHO DON 590; CBS News, 21 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 Canada: one critical paediatric A(H5N1) case, British Columbia, autumn 2024 (Today.com, earlier search set), no deaths.  \n\nLatin America & Caribbean  \n\u2022 Ecuador: 1 paediatric case, Jan 2023 (WHO DON).  \n\u2022 Chile: 1 adult case, Apr 2023, fatal (WHO DON 461).  \nNo further WHO-confirmed human H5 infections reported from South America through Feb 2026.\n\nAsia\u2013Pacific  \n\u2022 Cambodia: 6 cases in 2023 with one death (WHO departmental update, 30 Mar 2024).  No additional WHO-confirmed cases in 2024-25.\n\nEurope, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean  \nNo human H5 cases have been published by WHO for 2023-early 2026.\n\nCumulative tallies, Jan 2023 \u2013 1 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 United States 71 cases / 2 deaths  \n\u2022 Canada 1 / 0  \n\u2022 Latin America 2 / 1  \n\u2022 Cambodia 6 / 1  \nTotal 80 laboratory-confirmed cases, 4 deaths.  WHO\u2019s global cumulative table (last posted 14 Jul 2023) still shows 873 cases and 458 deaths since 2003; updated global totals for 2024-26 have not yet been issued, so the figures above are compiled from individual event reports.\n\nClinical picture: the majority of U.S. infections during the dairy-cattle outbreak presented with conjunctivitis only, whereas the two U.S. fatalities and the 2023 Chilean fatality involved severe respiratory disease.\n\n4. Current animal outbreaks and virological evolution  \n\n\u2022 The clade 2.3.4.4b panzootic continues to circulate in poultry and wild birds on every continent except Antarctica, with repeated incursions into mammals.  FAO\u2019s \u201cIgua\u00e7u Statement\u201d (16 Oct 2025) acknowledges HPAI as one of today\u2019s most serious animal- and public-health threats and endorses a 2024-2033 Global Strategy for HPAI control (FAO, 16 Oct 2025).  \n\u2022 United States: detections in wild birds reported in all 50 states since 2022, and in backyard or commercial poultry flocks in 48 states (WHO DON 512).  A multistate outbreak in dairy cattle, first disclosed 25 Mar 2024, had spread to 15 states by Nov 2024 (CDC interim guidance, 26 Dec 2024) and to 17 states with 1 075 herds by June 2025 (Nature comment previously cited).  \n\u2022 Marine-mammal events: large die-offs of sea-lions and elephant seals in Peru, Chile and Argentina continued in 2024\u201325 (EID paper list, Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 Virus diversification: two bovine-adapted genotypes are currently tracked \u2013 B3.13 (first detected March 2024) and D1.1 (emerged Aug 2024, carried the PB2 E627K mutation in the Louisiana fatal case).  In November 2025 an A(H5N5) reassortant belonging to the same 2.3.4.4b HA clade caused the first recorded human H5N5 infection and death (WHO DON 590).  \n\n5.

Remaining information gaps  \na. WHO does not publish minutes of informal expert consultations; any closed-door H5N1 discussions remain undisclosed.  \nb. Consolidated WHO global human-case tables have not been updated beyond July 2023, so totals for 2024-26 rely on individual DONs and national reports.  \nc. Comprehensive WOAH statistics for poultry losses during 2025\u201326 are not available in the public search results; only narrative summaries are accessible.  \nd. An explicit WHO risk assessment addressing the public-health implications of the U.S. dairy-cattle epizootic has not yet been released.  \n\n7. Conclusions  \n\u2022 Up to 1 Feb 2026 WHO has declared eight PHEICs \u2013 none for avian influenza.  \n\u2022 No WHO IHR Emergency-Committee meeting has been convened for H5N1/H5N5 during 2023-26; official communications comprise six Disease-Outbreak-News items and one departmental review.  \n\u2022 Human A(H5) activity since 2023 is dominated by the unprecedented U.S. cluster linked to dairy cattle and poultry exposure (71 cases, 2 deaths).  Outside North America only sporadic cases have occurred (Ecuador, Chile, Cambodia).  \n\u2022 In animals the clade 2.3.4.4b panzootic persists, with sustained circulation in birds, spill-over into multiple mammalian species, and a large-scale outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle.  \n\u2022 Continued global surveillance, virus sharing and One-Health coordination \u2013 emphasised in the October 2025 Igua\u00e7u Statement \u2013 are essential while the overall human-to-human transmission risk remains assessed as \u201clow\u201d.</Agent_report>\n"
