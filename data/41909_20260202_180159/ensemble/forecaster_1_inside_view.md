Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Q3 2025 Earnings Data (Oct 30, 2025):**
Multiple high-quality sources (Fierce Pharma, Benzinga, Yahoo Finance) report Q3 2025 Mounjaro revenue at $6.52B globally, beating consensus estimates of ~$5.5B. U.S. revenue $3.55B (+49% YoY), international $2.97B (up from $728M in Q3 2024). These are factual earnings data from official company releases.

**Q4 2024 Historical Data (Jan 2025):**
PR Newswire (primary source) reports Q4 2024 Mounjaro at $3.53B worldwide, with U.S. at $2.63B (+25% YoY) and international at $898.9M. Factual data from official earnings.

**Recent Context (Feb 2, 2026):**
- Pittsburgh's Action News 4 (Feb 2, 2026): Reports Q3 2025 combined Zepbound/Mounjaro sales at $10B, confirming continued momentum. Eli Lilly announcing new $3.5B Pennsylvania facility for injectable drugs.
- CNBC (Feb 1, 2026): Week-ahead preview noting Eli Lilly earnings on Wednesday (Feb 5, 2026) will be scrutinized for GLP-1 drug sales and orforglipron FDA approval timing. This confirms Q4 2025 results will be reported shortly after today's date.
- Novo Nordisk competitive context (Feb 2, 2026): UBS notes CagriSema failed to achieve statistical superiority over Mounjaro, requiring ~2.5% greater weight loss. This strengthens Mounjaro's competitive position.

**Supply Chain Updates:**
- Fierce Pharma (Dec 30, 2024): FDA removed Mounjaro from shortage list in October 2024 after 22-month shortage. Multiple billion-dollar manufacturing investments announced, but Lebanon facility won't be operational until "near end of 2026."
- Fierce Pharma (Aug 8, 2024): Q2 2024 Mounjaro at $3.09B, with supply improvements noted but periodic tightness expected.

**Expert Opinions:**
- CEO Dave Ricks (multiple sources): Attributes growth to "strong international performance" and describes manufacturing as "top priority."
- J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott: Q3 results "dispel GLP-1 market concerns."
- Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger: Notes pills may serve different patient segments than injectables.

**Quarterly Revenue Progression (Factual Data):**
- Q4 2023: $2.2B
- Q1 2024: $1.81B (-17.7% Q-o-Q)
- Q2 2024: $3.09B (+70.7%)
- Q3 2024: ~$3.1B (inferred from context)
- Q4 2024: $3.53B
- Q1 2025: $3.84B (+8.8%)
- Q2 2025: $5.2B (+35.4%)
- Q3 2025: $6.52B (+25.4%)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large prediction shifts warranted):**
1. **Consistent sequential growth acceleration through Q3 2025**: Multiple independent sources confirm $6.52B in Q3 2025, representing 109% YoY growth. This is structural momentum, not volatility.
2. **International expansion trajectory**: International revenue grew from $728M (Q3 2024) to $2.97B (Q3 2025), a 308% increase. China, Brazil, India launches are factual market entries with demonstrated early traction.
3. **Market share dominance**: 60% of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions vs Novo's 42% (multiple sources). CagriSema's failure to beat Mounjaro statistically removes near-term competitive threat.
4. **Supply normalization**: FDA shortage delisting in October 2024 is institutional fact, enabling demand fulfillment.

**Moderate Evidence (Moderate shifts):**
1. **Seasonal Q1 patterns**: Historical data shows Q4→Q1 weakness in 2023-24 (-17.7%) but growth in 2024-25 (+8.8%). Pattern exists but direction uncertain.
2. **Pricing pressure noted**: Q3 2025 commentary mentions lower realized prices offsetting volume. Trend documented but magnitude unclear.
3. **Manufacturing capacity timing**: Lebanon facility "near end of 2026" suggests Q1 2026 won't benefit from major new capacity. Limits upside.
4. **Q4 2025 results pending**: We're forecasting Q1 2026 without knowing Q4 2025 baseline. CNBC notes earnings report on Feb 5, 2026 (3 days from now).

**Weak Evidence (Small adjustments):**
1. **Compounding pharmacy dynamics**: Anecdotal evidence of competition from compounders, but impact unclear.
2. **Orforglipron launch timing**: Expected "early 2026" per CEO, but approval/launch timing speculative and wouldn't impact Q1 significantly.
3. **$550M pre-launch inventory charge**: Analyst opinion this signals confidence, but indirect causal link.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), reported ~April 30, 2026. This is 2.5-3 months from today (Feb 2, 2026). Q1 is currently underway (1 month in progress).

**If timeframe halved (6 weeks = mid-Q1 2026):**
Would predict based on January 2026 trends only. Less seasonal pattern visibility, more weight on December momentum. Would narrow confidence intervals significantly as less time for deviations.

**If timeframe doubled (6 months = Q1+Q2 2026):**
Would incorporate Q2 seasonal strength (historically strongest quarter). Would widen confidence intervals for compounding uncertainties. Would place more weight on manufacturing capacity additions and competitive dynamics.

**Current Timeframe Implications:**
- Q1 is typically weaker than Q4 (insurance resets, holiday effects)
- International momentum may offset U.S. seasonality
- Supply normalization continues but no major capacity additions
- One month already elapsed reduces uncertainty vs. full quarter forecast

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Anchor:** Q3 2025 = $6.52B

**Key Factors Shifting Prediction:**

1. **Sequential Growth Deceleration (Moderate downward pressure):**
   - Q1→Q2 2025: +35.4%
   - Q2→Q3 2025: +25.4%
   - Pattern suggests Q3→Q4 might be +15-20%, Q4→Q1 might be +5-15%
   - Base enlargement naturally decelerates percentage growth

2. **International Acceleration (Strong upward pressure):**
   - International grew 308% YoY in Q3 2025
   - New market launches (China, Brazil, India) in early stages
   - Could add $500M-$1B in Q1 2026 vs Q1 2025

3. **Seasonal Q1 Patterns (Moderate uncertainty):**
   - 2023-24: -17.7% Q-o-Q
   - 2024-25: +8.8% Q-o-Q
   - Inconsistent historical pattern suggests 2026 could range from flat to +15%

4. **Competitive Position Strengthening (Moderate upward pressure):**
   - CagriSema failure removes near-term threat
   - Market share gains continuing
   - But pricing pressure noted in Q3

5. **Supply Constraints Easing (Moderate upward pressure):**
   - Shortage delisting enables demand fulfillment
   - But Lebanon facility not yet operational

**Scenario Modeling:**

*Conservative (25th percentile): $7.0B*
- Q4 2025 at $7.5B (+15% from Q3)
- Q1 2026 flat to slight decline (-5% to 0%)
- Seasonal weakness dominates

*Base Case (50th percentile): $8.0B*
- Q4 2025 at $7.8B (+20% from Q3)
- Q1 2026 modest growth (+2-3%)
- International offsets U.S. seasonality

*Optimistic (75th percentile): $8.8B*
- Q4 2025 at $8.2B (+25% from Q3)
- Q1 2026 continued momentum (+7-8%)
- International acceleration exceeds expectations

*Extreme Upside (90th percentile): $9.5B*
- Supply breakthrough or exceptional international
- Requires sustained 20%+ quarterly growth

*Extreme Downside (10th percentile): $6.5B*
- Severe seasonal weakness or competitive disruption
- Insurance coverage changes or pricing pressure

**Distribution Shape Considerations:**
- Positive skew: Management confidence, international momentum, competitive wins
- Fat right tail: Potential supply breakthroughs, faster international adoption
- Left tail bounded: Established product with proven demand, downside limited by baseline

## Probability Calibration

**Critical Unknown:** Q4 2025 results report on Feb 5, 2026 (3 days from now) will establish the baseline for Q1 2026 forecasting. Current prediction must account for Q4 uncertainty.

**Q4 2025 Estimate:**
- Q3 2025 at $6.52B
- Deceleration pattern suggests +15-25% growth
- Range: $7.5B-$8.2B, median ~$7.8B

**Q1 2026 from Q4 2025 Baseline:**
- Historical Q4→Q1 ranges from -17.7% to +8.8%
- International momentum suggests positive bias
- Range: -5% to +15%, median ~+3%

**Combined Estimate:**
- Q4 median $7.8B × Q1 growth median 1.03 = $8.0B
- 10th percentile: $7.5B × 0.87 = $6.5B
- 90th percentile: $8.2B × 1.15 = $9.4B

**Confidence Adjustments:**
- Widen intervals for Q4 uncertainty (unknown baseline)
- Positive skew for international acceleration
- Cap extreme upside (manufacturing constraints)
- Floor downside (established demand)

Checklist:
1. Target: Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar) Mounjaro global revenue in dollars, reported ~April 30, 2026
2. Base rate: Q3 2025 = $6.52B, historical sequential growth decelerating but positive
3. Consistency: Implied median $8.0B (+23% from Q3 2025), mean ~$8.2B (positive skew); aligns with deceleration + international growth
4. Key evidence: (1) Q3 2025 at $6.52B with 25% sequential growth, (2) International up 308% YoY, (3) Historical Q1 shows -17.7% to +8.8% Q-o-Q, (4) CagriSema competitive failure, (5) Supply normalization ongoing
5. Blind spot: Q4 2025 results (3 days away) could show unexpected acceleration or deceleration, shifting Q1 baseline significantly. Would push outcome up if Q4 beats $8.5B, down if below $7.0B.
