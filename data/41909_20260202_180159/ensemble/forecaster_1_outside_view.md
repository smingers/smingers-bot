Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance (Oct 30, 2025) - Q3 2025 Results:**
High-quality primary source reporting actual Q3 2025 results: Mounjaro global sales $6.52B (up 109% YoY), beating estimates of $5.48B. U.S. sales $3.55B, international $2.97B. This is factual earnings data, not opinion.

**CNBC (Oct 30, 2025) - Q3 2025 Results:**
High-quality source corroborating Q3 2025 figures: $6.52B revenue. CEO Dave Ricks' opinion that tirzepatide is "the real star" and attribution of beat to "strong international performance" (China, Brazil, India launches). The revenue figures are factual; strategic commentary is expert opinion from the CEO.

**BioPharma Dive (Oct 30, 2025) - Q3 2025 Analysis:**
High-quality source noting combined Zepbound/Mounjaro revenue of $10.1B in Q3 2025, making tirzepatide the world's best-selling drug (surpassing Keytruda's $8.1B). Factual market positioning data with Leerink Partners analysis showing 9% revenue beat.

**24/7 Wall St (Aug 6, 2025) - Q1 2025 Historical:**
Medium-quality retrospective source providing Q1 2025 Mounjaro revenue of $3.8B. The investment thesis opinions are less relevant; the Q1 figure is the key factual data point.

**BioPharma Dive (Nov 2024) - Novo Nordisk Q3 2024:**
Medium-quality competitive intelligence showing Wegovy Q3 2024 at $2.5B vs Zepbound at $1.3B. Provides market context but limited direct Mounjaro data.

**Drug Discovery Trends (Apr 4, 2024) - Historical Context:**
Medium-quality source providing historical baseline: Q4 2023 Mounjaro at $2.2B, full-year 2023 at $5.16B. GlobalData's opinion projecting $27B by 2029 is speculative but from a named research firm.

**Agent Report - Quarterly Sales Compilation:**
Excellent synthesis compiling quarterly progression from primary sources:
- 2023: Q1 $567M → Q2 $980M → Q3 $1,400M → Q4 $2,200M
- 2024: Q1 $1,810M → Q2 $3,090M → Q4 $3,530M
- 2025: Q1 $3,840M → Q2 $5,200M → Q3 $6,520M

The report notes Q3 2024 data is missing from public releases but available in 10-Q. Manufacturing capacity commentary indicates Lebanon facility starting "near end of 2026" with no specific volume targets disclosed.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Mounjaro's own quarterly sequential growth (2023-2025):** Most suitable. Direct historical pattern of the same product.
   - Q-o-Q growth rates show acceleration: early 2023 saw ~70% growth, mid-2024 saw ~70% growth, recent quarters (Q2-Q3 2025) showed ~25% growth
   - Pattern suggests deceleration from triple-digit to more moderate double-digit growth as base enlarges

2. **Blockbuster GLP-1 drug launches:** Moderately suitable. Wegovy/Ozempic provide competitive context but different market timing and indications.

3. **Fastest-growing pharmaceutical launches historically:** Less suitable. Too heterogeneous across therapeutic areas.

**Selected Reference Class:** Mounjaro's own quarterly trajectory (2023-2025) is most appropriate given consistent product, market, and regulatory environment.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), reported ~April 30, 2026. This is approximately 3 months from today (Feb 2, 2026).

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**

Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth:
- Q4 2023→Q1 2024: -17.7% (seasonal dip)
- Q1 2024→Q2 2024: +70.7%
- Q2 2024→Q3 2024: Unknown (data gap)
- Q3 2024→Q4 2024: Unknown (assuming ~$4.5B for Q3 would give ~-21.6% Q-o-Q)
- Q4 2024→Q1 2025: +8.8%
- Q1 2025→Q2 2025: +35.4%
- Q2 2025→Q3 2025: +25.4%

**Key Observations:**
1. Q1 tends to show weakness vs Q4 (holiday/year-end effects, insurance resets)
2. Recent quarters show decelerating but still strong growth
3. International expansion (China, Brazil, India) driving recent beats
4. Supply constraints easing but Lebanon facility not operational until "near end of 2026"

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
Q3 2025 revenue: $6,520M

**Growth Scenarios:**

*Conservative (Q-o-Q decline similar to Q4→Q1 pattern):*
- Historical Q4→Q1 showed -17.7% (2023-24) and +8.8% (2024-25)
- If Q4 2025 is ~$7.5B and Q1 2026 shows flat to slight decline: $7.0-7.8B range

*Moderate (Continued deceleration):*
- Q2→Q3 2025 showed +25.4% growth
- If Q3→Q4 2025 shows +15% ($7.5B) and Q4→Q1 2026 shows +5-10%: $7.9-8.3B range

*Optimistic (Sustained momentum):*
- International expansion accelerating
- Market share gains continuing (60% of new prescriptions)
- If quarterly growth maintains 15-20%: $8.5-9.0B range

**Risk Factors:**
- Seasonal Q1 weakness typical
- Pricing pressure (noted in Q3 2025)
- Competition from Novo Nordisk
- Manufacturing capacity still ramping (Lebanon not online)
- Potential insurance coverage changes in new year

**Upside Factors:**
- Strong international momentum (China, Brazil, India)
- Market leadership position strengthening
- Demand exceeding supply historically
- Cardiovascular indication expansion potential

## Outside View Calibration

The distribution should reflect:

1. **Central tendency:** $7.5-8.5B based on sequential patterns and momentum
2. **Downside tail:** Seasonal Q1 weakness, competitive pressure, or coverage disruptions could push toward $6.5-7.0B (10th percentile)
3. **Upside tail:** Exceptional international growth or supply breakthrough could reach $9.0-9.5B (90th percentile)
4. **Asymmetry:** Slight positive skew given management confidence and international trajectory, but Q1 seasonality caps extreme upside

Historical upset rate in pharmaceutical forecasting: ~20-30% of quarters see >10% deviation from consensus. The recent track record shows consistent beats, suggesting forecasts may be systematically conservative.

Given Q3 2025 at $6.52B and typical Q1 patterns, a wide confidence interval is prudent:
- 10th percentile: Conservative seasonal weakness
- 50th percentile: Modest sequential growth with international offset
- 90th percentile: Strong momentum continuation despite seasonality
