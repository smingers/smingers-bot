Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Primary Sources:**
1. **Eli Lilly Q3 2025 earnings (Oct 30, 2025)** - Multiple sources report Mounjaro Q3 2025 revenue at $6.52 billion globally ($3.55B US, $2.97B international), up 109% YoY. This is factual data from SEC filings. High reliability.

2. **Q4 2024 results (Feb 2025, PR Newswire)** - Mounjaro Q4 2024: $3.53 billion worldwide, 60% YoY growth. Primary source, high reliability.

3. **Historical quarterly progression** - From context summaries:
   - Q4 2023: ~$2.2B (implied from growth rates)
   - Q1 2024: Data available but not explicitly stated
   - Q2 2024: $3.09B (from Aug 2024 article)
   - Q3 2024: $3.112B (from Nov 2025 article)
   - Q4 2024: $3.53B
   - Q1 2025: Estimated ~$4.8B (from growth trajectory)
   - Q2 2025: Estimated ~$5.2B (from 35% Q-o-Q growth mentioned)
   - Q3 2025: $6.52B

**Recent News (Feb 2026):**
4. **Pennsylvania plant announcement (Feb 2, 2026)** - Eli Lilly investing $3.5B in new facility for injectable drugs including retatrutide. Construction 2026-2031. Confirms continued capacity expansion but won't impact Q1 2026.

5. **Novo Nordisk competitive pressure (Feb 2, 2026)** - UBS notes CagriSema failed to achieve statistical superiority over Mounjaro in comparative study. This is moderate positive evidence for Mounjaro's competitive position.

6. **Q3 2025 context** - Combined tirzepatide (Mounjaro + Zepbound) reached $10.1B in Q3 2025, exceeding Keytruda. Mounjaro captured ~60% of US GLP-1 prescriptions.

**Supply Context:**
7. **FDA shortage resolution (Oct 2024)** - Mounjaro removed from shortage list after 22 months. Supply constraints easing but not eliminated.

8. **Manufacturing investments** - Multiple facilities ramping: Lebanon IN plant ($5.3B), North Carolina plant (operational by end 2024), Puerto Rico expansion ($1.2B, announced Oct 2025 for oral drugs).

**Expert Opinions (Identifiable):**
- **JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott**: Results "dispel GLP-1 market concerns"
- **Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez**: GLP-1 market could reach $150B by early 2030s
- **Citi Research**: Mounjaro Q3 beat consensus by ~$1B

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Consistent quarterly acceleration through Q3 2025** - Q-o-Q growth: Q2→Q3 2024 (+0.6%), Q3→Q4 2024 (+13.4%), Q1→Q2 2025 (+8.3% estimated), Q2→Q3 2025 (+25.4%). This shows sustained momentum with supply constraints easing.

2. **Manufacturing capacity coming online** - Multiple plants operational or ramping in late 2025/early 2026. North Carolina facility expected to ship products in 2025, providing incremental supply for Q1 2026.

3. **Competitive positioning strengthening** - Novo's CagriSema failed superiority test vs Mounjaro; Lilly holds ~60% US GLP-1 prescription share. This supports sustained demand.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **International expansion accelerating** - International revenue grew from $728M (Q3 2024) to $2.97B (Q3 2025), 308% growth. This suggests runway for continued international growth in Q1 2026.

2. **Seasonality factors** - Typical Q1 deductible resets could dampen US growth 5-10%, but this may be offset by continued supply improvements and international momentum.

3. **Q4 2025 trajectory** - If Q3→Q4 2025 follows historical deceleration pattern (+15-20% vs +25%), Q4 2025 would land at $7.5-7.8B.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Orforglipron launch timing** - Oral GLP-1 expected "early 2026" approval. Unlikely to materially impact Q1 2026 Mounjaro sales even if approved, as ramp takes quarters.

2. **Price pressure mentions** - Articles note "lower realized prices" but growth continues to be volume-driven. Net impact unclear for Q1 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 ends March 31, 2026 (58 days from now). Results typically reported late April/early May 2026 (~90 days).

**If timeframe halved (Q2 2025 → Q3 2025, ~45 days):**
Historical data shows Q2→Q3 2025 growth was +25.4% ($5.2B → $6.52B). Shorter timeframes in high-growth phase show stronger momentum.

**If timeframe doubled (Q1 2026 → Q3 2026, ~180 days):**
Would expect further deceleration as market matures and supply fully catches up with demand. Growth likely moderates to +10-15% per quarter, suggesting Q3 2026 could reach $9-10B.

**Q1 2026 Specific Factors:**
- 2-3 months of additional North Carolina capacity ramping
- Full quarter of post-shortage normalized supply
- Potential Q1 seasonality headwinds (5-10% drag)
- Continued international expansion momentum
- No major competitive launches expected

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

**Base Rate Anchoring:**
Outside view established Q4 2025 at ~$7.6B based on +17% sequential growth from Q3 2025's $6.52B. This deceleration rate aligns with capacity constraints easing but not eliminated.

**Key Adjustments for Q1 2026:**

1. **Supply expansion (+8-12%)**: North Carolina facility ramping, Lebanon plant expanding. This is the primary growth driver, partially offset by:

2. **Seasonal headwinds (-3-5%)**: Q1 typically sees deductible resets and channel inventory adjustments. However, 2025 showed muted seasonality due to supply constraints. With better supply, some seasonality returns but not full historical magnitude.

3. **International momentum (+3-5%)**: International grew 308% YoY in Q3 2025. Even with deceleration, this segment has significant runway. Europe doubling, China/Japan each >$500M suggests Q1 2026 international could reach $3.5-4B (vs $2.97B in Q3 2025).

4. **Competitive dynamics (neutral to +2%)**: Novo's CagriSema setback and Lilly's 60% prescription share supports pricing power and volume retention.

**Net Effect:** Base of $7.6B (Q4 2025) × 1.05-1.10 = $7.98-8.36B for Q1 2026.

**Distribution Considerations:**
- **Downside risks**: Worse-than-expected seasonality, manufacturing delays, aggressive Novo pricing response, allocation shift to Zepbound
- **Upside risks**: Faster capacity ramp, weaker seasonality than expected, international beat, pent-up demand release
- **Volatility**: Historical quarterly variance ~$0.8-1.2B. With improving supply predictability, variance may compress slightly to ~$1B.

Probability calibration:

**Central Tendency:** $7.8-8.2B range captures most likely outcomes given:
- Q4 2025 exit rate of ~$7.6B
- Net +5-8% sequential growth from supply gains partially offset by seasonality
- Continued strong international performance

**Confidence Intervals:**
- **10th-90th percentile range**: $6.8-9.2B (~$2.4B spread, or ±15% from median)
  - Lower bound: Significant seasonality + manufacturing hiccup + demand softness
  - Upper bound: Minimal seasonality + capacity surge + international beat

**Tail Scenarios:**
- **1st percentile ($6.0B)**: Major supply disruption, severe competitive pressure, or significant demand shock. Unlikely given established momentum.
- **99th percentile ($10.0B)**: Exceptional capacity ramp + minimal seasonality + major international expansion. Possible but requires multiple positive surprises.

**Distribution Shape:** Slightly right-skewed (positive tail fatter than negative) because:
1. Supply improvements are more likely to surprise positively than negatively
2. International growth has more upside runway
3. Competitive dynamics favoring Lilly

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Mounjaro global Q1 2026 revenue in USD, reported in May 2026 earnings (Q ending March 31, 2026)

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established ~$7.2B based on Q4 2025 estimated at $7.6B with modest sequential growth. Final prediction shifts upward to $7.9B median due to stronger evidence of capacity expansion and weaker seasonality impact than initially assumed.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = $7.9B; mean ≈ $8.0B (slight right skew). This represents +21% sequential growth from Q3 2025 ($6.52B), which aligns with deceleration from Q2→Q3 growth of +25% and accounts for one additional quarter of capacity ramp.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Q3 2025 actual: $6.52B with 109% YoY growth (factual, high confidence)
   - Multiple manufacturing facilities ramping Q4 2025/Q1 2026 (strong evidence)
   - International revenue 308% YoY growth with continued expansion runway (strong evidence)
   - Novo CagriSema failed superiority vs Mounjaro; Lilly holds 60% US share (moderate evidence)
   - Historical Q1 seasonality typically -5-10%, but muted in supply-constrained environment (moderate evidence)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Eli Lilly aggressively shifts tirzepatide allocation from Mounjaro (diabetes) to Zepbound (obesity) due to higher margins or strategic priorities. This would push Mounjaro revenue DOWN significantly (potentially to $6.5-7.0B range) while total tirzepatide remains strong. Probability: ~15%. This risk is partially captured in my 10th-20th percentile range.
