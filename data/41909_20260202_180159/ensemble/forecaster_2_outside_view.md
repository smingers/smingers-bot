## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Mounjaro's own sequential quarterly growth (Q1 2024 - Q3 2025)**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most direct reference
   - Pattern: Q1'24=$1.81B → Q2'24=$3.09B → Q3'24=~$3.1B(implied) → Q4'24=$3.53B → Q1'25=$3.84B → Q2'25=$5.20B → Q3'25=$6.52B
   - Shows acceleration in 2025, particularly Q2-Q3 2025

2. **Blockbuster GLP-1 drug launches (Wegovy, Ozempic trajectory)**
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Similar mechanism but different competitive landscape
   - Less suitable because Mounjaro entered market with established GLP-1 awareness

3. **Top-selling pharmaceutical launches reaching $20B+ annual run rate**
   - Suitability: LOW - Too heterogeneous; different therapeutic areas have different dynamics
   - Humira, Keytruda had different market conditions

**Selected reference class:** Mounjaro's own quarterly progression (2024-2025), with attention to seasonal patterns and capacity constraints.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026), resolving ~May 2, 2026
- From today (Feb 2, 2026): Q1 2026 is essentially complete; we're forecasting reported results
- Time until resolution: ~90 days

**Historical quarterly progression analysis:**

Recent quarters show strong acceleration:
- Q1'25 → Q2'25: +35.4% QoQ ($3.84B → $5.20B)
- Q2'25 → Q3'25: +25.4% QoQ ($5.20B → $6.52B)
- Q3'25 → Q4'25: Unknown but typically strong (holiday season effects, year-end insurance utilization)

Year-over-year Q1 comparisons:
- Q1'24 = $1.81B
- Q1'25 = $3.84B (+112% YoY)
- Q1'26 = ? (would need ~100% YoY growth to reach $7.7B, more conservative 70% would yield $6.5B)

Seasonal considerations:
- Q1 typically shows strong demand (new insurance coverage, deductible resets in January)
- However, Q1 can also show sequential decline from Q4 due to fewer days, post-holiday normalization
- Q1'25 showed -8% QoQ decline from Q4'24 ($3.84B vs $3.53B represents growth, but slower than mid-year quarters)

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Growth drivers supporting continued expansion:**
1. **International expansion:** CEO explicitly cited China, Brazil, India launches driving Q3 2025 beat
2. **Market share dominance:** 60% of new prescriptions, taking share from Novo Nordisk
3. **Capacity expansion:** Multiple facilities ramping through 2026, though Lebanon IN won't contribute until late 2026
4. **Unmet demand:** Historical supply constraints suggest pent-up demand

**Moderating factors:**
1. **Sequential Q4→Q1 pattern:** Q4'24→Q1'25 showed only 8.8% growth despite strong market
2. **Pricing pressure:** Management noted "lower realized prices" offsetting volume gains
3. **Base effect:** At $6.52B quarterly run rate, maintaining 25%+ QoQ growth becomes increasingly difficult
4. **Capacity constraints:** New facilities ramping but not yet at full capacity in Q1 2026

**Modeling approach:**
Given Q3'25 = $6.52B, I need to estimate Q4'25 and then Q1'26.

Q4'25 estimate: Likely $7.2-7.8B range
- Historical Q3→Q4 growth: Q3'24→Q4'24 showed ~14% growth (implied)
- Applying 10-20% QoQ growth: $6.52B × 1.15 = $7.5B midpoint

Q1'26 from Q4'25:
- Scenario 1 (modest sequential): Q4'25=$7.5B, Q1'26 shows flat to +5% = $7.5-7.9B
- Scenario 2 (continued momentum): Q4'25=$7.5B, Q1'26 shows +10-15% = $8.25-8.6B
- Scenario 3 (acceleration): Strong international + capacity = $8.5-9.5B

**Risk factors:**
- Regulatory changes, tariff impacts (CEO mentioned guidance excludes new pharmaceutical tariffs)
- Competitive response from Novo Nordisk
- Supply chain disruptions
- Reimbursement/coverage changes

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring on Q3 2025 baseline:** $6.52B

**Key calibration considerations:**

1. **Growth trajectory sustainability:** The 109% YoY growth seen in Q3'25 is exceptional but likely unsustainable. More realistic is 60-80% YoY growth for Q1'26 vs Q1'25 ($3.84B), yielding $6.1-6.9B. However, this seems conservative given Q2 and Q3 2025 momentum.

2. **Sequential quarterly pattern:** 
   - Optimistic path: Q3'25 ($6.52B) → Q4'25 (+18%) → Q1'26 (+8%) = $8.4B
   - Moderate path: Q3'25 ($6.52B) → Q4'25 (+12%) → Q1'26 (+3%) = $7.5B  
   - Conservative path: Q3'25 ($6.52B) → Q4'25 (+8%) → Q1'26 (-2%) = $6.9B

3. **Market saturation concerns:** At current trajectory, Mounjaro alone would exceed $30B annual run rate. While GLP-1 market projected at $100B by 2030, rapid growth may face headwinds from:
   - Pricing pressure (already noted by management)
   - Insurance coverage limitations
   - Market penetration ceilings

4. **Capacity as constraint vs. enabler:** New facilities ramping suggests supply will support demand, but full Lebanon IN contribution won't occur until late 2026.

5. **Distribution shape:** Given uncertainty between $6.5B-$9.5B reasonable range:
   - Low tail risk: Significant adverse event, regulatory action, or competitive disruption could push below $6B (10th percentile)
   - High tail risk: Exceptional international uptake + full capacity realization could push above $9B (90th percentile)

**Percentile calibration logic:**
- 10th percentile: Pessimistic scenario with sequential decline or flat growth from Q3'25 levels = $6,300M
- 20th percentile: Modest growth maintaining Q1'25 to Q3'25 momentum but with seasonal softness = $6,800M
- 40th percentile: Moderate sequential growth, conservative YoY expansion = $7,400M
- 60th percentile: Continued momentum with typical Q1 seasonality = $7,900M
- 80th percentile: Strong performance with international acceleration = $8,500M
- 90th percentile: Exceptional growth, capacity fully utilized, minimal pricing pressure = $9,200M
