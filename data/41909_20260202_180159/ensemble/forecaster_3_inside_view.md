Analysis:

1) Target variable / resolution
- This resolves to Eli Lilly’s reported “Global” (or “Total”) net sales for Mounjaro in Q1 2026 (quarter ending 2026-03-31), in the first official earnings release or 10-Q.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each source contributes; quality; facts vs opinions)

Primary/near-primary financial datapoints
- PRNewswire (Lilly Q4 2024 results; published 2025-02-06): High quality (company release). Fact: Q4 2024 worldwide Mounjaro revenue 3530000000 (US 2630000000; international 898900000). Useful as an earlier anchor and to show international ramp.
- DrugDiscoveryTrends (2025-11-03): Medium-high quality (trade press summarizing earnings). Fact: Q3 2025 Mounjaro global revenue 6515000000. Also repeats company-level revenue and guidance. Opinions: analyst quotes about “dispelling concerns” (named, but not directly quantitative for Q1 2026).
- FiercePharma (article summarizing Q3 2025; date in provided context): Medium-high quality (trade press). Fact: Q3 2025 Mounjaro 6.5B; combined tirzepatide 10.1B; some sequential commentary (e.g., Zepbound sequential growth). Opinions: “muted” growth interpretation.

Contextual but not directly resolving
- FiercePharma (2024-12-30 supply/shortage article): Medium quality. Facts: shortage removal in Oct 2024; manufacturing investments. Useful for mechanism (supply no longer the binding constraint), but dated for Q1 2026.
- CNBC (2025-03-24 orforglipron article): High quality journalism but mostly about a different asset. Facts: management optimism, timelines; not directly Mounjaro sales.
- AskNews items (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02): Mixed quality; mostly business press. Facts: Lilly expanding manufacturing footprint; reiteration that Mounjaro+Zepbound was about 10B in Q3 2025. These are demand-affirming, but do not pin down Q1 2026 Mounjaro net sales.
- Invezz / other market commentary in feed: Lower weight for numeric forecasting; often blends facts with promotional framing and long-horizon market projections.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (large shifts)
- Q3 2025 Mounjaro global revenue at ~6515000000 across multiple independent summaries (DrugDiscoveryTrends, FiercePharma, Yahoo/Benzinga-style recaps). This is the best recent hard anchor and establishes a high run-rate entering late 2025. Mechanism: realized demand + improved supply capacity.
- Documented multi-quarter acceleration from 2024 to 2025 (from the provided outside-view ledger) culminating in Q3 2025’s 6.5B. Historical pattern with predictive power: once supply constraints ease, GLP-1 class volumes tend to keep compounding until payer/friction becomes dominant.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- Supply normalization and ongoing manufacturing investment (FiercePharma supply article; Feb 2026 plant announcement). Mechanism: supports continued volume growth, but new plants often don’t affect the immediate quarter; more “keeps the runway open” than “adds Q1 units.”
- Competitive/pricing pressure narrative (various articles noting lower realized prices; payer dynamics like formulary actions). Mechanism: net sales can underperform script growth if gross-to-net worsens.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- Broad “GLP-1 bubble” and long-term TAM projections; competitor pipeline chatter. These can matter, but typically not decisive for one specific quarter’s reported net sales without a clear Q1 2026 event (policy shock, recall, abrupt price cut).

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-02. The quarter of interest (Q1 2026) ends 2026-03-31; resolution when Lilly reports (by ~2026-05-02).
- Time left: ~3 months to resolution; ~2 months of selling time left in-quarter.
How my forecast would change if timeframe were halved/doubled:
- If this resolved sooner (e.g., “Q4 2025”), I’d be tighter because we’d be closer to known reported numbers and channel checks. For Q1 2026, we still face uncertainty about Q4 2025’s level and any early-2026 price/coverage changes.
- If it resolved for a later quarter (e.g., Q3 2026), I’d widen the upper tail more because capacity expansions and new indications/access changes would have more time to compound.

5) (d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view

Outside-view base distribution (from prompt)
- P10 6300000000; P20 6800000000; P40 7400000000; P60 7900000000; P80 8500000000; P90 9200000000.

Key inside-view considerations vs that baseline
- Momentum anchor: Q3 2025 is already 6515000000. Two quarters later (Q1 2026), it’s hard to justify a median below ~7.5B unless there is either (i) a large net price compression, (ii) a meaningful payer/coverage shock specific to Mounjaro, or (iii) large channel/inventory unwind.
- Seasonality: Q1 can be softer than Q4 in many pharma products due to year-end stocking and gross-to-net timing. That argues against assuming a straight-line QoQ growth from an (unknown) Q4 2025 peak. This pushes down the upper central tendency a bit.
- Mix/cannibalization: Some obesity demand is routed to Zepbound rather than Mounjaro; that can cap Mounjaro’s upside even if total tirzepatide demand grows. This mainly trims the right tail.
- Net effect: modest upward shift in the median relative to the provided outside-view (because the trend strength and supply normalization look durable), but also a wider uncertainty band because we do not have Q4 2025 reported Mounjaro net sales in the provided evidence.

Probability calibration

I’m centering Q1 2026 Mounjaro global net sales around ~8000000000 to ~8500000000, with substantial uncertainty driven by (a) unknown Q4 2025 base, (b) realized price/gross-to-net volatility, and (c) channel inventory effects. I widen tails more than the outside-view distribution to reflect these “accounting/reporting” uncertainties (not just demand).

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Lilly-reported Q1 2026 Mounjaro global net sales, in $, for quarter ending 2026-03-31.
2. Outside view base rate used: the provided outside-view percentiles (P10 6.3B to P90 9.2B).
3. Consistency check: implied median ~7950000000 to ~8300000000; mean ~8400000000; plausible vs Q3 2025 6515000000 and continued growth with some Q1 seasonality.
4. Key evidence (most important):
   - Q3 2025 Mounjaro global revenue ~6515000000 (multi-source repetition).
   - Documented rapid 2024-2025 growth and supply normalization narrative.
   - Pricing pressure/gross-to-net headwinds mentioned alongside volume strength.
   - Manufacturing expansion signals demand durability but limited immediate-quarter impact.
5. Blind spot: a sharp, unexpected gross-to-net deterioration or channel destocking in Q1 2026 would push reported net sales materially down.
