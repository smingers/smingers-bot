Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, and how much to trust it)

1) **Yahoo Finance / Zacks (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **Factual extract used:** Q3 2025 **global Mounjaro sales = 6.52 billion**; U.S. 3.55 billion; international 2.97 billion.  
- **Quality:** Medium. It’s a secondary write-up, but the numbers appear to be lifted from Lilly’s earnings materials. There’s an obvious typo risk (the “$355 billion” line), so I treat narrative commentary as low-value and use only the headline product sales figures (cross-validated by other sources).

2) **CNBC (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **Factual extract used:** Confirms **Q3 2025 Mounjaro revenue = 6.52 billion**; provides context (international demand/launches) and mentions pricing pressure.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high as a secondary source (reputable outlet; still not the primary filing). Better than Zacks for qualitative context; still I weight the numeric figure mainly because it aligns with other reports.

3) **BioPharma Dive (Oct 30, 2025)**  
- **Factual extract used:** Confirms tirzepatide strength and that combined Zepbound+Mounjaro was huge in Q3 2025; narrative about “world’s best-selling drug” etc.  
- **Quality:** Medium. Good industry reporting, but not primary. Useful for “direction of travel,” not for precise quarterly modeling.

4) **24/7 Wall St (Aug 6, 2025)**  
- **Factual extract used:** Mentions **Q1 2025 Mounjaro revenue = 3.8 billion** (matches the agent ledger’s 3.84b).  
- **Quality:** Medium-low. It’s commentary-heavy. I only use it as corroboration for Q1 2025 magnitude, not as a forecast anchor.

5) **BioPharma Dive on Novo/Wegovy (Nov 2024)**  
- **Factual extract used:** General market context and adherence stats; not directly about Mounjaro revenue.  
- **Quality:** Medium for context; limited direct forecasting value for the specific metric.

6) **Drug Discovery & Development (Apr 4, 2024)**  
- **Factual extract used:** Historical datapoints (e.g., Q4 2023 Mounjaro 2.2b; FY2023 5.16b) and long-range projections (e.g., GlobalData).  
- **Quality:** Mixed. Historical numbers likely trace to filings; long-range projections are speculative. I treat projections as *weak* signals and mostly ignore them for a near-term quarterly forecast.

7) **Agent report (compiled quarterly sales + capacity commentary)**  
- **Factual extract used:** A quarter-by-quarter **Mounjaro global net sales ledger** through **Q3 2025 = 6.52b**, including:  
  - Q1 2024 1.81b  
  - Q4 2024 3.53b  
  - Q1 2025 3.84b  
  - Q2 2025 5.20b  
  - Q3 2025 6.52b  
  plus qualitative capacity notes (ramps through 2026; Lebanon IN production near end of 2026).  
- **Quality:** Medium. It is a synthesis and admits gaps (notably Q3 2024 and Q4 2025). It’s useful as a structured time series, but because it’s second-hand and partially incomplete, I use it as *a guide* rather than a definitive audited table.

### (b) Reference class analysis

**Candidate reference classes**
1) **Mounjaro’s own quarterly global net sales trajectory (2023–2025)**  
- Strength: Same product, same reporting convention, captures real-world supply/pricing/launch effects.  
- Weakness: Growth regime is still “launch/expansion” phase; extrapolation is fragile and sensitive to supply and international rollout.

2) **Other GLP-1 blockbusters (e.g., Ozempic/Wegovy) quarterly ramps**  
- Strength: Similar demand dynamics and payer/pricing pressure patterns.  
- Weakness: Different manufacturer capacity constraints, different launch timing, and different indication split; also we don’t have a clean quarterly dataset here.

3) **“Mega-blockbuster” pharma products broadly (Keytruda/Humira-style scaling)**  
- Too broad; doesn’t capture GLP-1-specific supply constraints and elasticity.

**Most suitable:** **(1) Mounjaro’s own quarter-by-quarter global net sales**, with light qualitative adjustment for (i) international expansion and (ii) pricing pressure/supply ramp.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-02  
- **Target quarter:** Q1 2026 (ends 2026-03-31)  
- **Resolution date:** by first official release/10-Q for quarter, ~early May 2026.  
- **Time left until quarter ends:** ~2 months.  
- **Time left until resolution:** ~3 months.

**Relevant historical patterns over similar horizons**
- Recent quarterly growth has been very strong, but **growth rates appear to be decelerating** as the base gets large:
  - Q1 2025 → Q2 2025: 3.84b → 5.20b (**+35% QoQ**)  
  - Q2 2025 → Q3 2025: 5.20b → 6.52b (**+25% QoQ**)
- Some evidence of **seasonality/quarter effects** exists in pharma, but Mounjaro’s trajectory is dominated by supply and market expansion, so classic seasonality is a weaker anchor than for mature products.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Baseline extrapolation from the time series**
- If growth decelerates further (a common “S-curve” pattern), a plausible path is:
  - Q3 2025: 6.52b  
  - Q4 2025: modest step up (unknown; likely higher than Q3 given momentum, but not guaranteed)  
  - Q1 2026: continued growth but with meaningful pricing pressure and an increasingly large base.

A simple decelerating-growth heuristic: apply another step-down in QoQ growth from 25% (Q2→Q3) to, say, **~10–18%** for subsequent quarters during a supply-limited but expanding phase.
- 6.52b × 1.10 = **7.17b**
- 6.52b × 1.18 = **7.69b**

That yields a **central outside-view band ~7.2b–7.7b** for a “typical” next-quarter scale-up from the last known point (Q3 2025), acknowledging we don’t yet have Q4 2025.

**Forces pushing Q1 2026 higher**
- International launch tailwinds cited by management (China/Brazil/India launches earlier in 2025) should be more fully annualized by 2026.
- Persistent strong demand and share gains described in Q3 2025 reporting.

**Forces pushing Q1 2026 lower**
- Lower realized prices already noted (pricing/discounting/cash-pay strategies can lift volume but compress net sales per unit).
- Supply/capacity ramp uncertainty (still a key risk in incretins).
- Competitive and adherence realities in GLP-1s can slow net growth at high scale.

**Outside-view conclusion:** I center the distribution in the **mid-to-high 7 billions**, with a wide interval to accommodate unknown Q4 2025 and possible supply/pricing surprises.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I aim for a **wide 10th–90th interval** because (i) this product is still in hyper-growth with supply/pricing uncertainty, and (ii) we are missing the immediate prior quarter’s disclosed figure (Q4 2025) at forecasting time, which increases volatility in extrapolation.
- Domain upset rate: for fast-growing pharma products, quarter-to-quarter revenue can meaningfully surprise (pricing, channel inventory, supply releases). I therefore avoid a tight distribution.
- I am implicitly tethering to the recent observed scale: **Q3 2025 = 6.52b** and **Q1 2025 = 3.84b** (so Q1 2026 being, say, 4.5b would require a sharp slowdown; Q1 2026 being 11b would require re-acceleration and/or major supply step-change).
