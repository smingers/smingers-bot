Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, key facts only)

1. Lilly Q4-24 press release (PR Newswire, Feb 2025).  
   – Factual: Mounjaro global sales 3530000000 in Q4-24.  
   – High quality (company disclosure).  Opinion content ignored.

2. Fierce Pharma Q2-24 recap (Aug 2024).  
   – Factual: Q2-24 Mounjaro 3090000000; supply-expansion timetable.  
   – Medium-high quality (numbers reproduced from filing).

3. Multiple Oct 30 2025 earnings articles (Fierce Pharma, Yahoo Finance, CNBC).  
   – All quote Lilly’s Q3-25 6520000000 global Mounjaro sales, plus comment on price pressure and capacity.  
   – High agreement → strong evidence.  Qualitative views treated as moderate evidence unless attributed to named analysts.

4. Drug Discovery & Development (Nov 2025) and UDN (Dec 2025).  
   – Repeat Q3-25 data; add context on dual-agonist edge, global roll-out.  
   – Moderate evidence for demand momentum.

5. Asknews Feb 2 2026 market-watch pieces.  
   – Forward-looking: “earnings on Wednesday will show tirzepatide still leading”.  No numbers → weak evidence.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:  
• Three independent sources quoting Lilly filings – Q3-25 revenue 6520000000.  
• Structural: manufacturing additions (FDA shortage list cleared Oct 2024; Lebanon IN, Puerto Rico, Netherlands builds) – capacity rising and hard to reverse.

Moderate:  
• Analyst commentary on continued international uptake and CVS formulary headwinds (affects Zepbound more than Mounjaro).  
• Observed sequential slowdown in QoQ growth (35 % in Q2→Q3-25, after 25 % in Q3→Q4-25 estimated) – extrapolatable but uncertain.

Weak:  
• “GLP-1 bubble” talk, competitive threats (retatrutide, Roche, Pfizer) – long-term, unlikely to hit Q1-26.  
• Macro pricing politics – possible but no concrete Q1-timed action.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Quarter ends in 58 days; first 10-Q due ~90 days from today.  
• If we had only half the time left, scrip/IMS data leaks would likely narrow the 80–20 band by ~25 %.  Doubling the horizon would widen it by similar amount.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base: extrapolate very recent trajectory.

Known quarterly global Mounjaro revenues (billions USD):  
Q1-24 1.81 → Q2-24 3.09 → Q3-24 3.11 → Q4-24 3.53 → Q1-25 3.84 → Q2-25 5.20 → Q3-25 6.52.

Pattern: supply-driven step-ups with decelerating growth (%QoQ 70 → 0 → 13 → 9 → 35 → 25).  
Assume Q4-25 (to be reported this week) is ~15 % above Q3-25 ⇒ ~7.50 b (central guess).  
Key drivers into Q1-26:

Upside drivers  
• First full quarter with new RTP and Kinsale lines fully validated – capacity +10–15 %.  
• Ongoing launches/label expansion outside US (India, Brazil, EU cardio indication).  
Downside drivers  
• Net price erosion (higher coupons, Lilly Direct).  Assume ~-8 % net ASP YoY.  
• Channel inventory usually falls in Q1 after year-end stocking.

Net effect: volumes +18 % QoQ, ASP –5 %, channel draw-down –3 % → revenue +8–12 % vs Q4-25.

Applying 10 % to the 7.50 b midpoint yields 8.25 b.  
Add uncertainty: supply glitches or insurer switches could knock 1 b off; breakthrough ramp (e.g., surprise Medicare coverage) could add 2 b.  This shapes a wide but centred distribution.

Probability calibration

Implied median 8000000000, mean ≈ 8100000000 (right-tailed).  Matches justification: modest growth on an already huge base with capacity still the main constraint.

Checklist:
1. Target: Global net sales of Mounjaro, Q1 2026, USD, per first Lilly filing.  
2. Outside-view base median before news: 7600000000.  
3. Consistency: median 8000000000; mean 8100000000; plausible continuation of trend.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Q3-25 sales 6520000000 (strong).  
   – Manufacturing expansions online 2025-26 (strong).  
   – Price erosion signals in Q3-25 commentary (moderate).  
   – CVS formulary headwind isolated to Zepbound (moderate-positive for Mounjaro).  
5. Blind-spot: major production disruption (e.g., quality hold) would drop revenue below 6000000000.
