Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance (30 Oct 2025) – secondary summary of Eli Lilly Q3-25 earnings. Factual figures (Mounjaro = 6.52 bn $) come straight from Lilly’s press release; opinion is limited to Zacks commentary (“taking market share”). Good factual quality, dated three months after Q3 close.  
2. CNBC (30 Oct 2025) – same earnings, adds management quotes from CEO Dave Ricks. Primary numbers reliable; qualitative remarks (“leading the U.S. market”) are CEO self-assessment.  
3. BioPharma Dive (30 Oct 2025) – repeats Q3-25 data and places tirzepatide in market context. Factual portions reliable; analyst-opinion sections (“booming”, “world’s best-selling drug”) ignored for quant work.  
4. 24/7 Wall St. (06 Aug 2025) – pulls Q1-25 Mounjaro figure (3.8 bn $) from Lilly Q1-25 release; author opinion on “only GLP-1 stock to buy” discarded.  
5. Drug Discovery & Development (04 Apr 2024) – historic Q4-23, full-year 23 numbers and long-run projections. Useful only for early ramp context.  
6. Agent_report – manually collected quarterly sales through Q3 25, with citations to Lilly 10-Qs/earnings. High quality because it traces to primary SEC documents, but two quarters are still placeholders (Q3 24, Q4 25).

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Mounjaro own quarterly sales curve, launch-to-date” (11 actual datapoints).  
2. “Blockbuster GLP-1 analogues (Ozempic, Wegovy) during comparable post-launch window.”  
3. “All Lilly metabolic blockbusters (Trulicity) five years after launch.”  
Class 1 is closest – same product, same supply constraints, no cross-company pricing noise. We therefore extrapolate from Mounjaro’s quarter-over-quarter growth trajectory.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → period end: 58 days (quarter finishes 31 Mar 2026).  
• Report publication expected early May 2026 (≈ 90 days).  
Quarter-to-quarter growth rates since the step-up in supply mid-24:  
Q1→Q2 25 +35 %, Q2→Q3 25 +25 %, (est.) Q3→Q4 25 ≈ +17 %. The curve is still rising but decelerating as capacity, not demand, is the binding constraint.

Typical Lilly seasonality: U.S. drug revenue often dips in Q1 (deductible resets, channel inventory unwind). Diabetes franchise historically posts ~5-10 % sequential decline in Trulicity. 2025 showed no dip because incremental capacity masked seasonality, but with capacity growth moderating, a flat or modestly higher Q1 26 looks plausible.

(d) Justification for outside-view point estimate  
Base rate: Take the run-rate exiting 2025. We model Q4 25 at 7.6 bn $ (Q3 25 6.52 bn ×1.17, which matches the recent deceleration).  

Adjustments:  
+ New Concord NC line continues to ramp through Q1 26 (+5–10 % supply).  
– Seasonality drag in U.S. reimbursement (-5 %).  
≈ Flat FX (USD has been range-bound since mid-25), modest price erosion (-2 %).  

Net sequential change: roughly +8 % (middle of +5 to +10).  
7.6 bn ×1.08 = 8.2 bn $ central but we haircut 1 bn $ to reflect uncertainty about exactly how much tirzepatide volume management allocates to Zepbound vs Mounjaro (diabetes vs obesity).  

Central forecast therefore ≈ 7.2 bn $.

Outside view calibration:

Distribution anchoring – normalish but truncated at zero and with fat tail on the high side (positive shocks if supply surprises). Historical quarter-to-quarter volatility (2024-25) had σ ≈ 1 bn $. We widen to 1.3 bn $ to reflect allocation risk and policy shocks. A 90-% interval at ±1.3 σ around the mean gives ≈ ±2.1 bn $. We skew slightly right (higher tail) because Lilly has repeatedly surprised to the upside when new capacity came online.
