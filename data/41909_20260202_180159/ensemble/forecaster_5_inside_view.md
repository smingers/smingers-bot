Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological order, key factual nuggets only)

a. Eli Lilly press release & SEC 10-Q for Q2 2024 (Aug 8 2024, Fierce Pharma recap).  
   • Mounjaro revenue 3090 million.  
   • All doses listed “available” – first sign supply restraints easing.  
   • Source = company filing ⇒ high reliability.  Opinions from journalists are ignored.

b. Eli Lilly press release & 10-Q for Q3 2024 (Oct 2024, earnings-call transcript).  
   • Mounjaro 3100 million; Zepbound 1200 million.  
   • Supply still tight; management “selling everything we can make”.  
   • High quality; forward-looking colour treated as management opinion.

c. 24/7 Wall St. article (Aug 6 2025) citing Q1 2025 3800 million figure.  
   • Number matches Lilly 10-Q ⇒ reliable; journalist commentary ignored.

d. Lilly press release & 10-Q for Q3 2025 (Oct 30 2025, Drug Discovery / Fierce Pharma / Yahoo recaps).  
   • Mounjaro 6520 million, YoY +109 %.  
   • Global supply no longer on FDA shortage list.  
   • Multiple independent sources confirm same numbers ⇒ very strong evidence.

e. Corporate guidance (Oct 30 2025) – FY 2025 sales range raised to 63000-63500 million.  Management states Lebanon, Indiana API plant will not add capacity until “late 2026”.  
   • Guidance is opinion but from issuer ⇒ moderate weight.

f. Misc. Feb 2 2026 news wires (Investing.com “Five things to watch”)  
   • States Q4 2025 results due this week.  No hard numbers.  Merely sets context ⇒ weak.

2. Evidence analysis (against resolution variable “global Mounjaro net sales Q1 2026”)

Strong evidence  
• Hard sales data for the last five quarters (Q1-Q3 2025, Q3-Q4 2024) show an accelerating but decelerating growth curve:  
  3090 → 3100 → 3800 → ~5300* → 6520 million (*Q2 2025 back-calculated from combined tirzepatide figure).  
• Institutional factor: supply no longer FDA-listed shortage, but 2026 capacity additions not yet on-line – caps upside.

Moderate evidence  
• Management commentary that “everything we can make, we sell” and that rebate resets produce a typical Q1 gross-to-net drag of roughly 10 % on U.S. incretin revenue.  
• New country launches (China, Brazil, S. Africa) and continuing volume growth internationally partially offset seasonality.

Weak evidence  
• Sell-side speculation about Medicare pricing negotiations or surprise fast-track capacity gains in NC site – improbable inside 90 days.

Overall weight: strong → recent numerical trend; moderate → seasonality & launches; weak → policy speculation.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to quarter-end: 58.  Days to first earnings release: ~90.  
Halving the horizon (forecast Q4 2025) would cut uncertainty materially because capacity already produced; doubling (forecast Q2 2026) would increase uncertainty (new plants, orforglipron cannibalisation).

4. Outside-view baseline & inside-view adjustments

Step A – project Q4 2025:  
Last sequential growth rates: +35 % (Q1→Q2), +23 % (Q2→Q3).  Extrapolate decay ⇒ +15 % gives 7500 million.

Step B – apply typical Lilly Q1 seasonality: average −10 % vs Q4 due to rebate reset.  7500 × 0.90 = 6750 million.

Step C – add incremental volume momentum (new geographies, reduced shortage warnings): +8 % volume lift.  6750 × 1.08 ≈ 7290 million.

Step D – symmetric risk envelope  
Downside: supply hiccup or larger rebate drag (-20 %).  Upside: stronger Q4 surprise plus minimal seasonality (+25 %).  90 % interval roughly 5800-9100 million.

Probability calibration
Implied median 7400 million, mean 7500 million – consistent with justification that distribution is slightly right-skewed (capacity the binding limit).

Checklist:
1. Target variable: “Global net sales of Mounjaro in Eli Lilly Q1 2026 earnings materials, USD.”  
2. Base-rate median 7300 million.  
3. Consistency check: median 7400, mean 7500 – matches narrative of capped upside.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Q3 2025 actual 6520 million (strong).  
   • Sequential growth slowdown 35 %→23 % (strong).  
   • Q1 rebate seasonality -10 % (moderate).  
   • No new capacity until late 2026 (strong structural).  
5. Blind-spot: a sudden FDA label expansion (e.g., CV indication) ignites demand and Lilly diverts extra bulk drug from Zepbound to Mounjaro, pushing revenue above 10000 million.
