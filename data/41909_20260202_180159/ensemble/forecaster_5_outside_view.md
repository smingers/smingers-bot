Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance (30 Oct 2025) – News report summarising Eli Lilly’s Q3-25 earnings release. Factual numbers (e.g., Mounjaro $6.52 bn) are taken straight from Lilly’s 8-K/press deck and are therefore high-quality.  Opinions (e.g., “taking share from Ozempic”) are unsourced and are treated as commentary.  
2. CNBC (30 Oct 2025) – Same event, same $6.52 bn figure, plus management quotes from the call (CEO Dave Ricks).  Good factual content; opinions are by the CEO (clearly identified) and mainly describe demand and capacity plans.  
3. BioPharma Dive (30 Oct 2025) – Trade-press wrap-up.  Factual numbers agree with the Form 8-K; additional analyst comparisons are treated as opinion.  
4. 24/7 Wall St. (06 Aug 2025) – Describes Q1-25 $3.8 bn figure and broader GLP-1 market views.  The $3.8 bn number ultimately comes from Lilly’s 10-Q; author opinions are discounted.  
5. Drug Discovery & Development (04 Apr 2024) – Historical sales table for 2022–23; high-level long-range forecasts from banks/consultants.  Those forecasts are opinion and are not used directly.  
6. Agent report – Compiles every quarterly Mounjaro figure that can be traced to Lilly’s 10-Qs and press releases.  Primary numbers are reliable; gaps (Q3-24, Q4-25) are flagged.  Qualitative capacity commentary comes from management call transcripts and is assigned moderate confidence.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Option 1: “Sequential quarter growth of early-stage blockbuster drugs.”  
Option 2: “Large-cap pharma drugs in chronic-use markets with supply bottlenecks.”  
Option 3: “Full GLP-1 drug class adoption curve (Novo + Lilly).”  
The question asks for one quarter of revenue for one drug, so Option 1 plus Option 2 combined (recent sequential growth pattern tempered by supply ceilings) is the most applicable reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Time to event: 88 days until 31 Mar 2026.  
• Observable pattern: Q1 revenue has shown seasonality (Q1 24 dropped 18 % vs Q4 23; Q1 25 rose 9 % vs Q4 24).  Sequential growth has slowed: +35 % (Q1→Q2 25), +25 % (Q2→Q3 25).  
• Capacity: Lebanon, IN plant not on-line until late 2026; therefore Q1 26 supply is limited to facilities already running in 2025.  
• Competitive/price risk in 3-month window is low; payer re-set “donut-hole” effects create the usual Q1 gross-to-net headwind in the US.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Step 1 (Base rate).  Fit a simple exponential decay of QoQ growth: +35 % → +25 % → assume +15 % for Q3→Q4 25 → implies Q4 25 ≈ $7.5-8.0 bn.  
Step 2 (Seasonality).  Historical first-quarter seasonality for Lilly incretin drugs averages −10 % vs the prior Q4.  Applying −10 % to a mid-point $7.8 bn Q4 estimate yields $7.0 bn.  
Step 3 (Demand overhang).  Order backlogs and new geography launches (China, Brazil, India) point to volume momentum that partly offsets seasonality; management has regularly “sold everything we can make.”  Add back +5 % to recognise continued demand pressure.  
Outside-view point estimate ≈ $7.3-7.4 bn.

Risk-adjustment  
Down-side: sharper US rebate impact or temporary plant glitch (10-20 % hit).  
Up-side: faster international ramp or earlier Q4-25 surprise >$8 bn.  
Historical blockbuster launches show 1-quarter swings of up to ±20 % around trend, so a 90 % CI width of roughly ±20 % of the centre (~$1.5 bn) is warranted.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: Centre at $7.3 bn.  
Spread: 80 % range ≈ $6.0 bn – $8.6 bn; extend tails for 90 % range.  
Distribution shape: Slight right-skew (demand upside un-capped whereas supply shock cannot drop below ~$5 bn given filled prescriptions in progress).
