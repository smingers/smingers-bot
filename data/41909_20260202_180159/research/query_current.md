Analysis:
To forecast Eli Lilly’s Q1-2026 global Mounjaro revenue I first need:
• The most recent actual sales numbers (Q4-2025, FY-2025) to establish a run-rate.  
• Management/analyst commentary since the January 30 2026 earnings call on 2026 demand, production-capacity expansions (NC, Indiana plants), and continuing supply constraints.  
• Sell-side and industry forecasts made in the last few days that incorporate that guidance.  
Searches will therefore target the latest earnings release, detailed news coverage of supply ramp-ups, and fresh analyst notes projecting 2026 quarterly sales.
