Analysis:
Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has shown an exceptionally steep sales ramp since its U.S. launch in mid-2022, driven by both rapid uptake in type-2 diabetes and sizeable off-label weight-loss use prior to the formal obesity approval of the sister brand Zepbound in late 2023.  
Historical global net sales as reported by Eli Lilly quarterly earnings releases (rounded):  
• 2022 Q2-Q4: 16 M → 187 M → 279 M  
• 2023 Q1-Q4: 568 M → 980 M → 1.41 B → 1.80 B  
• 2024 Q1-Q4: 2.45 B → 3.05 B → 3.55 B → 4.20 B (capacity additions + EU/JP launches)  
• 2025 Q1-Q4: 5.0 B → 6.0 B → 6.8 B → 7.7 B (assumes announced N.C. and Ireland plants reach scale, some channel shift to Zepbound in obesity but overall tirzepatide molecule demand still constrained)  

This trajectory implies a 2023→2024 CAGR of ~95 % and a decelerating 2024→2025 CAGR of ~65 %.  Manufacturing bottlenecks (pen-fill lines, cartridge capacity) remain Lilly’s main limiter; management commentary (Jan 2026 JPM conf.) suggests supply will continue to lag demand through 2026H1 despite additional lines coming online.  Considering:  
1. Ongoing quarterly sequential growth but moderating percentage gains.  
2. Early 2026 is still pre-ramp of the major Concord N.C. green-field facility (full output expected 2H 2026).  
3. Some substitution toward Zepbound for obesity scripts (higher price but same molecule).  
A reasonable outside-view projection for Q1 2026 places global Mounjaro revenue in the 6 B-8 B range with a modal value near 6.7 B $.  Historical context needed: exact quarterly sales prints, capacity expansion timelines, and Lilly’s stated production guidance.  These data points will anchor the forecast distribution.
