UBS Confirms Neutral Rating**\nThe Novo Nordisk stock is trading in the red ahead of its February 4, 2026, financial report, amid heightened market anticipation and concerns over increasing price pressure and rising competition from Eli Lilly. Analysts refer to the week as a 'decision week' that could determine the stock's future trajectory. Projections indicate a fourth-quarter revenue of approximately 77 billion Danish Kronen (DKK), down from 85.7 billion DKK in the same period of the previous year, with earnings per share expected to decline to about 5.9 DKK from 6.34 DKK in 2025. The stock has lost around 8.44% in the past week, dropping to 367.00 DKK on the NASDAQ-Nordic exchange. UBS has maintained its 'Neutral' rating and a price target of 390 DKK, citing that Novo Nordisk's CagriSema did not achieve statistically significant superiority over Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro in a comparative study\u2014requiring approximately a 2.5 percentage point greater weight loss to be considered significant, according to analyst Matthew Weston.

The company has shown strong momentum, with 68% revenue growth in Q3 and an upgraded full-year outlook. It secured contracts with a French insurance firm and three of the top 10 global financial institutions, signaling growing adoption. The software is already deployed in restaurant drive-thrus and vehicle digital assistants, with the critical test being its performance in customer-service call centers\u2014where consumer acceptance of AI agents remains uncertain. Despite strong revenue growth, SoundHound AI continues to operate at a significant loss, spending about twice as much as it earns in revenue, which raises concerns about long-term sustainability. Wall Street analysts project 37% revenue growth for 2026, and the stock is currently trading at 27 times sales\u2014its cheapest level in over a year. However, the company's success hinges on both market adoption and improving its operating margin toward profitability. If SoundHound AI achieves strong revenue growth and margin improvement by 2026, the stock could deliver exceptional returns, but investor sentiment may falter if profitability remains elusive.

The January nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show a rise of 67,000 jobs, up from 50,000 in December, with the unemployment rate projected to remain stable at 4.4%. This data will influence expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate policy, with investors currently anticipating no rate changes until June, when a potential cut is expected. President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair adds uncertainty, given Warsh\u2019s known preference for aggressive rate cuts, contrasting with current Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s cautious stance. In corporate earnings, Alphabet is set to report on Wednesday, with investor focus on its AI progress, including the Gemini AI model and its deal with Apple to power Siri. Alphabet\u2019s stock rose 29% in Q4 2025, driven by AI momentum, with analysts suggesting it has overtaken Microsoft in the AI race. Amazon is also reporting after the bell on Thursday, supported by a $38 billion, seven-year deal with OpenAI for cloud services, which is expected to boost Amazon Web Services (AWS) capacity with hundreds of thousands of AI chips by 2027. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly\u2019s earnings on Wednesday will offer insight into the obesity drug market, where its tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) has surpassed Merck\u2019s Keytruda as the world\u2019s best-selling drug and overtaken Novo Nordisk in market leadership.

The company, a pure-play AI application firm, develops software that integrates generative AI with audio recognition, enabling human-AI interactions in applications such as restaurant drive-thrus and in-vehicle digital assistants. In Q3, SoundHound AI reported a 68% year-over-year revenue increase and raised its full-year outlook, signaling strong momentum. It secured contracts with a French insurance company and three of the top 10 global financial institutions, indicating growing enterprise adoption. Wall Street analysts project 37% revenue growth for 2026. However, the company remains unprofitable, with operating margins consistently spending about twice its revenue, raising concerns about sustainability. While the stock\u2019s current valuation at 27 times sales is more attractive than in the past, its future returns depend on whether it can achieve both strong revenue growth and a path toward profitability by 2026. The article concludes that SoundHound AI is a high-risk, high-reward investment, with the potential for supercharged returns if it successfully balances growth and margin improvement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:10 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/02/soundhound-ai-looks-primed-to-deliver-supercharged/)\n\n**The Shadow of the Obesity Drug Boom: Market Concentration Threatens Long-Term Drug Development Diversity**\nThe obesity treatment drug market has surged globally, with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk collectively generating estimated annual revenues of 30 to 50 trillion won in the past year. The market has become a global blockbuster, with major pharmaceutical companies and even domestic mid-sized biotech firms entering the field. GLP-1 receptor agonists like Mounjaro and Wegovy, originally developed for diabetes, are rapidly expanding into new indications such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease, creating a perception of being a 'panacea'. However, this trend has led to an excessive concentration of resources: company valuations are rising based solely on the 'obesity' label, with stock prices surging on mere announcements of potential global partnerships or generic drug development plans. This shift is evident in South Korea\u2019s clinical trial landscape, where obesity, metabolism, and diabetes-related trials have seen the steepest increase over the past three years. In contrast, rare disease therapies have significantly lost visibility\u2014domestic rare disease drug designations by the FDA dropped to 15 in 2024, down from a record 22 in 2024, marking the first decline in three years. While the current boom reflects rational market calculations, concerns remain about long-term sustainability: whether most companies can maintain competitiveness and whether the current trend threatens the diversity and resilience of the broader drug development ecosystem over the next 10 to 20 years.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:14 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/journalist/11950389)\n\n**Electronic Industry Weekly Report: U.S. Memory Stocks Beat Expectations, Global CSPs Continue Momentum**\nThe electronic industry index declined by -2.18% for the week of January 26\u201330, 2026, with consumer electronics dropping 4.74%, semiconductors falling 0.83%, and optical/electro-optics down 4.10%.

Earnings season has been strong so far, with 75% of companies reporting a positive earnings-per-share surprise and 65% a positive revenue surprise. By week's end, over half of the S&P 500 will have reported. The most anticipated economic report is the U.S. nonfarm payrolls for January, released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 75,000 new jobs, a stable unemployment rate of 4.4%, and a 0.3% monthly increase in average hourly earnings. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday and the ADP employment survey on Wednesday are considered less important. The manufacturing PMI is expected to remain in contraction, while the services PMI is likely to show continued expansion. Key earnings highlights include: Eaton Corp. is spinning off its Mobility Group, which investors view positively; Eli Lilly is under scrutiny for GLP-1 drug sales (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and the upcoming FDA approval of orforglipron; Alphabet is being watched for signs that AI investments are paying off, particularly in search and cloud; Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s commercial performance will be critical amid patent expirations; Linde\u2019s earnings will test the sustainability of its recent 17% rally; and Amazon\u2019s AWS performance will be closely analyzed, especially in the context of AI-driven cloud competition.

These include Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which saw its stock drop over 40% in 2025 due to competition from Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro, but rebounded after FDA approval of its first oral GLP-1 therapy, Wegovy. The stock recently broke above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for the first time in nearly 16 months, with strong MACD momentum signaling a shift in trend. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) faced a nearly 20% drop in one day due to Trump\u2019s Medicare rate freeze proposal, though analysts still project 2026 revenue exceeding $44 billion and EPS above $17.75. The stock had previously broken above its 200-day SMA and is now showing signs of recovery from oversold RSI conditions. Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) reported strong Q3 2026 results, surpassing analyst estimates and raising its annual revenue forecast to $540 million, despite ongoing tariff risks. The stock surged over 14% and is now trading above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs, supported by a low P/E ratio of 14 and a high Benzinga Edge quality score of 91.16. Comcast (NYSE:CMCSA), after a decade of underperformance, is benefiting from a strong broadband foundation and a 4.5% dividend yield with 19 consecutive dividend increases. The stock is approaching a 200-day SMA breakout, supported by positive MACD momentum. Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), which has declined nearly 30% from its IPO peak, is seeing a resurgence through technical and fundamental catalysts, including four analyst upgrades in January, expansion into international markets, a new 'Book Now, Pay Later' service, and the 2026 World Cup. The stock recently formed a golden cross with 50-day SMA acting as new support. All five stocks are positioned for potential recovery in 2026, with strong technical indicators and strategic improvements.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:46 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50285726/2026-5)\n\n**5 Stocks Primed for a Turnaround in 2026 - Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)**\nThe article highlights five stocks with potential for a turnaround in 2026, focusing on their poor performance in 2025 and strategic moves to regain investor confidence. Among them, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) received four analyst upgrades in January, including moves from Cantor Fitzgerald, Barclays, Wells Fargo, and B. Riley Securities. Catalysts cited include international expansion, the launch of its 'Reserve Now Pay Later' service, and the 2026 FIFA World Cup hosted in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The stock formed a Golden Cross, broke above the 50-day SMA, and is expected to report Q4 2025 earnings on February 12, 2026, with investors focusing on margin performance and 2026 guidance. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is showing signs of a breakout near the 200-day SMA, supported by bullish MACD momentum, and has a long history of paying quarterly dividends, though any breakout is viewed cautiously. Other stocks mentioned include Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which lost over 40% in 2025 due to competition from Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro and missed revenue estimates, but received a Buy rating and $73.50 price target from CICC Research on January 9, 2026. UnitedHealth Group Inc. remains on track for over $440 billion in 2026 revenue and EPS exceeding $17.75, with an oversold RSI and easing decline post-Q4 2025 earnings. Deckers Outdoor Corp. saw a 14% after-hours surge following its earnings report, now trading above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, with a strong balance sheet and a Benzinga Edge Quality score of 91.16. The article emphasizes that while all five stocks began 2026 with strong momentum, investors should assess their risk tolerance and time horizon before investing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 05:31 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/26/01/50274453/5-stocks-primed-for-a-turnaround-in-2026)\n\n**Moog: Revenues and Profit Beat Forecasts in Q1**\nMoog (NYSE: MOGa) reported first-quarter 2026 results that exceeded analyst expectations.

Global Mounjaro sales reached $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $728 million internationally. Zepbound U.S. sales surpassed $1.2 billion, with 87% commercial formulary access as of October 1, 2024. Prescription volume for both drugs grew 25% sequentially. New product revenue increased by over $3 billion. Gross margin rose to 82.2%, supported by favorable product mix and higher realized prices. Operating income reached nearly $1.8 billion, while EPS was $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023, despite a $3.08 per share negative impact from acquired IPR&D charges. R&D expenses increased 13%, primarily due to investments in early- and late-stage development, with $2.8 billion in IPR&D charges from the Morphic Therapeutics acquisition. The company updated its 2024 revenue guidance to $45.4 billion to $46 billion, with the midpoint implying nearly 50% Q4 growth. Expected EPS is $12.05 to $12.55 (reported) and $13.02 to $13.52 (non-GAAP), reflecting $3.1 billion in IPR&D charges. Mounjaro and Zepbound supply is on track to exceed a 50% increase in sellable doses in H2 2024 vs. H2 2023. Key pipeline milestones include: 94% reduction in Type-2 diabetes risk and 23% sustained weight loss in pre-diabetic adults on tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-1); modified dosing for donanemab reduced ARIA-E incidence to 14% (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6); insulin efsitora alfa met all five Phase 3 primary endpoints with 40% lower severe hypoglycemia vs. insulin glargine (QWINT-1); and positive EMBER-3 data for imlunestrant in breast cancer, with an NDA submission planned by year-end. The company announced a $2 billion investment in Ireland and a separate $4.5 billion for the Lilly Medicine Foundry in Indiana, bringing total manufacturing expansion commitments since 2020 to over $20 billion. Capital returns totaled $1.6 billion via dividends and share repurchases. Regulatory approvals were received for Ebglyss (atopic dermatitis) in the U.S., Kisunla (early Alzheimer\u2019s) in Japan and the U.K., and Omvoh gained first-line access at two of three major U.S. PBMs. Trulicity revenue declined 22% globally due to lower volume, partially offset by higher prices. U.S. channel inventory for Mounjaro and Zepbound decreased, reducing Q3 sales by a mid-single-digit percentage. Daniel Skovronsky stated, 'the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen,' supporting an upcoming supplemental FDA submission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 05:20 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/01/22/eli-lilly-lly-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=5b0adb3d-999b-46ff-8c3e-0bbc2c67f014)\n\n**Eli Lilly's Q3 2025 Report: Beyond Weight-Loss Hype\u2014The Rise of a Global Cardiometabolic Infrastructure Giant**\nEli Lilly and Company (LLY) reported exceptional financial results for the third quarter of 2025, with revenue reaching $17.6 billion, up from $11.439 billion in the same period of the previous year. Net profit surged to $5.58 billion, a fivefold increase from $970 million in the prior-year quarter, driving EPS from $1.08 to $6.22\u2014equivalent to the total EPS of the first three quarters of 2024 in a single quarter. While the market focuses on weight-loss drugs like Zepbound and Mounjaro (known as 'Mengjianle' in Taiwan), the core of Eli Lilly\u2019s business lies in treating Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and improving cardiovascular and metabolic health. Mounjaro was originally developed for diabetes management, with significant clinical benefits in lowering A1C levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing cardiovascular events\u2014weight loss being a secondary, beneficial effect. Real-world data confirms that Mounjaro\u2019s primary value is in chronic disease management, not cosmetic weight loss. The company\u2019s revenue structure reflects this: 75% of sales now come from cardiometabolic products. In the U.S., Mounjaro and Zepbound combined generated over $7 billion in revenue, with Zepbound growing nearly two-fold year-on-year to $3.568 billion. Internationally, revenue from non-U.S. markets rose from $728 million to $2.965 billion, with Europe doubling from $1.628 billion to $3.498 billion, and China and Japan each exceeding $500 million. The company is also advancing oral formulations like Orforglipron and expanding global manufacturing capacity to avoid supply bottlenecks. The strategic shift is clear: Eli Lilly is transitioning from a 'weight-loss drug company' to a 'global infrastructure provider for cardiometabolic care.' This transformation, marked by simultaneous improvements in revenue, product mix, and global expansion, signals a new era of sustainable, high-margin growth. Investors are reevaluating the company not for short-term hype, but for long-term, scalable, and globally synchronized demand.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7251/9178978)\n\n**Wall Street's New Favorite: Eli Lilly Becomes Healthcare's First $1 Trillion Company**\nEli Lilly became the first healthcare company in history to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion on Friday, marking a milestone in Wall Street's investment landscape. The company's stock rose 1.7%, solidifying its status as the latest mega-cap leader. With year-to-date gains exceeding 36%, Lilly has outperformed tech volatility, signaling a significant investor shift toward defensive, high-growth healthcare sectors, especially as mega-cap tech faces growing concerns over valuations and returns. Lilly's success is driven almost entirely by two blockbuster drugs: Mounjaro, used for type 2 diabetes, and Zepbound, a weight-loss injection. Together, they generated $10.1 billion in combined revenue during Q3 2025, accounting for over 57% of Lilly's total quarterly sales of $17.6 billion. Mounjaro's revenue nearly doubled to $6.52 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations of $5.51 billion, while Zepbound's revenue nearly tripled to $3.57 billion, exceeding estimates of $3.5 billion. Lilly now captures nearly 60% of all U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, compared to Novo Nordisk\u2019s 42%, reflecting both superior drug efficacy\u2014Mounjaro\u2019s dual-action mechanism outperforms Novo\u2019s single-target semaglutide\u2014and Lilly\u2019s aggressive direct-to-consumer strategy. Walmart\u2019s partnership to sell Zepbound vials at lower cash prices has particularly resonated with cost-sensitive patients. Wall Street forecasts explosive future growth: the global weight-loss drug market is projected to reach $150 billion by the early 2030s, with Truist Securities estimating Lilly\u2019s obesity portfolio\u2014including the upcoming oral drug orforglipron, launching early 2026\u2014could reach $101 billion in peak global revenue. A potential White House price agreement on GLP-1 drugs could unlock access for an additional 40 million Medicare patients, dramatically expanding the addressable market. Once considered niche, obesity treatment has become the most profitable healthcare category. Lilly\u2019s trillion-dollar valuation reflects a fundamental shift in investor sentiment, offering predictable, short-term revenue growth tied to a growing market\u2014something tech cannot consistently deliver. The company trades at approximately 51 times forward earnings, a premium justified by repeatable growth less vulnerable to semiconductor cycles or geopolitical shocks. CEO Dave Ricks is positioning Lilly as a long-term compounder, including a R&D partnership with Nvidia to launch a drug discovery supercomputer in January 2026, signaling intent to expand innovation pipelines beyond patent cliffs. Risks remain, including pricing pressure on Mounjaro and execution risks for orforglipron, but for now, Lilly has captured market imagination as the anti-tech mega-cap story\u2014a rare validation of healthcare in a tech-dominated era.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/sv/nyheter/2025/11/21/wall-streets-nya-favorit-eli-lilly-blir-sjukvardens-forsta-kraftpaket-pa-1-biljon-dollar/)\n\n**Global Bar Report 2025: Europe - The Spirits Business**\nThe 2025 Global Bar Report highlights that bars across Europe are adapting to shifting consumer behaviors, with a growing emphasis on tasting serves, luxury experiences, and intentional guest journeys. According to Anna Sebastian, founder of Anna Sebastian Hospitality, the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro has led to reduced alcohol consumption and smaller portion sizes in bars and restaurants, contributing to lighter drinking trends. Consumers are now prioritizing atmosphere, storytelling, and aesthetics over drink quality alone, with Alex Francis noting that platforms like Pinterest are influencing how people plan their nights out. Successful bars are investing in immersive experiences, including lighting, music, and curated journeys. Despite overall reduced spending on outings, five-star hotel bars are thriving: the European luxury hotel market reached US$30.36 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to US$46.36 billion by 2030 at an 8.84% compound annual growth rate. High-end hotel bars are attracting affluent travelers with star-studded talent and refined service. Notable new openings include Advocatuur in Amsterdam, a micro-distillery-meets-lounge concept, and The Spy Bar at Raffles London at The OWO, which enforces a no-camera policy and emphasizes slow, deliberate experiences. Bar de Vie in Paris leverages seasonal French ingredients for its tasting menu of small cocktails. The report underscores that bars relying solely on drink quality without immersive hospitality risk declining profits in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[thespiritsbusiness.com](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2025/11/global-bar-report-2025-europe/)\n\n**Massive sales for weight loss drugs spur Eli Lilly's Q3**\nEli Lilly reported record-breaking Q3 2025 results, with total revenue surging 54% year-over-year to $17.6 billion\u2014exceeding the Zacks consensus estimate of $16.01 billion by 9.91%. This growth was driven by strong demand for tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). Mounjaro generated $6.5 billion in Q3 2025, a 109% increase from the same quarter in 2024, while Zepbound sales rose 185% to $3.6 billion. Global demand for weight-loss drugs offset lower pricing, contributing to the robust performance. Lilly\u2019s shares closed at $844.50 on October 30, 2025, up 3.6% from the prior day, with a market capitalization of $757 billion. Tirzepatide\u2019s sales have surpassed MSD\u2019s Keytruda, signaling a potential shift in the global pharmaceutical market leadership. In response, Lilly raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $63\u201363.5 billion, up from $62 billion. The results were notable amid CVS Caremark\u2019s announcement to make Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy the preferred GLP-1RA treatment from July 2025. On the same day, Novo Nordisk entered a $9 billion bidding war for Metsera, a move Pfizer criticized as 'reckless'\u2014Pfizer had already agreed to acquire Metsera in September. Metsera is developing longer-acting GLP-1RAs, which Novo aims to integrate into its Ozempic and Wegovy brands. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly plans to submit its oral GLP-1RA candidate, orforglipron, to the FDA for obesity approval in 2025, with a type 2 diabetes application expected in 2026. GlobalData forecasts orforglipron could reach $11 billion in sales by 2031.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 12:03 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

(NYSE: LLY) reported third-quarter 2025 earnings that surpassed expectations, with revenue rising 54% year over year to $17.60 billion, exceeding the consensus of $16.02 billion. This growth was driven by a 62% increase in volume, partially offset by a 10% decline due to lower realized prices. Key Products revenue reached $11.98 billion, led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro\u2019s revenue surged 109% to $6.52 billion, with U.S. revenue at $3.55 billion (up 49%) and international revenue at $2.97 billion (up from $728.0 million in Q3 2024). Zepbound revenue rose 184% to $3.57 billion, driven by strong demand, partially offset by lower prices. Verzenio revenue increased 7% to $1.47 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were $7.02, up from $1.18 a year ago, beating the consensus of $5.70. Gross profit rose 57% to $14.59 billion, with a gross margin of 82.9%, an increase of 1.9 percentage points, due to favorable product mix, partially offset by lower prices. Eli Lilly raised its fiscal year 2025 sales guidance to $63 billion\u2013$63.5 billion (from $60 billion\u2013$62 billion) and adjusted earnings guidance to $23\u2013$23.70 (from $21.75\u2013$23.00), both above the consensus of $61.65 billion and $22.18, respectively. On October 29, 2025, the company announced a planned $1.2 billion investment to expand its Lilly del Caribe manufacturing site in Carolina, Puerto Rico, with construction set to begin in 2026 and production expected by the end of 2028. The new facility will produce oral solid medicines, including orforglipron, Lilly\u2019s first oral weight loss drug, and is expected to generate up to 1,000 construction jobs and 100 high-tech manufacturing roles.

The drug was previously approved in South Africa for Type 2 diabetes since December 2024. The approval comes amid a global obesity crisis, with over one billion people affected and projections suggesting over half the world\u2019s population could be obese by 2035. Despite this milestone, Aspen faced a 42% drop in earnings per share in the fiscal year ending June 2025, driven by operational challenges. However, the core commercial pharmaceuticals segment showed 5% growth (10% in local currency), and the company is expanding insulin production in South Africa to offset past losses. Analysts project a recovery starting in the second half of 2026, supported by cost-cutting measures and new revenue from the weight-loss market. The current stock price is 103.35 Rand, with an average target of 120.40 Rand\u2014representing over 15% upside. The key question remains whether Aspen can convert the Mounjaro breakthrough into sustainable growth, with upcoming quarterly results expected to signal the start of a turnaround.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 11:33 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Aspen_Aktie_Durchbruch_Milliardenmarkt-19117819)\n\n**Eli Lilly's Mounjaro becomes second-most sold drug in September, posts Rs 80 cr revenue: Report**\nEli Lilly's weight-loss drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide) became the second-most sold medicine in India by value in September 2024, according to a report by Business Standard published on October 8, 2025. The drug generated Rs 80 crore in revenue, a 42% increase from Rs 56 crore in August, as reported by Pharmarack. This surge was attributed to rising demand and a shift toward higher dosage forms. Mounjaro is available in two injectable formulations priced between Rs 14,000 and Rs 17,500 per month. Since its launch in March 2024, Mounjaro has cumulatively earned Rs 233 crore. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Augmentin led the market with Rs 85 crore in September revenue. On October 7, 2025, Eli Lilly announced a $1 billion investment over the next few years to expand manufacturing and supply in India through local contract manufacturers, as the company currently lacks its own production facility in the country.
