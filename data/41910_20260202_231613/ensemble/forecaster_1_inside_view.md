## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **December 2025 actual: 3.2%** (Multiple independent sources: TheGlobalEconomy, Xinhua, Neweralive confirm). This is the most recent data point, 3 months before target.

2. **Disinflationary trend through H2 2025:** June 3.66% → September 3.49% → December 3.19%/3.2%. Consistent momentum across multiple sources.

3. **BoN October 2025 official forecast: 2026 average 4.0%** (revised down from 4.2%). Direct from central bank with explicit rationale (stronger currency, lower oil). This is structural institutional guidance.

4. **Currency strength:** USD/NAD strengthened 14% y/y (from context summary). Direct causal mechanism for lower import inflation.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Simonis Storm forecast: 3.6-3.8% for 2026** (January 2026). Single credible local analyst with sectoral breakdown. Methodology appears sound (housing/utilities elevated, services firm, core anchored).

2. **Seasonal pattern:** March typically higher than December due to post-holiday demand, school reopening, pre-harvest lean season. Historical March 2025 (4.2%) vs December 2024 (3.4%) shows ~0.8pp seasonal lift, though December 2024 data unclear in sources.

3. **Housing/utilities acceleration:** 4.5% in December vs 4.4% prior. Suggests administered price pressures, but single-sector signal.

4. **Expected monetary easing:** Simonis Storm predicts two 25bp cuts in 2026. Lower rates could support demand-side inflation, but effect is typically lagged 6-12 months.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Food disinflation narrative:** Mentioned in context but December sources show "slower food price increases" without specific data. Directionally supportive but magnitude unclear.

2. **Global inflation easing:** IMF projects global trends, but Namibia's peg to rand and import structure make this indirect.

3. **April 2025 BoN forecast (4.5% for 2026):** Superseded by October revision; outdated.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 1 month (February 2 → March 2026 outcome, though data released ~April 8, 2026)

**If halved (0.5 months/mid-February):** Would predict closer to December 2025 actual (3.2%), as seasonal effects haven't fully materialized. Distribution would narrow around 3.1-3.4%.

**If doubled (2 months/April):** Would need to account for full Q1 seasonal cycle completion. Distribution would widen toward 3.5-4.3% as additional month allows more volatility and potential reversal of disinflationary trend.

**Key consideration:** March is early Q1, so only partial seasonal lift expected. Historical March 2025 (4.2%) vs December 2024 comparison would be ideal but December 2024 data not clearly stated in sources (Observer24 mentions 3.4% Dec 2024).

## (d) Justification for Distribution

**Base Rate Anchors:**

1. **December 2025 actual: 3.2%** - Most recent, but March typically higher
2. **BoN 2026 forecast: 4.0% average** - Full year, Q1 typically slightly above average
3. **Simonis Storm 2026 forecast: 3.6-3.8%** - More recent, more bearish than BoN
4. **March 2025 actual: 4.2%** - Year-ago seasonal comparator

**Factors Supporting Lower Outcome (below 3.5%):**

- Strong disinflationary momentum through H2 2025
- Currency strength (14% y/y) directly lowers import costs
- BoN's downward revisions (October: 4.2%→4.0%) show institutional confidence
- Simonis Storm's 3.6-3.8% range suggests even lower than BoN

**Factors Supporting Higher Outcome (above 4.0%):**

- Seasonal Q1 pattern: March 2025 was 1.0pp above December 2024 (if 3.4% Dec 2024 correct)
- Housing/utilities accelerating (4.5% in Dec)
- Mean reversion: 3.2% is near bottom of 3-6% target band
- BoN's 4.0% annual forecast implies some months above 4.0%

**Distribution Logic:**

**Lower tail (P1-P10):** 2.8-3.3%
- P1 (2.8%): Extreme scenario where disinflationary trend accelerates, no seasonal lift
- P10 (3.3%): Minimal seasonal effect, continued momentum from December

**Central range (P20-P80):** 3.5-4.1%
- P20 (3.5%): Below Simonis Storm lower bound, modest seasonal lift
- P40 (3.7%): Simonis Storm midpoint, slight seasonal effect
- P60 (3.9%): Approaching BoN forecast, moderate seasonal lift
- P80 (4.1%): Above BoN forecast, stronger seasonal pressures

**Upper tail (P90-P99):** 4.3-4.7%
- P90 (4.3%): Match to March 2025, full seasonal reversion
- P99 (4.7%): Unexpected shock (oil spike, rand weakness)

**Key shift from outside view:** The December 2025 actual (3.2%) came in **below** all expert forecasts from October (BoN: 4.0% avg) and January (Simonis Storm: 3.6-3.8%). This suggests forecasters were too hawkish, warranting downward adjustment. However, March's seasonal pattern prevents simply anchoring to 3.2%.

**Calibration:** Median ~3.8% reflects:
- 0.6pp seasonal lift from December (less than March 2025's ~0.8pp due to stronger disinflationary momentum)
- Alignment with Simonis Storm upper bound
- Below BoN's 4.0% average (Q1 typically slightly above average, but strong momentum offsets)

Probability calibration:

**Central tendency justification:** The 3.5-4.1% range (P20-P80) captures 60% probability, reflecting:
- High confidence in disinflationary momentum continuing
- Moderate uncertainty around seasonal magnitude
- Simonis Storm (3.6-3.8%) and BoN (4.0%) forecasts bracketing the range

**Tail calibration:**
- Lower tail (P1-P10): 2.8-3.3% allows for exceptional continuation of December trend. 10% probability appropriate given currency strength and momentum.
- Upper tail (P90-P99): 4.3-4.7% accounts for seasonal reversion or external shock. 10% probability conservative given stable macro environment but reasonable for unknown unknowns.

**90/10 range = 3.3% to 4.3% (1.0pp spread):** Narrower than initial outside view (3.2-4.5%) because:
- December 2025 data point provides strong anchor
- Expert forecasts converging (Simonis Storm 3.6-3.8%, BoN 4.0%)
- Short timeframe (1 month) limits volatility
- But still allows for seasonal uncertainty

**Skewness:** Slight right skew (median 3.8% closer to P20 3.5% than P80 4.1%) reflects:
- Stronger evidence for continued disinflation
- Asymmetric risk: seasonal pressures more predictable than shocks

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Namibia annual inflation rate (%) for March 2026 per TradingEconomics/NSA CPI bulletin.

2. **Base rate:** December 2025 actual 3.2%, BoN 2026 forecast 4.0%, Simonis Storm 3.6-3.8%, March 2025 actual 4.2%. Final prediction rooted in December actual + seasonal adjustment.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.8%; mean ≈ 3.8%. Aligns with Simonis Storm upper bound and below BoN forecast, consistent with stronger-than-expected disinflation through December.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - December 2025 actual 3.2% (strong, factual, multiple sources)
   - BoN October forecast 4.0% for 2026 (strong, institutional)
   - Simonis Storm January forecast 3.6-3.8% (moderate, credible analyst)
   - Seasonal March pattern ~0.6-0.8pp above December (moderate, historical)
   - Currency strength 14% y/y (strong, causal mechanism)

5. **Blind-spot:** Oil price spike (e.g., Middle East conflict escalation) could push March above 4.5% through transport/import costs. This would make forecast look too narrow/low. Alternatively, unexpected rand collapse (SA political crisis) could break peg dynamics and spike inflation.
