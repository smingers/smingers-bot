## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Namibia March inflation (previous years)**
   - March 2025: 4.2%
   - March 2024: 4.5%
   - Suitability: HIGH - Same country, same month, same seasonal patterns

2. **Namibia annual inflation trajectory 2025-2026**
   - Trend: Declining from 4.2% (March 2025) → 3.5% (Sept 2025) → 3.2% (Dec 2025)
   - Suitability: HIGH - Shows recent momentum and policy environment

3. **BoN target band performance (3-6%)**
   - Historical context: Inflation stayed within band throughout 2025
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Provides bounds but not precise point estimates

4. **Southern African peer countries (SACU members)**
   - Suitability: LOW - Namibia's currency peg to rand creates unique dynamics

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of (1) Namibia's March historical data and (2) recent 2025-2026 trajectory, weighted toward recent trend given strong disinflationary momentum.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 13 months from now (February 2, 2026 → March 2026 outcome)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- March 2024 → March 2025: Declined 0.3 pp (4.5% → 4.2%)
- March 2025 → December 2025: Declined 1.0 pp (4.2% → 3.2%)
- December 2025 → March 2026: Need to forecast ~3 months forward

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- March falls in Q1, typically showing slight uptick from December due to:
  - Post-holiday demand recovery
  - School reopening effects
  - Pre-harvest lean season for food
- Agent report notes "temporary firmness in Q1 as households rely on markets"
- However, 2026 benefits from better harvest expectations than 2025

**Recent Momentum:**
- Strong disinflationary trend through H2 2025
- December 2025 (3.2%) already below all 2026 forecasts, suggesting expected reversal

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Key Drivers Supporting Lower Inflation:**

1. **Fuel Price Cuts (February 2026):** The confirmed N$1.00/l petrol and N$0.50/l diesel cuts on Feb 4, 2026 represent a significant disinflationary shock. Agent report estimates ~0.15 pp reduction to 2026 average. This occurs just before March measurement.

2. **Exchange Rate Strength:** USD/NAD at 16.08 (14% y/y appreciation) directly lowers import costs. BoN explicitly attributed 0.2 pp of its downward forecast revision to currency strength.

3. **Food Disinflation:** Food inflation decelerated sharply to 2.6% in December 2025 from 6.2% in March 2025. Better harvest expectations and lower regional grain prices support continued moderation.

4. **Official Forecasts:** 
   - BoN (December 2025): 3.8% for 2026 average
   - Simonis Storm: 3.6-3.8% for 2026 average
   - These represent full-year averages; Q1 typically runs slightly higher

**Factors Supporting Higher Inflation:**

1. **Seasonal Q1 Pattern:** Historical tendency for March to exceed December due to lean-season food demand and post-holiday effects

2. **Housing/Utilities Acceleration:** Rose to 4.5% in December from 4.1% in November, suggesting administered price pressures

3. **Mean Reversion:** December 2025's 3.2% is at the low end of BoN's 3-6% target band; some reversion toward mid-range is plausible

4. **Base Effects:** March 2025's 4.2% creates a favorable base for year-on-year comparison, but this is neutral rather than directional

**Synthesis:**

The most likely outcome for March 2026 sits in the 3.4-4.2% range:
- **Lower bound (~3.4%):** If fuel cuts, currency strength, and food disinflation fully persist through March
- **Central estimate (~3.7-3.9%):** Modest seasonal uptick from December's 3.2% toward BoN's 3.8% annual forecast
- **Upper bound (~4.2%):** If oil prices rebound or seasonal food pressures exceed expectations

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed due to:
- Asymmetric risks: Oil/currency shocks tend to be sudden and upward
- BoN's credible 3.8% anchor for the full year
- Strong recent disinflationary momentum reducing probability of sharp reversal

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Reference Classes:**

1. **March 2025 baseline (4.2%):** One year prior provides seasonal anchor but doesn't account for 2025-2026 disinflationary trend

2. **December 2025 actual (3.2%):** Most recent data point but likely seasonal low; March typically 0.3-0.5 pp higher than December based on historical patterns

3. **BoN 2026 forecast (3.8%):** Full-year average from credible source; Q1 typically runs 0.1-0.3 pp above annual average

**Distribution Construction:**

**Central tendency (P40-P60):** Should cluster around 3.7-4.0%
- Reflects modest seasonal lift from December's 3.2%
- Aligns with BoN's 3.8% annual forecast
- Incorporates fuel cut benefits

**Lower tail (P10):** ~3.2%
- Scenario: Fuel cuts + currency strength + food disinflation fully offset seasonal pressures
- Probability ~10%: Would require exceptional continuation of December trends

**Upper tail (P90):** ~4.5%
- Scenario: Oil price spike to $90+ and/or rand weakness to 18.0+
- Probability ~10%: Plausible given geopolitical/commodity volatility but not baseline

**Intermediate percentiles:**
- P20 (~3.5%): Below seasonal norm but still above December
- P40 (~3.7%): Lower end of central range, incorporating fuel cut benefits
- P60 (~3.9%): Upper end of central range, modest seasonal pressures
- P80 (~4.2%): Match to March 2025, representing stalled disinflation

**Calibration Checks:**

1. **90/10 range = 3.2% to 4.5% (1.3 pp spread):** Reasonable given:
   - Historical volatility: March 2024-2025 moved 0.3 pp
   - December 2025 to March 2026 involves seasonal reversal + policy impacts
   - Oil/FX risks warrant wider bounds than pure trend extrapolation

2. **Median (~3.8%):** Matches BoN forecast and Simonis Storm midpoint; defensible as modal outcome

3. **Skewness:** Slight right skew (P50-P10 = 0.6 pp vs P90-P50 = 0.7 pp) reflects asymmetric upside risks from commodities

4. **Upset rate consideration:** Namibian inflation has been relatively stable within the 3-6% band. Major upsets (>1 pp deviation from forecast) are rare absent external shocks. The 90/10 range adequately captures this stability while allowing for tail risks.
