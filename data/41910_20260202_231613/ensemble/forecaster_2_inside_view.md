## (a) Source Analysis

**High-quality factual sources:**

1. **TheGlobalEconomy.com (NSA data through Dec 2025)** - Provides official NSA monthly inflation series. Dec 2025: 3.19%, showing declining trend from Oct (3.61%). Historical average 4.81% (2012-2025). **Quality: Excellent** - direct NSA data, current through Feb 2 2026.

2. **Xinhua (Jan 8, 2026)** - Reports NSA's official Dec 2025 figures: 3.2% annual, 0.1% m/m. Core inflation 3.4%. Housing/utilities 4.5%, services 4.0%. **Quality: Excellent** - timely official data with category breakdown.

3. **Observer24 (Jan 29, 2026)** - Reports BoN forecasts 3% growth 2025, 3.9% 2026. Dec 2025 inflation 3.2%. EAN warns growth won't create jobs but confirms macro stability. **Quality: Good** - recent, quotes official BoN projections.

4. **CNBC Africa (Apr 16, 2025)** - Historical: BoN held rates at 6.75%, revised 2026 inflation forecast UP to 4.5% from 4.4%. March 2025 inflation was 4.2%. **Quality: Good** but **dated** (10 months old) - circumstances have changed significantly.

5. **Neweralive (Jan 13, 2026)** - Simonis Storm (SS) forecasts 2026 inflation 3.6-3.8%. Expects two 25bp rate cuts bringing repo to 6.00%. Identifies housing/utilities and services as key drivers. **Quality: Good** - recent expert analysis with clear methodology.

6. **NSA website** - Incomplete extraction, no usable data.

7. **AllAfrica (Jan 9, 2026)** - SS predicts 25bp BoN rate cut Q1 2026 contingent on inflation staying in target. Nov 2025 inflation was 3.4%. **Quality: Moderate** - expert opinion but limited detail.

8. **InstaForex/Zawya (Oct-Dec 2025)** - Historical BoN decisions: Oct cut to 6.50%, Dec hold at 6.50%. Inflation projections revised DOWN to 3.6% (2025) and 4.0% (2026). **Quality: Good** - official BoN statements but pre-date recent developments.

**AskNews articles - mostly irrelevant:**
- Multiple Brazil inflation articles (irrelevant)
- Austria inflation (irrelevant)
- South Africa rate hold at 6.75% (Jan 29, 2026) - **Relevant context**: SA's policy affects Namibia due to currency peg. SA inflation 3.2% Dec, held rates citing services inflation above 4%.
- Namibia-specific: Confirms BoN at 6.50% (Dec 2025), inflation 3.4% (Nov 2025), projected rate cut Q1 2026.

**Key factual observations:**
- Latest official data: Dec 2025 = 3.2% (down from 3.4% Nov, 3.6% Oct)
- Clear downtrend: peaked mid-2025 around 3.7%, now 3.2%
- BoN's Oct 2025 projection: 2026 average 4.0% (revised down 0.2pp)
- Private sector (SS) Jan 2026: 2026 average 3.6-3.8%
- March 2025 actual: 4.2%
- SA (pegged currency partner): holding rates, inflation 3.2%

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**

1. **Established downtrend (Dec 2025: 3.2%)** - Multiple independent sources (NSA via Xinhua, TheGlobalEconomy, Observer24) confirm Dec 2025 at 3.2%, down from 3.6% in Oct. This is a 0.4pp decline over 2 months. *Direction: Downward pressure on March 2026.*

2. **Currency peg stability** - Namibia dollar pegged 1:1 to rand. SA held rates Jan 29 with inflation at 3.2%, rand stable around 16.3/USD (per TheGlobalEconomy). Peg preserved, no import price shock expected. *Direction: Neutral to slight downward pressure.*

3. **Expert consensus convergence** - SS (Jan 2026): 3.6-3.8% for 2026 average. BoN (Oct 2025): 4.0% average. TradingEconomics model: 4.0% Q1. All significantly below historical 4.81% average. *Direction: Moderate downward adjustment from base rate.*

**Moderate evidence:**

4. **Sectoral drivers identified** - Housing/utilities 4.5%, services 4.0%, goods 2.7% (Dec 2025 per Xinhua). Services sticky but goods disinflationary. SS expects housing/utilities to remain elevated but contained. *Direction: Mixed - some upward pressure from services, offset by goods.*

5. **Monetary policy stance** - BoN at 6.50% (Dec hold after Oct cut), SS expects further 25bp cuts in 2026. Accommodative bias supports economic activity but also price stability focus. *Direction: Neutral - balancing act.*

6. **Seasonal patterns** - March typically sees education cost increases (school year). However, 2025 March (4.2%) was higher than surrounding months, suggesting seasonal peak may have passed. *Direction: Slight upward risk from seasonality.*

**Weak evidence:**

7. **Global context** - IMF projects 3.3% global growth, easing inflation. Oil prices stable-to-lower. *Direction: Slight downward pressure but indirect.*

8. **Domestic growth** - BoN forecasts 3.9% 2026 growth (up from 3% 2025). Modest acceleration could support demand-side inflation but from low base. *Direction: Minimal upward pressure.*

**Evidence NOT considered (speculative/unreliable):**
- Fuel price cuts mentioned in agent report lack official source confirmation
- EAN jobs warning is political commentary, not inflation forecast
- April 2025 BoN upward revision to 4.5% is outdated given Oct downward revision

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction horizon:** 59 days (Feb 2 → April 2 resolution, based on March 2026 data released ~early April).

**If halved (30 days):** Would be predicting Feb 2026 inflation. Given Dec→Jan typically shows modest m/m changes (0.1% in Dec 2025), and downtrend established, would expect ~3.1-3.3% for Feb. Tighter distribution, less uncertainty.

**If doubled (120 days):** Would be predicting May 2026. More time for shocks (oil, rand volatility, policy changes). Wider distribution, mean might drift toward 2026 average forecasts (3.6-3.8%). Greater uncertainty around 4.0%.

**Key insight:** 2-month horizon is short enough that momentum matters heavily. Established downtrend from 3.6% (Oct) → 3.2% (Dec) suggests continuation unless shock occurs. But long enough for seasonal factors (March education costs) to materialize.

## (d) Justification & Distribution Calibration

**Outside view baseline recap:**
- Historical March average (2014-2025): 4.5%
- Recent trend: 3.2% (Dec 2025), down from 4.2% (March 2025)
- Reference class std dev: ~1.3pp

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **Strong downtrend justifies -0.8pp from historical mean** - Current 3.2% is 1.3pp below historical average and trend is accelerating downward. Linear extrapolation (Dec 3.2% + 2 months at recent -0.2pp/month pace) = 2.8%. However, this is overly mechanical.

2. **Expert consensus 3.6-4.0% for 2026 average** - March is early in year, likely slightly above annual average due to education seasonality. Adjust upward 0.2-0.3pp from annual forecast → 3.8-4.2% range.

3. **Balancing momentum vs mean reversion** - Very low readings (sub-3%) are rare historically (only COVID period). Some reversion toward 3.5-4.0% zone is likely, but not all the way to 4.5%.

**Synthesis:**
- Central tendency: 3.6% (midpoint of SS forecast, accounting for March being early-year)
- Downside scenario (continuation of trend + no seasonal bump): 2.8-3.0%
- Upside scenario (mean reversion + rand weakness + oil spike): 4.5-5.0%
- Extreme downside (sub-2.5%): Very unlikely absent deflation shock
- Extreme upside (above 5.5%): Would require major rand collapse or oil shock

**Distribution shape:** Slightly right-skewed (easier to have upside shock than sustained deflation). Standard deviation ~0.7pp (slightly wider than outside view to account for uncertainty in trend persistence).

Probability calibration:

**Core range (60% probability): 3.2% - 4.2%**
- This captures: trend continuation (3.2-3.6%), expert consensus (3.6-3.8%), modest seasonal uptick (3.8-4.2%)

**Lower tail (below 3.2%, 20% probability):**
- Requires: aggressive trend continuation, no seasonal effects, possible deflation in goods
- Percentile 10 (2.9%): Trend extends at -0.15pp/month
- Percentile 5 (2.6%): Aggressive disinflationary shock
- Percentile 1 (2.0%): Extreme deflation (historical minimum territory)

**Upper tail (above 4.2%, 20% probability):**
- Requires: mean reversion, seasonal bump, or external shock
- Percentile 90 (4.8%): Combination of seasonality + modest rand/oil shock
- Percentile 95 (5.3%): Significant external shock (rand to 19+, oil +$20)
- Percentile 99 (6.5%): Major crisis (historical high was 8.2% but requires extreme circumstances)

**Key percentile logic:**
- Median (50th): 3.7% - slightly above current 3.2% for seasonal adjustment, within expert range
- Mean: ~3.8% - right-skewed distribution pulls mean slightly above median
- 10th-90th range: 2.9% - 4.8% (1.9pp spread, wider than 2-sigma historical to account for trend uncertainty)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Namibia annual CPI inflation rate (%) for March 2026, per NSA/TradingEconomics. ✓ Analysis focused on this exact metric.

2. **Base rate:** Historical March average 4.5%, std dev 1.3pp. Current circumstances (3.2% Dec 2025, downtrend, expert forecasts 3.6-4.0%) justify significant downward adjustment to 3.6-3.8% central range. ✓

3. **Consistency:** Implied median = 3.7%, mean ≈ 3.8%. This aligns with SS forecast (3.6-3.8% annual average), accounts for March seasonal effects, and reflects established downtrend from 4.2% (March 2025) to 3.2% (Dec 2025). ✓

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Dec 2025 official: 3.2% (NSA via multiple sources) - factually solid
   - Downtrend: -0.4pp Oct-Dec 2025 - factually solid
   - SS expert forecast: 3.6-3.8% 2026 average (Jan 2026) - credible, recent
   - SA rate hold, inflation 3.2% (Jan 2026) - supports peg stability
   - March 2025 was 4.2% - factual baseline for y/y comparison

5. **Blind spot:** Sudden rand collapse (e.g., SA political crisis, global risk-off) could spike import inflation rapidly, pushing outcome to 5-6%. This would make forecast look too conservative. Direction: UPWARD. Probability: ~5-10% (captured in upper tail).
