## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Namibia's March annual inflation rates (2020-2025):**
   - Most specific reference class
   - Data: March 2024 = 4.5%, March 2025 = 4.2%
   - Limited sample but highly relevant

2. **Namibia's monthly inflation throughout 2025:**
   - Broader temporal context
   - Shows trajectory: peaked mid-year, declined to 3.2% by December
   - March 2026 would be Q1, historically slightly higher than year-end

3. **Namibia's inflation during periods of currency strength and falling fuel prices:**
   - Mechanistic reference class
   - Current conditions: 14% currency appreciation, fuel cuts in February
   - Historical average 1973-2025: 8.75% (too broad, includes different regimes)

**Selected reference class**: Namibia's 2025 monthly inflation trajectory, anchored to March 2025 baseline (4.2%), adjusted for known 2026 factors. This combines temporal specificity with mechanistic understanding of current drivers.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: March 2026 is approximately 1 month away (resolves May 2026 when data published).

**Historical patterns:**
- March 2024 → March 2025: declined 0.3 pp (4.5% → 4.2%)
- 2025 trajectory: March 4.2% → September 3.5% → December 3.2%
- Seasonal pattern: Q1 typically shows slight elevation vs. year-end due to lean-season food prices

**Key differences for March 2026:**
- February 2026 fuel cuts (-N$1.00/l petrol) should subtract ~0.15 pp
- Currency 14% stronger y/y, suppressing import costs
- Food inflation moderating (2.6% in December vs. 6.2% in March 2025)
- New BoN governor maintaining policy continuity

## (d) Justification

The outside view suggests March 2026 inflation will fall in the 3.0-4.5% range, centered around 3.5-3.8%.

**Supporting factors for lower outcome:**
1. Strong downward momentum through 2025 (4.2% → 3.2%)
2. February 2026 fuel cuts providing immediate disinflationary impulse
3. Currency strength (14% appreciation) suppressing import costs
4. Food inflation moderating significantly (6.2% → 2.6%)
5. Expert consensus (BoN 3.8%, Simonis Storm 3.6-3.8%)

**Supporting factors for higher outcome:**
1. Seasonal Q1 elevation (lean season food pressure)
2. March 2025 was 4.2% (1.0 pp above December 2025)
3. Housing/utilities showing persistence (4.5% in December)
4. Oil price volatility risk
5. Potential currency reversal

**Base case reasoning**: March 2026 should show modest elevation above December 2025's 3.2%, but significantly below March 2025's 4.2% due to structural improvements (fuel cuts, currency). TradingEconomics' Q1 2026 forecast of 4.0% appears slightly high given February developments. A range of 3.4-3.9% captures the likely outcome, with central tendency around 3.6%.

## Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:

1. **Central tendency**: Expert consensus at 3.6-3.8%, with BoN's official 3.8% forecast carrying significant weight. The February fuel cuts tilt this slightly lower toward 3.6%.

2. **Lower tail (10th-30th percentiles)**: Accounts for scenarios where:
   - Fuel cuts have larger-than-expected impact
   - Currency continues strengthening
   - Food prices remain exceptionally soft
   - Range: 2.8-3.4%

3. **Upper tail (70th-90th percentiles)**: Accounts for:
   - Oil price spike
   - Currency reversal (rand weakness)
   - Stronger seasonal food pressures
   - Housing tariff increases
   - Range: 3.9-4.8%

4. **Extreme tails**: 
   - Below 2.5%: Would require deflationary shock (very unlikely given policy stance)
   - Above 5.0%: Would require major external shock (oil >$100/bbl, currency crisis)
   - Historical volatility suggests 10-90 range of ~2.0 pp is appropriate

5. **Calibration checks**:
   - 90/10 spread of ~2.0 pp reflects moderate uncertainty
   - Central 40-60 range spans 0.4 pp (tight around consensus)
   - Distribution slightly skewed toward upside risk (oil/currency volatility)
   - Consistent with BoN's 3-6% target band remaining relevant

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.9
Percentile 20: 3.2
Percentile 40: 3.5
Percentile 60: 3.8
Percentile 80: 4.2
Percentile 90: 4.9
