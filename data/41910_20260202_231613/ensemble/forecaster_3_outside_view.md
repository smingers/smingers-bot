Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **The Namibian (Apr 8, 2025): “Annual inflation slowed to 4.2% in March”**  
- **What it provides (facts):** March 2025 headline y/y inflation **4.2%**; down from **4.5%** in March 2024. Food inflation was **6.2%** with notable increases in bread/cereals and meat.  
- **Quality:** Reputable local media, and it attributes the figure to the **Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA)** (high credibility for the headline number).  
- **Usefulness:** Very relevant because the target is **March 2026 y/y**, which will be benchmarked against the March 2025 price level.

2) **NSA event page for CPI March 2025 (Apr 8, 2025)**  
- **What it provides:** Essentially **no usable CPI data** in the extracted content (navigation/metadata only).  
- **Quality:** NSA is the best primary source, but **this capture is incomplete**, so it can’t anchor the forecast numerically beyond confirming a release exists.

3) **TradingEconomics Namibia inflation page (accessed; latest cited Dec 2025 = 3.2%)**  
- **What it provides (facts):** Dec 2025 headline y/y inflation **3.2%** (from 3.4% in Nov 2025), with category notes (food slowed, housing/utilities accelerated).  
- **What it provides (model opinions):** TE “forecast” **end of Q1 2026: 4.0%**; longer-run 2027: 3.2%, 2028: 2.7%.  
- **Quality:** TE is generally reliable for **reported historical prints**, but its forecasts are **model-based** and can be noisy, especially for small economies.

4) **Business Insider (Jan 13, 2026) US CPI story**  
- **What it provides:** US inflation context only; **not Namibia-relevant** as a direct driver except indirectly via global rates/commodities.  
- **Quality:** Fine for US macro, but **low direct relevance** to Namibia March 2026 CPI.

5) **The Voice of Africa (Dec 20, 2025): new central bank governor**  
- **What it provides:** Leadership change effective Jan 1, 2026, framed as **continuity**. No numeric inflation forecast.  
- **Quality:** Medium; useful mainly as a “policy regime stability” signal, not a quantitative input.

6) **Finance in Africa (Oct 16, 2025): BoN rate cut + projections**  
- **What it provides (facts + attributable institutional view):** BoN cut repo to 6.5%; reported recent inflation (Aug 2025 3.2%, Sep 2025 3.5%); cites BoN projection **2026: 4.0%** at that time, revised down due to **stronger exchange rate** and **lower oil outlook**.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high because it reports **named officials** and specific projections; still secondary reporting but anchored to BoN statements.

7) **Agent report (compiled; dated to today’s context 2 Feb 2026)**  
- **What it provides:** A synthesized narrative: end-2025 inflation 3.2%; 2025 avg 3.5%; mentions analyst (Simonis Storm) **2026 avg 3.6–3.8%**; BoN (Dec 2025) **2026 forecast 3.8%** (revised down); notes **Feb 2026 fuel price cuts** and exchange-rate strength (NAD tied to ZAR).  
- **Quality:** Mixed: it cites plausible institutions, but it’s a **secondary synthesis** with some items hard to verify from the provided excerpts (notably the fuel-cut details and some specific attributions). I treat it as **directionally informative** and give more weight to points that align with other sources (BoN forecast revisions; recent inflation ~3–4%).

### (b) Reference class analysis (base rates)

Possible reference classes:

1) **Namibia monthly y/y headline inflation in the last ~10 years (most suitable)**  
- Rationale: Same country, same CPI methodology, same exchange-rate regime (NAD pegged to ZAR), and captures typical variance from food/fuel/administered prices.  
- Expectation: Recent-era outcomes tend to cluster in a mid-single-digit band; the BoN target is 3–6%, and recent prints (2024–2025) appear mostly in the **~3–4.5%** range.

2) **Rand-anchored small open economies’ inflation (Lesotho/Eswatini/Namibia-like) in 2024–2026**  
- Useful as a cross-check on imported inflation and fuel/food pass-through, but CPI weights/admin prices differ; less direct than (1).

3) **Long-run Namibia inflation since the 1970s (TE average 8.75%)**  
- Not suitable for this horizon: regime changes and the global inflation environment make that average a poor guide for 2026.

**Chosen reference class:** (1) Namibia in the recent decade, with extra weight on **2023–2025** as most regime-relevant.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Target month:** March 2026 (y/y).  
- **From today (Feb 2, 2026) to the target month:** ~1–2 months until the print is realized; resolution by May 2, 2026.  
- **Implication:** This is a **short-horizon** inflation forecast; large structural shifts are unlikely, but **fuel price adjustments, exchange-rate moves, and administered tariffs** can still swing the y/y rate by ~0.5–1.5 pp.

Seasonality considerations (qualitative, given limited monthly history provided):  
- Early-year and Q1 can reflect **administered price resets** and schooling/service fee changes; that can put **upward pressure** on y/y.  
- The agent report also flags Q1 food dynamics (lean season) as potentially firmer, though harvest effects may ease later.

### (d) Justification (outside-view baseline)

**Anchor points from provided history / near-term context:**
- March 2025: **4.2%** (NSA via The Namibian).  
- Dec 2025: **3.2%** (TradingEconomics reported print).  
- Institutional/analyst expectations for **2026 average**: roughly **3.6–4.0%** (BoN/Finance in Africa; agent synthesis; TE model end-Q1 2026 ~4.0).

**Outside-view baseline logic:**  
1) A reasonable base rate for Namibia in the current regime is that March 2026 inflation will land in the **mid-to-high 3%s or around 4%**, given:  
   - Recent realized disinflation into late 2025 (~3.2%).  
   - Multiple forecasts clustering around **~3.6–4.0% for 2026** (annual average).  
2) **March vs annual-average tilt:** March can be a bit higher than the eventual annual average if Q1 has seasonal/administered pressures; that nudges the baseline **slightly upward** relative to a 2026-average of ~3.6–3.8.  
3) **Key uncertainty drivers that widen the distribution:**  
   - **Fuel/oil & transport:** can move quickly; even if a Feb fuel cut occurs, global oil can reverse.  
   - **Exchange rate (via the rand peg):** a risk-off move can weaken ZAR/NAD and raise imported inflation quickly.  
   - **Administered prices (utilities, municipal services):** can keep “core” components sticky even if food/fuel soften.

**Outside-view central estimate:** ~**3.8–4.0%** for March 2026 y/y, with meaningful probability of outcomes in the low 3s (if currency remains strong and fuel stays benign) and a smaller-but-real tail into mid-5s (if oil/rand move adversely and administered prices bite).

Outside view calibration:

- I treat the “consensus” (BoN/analysts/TE) as anchoring the **center** around **3.8–4.0** for early 2026, but I avoid an overly tight band because Namibia inflation is exposed to **oil and FX shocks**.  
- Given typical surprises in monthly CPI for small open economies, I set a **fairly wide 10–90 interval** of about **2.8 to 5.6** (width 2.8 pp). This allows for:
  - **Downside:** continued disinflation from late 2025 plus favorable FX/fuel.  
  - **Upside:** oil rebound and/or rand weakness and/or larger administered tariff increases than expected.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.8  
Percentile 20: 3.2  
Percentile 40: 3.6  
Percentile 60: 4.0  
Percentile 80: 4.7  
Percentile 90: 5.6
