Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. NSA / TradingEconomics prints – factual monthly CPI data to December 2025 (headline 3.2 percent). Primary data, high quality, dated 8 Jan 2026.  
2. Xinhua 8 Jan 2026 – repeats NSA’s December print, adds category detail. Reliable wire report; factual.  
3. New Era 13 Jan 2026 – quotes Simonis Storm (local brokerage) forecasting 2026 average 3.6–3.8 percent. Opinion from named analysts; moderate quality.  
4. Observer24 29 Jan 2026 – cites Bank of Namibia growth and repeats 3.2 percent inflation. Adds BoN projection of 3.9 percent growth; factual.  
5. BoN policy statements (Oct 15 2025 cut; Dec 14 2025 hold) – give official inflation forecasts 2026 = 4.0 → 3.8 percent. High quality, dated.  
6. TradingEconomics model forecast end-Q1 2026 ≈ 4.0 percent. Automated model; lower weight.  
7. Misc. South-Africa-focused articles – provide context on rand, SARB target (3 percent). Indirect evidence.  
Overall: hard data through Dec 2025 show a downward trend to just above 3 percent; every institutional forecast for 2026 clusters 3.6–4.0 percent.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• NSA prints: December headline 3.2 percent confirms current low-3 trajectory.  
• Currency peg to South Africa and SARB adopting 3 percent target structurally anchor imported inflation.  
Moderate evidence  
• BoN and Simonis Storm forecasts (3.6–4.0 percent) – single reliable sources with clear methodology.  
• Seasonal/administered price resets in Q1 historically push Namibia CPI up ~0.3-0.5 pp.  
Weak evidence  
• TradingEconomics model forecast; anecdotal comments on possible February fuel price cuts; leadership change at BoN.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target print is for March 2026, 2 months from today; first release due mid-April. If the horizon were halved (predicting February) I would shift the distribution 0.1 pp lower and narrow it slightly; doubled (predict September) I would widen the 90/10 band by ~0.4 pp on both tails because exchange-rate and oil uncertainty grows with time.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (2015-2025 March median) ≈ 4.5 percent. Recent disinflation, firmer rand, and lower oil justify a downward shift of about 1 pp.  
Current trend continuation (Nov 3.36 → Dec 3.19) projects March near 3.1–3.3 percent. Seasonal Q1 upward bias (+0.3 pp) and likely electricity tariff hike (+0.2 pp) lift the expectation to the 3.5-3.8 range.  
Risks: 1) Oil/rand shock (upper tail +1.5 pp), 2) larger-than-expected administered price rises (+1 pp), 3) continued global disinflation / bumper harvest (lower tail −1 pp). Combining these, I centre the distribution at 3.7 percent with a 90-percent range 2.4 to 5.8 percent.

Probability calibration
Mean ≈ 3.9 percent; median ≈ 3.7 percent. Distribution is right-skewed owing to larger potential jumps from an FX/oil shock than from further disinflation.

Checklist:  
1. Target: headline year-on-year CPI for Namibia, March 2026, percent.  
2. Base rate used: March inflation 2015-2025 median 4.5 percent.  
3. Implied median = 3.7; mean = 3.9 – consistent with analysis.  
4. Key evidence: a) Dec-25 print 3.2; b) BoN 2026 forecast 3.8; c) SARB new 3 percent target anchors rand inflation; d) Q1 seasonal admin hikes.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rand depreciation above 20 per USD after a risk-off shock – would push inflation > 6 percent.
