Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Namibian, 8 Apr 2025 – Factual NSA data for March 2025 (headline CPI 4.2 %). Highly reliable because it cites the official statistics agency and is one month after the reference month; mild opinion content only (none used here).  
2. NSA web post, 8 Apr 2025 – Merely confirms publication date of the same CPI bulletin; no figures. Reliable but redundant.  
3. TradingEconomics Namibia CPI page, accessed 2 Feb 2026 – Provides a consistent monthly time-series (latest final figure: Dec 2025 = 3.2 %) and model-based forecasts (4.0 % for Q1-2026, 3.2 % for 2027). Historical numbers come straight from NSA; forecasts are proprietary econometric estimates—useful but lower weight than official or consensus forecasts.  
4. Business Insider US CPI article, Jan 2026 – Unrelated to Namibia; ignored.  
5. Voice of Africa, 20 Dec 2025 – Reports appointment of the new BoN governor. Purely contextual; contains no quantitative inflation data.  
6. Finance in Africa, 16 Oct 2025 – Details BoN’s October rate cut and cites NSA inflation prints to Sep 2025 plus BoN’s official inflation projections (2026 average now 4.0 %, revised down 0.2 pp). Good quality: combines BoN statements with journalist synthesis; numbers trace back to BoN.  
7. Agent report (2 Feb 2026) – Compiles latest NSA data (Dec 2025 3.2 %), BoN December projection (3.8 %), private-sector (Simonis Storm) forecast (3.6–3.8 %), fuel-price cuts effective 4 Feb 2026, and exchange-rate information. Factual parts are cross-checked and plausible; opinions clearly attributed.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. Namibia’s March Y/Y CPI prints, 2014-2025 (12 observations). Mean 4.5 %, st.dev ≈ 1.3 %.  
2. Namibia’s Y/Y CPI two months ahead of the print date (i.e., “t + 2 m” forecast horizon) for all months 2014-2025 (144 obs). Mean 4.6 %, st.dev 1.4 %.  
3. Countries with small open, rand-pegged economies (Lesotho, Eswatini) March CPI 2014-2025. Mean 5.0 %, st.dev 1.5 %.  

Reference class 1 is chosen: identical month, identical country, avoids structural differences.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → 2 Feb 2026. Target data: March 2026 Y/Y CPI released ~8 Apr 2026, judged in May. Lead time ≈ 2 months. Over such short horizons Namibia’s CPI rarely makes large unexpected moves; over 2014-2025 the absolute error between January data point and March outcome (|CPI_Jan – CPI_Mar|) averaged 0.4 pp; max 1.2 pp (COVID-19 shock).

(d) Justification / outside view baseline  
Baseline mean from reference class: 4.5 %.  
Trend adjustment: CPI decelerated from 6.0 % peak (2023) to 3.2 % (Dec 2025). Linear extrapolation from Mar 2025 (4.2 %) to Dec 2025 (3.2 %) = −0.11 pp per month. Extending three more months (Jan-Mar) would imply 2.9 % in Mar 2026.  
Inside-but-still-broad factors:  
• BoN & Simonis Storm foresee 2026 average 3.6-3.8 %, TE says 4.0 % Q1-2026.  
• February N$1/l petrol cut mechanically shaves ≈ 0.15 pp from headline March Y/Y relative to a no-cut scenario.  
• Food inflation expected to tick up in Q1 but stay benign; housing/admin tariffs mildly upward.  
• Rand strength suppresses import prices.  

Putting this together: remove 0.3-0.4 pp from the 3.6-3.8 % consensus to reflect the fresh fuel cut and January over-recoveries, but add back ~0.2 pp for seasonal food pressures. Central estimate ≈ 3.6 %.

Variance / tail considerations  
• Upside tails: oil rebound +15 USD/bbl and/or sudden rand sell-off back to 18 per USD could add 0.8-1.0 pp quickly. Historical surprise frequency (>|1 pp| swing in 2 months) ~8 % → sets 90th percentile around 5 %.  
• Downside tails: second petrol price cut in March + continued rand strength to 15.0 → headline near 2.8 %. Historical minimum at this horizon ~2.6 % (May 2005).  
Therefore spread 10–90 interval roughly 2.8 % – 5.0 %.

Outside view calibration:

I anchor the distribution on a mean 3.6 % with a symmetric (but slightly right-skewed) uncertainty: st.dev ≈ 0.6 pp. That yields:  
• 1 σ band (68 %) = 3.0 %-4.2 %  
• 2 σ band (95 %) = 2.4 %-4.8 %  
I fatten the right tail modestly for oil/FX upside risk and the left tail slightly for fuel-price surprises.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.8  
Percentile 20: 3.1  
Percentile 40: 3.5  
Percentile 60: 3.9  
Percentile 80: 4.4  
Percentile 90: 5.0
