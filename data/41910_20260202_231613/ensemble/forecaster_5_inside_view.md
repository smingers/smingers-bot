Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality / date / factual vs. opinion)  
   • Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) release via Xinhua, 8 Jan 2026 – primary data compiler; Dec-2025 headline CPI 3.2 percent. High quality, factual.  
   • TheGlobalEconomy data set, 31 Dec 2025 – mirrors NSA history back to 2012. High quality, factual.  
   • Observer24, 29 Jan 2026 – quotes NSA figure and carries EAN commentary. Factual (inflation), opinion (jobs). Moderate quality.  
   • New Era, 13 Jan 2026 – cites Simonis Storm forecast 3.6-3.8 percent 2026 average. Reliable local brokerage; forecast = expert opinion. Moderate quality.  
   • Zawya/allAfrica, 14 Dec 2025 – Bank of Namibia (BoN) holds rate; revises 2026 average CPI to 4.0 percent. High quality (central-bank primary), factual forecast.  
   • Zawya/allAfrica, 15 Oct 2025 – BoN rate cut, same 4.0 percent 2026 CPI forecast. High quality.  
   • CNBC Africa, 16 Apr 2025 – March-2025 YoY CPI 4.2 percent. Historical factual.  
   • TradingEconomics live page (accessed today) – history plus mechanical “Q1-2026 4 percent” model. History = high quality; model = low quality (black-box).  
   • South-Africa articles (SARB 31 Jan – 2 Feb 2026) – confirm South-Africa CPI 3.2-3.6 percent, policy hold at 6.75 percent. Useful for peg context. Moderately reliable.  
   All other Asknews pieces are about Brazil, Austria, Poland, Argentina – irrelevant.

2. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence  
   • NSA actual headline inflation 3.2 percent in Dec 2025.  
   • Namibia’s 2014-2025 March YoY CPI mean 4.5 percent; post-COVID regime (2023-25) mean 3.6 percent.  
   • Currency peg links Namibia to South-Africa, whose CPI is currently 3.3-3.6 percent and SARB projects easing in 2026.  
   Moderate evidence  
   • BoN forecast (Oct & Dec 2025) 4.0 percent 2026 average, revised down 0.2 pp.  
   • Simonis Storm forecast 3.6-3.8 percent 2026 average; expects 25 bp BoN cut in Q1 2026, implying contained inflation.  
   • February-2026 announced fuel-price cuts (petrol −1.00 N$, diesel −0.50 N$) cut headline CPI ~0.15 pp by March.  
   Weak evidence  
   • TradingEconomics model 4 percent.  
   • Anecdotal hints of housing tariff increases later in 2026.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Target publication due mid-April 2026, about 70 days away. Historically, the two-month volatility of Namibia’s YoY CPI (95 percent range) is ±1.3 pp; mean absolute change 0.35 pp. If the horizon were halved to one month, st.d. falls roughly one-third; doubled to four months, macro risks (oil, currency) widen the tails by ~20 percent.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments  
   Outside-view median (reference class) = 3.6 percent (post-2022 March mean).  
   Adjustments:  
   • Fuel-price cuts −0.15 pp  
   • Normal March food seasonality +0.25 pp  
   • Rand strength vs. dollar (up 14 percent y/y) −0.10 pp  
   • Possible municipal tariff hikes (water, electricity) +0.05 pp  
   Net = −0.0-0.1 pp → centre stays near 3.6 percent.  
   Upside tail: oil rebound, rand sell-off, drought-driven food spike. Downside tail: additional fuel cut, bumper harvest, surprise VAT holiday. Both are historically rare but possible; retain fat tails by setting σ ≈0.8 pp.

Probability calibration
Implied mean 3.6 percent; median 3.6 percent; 80-percent interval 2.8-4.5 percent; 90-percent interval 2.4-5.3 percent. Distribution is roughly normal but stretched in the upper tail.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Year-on-year CPI for March 2026, Namibia, percent.  
2. Outside-view base rate 3.6 percent (March 2023-25 average).  
3. Consistency: median 3.6; mean 3.6; matches narrative.  
4. Key evidence: a) Dec 2025 CPI 3.2, b) long-run March average 3.6, c) BoN 2026 forecast 4.0, d) Feb 2026 fuel cut −0.15 pp, e) strong rand.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden 20 percent rand depreciation in March; would push CPI well above 5 percent.
