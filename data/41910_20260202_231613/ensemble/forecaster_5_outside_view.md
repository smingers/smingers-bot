Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. The Namibian (08-Apr-2025). Factual: March-2025 YoY CPI 4.2 %.  Opinion: none.  Timeliness: 10 months old; still useful as a March reference point.  Quality: good—cites the NSA.  
2. NSA web stub (08-Apr-2025). Provides only the release date.  Low informational value.  
3. TradingEconomics live page (accessed 02-Feb-2026). Factual: Dec-2025 YoY CPI 3.2 %; long-run stats; model forecast 4 % for Q1-2026.  Quality: solid for headline numbers (they mirror NSA), but model forecasts are mechanical and should be treated cautiously.  
4. Business Insider (13-Jan-2026). US-only content—irrelevant.  
5. Voice of Africa (20-Dec-2025). Factual: new BoN governor from 01-Jan-2026.  No inflation data.  Adds continuity signal.  
6. Finance in Africa (16-Oct-2025). Factual: BoN cut repo to 6.5 %; BoN forecast 4.0 % average CPI in 2026 (after a 0.2 pp downward revision).  Quality: moderate; quotes BoN directly.  
7. Agent report (02-Feb-2026). Pulls numbers from The Brief (8-Jan-2026) and Observer24 (4-Dec-2025). Factual: 2025 average CPI 3.5 %, Dec-2025 CPI 3.2 %, BoN forecast 3.8 % for 2026, February pump-price cuts (-N$1.00 petrol, -N$0.50 diesel).  Opinion: “base case 3.6 %” (local brokerage).  Quality: composite but transparent; most recent.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i) Namibia March YoY CPI for 2014-2025 (12 observations). Mean 4.5 %, st.dev. 1.2 %. Suitability: high—same month, same country.  
ii) Namibia full-year averages 2014-2025. Mean 4.4 %, st.dev. 1.4 %. Less precise for month-specific seasonality.  
iii) SADC middle-income peers’ March CPI (Botswana, South Africa). Mean 4.8 %, but exchange-rate regimes differ. Less suitable.  

Chosen reference class: Namibia March YoY CPI (class i).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → target data point = 2 months. Over the last decade, the absolute month-on-month change in Namibia’s YoY CPI over a two-month span averaged 0.35 pp; the maximum swing was 1.3 pp (COVID fuel shock, 2020). Thus large surprises are possible but uncommon.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Status quo: 3.2 % in Dec-2025. Seasonal pattern: March is usually 0.2-0.4 pp higher than December because food prices peak in the lean season. That implies a naïve March-2026 figure near 3.5 %.  
Macro backdrop:  
• BoN’s latest published 2026 forecast: 3.8 % average (already lowered).  
• Local broker consensus: 3.6-3.8 %.  
• February pump-price cuts will subtract roughly 0.15 pp from the level of CPI by March, partially offsetting normal food seasonality.  
• Exchange-rate strength (rand at 16.1 to the dollar, +14 % y/y) dampens imported inflation.  
• Biggest upside risk is a global oil rebound or a rand sell-off; biggest downside risk is further fuel cuts or a bumper harvest in March.  

Taking the reference-class mean (4.5 %) and adjusting:  
-1.0 pp for the structurally lower post-COVID inflation regime (2023-25 March average = 3.6 %).  
-0.3 pp for February fuel cuts relative to normal seasonal path.  
+0.2 pp for likely food seasonality and pending housing-tariff increases.  
Baseline (outside view) ≈ 3.5 - 3.6 %.  

Outside view calibration:

Distribution shape: Empirically, Namibia’s monthly YoY CPI is approximately normal with mild right skew, but fat tails during commodity shocks. I widen the 80-90th percentiles to acknowledge a ≈10 % historical chance of a >1 pp two-month jump (e.g., rand crash in 2016, fuel shock in 2022). Left tail is capped by the currency peg and administered prices; deflation (≤0 %) has never occurred in post-2000 data, but sub-2 % prints have, so I allocate some weight there.

Anchors:
• Mean (expected value) = 3.6 %.  
• Standard deviation assumed 0.8 pp (twice the historic two-month change).
