# Summary of Article: Namibia cuts key rate to 3-year low amid weak growth, price pressures

**Source:** Finance in Africa  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Author:** Amarachi Orjiude-Ndibe

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Monetary Policy Action:** The Bank of Namibia reduced its repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% at its fifth Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting for 2025. This is the second rate cut of the year and the lowest level since October 2022.

2. **Recent Inflation Data:**
   - September 2025: 3.5%
   - August 2025: 3.2% (seven-month low)
   - The September uptick was driven by a rebound in transport costs and higher prices for rent and utilities

3. **Inflation Projections (revised downward by 0.2 percentage points):**
   - 2025: 3.6%
   - 2026: 4.0%

4. **GDP Growth:**
   - Q2 2025: 1.6% (post-pandemic low)
   - Q2 2024: 3.3%
   - Slowdown attributed to softer growth in manufacturing and agriculture sectors

5. **Foreign Reserves:**
   - End of September 2025: N$54.7 billion ($3.2 billion)
   - July 2025: N$58.1 billion ($3.3 billion)
   - The decline reflects higher imports, external debt payments, and a stronger exchange rate

6. **Eurobond:** Namibia has a $750 million Eurobond maturing in October 2025. The government appointed three domestic lenders to help raise $122 million, with the balance covered through other government resources.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Johannes ǃGawaxab, Bank of Namibia Governor:** Stated that the inflation projection revision "reflects a stronger exchange rate assumption and a downward revision to the oil price outlook." Also noted that high-frequency indicators suggest slower economic expansion in the first eight months of 2025 compared to 2024.

- **Ericah Shafudah, Finance Minister:** Said the Eurobond redemption is "on schedule, fully funded and firmly aligned with the government's fiscal strategy," reflecting fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability.

- **Moody's Rating:** Warned that Namibia's fiscal prospects will be challenged by slowing revenues from commodities and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), with governance and fiscal management reforms being key to sustaining momentum.

## Context:
The central bank justified the rate cut as appropriate for stimulating economic activity while inflation remains within target, despite concerns about widening the gap between Namibia's policy rate and that of South Africa (the anchor country for the currency peg).
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Namibia CPI outlook 2026 food fuel exchange rate impact
Namibia ended 2025 with headline consumer-price inflation of 3.2 % year on year, comfortably inside the Bank of Namibia’s (BoN) 3 – 6 % target band and below the 3.4 % recorded a year earlier (The Brief, 8 Jan 2026). The average rate for 2025 was 3.5 %. During 2025 the main disinflationary impulse came from food, where year-end inflation slowed to 2.6 %.

1. 2026 headline-inflation forecasts  
• Simonis Storm (local broker) still projects a “slight uptick” to an annual average of 3.6 – 3.8 % in 2026.  
• BoN, after its December-2025 Monetary Policy Committee meeting, cut its own 2026 forecast to 3.8 % from 4.0 % previously, citing stronger-than-expected exchange-rate gains and a softer oil-price assumption (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025).  
• TradingEconomics’ econometric model, which foresees headline CPI of 3.2 % in 2027 and 2.7 % in 2028, is broadly consistent with an out-turn near the bottom of the 3.6 – 3.8 % range in 2026.  
Consensus therefore centres on 3.6 – 3.8 %, i.e. the lower half of the target range.

2. Key drivers in 2026

2.1 Food and non-alcoholic beverages (≈17 % of the basket)  
• TradingEconomics projects food inflation to average about 4 % in Q1-2026 and 4.4 % in 2027 (TradingEconomics, Food Inflation page, accessed 2 Feb 2026).  
• The FAO/GIEWS country brief (6 Aug 2025) reports a recovery in 2025 cereal output after the 2024 drought, lower regional wholesale prices and an expected reduction in cereal import needs in the 2025/26 marketing year.  
• The IPC expects the January-March 2026 lean season to be less acute than the previous year.  
Net impact: temporary firmness in Q1 as households rely on markets, followed by renewed deceleration once the main harvest reaches markets in Q2. Food is likely to add only 0.1-0.2 percentage points (pp) to the 2026 headline rate and should remain a dampening rather than an amplifying force.

2.2 Fuel, transport and administered energy prices (≈14 %)  
The fuel outlook has changed noticeably since the earlier research cut-off:  
• The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) recorded pump-price over-recoveries of 42-127 c/l in its January review (MME circular, mid-Dec 2025) and, after further over-recoveries in January, announced sizeable price cuts effective 4 February 2026: –N$1.00/l for petrol and –N$0.50/l for both diesel grades (The Brief, 1 Feb 2026).  
• Using the rule-of-thumb that a N$1/l movement shifts headline CPI by roughly 0.15 pp, the February reduction should subtract around 0.15 pp from the 2026 average, all else equal.  
• Whether this disinflation persists depends on crude-oil fundamentals and the currency. International prices have eased (petrol import parity at US$74/bbl in January versus US$77/bbl in December), but the BoN still lists oil volatility among the main upside risks.

2.3 Exchange rate (imported-inflation channel)  
• The Namibia dollar, pegged 1:1 to the South African rand, strengthened to USD/NAD 16.08 on 2 Feb 2026, up 14 % y/y (TradingEconomics, Currency page).  
• TradingEconomics’ model points to USD/NAD ≈ 15.6 by early 2027, suggesting a modest further appreciation over the forecast horizon.  
• A stronger currency directly lowers import-parity prices of fuel, food and manufactured goods. BoN’s downward revision to its CPI forecast in December explicitly attributes 0.2 pp of disinflation to the exchange rate (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025).  
Risk: any reversal triggered by global risk-off sentiment or a widening South Africa–Namibia interest-rate gap would rapidly feed back into pump prices and other imports.

2.4 Housing, utilities and other core services  
• The December CPI bulletin shows housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels contributing 1.1 pp to the 3.2 % headline figure (The Brief, 8 Jan 2026). Tariff adjustments in these largely administered components are expected to keep core inflation slightly above the headline again in 2026.  
• Simonis Storm flags persistent pressures in municipal services, education and medical fees, though still within a range consistent with the target.

3. Monetary-policy setting  
BoN left the repo rate at 6.50 % in December and emphasised that its stance “remains appropriate for safeguarding the one-to-one link” with the rand while fostering domestic activity (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025). With inflation now forecast at 3.8 % and the South African Reserve Bank expected to begin a cautious easing cycle, local analysts (Simonis Storm) still anticipate two 25 bp cuts in 2026, taking the repo to 6.00 %. Room for easing is contingent on inflation behaving as described above and on the exchange rate staying firm; an unexpectedly weak rand would likely derail rate-cut plans.

4. Synthesised 2026 CPI outlook  
Baseline: headline CPI averages 3.6 % in 2026, the low end of the current consensus, reflecting three new pieces of information:  
• January fuel over-recoveries and the confirmed N$1.00/N$0.50 pump-price cuts in February;  
• BoN’s lower 3.8 % forecast that already factors in currency strength;  
• Continued soft food-price dynamics supported by better harvests and lower regional grain prices.  

Scenario analysis  
• Upside: oil rebounds above US$90/bbl and/or USD/NAD weakens back above 18.0 – headline could move into the 4.5 % area.  
• Downside: crude stabilises below US$80/bbl, rand strengthens to 15.0, and housing-tariff hikes stay modest – headline could slip towards 3.3 %.  

5. Remaining information gaps  
Despite the additional data, three notable gaps persist:  
1. No item-level or sub-component CPI projections are publicly available; without them it is hard to quantify precisely the relative contributions of food, fuel, housing and services.  
2. The February-2026 BoN MPC meeting has not yet taken place; an updated Inflation Report could further revise the bank’s forecast and clarify the policy path.  
3. Apart from TradingEconomics’ generic model, there is no published consensus forecast for the USD/NAD exchange rate or for Brent crude through 2026, both critical for assessing imported inflation.  

Obtaining these inputs—particularly BoN’s post-February statement, any forward fuel-price modelling by the MME, and commercial-bank or IMF exchange-rate scenarios—would allow a more granular and statistically robust projection.  

In conclusion, the latest evidence—most notably the February pump-price cut and continuing currency strength—tilts Namibia’s 2026 inflation outlook modestly lower than previously thought, leaving the base case at 3.6 % with balanced but manageable risks stemming chiefly from oil and the exchange rate rather than from domestic food supply.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
