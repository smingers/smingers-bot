Analysis:
To gauge Namibia's March 2026 y/y inflation we first need the most recent hard data (Dec 2025 and, if already released, Jan 2026 CPI) plus commentary on drivers likely to move prices over the next two months—food (influenced by regional droughts), fuel (Rand/dollar exchange rate and global oil), and administered prices (electricity tariff decisions due in early-2026). Key sources will be:
• Namibia Statistics Agency monthly CPI bulletins (November 2025-January 2026).  
• Bank of Namibia January 2026 MPC statement and any forward-guidance interviews.  
• News or analyst notes on harvest expectations, SACU import price trends, and the upcoming 2026/27 budget (usually tabled late-February) which may change VAT/fuel levies.  

Articles giving either hard CPI figures or official/analyst forecasts for Q1-Q2 2026 will provide the best inside-view evidence.
