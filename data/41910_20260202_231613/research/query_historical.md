Analysis:
To forecast Namibia’s annual inflation rate for March 2026 we first need an outside-view baseline built from:  
• The observed y/y headline inflation path over the last 5-10 years, with special focus on March values (e.g., March 2021 = 3.1 %, 2022 = 4.5 %, 2023 = 7.2 %, 2024 = 4.7 %, 2025 ≈ 5 %—exact figures to confirm).  
• The current inflation momentum going into 2026, including December 2025 and January 2026 prints, because March y/y is mechanically anchored to the level of the CPI in March 2025.  
• The composition of Namibia’s CPI (food ≈ 17 %, transport ≈ 14 %, housing/utilities ≈ 28 %, etc.) and the outlook for the largest, most volatile components—especially food prices (affected by Southern African droughts/el Niño), energy/petrol (linked to global oil and South African fuel price adjustments), and the exchange rate of the Namibian dollar, which is pegged one-for-one to the South African rand (ZAR).  
• Policy stance: the Bank of Namibia has kept its repo rate broadly tracking the South African Reserve Bank’s tightening cycle (currently 7.75 % after a 25 bp cut in January 2026). Monetary-policy settings and expected SARB moves will shape core inflation and the exchange-rate outlook.  
• Forward-looking indicators: global food and oil futures; South Africa inflation forecasts; IMF/WB projections; local analysts’ forecasts quoted by newspapers such as The Namibian, New Era, or Namibia Economist.  
• One-off base effects: March 2025 inflation included a sharp increase in meat and fuel prices; unless those repeat, the y/y figure in March 2026 could decelerate even if month-on-month inflation stays positive.

Once we gather the exact historical CPI figures and the latest forecasts, we can construct a distribution for March 2026 centered perhaps around 4–6 %, but with tails reflecting the risk of another food-price spike (upper tail) or a sharp rand appreciation plus good harvests (lower tail). To refine that prior we must collect the precise data for:  
1) Namibia CPI series up to the latest available month (likely December 2025 or January 2026).  
2) March 2025 CPI index level and y/y rate.  
3) Any public forecasts for 2026Q1 inflation from the Bank of Namibia, NSA, or private banks.  
4) External factors: oil price path, South Africa fuel-price projections, rainfall/harvest outlook, and ZAR/USD forecasts.
