This marks the fourth consecutive week of downward revision and keeps the forecast within the target range set by the Monetary Council National (CMN), which is 3% with a tolerance margin of 1.5% to 4.5%. For 2027, the inflation expectation remains at 3.8%, while for 2028 and 2029, the market projects a stable 3.5% annual inflation rate. Short-term projections show inflation expected to rise 0.53% in February and 0.34% in March. The IGP-M, a key index for rent adjustments, saw its 2026 projection increase slightly from 3.87% to 3.92%. Prices for administered goods saw a minor decline, from 3.76% to 3.75%. Economic activity projections remained stable, with GDP growth forecast at 1.8% for 2026 and 2% for 2027. The market expects a gradual decline in the benchmark interest rate (Selic), projecting it to fall to 12.25% by the end of 2026, down from 14.5% in March, with a further drop to 10.5% by the end of 2027. The dollar exchange rate is projected to close 2026 at R$ 5.50, with a slight downward revision to R$ 5.38 for February. Fiscal projections indicate improvement in public debt, with the net public debt ratio forecast to decrease from 70.36% to 70.32% of GDP in 2026. The primary deficit is expected to remain at -0.53% of GDP, and the nominal deficit at -8.6%. The external sector forecast shows a continued trade surplus of US$ 67.65 billion in 2026, while foreign direct investment was revised downward from US$ 74.85 billion to US$ 74.35 billion. The current account deficit is projected to slightly widen from US$ -67.8 billion to US$ -67.9 billion.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:52 PM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/economia/2026/02/7345902-mercado-calmo-reduz-projecao-de-inflacao-para-2026-aponta-boletim-focus.html)\n\n**Austria's Inflation Forecast: 2026 Projection at 2.2% Amid Government Measures and Statistical Effects**\nAccording to a new calculation by the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS), Austria's annual inflation rate is projected to decrease from 3.6% in 2025 to 2.2% in 2026. This forecast, presented by Economics Minister Wolfgang Hattmannsdorfer and Finance State Secretary Barbara Eibinger-Miedl, reflects a 'technical update' incorporating various measures that have taken effect or will take effect in 2026. These include the reduction of the electricity levy starting January 1, 2026 (contributing 0.12\u20130.16 percentage points), the Austria electricity tariff from Verbund starting in March, price reductions by EVN, and a new social tariff from April. The rent control measure is expected to reduce inflation by 0.13 percentage points, and the reduction in food VAT by 0.1\u20130.2 percentage points. A significant portion of the decline\u2014approximately 0.8 percentage points\u2014is attributed to the statistical effect of the energy aid phase-out in 2025 no longer being included in 2026's inflation calculation. The combined effect of these measures is projected to save an average household around 900 euros annually. The first official inflation data for January 2026, to be released on February 4, is expected to show a rate of 2.4\u20132.5%, down from 3.8% in December 2025. Officials from the Austrian government, including Hattmannsdorfer and Eibinger-Miedl, believe 2026 could be the 'year of the turnaround' and emphasize the need to maintain momentum in implementing further measures.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:01 PM\nSource:[Heute.at](https://www.heute.at/s/erste-berechnung-da-so-soll-inflation-heuer-sinken-120159536)\n\n**Market Lowers Inflation Forecast to 3.99% for 2026, Maintains Growth and Interest Rate Projections**\nThe market's forecast for Brazil's official inflation rate, the National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), has been revised downward from 4% to 3.99% for 2026, according to the weekly Focus report published by the Central Bank (BC) in Bras\u00edlia. The projection for 2027 remains unchanged at 3.8%, while inflation is expected to be 3.5% in both 2028 and 2029. The 2026 forecast is within the Central Bank's inflation target range of 3% \u00b11.5 percentage points (1.5% to 4.5%). The first official IPCA data for 2026 will be released on February 10 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), covering January's price changes. In December 2025, inflation rose to 0.33% due to increases in ride-hailing and airfare prices, contributing to a 4.26% annual rise in 2025. The benchmark interest rate (Selic), currently set at 15% per year by the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom), has not been adjusted for five consecutive meetings despite declining inflation and exchange rates. The Copom confirmed it will begin reducing rates in March if inflation remains under control. Market analysts expect the Selic to fall to 12.25% by the end of 2026, 10.5% in 2027, 10% in 2028, and 9.5% in 2029. The economy's growth forecast for 2026 and 2027 remains at 1.8%, with expectations of 2% growth in 2028 and 2029. In the third quarter of 2025, the economy grew 0.1%, indicating stability, following a 3.4% increase in 2024\u2014the fourth consecutive year of growth and the highest since 2021. The consolidated 2025 GDP data is scheduled for release on March 3. The dollar's projected exchange rate is R$5.50 for the end of 2026 and 2027.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:58 PM\nSource:[Jovem Pan \u2013 Esportes, entretenimento, not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos com credibilidade](https://jovempan.com.br/noticias/economia/mercado-reduz-previsao-da-inflacao-para-399-em-2026.html)\n\n**Market Lowers 2026 Inflation Expectation to 3.99% and Maintains 2027 Forecast**\nThe market's expectation for inflation in 2026, measured by the IPCA, decreased by 0.01 percentage point to 3.99%, according to the Central Bank's Focus survey released on February 2, 2026. For 2027, the inflation projection remains unchanged at 3.80%, still significantly above the official target center of 3% with a tolerance margin of \u00b11.5 percentage points. Analysts continue to expect the Selic rate to begin cutting in March, with a 0.5 percentage point reduction, bringing the rate from its current 15% to 12.25% by the end of 2026 and 10.50% by the end of 2027. GDP growth projections for both 2026 and 2027 remain steady at 1.80%. The exchange rate projection for the end of 2026 stayed unchanged for the 16th consecutive week at R$5.50. For 2027, the projection was slightly adjusted upward by 0.01 percentage point to R$5.50. In January 2026, the U.S. dollar depreciated by approximately 5.5% against the real, nearly half the 12.2% depreciation seen in all of 2025, when the dollar closed at R$5.47. In the previous month, the real recorded the second-largest appreciation against the dollar among 28 monitored currencies, according to the Elos Ayta report, with 22 of the 28 currencies also appreciating.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:29 PM\nSource:[Istoe dinheiro](https://istoedinheiro.com.br/mercado-expectativa-inflacao-em-2026-399)\n\n**Analysts Now Expect Inflation Below 4% This Year, Focus Survey Shows**\nAnalysts surveyed by the Central Bank revised their inflation forecast for 2026 downward to 3.99%, below the 4% threshold, according to the weekly Focus survey released by the Central Bank on February 2, 2026.

Millions of recipients will see higher payouts starting in March due to the annual pension indexation. The timing benefits some individuals, as March 1 falls on a Sunday, allowing those whose payment date is the 1st of the month to receive their increased benefits in February. This mirrors a prior situation in February 2026, when some received their payments on January 30 due to the first of the month falling on a Sunday. The final indexation rate remains pending, to be published by the Central Statistical Office on February 9, 2026. The adjustment is based on two factors: inflation for retirees, which was 4.2% (higher than the national average of 3.6%), and the real growth in average wages. The projected indexation rate for 2026 is approximately 5.08%, resulting in a gross increase of 95.45 z\u0142 for minimum pensions, though this is lower than previous years with double-digit inflation.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:47 AM\nSource:[Interia.pl - Biznes](https://biznes.interia.pl/emerytury/news-marcowa-waloryzacja-emerytur-niektorzy-dostana-wyzsze-swiadc,nId,22546096)\n\n**Inflation Slowed in January Amid Launch of New IPC, But Challenges Loom for February**\nThe inflation rate in January 2026 is expected to have slowed compared to December's 2.8%, according to private consulting firms. FIEL forecasts a 2.1% increase, Equilibra 2.2%, Analytica and EcoGo both 2.4%. This would mark the first intermonthly deceleration since May 2025, when inflation began rising from 1.5% toward nearly doubling. Despite this, the median forecast of 2.4% implies an annual inflation rate of 2.4%\u2014slightly higher than January 2025's 2.2%, indicating ongoing inflationary pressure. The new Consumer Price Index (IPC), launched by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (Indec) under Marco Lavagna, replaces the outdated 2004\u20132005 household expenditure survey with a 2017\u20132018 version, aiming for greater accuracy. While the new IPC would have slightly increased the 2025 inflation rate (32.2% vs. 31.5% under the old method), Equilibra and EcoGo confirm that January\u2019s inflation rate would be the same under both systems\u20142.4%\u2014a favorable outcome for the government. This suggests the new methodology did not trigger a spike in reported inflation. Key drivers in January included recreation (3.4% by EcoGo) and restaurants/hotels (3.8% by Equilibra), both affected by seasonal holiday demand, along with food prices rising 2.4% to 3.1%. In contrast, education and clothing saw minimal increases or even deflation (\u22121.6% for clothing, per Equilibra). The true test will come in March with February\u2019s inflation data, as the new IPC gives greater weight to energy tariffs\u2014already rising due to subsidy cuts starting January 16, including a 16% gas price hike effective February. The government hopes that any acceleration in energy costs will be offset by a potential slowdown in food inflation, which now has reduced weight in the new index.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:09 AM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/economia/inflacion/la-inflacion-bajo-en-enero-con-el-debut-del-nuevo-ipc-del-indec-2026220552)\n\n**South African Reserve Bank holds interest rates steady: Implications for the property market**\nThe South African Reserve Bank (SARB) held its policy rate unchanged at 6.75% during its February 1, 2026, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, citing balanced inflation risks and ongoing services inflation above 4%, despite goods inflation at 3% and core goods at 1.2%. Governor Lesetja Kganyago stated that while low goods inflation is supported by a stronger rand, services inflation remains a concern, and the MPC decided to maintain stability, with two members favoring a 25 basis point cut and four preferring a hold. Property industry leaders expressed mixed reactions: Adrian Goslett of REMAX Southern Africa welcomed the stability, noting it supports short-term market confidence, though many hoped for a rate cut to improve affordability. Samuel Seeff of Seeff Property Group called the decision 'hugely disappointing' and a 'missed opportunity,' arguing that domestic economic improvements\u2014such as lower unemployment and stronger growth signals\u2014justify a cut, especially since the current rate remains above pre-pandemic levels. He highlighted that transaction volumes in 2025 (18,302) are 26.5% lower than in 2021 (23,154), and emphasized that 4-5% sustained growth is needed to address unemployment, urging the SARB to act decisively by March 2026. Dr Andrew Golding of Pam Golding Property Group noted that while the decision was not what borrowers hoped for, market demand remains steady, with housing shortages in high-demand areas and signs of recovery in Gauteng, and investment demand for buy-to-rent properties is surging. Toni Anderson of Standard Bank observed that earlier rate cuts have already improved affordability and buyer sentiment, with increased home loan applications and stable pricing encouraging balanced market activity. She concluded that the current rate stability allows households time to adjust and supports a sustained recovery in select regions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 04:10 PM\nSource:[IOL](https://iol.co.za/business-report/economy/2026-02-01-south-african-reserve-bank-holds-interest-rates-steady-implications-for-the-property-market/)\n\n**Unions slam rate hold as food and power costs squeeze households**\nThe South African Reserve Bank (SARB) decided to hold the repo rate at 6.75%, despite widespread criticism from unions, as inflation remains elevated due to persistent food prices and anticipated electricity price hikes. Governor Lesetja Kganyago stated that inflation was trending within the MPC's expectations, with the annual rate at 3.2% and a December peak of 3.6%, which he described as temporary. The MPC maintained the rate, with two members supporting a 25 basis point cut and four favoring a hold. Kganyago cited a stronger rand, lower oil prices, and declining inflation expectations\u2014reaching record lows\u2014as supporting factors. However, unions strongly opposed the decision. Matthew Parks of Cosatu expressed disappointment, urging a 50 basis point cut to ease the burden on workers facing a 42.4% unemployment rate and 1% economic growth. Fedusa called the decision a 'slap in the face' to struggling households, noting that while financial stability is preserved, no relief is offered to those under economic strain. Mametlwe Sebei of Giwusa denounced the decision and the new 3% inflation target as 'economic sabotage,' arguing that inflation levels (3.6% in December, 3.2% for 2025) are well below the old target midpoint of 4.5% and thus justify a significant rate cut. Treasury economist Tertia Jacobs noted the decision was broadly expected, with a 50-50 split in arguments for a hold versus a cut, and projected the neutral rate may be reached by 2027 if current trends continue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:21 AM\nSource:[Times LIVE](https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/business/2026-01-31-unions-slam-rate-hold-as-food-and-power-costs-squeeze-households/)\n\n**South Africa's interest rates remain unchanged: What to expect in 2026?**\nSouth Africa's interest rates remain unchanged at 6.75% following the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) January 29, 2026, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, with the prime lending rate staying at 10.25%. Four MPC members voted to maintain the rate, while two supported a 25-basis-point cut. This decision followed a slight rise in December's headline Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) to 3.6% from November's 3.5%. SARB Governor Lesetja Kganyago suggested the December figure may represent the 'peak' and expressed optimism that inflation will ease through 2026. Analysts, including Nolan Wapenaar of Anchor Capital, project approximately three more 0.25% rate cuts by mid-2027, based on the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM), which anticipates a shift from a slightly restrictive to a neutral monetary policy stance. However, risks remain: services and food inflation exceed 4%, driven by a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and electricity price miscalculations by NERSA, which could lead to a R76 billion revenue shortfall. In 2025, inflation reached 3.2%, the lowest in 21 years. Investec economist Lara Hodes noted that inflation expectations have eased, with a projected 2026 inflation rate of 3.3%, down from 3.5%, though upside risks persist, particularly from electricity prices. Bradd Bendall of BetterBond anticipates further cuts, citing inflation within one percentage point of the 3% target and a stable rand.

The last data, released in November 2025, showed inflation at 3.4% year on year, comfortably within the Bank of Namibia's target band. The analysts note that although the pace of monetary easing will be cautious, current monetary conditions continue to support credit extension and economic activity, particularly as liquidity normalizes following the Eurobond redemption. The first repo rate announcement is scheduled for February 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 05:43 PM\nSource:[allAfrica](https://allafrica.com/stories/202601090422.html)\n\n**Namibia**\nNamibia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.10% in December 2025, marking a slight rise from November 2025's flat 0.00% growth, according to data updated on January 8, 2026. This minimal uptick signals a gentle month-over-month increase in consumer prices, indicating subtle economic shifts. The change, while restrained, suggests possible early signs of rising consumer demand or adjusting supply constraints as the country emerges from a period of price stabilization. Economists and market analysts are expected to monitor the CPI's underlying components for insights into the sectors driving the change. The modest increase may influence future fiscal and monetary policy decisions as Namibia navigates its economic trajectory in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 08:11 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2859553)\n\n**Namibia Holds Rates As South Africa's Policy Shift Limits Room to Cut**\nNamibia's central bank maintained its key interest rate at 6.50% on December 14, 2025, citing the need to preserve the one-to-one currency peg with the South African rand amid tightening policy conditions in South Africa. South Africa's adoption of a stricter 3% inflation target has increased pressure on Namibia to prioritize domestic price stability to safeguard the exchange-rate arrangement. The Bank of Namibia noted that South Africa\u2019s benchmark rate remains slightly higher, and narrowing the gap too quickly could trigger capital outflows and strain the peg. Despite easing inflation risks, the central bank held rates steady. The bank revised its 2025 economic growth forecast downward to 3% from 3.5%, citing weak performance in manufacturing and diamond mining. Inflation expectations were slightly revised down due to a firmer currency outlook and lower projected oil prices. The decision marked the final meeting under outgoing Governor Johannes!Gawaxab, whose successor has not yet been named, adding uncertainty to future monetary policy continuity. The case underscores how currency-pegged economies like Namibia face limited policy independence, with monetary decisions closely tied to South Africa\u2019s framework despite domestic economic headwinds. Diamond mining remains a structural vulnerability, and manufacturing has not yet emerged as a reliable growth driver. Policymakers are prioritizing monetary stability over short-term stimulus, even as growth slows and inflation pressures ease.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 14, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[allAfrica](https://allafrica.com/stories/202512140029.html)\n\n**Namibia central bank cuts repo rate to support weakening economy**\nNamibia's central bank, the Bank of Namibia, reduced its main interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.50% on October 15, 2025, citing a weakening domestic economy and well-contained inflation. This marks the first rate cut in three consecutive monetary policy meetings, during which the rate had remained unchanged. The move aims to support economic activity while preserving the currency peg between the Namibian dollar and the South African rand. Governor Johannes!Gawaxab stated that although the rate cut widens the gap with South Africa\u2019s 7% repo rate, the difference remains within levels where capital flows are expected to stay stable. Inflation rose slightly to 3.5% year-on-year in September from 3.2% in August. The central bank revised its inflation projections downward by 0.2 percentage points for 2025 (to 3.6%) and 2026 (to 4.0%), citing a revised outlook for lower oil prices. It maintained its GDP growth forecasts at 3.5% for 2025 and 3.9% for 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Zawya.com](https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/namibia-central-bank-cuts-repo-rate-to-support-weakening-economy-v371l6so)\n\n**Bank of Namibia Lowers Key Rate to 6.5% | Forex News 2025.10.15...**\nIn its October 2025 meeting, the Bank of Namibia reduced its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5%, aiming to support the domestic economy while maintaining the fixed currency peg between the Namibia Dollar and the South African Rand. The decision follows a slowdown in annual GDP growth, which declined to 1.6% in the second quarter of 2025\u2014down from 2.8% in the first quarter\u2014driven by weak performance in manufacturing, fishing, and agriculture. As a result, economic growth for 2025 is now projected to fall from 3.7% in 2024, with increasing downside risks. Despite this, inflation has remained under control, averaging 3.6% through the first eight months of 2025. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 have been revised downward by 0.2 percentage points to 3.6% and 4.0%, respectively, based on expectations of a stronger exchange rate and lower oil price forecasts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 10:02 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2776156)\n\n**Annual inflation comes in at 6.3% in May | Namibia Economist**\nThe Namibia Statistics Agency reported that the annual inflation rate rose to 6.3% in May 2023, up from 5.4% in May 2022.

NSA spokesperson Mirjam Shihepo said the figures show largely stable consumer prices across most regions, though local supply and demand variations exist. The central bank had projected August inflation at 3.6% and forecast 3.9% for September and 4.0% for October.
