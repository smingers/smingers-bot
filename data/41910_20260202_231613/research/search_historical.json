This is the second rate cut of the year and the lowest level since October 2022.\n\n2. **Recent Inflation Data:**\n   - September 2025: 3.5%\n   - August 2025: 3.2% (seven-month low)\n   - The September uptick was driven by a rebound in transport costs and higher prices for rent and utilities\n\n3. **Inflation Projections (revised downward by 0.2 percentage points):**\n   - 2025: 3.6%\n   - 2026: 4.0%\n\n4. **GDP Growth:**\n   - Q2 2025: 1.6% (post-pandemic low)\n   - Q2 2024: 3.3%\n   - Slowdown attributed to softer growth in manufacturing and agriculture sectors\n\n5. **Foreign Reserves:**\n   - End of September 2025: N$54.7 billion ($3.2 billion)\n   - July 2025: N$58.1 billion ($3.3 billion)\n   - The decline reflects higher imports, external debt payments, and a stronger exchange rate\n\n6. **Eurobond:** Namibia has a $750 million Eurobond maturing in October 2025.

The average rate for 2025 was 3.5 %. During 2025 the main disinflationary impulse came from food, where year-end inflation slowed to 2.6 %.\n\n1. 2026 headline-inflation forecasts  \n\u2022 Simonis Storm (local broker) still projects a \u201cslight uptick\u201d to an annual average of 3.6 \u2013 3.8 % in 2026.  \n\u2022 BoN, after its December-2025 Monetary Policy Committee meeting, cut its own 2026 forecast to 3.8 % from 4.0 % previously, citing stronger-than-expected exchange-rate gains and a softer oil-price assumption (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 TradingEconomics\u2019 econometric model, which foresees headline CPI of 3.2 % in 2027 and 2.7 % in 2028, is broadly consistent with an out-turn near the bottom of the 3.6 \u2013 3.8 % range in 2026.  \nConsensus therefore centres on 3.6 \u2013 3.8 %, i.e. the lower half of the target range.\n\n2. Key drivers in 2026\n\n2.1 Food and non-alcoholic beverages (\u224817 % of the basket)  \n\u2022 TradingEconomics projects food inflation to average about 4 % in Q1-2026 and 4.4 % in 2027 (TradingEconomics, Food Inflation page, accessed 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 The FAO/GIEWS country brief (6 Aug 2025) reports a recovery in 2025 cereal output after the 2024 drought, lower regional wholesale prices and an expected reduction in cereal import needs in the 2025/26 marketing year.  \n\u2022 The IPC expects the January-March 2026 lean season to be less acute than the previous year.  \nNet impact: temporary firmness in Q1 as households rely on markets, followed by renewed deceleration once the main harvest reaches markets in Q2. Food is likely to add only 0.1-0.2 percentage points (pp) to the 2026 headline rate and should remain a dampening rather than an amplifying force.\n\n2.2 Fuel, transport and administered energy prices (\u224814 %)  \nThe fuel outlook has changed noticeably since the earlier research cut-off:  \n\u2022 The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) recorded pump-price over-recoveries of 42-127 c/l in its January review (MME circular, mid-Dec 2025) and, after further over-recoveries in January, announced sizeable price cuts effective 4 February 2026: \u2013N$1.00/l for petrol and \u2013N$0.50/l for both diesel grades (The Brief, 1 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Using the rule-of-thumb that a N$1/l movement shifts headline CPI by roughly 0.15 pp, the February reduction should subtract around 0.15 pp from the 2026 average, all else equal.  \n\u2022 Whether this disinflation persists depends on crude-oil fundamentals and the currency. International prices have eased (petrol import parity at US$74/bbl in January versus US$77/bbl in December), but the BoN still lists oil volatility among the main upside risks.\n\n2.3 Exchange rate (imported-inflation channel)  \n\u2022 The Namibia dollar, pegged 1:1 to the South African rand, strengthened to USD/NAD 16.08 on 2 Feb 2026, up 14 % y/y (TradingEconomics, Currency page).  \n\u2022 TradingEconomics\u2019 model points to USD/NAD \u2248 15.6 by early 2027, suggesting a modest further appreciation over the forecast horizon.  \n\u2022 A stronger currency directly lowers import-parity prices of fuel, food and manufactured goods. BoN\u2019s downward revision to its CPI forecast in December explicitly attributes 0.2 pp of disinflation to the exchange rate (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025).  \nRisk: any reversal triggered by global risk-off sentiment or a widening South Africa\u2013Namibia interest-rate gap would rapidly feed back into pump prices and other imports.\n\n2.4 Housing, utilities and other core services  \n\u2022 The December CPI bulletin shows housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels contributing 1.1 pp to the 3.2 % headline figure (The Brief, 8 Jan 2026). Tariff adjustments in these largely administered components are expected to keep core inflation slightly above the headline again in 2026.  \n\u2022 Simonis Storm flags persistent pressures in municipal services, education and medical fees, though still within a range consistent with the target.\n\n3. Monetary-policy setting  \nBoN left the repo rate at 6.50 % in December and emphasised that its stance \u201cremains appropriate for safeguarding the one-to-one link\u201d with the rand while fostering domestic activity (Observer24, 4 Dec 2025). With inflation now forecast at 3.8 % and the South African Reserve Bank expected to begin a cautious easing cycle, local analysts (Simonis Storm) still anticipate two 25 bp cuts in 2026, taking the repo to 6.00 %. Room for easing is contingent on inflation behaving as described above and on the exchange rate staying firm; an unexpectedly weak rand would likely derail rate-cut plans.\n\n4. Synthesised 2026 CPI outlook  \nBaseline: headline CPI averages 3.6 % in 2026, the low end of the current consensus, reflecting three new pieces of information:  \n\u2022 January fuel over-recoveries and the confirmed N$1.00/N$0.50 pump-price cuts in February;  \n\u2022 BoN\u2019s lower 3.8 % forecast that already factors in currency strength;  \n\u2022 Continued soft food-price dynamics supported by better harvests and lower regional grain prices.  \n\nScenario analysis  \n\u2022 Upside: oil rebounds above US$90/bbl and/or USD/NAD weakens back above 18.0 \u2013 headline could move into the 4.5 % area.  \n\u2022 Downside: crude stabilises below US$80/bbl, rand strengthens to 15.0, and housing-tariff hikes stay modest \u2013 headline could slip towards 3.3 %.  \n\n5. Remaining information gaps  \nDespite the additional data, three notable gaps persist:  \n1. No item-level or sub-component CPI projections are publicly available; without them it is hard to quantify precisely the relative contributions of food, fuel, housing and services.  \n2. The February-2026 BoN MPC meeting has not yet taken place; an updated Inflation Report could further revise the bank\u2019s forecast and clarify the policy path.  \n3. Apart from TradingEconomics\u2019 generic model, there is no published consensus forecast for the USD/NAD exchange rate or for Brent crude through 2026, both critical for assessing imported inflation.  \n\nObtaining these inputs\u2014particularly BoN\u2019s post-February statement, any forward fuel-price modelling by the MME, and commercial-bank or IMF exchange-rate scenarios\u2014would allow a more granular and statistically robust projection.  \n\nIn conclusion, the latest evidence\u2014most notably the February pump-price cut and continuing currency strength\u2014tilts Namibia\u2019s 2026 inflation outlook modestly lower than previously thought, leaving the base case at 3.6 % with balanced but manageable risks stemming chiefly from oil and the exchange rate rather than from domestic food supply.</Agent_report>\n"
