**AskNews Articles:**
- **Simonis Storm prediction (January 9, 2026):** Forecasts 25bp rate cut in Q1 2026, contingent on inflation staying in target range. November 2025 inflation at 3.4%.
- **Bank of Namibia (December 14, 2025):** Held rates at 6.50%, maintaining rand peg. Revised 2025 growth to 3% from 3.5%. Inflation expectations "slightly revised down."
- **Bank of Namibia (October 15, 2025):** Cut rates 25bp to 6.50%. Revised inflation projections down by 0.2pp to 3.6% (2025) and 4.0% (2026).

**Expert Opinion Assessment:**
1. **Bank of Namibia (October 2025):** Most authoritative - projects 4.0% for 2026 (revised down from 4.2% in September)
2. **Simonis Storm (January 2026):** Private forecaster expecting continued stability within target range
3. **NSA data (December 2025):** Official statistics showing 3.2% actual, with 2025 average of 3.5%

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Sustained disinflationary trend:** Multiple sources confirm December 2025 at 3.2%, down from 3.4% (November), 3.6% (October), continuing from mid-2025 peak of 3.66%. This represents 7 consecutive months of decline or stability. Historical pattern with strong momentum.
2. **Bank of Namibia's revised 2026 forecast:** October 2025 revision to 4.0% (down 0.2pp) represents institutional view with direct policy implications. BoN has maintained accommodative stance (rate cuts) while projecting modest reacceleration.
3. **Structural anchors:** Currency peg to rand, BoN's inflation targeting framework, and South Africa's own disinflation (mentioned in context) provide institutional constraints limiting volatility.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Sectoral dynamics:** Food inflation decelerated sharply (2.6% vs 5.9% prior year), but housing/utilities accelerated (4.5% vs 4.1%). Housing has 28.4% weight vs food's 16.5%, suggesting mixed pressures.
2. **Base effects:** December 2025's 3.2% compares to December 2024's 3.4%, suggesting year-on-year comparisons are becoming slightly more favorable.
3. **Economic growth forecasts:** BoN projects 3.9% growth for 2026, up from revised 3% for 2025. Moderate growth typically supports modest inflation but not dramatic acceleration.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Q1 rate cut speculation:** Simonis Storm predicts 25bp cut in Q1 2026, but this is contingent and from single private source.
2. **Regional variations:** Zone differences (3.0-3.3%) are minimal and unlikely to significantly affect national March figure.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Current date: February 2, 2026
- Target: March 2026 annual inflation rate (year-on-year)
- Horizon: ~1 month for actual outcome; ~3 months until resolution

**If timeframe halved (mid-February 2026):**
Prediction would be more anchored to December 2025's 3.2% with minimal adjustment, as January data wouldn't yet be available. Distribution would narrow significantly (perhaps 10th-90th percentile: 3.0-4.0%).

**If timeframe doubled (May 2026):**
Uncertainty would increase substantially. More time allows for:
- Seasonal effects (harvest impacts, holiday spending cycles)
- Monetary policy transmission (if rate cut occurs)
- External shocks (rand volatility, commodity prices)
Distribution would widen (perhaps 10th-90th percentile: 2.5-5.5%).

**March-specific considerations:**
- March 2025 baseline unknown but likely similar to Q1 2025 average (~3.5-4.0% range based on 2025 average of 3.5%)
- Early calendar year typically shows post-holiday normalization
- No major seasonal price spikes expected in March for Namibia

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate Adjustment:**

My initial outside view centered on 4.0-4.5% based on BoN's October forecast. However, **three critical updates warrant downward revision:**

1. **December 2025 actual (3.2%) came in below expectations:** BoN had projected 3.6% for 2025 average, but December's 3.2% suggests the year closed softer than anticipated. If 2025 averaged 3.5% (per The Brief), December's 3.2% indicates continued deceleration.

2. **Momentum is clearly downward:** Seven consecutive months of decline/stability from June 2025's 3.66% to December's 3.2% represents persistent disinflationary pressure, not just noise.

3. **Sectoral composition favors continued moderation:** Food (16.5% weight) decelerated sharply to 2.6%. While housing (28.4% weight) accelerated to 4.5%, this is from a low base and unlikely to spike further in Q1.

**Key Insight:** BoN's 4.0% forecast for 2026 was made in October 2025, before December's 3.2% print was known. This suggests the forecast may be slightly high, particularly for early 2026 months like March.

**Revised Central Tendency:** 3.5-4.0% range, with median around 3.7%

**Upside Risks (pushing toward 4.5%+):**
- Rand depreciation affecting import prices
- Housing/utilities continuing to accelerate
- Base effects if March 2025 was particularly low
- Food price rebound from current low 2.6%

**Downside Risks (pushing toward 3.0% or below):**
- Continued momentum from December's 3.2%
- Weak domestic demand (EAN warns of limited job creation)
- Favorable base effects if March 2025 was elevated
- Further food price moderation

**Balance:** Current evidence suggests modest reacceleration from December's 3.2% toward BoN's 4.0% annual average target, but March being early in the year likely stays closer to recent actuals than full-year average.

## Probability Calibration

**Anchoring Logic:**
- December 2025 actual: 3.2%
- BoN 2026 forecast: 4.0%
- Historical 2012-2025 average: 4.81%
- 2025 average: 3.5%

**Distribution Shape:**
Given strong disinflationary momentum but institutional expectation of modest reacceleration, I model a right-skewed distribution centered around 3.6-3.8%.

**Percentile Reasoning:**

- **1st percentile (3.0):** Extreme downside - continued sharp disinflation, major demand shock. Below December's 3.2% would require significant deterioration.

- **5th percentile (3.2):** Inflation stays flat at December level, no reacceleration occurs.

- **10th percentile (3.3):** Minimal reacceleration, momentum continues downward.

- **20th percentile (3.5):** Modest uptick to 2025 average level, below BoN forecast.

- **40th percentile (3.7):** Central-low scenario, partial reacceleration toward 4.0% target.

- **60th percentile (3.9):** Central-high scenario, approaching BoN's 4.0% forecast.

- **80th percentile (4.3):** Modest overshoot of BoN forecast, sectoral pressures (housing) accelerate.

- **90th percentile (4.7):** Significant upside surprise, multiple adverse factors (rand weakness, food rebound).

- **95th percentile (5.2):** Major shock scenario, sharp reversal of disinflationary trend.

- **99th percentile (6.0):** Extreme upside - currency crisis, major supply shock, or structural break.

**Calibration Check:**
- Implied median: ~3.8%
- Implied mean: ~3.9% (slightly right-skewed)
- 10th-90th range: 3.3-4.7% (1.4pp spread, reasonable for 1-month ahead)
- 80% probability mass between 3.5-4.3% aligns with "modest reacceleration from 3.2% toward 4.0%" narrative

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Namibia annual inflation rate (%) for March 2026 per NSA/TradingEconomics

2. **Outside view:** Base rate 4.0-4.5% (expert forecasts) revised down to 3.5-4.0% given December 3.2% actual and sustained disinflationary momentum

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.8%; mean = 3.9%; aligns with "partial reacceleration from December's 3.2% toward BoN's 4.0% forecast but staying below due to early-year timing"

4. **Key evidence:**
   - December 2025 actual at 3.2%, below BoN expectations (factual, NSA data)
   - Seven-month disinflationary trend from 3.66% to 3.2% (factual, NSA data)
   - BoN October forecast of 4.0% for 2026 average (factual, BoN policy statement)
   - Food inflation decelerated to 2.6%, housing accelerated to 4.5% (factual, NSA bulletin)
   - 2025 average inflation 3.5%, below historical 4.81% (factual, NSA data)

5. **Blind-spot:** Sharp rand depreciation coupled with food price rebound could push March inflation to 5%+, making my forecast look too conservative. This would push outcome significantly upward (toward 80th-90th percentile range).
