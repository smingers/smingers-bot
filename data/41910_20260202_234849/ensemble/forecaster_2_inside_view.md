Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **FXEmpire/TradingEconomics (Dec 2025 data)**: Reports December 2025 annual inflation at 3.2%, down from 3.4% in November. Monthly CPI change +0.1%. Provides detailed category breakdowns. **Factual, reliable, recent (Jan 2026).**

2. **TheGlobalEconomy.com**: Shows December 2025 at 3.19% annual inflation, consistent with above. Historical average 4.81% (2012-2025). **Factual, corroborates primary source.**

3. **TheBrief.com.na (NSA official data)**: December 2025 headline at 3.2%, core at 3.4%, 2025 average 3.5%. Food inflation slowed to 2.6% from 5.9% YoY. Housing/utilities +4.5%. **Primary NSA source, highly reliable.**

4. **Observer24.com.na (Jan 29, 2026)**: Bank of Namibia forecasts GDP growth of 3.9% in 2026. Confirms December inflation at 3.2%. Notes global IMF projection of 3.3% growth in 2026. **Recent, includes expert forecasts.**

**Secondary/Contextual Sources:**
5. **AllAfrica (Jan 9, 2026)**: Simonis Storm predicts 25bp rate cut in Q1 2026 if inflation stays in target. November 2025 inflation was 3.4%. **Expert opinion, moderate reliability.**

6. **AllAfrica (Dec 14, 2025)**: Bank of Namibia held rates at 6.50%, revised 2025 growth down to 3%, inflation forecasts revised down to 3.6% (2025) and 4.0% (2026). **Official BoN projections, strong evidence.**

7. **Zawya/InstaForex (Oct 15, 2025)**: BoN cut rates to 6.50%, revised inflation projections to 3.6% (2025) and 4.0% (2026). **Official BoN forecast, strong evidence.**

**Note on Discrepancy:** The outside view stated December 2025 YoY ≈ 4.9%, but multiple primary sources (NSA official data) clearly show December 2025 at 3.2%. This is a significant factual correction that must anchor my analysis.

**Brazilian/Austrian/Polish articles:** Irrelevant to Namibia; discard.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **December 2025 actual: 3.2%** (NSA official, multiple independent confirmations). This is 1.7pp lower than the outside view's stated 4.9%, requiring major recalibration.
- **Bank of Namibia official 2026 forecast: 4.0%** (stated in Oct and Dec 2025 MPC statements). This is an institutional forecast with clear methodology.
- **Structural peg to South African rand**: Namibia's monetary policy closely tracks South Africa's. SA inflation moderating (3.6% in Dec 2025 per context).
- **Food inflation deceleration**: Dropped from 5.9% to 2.6% YoY, a major driver given 16.5% CPI weight.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Monthly momentum**: December showed only +0.1% MoM, suggesting subdued near-term pressure.
- **Core inflation at 3.4%**: Slightly above headline, but stable.
- **Housing/utilities acceleration**: Rose from 4.1% to 4.5%, offsetting some food deceleration. Has 28.4% CPI weight.
- **Transport reversal**: From -1.4% deflation to +2.0% inflation, driven by fuel prices.
- **BoN rate hold at 6.50%**: Suggests confidence inflation will remain controlled.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Simonis Storm rate cut prediction**: Speculative, depends on inflation staying in target.
- **Regional variations**: Minor (3.0%-3.3% across zones).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 59 days from today (Feb 2, 2026) to March 31, 2026, when March 2026 data is generated. Resolution occurs May 2, 2026 (when data is published, typically mid-April for prior month).

**Critical insight:** We need to predict the **annual inflation rate for March 2026**, which compares March 2026 prices to March 2025 prices. We have:
- December 2025: 3.2% YoY
- January 2026 data: Will be released ~Feb 12, 2026 (per sources)
- February 2026 data: Will be released ~Mar 12, 2026
- March 2026 data: Will be released ~Apr 15, 2026

**Only 1-2 months of new data** will emerge before the March outcome is determined. Historical volatility shows median MoM change in YoY rate of 0.10pp, 90th percentile of 0.35pp.

**If timeframe halved (30 days):** Would have even less new information; prediction would be tighter around current 3.2% level.

**If timeframe doubled (120 days):** Would span through May 2026, allowing 3-4 more monthly observations and seasonal effects (e.g., mid-year adjustments), warranting wider distribution.

## (d) Justification for Adjusted Prediction

**Critical correction:** The outside view baseline of 4.25%-4.75% was anchored to an incorrect December 2025 reading of ~4.9%. The actual December 2025 figure is **3.2%**, confirmed by NSA official data.

**Key factors shifting prediction downward from outside view:**

1. **Actual starting point 1.7pp lower than assumed**: December 2025 at 3.2%, not 4.9%. This is the single most important correction.

2. **BoN institutional forecast of 4.0% for 2026**: As a calendar-year average, this implies monthly readings likely ranging 3.5%-4.5% throughout 2026. March falls early in the year, so likely closer to current 3.2% than the 4.0% average.

3. **Disinflationary momentum in key categories**: Food (2.6% vs 5.9% prior year), which has 16.5% weight. This momentum typically persists 2-3 months.

4. **Base effects favorable for Q1 2026**: March 2025 likely had elevated prices (part of the 2025 average of 3.5%), so the YoY comparison for March 2026 benefits from easier comps.

5. **Stable currency and fuel prices**: Rand peg stable, no oil shock evident. Transport inflation at 2.0% is moderate.

**Offsetting upward factors:**
- Housing/utilities accelerating (4.5%, 28.4% weight)
- Services inflation at 4.0% (sticky)
- Potential electricity tariff increases (mentioned in context)

**Historical volatility check:** 2003-2024 data showed 90th percentile 12-month change of 2.1pp. From December 2025's 3.2%, this suggests March 2026 range of 1.1%-5.3% at 90% confidence. However, recent period (2020-2025) has been less volatile (σ ≈ 0.6pp), suggesting tighter range.

**Synthesis:** Given December's 3.2%, BoN's 4.0% 2026 forecast, subdued food inflation, and low month-to-month volatility, I expect March 2026 to be in the 3.0%-4.2% range (80% confidence), with tails extending to 2.5%-5.0% (90% confidence).

The outside view's 4.25%-4.75% center was reasonable given historical averages, but current conditions (lower starting point, institutional forecasts, disinflationary food dynamics) warrant centering around **3.5%-3.8%** instead.

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency:** 3.6% (median)
- Slightly above December's 3.2% due to:
  - Typical small upward drift (historical median MoM change +0.10pp over 3 months = +0.3pp)
  - Housing/utilities acceleration partially offsetting food deceleration
  - BoN's 4.0% 2026 forecast suggests modest upward trajectory

**Distribution shape:** Approximately normal with slight positive skew (upside risks from energy/housing exceed downside risks from further food deflation).

**Percentile construction:**
- Use σ ≈ 0.7pp (reflecting 2020-2025 lower volatility period)
- Apply 10% probability mass to tail events beyond ±2σ

P1:  2.0% (extreme downside: sharp food deflation, rand appreciation shock)
P5:  2.5% (significant further food/transport deflation)
P10: 2.8% (sustained disinflationary momentum)
P20: 3.1% (December level maintained, no acceleration)
P40: 3.4% (slight drift upward)
P60: 3.8% (modest acceleration toward BoN 4.0% target)
P80: 4.3% (housing/energy push inflation higher)
P90: 4.8% (fuel spike or rand weakness)
P95: 5.3% (combined energy/food shock)
P99: 6.5% (extreme upside: currency crisis or drought-driven food spike)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Namibia's annual (YoY) CPI inflation rate for March 2026, headline All Items, percentage.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Originally 4.25%-4.75%, but corrected to 3.2% (Dec 2025 actual) with BoN 2026 forecast of 4.0% average.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.6%; mean ≈ 3.7%. Aligns with BoN 4.0% 2026 forecast (March being early in year, slightly below annual average). Reasonable given December's 3.2% and modest upward drift.

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - December 2025 actual: 3.2% (NSA official)
   - BoN 2026 forecast: 4.0% average (institutional)
   - Food inflation decelerated to 2.6% from 5.9% (16.5% CPI weight)
   - Housing/utilities accelerated to 4.5% (28.4% weight, offsetting factor)
   - Historical 3-month volatility: ±0.3pp typical

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Electricity tariff shock or drought-driven food spike in Jan-Feb 2026 could push March reading to 5%+. Conversely, severe rand appreciation or oil crash could drive it below 2.5%. Most likely miss: underestimating housing/energy acceleration (upward miss to 4.5%-5.0%).
