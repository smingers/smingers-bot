Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Macrotrends Historical Data:**
- **Quality:** Reliable aggregator of historical inflation data
- **Date:** Covers 2003-2024 annual averages
- **Key Facts:** 2024: 4.24%, 2023: 5.88%, 2022: 6.08%, 2021: 3.62%
- **Limitation:** Annual averages only; no monthly granularity or forward projections

**NSA September 2025 Document:**
- **Quality:** Primary source (official statistics agency)
- **Date:** September 2025 data
- **Issue:** Extraction failed; only metadata and website navigation captured
- **Value:** Confirms NSA publishes monthly CPI bulletins but specific rates unavailable

**World Bank Open Data:**
- **Quality:** High-quality aggregator (IMF data)
- **Date:** Portal page only; no actual data extracted
- **Value:** Confirms data availability 2003-2024 but provides no usable numbers

**Agent Report:**
- **Quality:** Comprehensive search attempt with critical gap identification
- **Date:** Most recent crawl attempt
- **Key Findings:**
  - Bank of Namibia 2026 forecast: Two conflicting secondary sources cite either 4.0% (October 2025 MPC revision) or 4.5% (April 2025 revision)
  - IMF forecast: "around 4.5% over the medium term" (vague, from June 2025 Article IV)
  - Monthly data 2019-2025: Unavailable despite NSA publishing pattern
  - Primary BoN documents: Retrieved but unreadable in binary form
- **Expert Opinion Identification:** The BoN (central bank) and IMF are authoritative forecasters; their 4.0-4.5% range for 2026 represents credible expert consensus

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Namibia monthly inflation 2019-2025:** Most relevant but data unavailable. Would show seasonal patterns and volatility.

2. **Namibia annual inflation 2019-2024:** Available but masks monthly variation.
   - 2024: 4.24%
   - 2023: 5.88%
   - 2022: 6.08%
   - 2021: 3.62%
   - 2020: 2.21%
   - 2019: 3.72%

3. **Southern African peer countries (Botswana, South Africa):** Similar economic structures and monetary frameworks but different policy responses.

4. **Small open economies pegged to major currencies:** Namibia's dollar is pegged 1:1 to South African rand, making SA inflation highly relevant.

**Selected Reference Class:** Namibia annual inflation 2019-2024, supplemented by expert forecasts for 2026. This provides the most direct historical context while acknowledging we lack monthly granularity.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** March 2026 is approximately 13 months away (resolution in May 2026 when March data published).

**Historical Patterns:**
- Namibia's inflation has been relatively stable in the 3-6% range over recent years
- Post-COVID spike peaked in 2022 (6.08%) then declined
- 2024 showed continued moderation to 4.24%
- Trajectory suggests convergence toward 4-4.5% range

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Without monthly data, cannot identify specific March patterns
- Annual inflation is measured year-over-year, so March 2026 compares to March 2025 (unknown)

**External Factors:**
- Namibia's peg to South African rand means SA monetary policy heavily influences Namibian inflation
- Global commodity prices affect this resource-dependent economy
- Recent trend shows disinflation from 2022 peak

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction should center on expert forecasts (BoN 4.0-4.5%, IMF ~4.5%) as the most informed baseline. These institutions have:
- Access to comprehensive economic models
- Understanding of monetary policy transmission
- Knowledge of structural factors

Historical data supports this range:
- 2024 annual average was 4.24%, already in the forecast range
- The declining trend from 6.08% (2022) → 5.88% (2023) → 4.24% (2024) suggests stabilization
- Pre-COVID inflation (2019-2021) averaged 3.18%, suggesting 4-4.5% is moderately elevated but sustainable

**Risk Factors:**
- **Upside risks:** Commodity price shocks, rand depreciation, drought impacts on food prices, global inflation resurgence
- **Downside risks:** Economic slowdown reducing demand, successful monetary tightening, lower SA inflation spillover

**Uncertainty Considerations:**
- March 2026 is a single month; monthly volatility can deviate ±1-2% from annual averages
- 13-month forecast horizon introduces significant uncertainty
- Lack of recent monthly data (post-September 2025) limits precision
- Global economic conditions in 2026 remain uncertain

Outside view calibration:

The expert consensus of 4.0-4.5% for 2026 annual average provides a strong anchor. However, March 2026 specifically could deviate from the annual average due to:

1. **Monthly volatility:** Historical evidence from other countries shows individual months can vary ±1.5% from annual averages
2. **Seasonal effects:** Without Namibia-specific monthly data, I cannot adjust for March seasonality
3. **Forecast uncertainty:** 13-month horizon means substantial unforeseen developments possible

**Distribution Construction:**

- **Central tendency (50th percentile):** 4.3% (midpoint of expert range, slightly above 2024's 4.24%)
- **90% confidence interval:** Should span roughly 2.5% to 6.5%
  - Lower bound: Accounts for successful disinflation, economic slowdown
  - Upper bound: Accounts for external shocks, commodity spikes, rand weakness

**Percentile Reasoning:**
- 10th percentile (~2.8%): Aggressive disinflation scenario, below recent historical lows
- 20th percentile (~3.3%): Stronger-than-expected monetary policy impact
- 40th percentile (~4.0%): Lower end of expert forecast range
- 60th percentile (~4.6%): Upper end of expert forecast range
- 80th percentile (~5.5%): Moderate inflation acceleration from external shocks
- 90th percentile (~6.3%): Significant adverse developments (approaching 2022-2023 levels)

This distribution reflects:
- Strong weight on expert forecasts (40th-60th percentiles)
- Moderate uncertainty given 13-month horizon
- Slight positive skew (easier to have inflation surprises upward than downward given global uncertainties)
- Recognition that monthly readings can deviate from annual forecasts

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.8
Percentile 20: 3.3
Percentile 40: 4.0
Percentile 60: 4.6
Percentile 80: 5.5
Percentile 90: 6.3
