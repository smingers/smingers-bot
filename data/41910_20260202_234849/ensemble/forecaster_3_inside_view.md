Analysis:

1) Target variable / resolution
- Forecast the headline year-on-year CPI inflation rate (All Items) for Namibia for March 2026, as shown on TradingEconomics (or NSA CPI bulletin if needed), in percent.

2) (a) Source analysis (facts vs. opinions, quality, date)
- Fxempire (page dated Jan 2023 but contains Dec 2025 figures): Aggregator-style summary. Useful for the latest point estimate (Dec 2025 inflation 3.2%) and category weights, but the timestamp inconsistency reduces confidence in the “article” framing. Treat the Dec 2025 number as plausibly factual but corroborate with other sources.
- TheGlobalEconomy (Namibia inflation annual): Aggregates NSA data with a visible monthly time series through Dec 2025 (Dec 2025 3.19%). Generally decent for pulling recent official values; not a forecaster.
- The Brief (Jan 2026, Namibia inflation eases to 3.2% in Dec): Local reporting explicitly attributing to NSA CPI bulletin; high value for the Dec 2025 headline inflation and the decomposition (food slowing; housing/utilities firmer; transport positive). This is the best “near-now” factual read.
- Observer24 (Jan 29 2026): Mostly macro narrative; includes the factual Dec 2025 inflation (3.2%) and growth projections (BoN growth 2026 3.9%). Inflation content is not a forecast; just context.
- allAfrica (Jan 9 2026, Simonis Storm tax measures piece): Mentions analysts expecting a BoN cut conditional on inflation staying in target; this is an identifiable-expert conditional view, but not a direct inflation number forecast.
- allAfrica / Zawya / InstaForex writeups of BoN decisions (Oct–Dec 2025): Secondary reporting but consistent on key points: Namibia is constrained by the peg to the rand; BoN revised inflation projection for 2026 to ~4.0 (per Zawya/secondary reports). This is expert-institution guidance (moderate-to-strong weight).
- bne IntelliNews (Sep 12 2025): Reports Aug 2025 inflation 3.2 and mentions BoN baseline estimates (inflation averaging ~4.2 in 2026 in that reporting). Useful but older and somewhat inconsistent with the “4.0” figure elsewhere—suggests forecast uncertainty.
- Asknews items: Mostly irrelevant (Brazil/Austria/Poland/Argentina). Relevant: IOL pieces on South Africa rates/inflation, which matter because Namibia is pegged 1:1 to the rand; thus SA inflation/monetary stance transmits into Namibia (indirect but meaningful).

3) (b) Evidence analysis with weighting

Strong evidence (big directional weight)
- NSA-reported Dec 2025 inflation around 3.2 with a multi-month downtrend in late 2025 (The Brief; TheGlobalEconomy). This anchors the starting level heading into 2026.
- Structural constraint: Namibia’s currency peg to the South African rand + BoN explicitly prioritizing the peg (allAfrica Dec 2025 writeup). This keeps Namibian inflation from diverging too far from SA’s inflation regime over short horizons.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- BoN projections for 2026 inflation around 4.0 (Zawya/secondary reporting) and/or ~4.2 (bne IntelliNews reporting). Institutional forecast implies some re-acceleration from the ~3.2% end-2025 level, but those are annual-average type projections, not specifically March.
- Composition signals: food inflation slowed materially, while housing/utilities accelerated and transport turned positive (The Brief). Net effect suggests inflation is not collapsing; rather, it’s rotating across categories.

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
- Generic market commentary (InstaForex) without methodology.
- South Africa property-market articles: useful only insofar as they indicate SARB holding and expectations of easing inflation, but they are not direct Namibia CPI predictors.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-02. Target month: March 2026 (about 2 months until the month is complete; resolution by early May).
- Because the horizon is short, the distribution should be notably tighter than a 12–13 month-ahead forecast. If the timeframe were halved (forecasting, say, February 2026 instead of March), I’d tighten further around the latest realized value (near 3.2–3.5). If doubled (forecasting September 2026), I’d widen and move the center closer to BoN’s ~4.0-ish guidance, with more room for fuel/food/weather shocks.

5) (d) Justification (updating the outside view)
Outside-view base rate provided: median ~4.3 with 10–90 of ~2.8 to 6.3 (a “2026-ish” monthly forecast with long-horizon uncertainty).

Key inside-view updates pushing the March 2026 forecast LOWER than that outside-view median:
- Realized end-2025 inflation is materially below 4% (about 3.2%), and the late-2025 direction was easing. With only ~2 months to March close, it’s hard to get to ~4.3% without a sharp shock.
- South Africa’s inflation environment appears contained (Dec SA CPI ~3.6 per the IOL context), and Namibia’s peg limits large short-run divergence.

Key forces preventing me from moving TOO low:
- BoN’s 2026 projection around 4.0 (and another report around 4.2) suggests the central tendency for 2026 is higher than the 3.2 end-2025 print—i.e., some expected firming, plausibly via administered prices, utilities, transport/fuel, or base effects.
- Category mix in Dec 2025 shows housing/utilities accelerating and transport no longer in deflation, consistent with a gentle upward drift.

Net: I shift the median down from 4.3 to about 3.7 for March 2026, and I tighten the interval versus the long-horizon outside view, while keeping a meaningful right tail for fuel/food/weather or exchange-rate-linked shocks.

Probability calibration

- Trend continuation scenario (status quo): late-2025 easing continues; March prints around 3.4–3.8.
- Mild re-acceleration consistent with BoN 2026 guidance: March around 3.8–4.4.
- Upside shock scenario (fuel spike / administered tariffs / weather-related food): March 5.0+.
- Downside surprise (stronger rand pass-through + weak demand + favorable food): March near 2.5–3.0.

I set an implied median ≈3.7 and a mild positive skew (upside shocks more plausible than outright deflation on this horizon).

Checklist:
1. Target (≤20 words): Namibia headline CPI year-on-year inflation for March 2026 (percent) per TradingEconomics/NSA.
2. Outside view base rate: Median 4.3; 10–90 range 2.8 to 6.3.
3. Consistency check: Implied median = 3.7; implied mean ≈ 3.9; consistent with low current inflation + mild upside skew.
4. Key evidence (3–5 items):
   - Dec 2025 inflation about 3.2 (NSA via The Brief / TheGlobalEconomy).
   - Late-2025 disinflation trend (Oct–Dec downshift).
   - Peg to South African rand constrains divergence (BoN/allAfrica).
   - BoN 2026 inflation projection around 4.0 (secondary reports).
5. Blind spot: A sudden fuel/administered-price shock (or drought-driven food spike) could push March well above 5.
