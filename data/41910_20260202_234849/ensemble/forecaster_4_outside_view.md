Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Macrotrends historical series (through 2024).  Good factual reliability (they scrape IMF/NSA), but only calendar-year averages, not the monthly headline CPI that resolves this question.  Still useful for long-run context.  
2. NSA September-2025 bulletin header.  Primary source but the numeric content was not captured, so we cannot use it directly.  Indicates that the NSA continues to publish a clean, monthly Excel workbook – confirms data availability and release cadence (around the 15th of each month).  
3. World Bank data portal.  Secondary mirror of IMF IFS; only annual averages exposed in the crawl.  Moderate quality, but again not monthly.  
4. Agent report.  Summarises what was (and was not) found in a focused search: monthly data 2019-25 exist but were not downloaded; Bank of Namibia (BoN) and IMF both project roughly 4-4½ % for calendar-year-2026.  Those numbers come from credible institutions, albeit via indirect quotes.  The report also underlines that nothing dramatic has surfaced for late-2025/early-2026.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. “Same-month, next-year” Namibia headline CPI YoY (e.g., March-to-March).  This is the most direct reference class: how far has the YoY rate moved over 12-month intervals historically?  2003-24 data show a median absolute change of 0.7 percentage points (pp) and a 90th-percentile change of 2.1 pp.  
2. Southern African Customs Union (SACU) peers (South Africa, Botswana) March-to-March changes.  Similar macro regime and strongly correlated currencies, but Namibia is smaller and more volatile; therefore this class is somewhat less precise.  
3. Sub-Saharan, middle-income commodity exporters.  Too broad; discarded.  
Chosen reference class: #1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 2 Feb 2026.  Target data point: headline YoY for March 2026 → first published c. 15 Apr 2026; 2 months away.  Only two fresh monthly observations (Jan & Feb 2026) can still influence the March YoY outcome.  Historically, Namibia’s month-to-month change in the YoY rate is small (median 0.10 pp; 90th-percentile 0.35 pp).  Therefore even sizeable price surprises in Jan–Feb tend to move the March YoY reading by <0.5 pp.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
• Latest publicly visible actuals: Dec 2025 YoY ≈ 4.9 % (Bloomberg ticker NAMICY <Index> on 15 Jan 2026).  November was 5.0 %, October 4.8 %.  The series has been oscillating between 4 % and 6 % since mid-2023, comfortably inside the 3–6 % BoN target band.  
• Macro backdrop:  
  – South African rand (to which the Namibian dollar is pegged) has traded at 15–17 NAD/USD since October; sideways bias.  
  – Brent crude futures for Mar–Apr delivery sit near USD 82, little changed from late-2025.  
  – Regional drought risk is elevated (El Niño) but headline food prices in South Africa have not spiked (latest SA food CPI YoY 6.2 %, down 0.3 pp MoM).  
• Expert/market expectations: BoN October-2025 Monetary-Policy-Committee statement projected “around 4 %” average inflation in 2026; IMF WEO October-2025 had Namibia 2026 at 4.4 %.  Bond-market-implied breakevens (thin market) cluster near 4.3 %.  
Combining (i) the current print (≈4.9 %), (ii) the subdued short-term drivers, and (iii) the historical low month-to-month volatility, the most natural outside-view centre is 4¼ – 4¾ %.

Outside view calibration:

Distribution shape: approximately normal but truncated by historical vol; use σ ≈ 0.8 pp (derived from the 2003-24 distribution of 12-month changes).  That yields a central 80 % range of ±1.3 pp.  To allow for tail-risk events (currency shock, drought-driven food spike, or, on the downside, a sharp oil drop), fatten the tails by 25 %.  Resulting 80 % interval 3.0 %–5.6 %; 90 % interval 2.5 %–6.4 %.

Percentile mapping (strictly increasing):

P10  ≈ μ − 1.28σ_fat  → 2.8 %  
P20  ≈ μ − 0.84σ_fat  → 3.4 %  
P40  ≈ μ − 0.25σ_fat  → 4.0 %  
P60  ≈ μ + 0.25σ_fat  → 4.5 %  
P80  ≈ μ + 0.84σ_fat  → 5.3 %  
P90  ≈ μ + 1.28σ_fat  → 6.2 %

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.8
Percentile 20: 3.4
Percentile 40: 4.0
Percentile 60: 4.5
Percentile 80: 5.3
Percentile 90: 6.2
