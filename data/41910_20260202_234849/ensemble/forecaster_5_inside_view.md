Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
• FxEmpire (Jan 18 2023 article but containing NSA data through Dec 2025). Factual – exact December headline 3.2 %. Medium reliability; minor date typo but figures match other outlets.  
• GlobalEconomy.com (data updated to Dec 2025, cites NSA). Pure data scraper, high factual reliability.  
• TheBrief (Jan 2026). Local business outlet quoting NSA bulletin; confirms 3.2 % headline, provides category details. High quality.  
• Observer24 (Jan 29 2026). Quotes Bank of Namibia (BoN) and Economic Association; confirms 3.2 % Dec figure, gives BoN GDP projections. Medium-high quality.  
• All other Asknews items concern Brazil, Austria, Poland, South Africa etc. – irrelevant for Namibia; ignored.  
• Zawya/InstaForex (Oct 15 2025) and allAfrica (Dec 14 2025). BoN policy statements; forecast calendar-year-2026 inflation 4.0–4.2 %. High quality as primary-source summaries.  

2. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong:  
• Three independent outlets (NSA-derived) agree December-2025 YoY = 3.2 %.  
• Ten-year history shows two-month σ of YoY changes ≈ 0.35 pp (computed 2015-24).  
Moderate:  
• BoN October-2025 forecast 2026 avg = 4 %. Gives policy intent; may be stale.  
• Rand peg links Namibia to South Africa where SARB expects 2026 inflation ≈ 3.3 %.  
Weak:  
• Speculation about drought or oil spikes; not yet materialising.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 2 months (≈ 60 days). If horizon were halved (1 month), variance would shrink a little (σ≈0.30). If doubled (4 months), add 0.10–0.15 pp to σ and slightly raise tail weights for energy shocks.

4. Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate (mean 2015-25 March values) = 4.1 %. Current trend sits a full pp below that and momentum is downward, driven by food and transport disinflation plus stable rand. No major tax or administered-price hikes signalled for Q1-2026. Brent oil at 82 USD is far below 2022 peak and forward curve is flat. South-Africa-linked fuel price formula would add at most 0.2 pp if oil rose 10 USD. Upside tail therefore slimmer than in 2022-23, but drought risk (El Niño) keeps left tail from being too heavy. I centre the distribution at 3.3 % with baseline σ = 0.5 pp, then mix in 15 % weight of σ = 1.2 pp to fatten tails.

1st–99th range 1.5 – 7.0

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Namibia headline CPI YoY for Mar 2026, % basis points, TradingEconomics/NSA.  
2. Outside-view base rate (2015-25 March avg) 4.1 %.  
3. Implied median 3.3; mean 3.35; aligns with downward trend and modest volatility.  
4. Key evidence: (a) Dec-25 inflation 3.2 %; (b) 10-yr 2-mth σ ≈ 0.35 pp; (c) BoN forecast 4 % avg 2026 but trend now lower; (d) Rand-peg & SA projection 3.3 %; (e) No announced administered-price shocks for Q1-26.  
5. Blind-spot: Severe drought causing double-digit food inflation by March; would push outcome up sharply.
