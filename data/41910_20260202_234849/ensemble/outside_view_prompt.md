- **2022:** 6.08% (an increase of 2.46% from 2021)
- **2021:** 3.62% (an increase of 1.41% from 2020)

## Methodology Note:
The article notes that inflation is measured by the consumer price index, reflecting the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services. The Laspeyres formula is generally used for this calculation.

## Data Availability:
The source indicates that a full historical dataset covering 2003-2024 is available for download.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide Namibia monthly headline inflation rates 2019-2025 and any published forecasts for 2026; include Bank of Namibia and IMF projections
The material retrieved in the most-recent crawl still falls well short of what is required to answer the user’s request, which calls for a strictly numerical deliverable covering three components:

A.  The full Namibia headline-CPI (year-on-year) series for every month from January-2019 through December-2025 (84 observations).  
B.  A Bank of Namibia (BoN) forecast—point or range—for calendar-year-2026 average inflation.  
C.  An IMF forecast for Namibia’s 2026 average consumer-price inflation.

What the new search results contribute

1.  Monthly history (Component A) – still missing
    •  The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) “Inflation” landing page is reachable (nsa.org.na/inflation) but only displays narrative snippets; no embedded tables are present and no bulk CSV/Excel file is exposed in the HTML (source 1.2).  
    •  Past experience shows that the NSA posts a separate Excel workbook for each monthly CPI release, and the worksheet “NCPI_Main_Index_Headline_YoY” contains the required headline rate in a fixed cell. None of the current search results exposes these files, so the 84 monthly values remain unavailable.

2.  BoN 2026 forecast (Component B) – only secondary references
    •  A Reuters/ CNBC-Africa article (previous crawl) quoted the BoN as having “revised up its … forecast … for 2026 to 4.5 %” on 16-Apr-2025.  
    •  Finance-in-Africa (16-Oct-2025) cites a downward revision by the BoN MPC to “4 %” for 2026 (Finance in Africa, Oct 2025).  
    •  Two PDFs served from bon.com.na were fetched in binary form but rendered unreadable in the crawler (sources with GUIDs cbe629ce-… and 6a7078db-…). These are very likely the “Economic Outlook” or “Inflation Outlook” reports that carry the official forecast table, but without the ability to open them the exact figure (and its vintage) cannot be confirmed.  
    ⇒ We have two competing secondary-source numbers (4.5 % and 4.0 %) and no primary BoN document.

3.  IMF 2026 forecast (Component C) – still not numeric
    •  Ecofin Agency (17-Jun-2025) paraphrases the IMF Article IV staff report: “inflation is expected to average 4.1 % in 2025 and around 4.5 % over the medium term.” “Around 4.5 %” is not an acceptable point estimate.  
    •  No result exposes the 2026 entry of IMF WEO series “PCPIPCH” (Inflation, average consumer prices, percent change) in table form.

Gap assessment versus user specification

• Component A: 0 % filled – all 84 monthly rates still missing.  
• Component B: partially filled – only secondary evidence; conflicting figures (4 % vs 4.5 %); no primary BoN PDF opened.  
• Component C: 0 % filled – no discrete 2026 IMF value.

Therefore additional information IS required before a defensible answer can be produced.

Recommended retrieval steps

1.  Harvest the NSA Excel workbooks from January-2019 through December-2025 (the files follow a predictable URL pattern under https://nsa.org.na/wp-content/uploads/…) and extract the headline YoY rate from the worksheet “NCPI_Main_Index_Headline_YoY”. This will populate the required 84-row monthly series.

2.  Re-download the latest BoN “Inflation Outlook”, “Economic Outlook”, or Monetary Policy Committee statement dated Q4-2025 or later, open the PDF locally, and read the table usually headed “Inflation Forecast (annual average, %)” or similar to obtain the official 2026 figure and its publication date.

3.  Pull Namibia’s 2026 “PCPIPCH” value either via the IMF WEO online interface (Download CSV) or the public JSON API:
   https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/NA  
   This single call will return the 2026 forecast in machine-readable form.

Until those three retrieval operations succeed, the numerical table requested by the user cannot be delivered with the required accuracy and primary-source citations.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
