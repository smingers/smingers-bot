Analysis:
Namibia’s headline inflation has oscillated between roughly 4 % and 6 % during 2024-25, driven mainly by food, transport (fuel prices), and housing/utilities (electricity adjustments).  The Bank of Namibia has kept its policy rate closely aligned with the South African Reserve Bank’s repo rate to protect the currency peg to the rand and contain imported inflation.  To judge where March-2026 inflation will land, I need the most recent data points (Dec-2025 / Jan-2026 CPI releases), forward-looking statements by the Bank of Namibia, Ministry of Finance, and regional forecasters, plus external outlooks from IMF, World Bank, and commercial banks that cover Namibia.  Key risk factors to watch in news articles: 

• Fuel price trend and any scheduled hikes in administered fuel levies.  
• Food supply conditions in the wake of the 2024-25 El Niño drought and any import cost pressures.  
• Government budget (Feb 2026) and electricity tariff adjustments by NamPower/ERC.  
• Rand/N$ exchange-rate expectations and SARB monetary-policy trajectory.  

Current articles giving a January 2026 CPI print, central-bank commentary, or private-sector forecasts for 2026 headline inflation will be most useful for an inside-view estimate of the March figure.
