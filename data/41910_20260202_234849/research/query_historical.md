Analysis:
To anchor a forecast for Namibia’s March-2026 year-on-year CPI inflation, we first want a reliable outside-view baseline: 1) the level and volatility of Namibia’s headline inflation over the last 10-15 years, 2) its more recent trajectory through 2023-24-25 (especially January-2026 if available), 3) structural drivers (food, fuel, exchange-rate pass-through from the South African rand, administered prices), and 4) policy stance (South African Reserve Bank / Bank of Namibia repo linkage and fiscal conditions).  
Key historical context therefore includes:  
• Monthly YoY inflation data back to at least 2010 to see the normal range (typically 2 – 8 %).  
• The spike in 2022 (~7 %) and subsequent easing toward the 5 % area during 2023-24.  
• NSA or TradingEconomics releases for every month of 2025 to spot momentum entering 2026.  
• Any 2025Q4/2026Q1 forecasts from the Bank of Namibia, IMF Article IV, or private banks to gauge consensus expectations.  
Most of this can be sourced from TradingEconomics, NSA CPI bulletins, Bank of Namibia Monetary Policy Statements, IMF WEO October-2025 tables, and press coverage (Reuters, Bloomberg, The Namibian). That data will let us build a simple time-series model plus qualitative adjustment for fuel price outlook and the rand/N$ exchange rate.
