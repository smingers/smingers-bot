The Laspeyres formula is generally used for this calculation.\n\n## Data Availability:\nThe source indicates that a full historical dataset covering 2003-2024 is available for download.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article provides only historical annual inflation data through 2024 and does not contain forward-looking projections, expert opinions, or monthly breakdowns that would directly inform the March 2026 inflation forecast.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://nsa.org.na/document/national-core-inflation-rates-for-september-2025/\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be primarily the website header/navigation structure of the Namibia Statistics Agency website rather than the full article content about National Core Inflation rates for September 2025. The substantive inflation data that would typically be in such a report is not visible in the extracted text.\n\n### Key Information Retrieved:\n\n**Demographic Statistics (appears to be general background data, not specific to the inflation article):**\n- Total Population: 3,022,401\n- Male Population: 1,474,224 (48.77%)\n- Female Population: 1,548,177 (51.27%)\n- Young Children (0-14 Years): 37%\n- Working age Population (15-59 years): 56.1%\n- Urban Population: 49.5%\n- Rural Population: 50.5%\n- Number of Households: 756,339\n- Average Household size: 3.8\n\n**Document Details:**\n- Title references \"National Core Inflation rates for September 2025\"\n- Content source: Namibia Statistics Agency\n- File Type: xls (Excel spreadsheet)\n- Category: Namibia Consumer Price Index Bulletin (NCPI)\n\n**Note**: The actual inflation rate figures, analysis, and detailed statistics for September 2025 that would be expected in this bulletin are not present in the extracted content.

The content is fragmentary and consists primarily of navigation elements and metadata rather than substantive analytical content.\n\n### Key Information Extracted:\n\n**Data Source:**\n- The page references inflation data for Namibia from the International Financial Statistics database, International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n- License: CC BY-4.0\n\n**Data Coverage:**\n- The page indicates data availability from 2003-2024\n- The metric tracked is \"Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)\" for Namibia\n\n**Related Indicators Mentioned:**\n- Consumer price index (2010 = 100)\n- Wholesale price index (2010 = 100)\n- Various banking and financial sector indicators\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe extracted content does not contain:\n- Actual inflation values or statistics for any specific time periods\n- Analysis or commentary on Namibian inflation trends\n- Forward-looking projections or forecasts\n- Expert opinions or assessments\n\nThis appears to be a data portal landing page that would require interactive navigation to access the actual historical inflation figures for Namibia.

The full Namibia headline-CPI (year-on-year) series for every month from January-2019 through December-2025 (84 observations).  \nB.  A Bank of Namibia (BoN) forecast\u2014point or range\u2014for calendar-year-2026 average inflation.  \nC.  An IMF forecast for Namibia\u2019s 2026 average consumer-price inflation.\n\nWhat the new search results contribute\n\n1.  Monthly history (Component A) \u2013 still missing\n    \u2022  The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) \u201cInflation\u201d landing page is reachable (nsa.org.na/inflation) but only displays narrative snippets; no embedded tables are present and no bulk CSV/Excel file is exposed in the HTML (source 1.2).  \n    \u2022  Past experience shows that the NSA posts a separate Excel workbook for each monthly CPI release, and the worksheet \u201cNCPI_Main_Index_Headline_YoY\u201d contains the required headline rate in a fixed cell. None of the current search results exposes these files, so the 84 monthly values remain unavailable.\n\n2.  BoN 2026 forecast (Component B) \u2013 only secondary references\n    \u2022  A Reuters/ CNBC-Africa article (previous crawl) quoted the BoN as having \u201crevised up its \u2026 forecast \u2026 for 2026 to 4.5 %\u201d on 16-Apr-2025.  \n    \u2022  Finance-in-Africa (16-Oct-2025) cites a downward revision by the BoN MPC to \u201c4 %\u201d for 2026 (Finance in Africa, Oct 2025).  \n    \u2022  Two PDFs served from bon.com.na were fetched in binary form but rendered unreadable in the crawler (sources with GUIDs cbe629ce-\u2026 and 6a7078db-\u2026). These are very likely the \u201cEconomic Outlook\u201d or \u201cInflation Outlook\u201d reports that carry the official forecast table, but without the ability to open them the exact figure (and its vintage) cannot be confirmed.  \n    \u21d2 We have two competing secondary-source numbers (4.5 % and 4.0 %) and no primary BoN document.\n\n3.  IMF 2026 forecast (Component C) \u2013 still not numeric\n    \u2022  Ecofin Agency (17-Jun-2025) paraphrases the IMF Article IV staff report: \u201cinflation is expected to average 4.1 % in 2025 and around 4.5 % over the medium term.\u201d \u201cAround 4.5 %\u201d is not an acceptable point estimate.  \n    \u2022  No result exposes the 2026 entry of IMF WEO series \u201cPCPIPCH\u201d (Inflation, average consumer prices, percent change) in table form.\n\nGap assessment versus user specification\n\n\u2022 Component A: 0 % filled \u2013 all 84 monthly rates still missing.  \n\u2022 Component B: partially filled \u2013 only secondary evidence; conflicting figures (4 % vs 4.5 %); no primary BoN PDF opened.  \n\u2022 Component C: 0 % filled \u2013 no discrete 2026 IMF value.\n\nTherefore additional information IS required before a defensible answer can be produced.\n\nRecommended retrieval steps\n\n1.  Harvest the NSA Excel workbooks from January-2019 through December-2025 (the files follow a predictable URL pattern under https://nsa.org.na/wp-content/uploads/\u2026) and extract the headline YoY rate from the worksheet \u201cNCPI_Main_Index_Headline_YoY\u201d. This will populate the required 84-row monthly series.\n\n2.  Re-download the latest BoN \u201cInflation Outlook\u201d, \u201cEconomic Outlook\u201d, or Monetary Policy Committee statement dated Q4-2025 or later, open the PDF locally, and read the table usually headed \u201cInflation Forecast (annual average, %)\u201d or similar to obtain the official 2026 figure and its publication date.\n\n3.  Pull Namibia\u2019s 2026 \u201cPCPIPCH\u201d value either via the IMF WEO online interface (Download CSV) or the public JSON API:\n   https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/NA  \n   This single call will return the 2026 forecast in machine-readable form.\n\nUntil those three retrieval operations succeed, the numerical table requested by the user cannot be delivered with the required accuracy and primary-source citations.</Agent_report>\n"
