**AskNews Articles (Global/Regional)**
- Most articles cover Brazil, Austria, Poland, South Africa - NOT directly relevant
- **South Africa articles (Jan 30-Feb 1, 2026)**: SARB held rates at 6.75%, inflation at 3.6% in December, projected 3.3% for 2026
- **Namibia-specific articles**:

- Historical monthly average 0.39% (2011-2025)
- **Assessment**: Confirms recent data accuracy

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Official BoN projection of 3.8% average for 2026** (October 2025 MPC)
   - Direct institutional forecast from central bank
   - Multiple independent sources confirm
   - BoN has track record of reasonable accuracy
   - Weight: Very high for establishing central tendency

2. **December 2025 actual = 3.2% y/y, showing continued disinflation from 4.2% (2024)**
   - Hard data, not projection
   - Confirms downward trend momentum
   - Multiple sources verify (NSA, Observer24, Neweralive)
   - Weight: Very high for recent trajectory

3. **Housing inflation structural persistence at 4.5% (28.4% of basket)**
   - Identified by expert Almandro Jansen
   - Supply constraints cited as structural, not cyclical
   - Large CPI weight means significant impact
   - Government considering rent controls (adds uncertainty but confirms pressure)
   - Weight: High for upward pressure on headline

4. **Currency peg to South African Rand constrains policy independence**
   - Institutional/structural factor
   - South Africa holding rates, inflation at 3.6% (similar to Namibia)
   - BoN held rates Dec 2025 citing peg preservation
   - Weight: High for limiting divergence from SA trajectory

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

5. **Core inflation running above headline (3.7% vs 3.6% in October 2025)**
   - Suggests underlying price pressures
   - Services inflation at 4.0% vs goods at 3.4%
   - Jansen notes "gradual firming in underlying price pressures"
   - Weight: Moderate for sustaining inflation near 4%

6. **Recent monthly inflation very low: 0.10% (Dec), 0.02% (Nov)**
   - Short-term momentum indicator
   - Could be seasonal or temporary
   - Weight: Moderate for near-term path (Jan-Mar)

7. **Expected 25bp rate cut in Q1 2026 (60% probability per Simonis Storm)**
   - Would provide modest easing
   - Conditional on inflation remaining controlled
   - Weight: Moderate, small impact on 2-month horizon

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

8. **Food inflation eased to 2.6% (December 2025)**
   - Volatile component, can reverse quickly
   - Weight: Low for March prediction

9. **Global oil price outlook favorable (mentioned in BoN October statement)**
   - External factor with indirect transmission
   - Weight: Low for 2-month horizon

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: March 2026 is approximately 6-7 weeks away (resolution date May 2, 2026 allows for data release lag).

**March 2026 annual inflation** = year-over-year change from March 2025 to March 2026.

**Critical consideration**: We need March 2025 baseline. Working backwards:
- December 2025: 3.2% y/y
- If monthly inflation averaged ~0.3% from Jan-Mar 2025, March 2025 index was roughly 3 months behind December 2025
- Recent pattern shows deceleration, so March 2025 was likely in 3.5-4.0% range

**Trajectory scenarios**:

*If timeframe halved (March → mid-February)*:
- Less time for structural factors (housing) to accumulate
- Would rely more heavily on December-January momentum
- Prediction would be closer to December's 3.2%

*If timeframe doubled (March → June 2026)*:
- More time for BoN's 3.8% annual average to materialize
- Structural housing pressures have more impact
- Seasonal factors (mid-year adjustments) come into play
- Prediction would shift toward 3.8-4.0%

**March-specific considerations**:
- Q1 often sees municipal tariff adjustments (housing/utilities)
- Post-holiday period may see service price adjustments
- No major seasonal spikes expected (not harvest/planting season)

## (d) Justification and Distribution Shifts

**Base rate from outside view**: 2.2-4.8% range (10th-90th percentile), centered around 3.2%

**Adjustments based on inside view**:

1. **BoN's 3.8% annual average for 2026 is STRONG anchor**
   - If 2026 averages 3.8%, and December 2025 was 3.2%, early months must be higher to reach average
   - Simple math: If Jan-Mar average 3.9-4.1%, and Apr-Dec average 3.7%, annual average = 3.8%
   - **Shift**: Raises central tendency from 3.2% to 3.6-3.9%

2. **Housing structural pressure (4.5% inflation, 28.4% weight) persists**
   - Contributes ~1.3pp to headline inflation
   - Supply constraints not resolved in 2-month horizon
   - Rent control uncertainty may accelerate pre-emptive increases
   - **Shift**: Adds upward skew, reduces probability of sub-3% outcomes

3. **Recent monthly momentum (0.02%, 0.10%) suggests near-term stability**
   - If Jan-Feb continue at 0.1-0.2% monthly, limited index growth
   - But annual inflation depends on March 2025 base falling off
   - **Shift**: Modest, mainly narrows distribution around 3.5-4.0%

4. **South Africa parallel (3.6% December, 3.3% projected 2026) provides floor**
   - Currency peg means Namibia unlikely to diverge significantly
   - SA holding rates suggests regional inflation stability
   - **Shift**: Establishes 3.0% as probable floor (10th percentile)

5. **Core > headline and services inflation at 4.0% signal persistence**
   - Not a demand shock, but structural service-sector inflation
   - Harder to reverse quickly
   - **Shift**: Reduces tail risk of rapid disinflation, supports 3.5-4.0% range

**Synthesis**:
The outside view centered on 3.2% (December actual) is too low because:
- It doesn't account for BoN's explicit 3.8% average guidance
- March needs to be higher than December to reach that average
- Structural factors (housing, services) are persistent

However, extreme outcomes (>5% or <2.5%) are unlikely because:
- No evidence of demand-pull inflation or external shocks
- Currency peg and SA stability provide anchoring
- BoN has credible track record and tools

**Most likely range**: 3.4-4.2%, with central tendency around 3.7-3.8%

## Probability Calibration

**Central scenario (60% probability): 3.5-4.0%**
- BoN guidance materializes
- Housing inflation persists but doesn't accelerate
- Monthly inflation continues at 0.2-0.3%
- March 2025 base effect neutral

**Downside scenario (20% probability): 3.0-3.5%**
- December's disinflation momentum continues
- March 2025 had high inflation (4%+), creating favorable base effect
- Food/energy prices decline further
- Rand strengthens unexpectedly

**Upside scenario (20% probability): 4.0-4.5%**
- Municipal tariff hikes in Q1 larger than expected
- Rent control uncertainty triggers pre-emptive increases
- March 2025 base was low (3.0-3.5%)
- Currency weakens or imported inflation spike

**Tail risks (<5% each)**:
- Below 2.8%: Deflationary shock, economic collapse - inconsistent with all evidence
- Above 4.8%: Currency crisis, major external shock - no indicators present

**Percentile construction logic**:
- 1st-5th: Extreme downside, account for unknown unknowns (2.5-2.9%)
- 10th-20th: Optimistic disinflation scenario (3.0-3.3%)
- 40th: Below BoN guidance but plausible (3.5%)
- 60th: At/slightly above BoN guidance (3.8%)
- 80th-90th: Housing/service pressures dominate (4.1-4.4%)
- 95th-99th: Unexpected shocks (4.6-5.2%)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Namibia annual inflation rate (%) for March 2026, headline CPI year-over-year change per NSA/TradingEconomics

2. **Outside view base rate**: 3.2% (December 2025 actual), with historical stability in 3-4% range

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 3.7%; mean ≈ 3.75%; aligns with BoN 3.8% guidance and structural factors supporting 3.5-4.0% range

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BoN projects 3.8% average for 2026 (official, credible)
   - December 2025 actual 3.2%, down from 4.2% in 2024 (hard data)
   - Housing inflation 4.5% with 28.4% CPI weight, structural constraints (expert analysis, persistent)
   - Core inflation above headline at 3.7%, services at 4.0% (indicates underlying pressure)
   - SA inflation 3.6%, currency peg limits divergence (institutional constraint)

5. **Blind-spot**: March 2025 base effect unknown - if March 2025 was unusually high (4.5%+), could produce March 2026 reading of 3.0-3.2% even with stable monthly growth, making forecast look too high. Would push outcome DOWN.
