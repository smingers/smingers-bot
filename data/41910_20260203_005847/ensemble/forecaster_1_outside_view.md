Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Source 1: TheGlobalEconomy.com (Namibia inflation data)**
- **Quality**: High - appears to aggregate official data from Namibia Statistics Agency
- **Date**: Contains data through December 2025, very recent
- **Key facts**: 
  - Annual inflation (December 2025): 3.19%
  - Monthly inflation averaging 0.39% from 2011-2025
  - Historical range: -0.34% to 3.23% monthly
- **Assessment**: Reliable baseline data with no expert opinions, purely statistical

**Source 2: IJG Research (Namibia CPI October 2025)**
- **Quality**: Unable to assess - document corrupted
- **Assessment**: Disregard entirely

**Source 3: Economy.com (Namibia CPI)**
- **Quality**: Moderate - presents IMF data but limited scope
- **Date**: Data through July 2025 only
- **Key facts**: CPI = 202.95 (July 2025), monthly change 0.06%
- **Assessment**: Outdated and provides only index values, not inflation rates

**Source 4-6: PwC, Voice of Africa, KPMG**
- **Relevance**: Zero - these cover global M&A, South African inflation, and U.S. economy
- **Assessment**: Not applicable to Namibian inflation

**Agent Report: NSA CPI Analysis**
- **Quality**: Appears to confuse U.S. BLS data with Namibian NSA data
- **Critical error**: The entire report discusses U.S. CPI forecasts (Goldman Sachs, JPM, RSM projections of 2.5-3.6% for U.S. March 2026)
- **Useful elements**: None directly applicable to Namibia
- **Assessment**: Disregard U.S.-focused projections; however, the methodology of examining shelter, energy, and tariff effects could inform thinking about Namibian drivers

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Namibia's recent inflation history (2023-2025)**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Rationale: Most directly relevant; captures current monetary policy regime, economic structure
   - Data: Annual inflation of 3.19% (Dec 2025), previous year 4.2% (2024)

2. **Namibia's March-specific inflation patterns**
   - Suitability: MODERATE
   - Rationale: Seasonal patterns may exist in Namibian CPI
   - Limitation: Limited granular monthly data available

3. **Southern African peer countries (Botswana, South Africa)**
   - Suitability: LOW-MODERATE
   - Rationale: Similar economic structures, trade relationships
   - Note: South Africa projecting 3.8% for 2026, but Namibia has independent dynamics

**Selected reference class**: Namibia's recent inflation trajectory (2023-2025) with attention to the downward trend from 4.2% (2024) to 3.19% (Dec 2025).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: March 2026 is ~1.5 months from now (February 3, 2026)

**Historical patterns**:
- December 2025 to March 2026 represents Q1 transition
- Monthly inflation has been subdued: 0.08% (Dec), 0.02% (Nov), 0.51% (Oct), 0.05% (Sep)
- Average monthly inflation: 0.39% over 2011-2025 period
- Recent trend: Declining from 4.2% annual (2024) to 3.19% (Dec 2025)

**Trajectory calculation**:
If monthly inflation continues at recent average (~0.1-0.2% monthly for Nov-Dec), three additional months (Jan-Mar 2026) would add approximately 0.3-0.6% to the index. However, annual inflation is year-over-year, so we need to consider what drops off from March 2025.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors supporting continued moderate inflation (3-4% range)**:

1. **Established downward trend**: Namibia moved from 4.2% (2024) to 3.19% (Dec 2025), suggesting disinflationary momentum

2. **Recent monthly stability**: Nov-Dec 2025 showed very low monthly inflation (0.02%, 0.08%), indicating no immediate price pressures

3. **Regional context**: South Africa (major trading partner) projecting 3.8% for 2026, suggesting regional inflation environment remains moderate

4. **Historical volatility**: Namibian inflation has been relatively stable, with extreme outliers rare (historical range -0.34% to 3.23% monthly)

**Risks to consider**:

1. **Upside risks**:
   - Currency depreciation (USD exchange rate 16.29 in Jan 2026)
   - Imported inflation from trading partners
   - Food/energy price shocks
   - Seasonal Q1 price adjustments

2. **Downside risks**:
   - Continued disinflation momentum
   - Weak domestic demand
   - Base effects from March 2025

**Central tendency**: The most likely outcome is continuation of the current trajectory, placing March 2026 annual inflation between 2.8-3.5%, with 3.2% as a reasonable central estimate (slight uptick from December's 3.19% due to potential seasonal factors).

Outside view calibration:

Given the limited data and short timeframe, I need to account for:

1. **Measurement uncertainty**: CPI data can have revisions and measurement quirks
2. **Unknown seasonal patterns**: March-specific effects unclear
3. **External shocks**: Currency, commodity prices, regional spillovers
4. **Historical stability**: Namibia's inflation has been relatively predictable within 2-6% range in recent years

**Distribution shape considerations**:
- The question has bounds of -2% to 15%, but negative inflation seems highly unlikely given current trajectory
- Historical maximum monthly was 3.23%, suggesting extreme outcomes above 8-10% are improbable
- Recent stability suggests a relatively tight distribution around 3%

**90/10 confidence interval reasoning**:
- 10th percentile: Aggressive continued disinflation → ~2.2%
- 90th percentile: Unexpected price shock or currency crisis → ~4.8%

**Intermediate percentiles**:
- Should reflect gradual probability accumulation
- Steeper slope near central tendency (3-3.5%)
- Flatter tails to account for tail risks

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.2
Percentile 20: 2.6
Percentile 40: 3.0
Percentile 60: 3.4
Percentile 80: 4.0
Percentile 90: 4.8
