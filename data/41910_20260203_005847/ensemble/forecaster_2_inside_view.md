Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Namibian Sources:**

1. **Observer24 (Nov 2025)**: Simonis Storm analyst Almandro Jansen forecasts 2026 inflation trending toward 4%, with October 2025 at 3.6% y/y. **Strong credibility** - named expert from reputable financial firm with specific methodology. Factual data: Oct-2025 = 3.6%, Sep-2025 = 3.5%. Opinion: 60% probability of rate cut, upward inflation bias.

2. **Africa-Press (Jan 6, 2026)**: Bank of Namibia (BoN) projects 2026 annual average inflation at 3.8%, with lower second-half outlook due to stronger exchange rate and favorable oil prices. **Highest credibility** - official central bank forecast. Factual: 2026 average = 3.8% (official projection).

3. **Neweralive (Jan 13, 2026)**: December 2025 inflation = 3.2% y/y (down from 3.4% in Nov). Simonis Storm forecasts 2026 average at 3.6-3.8%. **High credibility** - recent official data plus expert opinion. Factual: Dec-2025 = 3.2%, full-year 2025 average = 3.5%.

4. **The Namibian - Housing (Jan 10, 2026)**: Housing inflation at 4.5% y/y in Dec-2025 (28.4% CPI weight). Jansen warns structural supply constraints will keep housing inflation elevated into 2026. **Strong evidence** - specific category data with expert analysis of persistent structural factors.

5. **The Namibian - Cost of Living (Jan 18, 2026)**: Confirms Dec-2025 headline = 3.2%. Food inflation lowest since 2020 at 2.6%. Core inflation above headline throughout 2025, indicating shift to services-driven inflation. **High credibility** - comprehensive recent data analysis.

**Regional Context:**

6. **AllAfrica - Tax Measures (Jan 9, 2026)**: Simonis Storm predicts 25bp rate cut in Q1-2026, contingent on inflation staying in target range. November 2025 inflation = 3.4% y/y. **Moderate credibility** - reinforces monetary policy expectations.

7. **InstaForex (Jan 8, 2026)**: December 2025 m/m CPI = +0.10% (vs. 0.00% in Nov). **Useful** - confirms minimal monthly price acceleration.

8. **Zawya/AllAfrica (Oct 15, 2025)**: BoN cut repo rate to 6.50%, revised 2026 inflation forecast down 0.2pp to 4.0%, citing lower oil prices and stronger exchange rate. **Important baseline** - shows central bank's October view before recent data.

9. **South African sources (Feb 2026)**: SARB held rates at 6.75%, SA inflation at 3.6% in Dec-2025. **Moderate relevance** - Namibia's 1:1 peg to rand means SA monetary policy constrains Namibian policy space.

**Non-Namibian sources**: Brazilian, Austrian, Polish inflation articles are irrelevant. Ignored.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **December 2025 actual = 3.2% y/y** (multiple sources confirm): This is the most recent anchor point, showing deceleration from 3.6% in October. Month-over-month was only +0.10%, indicating minimal price momentum entering 2026.

2. **Bank of Namibia official 2026 forecast = 3.8% average, with lower H2-2026**: The central bank has superior information access and models. Their downward revision in October (-0.2pp) and emphasis on "lower second half" suggests Q1-2026 will be at or slightly above 3.8%.

3. **Housing inflation structural persistence (4.5% y/y, 28.4% weight)**: Multiple expert sources (Jansen) emphasize supply constraints will keep this elevated. This is a large CPI component with demonstrated stickiness.

4. **Food inflation at multi-year low (2.6%)**: Structural downward pressure from this category, though it may normalize slightly.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Services inflation > goods inflation pattern**: Core at 3.7% vs. headline 3.2% in Dec-2025 indicates underlying price pressures in sticky categories. This typically persists for several months.

2. **Oil price outlook favorable**: BoN cited this for downward revision. However, oil is volatile and only moderately weighted in Namibian CPI.

3. **Rand stability**: NAD pegged 1:1 to ZAR. South African rates held steady, rand stable around 16.3/USD. This removes a major upside risk (currency depreciation).

4. **Monetary policy expectations**: Simonis Storm assigns 60% probability to 25bp cut. If realized in February MPC, this would signal central bank confidence in benign inflation, potentially anchoring expectations lower.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Seasonal patterns**: January-March typically sees back-to-school costs (education) but also post-holiday demand normalization. Historical March inflation shows no strong seasonal bias.

2. **Global inflation context**: Emerging markets averaging 7.2% is not directly relevant given Namibia's specific structural factors and currency peg.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction horizon**: 2 months from today (Feb 3, 2026) to March 2026 reference period.

The March 2026 CPI will be published around mid-April 2026, measuring price changes in the March reference period. With only 2 months of evolution from the last data point (Dec-2025 = 3.2%), there is limited time for major structural shifts.

**If timeframe halved (1 month → Feb-2026)**: Prediction would be very close to Dec-2025 actual (3.2%), likely 3.1-3.4% range, as one month rarely produces >0.3pp annual inflation changes absent shocks.

**If timeframe doubled (4 months → May-2026)**: Greater uncertainty. BoN's "lower second half" guidance suggests May could drift toward 3.5-3.8% as base effects from 2025's low food inflation fade. Range would widen to 2.8-4.5%.

## (d) Justification of Prediction Shift from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 3.3% (mean), with 10th-90th percentile range of 2.0-5.2%.

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Recent deceleration trend**: Dec-2025 at 3.2% vs. Oct-2025 at 3.6% shows -0.4pp movement in 2 months. This is faster disinflation than the outside view's +0.1pp drift assumed. **Moderate downward shift warranted** (-0.2pp to central estimate).

2. **BoN's lower H2-2026 guidance vs. 3.8% annual average**: If H2-2026 averages 3.5%, then H1-2026 likely averages ~4.0% to achieve 3.8% full-year. March is in H1 but early, suggesting 3.6-3.9% range. This is **higher than outside view**, warranting **upward shift** (+0.3pp).

3. **Housing structural persistence (4.5%, 28.4% weight)**: This component alone contributes ~1.3pp to headline. With supply constraints continuing, this floor effect is stronger than historical average. **Slight upward pressure** (+0.1pp).

4. **Food at multi-year low (2.6%)**: Mean reversion likely as base effects from 2025's favorable conditions fade. Food is ~17% of CPI, so normalization to 3.5% would add ~0.15pp to headline. **Slight upward pressure** (+0.15pp).

5. **Core > headline (3.7% vs. 3.2%)**: Services inflation stickiness suggests underlying momentum. **Slight upward bias** (+0.1pp).

**Net adjustment**: -0.2 +0.3 +0.1 +0.15 +0.1 = **+0.45pp** from outside view.

**Revised central estimate**: 3.3% + 0.45% = **3.75%**, rounded to **3.8%**.

**Uncertainty assessment**: 
- The BoN's official 2026 average forecast (3.8%) and Simonis Storm's range (3.6-3.8%) provide strong anchoring.
- However, the recent 3.2% print and deceleration trend introduce downside risk.
- Housing structural factors and services inflation introduce upside risk.
- With only 2 months to March, volatility is constrained but not eliminated.

**Tail risk considerations**:
- **Downside**: Continued food deflation, faster rand appreciation, aggressive rate cuts → could push toward 2.5-3.0%.
- **Upside**: Utility tariff shock, rand depreciation, oil spike → could push toward 4.5-5.0%.

Given the balance of expert forecasts clustering around 3.6-4.0% and strong structural factors (housing), I assess a **narrower distribution than outside view**, centered at 3.8%, with 80% confidence interval of 3.0-4.6%.

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency**: 3.8% (median and mode)

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed due to housing/services upside risks and limited downside given BoN's 3-6% target floor.

**Percentile reasoning**:

- **1st percentile (2.0)**: Extreme deflation scenario - rand surge, oil crash, demand collapse. Historically rare but possible.
- **5th percentile (2.5)**: Significant downside - food deflation accelerates, aggressive monetary easing, base effects. Below BoN comfort zone.
- **10th percentile (2.9)**: Modest downside - continued deceleration from Dec-2025 trend, stable external environment.
- **20th percentile (3.3)**: Lower bound of expert consensus - closer to recent 3.2% print with minimal drift.
- **40th percentile (3.6)**: Lower end of Simonis Storm forecast range, assumes deceleration continues mildly.
- **60th percentile (3.9)**: Upper end of Simonis Storm range, aligns with BoN's H1-2026 implied forecast.
- **80th percentile (4.4)**: Housing/services inflation stronger than expected, food normalization faster, modest rand weakness.
- **90th percentile (5.0)**: Upside surprise - utility tariff shock, oil spike, or rand depreciation.
- **95th percentile (5.5)**: Significant shock scenario - multiple adverse factors align.
- **99th percentile (6.8)**: Extreme upside - major currency crisis or supply shock. Near top of BoN target band.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Namibia annual inflation rate (% y/y change) for March 2026 per TradingEconomics/NSA CPI bulletin.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 3.3% mean, 2.0-5.2% (10th-90th percentile). Final prediction shifted +0.45pp to 3.8% median due to BoN official forecast, structural housing pressures, and expert consensus clustering at 3.6-4.0%.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 3.9%; mean ≈ 3.85%. This aligns with BoN's 3.8% annual average and Simonis Storm's 3.6-3.8% range, accounting for Q1 being slightly above full-year average per BoN's "lower H2" guidance.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BoN official 2026 forecast = 3.8% average (highest credibility)
   - Dec-2025 actual = 3.2%, showing deceleration (factual anchor)
   - Housing inflation = 4.5% (28.4% weight), structural persistence (expert consensus)
   - Simonis Storm expert range = 3.6-3.8% (named analyst, clear methodology)
   - Services > goods inflation pattern (core 3.7% vs. headline 3.2%)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Utility tariff shock in Jan-Feb 2026 (similar to SA's electricity pricing issues) combined with faster-than-expected food price normalization could push March inflation to 4.5-5.0%, making my 3.9% median look too conservative. This would push outcome **upward**. Conversely, if BoN cuts rates aggressively in February and rand strengthens further, sustained deceleration could produce 3.0-3.3%, making my forecast too high (**downward**).
