Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Source 1: TheGlobalEconomy.com (Namibia inflation data)**
- **Quality:** High - provides official data from Namibia Statistics Agency
- **Date:** Current through December 2025
- **Key Facts:** Annual inflation was 3.19% in December 2025; monthly inflation averaged 0.39% from 2011-2025; recent monthly readings (Aug-Dec 2025) ranged 0.02%-0.51%
- **Relevance:** Critical baseline - this is the most recent official Namibian inflation data

**Source 2: IJG Research PDF**
- **Quality:** Unusable - corrupted/unreadable text
- **Relevance:** None

**Source 3: Economy.com (Namibia CPI)**
- **Quality:** Medium - provides raw CPI index values
- **Date:** Through July 2025 only
- **Key Facts:** CPI = 202.95 (July 2025), base year 2010=100
- **Relevance:** Limited - outdated and lacks annual inflation rates

**Source 4: PwC Global M&A Trends**
- **Quality:** High for its domain, but irrelevant
- **Relevance:** None - focuses on global M&A, not Namibian inflation

**Source 5: Voice of Africa (South African inflation)**
- **Quality:** Medium - reputable source
- **Date:** December 15, 2025
- **Key Facts:** South Africa projects 3.8% inflation for 2026 (down from 4.2%); new 3% target adopted
- **Relevance:** Moderate - South Africa is Namibia's largest trading partner and both countries' currencies are pegged (Namibian dollar = South African rand), creating strong inflation correlation

**Source 6: KPMG U.S. Economic Compass**
- **Quality:** High for U.S. economy
- **Relevance:** None - U.S.-focused, no Namibian data

**Agent Report: NSA CPI Bulletins**
- **Quality:** Low relevance - focuses on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data
- **Critical Error:** The agent confused "NSA" (Namibia Statistics Agency) with "NSA" (Not Seasonally Adjusted) and retrieved U.S. CPI data instead of Namibian data
- **Useful Elements:** The U.S. projections (3.0% ± 0.4% for March 2026) are irrelevant to Namibia but demonstrate global inflation trends
- **Relevance:** Minimal - the entire report addresses the wrong country

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Namibia's own historical inflation (2018-2025)**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Namibia averaged ~4-5% annual inflation 2018-2023, dropped to 4.2% (2024) and 3.19% (Dec 2025)
   - Shows clear disinflationary trend in recent 12 months

2. **South African inflation trajectory**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Currency peg creates strong correlation
   - South Africa projecting 3.8% for 2026 (down from 4.2%)
   - Namibia typically tracks SA within 0.5-1.5 percentage points

3. **Sub-Saharan African inflation patterns**
   - Suitability: MEDIUM
   - Too broad - includes high-inflation economies (Nigeria, Ghana) and low-inflation ones (Botswana)
   - Less predictive than country-specific or SA-linked analysis

4. **Global disinflationary trend (2023-2026)**
   - Suitability: LOW
   - Developed economies targeting 2%, but Namibia's structural inflation differs
   - Limited direct applicability

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of (1) Namibia's recent trend and (2) South African projections, given the currency peg and economic integration.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** March 2026 is approximately 1 month from now (today is Feb 3, 2026)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Namibian inflation typically shows modest month-to-month changes (recent monthly changes: 0.02%-0.51%)
- Annual inflation (y-o-y) changes more gradually
- December 2025 to March 2026 represents a 3-month forward projection

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- March often sees post-summer price adjustments in Southern Hemisphere
- School year starts in January, potentially affecting certain categories
- No major seasonal spikes typically observed in Q1

**Recent Trajectory:**
- December 2025: 3.19% (annual)
- Trend: Declining from 4.2% (2024 average)
- Monthly inflation stable/low in recent months

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Key Factors Supporting Continued Disinflation:**

1. **Established Trend:** Namibia's annual inflation fell from 4.2% (2024) to 3.19% (Dec 2025), a decline of ~1 percentage point over 12 months

2. **South African Anchor:** SA projecting 3.8% for 2026 with active monetary tightening; Namibia typically follows within 0.5-1.5pp due to currency peg

3. **Short Timeframe:** Only 3 months from Dec 2025 to March 2026; annual inflation rates rarely shift dramatically in such short periods

4. **Monetary Stability:** No evidence of currency crisis, fiscal shocks, or supply disruptions in recent data

5. **Base Effects:** If monthly inflation continues at recent modest pace (0.05%-0.20%), annual rate should remain stable or decline slightly

**Risks to Consider:**

1. **Upside Risks:**
   - Food price shocks (drought, regional supply issues)
   - Fuel price increases
   - Currency depreciation vs. major trading partners
   - Administered price adjustments (utilities, transport)

2. **Downside Risks:**
   - Faster-than-expected disinflation in South Africa
   - Weak domestic demand
   - Favorable commodity prices

**Expected Central Tendency:**
Given the 3.19% reading in December 2025 and typical monthly changes of 0.02%-0.20%, March 2026 annual inflation should cluster around 2.8%-3.5%, with a central estimate near 3.0%-3.2%.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to December 2025 Baseline:**
- Starting point: 3.19% (Dec 2025)
- 3-month forward projection requires modest extrapolation

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central Tendency (40th-60th percentiles):**
   - Most likely range: 2.9%-3.4%
   - Reflects continuation of disinflationary trend with minor month-to-month variation
   - Aligned with SA's 3.8% projection (Namibia typically 0.4-0.8pp lower)

2. **Lower Tail (10th-20th percentiles):**
   - Aggressive disinflation scenario: 2.2%-2.7%
   - Would require: significant demand weakness, rapid SA disinflation, or favorable supply shocks
   - Historical volatility suggests this is possible but unlikely in 3 months

3. **Upper Tail (80th-90th percentiles):**
   - Inflation persistence/acceleration: 3.7%-4.5%
   - Would require: food/fuel shocks, currency pressure, or reversal of disinflation trend
   - Less likely given established trend, but not impossible

**Calibration Logic:**

- **10th percentile (2.3%):** Represents significant continued disinflation - about 0.9pp drop from Dec 2025. This would be unusually rapid but within historical bounds given the -1pp drop seen in 2025.

- **20th percentile (2.7%):** Moderate continued disinflation - about 0.5pp drop. More plausible given trend momentum.

- **40th percentile (3.0%):** Slight continued decline - the "soft landing" scenario where disinflation continues at reduced pace.

- **60th percentile (3.3%):** Near-stability - inflation holds close to Dec 2025 level with minor fluctuation.

- **80th percentile (3.8%):** Modest reacceleration - would align Namibia more closely with SA's 3.8% projection.

- **90th percentile (4.3%):** Significant reacceleration - represents upside risk from shocks, though still below 2024's 4.2% average.

**Unknown Unknowns:**
- Data revisions by NSA
- Unexpected regional shocks (political instability, weather events)
- Global commodity price swings
- Methodology changes in CPI calculation

The 90/10 range of 2.3%-4.3% (2.0pp spread) reflects meaningful uncertainty while staying tethered to the established disinflationary trend.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.3
Percentile 20: 2.7
Percentile 40: 3.0
Percentile 60: 3.3
Percentile 80: 3.8
Percentile 90: 4.3
