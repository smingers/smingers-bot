Analysis:

Target variable (resolution criteria)
- Headline “All Items” annual inflation rate (y/y, %) for March 2026 for Namibia, per TradingEconomics (or NSA CPI bulletin if needed).

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what is fact vs opinion)

1) Observer24 (Nov 11 2025) – “Namibians can expect slightly higher living costs next year”
- Quality: Medium. Secondary reporting; cites identifiable analyst (Simonis Storm) and provides recent inflation readings.
- Facts reported: Oct 2025 inflation 3.6% y/y; Sep 2025 3.5%; core 3.7; services 4.0; goods 3.4; BoN target 3%-6%.
- Opinions/forecasts: “2026 trending toward 4%”, upside risks (fuel, FX, housing tariffs, imported inflation).

2) Africa-Press (Jan 6 2026) – “Economic factors to watch out for in Namibia in 2026”
- Quality: Medium. Likely syndicated; key is attribution to BoN projection.
- Facts: “BoN projects inflation will average 3.8% in 2026”; expects lower inflation in 2H 2026 due to stronger exchange rate assumptions and favorable oil outlook.
- Opinion/interpretation: narrative framing; no month-specific forecast.

3) New Era Live (Jan 13 2026) – “Inflation expected to tick slightly higher”
- Quality: Medium-high for local reporting; cites identifiable firm (Simonis Storm) and gives specific recent data.
- Facts: Dec 2025 3.2% y/y; Nov 2025 3.4%; 2025 average 3.5%.
- Opinions/forecasts: 2026 average around 3.6%-3.8; services/housing sticky; expects gradual rate cuts.

4) The Namibian (Jan 10 2026) – housing/rental inflation
- Quality: Medium-high (reputable local outlet), strong for one key CPI component.
- Facts: Housing, water, electricity, gas category 4.5% y/y in Dec 2025; weight 28.4% of CPI.
- Expert opinion (Simonis Storm economist): housing/rent inflation likely to remain elevated into 2026 due to supply constraints; rent-control uncertainty.

5) The Namibian (Jan 18 2026) – “Namibia in Numbers” recap
- Quality: Medium-high; descriptive and consistent with other data.
- Facts: Food inflation ended 2025 at 2.6% (low); housing became the key pressure late-2025; transport moderate due to stable fuel + stronger rand; core above headline.
- Caveat: notes CPI basket is dated (structural measurement risk, but unlikely to change by March 2026).

6) allAfrica / Zawya (Oct–Dec 2025) on Bank of Namibia policy and projections
- Quality: High-medium (wire-style reporting; direct BoN statements).
- Facts: Oct 2025 BoN cut to 6.5%; BoN revised inflation projection for 2026 to about 4.0 in Oct 2025 statement; Dec 2025 held due to peg considerations.
- Implication: BoN sees inflation contained but not collapsing; policy constrained by South Africa/peg.

7) bne IntelliNews (Sep 12 2025)
- Quality: Medium-high; provides a useful “snapshot” of BoN near-term forecast path at the time.
- Facts: Aug 2025 inflation 3.2%; BoN projected 3.9 for Sep and 4.0 for Oct (as of that period); baseline estimates for averages (3.8 in 2025, 4.2 in 2026) were mentioned then.
- Note: those month-ahead projections were for 2025, not directly March 2026, but show BoN tendency to see inflation near ~4 at times.

8) AskNews articles
- Mostly irrelevant (Brazil/Austria/Poland/Argentina). These do not inform Namibia’s CPI for March 2026.
- Relevant adjacent item: South Africa rate-hold/inflation discussion (IOL, Jan 30/Feb 1 2026). Quality: Medium. Useful only insofar as Namibia’s peg links monetary/inflation dynamics to South Africa; suggests SA inflation around mid-3s and easing bias (but services sticky).

(b) Evidence analysis with weights (what moves the forecast)

Strong evidence (bigger shifts)
1) Namibia’s latest confirmed headline inflation: Dec 2025 = 3.2% y/y (New Era Live; consistent with other summaries).
- Strong because it’s near-term and directly on the target variable’s path (y/y headline CPI).

2) Structural persistence in housing (28.4% CPI weight; 4.5% y/y in Dec 2025) (The Namibian).
- Strong because of large basket weight + “stickiness” (rents/utilities) that typically doesn’t mean-revert quickly.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
3) BoN and Simonis Storm forecasts for 2026 average inflation around 3.6–4.0 (Africa-Press; Observer24; New Era Live; Zawya/allAfrica).
- Moderate because these are annual averages (not March point), but they anchor the plausible level regime for 2026.

4) Disinflationary/offsetting components: food inflation low (2.6% end-2025) and transport/fuel relatively stable with stronger rand (The Namibian).
- Moderate because these can materially move headline CPI, but are more volatile than housing.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
5) General regional/South Africa narratives (IOL) and various non-Namibia AskNews pieces.
- Weak because indirect; at best they affect the “macro backdrop” and exchange-rate/oil assumptions.

Net effect vs outside view:
- Outside-view baseline you provided centers ~3.0–3.3, reflecting late-2025 disinflation.
- Inside-view adjustment: I shift the distribution modestly upward (especially the median/upper middle) because multiple sources point to 2026 “near 4” on average and because housing (big weight) is running mid-4s and expected to persist. Offsetting that, food/transport looked soft, and BoN expects 2H 2026 to be lower, which argues against a big jump.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-03. Target month: March 2026 (about 1 month away). Resolution by 2026-05-02 (about 3 months away).
- If timeframe were halved (forecasting Feb 2026 instead of Mar): I’d hew closer to the known Dec 2025 print (3.2) with slightly narrower uncertainty (less time for shocks).
- If timeframe were doubled (forecasting May/Jun 2026): I’d widen the interval and put more weight on tariff/fuel/exchange-rate shocks and on the “2026 average ~3.8–4.0” guidance; upper tail would rise more.

(d) Justification (how the inside view shifts the base rate)
Starting point (outside view): central mass around low-3s, with 10–90 roughly 2.3–4.3.

Key updates:
1) “Regime anchor” from institutions/experts: BoN and Simonis Storm repeatedly place 2026 average inflation in the 3.6–4.0 neighborhood. March is a single month, but it’s unlikely to sit far below the year’s regime without a clear negative shock (not evident).
2) Sticky housing inflation: With housing at 28.4% weight and already 4.5% y/y in Dec 2025, headline inflation has a built-in floor unless food/transport deflate strongly.
3) Offsets: Food ended 2025 very low (2.6%) and transport was moderate with stable fuel and stronger rand. BoN narrative also suggests a favorable oil/FX outlook, especially later in 2026. These keep me from pushing the median up to ~4.0+.

So: modest upward shift in the median (toward mid-3s) plus a somewhat wider upper tail than the outside-view implied, because Namibia’s inflation has shown it can move to 5–6% in adverse commodity/Fx environments (e.g., recent history), even if not the base case.

Probability calibration

- Status quo / trend-continues scenario: inflation stays near Dec 2025 levels with slight firming from services/housing → ~3.4–3.7 for March 2026.
- “Low” scenario (downside): continued food disinflation + stable/declining fuel + firm rand → ~2.3–2.8.
- “High” scenario (upside): fuel/oil spike, rand/NAD weakness, administered tariff increases hitting early 2026, broader services passthrough → ~4.8–6.5.

Implied center:
- I’m targeting a median around 3.5–3.6 and a mean slightly higher (~3.6–3.7) due to a fatter upside tail (commodity/Fx risk).

Checklist:
1) Variable: Namibia headline CPI annual inflation (y/y, %) for March 2026.
2) Outside view base rate: central ~3.0–3.3; 10–90 ~2.3–4.3 (as provided).
3) Consistency: Implied median = 3.5; mean ≈ 3.7; consistent with “2026 near 4” guidance + downside offsets.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Dec 2025 headline inflation = 3.2 y/y (recent actual).
   - Housing component 4.5 y/y with 28.4% CPI weight; expected persistent.
   - BoN/Simonis Storm 2026 average inflation projections ~3.6–4.0.
   - Food inflation low and transport moderate (offsets).
5) Blind spot: A sharp fuel/oil spike or NAD/Rand depreciation would push March 2026 much higher than forecast.
