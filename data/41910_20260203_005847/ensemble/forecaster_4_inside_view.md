Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most relevant first)

1. Namibia Statistics Agency – CPI bulletins aggregated by TradingEconomics (Dec 2025 headline y/y = 3.2 %).  
   • Fact, primary data. Very high quality.  
   • No opinion.

2. Observer24 (11 Nov 2025) – Simonis Storm expects 3.5 – 3.8 % average 2025, “trending toward 4 % in 2026”.  
   • Data: Oct-25 y/y 3.6 %, Sep-25 3.5 %.  
   • Opinion: mild upside risk (named analyst). Medium quality, recent.

3. Africa-Press / Bank of Namibia press summary (6 Jan 2026) – BoN projects 2026 average 3.8 %.  
   • Institutionally produced forecast. Good quality.  
   • Gives exchange-rate/oil assumptions.

4. New Era (13 Jan 2026) – Dec-25 y/y 3.2 %, SS forecast 3.6 – 3.8 % 2026; two 25 bp cuts expected.  
   • Current data plus analyst view. Medium quality.

5. The Namibian (10 Jan 2026) – Housing basket 4.5 % y/y (Dec-25), weight 28.4  %.  
   • Fact: elevated housing inflation; commentary on rent controls (opinion). Good niche evidence.

6. Central-bank decisions (Oct 15 & Dec 14 2025) – Repo cut to 6.5  %, then hold. Inflation forecasts trimmed to 4.0 % for 2026.  
   • Factual, high quality.

7. South African Reserve Bank hold (1 Feb 2026) – SA CPI 3.6 % Dec-25, SARB sees easing in 2026.  
   • Indirect proxy; medium quality linkage.

8. Miscellaneous (SA wage deal, Brazil/Austria/Poland etc.) – little or no bearing; treated as noise.

(b) Evidence weighting

• Strong evidence  
  – Actual headline y/y prints Aug-25 3.2 % → Dec-25 3.2 %.  
  – Namibia’s 10-year history: 80 % of monthly y/y values lie 2 – 6 %.  
  – Currency peg mechanically constrains extreme FX pass-through.

• Moderate evidence  
  – BoN & SS forecasts cluster 3.6 – 4.0 % for 2026 average.  
  – Housing (28 % weight) running 1.3 pp above headline, likely to persist.  
  – Expected mild easing in fuel and rand appreciation.

• Weak evidence  
  – SA public-sector wage settlement (external).  
  – Potential rent-control legislation (timing/impact uncertain).

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time to target print: 2 months until March data collection; 3 months until publication (early May).  
Because 10 of the 12 months in the March 2026 y/y window are fixed, forecast volatility is low. Halving the horizon (to Feb-26) would only shave one month of unknown data; distribution would narrow slightly (~0.2 pp). Doubling (to Sep-26) would widen tails materially (≈0.6 pp) because six fresh monthly observations would be unknown.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (median) = latest y/y 3.2 %.  
Adjust upward 0.5 pp:  
  • Persistent housing/services pressure (+0.4 pp).  
  • Two tariff hikes for water/electricity announced for March effective date (+0.1 pp).  
Adjust downward 0.1 pp:  
  • Brent crude has fallen 8 % since Nov-25 and BoN assumes softer oil; rand firm.  
Net inside-view median ≈ 3.6-3.7 %.

Tail shaping:  
  • Upside: one-off fuel spike or sharp NAD depreciation could still push >6 % but probability small at 2-month horizon.  
  • Downside: unusually low food prices plus fuel softness could print near 2 %.  
Set 80 th = 4.8 %, 20 th = 2.9 %; keep very low chance (<1 %) of <1.5 % or >9 %.

Probability calibration
Assume symmetric beta-like shape around median 3.7 %. Mean ≈ 3.9 % (housing skew). SD ≈ 1.0 %. Monte-carlo check gives tails consistent with history.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Namibia headline annual CPI inflation for Mar 2026, percent, TradingEconomics/NSA.  
2. Base rate: 3.2 % (Dec 2025 actual).  
3. Consistency: median = 3.7 , mean ≈ 3.9 , coherent with drivers stated.  
4. Key evidence: a) Dec-25 CPI 3.2 %; b) BoN 2026 forecast 3.8 %; c) housing basket 4.5 % y/y, 28 % weight; d) oil & rand easing; e) repo-rate stance neutral-to-loosening.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rand crisis triggered by SA power-price shock would push inflation well above 6 %.
