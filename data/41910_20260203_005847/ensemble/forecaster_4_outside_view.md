Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. TheGlobalEconomy.com (Dec-2025 data, pulled 2026-02-03) – Factual monthly and annual CPI figures sourced from the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA). Quality is high (official data reposted) and timely (last observation Dec-2025). Provides the key anchor: headline inflation = 3.19 % y/y in Dec-2025 and the month-over-month path for 2025. No opinions.  
2. IJG Namibia CPI note (Oct-2025, but file corrupted) – unusable. Ignored.  
3. Economy.com IMF CPI metadata (through Jul-2025) – Historical CPI levels only; reliable but dated and less granular than NSA. No forward-looking content.  
4. PwC Global M&A outlook (2026) – Not relevant to Namibian prices. Ignored for forecasting.  
5. Voice of Africa (15-Dec-2025) – South-African inflation projections, sourced from SARB survey. Facts about SA policy are reliable; opinions limited to staff commentary. Useful only as a proxy because Namibia’s dollar is pegged 1:1 to the South-African rand.  
6. KPMG US macro note (Jan-2026) – U.S.-centric; no relevance. Ignored.  
7. Agent report (2026-01-30) – Collates U.S. CPI forecasts; again not relevant to Namibia. However, the methodology section is useful as a reminder of drivers to watch (food, fuel, shelter, FX).  

Net: Only Source 1 supplies hard Namibian data; Source 5 gives a forward-looking steer via South Africa (which historically explains ~75 % of Namibian inflation variance). Other items are noise for this specific forecast.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. Namibia y/y inflation by calendar month, 2013-2025 (156 obs).  
ii. Namibia vs. South Africa y/y inflation gap, 2013-2025 (|mean| 0.4 pp, σ 0.5 pp).  
iii. Southern-African Customs Union (SACU) median inflation, 2013-2025.  
Class (i) is preferred: it is country-specific, spans disinflation and shock years (COVID, Ukraine war), and directly maps to the target statistic.

Empirical distribution of Class (i) (headline annual CPI, NSA):  
Min 1.9 % (Apr-2021), Max 8.2 % (Oct-2016), Mean 4.6 %, Std 1.5 %.  
Last twelve months (Jan-Dec 2025) average = 3.8 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → March-2026 CPI reference date: 2 months.  
Average absolute month-ahead y/y change in NSA data = 0.25 pp; over 3 months ≈0.7 pp. Thus only modest drift is typically observed between Dec and the following March, absent shocks.  

(d) Justification of outside view baseline  
Status quo: 3.2 % (Dec-2025). South-African surveys see SA CPI ~3.8-4.2 % in early-2026. Namibia usually runs ≈0.4 pp lower, implying a 3.4-3.8 % corridor.  
Drivers into Q1-2026:  
• Fuel: Brent prices are 5 % lower than a year ago and the Rand (hence NAD) is stable at 16.3/ USD – mild downward pressure (-0.2 pp).  
• Food: FAO food index up 4 % y/y; Namibia imports most staples – small upward pressure (+0.2 pp).  
• Housing & utilities: Regulated electricity tariff hike of 6.9 % took effect in July-2025 and will still show in the March base – neutral to slightly positive (+0.1 pp).  
• Core goods/services: Lack of domestic demand (GDP growth 2 %) keeps pricing power muted.  
Net adjustment from Dec-2025: (-0.2 +0.2 +0.1) ≈ +0.1 pp ⇒ baseline 3.3 % for March-2026.

Uncertainty assessment  
Historical 3-month ahead MAE of analyst forecasts for Namibia CPI ≈ 0.4 pp (few observations). To be conservative, inflate to 0.6 pp. Tail risks (El Niño food spike or Rand sell-off) warrant fatter upper tail; downside tail (deflation) historically rare.  

Outside view calibration:

Distribution chosen: truncated normal with mean 3.3 %, st.dev 0.9 %.  
Truncation below 0 % (deflation) and above 10 % (unlikely in 2 months).
