Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

a. NSA / TradingEconomics time-series (Dec-25 headline CPI 3.19 %).  
   • Factual administrative data, released 12 Jan 2026. Very high reliability, no opinion.  
b. New Era (13 Jan 2026) & Observer24 (11 Nov 2025).  
   • Quote Simonis Storm and Bank of Namibia (BoN) forecasts of 3.6–4.0 % avg 2026. Reliable named experts; still opinion.  
c. Africa-Press (06 Jan 2026).  
   • BoN official forecast 3.8 % average 2026. Primary source, moderate strength.  
d. The Namibian (10 Jan 2026 & 18 Jan 2026).  
   • December basket detail; shows housing 4.5 %, food 2.6 %. High factual quality.  
e. allAfrica / Zawya (14 Dec 2025 & 15 Oct 2025).  
   • Monetary-policy decisions, BoN internal inflation path (2026 = 4.0 %). Factual minutes, high quality.  
f. South-Africa SARB coverage (30 Jan 2026).  
   • SA CPI 3.6 %, policy on hold. Good for regional context; indirect.  
No other Asknews items refer to Namibia; ignored.

2. Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Latest hard CPI print: 3.2 % YoY (Dec-25) and flat MoM price level.  
• Currency peg to rand; ZAR has been stable (NAD USD roughly 18.0–18.5 since Oct-25). This structurally damps import-price volatility.

Moderate evidence  
• BoN & Simonis Storm forecasting 3.6–4.0 % average 2026 (implies slight upward drift from 2025).  
• Housing basket (28 % weight) running 4.5 %, rents still rising.  
• South-African services inflation >4 %, spill-over risk.  
• Fuel prices trimmed 29 Jan 26 (–0.3 pp likely effect on headline).

Weak evidence  
• Prospective rent-control legislation (uncertain timing).  
• Weather-related food shocks (La Niña probability <20 %).  
• Sudden rand sell-off; currently calm FX markets.

Weighting summary: Strong 2, Moderate 4, Weak 3.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Today 03 Feb 2026; March-26 CPI will compare Mar-26 prices to Mar-25 prices and be released mid-Apr-26 (≈70 days). Only three monthly prints (Jan, Feb, Mar) remain unknown, limiting volatility. Historic 1-σ monthly change in YoY CPI ≈ 0.30 pp; therefore 90 % of outcomes lie ±1.0 pp from trend. If the horizon were doubled (to Sept-26) I would widen each tail by roughly +0.3 pp; if halved (to Feb-26) I would tighten by –0.2 pp.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (post-2020 regime) centred at 3.1 % with σ 0.6 pp.  
Adjustments:  
+0.2 pp  Persistent housing & services inflation (>4 %, large basket weight).  
–0.1 pp  Fuel price cut and softer global food indices.  
+0.2 pp  BoN/South-Africa policy bias to hold rather than cut (keeps real rates mildly negative).  
Net shift +0.3 pp → new mean 3.4 %.  
σ retained at 0.7 pp to reflect residual FX/commodity risks and measurement noise.  
Extreme tails widened slightly (1 st pct 1.5 %, 99 th pct 7 %) for “unknown unknowns”.

Probability calibration
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Implied distribution: Normal-ish with mean 3.4 %, SD ≈ 0.7 %.  
• 80 % central band 2.3 – 4.9 %.  
• Right tail fatter than left because upside shocks (currency, oil) historically larger than downside deflations.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Target: YoY CPI, Namibia, March 2026, percent.  
2. Outside-view centre 3.1 %; final mean 3.4 % – change justified above.  
3. Consistency: median 3.4, mean 3.4, aligns with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: Dec-25 CPI 3.2 %; housing 4.5 %; BoN avg-26 = 3.8 %; fuel cut Jan-26; stable ZAR.  
   All verified factual.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden 15 % rand depreciation after an Eskom crisis – would push outcome above 5 %.
