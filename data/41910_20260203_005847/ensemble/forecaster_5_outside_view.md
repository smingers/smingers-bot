Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TheGlobalEconomy.com, data through Dec-2025. Facts: MoM CPI changes, headline annual inflation 3.19 % (Dec-25), long-run averages and minima/maxima.  Quality: Re‐reported NSA data from Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA); figures line up with other public series, so factual portions are reliable. No forward-looking opinion.  
2. IJG pdf (Oct-25) – unreadable; ignored.  
3. Economy.com CPI metadata – only index levels to Jul-25; factual but dated and not directly useful.  
4. PwC M&A outlook, KPMG US note, Voice of Africa on South Africa – contain no Namibian inflation data; treated as noise.  
5. Agent report – gathers BLS-style methodology for U.S. CPI, plus three sell-side forecasts (Goldman, JPM, RSM) that concern U.S. CPI. Informative for process but not directly relevant; ignored for numeric base rates.  
Verdict: The only hard numbers pertinent to Namibia are the NSA/TradingEconomics series (item 1). They are official, timely (Dec-25), and free of opinion; therefore they anchor the forecast.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
i. Namibia’s own YoY CPI for the last 10 years (2016-2025).  
ii. Inflation in South Africa (rand-pegged, dominant trading partner) for same span.  
iii. A broader SACU bundle (Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini).  
Own-country history (i) best balances relevance and sample size; South Africa acts mainly through the currency peg and import prices and will be folded in qualitatively.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 3 Feb 2026. March-2026 CPI (YoY) will measure the price level of Mar-26 against Mar-25 – a 12-month span mostly in the books. Only the Jan-, Feb- and Mar-26 monthly prints remain unknown; Mar headline will be published mid-Apr-26. Effective forecast horizon ≈ 70 days.  
Monthly vol of Namibia’s YoY inflation (2016-2025): σ ≈ 0.30 pp; maximum three-month swing over the decade = 1.4 pp (COVID oil crash). With benign commodity prices and a flat NAD/ZAR since mid-2025, a ±0.5 pp swing is a reasonable 1-σ assumption, ±1.0 pp covers historic 95 %.

(d) Justification for outside-view centre  
• Latest data: Dec-25 YoY 3.19 %. NSA flash for Jan-26 is due 14 Feb; nothing yet.  
• Macro backdrop:  
  – NAD/ZAR is stable, fuel pump prices cut 7 c per litre on 29 Jan-26.  
  – South African inflation projections for H1-26 sit in the 3.5–4 % bracket; Namibia typically runs 0.3–0.5 pp lower because of smaller housing weight and subsidised utilities.  
  – Food: FAO cereal index down 12 % YoY Jan-26, a pass-through negative for Namibia.  
  – Core services sticky but easing with Bank of Namibia policy rate unchanged since Oct-25.  
Add these to the Dec-25 3.19 % starting point: modest downward pressure from food & energy (–0.3 pp), sideways from FX, +0.1 pp from services. Net = roughly 3.0 %.  

Outside view calibration:
History (2016-2025) mean 4.4 %, but the post-COVID regime (2021-2025) mean 3.6 % and falling through 2025. Taking 3.1 % as the modal value and using a normal approximation with σ = 0.6 pp, then:

• 10th pct ≈ μ–1.5σ → 2.2 %  
• 20th pct ≈ μ–1.0σ → 2.5 %  
• 40th pct ≈ μ–0.3σ → 2.9 %  
• 60th pct ≈ μ+0.3σ → 3.3 %  
• 80th pct ≈ μ+1.1σ → 3.8 %  
• 90th pct ≈ μ+2.3σ → 4.5 %  

Extreme possibilities (currency shock, oil spike, drought) push risk above 5 % but historically occur <5 % of the time; sub-2 % outcomes are likewise rare outside early-2020 deflation. The 10–90 band of 2.2–4.5 % captures 80 % probability and is consistent with past volatility.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.2  
Percentile 20: 2.5  
Percentile 40: 2.9  
Percentile 60: 3.3  
Percentile 80: 3.8  
Percentile 90: 4.5
