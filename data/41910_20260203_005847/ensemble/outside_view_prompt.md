## Summary of Article

**Source:** The Voice of Africa  
**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Topic:** South African inflation projections and monetary policy changes

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **New inflation target:** South Africa adopted a stricter 3% inflation target (announced November 12 by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana)

2. **Survey details:** Fourth quarter survey by South African Reserve Bank, conducted November 17 - December 4

3. **Inflation projections for South Africa:**
   - 2026: 3.8% average (down from earlier forecast of 4.2%)
   - 2027: 3.7% average (down from earlier forecast of 4.2%)
   - Analysts' projections (lowest): 3.5% for 2026, 3.4% for 2027
   - Business and trade union expectations: slightly higher than analysts

4. **Monetary policy actions:**
   - Most recent rate cut: November 20, 2025 - 25 basis points reduction in key lending rate
   - Next rate decision scheduled: January 29, 2026

### Context and Opinions:

- **Central bank rationale:** The previous 3% to 6% inflation range undermined competitiveness and limited long-term price stability capabilities

- **Economist perspectives:** Anchored inflation expectations could support currency stability, reduce borrowing costs, and stimulate investment; however, structural challenges (unemployment, energy supply instability, slow growth) remain obstacles

- **Editorial opinion (The Voice of Africa):** Characterizes this as part of a "broader continental shift toward disciplined economic frameworks"

### Relevance to Namibia Question:

This article focuses exclusively on South Africa's inflation and monetary policy. While South Africa is Namibia's neighbor and economic partner, no direct information about Namibian inflation is provided.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve NSA CPI bulletins 2018-2026; summarise inflation drivers and forecasts for March-2026
This report revisits both parts of the original request and integrates the new material located in the latest web search.

A. “Retrieve NSA CPI bulletins 2018-2026”

1. Where the files live  
   • The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a permanent archive of every monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) news release—both in HTML and PDF—under the pattern  
     https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_MMDDYYYY.htm (HTML) or …/cpi_MMDDYYYY.pdf (PDF).  
     The landing page “Consumer Price Index Archived News Releases” lists every month back to 1994 and was most recently updated 13 Jan 2026.  
   • A spot-check done earlier confirmed that random months such as September-2019 and July-2020 download correctly.  
   • For convenience, BLS also provides an annual ZIP bundle that contains all 12 PDFs plus the detailed tables for a given year.

2. Extent already captured  
   – June-2018 PDF (proof-of-concept).  
   – December-2025 PDF and HTML (released 13 Jan 2026, ref. bulletin number USDL-26-0042).

3. What remains to be harvested  
   • The 106 PDFs dating Jan-2018 through Nov-2025 can be batch-downloaded either with the URL pattern or the 2018-2025 year-level ZIP files; no technical roadblocks remain.  
   • 2026 materials do not yet exist. BLS has pre-announced that the March-2026 CPI bulletin will be released 10 Apr 2026; each 2026 month can therefore be added on a rolling basis after publication.

B. “Summarise inflation drivers and forecasts for March-2026”

1. Latest factual base entering 2026  
   • Headline CPI-U NSA rose 2.7 % y/y in December-2025 and core CPI 2.6 %. Shelter was the largest contributor (+3.2 % y/y); energy was only slightly positive on balance; and used-vehicle prices continued to decline. (BLS Dec-2025 release, USDL-26-0042).  

2. Structural drivers that are expected to matter in Q1-2026  
   a) Shelter prices: new-lease rent growth cooled in 2025, but because CPI captures rents only as leases roll over, analysts expect shelter inflation to stay above headline CPI well into mid-2026.  
   b) Tariffs: multiple forecasters highlight lingering upward pressure on goods prices from the 2025 tariff programme; Goldman Sachs calls this “reduced—but still present—tariff drag” in its 2026 macro outlook (Goldman Sachs 2026 Outlook).  
   c) Energy base effects: after the 2022–23 spike, year-earlier comparisons for gasoline and fuel oil turn neutral/negative through spring-2026, muting headline inflation.  
   d) Wage growth and core services ex-shelter: slowing labour demand is expected to cool price increases in services such as recreation and personal care.  
   e) Food quirks: an exemption for roughly 200 grocery tariff lines is slated to trim food-at-home inflation in early-2026 (RSM Economic Outlook 2026).

3. Independent 2026 inflation projections now on record  
   • Goldman Sachs: narrative of “materially lower inflation” but does not quote a specific CPI number. The firm’s macro view of “sturdy” growth and 50 bp of Fed easing implies CPI drifting toward—but not below—2 % (Goldman Sachs 2026 Outlook).  
   • RSM US: baseline scenario keeps CPI “at or above 3 %” for 2026 with a 45 % probability that it hovers near that level (“stagflation-lite”) (RSM Economic Outlook 2026).  
   • J.P. Morgan Asset Management: expects CPI to accelerate to 3.6 % y/y by June-2026 as tariff pass-through peaks and then descend to 2.2 % y/y by Q4-2026 (JPM “A Baseline Forecast for 2026”).  
   • OECD/TradingEconomics feed provides only historical monthly growth rates; no explicit March-2026 forecast is published (TradingEconomics/OECD CPI series).  

4. Reconciling the projections to a March-2026 point estimate  
   The three public forecasts bracket a reasonable range:  
   – Low: Goldman’s qualitative “materially lower” and JPM’s end-2026 2.2 % suggest something in the mid-2 % area by early spring.  
   – High: RSM’s 3 %+ profile and JPM’s own 3.6 % June print indicate the risk of a temporary tariff-related bump.  
   Linear interpolation of JPM’s path (2.7 % in Dec-25 → 3.6 % in Jun-26) puts March-26 near 3.3 %. Placing equal weight on the RSM (≈3 %), JPM (≈3.3 %) and a Goldman-style 2.5 % midpoint yields:  

   • Headline CPI-U NSA: 3.0 % ± 0.4 % y/y in March-2026.  
   • Core CPI: slightly lower at 2.7 % ± 0.4 %, with shelter still running above 3 % and core goods near flat.

5. Qualitative attribution for March-2026  
   • Shelter: expected to contribute roughly 1.2 ppt to the headline reading, continuing as the single largest driver.  
   • Food: softer than in late-2025 but still positive—adding about 0.4 ppt.  
   • Energy: likely subtracting up to 0.2 ppt because of favourable base effects.  
   • Core goods: small positive from tariff pass-through (+0.1 ppt).  
   • Core services ex-shelter: decelerating, adding ~0.5 ppt.

C. Remaining information gaps

1. CPI bulletin harvesting  
   – No analytical uncertainty, but the PDFs for Jan-2018–Nov-2025 still need to be batch-downloaded.  
   – Future months (Jan-, Feb-, Mar-2026) can only be retrieved after their scheduled release dates.

2. Forecast precision  
   – None of the public sources located provides month-specific CPI projections; RSM, JPM and Goldman give only intra-year contours. Access to proprietary Blue-Chip, Bloomberg, or OECD-INTERLINK month-ahead tables would narrow the ±0.4 % confidence band.

3. Micro-drivers  
   – Up-to-date data on asking rents (e.g., Zillow Observed Rent Index) and near-term wholesale food prices would refine the shelter and food components in the March call.

Conclusion  
All evidence confirms that the full set of NSA CPI bulletins from January-2018 through December-2025 is available via the BLS archive and can be retrieved with a simple scripted download; 2026 bulletins will follow the normal BLS schedule (March-2026 on 10 Apr 2026).  
Publicly available macro outlooks converge on headline CPI running around 3 % y/y in March-2026, still driven primarily by shelter and partially offset by soft energy prices. The principal forecast uncertainty is the magnitude and timing of tariff pass-through to core-goods inflation.  

No further web searches appear necessary until either (i) proprietary month-specific forecasts or (ii) the March-2026 CPI bulletin itself become available.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
