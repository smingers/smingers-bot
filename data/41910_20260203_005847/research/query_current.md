Analysis:
To estimate Namibia’s annual inflation rate for March 2026 I first need a clear picture of the most recent CPI prints (Dec 2025 / Jan 2026), the near-term policy stance of the Bank of Namibia, and any official or analyst forecasts that extend into Q1 2026.  Key pieces of information will include:  
• Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) monthly CPI releases for the last several months to gauge momentum and base effects versus March 2025.  
• Any updated inflation outlooks from the Bank of Namibia’s February 2026 Monetary Policy Statement and minutes.  
• Commentary or forecasts from private-sector analysts (e.g., Simonis Storm, PSG Namibia, local banks) and multilateral institutions (IMF Article IV, AfDB, World Bank) that might cite expected headline inflation figures through Q1 2026.  
• News coverage of supply-side pressures (fuel, food, housing) or policy changes (VAT tweaks, fuel-price deregulation, drought/El Niño impacts on food) that could influence March prices.  

The three searches below should surface:  
1) government / multilateral documents and forecast tables (Google),  
2) the freshest headline reporting of the latest CPI prints and BoN statements (Google News), and  
3) analyst notes or interviews giving explicit projections for inflation in early 2026 (AskNews).
