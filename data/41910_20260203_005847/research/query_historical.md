Analysis:
To estimate Namibia’s March-2026 year-on-year CPI inflation, I need a solid outside view built on recent inflation history, structural drivers, and policy context.  Key pieces of historical context include:
• The monthly headline YoY inflation series since at least 2018 to understand the typical range, seasonality (March often sees food-price pressures after the rainy season), and recent momentum.
• 2024–2025 macro developments: oil and transport costs (fuel price adjustments are government-administered), exchange-rate pass-through from the Namibia dollar’s peg to the South African rand, drought impacts on food prices, and administered electricity tariffs approved for 2025/26.
• Monetary policy stance of the Bank of Namibia and South African Reserve Bank (repo hikes in 2023–2024 and possible easing in late 2025) and fiscal measures (VAT changes, fuel-levy suspensions).
• Any NSA methodological changes to the CPI basket in 2023–2025.
Collecting monthly CPI prints through January 2026 and analyst commentary will allow fitting a simple time-series/structural model and framing plausible bounds.
