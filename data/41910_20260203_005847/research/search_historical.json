Where the files live  \n   \u2022 The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a permanent archive of every monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) news release\u2014both in HTML and PDF\u2014under the pattern  \n     https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_MMDDYYYY.htm (HTML) or \u2026/cpi_MMDDYYYY.pdf (PDF).  \n     The landing page \u201cConsumer Price Index Archived News Releases\u201d lists every month back to 1994 and was most recently updated 13 Jan 2026.  \n   \u2022 A spot-check done earlier confirmed that random months such as September-2019 and July-2020 download correctly.  \n   \u2022 For convenience, BLS also provides an annual ZIP bundle that contains all 12 PDFs plus the detailed tables for a given year.\n\n2. Extent already captured  \n   \u2013 June-2018 PDF (proof-of-concept).  \n   \u2013 December-2025 PDF and HTML (released 13 Jan 2026, ref. bulletin number USDL-26-0042).\n\n3. What remains to be harvested  \n   \u2022 The 106 PDFs dating Jan-2018 through Nov-2025 can be batch-downloaded either with the URL pattern or the 2018-2025 year-level ZIP files; no technical roadblocks remain.  \n   \u2022 2026 materials do not yet exist. BLS has pre-announced that the March-2026 CPI bulletin will be released 10 Apr 2026; each 2026 month can therefore be added on a rolling basis after publication.\n\nB. \u201cSummarise inflation drivers and forecasts for March-2026\u201d\n\n1. Latest factual base entering 2026  \n   \u2022 Headline CPI-U NSA rose 2.7 % y/y in December-2025 and core CPI 2.6 %. Shelter was the largest contributor (+3.2 % y/y); energy was only slightly positive on balance; and used-vehicle prices continued to decline. (BLS Dec-2025 release, USDL-26-0042).  \n\n2. Structural drivers that are expected to matter in Q1-2026  \n   a) Shelter prices: new-lease rent growth cooled in 2025, but because CPI captures rents only as leases roll over, analysts expect shelter inflation to stay above headline CPI well into mid-2026.  \n   b) Tariffs: multiple forecasters highlight lingering upward pressure on goods prices from the 2025 tariff programme; Goldman Sachs calls this \u201creduced\u2014but still present\u2014tariff drag\u201d in its 2026 macro outlook (Goldman Sachs 2026 Outlook).  \n   c) Energy base effects: after the 2022\u201323 spike, year-earlier comparisons for gasoline and fuel oil turn neutral/negative through spring-2026, muting headline inflation.  \n   d) Wage growth and core services ex-shelter: slowing labour demand is expected to cool price increases in services such as recreation and personal care.  \n   e) Food quirks: an exemption for roughly 200 grocery tariff lines is slated to trim food-at-home inflation in early-2026 (RSM Economic Outlook 2026).\n\n3. Independent 2026 inflation projections now on record  \n   \u2022 Goldman Sachs: narrative of \u201cmaterially lower inflation\u201d but does not quote a specific CPI number. The firm\u2019s macro view of \u201csturdy\u201d growth and 50 bp of Fed easing implies CPI drifting toward\u2014but not below\u20142 % (Goldman Sachs 2026 Outlook).  \n   \u2022 RSM US: baseline scenario keeps CPI \u201cat or above 3 %\u201d for 2026 with a 45 % probability that it hovers near that level (\u201cstagflation-lite\u201d) (RSM Economic Outlook 2026).  \n   \u2022 J.P. Morgan Asset Management: expects CPI to accelerate to 3.6 % y/y by June-2026 as tariff pass-through peaks and then descend to 2.2 % y/y by Q4-2026 (JPM \u201cA Baseline Forecast for 2026\u201d).  \n   \u2022 OECD/TradingEconomics feed provides only historical monthly growth rates; no explicit March-2026 forecast is published (TradingEconomics/OECD CPI series).  \n\n4. Reconciling the projections to a March-2026 point estimate  \n   The three public forecasts bracket a reasonable range:  \n   \u2013 Low: Goldman\u2019s qualitative \u201cmaterially lower\u201d and JPM\u2019s end-2026 2.2 % suggest something in the mid-2 % area by early spring.  \n   \u2013 High: RSM\u2019s 3 %+ profile and JPM\u2019s own 3.6 % June print indicate the risk of a temporary tariff-related bump.  \n   Linear interpolation of JPM\u2019s path (2.7 % in Dec-25 \u2192 3.6 % in Jun-26) puts March-26 near 3.3 %. Placing equal weight on the RSM (\u22483 %), JPM (\u22483.3 %) and a Goldman-style 2.5 % midpoint yields:  \n\n   \u2022 Headline CPI-U NSA: 3.0 % \u00b1 0.4 % y/y in March-2026.  \n   \u2022 Core CPI: slightly lower at 2.7 % \u00b1 0.4 %, with shelter still running above 3 % and core goods near flat.\n\n5. Qualitative attribution for March-2026  \n   \u2022 Shelter: expected to contribute roughly 1.2 ppt to the headline reading, continuing as the single largest driver.  \n   \u2022 Food: softer than in late-2025 but still positive\u2014adding about 0.4 ppt.  \n   \u2022 Energy: likely subtracting up to 0.2 ppt because of favourable base effects.  \n   \u2022 Core goods: small positive from tariff pass-through (+0.1 ppt).  \n   \u2022 Core services ex-shelter: decelerating, adding ~0.5 ppt.\n\nC. Remaining information gaps\n\n1. CPI bulletin harvesting  \n   \u2013 No analytical uncertainty, but the PDFs for Jan-2018\u2013Nov-2025 still need to be batch-downloaded.  \n   \u2013 Future months (Jan-, Feb-, Mar-2026) can only be retrieved after their scheduled release dates.\n\n2. Forecast precision  \n   \u2013 None of the public sources located provides month-specific CPI projections; RSM, JPM and Goldman give only intra-year contours. Access to proprietary Blue-Chip, Bloomberg, or OECD-INTERLINK month-ahead tables would narrow the \u00b10.4 % confidence band.\n\n3. Micro-drivers  \n   \u2013 Up-to-date data on asking rents (e.g., Zillow Observed Rent Index) and near-term wholesale food prices would refine the shelter and food components in the March call.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence confirms that the full set of NSA CPI bulletins from January-2018 through December-2025 is available via the BLS archive and can be retrieved with a simple scripted download; 2026 bulletins will follow the normal BLS schedule (March-2026 on 10 Apr 2026).  \nPublicly available macro outlooks converge on headline CPI running around 3 % y/y in March-2026, still driven primarily by shelter and partially offset by soft energy prices. The principal forecast uncertainty is the magnitude and timing of tariff pass-through to core-goods inflation.  \n\nNo further web searches appear necessary until either (i) proprietary month-specific forecasts or (ii) the March-2026 CPI bulletin itself become available.</Agent_report>\n"
