Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Rotten Tomatoes Pages (Multiple URLs)**
- **Date**: Accessed 2026-02-01
- **Quality**: Primary source - these are the actual RT pages, though the extractions appear incomplete (missing actual scores in some cases)
- **Key Facts**: The page for "Melania" exists but the extracted content doesn't show the Tomatometer score. However, other sources reference this score.
- **Reliability**: High for structural information (director, runtime, release date), but incomplete for the actual metric we need

**USA TODAY Article (Rotten Tomatoes Score)**
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Quality**: Major national newspaper, named journalist (Brian Truitt)
- **Key Facts**: States the film "opened at 8%" on Rotten Tomatoes
- **Expert Opinions**: Professional film critic gave ★½ out of four stars. Quotes from Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, The Daily Review, London Evening Standard, and The Atlantic provide additional critical context
- **Reliability**: High - this is a factual report of an observable metric with specific attribution

**USA TODAY Review**
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Quality**: Professional film criticism from major outlet
- **Key Facts**: Confirms theatrical release, PG rating, Brett Ratner director, Amazon MGM distribution
- **Expert Opinion**: Brian Truitt's critical assessment is professional but subjective
- **Reliability**: High for facts, moderate for predictive value of opinions

**Rolling Stone Article**
- **Date**: Published around 2026-01-25 (references Saturday screening and Thursday premiere)
- **Quality**: Major entertainment publication
- **Key Facts**: $40 million rights payment, premiere at Kennedy Center on Jan 29, 2026
- **Expert Opinion**: Don Fox (former ethics director) on conflicts of interest; multiple anonymous crew sources
- **Reliability**: High for financial facts, moderate for anonymous opinions

**Agent Report**
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Quality**: Aggregated research with specific citations
- **Key Facts**: States "11% critics / 99% verified audience" for Melania; $7 million opening weekend; CinemaScore "A"
- **Note**: This conflicts with USA TODAY's "8%" figure - the Agent Report may reflect an updated score after more reviews
- **Reliability**: Moderate to high, but shows score volatility

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Political documentaries (2020-2026)**: Limited data - only "All In: The Fight for Democracy" has complete scores (94% critics). "Stopping the Steal" has no scores despite 16+ months since release.

2. **Documentaries about controversial political figures**: This is highly relevant but data is sparse. The extreme polarization (11% critics vs 99% audience per Agent Report) is unprecedented.

3. **Brett Ratner films**: His last film "Hercules" (2014) had 58% on RT. However, narrative films differ significantly from documentaries.

4. **Amazon MGM documentary releases**: "All In" at 94% represents a very different ideological positioning. No comparable conservative personality documentary exists in their catalog.

5. **Documentaries with extreme critic-audience splits**: This appears most relevant. The film shows characteristics of review-bombing or audience self-selection, where motivated partisans drive audience scores while professional critics pan it.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Politically polarizing documentaries with theatrical releases, recognizing that this is a nearly unique case combining celebrity subject, major studio backing, and extreme partisan divide.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 12 days (from 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-13)

**Key Considerations:**
- The film released 2026-01-30, so by Feb 13 it will have been out for 14 days
- Rotten Tomatoes scores typically stabilize within 1-2 weeks for wide releases as the bulk of major critics weigh in
- For documentaries, the review window is often front-loaded around premiere/release
- The current score is either 8% (USA TODAY) or 11% (Agent Report), suggesting some movement has already occurred

**Historical Patterns:**
- RT scores for wide releases typically see 70-80% of final reviews within the first week
- Documentaries often receive fewer total reviews than narrative films
- Highly polarizing political content tends to attract reviews quickly from outlets across the spectrum
- Score movements of ±5-10 percentage points are common in the first 2 weeks, but dramatic swings (>20 points) are rare after initial reviews

## (d) Justification

The "Melania" documentary presents an unusual forecasting challenge due to extreme polarization and limited comparable precedents.

**Baseline from Current Information:**
- Current Tomatometer: 8% (USA TODAY, 1/30) to 11% (Agent Report, 2/1)
- This suggests the score is in the 8-11% range as of 2/1/26

**Factors Suggesting Score Will Stay Low (10-20% range):**
1. Overwhelming critical consensus is negative (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, The Atlantic, USA TODAY all panned it)
2. Professional critics across ideological spectrum found it propagandistic and lacking substance
3. Only London Evening Standard gave a moderately positive review (3/5)
4. Brett Ratner's first film in 12 years after harassment allegations may attract additional critical scrutiny
5. Documentary format typically invites assessment of journalistic rigor, which critics found lacking

**Factors That Could Push Score Higher (20-30% range):**
1. Conservative-leaning outlets or critics may publish positive reviews in coming days
2. Some critics may give credit for production values or access despite content criticisms
3. Contrarian takes sometimes emerge after initial consensus
4. 12 days allows time for additional reviews from smaller outlets

**Factors That Could Push Score Lower (Below 10%):**
1. Additional negative reviews from critics who see it after wide release
2. Current 8-11% already reflects major outlets; remaining reviews could skew negative
3. The "propaganda" characterization may discourage positive critical reassessment

**Most Likely Scenario:**
Given that major critics have already weighed in and established a strong negative consensus, and that RT scores typically stabilize rather than dramatically shift after the first week, the score will likely remain in the 8-15% range by February 13. The question is whether a few additional positive reviews from conservative outlets can push it toward 15-20%, or whether additional negative reviews keep it below 10%.

Outside view calibration:

The current score of 8-11% provides a strong anchor. Historical patterns suggest:

1. **Typical score volatility**: For wide releases in week 2, scores rarely move more than ±8 percentage points from their week-1 position
2. **Documentary review patterns**: Documentaries typically receive 20-60 critic reviews total on RT. With major outlets already published, remaining reviews will be from smaller outlets
3. **Political polarization effect**: The extreme audience score (99%) vs critic score (8-11%) gap suggests critics are evaluating on professional standards while audiences are ideologically motivated. This gap is unlikely to close on the critic side.
4. **Comparable cases**: While no perfect analog exists, politically controversial documentaries tend to have stable scores after initial critical mass of reviews

**Distribution Strategy:**
- **Central tendency**: 10-15% (most likely the score stays near current 8-11% or rises slightly with a few positive reviews)
- **Lower tail**: 5-9% (additional negative reviews or current score drifting down)
- **Upper tail**: 16-25% (unexpected positive reviews from conservative critics or contrarian takes)
- **Extreme upper tail**: 26-40% (would require major critical reassessment - very unlikely)

**Calibration Considerations:**
- The 10th percentile should reflect pessimistic scenario where score drops or stays at current low
- The 90th percentile should account for possibility of several positive reviews from outlets not yet published
- Given 12-day timeframe, dramatic movements (>15 points) are improbable but not impossible
- The question allows for outcomes below 10% and above 90%, but current evidence strongly suggests final score will be in 5-25% range
