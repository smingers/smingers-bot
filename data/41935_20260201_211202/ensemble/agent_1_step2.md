## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large prediction impact):**

1. **Multiple independent sources confirm current 10-11% score** (USA TODAY, AskNews aggregation, Fox News all report 10-11% as of Feb 1)
   - Direction: Anchors prediction strongly around 10-11% baseline
   - Mechanism: This is the actual current state of the metric we're forecasting

2. **Historical RT scoring patterns for wide releases**
   - After 2-3 days post-release, scores typically stabilize within ±5-8 percentage points
   - Documentaries receive fewer total reviews (20-60 typical) than narrative films
   - Direction: Suggests final score will be 5-19% range (10-11% ± 5-8 points)

3. **Overwhelming critical consensus is negative across ideological spectrum**
   - Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Guardian, Daily Beast, Deadline, Atlantic all panned it
   - Only London Evening Standard gave 3/5 stars (moderately positive)
   - Direction: Limited upside potential; unlikely to see major influx of positive reviews

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (Moderate prediction impact):**

1. **Score trajectory shows slight upward movement**
   - 6% (Jan 31 PM) → 10-11% (Feb 1) = +4-5 points in ~1 day
   - Direction: If trend continues at 1-2 points/day, could reach 15-20% by Feb 13
   - However: This likely reflects initial review clustering, not sustained trend

2. **Film withheld from major critics pre-release**
   - Suggests remaining reviews will come from smaller outlets, trade publications, conservative media
   - Direction: Could add some positive reviews (conservative outlets) but also additional negative ones
   - Conservative media reviews could push score to 15-20% range

3. **Extreme audience/critic split (99% vs 11%)**
   - Indicates strong partisan divide
   - Direction: Conservative critics may feel pressure to counterbalance, but professional critics maintain independence
   - Moderate upside potential from this factor

**WEAK EVIDENCE (Small adjustments):**

1. **Anecdotal screening attendance** (10 people in Brooklyn, 25 in LA)
   - Not directly relevant to RT score, though suggests limited cultural impact
   - Direction: Neutral to slightly negative (fewer screenings = fewer reviews)

2. **Brett Ratner's return after harassment allegations**
   - May attract additional critical scrutiny
   - Direction: Slight downward pressure, but already priced into current negative reviews

3. **$75M budget and Amazon backing**
   - Financial investment doesn't influence critical reception
   - Direction: Neutral for RT score prediction

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 12 days (Feb 1 → Feb 13, 2026)

The film released Jan 30, so by Feb 13 it will have been in theaters for 14 days total.

**Current State**: 10-11% Tomatometer as of Feb 1 (day 2-3 of release)

**If Timeframe Were Halved (6 days to Feb 7)**:
- Would predict tighter distribution around current 10-11%
- Less time for additional reviews to accumulate
- Would narrow 10th-90th percentile range to perhaps 8-16%
- Central estimate would stay at 11-13%

**If Timeframe Were Doubled (24 days to Feb 25)**:
- Would widen distribution to account for more review accumulation
- Potential for score to drift to 15-25% if conservative outlets publish positive reviews
- Or drift down to 6-8% if additional negative reviews dominate
- Would expand 10th-90th percentile range to perhaps 6-22%

**Key Temporal Factors**:
- Week 1 (Jan 30-Feb 6): Major critics publish → already mostly complete
- Week 2 (Feb 7-Feb 13): Smaller outlets, trade publications, possible conservative media reviews
- By Feb 13, likely 60-80% of total reviews will be published
- Remaining reviews after Feb 13 would come from very small outlets with minimal impact

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate**: 10-15% (based on current 10-11% score)

**Factors Supporting Score Staying in 10-15% Range**:

1. **Strong negative critical consensus already established** - When major outlets (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Guardian, Deadline, USA TODAY) all pan a film within 48 hours, subsequent reviews rarely overturn this consensus. The "propaganda" and "infomercial" characterizations are consistent across sources.

2. **RT scoring mechanics** - The Tomatometer is binary (fresh/rotten), not averaged. A review must be 6/10 or higher to count as "fresh." Current 10-11% means ~89-90% of reviews are below 6/10. To reach even 20%, would need 1 in 5 new reviews to be fresh.

3. **Documentary review patterns** - Political documentaries typically receive 25-50 reviews total. If current score is based on ~20 reviews (typical for day 2-3), and final total is ~40 reviews, the 20 remaining reviews would need to be 30%+ fresh to move score to 20%. Given critical consensus, this is unlikely.

**Factors Supporting Upward Movement to 15-20% Range**:

1. **Conservative media hasn't fully weighed in** - Outlets like Daily Wire, Breitbart (opinion pieces published but not formal reviews), National Review, Washington Examiner may publish positive reviews. If 3-5 of next 20 reviews are fresh, score could reach 15-18%.

2. **Score trajectory** - The 6% → 11% movement suggests some positive reviews are being added. If this continues at even half the rate (1 point per 2 days), score could reach 16-17% by Feb 13.

3. **Contrarian critical tendency** - Sometimes critics publish positive takes on widely-panned films to differentiate themselves. 1-2 such reviews could emerge.

**Factors Supporting Downward Movement to 6-10% Range**:

1. **Additional negative reviews** - Smaller outlets and international critics may publish reviews in coming days that maintain the negative consensus.

2. **Current score may be peak** - The 6% → 11% rise may reflect a temporary cluster of mixed-to-positive reviews that won't be sustained.

**Most Likely Scenario**:

The score will end in the 10-18% range, with central tendency around 12-14%. This reflects:
- Current 10-11% baseline
- Modest upward drift from a few positive reviews (conservative outlets, contrarian takes)
- Continued negative reviews maintaining overall "rotten" consensus
- Typical RT score stabilization patterns for wide releases

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **10th percentile (7%)**: Pessimistic scenario where score drifts down as additional negative reviews outweigh any positive ones
- **Median (13%)**: Score rises modestly from current 11% as a few fresh reviews are added
- **90th percentile (22%)**: Optimistic scenario where several conservative outlets publish positive reviews

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) because:
- Downside is limited by current 10-11% floor and unlikely to drop below 6-7%
- Upside has more room if conservative media rallies with positive reviews
- But extreme upside (>25%) is highly improbable given established critical consensus

## Probability Calibration

**Current Anchor**: 10-11% Tomatometer as of Feb 1, 2026

**Key Calibration Considerations**:

1. **Base rate from current state**: The score is already established at 10-11%. This is not a prediction but an observed fact. The question is how much it will move in 12 days.

2. **Historical movement patterns**: 
   - RT scores for wide releases typically see 70-80% of movement in first 3 days
   - We're at day 2-3, so 50-70% of final reviews may already be counted
   - Remaining movement typically ±3-8 percentage points from day-3 position

3. **Review velocity**:
   - Current: ~20 reviews (estimated from typical day-2 counts)
   - Expected by Feb 13: ~35-45 reviews total
   - Remaining: ~15-25 reviews to be added

4. **Fresh review probability**:
   - Current: ~2 fresh out of ~20 reviews = 10% fresh rate
   - For score to reach 15%: Need ~4 fresh out of next 20 reviews = 20% fresh rate
   - For score to reach 20%: Need ~8 fresh out of next 20 reviews = 40% fresh rate
   - For score to stay at 10%: Need ~2 fresh out of next 20 reviews = 10% fresh rate

5. **Source composition of remaining reviews**:
   - Major outlets: Mostly published (Variety, THR, Guardian, Deadline, USA TODAY done)
   - Remaining: Smaller outlets, conservative media, international critics
   - Conservative outlets (Daily Wire, National Review, etc.) may be 30-50% fresh
   - Other small outlets likely maintain 5-15% fresh rate similar to majors

**Scenario Modeling**:

**Pessimistic (10th percentile)**: 
- Next 20 reviews are 5% fresh (1 fresh review)
- Score: (2+1)/(20+20) = 7.5%
- Round to 7%

**Conservative (20th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 8% fresh (1-2 fresh reviews)  
- Score: (2+1.5)/(20+20) = 8.75%
- Round to 9%

**Below Median (40th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 12% fresh (2-3 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+2.5)/(20+20) = 11.25%
- Round to 11%

**Median (50th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 15% fresh (3 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+3)/(20+20) = 12.5%
- Round to 13%

**Above Median (60th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 20% fresh (4 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+4)/(20+20) = 15%

**Moderate Optimistic (80th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 30% fresh (6 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+6)/(20+20) = 20%

**Optimistic (90th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 40% fresh (8 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+8)/(20+20) = 25%

**Very Optimistic (95th percentile)**:
- Next 20 reviews are 50% fresh (10 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+10)/(20+20) = 30%

**Extreme (99th percentile)**:
- Unexpected critical reassessment or major conservative media push
- Next 20 reviews are 65% fresh (13 fresh reviews)
- Score: (2+13)/(20+20) = 37.5%
- Round to 38%

**Adjustments for Bounded Range**:
- Question bounds: 10-90% (open bounds, can go outside)
- Current score: 10-11%
- Lower bound is close to current score, limiting downside
- This suggests distribution should be right-skewed

**Final Calibration**:
- Strong floor at 6-7% (extremely unlikely to go lower given current 10-11%)
- Central tendency 12-15% (modest rise from current position)
- Upper tail extends to 25-40% (possible but requires significant conservative media support)
- 90% confidence interval: 7-25%

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for "Melania" on/after Feb 13, 2026 (percentage, 12 days from now)

2. **Outside view base rate**: 10-15% based on current 10-11% score; typical RT movement ±5-8 points in week 2

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 13%; mean ≈ 15-16% (slightly right-skewed); aligns with modest upward drift from current 11% as conservative outlets add fresh reviews while maintaining overall negative consensus

4. **Three most significant evidence pieces**:
   - Current RT score is 10-11% as of Feb 1 (multiple independent sources confirm)
   - Strong negative critical consensus across major outlets (Variety, THR, Guardian, Deadline all panned)
   - Score rose from 6% to 11% in 1-2 days, suggesting modest continued upward drift possible
   - Historical RT patterns show scores stabilize within ±5-8 points after day 3 for wide releases

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Conservative media outlets (Daily Wire, National Review, Breitbart, Washington Examiner, etc.) coordinate positive reviews in response to perceived "liberal media bias," publishing 10-15 fresh reviews that push score to 25-35% range. This would push outcome UP significantly beyond my 90th percentile.
