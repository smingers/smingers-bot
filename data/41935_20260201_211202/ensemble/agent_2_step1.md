## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Political documentaries (2020-2026):** Limited data - only "All In: The Fight for Democracy" (94% critics) and "Melania" (11% critics) have scores. Average: 52.5%, but n=2 is too small.

2. **Documentaries about controversial political figures:** Broader class including films about polarizing subjects. These tend to split along partisan lines with critics often rating lower than partisan audiences.

3. **Brett Ratner films:** His previous work ranges widely, but this is his first documentary and first film since 2014. Not directly applicable.

4. **Amazon MGM documentaries:** Previous political docs like "All In" scored 94%, but "Melania" represents a sharp departure in both subject matter and critical reception.

5. **Documentaries with extreme critic-audience splits:** Films where RT critic scores diverge dramatically from audience scores, often due to political polarization.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Documentaries about controversial contemporary political figures with extreme critic-audience polarization. This captures the unique dynamic where professional critics apply documentary filmmaking standards while partisan audiences rate based on subject affinity.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 12 days (February 1 to February 13, 2026)

**Current Status (February 1, 2026):**
- Film released January 30, 2026 (2 days ago)
- Current RT score: 11% (per Agent report)
- Initial score was 8% (per USA TODAY)

**Historical Patterns for RT Scores:**

1. **Early fluctuation period (Days 1-7):** Scores typically fluctuate as more reviews come in. For wide releases, the first week sees the most volatility.

2. **Stabilization period (Days 7-30):** Scores generally stabilize as the critical mass of reviews is reached. Major releases typically accumulate 80-150+ reviews within 2-3 weeks.

3. **Late-stage drift (Beyond 30 days):** Minimal movement unless retrospective reviews appear.

**Key Considerations:**
- We're currently in the early fluctuation period (Day 2)
- The question asks for the score on Day 14 (February 13)
- This falls within the stabilization window
- The 8% → 11% movement shows early volatility (+3 percentage points in ~2 days)

**Comparable Timeline Examples:**
- Controversial documentaries often see 5-15 percentage point swings in the first two weeks
- However, films opening with very low scores (<15%) rarely climb above 25-30% because the critical consensus has already formed

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Integrating Factors:**

1. **Starting Point:** Current score of 11% after 2 days provides a strong anchor. The initial critical reception is overwhelmingly negative.

2. **Critical Mass:** Major releases typically accumulate most reviews within 7-10 days. We're asking about Day 14, by which point the score should be largely stable.

3. **Direction of Movement:** The 8% → 11% trajectory suggests slight upward movement, but this is minimal. More reviews are coming in, and some may be slightly less harsh.

4. **Review Quality Distribution:** The named critics (Variety, THR, The Atlantic, USA TODAY) all gave very negative reviews (1-1.5 stars out of 4-5). The one positive outlier was London Evening Standard (3/5 = 60%). This suggests a small tail of moderately positive reviews may appear.

5. **Structural Ceiling:** Films with such negative critical consensus rarely recover significantly. The fundamental criticisms (propaganda, lack of insight, poor filmmaking) are unlikely to be contradicted by late-arriving reviews.

6. **Political Polarization Effect:** This cuts both ways - some critics may be predisposed to rate harshly, but professional film critics generally maintain standards regardless of subject. The audience score (99%) reflects partisan support, but critics are evaluating as a documentary film.

**Expected Range:**
- **Lower bound scenario:** A few more harsh reviews come in, score drops to 8-9%
- **Most likely scenario:** Score stabilizes between 10-15% as review count increases
- **Upper bound scenario:** Several moderately positive reviews (like the 3/5 from London Evening Standard) push it to 18-22%
- **Extreme upper bound:** Unlikely to exceed 25% given the fundamental critical consensus

## Outside view calibration:

The current score of 11% serves as a strong anchor. Given that we're only 12 days out from a 2-day-old release, most movement will occur in the next 7-10 days as the remaining major critics file reviews.

**Key calibration factors:**

1. **Volatility window:** We're in the high-volatility early period, but the direction is constrained by the existing critical consensus.

2. **Review accumulation rate:** Major releases get 60-80% of their total reviews in the first week. By Day 14, the score should be near its final value.

3. **Historical precedent:** Films opening below 15% rarely climb above 25%. The median outcome for such films is to end 2-5 percentage points from their Day 2 score.

4. **Distribution shape:** This should be right-skewed (longer tail toward higher values) because:
   - There's limited downside (can't go much below 8-10%)
   - There's some upside potential if moderately positive reviews appear
   - The extreme critic-audience split suggests some critics may rate it moderately

5. **Uncertainty factors:**
   - Exact number of remaining reviews unknown
   - Potential for international critics to weigh in
   - Small sample size means each review has meaningful impact
   - Political nature may attract non-traditional reviewers

**Setting the distribution:**

- **P10 (low outcome):** A few more harsh reviews push it down: **9%**
- **P20:** Minimal additional negative reviews, score holds steady: **10%**
- **P40:** Slight upward drift as review count increases: **12%**
- **P60:** Moderate stabilization with mixed late reviews: **14%**
- **P80:** Several moderately positive reviews appear: **17%**
- **P90 (high outcome):** Unexpected cluster of positive reviews: **22%**

This distribution reflects:
- Central tendency around 12-14% (close to current 11%)
- Limited downside (floor around 8-9%)
- Moderate upside tail (could reach low 20s with favorable late reviews)
- 80% confidence interval of 10-17% captures likely stabilization range
