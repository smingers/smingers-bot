Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Primary Sources (RT Score Data):**
1. **USA TODAY (Feb 1, 2026)** - Reports 11% Tomatometer score. High reliability; major national newspaper with editorial standards. This is factual reporting of the current score.

2. **HuffPost (Jan 31, 2026)** - Reports 6% score "as of Saturday afternoon." Reliable source but timestamp suggests this was measured earlier than USA TODAY's report, explaining the discrepancy.

3. **Fox News (Feb 1, 2026)** - Reports 11% critics score, 99% audience score. Confirms the USA TODAY figure for the same date.

4. **Multiple AskNews articles (Jan 28-Feb 1, 2026)** - Show score progression: predictions of <20% (Jan 28), then 6% (Jan 31), 8-11% (Feb 1). Pattern shows score stabilizing around 10-11% by Feb 1.

**Expert Opinions (Factual vs. Opinion):**
- **Harry Enten (CNN data analyst)** - FACTUAL prediction: 73% chance of scoring below 20% on RT (Jan 29). This was accurate.
- **Jeff Bock (Exhibitor Relations)** - OPINION on box office, not RT scores.
- **Film critics (Variety, Guardian, Hollywood Reporter)** - OPINIONS on quality, but their reviews constitute the RT score itself.

**Key Factual Observations:**
- Current score: 11% (as of Feb 1, 2026)
- Review count: Likely 18-25 reviews based on typical partisan doc patterns
- Audience score: 99% (extreme polarization)
- Box office: $7-8M opening weekend (exceeded predictions)
- No advance critic screenings (Amazon embargo)

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**STRONG EVIDENCE for score stability/minimal upward movement:**
1. **Historical reference class**: Three comparable partisan docs ("Death of a Nation" 0%, "Trump Card" 14%, "2000 Mules" 24%) averaged 13%. Current 11% sits within this band.
2. **Embargo pattern**: Films that block advance screenings historically receive worse scores as critics react negatively to lack of access. Late reviews tend to pile on.
3. **Critical unanimity**: Not a single mainstream "fresh" review from major outlets (NYT, WaPo, Variety, THR, Guardian). This level of consensus rarely reverses.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE for potential small upward movement:**
1. **Conservative outlet reviews pending**: Movieguide, Epoch Times, Christian outlets may file "fresh" reviews in coming days (historically 2-3 reviews for partisan docs).
2. **Review velocity slowing**: Most critics file within 48 hours of release. By Feb 1, the score has stabilized at 11% after early 6% reading.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
1. **Box office performance**: Strong audience turnout doesn't correlate with critic score changes on RT.
2. **Social media sentiment**: Audience score is separate metric; doesn't influence Tomatometer.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction window: 12 days (Feb 1 → Feb 13, 2026)**

For wide-release films, RT scores typically:
- Accumulate 80-90% of final reviews in first 3-4 days
- Add 5-10 late reviews over next 2 weeks
- Stabilize with ±5 percentage point movement after first week

For partisan documentaries specifically:
- Final review counts: 7-25 reviews (lower than mainstream docs)
- Late additions often skew slightly positive (niche conservative outlets)
- But movement rarely exceeds ±8 points from day-3 score

**If timeframe halved (6 days):** Prediction would shift down slightly (10th percentile: 8 → 9, median: 12 → 11) as fewer late reviews arrive.

**If timeframe doubled (24 days):** Prediction would shift up slightly (90th percentile: 28 → 32) as more conservative outlets file reviews, but median stays similar (12 → 13).

**(d) Justification**

**Base rate: 13% (average of reference class)**
**Current status: 11% (Feb 1, 2026)**

**Factors supporting minimal change:**
1. **Score already at historical equilibrium**: 11% vs. 13% reference class mean suggests we're at natural resting point for this film type.
2. **Review velocity pattern**: Score moved from 6% (Jan 31) to 11% (Feb 1), suggesting most reviews are already in. The 5-point jump indicates ~10-15 reviews filed, with 2-3 fresh reviews from conservative sources already counted.
3. **Critic pool exhaustion**: Major outlets have all filed. Remaining potential reviewers are niche conservative sites (maybe 3-5 reviews maximum).

**Factors supporting small upward drift:**
1. **Conservative media lag**: Epoch Times, Movieguide, Christian Film Critics typically file 3-7 days post-release. Could add 2-3 "fresh" reviews.
2. **Mathematical floor effect**: At 11%, adding even 2 fresh reviews among 8 rotten ones moves score to 14-15%.

**Calculation scenario:**
- Current: ~18 reviews, 2 fresh (11%)
- Pessimistic: +10 reviews, all rotten → 2/28 = 7%
- Expected: +8 reviews, 2 fresh → 4/26 = 15%
- Optimistic: +10 reviews, 4 fresh → 6/28 = 21%

**Why reference class remains valid:**
Current circumstances (Amazon backing, Ratner direction, Trump subject, critical embargo) precisely match the reference class conditions. The 11% current score falling within the 0-24% reference range confirms the analogy holds.

**Probability Calibration**

Given:
- Strong anchoring at 11% (current score)
- Historical precedent for ±5 point movement in week 2
- Small but real probability of conservative outlet bump
- Mathematical floor at 0%, ceiling practically at 30% for this film type

**Distribution logic:**
- **10th percentile (8)**: Assumes mostly rotten late reviews, slight downward drift
- **Median (12-13)**: Minimal change from current 11%, slight upward bias from 2-3 conservative fresh reviews
- **90th percentile (25)**: Requires optimistic scenario of 5+ fresh reviews from conservative outlets, historically rare but possible

**Tail considerations:**
- Lower tail bounded by 0% floor and current 11% anchor
- Upper tail bounded by genre ceiling (~30% for partisan docs) and time constraints (12 days insufficient for major score reversal)
- Wider confidence interval accounts for RT's occasional late review surges and potential policy changes

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for "Melania" on Feb 13, 2026 (percentage, 0-100 scale)

2. **Base rate**: 13% (reference class average); current status 11% validates this base rate

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 12.5; mean ≈ 14. This aligns with minimal upward drift from current 11% due to 2-3 late conservative fresh reviews.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Current score 11% (Feb 1) after stabilizing from 6% (Jan 31) - FACTUAL
   - Reference class (partisan docs) averaged 13% final scores - FACTUAL
   - Conservative outlets typically file 2-3 late fresh reviews - HISTORICAL PATTERN
   - No mainstream outlet has filed fresh review; unanimity unlikely to break - STRONG CONSENSUS

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major conservative media campaign (coordinated by Trump team) floods RT with 10+ fresh reviews from newly-registered conservative outlets. This would push score UP to 25-30%. Probability: low (<10%) but would make median forecast look pessimistic.
