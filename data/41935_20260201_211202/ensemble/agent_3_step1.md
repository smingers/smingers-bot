Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; fact vs opinion)
1) **Rotten Tomatoes page: “Looking for Melania Trump” (2021)**
- **What it is:** RT landing page for a *different* documentary (Laura Haim, 2021).
- **Usefulness:** Low for the target question; confirms naming confusion risk.
- **Quality/date:** Primary RT page, but irrelevant title.

2) **Rotten Tomatoes page: “Melania”**
- **What it is:** RT landing page for the correct film (Brett Ratner; wide release Jan 30, 2026; Amazon MGM).
- **Usefulness:** High in principle (it is the resolving source), but the provided extraction is incomplete (score not shown in the excerpt).
- **Quality/date:** Primary source; strongest—when readable.

3) **Rotten Tomatoes “Melania Trump” celebrity page**
- **What it is:** Site navigation/filmography page; no rating content in the excerpt.
- **Usefulness:** Low.

4) **USA TODAY news piece (Jan 30, 2026) about reviews / RT score**
- **Factual claims:** “Opened at 8%” Tomatometer; release details; premiere context.
- **Opinions:** Quotes/characterizations from identifiable outlets/critics (Variety, THR, The Atlantic) are expert opinions; consistent theme: “stage-managed,” “infomercial,” “fawning,” “stultifying.”
- **Quality/date:** High (major outlet; contemporaneous with release). Early-score reports can be volatile because RT scores move as additional reviews come in.

5) **USA TODAY full review (Jan 30, 2026)**
- **Factual:** Star rating ★½/4 (an identifiable critic’s rating).
- **Opinion:** The entire review is evaluative; still valuable as one data point representing a “rotten” review.
- **Quality/date:** High; named critic, contemporaneous.

6) **Rolling Stone feature (Jan 2026)**
- **Factual claims:** Deal size ($40m), production details, timing of screenings (attribution to WSJ etc.); background about Ratner allegations; anecdotal production quotes.
- **Opinions:** Many comments are anonymous crew sentiment; lower evidentiary weight for forecasting critic aggregation, but relevant for anticipating critical framing (“propaganda,” “access-buying” narrative).
- **Quality/date:** Medium-high as journalism; but much is interpretive/anonymous and not directly predictive of Tomatometer.

7) **Agent report (post-crawl synthesis; dated implicitly ~Feb 1, 2026)**
- **Key factual claim (most relevant):** “Melania – 11% critics / 99% verified audience,” described as cited by opening-week stories. This aligns directionally with USA TODAY’s “opened at 8%,” suggesting a small upward drift already.
- **Quality:** Mixed. It’s a secondary synthesis that may rely on other press captures rather than a direct RT scrape shown to us; still, it’s consistent with the known early-score volatility pattern (8% → ~11%).
- **Usefulness:** Good for a *current-ish* anchor point and for contextualizing how polarized films can show tiny critic scores with huge audience scores (though audience score is irrelevant to the question).

**Bottom line from sources:** Critic reception is overwhelmingly negative and already yielding a Tomatometer around ~8–11% in the first days after wide release. The main uncertainty is whether additional critics in the next ~12 days shift it modestly upward (to the mid-teens/20s) or keep it near ~10%.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choose best comparator set)
Possible reference classes:
1) **Wide-release U.S. documentaries with polarizing political subjects (2016–2026)**
- Pros: Same medium (doc), similar polarization dynamics.
- Cons: Many political docs are festival-acclaimed and score high; this film appears more like a “personality hagiography,” not investigative.

2) **“Hagiographic/PR” documentaries about prominent political figures (especially contemporaneous, access-driven)**
- Pros: Better structural match: controlled access, stage-managed tone, critics often penalize lack of journalistic bite.
- Cons: Sample is small; distribution can be bimodal (either “surprisingly competent” or “pure propaganda”).

3) **Films with very low early RT scores (<20%) after wide release**
- Pros: Directly relevant to the current state (already ~8–11%).
- Cons: Mixes genres; but helps estimate drift over the next two weeks.

**Most suitable:** A hybrid of (2) and (3): *access-driven, PR-flavored political personality documentaries that open with extremely low Tomatometer scores.* That class suggests final scores commonly remain low, with modest mean reversion as more reviews accumulate (unless the initial count was extremely small).

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long until resolution; how scores move)
- **Today:** Feb 1, 2026  
- **Target date:** Feb 13, 2026  
- **Time left:** 12 days.
- **Pattern:** RT Tomatometer often moves most in the first 1–3 weeks post-release as more reviews come in. If a film is widely reviewed immediately, later drift is typically small (a few points). If the first score was based on very few reviews, drift can be larger—but USA TODAY/Variety/THR coverage suggests major outlets already reviewed, implying the “core critic set” is in.

Given the film already had a nationwide theatrical release and broad press attention, I’d expect **limited movement** from the current ~8–11% zone, with more upside than downside (scores near 0–10 have more room to rise if even a handful of mixed-positive reviews arrive).

---

### (d) Justification (outside-view baseline → adjusted expectation)
**Outside view baseline:** Political documentaries as a broad class often score well (many are critically praised), so a naive base rate might be ~70–90%.  
**But inside/outcome-relevant adjustments based on current evidence:**
- The film is being reviewed as **stage-managed, airbrushed, propaganda-adjacent** by multiple major critics/outlets. That’s a strong predictor of a very low “fresh” share.
- Early reported Tomatometer: **8% opening (USA TODAY)**, with **~11% cited in the agent summary**. This is already in the extreme lower tail of RT outcomes.
- Over the next 12 days, the most plausible change is **small upward drift** (e.g., from ~11% to low/mid-teens) as additional reviews come in, unless the review pool remains tiny (in which case it could stay pinned near 10–12).

So my forecast centers in the **low teens**, with a meaningful but limited chance of moving into the **high teens/low 20s**, and a smaller chance of falling back toward **mid-single digits**.

Outside view calibration:
- I’m treating the current “~11%” as a strong anchor (because it matches the “opened at 8%” trajectory and the qualitative review consensus).
- I’m **not** making the distribution razor-thin because:
  - review-count uncertainty can cause 5–10 point swings at low scores,
  - some outlets (e.g., international/secondary critics) can be modestly kinder, and
  - RT classification (“fresh/rotten”) can differ from star ratings in non-linear ways.
- But I’m also **not** allowing huge upside (e.g., 40–60%) because that would require a wave of positive reviews inconsistent with the observed major-critic pattern.
