Analysis:

1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)  
Rotten Tomatoes critics Tomatometer score (percent) for “Melania” as observed on or after 2026-02-13.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs opinion)

- RottenTomatoes movie page (rottentomatoes.com/m/melania), accessed 2026-02-01  
  *Quality:* Primary source for eventual resolution, but the provided scrape is incomplete and omits the Tomatometer.  
  *Fact vs opinion:* N/A (site metric).  
  *Use:* Confirms the entity/URL and that RT is the canonical measurement, but does not give the number in the extract.

- USA TODAY news article (2026-02-01) on box office + reception  
  *Quality:* High; mainstream outlet; provides concrete metrics (opening weekend estimate, Tomatometer, Popcornmeter, CinemaScore).  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Facts: reported RT critics score (11%), audience score (99%), CinemaScore (A), box office ($7m). Opinions: commentary around meaning/implications.

- HuffPost (2026-01-31) “brutal 6% score” piece  
  *Quality:* Medium; tends toward editorial framing but references checkable metrics and named critics’ pull-quotes.  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Fact: RT critics score at that time (6%); Opinion: strong language and interpretation.

- Deadline review by Pete Hammond (2026-01-31)  
  *Quality:* High as a single critic review; important because Tomatometer is an aggregation of critic “fresh/rotten” classifications.  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Facts: release, access policies, runtime, etc. Opinion: Hammond’s negative assessment (implies “rotten” review).

- The Intercept review (2026-02-01)  
  *Quality:* Medium-High as a recognized publication; one critic voice.  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Facts: runtime, cost, anecdotal screening attendance. Opinion: very negative review (likely “rotten”).

- USA TODAY opinion column (2026-01-30)  
  *Quality:* Medium; opinion-forward; some factual budget/release context.  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Mostly opinion; limited direct value for Tomatometer level.

- AskNews articles (Fox News, KRQE, O Globo, ScreenRant, Us Weekly, etc.), mostly 2026-01-31 to 2026-02-01  
  *Quality:* Mixed, but multiple independent outlets converge on a narrow factual claim: critics’ Tomatometer around 9%-11% (with earlier mentions at 6%-8%).  
  *Fact vs opinion:* Facts: contemporaneous RT critics score and timing; Opinions: political framing about “bias,” audience reactions, etc.  
  *Use:* Useful for triangulating the current score range and its early movement (roughly 6 → 8 → 10/11).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (large shifts)
- Multiple independent outlets (USA TODAY, Fox News, KRQE, O Globo, HuffPost, etc.) report critics’ Tomatometer clustered around ~10%-11% as of 2026-02-01 (with 6%-9% earlier).  
  *Why strong:* Repeated, contemporaneous, easily checkable, and directly tied to the resolution metric.

- Structural “status quo” mechanism: as more critic reviews accumulate post-release, RT scores usually stabilize; huge moves are uncommon unless the early sample was tiny or systematically unrepresentative.  
  *Why strong:* Strong historical pattern for RT score dynamics.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- Reviews withheld / limited critic access pre-release (multiple sources).  
  *Mechanism:* Can cause early RT sample to be skewed toward the most motivated/most negative reviewers, sometimes allowing a mild rebound as broader critics weigh in.

- The documentary is highly politicized, and the early critic consensus described across outlets is “propaganda/infomercial,” implying a high share of “rotten” classifications even if star ratings vary.  
  *Mechanism:* If the core critique is about intent/ethics + dullness, later critics are likely to concur rather than reverse.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- Audience Popcornmeter near 98%-99% and CinemaScore A.  
  *Mechanism:* These do not directly move Tomatometer; at most, they correlate weakly with critics and could slightly increase odds of a modest critic rebound if some critics respond to craft/appeal.

- Anecdotes about empty theaters vs strong opening weekend.  
  *Mechanism:* Box office doesn’t directly affect Tomatometer; minimal relevance.

(c) Timeframe analysis

- Forecast horizon: from 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-13 = 12 days.  
- Expectation: the critic score should be in the “stabilization” phase by Feb 13, with smaller day-to-day changes than the opening weekend.

If timeframe were halved (~6 days out): I’d expect slightly wider uncertainty because the review count might still be building; more room for short-term volatility (e.g., 8%-18% central mass).  
If timeframe were doubled (~24 days out): I’d expect a tighter distribution around the eventual steady-state score, with tails shrinking unless a late wave of reviews from a new critic cohort appears.

(d) Justification: adjusting the outside view to an inside view

Outside-view baseline provided: central mass around 12%-14%, with P90 around 22%. I largely agree with that structure because:

- Current observable anchor is already extremely low (~10%-11% critics). For a film to climb from ~11% to, say, 30% by day 14 would require a large influx of fresh reviews (a step-change in critic sentiment), which is inconsistent with (i) the breadth of negative reviews already published and (ii) the nature of the criticisms (content/ethics + boredom).  
- However, the early path (reports of 6% / 8% very early, now ~10%-11%) suggests slight upward drift as the denominator (review count) grows. That argues for a right-skew (more upside than downside) but with a low ceiling.

So my inside-view adjustment is modest: keep the median in the low teens, allow a somewhat wider upper tail than the tightest possible model (because documentaries sometimes draw a wider, more international critic pool over the next two weeks), but still cap the plausible high tail below ~35% for Feb 13.

Probability calibration

- Trend continuation: early movement appears upward (6-8% → ~10-11%). If that continues but decelerates, a reasonable “settle point” is ~12%-15% by Feb 13.  
- Distribution shape: right-skewed (more ways to drift up a bit than down a lot, since you can’t go much below zero and the current score is already near the floor region).  
- Key uncertainty: how many additional critic reviews arrive by Feb 13 and whether they’re even slightly less negative than the first wave.

Checklist:
1) Target variable: RT critics Tomatometer % for “Melania” as of/on/after 2026-02-13.  
2) Outside view base rate used: P10/20/40/60/80/90 = 9/10/12/14/17/22.  
3) Consistency check: implied median ≈ 13; mean ≈ 14-15 (right-skew); consistent with “very low, slight rebound possible.”  
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Multiple outlets report current critics score ~10%-11% (direct metric anchor).  
   - Earlier reports at 6%-9% imply mild upward drift as reviews accumulate.  
   - Many named major-critic reviews are strongly negative (limits upside).  
   - By Feb 13 (day 14), the score should be near steady-state (limits volatility).  
5) Blind spot: RT could reclassify/remove a batch of reviews (or add a large new tranche), causing an unusual jump (likely up if early sample was unusually negative; could also go down if early “fresh” outliers get diluted).
