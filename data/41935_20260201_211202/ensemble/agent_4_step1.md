Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. RottenTomatoes pages (two incomplete scrapes) – Feb 2026, primary data source for the score itself.  High factual value, but the two extractions did not capture the Tomatometer.  
2. USA TODAY news story, 30 Jan 2026 – reputable national newspaper.  Factual: “opened at 8 %.”  Opinion: strongly negative review (Brian Truitt).  
3. USA TODAY review, 30 Jan 2026 – same critic, qualitative pan.  Good for colour, not for numbers.  
4. Variety, Hollywood Reporter, etc. (quoted inside USA TODAY piece) – professional critics, all negative.  Indicates critical tone.  
5. Rolling Stone feature, 27 Jan 2026 – mainly production gossip; confirms polarising context, little bearing on score movement.  
6. Agent report (crawl up to 1 Feb 2026) – cites several press stories that quote the current RT landing page as “11 % critics / 99 % audience” on 1 Feb 2026.  Because multiple outlets reproduced the figure and the page can be checked directly, I treat 11 % as the live Tomatometer today.  Quality: medium (second-hand), but timing is ideal (≤24 h old).

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes (Tomatometer, final values):  
• Big-studio personality docs perceived as right-wing propaganda:  
   – “Death of a Nation” (2018) 0 % (10 critics)  
   – “Trump Card” (2020) 14 % (7)  
   – “2000 Mules” (2022) 24 % (17)  
• Main-stream political docs with mixed reception:  
   – “Fahrenheit 11/9” (2018) 81 % (194)  
   – “All In: The Fight for Democracy” (2020) 94 % (99)  

The first cluster mirrors both content and partisan alignment of “Melania.”  Average of the three exemplars = 13 %.  I adopt this as the most suitable baseline.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today: 1 Feb 2026; resolution check: 13 Feb 2026 → 12 days.  
For wide releases, RT normally locks in 90 – 95 % of eventual critic reviews within the first week.  Late additions thereafter rarely move the score by more than ±5 percentage points unless the opening sample is <20 reviews.  Partisan docs usually end with 7 – 25 approved reviews; movement of ±10 percentage points in the second week is possible but larger shifts are historically rare.

(d) Justification/Outside view  
Starting point (status quo) = 11 %.  
• Directional forces downward: more mainstream critics still filing reviews are very likely “rotten.”  
• Forces upward: a small number of explicitly conservative reviewers (Movieguide, The Western Journal, Epoch Times) may come in “fresh.”  
Suppose current count ≈ 18 reviews, 2 fresh (11 %).  In the next 12 days we might see +10 reviews: 8 rotten / 2 fresh is a generous right-tail estimate.  New total 28 reviews, 4 fresh ⇒ 14 %.  
Worst-case (all rotten): 2 fresh / 28 total ⇒ 7 %.  
High-side (balanced 5 fresh / 5 rotten): 7 fresh / 28 ⇒ 25 %.  

Thus a plausible band on 13 Feb is 7 – 25 %, centred just under 15 %.  That dovetails with the 13 % historical mean of the chosen reference class.

Outside view calibration:
• Base distribution: Triangular 7 % (min), 14 % (mode), 25 % (max).  
• Convert to percentiles assuming slight right skew (more room to go up than down because we’re already near the floor yet cannot cross 0 %).  
• Add 2 pp slack at tails for unknown unknowns (late festival reviews, RT policy quirks).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 5  
Percentile 20: 8  
Percentile 40: 11  
Percentile 60: 15  
Percentile 80: 22  
Percentile 90: 28
