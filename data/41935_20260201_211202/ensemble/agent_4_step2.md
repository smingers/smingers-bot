Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, all 2026 unless noted)  
1. USA Today news (Feb 1): reports 11 % Tomatometer, 99 % audience. Major U.S. daily, identified data → strong factual.  
2. HuffPost (Jan 31): 6 % score. Large outlet, but 24 h earlier → strong factual, high volatility acknowledged.  
3. KRQE/AP pick-up & Fox News (Feb 1): both list 10-11 % critic score, 99 % audience. Independent confirmation → strong.  
4. Deadline, Guardian, Variety, THR individual reviews: all “rotten” ratings from well-known critics → strong evidence of critical consensus.  
5. RottenTomatoes page (snapshot lacked score) still primary resolving source; confirms film details.  
6. Opinion / analysis pieces (Breitbart, Intercept, Rolling Stone, etc.): mostly commentary; factual nuggets (budget, distribution) are reliable, opinions discounted.  
All sources are contemporaneous; there is no indication of later positive-review wave.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple mainstream outlets agree current Tomatometer is 10–11 %.  
• Nearly all top-tier critics published negative (“rotten”) reviews. Historical pattern: scores below 15 % rarely climb much after week 1.  

Moderate evidence  
• Critics embargo broke only at release; some mid-tier/international outlets may still file reviews, potentially nudging score upward 2–8 points.  
• A few mixed reviews exist (London Evening Standard 3/5); could be counted “fresh”.  

Weak evidence  
• Audience score 98–99 % (irrelevant to critic score).  
• Conspiracy talk of review manipulation (little precedent for critics’ side).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 12.  For wide releases RT usually locks in 80 % of final critic count by day 7; remaining drift typically ±3 pts. Halving timeframe (6 days) would narrow upside risk; doubling (24 days) could allow extra 5–7 pt rise if late-arriving, slightly positive reviews accrue, but film hits PVOD later which may invite a few more critics—still unlikely before Feb 13.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate (political docs) ≈ 75 % fresh. Current reality is an extreme outlier (≈ 10 %). Strong evidence of near-unanimous pans plus elapsed three theatrical days justify shifting mean down >60 pts. Small upward drift allowed for:  
• Additional 10–20 reviews (mostly likely rotten, but even 3–4 fresh can move low denominators).  
• Chance of RT dropping earlier duplicate reviews that were counted rotten (slight downward risk).  

Combined, I expect centre ~13 %, 80 % CI 5–24 %.  

Probability calibration
Implied median 13; mean ~14 (long right tail). Distribution matches evidence of possible slight uptick yet preserves low-score dominance.

Checklist:
1. Variable: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer for “Melania” on 13 Feb 2026, percent.  
2. Outside base 75 % (political doc average).  
3. Consistency: median 13; mean 14; matches justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) Multiple outlets list 10-11 % score; b) Major critics universally negative; c) Week-one drift historically ±3 pts; d) Embargo suggests few undiscovered raves.  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected wave of overseas festival critics deeming it “interesting propaganda art,” pushing score >30 % (would raise outcome).
