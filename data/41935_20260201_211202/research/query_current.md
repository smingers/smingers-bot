Analysis:
The Tomatometer score on February 13 will depend on (a) how many reviews have posted by then and (b) their positivity.  Because Melania had its premiere only three days ago (Jan 29) and a wide release just yesterday (Jan 30), very few full-length reviews may yet be aggregated.  Early trade-press reactions reported out of the Kennedy Center screening are mixed: some conservative outlets praise the unprecedented access; mainstream critics have called it “hagiographic” or “manufactured.”  That split suggests a mid-range score (40–70) is plausible.  The most useful information now will be:

• Rotten Tomatoes’ landing page to see the running tally.  
• First-wave reviews from major publications (NYT, WaPo, Variety, THR, IndieWire, AV Club).  
• Box-office and social-media sentiment pieces that sometimes quote RT percentages.  
• Industry commentary on Amazon’s record $40 million rights deal, which often references critical reception.

Hence the queries focus on finding the current Tomatometer number and very recent critic reviews since the 1/29 premiere and 1/30 release.
