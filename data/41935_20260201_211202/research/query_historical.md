Analysis:
The Tomatometer score is an aggregate of U.S. critics’ binary “fresh/rotten” reviews, weighted but not averaged by outlet importance.  It tends to stabilize after 25-35 reviews for a mid-profile documentary and after 60-80 reviews for a wide release like “Melania” (2,000 U.S. theaters).  
Key historical considerations that usually drive the eventual score:

1. Track record for Brett Ratner-directed or produced films: almost all of his narrative features score between 25-60 %, while the few documentaries he has produced (e.g., “Jewish Soldiers in Blue & Gray,” “Catfish” as exec-producer) land in the 70s.  
2. Polarizing political subjects: High-profile partisan docs split critics more sharply than general-interest docs.  Examples:  
   • “Hillary” (2020, Hulu) 79 %  
   • “Fahrenheit 11/9” (2018) 81 %  
   • “Trump Card” (2020) 14 %  
   • “Death of a Nation” (2018) 0 %  
   The direction of bias usually reflects perceived filmmaking craft plus ideological lean.  
3. Trump-related titles specifically trend low when made by partisan supporters (“The Trump I Know,” 33 %) and higher when critical (“Unfit,” 83 %).  “Melania,” being executive-produced by the subject herself, may be judged as hagiographic, which historically depresses scores.  
4. Distributor effect: Amazon-backed documentaries (“Time,” “All In: The Fight for Democracy,” “Good Night Oppy”) average 94 %, partly because Amazon ensures a critics-only pre-screening window.  That could raise “Melania’s” review count and help the average if workmanship is solid.  
5. Early-festival or premiere reactions often set the tone: several critics tweet first-impression ratings that later feed long-form reviews.  Locating first reactions from the 29 Jan Kennedy Center premiere is therefore vital.  
6. Volume of reviews by 13 Feb 2026: with a 30 Jan wide release, two full weekends will have passed—ample time for most major outlets to publish, so the score observed on 13 Feb is likely close to its terminal value.

Therefore, to generate an outside-view forecast, we need benchmarks for: (a) Ratner’s critical history, (b) self-produced political-figure documentaries, (c) Amazon MGM documentaries’ critic reception, and (d) the first wave of “Melania” reviews from premiere night and opening weekend.
