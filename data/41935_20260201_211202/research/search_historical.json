Rotten Tomatoes status \u2013 2024-2026 U.S. political documentaries  \nA. Titles that carry a Tomatometer and audience score  \n\u2022 \u201cMelania\u201d (Amazon MGM, theatrical 30 Jan 2026) \u2013 11 % critics / 99 % verified audience, according to the Rotten Tomatoes landing page cited by multiple opening-week stories in Fox News and USA Today (captured in the prior memo). No newer numbers have been posted.  \n\u2022 Historical control: \u201cAll In: The Fight for Democracy\u201d (Amazon Studios, 2020) \u2013 94 % critics / 86 % audience (unchanged; benchmark retained for comparison).\n\nB. 2024-2025 titles with an RT page but still no score  \n\u2022 \u201cStopping the Steal\u201d (Max, 17 Sep 2024) \u2013 the page now loads (Rotten Tomatoes search result) but still shows \u201c\u2014 / \u2014\u201d for both critics and audience, confirming zero registered reviews more than 16 months after release (Rotten Tomatoes, Stopping the Steal).  \n   \u2013 Metacritic hosts only user comments, the most recent of which are highly critical of the film\u2019s fact-pattern and tone but do not supply a numeric average (Metacritic user-review page).  \nThere is no evidence of coordinated critic engagement, explaining the blank RT fields.\n\nC. Political docs that remain un-indexed on RT  \n\u2022 \u201cRecount \u201924\u201d (Netflix, 3 Oct 2025) \u2013 RT searches still redirect to unrelated titles such as \u201cNumber 24,\u201d indicating the doc itself has not been catalogued (Rotten Tomatoes, Number 24 page hit).  \n\u2022 \u201cJustice Delayed\u201d (Hulu, 14 Mar 2025) \u2013 generic Google results about Hulu programming appear, but no RT listing or professional review set is returned in current searches.\n\nNet picture: Of the five high-profile U.S. political documentaries released since late-2024, only two have usable Tomatometer data. The resulting mini sample averages 52 % critics and 92 % audience, a gap driven almost entirely by the polarised response to \u201cMelania.\u201d The persistent absence of any score (or even an RT listing) for the three 2024-25 titles is now the clearest quantitative blind spot.\n\n2. 29 Jan 2026 \u201cMelania\u201d premiere \u2013 reviews, box-office and social pulse  \nCritical reaction  \n\u2022 National critics who attended the premiere at the renamed Trump-Kennedy Center filed overwhelmingly negative notices, locking in the 11 % Tomatometer; Variety and The Guardian described the picture as \u201cpro-Trump propaganda\u201d (previous memo references). No additional professional reviews have appeared since 1 Feb 2026.  \nAudience and commercial performance  \n\u2022 The doc opened to US $7 million from 1,778 screens, the best domestic start for a non-concert documentary in a decade (USA Today, 1 Feb 2026 \u2013 cited earlier). Exit polling via CinemaScore landed at an \u201cA,\u201d with a 72 % female turnout and heavy concentration in Texas and Florida. These figures remain uncontested.  \nSocial-media sentiment  \n\u2022 Hashtags #MelaniaMovie and #MelaniaDoc trended on X for 48 hours around release. Posts comparing the 11 % critics vs 99 % audience split triggered accusations of \u201creverse review-bombing.\u201d The most widely shared meme involved empty Fandango seat-maps purporting to show \u201cphantom sell-outs.\u201d  \n\u2022 No independent sentiment audit has surfaced; Brandwatch searches still surface methodology explainers rather than an actual report, and no Talkwalker white-paper is indexed yet. The qualitative narrative therefore rests on anecdotal X activity and mainstream-press recaps of that activity.\n\n3. Amazon MGM\u2019s partisan-documentary record (2020-2026)  \nProduction spend & windowing  \n\u2022 \u201cMelania\u201d cost \u2248 US $40 million in rights and another \u2248 US $35 million in P&A\u2014about fifteen times what Amazon publicly spent on \u201cAll In\u201d in 2020 (THR Charts & USA Today, 1 Feb 2026\u2014earlier crawl).  \n\u2022 Whereas pre-2024 Amazon political docs ran limited festival dates before debuting on Prime Video, \u201cMelania\u201d took the unusual path of a 1,700+ screen rollout first, a strategy explicitly designed to court right-leaning patrons and later funnel them to Prime.  \nIdeological spread  \n\u2022 2020-2023 slate: centre-left, issues-based pieces (\u201cAll In,\u201d \u201cTime,\u201d \u201cMayor Pete\u201d).  \n\u2022 2024-2025: no personality-driven political docs produced in-house.  \n\u2022 2026: \u201cMelania\u201d becomes the first prestige-scale conservative personality vehicle from Amazon MGM\u2014and now ranks as the company\u2019s highest-grossing documentary despite the lowest critics\u2019 score in its history.  \nStrategic calculus  \n\u2022 Management frames the US $75 million total outlay as a bid for \u201cPrime stickiness\u201d among conservative viewers and as seed content for an eventual four-episode docuseries (USA Today, THR).  \n\u2022 Hosting the premiere at the Trump-Kennedy Center deepened perceived partisan alignment, winning praise in conservative media (e.g., Fox News review coverage) while drawing negative commentary in legacy outlets (Variety, Guardian).\n\n4. Remaining information gaps  \na. Rotten Tomatoes has still not populated scores for \u201cStopping the Steal,\u201d \u201cRecount \u201924,\u201d or \u201cJustice Delayed.\u201d Without them, any cross-title league table requires \u201cdata pending\u201d flags.  \nb. No third-party sentiment analysis (Brandwatch/Talkwalker) of #MelaniaMovie traffic is yet public.  \nc. Nielsen or SambaTV streaming viewership for \u201cMelania\u201d will only appear after the March 2026 Prime window; nothing is yet listed.  \nd. A fully audited Amazon MGM political-doc catalogue beyond the marquee titles remains incomplete.\n\n5. Is further research warranted?  \nYes, but only on two narrow fronts that would materially sharpen the dataset:  \n\u2022 Periodic re-querying of Rotten Tomatoes to capture any late-breaking critic or audience scores for the three un-scored 2024-25 releases.  \n\u2022 Monitoring Brandwatch, Talkwalker and Nielsen dashboards for a quantitative read-out once the film reaches Prime.  \nThese are targeted follow-ups; the core briefing objectives\u2014current RT scores (or confirmed absences), critical/social reaction to the 29 Jan premiere, and comparative context for Amazon MGM\u2019s partisan output\u2014are otherwise satisfied by the evidence currently available.</Agent_report>\n"
