- **Strong evidence**: Shows score volatility in opening days but stabilization around 10-11%

**Additional AskNews articles:**
- Multiple international sources (O Globo, Journal de Montreal, etc.) confirm **6-11% RT range**
- CNN analyst Harry Enten (identified expert) predicted 73% chance of sub-20% score - prescient
- Letterboxd pre-release review bombing (100+ reviews at 2.5/5 stars) - **weak evidence** (not RT critics)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **RT score convergence (10-11% with 20 reviews as of Feb 1)**: Multiple independent sources (Hollywood Reporter, Fox News, Daily Beast, AskNews synthesis) confirm this range. This represents substantial critical mass.
2. **Score trajectory stabilization**: After volatility (6% → 11%), the score settled around 10-11% by Feb 1, suggesting early consensus formation
3. **Unanimous critical negativity**: Every mainstream critic cited (Gleiberman, Scheck, Brooks, McNamara, etc.) delivered harsh reviews - no positive major outlet reviews identified except London Evening Standard (3/5)
4. **Review volume**: 20 reviews by Feb 1 is substantial for a documentary; historical pattern suggests 5-15 more reviews over next 12 days

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Political polarization**: 11% critics vs 99% audience shows extreme divide, but audience score doesn't affect Tomatometer
2. **Box office performance**: $8M opening is respectable for documentary but irrelevant to critical reception
3. **Geographic concentration**: Strong performance in conservative markets (Florida, Arizona, Texas) suggests potential for more favorable regional critic reviews

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Ratner controversy**: Sexual misconduct allegations may bias some critics, but universal negativity suggests film quality issues
2. **Letterboxd bombing**: Pre-release negative reviews don't affect RT and reflect partisan opposition
3. **Premiere attendance**: Political figures praising film is expected and doesn't predict critical reception

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 1 → Feb 13, 2026)

**Current status (Feb 1):**
- 20 reviews, 10-11% score
- Major critics (Variety, THR, Guardian, Atlantic, Daily Beast, LA Times) have filed
- Opening weekend complete

**Expected evolution:**
- **Days 2-5 (Feb 2-5)**: Secondary market critics, regional outlets - expect 5-10 additional reviews
- **Days 6-12 (Feb 6-13)**: Stragglers, international critics, niche publications - expect 5-10 more reviews
- **Total by Feb 13**: 30-40 reviews (documentary typical)

**If timeframe halved (6 days to Feb 7):**
- Fewer total reviews (25-30)
- Score less stable; higher variance possible
- Prediction would widen confidence intervals slightly (8th percentile: 8%, 92nd percentile: 18%)

**If timeframe doubled (24 days to Feb 25):**
- More reviews (40-60 total)
- Score highly stabilized; minimal movement expected
- Prediction would narrow confidence intervals (10th percentile: 10%, 90th percentile: 15%)

**Historical documentary RT patterns:**
- After 20 reviews, scores typically move ±3-5 percentage points over next 2 weeks
- Films starting below 15% rarely climb above 25%
- Extreme consensus (all major critics negative) limits upside potential

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts

**Outside view baseline (from earlier analysis):**
- Documentaries with 10% RT score after opening weekend typically end at 8-15%
- Expected: 25-35 total reviews by Feb 13
- Mathematical constraint: With 20 reviews at 11% (2-3 positive), each new positive review adds ~3% to score

**Factors warranting UPWARD shift from baseline:**
1. **Score recovery**: The 6% → 11% movement (Jan 31 → Feb 1) suggests some moderating voices exist
2. **Regional/conservative critics pending**: London Evening Standard gave 3/5; Fox News coverage suggests conservative outlets may be more favorable
3. **Mathematical floor**: Already near lower bound (10%); limited downside room
4. **Review volume slowing**: Major harsh critics already filed; remaining reviews likely less influential outlets

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD shift from baseline:**
1. **Universal major critic negativity**: Not a single top-tier positive review; even moderate voices (Evening Standard) gave only 3/5
2. **Delayed major outlets**: Washington Post, New Yorker, other prestige outlets may still file harsh reviews
3. **International critics**: European critics historically harsh on Trump-related content
4. **Controversy momentum**: Minneapolis shooting timing, Ratner allegations may motivate additional critical coverage

**Net assessment:**
The strong evidence (20 reviews at 10-11%, universal major critic negativity, stabilization pattern) suggests the score is well-established. The baseline expectation of 8-15% remains appropriate, but I'll slightly narrow it to 9-14% given:
- Strong consensus already formed (limits volatility)
- Limited upside (no major positive reviews to suggest reversal)
- Mathematical floor effect (can't drop much below 5-6%)

**Key uncertainty:** Will regional/conservative critics provide enough positive reviews to push score to 15-18%, or will delayed major critics drive it to 7-9%?

Probability calibration:

**Core scenario (60% probability): Score remains 10-13%**
- 5-10 additional reviews, mix of 1-2 positive (regional/conservative) and 8-9 negative
- Score holds steady or rises modestly
- Median outcome: 11%

**Optimistic scenario (20% probability): Score rises to 14-20%**
- Conservative media outlets (Breitbart, Daily Wire, etc.) file positive reviews
- Regional critics more favorable than expected
- 3-5 positive reviews among next 10-15
- Mathematical effect pushes score to mid-teens

**Pessimistic scenario (20% probability): Score drops to 7-10%**
- Major delayed outlets (WaPo, New Yorker, international) pile on
- No positive reviews among next 10-15
- Score drifts down to high single digits

**Distribution construction:**
- **1st percentile (extreme downside)**: Major international critical pile-on, viral negative moment → 6%
- **10th percentile (pessimistic)**: All remaining reviews negative, delayed major outlets harsh → 8%
- **25th percentile**: Mostly negative reviews, 1 positive → 9%
- **Median (50th)**: Current score holds with modest fluctuation → 11%
- **75th percentile**: Several regional positive reviews → 13%
- **90th percentile (optimistic)**: Conservative media boost, 3-4 positive reviews → 16%
- **99th percentile (extreme upside)**: Unexpected critical reassessment, viral positive moment → 22%

**Calibration checks:**
- Mean implied: ~11.5% (slightly above median due to right-tail possibility)
- Mode: 11% (current score most likely to persist)
- Consistency: Distribution centered on current 10-11% with modest upside potential and limited downside

**Adjustments for unknown unknowns:**
- Widening 90/10 interval from (8%, 16%) to (7%, 18%) to account for:
  - Possible viral moments (positive or negative)
  - Unexpected critical voices (major international critics, surprise positive reviews)
  - Political events affecting coverage
  - Technical RT updates (review removals, recalculations)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for "Melania" on/after Feb 13, 2026 (percentage, 0-100 scale)

2. **Outside view**: Documentaries with 10% RT score after opening weekend typically end at 8-15% after 2 weeks

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 11%; mean ≈ 11.8%; aligns with "score holds steady with modest upside potential" justification

4. **Key evidence**:
   - 20 reviews at 10-11% as of Feb 1 (strong factual basis)
   - Universal major critic negativity (Variety, THR, Guardian, LA Times all harsh)
   - Score stabilization after 6% → 11% volatility (suggests consensus forming)
   - Historical pattern: documentary scores move ±3-5 points after opening weekend
   - Mathematical constraint: limited downside below 10%, modest upside potential to mid-teens

5. **Blind spot**: Conservative media outlets (Daily Wire, Breitbart, Newsmax, etc.) coordinate positive reviews to boost score above 20%, making my upside estimates too conservative. This would push outcome UP. Alternatively, a major international critic pile-on (Guardian already negative, but NYT International, Le Monde, etc.) drives score to 5-7%, making my downside too optimistic. This would push outcome DOWN.
