## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Political documentaries (all types):**
   - Too broad; includes both critical and sympathetic treatments
   - Wide variance in RT scores

2. **Authorized/hagiographic political documentaries:**
   - More relevant: films where subject has creative control
   - Examples: various campaign films, authorized biopics
   - Typically score 20-50% on RT when theatrically released
   - Most suitable reference class

3. **Brett Ratner films:**
   - His recent work has been limited due to 2017 allegations
   - His earlier films (Rush Hour series) had mixed critical reception (60-80% for first, declining for sequels)
   - Less relevant for documentary format

4. **Documentary films with extreme critic-audience splits:**
   - Rare phenomenon
   - Usually involves political/religious content
   - Suggests polarized reception unlikely to shift dramatically

**Chosen Reference Class:** Authorized political documentaries with subject involvement in production, particularly those released theatrically with significant marketing budgets.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 1, 2026 to Feb 13, 2026)

**Historical Patterns:**
- RT scores typically stabilize within 2-3 weeks of wide release
- Initial scores (first 15-20 reviews) usually predict final range within ±10-15 percentage points
- For polarizing political content, early scores tend to be more predictive (critics approach with established frameworks)
- Films with 6-11% after opening weekend rarely climb above 25%
- Additional reviews from major outlets (NYT, LAT, WaPo) typically file within first week

**Score Evolution Pattern for "Melania":**
- Jan 30: 8-9% (initial reviews)
- Jan 31: 6% (nadir with 16 reviews)
- Feb 1: 10-11% (20 reviews)
- Pattern shows slight upward drift as a few moderate reviews joined

**Expected Review Accumulation:**
- Currently at 20 reviews (Feb 1)
- By Feb 13, likely 35-50 total reviews
- Major dailies and international critics still to report
- Given unanimous negative tone from prestige outlets, unlikely to see significant positive shift

## (d) Justification

The current RT score of 10-11% is based on a meaningful sample (20 reviews) that includes major outlets. The critical consensus is remarkably unified: the film is described as "propaganda," "infomercial," and "inert" by Variety, NPR, Vanity Fair, and others. This level of critical consensus rarely reverses.

Key factors supporting limited upward movement:
1. **Critical unanimity:** Only 1-2 positive reviews out of 20 (London Evening Standard being the main "Fresh")
2. **Prestige critics already reported:** Variety, NPR, Vanity Fair represent the publications that could most influence the score
3. **Subject matter polarization:** Political documentaries with extreme audience-critic splits rarely see critic scores improve
4. **Historical precedent:** Films at 6-11% after 20 reviews rarely exceed 20-25% final scores

Factors that could push score higher (to 15-20% range):
1. **Regional/smaller market critics:** May be more sympathetic, adding a few "Fresh" reviews
2. **International critics:** Some non-US outlets may view differently
3. **Contrarian takes:** A few critics might argue for "camp value" or "fascinating as propaganda"

Factors that could push score lower (back toward 5-10% range):
1. **Additional major dailies:** If Washington Post, LA Times file negative reviews
2. **Late-filing prestige critics:** Could reinforce negative consensus

Most likely scenario: Score stabilizes in 12-18% range by Feb 13, with 35-45 total reviews. The current 10-11% represents a slight rebound from the nadir; a few more moderate reviews will likely appear, but the overwhelming critical consensus is established.

## Outside view calibration:

The current score of 10-11% with 20 reviews provides a strong anchor. Historical analysis of RT score evolution suggests:

- **10th percentile (pessimistic):** Score drops back or stays flat at 8-10% if remaining major critics are uniformly negative
- **50th percentile (median):** Score rises modestly to 13-15% as mix of negative and few moderate reviews accumulate
- **90th percentile (optimistic):** Score reaches 18-22% if several contrarian or regional critics file positive reviews

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed (more upside than downside potential) because:
1. Score already hit its nadir at 6% and rebounded
2. Remaining reviews more likely to include regional/smaller outlets that may be less harsh
3. Some critics may find "so bad it's interesting" angle

However, the range must stay relatively tight because:
1. 20 reviews is substantial sample size
2. Critical consensus is remarkably unified
3. Political documentaries with this reception pattern rarely shift dramatically
4. Only 12 days for additional reviews to accumulate

Setting confidence intervals:
- 80% confidence interval (10th-90th percentile): 9% to 21%
- This reflects high confidence score stays in "rotten" territory but acknowledges modest upward drift possibility
- Upper bound constrained by historical patterns of films with similar early reception
- Lower bound acknowledges possibility of additional harsh reviews from remaining major outlets
