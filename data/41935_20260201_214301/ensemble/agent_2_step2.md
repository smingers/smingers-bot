Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary factual sources (high reliability):**
1. **Fox News (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 11% critics score, 99% verified audience score. Factual data point, though outlet has conservative bias.
2. **KRQE/Multiple outlets (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 10% Tomatometer from critics. Cross-verified across multiple entertainment news sources.
3. **Hollywood Reporter (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reports "around 16 percent based on 16 reviews" at time of publication. Earlier snapshot, fewer reviews.
4. **Daily Beast (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 11% Tomatometer, 99% Popcornmeter. Known for liberal bias but factual score reporting.

**Key observations from sources:**
- Scores range 6-16% across different timestamps (Jan 30-Feb 1)
- Most recent consolidated reports (Feb 1) cluster at 10-11% with ~20 reviews
- All sources confirm extreme critic-audience split (critics ~10%, audience ~99%)
- No source reports scores rising; trend is stable or slightly declining

**Expert opinions (identifiable):**
- Owen Gleiberman (Variety): "cheeseball infomercial of staggering inertia"
- Frank Scheck (Hollywood Reporter): "fawns so lavishly...feels unpatriotic"
- David A. Gross (FranchiseRe): calls it "political investment" not commercial venture
- Harry Enten (CNN data analyst): predicted 73% chance of <20% score pre-release

**Quality assessment:**
- Factual score data: High confidence (multiple independent sources converge on 10-11%)
- Temporal precision: Current as of Feb 1, 2026 (today)
- Opinion vs. fact: Clear separation; critics universally negative but scores are objective metrics

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG evidence (large shifts justified):**
1. **Current score stability**: 10-11% with 20 reviews as of Feb 1. Historical pattern shows documentary scores rarely move >5 points after first weekend. Multiple independent sources confirm.
2. **Review velocity pattern**: Film opened Jan 30; by Feb 1 has 20 reviews. Typical documentary accumulates 60-80% of total reviews in first 7 days. Remaining 12 days likely adds 15-30 more reviews.
3. **Unanimous critical consensus**: Zero positive reviews from mainstream critics. Even lone positive review (London Evening Standard) gave 3/5 stars, which doesn't qualify as "Fresh" (60%+ needed). This structural unanimity is extremely rare and sticky.

**MODERATE evidence:**
1. **Reference class behavior**: Political hagiography documentaries ("Hillary's America" 4%, "Death of a Nation" 0%) show scores stabilize low. Counter-examples of dramatic rises don't exist in this category.
2. **Controversy factors**: Brett Ratner's #MeToo allegations, Amazon's $75M investment, timing with Minneapolis shootings - all generate negative press that may attract additional hostile reviews.
3. **Market expectations**: Prediction markets (Kalshi) gave 63-73% probability of <20% score pre-release. Markets were directionally correct.

**WEAK evidence:**
1. **Audience score divergence**: 99% audience vs. 11% critics. This doesn't predict critic score movement - it reflects political polarization, not quality reassessment.
2. **Box office performance**: $8M opening (better than expected) is commercially relevant but doesn't influence critic scoring patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 12 days (Feb 1 → Feb 13, 2026)

**Review accumulation dynamics:**
- Days 1-3 (Jan 30-Feb 1): 20 reviews accumulated
- Days 4-7 (Feb 2-5): Expect 10-15 additional reviews (major outlets' second-wave)
- Days 8-14 (Feb 6-13): Expect 5-10 additional reviews (stragglers, niche outlets)
- Total expected by Feb 13: 35-45 reviews

**If timeframe halved (6 days):**
- Would have ~30 reviews total
- Score likely 11-13% (less time for outlier positive reviews)
- Narrower confidence intervals (less uncertainty)

**If timeframe doubled (24 days):**
- Would have ~50-60 reviews total
- Score likely 10-15% (more niche/ideological outlets weigh in)
- Wider confidence intervals (more room for unexpected positive clusters)

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts

**Starting point**: Outside view established 12% median with 10-90 range of 6-24%.

**Adjustments based on inside view:**

1. **Current anchor is stronger than anticipated** (+confidence, -uncertainty):
   - We have real data (10-11% with 20 reviews) vs. pure prediction
   - This is not a forecast of what score *will be* but what it *will remain*
   - Score stability in first 48 hours is highly predictive for documentaries

2. **Critical unanimity is extreme** (-median slightly):
   - Zero "Fresh" reviews from 20 critics is remarkable
   - Even controversial docs usually get 1-2 sympathetic reviews early
   - This suggests ceiling is lower than outside view predicted
   - Adjust median from 12% → 11%

3. **Limited upside catalysts** (-upper tail):
   - No major film festivals scheduled before Feb 13
   - No critical re-evaluation cycle expected
   - Conservative outlets (Newsmax, etc.) may add 1-2 positive reviews but won't shift aggregate significantly
   - Upper bound scenarios (>20%) require implausible influx of positive reviews
   - Reduce 90th percentile from 24% → 19%

4. **Downside risks remain** (maintain lower tail):
   - Additional major outlets (WaPo, NYT second reviewers) likely negative
   - Backlash reviews from feminist/anti-Trump critics may intensify
   - Technical possibility of score dipping to 8-9% if next 10 reviews are all negative
   - Maintain 10th percentile at 8%

5. **Rotten Tomatoes methodology is stable**:
   - No indication of review purges or policy changes
   - Platform treats this as standard theatrical release
   - Score calculation is transparent and predictable

**Why current circumstances differ from pure outside view:**
- Outside view was predictive (pre-release); we now have 20 actual reviews
- The extreme unanimity (0% fresh) is rarer than base rate suggested
- Time remaining (12 days) is sufficient for score stabilization but insufficient for dramatic reversal

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency reasoning:**
- Current score: 10-11%
- Expected additional reviews: 15-25
- If next 15 reviews split 1 positive/14 negative (optimistic): 11% → 11.4%
- If next 15 reviews are all negative (pessimistic): 11% → 10.3%
- Most likely: 2-3 ideologically sympathetic reviews among next 20
- **Median prediction: 11%**
- **Mean prediction: 12%** (slightly higher due to right-skewed uncertainty)

**Distribution shape:**
- Strong concentration around 10-13% (70% of probability mass)
- Left tail constrained by current 11% (can't drop much below 8%)
- Right tail extends to ~22% (requires unlikely positive review cluster)
- Distribution is slightly right-skewed due to asymmetric risks

**Percentile reasoning:**
1st percentile (8%): Requires aggressive negative review influx + possible RT recalculation
10th percentile (9%): Next 20 reviews are 95% negative
25th percentile (10%): Next 20 reviews are 85% negative  
50th percentile (11%): Next 20 reviews maintain current 5% positive rate
75th percentile (13%): Next 20 reviews are 15% positive (conservative outlets engage)
90th percentile (17%): Next 20 reviews are 25% positive (unlikely but possible)
99th percentile (22%): Requires improbable positive review surge from niche outlets

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Unknown: Whether RT will add international critics (usually don't for US docs)
- Unknown: If any major critic reverses or issues amended review (extremely rare)
- Unknown: Potential for coordinated positive review campaign from MAGA media
- Known: Mathematical constraints (with 20 negative reviews, need 30+ positive to reach 60%)

Checklist:
1. Target: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for "Melania" on Feb 13, 2026 (percent, 0-100 scale)
2. Outside view: 12% median, 6-24% (10-90 range). Current data anchors at 11% with high confidence.
3. Consistency: Median=11%, Mean=12%. Aligns with 20 current reviews at 10-11%, expecting minimal drift over 12 days.
4. Key evidence: (1) Current 10-11% with 20 reviews, (2) Zero fresh reviews = extreme unanimity, (3) Documentary scores stabilize after weekend, (4) 12 days insufficient for reversal, (5) Reference class shows no comparable recoveries.
5. Blind spot: Coordinated positive review campaign from 15+ conservative outlets could push score to 18-20%. Would push outcome UP but probability <5%.
