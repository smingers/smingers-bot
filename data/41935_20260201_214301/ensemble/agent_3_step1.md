Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and date)
- **RottenTomatoes page (rottentomatoes.com, undated live page)**  
  *Factual:* film metadata (director Brett Ratner, distributor Amazon MGM, release date Jan 30, 2026, runtime).  
  *Missing:* the extracted snapshot doesn’t show the Tomatometer, review count, or consensus.  
  *Quality:* Rotten Tomatoes is the canonical source for the resolved value, but the provided capture is incomplete, so it doesn’t directly anchor today’s score.

- **IMDb news repost (imdb.com/news, dated ~Jan 31–Feb 1, 2026)**  
  *Factual claim:* Tomatometer “debuted” at **7%**; Metacritic **6/100** (13 reviews); box office near $7M.  
  *Quality:* Weak-to-medium. IMDb news pages are often republished items with disclaimers; the numeric RT/MC claims could be correct but should be cross-validated elsewhere.

- **The Daily Beast (Feb 1, 2026)**  
  *Factual claim:* Tomatometer **11%**; verified audience **99%** (Popcornmeter).  
  *Opinion:* framing about “MAGA” boosting reviews.  
  *Quality:* Medium for the reported snapshot number (plausible, consistent with other reporting), but it’s not the primary data source.

- **Vanity Fair review (Jan 31, 2026)**  
  *Factual:* detailed description of scenes/structure.  
  *Opinion (expert critic):* strongly negative assessment.  
  *Quality:* High as a critic’s qualitative signal; doesn’t provide the aggregate score, but supports the “overwhelmingly negative reviews” premise.

- **NPR review (Jan 30, 2026)**  
  *Factual:* describes film approach; mentions Amazon’s role; also critiques editing/manipulation.  
  *Opinion (expert critic):* negative; “most expensive infomercial.”  
  *Quality:* High for sentiment; again not an aggregate score source.

- **Variety review (Jan 30, 2026)**  
  *Factual:* production/marketing spend claims; narrative description.  
  *Opinion (expert critic):* extremely negative.  
  *Quality:* High for sentiment and likely influential among critics.

- **Agent report (compiled, latest datapoint Feb 1, 2026)**  
  *Factual synthesis:* multiple outlets cite **10–11%** as of Feb 1; one outlet (ComicBook.com) specifies **10% with 20 critic reviews**; earlier trajectory down to **6% with 16 reviews** on Jan 31.  
  *Quality:* Medium-to-high as a triangulation tool (it names multiple independent snapshots and review-count changes). Still secondhand, but the cross-source agreement makes the “~10–11% on ~20 reviews” anchor fairly solid.

**Net read of current info:** As of Feb 1, the Tomatometer is very likely around **10–11%**, with a small-ish critic count (~20), and the critical tone from major critics is strongly negative.

### (b) Reference class analysis
Plausible reference classes:
1. **Wide-release documentaries** (all topics): too broad; many docs cluster fresh (often 70%+) and won’t represent a heavily stage-managed political hagiography.
2. **Polarizing political documentaries** (especially partisan/advocacy): better. These can land anywhere from single digits to high scores, but advocacy films often get punished if they’re seen as propaganda or low-craft.
3. **“Celebrity/political figure PR vehicle” documentaries** (hagiographies, controlled-access portraits): best fit. These often receive poor critical reception if they feel like ads rather than inquiry.

**Chosen reference class:** (3) hagiographic/PR political documentaries with heavy subject control, released widely enough to attract mainstream critics.

Base-rate expectation from that class: **low Tomatometer, commonly <30%, sometimes in single digits**, and scores tend to stay “Rotten” even as more reviews arrive.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-01  
- **Resolution date:** 2026-02-13 (Metaculus will check on/after Feb 13)  
- **Time left:** ~12 days

Rotten Tomatoes early dynamics:
- With **~20 reviews**, the Tomatometer can still move, but it becomes **progressively harder** to shift a lot as the denominator grows.
- Over the next ~2 weeks, I’d expect more reviews to post (regional outlets, late national reviews, possibly international). That usually **nudges** the score rather than flipping it—unless the initial set was unusually unrepresentative.

---

### (d) Outside-view justification (baseline)
Start from the base rate for “controlled-access political PR doc” and then anchor to the *current observed* trajectory:

- The film is already sitting around **10–11%** (Feb 1) after previously dipping to **~6%** (Jan 31). That implies: even after some additional reviews, it remains near the floor.
- To reach, say, **30%** by Feb 13, the film would need a *large share of incoming reviews* to be Fresh. With current critics’ language (Variety/NPR/VF) describing it as “infomercial/propaganda/inert,” a big swing upward seems unlikely.
- A small upward drift is plausible if later reviews are mildly less negative than the first wave (e.g., some 2.5/4 or 3/5 reviews that count as “Fresh”). But given the strength of the negative consensus among prominent critics, the most likely outcome is **still in the 8–18% band**.

So my outside-view baseline for Feb 13 is: **low teens**, with meaningful uncertainty but limited upside.

---

Outside view calibration:

I’m aiming for a distribution that reflects:
- **Small-N volatility** (20 reviews is not huge), so allow movement of several points either way.
- **But** also reflect that moving from ~10% to even ~25% would require a fairly dramatic change in incoming-review mix, which is historically uncommon once major critics have weighed in strongly negative.
- Upset risk: occasional “so-bad-it’s-good / camp” reassessments can produce a handful of Fresh late reviews, but it rarely overcomes a strong early Rotten consensus.

I therefore set:
- A **wide 10–90 interval** spanning from low single digits to low/mid 30s.
- Median-ish mass in the low teens.
