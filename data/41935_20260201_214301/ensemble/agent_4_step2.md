Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological)

1. Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Guardian, Atlantic, etc. (Jan 30 – 31) – first-wave professional reviews, all highly negative.  High-quality industry critics, dated opening day.  Fact: described film content; RT score snapshots 6-8 %.  Opinion: “expensive propaganda”.  Reliability: strong.

2. ScreenRant / Globe & Mail / LAT / BBC (Jan 30 – 31) – same tone, add production facts (75 million budget, Ratner comeback).  Quality: good for facts, strong for sentiment; dates match release.

3. Hollywood Reporter round-up (Jan 30) – quotes many outlets, lists RT 16 % on 16 reviews.  Quality: medium (secondary aggregation) but internally consistent.

4. Fox News & Daily Beast (Feb 1) – quote RT 11 % critics / 99 % verified audience.  Provide weekend gross projection 8 million.  Mixed partisan framing; numbers likely copied directly from RT.  Quality: moderate for score, weak for interpretation.

5. International wires (Le Journal, TVA, KRQE, O Globo – Jan 31 – Feb 1) – echo score 6-11 %, add comparisons to past flops.  Secondary sources; useful as corroboration.

No later sources (Feb 2 – 13) yet available, so the latest hard datapoint is 11 % on ~20 critic reviews as of 1 Feb 2026.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent snapshots (HR, Fox, Daily Beast, wires) agree the Tomatometer is in the 6-11 % band (direction: very low).  
• Historical pattern: once a documentary opens with <20 % on ≤30 reviews, final score almost always stays “rotten” (<60 %) and usually remains within ±8 points of the opening week value.  
• Structural factor: critics of record (NYT, WaPo, Variety, Guardian, THR) have already filed; their verdict is locked in and carries heavy weight in the denominator.

Moderate evidence  
• Review count still low (~20) → each new Fresh review would move the percentage ≈ 4-5 points, so some volatility persists.  
• A handful of niche or politically sympathetic outlets may publish friendlier takes once the theatrical window expands, nudging the score upward.  
• Very wide critic / audience split could prompt a few contrarian “it isn’t THAT bad” reviews.

Weak evidence  
• Rumours of coordinated positive reviews (audience side) – do not affect critic score.  
• Box-office performance (better than feared) – critics rarely revise ratings post-hoc.  
• Possibility of additional festival or streaming cuts generating new critic reviews by 13 Feb – unlikely in 12 days.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 12 days.  Expect 5-15 additional critic reviews (typical for a wide-release doc).  If doubled (24 days) I would widen the upper tail slightly (more chances for sympathetic pieces).  If halved (6 days) I would narrow variance; less time for movement.

(d) Justification & inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate for glossy political hagiography docs: median ≈ 18 %, 80 % range 5-35 %.  
Current hard data (11 %) sits below that median; strong negative unanimity from top critics suggests the film is performing at the very bottom of its reference class.  Given small-N volatility I allow for a 4-8 point upward drift (contrarian or niche reviews) and a slim chance (<10 %) of a major downward dip if more pans arrive.  This yields a median of 12 – 13 %, 10–90 band roughly 5 – 26 %.

Probability calibration
Implied median ≈ 12.5; mean ≈ 15 (right-tailed).  Reflects high likelihood of staying near present value, with modest upside variance from future Fresh reviews.

Checklist:
1. Target: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer (critics %) for “Melania” on 13 Feb 2026.  
2. Base rate: political PR docs median 18 %.  
3. Consistency: median 12.5; mean 15; aligns with evidence of 11 % today and historic inertia.  
4. Key evidence: a) RT 11 % on 20 reviews (Feb 1).  b) Major critics’ scathing reviews.  c) Historical stability of early scores.  d) Only 12 days left.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden influx of 10-15 pro-Trump outlet reviews rated Fresh would push score >30 % (upside).
