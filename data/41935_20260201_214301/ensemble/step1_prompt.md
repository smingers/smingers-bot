Query: Retrieve current Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score and critic count for 2026 documentary “Melania”; summarize critical consensus trends since Jan 29 premiere
Based on every date-stamped article in the current results set, the latest public, source-verifiable Rotten Tomatoes numbers for Brett Ratner’s 2026 documentary “Melania” are:

• Tomatometer score: 10 %–11 %, status “Rotten”.  
  – ComicBook.com reports 10 % as of 1 Feb 2026, explicitly adding “with 20 critic reviews” (ComicBook.com, 1 Feb 2026).  
  – Fox News, USA Today and The Daily Beast all say 11 % on the same calendar date, but none of them specify how many reviews that figure is based on (Fox News, 1 Feb 2026; USA Today, 1 Feb 2026; Daily Beast, 1 Feb 2026).

• Verified critic-review count: 20 reviews is the most recent hard number available, supplied by ComicBook.com on 1 Feb 2026. No later article or the truncated Rotten Tomatoes page snippet in the search results discloses a newer tally.

Because Rotten Tomatoes updates continuously and its landing page in the search results withholds the scoreboard, these 1 Feb figures are the latest that can be cited with documentation from the material provided.

Trajectory of the Tomatometer since the 29 Jan premiere

1. 29 Jan 2026 – Invite-only Kennedy Center premiere; mainstream critics were barred. Variety’s recap (quoted by ScreenRant) indicates Rotten Tomatoes still read “No score yet” at the end of the night (ScreenRant, 31 Jan 2026).

2. Opening day, 30 Jan – The first wave of reviews pushed the score into single digits: USA Today logged an early 8 % (USA Today, 30 Jan coverage cited in ScreenRant), while Us Weekly captured 9 % later that morning (ScreenRant, 31 Jan). Rough math suggests roughly a dozen notices, with only one counted as “Fresh”.

3. 31 Jan – As more national outlets filed, the Tomatometer bottomed out. HuffPost, The Hollywood Reporter and Economic Times snapshots all record 6 % (HuffPost, 31 Jan 2026; Hollywood Reporter, 31 Jan 2026; Economic Times, undated but summarising 31 Jan stats). ScreenRant pegs exactly “16 critic reviews” at 6 % (ScreenRant, 31 Jan 2026). A Fiction Horizon/IMDb news item appearing the same day lists 7 % with 15 reviews—an earlier capture during the slide (IMDb news, 31 Jan 2026).

4. 1 Feb – A handful of additional, slightly less negative reviews nudged the percentage upward.  
   • Daily Beast and Fox News cite 11 %.  
   • USA Today’s weekend box-office piece repeats 11 %.  
   • ComicBook.com, time-stamped the same day, shows 10 % and for the first time reveals a larger pool: 20 critic reviews.  
   Taken together, these stories confirm at least four new reviews were logged between the 31 Jan (16 reviews) and 1 Feb (20 reviews) snapshots, and that two of those four were “Fresh,” raising the approval rate but leaving the film deeply in “Rotten” territory.

5. 2 Feb and beyond – No article in the supplied corpus provides fresher numbers. Consequently, 10 %–11 % on a base of 20 published reviews remains the latest verifiable reading.

Patterns in the written criticism

• “Glorified infomercial” & “expensive propaganda”: Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and The Daily Beast all use language to this effect, faulting the film for total message control by its subject (Fox News, Daily Beast).

• Craft complaints: reviewers label the documentary “insipid,” “breathtakingly inert,” or “pure, endless hell” (HuffPost, ScreenRant roundup, Guardian quotes within HuffPost).

• Ethical alarm bells: several outlets, notably The Guardian and Variety, argue that Amazon’s $40 million licensing deal reads as political payoff (HuffPost, Economic Times).

• Outlier praise: the London Evening Standard’s 3-star write-up remains the only consistently cited “Fresh” review; ComicBook.com and Daily Beast each mention one additional positive regional notice.

• Critics-versus-audience gulf: every 30 Jan-1 Feb article notes a 98–99 % verified-audience score and an “A” CinemaScore, creating the largest critic/audience split ever recorded on Rotten Tomatoes according to ComicBook.com (ComicBook.com, 1 Feb 2026).

How the consensus evolved

Day-by-day, the critical narrative hardened rapidly:

• 29 Jan – no access, but concern about censorship.  
• 30 Jan – early reviews already frame the film as hagiography.  
• 31 Jan – unanimity in negative tone; multiple pieces draw direct analogies to propaganda, foot-fetish shots, and “camp classic” potential. The score sinks to its nadir (6 %).  
• 1 Feb – second-day takes continue the panning but a few moderate voices (Standard, Newsmax) appear, reflected in the slight score rebound to ~10 %. Commentators pivot to the story behind the numbers—the unprecedented audience/critic gap and the documentary’s surprisingly strong $7–8 million opening weekend (USA Today, Fox News, Hollywood Reporter).

Financial context

The box-office surprise (estimated $7 million opening; USA Today, 1 Feb 2026) amplified coverage and likely ensured further reviews will post in the coming week. Industry reporters expect the Tomatometer to keep fluctuating as metropolitan critics (Los Angeles Times, Washington Post) and international outlets file.

What is firmly established

• Earliest recorded score: 8–9 % on 30 Jan.  
• Lowest recorded score: 6 % (16 reviews) on 31 Jan.  
• Latest documented score: 10 %–11 % (20 reviews) on 1 Feb.  
• Critical trajectory: sharp fall on day 2, modest recovery on day 3; overall consensus remains overwhelmingly negative.

Remaining information gaps

1. Live Rotten Tomatoes scoreboard after 1 Feb 2026: the exact, up-to-the-minute Tomatometer percentage, critic count and fresh/rotten split can only be confirmed by visiting the page or querying Rotten Tomatoes’ API.  
2. Identification of which additional reviews turned the dial from 6 % to 10–11 %.  
3. Forthcoming reviews from large U.S. dailies and overseas publications that could move the needle again.  
4. Whether Rotten Tomatoes will ultimately post an official Critics’ Consensus blurb (none is quoted yet).

To close those gaps, a direct check of the Rotten Tomatoes page or screenshots archived after 1 Feb would be required; no article in the present search results provides newer, citable data.

Conclusion

As of the most recent verifiable reporting (1 Feb 2026), “Melania” holds a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer of approximately 10 %–11 %, derived from 20 published critic reviews, cementing it as one of the worst-reviewed wide-release documentaries in recent memory. The score’s day-by-day history shows an initial single-digit debut, a plunge to 6 %, and a slight rebound once a handful of milder notices appeared. The overwhelming through-line of the commentary is that the film functions as lavish propaganda, marred further by inert filmmaking; only a couple of outlets find limited merit as a curated self-portrait. Meanwhile, the audience score remains an off-the-charts 98–99 %, creating a record-setting critic-versus-viewer divide and fuelling the secondary media narrative around the documentary. Unless and until additional, independently sourced data emerge, these 1 Feb figures stand as the current consensus snapshot.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
