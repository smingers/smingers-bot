These typically receive mixed-to-negative reviews when subject has editorial control.\\n\\n3. **Documentary films that debut with sub-15% RT scores:** Most appropriate reference class. Historically, such films rarely recover significantly:\\n   - Reviews accumulate slowly after opening weekend\\n   - Early critical consensus tends to solidify\\n   - Films starting at 6-11% typically end between 8-20%\\n\\n4. **Brett Ratner films:** His recent work has been poorly reviewed, but limited documentary precedent\\n\\n**Selected reference class:** Documentary films with opening-weekend RT scores of 5-15%, examining their score trajectories over the subsequent 2 weeks.\\n\\n## (c) Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n**Prediction timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 1, 2026 \u2192 Feb 13, 2026)\\n\\n**Historical patterns for RT score evolution:**\\n\\n- **Days 1-3 (already passed):** Rapid accumulation of major critic reviews; score volatility highest\\n- **Days 4-7:** Secondary market critics and slower publications file; score typically stabilizes\\n- **Days 8-14:** Stragglers and international reviews; minimal movement (\u00b12-5 percentage points)\\n\\nFor documentaries specifically:\\n- Review volume is lower than narrative features\\n- Most reviews arrive in first 5 days\\n- After opening weekend, 5-10 additional reviews typical over next 2 weeks\\n- Score changes after day 5 rarely exceed 5-7 percentage points\\n\\n**Current status (Feb 1):** 20 reviews, 10-11% score\\n**Expected by Feb 13:** 25-35 total reviews\\n\\n## (d) Justification for Outside View\\n\\n**Baseline from current data:**\\n- Starting point: 10-11% with 20 reviews as of Feb 1\\n- 12 days remaining until resolution\\n\\n**Factors suggesting score stability/modest increase:**\\n1. Initial wave of harshest critics (major metros, trades) already filed\\n2. Some regional/conservative outlets may be more favorable (London Evening Standard gave 3/5)\\n3. Mathematical effect: With 20 reviews, each new positive review adds ~5 percentage points; each negative adds ~0.5 points downward\\n4. The score already recovered from 6% to 11% (Jan 31 to Feb 1), suggesting some moderating reviews exist\\n\\n**Factors suggesting potential decrease:**\\n1. Delayed reviews from major outlets (LA Times, Washington Post) could be negative\\n2. International critics may pile on\\n3. Amazon/political controversy may motivate critical coverage\\n\\n**Historical precedent:**\\n- Films opening at 10% rarely climb above 20% or fall below 5%\\n- The 20-review sample is substantial enough to indicate true consensus\\n- Documentary review volumes are modest; 10-15 additional reviews likely\\n\\n**Expected range:**\\n- **Most likely outcome:** 8-15% (score holds roughly steady with minor fluctuation)\\n- **Optimistic scenario:** 15-22% (several moderate reviews from conservative/regional outlets)\\n- **Pessimistic scenario:** 5-10% (additional major critics pan it)\\n\\nThe 99% audience score is irrelevant to Tomatometer (critics only).\\n\\n## Outside View Calibration\\n\\nGiven:\\n- Current score: 10-11% (20 reviews)\\n- 12 days until resolution\\n- Expected 25-35 total reviews by Feb 13\\n- Historical pattern: scores stabilize after opening weekend\\n\\n**Distribution reasoning:**\\n\\nThe score is already well-established with 20 reviews. The question is how much it will move with 5-15 additional reviews.\\n\\n**Scenario modeling:**\\n- If 10 more reviews arrive and 1-2 are positive: 11% \u2192 13-15%\\n- If 10 more reviews arrive and all negative: 11% \u2192 9-10%\\n- If 15 more reviews arrive with 2-3 positive: 11% \u2192 14-17%\\n\\n**Calibration considerations:**\\n1.

The baseline expectation of 8-15% remains appropriate, but I\\'ll slightly narrow it to 9-14% given:\\n- Strong consensus already formed (limits volatility)\\n- Limited upside (no major positive reviews to suggest reversal)\\n- Mathematical floor effect (can\\'t drop much below 5-6%)\\n\\n**Key uncertainty:** Will regional/conservative critics provide enough positive reviews to push score to 15-18%, or will delayed major critics drive it to 7-9%?\\n\\nProbability calibration:\\n\\n**Core scenario (60% probability): Score remains 10-13%**\\n- 5-10 additional reviews, mix of 1-2 positive (regional/conservative) and 8-9 negative\\n- Score holds steady or rises modestly\\n- Median outcome: 11%\\n\\n**Optimistic scenario (20% probability): Score rises to 14-20%**\\n- Conservative media outlets (Breitbart, Daily Wire, etc.) file positive reviews\\n- Regional critics more favorable than expected\\n- 3-5 positive reviews among next 10-15\\n- Mathematical effect pushes score to mid-teens\\n\\n**Pessimistic scenario (20% probability): Score drops to 7-10%**\\n- Major delayed outlets (WaPo, New Yorker, international) pile on\\n- No positive reviews among next 10-15\\n- Score drifts down to high single digits\\n\\n**Distribution construction:**\\n- **1st percentile (extreme downside)**: Major international critical pile-on, viral negative moment \u2192 6%\\n- **10th percentile (pessimistic)**: All remaining reviews negative, delayed major outlets harsh \u2192 8%\\n- **25th percentile**: Mostly negative reviews, 1 positive \u2192 9%\\n- **Median (50th)**: Current score holds with modest fluctuation \u2192 11%\\n- **75th percentile**: Several regional positive reviews \u2192 13%\\n- **90th percentile (optimistic)**: Conservative media boost, 3-4 positive reviews \u2192 16%\\n- **99th percentile (extreme upside)**: Unexpected critical reassessment, viral positive moment \u2192 22%\\n\\n**Calibration checks:**\\n- Mean implied: ~11.5% (slightly above median due to right-tail possibility)\\n- Mode: 11% (current score most likely to persist)\\n- Consistency: Distribution centered on current 10-11% with modest upside potential and limited downside\\n\\n**Adjustments for unknown unknowns:**\\n- Widening 90/10 interval from (8%, 16%) to (7%, 18%) to account for:\\n  - Possible viral moments (positive or negative)\\n  - Unexpected critical voices (major international critics, surprise positive reviews)\\n  - Political events affecting coverage\\n  - Technical RT updates (review removals, recalculations)\\n\\nChecklist:\\n\\n1. **Target variable**: Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for \"Melania\" on/after Feb 13, 2026 (percentage, 0-100 scale)\\n\\n2. **Outside view**: Documentaries with 10% RT score after opening weekend typically end at 8-15% after 2 weeks\\n\\n3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 11%; mean \u2248 11.8%; aligns with \"score holds steady with modest upside potential\" justification\\n\\n4. **Key evidence**:\\n   - 20 reviews at 10-11% as of Feb 1 (strong factual basis)\\n   - Universal major critic negativity (Variety, THR, Guardian, LA Times all harsh)\\n   - Score stabilization after 6% \u2192 11% volatility (suggests consensus forming)\\n   - Historical pattern: documentary scores move \u00b13-5 points after opening weekend\\n   - Mathematical constraint: limited downside below 10%, modest upside potential to mid-teens\\n\\n5. **Blind spot**: Conservative media outlets (Daily Wire, Breitbart, Newsmax, etc.) coordinate positive reviews to boost score above 20%, making my upside estimates too conservative. This would push outcome UP. Alternatively, a major international critic pile-on (Guardian already negative, but NYT International, Le Monde, etc.) drives score to 5-7%, making my downside too optimistic.

The critical consensus is remarkably unified: the film is described as \"propaganda,\" \"infomercial,\" and \"inert\" by Variety, NPR, Vanity Fair, and others. This level of critical consensus rarely reverses.\\n\\nKey factors supporting limited upward movement:\\n1. **Critical unanimity:** Only 1-2 positive reviews out of 20 (London Evening Standard being the main \"Fresh\")\\n2. **Prestige critics already reported:** Variety, NPR, Vanity Fair represent the publications that could most influence the score\\n3. **Subject matter polarization:** Political documentaries with extreme audience-critic splits rarely see critic scores improve\\n4. **Historical precedent:** Films at 6-11% after 20 reviews rarely exceed 20-25% final scores\\n\\nFactors that could push score higher (to 15-20% range):\\n1. **Regional/smaller market critics:** May be more sympathetic, adding a few \"Fresh\" reviews\\n2. **International critics:** Some non-US outlets may view differently\\n3. **Contrarian takes:** A few critics might argue for \"camp value\" or \"fascinating as propaganda\"\\n\\nFactors that could push score lower (back toward 5-10% range):\\n1. **Additional major dailies:** If Washington Post, LA Times file negative reviews\\n2. **Late-filing prestige critics:** Could reinforce negative consensus\\n\\nMost likely scenario: Score stabilizes in 12-18% range by Feb 13, with 35-45 total reviews. The current 10-11% represents a slight rebound from the nadir; a few more moderate reviews will likely appear, but the overwhelming critical consensus is established.\\n\\n## Outside view calibration:\\n\\nThe current score of 10-11% with 20 reviews provides a strong anchor. Historical analysis of RT score evolution suggests:\\n\\n- **10th percentile (pessimistic):** Score drops back or stays flat at 8-10% if remaining major critics are uniformly negative\\n- **50th percentile (median):** Score rises modestly to 13-15% as mix of negative and few moderate reviews accumulate\\n- **90th percentile (optimistic):** Score reaches 18-22% if several contrarian or regional critics file positive reviews\\n\\nThe distribution should be slightly right-skewed (more upside than downside potential) because:\\n1. Score already hit its nadir at 6% and rebounded\\n2. Remaining reviews more likely to include regional/smaller outlets that may be less harsh\\n3. Some critics may find \"so bad it\\'s interesting\" angle\\n\\nHowever, the range must stay relatively tight because:\\n1. 20 reviews is substantial sample size\\n2. Critical consensus is remarkably unified\\n3. Political documentaries with this reception pattern rarely shift dramatically\\n4. Only 12 days for additional reviews to accumulate\\n\\nSetting confidence intervals:\\n- 80% confidence interval (10th-90th percentile): 9% to 21%\\n- This reflects high confidence score stays in \"rotten\" territory but acknowledges modest upward drift possibility\\n- Upper bound constrained by historical patterns of films with similar early reception\\n- Lower bound acknowledges possibility of additional harsh reviews from remaining major outlets\\n\\nOutside View Prediction:\\nPercentile 10: 9\\nPercentile 20: 11\\nPercentile 40: 13\\nPercentile 60: 15\\nPercentile 80: 18\\nPercentile 90: 21', step2_output='Analysis:\\n\\n## (a) Source Analysis\\n\\n**Primary factual sources (high reliability):**\\n1. **Fox News (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 11% critics score, 99% verified audience score. Factual data point, though outlet has conservative bias.\\n2. **KRQE/Multiple outlets (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 10% Tomatometer from critics. Cross-verified across multiple entertainment news sources.\\n3. **Hollywood Reporter (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reports \"around 16 percent based on 16 reviews\" at time of publication. Earlier snapshot, fewer reviews.\\n4. **Daily Beast (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 11% Tomatometer, 99% Popcornmeter. Known for liberal bias but factual score reporting.\\n\\n**Key observations from sources:**\\n- Scores range 6-16% across different timestamps (Jan 30-Feb 1)\\n- Most recent consolidated reports (Feb 1) cluster at 10-11% with ~20 reviews\\n- All sources confirm extreme critic-audience split (critics ~10%, audience ~99%)\\n- No source reports scores rising; trend is stable or slightly declining\\n\\n**Expert opinions (identifiable):**\\n- Owen Gleiberman (Variety): \"cheeseball infomercial of staggering inertia\"\\n- Frank Scheck (Hollywood Reporter): \"fawns so lavishly...feels unpatriotic\"\\n- David A. Gross (FranchiseRe): calls it \"political investment\" not commercial venture\\n- Harry Enten (CNN data analyst): predicted 73% chance of <20% score pre-release\\n\\n**Quality assessment:**\\n- Factual score data: High confidence (multiple independent sources converge on 10-11%)\\n- Temporal precision: Current as of Feb 1, 2026 (today)\\n- Opinion vs. fact: Clear separation; critics universally negative but scores are objective metrics\\n\\n## (b) Evidence Analysis\\n\\n**STRONG evidence (large shifts justified):**\\n1. **Current score stability**: 10-11% with 20 reviews as of Feb 1. Historical pattern shows documentary scores rarely move >5 points after first weekend. Multiple independent sources confirm.\\n2. **Review velocity pattern**: Film opened Jan 30; by Feb 1 has 20 reviews. Typical documentary accumulates 60-80% of total reviews in first 7 days. Remaining 12 days likely adds 15-30 more reviews.\\n3. **Unanimous critical consensus**: Zero positive reviews from mainstream critics. Even lone positive review (London Evening Standard) gave 3/5 stars, which doesn\\'t qualify as \"Fresh\" (60%+ needed). This structural unanimity is extremely rare and sticky.\\n\\n**MODERATE evidence:**\\n1. **Reference class behavior**: Political hagiography documentaries (\"Hillary\\'s America\" 4%, \"Death of a Nation\" 0%) show scores stabilize low. Counter-examples of dramatic rises don\\'t exist in this category.\\n2. **Controversy factors**: Brett Ratner\\'s #MeToo allegations, Amazon\\'s $75M investment, timing with Minneapolis shootings - all generate negative press that may attract additional hostile reviews.\\n3. **Market expectations**: Prediction markets (Kalshi) gave 63-73% probability of <20% score pre-release. Markets were directionally correct.\\n\\n**WEAK evidence:**\\n1. **Audience score divergence**: 99% audience vs. 11% critics. This doesn\\'t predict critic score movement - it reflects political polarization, not quality reassessment.\\n2. **Box office performance**: $8M opening (better than expected) is commercially relevant but doesn\\'t influence critic scoring patterns.\\n\\n## (c) Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n**Prediction window**: 12 days (Feb 1 \u2192 Feb 13, 2026)\\n\\n**Review accumulation dynamics:**\\n- Days 1-3 (Jan 30-Feb 1): 20 reviews accumulated\\n- Days 4-7 (Feb 2-5): Expect 10-15 additional reviews (major outlets\\' second-wave)\\n- Days 8-14 (Feb 6-13): Expect 5-10 additional reviews (stragglers, niche outlets)\\n- Total expected by Feb 13: 35-45 reviews\\n\\n**If timeframe halved (6 days):**\\n- Would have ~30 reviews total\\n- Score likely 11-13% (less time for outlier positive reviews)\\n- Narrower confidence intervals (less uncertainty)\\n\\n**If timeframe doubled (24 days):**\\n- Would have ~50-60 reviews total\\n- Score likely 10-15% (more niche/ideological outlets weigh in)\\n- Wider confidence intervals (more room for unexpected positive clusters)\\n\\n## (d) Justification for Prediction Shifts\\n\\n**Starting point**: Outside view established 12% median with 10-90 range of 6-24%.\\n\\n**Adjustments based on inside view:**\\n\\n1. **Current anchor is stronger than anticipated** (+confidence, -uncertainty):\\n   - We have real data (10-11% with 20 reviews) vs. pure prediction\\n   - This is not a forecast of what score *will be* but what it *will remain*\\n   - Score stability in first 48 hours is highly predictive for documentaries\\n\\n2. **Critical unanimity is extreme** (-median slightly):\\n   - Zero \"Fresh\" reviews from 20 critics is remarkable\\n   - Even controversial docs usually get 1-2 sympathetic reviews early\\n   - This suggests ceiling is lower than outside view predicted\\n   - Adjust median from 12% \u2192 11%\\n\\n3. **Limited upside catalysts** (-upper tail):\\n   - No major film festivals scheduled before Feb 13\\n   - No critical re-evaluation cycle expected\\n   - Conservative outlets (Newsmax, etc.) may add 1-2 positive reviews but won\\'t shift aggregate significantly\\n   - Upper bound scenarios (>20%) require implausible influx of positive reviews\\n   - Reduce 90th percentile from 24% \u2192 19%\\n\\n4. **Downside risks remain** (maintain lower tail):\\n   - Additional major outlets (WaPo, NYT second reviewers) likely negative\\n   - Backlash reviews from feminist/anti-Trump critics may intensify\\n   - Technical possibility of score dipping to 8-9% if next 10 reviews are all negative\\n   - Maintain 10th percentile at 8%\\n\\n5. **Rotten Tomatoes methodology is stable**:\\n   - No indication of review purges or policy changes\\n   - Platform treats this as standard theatrical release\\n   - Score calculation is transparent and predictable\\n\\n**Why current circumstances differ from pure outside view:**\\n- Outside view was predictive (pre-release); we now have 20 actual reviews\\n- The extreme unanimity (0% fresh) is rarer than base rate suggested\\n- Time remaining (12 days) is sufficient for score stabilization but insufficient for dramatic reversal\\n\\n## Probability Calibration\\n\\n**Central tendency reasoning:**\\n- Current score: 10-11%\\n- Expected additional reviews: 15-25\\n- If next 15 reviews split 1 positive/14 negative (optimistic): 11% \u2192 11.4%\\n- If next 15 reviews are all negative (pessimistic): 11% \u2192 10.3%\\n- Most likely: 2-3 ideologically sympathetic reviews among next 20\\n- **Median prediction: 11%**\\n- **Mean prediction: 12%** (slightly higher due to right-skewed uncertainty)\\n\\n**Distribution shape:**\\n- Strong concentration around 10-13% (70% of probability mass)\\n- Left tail constrained by current 11% (can\\'t drop much below 8%)\\n- Right tail extends to ~22% (requires unlikely positive review cluster)\\n- Distribution is slightly right-skewed due to asymmetric risks\\n\\n**Percentile reasoning:**\\n1st percentile (8%): Requires aggressive negative review influx + possible RT recalculation\\n10th percentile (9%): Next 20 reviews are 95% negative\\n25th percentile (10%): Next 20 reviews are 85% negative  \\n50th percentile (11%): Next 20 reviews maintain current 5% positive rate\\n75th percentile (13%): Next 20 reviews are 15% positive (conservative outlets engage)\\n90th percentile (17%): Next 20 reviews are 25% positive (unlikely but possible)\\n99th percentile (22%): Requires improbable positive review surge from niche outlets\\n\\n**Uncertainty factors:**\\n- Unknown: Whether RT will add international critics (usually don\\'t for US docs)\\n- Unknown: If any major critic reverses or issues amended review (extremely rare)\\n- Unknown: Potential for coordinated positive review campaign from MAGA media\\n- Known: Mathematical constraints (with 20 negative reviews, need 30+ positive to reach 60%)\\n\\nChecklist:\\n1.

These can land anywhere from single digits to high scores, but advocacy films often get punished if they\u2019re seen as propaganda or low-craft.\\n3. **\u201cCelebrity/political figure PR vehicle\u201d documentaries** (hagiographies, controlled-access portraits): best fit. These often receive poor critical reception if they feel like ads rather than inquiry.\\n\\n**Chosen reference class:** (3) hagiographic/PR political documentaries with heavy subject control, released widely enough to attract mainstream critics.\\n\\nBase-rate expectation from that class: **low Tomatometer, commonly <30%, sometimes in single digits**, and scores tend to stay \u201cRotten\u201d even as more reviews arrive.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### (c) Timeframe analysis\\n- **Today:** 2026-02-01  \\n- **Resolution date:** 2026-02-13 (Metaculus will check on/after Feb 13)  \\n- **Time left:** ~12 days\\n\\nRotten Tomatoes early dynamics:\\n- With **~20 reviews**, the Tomatometer can still move, but it becomes **progressively harder** to shift a lot as the denominator grows.\\n- Over the next ~2 weeks, I\u2019d expect more reviews to post (regional outlets, late national reviews, possibly international). That usually **nudges** the score rather than flipping it\u2014unless the initial set was unusually unrepresentative.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### (d) Outside-view justification (baseline)\\nStart from the base rate for \u201ccontrolled-access political PR doc\u201d and then anchor to the *current observed* trajectory:\\n\\n- The film is already sitting around **10\u201311%** (Feb 1) after previously dipping to **~6%** (Jan 31). That implies: even after some additional reviews, it remains near the floor.\\n- To reach, say, **30%** by Feb 13, the film would need a *large share of incoming reviews* to be Fresh. With current critics\u2019 language (Variety/NPR/VF) describing it as \u201cinfomercial/propaganda/inert,\u201d a big swing upward seems unlikely.\\n- A small upward drift is plausible if later reviews are mildly less negative than the first wave (e.g., some 2.5/4 or 3/5 reviews that count as \u201cFresh\u201d). But given the strength of the negative consensus among prominent critics, the most likely outcome is **still in the 8\u201318% band**.\\n\\nSo my outside-view baseline for Feb 13 is: **low teens**, with meaningful uncertainty but limited upside.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOutside view calibration:\\n\\nI\u2019m aiming for a distribution that reflects:\\n- **Small-N volatility** (20 reviews is not huge), so allow movement of several points either way.\\n- **But** also reflect that moving from ~10% to even ~25% would require a fairly dramatic change in incoming-review mix, which is historically uncommon once major critics have weighed in strongly negative.\\n- Upset risk: occasional \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good / camp\u201d reassessments can produce a handful of Fresh late reviews, but it rarely overcomes a strong early Rotten consensus.\\n\\nI therefore set:\\n- A **wide 10\u201390 interval** spanning from low single digits to low/mid 30s.\\n- Median-ish mass in the low teens.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOutside View Prediction (Tomatometer % on Feb 13, 2026):\\nPercentile 10: 4  \\nPercentile 20: 7  \\nPercentile 40: 10  \\nPercentile 60: 14  \\nPercentile 80: 22  \\nPercentile 90: 34', step2_output='Analysis:\\n\\n### 1) Resolution criteria (make sure we\u2019re forecasting the right thing)\\nThis resolves to the **Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer (critics) score** for *Melania* **as observed on or after February 13, 2026**, when Metaculus checks the page.

Provides budget and content details, and a named critic\u2019s harsh assessment. Opinion is clearly labeled (culture critic), but indicates likely continued negative critical consensus.\\n- **The Globe and Mail (Jan 30, 2026)**: Major publication, credible reviewer. Provides an extremely negative review (opinion), supporting the idea that many professional critics will rate it \u201crotten.\u201d\\n- **The Hollywood Reporter (Jan 30, 2026)**: High-reliability trade. Critically important *factual* datapoint: reports RT score \u201caround 16% based on 16 reviews\u201d at that time, plus compiles many named critic takes (opinions) that are overwhelmingly negative.\\n- **Fox News (Feb 1, 2026)**: Mixed reliability due to framing, but the *reported numeric RT critics score (11%)* is straightforward and likely accurate. Also contrasts with 99% verified audience score (not our target).\\n- **The Daily Beast (Feb 1, 2026)**: Partisan tone, but the *RT score reporting (11%)* is likely accurate; includes box office and market anecdotes.\\n- **AskNews KRQE 13 (Feb 1, 2026)**: Local-TV syndication style, but cites NYT/industry figures; importantly reports *critics score around 10%* and describes demographics. Useful numeric anchor consistent with others.\\n- **AskNews ScreenRant / Us Weekly / Express / O Globo / Raw Story / TVA Nouvelles / Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al / Breitbart**: Variable reliability. Several report critics scores ranging **6% to 11%**; some appear to be capturing *moment-in-time* snapshots as the review count updates. Raw Story/Breitbart are highly slanted; I treat them mainly as noisy corroboration that the score is in the low teens/single digits rather than as precise measurement.\\n- **\u201cOutside view prediction\u201d block in prompt (Feb 1 access)**: A synthesis. I treat it as a helpful structured baseline, but not a primary source. Its key claim\u2014**~10-11% with ~20 reviews by Feb 1**\u2014matches multiple independent outlets.\\n\\n### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors affecting Feb 13 Tomatometer)\\n**Strong evidence**\\n1. **Multiple independent outlets converge on ~10-11% Tomatometer as of Feb 1** (Fox, Daily Beast, KRQE/NYT-style recap; plus other summaries). This is a direct measurement close to the resolution date and is hard to ignore.\\n2. **The review sample is already non-trivial (~16-20 critics)** and includes major outlets (Variety, THR, Guardian, etc.). Once big critics are in, large reversals are historically uncommon.\\n3. **Uniformly negative named-critic reception** across prestige publications (THR compilation; LAT/Globe reviews). Mechanism: Tomatometer is binary fresh/rotten; if most critics are calling it propaganda/boring, few will mark it \u201cfresh.\u201d\\n\\n**Moderate evidence**\\n4. **Trajectory noise early (reports of 6%, 8%, 10%, 11%, ~16%)** suggests the score can move a few points as denominator grows, but it\u2019s moving within a low band. Mechanism: with small-N, each fresh review moves the percent more.\\n5. **Polarizing political subject + \u201cauthorized/propaganda\u201d framing** tends to keep critics\u2019 scores low even if audience scores are high (consistent with current 99% verified audience). This matters because it reduces the chance of a late wave of \u201cfresh\u201d reappraisals.\\n\\n**Weak evidence**\\n6. **Box office strength / audience enthusiasm**: may encourage more critics to review it (increasing N) but doesn\u2019t imply higher critic approval.\\n7. **Protests/timing controversies**: could marginally worsen critical tone, but most critics already seem firmly negative.\\n\\n### (c) Timeframe analysis\\n- **Forecast horizon:** from **Feb 1 to Feb 13 = 12 days**.\\n- In 12 days, I expect the Tomatometer to **stabilize** further as more reviews post (likely ending somewhere around ~30-60 total critics, but uncertain).\\n- **If the timeframe were halved (to ~6 days):** I\u2019d expect even less movement from today\u2019s ~10-11%\u2014perhaps \u00b12-3 points.\\n- **If the timeframe were doubled (~24 days):** slightly more drift is possible (more long-tail critics), but big jumps are still unlikely given the already-established consensus; maybe +3 to +8 points at most in a plausible upside scenario.\\n\\n### (d) Justification (outside view \u2192 inside view)\\n**Outside view base rate:** Films that sit around **~10% Tomatometer after ~15-20 reviews** typically finish still \u201crotten,\u201d often **single digits to high teens**, with only modest regression upward unless there\u2019s a genuine split among critics (not evident here).\\n\\n**Inside view adjustment using current information:**\\n- The film\u2019s *current* measured score is already extremely low and repeatedly corroborated (**~10-11% on Feb 1**).\\n- The critical rhetoric is not \u201cmixed\u201d but \u201cscathing,\u201d which implies additional reviews are likely to be \u201crotten\u201d as well.\\n- Therefore I anchor near **12-14%** for Feb 13, with:\\n  - **Downside**: additional negative reviews from remaining major outlets could keep it near ~6-10%.\\n  - **Upside**: a trickle of contrarian/regional critics (or \u201cinteresting as artifact\u201d takes) could lift it into the high teens/low 20s, but a move above ~25% would require an implausibly high share of fresh reviews from here.\\n\\nProbability calibration\\n\\n- **Trend continuation (status quo):** stays about **10-13** as more reviews accumulate.\\n- **My median:** **13** (small upward drift from 10-11 as denominator grows and a few fresh reviews appear).\\n- **My mean:** about **14** (slight right-skew: more room to drift up to ~20+ than to collapse far below current levels, though both are possible).\\n- **Uncertainty:** still meaningful because of small-ish N and possible future review influx, so I keep a fairly wide 90/10 interval.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n1) Target variable: RT **Tomatometer critics score** for *Melania* as of/on/after **Feb 13 2026**, units percent.  \\n2) Outside view base rate: films at ~10% after ~20 reviews usually finish ~8-18.  \\n3) Consistency: Implied median = 13; mean = 14; consistent with \u201calready scathing, limited upside.\u201d  \\n4) Key evidence: (i) multiple reports of ~10-11% on Feb 1; (ii) many major critics already in; (iii) consensus language \u201cpropaganda/boring\u201d suggests continued rotten reviews; (iv) early fluctuations (6-16%) imply a few-point drift possible.  \\n5) Blind spot: a surprisingly large wave of *fresh* reviews from mid-tier/regional critics pushing it into mid/high-20s (would push outcome up).\\n\\nDistribution:\\nPercentile 1: 4  \\nPercentile 5: 6  \\nPercentile 10: 8  \\nPercentile 20: 10  \\nPercentile 40: 12  \\nPercentile 60: 14  \\nPercentile 80: 17  \\nPercentile 90: 20  \\nPercentile 95: 23  \\nPercentile 99: 28', error=None, probability=None, probabilities=None, percentiles={1: 4.0, 5: 6.0, 10: 8.0, 20: 10.0, 40: 12.0, 60: 14.0, 80: 17.0, 90: 20.0, 95: 23.0, 99: 28.0}, cdf=[0.2, 0.2311424247738808, 0.2702513345039859, 0.313182318329064, 0.35658302684231763, 0.3977429489188341, 0.43845860060680836, 0.4804808652523057, 0.5217472605705648, 0.5605518176278756, 0.5954858978376681, 0.6276151948417804, 0.6585353202834477, 0.687878428689901, 0.7153386806996557, 0.7406629102784817, 0.7636427821955868, 0.7841081802528047, 0.8020994795816079, 0.8186236102721389, 0.8338870411377798, 0.8479240512353821, 0.8607684599623054, 0.872453521089741, 0.883011841666729, 0.8924753212159194, 0.9010664434289498, 0.9090064767864141, 0.9163236602879147, 0.923044627052727, 0.929194519628033, 0.9347970952918283, 0.9398748223655061, 0.9444887117880592, 0.9488840673443454, 0.9530872577456311, 0.9570851564609515, 0.9608662486126521, 0.9644204707651628, 0.9677390673990689, 0.9708144621744348, 0.9736401423235539, 0.9762105547173862, 0.9785210123266456, 0.9805676099517864, 0.9823471482293947, 0.9824465214666245, 0.9825458947038542, 0.982645267941084, 0.9827446411783137, 0.9828440144155435, 0.9829433876527732, 0.983042760890003, 0.9831421341272327, 0.9832415073644625, 0.9833408806016922, 0.983440253838922, 0.9835396270761517, 0.9836390003133815, 0.9837383735506112, 0.983837746787841, 0.9839371200250707, 0.9840364932623005, 0.9841358664995302, 0.98423523973676, 0.9843346129739897, 0.9844339862112195, 0.9845333594484492, 0.984632732685679, 0.9847321059229087, 0.9848314791601385, 0.9849308523973682, 0.985030225634598, 0.9851295988718277, 0.9852289721090575, 0.9853283453462872, 0.985427718583517, 0.9855270918207467, 0.9856264650579765, 0.9857258382952062, 0.985825211532436, 0.9859245847696657, 0.9860239580068955, 0.9861233312441252, 0.986222704481355, 0.9863220777185847, 0.9864214509558145, 0.9865208241930442, 0.986620197430274, 0.9867195706675037, 0.9868189439047335, 0.9869183171419632, 0.987017690379193, 0.9871170636164227, 0.9872164368536525, 0.9873158100908822, 0.987415183328112, 0.9875145565653417, 0.9876139298025715, 0.9877133030398012, 0.987812676277031, 0.9879120495142607, 0.9880114227514905, 0.9881107959887202, 0.98821016922595, 0.9883095424631797, 0.9884089157004095, 0.9885082889376392, 0.988607662174869, 0.9887070354120987, 0.9888064086493284, 0.9889057818865582, 0.989005155123788, 0.9891045283610177, 0.9892039015982474, 0.9893032748354772, 0.989402648072707, 0.9895020213099367, 0.9896013945471664, 0.9897007677843962, 0.989800141021626, 0.9898995142588557, 0.9899988874960854, 0.9900982607333152, 0.9901976339705449, 0.9902970072077747, 0.9903963804450044, 0.9904957536822342, 0.9905951269194639, 0.9906945001566937, 0.9907938733939234, 0.9908932466311532, 0.9909926198683829, 0.9910919931056127, 0.9911913663428424, 0.9912907395800722, 0.9913901128173019, 0.9914894860545317, 0.9915888592917614, 0.9916882325289912, 0.9917876057662209, 0.9918869790034507, 0.9919863522406804, 0.9920857254779102, 0.9921850987151399, 0.9922844719523697, 0.9923838451895994, 0.9924832184268292, 0.9925825916640589, 0.9926819649012887, 0.9927813381385184, 0.9928807113757482, 0.9929800846129779, 0.9930794578502077, 0.9931788310874374, 0.9932782043246672, 0.9933775775618969, 0.9934769507991267, 0.9935763240363564, 0.9936756972735862, 0.9937750705108159, 0.9938744437480457, 0.9939738169852754, 0.9940731902225052, 0.9941725634597349, 0.9942719366969647, 0.9943713099341944, 0.9944706831714242, 0.9945700564086539, 0.9946694296458837, 0.9947688028831134, 0.9948681761203432, 0.9949675493575729, 0.9950669225948027, 0.9951662958320324, 0.9952656690692622, 0.9953650423064919, 0.9954644155437217, 0.9955637887809514, 0.9956631620181812, 0.9957625352554109, 0.9958619084926407, 0.9959612817298704, 0.9960606549671002, 0.9961600282043299, 0.9962594014415597, 0.9963587746787894, 0.9964581479160192, 0.9965575211532489, 0.9966568943904787, 0.9967562676277084, 0.9968556408649382, 0.9969550141021679, 0.9970543873393977, 0.9971537605766274, 0.9972531338138572, 0.9973525070510869, 0.9974518802883167, 0.9975512535255464, 0.9976506267627762, 0.9977500000000059])",

Secondary sources; useful as corroboration.\\n\\nNo later sources (Feb 2 \u2013 13) yet available, so the latest hard datapoint is 11 % on ~20 critic reviews as of 1 Feb 2026.\\n\\n(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)\\n\\nStrong evidence  \\n\u2022 Multiple independent snapshots (HR, Fox, Daily Beast, wires) agree the Tomatometer is in the 6-11 % band (direction: very low).  \\n\u2022 Historical pattern: once a documentary opens with <20 % on \u226430 reviews, final score almost always stays \u201crotten\u201d (<60 %) and usually remains within \u00b18 points of the opening week value.  \\n\u2022 Structural factor: critics of record (NYT, WaPo, Variety, Guardian, THR) have already filed; their verdict is locked in and carries heavy weight in the denominator.\\n\\nModerate evidence  \\n\u2022 Review count still low (~20) \u2192 each new Fresh review would move the percentage \u2248 4-5 points, so some volatility persists.  \\n\u2022 A handful of niche or politically sympathetic outlets may publish friendlier takes once the theatrical window expands, nudging the score upward.  \\n\u2022 Very wide critic / audience split could prompt a few contrarian \u201cit isn\u2019t THAT bad\u201d reviews.\\n\\nWeak evidence  \\n\u2022 Rumours of coordinated positive reviews (audience side) \u2013 do not affect critic score.  \\n\u2022 Box-office performance (better than feared) \u2013 critics rarely revise ratings post-hoc.  \\n\u2022 Possibility of additional festival or streaming cuts generating new critic reviews by 13 Feb \u2013 unlikely in 12 days.\\n\\n(c) Timeframe analysis  \\nTime until resolution: 12 days.  Expect 5-15 additional critic reviews (typical for a wide-release doc).  If doubled (24 days) I would widen the upper tail slightly (more chances for sympathetic pieces).  If halved (6 days) I would narrow variance; less time for movement.\\n\\n(d) Justification & inside-view shift  \\nOutside-view base rate for glossy political hagiography docs: median \u2248 18 %, 80 % range 5-35 %.  \\nCurrent hard data (11 %) sits below that median; strong negative unanimity from top critics suggests the film is performing at the very bottom of its reference class.  Given small-N volatility I allow for a 4-8 point upward drift (contrarian or niche reviews) and a slim chance (<10 %) of a major downward dip if more pans arrive.  This yields a median of 12 \u2013 13 %, 10\u201390 band roughly 5 \u2013 26 %.\\n\\nProbability calibration\\nImplied median \u2248 12.5; mean \u2248 15 (right-tailed).  Reflects high likelihood of staying near present value, with modest upside variance from future Fresh reviews.\\n\\nChecklist:\\n1.

is 55 years old, came from Slovenia as a teenage fashion model\n\n**Critic's Assessment:**\nThe review is highly negative, describing the documentary as:\n- \"A cheeseball infomercial of staggering inertia\" that \"never comes to life\"\n- \"So orchestrated and airbrushed and stage-managed that it barely rises to the level of a shameless infomercial\"\n- \"Inert\" with \"no drama,\" compared to \"the most innocuous outtakes from a reality show\"\n- \"Studiously celebratory, like a piece of state-sanctioned propaganda out of 1960s Communist China\"\n- \"A designed-from-the-top-down reality show that's devoted to shutting reality out\"\n\n**Content Description:**\n- Portrays Melania Trump primarily as a designer (helping with outfit designs, choosing scarlet-colored inaugural invitation

summarize critical consensus trends since Jan 29 premiere\nBased on every date-stamped article in the current results set, the latest public, source-verifiable Rotten Tomatoes numbers for Brett Ratner\u2019s 2026 documentary \u201cMelania\u201d are:\n\n\u2022 Tomatometer score: 10 %\u201311 %, status \u201cRotten\u201d.  \n  \u2013 ComicBook.com reports 10 % as of 1 Feb 2026, explicitly adding \u201cwith 20 critic reviews\u201d (ComicBook.com, 1 Feb 2026).  \n  \u2013 Fox News, USA Today and The Daily Beast all say 11 % on the same calendar date, but none of them specify how many reviews that figure is based on (Fox News, 1 Feb 2026; USA Today, 1 Feb 2026; Daily Beast, 1 Feb 2026).\n\n\u2022 Verified critic-review count: 20 reviews is the most recent hard number available, supplied by ComicBook.com on 1 Feb 2026. No later article or the truncated Rotten Tomatoes page snippet in the search results discloses a newer tally.\n\nBecause Rotten Tomatoes updates continuously and its landing page in the search results withholds the scoreboard, these 1 Feb figures are the latest that can be cited with documentation from the material provided.\n\nTrajectory of the Tomatometer since the 29 Jan premiere\n\n1. 29 Jan 2026 \u2013 Invite-only Kennedy Center premiere; mainstream critics were barred. Variety\u2019s recap (quoted by ScreenRant) indicates Rotten Tomatoes still read \u201cNo score yet\u201d at the end of the night (ScreenRant, 31 Jan 2026).\n\n2. Opening day, 30 Jan \u2013 The first wave of reviews pushed the score into single digits: USA Today logged an early 8 % (USA Today, 30 Jan coverage cited in ScreenRant), while Us Weekly captured 9 % later that morning (ScreenRant, 31 Jan). Rough math suggests roughly a dozen notices, with only one counted as \u201cFresh\u201d.\n\n3. 31 Jan \u2013 As more national outlets filed, the Tomatometer bottomed out.

Identification of which additional reviews turned the dial from 6 % to 10\u201311 %.  \n3. Forthcoming reviews from large U.S. dailies and overseas publications that could move the needle again.  \n4. Whether Rotten Tomatoes will ultimately post an official Critics\u2019 Consensus blurb (none is quoted yet).\n\nTo close those gaps, a direct check of the Rotten Tomatoes page or screenshots archived after 1 Feb would be required; no article in the present search results provides newer, citable data.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs of the most recent verifiable reporting (1 Feb 2026), \u201cMelania\u201d holds a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer of approximately 10 %\u201311 %, derived from 20 published critic reviews, cementing it as one of the worst-reviewed wide-release documentaries in recent memory. The score\u2019s day-by-day history shows an initial single-digit debut, a plunge to 6 %, and a slight rebound once a handful of milder notices appeared. The overwhelming through-line of the commentary is that the film functions as lavish propaganda, marred further by inert filmmaking; only a couple of outlets find limited merit as a curated self-portrait. Meanwhile, the audience score remains an off-the-charts 98\u201399 %, creating a record-setting critic-versus-viewer divide and fuelling the secondary media narrative around the documentary. Unless and until additional, independently sourced data emerge, these 1 Feb figures stand as the current consensus snapshot.</Agent_report>\n",

The nearly two-hour film, directed by Brett Ratner, chronicles the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration from the perspective of First Lady Melania Trump, portraying her orchestration of inauguration plans, transition to the White House, and family relocation. It premiered in 1,778 theaters, with 53% of ticket sales coming from Republican counties and top-selling states predicted to be Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Research firm EntTelligence estimated 46% of sales came from rural areas, and 72% of the audience was female and over age 55. Despite strong commercial performance, critical reception was overwhelmingly negative: the film holds a 10% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, with reviews calling it a 'cheese ball informercial of staggering inertia' (Owen Gleiberman, Variety), a 'medieval tribute to placate the greedy king on his throne' (Xan Brooks, The Guardian), and a 'hagiography' that insults the genre (Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter). In contrast, verified user reviews gave it a 99% score, earning a 'Hot' Popcornmeter ranking. The film did not screen for critics in advance. International ticket sales were expected to be minimal. The documentary's release follows Ratner\u2019s return to filmmaking after being exiled from Hollywood since 2017 due to sexual misconduct allegations, which he denies. His prior involvement with 'Rush Hour 4' was revived after a reported intervention by Donald Trump. Amazon has not yet announced a streaming release date. David A. Gross of FranchiseRe described the film as a 'political investment' rather than a profit-driven venture, noting that $75 million is insignificant to Amazon if it serves regulatory or governmental interests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:38 PM\nSource:[KRQE 13](https://www.krqe.com/news/national/melania-documentary-debuts-with-strong-ticket-sales-low-ratings-from-critics/)\n\n**'Melania' buried with low critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, scores 99% with verified audience**\nMelania Trump's documentary 'Melania' received a 11% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes as of February 1, 2026, despite scoring 99% with verified audience reviews.

He argues that critics, driven by political ideology, are unable to objectively evaluate the film due to their emotional resistance to its narrative\u2014a story of an immigrant woman rising from a working-class Communist background to become First Lady of the United States. Nolte portrays the film as a biographical triumph, praising Melania Trump's character as 'pure class' and 'the stuff of legend,' while accusing critics of reacting with 'tantrums' and 'hate' rather than thoughtful analysis. He dismisses critical reviews as indicative of the critics' own 'fascist politics' and 'emotional children' behavior, suggesting that their focus on trivial elements\u2014such as Melania removing her heels at 2 a.m. on Inauguration Day\u2014reveals their lack of professional integrity. The film premiered on January 29, 2026, at the Trump-Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and is produced by Amazon MGM Studios. Nolte also references the film's popularity among everyday audiences, noting it has garnered five-star reviews on platforms like Amazon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:07 AM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/31/nolte-rotten-tomatoes-audiences-rave-for-melania-with-98-rating-while-bitter-critics-try-to-destroy-it/)\n\n**Melania Trump doc savaged in brutal reviews with awful 11% Rotten Tomatoes score**\nMelania Trump's documentary, titled 'Melania: 20 Days to History,' was released on January 30, 2026, and chronicles her life during the 20 days preceding her husband Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration. The film aims to showcase her journey to becoming First Lady, featuring her reflections on maintaining 'mental strength' and her praise for Trump, including the statement: 'Nobody has endured what he has for the last few years. Here he is, I'm so very proud.' Despite her and Trump's public support, including attending the premiere together, the documentary received overwhelmingly negative reviews. As of February 1, 2026, it held a 11% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with numerous one-star reviews describing it as 'terrible,' 'orchestrated and airbrushed,' and 'lazy patchwork.' Critics, including one who compared director Brett Ratner to someone unable to find humanity in a funeral, questioned the film\u2019s depth and authenticity. A few positive reviews praised it as 'excellent' and 'classy,' but they were vastly outnumbered.

However, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, scoring just 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the lowest ratings in the site\u2019s history, even lower than 'Cats' (2019), which had a 9% approval rating. Critics widely labeled the film as propaganda, superficial, and lacking narrative depth. Owen Gleiberman of Variety called it 'so orchestrated, polished, and directed that it barely rises above a blatant infomercial.' Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter criticized its excessive adulation of Melania Trump, stating viewers 'feel almost unpatriotic for not starting to venerate her.' Xan Brooks of The Guardian described the experience as 'two hours with Melania [that] feel like an endless hell,' while Nick Hilton of The Independent called it 'a sullen void with nothing but propaganda,' portraying Melania as a 'vacuum of pure insignificance.' Despite this, audience reception was polarized: the public gave the film an A on CinemaScore and a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014among the highest for the top 10 films of the weekend\u2014creating one of the largest critical-audience divides on the platform. The film is projected to rank third at the box office, behind 'Socorro!' and 'Iron Lung,' and ahead of Jason Statham\u2019s 'Shelter.'

However, this assertion was quickly challenged by public and media scrutiny. The Guardian reported that the film screened in Times Square with only 12 attendees, and audience reactions were unimpressed. Critics and commentators responded with skepticism and mockery, including columnist Jackie Calmes calling it an 'alternate reality,' ex-GOP insider Jeff Timmer writing 'lol,' comedian Ryan Cullen noting Donald Trump likely wouldn't retweet it, and journalist Fredrik Gr\u00e6svik stating the First Lady is 'just as detached from reality as the president.'

This is the lowest score among new films in theaters, significantly lower than 'Get Help' (94%) and 'Shelter' (64%). The film, financed by Amazon with a total budget of $40 million, has drawn harsh criticism from reviewers. Donald Clarke of the Irish Times described it as 'an overt propaganda' that induces 'narcolepsy' rather than inspiring mass rallies, calling it 'The Triumph of Boredom.' William Bibbiani of The Wrap criticized it for lacking humanity, stating Brett Ratner could not find any in a funeral.

The film, produced by Amazon and financed with a total budget of $40 million\u2014partially funded by Jeff Bezos's company\u2014chronicles the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. Despite its high production cost, the film has drawn harsh criticism from reviewers. Donald Clarke of the Irish Times described it as 'an unashamed propaganda... aiming more to induce narcolepsy than galvanize mass rallies,' while William Bibbiani of The Wrap wrote, 'I have no idea why she agreed to this film, as Brett Ratner couldn't find humanity in a funeral.' CNN data chief Harry Enten predicted modest box office earnings of between $1 and $5 million. Although 'Melania' is among the worst-reviewed films currently in theaters, it is not the worst in Rotten Tomatoes history; films like 'Becks vs. Sever: Deadly Showdown' (2002) have received a 0% score. In contrast, other recent films such as Sam Raimi's 'Get Help' earned 94% and Jason Statham's 'Shelter' scored 64%.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:56 PM\nSource:[TVA Nouvelles](https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2026/01/31/le-film-sur-melania-trump-obtient-une-note-pourrie-de-6-sur-rotten-tomatoes)\n\n**Melania Trump Documentary Debuts To Disastrous Rotten Tomatoes Score**\nMelania Trump's documentary, directed by Brett Ratner and produced with a $75 million budget, debuted to an 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, marking a critical failure. The film, which was promoted as a behind-the-scenes look at Melania Trump preparing to return to the White House ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration, faced immediate controversy, including Amazon banning press access during its Kennedy Center screening. Critics widely condemned the documentary, with The Guardian calling it 'trash' and 'endless hell,' and The Atlantic labeling it a 'disgrace.' Many reviews accused the film of being desperate propaganda and criticized its pacing and lack of payoff. Despite the overwhelmingly negative reception, The London Evening Standard gave it 3 out of 5 stars, praising Melania Trump\u2019s appearance as 'stunning' for her age. The documentary is currently playing in select theaters, and its release has sparked significant debate over political media and documentary ethics.

Acquired by Amazon MGM Studios in a $40 million deal, the film chronicles the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's 2025 presidential inauguration, portraying Melania's journey into becoming First Lady. President Trump praised the film, calling it 'really great' and highlighting its 'glamour' that he believes the country needs. However, critics have largely panned the documentary: Variety called it a 'shameless infomercial' with no drama, while The Hollywood Reporter labeled it an 'expensive propaganda doc.' On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 9% critics' score, with no certified fresh rating, and an audience score not yet available due to insufficient reviews. The London Evening Standard offered a more favorable take, noting Melania's 'human warmth' and striking appearance at age 55. Some Rotten Tomatoes users praised the film's cinematography, heartfelt moments, and soundtrack, while others, including an unverified reviewer, criticized it as a 'high-gloss vanity mirror' lacking insight. Melania stated she wanted to showcase the extensive planning behind transitioning from private citizen to First Lady, emphasizing pride in every detail. Director Brett Ratner confirmed Melania had a 'theatrical, big-screen vision' and urged him not to hold back during production.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:07 AM\nSource:[Us Weekly](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/melania-trumps-controversial-documentary-slammed-by-critic-reviews/)\n\n**Data analyst predicts brutal reception for Melania Trump's movie: 'Dead last!'**\nCNN's chief data analyst, Harry Enten, predicted a poor critical and commercial reception for Melania Trump's documentary 'Melania,' which premiered on Friday, January 30, 2026. Despite Amazon MGM Studios spending $75 million on the film\u2014$40 million for production and $35 million on marketing\u2014the film is forecasted to earn between $1 million and $5 million in its opening weekend, far below the $41 million adjusted for inflation earned by the highest-grossing documentary, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' Enten cited weak advance ticket sales, with single-digit figures in many theaters, and unfavorable pre-release critical reviews. He stated there is a 73% chance the film will score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating strong negative critical reception, and a low probability of achieving a 'fresh' score (above 60%). Enten attributed the expected failure to widespread belief that the film is of low quality. He also noted that Melania Trump ranks dead last among U.S. first ladies in historical rankings, alongside Jane Pierce and Margaret Taylor, reinforcing the perception of her low historical esteem.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/melania-trump-movie-critics/)\n\n**Melania Trump's Documentary Faces Box Office Flop Amid Political Backlash and Low Pre-Sales**\nThe documentary 'Melania,' produced by Amazon MGM Studios and centered on First Lady Melania Trump, is projected to underperform at the box office, with estimates ranging from 1 million to 5 million dollars in its opening weekend\u2014far below the 75 million dollars invested in production and marketing. Despite President Trump's insistence that the film would be a 'clamorous success' and his aggressive promotion on Truth Social, ticket pre-sales remain low, with no tickets sold at the largest cinema in Boston. The film's premiere at the White House was attended by 70 prominent figures, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose presence drew backlash after a controversial incident involving the killing of a 37-year-old veteran in Minneapolis, which the Trump administration falsely labeled as terrorism. Critics, including conservative strategist Rick Wilson and Hollywood insider Veronica Villafane, argue the film is a sycophantic project by Amazon to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially given Jeff Bezos\u2019s simultaneous layoffs at The Washington Post. Analyst Harry Enten of CNN estimates a 63% chance the film will receive a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Experts believe the film's potential failure could amplify public frustration toward the Trump administration. Melania Trump is expected to earn 28 million dollars from licensing rights regardless of box office performance. The documentary will be followed by a three-part Amazon Prime series set for release by late 2026.

As of January 28, 2026, the film had over 100 reviews and a 2.5-star rating out of 5, despite being unreleased to the public. Users have posted scathing, often politically charged reviews\u2014some stating they won\u2019t watch or pirate the film to ensure it becomes the lowest-rated movie of all time. The backlash stems from multiple factors: Ratner\u2019s 2017 sexual assault allegations (which he denies), his association with the Epstein files, Amazon\u2019s $40 million purchase and $35 million promotional spend, and the film\u2019s premiere occurring the same night federal agents shot 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. The reviews initially vanished from Letterboxd on January 27 due to a technical error involving an incorrect premiere date, but were restored by January 28. The film has already been added to over 330 user-created lists, including 'Tomorrow's Trash,' 'Trump Era Cinema,' and 'Movie blacklist.' CNN data expert Harry Enten predicts a 63% chance the film will score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary, which claims to offer 'unprecedented access' to Melania Trump during the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration, is set to premiere in 2,000 U.S. theaters and 3,000 worldwide, with 100 UK theaters reporting 'soft' ticket sales.

On CNN's OutFront, Enten cited low projected opening weekend earnings of $1 million to $5 million, far below the $41 million debut of 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time adjusted for inflation. He also highlighted a strong prediction that the film would score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a majority chance of such a low rating. Burnett added that public scrutiny might expose any artificial ticket-purchasing efforts, and both emphasized that the film's financial prospects are dim compared to its massive budget.

Despite President Donald Trump's claim that tickets are 'selling out, FAST' and Amazon's $75 million investment in production and marketing, ticket sales in major U.S. and U.K. cities show near-empty theaters, with social media users sharing screenshots of zero or minimal seat sales at AMC theaters in Boston, Jacksonville, and Times Square. The film, directed by Brett Ratner\u2014a figure accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 but never charged\u2014has drawn controversy, particularly due to a high-profile black-tie White House premiere attended by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, and Mike Tyson, which occurred hours after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Enten questioned the alignment between Amazon\u2019s financial gains\u2014Jeff Bezos\u2019s wealth grew by $35 billion since early November 2024\u2014and the film\u2019s weak market reception, suggesting a possible correlation. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump over 20 days before her husband\u2019s inauguration, was marketed as an 'inside look' at the First Lady, but public interest appears low, with Vue CEO Tim Richards reporting 'soft' sales in the U.K., including just one ticket sold for a 3:10 p.m. screening in London\u2019s Islington branch.

Enten stated that the film's opening weekend is forecasted to earn only $1\u20135 million, significantly below the $41 million earned by 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time in its opening weekend. He also highlighted that the probability of 'Melania' receiving a Rotten Tomatoes score below 20% stands at a majority, based on prediction market odds, signaling strong skepticism about its critical reception. Despite President Trump's claim that tickets are selling fast, Enten expressed doubt, stating, 'I don't think the president is going to be right.' Reports also indicate that theaters are facing large numbers of unsold seats, and even some crew members hope the film fails.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Critical Reception\nCritics have universally panned the documentary, describing it as:\n- \"An orchestrated, airbrushed shameless infomercial\" with no substantive insights [1][4][9][10]\n- \"Dull,\" \"terrible,\" and \"pure, endless hell\" that ranks among the worst-reviewed films in history [3]\n- \"Exhaustingly boring and chillingly vain\" with \"no emotional heft\" [3][7]\n- \"Fascist propaganda\" and compared to Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi-era work [2][11]\n- An \"expensive vanity project\" lacking journalistic distance, with Melania reportedly retaining full editorial control [9][15]\n\nProminent critics were particularly brutal:\n- Variety's Owen Gleiberman called it \"a brutal disconnect\" that fails as cinema [4][7][10]\n- The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck noted it \"fawns so lavishly over its subject it feels unpatriotic not to be impressed\" [10]\n- BuzzFeed's Stephanie McNeal declared it \"the worst film I've ever seen\" [7]\n- Irish Times' Donald Clarke labeled it \"The Triumph of Boredom\" [5][6]\n\n### Rotten Tomatoes Score\nAs of late January/early February 2026:\n- **Critics Score:** Ranges between 6-11% (\"Rotten\") based on 15-17 reviews [1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9]:\n  - Most reports show 7-11% initially [1][3][7]\n  - Later settled at 6-8% as more reviews came in [4][5]\n- **Audience Score:** Shows a shocking 99% approval based on 100+ verified ratings [2][3][7]\n\nThis creates one of Rotten Tomatoes' largest-ever gaps (92 points) between critics and audiences [7]. The film shares its dismal critics score with infamous flops like \"Catwoman\" (8%) and \"Becks vs. Sever\" (0%) [5][6].\n\n### Key Context\n1. **Political Polarization:** The radical score split reflects America's political divide, with critics lambasting it as propaganda while supporters praise its \"patriotism\" and \"class\" [2][4][7]\n2. **Ratner Controversy:** The director's history of sexual misconduct allegations significantly impacted reception, with critics attacking Amazon for enabling his \"comeback\" [11][13][17]\n3. **Box Office Failure:** Despite Trump's \"MUST WATCH\" endorsements, it earned just $1-8 million opening weekend against $75M+ costs [5][7][14][17]\n4. **Historical Context:** Historians rank Melania last among First Ladies, which colored critical expectations [14]\n\n### Limitations\nThe polarized responses and Ratner's controversial reputation make objective assessment difficult. Critics largely dismissed it as political theater rather than cinema [10][15], while audience scores may reflect culture-war positioning rather than cinematic merit [2][4].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
