Analysis:
The film “Melania” premiered only three days ago (Kennedy Center, 29 Jan 2026) and opened wide yesterday (30 Jan 2026). The key pieces of information needed now are:

1. Early-critic reviews from reputable outlets (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, NYT, WaPo, Guardian, etc.).
2. The initial Rotten Tomatoes (RT) Tomatometer score—often posted as soon as 5-10 reviews are in.
3. Any evidence of rapid score movement over opening weekend.
4. Contextual factors that could bias critics upward or downward:  
   • Brett Ratner’s past #MeToo allegations (could lower scores).  
   • Political polarization around a First Lady–produced project (possible review-bombing or “rally-round” effects).  
   • Amazon MGM’s marketing push and lavish premiere (could increase number of reviews quickly).  
5. Comparison with similar high-profile political docs (e.g., “Hillary,” “American Dharma,” “Fahrenheit 11/9”) to calibrate where a partisan subject usually lands on RT (typically 40–80 %).

Relevant current info will likely be found in:
• Film-critic trade publications published after the premiere (Variety, THR, IndieWire).  
• General newspapers’ Arts & Culture sections dated 30 Jan – 1 Feb 2026.  
• RottenTomatoes.com itself (for the live score).  
• Box-office coverage (Deadline, Box Office Mojo) that often cites RT scores.
