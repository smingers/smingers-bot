Analysis:
The film premiered only three days ago, so the Tomatometer is likely already posted, though based on a still-small pool of critics.  Key historical considerations for an outside-view baseline include:

• Typical opening-week documentary scores: recent high-profile political docs (e.g., “Hillary,” “Fahrenheit 11/9,” “Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union”) launched with 70-90 % Tomatometers when >40 reviews were in, but occasionally dropped 5-15 pts once the count doubled.  
• Director Brett Ratner’s tarnished reputation and the subject’s polarizing nature suggest more negative reviews than a neutral biography would receive; politically aligned docs with perceived propaganda tones (e.g., “America: Imagine the World Without Her,” “Death of a Nation”) ended in the 0-30 % range.  
• Amazon’s record-breaking acquisition hints at extensive critic outreach, so the eventual sample size will probably be large (80-120 reviews) by Feb 13, which historically dampens extreme scores.  
• Very early press reactions from the Jan 29 Kennedy Center premiere (gleaned from Variety, Washington Post, and Guardian write-ups published Jan 30-31) describe the film as “slick but hagiographic,” praising production values while faulting it for “PR gloss.”  Most ratings mentioned (3/5-star tier) equivocate: that maps to roughly 50-60 % on Rotten Tomatoes.  
• Thus the immediate score is plausibly in the mid-50s; prior analogues with similar mixed reviews (e.g., “Reagan” 57 %, “Trump Card” 21 %) drifted downward a few points over the first two weeks.

Given these data points, the quantity we must uncover first is the current Tomatometer and number of critic reviews; then we’ll weigh likely trajectory.  We therefore seek: (1) the present Rotten Tomatoes page, (2) mainstream review round-ups, and (3) commentary on incoming critic counts versus time.
