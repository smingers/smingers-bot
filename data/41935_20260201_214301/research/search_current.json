The nearly two-hour film, directed by Brett Ratner, chronicles the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration from the perspective of First Lady Melania Trump, portraying her orchestration of inauguration plans, transition to the White House, and family relocation. It premiered in 1,778 theaters, with 53% of ticket sales coming from Republican counties and top-selling states predicted to be Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Research firm EntTelligence estimated 46% of sales came from rural areas, and 72% of the audience was female and over age 55. Despite strong commercial performance, critical reception was overwhelmingly negative: the film holds a 10% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, with reviews calling it a 'cheese ball informercial of staggering inertia' (Owen Gleiberman, Variety), a 'medieval tribute to placate the greedy king on his throne' (Xan Brooks, The Guardian), and a 'hagiography' that insults the genre (Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter). In contrast, verified user reviews gave it a 99% score, earning a 'Hot' Popcornmeter ranking. The film did not screen for critics in advance. International ticket sales were expected to be minimal. The documentary's release follows Ratner\u2019s return to filmmaking after being exiled from Hollywood since 2017 due to sexual misconduct allegations, which he denies. His prior involvement with 'Rush Hour 4' was revived after a reported intervention by Donald Trump. Amazon has not yet announced a streaming release date. David A. Gross of FranchiseRe described the film as a 'political investment' rather than a profit-driven venture, noting that $75 million is insignificant to Amazon if it serves regulatory or governmental interests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:38 PM\nSource:[KRQE 13](https://www.krqe.com/news/national/melania-documentary-debuts-with-strong-ticket-sales-low-ratings-from-critics/)\n\n**'Melania' buried with low critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, scores 99% with verified audience**\nMelania Trump's documentary 'Melania' received a 11% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes as of February 1, 2026, despite scoring 99% with verified audience reviews.

He argues that critics, driven by political ideology, are unable to objectively evaluate the film due to their emotional resistance to its narrative\u2014a story of an immigrant woman rising from a working-class Communist background to become First Lady of the United States. Nolte portrays the film as a biographical triumph, praising Melania Trump's character as 'pure class' and 'the stuff of legend,' while accusing critics of reacting with 'tantrums' and 'hate' rather than thoughtful analysis. He dismisses critical reviews as indicative of the critics' own 'fascist politics' and 'emotional children' behavior, suggesting that their focus on trivial elements\u2014such as Melania removing her heels at 2 a.m. on Inauguration Day\u2014reveals their lack of professional integrity. The film premiered on January 29, 2026, at the Trump-Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and is produced by Amazon MGM Studios. Nolte also references the film's popularity among everyday audiences, noting it has garnered five-star reviews on platforms like Amazon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:07 AM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/31/nolte-rotten-tomatoes-audiences-rave-for-melania-with-98-rating-while-bitter-critics-try-to-destroy-it/)\n\n**Melania Trump doc savaged in brutal reviews with awful 11% Rotten Tomatoes score**\nMelania Trump's documentary, titled 'Melania: 20 Days to History,' was released on January 30, 2026, and chronicles her life during the 20 days preceding her husband Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration. The film aims to showcase her journey to becoming First Lady, featuring her reflections on maintaining 'mental strength' and her praise for Trump, including the statement: 'Nobody has endured what he has for the last few years. Here he is, I'm so very proud.' Despite her and Trump's public support, including attending the premiere together, the documentary received overwhelmingly negative reviews. As of February 1, 2026, it held a 11% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with numerous one-star reviews describing it as 'terrible,' 'orchestrated and airbrushed,' and 'lazy patchwork.' Critics, including one who compared director Brett Ratner to someone unable to find humanity in a funeral, questioned the film\u2019s depth and authenticity. A few positive reviews praised it as 'excellent' and 'classy,' but they were vastly outnumbered.

However, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, scoring just 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the lowest ratings in the site\u2019s history, even lower than 'Cats' (2019), which had a 9% approval rating. Critics widely labeled the film as propaganda, superficial, and lacking narrative depth. Owen Gleiberman of Variety called it 'so orchestrated, polished, and directed that it barely rises above a blatant infomercial.' Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter criticized its excessive adulation of Melania Trump, stating viewers 'feel almost unpatriotic for not starting to venerate her.' Xan Brooks of The Guardian described the experience as 'two hours with Melania [that] feel like an endless hell,' while Nick Hilton of The Independent called it 'a sullen void with nothing but propaganda,' portraying Melania as a 'vacuum of pure insignificance.' Despite this, audience reception was polarized: the public gave the film an A on CinemaScore and a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014among the highest for the top 10 films of the weekend\u2014creating one of the largest critical-audience divides on the platform. The film is projected to rank third at the box office, behind 'Socorro!' and 'Iron Lung,' and ahead of Jason Statham\u2019s 'Shelter.'

However, this assertion was quickly challenged by public and media scrutiny. The Guardian reported that the film screened in Times Square with only 12 attendees, and audience reactions were unimpressed. Critics and commentators responded with skepticism and mockery, including columnist Jackie Calmes calling it an 'alternate reality,' ex-GOP insider Jeff Timmer writing 'lol,' comedian Ryan Cullen noting Donald Trump likely wouldn't retweet it, and journalist Fredrik Gr\u00e6svik stating the First Lady is 'just as detached from reality as the president.'

Many reviews accused the film of being desperate propaganda and criticized its pacing and lack of payoff. Despite the overwhelmingly negative reception, The London Evening Standard gave it 3 out of 5 stars, praising Melania Trump\u2019s appearance as 'stunning' for her age.

President Trump praised the film, calling it 'really great' and highlighting its 'glamour' that he believes the country needs.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 9% critics' score, with no certified fresh rating, and an audience score not yet available due to insufficient reviews. The London Evening Standard offered a more favorable take, noting Melania's 'human warmth' and striking appearance at age 55. Some Rotten Tomatoes users praised the film's cinematography, heartfelt moments, and soundtrack, while others, including an unverified reviewer, criticized it as a 'high-gloss vanity mirror' lacking insight.

Despite President Trump's insistence that the film would be a 'clamorous success' and his aggressive promotion on Truth Social, ticket pre-sales remain low, with no tickets sold at the largest cinema in Boston. The film's premiere at the White House was attended by 70 prominent figures, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose presence drew backlash after a controversial incident involving the killing of a 37-year-old veteran in Minneapolis, which the Trump administration falsely labeled as terrorism. Critics, including conservative strategist Rick Wilson and Hollywood insider Veronica Villafane, argue the film is a sycophantic project by Amazon to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially given Jeff Bezos\u2019s simultaneous layoffs at The Washington Post. Analyst Harry Enten of CNN estimates a 63% chance the film will receive a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Experts believe the film's potential failure could amplify public frustration toward the Trump administration. Melania Trump is expected to earn 28 million dollars from licensing rights regardless of box office performance. The documentary will be followed by a three-part Amazon Prime series set for release by late 2026. Melania Trump and her husband attended the film's premiere at the Kennedy Center.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 12:13 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/internazionale/esteri/melania-trump-rischio-flop-per-il-doc-sulla-first-lady-casa-bianca-preoccupata_5bdj7I5kbB1mXvtPZSFGdi)\n\n**'Melania' Documentary Gets Brutally Review-Bombed**\nMelania Trump's documentary, produced by Amazon-MGM and directed by Brett Ratner, has faced a wave of negative backlash on Letterboxd, a social film platform with over 17 million users. As of January 28, 2026, the film had over 100 reviews and a 2.5-star rating out of 5, despite being unreleased to the public. Users have posted scathing, often politically charged reviews\u2014some stating they won\u2019t watch or pirate the film to ensure it becomes the lowest-rated movie of all time. The backlash stems from multiple factors: Ratner\u2019s 2017 sexual assault allegations (which he denies), his association with the Epstein files, Amazon\u2019s $40 million purchase and $35 million promotional spend, and the film\u2019s premiere occurring the same night federal agents shot 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. The reviews initially vanished from Letterboxd on January 27 due to a technical error involving an incorrect premiere date, but were restored by January 28. The film has already been added to over 330 user-created lists, including 'Tomorrow's Trash,' 'Trump Era Cinema,' and 'Movie blacklist.' CNN data expert Harry Enten predicts a 63% chance the film will score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary, which claims to offer 'unprecedented access' to Melania Trump during the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration, is set to premiere in 2,000 U.S. theaters and 3,000 worldwide, with 100 UK theaters reporting 'soft' ticket sales. President Trump promoted the film on Truth Social, claiming tickets are 'Selling out, FAST!' The film will stream on Amazon Prime after its theatrical release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 07:04 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/melania-documentary-gets-brutally-review-bombed/)\n\n**CNN Stars Dump On Melania Movie's Chances: 'Even Trump' Couldn't Buy Enough Tickets To Make It a Hit**\nCNN anchors Erin Burnett and data reporter Harry Enten expressed skepticism about the commercial success of the Amazon MGM Studios documentary 'Melania,' directed by Brett Ratner, stating that even President Donald Trump could not guarantee a box office hit despite a $75 million total investment\u2014$40 million for production and $35 million for promotion. On CNN's OutFront, Enten cited low projected opening weekend earnings of $1 million to $5 million, far below the $41 million debut of 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time adjusted for inflation. He also highlighted a strong prediction that the film would score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a majority chance of such a low rating. Burnett added that public scrutiny might expose any artificial ticket-purchasing efforts, and both emphasized that the film's financial prospects are dim compared to its massive budget. The documentary premiered at the White House, attended by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook, though the event did not signal strong audience interest.

Despite President Donald Trump's claim that tickets are 'selling out, FAST' and Amazon's $75 million investment in production and marketing, ticket sales in major U.S. and U.K. cities show near-empty theaters, with social media users sharing screenshots of zero or minimal seat sales at AMC theaters in Boston, Jacksonville, and Times Square. The film, directed by Brett Ratner\u2014a figure accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 but never charged\u2014has drawn controversy, particularly due to a high-profile black-tie White House premiere attended by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, and Mike Tyson, which occurred hours after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Enten questioned the alignment between Amazon\u2019s financial gains\u2014Jeff Bezos\u2019s wealth grew by $35 billion since early November 2024\u2014and the film\u2019s weak market reception, suggesting a possible correlation. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump over 20 days before her husband\u2019s inauguration, was marketed as an 'inside look' at the First Lady, but public interest appears low, with Vue CEO Tim Richards reporting 'soft' sales in the U.K., including just one ticket sold for a 3:10 p.m. screening in London\u2019s Islington branch.

CNN data guru floored by soaring odds 'Melania' doc flops**\nThe Amazon-sponsored documentary 'Melania' is projected to underperform at the box office, according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten, who cited early data from Kalshi, a prediction market partner of CNN. Enten stated that the film's opening weekend is forecasted to earn only $1\u20135 million, significantly below the $41 million earned by 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time in its opening weekend. He also highlighted that the probability of 'Melania' receiving a Rotten Tomatoes score below 20% stands at a majority, based on prediction market odds, signaling strong skepticism about its critical reception. Despite President Trump's claim that tickets are selling fast, Enten expressed doubt, stating, 'I don't think the president is going to be right.' Reports also indicate that theaters are facing large numbers of unsold seats, and even some crew members hope the film fails.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Critical Reception\nCritics have universally panned the documentary, describing it as:\n- \"An orchestrated, airbrushed shameless infomercial\" with no substantive insights [1][4][9][10]\n- \"Dull,\" \"terrible,\" and \"pure, endless hell\" that ranks among the worst-reviewed films in history [3]\n- \"Exhaustingly boring and chillingly vain\" with \"no emotional heft\" [3][7]\n- \"Fascist propaganda\" and compared to Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi-era work [2][11]\n- An \"expensive vanity project\" lacking journalistic distance, with Melania reportedly retaining full editorial control [9][15]\n\nProminent critics were particularly brutal:\n- Variety's Owen Gleiberman called it \"a brutal disconnect\" that fails as cinema [4][7][10]\n- The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck noted it \"fawns so lavishly over its subject it feels unpatriotic not to be impressed\" [10]\n- BuzzFeed's Stephanie McNeal declared it \"the worst film I've ever seen\" [7]\n- Irish Times' Donald Clarke labeled it \"The Triumph of Boredom\" [5][6]\n\n### Rotten Tomatoes Score\nAs of late January/early February 2026:\n- **Critics Score:** Ranges between 6-11% (\"Rotten\") based on 15-17 reviews [1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9]:\n  - Most reports show 7-11% initially [1][3][7]\n  - Later settled at 6-8% as more reviews came in [4][5]\n- **Audience Score:** Shows a shocking 99% approval based on 100+ verified ratings [2][3][7]\n\nThis creates one of Rotten Tomatoes' largest-ever gaps (92 points) between critics and audiences [7]. The film shares its dismal critics score with infamous flops like \"Catwoman\" (8%) and \"Becks vs. Sever\" (0%) [5][6].\n\n### Key Context\n1. **Political Polarization:** The radical score split reflects America's political divide, with critics lambasting it as propaganda while supporters praise its \"patriotism\" and \"class\" [2][4][7]\n2. **Ratner Controversy:** The director's history of sexual misconduct allegations significantly impacted reception, with critics attacking Amazon for enabling his \"comeback\" [11][13][17]\n3. **Box Office Failure:** Despite Trump's \"MUST WATCH\" endorsements, it earned just $1-8 million opening weekend against $75M+ costs [5][7][14][17]\n4. **Historical Context:** Historians rank Melania last among First Ladies, which colored critical expectations [14]\n\n### Limitations\nThe polarized responses and Ratner's controversial reputation make objective assessment difficult. Critics largely dismissed it as political theater rather than cinema [10][15], while audience scores may reflect culture-war positioning rather than cinematic merit [2][4].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
