summarize critical consensus trends since Jan 29 premiere\nBased on every date-stamped article in the current results set, the latest public, source-verifiable Rotten Tomatoes numbers for Brett Ratner\u2019s 2026 documentary \u201cMelania\u201d are:\n\n\u2022 Tomatometer score: 10 %\u201311 %, status \u201cRotten\u201d.  \n  \u2013 ComicBook.com reports 10 % as of 1 Feb 2026, explicitly adding \u201cwith 20 critic reviews\u201d (ComicBook.com, 1 Feb 2026).  \n  \u2013 Fox News, USA Today and The Daily Beast all say 11 % on the same calendar date, but none of them specify how many reviews that figure is based on (Fox News, 1 Feb 2026; USA Today, 1 Feb 2026; Daily Beast, 1 Feb 2026).\n\n\u2022 Verified critic-review count: 20 reviews is the most recent hard number available, supplied by ComicBook.com on 1 Feb 2026. No later article or the truncated Rotten Tomatoes page snippet in the search results discloses a newer tally.\n\nBecause Rotten Tomatoes updates continuously and its landing page in the search results withholds the scoreboard, these 1 Feb figures are the latest that can be cited with documentation from the material provided.\n\nTrajectory of the Tomatometer since the 29 Jan premiere\n\n1. 29 Jan 2026 \u2013 Invite-only Kennedy Center premiere; mainstream critics were barred. Variety\u2019s recap (quoted by ScreenRant) indicates Rotten Tomatoes still read \u201cNo score yet\u201d at the end of the night (ScreenRant, 31 Jan 2026).\n\n2. Opening day, 30 Jan \u2013 The first wave of reviews pushed the score into single digits: USA Today logged an early 8 % (USA Today, 30 Jan coverage cited in ScreenRant), while Us Weekly captured 9 % later that morning (ScreenRant, 31 Jan). Rough math suggests roughly a dozen notices, with only one counted as \u201cFresh\u201d.\n\n3. 31 Jan \u2013 As more national outlets filed, the Tomatometer bottomed out. HuffPost, The Hollywood Reporter and Economic Times snapshots all record 6 % (HuffPost, 31 Jan 2026; Hollywood Reporter, 31 Jan 2026; Economic Times, undated but summarising 31 Jan stats). ScreenRant pegs exactly \u201c16 critic reviews\u201d at 6 % (ScreenRant, 31 Jan 2026). A Fiction Horizon/IMDb news item appearing the same day lists 7 % with 15 reviews\u2014an earlier capture during the slide (IMDb news, 31 Jan 2026).\n\n4. 1 Feb \u2013 A handful of additional, slightly less negative reviews nudged the percentage upward.  \n   \u2022 Daily Beast and Fox News cite 11 %.  \n   \u2022 USA Today\u2019s weekend box-office piece repeats 11 %.  \n   \u2022 ComicBook.com, time-stamped the same day, shows 10 % and for the first time reveals a larger pool: 20 critic reviews.  \n   Taken together, these stories confirm at least four new reviews were logged between the 31 Jan (16 reviews) and 1 Feb (20 reviews) snapshots, and that two of those four were \u201cFresh,\u201d raising the approval rate but leaving the film deeply in \u201cRotten\u201d territory.\n\n5. 2 Feb and beyond \u2013 No article in the supplied corpus provides fresher numbers. Consequently, 10 %\u201311 % on a base of 20 published reviews remains the latest verifiable reading.\n\nPatterns in the written criticism\n\n\u2022 \u201cGlorified infomercial\u201d & \u201cexpensive propaganda\u201d: Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and The Daily Beast all use language to this effect, faulting the film for total message control by its subject (Fox News, Daily Beast).\n\n\u2022 Craft complaints: reviewers label the documentary \u201cinsipid,\u201d \u201cbreathtakingly inert,\u201d or \u201cpure, endless hell\u201d (HuffPost, ScreenRant roundup, Guardian quotes within HuffPost).\n\n\u2022 Ethical alarm bells: several outlets, notably The Guardian and Variety, argue that Amazon\u2019s $40 million licensing deal reads as political payoff (HuffPost, Economic Times).\n\n\u2022 Outlier praise: the London Evening Standard\u2019s 3-star write-up remains the only consistently cited \u201cFresh\u201d review; ComicBook.com and Daily Beast each mention one additional positive regional notice.\n\n\u2022 Critics-versus-audience gulf: every 30 Jan-1 Feb article notes a 98\u201399 % verified-audience score and an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore, creating the largest critic/audience split ever recorded on Rotten Tomatoes according to ComicBook.com (ComicBook.com, 1 Feb 2026).\n\nHow the consensus evolved\n\nDay-by-day, the critical narrative hardened rapidly:\n\n\u2022 29 Jan \u2013 no access, but concern about censorship.  \n\u2022 30 Jan \u2013 early reviews already frame the film as hagiography.  \n\u2022 31 Jan \u2013 unanimity in negative tone; multiple pieces draw direct analogies to propaganda, foot-fetish shots, and \u201ccamp classic\u201d potential. The score sinks to its nadir (6 %).  \n\u2022 1 Feb \u2013 second-day takes continue the panning but a few moderate voices (Standard, Newsmax) appear, reflected in the slight score rebound to ~10 %. Commentators pivot to the story behind the numbers\u2014the unprecedented audience/critic gap and the documentary\u2019s surprisingly strong $7\u20138 million opening weekend (USA Today, Fox News, Hollywood Reporter).\n\nFinancial context\n\nThe box-office surprise (estimated $7 million opening; USA Today, 1 Feb 2026) amplified coverage and likely ensured further reviews will post in the coming week. Industry reporters expect the Tomatometer to keep fluctuating as metropolitan critics (Los Angeles Times, Washington Post) and international outlets file.\n\nWhat is firmly established\n\n\u2022 Earliest recorded score: 8\u20139 % on 30 Jan.  \n\u2022 Lowest recorded score: 6 % (16 reviews) on 31 Jan.  \n\u2022 Latest documented score: 10 %\u201311 % (20 reviews) on 1 Feb.  \n\u2022 Critical trajectory: sharp fall on day 2, modest recovery on day 3; overall consensus remains overwhelmingly negative.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\n1. Live Rotten Tomatoes scoreboard after 1 Feb 2026: the exact, up-to-the-minute Tomatometer percentage, critic count and fresh/rotten split can only be confirmed by visiting the page or querying Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 API.  \n2. Identification of which additional reviews turned the dial from 6 % to 10\u201311 %.  \n3. Forthcoming reviews from large U.S. dailies and overseas publications that could move the needle again.  \n4. Whether Rotten Tomatoes will ultimately post an official Critics\u2019 Consensus blurb (none is quoted yet).\n\nTo close those gaps, a direct check of the Rotten Tomatoes page or screenshots archived after 1 Feb would be required; no article in the present search results provides newer, citable data.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs of the most recent verifiable reporting (1 Feb 2026), \u201cMelania\u201d holds a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer of approximately 10 %\u201311 %, derived from 20 published critic reviews, cementing it as one of the worst-reviewed wide-release documentaries in recent memory. The score\u2019s day-by-day history shows an initial single-digit debut, a plunge to 6 %, and a slight rebound once a handful of milder notices appeared. The overwhelming through-line of the commentary is that the film functions as lavish propaganda, marred further by inert filmmaking; only a couple of outlets find limited merit as a curated self-portrait. Meanwhile, the audience score remains an off-the-charts 98\u201399 %, creating a record-setting critic-versus-viewer divide and fuelling the secondary media narrative around the documentary. Unless and until additional, independently sourced data emerge, these 1 Feb figures stand as the current consensus snapshot.</Agent_report>\n"
