Analysis:
This is a fascinating forecasting question about the Rotten Tomatoes rating for a documentary about Melania Trump, directed by Brett Ratner and released in early 2026. To generate an accurate forecast, I'll need to research several key factors:

1. Critical reception of previous Trump-related documentaries
2. Brett Ratner's reputation and past documentary work
3. Early critical buzz or preview reviews of the "Melania" documentary
4. Potential political bias or polarization that might influence critical reception

The key challenge will be understanding how critics might approach a documentary about Melania Trump, given the potentially polarizing nature of the subject and the Trump family's political history. The involvement of Brett Ratner and the high-profile Amazon acquisition suggest this isn't a typical documentary, which could influence critical response.
