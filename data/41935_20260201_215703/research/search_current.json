The nearly two-hour film, directed by Brett Ratner, chronicles the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration from the perspective of First Lady Melania Trump, portraying her orchestration of inauguration plans, transition to the White House, and family relocation. It premiered in 1,778 theaters, with 53% of ticket sales coming from Republican counties and top-selling states predicted to be Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Research firm EntTelligence estimated 46% of sales came from rural areas, and 72% of the audience was female and over age 55. Despite strong commercial performance, critical reception was overwhelmingly negative: the film holds a 10% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, with reviews calling it a 'cheese ball informercial of staggering inertia' (Owen Gleiberman, Variety), a 'medieval tribute to placate the greedy king on his throne' (Xan Brooks, The Guardian), and a 'hagiography' that insults the genre (Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter). In contrast, verified user reviews gave it a 99% score, earning a 'Hot' Popcornmeter ranking. The film did not screen for critics in advance. International ticket sales were expected to be minimal. The documentary's release follows Ratner\u2019s return to filmmaking after being exiled from Hollywood since 2017 due to sexual misconduct allegations, which he denies. His prior involvement with 'Rush Hour 4' was revived after a reported intervention by Donald Trump. Amazon has not yet announced a streaming release date. David A. Gross of FranchiseRe described the film as a 'political investment' rather than a profit-driven venture, noting that $75 million is insignificant to Amazon if it serves regulatory or governmental interests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:38 PM\nSource:[KRQE 13](https://www.krqe.com/news/national/melania-documentary-debuts-with-strong-ticket-sales-low-ratings-from-critics/)\n\n**'Melania' buried with low critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, scores 99% with verified audience**\nMelania Trump's documentary 'Melania' received a 11% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes as of February 1, 2026, despite scoring 99% with verified audience reviews. The film, which premiered on Thursday, offers a behind-the-scenes look at Melania Trump\u2019s life over 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration, capturing moments with President Donald Trump and their son Barron. Critics were highly critical, with Screen-Space\u2019s Simon Foster calling it 'propaganda that serves the formation of a future non-democracy,' and Adam Olinger of 'Adam Does Movies' stating he'd 'rather rewatch January 6th.' In contrast, verified audience reviewers praised the film for its intimate portrayal of the first lady, with one calling it 'absolutely fascinating' and another highlighting 'delightful' scenes with Barron Trump. The documentary is projected to open to over $8 million at the North American box office, according to The Hollywood Reporter. VIPs at the premiere, including U.S. Attorney Alina Habba and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, praised Melania\u2019s grace and authenticity, with Habba stating she hopes the public sees 'what I see.' Social media users, including Leigh Wolf of the 'Ruthless Podcast,' dismissed critics as 'salty libs' seeking to undermine the film.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-buried-low-critic-score-rotten-tomatoes-scores-99-verified-audience)\n\n**Nolte: Rotten Tomatoes -- Audiences Rave for 'Melania' with 98% Rating While Bitter Critics Try to Destroy It**\nAccording to John Nolte writing for Breitbart.com, the film 'Melania' received a 98% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, marking a 92 percentage point gap from critics' scores, which Nolte claims reflects a broader trend of elitist, leftist bias in film criticism. He argues that critics, driven by political ideology, are unable to objectively evaluate the film due to their emotional resistance to its narrative\u2014a story of an immigrant woman rising from a working-class Communist background to become First Lady of the United States. Nolte portrays the film as a biographical triumph, praising Melania Trump's character as 'pure class' and 'the stuff of legend,' while accusing critics of reacting with 'tantrums' and 'hate' rather than thoughtful analysis. He dismisses critical reviews as indicative of the critics' own 'fascist politics' and 'emotional children' behavior, suggesting that their focus on trivial elements\u2014such as Melania removing her heels at 2 a.m. on Inauguration Day\u2014reveals their lack of professional integrity. The film premiered on January 29, 2026, at the Trump-Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and is produced by Amazon MGM Studios. Nolte also references the film's popularity among everyday audiences, noting it has garnered five-star reviews on platforms like Amazon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:07 AM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/31/nolte-rotten-tomatoes-audiences-rave-for-melania-with-98-rating-while-bitter-critics-try-to-destroy-it/)\n\n**Melania Trump doc savaged in brutal reviews with awful 11% Rotten Tomatoes score**\nMelania Trump's documentary, titled 'Melania: 20 Days to History,' was released on January 30, 2026, and chronicles her life during the 20 days preceding her husband Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration. The film aims to showcase her journey to becoming First Lady, featuring her reflections on maintaining 'mental strength' and her praise for Trump, including the statement: 'Nobody has endured what he has for the last few years. Here he is, I'm so very proud.' Despite her and Trump's public support, including attending the premiere together, the documentary received overwhelmingly negative reviews. As of February 1, 2026, it held a 11% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with numerous one-star reviews describing it as 'terrible,' 'orchestrated and airbrushed,' and 'lazy patchwork.' Critics, including one who compared director Brett Ratner to someone unable to find humanity in a funeral, questioned the film\u2019s depth and authenticity. A few positive reviews praised it as 'excellent' and 'classy,' but they were vastly outnumbered. The film is currently only available in theaters and is expected to be released on Prime Video in 2026, though no official date has been confirmed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:04 AM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/2165226/melania-trump-doc-savaged-brutal-rotten-tomatoes)\n\n**Melania Documentary's Box Office Success Contrasts with Harsh Critical Reception**\nThe documentary 'Melania,' directed by Brett Ratner and produced by Amazon MGM Studios, premiered in U.S. theaters on Friday, February 28, 2026, and achieved strong box office performance with estimated opening weekend earnings of up to $8 million\u2014among the best documentary debuts in a decade. However, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, scoring just 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the lowest ratings in the site\u2019s history, even lower than 'Cats' (2019), which had a 9% approval rating. Critics widely labeled the film as propaganda, superficial, and lacking narrative depth. Owen Gleiberman of Variety called it 'so orchestrated, polished, and directed that it barely rises above a blatant infomercial.' Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter criticized its excessive adulation of Melania Trump, stating viewers 'feel almost unpatriotic for not starting to venerate her.' Xan Brooks of The Guardian described the experience as 'two hours with Melania [that] feel like an endless hell,' while Nick Hilton of The Independent called it 'a sullen void with nothing but propaganda,' portraying Melania as a 'vacuum of pure insignificance.' Despite this, audience reception was polarized: the public gave the film an A on CinemaScore and a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014among the highest for the top 10 films of the weekend\u2014creating one of the largest critical-audience divides on the platform. The film is projected to rank third at the box office, behind 'Socorro!' and 'Iron Lung,' and ahead of Jason Statham\u2019s 'Shelter.' According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film has resonated particularly with conservative audiences in the Southern and Central U.S., especially women over 55, who made up 72% of the opening-day audience.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:01 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2026/02/01/sucesso-de-publico-nos-eua-doc-melania-e-massacrado-pela-critica-um-inferno-sem-fim.ghtml)\n\n**Melania Trump ridiculed for saying her 'loved by all' movie is '#1': 'Alternate reality'**\nMelania Trump claimed her documentary, 'Melania,' was '#1 Highest Opening In 10 Yrs (Doc)' and 'loved by all' with an 'A' CinemaScore, according to a social media post on February 1, 2026. However, this assertion was quickly challenged by public and media scrutiny. The Guardian reported that the film screened in Times Square with only 12 attendees, and audience reactions were unimpressed. Critics and commentators responded with skepticism and mockery, including columnist Jackie Calmes calling it an 'alternate reality,' ex-GOP insider Jeff Timmer writing 'lol,' comedian Ryan Cullen noting Donald Trump likely wouldn't retweet it, and journalist Fredrik Gr\u00e6svik stating the First Lady is 'just as detached from reality as the president.' The film's 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes was widely shared by users as evidence of its poor reception.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:15 AM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/melania-movie-2675065839/)\n\n**'Melania' Receives 'Rotten' 6% Rating on Rotten Tomatoes Amid Criticism and Low Box Office Projections**\nThe Amazon-produced documentary 'Melania,' focusing on the First Lady during the 20 days before Donald Trump's inauguration, received a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, classifying it as 'rotten' according to the site's scoring system. This is the lowest score among new films in theaters, significantly lower than 'Get Help' (94%) and 'Shelter' (64%). The film, financed by Amazon with a total budget of $40 million, has drawn harsh criticism from reviewers. Donald Clarke of the Irish Times described it as 'an overt propaganda' that induces 'narcolepsy' rather than inspiring mass rallies, calling it 'The Triumph of Boredom.' William Bibbiani of The Wrap criticized it for lacking humanity, stating Brett Ratner could not find any in a funeral. Despite its poor reception, it is not the worst-rated film on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014several films, including the 2002 action movie 'Becks vs. Sever: Deadly Showdown,' have received 0% scores.

The film, produced by Amazon and financed with a total budget of $40 million\u2014partially funded by Jeff Bezos's company\u2014chronicles the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. Despite its high production cost, the film has drawn harsh criticism from reviewers. Donald Clarke of the Irish Times described it as 'an unashamed propaganda... aiming more to induce narcolepsy than galvanize mass rallies,' while William Bibbiani of The Wrap wrote, 'I have no idea why she agreed to this film, as Brett Ratner couldn't find humanity in a funeral.' CNN data chief Harry Enten predicted modest box office earnings of between $1 and $5 million.

The film, which was promoted as a behind-the-scenes look at Melania Trump preparing to return to the White House ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration, faced immediate controversy, including Amazon banning press access during its Kennedy Center screening. Critics widely condemned the documentary, with The Guardian calling it 'trash' and 'endless hell,' and The Atlantic labeling it a 'disgrace.' Many reviews accused the film of being desperate propaganda and criticized its pacing and lack of payoff. Despite the overwhelmingly negative reception, The London Evening Standard gave it 3 out of 5 stars, praising Melania Trump\u2019s appearance as 'stunning' for her age. The documentary is currently playing in select theaters, and its release has sparked significant debate over political media and documentary ethics.

Acquired by Amazon MGM Studios in a $40 million deal, the film chronicles the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's 2025 presidential inauguration, portraying Melania's journey into becoming First Lady. President Trump praised the film, calling it 'really great' and highlighting its 'glamour' that he believes the country needs. However, critics have largely panned the documentary: Variety called it a 'shameless infomercial' with no drama, while The Hollywood Reporter labeled it an 'expensive propaganda doc.' On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 9% critics' score, with no certified fresh rating, and an audience score not yet available due to insufficient reviews. The London Evening Standard offered a more favorable take, noting Melania's 'human warmth' and striking appearance at age 55. Some Rotten Tomatoes users praised the film's cinematography, heartfelt moments, and soundtrack, while others, including an unverified reviewer, criticized it as a 'high-gloss vanity mirror' lacking insight. Melania stated she wanted to showcase the extensive planning behind transitioning from private citizen to First Lady, emphasizing pride in every detail. Director Brett Ratner confirmed Melania had a 'theatrical, big-screen vision' and urged him not to hold back during production.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:07 AM\nSource:[Us Weekly](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/melania-trumps-controversial-documentary-slammed-by-critic-reviews/)\n\n**Data analyst predicts brutal reception for Melania Trump's movie: 'Dead last!'**\nCNN's chief data analyst, Harry Enten, predicted a poor critical and commercial reception for Melania Trump's documentary 'Melania,' which premiered on Friday, January 30, 2026. Despite Amazon MGM Studios spending $75 million on the film\u2014$40 million for production and $35 million on marketing\u2014the film is forecasted to earn between $1 million and $5 million in its opening weekend, far below the $41 million adjusted for inflation earned by the highest-grossing documentary, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' Enten cited weak advance ticket sales, with single-digit figures in many theaters, and unfavorable pre-release critical reviews. He stated there is a 73% chance the film will score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating strong negative critical reception, and a low probability of achieving a 'fresh' score (above 60%). Enten attributed the expected failure to widespread belief that the film is of low quality. He also noted that Melania Trump ranks dead last among U.S. first ladies in historical rankings, alongside Jane Pierce and Margaret Taylor, reinforcing the perception of her low historical esteem.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 09:30 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/melania-trump-movie-critics/)\n\n**Melania Trump's Documentary Faces Box Office Flop Amid Political Backlash and Low Pre-Sales**\nThe documentary 'Melania,' produced by Amazon MGM Studios and centered on First Lady Melania Trump, is projected to underperform at the box office, with estimates ranging from 1 million to 5 million dollars in its opening weekend\u2014far below the 75 million dollars invested in production and marketing. Despite President Trump's insistence that the film would be a 'clamorous success' and his aggressive promotion on Truth Social, ticket pre-sales remain low, with no tickets sold at the largest cinema in Boston. The film's premiere at the White House was attended by 70 prominent figures, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose presence drew backlash after a controversial incident involving the killing of a 37-year-old veteran in Minneapolis, which the Trump administration falsely labeled as terrorism. Critics, including conservative strategist Rick Wilson and Hollywood insider Veronica Villafane, argue the film is a sycophantic project by Amazon to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially given Jeff Bezos\u2019s simultaneous layoffs at The Washington Post. Analyst Harry Enten of CNN estimates a 63% chance the film will receive a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Experts believe the film's potential failure could amplify public frustration toward the Trump administration. Melania Trump is expected to earn 28 million dollars from licensing rights regardless of box office performance. The documentary will be followed by a three-part Amazon Prime series set for release by late 2026.

As of January 28, 2026, the film had over 100 reviews and a 2.5-star rating out of 5, despite being unreleased to the public. Users have posted scathing, often politically charged reviews\u2014some stating they won\u2019t watch or pirate the film to ensure it becomes the lowest-rated movie of all time. The backlash stems from multiple factors: Ratner\u2019s 2017 sexual assault allegations (which he denies), his association with the Epstein files, Amazon\u2019s $40 million purchase and $35 million promotional spend, and the film\u2019s premiere occurring the same night federal agents shot 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. The reviews initially vanished from Letterboxd on January 27 due to a technical error involving an incorrect premiere date, but were restored by January 28. The film has already been added to over 330 user-created lists, including 'Tomorrow's Trash,' 'Trump Era Cinema,' and 'Movie blacklist.' CNN data expert Harry Enten predicts a 63% chance the film will score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary, which claims to offer 'unprecedented access' to Melania Trump during the 20 days before the 2025 presidential inauguration, is set to premiere in 2,000 U.S. theaters and 3,000 worldwide, with 100 UK theaters reporting 'soft' ticket sales.

On CNN's OutFront, Enten cited low projected opening weekend earnings of $1 million to $5 million, far below the $41 million debut of 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time adjusted for inflation. He also highlighted a strong prediction that the film would score below 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a majority chance of such a low rating. Burnett added that public scrutiny might expose any artificial ticket-purchasing efforts, and both emphasized that the film's financial prospects are dim compared to its massive budget. The documentary premiered at the White House, attended by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook, though the event did not signal strong audience interest.

Despite President Donald Trump's claim that tickets are 'selling out, FAST' and Amazon's $75 million investment in production and marketing, ticket sales in major U.S. and U.K. cities show near-empty theaters, with social media users sharing screenshots of zero or minimal seat sales at AMC theaters in Boston, Jacksonville, and Times Square. The film, directed by Brett Ratner\u2014a figure accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 but never charged\u2014has drawn controversy, particularly due to a high-profile black-tie White House premiere attended by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, and Mike Tyson, which occurred hours after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Enten questioned the alignment between Amazon\u2019s financial gains\u2014Jeff Bezos\u2019s wealth grew by $35 billion since early November 2024\u2014and the film\u2019s weak market reception, suggesting a possible correlation. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump over 20 days before her husband\u2019s inauguration, was marketed as an 'inside look' at the First Lady, but public interest appears low, with Vue CEO Tim Richards reporting 'soft' sales in the U.K., including just one ticket sold for a 3:10 p.m. screening in London\u2019s Islington branch. The film was set to premiere globally on Friday, January 30, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 02:44 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/melania-opening-box-office-prediction-b2909414.html)\n\n**'Not so great!' CNN data guru floored by soaring odds 'Melania' doc flops**\nThe Amazon-sponsored documentary 'Melania' is projected to underperform at the box office, according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten, who cited early data from Kalshi, a prediction market partner of CNN. Enten stated that the film's opening weekend is forecasted to earn only $1\u20135 million, significantly below the $41 million earned by 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the top-grossing documentary of all time in its opening weekend. He also highlighted that the probability of 'Melania' receiving a Rotten Tomatoes score below 20% stands at a majority, based on prediction market odds, signaling strong skepticism about its critical reception. Despite President Trump's claim that tickets are selling fast, Enten expressed doubt, stating, 'I don't think the president is going to be right.' Reports also indicate that theaters are facing large numbers of unsold seats, and even some crew members hope the film fails.

A worthwhile documentary would require probing her immigrant journey, FLOTUS paradoxes, and post-White House influence, which this avoids entirely [1][4][5][8].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
