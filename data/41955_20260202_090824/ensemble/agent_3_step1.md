Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **EFF (Apr 29, 2025) — “Age verification… mini-ID wallet”**  
- **What it says (facts):** The Commission commissioned a “mini-wallet” age verification app aligned with the upcoming EU Digital Identity Wallet; describes possible issuance methods (national eID, physical ID, banking apps, third parties) and notes design elements in the spec (hashes/ZKPs mentioned, verifier registration not required initially).  
- **What it says (opinions/advocacy):** Strong privacy-risk framing: protections “optional,” system “rushed,” verifier accountability weak.  
- **Quality:** High credibility on civil-liberties tech-policy; however, it is **advocacy-oriented** and emphasizes risks. Useful for *direction of travel* (EU tooling/pilots) but not a direct indicator of imminent *mandatory* EU-wide requirements.

2) **Ailance / 2b-advice (Aug 13, 2025) — “Age verification under the DSA”**  
- **Facts:** Commission published a white-label age verification “blueprint” and launched an EU-wide pilot (Jul 14, 2025); explicitly notes guidelines are **not legally binding**; provides an implementation timeline through 2026 (pilots, expansion, optional EUDI wallet integration).  
- **Opinions:** Presents approach as innovative/privacy-by-design; implies enforcement leverage via DSA fines.  
- **Quality:** Decent secondary explainer with practical detail; likely accurate on timelines; not authoritative on future legislation, but important for baseline: **EU is building infrastructure without yet mandating it.**

3) **Interface-EU (Oct 13, 2025) — “Mind the Gap” policy brief**  
- **Facts:** Reports political signals (Macron statements; multi-minister op-ed; multiple member states supporting EU-wide checks) and original testing: major platforms largely rely on self-declaration; robust age assurance absent.  
- **Opinions:** Central thesis: “more legislation is not the solution” short-run; problem is enforcement and implementation.  
- **Quality:** Strong on empirical testing and policy synthesis; still a policy-advocacy product (with a clear argument). It’s useful because it suggests the EU could push **enforcement/tools** rather than **new mandatory EU-wide law**.

4) **Mayer Brown (Jan 2026) — Global privacy watchlist**  
- **Facts:** AI Act timing milestones (key phases into Aug 2026+), plus broader note that regulators are focusing on child protection online.  
- **Opinions:** Framing about acceleration and “binding requirements” trend.  
- **Quality:** High for legal timelines; less directly informative about *mandatory age verification on social media/AI* before 2027.

5) **The Verge (Jan 1, 2026) — US tech laws overview**  
- **Facts:** US state-level age verification/child-safety rules and ongoing litigation (e.g., injunctions).  
- **Relevance:** Mostly indirect; useful as a reminder that **mandatory age verification often triggers legal/political friction**, slowing adoption.  
- **Quality:** Good mainstream journalism; not EU-specific.

6) **ICLG 2025–2026 consumer protection / GDPR overview**  
- **Facts:** GDPR consent age baseline; general compliance guidance.  
- **Relevance:** Low to the target (mandatory AV).  
- **Quality:** Generally reliable legal summary, but generic.

7) **Agent report (Metaculus history inaccessible without auth/API)**  
- **Facts:** We cannot observe the *actual community prediction level* or its time series without authenticated API access.  
- **Implication:** Any short-horizon forecast about “community prediction > 26% by Feb 15” must rely on base rates and typical stability rather than observed current price.  
- **Quality:** Credible methodological limitation statement.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Because we can’t see the current Metaculus community probability, the best outside-view reference classes are:

1) **Metaculus short-horizon “community prediction threshold” questions** (meta-questions about the forecast itself over ~2 weeks).  
- Typical pattern: community probabilities on established questions are **sticky** over 1–2 weeks unless there is major news. So the event “>26% at a specific timestamp” is mostly “where is it already, plus small drift.”

2) **EU policy trajectory on child online safety / age assurance 2024–2026**  
- Evidence shows movement toward **tooling, pilots, and guidance** (blueprints under DSA) and political pressure from member states, but **binding EU-wide “mandatory age verification”** is a higher bar and may require either a new legislative act or a strong interpretation/enforcement mechanism that effectively compels it.

**Most suitable reference class for this meta-question:** (1) Metaculus short-horizon stickiness, *anchored* by (2) to guess where the underlying target probability plausibly sits (low-to-mid).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-02  
- **Target timestamp:** 2026-02-15  
- **Time left:** ~13 days

In ~13 days, absent a large EU announcement (e.g., Commission proposing/announcing a binding instrument clearly requiring age verification across major platforms), I’d expect only **small community movements**. Therefore, the probability that the community prediction is above 26% on Feb 15 is close to the probability that the community prediction is **already near or above that level** today.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

- The EU is visibly investing in **age verification infrastructure** (mini-wallet/blueprint/pilots) and linking it to the DSA “minors protection” agenda. That tends to keep the underlying “EU mandates AV before 2027” probability from being extremely low (not, say, 5–10%).  
- But multiple sources emphasize **non-binding guidance** and an **implementation/enforcement gap** rather than imminent new EU-wide mandates. That points to a **modest** underlying probability rather than a high one (not 60–70%).  
- Given that the threshold is **26%**—a relatively low/moderate level—the question becomes finely balanced: many reasonable outside-view estimates of the underlying mandate probability would cluster around ~20–35%.  
- Over a 13-day horizon, with no specific “scheduled catalyst” in the provided context, the best outside view is that the community prediction will be **near** that mid-20s to low-30s region, making “>26%” close to a coin flip.

So: outside view = roughly even odds, slightly leaning “Yes” only insofar as EU momentum on age assurance could keep community sentiment just above the mid-20s, but not by much.

Outside view calibration:

- This is a **meta-forecast** about a community probability at a near-term timestamp, but we lack the crucial observable (current community %). That forces an outside-view approach with **extra uncertainty**.  
- Given the heavy “stickiness” over two weeks, the dominant uncertainty is the *current level*; with no access, I center around the threshold and avoid extreme confidence.  
- I therefore calibrate near 50%, with only a small tilt.

Outside View Prediction:
**49%**
