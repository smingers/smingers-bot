Analysis:
### 1) What this question is really asking (resolution mechanics)
We resolve **Yes** iff the **Metaculus community prediction** on **2026-02-15 08:46:18** for target question #41173 (“Will the EU require mandatory age verification on social media or AI before 2027?”) is **strictly > 26.00%**. Otherwise **No**.  
So we’re forecasting the *community’s probability level* (a meta-forecast), not directly the policy outcome.

## (a) Source analysis (quality, dates, facts vs opinions)

### High-quality / primary / official
1) **European Commission – “EU approach to age verification” (EU digital policy site)**  
- **Date:** Ongoing page; key milestone **July 14, 2025 blueprint**.  
- **What’s factual:** Commission is developing a harmonized approach; blueprint exists; pilots; interoperability with EU Digital Identity Wallet by end-2026.  
- **What’s opinion/ framing:** “Key step supporting DSA implementation” is partially framing, but the existence of the program is strong fact.

2) **European Parliament press release (Nov 26, 2025) + DW coverage**  
- **Date:** Nov 2025.  
- **Facts:** Parliament passed a **non-binding** resolution advocating age rules (16 default, 13 floor, parental consent).  
- **Opinion:** Parliament’s political stance and quotes (e.g., “experiment ends here”) are political advocacy; not direct evidence of imminent binding EU-wide mandate.

### Medium-quality / professional analysis
3) **Taylor Wessing (Dec 2, 2025)**  
- **Facts:** Describes enforcement actions and pilots; identifies trend of stricter compliance.  
- **Opinion:** “Public opinion trends to more regulation” is plausible but still commentary.

### Reputable news
4) **Le Monde/AFP (Jan 27, 2026) re: France under-15 plan, Commission stance**  
- **Facts:** Commission confirmed France can set a digital age; enforcement via DSA for VLOPs; age-verification tool testing; “by end of 2025” availability claim.  
- **Caution:** Some timeline language may be simplified; still strong indication Commission is willing to enforce *national* age rules under DSA.

5) **AskNews items (Feb 1–2, 2026; Jan 30–31, 2026)** including:
- **Poland proposal (forsal.pl, Feb 2, 2026)** and **Germany/Hessen minister comments (n-tv, Feb 2, 2026)**: credible signals of national political momentum, but not EU-level legislation.  
- **Euronews / privacy-risk pieces**: highlight controversy; often editorial.  
- **TikTok age detection deployment (Vandal; ComplexDiscovery)**: fact pattern that platforms are implementing stronger age assurance under regulatory pressure. Some outlets are trade/analysis rather than primary reporting; still useful.

### Key limitation (dominant uncertainty)
- We **do not observe the current Metaculus community prediction** for #41173. With only ~13 days to the snapshot, the best predictor is “where it already is”.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criteria: community forecast >26%)

### Strong evidence (large weight)
1) **EU Commission has a concrete blueprint + pilots for an EU-wide age verification solution** (EC site; multiple corroborations including EU Perspectives, Taylor Wessing).  
- Mechanism: makes an eventual mandate more feasible; increases forecaster plausibility that EU could “require” it before 2027.  
- This tends to **push community probability upward** vs a world with no infrastructure.

2) **Commission willingness to enforce national age limits on VLOPs under DSA** (Le Monde/AFP).  
- Mechanism: even without new “EU-wide law,” the EU could effectively “require” age verification through DSA enforcement supporting member-state age limits.  
- That ambiguity/interpretation can raise the Metaculus community forecast (forecasters may see a path to “require” without a brand-new regulation).

### Moderate evidence (moderate weight)
3) **Pan-European political momentum**: EP non-binding resolution + multiple national initiatives (France, Poland discussions, German minister calls).  
- Mechanism: increases chance Commission proposes/accelerates action; increases salience and may nudge Metaculus community upward modestly.

4) **Platform behavior changes (TikTok/Meta using AI + appeals with ID/selfie services)** under EU pressure.  
- Mechanism: suggests de facto tightening; forecasters might update toward “this is coming anyway,” boosting probability some.

### Weak evidence (small weight)
5) **Opinion pieces warning about surveillance/privacy** (various).  
- Mechanism: could cut both ways (political backlash reduces mandate probability; or concern increases desire for “privacy-preserving” EU solution). Net effect unclear; I treat as small.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** 13 days (2026-02-02 → 2026-02-15).  
- In such a short window, Metaculus community predictions are typically **sticky** unless there is a discrete EU-level announcement (e.g., Commission proposes binding act; Council agreement; major enforcement precedent explicitly requiring age verification).

**If timeframe were halved (~6–7 days):** I’d move slightly **toward 50/50** because there’s less time for any news-driven drift; outcome depends even more on the current unknown value.  
**If timeframe were doubled (~26 days):** I’d shift **up a bit** (a few points) because the current news cycle suggests continuing coverage and political pressure, which more often nudges “child safety regulation” probabilities upward than downward—though still modestly.

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view (58%) to an inside view

### Step 1: Base-rate anchor (from outside view)
Outside view: **58%** that community prediction will be >26% on Feb 15.

### Step 2: What’s changed / what matters most for the meta-forecast
The most update-relevant facts are:
- The EU is not just “talking”—it has an **age verification blueprint and pilots** linked to DSA implementation and the EUDI wallet timeline.
- The Commission has signaled (at least publicly) it can **enforce national age limits on platforms** via DSA oversight, which creates a credible pathway to “EU requires mandatory age verification” *without* a single grand EU-wide statute.
- Meanwhile, member states are actively moving (France especially), increasing the perceived plausibility of EU-level requirement before 2027.

These factors make it **more likely that Metaculus forecasters sit above a low threshold like 26%**, because they can see at least one workable causal pathway to the outcome.

### Step 3: Counterweights
- EP resolution is non-binding; EU legislative machinery is slow; “mandatory” EU-wide requirements by end-2026 remain far from assured.  
- Privacy/civil liberties resistance could slow or constrain any mandate.

Net: I update **slightly upward** from 58% because the evidence bundle supports “credible path exists,” which tends to keep community forecasts from sinking below the mid-20s.

Probability calibration:
- Outside-view anchor: **58%**
- Inside-view adjustment: **+4 percentage points** (moderate) due to (i) Commission blueprint/pilots, (ii) enforcement pathway via DSA for national age rules, (iii) continuing multi-country political momentum.
- Final inside-view: **62%**

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Will Metaculus #41173 community probability at 2026-02-15 08:46:18 be >26% (Yes) or ≤26% (No)?”
2) Outside view base rate: 58%.
3) Consistency: “62 out of 100 times, the community prediction is above 26% at the snapshot.”
4) Key evidence (3–5):
   - EC age verification blueprint + pilots (July 2025 onward).
   - Commission stance on enforcing national age limits via DSA (Le Monde/AFP Jan 2026).
   - EP resolution + rising national proposals (Nov 2025–Feb 2026).
   - Platforms deploying stronger age checks in Europe under pressure.
5) Blind spot: If the Metaculus community currently sits well below 26% (e.g., ~15–20%) and is stable, I’ll look wrong; my forecast implicitly assumes it’s near/above the mid-20s.
6) Status quo: In 13 days, forecasts are sticky; thus avoid huge moves—only modest uplift.

Probability: 62%
