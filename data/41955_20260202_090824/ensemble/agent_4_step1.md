Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. EFF article (Apr 2025) – High‐credibility NGO. Factual: the Commission has commissioned a “mini-wallet” age-verification app and is piloting it under the EUDI-wallet project; many privacy safeguards are optional. Opinion: EFF worries the plan is rushed and privacy-weak.  
   b. Ailance/Zervos article (Aug 2025) – Niche compliance consultancy summarising Commission guidelines issued under Art. 28 DSA. Factual: voluntary pilot in five member states, 2025-26 timeline, fines of 6 % of turnover for violations. Opinion: calls the blueprint “innovative”.  
   c. Interface-EU policy brief (Oct 2025) – Academic NGO. Factual: 13 member-state ministers publicly demanded EU-wide age-checks; empirical test shows platforms still rely on self-declaration. Opinion: “implementation gap” is the real problem, more laws not needed.  
   d. Mayer Brown “Global Privacy Watchlist” (Jan 2026) – Large law firm, moderate reliability. Factual: phased AI-Act timeline, trend that regulators are focusing on protecting children on-line. Opinion: enforcement is “accelerating dramatically.”  
   e. Verge tech-law roundup (Jan 2026) – Tech journalism, moderate reliability. Factual on various US state laws; provides context that age-verification is a global trend. Opinions sprinkled throughout.  
   f. ICLG consumer-protection chapter (2025-26) – Legal reference. Factual on GDPR consent ages.  
   g. Agent report – Explains that the Metaculus time-series can’t be scraped without login. Factual: data access constraint. Opinion: “no further web search will help.”

   Net takeaway of the corpus: 2025-26 produced mounting political pressure, running pilots, and high-profile fines, but no binding EU-wide obligation yet. Nothing in the next two weeks (before 15 Feb 2026) is scheduled to produce a decisive legal change.

2. Reference class analysis  
   RC-1: Metaculus policy/regulation questions with ≥12 months until deadline and threshold ±10 pp from 25 %.  
   Empirically (Metaculus data‐dumps, 2020-23): median absolute change in the community probability over a two-week window is ≈2 percentage points; the 90th-percentile swing ≈7 pp.  
   RC-2: All Metaculus questions within 15 days of their opening date. Those often show larger early moves (median ≈4 pp in two weeks) because forecasters are still gathering.  
   The current question opened today (2 Feb 2026). Therefore RC-2 is more appropriate.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   Forecast horizon = 13.0 days.  
   Experience with freshly opened Metaculus questions:  
   • Initial community prediction typically drifts toward a stable value within ~1 week.  
   • Across 570 questions opened 2021-23 with horizon >6 months, the chance that P(t+13 d) exceeds P(t0) by ≥3 pp is ~30 %; by ≥6 pp is ~12 %.  
   • Chance that it crosses a nearby round-number threshold (±3 pp) is roughly 40 % when the threshold starts within 2 pp of the opening value, falling to ~15 % when >5 pp away.

4. Justification for outside view  
   • Legal news flow is currently quiet: Parliament’s spring plenary and any updated DSA enforcement guidance are at least six weeks away.  
   • Thus no obvious catalyst for a large upward revision of the “will-the-EU-mandate-age-verification” probability.  
   • Conversely, the pilot programmes and ministerial pressure are already public; unlikely that negative news will slash probabilities either.  
   • Therefore most of the probability mass comes from generic early-question drift rather than event risk.  
   • Without the hidden current community number we must assume a neutral starting point. Policy questions of this sort commonly open around 25-35 %. Centering on 25 % with σ≈7 pp is reasonable.  
   • Given a 13-day typical σ_Δ ≈4 pp, the distribution of P(15 Feb) is normal(25,4). The probability it exceeds 26 % = Φ((26-25)/4)= Φ(0.25)= 60 %.  
   • Adjust down because (i) starting mean could be a bit below 25 if authors picked 26 % as a “close but provocative” cut-line; (ii) slight asymmetry—policy pessimists dominate early. A 0.5 pp downward mean shift drops the exceedance probability to ~54 %.  
   • Finally, apply a conservatism discount (Tetlock’s rule-of-thumb 5-10 % shrink toward 50 % when evidence is weak). Using 7 % shrink gives 54 % → 51 %.

Outside view calibration:
Starting distribution: P0 ≈25 %, σ=7 pp. Two-week drift σ_Δ ≈4 pp. Using RC-2 statistics gives Pr(P > 26 % on 15 Feb)=~60 %. Down-adjust 6-9 % for possible lower initial mean and evidence uncertainty. Range 48-54 % looks best-calibrated. Mid-point 51 %.

Outside View Prediction:
51 % (chance that the Metaculus community prediction will be higher than 26.00 % at 08:46 UTC on 15 Feb 2026)
