Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, 2025-02-01 to 2026-02-02)
1. EU Commission “age-verification blueprint” page (official, Jul-2025).  Facts: pilot mini-wallet, interoperability with EU Digital ID, no binding law yet.  Quality: high, primary.  Opinion: none stated.  
2. Taylor Wessing legal review (Dec-2025).  Facts: DSA enforcement actions, 5-country pilot, national AV laws.  Quality: good professional summary.  Opinion: the compliance climate is “increasingly demanding”.  
3. Le Monde / AFP (Jan-2025).  Facts: Commission says France may ban <15s, EU will enforce via DSA.  Quality: mainstream news.  Opinion: politicians quoted.  
4. DW + Europarl press releases (Nov-2025).  Facts: EP non-binding vote for 16+ default.  Quality: primary / reputable.  Opinion: MEP statements.  
5-14. AskNews items (Jan-31 → Feb-02 2026).  Facts: New national bills (Poland, Germany-Hessen, Turkey, India); Australia law in force; TikTok removing 6 M under-age accts/mo across Europe; privacy/security debates.  Quality: mixed—mostly reputable national outlets reporting official proposals or laws.  Opinions: advocates, critics, ministers.  All dated within the last 3 days.

Factual convergence:  • Multiple member states advancing or already enforcing AV-based bans.  • EU toolset readying for 2026 roll-out.  • No EU legislative mandate has yet passed.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Structural: Digital Services Act already in force, empowers Commission to demand effective AV (confirmed by enforcement actions vs porn sites & TikTok).  
• Historical trend: 2025-26 saw AU, FR, DK, NO adopt statutory age bans; momentum is accelerating (5 fresh national initiatives in 72 h).

Moderate evidence  
• EP’s 483-92 vote signals political will but is non-binding.  
• Commission AV blueprint pilots in 5 member states show technical feasibility.  
• TikTok/Meta large-scale AV deployment demonstrates industry readiness.

Weak evidence  
• Civil-liberty push-back & privacy-breach stories could stall legislation but lack concrete veto power in short term.  
• Some national bills may never pass.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast window: 13 days (02-Feb → 15-Feb-2026).  Community predictions on Metaculus typically drift < 5 pp over two weeks unless a decisive event lands.  If window were halved (6 days) I would widen error bars but keep mean similar (±3 pp).  If doubled (26 days) drift risk grows; I’d lower “>26 %” probability ~3 pp to reflect mean-reversion after news hype fades.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view baseline (stickiness, unknown current level) = 49 %.  
Upward adjustments (+11 pp)  
+6 pp  Rapid sequence of new national bans/proposals (Poland, Germany, Turkey, India) provides fresh “headline evidence” that can nudge forecasters upward.  
+3 pp  TikTok’s EU-wide AI AV roll-out & Commission DSA probes show enforcement pathway without new legislation.  
+2 pp  No counter-news indicating EU retreat; EP vote still salient.  
Downward adjustments (-0 pp within 2-week horizon; privacy criticism unlikely to move community sharply in such a short span).

Net inside-view = 60 %.  This implies: “In 60 cases out of 100 the community probability on 15-Feb exceeds 26 %.”

Probability calibration
I assign a 60 % chance that the Metaculus community prediction will be strictly higher than 26 % at the cutoff.  10 pp up/down sensitivity: if new binding EU proposal were tabled next week, I’d raise to ~75 %; if Commission explicitly said ‘no new mandate before 2028’, I’d drop to ~35 %.

Checklist:
1. Restated criterion: At 08:46 UTC on 15-Feb-2026 the Metaculus community forecast for “EU mandatory AV before 2027” must exceed 26 %.  
2. Base rate: 49 % (unknown current value, 2-week stickiness).  
3. Consistency: “60 of 100 times, the forecast will sit above 26 % on 15-Feb.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Wave of Feb-2026 national AV bills. b) DSA enforcement & TikTok mass AV. c) EP 483-vote for 16+ age floor. d) EU AV blueprint pilots under way.  
5. Blind-spot: Hidden current Metaculus value already far below 20 %; stickiness would then doom this forecast.  
6. Status-quo bias: Short horizon + normally sluggish forecast shifts → argue for caution, hence only +11 pp adjustment.

Probability: 60%
