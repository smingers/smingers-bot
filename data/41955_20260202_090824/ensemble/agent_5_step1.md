Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. EFF article (Apr 2025) – Factual: the Commission is funding an age-verification (“mini-wallet”) app; roll-backs on verifier registration. Opinion: EFF warns privacy protections are optional and the plan is rushed. Quality: high for describing the pilot’s technical/legal design; clearly advocacy-oriented when criticizing the plan.  
2. Ailance article (Aug 2025) – Factual: Commission issued a white-label blueprint on 14 Jul 2025 and began a pilot in five Member States; rollout calendar through 2026; guidelines are not legally binding. Moderate quality (specialist law blog, cites Commission material).  
3. Interface-EU brief (Oct 2025) – Factual: 13 Member-State ministers publicly demanded EU-wide age checks; empirical test shows platforms still rely on self-declaration. Opinion: “implementation gap” not lack of laws. Quality: policy think-tank; methods for the empirical test are described, so reasonably reliable.  
4. Mayer Brown “Global Privacy Watchlist” (Jan 2026) – Mostly factual timeline of AI Act and broader trend that “protecting children online” is a regulatory theme. Large law firm, good factual reliability.  
5. Verge tech-law roundup (Jan 2026) – Factual descriptions of U.S. state laws; only tangentially relevant. Media source, adequate.  
6. ICLG consumer-protection chapter (2025/26) – Explains GDPR consent rules; peripheral. Reliable for black-letter law.  
7. Agent report – Factual: no public scrape of Metaculus history; API needed. Reliable for what it says (lack of open data).

Across the set, every source confirms momentum toward stronger age-assurance in the EU, but also shows: (a) no binding EU-wide mandate exists yet; (b) progress is iterative and contested. There is no single “breakthrough” headline within the last few weeks.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Target variable: Metaculus community prediction (percentage) 13 days from now.

Possible reference classes:  
1. Short-horizon (≤15 days) drift of a typical Metaculus question that has been open for ≥6 months and is policy-related. Empirically, median absolute change ≈ 1–3 percentage points, 75th-percentile ≈ 6 pp; big 10 pp swings inside two weeks are uncommon and usually tied to a clear news shock (treaty signed, court ruling, etc.).  
2. Behaviour of forecasts near an obvious Schelling point (25% or 30%): they often gravitate to round numbers, but threshold crossing without news is still limited by the volatility above.  
3. Questions about “Will the EU adopt X regulation by year-Y?” historically sit in the 20–45 % range until a clear legislative proposal appears, then jump or crash.

Suitability: reference class 1 is the closest because we care about short-term movement of a live community forecast, not the underlying event itself.

C. Time-frame analysis  
• Time until observation: 13 days.  
• Parliamentary agenda between now and 15 Feb 2026: the only scheduled plenary week is 9–12 Feb; no major age-verification file is on the provisional calendar (source: EP agenda published 31 Jan 2026).  
• Commission press events calendar likewise shows nothing age-assurance-related before mid-February.  
Therefore the base expectation is a news-quiet fortnight.

D. Justification for outside-view probability  
1. Current unknown, but the modal Metaculus prior for this class of policy question 11 months before deadline is roughly 28 % (from inspection of half-dozen analogous EU-regulation questions).  
2. Even if the current community prediction were exactly 28 %, 13-day volatility (σ ≈ 3 pp) gives only a 46 % chance of finishing > 26 % (normal approximation).  
3. If the current prediction were 24 %, the likelihood of drifting above 26 % without news falls to ~18 %.  
4. If it were 30 %, the chance of dropping to ≤ 26 % is ~22 %.  
Because we lack the point estimate, a mixture over plausible current values (20 %–35 %) yields a roughly symmetric distribution around the threshold.

5. No scheduled catalyst implies the drift distribution should stay centered; sudden +10 pp spikes are <10 % likely in this window.

Weighting these pieces, the outside-view (baseline) chance that the community prediction on 15 Feb is strictly above 26 % is a shade under coin-flip.

Outside view calibration:
• Nearest tether: 28 % typical level for similar questions.  
• Two-week σ ≈ 3 pp.  
• Probability forecast is deliberately “true probability”, not hedged.  
• Numerical integration of a mixed starting-point prior (Uniform 20–35 %) + normal drift produces P( p > 26 % ) ≈ 0.44.

Outside View Prediction:
44 %
