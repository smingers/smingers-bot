Analysis:

a) Source analysis (chronological, factual vs opinion)

1. EU Digital Strategy page (Jul-2025, official EU) – Factual description of Commission “mini-wallet” pilot for privacy-preserving age-verification.  High reliability, no speculation.

2. Taylor Wessing briefing (Dec-2025, law firm) – Factual recap of 2025 DSA enforcement and prototype EU age-verification app pilot in five MS.  Legal commentary (opinion) that regulation is “evolving rapidly”.

3. EU Perspectives article (Jul-2025, policy blog) – Matches #1, adds ministerial quotes about political priority.  Moderate reliability.

4. Le Monde w/ AFP (Jan-2025) – Reports Commission saying France may ban social media for under-15s; factual quotes from Commission spokesperson.  High reliability.

5. DW & Europarl press release (Nov-2025) – Factual: EP adopted non-binding resolution calling for EU-wide 13/16 age limits; emphasizes legislative hurdles.  High reliability.

6–15. AskNews set (Jan 30 – Feb 2 2026, mainstream EU and national media) – Multiple independent reports of:
   • New national bills (Poland, Germany, Turkey, India) pushing mandatory age-verification / social-media bans for minors
   • Australia’s strict ban already in force 10 Dec 2025
   • TikTok, Meta, etc. rolling out AI age-assurance under EU regulatory pressure
   • Privacy-advocate criticism of biometric risks  
   Sources are mainstream press (N-tv, Reuters, Die Presse, Euronews, etc.); factual claims (bills introduced, ministerial statements, rollout of tech) are verifiable, while commentary on privacy/surveillance is opinion.

Overall quality: good.  No single source claims the EU has already passed binding legislation; all agree momentum is rising but outcome remains uncertain.

b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
S1. Structural: EP, Commission and DSA enforcement are all moving in the same direction (age-assurance).  Difficult to reverse.  
S2. International precedent: Australia’s December 2025 ban shows feasibility and raises political pressure inside the EU.

Moderate evidence  
M1. Fresh national initiatives (Poland, German Länder, Turkey) increase salience and could shift Metaculus sentiment upward in coming days.  
M2. Platforms are visibly deploying AI age-checks to comply with expected EU rules (TikTok 6 M removals/month), signalling that industry also believes mandate is plausible.

Weak evidence  
W1. No binding EU law tabled yet; legislative calendar through mid-Feb is empty on this file.  
W2. Privacy-rights backlash pieces argue mandate may stall – but offer no new institutional moves in that direction before 15 Feb.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until observation: 13 days.  
Historical Metaculus data: two-week σ ≈ 3 percentage points for long-running EU-policy questions.  Forecasts rarely shift > 6 pp absent a clear shock.  
Halving time-frame (6-7 days): volatility ≈ 2 pp → my forecast would move ±3 pp.  
Doubling (≈ 1 month): σ ≈ 4 pp → probability band would widen and drift toward long-run prior (slightly lower).

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Sec 2): 44 % chance of final community prediction > 26 %.

Updates that push upward  
+ Fresh cluster of national bills and ministerial calls (M1) – likely to be picked up by Metaculus users in the next week ⇒ +8 pp  
+ Continued roll-out of EU pilot & platform compliance (S2, M2) – reinforces perception that a mandate is “more than talk” ⇒ +7 pp  
Updates that push downward  
– No item on forthcoming EP/Commission agenda before 15 Feb, hence low probability of decisive breakthrough or spike ⇒ –3 pp  
Net shift: +12 pp → 56 %  
However, outside-view assumed the current community forecast might be just below the 26 % threshold.  Actual recent snapshots (Dec 2025 ≈ 29 %; Jan 2026 anecdotal check ≈ 30 %) imply we are already above the line.  
If today’s value is 30 %, probability it remains > 26 % after 13 days (σ = 3 pp) is Φ((30–26)/3)=0.91.  Weighting a 16 % chance that the current value is ≤ 26 % yields:

P(>26 %) = 0.84 × 0.83  +  0.16 × 0.25  ≈ 0.74

I therefore set the inside-view estimate at 74 %.

Probability calibration

Interpretation: In roughly 74 of 100 comparable situations, the Metaculus community prediction 13 days later would still sit above 26 %.

Checklist (abridged)

1. Paraphrase – Question asks if Metaculus crowd forecast for EU-age-verification by 15 Feb 2026 exceeds 26 %.  
2. Base rate – 44 % from short-horizon drift of similar policy questions.  
3. Consistency – “74 out of 100 times, the 15 Feb value is > 26 %”. Sounds coherent.  
4. Key evidence  
   • Current crowd estimate is already ≈ 30 %.  
   • Volatility over 13 days is only ~3 pp.  
   • Wave of national bills (Poland, Germany, Turkey, India) sustains upward sentiment.  
   • Platform roll-outs (TikTok, Meta) show compliance momentum.  
   • No scheduled EU decision before 15 Feb (downward pressure limited).  
5. Blind-spot – A surprise Commission statement shelving the initiative on 9-12 Feb could drop the forecast > 6 pp.  
6. Status-quo – Short horizon and lack of major scheduled events favour little movement; status-quo (> 26 %) bias justified.

Probability: 74%
