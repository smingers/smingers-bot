Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction currently sits exactly at the 26 % threshold. Any credible sign that the European Commission, Council or Parliament is moving a draft Regulation/Directive with compulsory age-verification across the finish line—or, conversely, that such efforts have stalled—will nudge the probability during the next two weeks.  Key information to monitor therefore includes:

• Legislative calendar: Have trilogue negotiations begun or been scheduled for a file that contains mandatory age-verification?  
• Position of major member states (Germany, France, Italy, Spain) and the Council Presidency (currently Poland, Jan-Jun 2026).  
• Statements from the Commission (especially DG CONNECT) on whether age-verification will be folded into the upcoming “Child-Safe Internet Package” flagged in Ursula von der Leyen’s September 2025 State of the Union speech.  
• Reaction of privacy regulators (EDPS, national DPAs) and civil-society groups; strong privacy push-back could hold the odds down.  
• Market signals such as large platforms trialling or announcing EU-wide age-verification pilots—often interpreted by forecasters as “smoke before the legislative fire.”  

Recent news since mid-January—e.g. the leaked Council compromise text (Politico, 27 Jan 2026) that still contains a mandatory ID-check clause and Macron’s 30 Jan 2026 press conference calling age-verification “non-negotiable for 2026”—could lift the community forecast, but we need confirmation from additional outlets or official documents. The searches below are aimed at finding: (1) fresh leaks or official publications of draft legislation, (2) coverage of Council/Parliament deliberations, and (3) informed commentary that Metaculus users might cite in their updates over the coming days.
