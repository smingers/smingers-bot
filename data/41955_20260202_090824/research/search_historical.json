Users download the app and request proof of their age\n2. Age verification methods include: national eID schemes, physical ID cards, linking to banking apps, or age assessment through third parties (banks/notaries)\n3. The app generates a proof of age\n4. When accessing age-restricted content, platforms request proof through the app\n5. The app presents proof of age, allowing the service to verify and grant access\n\n### Technical Specifications and Privacy Concerns\n\n**Privacy Mechanisms (mostly optional, not mandatory):**\n- The specifications mention data minimization, unlinkability, storage limitations, and transparency as key concerns\n- The app \"should\" implement salted hashes and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), but is **not required** to do so\n- Many privacy protection mechanisms are optional rather than mandatory requirements\n\n**Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) Issues:**\n- The specifications heavily rely on ZKPs while simultaneously acknowledging that **no compatible ZKP solution is currently available**\n- ZKPs can provide \"yes-or-no\" claims (like above/below 18) without revealing exact age\n- The article notes this is \"a brand new system affecting millions of people\" being rushed before research matures\n- Not all ZKP systems are the same, and implementation on mobile devices is still being researched\n\n### Verifier Regulation Concerns\n- Recent changes have **rolled back** requirements for verifier registration certificates across EU member states\n- The Commission's mini-AV wallet **will not require verifier registration in the beginning**\n- Without verifier accountability, users face an \"imbalanced relationship\" with service providers requesting age verification\n\n### Accessibility Issues\n- The article notes the wallet will rely on four methods for age issuance and proving, with national eID schemes being the first option\n- The article appears to be cut off before completing discussion of accessibility and participation issues\n\n## EFF's Assessment (Named Source Opinion)\nThe EFF expresses concerns that:\n- Privacy protections are optional rather than mandatory\n- The system is being rushed to implementation before the technology matures\n- There is insufficient regulation of verifiers (service providers requesting age verification)\n- ZKPs are being presented as \"the solution\" when they are only \"part of one\"\n- The system puts millions of users at risk with sensitive government-issued ID data\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be part 2 of a 3-part series and the extracted content is incomplete, cutting off mid-discussion of accessibility issues.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://2b-advice.com/en/2025/08/13/eu-age-verification-data-protection-compliant-age-verification-under-the-digital-services-act/\">\n# Summary of Article: EU Age Verification Under Digital Services Act\n\n**Source:** Ailance  \n**Date:** August 13, 2025  \n**Author:** Aristotelis Zervos\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline\n\n**Commission Action:**\n- On July 14, 2025, the European Commission published the first version of a white-label \"Age Verification\" blueprint and launched an EU-wide pilot phase\n- This is part of implementing the Digital Services Act (DSA), specifically Article 28, which requires online platforms to take effective protective measures for minors\n- The guidelines are **not legally binding** but serve as an evaluation standard for supervision under Art. 28(1) DSA\n\n**Pilot Program:**\n- Initially involves five member states: Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, and Italy\n- Source code and specifications are available as Open Source\n\n**Planned Timeline:**\n- **Q3-Q4/2025:** National onboarding of pilot countries, initial production tests with voluntary platforms\n- **Q1-Q2/2026:** Expansion to additional member states; hardening of reference implementation; preparation of platform integration guidelines\n- **From 2026:** Optional integration with EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) as it becomes nationally available; successive adoption by platforms in high-risk areas\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n**Privacy-Focused Design:**\n- System enables users to prove their age (e.g., \u226518 years) without disclosing personal data\n- Only proof of minimum age transmitted, without other identity data\n- Based on \"privacy by design\" principle\n\n**Verification Methods:**\n- State e-ID\n- ID card with e-ID function\n- Bank KYC proof\n- Biometric age estimation\n- Third-party proof (banks, notaries)\n\n## Regulatory Context\n\n**Enforcement:**\n- Violations of DSA can result in fines up to **6% of global annual sales**\n- Guidelines address all platforms allowing access to minors, not just Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs)\n\n**Note:** The article characterizes this as a \"planned\" and \"innovative\" approach, emphasizing it represents a data protection-focused implementation pathway rather than a mandatory legal requirement at this stage.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.interface-eu.org/publications/age-assurance-gap\">\n# Summary of Interface-EU Policy Brief: \"Mind the Gap: Age Assurance and the Limits of Enforcement under EU Law\"\n\n**Publication Details:**\n- Author: Interface\n- Published: October 13, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Political Developments:**\n- Early June 2025: French President Emmanuel Macron announced intention to ban social media for under-15s in France \"in the coming months\" if no EU-level progress was made\n- Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain joined France in supporting EU-wide age check mechanisms\n- Two weeks after Macron's announcement: 21 ministers from 13 Member States signed an op-ed calling for \"decisive action now\" to protect children online, stating the existing legal framework \"remains insufficient\"\n\n**Empirical Testing Results:**\nThe research conducted original testing of the most popular platforms among EU minors: Discord, Fortnite, Instagram, Roblox, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube.\n\n**Findings were unambiguous:**\n- All tested services rely on self-declaration mechanisms for age checks during account creation\n- None have implemented robust age assurance\n- Where parental consent tools exist (notably YouTube and Fortnite), they can be easily bypassed or are applied only after account creation\n- In practice, minors can access these services freely while platforms remain noncompliant with legal obligations\n\n## Key Arguments:\n\n**Central Thesis:**\nThe paper argues that the key problem is **not a lack of legislation** but rather **a failure of implementation and enforcement** of existing EU laws.\n\n**Existing Legal Framework:**\nOver the past 15 years, the EU has adopted an \"increasingly dense set of measures\" including:\n- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n- Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD)\n- Digital Services Act (DSA)\n- Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act)\n- Better Internet for Kids+ (BIK+) Strategy\n\nMember States have also introduced their own rules (France's Loi SREN, Germany's Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag).\n\n**Implementation Gap:**\nDespite this framework, there is a \"striking\" gap between what the law requires and what happens in practice. The paper identifies three interrelated issues:\n1. Ineffectiveness of self-declaration as an age assurance method\n2. Systematic absence of compliance (e.g., platforms using \"performance of a contract\" as legal basis for processing minors' data under GDPR without checking if users have legal capacity to enter contracts)\n3. Overall failure of enforcement due to authorities lacking resources, clarity of mandate, or \"less optimistically the will\" to sanction noncompliant practices\n\n## Opinions and Positions:\n\n**Industry Actors (Named):**\n- Some companies (e.g., Meta, Aylo) argue for parental consent or age assurance mechanisms at the operating system level\n- Others (e.g., Google, Apple) resist such approaches\n- These positions reflect \"different business interests\"\n\n**European Commission:**\n- Has released detailed guidelines under Article 28 of the DSA on protecting minors online, which \"largely put the emphasis on age assurance\"\n\n## Recommendations:\n\nThe paper's \"central message\" is that **\"more legislation is not the solution\"** in the short run. Instead, it proposes:\n- Clarifying mandates of enforcement authorities\n- Improving coordination between EU and national-level bodies\n- Supporting development of by-default and by-design tools that safeguard rights of all users\n- Focusing on making existing rules work by ensuring minors' rights are \"protected in practice\"\n\nThe paper emphasizes the need to close the \"implementation gap\" rather than adding another legislative layer.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2026/01/global-privacy-watchlist\">\n# Summary of Article: Global Privacy Watchlist | Insights | Mayer Brown\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics\n\n**EU AI Act Implementation Timeline:**\n- Entered into force: August 1, 2024\n- Prohibition on \"unacceptable risk\" AI systems became effective: February 2, 2025\n- Rules for high-risk AI systems come into effect: August 2026\n- Extended transition period for high-risk AI in certain regulated products: August 2027\n- Maximum penalties for violations: \u20ac35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher\n\n**GDPR Enforcement:**\n- Cumulative GDPR fines have exceeded \u20ac5.88 billion\n\n**US State AI Laws:**\n- Colorado AI Act takes effect: June 30, 2026 (postponed from February 1, 2026)\n- Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act: Effective January 1, 2026\n- Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act: Took effect May 1, 2024\n- Illinois AI employment law: Effective January 1, 2026\n\n## Regulatory Developments\n\n**EU:**\n- November 2025: European Commission adopted a Digital Package on Simplification proposing amendments to streamline EU AI Act implementation\n- The proposal includes reinforcing the AI Office's powers, centralizing oversight, extending simplifications to SMEs, and adjusting timelines for high-risk rules\n- EU Digital Omnibus proposal includes amendments to GDPR to clarify legal bases for processing in the context of AI\n\n**Cross-Cutting Themes Identified:**\n1. Regulators worldwide focusing on protecting children online, with jurisdictions pursuing/considering social media bans for minors and new age verification requirements\n2. Enforcement activity accelerating dramatically\n3. Cross-border data transfers remain a flashpoint\n4.

instead, it's regulated through separate provisions\n   - GDPR applies to processing of personal data for advertising purposes, while Directives govern the use of specific communication channels\n\n2. **Consent Requirements:**\n   - Under the strictest approach, both email and telephone marketing require recipient consent\n   - Exception exists for \"Follow-Up-Advertising\" by email (beneficial for recurring consumption goods/services)\n   - Consent requirements can be combined: consent for communication channel use + consent for personal data processing\n\n3. **Age Restrictions:**\n   - GDPR establishes that minors under 16 years cannot provide consent for data processing\n   - Member States may lower this to 13 years, but for transnational campaigns, the 16-year threshold should be considered\n\n4. **Geographic Scope:**\n   - GDPR applies to both EU-established entities and third-country entities (including US companies) when processing personal data of EU residents for marketing purposes\n\n5. **Compliance Strategy:**\n   - Businesses designing EU-wide campaigns are advised to use the \"strictest approach\" as a guideline\n   - Additional requirements may apply based on specific products (insurance, banking, gambling) or sales methods (distant selling, website sales)\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not directly address age verification requirements for social media or AI platforms.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide the historical community prediction time-series for Metaculus question 41173 from launch through 2026-02-02, highlight major jumps and corresponding news events; also summarize any discussions in the comment thread pointing to future EU legislative timelines.\nDespite issuing a second round of Web-searches, no publicly indexed page, scrape, cache, screenshot or mirror was found that contains either  \n\n\u2022 the \u201chistory\u201d array of community probabilities for Metaculus question #41173, or  \n\u2022 the associated discussion thread.  \n\nEvery relevant hit that surfaced (documentation for third-party Metaculus-API wrappers, Manifold\u2019s mirror market, etc.) merely reconfirms that the data exist behind the Metaculus API and are only delivered to an authenticated session; unauthenticated crawlers\u2014and hence Google/Bing/Archive.org\u2014are systematically blocked.\u00b9\n\nWhat the new searches did add were richer open-web sources on EU-AI-Act milestones\u2014useful later for mapping forecast jumps once the numerical series is in hand. Examples include:\n\n\u2022 Political agreement on the Act (8 Dec 2023) and forthcoming formal approvals (European Parliament topics page \u2013 Aug 2023 update) (European Parliament source).  \n\u2022 Plenary approval by Parliament (Mar 2024) and expected publication window (May\u2013Jul 2024) (Brookings, 14 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Target entry-into-force dates and phased applicability (IAPP cheat-sheet, 11 Dec 2023).  \n\u2022 Prospective dates for the GPAI \u201cCode of Practice\u201d endorsement (2 Aug 2025) and national sandbox deadlines (2 Aug 2026) (Stibbe, 14 Jul 2025; ArtificialIntelligenceAct.eu, Nov 2025).  \n\nThose events are likely candidates for pronounced shifts in the community forecast, but until the actual {t, p} datapoints are retrieved we cannot prove or quantify any jump.\n\nTherefore the deliverable the user requested remains blocked on four still-missing artefacts:\n\n1. Launch, close and (if resolved early) resolution dates of Q #41173.  \n2. Full prediction-time-series from launch \u2192 02 Feb 2026 (the raw Metaculus \u201chistory\u201d array).  \n3. Identification of largest \u2206p swings and annotation with contemporaneous news items (requires #2).  \n4. The complete comment thread in order to summarise community expectations about future EU legislative timelines.\n\nNo amount of further open-web searching is likely to surface those datasets; they reside only behind the Metaculus API and require an authenticated pull. The technical route is straightforward (documented at https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41173/?include_history=true for the history array and /comments for the thread), but it must be executed from a logged-in account.\n\nConclusion: additional *search* is no longer the bottleneck; direct API retrieval is indispensable. Once the JSON is downloaded, we can:\n\n\u2022 parse the \u201chistory\u201d list into a time-series,  \n\u2022 compute daily/weekly differences to flag major jumps,  \n\u2022 overlay the EU-AI-Act news timeline (sources above), and  \n\u2022 read, cluster and summarise the comment discourse.\n\nUntil those steps are taken, the answer cannot satisfy the original user request.</Agent_report>\n"
