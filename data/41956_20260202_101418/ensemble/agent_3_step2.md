Analysis:
### 1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolve **Yes** if UHS’s **market close price on 2026-02-14** (Yahoo Finance) is **strictly higher** than its **market close price on 2026-02-02**; otherwise **No**. (Note: 2026-02-14 is a Saturday; Yahoo often shows the last trading day’s close, typically 2026-02-13. I assume the API’s “close for 2026-02-14” will effectively map to that most recent close.)

### (a) Source analysis (quality, date, what’s fact vs opinion)
1) **Yahoo Finance / Simply Wall St (Jan 29, 2026)**  
   - **Quality:** Medium. Contains real price/return context but valuation is model/opinion.  
   - **Facts:** recent close around ~$200; 1-month and 3-month declines; YTD down.  
   - **Opinions:** “fair value” ~$250 and “undervalued” thesis; outpatient behavioral expansion narrative.

2) **MarketBeat (Feb 1, 2026) – Summit Global trims**  
   - **Quality:** Medium. 13F/institutional ownership and price stats are factual; “what it means” is mostly commentary.  
   - **Facts:** stock around ~$201; 50DMA ~$219.6; 200DMA ~$203; beta ~1.28; institutional ownership ~86%; analyst rating mix and average PT ~$234.  
   - **Opinions:** implicit sentiment takeaways from institutional trimming.

3) **MarketBeat (Jan 27, 2026) – Teacher Retirement System of Texas decreases**  
   - **Quality:** Medium for the same reason (13F facts, interpretation weaker).  
   - **Facts:** similar trading stats; reiterates Q3 beat (Oct 2025).  
   - **Opinions:** none that are strongly expert-cited beyond compiled analyst targets.

4) **Fierce Healthcare (Oct 30, 2025) – sector earnings recap**  
   - **Quality:** High for industry reporting; but dated relative to Feb 2026 window.  
   - **Facts:** UHS acute segment same-store revenue/admission jump; meaningful contribution from Medicaid supplemental payments.  
   - **Opinions:** forward-looking caution about policy landscape (not a precise forecast for 2-week stock moves).

5) **StockTitan (Oct 8, 2025) – earnings date announcement**  
   - **Quality:** High for the factual item, but not decision-relevant for this window.  
   - **Facts:** merely schedule/logistics.

6) **AskNews: Defense World reprints (Feb 1, 2026) – Summit trims / AlphaQuest adds**  
   - **Quality:** Low-to-medium. Largely repackaged 13F/MarketBeat-style facts; little incremental edge.  
   - **Facts:** reiterates analyst mix, moving averages, ownership, insider sale months earlier.  
   - **Opinions:** minimal and not from clearly identified experts.

7) **AskNews: SentimentTrading (Dec 31, 2025; Nov 7, 2025)**  
   - **Quality:** Medium-low. Reads promotional; some facts may be correct but not independently verified here.  
   - **Facts:** CEO extension (likely factual), past price levels.  
   - **Opinions:** bullish narrative; not tightly linked to a 12-day horizon.

8) **AskNews: Other unrelated articles (UHV power, U-Haul, Bitcoin, Europe indices, etc.)**  
   - **Quality:** Not relevant to UHS; no direct bearing on the resolution.

### (b) Evidence / factor weighting for this specific 2026-02-02 → 2026-02-14 price comparison
**Strong evidence (big shifts): none**  
No imminent UHS-specific catalyst in-window (earnings, FDA action, takeover, major litigation ruling, etc.) is identified. That keeps this near a “short-horizon drift/noise” base rate.

**Moderate evidence (medium shifts):**
1) **Short-term trend is weak / below key averages (bearish tilt)**  
   - Facts: price ~200–201 vs **50DMA ~219** and **200DMA ~203**; plus reported 1-month decline ~11%.  
   - Mechanism: under moving averages often correlates with negative near-term momentum / overhead supply.  
   - Weight: **moderate negative** for a 2-week horizon.

2) **Valuation/targets imply upside, but mostly long-horizon (small positive on short horizon)**  
   - Facts: analyst average PT around **$234**; multiple “Buy” ratings; P/E ~9–10.  
   - Mechanism: can create dip-buying support, but typically not a reliable 10-trading-day driver.  
   - Weight: **moderate-to-weak positive**.

**Weak evidence (small shifts):**
1) **13F trims/adds (mostly Q3 2025)**  
   - Facts but stale timing; many reasons unrelated to near-term expectations.  
   - Weight: **weak**.

2) **Insider selling months ago**  
   - Facts, but timing and context unclear; also not necessarily predictive over two weeks.  
   - Weight: **weak negative**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** from today (2026-02-02) to resolution date (2026-02-14) ≈ **12 calendar days** (~**9–10 trading days**).  
- In such a short window, idiosyncratic news + macro risk-on/risk-off dominates fundamentals.

**If timeframe were halved (~1 week):** closer to pure noise; I’d move closer to 50/50 (slightly above if broad market drift is positive).  
**If timeframe were doubled (~1 month):** valuation/support and mean reversion would matter more; I’d likely move a few points upward (UHS “undervaluation” and buy-side targets have more time to bite).

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view (56%) to an inside view
**Outside-view base rate given:** 56% (slight equity-drift advantage + some bullish analyst backdrop).

**Key inside-view adjustments:**
- **Downward adjustment (most important):** the *current tape* looks weak: UHS has been falling (reported ~11% down in 1 month) and sits well below its 50DMA (~219). For a 2-week question (“higher than today?”), negative momentum is a meaningful headwind.  
- **Upward adjustment:** UHS is near ~$200 with many targets well above; that can support bounce/mean reversion. But without a clear catalyst in this exact window, it’s not enough to keep a 56% edge.

Net: I trim the edge but don’t go to 50/50 because (i) there is still general equity drift, and (ii) the stock is not extended upward—some rebound potential exists after “recent share price weakness.”

Probability calibration:
- Start from outside view: **56% Yes**
- Momentum / below-50DMA / recent drawdown: **-4 to -6 pts**
- Valuation/targets/possible mean reversion support: **+1 to +3 pts**
- No clear in-window catalyst (keeps us near base rate, doesn’t add edge)

**Inside-view probability (final): 53%**

Checklist:
1) Criteria aligned: compare Yahoo Finance close on **2026-02-14** vs **2026-02-02**; Yes if higher.  
2) Outside view base rate used: **56%**.  
3) Consistency check: **53 out of 100 times**, UHS(2026-02-14 close) > UHS(2026-02-02 close).  
4) Top evidence:
   - Price ~200–201; **~11% down 1-month** (negative momentum).
   - **50DMA ~219** (price materially below; technical headwind).
   - Analyst average PT **~$234** (supportive but longer-horizon).
5) Blind spot: a sharp market-wide risk-on rally (or UHS-specific news) could lift UHS quickly, making “Yes” much more likely.  
6) Status quo: absent major news, short-horizon moves are close to coin-flip; I stayed near 50% with a small tilt.

Probability: 53%
