Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Nasdaq “earnings” stub – no usable data. Ignore.  
2. Markets Insider snapshot (30 Jan 2026) – purely backward-looking tables (analyst ratings, estimates). Factual but not directly about the 9-trading-day window in question. Quality: medium.  
3. Market Chameleon page – 404/error. Ignore.  
4. QuiverQuant insider-sale note (Nov 2025) – factual but stale; insider flow very light. Quality: medium; relevance: low for a 9-day horizon.  
5. ad-hoc-news article (2 Jan 2026) – mostly commentary. Facts: stock has been trending up, volatility low. Opinions are clearly labelled; they come from unnamed “major houses”, so limited weight. Quality: medium.  
6. Simply Wall St valuation piece (29 Jan 2026) – quantitative but long-term. Minimal bearing on 9-day move. Quality: medium.  
7. Agent report – method to retrieve full daily history and lists macro releases between 2 Feb and 14 Feb. Factual, high quality, directly relevant for reference-class construction.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• S&P 500 constituents’ probability that closing price 9 trading days later > today (generic U.S. share, 2010-2025). Historical studies put this at ≈53-55 %.  
• Health-Care Providers & Services industry, same horizon. Sector volatility is slightly below market; probability historically ≈54 %.  
• UHS itself, 2010-2025: 16 observations (Feb-02 to ~Feb-14 each year). Very small sample but closest match. Without downloading the CSV, we rely on the well-established finding that for individual large-mid-cap shares the 10-day “up” frequency clusters around 52-54 %.  
Given data scarcity for the exact UHS series, the “generic U.S. mid/large-cap stock over 9-10 trading days” reference class (≈54 %) is chosen.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Days until resolution: 12 calendar days, 9 NYSE trading sessions (no holidays).  
• Drift and volatility: At a 10 % annualised expected return the geometric drift over 9 sessions is ≈+0.34 %; one-sigma price move (20 % annualised vol) ≈±2.8 %. Hence direction is dominated by noise; edge of a few percentage points above 50 % is typical.  
• Seasonality: Early-February has no strong, persistent seasonal effect in UHS or S&P data.  
• Macro schedule: regular tier-1 U.S. releases (payrolls 6 Feb, CPI 11 Feb) could move the broad market but are symmetrically uncertain; no UHS-specific events pre-14 Feb. Status-quo bias therefore applies.

(d) Justification  
1. No known company catalyst (earnings call slated for 25 Feb).  
2. Market environment neutral-to-slightly-bullish: healthcare multiples still below market, analyst stance mildly positive, and broader equity indices near all-time highs (implied by analyst price targets). That tilts odds a hair upward.  
3. Very short horizon means idiosyncratic price noise dominates fundamentals. Historic base rate for an “up” outcome ≈53-54 %.  
4. Absence of bearish news (no legal, regulatory, or labour surprises flagged) removes any reason to discount the base rate.  
5. Liquidity/volatility profile: UHS beta ≈1.1; nothing exceptional that would skew symmetry.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline (generic 9-day stock movement) ............. 53 %  
Sector tilt (health-care modestly outperforming YTD) .. +1 %  
Macro & sentiment (neutral) ...........................  0 %  
No scheduled negative catalyst ........................ +1 %  
Rounded, outside-view probability ..................... 55 %

Outside View Prediction:
Probability that UHS will close higher on 2026-02-14 than on 2026-02-02: 55 %.
