Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   • Yahoo Finance / Simply Wall St (29 Jan 26, factual price ≈ $200, opinion “20 % undervalued”).  Quality: medium; facts reliable, valuation opinion model-driven.  
   • MarketBeat pieces (1 Feb 26).  Facts: last close $201.17, 50-d MA $219.56, 200-d MA $203.01, consensus PT $234.13, recent Wells Fargo cut.  Opinions: named analysts; quality high for descriptive data, moderate for forward views.  
   • Fierce Healthcare (30 Oct 25).  Facts: Medicaid supplemental payments drove Q3 revenue; opinion on future cuts.  Older but still sector-relevant; quality medium.  
   • Misc. news wires (Dec 25–Feb 26) on CEO contract, insider sales, institutional flows.  Mostly factual SEC data; quality high.  
   • AskNews macro calendar (jobs 6 Feb, CPI 11 Feb).  Good quality; shows no UHS-specific catalyst inside the window.  
   • No contradictory expert commentary located for the next 10 trading days.

2. Evidence analysis (relative to 10-trading-day “price higher?”)  
   Strong: none.  
   Moderate (+):  
     – Street still values shares ~15 % above spot (consensus PT $234) → slight upward pull.  
   Moderate (–):  
     – Price has broken below both 50-d and 200-d MAs after –11 % January slide; short-term momentum studies suggest mild continuation over the following fortnight.  
   Weak (+): “Undervalued” DCF articles, CEO contract extension optimism.  
   Weak (–): Recent insider selling, small hedge-fund trimming.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Resolution in ~9–10 US trading days (2 weeks).  If horizon were halved (5 days) drift shrinks, momentum dominates → probability of “up” would fall a point or two.  If doubled (4 weeks) macro drift and mean-reversion grow → probability would rise several points.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustments  
   Outside-view base rate (large-cap US share up over next 10 trading days) ≈ 53 %.  
   Adjustments:  
   – Negative one-month momentum and break of key averages (–5  pp).  
   – Lack of any scheduled company catalyst (–1 pp).  
   + Valuation/analyst upside and defensive sector (+1 pp).  
   Net shift −5 pp → 48 %.  Thus, in 48 of 100 similar 2-week windows we’d expect UHS to close higher.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that UHS’s closing price on 14 Feb 2026 exceeds the 2 Feb 2026 close: 48 %.

Checklist:
1. Restated question: “Between 2 Feb and 14 Feb 2026 (~10 trading days), will UHS close higher?”  
2. Base rate 53 % (broad-equity 10-day “up”).  
3. Consistency line: “48 out of 100 times, UHS would finish higher after the two-week span.”  
4. Top factors: a) Recent –11 % drop & sub-MA momentum (–). b) No near-term catalyst (–). c) Analyst targets > spot (+). d) Defensive healthcare drift (+).  
5. Blind-spot: An unexpected takeover rumour or bullish pre-announcement could lift shares sharply → probability would have been too low.  
6. Status-quo bias considered; short horizon volatility keeps result near 50/50.

Probability: 48%
