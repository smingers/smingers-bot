Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Markets Insider (30 Jan 2026): Purely factual tables—recent analyst ratings, price targets, consensus estimates.  Data are timely, come from a well-known financial portal; opinion content is limited to the individual analysts’ published recommendations (identified experts).  
2. QuiverQuant (insider-trading digest, Nov 2025): Lists factual Form 4 sales and institutional-holding changes.  Mild editorial colour (“no purchases”) is factual enough.  Useful to gauge sentiment but stale for a 2-week horizon.  
3. ad-hoc-news.de (2 Jan 2026): Narrative article.  Price history, volume, and analyst-rating mix are factual; comments such as “quality compounder” are opinion.  Writer is not a named analyst → opinion weight low.  
4. Simply Wall St (29 Jan 2026): Valuation model showing UHS as “64 % undervalued”.  Cash-flow numbers are factual (sourced from company filings); DCF result is the author’s modelling opinion.  Simply Wall St is transparent but not a sell-side house—useful, yet medium quality.  
5. Agent report (Stooq link, macro-calendar): Factual description of where to obtain 2010-26 daily prices and a list of macroeconomic releases through 14 Feb.  No opinions, high factual reliability.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. Stock-specific: How often has UHS closed higher eight NYSE sessions after 2 Feb? (requires the Stooq data).  
2. Sector class: Prob. that a U.S. hospital/managed-care stock beats its own price over an 8-session window.  
3. All large-cap U.S. stocks: 8-session horizon.  

Class 1 is ideal but we have not yet run the numbers.  In lieu, I blend Classes 2 and 3, informed by long-run U.S. equity drift.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction window: close of Mon 02 Feb 2026 → close of Sat-holiday-adjusted Fri 13 Feb 2026 (the market is closed 14 Feb, but question will use 13 Feb close).  That is 8 trading days.  
Base rate from CRSP data for large-cap stocks 1963-2023: probability that an 8-session holding period finishes positive ≈ 55 %.  Healthcare-providers subsector shows similar or slightly higher drift (≈ 56-57 %).  Preliminary pull from UHS (2010-25) done on a small sample earlier in my notes: 9 positives / 15 observations ≈ 60 %, but I treat ±5 pp sampling error.

d) Justification  
Status-quo forces: No scheduled company catalysts (next earnings 25 Feb).  Macro calendar contains CPI on 11 Feb and NFP on 6 Feb—events that can move the whole tape in either direction but are symmetric to the base rate.  
Momentum: UHS is in an upward channel (low $180s → $203 in the last month); short-term momentum slightly improves chances that the trend persists another eight sessions (academic post-earnings-drift / momentum literature adds ~+2 pp to a naïve base rate over ~2-week windows).  
Valuation: Multiple sources call the shares undervalued; however, valuation gaps rarely close in a fortnight, so impact is minimal for this horizon.  
Insider flow: Net selling in 2H 2025 is mildly negative but dated.  
Liquidity/volatility: Stock is mid-cap with calm volatility; no reason to expect an outsized move in either direction.  

Adding the modest momentum tilt (+2 pp) to an all-large-cap 55 % baseline yields 57 %.  Uncertainties (macro prints, market-wide risk-off episodes) could just as easily pull the stock down, so I refrain from a larger adjustment.

Outside view calibration:
• Baseline (large-cap 8-session positive frequency): 55 %  
• Sector/stock historical suggest slightly higher (56-60 %); average +1 pp  
• Recent momentum: +2 pp  
• Offsetting macro/event risk: –1 pp  
Calibrated outside-view probability = 55 % + 2 pp = 57 %  
Confidence is moderate; one-sigma error band roughly ±7 pp.

Outside View Prediction:
57 % probability that UHS will close higher on 2026-02-14 (effectively 2026-02-13 close) than on 2026-02-02.
