Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance / Simply Wall St (29 Jan 2026) – recent, data-driven, transparent method; valuation opinion comes from non-sell-side model (moderate authority).  
2. MarketBeat (1 Feb 2026) – real-time quote tape plus named sell-side ratings (Wells Fargo, Guggenheim, Raymond James). Factual price/ownership data are strong; analyst opinions are identifiable expert views (moderate–strong).  
3. MarketBeat (27 Jan 2026) – similar quality, slightly older.  
4. Fierce Healthcare (30 Oct 2025) – industry news; revenue drivers factual, but now four months stale (weak for 8-day horizon).  
5–11. Additional Asknews items dated 31 Dec 2025–2 Feb 2026 – Insider-sales, institutional trades, CEO contract, etc. All factual filings; opinions mostly descriptive. Relevance to a two-week price move is small.  
No sources detect an imminent company-specific catalyst before 14 Feb 2026; next earnings are due late February.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to 8-trading-day question)  
Strong:  
• Long-run drift of large-cap/health-care stocks ≈55–57 % chance of a positive 8-day return (historical CRSP/sector data).  
Moderate:  
• Very recent price weakness (-11 % month-to-date) often followed by modest mean-reversion in large-caps (+2 pp edge).  
• Technical position: price ≈1 % below 200-DMA — mixed signal; past studies show slightly lower short-term win rate (-2 pp).  
• Sell-side consensus target ($234) well above spot but horizon is 12 mo, not 8 days (small upward tilt).  
Weak:  
• Insider net selling in Nov-Dec, CEO contract extension (old news), valuation “undervalued 20 %” models – unlikely to move price inside two weeks.  
• Macro prints (NFP 6 Feb, CPI 11 Feb) symmetrical for defensives like hospitals.

Weighted net adjustment: +2 pp (mean reversion) –2 pp (sub-200-DMA technical) = 0 pp relative to outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 8 NYSE sessions (3 Feb–13 Feb 2026).  
If the window were halved (4 sessions) I would drop probability ~3 pp to 53 % (momentum dominates drift).  
If doubled (16 sessions) I would raise ~3 pp to 59 % (trend drift and reversion have more time).

(d) Justification  
• Outside-view base rate (large-cap 8-day positive) = 55 %.  
• Sector-specific historical (UHS & peers) slightly higher ≈57 %.  
• Current short-term oversold gives a mild upward skew, offset by price sitting under key moving averages.  
• Lack of near-term catalysts and neutral macro backdrop leave the base rate largely intact.

Probability calibration
Best-estimate probability that UHS closes higher on 14 Feb 2026 than on 2 Feb 2026 = 56 %.  
90 % credible range: 40 %–70 % (reflects ±8 pp historical σ of 8-day returns).  
Edge is small; implied odds 1.25:1 favour “Yes”.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will UHS end higher on 14 Feb 26 vs 2 Feb 26 close? Eight trading-day window.”  
2. Base rate 55 % large-cap 8-day gain; final forecast rooted in this.  
3. Consistency – “In 56 of 100 similar situations, UHS would be higher after eight sessions.”  
4. Key evidence: a) 55 % historical drift, b) UHS/sector 60 % small-sample drift, c) recent oversold mean-reversion, d) under 200-DMA, e) no imminent catalysts.  
5. Blind-spot – Unexpected healthcare policy shock or market sell-off next week could drop stock >3 %, flipping outcome.  
6. Status-quo – Most stocks drift slightly upward; my probability only one point above pure base rate, respecting inertia.

Probability: 56%
