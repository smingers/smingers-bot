<Agent_report>
Query: Provide daily UHS closing prices since 2010; calculate how often price 10 trading days after Feb 2 exceeded Feb 2; list any scheduled corporate events or macro events between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-14.
The latest search round finally surfaces a source that can supply, free of charge and in machine-readable form, the historical price file that was missing in all prior attempts:

•  A Stooq direct-download link built as  
   https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=uhs.us&i=d  
   returns a plain-text CSV containing every daily bar that Stooq has for Universal Health Services, Inc. (ticker UHS).  Guidance articles explaining the pattern and the “Download data in .csv” workflow appear in Chartoasis’ how-to page and in a QuantStart tutorial, both of which confirm that U.S. equities are covered and that the data stretch “more than 30 years” back (Chartoasis; QuantStart).

What this means for each element of the user’s request:

1. “Provide daily UHS closing prices since 2010”  
   •  The indispensable dataset is now locatable via the Stooq URL above.  
   •  However, none of the search snippets actually include the file’s contents, and ChatGPT has no direct file-download ability.  Therefore the literal list of ~4,000 closing prices (2010-01-04 through 2026-01-30) is still absent.  
   •  Gap status: still unfilled, but we now know exactly where and how to retrieve the file without cost or login.

2. “Calculate how often the price 10 NYSE trading days after 2 February exceeded the 2 February close”  
   •  Once the Stooq CSV is in hand, the computation is trivial:  
        – Filter rows where Date = YYYY-02-02 (2010-2025).  
        – For each such row, compare Close(t) with Close(t+10 trading sessions).  
        – Count the number of years where Close(t+10) > Close(t) and divide by 16.  
   •  But because the CSV has not actually been downloaded, the comparison cannot yet be executed.  
   •  Gap status: pending the same file acquisition as item 1.

3. “List any scheduled corporate events or macro events between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-14”  
   a. Macro-economic releases (U.S. only, Tier-1 calibre) — unchanged from earlier round:  
      •  02 Feb (10:00 ET)  – ISM Manufacturing PMI; Construction Spending  
      •  03 Feb (10:00 ET)  – JOLTS Job-Openings  
      •  04 Feb (08:15 ET)  – ADP Employment Report  
                     (10:00 ET)  – ISM Services PMI  
      •  05 Feb (08:30 ET)  – Weekly Jobless Claims; Productivity & Costs (prelim); Advance Goods Trade  
      •  06 Feb (08:30 ET)  – January Employment Situation (Non-Farm Payrolls)  
      •  09 Feb (10:00 ET)  – Wholesale Trade  
      •  10 Feb (08:30 ET) – Employment Cost Index; Advance Retail Sales  
      •  11 Feb (08:30 ET) – Consumer Price Index  
      •  12–14 Feb – no Tier-1 U.S. releases; no FOMC meeting scheduled  
      (Consolidated from New York Fed and U.S. Census Bureau calendars reviewed earlier; no new conflicting information surfaced.)

   b. UHS-specific corporate events  
      •  No Universal Health Services investor-relations events, earnings releases, conference appearances, or ex-dividend dates are currently listed for 02 Feb – 14 Feb 2026.  
      •  The only forward marker found remains MarketBeat’s “estimated” Q4-2025 earnings call on 25 Feb 2026, which lies outside the requested window (MarketBeat via previous search).  
      •  Conclusion: “None scheduled” is still the correct statement.

4. Remaining information gaps  
   •  The actual daily-close dataset (2010-present).  
   •  The yes/no result for each Feb-02 + 10-day observation and the overall hit ratio.  

   Both gaps can now be eliminated in a single step: download the file from the Stooq link and run a few lines of spreadsheet or Python code.

Because the roadblock is purely mechanical and no further web research is likely to yield the raw data itself, no additional search queries are recommended at this stage.

1. Analysis section correctly formatted – yes  
2. No “</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
