Analysis:
The close on 2026-02-02 (today) will be our baseline. Over the coming nine trading days the main price-moving catalysts I want to check are:

1. Any scheduled corporate events between now and 2026-02-14: UHS normally reports Q4 results during the last week of February, so a full earnings release is unlikely to drop before the resolution date. Nevertheless, the company sometimes files an 8-K with preliminary numbers or announces a dividend; either could move the stock, so I will look for such notices.
2. Sell-side actions: rating changes or price-target revisions from large brokers can create short-term momentum. I need fresh reports (Feb 2026).
3. Sector-wide drivers: hospital operators are highly sensitive to labor cost trends, reimbursement expectations and flu/COVID volumes. Any February news on CMS policy, wage inflation, union negotiations or utilization data may influence UHS.
4. Macro backdrop: Fed commentary or jobs/CPI prints before Feb 14 could shift defensive-healthcare sentiment.

Therefore the most relevant pieces of information/news will be:
• Any UHS-specific SEC filings, press releases or analyst notes dated Feb 2026.
• Broad healthcare-provider sector news in the same time window.
These will let me judge whether upward or downward pressure is more likely in the next nine sessions.
