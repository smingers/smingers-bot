The stock of Jicheng Electronics surged to a limit within three minutes of the market opening, followed by multiple other stocks such as Baobian Electric, Senyuan Electric, Dalian Dianci, Han Cable, and Electric Science Academy also hitting the daily trading limit. This rally was driven by positive market sentiment linked to reports from CCTV Finance, which revealed that transformer factories in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces are operating at full capacity, with some orders for data center-related transformers already booked through 2027. The UHV sector's strength was notable amid a broader market decline, with the Wind UHV Index rising nearly 4% by the close of trading, and over ten stocks in the sector achieving a 10% or higher gain. The sector's momentum was further supported by multiple policy and infrastructure developments: Inner Mongolia plans to build 12 new UHV transmission projects ('six AC and six DC') during the '14th Five-Year Plan' period, aiming to exceed 1 trillion kilowatt-hours of power exports; the Gansu\u2013Zhejiang \u00b1800 kV UHV DC transmission project, the world\u2019s first UHV flexible DC project with flexible DC technology at both ends, has completed tower assembly for its first section; State Grid Corporation reported that by the end of 2025, it had completed 42 UHV projects with cross-regional transmission capacity of 370 million kilowatts, forming key AC backbone networks in East China, North China, Central China, and Southwest China; and the National Development and Reform Commission and National Energy Administration issued a guidance document in December 2025 emphasizing the orderly development of cross-provincial and cross-regional transmission channels to support clean energy base development. Additionally, analysts from Dongguan Securities and Huaxi Securities highlighted that the global AI data center boom and rising overseas power infrastructure demand are driving a 'super cycle' for power equipment exports, with strong potential for companies excelling in technology, scale, and international market access, particularly in transformer, SST, gas turbine, AI power supply, and liquid cooling supply chain segments.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:36 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qQ0QixufSl)\n\n**United-Guardian Stock: Facts Speak for Themselves**\nThe United-Guardian stock showed a slight decline at the beginning of February, closing at $7.21 on January 31, a 0.41% drop from the previous day. However, over the month of January, the stock posted a strong gain of approximately 16%, marking a recovery after a difficult 2025 in which it lost around 36% over 12 months. Despite this rebound, the current price remains over 60% below its previous annual high and is still about 22% above its 52-week low. The company's valuation metrics present a mixed picture: the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 10.19, a moderate figure in its industry; the price-to-cash-flow ratio (P/C) is 9.56, indicating a generally favorable valuation; however, the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is 2.72, which is relatively high and warrants caution. The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at approximately \u20ac28 million. With no recent positive corporate news driving the stock, the recent rise appears to be primarily technical. The key for the coming weeks will be whether the company regains operational momentum. If not, the stock could quickly come under pressure again, though stable cash flow metrics provide some underlying support. The stock now stands at a crossroads between recovery and further consolidation.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:08 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-United_Guardian_Aktie_Fakten_sprechen_lassen-19425599)\n\n**United Microelectronics (2303) Plunges After Earnings, MCU Sector in Turmoil: Experts Warn of Peak Selling Pressure Before Lunar New Year**\nAfter its January 28, 2026, earnings announcement, United Microelectronics Corporation (2303) saw its stock price hit the daily limit down, triggering a major market downturn in the MCU sector. New Touch (4919) and Sunplus (6202) experienced massive trading volumes and strong bearish candlesticks despite positive catalysts. The article analyzes historical patterns of pre-Lunar New Year selling pressure over the past decade, identifying two key phases: the 'accumulation phase' (35 to 15 trading days before closure) and the 'pressure release phase' (last 30 trading days, divided into six weeks). Data from 2016 to 2025 shows that selling pressure peaks in the second-to-last week before closure, often reversing over half of the prior gains\u2014evident in 2018, 2021, and 2022. The final week typically sees pressure subside, with potential minor rebounds. If a 50% retracement occurs from the 11% rally between December 23, 2025, and January 21, 2026, the market could retreat to the monthly moving average. The article warns that recent price increases in the MCU sector, driven by supply chain cost hikes rather than strong consumer demand, carry risks of failed cost pass-through due to high consumer price sensitivity. Despite January\u2019s record-breaking gains, the market shows a divergence with more declining than rising stocks, signaling potential for intense pre-holiday selling. Experts advise investors to remain calm, lock in profits, and wait for optimal entry points in the final days before closure or after the market opens post-holiday.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:30 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/11099408)\n\n**U-Haul Stock: Earnings Report at the Forefront Amid Sector Volatility**\nInvestors are closely focusing on U-Haul Holding Company's upcoming third-quarter 2026 earnings report as the primary catalyst, given the absence of other company-specific news. The report, scheduled for release after market close on February 4, 2026, will provide the first detailed insight into the company's operational performance for the current fiscal period. The company's voting shares closed at $58.64 on Friday, while non-voting shares ended at $51.31. An investor conference is set for the following Thursday morning to discuss the results. The broader U.S. transportation sector is under scrutiny, with the iShares U.S. Transportation ETF (IYT) declining 0.89% to $76.57. Rising interest rates, particularly the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield at 4.24%, are impacting capital-intensive firms like U-Haul by increasing financing costs for fleets and new projects. Market participants are especially attentive to operational metrics related to U-Haul\u2019s self-storage and real estate investments, which saw significant spending in the prior quarter. Analysts will assess how these strategic initiatives are affecting profitability amid macroeconomic pressures, with the February 4 results and the subsequent conference expected to clarify the impact on future cash flow and financial outlook.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:24 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-U_Haul_Aktie_Zahlen_Fokus-19425079)\n\n**Historic Bitcoin Mispricing: Mathematical Model Projects 105% Returns by 2027**\nBitcoin is currently trading 35.5% below its 15-year power-law trend line, representing the deepest historical discount in its 15-year recorded history, according to a mathematical model by analyst David. At $77,000, Bitcoin is $43,457 below its calculated fair value of $122,425, with a Z-score of -0.63\u2014the most extreme deviation ever recorded. Historical backtesting shows a 100% win rate for similar oversold conditions, with average returns exceeding 100% over 12-month periods. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean reversion model estimates a 133-day half-life for the pricing gap, indicating that half of the deviation will close within approximately four months, with full normalization expected in nine months. Projections indicate Bitcoin could reach $113,000 by June 2026, $145,000 by October 2026, and $162,000 by January 2027, nearing its fair value of $168,000. The model\u2019s predictive correlation of 0.55 means the current deviation explains 55% of the next 18 months\u2019 price movement. The analysis projects a 105% annualized compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through early 2027, driven by the closure of this unprecedented valuation gap. The power-law model has demonstrated 96% accuracy over 15 years and supports allocation sizing at 0.6 times the Half-Kelly criterion for optimal risk-adjusted exposure. The current mispricing is described as the largest statistical opportunity in Bitcoin\u2019s trading history.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:10 PM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/historic-bitcoin-mispricing-mathematical-model-projects-105-returns-by-2027/)\n\n**Summit Global Investments Trims Holdings in Universal Health Services, Inc. $UHS**\nSummit Global Investments reduced its stake in Universal Health Services, Inc.

(NYSE: UHS) experienced a significant surge in analyst sentiment following a November 6, 2025, upgrade from Raymond James Financial, which raised its recommendation from 'hold' to 'outperform' and set a $270.00 price target. This move reflects growing confidence in UHS's earnings potential amid a resilient healthcare sector. The upgrade follows mixed signals from other major firms: Mizuho maintained a $242.00 target, Wells Fargo increased its target to $249.00 and assigned an 'overweight' rating in October, while JPMorgan Chase lowered its target to $195.00 and adopted a 'neutral' stance. Weiss Ratings held a cautious 'hold (c+)' rating, citing risks such as regulatory changes and margin pressures. At the close on November 5, 2025, UHS stock traded at $226.39, within its 52-week range of $152.33 to $228.26, and the new price target positions it near the upper end of that range. UHS\u2019s diversified operations\u2014including acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities, and surgery centers across the U.S., the U.K., and Puerto Rico\u2014support stable cash flow and provide geographic diversification. Analysts believe the company\u2019s strategic initiatives in capacity expansion and operational efficiency will enhance service delivery without eroding margins. The upgrade is expected to influence investor behavior, particularly among value-oriented and institutional investors seeking defensive exposure in healthcare. Market implications suggest potential for continued growth if UHS maintains its earnings trajectory, though risks such as rising labor costs or tighter reimbursement rates could temper enthusiasm. The broader context highlights healthcare\u2019s enduring appeal in volatile markets, with UHS\u2019s strong fundamentals\u2014$14.51 billion market cap, 10.79 trailing P/E ratio, and steady share price\u2014supporting its status as a compelling, resilient investment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 10:21 PM\nSource:[SentimentTrading](https://sentiment-trading.com/articles/universal-health-services-surges-after-analyst-upgrade-to-outperform/)\n\n**UHS Stock Surges to New 52-Week High at $227.27 Amid Strong Q3 2025 Results and Analyst Upgrades**\nThe stock of Universal Health Services (UHS) reached a new 52-week high of $227.27, marking a significant milestone and reflecting a robust performance over the past year, during which the stock rose 11.43%.

Key developments include:  \n\n1. **Rating Changes**:  \n   - Wells Fargo downgraded UHS to \"Equal Weight\" (PT: $235) due to concerns about fading post-COVID benefits and regulatory risks [5][10].  \n   - TD Cowen ($245 PT), Barclays ($262 PT), and UBS ($245 PT) maintained bullish ratings, citing resilient operations [1][2][8].  \n\n2. **Financial Health**:  \n   - Q3 2025 results showed strong EPS ($5.69, beating estimates by $1.03) and revenue ($4.50B, +13.4% YoY) [3][6].  \n   - Dividend stability ($0.20 quarterly) and 86% institutional ownership underscore confidence [1][7].  \n\n3. **Valuation & Risks**:  \n   - P/E ratio (9.74\u201310.03) is near historical highs, while insider selling (e.g., Director Warren Nimetz's 31% stake reduction) signals caution [3][6][10].  \n   - Sector headwinds include margin pressures and legislative uncertainty [10].  \n\n4. **Price Context**:  \n   - The stock fell 5.7% after Wells Fargo's downgrade [7] but stabilized near its 50-day moving average ($226.95) by late January [6].  \n\n**Outlook**: Analysts project ~12% upside to the $234 target [3][4][6], but 2026 performance hinges on Q4 earnings and healthcare policy shifts. The divide between bulls (e.g., Guggenheim PT: $274 [9]) and bears (e.g., Wells Fargo) reflects uncertainty, warranting a \"Hold\" stance until new data emerges.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
