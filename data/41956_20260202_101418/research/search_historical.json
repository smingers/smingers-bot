Guidance articles explaining the pattern and the \u201cDownload data in .csv\u201d workflow appear in Chartoasis\u2019 how-to page and in a QuantStart tutorial, both of which confirm that U.S. equities are covered and that the data stretch \u201cmore than 30 years\u201d back (Chartoasis; QuantStart).\n\nWhat this means for each element of the user\u2019s request:\n\n1. \u201cProvide daily UHS closing prices since 2010\u201d  \n   \u2022  The indispensable dataset is now locatable via the Stooq URL above.  \n   \u2022  However, none of the search snippets actually include the file\u2019s contents, and ChatGPT has no direct file-download ability.  Therefore the literal list of ~4,000 closing prices (2010-01-04 through 2026-01-30) is still absent.  \n   \u2022  Gap status: still unfilled, but we now know exactly where and how to retrieve the file without cost or login.\n\n2. \u201cCalculate how often the price 10 NYSE trading days after 2 February exceeded the 2 February close\u201d  \n   \u2022  Once the Stooq CSV is in hand, the computation is trivial:  \n        \u2013 Filter rows where Date = YYYY-02-02 (2010-2025).  \n        \u2013 For each such row, compare Close(t) with Close(t+10 trading sessions).  \n        \u2013 Count the number of years where Close(t+10) > Close(t) and divide by 16.  \n   \u2022  But because the CSV has not actually been downloaded, the comparison cannot yet be executed.  \n   \u2022  Gap status: pending the same file acquisition as item 1.\n\n3. \u201cList any scheduled corporate events or macro events between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-14\u201d  \n   a.
