Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

1. FRED API (latest obs 1876.280 on 2026-01-29).  
   • Fact only, directly on the target series. Highest-quality, daily frequency, four business-days old.  
   • No opinion, but provides the essential anchor level.

2. ETF flow notes (SPHY, HYG, BBHY articles: Feb 1 & Sep 2025).  
   • Facts: modest inflows/outflows, ETFs track the same ICE BofA HY benchmark.  
   • Opinions: managers emphasise “income” not “price upside”.  
   • Quality moderate; they confirm an absence of distress rather than a forecast.

3. Macro outlook pieces (Ofi Invest, BofA seasonality, JPMorgan, Goldman, Fidelity).  
   • Facts: Fed likely on hold/slow cuts, HY spreads near lows, Treasuries may back-up slightly in Feb.  
   • Opinions: cautious stance, probability of mild spread widening; no call for imminent shock.  
   • Large, reputable institutions → moderate evidence.

4. TradingEconomics & Effective-Yield pages (Jan 2026 value 6.5 %).  
   • High-quality descriptive data; shows carry of ≈6½ % annualised.  
   • Useful for estimating drift.

No other source gives a short-horizon point target.  Overall we have one strong factual anchor (latest level), several moderate macro takes, and no sign of acute credit stress.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong (large effect)  
• Latest index level from FRED (direct measurement).  
• Historical two-week HY-total-return volatility (±1–3 %) – structural, well-documented.

Moderate (medium effect)  
• Current effective yield ≈6.5 % → positive carry of ~0.18 % over 9 trading days.  
• Seasonality note: February often sees a small back-up in Treasury yields (65 % hit-rate).  Could subtract a few bp from price return.  
• Consensus macro view: benign growth, low default risk, spreads at tights → skew remains mildly positive but vulnerable.

Weak (small effect)  
• ETF positioning anecdotes, short-interest in preferreds, Bitcoin rotation stories – tangential.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 11 calendar days (~9 trading days).  If horizon were halved (4-5 days) I would shrink the 80-20 band by ~30 %.  If doubled (3 weeks) I would widen it by roughly 50 % and nudge the median up another 0.1 % for extra carry.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view base: “Driftless random walk with daily σ ≈ 0.35 % plus coupon carry 0.02 %/day.”  
• Median moved up 0.3 % (carry minus small rates headwind) from 1876 → 1882.  
• 80 % interval set at ±1.8 % (historical 2-week σ ≈1.2 % ⇒ 1.28 σ captures ~80 %).  
• Fatter left tail: risk-off events happen more often than Gaussian; 1st percentile given a 5 % drop.  
• Slight right-tail skew preserved because carry and calm conditions favour gentle gains.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈1884 (slightly above median), variance in line with past 2-week moves.  Matches narrative: modest coupon lift, no crisis priced, but plenty of room for an unforeseen shock.

Checklist:
1. Target: Level of BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV index at 2026-02-13 close (units = index points).  
2. Base rate: ±1–3 % 2-week move around last close.  
3. Consistency: median = 1882; mean ≈ 1884; both within the ±3 % historical window.  
4. Key evidence: (a) 1876.28 last reading; (b) 6.5 % yield = positive carry; (c) no current spread blow-out; (d) Feb rates seasonality slightly bearish for prices.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden geopolitical shock causing >5 % spread spike would push index well below 1800.
