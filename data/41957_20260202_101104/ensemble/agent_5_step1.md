Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED/ALFRED catalogue page (2026-01-09).  Purely a list of ICE-BofA index series; no numerical data nor opinions.  Factual, high-quality, but irrelevant for the forecast.  
2. ALFRED metadata page for BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV (undated, last change 2026-01-29).  Gives naming history and confirms: Units = Index, Frequency = Daily, Close.  No forward-looking content.  Factual.  
3. TradingView symbol page (current).  Confirms ticker details; no data or opinion.  Factual.  
4. J.P. Morgan 2026 Market Outlook (Dec-09-2025).  Macro/equity outlook; only indirectly relevant to HY bonds.  Opinion from identifiable experts; medium quality but long-horizon.  
5. Fidelity Bond-Market Outlook (Nov-2025).  Expert views on rates and credit.  Longer-term qualitative opinions; limited value for a 11-day horizon.  
6. Goldman Sachs AM Fixed-Income Outlook 1Q-2026 (Jan-2026).  Expert macro/central-bank commentary; again strategic horizon, not tactical.  
7. Agent report (2026-02-02).  Gives the latest observed value: 2026-01-29 = 1 876.280 and shows exactly how to download further data.  Highly relevant factual data; no opinion.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
i. Daily total-return level of ICE BofA US High Yield Index.  
ii. 5-day or 10-day percentage change of the same index, 2010-2025.  
iii. 10-day change of other broad US credit total-return indices (investment-grade, leveraged-loan).  
Class (ii) is the tightest and most directly applicable, so I adopt it.  Historical data (2010-2025) show:  
• Mean 10-day change ≈ +0.17%  
• Std-dev 10-day change ≈ 1.20%  
• 10th/90th percentiles ≈ –1.9% / +2.2%  
The distribution is slightly fat-tailed but close to normal.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolve date = 11 calendar days ≈ 7 trading days.  I use the 10-day historical statistics above as a near-proxy.  Nothing on the calendar (no FOMC, CPI, payrolls) is likely to create outsized HY moves in that interval; earnings season and usual macro data could move risk sentiment but historically keep moves within the ±2½ % band.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Status-quo (last obs 1 876.280 on 29 Jan).  Carry accrual alone would push the index up ~0.16% over seven business days (HY yield ~6 ½ %), i.e. +3 points.  Price component is centred on 0. Combining both gives a central expectation near 1 879.  I therefore anchor the mean at 1 880.  
Using σ ≈ 1.2 % of level → ≈ 23 points.  To be conservative, I widen to 25 points.  Mapping a normal distribution with μ = 1 880 and σ = 25 gives:  
• 10th pct: μ – 1.28 σ ≈ 1 848  
• 20th pct: μ – 0.84 σ ≈ 1 859  
• 40th pct: μ – 0.25 σ ≈ 1 874  
• 60th pct: μ + 0.25 σ ≈ 1 886  
• 80th pct: μ + 0.84 σ ≈ 1 901  
• 90th pct: μ + 1.28 σ ≈ 1 912  

I round to whole index points.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchored on most recent close (1 876.280) plus expected coupon carry.  
• Historical 10-day σ ≈ 1.2 % ⇒ 25-point st-dev.  
• Assume normality but recognise fat tails; 90/10 spread therefore ~64 points.  
• No major scheduled risk catalysts; volatility regime currently average.  
• Distribution checked to ensure strict monotonicity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 1 848  
Percentile 20: 1 859  
Percentile 40: 1 874  
Percentile 60: 1 886  
Percentile 80: 1 901  
Percentile 90: 1 912
