Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series page for BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV (latest observation 2026-01-29 = 1876.280).  High-quality primary data; no opinion.  
2. TradingEconomics / TradingView pages – confirm ticker details, no forward-looking numbers.  Factual but low incremental value.  
3. AskNews articles 2026-02-01/02 – cover technical seasonality (BofA), ETF flows (SPHY), macro bond outlook (Ofi Invest).  All are opinions from identifiable sell-side or asset-management experts; useful for gauging near-term risk appetite.  
4. Morningstar/BlackRock/Vanguard long-horizon return forecasts (Jan 2026).  Expert but strategic; minimal influence over an 11-day horizon.  
5. Market-Screener piece (Dec 2025) – consensus that 2026 Fed cuts will be modest, spreads may widen modestly.  Single reliable source; provides macro backdrop.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Historical 7-10 trading-day volatility of the index (2010-2025) ≈ 1.2 % – repeatedly confirmed in raw data.  
Moderate:  
• Coupon carry over 7 trading days ≈ +0.16 % (mechanical, hard to avoid).  
• Current credit-spread and rate environment calm; BofA seasonality points to slightly higher Treasury yields in early Feb – could trim HY prices but still within normal sigma.  
Weak:  
• ETF flow anecdotes (SPHY, HYG) – small magnitude, may reflect positioning more than price direction.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time to resolution: 11 calendar / 7 trading days.  Halving the horizon (≈3-4 days) would shrink expected σ by √½ to about 0.85 %; doubling (≈14 trading days) would raise σ to ≈1.6 %.  Central value would drift upward slightly with extra carry.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate: keep level unchanged → 1876.3.  Add expected carry (+3) gives mean 1879.   
Inside view tweaks:  
• Seasonally higher Treasury yields could shave 0-0.1 % off price (-2).  
• ETF inflows and low default backdrop mildly risk-positive (+2).  
These roughly offset, so retain mean 1880.  

St-dev kept at 25 index points (≈1.3 %) – matches long-run 7-day sample and leaves room for unscheduled macro surprises (e.g., geopolitics, data miss).

Probability calibration  
Assume quasi-normal with μ = 1880, σ ≈ 25.  Tails widened a little (1 % and 99 %) to recognise fat tails.

Checklist:
1. Target: Level of ICE BofA US HY Total Return Index (units: Index) at close 2026-02-13.  
2. Base rate: mean 10-day drift +0.17 %, σ 1.2 %.  
3. Implied median ≈ 1880; mean ≈ 1881; consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) latest close 1876.3, b) historical 7-day σ 1.2 %, c) positive coupon carry, d) calm spreads/flows, e) no major macro events scheduled.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden risk-off shock (e.g., large default or geopolitical flare-up) would push value sharply lower.
