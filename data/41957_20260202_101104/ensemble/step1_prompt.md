# Summary of J.P. Morgan 2026 Market Outlook

**Date:** December 09, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Global Economic Outlook
- J.P. Morgan expects the global economy to remain resilient in 2026
- There is a 35% probability of a U.S. and global recession in 2026
- Global GDP growth is expected to receive a boost in the first half of 2026 due to front-loaded fiscal stimulus

### Central Bank Policy
- 70% of central banks were cutting rates in 2025, but are expected to transition to a simultaneous hold at relatively high levels (above pre-COVID levels) in 2026
- Central banks expected to be relatively inactive in 2026

### Equity Market Forecasts
- **Global equities:** Positive outlook with double-digit gains forecast across both developed markets (DM) and emerging markets (EM)
- **S&P 500:** AI supercycle expected to drive above-trend earnings growth of 13-15% for at least the next two years
- **Eurozone:** Earnings expected to grow by 13%+ in 2026
- **EM equities:** Positioned for robust performance in 2026

### Growth Forecasts
- Growth forecasts are being upgraded across the curve going into the new year

## Named Source Opinions:

**Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan:**
- Expects solid growth with a recoupling of labor markets (which have been weak) to overall economic performance in the first half of 2026
- Expects pickup in job growth and more normal/balanced growth pattern
- Believes inflation will stay elevated due to solid growth and stronger labor demand
- States that central banks won't deliver on market expectations for interest rate declines
- Notes that business caution is the primary drag on hiring, reflecting trade war concerns and sluggish non-tech demand

**Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan:**
- Describes a "multidimensional polarization" at the heart of their outlook: equity markets split between AI and non-AI sectors, U.S. economy balancing robust capex with soft labor demand, and widening divide in household spending
- Notes that AI-driven supercycle is fueling record capex and rapid earnings expansion
- States AI could amplify polarization within an already unhealthy K-shaped economy
- Expects style positioning in 2026 to resemble 2025, with new extremes in crowding, record concentration, and "winner-takes-all" dynamic

**Fabio Bassi, Head of Cross-Asset Strategy at J.P. Morgan:**
- States "the market environment remains fragile, and investors must navigate a landscape where risk and resilience coexist"

**Meera Chandan, Head of Global FX (title inferred):**
- Describes the 2026 environment as resembling "the middle of the dollar smile and a low-volatility environment" with inactive central banks and strong growth

## Key Themes:
- AI investment continuing to drive market dynamics and support growth
- Tailwinds from 2025 (healthy balance sheets for corporates and households, ample liquidity, broadening of AI capex spending) expected to persist in 2026
- Downside risks remain elevated due to weak business sentiment and ongoing labor market slowdown
- Pro-cyclical dynamic with fiscal and monetary policy easing providing tailwinds
- Market concentration could reach new highs

**Note:** While this article provides extensive qualitative outlook on equities and economic growth, it does not specifically mention high-yield corporate bonds or the ICE BofA US High Yield Index that is the subject of the forecasting question.

# Summary of "Bond market outlook 2026 | Fidelity"

## Key Facts and Statistics:
- As of late November 2025, the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index returned approximately 7% for the year
- The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year and a half
- US Treasury rates are now approximately at "fair value" according to Fidelity research

## Named Source Opinions:

**Robin Foley (Head of Fixed Income at Fidelity):**
- "Fixed income remains a valuable choice in a diversified portfolio, especially if investors seek liquidity and risk-adjusted returns"

**Dirk Hofschire (Managing Director of Research, Fidelity's Asset Allocation Research Team):**
- US Treasury rates are approximately at "fair value" and could present an attractive entry point

**Jake Weinstein (Senior Vice President, Fidelity's AART):**
- Key factors driving intermediate- and long-term bond rates are expectations for future economic growth and inflation
- "If the US sees a growth boom or if inflation remains sticky, longer-term interest rates could go higher"

**David De Biase (Co-manager, Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund):**
- A well-constructed actively managed portfolio of bonds with intermediate maturities may offer benefits of bonds plus potential for capital appreciation and inflation-beating returns

**Michael Plage (Co-manager, Fidelity Investment Grade Bond Fund and Total Bond Fund):**
- "The all-important starting yields are still relatively high and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue reducing interest rates, just as investors may be starting to see some vulnerability in the credit markets. That's the combination I've been waiting for."

**Beau Coash (Institutional Portfolio Manager):**
- "I still believe bonds can help provide portfolio stability and may help mitigate risks during extreme stock market downturns"
- "I expect the inverse-correlation benefit of owning bonds to hold up in most scenarios, with the exception of extreme pickups in inflation, or if rates were to rise to compensate for the higher issuance of government debt in order to finance budget deficits"

## Key Themes for 2026:
- High-quality bonds expected to continue serving portfolio roles: diversification, regular income, tax efficiency, and capital preservation
- Bond market returning to more normal dynamics with term premium (long-term yields higher than short-term yields)
- Market generally expects further Fed rate cuts may be on the table
- Uncertainty around US federal government's growing debt burden and its potential impact on bond markets
- Question of Fed independence and potential pressure to cut rates to help government afford debts

# Summary of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Fixed Income Outlook 1Q 2026

## Key Economic Outlook

**United States:**
- Household spending remains robust, driven by higher-income consumers sensitive to stock market wealth effects
- Labor market is in a "low-hire low-fire equilibrium" that is fragile with meaningful downside risks
- Tariff passthrough has been slower and weaker than expected; further passthrough expected in 2026 but upward pressure on goods prices inflation should fade as year progresses
- Inflation expectations are well anchored, wage growth has converged to target consistent levels

**Europe:**
- Upside and downside risks to growth are finely balanced
- Short-term tensions over US trade and Chinese competition, plus domestic political uncertainty could weigh on activity
- Increased fiscal spending, tourism, and AI spending could provide catalyst for higher growth
- Headline inflation expected to remain below 2% target for next two years

**UK:**
- Downside risks to growth given subdued sentiment and ongoing labor market weakness
- Recent GDP figures came in well under Bank of England projections
- Inflation will take a big step down in 2026 due to cost-of-living measures, easing wage pressures

**China:**
- Exports expected to continue growing solidly in 2026 as important growth engine against soft domestic demand

**Japan:**
- Underlying inflation pressures remain strong
- Tight labor market and weak yen could continue supporting price increases

## Central Bank Policy Views

**Federal Reserve:**
- Currently on pause, waiting for change in balance of risks between inflation and employment
- FOMC's dovish core shows sensitivity to labor market weakness, suggesting low bar to further cuts
- New Fed Governor arriving in May likely to adopt dovish stance, increasing case for further easing in 2026
- Timing of potential cuts remains unclear

**European Central Bank:**
- Firmly on hold with high bar for both easing and tightening
- Recent projection upgrades suggest risk of inflation surprising to downside
- Growth would need to significantly weaken for cuts to come into play

**Bank of England:**
- Expected to continue cutting rates to neutral given lower inflation
- Downside surprises to growth could see rates cut further

**Bank of Japan:**
- On course to hike twice in 2026
- Timing depends on wage negotiations and yen direction

**Other Central Banks:**
- Sweden: Riksbank likely on hold for 2026; may start hiking cycle in Q1 2027
- Switzerland: SNB likely to keep rates at zero this year
- Norway: Norges Bank on course for two cuts in 2026
- Canada: May keep rates steady waiting for recovery evidence
- Australia/New Zealand: Rates likely steady for 2026, but above-target inflation and cyclical recovery could make them among first DM central banks to pivot back to rate hikes

## Investment Opportunities

**Fixed Income:**
- Curve dynamics across major DM bond markets identified as major source of opportunity
- Neutral on US Treasuries and European bonds, but hold steepening bias across both
- US steepeners could benefit in either risk-off (labor market weakness) or risk-on (fiscal expansion) scenarios
- Europe steepeners could benefit from selling by Dutch pension funds transitioning schemes
- Japan: Positioned underweight and in curve flatteners as rate hikes could push up short end
- UK: Overweight duration with focus on short end given weak labor market and falling inflation
- Australia/New Zealand: Positioned overweight, believing market overestimates probability of pivot to rate hikes

**Currency:**
- Balanced view on US dollar given pressures in both directions
- Fed Chair Powell's December comments suggested low tolerance for labor market weakness, implying dollar could fall further than markets expect if unemployment/payroll data disappoints
- Stronger-than-expected labor readings could support dollar, as could continued AI-related capex
- Cautious on British pound given ongoing fiscal concerns
- Similar caution on Japanese yen given Takaichi premiership's potential to increase government spending
- Select overweight positions in emerging markets: South Korean won, Mexican peso, Czech koruna

Query: Download FRED series BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV Jan 2025-Feb 2026 with daily frequency
The user already knows the exact FRED series ID – BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV (“ICE BofA US High Yield Index Total Return Index Value”).  
Everything needed to download that series for a specific date span is contained in two FRED resources returned by the search:

•  The public series page, which confirms  
  –  Units: Index, not-seasonally-adjusted  
  –  Native frequency: Daily, Close  
  –  Latest observation shown (e.g., 2026-01-29 = 1 876.280) so the requested window (Jan-2025 → Feb-2026) is definitely in the database [fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV].  

•  The API documentation for endpoint /fred/series/observations, which lists every request parameter, including  
  –  observation_start and observation_end (YYYY-MM-DD)  
  –  file_type (xml [default], json, csv, xlsx)  
  –  frequency (optional aggregation; omit it when you want the series’ native frequency) [fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html].

Putting those two sources together gives a completely workable download recipe:

1. Get (free) FRED API key: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html  
2. Construct URL (one line; shown wrapped for readability):  
   https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations  
     ?series_id=BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV  
     &observation_start=2025-01-01  
     &observation_end  =2026-02-28  
     &file_type=csv            # or json/xlsx/xml  
     &api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

3. Paste the URL in a browser or use curl, wget, R (fredr::fredr()), Python (pandas-read_csv or requests), etc.  
   Example with curl that writes a local CSV:  
   curl -L -o BAMLHY_TRIV_2025_2026.csv "https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV&observation_start=2025-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-28&file_type=csv&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"

Important implementation notes drawn from the same sources:

•  You do NOT need to pass frequency=d. The API will return the native daily observations automatically; the frequency parameter is only for down-aggregating (daily→weekly, monthly, etc.). [API doc]

•  The CSV download is delivered as a small ZIP file (file_type=csv). Most languages unpack it automatically; otherwise unzip first. [API doc]

•  Weekend/holiday behaviour: ICE series can show weekend dates at month-end when accrued-interest adjustments occur (see series notes on the FRED page). Don’t assume every calendar day will appear.

•  Licensing: Data are © ICE Data Indices, LLC and supplied under licence to FRED. Redistribution or commercial use outside “internal use” is prohibited without ICE written consent (full notice on the series page). Cite ICE Data Indices, LLC and FRED if you store the values internally.

Remaining information gaps:

1.  API key – the user must register; it cannot be provided here.  
2.  Exact observations for Feb-2026 after the current day will not exist until ICE publishes them. Querying a future end-date (e.g., 2026-02-28) just returns data up to the most recent business day, so no additional parameter is required.  
3.  If programmatic access is to be scripted in R/Python, user might need language-specific snippets (not in scope of the API itself).

Because the core question (“how do I download … Jan-2025 – Feb-2026 daily?”) is fully answered with the API call above and the only missing item is the personal API key, no further web searches are necessary.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
