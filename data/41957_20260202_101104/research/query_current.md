Analysis:
The index stood at 1 876.28 on 29 Jan 2026 after rising almost 2 % in January, mainly on the back of tightening spreads (ICE/BofA option-adjusted spread moved from ~360 bp in late-Dec to ~335 bp last week) and modest Treasury rally.  The main drivers over the next two weeks are likely:
• 2 Feb and 9 Feb economic data (payrolls, CPI revisions, University of Michigan sentiment) that could shift Fed-cut expectations and Treasury yields.  
• Primary high-yield issuance calendar, which has been heavy YTD; continued demand keeps prices firm.  
• Default headlines (still running below 3 %) and earnings from heavy HY sectors (energy, telecom).  

Any dramatic move (>±1 %) in the total-return index before 13 Feb would probably come through a >15 bp jump/drop in underlying yields or a broad risk-off equity move.  Current volatility and positioning suggest a 1-sigma daily swing in the index of roughly ±0.15 %; combining 8 trading days leaves an expected ±0.4 – 0.5 % band, i.e. about 1 868–1 885.  News articles on Fed guidance, HY fund flows, and weekly spread moves are the most relevant near-term inputs for an inside view.
