Analysis:
The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Total Return series is a slow-moving, price-and-income index whose day-to-day changes are normally small (median absolute daily move ≈ 0.15 % over the past five years).  The level is presently 1 876.28 (last published 2026-01-29).  To form a prior for 2026-02-13 we need:

1. The most recent observations after 2026-01-29 to see whether the index is drifting higher or lower.
2. Typical daily volatility in February (no major U.S. holidays between 2 Feb and 13 Feb, so about ten trading observations).
3. Context from current credit-spread news (are spreads widening on recession fears or tightening on risk rallies?).

The raw FRED time series and current market commentary will supply those pieces.  With them we can fit a random-walk-with-drift or an AR(1) model and derive a predictive distribution; the one-day SD is roughly 0.003 × level ≈ 5.6 index points, giving a 10-day SD ≈ √10 × 5.6 ≈ 18.  That places most probability in the 1 840–1 910 range but fat tails out to roughly 1 800–1 950.
