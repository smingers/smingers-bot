The article covers the \"ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Index Effective Yield\" (which measures yields on CCC-rated and lower bonds), while the forecasting question asks about the \"ICE BofA US High Yield Index Total Return Index Value\" (BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV, which is a total return index for the broader high-yield market).

The content is fragmented and focuses on credit spreads and effective yield rather than the total return index value requested in the forecasting question.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n### Credit Spread Movements (January-March 2025)\n- **Unusual strength in credit spread movements**: Since the week of January 20th, credit spreads have shown particularly strong movement. The commentary notes this strength is \"really unusual\" and comparable in magnitude only to the period from June 2007-July [date unclear] and potentially exceeding the COVID-era spread widening.\n\n- **March 4th observation**: The RSI (Relative Strength Index) on credit spreads made a higher high with February's monthly closing, indicating a change from downtrend to uptrend in credit spreads, which is described as \"not good for risk assets.\"\n\n- **March closing update**: Another spike in RSI was noted after March closed, with the author stating \"Caution is now warranted.\"\n\n### Technical Analysis Guidelines (from unnamed sources)\n- Credit spreads under 4 are said to indicate a \"low risk on type market\"\n- Credit spreads above 9+ suggest the market is oversold\n- Credit spreads at 10+ are noted as significant thresholds\n\n### Investment Perspective\n- Despite OAS (Option-Adjusted Spreads) resting at long-term median levels, there may be \"considerable investment value\" in all-in-yields of short to intermediate maturity investment grade notes and ETFs\n\n**Note**: This article discusses the ICE BofA US High Yield Index **Effective Yield** (BAMLH0A0HYM2EY), not the **Total Return Index Value** (BAMLHYH0A0HYM2TRIV) that is the subject of the forecasting question.

Nearly 40% of actively managed equity funds have achieved positive year-to-date returns, a figure nearly ten times higher than the 4% recorded on February 5. Gold and artificial intelligence (AI) themes have emerged as key drivers of fund performance. Notably, multiple funds have lifted or relaxed purchase restrictions, signaling market optimism. Among the top-performing funds are the Jianxin Flexible Allocation C (up 38.02% year-to-date), which launched on February 7, and the CSI Fortune Cyclical Preferred A/C (up 26.82% and 26.72%, respectively), which focus on gold and AI-related sectors. Other funds such as Xijin Liide Strategy Preferred A/C and Wan Jia Dual Engine A/C also posted returns exceeding 20%. In contrast, 1,363 actively managed equity funds have lost more than 10%, with the Jin Yuan Shun'an Industry Zhenxuan A/C down over 30%, creating a performance gap exceeding 60 percentage points. Market analysts attribute the rally to cyclical trends, with gold and AI leading. Experts like Zhang Ye of Dongfang Marathon Investment and Liu Tingyu of Yongying Gold Stock ETF note that gold\u2019s appeal stems from de-dollarization, geopolitical risks, and central bank gold accumulation. Meanwhile, Yao Xi of Guangfa Shanghai Gold ETF warns of short-term speculative risks despite long-term gold investment value.

The fund invests in 'Man Funds plc \u2013 Man Dynamic Income,' a global bond strategy with top-tier performance * among peers. The fund employs a flexible, unconstrained approach, investing globally across various bond types\u2014including government, investment-grade, high-yield, emerging market bonds, and securitized products\u2014without regional or sector restrictions. It aims to generate relatively high returns through dynamic asset allocation. The fund's investment strategy focuses on identifying undervalued small- and mid-cap bonds through fundamental analysis, using Man Group plc\u2019s proprietary assessment of intrinsic value. Man Group applies a 'margin of safety' principle, investing only when market prices are below intrinsic value, thereby managing credit and market risks. As of November 2025, the underlying fund achieved approximately 73% cumulative return over 3.5 years (from June 2022), significantly outperforming the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index. Performance was driven by both capital gains (equity-like upside) and income gains (interest). The fund\u2019s risk profile includes higher volatility and credit risk due to exposure to high-yield and smaller issuers, and it may use derivatives for portfolio management, which introduces additional risk. The fund\u2019s total annual fees amount to 1.24% (including management and other costs), and investors should note that principal loss is possible due to price fluctuations, currency risk, and market volatility. The fund is designed for long-term investors seeking diversified income and growth from global fixed income markets. Investors are advised to review the fund\u2019s offering circular and fully understand risks, fees, and suitability before investing.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u914d\u4fe1\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2No.1\uff5cPR TIMES](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000005.000172799.html)\n\n**BofA flags February tailwinds for yields, curve flattening, small caps, oil**\nAccording to Paul Ciana, a technical analyst at Bank of America Securities, seasonality patterns in February are tilting toward a hawkish bias for U.S. interest rates, with historical data showing that U.S. 5-year Treasury yields rise in February approximately 65% of the time. Early-month upward movements are also common in 2-year and 5-year yields, while the 2s10s yield curve tends to flatten more frequently in the latter part of the month. Small-cap equities, particularly the Russell 2000, historically gain strength during the early and middle thirds of February, while Brent crude oil typically shows gains, especially in the final third of the month. In contrast, the S&P 500 exhibits muted seasonality in February, with average and median monthly returns often ending near flat, indicating that precise intra-month timing is more critical than expecting strong overall monthly trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 03:18 PM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4545098-bofa-flags-february-tailwinds-for-yields-curve-flattening-small-caps-oil)\n\n**Ofi Invest AM: On the Bond Market, It's Better to Stay Cautious**\nIn 2025, global bond markets delivered strong returns, with the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index rising above 8%, driven primarily by macroeconomic data such as growth, inflation, unemployment, and monetary policy. U.S. bonds outperformed European bonds, partly due to the euro's 12% depreciation against the dollar. Despite this rally, Ofi Invest AM advises caution for 2026, noting that major central banks have signaled their monetary policy intentions: the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain interest rates near 2% for the next 12 months, the U.S. Federal Reserve is projected to make no more than two additional rate cuts\u2014bringing rates to a neutral range of 3%-3.5%\u2014and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may implement temporary rate hikes. Ofi Invest AM maintains a neutral stance on 10-year bonds, expecting yields to remain within a range of 2.60% to 3.10% for German Bunds, with adjustments to duration based on market conditions. The firm highlights ongoing risks from fiscal and geopolitical factors, especially given heightened tensions following a second Trump presidency, which were downplayed in 2025 but could grow in 2026. Additional risks include Germany\u2019s high bond issuance, the Netherlands\u2019 new pension reform, and potential upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. Despite an overall reduction in market risks\u2014due to central bank vigilance, the end of peak tariffs, and strong corporate refinancing\u2014Ofi Invest AM remains cautious, advocating for selectivity in credit exposure, a positive outlook on high-yield bonds in the medium term, but caution on potential spread widening in adverse scenarios.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:08 PM\nSource:[Borsa italiana](https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/notizie/radiocor/finanza/dettaglio/ofi-invest-am-sul-mercato-obbligazionario-e--meglio-rimanere-prudenti-parola-al-mercato-nRC_01022026_1429_315493149.html)\n\n**Top Fund Returns Hit 54.76% in January 2026 as Resource Sector Leads Market Rally**\nIn January 2026, China's public mutual funds delivered strong performance, with the top fund achieving a return of 54.76%, driven primarily by the 'gold and jewelry' sector. According to Wind data, by January 31, 2026, actively managed equity funds showed significant gains, with the top three funds\u2014Xibei Lide Strategy Preferred, Xibei Lide New Momentum, and Qianhai Open Gold Jewelry Mixed\u2014achieving returns of 54.76%, 53.93%, and 49.30%, respectively. Nine of the top ten performing funds were heavily invested in resource-related sectors, reflecting a rapid shift in fund manager preferences from technology to cyclical resources. Only one fund, Guangfa Far-Sighted Vision Mixed, managed by Tang Xiaobin, focused on semiconductor memory, a technology theme. The top fund, Xibei Lide Strategy Preferred, previously used a balanced strategy but shifted to a concentrated resource-focused approach in January 2026, with a single-day net asset value increase of 8.12% on January 28\u2014matching the daily rise of the CSI Shanghai-Hong Kong Gold Industry Index\u2014indicating a major portfolio reallocation toward resource stocks. Meanwhile, public funds of funds (FOFs) also benefited from this trend, with Guotai Preferred Navigation FOF achieving a 37.12% return, the highest among FOFs. This fund held six resource-themed funds in its top ten holdings, accounting for over 56% of its total portfolio, and directly invested in eight stocks, six of which were resource-related (gold, silver, tin). The dual strategy of investing in both funds and stocks amplified its returns. Fund managers cited structural market shifts, including low inventory levels, loose liquidity, and strong demand in gold and small metals, as key drivers. Pioneers like Chen Ziyang of Changcheng Cycle Preferred and Tang Xiaobin of Guangfa Far-Sighted Vision emphasized the rising opportunity in gold, silver, and semiconductor memory. Guotai Preferred Navigation FOF\u2019s Zeng Hui expressed optimism for 2026, forecasting a shift from valuation expansion to earnings growth, with continued focus on gold, silver, and rare earth metals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:03 AM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](https://stcn.com/article/detail/3624363.html)\n\n**AE Wealth Management LLC Reduces Stock Holdings in SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF $SPHY - Stock Observer**\nAE Wealth Management LLC reduced its stock holdings in the SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHY), according to a report from Stock Observer.

ZYUS tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index, focusing on high-yielding, lower-volatility US large-cap stocks like Pfizer and UPS, delivering a mid-single-digit trailing yield and a six-month total return of just over 1% as of December 2025. IAA provides exposure to 50 of Asia\u2019s largest companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Alibaba, Samsung, and Tencent, with a current dividend yield around 2% and a six-month total return exceeding 23% as of January 2026. The ETFs collectively offer diversified exposure across Australia, the US, and Asia, balancing income generation with growth potential. While the Motley Fool Australia recommends VHY, its investing expert Scott Phillips did not include it among his top five recommended stocks as of January 2026.

This reflects extreme bullishness, driven by strong global stock index breadth, long-only bull positioning, and favorable credit market technicals, despite $15.4 billion in equity fund withdrawals during the week. The MSCI World Index reached an all-time high on January 27 and is on track for its best month since September. Meanwhile, investors flowed $17 billion into bond funds, $10 billion into money markets, and $6.7 billion into gold\u2014the highest weekly inflow since October. Energy funds saw their largest inflow since October 2023 ($2.3 billion), and Materials funds recorded a record $11.8 billion inflow. In contrast, China equity funds recorded a record $60.5 billion in withdrawals for a second consecutive week, attributed to likely 'national team' selling. U.S. stock funds saw $9.2 billion in outflows, Europe recorded its first outflows in seven weeks ($400 million), while flows to U.S. funds resumed. BofA\u2019s preferred 2026 positioning includes long exposure to bonds, foreign equities, and gold as hedges against disinflation and dollar depreciation, with mid-cap companies seen as beneficiaries of domestic growth. The firm remains pessimistic on investment-grade tech credit and the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar has boosted non-U.S. markets\u2014Europe (+6.2%), Canada (+7.7%), Latin America (+8.2%), and Japan (+3.2%). In the U.S., value stocks outperformed growth in Q4 2025, gaining 3.8% vs. 1.1%. Fidelity\u2019s Q1 2026 outlook confirms strong global stock performance driven by solid fundamentals, rate cuts, fiscal stimulus, and AI-driven capital spending, though long-term risks from geopolitical, economic, and governmental challenges remain. Diversification into fixed income and inflation-resistant assets is advised.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:10 PM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bofas-hartnett-overbought-global-stocks/)\n\n**US bonds shined in 2025 but returns could lose altitude next year**\nU.S. bond investors enjoyed a strong 2025, with total returns for the Morningstar US Core Bond TR YSD index reaching approximately 7.3%, the highest since 2020, driven by a 75 basis point reduction in Federal Reserve policy rates and a resilient U.S. economy that kept corporate credit spreads near historic lows. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index reported nearly 8% total returns for investment-grade debt, while high-yield bonds returned about 8.2%. However, market analysts anticipate a more challenging 2026, as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by only around 60 basis points, less aggressively than in 2025. Additionally, fiscal stimulus from President Donald Trump\u2019s anticipated tax and spending policies may boost economic growth, limiting the decline in long-term Treasury yields. JPMorgan forecasts 10-year Treasury yields to end 2026 at 4.35%, while BofA Securities predicts 4.25%, with some analysts like Anders Persson of Nuveen cautioning that longer-dated bonds may underperform due to rising global government debt, leading him to remain 'underweight duration.' Investment-grade credit spreads, currently at 80 basis points, may widen to 110 basis points in 2026 according to JPMorgan, potentially reducing total returns to 3%, though BNP Paribas expects spreads to remain stable. Emily Roland of Manulife John Hancock Investments remains optimistic, arguing the bond market is underpricing disinflation and weaker growth, expecting a stronger rally in 2026 despite current market pricing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/us-bonds-shined-in-2025-but-returns-could-lose-altitude-next-year-ce7e59dbd08fff2c)\n\n**RBB Fund, Inc. - US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF (NYSEARCA:XBIL) Hits New 12-Month High - Here's What Happened**\nThe RBB Fund, Inc. - US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF (NYSEARCA:XBIL) reached a new 52-week high on Friday, trading as high as $50.21 and closing at $50.21, with 88,455 shares traded.

Despite strong fundamentals and spreads near multi-decade lows, Columbia Threadneedle Investments maintains a neutral risk-taking posture due to fewer attractive investment opportunities compared to earlier in the year. The firm expects most companies to raise prices to offset higher input costs, which could lead to either higher consumer prices or margin compression if price increases fail to stick. Moderate default increases are anticipated unless macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly.

According to Seeking Alpha data, HYG\u2019s total return for 2024 is 7.3%, compared with 2.38% for the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD).  Over the past three years, HYG\u2019s cumulative return is 30% versus 27% for SCHD, indicating that HYG has \"outperformed SCHD in long\u2011term gains\".  The fund attracted more than $3.5\u202fbillion in inflows, pushing total assets over $18\u202fbillion.  This inflow is attributed to a low U.S. corporate default rate of 1.47% \u2013 down from the pandemic peak of 1.67% and the 7.50% peak during the global financial crisis \u2013 and narrowing credit spreads.  The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option\u2011Adjusted Spread fell to 2.79% from a year\u2011to\u2011date high of 4.61%, reflecting reduced perceived risk after the U.S. trade war eased.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 25\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut and its projected two additional cuts this year are seen as a catalyst for HYG, with analysts noting that the Fed\u2019s focus on employment rather than inflation may help avoid a recession.  Technical indicators show HYG trading above its 50\u2011 and 100\u2011day exponential moving averages, with the directional index rising to 34, suggesting further upside potential toward the $100 level.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 03:18 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/nl/nieuws/2025/09/19/hyg-etf-draait-schd-om-is-het-een-goed-inkomensfonds-om-te-kopen/)\n\n**Bitcoin vs. bond yields - Why THIS rotation signal matters now**\nThe article reports that falling high\u2011yield bond yields and a Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of 2.2 are signalling easing credit stress and a bullish environment for Bitcoin (BTC). CoinGlass data show liquidation clusters between $114,000 and $118,000, with an open interest of $83.62\u202fbillion that could support a short squeeze to $118,000. BTC has recently reclaimed $116,000 on September\u202f15 and is positioned to close the gap to its all\u2011time high above $124,000. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) ratio stands at 0.523, indicating modest profits and reduced near\u2011term sell pressure. Funding rates are 0.0091\u202f%, and the ICE BofA US High Yield Index is signalling bullish conditions for BTC. The article cites Alphractal\u2019s historical pattern of nine successful rotations and notes that the current decline in yields mirrors past cycles, suggesting capital may rotate into BTC. Overall, the data suggest a potential short\u2011term rally toward $118,000 if sentiment remains bullish.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[AMBCrypto](https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-vs-bond-yields-why-this-rotation-signal-matters-now/)\n\n**COLUMN-Income investing benefits from spreading the wealth around: Fridson | Business**\nIncome investing requires diversification across asset classes. Fridson reports that from 2006\u20112024 dividend\u2011growth stocks were the most stable, with only five years of negative price changes, while closed\u2011end funds were the least stable, recording negative price changes in the majority of those years. However, dividend\u2011growth stocks delivered the lowest yield (2.48%) compared with the highest yield from closed\u2011end funds. An equally weighted portfolio of the seven income asset classes achieved a 5.63% yield\u2014more than twice the dividend\u2011growth yield and close to the median 5.95%\u2014while recording only six down\u2011years, below the median of eight. In 2024 the MSCI US REIT Index rose 4.26% in August but fell 4.08% over the past 12 months; the MLP index fell 1.83% in August but gained 6.96% over 12 months. The ICE BofA US High\u2011Yield Index gained 1.41% as the Moody\u2019s U.S. default\u2011rate forecast fell from 4.1% to 2.7%, whereas the ICE BofA US Corporate Index lost 1.73% as the 10\u2011year Treasury rate rose from 3.89% to 4.58%. In 2022, when the 10\u2011year Treasury yield spiked from 1.50% to 3.83% and the Moody\u2019s default\u2011rate forecast jumped from 2.6% to 5.9%, all income categories posted negative returns except the Alerian MLP Index, which gained 21.63% on a 10.5% rise in Brent crude.

Institutional investors continue showing confidence, as evidenced by Truist Financial's SPHY ETF purchases and a 0.1% gain on February 1 [7]. \n\nThe asset class offers attractive yields (6.78%) but limited capital appreciation potential due to near-par bond prices and narrow spreads [11]. Major firms like Franklin Templeton and AB emphasize high yield's income-generation role in portfolios rather than significant price gains [11][20]. \n\nKey February risks include potential Treasury yield increases (historically rising 65% of Februaries) [2], idiosyncratic credit risks in over-leveraged sectors [5], and geopolitical tensions [8][9]. Most forecasts recommend active management focusing on BB/B-rated financials, energy, and healthcare sectors [11][13].\n\nNotably, no single forecast specifically projects February 2026 returns, but market conditions suggest moderate gains contingent on Federal Reserve actions and corporate earnings. The ICE BofA benchmark methodology will change in April 2026 to the \"Constrained\" version [19], but this doesn't affect current assessments.\n\nSources: [2][3][5][7][8][9][11][13][15][19][20]\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
