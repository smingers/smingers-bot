  - Cannot provide precise 2-week pre/post statistics without additional data
  - Notes "elevated realised volatility relative to implied"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **SMCI's own 10-day post-earnings performance (past 10 quarters)**
   - Suitability: High - most directly relevant
   - Challenge: Agent report notes 4 of last 5 earnings had double-digit drops, but lacks complete 2-week data
   - Pattern suggests downside bias post-earnings

2. **High-beta tech stocks during earnings volatility periods**
   - Suitability: Medium - SMCI's beta of 1.53 suggests amplified market moves
   - Less specific to SMCI's unique situation

3. **AI infrastructure stocks in current market environment (early 2026)**
   - Suitability: Medium - captures sector dynamics
   - Morgan Stanley downgrade of IT hardware sector suggests headwinds

**Selected reference class:** SMCI's own post-earnings behavior, supplemented by general short-term stock price randomness for 10-day periods.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 12 calendar days (Feb 2 to Feb 14, 2026)
- 1 trading day before earnings (Feb 2-3)
- Earnings announcement after-market Feb 3
- 7-8 trading days post-earnings (Feb 4-14)

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Agent report documents tendency for "sharp downside gaps" post-earnings
- Recent documented moves: -16% (Aug 2025), -9% (Nov 2025)
- Stock has been in downtrend: $30.96 (Jan 1) → $28.54 (Feb 2) = -7.8% in one month
- Closing price Feb 2 appears to be ~$28.54 (from Robinhood source dated Feb 2)

**Key consideration:** The question asks whether Feb 14 close will be HIGHER than Feb 2 close. Given:
- Earnings on Feb 3 with historical downside bias
- Current price ~$28.54
- Stock needs to recover from any post-earnings drop AND gain additional ground
- 12-day window includes high-volatility earnings event plus macro data releases

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring "Yes" (higher on Feb 14):**
1. Strong revenue guidance: $10-11B vs. analyst estimate $7.83B suggests potential for positive surprise
2. One analyst upgrade to "BUY" mentioned (though unnamed)
3. 1-year target of $46.71 suggests long-term upside potential
4. If earnings beat significantly, could trigger short-covering rally
5. Stock already down 52% from peak - some downside may be priced in

**Factors favoring "No" (lower or unchanged on Feb 14):**
1. Historical pattern: 4 of last 5 earnings showed double-digit drops
2. Agent report emphasizes "sharp downside gaps rather than upside squeezes"
3. Bank of America (credible source): Underperform rating, expects margin pressure and negative FCF
4. Morgan Stanley sector downgrade citing softer enterprise demand
5. Internal control issues flagged - governance risk premium
6. Recent momentum negative: -7.8% in past month
7. Even if earnings are good, stock may "sell the news" given high expectations already embedded
8. Macro risks: Feb 6 NFP and Feb 12 CPI could create market volatility
9. Short timeframe (12 days) makes sustained recovery difficult after earnings volatility

**Base rate consideration:**
For a random 12-day period, stock prices are roughly 50-50 to go up or down. However, this period is NOT random - it includes a high-volatility earnings event with documented downside bias. The historical pattern of post-earnings drops combined with current negative momentum and credible analyst concerns (BofA) suggests probability below 50%.

## Outside view calibration:

Starting from a neutral 50% baseline for any 12-day period, I adjust downward based on:

1. **Earnings timing effect:** -15 percentage points
   - Historical pattern shows 4 of last 5 earnings had double-digit drops
   - Even positive surprises often lead to "sell the news" in volatile stocks
   
2. **Recent momentum:** -5 percentage points
   - Stock down 7.8% in past month shows selling pressure
   
3. **Credible analyst concerns:** -5 percentage points
   - BofA's Underperform rating with specific margin/FCF concerns
   - Morgan Stanley sector downgrade
   
4. **Partial offset for potential positive surprise:** +5 percentage points
   - Revenue guidance well above estimates could trigger relief rally
   - Stock may have some downside already priced in

Net adjustment: 50% - 15% - 5% - 5% + 5% = 30%

However, I need to consider that even with a post-earnings drop, the stock has 7-8 trading days to recover. A -10% drop on Feb 4 would require an ~11% rally by Feb 14 to break even. Given the historical pattern of sustained selling after earnings disappointments and the short recovery window, the probability remains suppressed.

**Final calibration:** The combination of earnings-driven downside bias, negative momentum, credible analyst concerns, and limited recovery time suggests a probability in the 28-35% range.
