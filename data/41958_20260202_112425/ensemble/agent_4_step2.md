Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, very concise)

1. Yahoo Finance earnings-preview (20 Jan 26) – Factual consensus numbers, Goldman “Sell” at $26; good quality sell-side data (moderate evidence, recent).
2. Finviz earnings-preview (31 Jan 26) – Same consensus, notes 6/8 revenue misses; factual, reliable aggregator (moderate).
3. CNBC Q1-26 report (04 Nov 25) – Older but factual miss, shows pattern of disappointment (weak-to-moderate given age).
4. GuruFocus / 24-7 Wall St (18 Jan 26) – Jump after TSMC; mixes fact & columnist opinion; sentiment signal only (weak).
5. GuruFocus downgrade note (14 Jan 26) – Goldman PT cut; identifiable expert view (moderate).
6. Yahoo Finance Q1-call (05 Nov 25) – Detailed margins, cash-flow, backlog $13 B; primary source transcript (strong).
7. Macro price snapshots (Jan 26–Feb 02) – Confirms today’s close sits ~$29, near 52-wk low; factual (strong for price level).
8. Asknews macro-calendar note – Identifies earnings on 3 Feb, NFP 6 Feb, CPI 12 Feb; factual (moderate).
All other Asknews clips concern foreign markets or unrelated tickers—ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to question “higher close on 14 Feb than 02 Feb”)

Up-side (Yes) – each scored
1. Raised Q2 revenue guide to $10-11 B and >$36 B FY backlog (strong – direct, primary call).  
2. Stock already −50 % from ’25 highs & near 52-wk low, allowing mean-reversion/short-cover (moderate).  
3. Analyst 12-mo PT median ≈$45 (moderate – multiple sell-side sources).  
4. Very high short interest ≳17 % (weak-to-moderate).

Down-side (No)
1. Gross-margin compression to 7.5 % projected, EPS consensus −23 % YoY (strong – repeated across sources).  
2. Missed 6 of last 8 revenue prints; pattern of negative post-earnings gaps (moderate).  
3. Internal-control, auditor resignation, Nasdaq warning (weak-to-moderate but headline-risk).  
4. Fresh Goldman “Sell” PT $26; credible bearish analyst (moderate).

Aggregate weight: Neither side overwhelms; upside catalysts slightly outnumber but downside evidence on margins historically triggers draw-downs. Net tilt ≈ balanced.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window = 9 trading days (2 Feb → 14 Feb). If window were halved (≈5 sessions) outcome hinges almost entirely on 3 Feb earnings; probability would move a hair downward (≤51 %). If doubled to four weeks, long-term drift plus backlog story would push probability upward (≈55 %).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a high-beta tech stock over 2 weeks with earnings = 48 %.  
Positive backlog guidance and depressed price justify +4 ppt.  
Persistent margin erosion, recent miss history warrant −2 ppt.  
Net inside-view = 50 % + 2 ppt ≈ 52 %.  
Given model & event uncertainty I round to 53 % to reflect slight upside from potential short-cover relief rally.

Probability calibration
My best estimate: roughly 53 times in 100 similar setups SMCI would close above today’s price on 14 Feb 26.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between 2 Feb & 14 Feb 2026, will SMCI end higher?”  
2. Base rate 48 %; final 53 % anchored to it.  
3. “53 out of 100 times, price is higher” – internally consistent.  
4. Key evidence: a) Q2 guide $10–11 B/backlog 13 B. b) Price near 52-wk low. c) Gross-margin to 7.5 %. d) 6/8 revenue misses. e) Goldman $26 Sell.  
5. Blind-spot – Blow-out earnings beat with margin surprise drives >20 % rally (prob higher than I allow).  
6. Status-quo (flat/weak trend) biases slightly toward “No”, already compensated in forecast.

Probability: 53%
