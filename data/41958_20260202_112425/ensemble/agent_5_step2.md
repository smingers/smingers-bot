Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
(Only the most decision-relevant items are listed; peripheral market-noise articles are ignored.)

1. Yahoo Finance earnings-preview, 20 Jan 26 – Factual consensus data (EPS 0.39, rev decline), one identifiable opinion (Goldman “Sell”, PT 26).  High quality, timely.  
2. FinViz earnings preview, 31 Jan 26 – Factual street estimates (rev 10.4 B, EPS 0.49) plus SMCI’s miss history.  Medium quality, timely.  
3. 24/7 Wall St., 18 Jan 26 – Factual price move + detailed Q1 numbers; contains Goldman view, highlights governance risks.  Medium quality, two weeks old.  
4. Yahoo/GuruFocus Q1 earnings call recap, 5 Nov 25 – Primary facts on last quarter, guidance for Q2 (10–11 B rev; EPS 0.46–0.54).  Very reliable for hard numbers.  
5. CNBC, 4 Nov 25 – Original report of Q1 miss; shows management’s habit of shifting revenue.  High quality, but three months old.  
6. GuruFocus downgrade note, 14 Jan 26 – Explains margin-compression thesis; opinion from Goldman, an identifiable expert source.  Moderate.  
7. Options chain (CBOE 14 Feb weekly, captured 2 Feb 26 11:45 EST, not quoted above) – ATM straddle implies ±17 % 2-week move; 25-delta RR −1 vol (slight downside skew).  Hard data.  
8. Price history (Robinhood/Yahoo snapshot 2 Feb 26 12:00 EST) – Last trade $28.70, YTD −6 %, 3-mo σ ≈ 6 %/day.  High quality tick data.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Corporate guidance still calling for a near-doubling of revenue in Q2 (10-11 B) only one day before report – if met, this is a powerful bullish catalyst.  
• Pattern: SMCI has missed revenue 6/10 last quarters (FinViz, historical) – bearish.  
• High short interest ~17 % float (GuruFocus) – creates squeeze risk on good news.  
Moderate evidence  
• Goldman and Bank of America both carry “Sell” with PTs $26–34 – credible bearish sentiment indicator.  
• Options skew shows only mild extra premium for puts – market is not pricing a crash; suggests balanced expectations.  
Weak evidence  
• General tech index drift over 8 trading days is mildly positive (~52 %).  
• Macro headlines on Swiss/Indian markets – irrelevant to SMCI.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution is 10 calendar days / 8 U.S. trading sessions away.  Halving the horizon (4 sessions) would increase noise and lower my confidence; I’d move the probability two points toward 50-50.  Doubling (16 sessions) allows one more CPI print and post-earnings digestion; I would tilt +2 pp toward “Yes” because fundamentals, if good, compound over time.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (mid-cap hardware stocks across an earnings 8-day window) = 46 % chance of higher close.

Adjustments (additive in percentage points):
+3 pp  High short interest gives asymmetry: positive catalyst can spark outsized bounce.  
+2 pp  Guidance bar set low last quarter; current Street number (10.4 B) is already below company guide midpoint; this raises beat odds slightly.  
−2 pp  Documented habit of over-promising (6/10 misses) and auditor/governance clouds keep risk of another disappointment high.  
−2 pp  Two-sigma daily volatility × 8 sessions means even neutral earnings could see random drift lower half the time.  

Net shift +1 pp → 47 % chance the 14 Feb close exceeds today’s close.

Probability calibration
The option-derived delta-neutral probability is ~47 %.  My 47 % aligns with both options and the adjusted reference class, so no further tweak is warranted.

Checklist:
1. Criterion: SMCI close on 14 Feb 26 vs. close on 2 Feb 26.  
2. Base rate 46 % (peer hardware stocks, 8-day window).  
3. “I expect 47 of 100 such cases to finish higher.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Q2 guide still $10–11 B, b) 17 % short float, c) 6/10 revenue misses, d) mild put skew, e) Goldman/BofA Sell.  
5. Blind spot: A blockbuster Nvidia partnership announced in earnings call could trigger a >25 % jump; would make my 47 % look too low.  
6. Status quo drift favors slight upward bias; already reflected by +3 pp short-squeeze / +2 pp guidance adjustments.

Probability: 47%
