The Nifty 50 rose 0.36% to close at 24,908.25, while the BSE Sensex gained 0.43% to reach 81,155.50 by 12:15 IST. Both indices fluctuated between a 0.2% decline and a 0.3% gain. On the previous day, Sunday, they dropped nearly 2%, hitting four-month lows and recording their worst budget-day percentage decline in six years. Market sentiment weakened after the government raised its gross borrowing target, leading to a rise in bond yields on Monday, despite bond and currency markets being closed on Sunday. The Nifty 50 attempted a recovery mid-session, gaining 577 points to reach 25,148, but failed to sustain the gains, losing over 400 points of that recovery. The index broke below the consolidation range of 24,900\u201325,450 and reclaimed levels below the 200-day SMA and EMA, signaling a resumption of a downtrend. Key support levels for the Nifty 50 are identified at 24,571 (Budget Day Low), 24,337 (Swing Low), and 24,060 (50% retracement of the up move from 21,743 to 26,373). Resistance is expected in the 25,000\u201325,150 band. Traders are advised to remain cautious until the Nifty 50 surpasses 25,150.

Despite the slight positive movement, the stock continues to be heavily influenced by short positions, which serve as a barometer for market sentiment on the solar sector\u2019s recovery prospects. Point72 Asset Management, LP reduced its net short position from 0.50% to 0.49% on January 29, 2026\u2014a seemingly minor adjustment, but psychologically significant, as it suggests a cautious reduction in bearish exposure, possibly due to profit-taking, risk management, or a revised view on short-term downside potential. Other major short positions include Capital Fund Management SA (0.51% as of January 13, 2026), Envestra Capital LLP (0.60% as of November 19, 2025), and Citadel Advisors LLC (1.51% as of May 21, 2025). These positions indicate that SMA Solar is a focal point for tactical, high-conviction short strategies. The company, a key player in solar inverters and energy technology, operates in a volatile sector sensitive to demand, pricing pressure, margins, and policy shifts. Short sellers bet not necessarily on company failure, but on overvalued expectations or underestimated risks. The concentration of short positions increases volatility, can suppress rallies, and creates psychological pressure on investors. The 0.33% daily gain is thus not just a neutral positive signal, but a test of resilience against persistent short-term bearish pressure.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:19 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/analysen/Artikel-SMA_Solar_Aktie_Hedgefonds_bleiben_short_doch_Profi_zieht_sich_zurueck-19425027)\n\n**Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide stock market action on Monday**\nIndian markets declined sharply during the Budget weekend trading session on February 1, 2026, after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a surprise increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options (F&O) in Budget 2026.

Analysts attributed the sell-off primarily to the unexpected STT hike, aimed at curbing retail speculation, which caught investors off guard. Despite the broader decline, Wipro, Max Healthcare, and TCS emerged as top Nifty gainers, while BEL, Hindalco, and ONGC were the biggest losers. Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities noted that the market formed a long bearish candle on daily charts and is trading below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling weak sentiment. He warned of continued volatility, with key resistance levels at 25,000 (Nifty) and 81,300 (Sensex), and potential downside targets between 24,600\u201324,300 (Nifty) and 79,900\u201379,000 (Sensex). On the upside, gains could reach 25,200/81,900 if resistance is breached.

Beats Loss Expectations, Surges to a 29% EPS Improvement in Q4 2025 Results**\nInfinite Group Inc. (IMCI) reported a quarterly earnings-per-share (EPS) of -$0.55 for the period ending January 30, 2026, marking a 37.5% improvement from the prior quarter\u2019s loss of -$0.87. Although the company remains unprofitable, the narrowing loss suggests progress in cost control or revenue generation. Management attributes this to a strategic pivot centered on a hybrid 'customised software + professional services' model targeting small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), with Nodeware\u00ae, a patented SaaS platform for network asset identification and vulnerability monitoring, positioned as the core IP. The company also signals a 'strategic roll-up' strategy to consolidate the fragmented SME cybersecurity market through acquisitions. However, critical concerns persist: Nodeware\u00ae lacks publicly available sales or customer data, the revenue mix remains heavily reliant on labor-intensive consulting services, and the company depends on over 135 North American channel partners (MSPs/MSSPs), creating distribution risk. With a negative EPS and a stock price at zero, financing for acquisitions is constrained, and integration challenges loom. Forward-looking statements emphasize differentiation and growth investments, but lack concrete metrics on pipeline conversion, return on investment, or SaaS revenue share. Investors should view the improved loss as a modest signal of operational traction rather than a path to profitability, pending evidence of sustainable recurring revenue, reduced partner dependence, and successful capital deployment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[EarningsRelease](https://api.stockpulse.de/newsbot/757800184?stream=earnings_releases&language=en&limit=5000&timestamp_format=unix&identifier=stockpulse_id&format=xml)\n\n**NASDAQ Composite Shows Slight Decline Amid Mixed Performance**\nOn Friday, the NASDAQ Composite closed at 23,513.17 points, down 0.73% by 20:00, after opening the session 0.448% lower at 23,578.96 points, following a previous close of 23,685.12 points.

The firm cited low single-digit gross margins in AI servers as a primary concern, projecting a drop to 7.5% by 2026, down from over 15% in 2022, due to competitive pressures and standardized AI server designs. SMCI's stock closed at $28.36, a 5.8% decrease, making it the second worst performer in the S&P 500. Despite being a key supplier to emerging cloud service providers and a leader in the neocloud market, the company faces challenges including supplier and customer concentration, rising memory costs, and difficulty achieving double-digit profits. While revenue growth is projected through 2028, investor sentiment remains divided: some firms rate SMCI a 'sell,' others a 'buy,' and over 17% of its shares are sold short, reflecting significant market uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 09:40 AM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/4110291/super-micros-smci-stock-faces-challenges-amid-ai-server-market-dynamics)\n\n**S&P 500 Stock Super Micro Computer: How Much Profit an Investment in Super Micro Computer Would Have Generated Over the Past Three Years**\nThree years ago, on January 1, 2023, trades in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares via NASDAQ were not executed due to weekend-related delays.

The model's base-case outlook for the period from December 17 to December 31, 2025, is bearish, as indicated by negative technical signals: the MACD is declining (short-term average below long-term), and the RSI is near the low 30s, approaching 'oversold' territory. These signals reflect strong selling pressure and a short-term downward bias, consistent with SMCI's recent four-day losing streak. The bearish near-term outlook stems from fundamental concerns, including a shrinking gross margin, temporary revenue growth dip, and intensifying competition from larger server makers and Asian rivals. Despite these pressures, the long-term bullish case remains strong, anchored in SMCI\u2019s strategic integration with NVIDIA and leadership in Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) for AI data centers. The company\u2019s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) strategy\u2014selling full rack-scale systems\u2014aims to drive margin recovery as production scales. Analysts maintain a Hold consensus with 12-month price targets in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s, with some aggressive firms projecting up to the low-$60s. The median targets imply a 45% to 55% upside from current levels, suggesting Wall Street still views SMCI as a high-growth AI infrastructure play. The AI model\u2019s short-term caution is interpreted not as a rejection of long-term potential, but as a temperature check on market sentiment following a period of volatility, accounting scrutiny, delayed filings, and investor distrust after a valuation reset and delisting fears.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 07:30 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/real-estate/25/12/49546892/chatgpt-super-micro-computer-stock-will-close-at-this-price-in-the-next-60-days)\n\n**S&P 500 Stock Super Micro Computer: How Much Investors Would Have Earned from a 5-Year Investment**\nFive years ago, on December 11, 2020, the closing price of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares on the NASDAQ was $2.99.

Here's the contextual landscape:  \n\n1. **No Order Announcements Identified**:  \n   - Despite searching 19 recent articles, none explicitly disclose new orders, contracts, or shipments [1][3][5][7][8][9][10]. This could mean:  \n     - Orders are typically reported quarterly (via earnings), not ad-hoc.  \n     - Significant deals may be announced during SMCI's imminent Q2 earnings call on February 3 [1][5][16].  \n\n2. **Near-Term Catalyst: Q2 Earnings (Feb 3)**:  \n   - Analysts will scrutinize the report for:  \n     - **Revenue trends** ($10.38B expected) and **margin health** [13][16].  \n     - Management commentary on **AI server demand**, cloud provider investments, and supply chain execution [1][8][9].  \n   - Weak results could signal order slowdowns, while strong numbers may reflect robust demand [10][16].  \n\n3. **Broader Demand Indicators**:  \n   - **AI Infrastructure Boom**: SMCI is cited as a key player in surging data-center spending, especially for GPU-optimized servers [8][9][19]. However, this hasn't translated to recent order-specific news.  \n   - **Competitive Pressures**: Low margins (7.5% projected for 2026) [10] and industry rivalry could impact order volumes.  \n\n4. **Market Sentiment**:  \n   - **Stock Performance**: Shares rose 1.89% (Jan 28) on semiconductor momentum [12][13] but remain -50% below 52-week highs [1].  \n   - **Investor Caution**: Short interest surges in SMCI-linked ETFs [3] and institutional selling [7][17] suggest skepticism until earnings clarify demand.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \nMonitor SMCI's **February 3 earnings call** for order/demand updates. Current news implies stable AI-driven interest but no near-term order breakthroughs. If margins improve or regulatory probes resolve, investor confidence (and potential orders) could rebound [16].  \n\nFor deeper analysis, review the Q2 transcript post-release.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
