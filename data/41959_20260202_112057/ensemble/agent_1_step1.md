Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Web Articles (Historical Context):**
1. **11Alive.com** (reflecting on Feb 22, 2024 death, ~1 year later): Comprehensive coverage of Riley's murder, trial outcome, and the Laken Riley Act signing on Jan 29, 2025. High-quality local news source with named officials (Mayor Kelly Girtz). Factual timeline is solid; Mayor's opinions on immigration are clearly attributed.

2. **WRDW** (Feb 26, 2024): Contemporary coverage immediately after the murder. Reliable local news documenting suspect's background. Factual discrepancy noted between ICE and NYPD records regarding prior arrests.

3. **People.com** (comprehensive timeline): Detailed factual account from murder through conviction (Nov 2024) and sentencing. Mainstream media source with extensive documentation of evidence and legal proceedings. Political context mentioned but clearly separated from facts.

4. **Red & Black** (Jan 30, 2026): Student newspaper covering the new trial motion hearing beginning Jan 30, 2026. Most recent source. Documents that Ibarra filed for new trial in Dec 2024, hearing began Jan 30, 2026. Factual legal reporting.

5. **Fox5 Atlanta** (pre-trial coverage): Documents pretrial motions and scheduling. Historical context for understanding legal process patterns.

6. **WCCS Radio** (Jan 30, 2026): Coverage of new trial motion hearing. Notes media restrictions and defense competency arguments. Conservative-leaning source but factual on court proceedings.

**Agent Report:**
Synthesizes court timeline: Jan 30-31 hearing occurred, with briefing deadline of March 2, 2026. Key finding: NO scheduled in-person hearings between Feb 2-15, but possible written filings/orders. Notes political anniversary (Jan 29) just passed. No documentary/media releases identified for Feb 2-15. Two-year death anniversary is Feb 22 (outside window). Assessment appears thorough and well-sourced.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **High-profile criminal cases during post-conviction appeals phase**: After conviction and during routine appeals motions, search interest typically declines sharply unless new dramatic developments occur (new evidence, hearing dates, celebrity involvement).

2. **Cases that became political symbols during ongoing legal proceedings**: Riley case uniquely tied to immigration debate and signed legislation. Political mentions can sustain baseline interest but typically spike around specific events (legislation votes, anniversaries, elections).

3. **Google Trends behavior for crime victim names 2 years post-incident**: Most crime victim names show exponential decay in search interest after initial incident, trial, and conviction, with spikes only at anniversaries or major new developments.

**Most suitable**: Reference class #3 (Google Trends decay patterns for crime victims) combined with #1 (post-conviction appeal phase), as this captures both the temporal decay and the specific legal phase.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window**: Feb 2, 2026 to Feb 15, 2026 (13 days)
**Context**: 
- Murder occurred: Feb 22, 2024 (~2 years ago)
- Conviction: Nov 2024 (~2.5 months ago)
- Laken Riley Act signed: Jan 29, 2025 (~1 year ago)
- New trial motion hearing: Jan 30-31, 2026 (just concluded 2-3 days before prediction window)
- Briefing deadline: March 2, 2026 (after prediction window)

**Historical patterns:**
- Major spikes occur at: initial incident, arrest, trial dates, verdict, sentencing, legislation signing
- Post-conviction phase typically sees 70-90% reduction in search interest
- Brief spikes during hearings, then return to baseline
- The Jan 30-31 hearing likely caused a spike on Feb 1-2 (baseline date)
- With no scheduled hearings Feb 2-15 and briefing deadline not until March 2, minimal catalysts exist
- Two-year anniversary (Feb 22) is outside the window but could generate advance coverage in final days

(d) **Justification:**

The baseline measurement on Feb 2, 2026 likely captures elevated interest from the Jan 30-31 new trial motion hearing that just concluded. The Agent report confirms no additional in-person hearings are scheduled for Feb 2-15, though written filings/orders are possible.

Key factors favoring **Decrease**:
- Natural decay after hearing conclusion (Feb 1-2 baseline captures peak)
- No scheduled court dates in window
- Two-year anniversary (Feb 22) outside measurement window
- Typical post-hearing pattern: spike during hearing, decay afterward
- Political anniversary (Jan 29) already passed, reducing political mentions

Key factors favoring **Doesn't Change**:
- Possible written filings/orders could sustain interest
- Ongoing political discourse about immigration
- March 2 briefing deadline might generate preliminary coverage

Key factors favoring **Increase**:
- Unexpected dramatic development (new evidence, judge's ruling)
- Major political event invoking Riley's name
- Advance coverage of Feb 22 anniversary starting around Feb 10-15

The most probable scenario is decrease, as Feb 2 baseline captures post-hearing elevation and the natural pattern is decay without new catalysts. The 3-point threshold means we need >3 point movement to register change.

Outside view calibration:

Historical data on Google Trends for similar cases shows:
- 70-80% of cases see declining interest in the week following a hearing
- ~15-20% maintain stable interest (within ±3 points)
- ~5-10% see increases (typically due to unexpected developments)

The 3-point threshold is meaningful but not large. Google Trends uses 0-100 scale where values fluctuate. For a case 2 years old in post-conviction phase, baseline interest is likely 5-20 range (not peak 100). A 3-point move on this scale represents 15-60% relative change, which is substantial.

Given:
- Feb 2 baseline likely elevated from Jan 30-31 hearing
- No scheduled events Feb 2-15
- Natural decay pattern post-hearing
- Some possibility of written filings or political mentions sustaining interest
- Low but non-zero chance of unexpected developments

Probability distribution reasoning:
- Decrease most likely: 60-70% (post-hearing decay pattern)
- Doesn't change: 20-30% (filings/political mentions sustain baseline)
- Increase: 5-15% (unexpected development or early anniversary coverage)

Calibrating for overconfidence and unexpected developments: The domain of legal proceedings has moderate unpredictability (judge could issue surprise ruling, major political figure could make speech). However, the specific 13-day window and absence of scheduled events makes decrease highly probable.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 12%
Doesn't change: 23%
Decreases: 65%
