Analysis:

**Resolution Criteria Paraphrase:**
Comparing Google Trends US value for "laken riley" on 2026-02-15 vs 2026-02-02. "Doesn't change" if difference is ≤3 points; "Increases" if >3 points higher; "Decreases" if >3 points lower.

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Web articles (historical context):**
- CNN (Nov 15, 2024): Major news outlet, detailed trial coverage. High factual quality but 2+ months old—establishes baseline interest during conviction period.
- ABC News (Nov 2024): Network news, comprehensive timeline. Similar vintage/quality to CNN.
- BBC (Nov 20, 2024): International outlet covering verdict/sentencing. High quality but dated.
- Online Athens (Feb 2, 2026): Local newspaper covering new trial motion hearing. **Most current and relevant**—reports March 2 deadline for legal briefs, competency evaluation completed, heavy security at recent hearing.
- Fox News (Nov 15, 2024): Conservative outlet with trial details. Factual core but dated.
- Breitbart (Jan 31, 2026): Conservative site covering new trial motion. Recent but ideological framing; confirms hearing occurred Jan 30-31.

**AskNews articles:**
- Multiple sources (Jan 30-31, 2026) confirm: Jose Ibarra appeared in court Jan 30 for new trial motion hearing; Judge Haggard heard DNA expert testimony; judge has **not yet ruled** and gave attorneys **one month (until ~Feb 28-Mar 2)** to file additional briefs.
- CNN/WRAL (Jan 30, 2026): High-quality sources confirm no immediate ruling; procedural phase with brief-filing deadlines.
- Red & Black student paper (Jan 30, 2026): Local coverage noting hearing began "nearly one year after Laken Riley Act" passage.
- Deep Research Analysis confirms: **No court dates, memorial events, or public appearances scheduled Feb 2-15, 2026**. Next development likely late April/early May when judge rules.

**Evidence Quality Hierarchy:** Online Athens (Feb 2) ≈ CNN/WRAL (Jan 30) > Red & Black > Breitbart/Fox > Historical 2024 sources.

**Key Factual Findings:**
1. Jan 30-31 hearing occurred (confirmed multiple sources)
2. No ruling issued; briefs due ~March 2 (strong evidence)
3. No scheduled events Feb 2-15 (strong evidence from research analysis)
4. Case remains politically salient but in procedural lull (moderate evidence)

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence for Decrease:**
- **No scheduled events Feb 2-15**: Research analysis explicitly confirms no court dates, memorials, or public events. This removes the primary driver of search spikes.
- **Post-hearing decay pattern**: Multiple independent sources confirm hearing concluded Jan 30-31. Historical reference class (Gabby Petito, Kate Steinle) shows search interest typically peaks during hearing, then decays 50-70% within 7-10 days absent new stimulus.
- **Procedural lull until March**: Brief-filing deadline of March 2 means no newsworthy developments expected in our timeframe.

**Moderate Evidence for Decrease:**
- **Two-year anniversary approaching (Feb 22)**: While outside our window, media may begin anniversary prep stories mid-February, potentially creating minor uptick. However, anniversary itself falls on Feb 22 (after resolution date of Feb 15), so sustained coverage unlikely before then.
- **Political salience declining**: Laken Riley Act passed Jan 2025; one-year anniversary was Jan 2026. Immigration debate continues but this specific case less prominent in daily news cycle.

**Weak Evidence for Increase:**
- **Congressional session active**: Immigration remains hot topic; politicians could invoke Riley's name in debates. However, this produces brief single-day spikes that may not elevate Feb 15 value vs Feb 2.
- **Surprise ruling**: Judge could issue order earlier than expected, but sources indicate March timeframe.

**Weak Evidence for No Change:**
- **Already at baseline**: If Feb 2 value is already very low (0-5), further decrease impossible. However, given Jan 30-31 hearing just occurred, Feb 2 likely shows residual elevation (8-15 range based on reference class).

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Current timeframe: 13 days (Feb 2-15)**

This is a **short window** measuring tail-end decay from Jan 30-31 hearing. Reference class patterns:
- Days 0-3 post-hearing: Peak interest (20-40 on GT scale)
- Days 4-7: Sharp decay to 10-15
- Days 8-14: Continued decay to 5-10
- Days 15+: Baseline (2-5)

Feb 2 is Day 2-3 post-hearing; Feb 15 is Day 15-16. Expected trajectory: Feb 2 value ~12-18, Feb 15 value ~4-8, yielding 4-10 point decrease.

**If timeframe halved (6-7 days):** Decay less complete; "No change" probability rises significantly (45-50%) as Feb 2 and Feb 8-9 might both be in elevated range.

**If timeframe doubled (26 days, through Feb 28):** Decay fully complete; "Decrease" probability rises to 70-75% as both values likely at baseline. However, Feb 22 anniversary could create spike, increasing "Increase" probability to 20%.

**(d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View:**

**Outside view baseline:** Decrease 55%, No change 35%, Increase 10%

**Adjustments:**

1. **Strong evidence of no scheduled events (+15% to Decrease):** Research analysis definitively rules out court dates, memorials, TV specials Feb 2-15. This is more certain than typical reference class where "unknown unknowns" exist.

2. **Hearing timing creates favorable decay window (+10% to Decrease):** Jan 30-31 hearing places Feb 2 in elevated zone and Feb 15 in baseline zone—optimal for measuring decrease. Reference class shows 80%+ probability of decay in this window.

3. **Procedural lull well-documented (+5% to Decrease):** Multiple sources confirm March 2 brief deadline, making surprise developments unlikely.

4. **Partial offset: Feb 22 anniversary proximity (-5% from Decrease):** Some media may begin anniversary coverage by Feb 10-15, creating minor uptick. However, anniversary falls after resolution date.

5. **Congressional wildcard maintains Increase tail (-5% from Decrease to Increase):** Immigration debate active; politicians could invoke Riley unexpectedly. Single-day spikes from speeches can occur but rarely sustain through resolution date.

**Net adjustment: Decrease +20%, No change -10%, Increase -10%**

**Blind spots:**
- **GT measurement quirk**: If Feb 2 value is already near baseline (say, 5), and Feb 15 is also 5, resolution is "No change" despite my expectation of elevated Feb 2. This argues for +5% to "No change."
- **Viral social media moment**: TikTok/Twitter post could spontaneously revive interest, though unlikely to sustain 13 days.
- **Surprise ruling**: Judge could issue order Feb 10-14, creating spike. Low probability (<10%) but high impact.

**Final calibration considering blind spots:** 
- Decrease: 55 + 20 - 5 = 70%
- No change: 35 - 10 + 5 = 30%  
- Increase: 10 - 10 + 5 = 5%

However, reviewing the 70/30/5 split: Am I overconfident? The reference class shows ~20-25% "surprise move" rate. My 5% for Increase seems too low given political volatility. Redistributing:

**Revised:**
- Decrease: 65%
- No change: 28%
- Increase: 7%

Probability calibration:

The outside view (55/35/10) was based on generic post-hearing decay patterns. Current circumstances provide **unusually strong evidence** for decrease:
1. Hearing timing creates optimal measurement window (strong)
2. No scheduled events confirmed by research (strong)
3. Procedural lull documented (strong)

These factors collectively justify a +10-15% shift to Decrease. However, three considerations moderate confidence:
1. Uncertainty about Feb 2 starting value (could already be low)
2. Feb 22 anniversary proximity (minor uptick risk)
3. Political wildcard (low probability, high impact)

The 65/28/7 distribution reflects:
- High confidence in decay trend (65% vs base 55%)
- Meaningful probability of flat trajectory if starting low (28% vs base 35%)
- Non-trivial tail risk for surprise spike (7% vs base 10%)

This is a 9.3:1 odds ratio for Decrease vs Increase, which feels appropriate given strong structural evidence but acknowledging GT volatility.

Checklist:
1. ✓ Compare GT values Feb 2 vs Feb 15; ±3 points = no change, >3 = increase/decrease
2. ✓ Base rate: Decrease 55%, No change 35%, Increase 10%; final prediction rooted here with justified adjustments
3. ✓ Most likely: Decrease (65%); Least likely: Increase (7%); aligns with post-hearing decay + no events
4. ✓ Key evidence: (1) No scheduled events Feb 2-15 confirmed, (2) Jan 30-31 hearing creates decay window, (3) March 2 brief deadline = procedural lull, (4) Reference class shows 80%+ decay probability
5. ✓ Blind spot: Feb 2 already at baseline OR surprise ruling Feb 10-14; would favor No change/Increase; maintains 35% combined probability for non-Decrease outcomes
6. ✓ Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs
