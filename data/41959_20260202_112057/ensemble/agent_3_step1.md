Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source contributes; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **11Alive.com (reflecting nearly a year later; mentions Laken Riley Act signed Jan 29, Trump second term)**
- **Usefulness:** Establishes that the case remains a recurring public/political touchpoint; indicates institutional/community follow-through and continued media framing.
- **Quality/date:** Local TV/news outlet; generally credible for basic facts. The piece is retrospective and narrative-driven.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Facts: date of death, conviction/sentence, security changes, crime stats, law signing date. Opinions: Mayor’s commentary on politicization and immigration-crime comparisons (named source, but still an opinion/interpretation).

2) **WRDW (Feb 26, 2024 initial reporting on suspect background)**
- **Usefulness:** Historical grounding for why the story became politically salient (immigration status, prior arrests claims).
- **Quality/date:** Local news; contemporaneous. Some contested factual claims (ICE vs NYPD records discrepancy) suggests caution on details.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Mostly factual reporting; Kemp’s quotes are political opinions/advocacy.

3) **People.com explainer (“What happened to Laken Riley?”)**
- **Usefulness:** Consolidates timeline, evidence, trial outcome; underscores national-level interest potential.
- **Quality/date:** Popular national outlet; generally reliable for broad facts, but not a primary legal record.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Mostly factual narrative; political framing included but not expert analysis.

4) **The Red & Black (Jan 30, 2026: new trial motion hearing begins)**
- **Usefulness:** Most directly relevant near-term driver of searches: a fresh legal development immediately preceding the forecast window.
- **Quality/date:** University/local paper; can be quite good on local court coverage. Date is very close to the forecasting window.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Mostly factual procedural/legal details; defense arguments are reported claims, not established facts.

5) **FOX 5 Atlanta (pretrial motions; older)**
- **Usefulness:** Reinforces the “high-profile” nature and the pattern that procedural court milestones draw coverage.
- **Quality/date:** Major local TV news; but this appears earlier in the case lifecycle.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Mostly factual; legal characterizations are reported.

6) **WCCS Radio (Jan 30, 2026: Ibarra returns to court; new trial request; media restrictions)**
- **Usefulness:** Another near-window confirmation of the court proceeding and that media is covering it.
- **Quality/date:** Radio/news aggregation; potentially more sensational. Still useful for the fact of the hearing.
- **Facts vs opinions:** Facts about scheduling and conviction; political-impact language is interpretive.

7) **Agent report (synthesis of “what could move Trends Feb 2–15, 2026”)**
- **Usefulness:** Directly addresses the forecast mechanism: likely triggers of Google search interest within the window (court filings/orders; political mentions), and notes lack of scheduled documentaries/events.
- **Quality/date:** Helpful but **not primary**; should be treated as a lead generator. It makes plausible claims (rolling briefs, likely written orders) but some specifics may be uncertain without docket confirmation.
- **Facts vs opinions:** “Likely spikes” and “virtually guarantees” are judgments; the underlying factual premise (late-Jan hearing; briefs due March) is the key actionable piece if correct.

**Net takeaway from sources:** The only clearly identified near-term “attention catalyst” around Feb 2 is *the just-occurred late-January hearing and its aftermath*, plus a general political-immigration salience. No concrete scheduled Feb 2–15 media release or commemorative event is identified.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Possible reference classes for **two-week Google Trends movement** for a named public figure/victim tied to crime + politics:

1) **High-profile crime-case names during “procedural” periods** (motions, briefs, minor hearings)  
- Pattern: brief spikes around discrete events; otherwise gradual decay toward a low baseline.  
- Suitability: High. This looks like the current phase (post-conviction, new-trial motion activity).

2) **Politicized “eponym” terms tied to legislation** (names invoked in immigration/crime debate)  
- Pattern: more persistent baseline than typical crime cases; can re-spike with political news cycles.  
- Suitability: Moderate–high. “Laken Riley Act” suggests recurring mentions, but the query is **“laken riley”** (not the Act), which likely still tracks political/news triggers.

3) **Anniversary-driven interest (death anniversary)**  
- Pattern: increase in the lead-up to anniversaries, with spikes on/near the date.  
- Suitability: Moderate but timing-misaligned: the two-year anniversary is Feb 22, just outside the window; lead-up effects may begin late, but often closer to the date.

**Chosen reference class:** (1) High-profile crime-case names in a procedural lull with occasional filings. This best matches the identified drivers and typical attention dynamics.

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long; what that implies)

- Forecast window: **2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15** (13 days).  
- Resolution rule: compare the Google Trends “timeline value” on Feb 15 vs Feb 2; “Doesn’t change” if within **±3**.

In many attention series for crime-case names:
- If Feb 2 is **immediately after a news bump** (late-Jan hearing), the base-rate expectation over ~2 weeks is **mean reversion downward** unless a new salient event occurs close to Feb 15.
- “Doesn’t change” is common when the topic is already near a **low baseline** (e.g., values in the 0–5 range), because movements are small and often fall within ±3.
- “Increase” typically requires a **fresh catalyst** (major ruling, new hearing date, viral clip, prominent political speech) occurring close enough to Feb 15 to lift that day above Feb 2 by >3.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** Interest drifts downward after the late-January court coverage fades. Procedural “briefing deadlines” and occasional filings often create *small* bumps, but not reliably enough to produce a net increase from an already post-event day.

Key outside-view drivers:
- **Recency effect:** The case had court attention Jan 30–31, making Feb 2 plausibly still elevated relative to baseline. Two weeks later, absent a major ruling, the most common outcome is **lower**.
- **Event scarcity within window:** No clearly scheduled Feb 2–15 hearing or documentary drop is identified. That raises the base rate of either **Decreases** (fade) or **Doesn’t change** (if already back near baseline by Feb 2).
- **Upset path to “Increases”:** A written order, unexpected filing, or a national political mention could plausibly occur and drive a bump; but the outside view is that such catalysts are uncertain and not the median outcome in any given 2-week slice.

Given typical attention decay dynamics after a discrete news event, the outside view tilts toward **Decreases**, with a substantial chance of **Doesn’t change** (especially if Feb 2 is already near baseline), and a smaller but meaningful chance of **Increases** (if a new catalyst lands near Feb 15).

---

Outside view calibration:

There’s no explicit “market” here, so I anchor on a generic distribution for two-week net changes in Google Trends for moderately known news terms:
- “Doesn’t change” is often a plurality in quiet periods due to the ±3 band.
- Immediately after an attention spike, “Decreases” becomes more likely than “Doesn’t change.”
- “Increases” is the upset outcome unless a scheduled event is known.

I’ll weight **Decreases** highest but not overwhelming, because the ±3 tolerance and uncertainty about the Feb 2 level make “Doesn’t change” fairly competitive.

Outside View Prediction:
- Increases: 21%
- Doesn’t change: 34%
- Decreases: 45%
