Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
- Compare Google Trends (US) “laken riley” value on 2026-02-02 vs 2026-02-15.  
- “Increases” if Feb 15 > Feb 2 by >3; “Decreases” if < by >3; otherwise “Doesn’t change” (within ±3).

2) (a) Source analysis (what each source contributes; quality/date)
- CNN (Nov 15, 2024), ABC (2024 trial timeline), BBC (Nov 20, 2024): High-quality mainstream recaps, but old; mainly background on why the term can spike.
- CNN (Jan 30, 2026) / WRAL (AP-style) / ABC wire (late Jan 2026): High-quality, timely reporting that there was a new-trial motion hearing and continuing legal process; suggests a recent news-driven bump.
- OnlineAthens (Feb 2, 2026): Local but generally reliable for court scheduling detail; key fact is March 2 brief deadline—i.e., no major court milestone inside Feb 2–15.
- Fox News / Daily Wire: Timely and fact-mixed-with-framing; useful for “will this stay in the news?” but headline-driven.
- Breitbart / Townhall / Twitchy / TheBlaze: Mostly commentary; weak for factual prediction except as a signal the topic can be re-amplified in partisan media cycles.
- People.com (Jan 12, 2026): Mainstream human-interest explainer; suggests periodic renewed attention, but not tied to Feb 2–15 specifically.
- Other AskNews items (leadership books, German TV/celebrity content, Justin Bieber searches): Not relevant to “laken riley” query interest.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (pushes toward “Decreases”):
- Court calendar: OnlineAthens says briefs due March 2; judge ruling expected within ~90 days (various reports). This implies *no big scheduled trigger* during Feb 2–15, so post-hearing attention should decay.
- Typical news/spike dynamics: legal-hearing coverage (Jan 30–31) tends to produce a short-lived search bump that fades over 1–3 weeks absent a new development.

Moderate evidence (supports “Decreases” but adds uncertainty between “Decreases” vs “Doesn’t change”):
- Multiple mainstream articles clustered around Jan 30–Feb 2 indicate a *recent* elevation in salience; by Feb 15 it’s more likely lower than Feb 2 (unless Feb 2 is already back near baseline).
- Ongoing politicization (Laken Riley Act references, ICE protest commentary) can keep a low-level background interest, potentially flattening the decline (moving mass from “Decreases” to “Doesn’t change”).

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- Partisan outlets may randomly re-boost attention if a related immigration story breaks, but this is opportunistic and hard to time.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: 13 days (from 2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15).
- If halved (~1 week): more likely “Doesn’t change” (less time for a >3-point drift; noise dominates).
- If doubled (~1 month): more likely “Decreases” overall, *but* with a possible countervailing bump near Feb 22 (death anniversary) which is just outside this window.

5) (d) Justification: adjusting the outside view to an inside view
Inside view hinges on whether Feb 2 is still on the downslope of a Jan 30–31 spike. The current info suggests:
- The most recent clear attention catalyst (new-trial hearing/testimony) already happened (Jan 30–31).
- Next procedural milestone (briefing deadline) is March 2, outside the window.
So my baseline expectation is a continued decay from Feb 2 to Feb 15, making a >3 decline more likely than a flat line within ±3. I still keep meaningful probability on “Doesn’t change” because Google Trends values can be low/flat if Feb 2 is already near baseline, and because low-volume terms can have noisy scaling.

Probability calibration
- Main scenario (most likely): Jan 30–Feb 2 coverage creates elevated Feb 2 value; by Feb 15 attention fades → “Decreases”.
- Secondary scenario: Feb 2 already back near baseline; subsequent weeks remain low and stable → “Doesn’t change”.
- Upside scenario: new breaking development (judge action earlier than expected, major political/media amplification, related immigration flashpoint explicitly invoking “Laken Riley”) → “Increases”.

Checklist:
1. Criteria/options: Feb15 vs Feb2 GT value; >+3 Increase, within ±3 No change, <−3 Decrease.
2. Outside view base rate: short-lived news spikes usually decay over ~2 weeks (implies Decrease > No change > Increase).
3. Consistency: Most likely=Decreases; Least likely=Increases; yes, matches “no new milestone in-window.”
4. Key evidence: (i) Jan 30–31 hearing/news cluster; (ii) next brief deadline March 2 (outside window); (iii) typical post-spike decay; (iv) politicized background chatter may dampen decline.
5. Blind spot: an unexpected high-profile immigration/ICE event or early judge move that heavily re-invokes “Laken Riley,” flipping to Increase.
6. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100 and sum to 100.
