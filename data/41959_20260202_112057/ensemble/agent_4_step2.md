Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (abridged)

1. OnlineAthens (2 Feb 2026) – Local court-beat piece on briefs deadline for Ibarra’s new-trial motion. Fresh, factual, low opinion content.  High quality.
2. CNN / ABC / BBC (Nov 2024) – National outlets reporting conviction & sentence.  Historical background; no new trigger in Feb 2026.  Reliable, but stale.
3. Cluster of 10 national/local items (30–31 Jan 2026: CNN, WRAL, Red & Black, Fox, Daily Wire, Breitbart, Twitchy, Townhall, etc.) – All independently confirm 30 Jan hearing; some add political framing.  Facts about the hearing are solid; partisan commentary discounted.
4. Asknews scan – No listing of any memorial, documentary, or further court date set for 2-15 Feb 2026.  Merely confirms absence of scheduled events.
5. Misc. unrelated entertainment articles – Ignored (noise).

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• Multiple independent reports (1,3) of a highly covered 30 Jan hearing ⇒ Google interest currently elevated and in decay mode.
• Historical Google-Trends pattern for crime-victim names: post-event half-life ≈ 3-7 days, then reverts toward baseline.

Moderate evidence
• Judge’s written ruling not expected until up to 90 days ⇒ low probability of fresh catalyst inside window.
• Possible early-February State-of-the-Union address where Riley could be name-checked.  Politically plausible but uncertain.

Weak evidence
• Partisan op-eds and ICE protests cite her name (Twitchy, Townhall) – episodic, often produce only short spikes.
• Anniversary effect (22 Feb) lies outside forecast window.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Resolution window = 13 days (2 → 15 Feb 2026).
If the window were halved to 6 days, decay would be steeper relative to start date → “Decreases” a bit more likely.
If doubled to 26 days, the 22 Feb anniversary and possible ruling could add upside risk → weight would shift from “Decreases” to “Increases.”

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustments

Outside-view base (21 / 34 / 45).
Updated factors:

1. Recency spike: Hearing occurred 3 days ago; Google interest on 2 Feb is probably still above quiet baseline.  (+5 pp to “Decreases”)
2. No scheduled court action, film, or memorial during window; briefs aren’t due until March.  (+3 pp to “Doesn’t change”, –3 pp to “Increases”)
3. Political wildcard (SOTU mention) – low-probability/high-impact.  (+3 pp to “Increases”, –3 pp split from other two)

Net shift: “Decreases” up modestly, “Increases” down slightly, “Doesn’t change” down a touch.

Probability calibration
Increases...........18
Doesn’t change......32
Decreases...........50
Total..............100

Checklist (short form)
1. Options: Compare GT value 15 Feb vs 2 Feb; ±3 = no change.
2. Started from 21/34/45 base.
3. Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Increases – consistent with decay logic.
4. Key evidence: a) 30 Jan hearing spike; b) No further court dates until March; c) Typical 1-week attention half-life; d) Anniversary outside window.
5. Blind spot: Unexpected SOTU or viral clip on immigration invoking Riley near 14-15 Feb could cause late surge – would flip to “Increases.”

Probabilities: [18, 32, 50]
