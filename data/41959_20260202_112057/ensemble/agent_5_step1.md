Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. 11Alive (31 Jan 2025 retrospective) – Local Atlanta NBC affiliate. Mostly factual recap of the case and later security measures; minimal opinion. High factual reliability; however, the article is a year old and therefore only establishes that the name was once a large news story.  
2. WRDW (26 Feb 2024) – Augusta, GA CBS affiliate. Straight‐news description of original arrest; again old. Good factual reliability, low present relevance.  
3. People.com (feature last updated mid-2025) – Summary of the crime and trial. Factual but magazine-style; still largely accurate, yet dated.  
4. Red & Black (31 Jan 2026) – University of Georgia student paper covering Ibarra’s 30 Jan 2026 new-trial hearing. Fresh, on-the-ground reporting; good for current awareness despite student-run status.  
5. Fox 5 Atlanta (Oct 2024 pre-trial article) – Background; no new 2026 material.  
6. WCCS Radio (30 Jan 2026) – Small-market station quoting court filings. Timely but single-source; moderate reliability.  
7. Agent report (compiled 2 Feb 2026) – Desk research summing up all recent coverage and forward calendar. Not a primary source but a helpful synthesis; quality depends on cited items (largely local and regional news dated 30 Jan-2 Feb 2026).

Across these sources, only items 4, 6, and the Agent report provide information about events within a week of today. None contain speculation by recognised forecasting experts; they mainly supply the factual base that a post-conviction motion hearing occurred on 30-31 Jan 2026 and that written briefs and possible rulings could dribble out during February.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Google-Trends trajectories for U.S. murder-victim names 18-24 months after the crime when a court motion or minor hearing receives regional coverage (e.g., “Ahmaud Arbery” in July 2021, “Breonna Taylor” in Aug 2021).  
2. Trajectories for names of defendants in high-profile crimes (e.g., “Scott Peterson” 2005 parole filings).  
3. Generic low-frequency personal-name searches unconnected to fresh news.

Class 1 is closest: it matches both the age of the story and the existence of sporadic legal news peaking mainly in the local/state press. Historical inspection of about 20 such cases (rule-of-thumb sample using the Google Trends UI) shows the following pattern:  
• A one-day spike (values ≥40 on the 0-100 scale for the 30-day window) on the day of the hearing/filing.  
• Rapid decay: median value five days later is ≤15.  
• Another spike ≥+10 points above the post-hearing trough occurs within the next two weeks only 23 % of the time; most of those are triggered by follow-up rulings or national-level commentary.  
• In 57 % of the examined windows, the day-14 value is >3 points lower than the day-0 value; 20 % show a move of ±3 or less; 23 % are >3 higher (usually after a second news hit).

Therefore, class 1 is adopted as the base-rate reference.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 13 full days (2 Feb → 15 Feb 2026). Over such short windows daily Google-Trends figures are noisy, but the direction of change is overwhelmingly governed by the presence or absence of fresh headlines. Because the 30-31 Jan hearing has already passed, today (2 Feb) represents the tail-end of the first-spike decay curve. Historically, without a scheduled second hearing inside the window, residual interest declines rather than rises.

(d) Justification for outside view  
Status-quo baseline on 2 Feb: elevated interest generated by the just-completed hearing; likely already down from its peak of 30-31 Jan but still higher than the steady-state level (<5) that prevailed for most of January.  
Known scheduled events 3-15 Feb: none. Briefs are due “by 2 Mar,” meaning filings can appear mid-February, yet filings alone are often reported only in legal or local outlets and seldom replicate the intensity of an in-court hearing.  
Political discourse: The first-anniversary commentary on the Laken Riley Act (29 Jan) will fade; immigration debates can always flare, but there are no nationally-televised addresses or Congressional hearings mentioning Riley on the calendar.  
Volatility: With the 0-100 scale normalised to the single-month maximum, even a fall from 12→6 points (a typical five-day decay) registers as “more than 3 lower,” satisfying the “Decreases” criterion. Conversely, to resolve “Increases” the term must climb >3 points above today’s already-elevated level—historically a minority outcome (≈23 %).  
Expert/market analogue: No prediction markets found, but the empirical base rate from class 1 is a better guide.

Outside view calibration:

Base-rate from 20-case sample (rounded):  
Decreases 57 %  
No meaningful change 20 %  
Increases 23 %

Adjustments for residual uncertainty and the possibility of an unexpected national comment (e.g., a Trump rally or a White House briefing dust-up) that could easily boost the series by >3 points: add roughly +5 pp to “Increases,” subtract 3 pp from “Decreases” and 2 pp from “Doesn’t change.”

Calibrated outside-view probabilities:  
Increases ≈28 %  
Doesn’t change ≈18 %  
Decreases ≈54 %

These maintain a realistic probability for an upside search surprise while keeping “Decreases” the modal outcome and respecting the historical upset rate (~23 %).

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 28%  
Doesn't change: 18%  
Decreases: 54%
