Analysis
(a) Source analysis (quality/date in brackets)
1. CNN, ABC, BBC, Fox News – mainstream, fact-checked coverage of the November 2024 conviction and the 30-31 Jan 2026 new-trial hearing (high, fresh ≤3 days).  
2. Red & Black, Online Athens – on-the-ground local court reporting (moderate-high, 2 Feb 2026).  
3. Breitbart, Daily Wire, Townhall, Twitchy, Blaze – partisan opinion pieces that nevertheless confirm the 30-31 Jan hearing and continuing political references (mixed reliability, fresh 30 Jan-1 Feb 2026).  
4. People.com, Yahoo run-recaps, Oct 2025 5-K story – human-interest retrospectives (moderate, older).  
5. Non-related entertainment items (GZSZ, Bieber, I’m A Celebrity etc.) – irrelevant to “Laken Riley” search volume.

Factual consensus across the reliable sources: a well-publicised hearing on 30-31 Jan 2026; briefs due by 2 Mar; no definite court or political event scheduled for 2-15 Feb.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Historical Google-Trends curves for comparable murder-victim names show a spike around legal hearings followed by a steady decay over the next fortnight (>50 % of cases end lower by ≥3 points).  
• No calendared trigger inside 2-15 Feb (court, anniversary, national TV address).

Moderate evidence
• Riley’s name still used in immigration debates; an unscheduled Trump rally or congressional clip could generate a one-day bump.  
• Written briefs may be filed before the 15th; local media will report but typically with far less intensity than an in-person hearing.

Weak evidence
• Partisan outlets may keep the story alive, but their reach is smaller than mainstream national TV.  
• Chance of viral social-media content is hard to quantify and historically uncommon this far from the crime date.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Prediction window = 13 days (2 → 15 Feb 2026).  
If window were halved (6-7 days) the “Decrease” edge would shrink a little— less time for decay— roughly −7 pp.  
If doubled (26 days) “Decrease” would gain ~+10 pp because the first-anniversary of the murder (22 Feb) would arrive, and interest is usually lower just before that spike.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base (28/18/54).  
Current evidence suggests 2 Feb value is still modestly elevated (post-hearing tail).  Historical decay + lack of scheduled events add 6 pp to “Decreases.”  
Offsetting: the small but real chance (≈1 in 5) of a fresh political shout-out that pushes the 15 Feb datapoint above today’s figure adds 4 pp to “Increases” and 2 pp to “Doesn’t change.”  
Net shift:

Increases 28 → 32  
Doesn’t change 18 → 18  
Decreases 54 → 50

Probability calibration
I am 50 % confident the 15 Feb value will be >3 below the 2 Feb value, 32 % it will be >3 above, 18 % it lands within ±3.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options = 15 Feb US Google-Trends daily value vs 2 Feb: +>3 (Increase), −≤3 ≤+3 (No change), −>3 (Decrease).  
2. Outside base 28/18/54 used.  
3. Most likely = Decreases; least = Doesn’t change — consistent.  
4. Key evidence: a) post-hearing decay pattern, b) no events scheduled, c) briefs due after window, d) occasional political mentions.  
5. Blind spot: a high-profile Trump speech or SOTU-like address explicitly citing Riley on 14-15 Feb; would flip outcome to “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, within 0-100.

Probabilities: [32, 18, 50]
