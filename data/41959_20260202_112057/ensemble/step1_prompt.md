Query: Recent news, upcoming events Feb 2-15 2026 affecting search interest for “Laken Riley”; include trials, releases, media appearances
Between 2 and 15 February 2026 the only firmly-scheduled, news-worthy developments certain to keep “Laken Riley” in public search-traffic are legal proceedings stemming from the defence motion for a new trial for Jose Ibarra, the man convicted of her 2024 murder.

1. Court timetable and expected coverage  
• A Western Circuit/Clarke County Superior Court motions hearing occurred 30–31 January. Judge H. Patrick Haggard heard defence DNA testimony and then gave “lawyers until 2 March to file briefs opposing or supporting a new trial” (Online Athens, 2 Feb 2026; WECT, 30 Jan 2026).  
• Because the briefing schedule runs throughout February, filings and any interim orders are likely between 2 and 15 February. Reporters have already live-streamed proceedings (WCTV, 30 Jan 2026) and multiple Georgia and regional outlets now treat the case as a running story; each filing customarily triggers fresh articles. That cadence virtually guarantees repeated spikes in search interest during the first half of February.  
• No additional in-person hearings are on the docket for 2-15 February, but the judge can issue evidentiary or procedural rulings at any time by written order, which would again draw coverage.

2. Political context driving mentions  
• The first anniversary of President Trump’s signing of the Laken Riley Act (29 Jan 2025) generated fresh partisan commentary (WCCS Radio/Fox News, 29 Jan 2026). GOP Senate and House candidates are using the anniversary to press immigration-crime themes, frequently citing Riley’s name; those talking points typically persist for several news cycles and into early February campaign events.  
• White House press-briefing clashes continue to invoke Riley’s case as evidence in the immigration debate (Guardian, 15 Jan 2026). Similar references by administration officials or members of Congress during the February legislative work period would also renew attention.

3. Media productions and releases  
• Streaming: Fox Nation hosts an on-going series/playlist “Laken Riley Murder Case” that aggregates updates (Fox Nation page, undated). While no specific February episode drop is listed in the search results, Fox Nation has historically posted short follow-ups whenever court documents surface; subscribers receive alerts, which then spill over to social media search traffic.  
• Documentary film/TV: No February 2026 documentary, network true-crime episode or limited-series release tied specifically to Riley was located in current results.  
• Books & podcasts: No February publication date or scheduled podcast episode featuring Riley’s family, investigators, or attorneys appears in available coverage. A Mother Jones feature mentioning Riley Gaines (Jan/Feb 2026 issue) is unrelated to Laken Riley herself.  
Conclusion: with nothing announced in publishing or entertainment media, courtroom developments remain the primary driver of February search interest.

4. Commemorative or community events  
• The two-year anniversary of Riley’s death is 22 February 2026—just outside the requested window—but universities, sororities and running clubs often publicise memorial runs or vigils several weeks in advance. No 2-15 February events have yet been publicised in the retrieved articles. Absence of evidence in local outlets (Online Athens, Red & Black) suggests plans are either not finalised or will be promoted closer to the date.

5. Overall assessment of information completeness  
The search results satisfy the query for:  
• Recent news: multiple 30 Jan–2 Feb articles on the new-trial motion.  
• Upcoming events: rolling legal brief deadline through March; likely written orders in February.  
They do not, however, document any:  
• Scheduled documentary/TV premiere, podcast interview, book release, or public memorial between 2 and 15 February 2026.

6. Information gaps and recommended next steps  
A. Media releases: Because true-crime streamers and cable channels often announce drops only weeks ahead, it would be prudent to search again for any “Dateline”, “20/20”, “ID Channel”, or Netflix/Max release calendars for early February.  
B. Community events: Local Athens and Woodstock social-media pages or university calendars may list February vigils or charity runs once permits are approved.  
C. Court filings: The Superior Court’s e-filing system (PeachCourt) can confirm exact filing dates; subscribing reporters usually tweet screenshots immediately.

If more precision is required now, the following additional searches could close the gaps:  
• “Laken Riley documentary February” (Google News)  
• “Fox Nation Laken Riley episode schedule” (Google)  
• “UGA memorial run Laken Riley 2026” (Google)  
• “Dateline Feb 2026 schedule” (Google)  
• “PeachCourt Jose Ibarra filings February 2026” (Google)

Absent evidence from those queries today, the analysis above represents the comprehensive, fact-based picture of events likely to influence search-volume for “Laken Riley” from 2 to 15 February 2026.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
