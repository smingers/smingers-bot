Analysis:
The name “Laken Riley” is not widely recognized, so the first task is to learn who or what it refers to (person, brand, event, court case, viral meme, etc.). Knowing whether a news story just broke, whether an investigation or trial is scheduled, or whether an entertainment/sports appearance is imminent between 2 Feb – 15 Feb 2026 will be critical. Historical Google Trends patterns for comparable names suggest that:
• If the term is tied to a one-off incident (e.g., crime victim, missing-person alert), interest spikes sharply when the story first surfaces, then decays rapidly—often leading to a “Decreases” outcome.
• If the term is linked to an ongoing trial, scheduled hearing, release of an autopsy report, or a media appearance, search interest can rebound on the relevant court date, release date, or broadcast—potentially producing an “Increases” outcome.
• If no fresh trigger happens, search volumes usually drift within a narrow 0–5 band, implying “Doesn’t change.”

1. What happened to/with Laken Riley before 2 Feb 2026?
2. Are there any court hearings, press conferences, documentary releases, or other time-bound events set between 2 Feb and 15 Feb 2026?
