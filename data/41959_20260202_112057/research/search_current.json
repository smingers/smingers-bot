He was allowed to stay while pursuing his immigration case.\n\n4. **Victim Details:** Laken Riley was a 22-year-old student at Augusta University College of Nursing. Prosecutors said Ibarra encountered Riley while she was running on the University of Georgia campus in Athens on February 22, 2024, and killed her during a struggle.\n\n5. **Political Impact:** Riley's killing heightened tensions in the national debate over immigration. The first bill President Donald Trump signed upon taking office last year was the Laken Riley Act, inspired by her killing. The Act requires detention of people in the country without authorization who are accused of theft and violent crimes.\n\n6. **Legal Arguments for New Trial:**\n   - Defense lawyers argue constitutional rights were violated by the judge's denial of a request for delay so defense could have an expert review key evidence\n   - Defense also argues constitutional rights were violated by admission of cellphone evidence they sought to exclude\n\n7. **Trial Process:** Judge H. Patrick Haggard heard and decided Ibarra's case after Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial. Ibarra received a life sentence.\n\n8. **Legal Representation:** Ibarra's trial attorneys filed a motion for a new trial within weeks of his conviction.

Judge Haggard rejected these arguments.\n   - Defense also asked to exclude evidence and expert testimony based on True Allele Casework software (used for DNA analysis). Defense expert requested six weeks to review data, leading to a request for trial delay, which the judge denied.\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the interest in \u201claken riley\u201d change between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-15 according to Google Trends?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**First Look: Leadership Books for February 2026**\nThe article highlights five upcoming leadership books set for release in February 2026.

Participants read each name aloud and chanted, 'How many more have to die?' The article contrasts this protest with the lack of similar demonstrations during the Biden administration regarding the deaths of American citizens Laken Riley, Rachel Morin, and Jocelyn Nungaray, questioning why no such outcry occurred over deaths allegedly caused by illegal immigrants. The piece sarcastically suggests that illegal immigrants could self-deport with a free flight and $2,600 in spending money. The article also criticizes the protest for not providing a list of crimes committed by those detained by ICE, implying the demonstrators do not care about criminal records. The author labels ICE as 'President Trump's Gestapo' and expresses support for mass deportations over mass amnesty, stating the publication is committed to resisting policies contrary to the will of the American people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:00 AM\nSource:[Twitchy](https://twitchy.com/brettt/2026/01/31/anti-ice-protesters-occupy-lobby-of-trump-tower-with-photos-of-those-whove-died-in-ice-custody-n2424553)\n\n**Laken Riley&#x2019;s Convicted Killer Angling For Another Trial**\nJose Antonio Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national, is seeking a new trial for the murder of nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed during a morning run on the University of Georgia campus in February 2024. Ibarra was convicted on all 10 counts in November 2024 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. His post-conviction attorneys are presenting arguments before Judge Patrick Haggard, who presided over the original trial, in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court, Georgia. Prosecutors asserted during the trial that Riley died after a violent struggle with Ibarra, who allegedly struck her head with a rock and inflicted multiple injuries across her head, neck, torso, and limbs. The case intensified the national debate on illegal immigration and led to the passage of a federal law named after Riley. The motion for a new trial marks the beginning of a potential appeals process. The article was published on January 31, 2026, and attributed to Donald J. Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:28 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Ibarra, who was apprehended by federal immigration officials after entering the U.S. near El Paso, Texas, in September 2022, is serving a life sentence without parole. His legal team has requested a new trial, citing a mental evaluation suggesting he was not competent to stand trial and alleging procedural errors during the original proceedings. The motion was heard by Judge Patrick Haggard, who presided over the original case. Ibarra had previously been arrested in New York on September 14, 2023, on charges of injuring a minor and a motor vehicle violation, but was released before a detainer could be issued\u2014though the NYPD claims it has no record of the arrest. Critics of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies argue Ibarra should have been deported prior to the murder. The case galvanized conservative political discourse, contributing to the passage of the Laken Riley Act in November 2024, which mandates the detention of illegal aliens accused of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting and allows states to sue the federal government over immigration enforcement failures. Media outlets were instructed not to show Ibarra entering or exiting the courtroom or appearing in restraints during the January 31, 2026, hearing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:49 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2026/01/30/laken-rileys-convicted-killer-angling-new-trial/)\n\n**GZSZ Episode 8453 on February 4, 2026: Lilly Hides Her Relapse into Bulimia**\nIn the upcoming episode 8453 of 'Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten' (GZSZ), set to air on February 4, 2026, character Lilly (played by Iris Mareike Steen) experiences a relapse into bulimia due to intense emotional stress. The stress stems from a complicated relationship with Julian (Onno Bu\u00df), a rift with Maren (Eva Mona Rodekirchen), and high work pressure at the hospital. Like in a previous episode, Lilly attempts to hide her illness from others, avoiding questions about her well-being and rejecting help with harshness.

According to Google Trends data, searches for 'Airbnb Rio de Janeiro' rose by approximately 290% from January 30 to January 31, 2026, while searches for 'flight Rio de Janeiro' increased by nearly 100%. Global searches for 'Justin Bieber' also surged by 96%. The rumor originated from a reported conversation between Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes and shop vendors at Village Mall in Barra da Tijuca, where Paes remained silent and smiled when Bieber\u2019s name was mentioned, interpreted as a sign of confirmation. This was reinforced by reports involving First Lady Cristine Paes and the city\u2019s social media posts referencing the word 'baby,' a nod to Bieber\u2019s hit song. The spike in travel interest included a 67% increase in hotel searches in Rio. The speculation is linked to the city\u2019s strategy to diversify the event\u2019s audience beyond its traditional LGBTQIAP+ appeal, aiming to attract a globally recognized artist with intergenerational reach. Bieber\u2019s 2026 schedule, including appearances at the Grammy Awards and Coachella, raised logistical concerns about availability, but the event is reportedly still planned for May 2, 2026. Despite the intense digital buzz and widespread speculation, the production company Bonus Track has not confirmed the rumor, maintaining the same non-comment policy used previously for Madonna and Lady Gaga announcements.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:39 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/pop/justin-bieber-no-rio-impulsiona-buscas-por-voos-e-hospedagem-na-internet/)\n\n**BOSS BABY: Springsteen hops on anti-ICE bandwagon**\nBruce Springsteen has released 'Streets of Minneapolis,' a new song criticized as another celebrity-driven anti-ICE statement, despite the lack of prior songs addressing high-profile incidents like the murder of nursing student Laken Riley or Iranian protests.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional, tear-filled monologue on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' criticizing President Donald Trump and ICE, prompting speculation about a 2027 reboot of 'The Woman Show' featuring the cast of 'The View.' In real-life developments, Los Angeles continues to see a decline in residents due to rising crime and the departure of film and TV production, with actors like Joe Manganiello and Dana Carvey citing safety concerns. On the political front, rapper Nicki Minaj has publicly aligned with Donald Trump, defending him against criticism and stating that negative feedback motivates her to support him more. Stephen Colbert, preparing to leave 'The Late Show,' expressed mixed feelings about his exit, acknowledging the emotional weight of stepping down from a long-running platform. The article concludes with a satirical tone, questioning the sincerity and impact of celebrity political activism and media performances.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 10:00 PM\nSource:[TheBlaze](https://www.theblaze.com/align/boss-baby-springsteen-hops-on-anti-ice-bandwagon)\n\n**Judge hears testimony from DNA expert as man convicted of killing Laken Riley seeks new trial | CNN**\nA judge in Clarke County Superior Court, Georgia, heard testimony from DNA expert Ruth Ballard on January 30, 2026, as part of a motion for a new trial filed by Jose Ibarra, a 28-year-old Venezuelan man convicted of murdering nursing student Laken Riley in February 2024. Ibarra\u2019s attorneys had requested a delay to allow Ballard six weeks to review evidence, but Judge H. Patrick Haggard proceeded with the trial as scheduled. Ballard testified that she could not rule out the possibility that Ibarra\u2019s DNA was transferred to the jacket and other evidence indirectly, and acknowledged she had not completed a full review of the case. She also stated that a 'reasonable explanation' for the crime lab findings was that Ibarra\u2019s DNA was deposited during the murder. Ibarra, who waived his right to a jury trial, was found guilty in November 2025 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors chose not to seek the death penalty. Ibarra\u2019s defense argues that his constitutional rights were violated by the denial of a delay and the admission of cellphone evidence and DNA analysis using the TrueAllele Casework software. The defense had challenged the validity of the search warrants for two cellphones, claiming insufficient probable cause, and sought to exclude the evidence. Judge Haggard did not rule immediately on the motion for a new trial and gave attorneys one month to file additional legal arguments. The motion for a new trial, filed shortly after the conviction, has since been amended by new counsel. Under Georgia law, the filing of a motion for a new trial extends the deadline for filing an appeal beyond the 30-day window. The case has drawn national attention, particularly following the passage of the Laken Riley Act\u2014signed by President Donald Trump in January 2025\u2014which mandates detention for individuals in the U.S. without authorization who are accused of theft or violent crimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 09:20 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://us.cnn.com/2026/01/30/us/laken-riley-dna-evidence-testimony)\n\n**Judge hears testimony from DNA expert as man convicted of killing Laken Riley seeks new trial**\nIn Athens, Georgia, Clarke County Superior Court Judge H.

Ibarra\u2019s attorneys had requested a delay to allow Ballard six weeks to review evidence, but Judge Haggard proceeded with the trial as scheduled. During the hearing, Ballard stated she could not rule out indirect DNA transfer to a jacket and other evidence, though she acknowledged she had not completed a full review. Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was permitted to remain pending his immigration case, was convicted of murder and other charges after encountering Riley on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024. His defense argues that the denial of a delay to review key evidence and the admission of cellphone data\u2014sought to be excluded\u2014violated his constitutional rights. They are seeking to vacate his guilty verdict and life sentence and secure a new trial. The motion for a new trial, filed shortly after conviction and later amended by new attorneys, extends the appeal deadline under Georgia law, which requires a notice of appeal within 30 days of a final conviction or denial of a new trial motion. The judge had previously rejected defense requests to exclude evidence from two cellphones and testimony based on TrueAllele Casework software used in DNA analysis. The case has drawn national attention, influencing the passage of the Laken Riley Act, signed by President Donald Trump, which mandates detention of noncitizens accused of theft or violent crimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:38 PM\nSource:[WRAL](https://www.wral.com/news/ap/e15b2-judge-hears-testimony-from-dna-expert-as-man-convicted-of-killing-laken-riley-seeks-new-trial/)\n\n**Here's How Senator Warnock Described the Alex Pretti Vigil**\nSenator Raphael Warnock traveled from Georgia to Minnesota and attended a vigil for Alex Pretti, an anti-ICE activist killed during a confrontation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis. Warnock described the event in religious terms, stating, 'I felt like I was standing on holy ground' and that 'Alex Pretti's blood cries out to us. We are better than this.' While Warnock issued a statement expressing condolences for the death of Laken Riley, a separate victim of a violent crime, he did not publicly acknowledge the vigil for Riley held on February 26, 2024, and his delay in posting about her death drew criticism. Critics argue that Warnock\u2019s reverence for Pretti and his stated intention to vote against a bill funding ICE reflect support for policies that opponents claim have contributed to the deaths of individuals like Riley. The article raises questions about whether Democrats will dismantle immigration enforcement or uphold the will of the American people, as expressed through the election of President Trump, who prioritized deportations.

Ibarra, convicted in November 2024 of murdering 22-year-old Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, filed for a new trial in December 2024. The hearing was held before Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard, who presided after Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial. Ibarra was found guilty on multiple charges, including felony murder, malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape, aggravated battery, hindering a 911 call, and tampering with evidence, and received multiple consecutive sentences, including life in prison without the possibility of parole. His defense argued that the conviction relied on circumstantial evidence and sought to exclude evidence from the search of two cellphones\u2014claiming the warrants lacked probable cause\u2014and requested a delay to allow a DNA expert to review evidence. Judge Haggard denied these motions and proceeded with the trial as scheduled. The trial occurs nearly one year after President Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on January 20, 2025, the first law of his second presidential term, which mandates that local law enforcement and ICE detain undocumented immigrants who commit crimes involving bodily harm, assault on police, or shoplifting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[The Red and Black](https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/jose-ibarra-new-trial-motion-hearing-begins-friday-nearly-one-year-after-the-laken-riley/article_1bf81487-a417-465a-80ec-b245c0b98d57.html)\n\n**Laken Riley's killer Jose Ibarra returns to court as illegal immigrant requests new trial in student's murder**\nJose Ibarra, who was convicted of murdering 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on February 22, 2024, on the University of Georgia campus, is seeking a new trial in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court, Georgia, on January 30, 2026. Ibarra, serving a life sentence without parole, is represented by post-conviction attorneys arguing that he was not competent to stand trial during the original proceedings. Judge Patrick Haggard, who presided over the original trial and sentenced Ibarra to life without parole, will hear the motion. The case gained national attention during Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign, becoming a central issue in the immigration debate. Trump signed the 'Laken Riley Act' into law in 2025, requiring the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of violent crimes or theft. Media outlets have been instructed not to broadcast or publish images of Ibarra entering or exiting the courtroom or appearing in shackles or handcuffs. Ibarra entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was allowed to remain while his immigration case was pending. Riley was a student at Augusta University\u2019s College of Nursing, which has a campus in east Atlanta.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:50 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/laken-riley-killer-jose-ibarra-returns-court-illegal-immigrant-requests-new-trial-students-murder)\n\n**Laken Riley Case Returns To Court As Killer Seeks New Trial**\nJose Ibarra, an illegal immigrant, was convicted in 2024 of murdering Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. On January 30, 2026, a judge, H. Patrick Haggard, began hearing oral arguments for a new trial based on claims that Ibarra suffers from a 'congenital deficiency' rendering him incapable of preparing a defense or knowingly waiving his right to a jury trial. The Laken Riley Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2025, mandates federal detention of illegal immigrants charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admitting to crimes such as burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. Had the act been in place earlier, Ibarra would have been detained after a prior shoplifting citation. If the judge grants a new trial, Ibarra\u2019s competency would be central; if found incompetent, he could be committed to a mental health facility for treatment. Discharge could occur if deemed non-dangerous. The judge is expected to rule within 90 days. The prospect of a retrial has stirred anguish among survivors and the victim\u2019s family\u2014Jessica Moore, a University of Georgia senior at the time, said, 'The feeling that loomed over our campus that day was one that students and the victim's family should never have to feel again.' CBS News reported that family members and others left the courtroom during graphic crime scene testimony, including body-cam footage of Riley\u2019s body being discovered. Prosecutor Sheila Ross described Ibarra wearing a black hat, hoodie, and gloves, 'hunting for females' on campus, and brutally killing Riley after she resisted his assault. Trump referenced the case at a rally, claiming Riley 'would be alive today if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders of the United States.' Laken\u2019s mother, Allyson Phillips, said, 'There's no end to the pain, suffering or loss. On that horrific day, my precious daughter was attacked, beaten, and shown no mercy.... This sick, twisted, evil coward showed no respect of Laken's life.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 02:04 PM\nSource:[The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/laken-riley-case-returns-to-court-as-killer-seeks-new-trial)\n\n**One year after Laken Riley Act, Angie Craig doesn't want to talk about her 'yes' vote | AlphaNews.org**\nOne year after the passage of the Laken Riley Act\u2014a law mandating the detention of illegal migrants accused or charged with certain crimes, named after 22-year-old University of Georgia student Laken Riley, murdered by a Venezuelan national living illegally in the U.S.\u2014Minnesota Democratic Representative Angie Craig is distancing herself from her initial 'yes' vote. When asked by the Daily Caller News Foundation whether she would vote differently today, Craig avoided a direct answer, instead asserting that the administration is not using the law and claiming it is being violated 'every law in the book.' She challenged critics to name a single instance where the law has been enforced. Craig\u2019s shift has drawn criticism from within her party, including from Tim Walz\u2019s deputy, Democratic Minnesota official Flanagan, who stated, 'Our immigrant neighbors deserve better.' Craig declined to define her political identity, saying she has always listened to constituents and will continue to do so. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, the highest-ranking Minnesota Republican, accused Craig of a 'flip-flop' and labeled her shift as driven by 'Trump Derangement Syndrome,' claiming she has become 'far-left looney tunes' to outflank her Senate primary opponent. Republicans believe her divergence from her previously described 'centrist' stance, combined with internal party conflict between Craig and Flanagan, could weaken the Democratic nominee in the general election. Democrats must defend this seat, along with those in Georgia and Michigan, to have a realistic chance of regaining control in the November 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 12:30 PM\nSource:[alphanews.org](https://alphanews.org/one-year-after-laken-riley-act-angie-craig-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-her-yes-vote/)\n\n**What Happened to Laken Riley? What to Know About the Nursing Student's Gruesome Murder (and the Controversial Immigration Law That Followed)**\nLaken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was murdered on February 22, 2024, during a morning jog on the University of Georgia campus. Her cell phone records show she called her mother at 9:03 a.m. and then made a 911 call that was abruptly disconnected. She was found dead with visible injuries, including blunt force trauma to the head, 65 feet off the trail in a wooded area behind a lake. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had prior arrests for theft and driving without a license, was arrested the following day. Evidence included a blood-stained jacket found in a dumpster near the crime scene, Ibarra\u2019s DNA under Riley\u2019s fingernails, and physical injuries consistent with a struggle. Ibarra pleaded not guilty in May 2024 and was tried by a judge, who found him guilty on all charges\u2014including malice murder, kidnapping, and concealing a death\u2014on November 20, 2024, and sentenced him to life in prison without parole. Riley\u2019s family, particularly her father Jason Riley, expressed grief and criticized the politicization of her death, stating she should be remembered for her character, not used as a political symbol. Her murder sparked national debate on immigration policy, leading to the passage of the Laken Riley Act in January 2025 by President Donald Trump, which mandates federal detention of undocumented immigrants accused of theft or violent crimes. Critics cite a 2024 National Institute of Justice study showing undocumented immigrants are arrested at less than half the rate of native-born citizens for violent crimes, questioning the law\u2019s basis. Riley was described by peers, family, and community leaders as a kind, compassionate, and inspiring individual who lit up every room she entered.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 02:53 PM\nSource:[PEOPLE.com](https://people.com/what-happened-to-laken-riley-11880251)\n\n**Trump Administration Overhauls H-1B Visa System, Ends Lottery, Cracks Down on Criminal Undocumented Immigrants**\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday, December 24, 2025, that it is revising the H-1B visa selection process to better protect American workers. The new policy will replace the current random lottery system with a preference for high-skilled, high-wage foreign workers, aiming to safeguard U.S. workers' wages, working conditions, and employment opportunities. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) stated that the existing lottery system has been exploited by American employers to hire foreign labor at wages below those paid to U.S. workers. Under the new rules, the annual H-1B cap will be set at 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 visas reserved for applicants holding advanced degrees from U.S. universities. The changes will take effect by the end of February 2026. In a separate enforcement action, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported arresting 1,030 criminal undocumented immigrants over a 14-day period under the 'Laken Riley Act.' DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the 'Angel's Honor Operation' was launched to honor Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student murdered in February 2024 by a Venezuelan undocumented immigrant, and that President Trump has authorized the deportation of millions of violent criminal undocumented immigrants admitted under previous administrations.

The bond request was denied. Donahue cited an immigration hold due to an ICE detainer and the federal Laken Riley Act, passed earlier in 2025, which limits the ability to release Varela from custody. He stated that, despite the circumstances, his focus remains on offering condolences to the family of the victim, Mr. Ramirez, while also asserting his intent to review the state\u2019s full evidence file. Donahue noted that there has been a 'very courteous discussion' with the prosecution and that the defense is actively evaluating the case.

The new rule prevents any contestant from being voted to perform a Bushtucker trial in consecutive days after being selected for two trials in a row.

According to an ITV spokesperson, the adjustment ensures a fairer distribution of trial participation, allowing more campmates to 'shine' and giving viewers a broader opportunity to get to know the celebrities. The rule aims to increase audience engagement by diversifying the participants in the trials.
