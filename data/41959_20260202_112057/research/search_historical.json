A hearing on this matter scheduled for November 1.\n\n2. **\"Peeping Tom\" Charge:** Judge denied defense motion to sever count 10 (a \"Peeping Tom\" charge). This charge relates to an incident reported by another woman on the same day as the murder, about 300 yards from where Riley's body was found. Judge ruled the alleged crimes are \"inextricably intertwined.\"\n\n3. **Change of Venue:** Judge denied defense request to move the trial outside Athens-Clarke County. While acknowledging this is a high-profile case with extensive media coverage (including national news), the judge ruled that widespread pretrial publicity alone does not justify a change of venue, and that the defendant had not provided evidence of factually incorrect, inflammatory, or hostile publicity.\n\n## Investigation Details:\n\n- Investigators identified Ibarra as a suspect after searching his brother's apartment where he lived\n- Ibarra was arrested on an outstanding warrant before being charged with Riley's murder\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wccsradio.com/2026/01/30/laken-rileys-killer-jose-ibarra-returns-to-court-as-illegal-immigrant-requests-new-trial-in-students-murder/\">\n# Summary of Article: Laken Riley's Killer Jose Ibarra Returns to Court\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n- **Court Appearance**: Jose Ibarra is scheduled to appear Friday in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court in Georgia to request a new trial\n- **Current Status**: Ibarra is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted in November 2024\n- **Original Crime**: Ibarra was found guilty on all 10 counts for the murder of Laken Riley, 22, who was killed on February 22, 2024, while running on the University of Georgia campus\n- **Victim Background**: Riley was a nursing student at Augusta University's College of Nursing\n- **Judge**: Judge Patrick Haggard, who presided over the original case and handed down the maximum sentence, will hear the motion\n\n## Legal Arguments:\n\n- Ibarra's legal team has obtained a mental evaluation as part of the appeals process\n- Defense claims Ibarra was not competent to stand trial\n- Friday's hearing focuses on whether alleged errors during the original proceedings justify a new trial\n\n## Immigration Status:\n\n- Federal immigration authorities stated Ibarra entered the United States illegally in 2022\n- He was allowed to remain in the country while his immigration case was pending\n\n## Political Impact:\n\n- Riley's murder became a central issue during President Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign\n- Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law last year\n- The Laken Riley Act requires the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of violent crimes or theft\n\n## Media Restrictions:\n\n- Media outlets have been instructed not to show Ibarra entering or exiting the courtroom or appearing in shackles or handcuffs during Friday's hearing\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Recent news, upcoming events Feb 2-15 2026 affecting search interest for \u201cLaken Riley\u201d; include trials, releases, media appearances\nBetween 2 and 15 February 2026 the only firmly-scheduled, news-worthy developments certain to keep \u201cLaken Riley\u201d in public search-traffic are legal proceedings stemming from the defence motion for a new trial for Jose Ibarra, the man convicted of her 2024 murder.\n\n1. Court timetable and expected coverage  \n\u2022 A Western Circuit/Clarke County Superior Court motions hearing occurred 30\u201331 January. Judge H. Patrick Haggard heard defence DNA testimony and then gave \u201clawyers until 2 March to file briefs opposing or supporting a new trial\u201d (Online Athens, 2 Feb 2026; WECT, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Because the briefing schedule runs throughout February, filings and any interim orders are likely between 2 and 15 February. Reporters have already live-streamed proceedings (WCTV, 30 Jan 2026) and multiple Georgia and regional outlets now treat the case as a running story; each filing customarily triggers fresh articles. That cadence virtually guarantees repeated spikes in search interest during the first half of February.  \n\u2022 No additional in-person hearings are on the docket for 2-15 February, but the judge can issue evidentiary or procedural rulings at any time by written order, which would again draw coverage.\n\n2. Political context driving mentions  \n\u2022 The first anniversary of President Trump\u2019s signing of the Laken Riley Act (29 Jan 2025) generated fresh partisan commentary (WCCS Radio/Fox News, 29 Jan 2026). GOP Senate and House candidates are using the anniversary to press immigration-crime themes, frequently citing Riley\u2019s name; those talking points typically persist for several news cycles and into early February campaign events.  \n\u2022 White House press-briefing clashes continue to invoke Riley\u2019s case as evidence in the immigration debate (Guardian, 15 Jan 2026). Similar references by administration officials or members of Congress during the February legislative work period would also renew attention.\n\n3. Media productions and releases  \n\u2022 Streaming: Fox Nation hosts an on-going series/playlist \u201cLaken Riley Murder Case\u201d that aggregates updates (Fox Nation page, undated). While no specific February episode drop is listed in the search results, Fox Nation has historically posted short follow-ups whenever court documents surface; subscribers receive alerts, which then spill over to social media search traffic.  \n\u2022 Documentary film/TV: No February 2026 documentary, network true-crime episode or limited-series release tied specifically to Riley was located in current results.  \n\u2022 Books & podcasts: No February publication date or scheduled podcast episode featuring Riley\u2019s family, investigators, or attorneys appears in available coverage. A Mother Jones feature mentioning Riley Gaines (Jan/Feb 2026 issue) is unrelated to Laken Riley herself.  \nConclusion: with nothing announced in publishing or entertainment media, courtroom developments remain the primary driver of February search interest.\n\n4. Commemorative or community events  \n\u2022 The two-year anniversary of Riley\u2019s death is 22 February 2026\u2014just outside the requested window\u2014but universities, sororities and running clubs often publicise memorial runs or vigils several weeks in advance. No 2-15 February events have yet been publicised in the retrieved articles. Absence of evidence in local outlets (Online Athens, Red & Black) suggests plans are either not finalised or will be promoted closer to the date.\n\n5. Overall assessment of information completeness  \nThe search results satisfy the query for:  \n\u2022 Recent news: multiple 30 Jan\u20132 Feb articles on the new-trial motion.  \n\u2022 Upcoming events: rolling legal brief deadline through March; likely written orders in February.  \nThey do not, however, document any:  \n\u2022 Scheduled documentary/TV premiere, podcast interview, book release, or public memorial between 2 and 15 February 2026.\n\n6. Information gaps and recommended next steps  \nA. Media releases: Because true-crime streamers and cable channels often announce drops only weeks ahead, it would be prudent to search again for any \u201cDateline\u201d, \u201c20/20\u201d, \u201cID Channel\u201d, or Netflix/Max release calendars for early February.  \nB. Community events: Local Athens and Woodstock social-media pages or university calendars may list February vigils or charity runs once permits are approved.  \nC. Court filings: The Superior Court\u2019s e-filing system (PeachCourt) can confirm exact filing dates; subscribing reporters usually tweet screenshots immediately.\n\nIf more precision is required now, the following additional searches could close the gaps:  \n\u2022 \u201cLaken Riley documentary February\u201d (Google News)  \n\u2022 \u201cFox Nation Laken Riley episode schedule\u201d (Google)  \n\u2022 \u201cUGA memorial run Laken Riley 2026\u201d (Google)  \n\u2022 \u201cDateline Feb 2026 schedule\u201d (Google)  \n\u2022 \u201cPeachCourt Jose Ibarra filings February 2026\u201d (Google)\n\nAbsent evidence from those queries today, the analysis above represents the comprehensive, fact-based picture of events likely to influence search-volume for \u201cLaken Riley\u201d from 2 to 15 February 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
