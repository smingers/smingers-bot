**Key Factual Baseline**: BAC closed $53.20 on Jan 30, 2026 (last reliable data point before Feb 2). Recent range: $51.66-$57.55. Current price represents -3.27% YTD decline from $55.00 (Dec 31, 2025 close).

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical pattern (Agent Report)**: 56% win rate (9/16) for Feb 1-15 period, with 80% (4/5) in recent years. Mean gain +$0.18, median +$0.25. This is direct, historical data specific to the exact timeframe. **Impact**: Establishes 56-60% baseline probability.
- **Recent bearish technical trend (Jan 18, 2026 report)**: BAC fell from $56.17 to $52.59 (Jan 11-15), breaking below support with "bearish regime change." **Impact**: Suggests momentum entering Feb 2 is negative, not positive.
- **Current price position (Macrotrends, Jan 30)**: $53.20 is only 7.5% below 52-week high ($57.55) but 38% above 52-week low. Limited upside room in 13-day window. **Impact**: Constrains potential gains.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Buffett selling (Motley Fool, Feb 2)**: Major shareholder reduced position 45% due to valuation concerns. **Causal link**: Large seller creates supply pressure, signals valuation skepticism. **Impact**: Modest negative pressure, though sales occurred months ago (July 2024-Sept 2025).
- **Analyst targets ($57-64 range)**: Multiple sources cite targets above current price. **Causal link**: Analyst upgrades can drive buying. **Limitation**: Targets are 6-12 month horizons, not 13-day predictions. **Impact**: Slight positive bias.
- **AI deployment struggles (Business Insider, Jan 27)**: Operational challenges with Nvidia AI. **Causal link**: Could signal execution risk, but unlikely to move stock in 13 days unless amplified. **Impact**: Minimal near-term.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Macro calendar (CPI Feb 11, Payrolls Feb 6)**: Could create volatility but direction unpredictable. **Impact**: Neutral to slightly negative (uncertainty).
- **Preferred dividends (Feb 2-3)**: Routine corporate action, no common stock impact. **Impact**: None.
- **Moynihan/Trump snub (FT)**: Incomplete information, unclear relevance. **Impact**: None.

**Evidence Synthesis**:
- Historical base rate (56-60%) is the strongest anchor
- Recent technical weakness (Jan 11-15 decline) contradicts the positive 5-year trend (80% win rate)
- Current price near highs limits upside potential in short timeframe
- No strong positive catalysts identified for Feb 2-15 window

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 13 calendar days (Feb 2-15, 2026), approximately 9 trading days.

**If timeframe halved (6-7 days to Feb 8-9)**:
- Prediction would shift toward **50-52%** (near coin-flip)
- Rationale: Shorter window reduces time for mean reversion or trend development. Random walk dominates. Only payrolls data (Feb 6) would be captured, not CPI (Feb 11).
- Recent bearish momentum (Jan 11-15) would have less time to reverse.

**If timeframe doubled (26 days to ~Feb 28)**:
- Prediction would shift toward **58-62%** (higher confidence in positive outcome)
- Rationale: Longer window allows:
  - Full macro data digestion (CPI, payrolls, retail sales)
  - Potential technical recovery from Jan weakness
  - CEO remarks (Feb 10) to provide guidance
  - Historical positive bias to manifest (mean +$0.18 over 15 days)
- However, extends into earnings season prep (Q1 ends March 31), adding uncertainty.

**Current 13-day window assessment**: 
- Long enough for 1-2 macro data points to matter
- Short enough that technical momentum (currently negative) persists
- Historical pattern suggests slight positive edge, but recent trend contradicts this

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting HIGHER close on Feb 15**:
1. **Historical base rate**: 56% (9/16) overall, 80% (4/5) in 2021-2025. Mean gain +$0.18 from $53.20 baseline = $53.38 target.
2. **Analyst price targets**: Consensus $57-64 implies market expects appreciation, though over longer horizon.
3. **No negative company catalysts**: No earnings risk, no major regulatory announcements scheduled.

**Factors supporting LOWER close on Feb 15**:
1. **Recent technical breakdown**: Jan 11-15 saw -$3.58 decline (-6.4%) with "bearish regime change" call. Momentum entering Feb 2 is negative.
2. **Buffett's exit**: 45% position reduction signals valuation concerns from legendary investor. While sales occurred in 2024-2025, publication on Feb 2 could amplify sentiment.
3. **Price near highs**: $53.20 is only 8% below 52-week high. In 13-day window, limited room to run versus 38% cushion above 52-week low.
4. **YTD performance**: -3.27% YTD (vs. +28% in 2025) suggests 2026 momentum has reversed.
5. **Macro uncertainty**: Dense data calendar (payrolls, CPI) creates two-way risk with no directional edge.
6. **AI execution concerns**: Jan 27 Nvidia leak suggests operational challenges, though impact timing unclear.

**Reconciling conflicting signals**:
- **Historical pattern (56-80% positive)** vs. **Recent momentum (bearish Jan 11-15)**
- **Analyst optimism ($57-64 targets)** vs. **Buffett skepticism (45% reduction)**
- **Long-term positive bias** vs. **Short-term technical weakness**

**Key insight**: The 13-day timeframe is critical. Historical Feb 1-15 pattern shows 56% win rate, but this includes full recoveries from mid-month weakness. Current situation starts Feb 2 with negative momentum from Jan 11-15 decline. The question is whether 13 days provides sufficient time for mean reversion.

**Magnitude consideration**: Historical mean gain is +$0.18 (+0.34%). From $53.20, this implies $53.38 target. But Jan 11-15 saw -$3.58 decline. If only partial recovery occurs, BAC could reach $54-55 (still below Jan 11 open of $56.17) and exceed Feb 2 baseline.

**Critical assumption**: Feb 2 closing price is unknown but likely near $53.20 (Jan 30 close). If Feb 2 closes materially lower (e.g., $52.50 due to Buffett article impact), the bar for Feb 15 to be "higher" becomes easier.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point**: Historical base rate 56% (9/16 wins), with recent 5-year trend 80% (4/5 wins).

**Adjustments**:

*Downward pressure* (-10 to -15 percentage points):
- Recent technical breakdown (Jan 11-15) suggests momentum is negative entering the period: -8 points
- Price near 52-week high limits upside potential in short window: -4 points
- Buffett selling narrative (published Feb 2) could weigh on sentiment: -3 points

*Upward pressure* (+5 to +8 percentage points):
- Historical positive bias (56% base, 80% recent) remains relevant: +5 points
- Analyst targets above current price suggest institutional support: +3 points

**Net adjustment**: -7 to -10 percentage points from 56% base

**Calibrated range**: 46-49%

**Final calibration considerations**:
- At 48%, this implies near coin-flip odds (roughly 1:1)
- This feels appropriate given:
  - Strong historical pattern (56-80%) 
  - But contradicted by recent bearish momentum (Jan 11-15)
  - Short 13-day timeframe limits recovery potential
  - No clear catalyst to reverse January weakness
  
- At 48%, I'm saying "64 out of 100 times, Feb 15 closes higher than Feb 2" - wait, that's backwards. Let me recalculate:
- At 48%, I'm saying "48 out of 100 times, Feb 15 closes higher than Feb 2"
- This implies slightly more likely to close LOWER, which aligns with:
  - Recent bearish momentum
  - Buffett selling narrative
  - Limited upside room
  - But still respects historical positive bias (not dropping to 40% or below)

**Blind spot check**: If macro data (payrolls Feb 6, CPI Feb 11) comes in significantly better than expected, could trigger risk-on rally in financials. This could push BAC from $53 to $55+ (above Feb 2 close). Historical pattern (56-80% positive) would reassert. My 48% might look too bearish.

**Conversely**: If data disappoints or geopolitical shock occurs, BAC could decline to $51-52 range. My 48% would look too optimistic.

**Status quo consideration**: In a 13-day window, "no change" is a meaningful outcome. Stock could trade $52.50-$53.50 range and end near where it started. This supports near-50% probability rather than strong directional conviction.

**Final probability: 47%**

This reflects:
- Historical positive bias (56-80%) is real but...
- Recent technical weakness and short timeframe make recovery uncertain
- Near coin-flip odds (47% vs 53%) appropriately captures the tension between historical pattern and current momentum
- Slight tilt toward "lower" outcome due to Jan 11-15 breakdown and Buffett narrative timing

---

Probability calibration:

Starting from 56% historical base rate (Feb 1-15, 2010-2025), I must reconcile:
- **Positive factors**: 80% win rate in recent 5 years (2021-2025), analyst targets $57-64, no negative catalysts
- **Negative factors**: Recent bearish breakdown (Jan 11-15, -6.4%), Buffett selling narrative published Feb 2, price near 52-week high ($53.20 vs $57.55), YTD momentum negative (-3.27%)

The 13-day timeframe is critical. It's long enough for 1-2 macro events to matter but short enough that recent negative momentum (Jan 11-15) may persist. Historical pattern suggests slight positive edge, but current technical setup contradicts this.

**Key calibration question**: Does recent weakness (Jan 11-15) override historical pattern (56-80% positive)?

At 47%, I'm assigning near coin-flip odds with slight tilt toward "lower" outcome. This reflects:
- Respect for historical positive bias (prevents dropping to 40%)
- Acknowledgment that recent momentum is negative (prevents staying at 56%)
- Short timeframe limits recovery potential (prevents optimistic 60%+)
- Uncertainty around Feb 2 actual close price (could be lower than Jan 30's $53.20 if Buffett article impacts)

**Sensitivity check**: 
- 47% = 47:53 odds against higher close
- If I'm wrong and historical pattern dominates, true probability is 56-60%
- If I'm wrong and technical breakdown persists, true probability is 35-40%
- 47% represents the midpoint of uncertainty between these scenarios

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will BAC common stock close higher on Feb 15, 2026 than on Feb 2, 2026? (13-day window)

2. **Base rate alignment**: Historical Feb 1-15 pattern shows 56% positive (9/16), recent 5-year 80% (4/5). My 47% deviates below base rate due to recent technical breakdown (Jan 11-15, -6.4%) and negative momentum entering the period. Current circumstances differ: price near highs, Buffett selling narrative fresh, YTD momentum negative vs. historical pattern.

3. **Consistency**: "47 out of 100 times, BAC closes higher on Feb 15 than Feb 2." This implies slightly more likely to close lower/flat, which aligns with recent bearish momentum, short timeframe limiting recovery, and price near resistance. Reasonable given conflicting signals.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - **Recent technical breakdown (Jan 11-15)**: BAC fell $56.17→$52.59 (-6.4%), "bearish regime change" - VERIFIED from
