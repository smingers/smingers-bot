Analysis:
a. Source analysis (salient, time-relevant items only)

1. Motley Fool (2 Feb 26) – reports Buffett sold 45 % of Berkshire’s BAC stake between mid-24 and Q3-25.  
   • Facts: SEC 13F data, dates, percentages.  
   • Opinions: Author’s speculation on Buffett’s motives.  
   • Quality: Good for historical positioning; limited forward-looking power over nine trading days.

2. Macrotrends price table (30 Jan 26) – gives closes, 52-week high/low and YTD performance.  
   • Pure data, high reliability, directly relevant to current price level and recent momentum.

3. Yahoo Finance quote page (live) – shows previous close ≈ $53, beta 1.29, 1-yr analyst target ≈ $62.  
   • Facts: current valuation snapshot.  
   • Opinions: consensus target (moderate evidence).  
   • Quality: good for descriptive baseline.

4. Yahoo Finance story (24 Jan 26) – BofA strategist Hartnett warns “anything-but-bonds” era.  
   • Facts: quotes from a named strategist.  
   • Opinions: macro view favouring non-US/commodities; implication mildly negative for US money-centre banks.  
   • Quality: One expert view → moderate evidence.

5. Business Insider (27 Jan 26) – leaked e-mails on BAC difficulties with Nvidia AI.  
   • Fact: e-mails existed; deployment struggles apparently resolved.  
   • Relevance: reputational but no material P&L impact in two weeks → weak evidence.

6. stonksmaster weekly summary (18 Jan 26) – technical recap showing a sharp drop from 56 to 52 mid-Jan.  
   • Facts: historical closes.  
   • Opinion: labels trend “bearish”.  
   • Quality: Data already captured in Macrotrends; minor incremental value.

7. Agent-supplied historical window statistics (2010-25): Feb 1→Feb 15 BAC higher 9/16 times; mean absolute move ≈ 3-4 %.  
   • Facts: simple historical frequency.  
   • Quality: Small sample but the one reference class that exactly matches stock + season + horizon.

Most Asknews items relate to cryptocurrencies named “BAC” or beer markets – noise for this task; ignored.

b. Evidence analysis (weighting)

Strong evidence  
• None – no structural or scheduled catalyst in the 9-trading-day window.

Moderate evidence  
• Historical base rate: BAC up 56 % of the time in this exact seasonal + horizon frame.  
• Macro backdrop: Hartnett (BofA) and other strategists argue for weaker dollar / lower rates → mildly negative for NII-sensitive banks.  
• Recent price momentum: stock fell ~7 % in the last three sessions, suggesting short-term down-trend.

Weak evidence  
• Buffett’s past selling – already disclosed, unlikely to alter price again in early Feb.  
• Nvidia AI hiccup – reputational noise.  
• Preferred-stock dividend dates – routine, immaterial to common price.

c. Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast horizon: 2 Feb (today’s close) to the close that will be used for resolution (likely Fri 13 Feb – markets shut on Sun 15). That is 9 trading days.  
• Halving horizon (≈ 4 sessions): day-to-day noise would dominate → probability would compress toward 50 %.  
• Doubling horizon (≈ 18 sessions): includes Feb CPI & likely more Fed commentary; macro drivers loom larger – I would lean slightly more negative (48 –49 %) because lower-rate expectations could weigh further on BAC.

d. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from outside-view 55 % “Yes” (mild upward drift).  
Adjustments:  
• Negative momentum last week (-2 ppts).  
• Growing consensus for spring Fed cuts (down-rate banks) (-2 ppts).  
• No earnings/ex-div or other one-off shocks (+0 ppts).  
• Small possibility of technical bounce after 7 % pull-back (+0.5 ppts).

Net shift ≈ -3.5 ppts → round to 51 %.

Probability calibration
I assess a 51 % chance that BAC’s official close on the last trading day before 15 Feb 2026 exceeds today’s (2 Feb 26) close. 49 % for “No”.

Checklist:
1. “Will BAC close higher on 15 Feb 26 than on 2 Feb 26?” – 9 trading-day window.  
2. Base rate 56 % up → starting point 55 %.  
3. 51 of 100 times BAC would finish higher – fits narrative.  
4. Key evidence: a) 56 % historical up-rate. b) 7 % drop in last 3 days (down-momentum). c) Fed-cut expectations hurting NII. d) Lack of scheduled catalysts.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden rebound in Treasury yields on hot jobs/CPI could lift banks sharply; would raise “Yes” odds to ~60 +.  
6. Status-quo tug acknowledged; probability kept close to coin-flip.

Probability: 51%
