Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion)

1. Motley Fool (2 Feb 26) – Fact: Buffett sold ≈45 % of Berkshire’s BAC stake by Sep 25. Opinion (author): sale signals valuation/rate worries.  High-quality, verifiable 13-F data; opinion is one journalist’s interpretation (moderate weight).
2. Macrotrends price table (updated 30 Jan 26) – Pure historical price/valuation data; no opinions.  High factual reliability.
3. BofA press release (16 Dec 25) – Routine preferred-dividend dates.  Facts only; minimal price impact (weak evidence).
4. Yahoo Finance (24 Jan 26) – Quotes BofA strategist Hartnett; opinion that “anything but bonds” era is here.  Identifiable expert; macro-level, not BAC specific (weak-to-moderate).
5. FT snippet (Jan 26) – CEO Davos slight; incomplete; negligible for price (weak).
6. Business Insider leak (27 Jan 26) – Fact: AI-deployment frictions.  Opinions from academics; may hint at execution risk but not catalyst in 2-week window (weak).
7. Stonksmaster weekly note (18 Jan 26) – Factual price path and technical comment; supports current downward momentum.  Medium quality.
8. AskNews crypto feeds (Jan 31–Feb 2 26) – Tokenised BAC quotations ≈$53.30; merely mirrors underlying equity; no new insight.
9. Yahoo/Parameter/Yahoo-Fin (Dec 25) – Analyst targets $53-61, “moderate buy”.  Identifiable analysts; but time-lagged, still useful for sentiment (moderate).

(b) Evidence weighting toward 2-Feb → 15-Feb close

Strong evidence  
• Historical 10-trading-day BAC finish higher ≈56 % (Macrotrends dataset) – repeatable statistical base.

Moderate evidence  
• Recent technical trend negative: Jan decline 57 → ~53 (Stonksmaster).  
• Buffett’s partial exit indicates valuation ceiling; removes a large stable holder (Motley Fool).

Weak evidence  
• AI-deployment hiccup (B-Insider).  
• Macro strategist call for non-US equities (Yahoo Finance).  
• Preferred-dividend payments (BofA PR).  
• CEO social-event slight (FT).

Net directional pull: moderate bearish tilt against a slightly positive statistical drift.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 9 trading sessions (2–15 Feb 26).  Halving to ~5 sessions would increase randomness, pushing probability toward 50–51 %.  Doubling to a month would give fundamentals/beta more time; I would revert toward the long-run 56-57 % “up” frequency.

(d) Justification for inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside view) = 55 % chance price is higher after 9 sessions.  
Adjustments:  
• Negative price momentum/technical regime (-2 %)  
• Buffett supply/valuation overhang (-1 %)  
• No company-specific positive catalyst in window (-1 %)  
• Broad market still grinding higher; analyst sentiment benign (+1 %)  

Inside-view probability = 55 % – 2 – 1 – 1 + 1 ≈ 52 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that in roughly 52 out of 100 comparable 9-day windows, BAC’s 15 Feb 26 close would exceed today’s close.

Checklist:

1. Restated question – “Between 2 Feb and 15 Feb 2026 (9 trading days), will BAC close higher on 15 Feb?”  
2. Base rate 55 % (historical 10-day BAC ups).  
3. Consistency – “52 times of 100, price ends higher.”  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   • Historical 56 % positive drift in 10-day windows.  
   • January down-trend from $57 to $53 shows near-term bearish momentum.  
   • Buffett sold 45 % stake 2024-25, signalling valuation/rate concern.  
   • Analyst consensus still above spot, implying mild upward bias.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden macro shock (e.g., hot CPI spiking yields) could rally bank stocks sharply and make probability too low.  
6. Status-quo – Price often moves ±2-3 % in 9 days; crossing higher is only slightly more likely than not.

Probability: 52%
