# Summary of ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread Article

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Recent Spread Values (January 2026):**
- 2026-01-29: 2.77%
- 2026-01-28: 2.72%
- 2026-01-27: 2.71%
- 2026-01-26: 2.69%
- 2026-01-23: 2.68%

**Trend:** The spread has been increasing from 2.68% to 2.77% over this recent period (late January 2026).

## What This Index Measures:

The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) measures the spread between below-investment-grade (BB or below) US corporate bonds and Treasury yields. This is a market indicator of credit risk and investor sentiment toward high-yield/junk bonds.

**Index Inclusion Criteria:**
- Below investment grade rating (BB or below)
- Investment grade country of risk
- Greater than 1 year remaining maturity
- Fixed coupon schedule
- Minimum $100 million outstanding

**Index Construction:**
- Capitalization-weighted based on current amount outstanding
- Rebalanced monthly on the last calendar day
- Cash flows retained until month-end rebalancing

## Relevance to BAC Forecast:

This data is relevant because while it's not directly about Bank of America's stock price, the index name includes "BofA" as ICE Data Indices licenses the Bank of America name for this index series. The widening spread (from 2.68% to 2.77%) indicates increasing credit risk concerns or risk aversion in high-yield bond markets, which could potentially impact broader financial market sentiment and bank stocks like BAC.

**Note:** The article is primarily technical documentation about index methodology rather than market analysis or forward-looking commentary.

- **Core thesis:** AI trade will expand beyond hyperscalers; earnings growth expected to slow for Magnificent Seven while picking up in the rest of the S&P 500; solid US economic growth should help cyclical stocks outperform

### RBC

Query: Summarize BAC historical early-to-mid-February price changes since 2010; list any scheduled company or macro events between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-15 (earnings, ex-dividend, CPI, FOMC minutes); provide recent analyst target revisions and key rate-sensitive drivers for BAC.
Early-to-mid-February share-price behaviour since 2010  
Using the downloadable daily-price file on Macrotrends (split-adjusted closes back to 1973) the move from the close on 1 Feb to the close on 15 Feb in each year 2010-2025 is:  
2010 –0.57, 2011 –0.81, 2012 +0.41, 2013 +0.25, 2014 +0.05, 2015 –0.91, 2016 –1.25, 2017 +0.89, 2018 –0.72, 2019 +1.04, 2020 –0.84, 2021 +1.65, 2022 –0.56, 2023 +0.47, 2024 +1.54, 2025 +2.10 dollars per share (Macrotrends daily table).  
• Frequency: 9 gains, 7 losses.  
• Average absolute move: ±0.93 $ (≈3–4 % of the period’s starting price).  
• Mean/median directional change: +0.18 $ / +0.25 $ – a modest positive tilt.  
2026 data cannot yet be calculated; the most recent close (30 Jan 2026) was 53.20 $ (FinancialContent historical tape).

Scheduled company-specific or macro events: 2 Feb – 15 Feb 2026  
Company  
• 10 Feb 2026 – CEO Brian Moynihan remarks at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference, 8 a.m. ET (Bank of America press release, 27 Jan 2026 – cited in previous results).  
• No common-stock ex-dividend or earnings release in the window. The last common ex-date was 5 Dec 2025; the next is projected for 9 Mar 2026 (StockAnalysis dividend history).  
• Note: several BAC preferred series DO go ex-dividend in late January and pay during our window (e.g., BAC.PRQ ex-date 30 Jan 2026, pay date 17 Feb 2026 – Simply Wall St; BAC-PP ex-date 15 Jan 2026, pay date 2 Feb 2026 – StockEvents). These have no direct impact on the common but can create small flows in the broader BAC complex.

Macro / rate-sensitive items  
• 3 Feb – December JOLTS job-openings report.  
• 6 Feb – January Employment Situation (non-farm payrolls) (BLS calendar – earlier result).  
• 7 Feb & 14 Feb – Weekly jobless-claims prints.  
• 11 Feb – January CPI and Real Earnings (BLS release schedule – earlier result).  
• 12 Feb – January PPI (standard BLS cadence; date falls inside the window).  
• 13 Feb – January Treasury Budget statement (U.S. Treasury monthly calendar).  
• The January FOMC minutes are due 18 Feb 2026; therefore no Fed minutes or blackout period lies inside 2-15 Feb (EqualsMoney & Wells Fargo calendars quoted earlier).

Recent analyst target revisions (post-Q4-25 earnings)  
• Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Outperform, PT to 63 $ from 64 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026 – earlier result).  
• Piper Sandler: Neutral, PT to 57 $ from 56 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026).  
• Truist Securities: Buy, PT to 60 $ from 62 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026).  
• December moves: RBC Outperform to 59 $ (from 56 $) and Morgan Stanley Overweight to 68 $ (from 70 $) (TechStock², 12 Dec 2025).  
The handful of changes cluster in the high-50s to low-60s, implying single-digit upside from the current 53 $ print.

Key rate- and macro-sensitive drivers for BAC into mid-February  
1. Fed-policy expectations – The FOMC left its target range at 3.50-3.75 % on 28 Jan; futures now discount two 2026 cuts. Any payroll or CPI surprise that shifts cut timing will rerate BAC’s net-interest-income (NII) outlook.  
2. Yield-curve slope – BAC’s asset-sensitive balance sheet benefits when long rates rise relative to funding costs. January CPI (11 Feb) and payrolls (6 Feb) are the catalysts most likely to steepen or flatten the 2s/10s curve during our window.  
3. Credit quality – Labour-market prints (JOLTS, payrolls, jobless claims) feed the bank’s reserve-building models; strong jobs data generally ease provisioning fears.  
4. Capital/regulatory overhang – Basel III “end-game” rules remain unresolved. Management commentary at the 10 Feb conference will be watched for hints on capital return and dividend capacity.  
5. Equity-style rotation – Reuters (via the 12 Dec 2025 TechStock² item) noted a rotation from mega-cap tech into financials late last year that helped BAC reach record territory; persistence (or reversal) of that flow will colour beta-driven moves over the fortnight.

Information still missing / potential follow-ups  
• The exact agenda and webcast link for the 10 Feb conference appearance are not yet posted; investors may want those logistics once available.  
• Confirmed BLS release calendar for January PPI (normally one day after CPI) has not been explicitly cited in the search results; if the date slips, that would affect the macro calendar.  
• Street high/low targets and any ratings changes after 30 Jan were not captured; a subsequent research-note sweep could update the consensus.

Overall take-away  
Since 2010 BAC has delivered slightly better-than-even odds of rising between 1 Feb and 15 Feb, with an average move of roughly +0.2 $ and volatility around 3-4 %. For 2026 the two-week window is light on company-specific catalysts—no earnings, no common-stock dividend—and instead hinges on a dense U.S. macro calendar: payrolls (6 Feb) and CPI (11 Feb) will anchor expectations for Fed rate cuts, the primary driver of BAC’s NII and share price. Analyst sentiment remains constructive but tempered, with most targets in the 57-63 $ band. In short, direction over 2-15 Feb 2026 will likely be set by how those macro prints move the rate curve and by any incremental colour CEO Brian Moynihan provides on 10 Feb regarding capital requirements and loan growth.

Verification checklist

2. No “</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
