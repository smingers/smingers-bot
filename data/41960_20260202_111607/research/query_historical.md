Analysis:
To judge whether BAC will close higher on 2026-02-15 than on 2026-02-02, I first need an “outside view”—how the stock typically behaves over similar two-week windows and what macro or company-specific events are scheduled between those dates. Relevant historical context therefore includes:  
• Historical BAC returns between early and mid-February in previous years (seasonality).  
• Any regularly recurring catalysts that often move the stock in that period (post-earnings drift, quarterly dividend ex-date, CPI/Fed announcements).  
• Consensus analyst outlooks for the first half of 2026 and any recent revisions.  
• Sector-wide drivers (yield-curve expectations, banking regulation, consumer credit trends).  
Collecting this information from historical price/seasonality data, analyst reports, and recent news flow will ground a probabilistic assessment of the upcoming 13-day move.
