BAC accounted for a significant portion of Berkshire's unrealized investment gains (after Apple).\n\n2. **Valuation concerns:** \n   - When Buffett initially purchased preferred stock in August 2011, BAC traded at a 68% discount to book value\n   - As of January 28, 2026 (article writing date), BAC commands a 35% premium to book value\n   - The article notes this isn't \"outrageously pricey\" but is \"no longer the bargain it once was\"\n\n3. **Interest rate environment:** Buffett may have been anticipating a rate-easing cycle from the Federal Reserve. Since BAC is the most interest-sensitive among America's big banks, a rate-cutting cycle can hurt its interest income generation more than its peers.\n\n**Background on BAC's Appeal:**\n- Bank stocks benefit from the nonlinearity of economic cycles (expansions last longer than recessions)\n- BAC is more sensitive to interest rate shifts than other money-center banks\n- The Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 to July 2023 resulted in a sizable increase in BAC's net interest income\n\n## Other Context:\n- Warren Buffett stepped down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO at the end of 2025, handing control to Greg Abel (though he remains chairman of the board)\n- Buffett was a net seller of stocks for 12 consecutive quarters as of the end of September 2025\n- The article also discusses Buffett's purchases of Domino's Pizza stock for five consecutive quarters through September 30, 2025\n\n**Note:** The article's publication date is February 02, 2026, which is the baseline date for the forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/stock-price-history\">\n# Summary of Bank of America Stock Price History Article\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics\n\n**Current Price Data (as of January 30, 2026):**\n- Latest closing stock price: $53.20\n- All-time high closing price: $57.25 (January 6, 2026)\n- 52-week high: $57.55 (8.2% above current price)\n- 52-week low: $33.07 (37.8% below current price)\n- Average stock price for last 52 weeks: $47.77\n\n**2026 Year-to-Date Performance:**\n- Year open: $55.95\n- Year high: $57.25\n- Year low: $51.72\n- Year close (as of data): $53.20\n- Annual % change: -3.27%\n- Average stock price (2026): $53.81\n\n**Recent Historical Context:**\n- 2025: Closed at $55.00 (+28.04% annual change)\n- 2024: Closed at $42.96 (+33.85% annual change)\n- 2023: Closed at $32.09 (+4.83% annual change)\n\n**Company Information:**\n- Market Cap: $388.493 billion\n- Revenue: $191.567 billion\n- Sector: Finance - Investment Banks\n- PE Ratio: Not explicitly stated for BAC, but competitors range from 3.91 to 51.28\n\n**Comparable Companies by Market Cap:**\n- JPMorgan Chase (JPM): $832.713B (largest)\n- Morgan Stanley (MS): $290.526B\n- Wells Fargo (WFC): $284.056B\n- Goldman Sachs (GS): $280.556B\n- Citigroup (C): $207.036B\n\nThe article provides comprehensive historical stock price data dating back to 1973, showing BAC's long-term performance through various market cycles.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2025/12/bank-of-america-declares-preferred-stock-dividends-payable-in-ja.html\">\n## Article Summary\n\n**Source:** Bank of America (Official Press Release)  \n**Date:** December 16, 2025\n\n### Key Facts:\n\n1. **Preferred Stock Dividend Declaration:** Bank of America's Board of Directors authorized regular cash dividends on multiple series of preferred stock, with payment dates in January and February 2026.\n\n2. **Dividend Payment Dates Relevant to Forecast Period:**\n   - January 26, 2026: Series HH and Series UU\n   - January 27, 2026: Series RR and Series TT\n   - January 30, 2026: Series L\n   - February 2, 2026: Series OO and Series PP (payment date falls on the baseline date for the forecast)\n   - February 3, 2026: Series NN\n\n3. **Company Statistics (as of December 16, 2025):**\n   - Serves nearly 70 million consumer and small business clients\n   - Approximately 3,600 retail financial centers\n   - Approximately 15,000 ATMs\n   - Approximately 59 million verified digital users\n   - Serves approximately 4 million small business households\n   - Operations across the United States, its territories, and more than 35 countries\n\n### Relevance to Forecast:\nThis is a routine corporate announcement regarding preferred stock dividends.

In December alone, alcohol sales dropped by 3.4%, according to data from retailers. This downturn stems from a political climate of fear, with ICE operations targeting Hispanic-majority supermarkets, altering daily routines. The crisis has intensified pressure on major spirits producers: Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Campari, Brown-Forman, and R\u00e9my Cointreau now hold $22 billion in aged spirits inventory\u2014the highest level in over a decade. While Campari remains resilient due to its aperitif segment, other producers face severe overstocking. R\u00e9my Cointreau, for example, accumulated \u20ac1.8 billion in cognac inventory between 2024 and 2025\u2014nearly double its annual revenue and close to its total market capitalization\u2014and reported a 7.6% revenue decline in cognac sales by November 2025. As a result, companies are closing distilleries (e.g., Suntory\u2019s Jim Beam bourbon plant for at least one year) and slashing prices\u2014Hennessy\u2019s U.S. price fell from $45 to $35 per bottle. The crisis follows a post-pandemic market correction, with inflation and reduced disposable income further dampening demand, triggering profit warnings, leadership changes, and investor exits from top industry names.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/economia/campari-co-crisi-tequila-vendite-negli-usa-restano-secco-2603864.html)\n\n**On Sunday 1st of February Basis Cash trades 9.94 percent higher**\nBasis Cash (BAC-USD) rose 9.94% over a 24-hour period ending at 01:09 PM Central Europe on Sunday, February 1, 2026.

As of December 19, 2025, the stock closed at $54.26, with short-term momentum moderating but long-term total shareholder returns remaining strong, indicating sustained growth rather than reversal. Analysts have a consensus price target of $53.521, with individual targets ranging from $46.0 (bearish) to $59.0 (bullish). A narrative-based fair value assessment estimates Bank of America at $58.98, suggesting the stock is currently 8% undervalued. This valuation is supported by durable earnings power, capital returns, and the impact of share buybacks. However, risks include a softening economy, rising deposit competition, and potential pressure on net interest income and credit quality. From a valuation multiple perspective, BAC trades at a 14x P/E ratio\u2014richer than the US Banks industry\u2019s 12x but below its own 16.3x fair ratio\u2014suggesting limited downside and potential for rerating. Investors are thus faced with evaluating whether the market has already priced in future growth or if further upside remains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 10:12 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The stock benefited from a credit ratings affirmation by Morningstar DBRS, which maintained BAC\u2019s rating at AA (low) with a Stable outlook, reinforcing investor confidence in the bank\u2019s liquidity, capital strength, and resilience to economic fluctuations. This affirmation, while not causing an immediate price surge, provides critical reassurance amid heightened scrutiny of the banking sector. The broader market context was supportive: the Dow and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosting financial equities, while the Nasdaq underperformed due to tech sector headwinds, including Oracle\u2019s weak results. BAC\u2019s strategic initiatives further strengthened its position\u2014its AI-driven CashPro Forecasting tool, upgraded in April 2025, improved processing speed fivefold and saved over 250,000 hours of manual work in 2025, enhancing client relationships and operational efficiency. On the leadership front, 394 managing directors were promoted effective January 1, 2026, signaling a focus on talent retention and growth in investment banking, global markets, and research. CEO Brian Moynihan\u2019s positive commentary on projected high single-digit market revenue growth and planned Q4 buybacks reinforced a shareholder-friendly narrative. With no major economic data scheduled for December 12, 2025, investor attention remains on Fed rate guidance, sector rotation, and whether BAC can break through resistance near $54.83, potentially unlocking further upside in a market marked by cautious optimism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/bank-of-america-bac-stock-credit-ratings-stability/)\n\n**IPC Closes Above 64,000 Points for the First Time in History**\nThe Mexican Stock Exchange's Index of Prices and Quotations (IPC) closed above 64,000 points for the first time in its 47-year history, reaching a record high of 64,321.27 points on November 12, 2025, after gaining 1.95% or 1,227.26 points.

The company's focus on expanding commercial loans and acquiring clients in international markets and healthcare signals potential future revenue growth. However, risks include persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and rising litigation costs, which could pressure margins and revenue. From an earnings ratio perspective, BAC trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.4x, higher than its industry average (11.3x) and peer average (12.9x), but still below its fair P/E ratio of 15.9x, suggesting modest upside potential.

Current oversold conditions and institutional accumulation [4][16][17] suggest stabilization near-term, though regulatory uncertainty caps significant rallies.\n\n**Key Macro Drivers**:  \n1. **Regulatory Pressure**: Proposed 10% credit card interest cap remains the largest sector headwind [10][13][18], potentially compressing margins.  \n2. **Economic Strength**: BofA forecasts >2.5% U.S. GDP growth and weaker USD supporting financials [19][20].  \n3. **Interest Rates**: Steady Fed policy expected near-term (3.50-3.75%) [18], but any dovish shift would boost bank stocks.  \n4. **Loan Demand**: Commercial real estate and consumer lending weakness persists [6][10], though rising business investment may offset this [19].  \n\n**Critical Uncertainties**:  \n- Resolution timeline for credit card rate proposal [18][13]  \n- February inflation/PCE data impact on Fed policy [18]  \n- Q1 2026 earnings outlook (consensus EPS: $4.31) [14]  \n\n**Investment Positioning**:  \n- **Short-term** (~2 weeks): Neutral. Technicals favor stabilization [16][17] but lack catalysts for breakout. Monitor $52 support.  \n- **Medium-term**: Moderate upside potential. Valuation (P/E 13.6 vs sector 15.9) [8][9] and institutional accumulation [4][11] offset regulatory risks.  \n\n**Analyst Consensus**: \"Moderate Buy\" rating with $61.50 mean target implies 18% upside, but expect volatility from policy decisions [7][13][14]. Most upside likely post-resolution of regulatory uncertainties.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
