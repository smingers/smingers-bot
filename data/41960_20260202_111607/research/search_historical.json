This is a market indicator of credit risk and investor sentiment toward high-yield/junk bonds.\n\n**Index Inclusion Criteria:**\n- Below investment grade rating (BB or below)\n- Investment grade country of risk\n- Greater than 1 year remaining maturity\n- Fixed coupon schedule\n- Minimum $100 million outstanding\n\n**Index Construction:**\n- Capitalization-weighted based on current amount outstanding\n- Rebalanced monthly on the last calendar day\n- Cash flows retained until month-end rebalancing\n\n## Relevance to BAC Forecast:\n\nThis data is relevant because while it's not directly about Bank of America's stock price, the index name includes \"BofA\" as ICE Data Indices licenses the Bank of America name for this index series. The widening spread (from 2.68% to 2.77%) indicates increasing credit risk concerns or risk aversion in high-yield bond markets, which could potentially impact broader financial market sentiment and bank stocks like BAC.\n\n**Note:** The article is primarily technical documentation about index methodology rather than market analysis or forward-looking commentary.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/BAC/Stock-Price-Action/Largest-Historical-Up-Moves\">\n**Disclaimer:** The provided content appears to be an error page from Market Chameleon rather than an actual article with substantive information about BAC (Bank of America Corporation).

The last common ex-date was 5 Dec 2025; the next is projected for 9 Mar 2026 (StockAnalysis dividend history).  \n\u2022 Note: several BAC preferred series DO go ex-dividend in late January and pay during our window (e.g., BAC.PRQ ex-date 30 Jan 2026, pay date 17 Feb 2026 \u2013 Simply Wall St; BAC-PP ex-date 15 Jan 2026, pay date 2 Feb 2026 \u2013 StockEvents). These have no direct impact on the common but can create small flows in the broader BAC complex.\n\nMacro / rate-sensitive items  \n\u2022 3 Feb \u2013 December JOLTS job-openings report.  \n\u2022 6 Feb \u2013 January Employment Situation (non-farm payrolls) (BLS calendar \u2013 earlier result).  \n\u2022 7 Feb & 14 Feb \u2013 Weekly jobless-claims prints.  \n\u2022 11 Feb \u2013 January CPI and Real Earnings (BLS release schedule \u2013 earlier result).  \n\u2022 12 Feb \u2013 January PPI (standard BLS cadence; date falls inside the window).  \n\u2022 13 Feb \u2013 January Treasury Budget statement (U.S. Treasury monthly calendar).  \n\u2022 The January FOMC minutes are due 18 Feb 2026; therefore no Fed minutes or blackout period lies inside 2-15 Feb (EqualsMoney & Wells Fargo calendars quoted earlier).\n\nRecent analyst target revisions (post-Q4-25 earnings)  \n\u2022 Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Outperform, PT to 63 $ from 64 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026 \u2013 earlier result).  \n\u2022 Piper Sandler: Neutral, PT to 57 $ from 56 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Truist Securities: Buy, PT to 60 $ from 62 $ (Benzinga, 30 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 December moves: RBC Outperform to 59 $ (from 56 $) and Morgan Stanley Overweight to 68 $ (from 70 $) (TechStock\u00b2, 12 Dec 2025).  \nThe handful of changes cluster in the high-50s to low-60s, implying single-digit upside from the current 53 $ print.\n\nKey rate- and macro-sensitive drivers for BAC into mid-February  \n1. Fed-policy expectations \u2013 The FOMC left its target range at 3.50-3.75 % on 28 Jan; futures now discount two 2026 cuts. Any payroll or CPI surprise that shifts cut timing will rerate BAC\u2019s net-interest-income (NII) outlook.  \n2. Yield-curve slope \u2013 BAC\u2019s asset-sensitive balance sheet benefits when long rates rise relative to funding costs. January CPI (11 Feb) and payrolls (6 Feb) are the catalysts most likely to steepen or flatten the 2s/10s curve during our window.  \n3. Credit quality \u2013 Labour-market prints (JOLTS, payrolls, jobless claims) feed the bank\u2019s reserve-building models; strong jobs data generally ease provisioning fears.  \n4. Capital/regulatory overhang \u2013 Basel III \u201cend-game\u201d rules remain unresolved. Management commentary at the 10 Feb conference will be watched for hints on capital return and dividend capacity.  \n5. Equity-style rotation \u2013 Reuters (via the 12 Dec 2025 TechStock\u00b2 item) noted a rotation from mega-cap tech into financials late last year that helped BAC reach record territory; persistence (or reversal) of that flow will colour beta-driven moves over the fortnight.\n\nInformation still missing / potential follow-ups  \n\u2022 The exact agenda and webcast link for the 10 Feb conference appearance are not yet posted; investors may want those logistics once available.  \n\u2022 Confirmed BLS release calendar for January PPI (normally one day after CPI) has not been explicitly cited in the search results; if the date slips, that would affect the macro calendar.  \n\u2022 Street high/low targets and any ratings changes after 30 Jan were not captured; a subsequent research-note sweep could update the consensus.\n\nOverall take-away  \nSince 2010 BAC has delivered slightly better-than-even odds of rising between 1 Feb and 15 Feb, with an average move of roughly +0.2 $ and volatility around 3-4 %. For 2026 the two-week window is light on company-specific catalysts\u2014no earnings, no common-stock dividend\u2014and instead hinges on a dense U.S. macro calendar: payrolls (6 Feb) and CPI (11 Feb) will anchor expectations for Fed rate cuts, the primary driver of BAC\u2019s NII and share price. Analyst sentiment remains constructive but tempered, with most targets in the 57-63 $ band. In short, direction over 2-15 Feb 2026 will likely be set by how those macro prints move the rate curve and by any incremental colour CEO Brian Moynihan provides on 10 Feb regarding capital requirements and loan growth.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1.
