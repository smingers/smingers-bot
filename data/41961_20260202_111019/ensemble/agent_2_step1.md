## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **8-day forward Treasury yield movements (Jan 30 to Feb 10, 2026)**
   - Most precise timeframe match
   - Historical volatility data: 5-year yields typically move 5-15 basis points over 8 trading days in stable conditions
   - Current environment: post-FOMC hold, awaiting Feb 13 CPI data (outside our window)
   - **Suitability:** High - captures short-term dynamics

2. **Early-month Treasury yield patterns in Q1**
   - First 10 days of February historically show modest mean reversion after January trends
   - January 2026 showed upward drift (3.70% to 3.79%)
   - **Suitability:** Moderate - seasonal patterns exist but less predictive than recent momentum

3. **Post-FOMC-hold periods**
   - After Fed holds rates steady, intermediate yields often consolidate
   - January 28-29 FOMC held rates; typically followed by 1-2 weeks of range-bound trading
   - **Suitability:** High - directly applicable to current situation

**Selected Reference Class:** 8-day forward movements in stable post-FOMC environments, combined with recent trading range analysis.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (6 trading days) from February 2 to February 10, 2026

**Recent Historical Patterns:**
- December 2025: 21 bp range (3.57%-3.78%), average 3.70%
- January 2026: 16 bp range (3.70%-3.86%), average 3.78%
- Last 10 trading days (Jan 15-30): narrow 7 bp range (3.79%-3.86%), ending at 3.79%
- Recent momentum: slight downward drift from Jan 20 peak of 3.86%

**Key Observations:**
1. Daily volatility has compressed in late January (3.79%-3.86% band)
2. Current level (3.79%) sits near the middle of January's range
3. No major data releases scheduled before Feb 10 (CPI comes Feb 13)
4. Fed in "patient" mode after January hold
5. Historical 6-trading-day standard deviation for DGS5: approximately 8-12 basis points in stable periods

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Synthesis:**

The 5-year Treasury yield on February 10, 2026 will be determined by a very short 6-trading-day evolution from the current 3.79% level. Several factors support a tight distribution:

1. **Momentum and Technical Factors:** The yield has consolidated in a 3.79%-3.86% range over the past two weeks, suggesting short-term equilibrium. Without major catalysts before Feb 10, mean reversion within recent ranges is most likely.

2. **Policy Backdrop:** The Fed's January 28-29 hold and "patient" messaging removes a major volatility driver. The next significant policy event (March FOMC) is well beyond our horizon.

3. **Expert Consensus:** Multiple credible sources (Bankrate, Deloitte, TradingEconomics) converge on 3.70%-4.00% for early February, with central tendency around 3.75%. This represents ±0.20% around current levels.

4. **Data Calendar:** No major economic releases between Feb 2-10 that would materially shift inflation or growth expectations. The Feb 13 CPI release falls outside our window.

5. **Historical Volatility:** Over comparable 6-8 day periods in stable environments, DGS5 typically moves ±10-15 basis points from starting levels, with tail events (±25 bp) occurring ~10% of the time.

**Base Rate Prediction:** Starting from 3.79% (Jan 30), I expect:
- Central tendency: 3.75%-3.83% (50% probability)
- Likely range: 3.68%-3.90% (80% probability)  
- Tail scenarios: Below 3.60% or above 4.00% only with unexpected shocks (~5% each tail)

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration Methodology:**

Starting point: 3.79% (last observed value, January 30, 2026)

**Historical volatility anchor:**
- 6-trading-day standard deviation in stable periods: ~10 basis points
- Recent 2-week realized volatility: ~7 basis points (compressed)
- Using conservative estimate: 10 bp standard deviation

**Distribution shape:**
- Slightly right-skewed: upside risks from potential inflation concerns or supply pressure slightly outweigh downside risks
- No major asymmetric catalysts in the 6-day window
- Approximating a near-normal distribution with mild positive skew

**Percentile construction:**
- 50th percentile (median): 3.79% (current level, slight drift to 3.78% from consensus)
- 10th percentile: Current - 1.3σ ≈ 3.79% - 13 bp = 3.66%
- 90th percentile: Current + 1.3σ ≈ 3.79% + 13 bp = 3.92%
- Intermediate percentiles interpolated with slight right skew

**Tail risk adjustment:**
- 10% chance of moves exceeding ±13 bp requires accounting for:
  - Unexpected geopolitical events
  - Surprise data leaks or revisions
  - Technical market disruptions
  - Historical "fat tail" events in Treasury markets

**Bounds check:**
- Lower bound: 3.026% - extremely unlikely (would require >70 bp crash)
- Upper bound: 5.038% - extremely unlikely (would require >120 bp spike)
- My 10th-90th percentile range (3.66%-3.92%) is well within bounds and reflects realistic short-term dynamics

**Final calibration considerations:**
- Recent consolidation suggests lower near-term volatility
- Post-FOMC hold periods typically see reduced volatility
- No scheduled catalysts supports tight distribution
- Expert consensus 3.70%-4.00% validates my range
- Allowing ~25 bp total range (10th-90th) for 6 trading days is appropriately conservative

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.66
Percentile 20: 3.70
Percentile 40: 3.76
Percentile 60: 3.81
Percentile 80: 3.87
Percentile 90: 3.92
