Analysis:

**(a) Source analysis**

**FRED/Treasury documentation (various dates):** Pure metadata describing DGS5 methodology. High quality for definitions, zero predictive content.

**YCharts implicit (30 Jan 2026):** The outside-view context cites last observed DGS5 = 3.79% on 30 Jan. This is factual hard data from the H.15 release. Quality: excellent for the baseline.

**Morningstar UK Bank of England article (7 Jan 2026):** Discusses UK rates (base rate 3.75%, expected cuts to ~2% by end-2026). Named analysts (BlackRock's Vivek Paul, ING economists) provide opinions on UK monetary policy. Not directly relevant to US 5-year Treasuries; weak applicability.

**Bankrate mortgage forecast (30 Jan 2026):** Stephen Kates (Bankrate analyst) expects Fed on hold until Q2 2026, mortgage rates pinned near 6%. Fannie Mae predicts ~6% through 2027. Jeff Der Gurahian (loanDepot) emphasizes unemployment as key signal. Lisa Sturtevant (Bright MLS) warns of political uncertainty pushing rates higher. Mixed expert opinions; moderate quality for directional bias (rates stable-to-higher near-term).

**US Bank bond article (content dated 2024-2026, published July 2021—likely updated):** Bill Merz (US Bank Asset Management) states 10-year yields rangebound 4.00-4.25%, Fed at 3.50-3.75% after January hold, median FOMC projects one 2026 cut while investors expect two. Tariff pressures visible but not extreme. Named expert, recent data; high quality for medium-term context.

**AskNews articles (various Jan-Feb 2026):**

- **Korean article (2 Feb):** Foreign Treasury holdings rose $2.6T (38%) despite share declining to 36.9%. Supply-driven pressure on yields. Factual data, moderate relevance (explains upward yield pressure from issuance).

- **Indian bond yields (2 Feb):** India's 10-year hit 6.78%, highest in a year, due to elevated borrowing. Not directly relevant to US yields; weak applicability.

- **Spanish Treasury auctions (1-2 Feb):** Spain issuing debt with 3-year yields ~2.35%, 7-year ~3%. European context; minimal direct relevance to US 5-year.

- **UAE Sukuk/bonds (31 Jan):** AED-denominated issuance, YTM 3.66-3.90%, 9bp above US Treasuries. Confirms US Treasury benchmarks in mid-to-high 3% range; weak to moderate relevance.

- **Indian analyst Harsimran Singh Sahni (31 Jan):** States Indian 5-year bonds yield >6.50%. Not relevant to US yields.

- **NY bonds flat (30 Jan):** 10-year yield unchanged at 4.23% after Fed chair nomination and inflation data. Factual market observation; moderate relevance (confirms 10-year stability).

- **Morningstar data (30 Jan):** 30-year yield rose to 4.872% (+4.3bp) in January; 10-year rose to 4.240% (+8.8bp). Factual data showing upward January drift; moderate to strong relevance (suggests 5-year likely rose similarly).

- **CapitalSpectator fair-value models (14 Jan):** 10-year trading ~22bp above fair value, lowest premium in 3 years. Suggests yields near neutral, limited further decline. Named source with clear methodology; moderate quality.

- **Economic Times bond outlook (31 Dec 2025):** 2025 bonds gained >7% (best since 2020) on Fed cuts. 2026 outlook more muted: traders price ~60bp cuts (vs 75bp in 2025), fiscal stimulus may elevate long-term yields, banks forecast 10-year ending 2026 at ~4.1% or higher. Multiple bank forecasts; moderate to strong quality for longer-term bias (yields stable-to-higher).

- **Chinese 10-year ETF article (25 Dec 2025):** China's 10-year yield forecast 1.5-2% range in 2026. Not relevant to US yields.

- **UDN article (20 Dec 2025):** US Treasuries on track for best year in 5 years; 10-year yield down 4bp weekly. Fed cut three times in 2025, labor market weak. Futures price two more cuts in 2026. TD Securities and SCFR analysts quoted; moderate quality for directional bias (further cuts likely, yields lower).

- **InstaForex 5-year auction results (25 Nov, 27 Oct 2025):** November auction yield 3.562% (down from 3.625% in October). Factual data showing declining trend through Q4 2025; moderate relevance (establishes trajectory entering 2026).

**Deep Research Analysis summary:** Expects 5-year yield to "decline moderately through mid-February 2026" due to labor market weakness and Fed cut expectations. Acknowledges upside risks (geopolitical oil shocks, Warsh nomination uncertainty). Cites 10-year benchmark range 3.95-4.20%. Multiple factors synthesized; moderate to strong quality for near-term directional bias (downward with contained range).

**(b) Evidence analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Last observed DGS5 = 3.79% (30 Jan 2026):** Hard data from FRED. This is the anchor.
- **Historical intra-month volatility (2023-2025):** 6-day absolute moves average 7bp, σ=10bp, 90% within ±17bp. Structural pattern; very strong for setting range.
- **No major data releases 3-9 Feb:** CPI on 13 Feb (after resolution), payrolls on 7 Feb (late in window). Limits shock potential. Strong for range constraint.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **10-year yield stable 4.20-4.25% (late Jan):** Morningstar data shows +8.8bp in January. If 5-year moved proportionally, implies 3.79% baseline is slightly elevated vs month-start. Suggests small mean reversion downward possible.
- **Fed on hold at 3.50-3.75%, median projects one 2026 cut, markets price two:** US Bank/Deep Research. Dovish tilt supports lower yields, but slowly. Moderate downward pressure.
- **Labor market weakness (unemployment at 4-year high):** Deep Research, UDN article. Supports Fed cuts, downward yield pressure. Moderate impact over 6 days.
- **Treasury supply pressure (Korean article, US Bank):** Heavy issuance, especially short-term bills. Mild upward pressure on yields. Moderate countervailing factor.
- **5-year auction yields declining Q4 2025 (3.625% Oct → 3.562% Nov):** InstaForex. Trend was downward entering 2026, but 3.79% on 30 Jan suggests reversal. Moderate evidence of recent upward correction.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Payrolls on 7 Feb:** Deep Research notes historically nudges 5-year up if labor demand firm. But release is 3 days before resolution; market may not fully price by 10 Feb. Weak to moderate upward risk.
- **ISM services 3 Feb:** Could hint at slowdown. Weak impact (services PMI less directly tied to yields than CPI/payrolls).
- **Kevin Warsh Fed chair nomination:** US Bank notes uncertainty, but Deep Research says signals support cuts. Confirmation not until later; minimal impact on 10 Feb yield. Weak.
- **Geopolitical oil shocks (US-Iran):** Deep Research mentions as upside risk. No concrete evidence of imminent shock. Weak tail risk.

**(c) Timeframe analysis**

**Prediction window:** 6 business days (3-10 Feb 2026). Resolution on 10 Feb means the published DGS5 value for that date.

**If timeframe halved (3 days):** Range would tighten significantly. Historical 3-day σ ≈ 6bp; 90% moves within ±11bp. Median would stay near 3.79%, but tails compress to ~3.68-3.90%.

**If timeframe doubled (12 days):** Range expands. Historical 12-day σ ≈ 14bp; 90% moves within ±24bp. More time for payrolls (7 Feb) and any follow-on commentary to be digested. Median might drift slightly lower (~3.77%) as Fed cut pricing firms, but tails widen to ~3.55-4.00%.

**Current 6-day window:** Goldilocks for contained volatility. Payrolls lands late (7 Feb), so only 1 trading day (10 Feb) to react. ISM services (3 Feb) early, but low impact. Fed speakers quiet (post-meeting blackout). Expect drift more than jump.

**(d) Justification for shifts from outside view**

**Outside view (from context):** Median 3.81%, 10th 3.62%, 90th 3.98%. Based on normal core (μ=3.81%, σ=0.08%) with fat tails.

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **Starting point correction:** Outside view used μ=3.81%, but that was a forward estimate. Actual last close is 3.79% (30 Jan). Shift median down 2bp to 3.79%.

2. **January upward drift already realized:** Morningstar shows 10-year +8.8bp in January. If 5-year moved similarly, the 3.79% close already reflects some of the "upward pressure from supply" noted in outside view. The January move is now *past*, not future. This reduces further upward risk. Compress upper tail slightly: 90th from 3.98% → 3.96%.

3. **Fed cut pricing firming (moderate downward pressure):** Markets price two cuts in 2026 (US Bank), labor data weak (Deep Research). Over 6 days, this is a slow-burn factor, not a shock. Nudge median down 1bp to 3.78%. But uncertainty remains (only one cut in median FOMC projection), so don't over-shift.

4. **Payrolls on 7 Feb (weak upward risk):** If strong, could push yields up 3-5bp by 10 Feb. If weak, reinforces cuts, yields down 3-5bp. Net: symmetric risk, but historical bias is small upward surprise (Deep Research). Add 1bp to median → 3.79%. Widen tails slightly to capture ±5bp shock: 10th from 3.62% → 3.64%, 90th stays 3.96%.

5. **No CPI in window (strong range constraint):** CPI (13 Feb) is the big volatility driver; we miss it. Historical 6-day σ=10bp is appropriate. No need to widen tails for inflation surprise. Keep 90% range ~±17bp from median.

**Net adjustments:**
- Median: 3.81% → 3.79% (starting point) → 3.78% (Fed cuts) → 3.79% (payrolls risk). Final: **3.79%**.
- 10th: 3.62% → 3.64% (tighten lower tail, January drift realized).
- 90th: 3.98% → 3.96% (compress upper tail, January move in past).
- σ stays ~10bp (historical 6-day norm).

**Final distribution logic:**
- Median 3.79% (status quo + tiny downward bias from Fed cut pricing).
- 10th/90th span 32bp (3.64-3.96%), consistent with historical 90% envelope of ±16bp around median.
- Slight negative skew (10th is 15bp below median, 90th is 17bp above) reflects that downside from weak payrolls or dovish Fed commentary is modestly more likely than upside shock (no CPI, no geopolitical event yet materialized).

**Distribution construction:**
- Assume near-normal core with σ=0.09% (9bp), centered at 3.79%.
- Percentile 1: extreme lower tail, allow -25bp shock → 3.54%.
- Percentile 5: -1.65σ ≈ -15bp → 3.64%.
- Percentile 10: -1.28σ ≈ -12bp → 3.67%.
- Percentile 20: -0.84σ ≈ -8bp → 3.71%.
- Percentile 40: -0.25σ ≈ -2bp → 3.77%.
- Percentile 60: +0.25σ ≈ +2bp → 3.81%.
- Percentile 80: +0.84σ ≈ +8bp → 3.87%.
- Percentile 90: +1.28σ ≈ +12bp → 3.91%.
- Percentile 95: +1.65σ ≈ +15bp → 3.94%.
- Percentile 99: extreme upper tail, allow +25bp shock → 4.04%.

Check: Median (≈50th) ≈ 3.79%, mean ≈ 3.79% (symmetric core). 10th-90th span = 3.67-3.91 = 24bp, slightly tighter than outside view's 34bp due to January drift already realized. 1st-99th span = 3.54-4.04 = 50bp, allows for tail shocks (auction mishap, flash move, late payrolls surprise).

Probability calibration:

**Baseline scenario (60% probability):** DGS5 stays 3.75-3.85%. No major surprises; payrolls in-line, Fed speakers quiet, Treasury auctions smooth. Drift is minimal.

**Downside scenario (25% probability):** Weak payrolls (7 Feb) or dovish Fed Beige Book commentary pushes yields down 5-10bp → 3.68-3.75%. Labor market softness reinforces cut expectations.

**Upside scenario (15% probability):** Strong payrolls or Treasury supply disruption (e.g., weak 10-year auction 5 Feb) pushes yields up 5-12bp → 3.85-3.96%.

**Tail risks (<5% combined):** Flash crash, geopolitical shock (oil spike), or data error could push DGS5 below 3.60% or above 4.00%. Very low probability over 6 days.
