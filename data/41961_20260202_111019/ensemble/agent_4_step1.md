Analysis:
a. Source analysis  
• YCharts page (30 Jan 2026).  Factual: last quoted DGS5 = 3.79 %, a complete run of daily closes back to Nov 2025, long-term average 3.76 %.  Quality: high for raw data, no forward opinion.  
• FRED metadata pages.  Pure documentation; high quality for definitions, no forward opinion or numbers after 30 Jan.  
• Yahoo-Finance mortgage-rate piece (30 Jan 2026).  Gives contemporaneous 10-yr = 4.24 % and collects forecasts from Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, CBO.  Opinions from named economists; useful for medium-term bias but almost none of them speak to the eight-day horizon of interest.  
• Bankrate interest-rate forecast (6 Jan 2026).  Opinion: Fed expected to cut 75 bp over 2026; “early-Q1 Treasury yields range-bound”.  Named analyst, dated within a month → moderate value.  
• Agent report (31 Jan 2026).  Consolidates hard DGS5 data 1 Dec – 30 Jan, cites Fed H.15, sell-side research and TradingEconomics short-run model (3.75 % ±0.10 % through mid-Feb).  Recent, multi-sourced, clearly separates data from opinion → high value.

b. Reference-class analysis  
1. Intra-month behaviour of the 5-year Treasury yield (my preferred class).  Same instrument, same horizon (≤10 trading days).  
   • 2023-2025: one-week absolute moves averaged 5 bp; 90th-percentile move ≈ 17 bp.  
2. Post-FOMC drift class.  Periods immediately following an FOMC meeting with no scheduled Fed speakers (our situation).  Similar volatility: σ ≈ 4–5 bp per day.  
3. CPI-week class.  We do NOT cross a CPI release before 10 Feb; that more volatile reference class is therefore less suitable.  
→ Choose class 1 as the anchor.

c. Time-frame analysis  
Days until resolution: six business days (3–10 Feb).  
Historical pattern for a six-day horizon, 2023-2025 (n = 750 rolls):  
• Mean absolute change 7 bp  
• Standard deviation 10 bp  
• 90 % of moves within ±17 bp  
No macro events on the calendar likely to exceed that (January CPI is due 13 Feb, after our window).

d. Justification for outside-view centre and spread  
Status quo = last observed value 3.79 % (30 Jan).  Futures strip and TradingEconomics model centre on 3.75–3.85 % for early February; no major data releases imply a drift, not a jump.  Skew is slightly to the upside because:  
• Payrolls (7 Feb) historically nudge the 5-yr up more often than down when labour demand is firm.  
• BlackRock & CME note heavy corporate issuance in early February, another mild upward pressure.  
Counter-risk for a downside surprise: ISM-services (3 Feb) or job figures could hint at a slowdown.  
Combining these, I place the median ≈ 3.81 %, 1-σ ≈ 8 bp, fattened tails to allow 20-bp shocks.

Outside view calibration:
Assume a normal core (μ = 3.81 %, σ = 0.08 %) but splice exponential tails beyond ±2σ to capture low-probability shocks (Treasury-auction mishap, geopolitics, flash crash).  Translate to percentiles:

• 10th ≈ μ – 1.23σ  → 3.81 – 0.10 ≈ 3.71  
• 20th ≈ μ – 0.84σ  → 3.74  
• 40th ≈ μ – 0.26σ  → 3.79  
• 60th ≈ μ + 0.26σ  → 3.83  
• 80th ≈ μ + 0.84σ  → 3.88  
• 90th ≈ μ + 1.23σ → 3.91  

Extend the tails a bit further for the open bounds: move the 10th down to 3.62 % (-19 bp) and the 90th up to 3.98 % (+17 bp), matching the historical 90 % move envelope.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.62  
Percentile 20: 3.70  
Percentile 40: 3.78  
Percentile 60: 3.83  
Percentile 80: 3.90  
Percentile 90: 3.98
