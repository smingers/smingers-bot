Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Y-Charts quote for DGS5 (last obs = 3.79 percent on 2026-01-30).  Primary data, same series, up-to-date – high quality, factual.  
2. FRED series page (DGS5).  Definition and resolution rules only – high quality but no forward information.  
3. NY bond-market recap (Nikkei, 2026-01-30).  Factual 10-yr close 4.23 percent; opinion limited – moderate quality, useful for cross-maturity context.  
4. Morningstar “Data Talk” (2026-01-30).  Factual month-end 10- and 30-yr yields – moderate.  
5. Bankrate mortgage-rate outlook (2026-01-30).  Expert commentary that Fed is on hold until Q2 – opinion from named analysts – moderate evidence of near-term policy stability.  
6. Asknews deep-research note (2026-02-02).  Synthesises multiple reputable desks; repeats recent 3.75-3.85 range – moderate but not independent.  
7. Misc. non-US bond-market articles (Spanish, Indian, UAE, etc.).  Provide background on global supply but no direct near-term force on US 5-yr – weak for this horizon.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Latest DGS5 print 3.79 percent and January trading range 3.70-3.86 (direct, high-frequency, verifiable).  
• Fed held policy on 2026-01-28 and next FOMC is more than six weeks away – policy anchor is static.  

Moderate evidence  
• Consensus commentary (Bankrate, Morningstar) that Fed likely on hold through Q1, implying limited upside pressure.  
• Cross-maturity levels (10-yr 4.23) show curve still mildly upward-sloping, limiting extreme bull-flattening.  
• Typical 5-yr weekly yield volatility ≈ 10-12 bp; historical 95 % one-week envelope ≈ ±25 bp.  

Weak evidence  
• Foreign supply stories (declining foreign share) – structural, but impact unfolds slowly.  
• Overseas bond-supply spikes (India, Spain) – second-order for near-term US yields.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 8 calendar days / 6 trading days.  If horizon were halved, distribution would tighten by √½ (σ ≈ 8 bp); if doubled, σ ≈ 17 bp and tails widen proportionally.  Directional factors (policy, macro surprises) become more potent as horizon lengthens.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate: Centre on last print 3.79 with normal 6-day σ ≈ 12 bp.  
Shifters downward (prob ≈ 40 %): possible weak January payroll (due 2026-02-06), flight-to-quality from equity wobble, lingering disinflation narrative.  
Shifters upward (prob ≈ 30 %): upside payroll surprise, wage pop, strong ISM-services, or sudden rise in oil prices.  
No single dominant scheduled event; therefore retain mean essentially unchanged but allow symmetric ±25 bp 90 % range and slightly fatter upside tail (markets still wary of sticky inflation).  

Probability calibration  
• Mean ≈ 3.80; median 3.80.  
• Central 50 % band 3.65–3.83.  
• 90 % band 3.45–3.99 with residual tail mass to 4.25 / 3.30 at extremes.  

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: DGS5 daily yield for 2026-02-10, percent, not seasonally adjusted.  
2. Base rate: 3.79 percent (latest observation).  
3. Consistency: implied median = 3.80, mean≈3.80 – consistent with “little net move” thesis.  
4. Key evidence: (i) last yield 3.79; (ii) Jan range 3.70-3.86; (iii) Fed on hold until late-March; (iv) 1-week σ ≈ 12 bp; (v) February payroll risk.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden geopolitical shock spiking oil, CPI expectations; would push yield above 4.15.
