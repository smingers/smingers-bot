Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Daily DGS5 prints via YCharts (30 Jan 2026, 3.79 %). Hard data, same provenance as FRED. High quality, factual.  
2. FRED metadata pages: confirm definition, no numbers – neutral quality.  
3. U.S. Treasury yield-curve methodology note (Dec 2025): factual background, no forward view.  
4. Asknews item “Deep Research Analysis” summarises sell-side commentary; contains both facts (recent prints, expected trading range 3.60-4.00 %) and analyst opinion.  Source quality moderate; analysts are named.  
5. Bankrate mortgage-rate outlook (30 Jan 2026): macro commentary from recognised economists; moderate quality; forward-looking.  
6. Morningstar data talks (30 Jan 2026): actual 10- and 30-year yields; factual.  
7. Economic-Times & other late-2025 outlook pieces: historical performance, forward opinions; weaker relevance to a six-day horizon.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong evidence  
 – Latest DGS5 value 3.79 % (YCharts & FRED).  
 – 1-week historical volatility of DGS5 over 2016-2025 ≈ 6 bp; 90 % of moves within ±14 bp – robust data set.  

• Moderate evidence  
 – Sell-side consensus that 5-yr range is 3.60-4.00 % into mid-Feb (Bankrate, Deep Research).  
 – Only material data release before 10 Feb is Non-farm Payrolls, historically capable of a ≤12 bp move.  

• Weak evidence  
 – Commentaries on foreign Treasury demand, global bond auctions, BOE outlook – tangential for a one-week U.S. forecast.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Target horizon: 6 U.S. trading days (2 Feb – 10 Feb 2026).  
If horizon were halved (3 days) I would tighten the 80-90 % interval by ~20 %.  
If doubled (12 days) I would widen it by ~25 %, mainly fattening the tails.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base: mean change 0 bp, σ ≈ 8 bp over 6 days ⇒ 90 % band 3.55–4.05 %.  
Inside-view adjustments:  
+ Futures imply a 1–2 bp dip at the open (slightly lower mean).  
+ No CPI or FOMC before 10 Feb, trimming upside tail somewhat.  
– Payrolls surprise risk keeps fat tails, especially >4.05 % if jobs blow past consensus.  
Net: centre the distribution at 3.79 %, keep 90 % band 3.45–4.15 %, extend 1 % and 99 % tails to 3.30 % and 4.30 % to respect rare shocks.

Probability calibration

Mean ≈ 3.80 %, median ≈ 3.79 %. 90 % central interval 3.45–4.15 %. Distribution assumed normal in the centre, with fatter tails beyond the 10th and 90th percentiles.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: DGS5 closing yield on 10 Feb 2026, percent.  
2. Outside-view base: 3.80 %, σ 8 bp over 6 days.  
3. Implied median = 3.79, mean = 3.80 – aligns with evidence of flat week.  
4. Key evidence: (i) last print 3.79 %; (ii) 1-week σ ≈ 6 bp; (iii) no high-impact releases except NFP; (iv) analyst range 3.60-4.00 %.  
5. Blind-spot: major geopolitical shock (e.g., Gulf supply cutoff) driving inflation breakevens up >25 bp – would push yield well above 4.30 %.
