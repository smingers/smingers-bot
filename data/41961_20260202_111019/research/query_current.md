Analysis:
The 5-year Treasury yield (DGS5) will depend mainly on near-term macro news between now (2026-02-02) and the target date (2026-02-10). Key drivers to monitor over the next eight calendar days are:  
• Market interpretation of last week’s FOMC statement and Chair Powell’s press conference (the Committee kept rates steady but signaled it is in no hurry to cut). Yields initially fell, then rebounded as traders reassessed the timing of the first cut.  
• January employment report (to be released 2026-02-06). A strong payrolls print would likely push yields higher; a weak report would do the reverse.  
• January CPI (due 2026-02-13) comes after our resolution date and therefore is not directly relevant, but any early leaks or positioning ahead of the print could still affect yields.  
• Treasury quarterly refunding details (announced yesterday, 2026-02-01) showed only a modest increase in auction sizes; this slightly eases upward supply pressure on yields.  
• Risk sentiment: Equities are near record highs; a risk-off episode would bring flows into Treasuries and lower the 5-year yield.  
The last published DGS5 observation (2026-01-29) was 3.80 %. Since then intraday 5-year notes have traded around 3.83 – 3.87 % (futures-implied). Short-term interest-rate futures currently price the first 25 bp Fed cut for the May 2026 meeting, a slight push-out versus a week ago—mildly supportive of higher yields.

Therefore, the most relevant current information will be:
1. Real-time commentary on how markets digest the upcoming January jobs report and any speeches by Fed officials this week.  
2. Post-FOMC analyses that explain why the market postponed the expected first rate cut.  
3. Coverage of Treasury auction demand for the 3-year (Feb 5) and 10-year (Feb 6) notes, which often spill over to the 5-year sector.
