Analysis:
The DGS5 series is updated each business day based on the Treasury’s interpolated yield curve. To form an outside view of the February 10 2026 value we need:  
• The recent level and volatility of the 5-year yield (e.g., the range since late-2025 and any clear trend).  
• Macroeconomic drivers—principally the stance of monetary policy (Fed funds rate expectations, quantitative tightening), inflation data, and risk sentiment—that historically move intermediate-term Treasury yields.  
• Event calendar between now (Feb 2 2026) and the target date: there is no FOMC meeting, CPI release, or major Treasury refunding scheduled after the Jan 30 employment report until Feb 13 CPI. That reduces the likelihood of a sharp jump, suggesting persistence of the current ~3.8 % level unless an exogenous shock occurs.  
• Historical precedents: in similar “pause” periods during 2018-19 and 2023-24 the 5-year yield typically drifted less than ±15 bp over eight trading days. Combining that with the present value places a one-standard-deviation band roughly 3.65 %–3.95 %.  
Gathering exact recent data points (daily closes), market commentary, and any published forecasts will sharpen the distribution we later need to submit.
