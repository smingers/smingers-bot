However, this perception is based on a misunderstanding. While the percentage share has declined, the absolute amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by foreign entities increased from $6.8 trillion in December 2019 to $9.4 trillion by November 2025\u2014a rise of $2.6 trillion (38.2%). The decline in share is due to a faster increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, which totaled $9.9 trillion over the same period, driven by pandemic-related fiscal stimulus and rising debt service costs. As a result, the growing supply of U.S. debt has put downward pressure on bond prices and upward pressure on market interest rates, making supply dynamics more influential than interest rate policy in determining market yields. The article concludes that monitoring the scale and maturity structure of new bond issuance is now as critical as central bank rate decisions.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:18 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/1242950.html)\n\n**Budget impact: Indian government bond yields hit highest in one year. How can it affect stock market | Stock Market News**\nOn February 2, 2026, Indian government bond yields rose by 8 basis points (bps) following the government's announcement of higher-than-expected gross borrowing, with the 10-year benchmark bond yield reaching 6.78%, the highest since January 17, 2025. The yield had started at 6.740% and closed at 6.778%, up from 6.696% the previous day. The Union Budget for FY27 estimates gross market borrowings at \u20b917.2 lakh crore, a 16% increase from the current year\u2019s budget estimate, with net market borrowing projected at \u20b911.7 lakh crore to cover a fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP. According to Nomura Holdings Inc. and ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, yields could rise to 7% in the coming weeks. Despite Reserve Bank of India (RBI) market intervention, yields have increased due to high state government bond issuance and declining demand from pension and insurance funds. Alok Sharma, treasury chief at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Mumbai, stated in a Bloomberg report that the central bank must increase bond purchases to enhance liquidity and stabilize yields, warning that 'proactive management of liquidity will be necessary, or yields will only continue to rise.' The rising borrowing costs add pressure on an economy already facing significant US tariffs and constrained by limited scope for further interest rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:56 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/bonds/budget-impact-indian-government-bond-yields-hit-highest-in-one-year-how-can-it-affect-stock-market-11770006704588.html)\n\n**India's 10-yr bond yields jump to 1-yr high after record borrowing plan**\nIndia's 10-year government bond yields rose to 6.78%, the highest since January 17, 2025, following the Union Budget 2026 announcement of a record \u20b917.2 trillion gross market borrowing for FY27\u201418% higher than the current year and exceeding the \u20b916.5 trillion Bloomberg forecast. The yield jump marked the steepest intraday gain since August 29, 2025, and pushed year-to-date yields up by 2.63%. Analysts including Venkatesh Balasubramaniam of JM Financial Institutional Securities and Rajeev Radhakrishnan of SBI Mutual Fund attributed the market reaction to the elevated borrowing plan, lack of specific demand-stimulating measures, and increased derivatives transaction taxes, which are expected to weigh on bond yields in the near term. UBS Global Research\u2019s Tanvee Gupta Jain noted that state borrowing has also risen 18% year-on-year, accounting for around 40% of total sovereign issuance in FY2026, with rising average maturity adding upward pressure on yields. While long-term fiscal consolidation and declining debt-to-GDP ratios are positive, near-term yield stability will depend on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) open market operations, which remain a challenge. Market participants anticipate bond losses, and the unexpected supply surge has heightened discomfort in absorbing elevated borrowing levels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:09 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/india-s-10-yr-bond-yields-jump-to-1-yr-high-after-record-borrowing-plan-126020200170_1.html)\n\n**Ofi Invest AM: On the Bond Market, It's Better to Stay Cautious**\nIn 2025, global bond markets delivered strong returns, with the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index rising above 8%, driven primarily by macroeconomic data such as growth, inflation, unemployment, and monetary policy. U.S. bonds outperformed European bonds, partly due to the euro's 12% depreciation against the dollar. Despite this rally, Ofi Invest AM advises caution for 2026, noting that major central banks have signaled their monetary policy intentions: the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain interest rates near 2% for the next 12 months, the U.S. Federal Reserve is projected to make no more than two additional rate cuts\u2014bringing rates to a neutral range of 3%-3.5%\u2014and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may implement temporary rate hikes. Ofi Invest AM maintains a neutral stance on 10-year bonds, expecting yields to remain within a range of 2.60% to 3.10% for German Bunds, with adjustments to duration based on market conditions. The firm highlights ongoing risks from fiscal and geopolitical factors, especially given heightened tensions following a second Trump presidency, which were downplayed in 2025 but could grow in 2026. Additional risks include Germany\u2019s high bond issuance, the Netherlands\u2019 new pension reform, and potential upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. Despite an overall reduction in market risks\u2014due to central bank vigilance, the end of peak tariffs, and strong corporate refinancing\u2014Ofi Invest AM remains cautious, advocating for selectivity in credit exposure, a positive outlook on high-yield bonds in the medium term, but caution on potential spread widening in adverse scenarios.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:08 PM\nSource:[Borsa italiana](https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/notizie/radiocor/finanza/dettaglio/ofi-invest-am-sul-mercato-obbligazionario-e--meglio-rimanere-prudenti-parola-al-mercato-nRC_01022026_1429_315493149.html)\n\n**Spanish Treasury Resumes Auctions with February 2026 Debt Issuance Plan**\nThe Spanish Treasury (Tesoro P\u00fablico) is resuming its auction schedule, holding two auctions on February 3 and February 5, 2026.

This marks the first issuance of the year under the 2026 Sukuk and Bond programs, published on the Ministry\u2019s official website. The new bond tranche is the first since March 2023, supporting the development of the yield curve and enhancing the depth of the secondary market. The auctions attracted strong investor demand, with total bids amounting to 5.15 billion dirhams\u20144.7 times the issuance size\u2014reflecting high investor confidence in the country\u2019s financial sector and national economic resilience. Competitive market-based pricing was achieved, with a Yield to Maturity (YTM) of 3.66% for Sukuk and 3.90% for Bonds, only 9 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury yields at the time. Both tranches will be listed on Nasdaq Dubai, improving accessibility in the secondary market. The cumulative outstanding balance of the programs now stands at 28 billion dirhams across maturities from two to five years. The programs continue to strengthen the UAE dirham yield curve, provide safe investment alternatives, enhance local debt capital market competitiveness, support investment environment development, and contribute to sustainable economic growth.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:00 AM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/arabic/story/2128726.html)\n\n**Current bond yields are attractive for investors: How to make the most of them? | Stock Market News**\nHarsimran Singh Sahni, Executive Vice President and Treasury Head at Anand Rathi Global Finance, states that the current bond yield environment presents an attractive opportunity for debt mutual fund investors, particularly at the shorter end of the yield curve\u2014maturities of 1 to 2 years.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, with a coupon rate of 4.000%, closed unchanged at 4.23%, matching the previous day\u2019s level. The market was pressured by selling in long-term bonds following the announcement of the Federal Reserve (FRB)\u2019s next chair nominee.

As of January 14, 2026, the 10-year yield was trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025, the lowest level in three years. This reflects a continued shift from the elevated market premium seen during 2022\u20132024, signaling a reversal of the sharp rise in the premium. Historically, the yield\u2019s valuation cycle tends to revert toward zero (neutral), suggesting that the current slight premium implies a neutral stance on maturity risk for bond market strategies. In contrast, a higher allocation to maturity risk was recommended in late 2023 when the market premium peaked above 120 basis points. Since then, the 10-year yield has declined and the bond market has rallied.

These factors boosted bond prices and kept credit risks low, resulting in broad bond indices posting over 7% total returns in 2025 \u2014 the best performance since 2020. The Morningstar US Core Bond Total Return Index gained more than 7%, while investment-grade bonds delivered nearly 8% returns, supported by credit spreads near multi-decade lows (around 80 basis points). However, expectations for 2026 are more muted: traders are pricing in only about 60 basis points of rate cuts, slower than in 2025. Fiscal stimulus measures, including potential tax and spending initiatives, could support growth and keep longer-term yields elevated. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell by over 40 basis points in 2025 to around 4.1%, but major banks forecast they will end 2026 at or slightly above current levels. A divergence may emerge, with shorter-maturity yields declining further while longer-term yields could rise due to stronger growth or higher government debt, pressuring long-duration bond returns. Asset managers are becoming cautious on duration, favoring shorter-dated securities. Credit spreads may widen in 2026 due to increased corporate borrowing, especially from large tech firms, potentially reducing returns for investment-grade and high-yield bonds. While some analysts expect a stronger bond rally if inflation eases and growth slows, requiring aggressive Fed cuts, the overall outlook points to steadier, harder-earned returns compared to the exceptional gains of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-bond-market-faces-a-more-challenging-road-ahead-in-2026/articleshow/126264115.cms)\n\n**10-Year Treasury ETF (511260) Sees Over 1 Billion Yuan Net Inflows in 20 Days, Capitalizing on Bond Market Trading Opportunities**\nThe 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) has seen net inflows exceeding 1 billion yuan over the past 20 days, positioning investors to capture short-term trading opportunities in the bond market. According to Xiangcai Securities, the Chinese bond market is expected to remain in a volatile state in 2025. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s 2025 rate cuts have narrowed the U.S.-China interest rate differential, China\u2019s monetary policy remains focused on domestic conditions, with interest rates already at historically low levels and limited room for further declines. The domestic economic fundamentals are unlikely to improve significantly in the short term, leading to a forecast that the 10-year Treasury yield will remain in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2026. With the 1-year deposit rate around 1%, further rate cuts are constrained, while increased government bond supply and earlier issuance are expected to alleviate the 'asset shortage' situation. As a result, a sustained bull market in bonds in 2026 is unlikely, prompting a strategic shift from 'buy and hold' to tactical trading to exploit short-term market disruptions. The 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) tracks the SSE 10-year Treasury Index, selecting government bonds with 7 to 10 years remaining maturity listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, maintaining a constant duration. Since its inception, the ETF has consistently achieved new net asset value highs, with strong historical performance: a 4.17% return over the past year, 14.04% over three years, 23.39% over five years, and a cumulative return of 35.77% since launch. Notably, the ETF has posted positive annual returns across all seven full calendar years since its 2017 inception, making it a potential tool for long-term asset allocation. Risk disclosures state that historical performance is not indicative of future results, and investors should review fund documents to understand risk profiles and suitability. The ETF\u2019s performance data from 2017 to 2025H1 shows mixed results relative to its benchmark, with returns ranging from -1.55% to 9.02% and benchmark returns from -1.01% to 8.09%.

Bond prices rose, with the 10-year yield declining by 4 basis points for the week\u2014its first weekly gain since late November\u2014and the 2-year yield dropping similarly, reflecting increased optimism about Fed rate cuts in 2026. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index had risen over 7% by December 18, 2025, the strongest performance since 2020, surpassing 2024\u2019s 1.25% and 2023\u2019s 5.5%. SCFR\u2019s fixed income research and strategy head Martin stated, 'This year is a strong year because both yield and price are rising.' He explained that higher yields in late 2024 and early 2025, due to concerns over tariffs and immigration policies, boosted income, while the Fed\u2019s restart of its rate-cutting cycle pushed yields down and lifted bond prices. Inflation has remained stable, allowing the Fed to shift focus to labor market weakness; the Fed has cut rates three times in 2025, each by 25 basis points. The U.S. unemployment rate reached its highest level in four years, and core inflation year-over-year dropped to its lowest since early 2021, reinforcing market confidence in further rate cuts. Futures pricing indicates traders expect two more cuts in the next year, with a 40% chance of three. However, two factors suggest a more cautious outlook for 2026: first, uncertainty about the magnitude of further Fed rate cuts; second, bond prices have already risen significantly in 2025, meaning future purchase prices may be less attractive. TD Securities\u2019 U.S. interest rate strategist Godeber noted, 'Lack of data visibility keeps investors uneasy, but as long as labor market concerns persist, we believe rates will continue to fall.' SCFR\u2019s Martin added, 'We think next year will still be good, but we\u2019re unsure if returns will be as high as this year.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/9216171)\n\n**U.S. 5-Year Note Auction: Yield Falls to 3.56... | Forex News...**\nThe U.S. 5-year note auction concluded on November 25, 2025, with a yield of 3.562%, a slight decrease from the previous yield of 3.625%. According to InstaForex, the decline reflects strong investor demand for U.S. government securities, likely driven by global economic uncertainties and a preference for the safety of U.S. assets. The modest yield drop suggests investors are adjusting expectations for future inflation and interest rates as the Federal Reserve manages monetary policy amid a mixed economic recovery.

Geopolitical oil shocks (e.g., U.S.-Iran tensions) that could temporarily lift inflation expectations and yields ([2][4][6]).  \n2. Policy uncertainty from Kevin Warsh's nomination as next Fed Chair, though recent signals suggest he supports rate cuts ([6][7]).  \n\nTechnical indicators point to contained yield movements (10-year benchmark range: 3.95%-4.20% [8]), with the 5-year likely mirroring this stability amid curve steepening ([7]). The January jobs report ([4][9]) remains the dominant catalyst, overwhelming other factors in the short term.  \n\n**Acknowledged uncertainties**: Warsh's Senate confirmation could alter market perceptions ([6]), and tariff/immigration policies may further suppress labor growth ([9]).
