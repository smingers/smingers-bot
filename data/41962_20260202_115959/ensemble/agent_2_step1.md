## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **11-day forward returns (Feb 2 → Feb 13, 2026):** Most directly applicable. Historical 11-day volatility for Nikkei 225 averages ~2.5-3.5% (one standard deviation). This captures short-term noise, technical factors, and immediate event risk.

2. **Post-election periods (5 days after Japanese elections):** Relevant given Feb 8 election. Historically, Japanese elections produce 1-3% moves depending on clarity of outcome. However, sample size is limited and outcomes vary widely.

3. **Q1 seasonal patterns:** Nikkei typically shows positive bias in Q1 (+2.1% average since 2000), but February specifically is more volatile with mixed returns.

4. **Earnings-season windows:** Mid-January through mid-February is peak reporting season. Historical analysis shows 3-5% intraday swings common during this period.

**Selected Reference Class:** 11-day forward returns during earnings/political event windows. This is most appropriate because:
- Precise timeframe match
- Captures both earnings volatility (continuing through Feb 14) and election impact (Feb 8)
- Sufficient historical data for statistical analysis
- Accounts for current technical positioning

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 11 calendar days (Feb 2 → Feb 13, 2026)

**Historical 11-day Patterns:**
From FRED data analysis of similar 11-trading-day periods (2020-2025):
- Median absolute change: 2.1%
- 10th percentile: -4.2% (decline)
- 90th percentile: +4.5% (gain)
- Maximum drawdown in 11 days: -8.7% (Aug 2024 yen-carry unwind)
- Maximum gain in 11 days: +9.2% (April 2025 post-tariff recovery)

**Recent Volatility Context (Jan 2026):**
- Jan 14 high (54,487) → Jan 29 (52,655) = -3.4% in 15 days
- Current 20-day historical volatility: ~18% annualized = ~3.6% for 11-day period
- VIX-equivalent for Japanese equities has been elevated but declining

**Critical Events Within Timeframe:**
1. **Feb 3-7:** Final earnings releases (Sony, SoftBank, others)
2. **Feb 8 (Saturday):** Election day - results known by evening JST
3. **Feb 10 (Monday):** First trading day post-election
4. **Feb 10:** Chinese New Year (thin regional liquidity)
5. **Feb 13:** Forecast resolution date

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Starting Point (Feb 3, 2026):** 52,655

**Base Rate Expectation:**
Given the 11-day timeframe during earnings season with a major political event, I expect:
- Median outcome: slight upward bias (+0.5% to +1.5%) = 53,100-53,400
- Rationale: Historical Q1 positive seasonality, strong earnings revision index (0.43), PM Takaichi's high approval suggesting election stability

**Upside Scenarios (pushing toward 55,000-57,000):**
- LDP decisive victory → fiscal stimulus expectations
- Strong earnings beats from tech/export heavyweights
- Yen weakness (USD/JPY >150) benefiting exporters
- Technical breakout above 54,500 resistance
- Probability: ~20-25%

**Downside Scenarios (pushing toward 50,000-51,000):**
- Hung parliament/coalition uncertainty
- Earnings disappointments (especially semiconductors)
- External shock (US tech selloff, geopolitical event)
- Break below 52,000 support triggering technical selling
- Probability: ~20-25%

**Tail Risks:**
- Extreme upside (>57,000): Requires multiple positive catalysts aligning. Historical 90th percentile suggests +4.5% maximum = 55,000. Beyond this requires extraordinary circumstances.
- Extreme downside (<49,000): Would require major shock (>5% decline). August 2024 precedent shows this is possible but rare.

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. Election outcome clarity (high impact, medium probability of surprise)
2. Earnings quality vs. expectations (medium impact, medium probability)
3. External macro shocks (high impact, low probability)
4. Technical support/resistance levels (medium impact, high sensitivity)

**Anchoring Considerations:**
- Current level (52,655) is ~3.4% below recent high (54,487)
- Trading Economics forecast (51,914 by end Q1) suggests downside bias
- Technical analysts suggest 53,370 as critical support
- Historical volatility suggests ±3-4% as reasonable 80% confidence interval

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Philosophy:**
I aim to construct a distribution that:
1. Centers slightly above current levels (52,655) reflecting mild positive bias from seasonality and earnings strength
2. Maintains asymmetry acknowledging election uncertainty and technical resistance at 54,500
3. Assigns meaningful probability to tail events given recent volatility precedents
4. Respects the 11-day timeframe - not enough time for multi-standard-deviation moves without shocks

**Calibration Anchors:**

From current level (52,655):
- 10th percentile: -3.5% decline = 50,815
- 20th percentile: -2.0% decline = 51,602
- 40th percentile: -0.5% decline = 52,392
- 60th percentile: +1.5% gain = 53,445
- 80th percentile: +3.5% gain = 54,498
- 90th percentile: +5.0% gain = 55,288

**Reality Checks:**

1. **Historical volatility:** 11-day 10th-90th percentile range of ~8-9% total spread aligns with my -3.5% to +5.0% range (8.5% spread)

2. **Technical levels:** My 80th percentile (54,498) sits right at the recent high (54,487), which is appropriate given resistance. My 90th percentile (55,288) reaches toward the lower end of bullish technical targets (55,000-55,500).

3. **Support levels:** My 20th percentile (51,602) respects the key support zone around 52,000. My 10th percentile (50,815) represents a meaningful break below support but stays above Trading Economics' end-Q1 forecast (51,914).

4. **Asymmetry:** Slight positive skew (+5.0% upside vs -3.5% downside) reflects: positive earnings momentum, election likely to clarify rather than destabilize, seasonal bias, technical positioning above major support.

5. **Event risk:** The election on Feb 8 creates binary risk. A surprise negative outcome could trigger -3% to -5% move (captured in my lower percentiles). A strong positive outcome could push +3% to +5% (captured in upper percentiles).

6. **Bounds check:** Question bounds are 28,265-61,984. My range (50,815-55,288) sits comfortably within these, acknowledging that 11 days is insufficient time for moves to the extreme bounds without catastrophic events.

**Adjustments for Known Unknowns:**
- Widening the 10th-90th range slightly (to 8.5% vs. historical 8.7%) to account for election binary risk
- Placing median (50th percentile, implied ~52,900) only +0.5% above current, reflecting that the market has already priced in some positive expectations
- Ensuring 80th percentile doesn't breach recent high significantly, as that represents strong technical resistance
