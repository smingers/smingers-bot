## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large shifts warranted):**
- **BoJ hawkish pivot**: Multiple sources confirm Summary of Opinions signaled "timely hikes," with 48% market pricing for Feb hike. Mechanism: higher rates → capital rotation from equities to bonds (10Y JGB at 2.32% decade-high). Historical: 2000s BoJ tightening cycles correlated with Nikkei underperformance.
- **Current momentum reversal**: Nikkei fell 1.25% on 2 Feb after hitting 54,487 all-time high on 14 Jan. Intraday +924 yen rally fully reversed, indicating fragile sentiment. Technical: below 54,000 for first time in 3 weeks.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Election volatility (8 Feb)**: Snap election in 6 days. Historical: Japanese elections typically ±1.5-3% single-day moves, but Takaichi's fiscal plans (if coalition strengthens) may widen fiscal deficit → higher yields → equity pressure. Uncertainty cuts both ways.
- **Yen weakness tailwind**: USD/JPY at 155 (vs 153.8 week prior) benefits exporters. However, BoJ explicitly cited yen weakness as inflation risk, suggesting policy will counteract this support.
- **Sector rotation**: Semiconductor stocks (high Nikkei weight) down 4-14% on 2 Feb due to AI investment concerns. If sustained, drags index; if reverses, lifts.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Trading Economics model**: 12-month target 45,234 (-15% from current). Simple econometric; doesn't incorporate election or BoJ pivot timing. Directionally bearish but magnitude unreliable.
- **Technical levels**: IG notes 52,637-52,524 support. Useful for trader positioning but not fundamental driver.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Horizon**: 11 calendar days = 8 trading sessions (3-5 Feb, 9-13 Feb; 11 Feb holiday).

**Key events in window**:
- 8 Feb: Election results (hard constraint). If LDP coalition expands, fiscal stimulus expectations rise → yields up, equities mixed. If loses seats, policy uncertainty → volatility spike.
- No scheduled BoJ meeting, but Summary of Opinions (2 Feb) already shifted expectations.

**If timeframe halved (4 days/3 sessions)**:
- Prediction would tighten around 52,655 (current level) with ±2-3% range, as election hasn't occurred yet. Lower tail risk (no time for cascading selloff).

**If timeframe doubled (22 days/16 sessions)**:
- Would incorporate post-election policy clarity and potential BoJ March meeting speculation. Wider distribution (±8-10%) due to compounding volatility and possible secondary shocks (earnings, global macro).

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view recap**: Normal distribution centered on 53,250, σ=4% over 8 sessions → 10th-90th range 49,800-56,500.

**Inside view adjustments**:

1. **Downward shift (-1 to -2%)**:
   - BoJ hawkish pivot is **structural**, not transient. Unlike 2010-2025 reference class (mostly accommodative), current regime tightening with 2-3 hikes priced for 2026. This is analogous to 2006-07 (BoJ hiked from 0% to 0.5%), when Nikkei underperformed by ~5% over 6 months.
   - Bond yields at decade-high create persistent headwind. 10Y JGB at 2.32% makes equities less attractive on relative basis.
   - **Justification**: Shift median from 53,250 to 52,500 (-1.4%). This acknowledges momentum break but avoids overreaction, as election could stabilize sentiment.

2. **Tail risk asymmetry**:
   - **Downside tail fatter**: Election uncertainty + BoJ surprise hike (48% priced) could trigger -5 to -8% move. Precedent: Jan 2016 BoJ negative rate surprise → Nikkei -11% over 2 weeks.
   - **Upside tail capped**: Even if election boosts sentiment, BoJ tightening caps rally. Unlikely to reclaim 54,487 high without policy reversal.
   - **Adjustment**: Widen lower percentiles (1st-20th) by 1-2%, narrow upper percentiles (80th-99th) by 1%.

3. **Election binary outcome**:
   - Base case (60% prob): LDP coalition maintains/expands → modest +1-2% relief rally, then fade on fiscal concerns.
   - Bear case (30% prob): Coalition weakens → -3 to -5% on policy paralysis fears.
   - Bull case (10% prob): Overwhelming mandate + BoJ delays hike → +4-6% rally.
   - **Net effect**: Slight downward skew, but not dramatic given offsetting scenarios.

**Validation check**: Is current regime sufficiently different from 2010-2025 reference class?
- **Yes, moderately**. 2010-2025 had one tightening episode (2006-07), but most years were zero-rate. Current BoJ at 0.75% with explicit hiking bias is closer to 2006-07 than 2013-2025 Abenomics era. However, 8-day horizon limits compounding effect, so shift is modest (-1 to -2%), not extreme (-10%).

## Probability Calibration

**Anchoring adjustments**:
- Start: 53,250 (2 Feb close, but intraday showed 52,655 actual close per AskNews - using 52,655 as true anchor).
- Median target: 52,500 (-0.3% from 52,655, reflecting slight bearish bias from BoJ/yields).
- σ adjustment: Increase from 4% to 4.5% due to election binary event (8 Feb).

**Percentile construction**:
- Use log-normal with μ = -0.3%, σ = 4.5% over 8 sessions.
- Manually adjust tails:
  - Lower tail (1st-10th): Add 0.5-1% downside buffer for BoJ surprise/election shock.
  - Upper tail (90th-99th): Cap at 56,000-57,500 (below 54,487 high) given yield headwind.

**Cross-checks**:
- 10th-90th range: 48,500-56,000 (vs outside view 49,800-56,500). Slightly wider due to election.
- Median 52,500 implies -0.3% return, consistent with "muddle through" scenario.
- Mean ≈ 52,600 (slightly above median due to right-skew from possible election rally).

Checklist:
1. **Target**: Nikkei 225 closing value on 13 Feb 2026 (11 days, 8 sessions ahead).
2. **Base rate**: Outside view 53,250 ±4% (10th-90th: 49,800-56,500). Inside view shifts median to 52,500 due to BoJ hawkish pivot and bond yield headwind.
3. **Consistency**: Implied median 52,500 (-0.3%), mean 52,600. Reasonable given bearish BoJ offset by election uncertainty.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) BoJ Summary 2 Feb signaled "timely hikes," 48% Feb hike priced; (2) 10Y JGB 2.32% decade-high; (3) Election 8 Feb binary risk; (4) Nikkei reversed +924 intraday gain on 2 Feb; (5) Semiconductor sector down 4-14%.
5. **Blind-spot**: Election delivers overwhelming LDP mandate AND BoJ delays March hike → rally to 55,000-56,000 (upside miss). Alternatively, BoJ surprise Feb hike + weak election → crash to 49,000-50,000 (downside miss).
