Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. TradingView snapshot (29 Jan 2026) – Factual: spot price 52 655, recent high 54 487, +33 % y/y.  Opinions: several anonymous technicians; low weight because authorship is unclear.  Timeliness good (4 days old).  
2. TradingEconomics note (2 Feb 2026) – Factual: close 53 250, sector moves, TE model pointing to 51 914 this quarter and 45 234 in 12 m.  TE macro model is transparent but simple; still useful for direction.  
3. Investing.com “historical-data” page – only legal boiler-plate; discarded.  
4. Investing.com Yearly Technical Outlook (late-2025) – Factual: 2025 rally size, BoJ tightening path.  Opinions/targets (55–62 k) from unnamed “models”; medium weight, mostly long-term.  
5. Marketpulse 2026 stock indices outlook (Dec 2025) – Factual: 2025 performance figures, Fed trajectory.  Opinion: Nikkei poised to outperform; author not specified; medium quality.  
6. Marketpulse short-term Nikkei forecast (late-Jan 2026, Kelvin Wong) – Factual: YTD +7.9 %, key support 53 370.  Opinion: bullish if above 53 370; analyst identifiable, short horizon, hence moderate weight.  
7. Agent report (compiled 2 Feb 2026) – Factual: FRED daily closes, precise BoJ timeline, election date (8 Feb), earnings calendar.  High quality because items are all verifiable; no unsupported opinions.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
i. Same-index 8-trading-day returns 2010-2025.  Mean ≈ 0 %, σ ≈ 3 % (close-to-close, log returns).  
ii. Large-cap developed-market indices over similar windows.  Similar volatility; no reason to switch.  
iii. Election-week windows in Japan.  Too few points.  
I choose (i) – historical 8-day Nikkei changes – as the main class.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 11 calendar days = 8 Tokyo trading sessions (3 – 5 Feb, 9 – 13 Feb; 11 Feb is a holiday).  
During 2010-2025 the middle 80 % of 8-day percentage moves lies roughly between –6 % and +6 %. Extreme ±10 % moves occur about 3 % of the time. Daily realised volatility the past month is 1.2  %; applying √8 gives 3.4 %.  

d) Justification for outside-view prediction  
• Base level 53 250 (2 Feb close).  
• No scheduled BoJ meeting before 13 Feb, reducing macro policy risk.  
• Snap lower-house election on 8 Feb could add one 1-day move of ±1.5 % but—historically—Japanese elections seldom trigger moves larger than ±3 %.  
• About 30 % of TOPIX market cap reports earnings in the window; single-stock shocks tend to be diluted in the price-weighted Nikkei.  
• Global macro events (FOMC just passed, Chinese New Year liquidity) are typical and already embedded in the 2010-2025 distribution.  
Therefore I start with a normal-ish distribution centred on 53 250, σ ≈ 3.4 %.  To reflect fat tails I increase σ to 4 % and clip tails to deliver ~3 % probability below –10 % or above +10 %.  This yields the percentile band below.

Outside view calibration:
Anchoring: current close 53 250.  
Assumed log-normal approximation with μ = 0.0 %, σ = 4 % over eight sessions.  
Converted back to index points and manually widened tails by ~½ % to acknowledge earthquake / geopolitical jump risk.  
Checks:  
• 10th–90th range is –6.5 % / +6.1 %, matching empirical 80 % band history.  
• Values stay within the question’s open bounds (28 265 – 61 983).  
• Strictly increasing percentiles verified.
