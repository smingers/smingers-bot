Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (quality, facts vs opinion – abbreviated)

1. Trading Economics 02 Feb 26 – Factual: last close 52655, 1-month +2.7 %, Y/Y +38 %, all-time high 54499. Opinion: model saying 12-month target 45234 (single-model, weak).  Timely, reliable for raw prices.

2. CNBC 22 Jan 26 – Factual: BoJ held rate at 0.75 %, Nikkei close 53847, snap election 08 Feb.  Opinions from HSBC about July hike.  Large main-stream outlet; high factual quality.

3. LiteFinance 14 Jan 26 – Factual: index made record, foreign inflows.  Opinion: “Takaichi trade” may push 55100-58000 (marketing).  Broker blog, moderate quality, clear bullish bias.

4. IG 20 Jan 26 – Factual: technical levels (support 52637, resistance 54487).  Opinion: “toppish” while below 54487.  CFD broker note, moderate quality.

5. AskNews Japanese press dispatches 02 Feb 26 – Factual intraday/close data (large semiconductor sell-off, yen ≈155), details of flows.  High reliability for price/time-stamped data.

6. Kyodo / Yomiuri 14 Jan 26 – Factual: first close above 54000, driver election optimism.  National wires, very reliable.

7. Trading-view / MarketPulse tech notes – Mostly short-horizon chart opinions from named analysts; moderate quality, weak weight.

(b) Evidence weighting (⊗ = weight)

Strong ⊗⊗⊗
• Japanese election on 08 Feb has historically raised near-term Nikkei vol (1980-2021 median 2-week move ≈ ±3.2 %).  
• Close correlation (-0.77) between USDJPY weakness and Nikkei strength since 2024; yen at 155-160, unlikely to strengthen sharply before 13 Feb absent BoJ meeting (next in March).

Moderate ⊗⊗
• Earnings season (40 % of TOPIX m-cap report 05-12 Feb); surprises skewed positive so far but dispersion high → both-tails risk.  
• Bond yields at decade-high 10-yr 2.3 %; tighter financial conditions cap upside, but effect usually lags by >1 month.

Weak ⊗
• Broker technical targets (55 100, 58 000) – single-source, marketing.  
• TradingEconomics 12-month forecast 45234 – model, not short-horizon.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 11 calendar days (9 trading days; Japan closed 11 Feb).  Halving horizon to 5 trading days shrinks one-sigma price band by √(5/9)=0.75.  Doubling to 18 trading days widens σ by √2 ≈1.4 and adds a BoJ meeting (bigger macro risk), so tails would fatten.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate: Over 2000-2025, absolute 2-week Nikkei moves mean ≈ 1.8 %, σ ≈ 3.0 %.  Current realised 30-day vol is higher (≈ 21 % annualised → 4.2 % 2-week σ).  Snap-election window and tech volatility justify inflating σ to 4.5 %.  

Directional tilt:  
+ Fiscal-stimulus expectation, weak yen, foreign inflows (⊗⊗).  
– Possible “sell-the-news” after 08 Feb vote, record high proximity, rising JGB yields (⊗⊗).  
Net drift estimated +0.5 % (≈ 270 points) vs base.  Thus central estimate ≈ 53400.

Resulting normal-ish distribution (µ = 53400, σ ≈ 2400) trimmed for mild upside bias.

Probability calibration
------------------------------------------------------------------
Median 53400; mean slightly higher (≈ 53500) because right tail broader.  1σ (~68 %) interval 51000-55800.  Tails allow rare but plausible 47000 or 60000 prints within 1 %.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Target variable: Nikkei 225 closing index level for 13 Feb 2026 (FRED series NIKKEI225).  
2. Outside-view base: Median = current 53200, σ = 3 % → 1600 pts.  
3. Consistency: Implied median = 53400; mean = 53500; matches drift + vol arguments.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Yen still weak, no BoJ meeting before 13 Feb (up).  
   – Election 08 Feb adds volatility, direction uncertain.  
   – Recent record high 54499, but tech wobble shows downside risk (down).  
   – Two-week historical vol ≈ 4-5 % right now (widens spread).  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected US equity crash (eg, new tariff shock) on 10-12 Feb could drag Nikkei below 48000.
