Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. TradingView snapshot (29 Jan 2026) – Gives latest cash-index level (52 655), recent high (54 487), and simple performance metrics.  Reputable real-time data feed; facts reliable, opinions are anonymous retail technicians → largely ignored.  
2. TradingEconomics note (2 Feb 2026) – Confirms current level (≈53 250 intraday), Y/Y gain (+38 %), and all-time high (54 499 in Jan 2026).  Forecasts (51 914 in 3 m; 45 234 in 12 m) are model-based but methodology opaque → treat as low-weight opinions.  
3. Investing.com “Yearly technical outlook” (late-2025) – Backward-looking facts on 2025 rally and BoJ path are sound; upside targets (55 000–62 000) are opinion.  Medium quality.  
4. Marketpulse “2026 Stock Indices Outlook” (Dec 2025) – Mostly macro context; no short-horizon forecast.  Useful for longer-term drift estimate, not for 11-day horizon.  
5. Marketpulse Kelvin Wong note (Jan 2026) – Gives concrete short-term support (53  370) and resistance (55  600).  Named analyst, high recency, good for gauging sentiment.  
6. Agent report – Supplies authoritative FRED series availability, outlines BoJ schedule, snap election on 8 Feb, earnings calendar and other catalysts.  Purely factual; high quality.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Target variable: Nikkei 225 level 11 calendar-days (≈7 trading days) ahead.  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. Nikkei 7-day percentage changes 2010-2025.  Suitable—same market, same horizon.  
2. Other developed-market indices (S&P 500, Euro STOXX 50) 7-day changes.  Acceptable but inferior—different microstructure, currency.  
3. Episodes around Japanese snap elections.  Too few cases (n≈6 since 1980).  

Chosen class: daily Nikkei returns ⇒ 7-day aggregated.  From 2010-2025 the empirical σ of 7-day % change ≈ 3.9 %.  Distribution is approximately normal with mild excess kurtosis; two-week 10 % left-tail roughly –6 % and 90 % right-tail +6 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 11 days.  In that span there are two material scheduled events: snap election (8 Feb) and peak week of Q3 earnings.  Historically one-day moves around BoJ or election surprises have reached 2–3 %; but average drift over 7 sessions is near zero.  No BoJ meeting before 13 Feb, so monetary shock risk is low.  Therefore outside view treats price path as driftless random walk with σ ≈ 3.9 %.

(d) Justification  
• Current close (reference) = 52 655 (1 Feb).  
• Expected drift: Nikkei long-run mean weekly return ≈ 0.1 %.  With upbeat earnings revisions and fiscal-stimulus hopes I assume +0.4 % over 7 sessions ⇒ +210 points.  
• Volatility: 1-σ range = 3.9 % of 52 655 ⇒ 2 050 points.  
• Fat tails: empirical kurtosis adds ≈ 15 % probability beyond ±2 σ; widen 10-/90-percentile band by ~350 points.  
• Unscheduled shocks (earthquakes, geopolitical flare-ups) remain low-probability but not negligible; further widen 10-/90-percentiles by another 250 points.  

Outside view calibration:
Mean (μ) = 52 655 + 210 ≈ 52 865  
Standard deviation (σ) ≈ 2 200  

Assuming a normal core with fatter tails, mapped to percentiles:  
10th: μ –1.30 σ  
20th: μ –0.85 σ  
40th: μ –0.25 σ  
60th: μ +0.25 σ  
80th: μ +0.85 σ  
90th: μ +1.30 σ  

Calculated values rounded to nearest 5 points:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 49 950  
Percentile 20: 51 000  
Percentile 40: 52 300  
Percentile 60: 53 400  
Percentile 80: 54 750
