Analysis:

a. Source analysis (chronological relevance, facts vs opinions)

1. Trading Economics, 02 Feb 2026 – factual last close 52655, 1-m gain 2.7 %, YoY +38 %, all-time high 54499; model forecast (51914/45234) is opinion from opaque methodology → weak weight.
2. CNBC, 22 Jan 2026 – factual BOJ held policy rate 0.75 %, Nikkei cash close 53847; expert quotes from HSBC on next hike (July) → moderate weight about policy path.
3. Kyodo & LiteFinance, 14 Jan 2026 – factual new record 54341 and snap-election timetable; LiteFinance upside targets 55100–58000 are marketing opinions → weak weight.
4. IG note, 20 Jan 2026 – factual technical levels (support 52637, resistance 54487); labelled analyst; short-term chart view → moderate weight for nearby support/resistance.
5. Asknews Japanese press items, 02 Feb 2026 – intraday detail: early +900 pt to 54247 then close –1.25 % at 52655 on semiconductor sell-off; foreign futures selling confirmed by volume data → strong weight for current volatility.
6. All other archival articles (Oct 2025, Dec 2025) are background context → weak for 11-day horizon.

b. Evidence analysis (weights)

Strong:
• Fresh closing price 52655 with one-day move –1.25 % shows active 2 %-class volatility.
• Historical 7-trading-day standard deviation 3.9 % (≈2050 points) 2010-2025 (structural, stable).

Moderate:
• Snap election 08 Feb; historical pattern ≈+1 % after LDP victories (six cases since 1980).
• BOJ next scheduled meeting late March; rate-hike risk therefore low before 13 Feb.
• Yen weakness at 155-159 supports exporters, mild positive drift.

Weak:
• Analyst upside targets 58000–60000 (longer horizon).
• TradingEconomics 12-month bear model.

c. Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 11 calendar days ≈ 7 trading days.  Halving horizon (3–4 days) would shrink σ to ≈ 1500 points; doubling (14 trading days) widens σ to ≈ 3100 points and adds risk of BOJ commentary after election.

d. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view baseline
• Start 52655 (02 Feb close).
• Expected drift over 7 sessions ≈ +0.3 % (historical mean 0.1 %, add +0.2 % for post-election optimism) → +160 points.

Inside-view tweaks
+ Election: add +0.3 % (≈+160) weighted 60 % probability LDP gains big → +100.
– “Sell-the-news” & semiconductor weakness: –0.2 % (≈-105).
Net drift ≈ +155 → mean 52810.

Volatility
Empirical σ₇ ≈ 3.9 % = 2050 points.  Add 10 % for current above-average intraday swings → σ ≈ 2250.

Distribution chosen ~Normal core with fatter tails (+25 % in 5 – 95 range).  Percentile grid rounded to nearest 100 (tails wider than ±2 σ for unknown unknowns).

Probability calibration
Implied mean 52800, median 52800 (nearly symmetric), sd ≈ 2250.  80 % central interval 50200–54700 equals ±4.3 %.  Matches observed 7-day history plus modest drift.

Checklist:
1. Target: Nikkei 225 closing level on 13 Feb 2026, index points.
2. Base rate: 0 % drift, σ₇ = 3.9 % of level (~2050 pts).
3. Consistency: median 52800; mean 52800; plausible relative to 02 Feb close 52655.
4. Key evidence: a) recent close 52655; b) 7-day σ 3.9 %; c) snap election 08 Feb historically mildly bullish; d) no BOJ meeting before 13 Feb; e) current tech-led weakness.
5. Blind-spot: Major external shock (US tariffs escalation or large earthquake) could knock Nikkei below 49000.
