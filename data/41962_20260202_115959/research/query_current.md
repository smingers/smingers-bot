Analysis:
The Nikkei 225 closed at 53,322.85 on 2026-01-30, hovering near its all-time highs. To project the level on 2026-02-13 (nine trading sessions away) I need fresh information on:
• Corporate earnings releases from large index constituents (e.g., Toyota, Sony, Fast Retailing) scheduled in the next two weeks.  
• Bank of Japan signals on ending negative rates or YCC, as even small policy shifts have been moving the yen and the equity market.  
• Movements in the yen–dollar exchange rate; a weaker yen usually lifts exporters and the Nikkei.  
• Global risk sentiment (US tech earnings, Fed guidance) that could spill over into Japanese equities.  
• Any geopolitical or macro shocks (China demand, energy prices).

I therefore want news and commentary published in the last few days that discuss 1) BOJ policy expectations, 2) Japan’s Q4 earnings season results/timetables, and 3) strategists’ short-term targets for the Nikkei.
