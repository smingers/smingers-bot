Analysis:
The question will resolve to the official daily closing value of the Nikkei 225 published by FRED for 13 Feb 2026.  To estimate a plausible range we need an “outside view”—what the index has historically done over comparable horizons and under current macro-financial conditions.

Relevant historical context to gather:
1. Recent trajectory: The Nikkei 225 has risen sharply since late-2022, reaching 53 322.85 on 30 Jan 2026.  Knowing the exact path during 2023–2026 (monthly average returns, drawdowns, volatility) helps set a base rate for one-to-two-week moves.
2. Distribution of 10-day returns:  What has been the typical percentage change over 10 trading days the past five years?  What were the largest moves?  (Needed to parameterise a random-walk style forecast.)
3. Macro catalysts around early-Feb 2026: Bank of Japan policy expectations, yen movements, corporate earnings season, geopolitical headlines.  These frame whether tail-risk moves (>±10 %) are plausible.
4. Comparables: How the index behaved around previous all-time-high attempts (late-1989, 2021, 2024) may indicate whether momentum stalls or accelerates.
5. Cross-asset context: Correlation with USD/JPY, US equities, global risk sentiment to judge whether foreign events could trigger outsized moves within the next two weeks.

I therefore want:
• A clean download (CSV or table) of daily Nikkei closes 2020-02-01 to 2026-02-01.
• News/analysis discussing the current rally and near-term expectations (February 2026 outlook).
• Any quantitative research or forecasts issued in late-Jan/early-Feb 2026 by brokerages or economists.
