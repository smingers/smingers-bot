The drop followed a decline in U.S. tech stocks from the previous week, leading to selling pressure on large-cap semiconductor-related stocks such as Adtest, which weighed heavily on the index. The yen weakened against the U.S. dollar, partly due to Prime Minister Sanae Takahashi's remarks during a weekend speech, where she noted that the foreign exchange special account was benefiting from the weak yen. Early in the session, broad-based buying emerged across export-oriented stocks including automobiles and machinery.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:57 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB023IA0S6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Turns Negative in Afternoon Trading, Falls Below 52,800 Yen on Friday's Drop**\nOn February 2, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock index initially fell by over 500 yen from the previous Friday's closing level of 53,322.85 yen, dropping into the 52,800 yen range. The decline was driven by losses in semiconductor-related stocks, which are highly influential on the Nikkei, following a drop in U.S. tech stocks the previous week. Although morning trading saw gains in export-oriented stocks such as automakers, supported by a continued yen depreciation and dollar appreciation, the Nikkei reversed direction in the afternoon session and entered negative territory.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:32 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20260202-GYT1T00288/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Turns Lower in Afternoon Session, Semiconductor Stocks Decline Amid Risk-Averse Investor Sentiment**\nIn the afternoon session of the Tokyo Stock Market on February 2, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock average turned downward, trading around 529,000 yen, down approximately 380 yen from the previous week's close. The TOPIX index also shifted into decline. During the afternoon opening, foreign speculative investors continuously sold futures, causing semiconductor-related stocks such as TOHOKU Electric and Adtest to fall further. At around 2:00 PM Japan time, the E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures dropped by over 1%, and South Korea's KOSPI index fell as much as 5%, prompting investors to adopt a risk-averse stance. The Nikkei 225's decline reached a temporary drop of over 400 yen. Following the market close, a basket trade involving multiple stocks executed by large domestic and international investors amounted to approximately 88 billion yen.

The rally was driven by a decline in the yen against the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange market, which led to increased buying across a broad range of stocks, particularly in machinery and automotive sectors. The market was further supported by growing speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Haga endorsed a weaker yen, prompting foreign speculative investors to increase futures purchases. The index briefly rose by over 900 yen, but after the initial buying surge, profit-taking and waiting-to-buy sell orders emerged, causing the gains to narrow rapidly.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:44 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL0214F0S6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Surges Over 900 Yen, Reclaims 54,000-Yen Level for First Time in a Week Amid Continued Yen Depreciation**\nOn February 2, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock index rose by more than 900 yen at one point during trading, marking the first time since approximately one week prior that it recovered above the 54,000 yen level during regular trading hours. This rebound was driven by continued yen depreciation, with the exchange rate reaching around 155 yen per dollar, boosting expectations of improved earnings for export-oriented sectors\u2014particularly automotive stocks\u2014leading to early buying pressure in the Tokyo stock market.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:45 AM\nSource:[\ufffdj\ufffdt\ufffde\ufffdB\ufffdj\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd[\ufffdX](https://news.nifty.com/article/economy/economyall/12198-4909240/)\n\n**The Path to Nikkei 60,000: How Yen Depreciation Is Driving Stock Gains**\nThe Nikkei 225 stock index closed at 53,322 yen on January 30, 2026, amid a lack of directional clarity, influenced by factors including a drop in the NASDAQ Composite, domestic corporate earnings reports, end-of-month fund adjustments, and media election forecasts. Despite the uncertain market direction, the Nikkei's earnings per share (EPS) reached a historical high of 2,703 yen on January 28, 2026. A strong positive correlation between the USD/JPY exchange rate and the Nikkei 225 has persisted since late 2023 into early 2026, with the yen weakening from above 150 per dollar on October 6, 2023, to the 159 yen range by January 13, 2026. During this period, the Nikkei rose from 47,944 yen on October 6, 2023, to 54,487 yen on January 14, 2026. This linkage is driven by three mechanisms: \u2460 export companies' profits rising due to yen depreciation (higher foreign revenue in yen terms), \u2461 increased foreign investor demand for Japanese stocks as they appear cheaper in a weaker yen, and \u2462 capital flows from widening interest rate differentials between Japan and the U.S. (yen selling, dollar buying). The rise in expected EPS, a key benchmark for target Nikkei levels, is directly attributed to yen depreciation, reinforcing the path toward a 60,000-point Nikkei milestone.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:13 AM\nSource:[\ufffdj\ufffdt\ufffde\ufffdB\ufffdj\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd[\ufffdX](https://news.nifty.com/article/magazine/12208-4909071/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Opens Higher Amid Yen Depreciation**\nThe Nikkei 225 stock index opened higher on Tokyo's stock market on February 2, 2026, rising 252.52 points to 53,575.37, up from the previous Friday's close. This rebound followed the nomination of former Federal Reserve (FRB) governor Michelle Wachter, seen as a 'hawkish' figure on interest rate cuts, as the next FRB chair. Additionally, growing market speculation that Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dji is accepting yen depreciation fueled increased selling of the yen and buying of the dollar. The yen weakened to around 155.00 per U.S. dollar, compared to the previous Friday's close, prompting buying pressure in export-oriented stocks such as automobiles and machinery.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:16 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL020C00S6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Averages Open Higher Amid Yen Depreciation**\nThe Nikkei 225 stock index opened higher on Tokyo's stock market on February 2, 2026, with the opening price at 53,575.37 yen, up 252.52 yen from the previous week's close. This positive start was driven by market speculation that former Federal Reserve (FRB) policymaker Lisa Cook, perceived as 'hawkish' on interest rate cuts, had been nominated as the next FRB chair. Additionally, expectations intensified that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is accepting yen depreciation, leading to increased selling of the yen and buying of the dollar. The yen weakened to as low as 155.5 per dollar\u2014down from the previous Friday's close\u2014prompting buying pressure on export-oriented stocks such as automobiles and machinery.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:08 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL020AH0S6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Rises on Yen Depreciation and Expectations of Political Stability Ahead of House Election**\nOn February 2, the Nikkei 225 stock index is expected to rise, driven by a continued depreciation of the yen and growing expectations of political stability following the upcoming House of Representatives election on February 8. The yen's exchange rate was around 154.80 per dollar, compared to 153.80 at the end of the previous week on January 30. Market analysts anticipate the Nikkei 225 will reach approximately 53,800 yen, up about 470 yen from the previous Friday's close of 53,322 yen. The anticipated increase reflects investor confidence in Japan's economic outlook amid expectations of a Liberal Democratic Party victory in the election, which is seen as a positive catalyst for Japanese equities.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:04 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL020360S6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Ends 174 Yen Lower at 53,936 Amid Profit-Taking, Marking Second Day of Decline**\nOn January 16, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock average closed at 53,936.17 yen, a decrease of 174.33 yen (0.32%) from the previous day, marking the second consecutive day of decline. The index had previously traded near record highs due to expectations of accelerated proactive economic policies following Prime Minister K\u014dichi Kato's dissolution of the House of Representatives and the anticipated expansion of the ruling party's seat count in the upcoming election. On January 16, profit-taking selling followed a market reaction, contributing to the drop. However, positive momentum from the previous day's U.S. stock market, where tech-related stocks rose, led to buying interest in some semiconductor-related Japanese stocks, which helped stabilize the market in the afternoon session and slightly narrowed the decline. The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) fell 10.30 points (0.28%) to 3,658.68, ending its five-day winning streak with a loss.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 06:54 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20260116-GYT1T00243/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Faces Profit-Taking Pressure Amid U.S. Stock Gains**\nOn January 16, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock index was expected to continue its decline following a sharp rise earlier in the week driven by speculation over the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The market's downward pressure was likely to be led by high-impact value stocks, which had benefited from the earlier rally. However, the previous day's rise in U.S. stock markets provided a supportive backdrop, making a purely downward move unlikely. The Nikkei 225 was projected to fall around 400 yen from its January 15 closing level of 54,110 yen, with the lower end of trading expected near the day's intraday low of approximately 53,700 yen.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 10:45 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL1602K0W6A110C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Ends Lower for First Time in Four Sessions, Down 230.73 Yen to 54,110.50**\nOn January 15, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock average closed lower for the first time in four trading sessions, ending at 54,110.50 yen, down 230.73 yen (0.42%) from the previous day. The decline followed a drop in U.S. equities the previous day, driven by geopolitical risks and a sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, which triggered a selloff in Tokyo\u2019s semiconductor-related stocks. The index briefly fell by over 600 yen during the session. However, persistent bullish sentiment on Japanese equities, fueled by speculation of a dissolution of the House of Representatives, helped narrow the losses toward the close.

The average index value for December was 50,162.42, up 2.10% from November\u2019s 50,111.11 and 12.99% over the previous three months. Despite temporary volatility, the index finished the month significantly higher than its starting level, as indicated by the dotted pink line on the graph. The index reached a monthly high of 51,028.42 on December 2, but did not surpass historical highs set in September and October. Of 22 trading days, the index rose on 12 days and fell on 10, showing near parity between gains and losses. The average daily decline was 0.88%, while the average daily gain was 0.76%, with a daily average volatility of 0.81%, lower than November (1.27%) and October (1.47%) but higher than September (0.77%). The largest single-day gain was 2.33% on December 4, and the largest drop was 1.89% on December 1\u2014moderate compared to November\u2019s 3.22% decline. Trading volume averaged 357 million shares per day, higher than November\u2019s 344.5 million and the 2025 annual average of 348 million. Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) remained in the top five most traded stocks for 122 consecutive days, reaching second place 16 times and topping the list on December 2. NTT Inc remained the market leader, topping the list for 21 out of 22 days and maintaining a streak of 614 consecutive days in the top five since June 29, 2023. The 'curse of the last trading day' reappeared, with the index declining on December 31, consistent with a trend observed since September 2020. The Nikkei-225 rose 26.18% in 2025, driven by yen depreciation and strong investor interest in AI-related Japanese tech stocks, though concerns persist about a potential bubble. Analysts remain cautious despite optimistic outlooks for 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 08:54 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/c3e7c770)\n\n**Nikkei Average Closes Above 54,000 Yen for First Time, Surpassing 54,341 Yen on Record High**\nOn January 14, 2026, the Nikkei 225 stock average closed at 54,341.23 yen, a gain of 792.07 yen (1.48%) from the previous day, marking its third consecutive day of increase and surpassing the previous record high. This marked the first time the Nikkei 225's closing value exceeded 54,000 yen. The market was driven by continued speculation that Prime Minister K\u014dichi Kato had indicated consideration of dissolving the House of Representatives during the opening of the ordinary Diet session, fueling expectations that economic policies would be advanced after an election. This sentiment led to broad buying pressure, pushing the Nikkei 225 to a session high of 54,487.32 yen. Semiconductor-related stocks rose, and export-oriented stocks such as machinery and precision equipment benefited from ongoing yen depreciation and dollar appreciation. Over 70% of Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime market stocks ended higher. The TOPIX index also reached a new record high, closing at 3,644.16, up 45.27 points (1.26%).\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 06:54 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20260114-GYT1T00251/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Rises Over 900 Yen in Afternoon Session Amid Semiconductor Gains**\nOn January 14, 2026, during the afternoon session of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose as much as 900 yen above the previous day's close, reaching a high of over 54,400 yen. This surge was driven by increased buying in short-term stock index futures, pushing the index higher. Semiconductor-related stocks, including Adtest and Tohoku Electric, saw a further rise in the afternoon. However, after the opening, the gain narrowed to the mid-54,200 yen range. The upward deviation of the Nikkei 225 from its 25-day moving average exceeded 7%, surpassing the 5% threshold often associated with 'overbought' conditions, prompting profit-taking and position-adjustment selling that capped further gains. Following the close, a basket trade involving multiple stocks executed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's post-market session totaled approximately 84.1 billion yen. As of 12:45 PM, the trading value on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market was estimated at 392.81 billion yen, with a turnover of 1.4907 billion shares.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 04:51 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL142T60U6A110C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Opens Slightly Higher Amid U.S. Stock Gains**\nThe Nikkei 225 stock average opened slightly higher on December 24, 2025, with the opening price at 50,475.48 yen, up 62.61 yen from the previous day. The gain briefly exceeded 100 yen before narrowing. This upward momentum followed the previous day's rise in major U.S. stock indices, which prompted early buying in Japanese equities. However, with market participants decreasing ahead of Christmas and the year-end, trading activity remained cautious, limiting upward momentum.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 24, 2025 12:08 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL240JL0U5A221C2000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Average Hits 17-Month High on Rate Cut Hopes and Buybacks**\nOn November 27, 2025, the Nikkei 225 stock index rose for the third consecutive day, closing at 50,167.10 yen, a gain of 608.03 yen (1.23%) from the previous day. This marked the first time the index closed above 50,000 yen since November 17, 2025. The rally was driven by overseas investors, responding to expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut, which had led to gains in major U.S. stock indices the previous day. The rebound was further supported by renewed buying in value stocks, particularly semiconductor-related equities that had seen recent corrections. The index briefly rose by as much as 700 yen during the session.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB273NF0X21C25A1000000/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on my comprehensive analysis of recent news sources up to February 2, 2026, here's the latest assessment of how Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy is impacting the Nikkei 225 in early February 2026:\n\n### 1. **Current BoJ Policy Stance**\n- The BoJ maintained its policy rate at 0.75% (a 30-year high) in January but signaled imminent rate hikes through its Summary of Opinions released February 2. [3][4][5][6][8][11][13][14]\n- Key concerns driving policy are:\n  - **Yen weakness**: Persistent depreciation (USD/JPY near 155.27) is amplifying inflation through higher import costs, with BoJ members calling it \"increasingly likely to push up prices\" [3][5][7]. One member noted financial conditions remain \"considerably accommodative\" due to yen weakness. [6]\n  - **Inflation risks**: Core CPI forecasts were upgraded to 1.9%-2.2% for 2026-2027, above the 2% target [11][14]. Members emphasized \"timely and appropriate rate hikes\" to avoid falling behind the curve. [4][8]\n- Dissent exists: Board member Hajime Takata advocated for an immediate hike, citing \"upward inflation risks\" [10][14].\n\n### 2. **Impact on Nikkei 225**\n- **Immediate market reaction**: On February 2, the Nikkei closed down **1.25% at 52,655.18**, while the Topix fell 0.85% [2][7]. This contrasts with a 6% January gain. [10]\n- **Primary drivers of decline**:\n  - **Rate hike fears**: Hawkish BoJ signals amplified selling pressure, as investors anticipate 2-3 rate hikes in 2026 (potentially reaching 1.50%). [17][18][19] Citigroup warned this could trigger prolonged equity underperformance. [17]\n  - **Bond yield surge**: 10-year JGB yields hit 2.32% (decade-high), raising borrowing costs and diverting capital from equities. [17][19][20]\n  - **Political uncertainty**: The snap election (February 8) and PM Sanae Takaichi\u2019s proposed fiscal stimulus (including food tax suspension) fueled concerns about fiscal-monetary policy misalignment. [5][16][17]\n- **Offsetting factors**:\n  - Early February saw a brief 900-point Nikkei rally on political optimism (ruling coalition strength), but gains reversed by close. [7]\n  - Exporters benefited marginally from yen weakness, though gains were eclipsed by macro concerns. [5][17]\n\n### 3. **Conflicting Signals and Limitations**\n- **Policy tension**: The BoJ aims to tighten policy to support the yen, but this risks undermining the Nikkei, which thrived under loose monetary conditions. [13][17] Conversely, delayed hikes could worsen yen-driven inflation. [3]\n- **Data limitations**: Market reactions blend BoJ policy with external factors (e.g., U.S. Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh's perceived hawkishness [2][7]).\n- **Analyst divergence**:\n  - **Bearish view** (e.g., Citigroup): Aggressive BoJ hikes may pressure Nikkei toward key support (\u00a552,656). [17][19]\n  - **Cautious optimism**: Some see accommodative BoJ policy (even at 0.75%) as a Nikkei tailwind if U.S. tariffs ease. [15][19]\n\n### 4. **Near-Term Outlook**\n- **February trajectory** hinges on:\n  - **BoJ rate decisions**: Markets price a 48% chance of a February hike [3], with outcomes likely influencing Nikkei volatility.\n  - **Election results**: A strong mandate for PM Takaichi\u2019s fiscal plans may widen Japan\u2019s deficit, lifting yields and pressuring stocks. [16][17]\n  - **Technical levels**: Watch \u00a552,656 support \u2013 a breakdown could signal further declines. [17][19]\n\n**Key Weaknesses**: Limited data on sectoral impacts (e.g., banking vs. tech), and no post-election analysis (occurring February 8). Real-time market data would refine this assessment.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
