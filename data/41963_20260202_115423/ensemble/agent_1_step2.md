Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Edelman Global Advisory (12 Jan 2026):**
High-quality policy analysis firm. Identifies 2026 as year of "delivery as political liability." Key facts: Spring Statement on March 3 as critical test, May local elections, public services operating with no slack. Expert analysis clearly contextualized. Warns that failure to show improvement creates space for populist alternatives. Opinion from credible institutional source.

**WDEZ/Thomson Reuters (4 Jan 2026):**
Major wire service reporting. Facts: Starmer trailing Reform UK in polls, personal ratings at historic lows, May elections scheduled. Direct quotes from Starmer on leadership stability. High reliability for factual content.

**The Guardian - John Crace (13 Jan 2026):**
Political sketch columnist (opinion piece). Facts: Wes Streeting speech at Institute for Government, pre-Christmas briefing against Streeting backfired. Opinions clearly attributed to columnist, not presented as news. Useful for understanding Westminster dynamics but must discount speculative elements.

**The Guardian - Rafael Behr (14 Jan 2026):**
Opinion columnist. Facts: Labour polling ~20%, Conservatives at 24%, historical income stagnation since 2007-08. Expert opinion clearly identified. Analysis of multiparty dynamics valuable but speculative regarding "terminal" decline of duopoly.

**YouGov (Jan 2026 Holyrood poll):**
Gold-standard polling organization. Facts: SNP 34%/29%, Reform UK 20%, Labour 15%, UK government approval 10%. Methodology transparent (first Holyrood VI poll for 2026). Strong evidence for Scottish Labour collapse but limited direct relevance to Starmer's UK-wide position.

**Institute for Government (various dates):**
Authoritative governance research organization. Facts: 30 councils had elections delayed, Reform UK legal challenge scheduled Feb 19-20, May 7 election date. High-quality factual source with clear documentation.

**AskNews Articles (Jan-Feb 2026):**
Multiple sources aggregated:
- **BMG Research poll (28-29 Jan):** 51% want Starmer replaced, 21% support him, Andy Burnham leads at 24%. Reliable polling methodology (1,513 respondents).
- **Independent (1 Feb):** Andy Burnham blocked from Gorton & Denton by-election by 10-member NEC group including Starmer. 80 MPs support Rayner. Strong factual reporting.
- **Express/Breitbart (31 Jan - 4 Jan):** Gorton & Denton by-election Feb 26, Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin competitive. Lower-quality sources but facts corroborated elsewhere.
- **More in Common MRP poll:** Reform UK projected 381 seats, Labour 85. Extreme projection but from credible polling organization.

**Deep Research Analysis:**
Confirms Burnham blocking "accelerated" leadership speculation, Feb 26 by-election as proxy referendum, Reform leading 36%-33% in unreliable local polls. Synthesizes multiple sources effectively.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **BMG poll showing 51% want Starmer replaced** (28-29 Jan 2026) - Multiple Russian and UK sources confirm same data point from identifiable polling organization. Direct measure of leadership confidence.
2. **Burnham blocked from by-election** - Confirmed by Independent, Deep Research, multiple sources. Creates clear catalyst for leadership speculation in 13-day window.
3. **Feb 26 Gorton & Denton by-election scheduled** - Institutional fact from multiple sources. Critical test 11 days after measurement date (Feb 15).

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Labour polling ~20% nationally** - Confirmed by multiple sources (WSWS, Guardian, various polls). Establishes dire political context but polling alone rarely triggers immediate departure.
2. **Reform UK leading in some polls** - More in Common MRP, various sources. Demonstrates electoral threat but MRP projections are volatile.
3. **May 2026 local elections as critical test** - Multiple expert sources (Edelman, Institute for Government) identify this as potential trigger point, but 3+ months away from measurement date.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Mandelson scandal** - Recent (1-2 Feb) but indirect impact on Starmer. No direct misconduct alleged against PM.
2. **Wes Streeting/Angela Rayner positioning** - Speculative reporting about potential challengers. No formal challenge announced.
3. **Starmer's "zen-like demeanor" concerns** - Anonymous MP sourcing, highly speculative.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 13 days (Feb 2 to Feb 15, 2026)

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- **Feb 15 measurement date:** Metaculus community prediction captured at specific moment
- **Feb 26 by-election:** 11 days AFTER measurement - forecasters will anticipate this but won't have results
- **March 3 Spring Statement:** 16 days after measurement
- **May 7 local elections:** 82 days after measurement (outside 2026 resolution window but relevant to forecaster thinking)
- **11 months remaining in 2026:** Long enough for multiple scenarios to unfold

**If timeframe halved (6-7 days):** Would significantly decrease probability of >34% prediction, as less time for new information to emerge and community to update. Current events (Burnham blocking, BMG poll) would dominate with less chance for additional catalysts.

**If timeframe doubled (26 days):** Would significantly increase probability of >34% prediction, as forecasters would have Feb 26 by-election results to incorporate. A Labour loss in Gorton & Denton would likely push community prediction above 34% threshold.

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate:** 42% (established in prior analysis)

This base rate reflected moderate uncertainty about whether Metaculus community would exceed 34% threshold, recognizing tension between terrible polling and structural barriers to departure.

**How Current Evidence Shifts This:**

**Factors pushing probability UP (toward Yes):**

1. **BMG poll timing (28-29 Jan):** This is VERY recent - just 4-5 days before current date (Feb 2). Metaculus forecasters will have this fresh data showing majority want Starmer replaced. This is strong, identifiable evidence that would push community predictions higher.

2. **Burnham blocking catalyst (announced ~1 Feb):** The Independent reports this "accelerated" leadership speculation. MPs warn this was strategic error by Starmer. This creates fresh narrative momentum in the 13-day window that forecasters will incorporate.

3. **Feb 26 by-election proximity:** Forecasters on Feb 15 will be 11 days from a critical test. Even without results, the anticipation of potential Labour loss (Reform reportedly leading 36%-33% in local polls) will factor into predictions.

4. **Scottish polling collapse:** YouGov shows Labour at 15% in Scotland, worst result in 116 years. While regional, this adds to narrative of Labour crisis.

5. **Multiple credible sources confirming leadership speculation:** Not just tabloids - The Guardian, Independent, FT journalists all reporting on leadership dynamics. This creates self-fulfilling prophecy effect where speculation itself becomes news.

**Factors pushing probability DOWN (toward No):**

1. **Structural barriers unchanged:** 404-seat majority means no mechanism for forced removal. This fundamental constraint hasn't changed.

2. **No formal challenge announced:** As of Feb 2, despite speculation, no actual leadership contest has been triggered. Metaculus forecasters distinguish between speculation and concrete action.

3. **Historical base rate of mid-term PM departure:** Still very low without confidence vote loss or personal scandal. Starmer has neither.

4. **Time decay:** May elections (main trigger point) are 3 months away. For departure to occur "during 2026," there's 11 months. Forecasters may see current crisis as insufficient to predict departure within this window.

**Critical Insight:** The question asks about METACULUS COMMUNITY PREDICTION, not actual outcome. This is meta-forecasting. The community will be weighing:
- Recent BMG poll (51% want replacement)
- Burnham blocking narrative
- Upcoming by-election
- May elections looming
- But also: massive majority, no mechanism for removal, historical rarity of mid-term departures

**Calibration Logic:**

The 34% threshold is specific and meaningful. If Metaculus community predicts exactly 34%, this question resolves No. So we need >34%, meaning 35%+ on the target question.

Given:
- Fresh polling showing majority want Starmer out (51%)
- Recent catalyst (Burnham blocking) creating momentum
- Upcoming test (Feb 26) that forecasters will anticipate
- But: structural barriers remain, no formal challenge

I assess the Metaculus community on Feb 15 will likely be in the 32-38% range for "Starmer ceases to be PM during 2026."

The BMG poll and Burnham blocking are recent enough (within 2 weeks of measurement date) to push predictions higher than the ~30% baseline I previously estimated. However, sophisticated forecasters will still anchor to structural constraints.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from 42% outside view, current evidence suggests:

**Upward pressure:** BMG poll + Burnham catalyst + by-election proximity = +10-15 percentage points
**Downward pressure:** No formal challenge + structural barriers + historical base rate = -5-8 percentage points

Net effect: +5-10 percentage points from base rate

However, I need to reconsider the base rate itself. The 42% was based on limited information. With fresh BMG poll (51% want replacement) and Burnham blocking creating immediate catalyst, the probability that Metaculus community exceeds 34% is higher.

**Key consideration:** Metaculus forecasters tend to be more analytical than general public, BUT the 51% figure from BMG is so stark, and the Burnham blocking so recent, that even cautious forecasters will likely push above 34% threshold.

**Revised Assessment:** 58%

This reflects:
- High likelihood (58%) that fresh negative data (BMG poll, Burnham blocking) pushes Metaculus community above 34% threshold
- Recognition that sophisticated forecasters will still discount general sentiment somewhat
- Anticipation of Feb 26 by-election will elevate predictions even without results
- But structural barriers prevent predictions from going much higher (likely ceiling around 40-45%)

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community predict >34% chance that Keir Starmer ceases to be UK PM during 2026, measured on Feb 15, 2026? (13 days from now)

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view was 42%. Current evidence (BMG poll, Burnham blocking) provides fresh negative catalysts within 2 weeks of measurement date, justifying upward revision to 58%.

3. **Consistency check:** "58 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 15, 2026 exceeds 34% for Starmer departure during 2026." This aligns with fresh polling data and recent catalysts pushing forecaster sentiment higher, while recognizing structural barriers prevent much higher predictions.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - BMG poll (28-29 Jan): 51% want Starmer replaced - fresh, credible, quantitative
   - Burnham blocked from by-election (~1 Feb): MPs say this "accelerated" leadership speculation
   - Feb 26 by-election 11 days after measurement: Forecasters will anticipate potential Labour loss
   - 404-seat majority: Structural barrier preventing forced removal mechanisms
   - No formal leadership challenge announced as of Feb 2

5. **Blind spot:** If a major new scandal directly involving Starmer breaks between Feb 2-15 (e.g., financial impropriety, personal misconduct), this could push Metaculus community well above 34%, potentially to 45-50%. This would make my 58% look conservative. Conversely, if Starmer gives a strong performance or positive economic news emerges, predictions could stay below 34%, making my forecast look overconfident.

6. **Status quo bias:** The situation is volatile with multiple recent negative developments (BMG poll, Burnham blocking) within days of measurement date. However, Metaculus forecasters are typically measured and evidence-based. A slight adjustment toward status quo would suggest ~55% rather than 58%, but the fresh catalysts are significant enough to justify 58%.

Probability: 58%
