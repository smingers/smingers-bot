Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Conversation (January 6, 2026):**
Academic analysis by Matthew Flinders examining Labour's "doom loop." Key factual elements: May 2026 elections approaching, economic challenges since 2008, Starmer's 2024 electoral victory was negative (anti-Conservative) rather than positive. Expert opinion from named academic argues leadership replacement isn't the core issue and that no contenders offer compelling renewal narrative. High-quality source with clear separation between facts and expert analysis.

**The Week (January 2, 2026):**
Reports Ipsos poll finding fewer than half believe Starmer will remain PM by end of 2026. This is a concrete data point from a reputable pollster. Also notes pollsters' surprise at hostility levels toward Starmer and Reeves (attributed to FT's George Parker). Starmer's own statements about 2026 bringing positive change are quoted. Moderate quality - mixes hard polling data with unnamed ally sources.

**WSWS (January 29, 2026):**
Reports Andy Burnham blocked from by-election by NEC (8-1 vote), Labour polling "less than 20 percent," and multiple named sources from FT and Times discussing leadership weakness. Key factual elements: DWP told no parliamentary time for benefit reforms until "next year at earliest," Wes Streeting has support of "up to 200 Labour MPs" per Times. Source has explicit left-wing orientation but cites mainstream outlets (FT, Times, Guardian) extensively. The factual reporting on NEC vote and polling appears credible; editorial framing should be discounted.

**Express.co.uk (February 2, 2026):**
Reports Lord Mandelson resignation from Labour Party over Epstein links, including alleged £75,000 payments. Factual elements: DOJ document release, Mandelson's previous sacking as US ambassador, his denial of payment recollection. Political reactions from Kemi Badenoch, Ed Davey, and government minister Olivia Bailey are all attributed quotes. Tabloid source but with specific, attributable statements. Also mentions Starmer suggesting Angela Rayner could return.

**Sky News (February 2, 2026):**
Reports Dan Norris (independent MP, formerly Labour) further arrested on multiple sexual offense charges. Factual police statement from Avon and Somerset Police. Not directly relevant to Starmer's position as PM since Norris is no longer Labour.

**Al Jazeera (February 2, 2026):**
Confirms Mandelson resignation with additional details from DOJ files. Corroborates Express reporting with international perspective. Reputable news source providing factual account.

**Agent Report:**
Technical analysis of Metaculus API availability and UK political timeline. Confirms API access is feasible but acknowledges actual probability curves haven't been extracted. Identifies two major UK events: Grok deep-fake scandal (9-15 Jan) and Mandelson-Epstein revelations (31 Jan - 2 Feb). Notes information gaps remain regarding actual historical Metaculus probability movements.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions on "cease to be PM/President" questions in final 2 weeks before checkpoint:**
   - Most directly relevant but data not yet extracted per agent report
   - Would show typical volatility and late-breaking news impact
   - Suitability: HIGH if data available, but currently unavailable

2. **UK Prime Ministers facing mid-term crises with poor polling:**
   - Examples: Theresa May (2017-2019), Liz Truss (2022), Boris Johnson (2022)
   - Labour polling at <20% is historically dire
   - Recent precedent: Truss lasted 49 days amid market crisis
   - Suitability: MODERATE - provides context but each situation unique

3. **Metaculus community predictions generally in final 2 weeks:**
   - Tend to be relatively stable absent major news
   - Late information can cause significant swings
   - Suitability: MODERATE - general platform behavior

4. **Political betting/forecasting markets during leadership crises:**
   - Markets typically show gradual deterioration punctuated by event-driven jumps
   - 13-day window (Feb 2 to Feb 15) is relatively short for major regime change
   - Suitability: MODERATE-HIGH

**Chosen reference class:** Combination of #2 (UK PM mid-term crises) and #4 (short-term political forecasting market behavior), given lack of specific Metaculus historical data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 13 days (February 2 to February 15, 2026)

**Current baseline (implicit from sources):**
- The Week reports Ipsos poll showing <50% believe Starmer survives 2026 (full year)
- This suggests year-end probability might be around 40-50% for "ceases to be PM"
- For a 13-day window, probability should be much lower absent acute crisis

**Historical patterns:**
- UK PM departures typically follow either: (a) election loss, (b) party confidence vote loss, (c) voluntary resignation
- Mid-term departures usually preceded by weeks/months of crisis, not days
- Liz Truss (fastest post-war departure) took 49 days from taking office
- Boris Johnson took ~3 months from initial scandals to resignation

**Key factors for 13-day window:**
- May 2026 elections are 3 months away - natural inflection point but not immediate
- Andy Burnham blocked from by-election (Jan 29) suggests leadership challenge postponed
- No confidence vote mechanism requires formal trigger
- Parliament needs to be sitting for procedural actions

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether Metaculus community prediction will be >34% on Feb 15 for "Will Starmer cease to be PM during 2026?"

**Factors suggesting prediction will be ABOVE 34%:**
1. Severe political crisis evident: Labour polling <20%, Mandelson scandal, leadership challenge attempts
2. The Conversation article (Jan 6) explicitly discusses whether Starmer survives 2026
3. Ipsos poll showing <50% believe he survives full year suggests market awareness of risk
4. May 2026 elections approaching create natural pressure point
5. Multiple potential successors identified (Burnham, Streeting, Mahmood)
6. FT editorial (per WSWS) questions if Starmer can "fulfil a prime minister's core function"

**Factors suggesting prediction will be BELOW or AT 34%:**
1. 13-day window is very short for major political change
2. NEC blocking Burnham (Jan 29) shows establishment protecting Starmer
3. No imminent confidence vote mechanism triggered
4. Historical UK PM departures take weeks/months to unfold
5. 34% for full-year 2026 is already quite high - suggests market may have priced in current crisis
6. Metaculus communities tend toward relative conservatism absent acute triggers

**Critical consideration:**
The target Metaculus question asks about the FULL YEAR 2026 (365 days), while we're only 13 days in. A 34% probability for the full year implies roughly:
- If uniform distribution: ~0.09% per day → ~32% by year-end
- But departures aren't uniform - they cluster around crises and elections
- May 2026 elections are the obvious catalyst (3 months away)

The question is whether the Metaculus community will assess full-year risk at >34% on Feb 15. Given:
- Current severe crisis (Mandelson, polling collapse, leadership speculation)
- May elections creating medium-term pressure
- But no immediate trigger in next 13 days

The community likely views 2026 risk as elevated but not imminent. A 34% threshold for the full year is substantial but not extreme given circumstances.

## Outside view calibration:

The Ipsos poll showing <50% believe Starmer survives 2026 provides an anchor, though public polls and forecasting communities often diverge. 

If general public is ~50/50 on survival, informed forecasters might be slightly more conservative (recognizing institutional inertia) but also more sensitive to procedural pathways. 

The 34% threshold is asking: "Is there roughly 1-in-3 chance Starmer leaves in 2026?" Given:
- Severe current crisis
- 11 months remaining in year
- May elections as clear pressure point
- But no immediate mechanism

My assessment: The Metaculus community on Feb 15 will likely place full-year 2026 risk in the 30-40% range. The question is whether it exceeds 34% specifically.

Given the severity of current crisis (Mandelson scandal fresh, polling collapse, leadership speculation widespread), and that we're only 2 weeks into the year with 11 months of risk remaining, I estimate the community prediction will be slightly above the 34% threshold.

**Outside View Prediction: 42%**

This reflects my assessment that there's approximately 42% probability the Metaculus community prediction on February 15, 2026 will exceed 34% for the question "Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister during 2026?"
