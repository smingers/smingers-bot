## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **BMG poll (28-29 Jan)**: 51% want Starmer replaced; only 21% want him to stay. Multiple independent Russian and UK sources confirm. Direct measure of leadership pressure.
- **Burnham blocking (late Jan)**: NEC decision reported by Independent, Express, multiple sources. Creates immediate leadership tension before Feb 26 by-election. MPs explicitly warn this "accelerated" challenge timeline.
- **Scotland YouGov**: 74% unfavorable for Starmer; 68% of own 2024 voters disapprove of UK government. Devastating numbers ahead of May Scottish elections.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Reform UK polling lead**: Multiple sources (More in Common, various polls) show Reform 28-30% vs Labour 17-20%. Consistent trend but national polls, not Metaculus-specific.
- **Gorton & Denton by-election (Feb 26)**: 11 days before checkpoint. Express reports "neck and neck" but polling sparse. If Labour loses a safe seat, could spike Metaculus predictions dramatically.
- **Mandelson resignation (31 Jan - 2 Feb)**: Fresh scandal reported by Express, Al-Jazeera, BBC. Negative but indirect impact on Starmer personally.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Streeting/Rayner positioning**: Guardian opinion pieces and speculation. No concrete leadership challenge announced.
- **Historical Conservative instability**: Cited by Starmer as reason not to change - but this is his own argument, not predictive evidence.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeline: 13 days remaining (Feb 2 → Feb 15)**

Critical upcoming events:
- **Feb 19-20**: Reform UK legal challenge to election delays (4-5 days after checkpoint - irrelevant)
- **Feb 26**: Gorton & Denton by-election (11 days after checkpoint - relevant if early voting/polls leak)
- **March 3**: Spring Statement (16 days after checkpoint - irrelevant)
- **May 7**: Local elections (81 days after checkpoint - irrelevant)

**If timeframe halved (6-7 days)**: Prediction would drop to ~10%. Insufficient time for news to propagate through Metaculus community unless immediate shock (resignation announcement, by-election polling bombshell).

**If timeframe doubled (26 days)**: Prediction would rise to ~30-35%. Would capture Gorton & Denton result and any immediate fallout, plus Reform legal challenge outcome.

## (d) Justification

**Current Metaculus baseline estimate**: Outside view suggests ~31%, but this was before:
1. BMG poll showing 51% want replacement (published 31 Jan)
2. Burnham blocking fallout (late Jan, intensifying early Feb)
3. Mandelson resignation (31 Jan - 2 Feb)

These are *very recent* negative developments occurring in the 1-2 days before/after question opened (Feb 2).

**Directional pressures:**

*Upward (toward >34%):*
- **BMG poll shock**: 51% wanting replacement is headline-grabbing. Metaculus forecasters update on polls. Likely already partially incorporated but may drive +1-2pp.
- **Burnham blocking**: Independent article (1 Feb) explicitly states MPs warn this "accelerated" challenge timeline. Creates narrative of imminent crisis. Could add +1-2pp.
- **Gorton & Denton pre-polling**: If any credible polls leak showing Labour collapse before Feb 15, could spike predictions. Low probability but high impact. Expected value: +0.5pp.

*Downward (toward <34%):*
- **No scheduled catalyst**: No major events in next 13 days to force resolution.
- **Historical inertia**: RC-1 shows median 1.4pp move in final 14 days. Status quo bias strong.
- **Starmer's own statements**: Repeatedly says he's staying. While self-serving, creates anchoring effect. -1pp.

**Net adjustment**: +1.5 to +3.5pp from recent negative news, partially offset by -1pp anchoring = +0.5 to +2.5pp expected move.

**Key uncertainty**: What is the *actual* Metaculus community prediction right now? Outside view assumed ~31%. If it's already 32-33% due to BMG poll incorporation, we need only +1-2pp more to cross 34%. If it's still 29-30%, we need +4-5pp, which is 75th percentile territory.

**Calibration logic**:
- If current = 31%: Need +3pp → P(success) ≈ 25% (base rate) + 8% (recent negative news) - 5% (no catalyst) = 28%
- If current = 32%: Need +2pp → P(success) ≈ 35% + 10% - 5% = 40%
- If current = 30%: Need +4pp → P(success) ≈ 18% + 5% - 5% = 18%

Given uncertainty about current level, weight scenarios:
- 40% chance current = 31% → 28% probability
- 30% chance current = 32% → 40% probability  
- 30% chance current = 30% → 18% probability

Weighted average: 0.4(28%) + 0.3(40%) + 0.3(18%) = 11.2% + 12% + 5.4% = **28.6%**

However, this may be overconfident. The Gorton & Denton by-election is Feb 26 (11 days after checkpoint). If damaging pre-election polls emerge Feb 10-14, Metaculus community could react sharply. Historical precedent: Liz Truss resignation rumors moved predictions 8-10pp in 48 hours.

Adjust upward for tail risk: **28.6% → 32%**

## Probability Calibration

My outside view established an 18% baseline assuming current Metaculus ≈31% and typical 14-day volatility. However, three factors warrant significant upward revision:

1. **Information lag**: BMG poll (51% want replacement) and Burnham blocking are 1-3 days old. Metaculus community may not have fully incorporated these yet. If current prediction is still 29-31%, these stories push toward 32-33% organically.

2. **Gorton & Denton proximity**: By-election is Feb 26, but pre-election polling/canvassing reports could leak Feb 10-15. A credible report of Labour losing a 50%+ safe seat would spike "Starmer out 2026" predictions immediately. Probability of such leak: ~20%. Impact if it happens: +5-8pp on Metaculus.

3. **Narrative momentum**: Multiple sources (Independent, Express, Russian media) now frame leadership challenge as "accelerated" and "imminent." This creates self-reinforcing media cycle that Metaculus community tracks.

Against this:
- No actual leadership challenge mechanism triggered yet
- Starmer repeatedly denies he'll quit
- Historical 14-day moves >5pp are rare (12% in RC-1)

**Final calibration**: The question is NOT "Will Starmer resign?" but "Will Metaculus community predict >34% chance he resigns by year-end?" This is a meta-prediction about forecaster behavior, not direct political outcome.

Metaculus community is reactive to polling and media narratives. Recent negative news creates conditions for 3-5pp upward drift even without hard catalyst. Gorton & Denton tail risk adds another 3-5pp expected value.

Base: 18% (outside view)
Recent negative news: +8pp
Gorton tail risk: +4pp  
Overconfidence adjustment: -2pp

**Final: 28%**

But checking against "18 out of 100" vs "28 out of 100" - the latter feels more aligned with the confluence of recent bad news and proximity to a by-election that could go badly wrong.

Adjusting to **30%** to account for genuine uncertainty about current Metaculus level and forecaster responsiveness to breaking news.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >34% chance Starmer ceases to be PM during 2026, measured Feb 15, 2026 (13 days from now)?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view 18% assuming current ≈31%, based on RC-1 showing median 1.4pp moves in final 14 days. My 30% represents significant upward revision due to very recent negative news (BMG poll, Burnham blocking) occurring in past 72 hours.

3. **Consistency**: "30 out of 100 times, Metaculus community prediction exceeds 34% on Feb 15." This implies current level is 31-32% and there's meaningful chance of 2-3pp upward drift from recent bad news or Gorton by-election pre-polling leaks. Reasonable given evidence.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BMG poll (51% want Starmer out) published 31 Jan - may not be fully incorporated yet
   - Burnham blocking + MP warnings this "accelerated" challenge timeline - 1 Feb article
   - Gorton & Denton by-election Feb 26 - pre-polling could leak before Feb 15
   - Scotland YouGov showing 74% unfavorable - reinforces crisis narrative
   - No scheduled catalyst before Feb 15 - limits upside

5. **Blind spot**: If current Metaculus is actually 27-28% (not 31%), I'm significantly overconfident. Would need 6-7pp move to cross 34%, which is 95th percentile territory. Alternative blind spot: Starmer makes surprise positive announcement (Cabinet reshuffle, policy win) that stabilizes narrative.

6. **Status quo**: 13-day window is very short. Historical inertia suggests small moves. However, this question opened Feb 2, coinciding with peak negative news cycle. If Metaculus community hasn't updated yet, they will in next 2-3 days, creating organic drift toward threshold.

**Probability: 30%**
