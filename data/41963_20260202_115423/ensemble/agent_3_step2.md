Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution-criteria alignment  
This resolves **Yes** iff the **Metaculus community prediction** for “Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?” is **> 34.00%** at **2026-02-15 07:44:03**; otherwise **No**. (Annul if target already resolved beforehand.)

(a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and what’s fact vs opinion)

High / medium quality, directly relevant:
- Edelman Global Advisory (Jan 12, 2026): Consulting-style analysis of UK politics in 2026; argues “delivery” pressures, tight budgets, and elections create political risk. Mostly **expert framing/opinion**, not hard new facts; useful for mechanisms (why pressure rises), not for quantifying Starmer removal odds.
- Thomson Reuters via WDEZ (Jan 4, 2026): Reports Starmer saying leadership change isn’t in national interest; notes Labour trailing Reform in polls, low approval, May elections upcoming. Reuters-syndicated facts are solid; Starmer quotes are **facts**, “speculation” is **context**.
- YouGov (Jan 2026 Holyrood polling + favorability): Quantitative polling: Starmer favorability 17/74 in Scotland; UK govt approval 10/75 there; major Labour weakness. Good methodology brand; still **regional** not national, but signals broad unpopularity.
- Institute for Government explainer (updated around Jan 2026): Concrete institutional facts: local election delays, Reform legal challenge scheduled Feb 19–20. High-quality for process; the “reflects poorly” line is **analysis/opinion**.

Reputable but more interpretive:
- The Guardian (Jan 13 Crace sketch): Political sketch; contains some factual references but heavily **commentary**. Useful as a sentiment indicator that leadership talk is “live,” not as proof of imminent ouster.
- The Guardian (Jan 14 Behr comment): **Opinion** grounded in polling trends and party-system analysis; useful for narrative that Labour support is collapsing, but still not direct evidence of leadership mechanics.

AskNews articles (mixed; key items):
- The Independent (Feb 1, 2026) on Burnham blocked + MPs warning it accelerates leadership challenge: This is the most directly relevant *inside-view* story: specific intra-party conflict, plausible successors (Streeting/Rayner), and by-election framed as a referendum. The Independent is generally credible; anonymous MP briefings are weaker than on-record, but the **NEC blocking** and **by-election date** are factual.
- BMG/i Paper poll reporting (Jan 31, 2026; repeated via multiple outlets including Russian-language reprints): Claim: 51% want Starmer replaced as Labour leader; 21% want him to stay. The poll itself is meaningful if accurately reported (BMG is a known pollster). Reprints add noise; the *poll claim* is the useful part.
- WalesOnline (Feb 2, 2026) Welsh sentiment polling: Regional data; suggests very poor perceptions in Wales. Medium quality; helps confirm breadth of discontent but not leadership mechanics.
- AFP / Straits Times / NDTV (Jan 4, 2026) similar to Reuters: generally reliable reporting of Starmer’s vow to stay; confirms narrative of leadership speculation tied to May elections. Helpful but mostly reiterative.
- NZ Herald (Feb 1, 2026) on EU defence cooperation talks: Real diplomacy detail but weakly linked to Starmer’s survival in 2026.
- Express / Breitbart / other tabloids or highly slanted outlets: Often amplify leadership doom narratives; treat as **weak evidence** unless corroborated by stronger outlets.

Net: The strongest inputs for *what Metaculus will predict* are (i) credible polls showing extreme unpopularity + “replace him” sentiment, and (ii) credible reporting of intra-Labour conflict (Burnham/NEC, successors positioning, by-election as focal point).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria: community forecast >34 by Feb 15)

Strong evidence (moves my meta-forecast materially upward):
1) Multiple independent signals of very low approval / high “replace Starmer” sentiment (YouGov-type approvals; BMG/i poll 51% want replacement; Reuters/AFP noting “historic lows”). Mechanism: Metaculus community tends to update on salient polling and leadership instability; this kind of unanimity makes “>34% risk in 2026” feel plausible to forecasters.
2) Concrete intra-party friction event (NEC blocking Burnham; leadership chatter) reported by a mainstream outlet (Independent) + repeated in broader commentary. Mechanism: leadership threats become more “real” when there are named contenders and procedural fights.

Moderate evidence:
3) Upcoming focal events that plausibly concentrate risk in 2026 (May devolved/local elections; Feb 26 by-election). Even though these occur after Feb 15, they raise the *annual* risk and thus can elevate the community’s probability *now*.
4) Institutional controversy (local election delays + Reform legal challenge). Adds to “government under pressure” narrative.

Weak evidence:
5) Tabloid-style “Starmer doomed by May” claims; foreign commentary extrapolations; China-trip optics. These may move some crowd sentiment but are low-reliability and often double-count what polls already show.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time until checkpoint: **13 days** (from 2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15).  
- Over 13 days, the *community prediction* usually moves modestly unless a major discrete event hits.  
- If timeframe were **halved (~6–7 days)**: I’d expect even less movement; probability of being >34 would be slightly closer to “current level.”  
- If timeframe were **doubled (~26 days)** (into late Feb): the **Feb 26 by-election** would likely cause a larger update; if Labour loses, community probability for “cease to be PM during 2026” could jump, making “>34” more likely.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view (42%) to an inside view

Key step: We are not forecasting “Will Starmer leave in 2026?” We’re forecasting whether **Metaculus will be above a relatively low threshold (34%)** on Feb 15.

Reasons I move upward from the 42% outside-view baseline:
- Threshold effect: In the current information environment, it is easier for the community to justify “around one-third” annual risk than to justify a low-20s risk. Given the volume of leadership-challenge talk + polling collapse, **34% is a low bar**.
- Convergent signals: Multiple credible indicators (polling, approval, and reported internal conflict) all point the same direction—higher perceived instability in 2026.
- No near-term “stabilizer” before Feb 15: There’s no obvious scheduled win (e.g., election victory, major economic turnaround) inside this 13-day window that would reliably pull community forecasts down below 34.

Reasons I don’t go to ~90%:
- Metaculus forecasters often discount “Westminster gossip” and apply institutional inertia: large parliamentary majority, formal party rules, and the fact that the most decisive electoral tests are months away can keep annual-ouster probabilities from drifting too high.
- We lack direct observation of the current Metaculus community number; it could already be near the threshold (e.g., 32–36), making the crossing uncertain.

Probability calibration
Outside-view base rate (given): **42%** that Metaculus community is >34% on Feb 15.  
Inside-view adjustments:
- +20 to +30 points from (i) credible “replace him” polling salience and (ii) clear intra-party leadership maneuvering (Burnham/NEC, successors), both of which tend to push crowd forecasts above “one-third annual risk.”
- -5 to -10 points for institutional inertia + uncertainty about current Metaculus starting level.

Net inside-view: I land around the low-to-mid 70s for “>34%”.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Yes iff Metaculus community on Q40967 is >34.00% at 2026-02-15 07:44:03; else No.  
2) Outside view base rate: 42%.  
3) Consistency check: 74 out of 100 times, the community prediction on Feb 15 exceeds 34%.  
4) Top evidence (brief):
   - BMG/i poll reportedly: 51% want Starmer replaced (annual-ouster risk feels ≥1/3).
   - Independent: NEC/Burnham conflict + leadership challenge narrative becomes concrete.
   - Multiple polls/YouGov-style approvals: extremely low approval, Labour collapsing, Reform rising.
5) Blind spot: If Metaculus is systematically more “institutional-inertia” than polling-driven here, it could sit ~25–33% despite bad headlines.  
6) Status quo: Absent a major new shock before Feb 15, Metaculus likely stays near its current level; with current climate, that level is more likely above than below 34.

Probability: 74%
