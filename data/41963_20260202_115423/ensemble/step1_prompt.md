The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 34.00% on 2026-02-15 for the Metaculus question "Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40967) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 07:44:03 is higher than 34.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 34.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 07:44:03, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Article Summary: "How can Labour escape the doom loop in 2026?"

**Source:** The Conversation, January 6, 2026  
**Author:** Matthew Flinders (academic)

## Key Facts and Context:

- **Media focus:** British media continues obsessing over whether Keir Starmer's premiership will end, with coverage focusing on whether he will survive 2026.

- **Starmer's position:** Starmer told BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he can and will lead Labour into the next general election.

- **May 2026 elections:** Unless Starmer does "something very radical very quickly," the May 2026 elections are likely to produce a leadership challenge.

- **The "doom loop" concept:** British politics is trapped in a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle where initial problems trigger responses that worsen the original problem, creating a spiral of decline.

- **Economic context:** Poor economic performance since 2008, marked slowdown in productivity growth, poor real wage growth and living standards. Low growth, high taxes, rising debt interest leading to declining bond market confidence, higher borrowing costs, stifled growth.

- **Electoral context:** Starmer did not "win" the 2024 election due to a positive vision but largely due to disillusionment with successive Conservative governments.

- **Governing style criticism:** Starmer's approach characterized as "miserabilism" - dampening expectations, emphasizing national crises, blaming previous governments. Perceived lack of ambition has exacerbated problems.

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Matthew Flinders (author) argues:**
- Leadership is not the core problem Labour needs to focus on
- The deeper problem is that none of the main contenders to replace Starmer seem capable of offering a bold story of renewal
- Opposition party leaders also lack this capability
- Starmer is not and never has been a storyteller
- His 2026 New Year message was unconvincing with body language betraying lack of inner belief
- The question for 2026 is less about Starmer's future and more about whether the political class can rebut the "broken Britain" narrative

## Additional Context:

- **Reform UK's advantage:** Nigel Farage's Reform party has exploited the political vacuum with a clear, confident narrative combining economic nationalism, cultural conservatism, and populist politics.

- **Academic perspective cited:** Alex Prior and Clara Eroukhmanoff argue political leaders need both a clear narrative and to be compelling characters within that narrative (examples: Thatcher and Blair succeeded; Theresa May failed in 2017).

# Summary of Article: "What UK Labour's leadership crisis means for the working class"

**Source:** World Socialist Web Site  
**Date:** January 29, 2026

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Andy Burnham Blocked from By-Election:** Andy Burnham, Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, attempted to run for MP after Andrew Gwynne resigned his Manchester constituency (Gorton and Denton). Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) voted 8-1 to block this move, which was widely seen as the first step toward a leadership challenge against Keir Starmer.

2. **Labour's Polling Figures:** Labour's polling remains "dire" and is described as "still dire" with the party polling at "less than 20 percent."

3. **Starmer's Weakness:** The article notes that even Starmer's most dedicated supporters admitted the NEC decision "looked desperately weak."

## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

1. **Financial Times (editorial, Wednesday):** Described "Labour's destructive infighting" and stated that "Since Starmer seems unable to hold Labour's majority together whenever he tries to drive through difficult but necessary policies, he can arguably no longer fulfil a prime minister's core function." However, they cautioned that Labour MPs "should think hard" about replacement unless "they are certain they have a replacement capable of rebuilding Labour's majority around a credible programme."

2. **The Times (Thursday report):** The Department of Work and Pensions has been told it will not receive parliamentary time for new benefit system changes until "next year at the earliest," making controversial welfare reforms less likely before the 2029 general election.

3. **Times Chief Political Commentator Patrick Maguire:** Complained that Starmer was depleting "the dwindling reserves of goodwill in a parliamentary party with no appetite to take political pain on behalf of its leader."

4. **FT columnist Stephen Bush:** Said "The prime minister's standing is diminished, which means it is hard for him to get anything controversial through parliament."

5. **FT editorial (on potential leadership change):** Warned that "Any successful challenge is likely to produce a more leftwing leader, and unsettle financial markets. At best that will limit Labour's room for manoeuvre; at worst, it could lead to bond market turbulence."

6. **Green Party leader Zack Polanski (to FT, December):** "I could see the potential to work with Andy Burnham to stop Reform and to challenge the rise of the far right. I would rule it out with Keir Starmer but I wouldn't rule it out with Burnham."

7. **The Times (on Wes Streeting):** Supporters "believe he would still command the support of up to 200 Labour MPs in a leadership contest" out of 404 total.

8. **Guardian political editor Jessica Elgot:** Noted that while the "majority still will not countenance backing Streeting," some have "begun to warm to the health secretary as a possibility," and some prefer Shabana Mahmood despite her "hardline immigration reforms."

## Less Reliable/Anonymous Sources:

- **Anonymous briefings from within Labour:** Prompted "a host of angry anonymous briefings" following the NEC decision.
- **An opponent of Burnham (to Politics Home):** Said of his leadership challenge, "Given the international context Keir is dealing with, it's nearly criminal."
- **Government sources (per The Times):** "Stressed that discussion about legislation was still continuing" regarding welfare reform.

## Additional Context:

- **Alternative Leadership Candidates:** The article identifies Wes Streeting (current health secretary, described as "Blairite attack dog") and Shabana Mahmood (home secretary) as potential replacements for Starmer.
- **Joseph Rowntree Foundation:** Cited stating "Poverty in the UK is still not just widespread, it is deeper and more damaging than at any point in the last 30 years."

**Note:** This article comes from the World Socialist Web Site, which has an explicit left-wing political orientation and perspective that colors its analysis and framing of events.

# Summary of Article: UK's ex-ambassador Mandelson quits Labour over Epstein links

**Key Facts:**

1. **Resignation**: Peter Mandelson has resigned from the Labour Party following revelations about his links to Jeffrey Epstein, according to UK media reports (BBC and The Guardian) on Sunday.

2. **Previous removal**: Mandelson was removed as UK ambassador to the United States last year after emails emerged detailing his associations with Epstein.

3. **Financial payments**: Documents released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday show that Mandelson and his partner allegedly received payments totaling $75,000 from Epstein in 2003 and 2004, according to the Financial Times and BBC.

4. **Additional revelations**: The DOJ files also contain:
   - An image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman (face obscured)
   - Emails from 2009 appearing to show Mandelson telling Epstein he was "trying hard" to water down a tax on bank bonuses while serving as business secretary
   - Emails suggesting Mandelson told Epstein that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon should "mildly threaten" the UK's chancellor over the tax

**Mandelson's statements:**

- Said he resigned to avoid causing further embarrassment to the Labour Party
- Stated he believes reports of payments are false but needs to investigate them
- Told BBC he has no recollection of the payments and doesn't know if documents are genuine
- Said he cannot place the location or woman in the photograph
- Reiterated regret for "ever having known" Epstein
- Apologized to Epstein's victims

**Context note**: The article states that "being included in the documents does not indicate wrongdoing."

**Relevance to forecast question**: This represents a significant political development for Keir Starmer's Labour government, as Mandelson is a high-profile party figure whose resignation could impact the party's standing and potentially affect Starmer's position.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve past Metaculus political leadership “cease to be” questions; chart community-prediction change during final two weeks before resolution or checkpoint; highlight typical magnitude and catalysts of moves. Also summarise any major UK political events from 1 Jan–2 Feb 2026 that affected Starmer’s standing.
The fresh document set largely confirms the situation you sketched in the earlier memo and fills in only one side of the brief—the political-events timeline.  Nothing in the new material supplies the missing Metaculus probability numbers, but several sources strengthen the claim that those data are retrievable through the public API.

1.  Availability of Metaculus “cease-to-be” time series  
    •  The official Python wrapper forecasting-tools already exposes Question.search() and Question.get_timeseries() (GitHub – Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  
    •  A worked Colab notebook that loops through IDs 1-15 000 and downloads the community_prediction_timeseries field is linked in an EA-Forum deep-dive (EA Forum, 24 Mar 2023).  
    •  Two template-bot repositories (Metaculus/metac-bot-template and limyifan1/metaculus-bot) show that unauthenticated GET calls are sufficient for public questions; they embed example curl and requests code.  
    These three independent code paths constitute proof that the quantitative piece of the assignment (extract the last-14-day probability curve for every “Will <leader> cease to be <office> before <date>?” question) is operationally feasible without web-scraping or private access tokens.

2.  What is still missing for the Metaculus analysis  
    •  A compiled list of question IDs matching the template (e.g., “Will Liz Truss cease to be UK Prime Minister before 2025?”, “Will Joe Biden cease to be US President before 21 Jan 2025?”, etc.).  
    •  The community_prediction_timeseries payload for each ID and the simple descriptive statistics requested (start-of-fortnight probability, end-of-fortnight probability, largest one-day move, etc.).  
    •  An event-matching layer that aligns ≥ 5 percentage-point moves with contemporaneous news headlines.  None of the newly surfaced sources attempts that mapping.

    In short, the conceptual path is locked in, but the API calls still need to be run and the results summarised.  Until that step is executed, any statement about the “typical magnitude” of late moves or their catalysts would be speculation.

3.  Documented UK political developments affecting Sir Keir Starmer, 1 Jan – 2 Feb 2026  
    The open-web coverage in the period points to two clusters of high-salience events; both plausibly moved betting and forecasting markets on Starmer’s tenure:

    A.  Grok deep-fake scandal and showdown with X (9 – 15 Jan 2026)  
        •  9 Jan – IBTimes reports Starmer calling the AI-generated images of women and children “disgusting” and putting a UK ban on X “on the table” (International Business Times UK, 9 Jan 2026).  
        •  13 Jan – BBC quotes Starmer warning that X could “lose the right to self-regulate” unless it reins in Grok (BBC News, 13 Jan 2026).  
        •  15 Jan – Sky News details Ofcom’s formal investigation and the government’s plan to criminalise supply of “nudification” tools (Sky News, 15 Jan 2026).

        Political impact: The episode dominated domestic news for a week and cast Starmer as both tough on tech harms and willing to threaten platform bans—a stance drawing praise from women’s-rights groups and criticism from free-speech advocates.  Either reaction could shift assessments of his political durability.

    B.  Mandelson–Epstein revelations and resignation (31 Jan – 2 Feb 2026)  
        •  1 Feb – BBC publishes Lord Mandelson’s resignation letter and details U.S. files showing three $25 000 payments from Epstein in 2003-04 (BBC News, 1 Feb 2026).  
        •  2 Feb – The Hindu carries AFP copy confirming the payments and noting Mandelson had already been sacked as UK Ambassador in Sep 2025 over earlier Epstein links (The Hindu, 2 Feb 2026).

        Political impact: Mandelson was a personal Starmer appointment to Washington; his fall and the resurfaced Epstein money created a direct line of attack for opposition parties (“poor judgement at the top”) and therefore a clear downside risk to Starmer’s perceived staying power.

    No other nationally covered incidents within 1 Jan – 2 Feb 2026 surfaced in the current result set.  Earlier tentative items—e.g., a “US steel-tariff confrontation” on 19 Jan or controversy over a Beijing state visit on 28 Jan—remain unverified and should be regarded as speculative until primary sources (Hansard, Guardian archive, ministerial press releases) are found.

4.  Synthesis relative to the original brief  
    •  The technical pathway for extracting and charting Metaculus late-stage probability moves is now documented in three separate repositories plus an EA-Forum post.  The only barrier is executing the script.  
    •  Without executing that script, numerical answers to “typical magnitude of late moves” and “what catalysts drive them” cannot be given.  That information gap persists.  
    •  For the UK-politics half of the request, two story arcs—the Grok/X scandal and the Mandelson-Epstein files—are well-sourced and clearly relevant to Starmer’s standing during the specified window.

Remaining information gaps  
    1.  Actual probability curves and statistics for each “cease to be” question.  
    2.  Empirically grounded mapping between ≥ 5 pp probability jumps and contemporaneous news (which may include—but need not be limited to—the Grok/X and Mandelson episodes above).  
    3.  Independent confirmation (or falsification) of any additional UK events in the 1 Jan – 2 Feb 2026 window that might have influenced Starmer’s perceived tenure.

Once the API extraction is completed, those three gaps can be closed; until then, any quantitative characterisation of “typical magnitude” must be deferred.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
