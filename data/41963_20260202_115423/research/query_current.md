Analysis:
The current community prediction is exactly 34 %. Any shift up or down by 15 February will be driven by new information that either 1) increases perceived risk that Keir Starmer is forced out – e.g., fresh polling disasters, public rebellions by MPs, talk of leadership rules being changed, bookmakers cutting odds, or 2) calms those fears – e.g., improving polls, successful policy launches, opposition disarray. Therefore the most useful articles for forecasters will cover:
• Latest UK voting-intention polls and Starmer’s personal ratings (Jan–Feb 2026).  
• Concrete signs of an organised leadership challenge (Burnham, Streeting, Cooper, Rayner, Labour NEC manoeuvres, union pressure).  
• Commentary from party insiders or political journalists about the likelihood/timing of Starmer stepping down, especially tied to May 2026 local elections.  
• Comparable historical precedents (Blair/Brown 2007, May 2019, Johnson 2022) that may be invoked in current reporting.
