Analysis:
The question hinges on whether Metaculus forecasters will grow more or less confident—over the next 13 days—that Keir Starmer will leave office during 2026.  Helpful historical context therefore includes:

1. Recent UK political developments since January 2026 that could plausibly raise or lower expectations of Starmer’s departure (e.g., rumours of leadership challenges, polling crashes, Cabinet resignations, policy crises).  
2. How Metaculus community predictions for similar “cease to be PM/President during year X” questions have behaved in the final weeks before a checkpoint; this gives an outside-view sense of volatility.  
3. Any fresh polling or insider reporting (first week of February 2026) that might trigger forecast shifts before 15 Feb.  

Thus, I need one broad web search for background on Starmer’s current political pressure, a Google News search for breaking stories, and an Agent query asking for data on past Metaculus prediction movements and analogues.

3. Retrieve past Metaculus political leadership “cease to be” questions; chart community-prediction change during final two weeks before resolution or checkpoint; highlight typical magnitude and catalysts of moves. Also summarise any major UK political events from 1 Jan–2 Feb 2026 that affected Starmer’s standing. (Agent)
