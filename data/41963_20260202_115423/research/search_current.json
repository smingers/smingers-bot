Referenced the Conservative Party's leadership instability as causing \"utter chaos\" and being among the reasons they were \"booted out so effectively\" in the last election\n   - Said he would be judged at the next election on whether he delivered on \"key things that matter most to people\"\n\n4. **Historical Context Provided:**\n   -

He emphasized that the government was elected to improve public services and ministers must change the system if it isn't working. Notably, he did not mention Starmer once in the speech.\n\n3. **Pre-Christmas Briefing Incident:** Before Christmas, team Starmer briefed against Streeting, suggesting he was attempting to stage a coup to oust Starmer from No 10. This backfired when Streeting performed well in media rounds the next day, appearing \"confident, clear and assured.\"\n\n4. **Starmer's Recent Messaging:** Starmer recently gave a speech complaining about the levers of power being slow and civil servants being too comfortable with the status quo. This was followed by a similar article from one of his former staffers.\n\n5. **Starmer's Popularity:** The article references Starmer's \"popularity ratings still flatlining\" and \"questions over his tenure in Downing Street becoming more persistent.\"\n\n## Opinions and Commentary (from author John Crace):\n\n- **On Streeting's Ambitions:** Crace notes that Streeting \"has never made any secret that his ambition goes well beyond being health secretary\" and \"will be among the first to put his name forward when Starmer decides \u2013 or has it decided for him \u2013 that enough is enough.\"\n\n- **On Streeting's Performance:** Described as \"one of the better performers on the Labour frontbench\" who \"believes in himself and he believes in the NHS\" and \"looks like he cares.\"\n\n- **On the Subtext:** \"Everyone understood the subtext. Wes was being Wes. He was ready whenever the call might come.\"\n\n- **On Timing:** \"He didn't mind waiting a little while longer. Time was on his side.\"\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion column by political sketch writer John Crace, so the analysis and characterizations reflect his commentary rather than straight news reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/14/labour-tories-old-normal-voters\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** January 14, 2026  \n**Author:** Rafael Behr\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Labour's polling numbers:** Labour's support has declined to approximately 20% on average, with some polls placing the party as low as the high teens, struggling to stay above the Greens.\n\n2. **Conservative polling:** The Tories are polling marginally higher than a few months ago but still below the 24% share they received in the July 2024 general election when they were defeated.\n\n3. **Historical context:** Average incomes stopped rising in real terms around the 2007-08 financial crisis, marking a break in the postwar promise of generational prosperity.\n\n4. **Electoral system:** Britain uses first-past-the-post, which is described as \"hopelessly ill-equipped to translate multiparty politics into a rational distribution of parliamentary seats.\"\n\n## Key Opinions and Analysis:\n\n**From the author (Rafael Behr):**\n\n- Both Labour and Conservative parties are banking on a \"return to the old normal\" - Labour hoping economic growth will restore support, Conservatives hoping economic failure will return them to power.\n\n- Both parties assume \"only two parties are licensed to supply Britain with prime ministers\" and that Reform UK is not one of them, but this assumption may be outdated.\n\n- Current politics suggests a shift from traditional two-party left-right swing voting to competition within \"multiparty blocs\" - a liberal-progressive one and a conservative-nationalist one, \"efficiently delineated by attitudes to Farage.\"\n\n- Local council races suggest \"England's two-party system looks more like a competition between Reform and the Liberal Democrats.\"\n\n- The Labour-Tory duopoly's decline might be \"terminal\" or represent a \"permanent, seismic change,\" though this possibility may be \"underpriced\" by leaders invested in old patterns.\n\n- Starmer's \"failure to communicate\" a theory of what went wrong and a plan to fix it is described as unambiguous in opinion polls.\n\n- Voters' dissatisfaction reflects \"doubt that politics in the familiar configuration can deliver anything other than disappointment.\"\n\n**Regarding Nadhim Zahawi's defection to Reform UK:** The article notes he is \"an opportunist who resigned over tax irregularities\" and previously called Farage \"a menace to Britain.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53977-snp-lead-reform-uk-in-second-in-yougov-january-2026-holyrood-voting-intention\">\n# Summary of YouGov January 2026 Holyrood Voting Intention Poll\n\n## Key Statistics and Facts:\n\n**Overall Voting Intentions:**\n- SNP: 34% constituency vote (down 14 points since 2021), 29% list vote (down 11 points) - would be lowest regional vote share since 2003\n- Reform UK: 20% on both votes (up from 0.2% in 2021) - would guarantee first seats in Scottish Parliament for a radical right party\n- Labour: 15% on both votes (down from 22% constituency/18% regional in 2021) - would be Labour's worst result in Westminster or Holyrood election in 116 years\n- Conservatives: 10% constituency vote (down 12 points), 11% list vote (down 12 points) - below their previous lowest Scotland-wide vote share of 12%\n- Greens: 12% list vote (up 4 points), 9% constituency vote\n- Liberal Democrats: 10% constituency vote, 9% list vote (up 3-4 points)\n\n**Voter Retention from 2024 General Election:**\n- Only 32% of 2024 Labour voters intend to vote Labour in May;

Additionally, 'shadow elections' were planned for two new unitary authorities in Surrey.\n\n- **Election Delays:** The government announced intentions to delay elections in 30 areas undergoing local government reorganisation, reducing the number of councillors elected by over 600. This followed a December 18, 2025 invitation to 63 councils to request delays if needed to focus on reorganisation. Of these, 30 councils ultimately had their elections postponed (announced January 22, 2026, with Pendle Borough Council added on January 29, 2026).\n\n- **Legal Challenge:** Reform UK launched a legal challenge to the election delays, with the case scheduled to be heard on February 19-20, 2026.\n\n- **Regional Mayoral Elections Also Delayed:** Six planned regional mayoral elections on the government's Devolution Priority Programme were postponed. Cheshire & Warrington and Cumbria were delayed to May 2027. Four others (Greater Essex, Hampshire and the Solent, Brighton and Sussex, and Norfolk and Suffolk) were announced on December 4, 2025 as \"minded to\" be delayed to May 2028.\n\n- **Current Party Control (as of scheduled elections):** Of 134 councils scheduled to hold elections, 96 have single-party majorities:\n  - Labour: 39 councils\n  - Conservative: 35 councils\n  - Liberal Democrats: 15 councils\n  - Other parties: 7 councils\n  - 38 councils are under no overall control\n\n- **Council Seat Distribution (after May 2025):** Labour held 34% of all council seats in England (down 2% from 2024), Conservatives 26% (down 4%), Liberal Democrats 19% (up 1%), and 'other' parties 22% (up from 16%, including 677 Reform UK councillors and 79 Green councillors elected in 2025).\n\n- **Local Authority Spending:** English local authorities spent \u00a372.1 billion (net current expenditure) on public services in 2023/24 (in 2025/26 prices), with adult social care (\u00a327.6 bn) and children's social care (\u00a313.3 bn) being the largest spending areas.\n\n**Opinions/Analysis:**\n\n- The article states: \"The decision to delay mayoral elections reflects poorly on the government.\"\n\n- The article notes that many local authorities face financial pressures due to \"over a decade of funding cuts, recent high inflation and increasing demand for services.\"\n\n**Context Relevant to Starmer:**\n\nThe article describes significant disruption to planned local elections through government-initiated delays, which has resulted in a legal challenge from Reform UK. These May 2026 local elections are mentioned in the background of the original Metaculus question as a potential test of Starmer's leadership, with media speculation about his prospects following a \"potentially disastrous performance\" in these elections.\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the community prediction be higher than 34.00% on 2026-02-15 for the Metaculus question \"Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?\"?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**After Visiting China, Starmer Says UK Is Too Slow in Infrastructure and Tech Progress**\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, following a four-day official visit to China from January 28 to 31, 2026, stated that the UK is too slow in advancing infrastructure and technology projects compared to China. According to the People's Daily and other UK media outlets reporting on February 1, 2026, Starmer emphasized the importance of China\u2019s rapid action speed in these areas during a press review of the trip. He noted that the UK business delegation demonstrated 'genuine proactive spirit' and was eager to seize opportunities presented by China. During an event at the Shanghai Innovation and Creative Design Research Institute, Starmer spoke alongside British actress Rosamund Pike (known as Pei Chunhua in Chinese), who said that Mandarin is 'the language of the future' and that her children are already learning it. Starmer responded that as bilateral relations strengthen, more professionals will need to learn Mandarin. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun affirmed on January 28, 2026, that China welcomes enhanced communication and cooperation with the UK, as both nations are UN Security Council permanent members, and that such collaboration aligns with the shared interests of their peoples and contributes to global peace and stability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:19 AM\nSource:[\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4QD2RY0r8t1)\n\n**Sir Keir Starmer hints at comeback for 'fantastic' Angela Rayner - Manchester Evening News**\nSir Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, has indicated that Angela Rayner, the former deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has a 'future role to play' in government and may return to frontline politics 'at the right point.' Rayner resigned in September 2025 after admitting she underpaid \u00a340,000 in stamp duty on a home in Hove due to incorrect advice, calling it an 'honestly-made mistake' in an emotional Commons speech. Starmer praised her contributions, stating she played a 'huge part' in Labour\u2019s 2024 election victory and was instrumental in passing the Employment Rights Act. He expressed personal regret over her departure, citing misogyny as a factor in the harsh criticism she and Chancellor Rachel Reeves received. Starmer described Rayner as 'the best social mobility story this country has ever seen' and affirmed her 'huge talent,' suggesting a Cabinet return is likely. Rayner, who remains a popular figure within the Labour Party and a potential successor to Starmer, confirmed she is still 'fighting' and 'not dead yet,' signaling her intent to re-enter politics. The statement was made on February 2, 2026, according to the Manchester Evening News.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:50 AM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/sir-keir-starmer-hints-comeback-33343402)\n\n**Poll is new low for Labour as huge chunk say Starmer doesn't respect Wales | Wales Online**\nA poll conducted by More in Common from November 25, 2025, to January 5, 2026, with 815 nationally representative respondents, reveals that only 17% of people in Wales believe Prime Minister Keir Starmer respects Wales, with 39% stating he has no respect for the people of Wales. The poll projects that just 38% of 2024 Labour voters in Wales will remain loyal to the party in the upcoming Senedd elections, while 20% plan to switch to Plaid Cymru, 15% remain undecided, and 8% would vote for the Greens. Among Welsh Labour voters, 21% said they would never vote for the party again, and 45% said it would take at least 10 years for Labour to regain their trust. Only 21% would consider voting for Labour again within the next four years. Rhun ap Iorweth received the highest approval rating, with 18% saying he is doing a good job, while 66% said Sir Keir Starmer is doing a bad job. Nigel Farage scored higher than First Minister Eluned Morgan in approval, with 29% rating him positively compared to 14%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:01 AM\nSource:[WalesOnline](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/poll-new-low-labour-huge-33343048)\n\n**British PM says UK should 'do more' with EU in joint defence**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for the UK to 'do more' with the European Union in defence cooperation, advocating for closer collaboration through initiatives like Safe (Security Action for Europe), a EU lending programme offering low-interest loans to help member states rearm following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Despite months of negotiations, the UK and Brussels failed to agree on the UK\u2019s financial contribution to join Safe, marking a setback in Starmer\u2019s efforts to rebuild post-Brexit relations with the EU after Labour\u2019s victory in July 2024. However, a strategic partnership agreement signed in May 2025 includes commitments to deepen defence cooperation and boost trade. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet UK ministers in London ahead of the next bilateral summit. Starmer has ruled out rejoining the EU\u2019s customs union but supports deeper integration with the single market, stating, 'I do think we can go further' in areas such as trade and youth mobility. Negotiations continue on a youth mobility programme with visa caps and limited stay durations. The UK has already secured re-entry into the Erasmus student exchange programme, set to resume in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:58 PM\nSource:[NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/british-pm-keir-starmer-says-uk-should-do-more-with-eu-in-joint-defence/7HN44774FRFTVAQIO5POGX3ZB4/)\n\n**'Chances have increased': Is Britain on the brink of a rightward shift? Farage eyes power**\nReform UK, led by Nigel Farage, leads UK opinion polls with 30% support, signaling a potential political shift in Britain. The party's rise challenges the traditional two-party system, with Farage emerging as a credible contender for Prime Minister despite Labour's current 174-seat majority. Political scientist Nicolai von Ondarza states that Farage's chances of becoming Prime Minister have 'significantly increased,' though the next general election is not until 2029. Labour's popularity has sharply declined, with Keir Starmer's approval rating at just 15% and a net satisfaction score of -62 points\u2014worse than any UK prime minister since 1979. This political instability is fueled by Labour\u2019s cautious, non-reformist 'Ming-Vase Strategy' that won the 2024 election but failed to deliver visible progress in office. Meanwhile, Reform UK combines post-Brexit skepticism with demands for greater regulatory independence, attracting defectors from the Conservative Party, including former ministers Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick. The Conservatives are shifting rightward, adopting Reform UK\u2019s positions on migration and international law. Electoral Calculus projections suggest Reform UK could secure between 319 and 418 seats in 2026\u2014just below the 326-seat threshold for a majority\u2014depending on regional outcomes. The party\u2019s rise has sparked concern in Europe, with fears of a new transatlantic right-wing alliance aligned with the US Trump model. A Farage-led government could destabilize post-Brexit UK-EU relations, especially in trade, regulation, and security cooperation. The 2026 regional and local elections will serve as a critical test of political momentum.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:06 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/drohender-rechtsruck-in-grossbritannien-farage-hofft-aufs-premier-amt-zr-94149404.html)\n\n**Starmer has accelerated leadership challenge by blocking Burnham, MPs warn**\nLabour MPs have warned that Prime Minister Keir Starmer accelerated the timeline for a potential leadership challenge by blocking Andy Burnham from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February 2026. The decision, made by a 10-member group on the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC), including Starmer, prompted internal party turmoil. Critics allege factional motives, fearing Burnham\u2019s candidacy could trigger a leadership contest amid declining Labour poll ratings and Burnham\u2019s personal approval ratings. The by-election is now seen as a de facto referendum on Starmer\u2019s leadership, with expectations of a Labour loss. In response, Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram condemned anonymous briefings against Burnham, calling them 'gutless' and damaging to the party. Speculation has intensified that health secretary Wes Streeting and former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner are preparing leadership bids. Streeting is viewed as a likely beneficiary of Burnham\u2019s exclusion, following his strong performance in a prior leadership row. Rayner, despite support from 80 MPs, faces criticism for not backing a letter calling for Burnham\u2019s reinstatement, undermining her credibility as a unifying figure. Labour is also campaigning to prevent left-wing voters from tactically backing the Greens\u2014worried about a 'Caerphilly scenario'\u2014where Labour lost a historic seat to Plaid Cymru. MPs report a drop in activist turnout due to low morale, with some stating they will campaign only out of obligation. Despite claims that blocking Burnham would end leadership speculation, the move has instead intensified focus on Starmer\u2019s rivals, particularly Streeting and Rayner, who is set to speak at a Mainstream group event just hours before the by-election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:45 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-burnham-streeting-rayner-labour-b2909684.html)\n\n**Keir Starmer could chicken out of major Reform showdown**\nKeir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, is facing growing pressure ahead of a crucial by-election in the Gorton and Denton constituency in Greater Manchester, where Reform UK's candidate, Matt Goodwin\u2014a TV presenter and academic\u2014is mounting a strong challenge. Polls indicate the race is neck and neck, with Reform UK gaining momentum. Starmer avoided confirming whether he would campaign in the constituency, stating only that he would campaign across the country as usual. He acknowledged Tommy Robinson's public support for Goodwin. The Green Party has positioned itself as the main alternative to Reform UK, warning that Labour\u2019s support is eroding. In the 2024 general election, Labour won the seat with 18,555 votes, while Reform UK secured 5,142 votes\u2014just ahead of the Greens\u2019 4,810.

He denied that his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, would support his succession, yet McSweeney left the possibility open. He denied that Health Secretary Wes Streeting could be a successor, but speculation persists.

Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, emerged as the top preferred replacement, receiving a 24% lead over other candidates among those wanting a leadership change. His support is drawn primarily from Labour voters in the 2024 election who wish to replace Starmer, as well as Reform Party voters who see Burnham as a viable alternative to Nigel Farage\u2019s party.

Starmer, 61, became Prime Minister after Labour\u2019s return to power for the first time in many years, having been knighted before his election.

If elected, Burnham could challenge Starmer for the premiership.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:35 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/politics/69630947/)\n\n**Poll Reveals True Level of Support for Starmer: How Many Britons Dream of His Resignation**\nA BMG Research survey reveals that over 50% of British citizens believe Prime Minister Keir Starmer should resign, with only 21% supporting him.

Only 21% of respondents supported Starmer in his current roles, while 28% were undecided. The survey, carried out on January 28\u201329, 2026, included 1,500 participants.

In contrast, current Health Secretary Wes Streeting and former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner each received 4% support.

Despite failing to deliver on key promises, including curbing illegal Channel crossings and reviving economic growth, Starmer asserted pride in 'material changes' brought by his administration, citing the chaos caused by frequent leadership shifts under the previous Conservative government as a reason for stability. In a BBC interview with Laura Kuenssberg, he declared, 'I will be sitting in this seat by 2027,' dismissing the prospect of a leadership challenge as contrary to national interest. However, public confidence is low: half of Britons expect Starmer to be replaced before the year ends. Rumors have circulated about potential challengers, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and former deputy Angela Rayner. Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage predicted that economic turmoil would force Starmer into calling an early election before the scheduled 2029 vote, which would likely benefit his party. According to the latest Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MRP) poll from More in Common, Reform UK is projected to win 381 seats\u2014up from 5\u2014giving it a 112-seat majority over all other parties. Labour is forecast to drop from 411 to 85 seats, while the Conservatives would fall to 70 seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 03:22 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2026/01/04/british-pm-starmer-insists-he-will-still-be-in-office-by-end-of-year/)\n\n**Not In National interest: UK PM Keir Starmer On Possible Leadership Change**\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated on January 4, 2026, that he would remain in office by this time next year despite low poll numbers and speculation about a leadership challenge. He dismissed the upcoming local elections in England, Wales, and Scotland as not being a 'referendum' on his government, emphasizing that 'chopping and changing' leadership\u2014such as under the previous Conservative government\u2014was not in the national interest. Starmer cited the instability caused by frequent leadership changes under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss (the shortest-serving UK prime minister), and Rishi Sunak, which contributed to the Conservatives' defeat in the 2024 general election. His Labour Party currently trails Reform UK in opinion polls, and his personal approval ratings are at historic lows. Nevertheless, Starmer affirmed his commitment to staying in power, stating he would 'fight for every vote.'

Starmer argued that Britain's national interest lies in deepening alignment with the EU single market, citing improved relations as the best in a decade and noting the UK's re-entry into the Erasmus student exchange programme and sectoral alignment in food and agriculture. He rejected rejoining the EU customs union or restoring freedom of movement but emphasized the need for 'closer' ties on a 'sector-by-sector basis'. His stance is expected to draw criticism from Brexit hardliners, particularly Nigel Farage and Reform UK, which leads in polls and is projected to gain significantly in the upcoming local elections and potentially win the next general election by August 2029. Starmer warned that a Reform UK victory would lead to 'toxic' division and vowed to lead Labour in 'the fight of our times'. Despite a turbulent 2025 marked by policy U-turns, ministerial resignations, and declining popularity, Starmer maintained that Labour's achievements\u2014particularly in EU relations\u2014have been overlooked and predicted a turning point in 2026.

These results could be 'decisive' for Starmer's future as Prime Minister. Predictions indicate significant defeats in Labour's traditional heartlands in England, potential loss of seats in the Welsh Senedd, and a 'battering' in the Scottish Parliament. The party is also expected to suffer substantial losses to Reform UK, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats, and in east London, to pro-Gaza Independent candidates.

The report indicates growing discussions among Labour MPs about a potential early departure by Starmer, amid a political crisis unfolding during a critical week as the government prepares to present one of the most anticipated budgets in modern British history. Parliamentarians have expressed concern over Starmer's 'zen-like demeanor,' which they believe does not reflect the mindset of a leader aiming to remain in power long-term. Upcoming general elections, scheduled for May 2026, are expected to be a major test for the Labour Party. A new poll conducted by Lord Ashcroft reveals that only 9% of voters believe Starmer will retain his premiership after the vote. Additionally, 69% of respondents indicated that Starmer's party shows signs of division, further weakening his position amid rising internal party dissatisfaction.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 12:49 PM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/11/23/premeru-velikobritanii-starmeru-predrekli-otstavku.html)\n\n**&#x27;I&#x27;m going nowhere&#x27;: Keir Starmer insists he will be PM at next election - despite poll showing nearly half of Labour voters want him out**\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, has firmly stated he will remain Prime Minister at the next general election, despite a YouGov survey of 2,100 people indicating that 45% of Labour voters\u201423% wanting him to step down immediately and 22% wanting him to resign before the next election\u2014believe he should not continue.

Let me be really clear - every minute that's not spent talking about and dealing with the cost of living is a minute wasted of the political work of this Government.' He emphasized his focus on tackling the cost of living and improving people's financial wellbeing.

Colleague journalist Andrew Neil reported that most members of the ruling Labour Party believe Starmer is ineffective both politically and in governance. Some party insiders are willing to wait until the May 2025 local elections in England, Scotland, and Wales\u2014predicted to be a 'catastrophe' for Labour\u2014while others argue that prolonging the crisis is unnecessary and want him removed by New Year 2025, when the failure of his budget statement will become evident. Despite Labour\u2019s victory in the 2024 general election\u2014the first in 14 years\u2014Starmer lost credibility by July 2025, including among party members, with some voting against government proposals, such as social benefit cuts.
