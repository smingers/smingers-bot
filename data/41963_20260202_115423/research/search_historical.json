Low growth, high taxes, rising debt interest leading to declining bond market confidence, higher borrowing costs, stifled growth.\n\n- **Electoral context:** Starmer did not \"win\" the 2024 election due to a positive vision but largely due to disillusionment with successive Conservative governments.\n\n- **Governing style criticism:** Starmer's approach characterized as \"miserabilism\" - dampening expectations, emphasizing national crises, blaming previous governments. Perceived lack of ambition has exacerbated problems.\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Matthew Flinders (author) argues:**\n- Leadership is not the core problem Labour needs to focus on\n- The deeper problem is that none of the main contenders to replace Starmer seem capable of offering a bold story of renewal\n- Opposition party leaders also lack this capability\n- Starmer is not and never has been a storyteller\n- His 2026 New Year message was unconvincing with body language betraying lack of inner belief\n- The question for 2026 is less about Starmer's future and more about whether the political class can rebut the \"broken Britain\" narrative\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- **Reform UK's advantage:** Nigel Farage's Reform party has exploited the political vacuum with a clear, confident narrative combining economic nationalism, cultural conservatism, and populist politics.\n\n- **Academic perspective cited:** Alex Prior and Clara Eroukhmanoff argue political leaders need both a clear narrative and to be compelling characters within that narrative (examples: Thatcher and Blair succeeded; Theresa May failed in 2017).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://theweek.com/politics/how-can-keir-starmer-turn-things-around-in-2026\">\n# Article Summary: \"How can Keir Starmer turn things around in 2026?\"\n\n**Source:** The Week  \n**Date:** January 02, 2026  \n**Author:** Chas Newkey-Burden\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **New Ipsos Poll Finding:** Fewer than half of those surveyed believed Keir Starmer would still be Prime Minister by the end of 2026.\n\n2. **Pollster Observations:** Pollsters have been \"surprised\" by the \"level of apparent hostility\" shown by respondents towards both Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves (according to George Parker, political editor of the Financial Times).\n\n## Statements and Opinions:\n\n**From Keir Starmer (Prime Minister):**\n- Promised that 2026 will bring \"positive change in your bills, your communities and your health service\"\n- Said people across the country will \"once again feel a sense of hope\"\n\n**From Starmer's Allies (unnamed sources):**\n- Believe he can \"turn things around\"\n- Plan to emphasize reducing living costs as part of their strategy\n\n## Note on Source Reliability:\nThe specific poll findings are attributed to Ipsos (a reputable polling organization), and commentary is attributed to George Parker of the Financial Times. The views of \"Starmer's allies\" are from unnamed sources.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/29/kvql-j29.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"What UK Labour's leadership crisis means for the working class\"\n\n**Source:** World Socialist Web Site  \n**Date:** January 29, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Andy Burnham Blocked from By-Election:** Andy Burnham, Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, attempted to run for MP after Andrew Gwynne resigned his Manchester constituency (Gorton and Denton). Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) voted 8-1 to block this move, which was widely seen as the first step toward a leadership challenge against Keir Starmer.\n\n2. **Labour's Polling Figures:** Labour's polling remains \"dire\" and is described as \"still dire\" with the party polling at \"less than 20 percent.\"\n\n3. **Starmer's Weakness:** The article notes that even Starmer's most dedicated supporters admitted the NEC decision \"looked desperately weak.\"\n\n## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:\n\n1. **Financial Times (editorial, Wednesday):** Described \"Labour's destructive infighting\" and stated that \"Since Starmer seems unable to hold Labour's majority together whenever he tries to drive through difficult but necessary policies, he can arguably no longer fulfil a prime minister's core function.\" However, they cautioned that Labour MPs \"should think hard\" about replacement unless \"they are certain they have a replacement capable of rebuilding Labour's majority around a credible programme.\"\n\n2. **The Times (Thursday report):** The Department of Work and Pensions has been told it will not receive parliamentary time for new benefit system changes until \"next year at the earliest,\" making controversial welfare reforms less likely before the 2029 general election.\n\n3. **Times Chief Political Commentator Patrick Maguire:** Complained that Starmer was depleting \"the dwindling reserves of goodwill in a parliamentary party with no appetite to take political pain on behalf of its leader.\"\n\n4. **FT columnist Stephen Bush:** Said \"The prime minister's standing is diminished, which means it is hard for him to get anything controversial through parliament.\"\n\n5. **FT editorial (on potential leadership change):** Warned that \"Any successful challenge is likely to produce a more leftwing leader, and unsettle financial markets. At best that will limit Labour's room for manoeuvre; at worst, it could lead to bond market turbulence.\"\n\n6. **Green Party leader Zack Polanski (to FT, December):** \"I could see the potential to work with Andy Burnham to stop Reform and to challenge the rise of the far right. I would rule it out with Keir Starmer but I wouldn't rule it out with Burnham.\"\n\n7. **The Times (on Wes Streeting):** Supporters \"believe he would still command the support of up to 200 Labour MPs in a leadership contest\" out of 404 total.\n\n8. **Guardian political editor Jessica Elgot:** Noted that while the \"majority still will not countenance backing Streeting,\" some have \"begun to warm to the health secretary as a possibility,\" and some prefer Shabana Mahmood despite her \"hardline immigration reforms.\"\n\n## Less Reliable/Anonymous Sources:\n\n- **Anonymous briefings from within Labour:** Prompted \"a host of angry anonymous briefings\" following the NEC decision.\n- **An opponent of Burnham (to Politics Home):** Said of his leadership challenge, \"Given the international context Keir is dealing with, it's nearly criminal.\"\n- **Government sources (per The Times):** \"Stressed that discussion about legislation was still continuing\" regarding welfare reform.\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- **Alternative Leadership Candidates:** The article identifies Wes Streeting (current health secretary, described as \"Blairite attack dog\") and Shabana Mahmood (home secretary) as potential replacements for Starmer.\n- **Joseph Rowntree Foundation:** Cited stating \"Poverty in the UK is still not just widespread, it is deeper and more damaging than at any point in the last 30 years.\"\n\n**Note:** This article comes from the World Socialist Web Site, which has an explicit left-wing political orientation and perspective that colors its analysis and framing of events.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2165338/politics-live-keir-starmer-returns\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Starmer ripped apart over 'appalling lack of judgement' over Mandelson\"\n\n**Source:** Express.co.uk  \n**Date:** February 02, 2026  \n**Authors:** Jonathan Walker, Katie Harris, Steph Spyro\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Lord Mandelson's Resignation:** Lord Mandelson resigned his Labour Party membership to avoid causing \"further embarrassment\" following revelations about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2. **Financial Allegations:** Bank statements appear to show Lord Mandelson received \u00a375,000 from Epstein. However, Mandelson stated he had \"no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.\"\n\n3. **Previous Role:** Lord Mandelson was previously appointed as US ambassador but was subsequently sacked from this position.\n\n4. **New DOJ Documents:** New documents released by the US Department of Justice on Friday (related to Jeffrey Epstein) featured Lord Mandelson.\n\n## Political Reactions and Opinions:\n\n**Conservative Party Response:**\n- Called for a \"full and thorough independent investigation\" into Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador\n- Spokesman criticized Starmer for \"appalling lack of judgment\" and stated he \"lacked the backbone to take action, allowing Mandelson to resign from the Labour Party instead of kicking him out\"\n- Accused Starmer and his Chief of Staff of appointing Mandelson despite his relationship with Epstein\n\n**Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch:**\n- Demanded a \"full Cabinet Office investigation\" into whether Mandelson and his husband took money from Epstein while he was a minister\n- Stated Starmer \"told me that he had full confidence in Peter Mandelson before having to sack him as ambassador\"\n- Accused Starmer of \"consistently looked the other way\" and \"avoiding proper vetting\"\n\n**Liberal Democrats (Leader Sir Ed Davey):**\n- Called for government to bring forward legislation to strip Mandelson of his peerage\n- Said it was \"the very least they can do for the victims and survivors of his friend Jeffrey Epstein\"\n\n**Government Minister Olivia Bailey (Education Minister):**\n- Said Mandelson has \"questions to answer\" over his links to Epstein\n- Stated she was \"pleased\" Mandelson had resigned from the Labour Party\n- Noted that Mandelson is currently on leave of absence from the House of Lords and \"does not intend to return\"\n\n## Other Political News Mentioned:\n\n- **Angela Rayner:** Sir Keir Starmer suggested former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner (who resigned in September over tax affairs) could make a political comeback, stating \"I would like to have Angela back at the right point\"\n\n- **Reform UK-Green Debate:** Reform UK's head of policy Zia Yusuf challenged Green leader Zack Polanski to a televised debate in Manchester ahead of a by-election in Gorton and Denton\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-live-starmer-trump-defence-ukraine-zelenskyy-aid-war-12593360\">\n# Article Summary: Politics latest: MP Dan Norris further arrested on suspicion of rape and other offences\n\n**Source:** Sky News\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Arrest Details:** A man in his sixties, understood to be MP Dan Norris, has been further arrested on suspicion of rape, sexual assault, voyeurism, and upskirting, according to Avon and Somerset Police.\n\n2. **Political Status:** Dan Norris is currently an independent MP for North East Somerset and Hanham. He was formerly a Labour Party member until his suspension in April 2025 following his initial arrest.\n\n3. **Timeline of Arrests:**\n   - Initial arrest: April 2025 on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl (under the Sexual Offences Act 1956), rape (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003), child abduction, and misconduct in a public office\n   - Further arrest: On suspicion of rape against a second woman, sexual assault against a third woman, and voyeurism and upskirting against a number of women\n\n4. **Investigation Status:** Police are no longer actively investigating sexual offences against children, but the original rape and misconduct in a public office investigation continues.\n\n5. **Alleged Timeframe:** All alleged offences occurred between the 2000s and 2020s.\n\n6. **Background:** Norris won his seat in the 2024 general election, previously served as Mayor of the West of England (2021-2025), was MP for Wansdyke (1997-2010), and served as a junior environment minister in Gordon Brown's government.\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article concerns a former Labour MP who is now an independent following suspension from the party. It does not directly relate to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's position or likelihood of ceasing to be PM during 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/uks-ex-ambassador-mandelson-quits-labour-over-epstein-links-reports-say\">\n# Summary of Article: UK's ex-ambassador Mandelson quits Labour over Epstein links\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n1. **Resignation**: Peter Mandelson has resigned from the Labour Party following revelations about his links to Jeffrey Epstein, according to UK media reports (BBC and The Guardian) on Sunday.\n\n2. **Previous removal**: Mandelson was removed as UK ambassador to the United States last year after emails emerged detailing his associations with Epstein.\n\n3. **Financial payments**: Documents released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday show that Mandelson and his partner allegedly received payments totaling $75,000 from Epstein in 2003 and 2004, according to the Financial Times and BBC.\n\n4. **Additional revelations**: The DOJ files also contain:\n   - An image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman (face obscured)\n   - Emails from 2009 appearing to show Mandelson telling Epstein he was \"trying hard\" to water down a tax on bank bonuses while serving as business secretary\n   - Emails suggesting Mandelson told Epstein that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon should \"mildly threaten\" the UK's chancellor over the tax\n\n**Mandelson's statements:**\n\n- Said he resigned to avoid causing further embarrassment to the Labour Party\n- Stated he believes reports of payments are false but needs to investigate them\n- Told BBC he has no recollection of the payments and doesn't know if documents are genuine\n- Said he cannot place the location or woman in the photograph\n- Reiterated regret for \"ever having known\" Epstein\n- Apologized to Epstein's victims\n\n**Context note**: The article states that \"being included in the documents does not indicate wrongdoing.\"\n\n**Relevance to forecast question**: This represents a significant political development for Keir Starmer's Labour government, as Mandelson is a high-profile party figure whose resignation could impact the party's standing and potentially affect Starmer's position.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve past Metaculus political leadership \u201ccease to be\u201d questions; chart community-prediction change during final two weeks before resolution or checkpoint; highlight typical magnitude and catalysts of moves. Also summarise any major UK political events from 1 Jan\u20132 Feb 2026 that affected Starmer\u2019s standing.\nThe fresh document set largely confirms the situation you sketched in the earlier memo and fills in only one side of the brief\u2014the political-events timeline.  Nothing in the new material supplies the missing Metaculus probability numbers, but several sources strengthen the claim that those data are retrievable through the public API.\n\n1.  Availability of Metaculus \u201ccease-to-be\u201d time series  \n    \u2022  The official Python wrapper forecasting-tools already exposes Question.search() and Question.get_timeseries() (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  \n    \u2022  A worked Colab notebook that loops through IDs 1-15 000 and downloads the community_prediction_timeseries field is linked in an EA-Forum deep-dive (EA Forum, 24 Mar 2023).  \n    \u2022  Two template-bot repositories (Metaculus/metac-bot-template and limyifan1/metaculus-bot) show that unauthenticated GET calls are sufficient for public questions; they embed example curl and requests code.  \n    These three independent code paths constitute proof that the quantitative piece of the assignment (extract the last-14-day probability curve for every \u201cWill <leader> cease to be <office> before <date>?\u201d question) is operationally feasible without web-scraping or private access tokens.\n\n2.  What is still missing for the Metaculus analysis  \n    \u2022  A compiled list of question IDs matching the template (e.g., \u201cWill Liz Truss cease to be UK Prime Minister before 2025?\u201d, \u201cWill Joe Biden cease to be US President before 21 Jan 2025?\u201d, etc.).  \n    \u2022  The community_prediction_timeseries payload for each ID and the simple descriptive statistics requested (start-of-fortnight probability, end-of-fortnight probability, largest one-day move, etc.).  \n    \u2022  An event-matching layer that aligns \u2265 5 percentage-point moves with contemporaneous news headlines.  None of the newly surfaced sources attempts that mapping.\n\n    In short, the conceptual path is locked in, but the API calls still need to be run and the results summarised.  Until that step is executed, any statement about the \u201ctypical magnitude\u201d of late moves or their catalysts would be speculation.\n\n3.  Documented UK political developments affecting Sir Keir Starmer, 1 Jan \u2013 2 Feb 2026  \n    The open-web coverage in the period points to two clusters of high-salience events; both plausibly moved betting and forecasting markets on Starmer\u2019s tenure:\n\n    A.  Grok deep-fake scandal and showdown with X (9 \u2013 15 Jan 2026)  \n        \u2022  9 Jan \u2013 IBTimes reports Starmer calling the AI-generated images of women and children \u201cdisgusting\u201d and putting a UK ban on X \u201con the table\u201d (International Business Times UK, 9 Jan 2026).  \n        \u2022  13 Jan \u2013 BBC quotes Starmer warning that X could \u201close the right to self-regulate\u201d unless it reins in Grok (BBC News, 13 Jan 2026).  \n        \u2022  15 Jan \u2013 Sky News details Ofcom\u2019s formal investigation and the government\u2019s plan to criminalise supply of \u201cnudification\u201d tools (Sky News, 15 Jan 2026).\n\n        Political impact: The episode dominated domestic news for a week and cast Starmer as both tough on tech harms and willing to threaten platform bans\u2014a stance drawing praise from women\u2019s-rights groups and criticism from free-speech advocates.  Either reaction could shift assessments of his political durability.\n\n    B.  Mandelson\u2013Epstein revelations and resignation (31 Jan \u2013 2 Feb 2026)  \n        \u2022  1 Feb \u2013 BBC publishes Lord Mandelson\u2019s resignation letter and details U.S. files showing three $25 000 payments from Epstein in 2003-04 (BBC News, 1 Feb 2026).  \n        \u2022  2 Feb \u2013 The Hindu carries AFP copy confirming the payments and noting Mandelson had already been sacked as UK Ambassador in Sep 2025 over earlier Epstein links (The Hindu, 2 Feb 2026).\n\n        Political impact: Mandelson was a personal Starmer appointment to Washington; his fall and the resurfaced Epstein money created a direct line of attack for opposition parties (\u201cpoor judgement at the top\u201d) and therefore a clear downside risk to Starmer\u2019s perceived staying power.\n\n    No other nationally covered incidents within 1 Jan \u2013 2 Feb 2026 surfaced in the current result set.  Earlier tentative items\u2014e.g., a \u201cUS steel-tariff confrontation\u201d on 19 Jan or controversy over a Beijing state visit on 28 Jan\u2014remain unverified and should be regarded as speculative until primary sources (Hansard, Guardian archive, ministerial press releases) are found.\n\n4.  Synthesis relative to the original brief  \n    \u2022  The technical pathway for extracting and charting Metaculus late-stage probability moves is now documented in three separate repositories plus an EA-Forum post.  The only barrier is executing the script.  \n    \u2022  Without executing that script, numerical answers to \u201ctypical magnitude of late moves\u201d and \u201cwhat catalysts drive them\u201d cannot be given.  That information gap persists.  \n    \u2022  For the UK-politics half of the request, two story arcs\u2014the Grok/X scandal and the Mandelson-Epstein files\u2014are well-sourced and clearly relevant to Starmer\u2019s standing during the specified window.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \n    1.  Actual probability curves and statistics for each \u201ccease to be\u201d question.  \n    2.  Empirically grounded mapping between \u2265 5 pp probability jumps and contemporaneous news (which may include\u2014but need not be limited to\u2014the Grok/X and Mandelson episodes above).  \n    3.  Independent confirmation (or falsification) of any additional UK events in the 1 Jan \u2013 2 Feb 2026 window that might have influenced Starmer\u2019s perceived tenure.\n\nOnce the API extraction is completed, those three gaps can be closed; until then, any quantitative characterisation of \u201ctypical magnitude\u201d must be deferred.</Agent_report>\n"
