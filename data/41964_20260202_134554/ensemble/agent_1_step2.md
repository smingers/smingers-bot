Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Summary Sources (from context):**

1. **Ycharts/Philadelphia Fed (Nov 20, 2025)**: High-quality institutional source. Shows Q1 2026 forecast of 1.35% for 3-month T-bill rates - but this appears to be an error or different metric, as it's dramatically below actual current levels of 3.67%. **Factual data but potentially measuring different instrument or contains error.**

2. **Financial Forecast Center (Jan 6, 2026)**: Self-described AI forecaster. Predicts February 2026 at 3.37% (±0.10). **Weak credibility - no methodology disclosed, promotional nature.**

3. **CNBC Quote Page**: Real-time data showing 3.661% yield. **High-quality factual source for current levels.**

4. **CRFB Article (May 6, 2025)**: Shows 3-month yields declined from 5.0% (Sept 2024) to 4.3% (May 2025). **Historical context only, outdated.**

5. **BlackRock (2025)**: Fed projections of 3.4% by end 2026, 3.1% by end 2027. **Credible institutional opinion but refers to fed funds rate, not 3-month Treasury.**

6. **Statista (July 16, 2025)**: Focuses on 10-year yields, not 3-month. **Not directly relevant.**

**AskNews Articles:**

1. **Korean article (Feb 2, 2026)**: Discusses foreign Treasury holdings and supply dynamics. **Moderate evidence - structural factors affecting yields generally.**

2. **Indian bond yields (Feb 2, 2026)**: Rising yields due to borrowing concerns. **Weak evidence - different market.**

3. **Multiple European/UAE bond auctions (Jan-Feb 2026)**: Shows global debt issuance patterns. **Weak evidence - indirect.**

4. **U.S. 3-Month Bill Auction Results**:
   - Jan 26, 2026: 3.580% (down from 3.590%)
   - Dec 22, 2025: 3.560% (unchanged)
   - Dec 1, 2025: 3.725% (down from 3.745%)
   - Nov 24, 2025: 3.745% (down from 3.795%)
   - Sept 8, 2025: 3.940% (down from 4.045%)
   
   **Strong evidence - official auction data showing declining trend from ~4.0% in Sept to ~3.58% in late Jan.**

5. **10-year and 30-year yield increases (Jan 30, 2026)**: 10-year at 4.240%, 30-year at 4.872%. **Moderate evidence - shows longer-term yields rising while short-term stable.**

6. **Deep Research Analysis on Fed/Warsh transition**: Discusses uncertainty around Fed chair transition, projects 3-month yield declining to 3.25-3.75% range by end-2026. **Moderate evidence - expert synthesis but high uncertainty acknowledged.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current level: 3.67%** (Trading Economics, Feb 2) - factual, authoritative
- **Recent auction: 3.580%** (Jan 26) - official Treasury data showing slight downward trend
- **Fed funds range: 3.50-3.75%** - structural anchor for 3-month yields
- **Fed on hold** - no meeting until March 17-18, removes policy catalyst

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Monthly trend: +0.06%** over past month - suggests modest upward drift but small sample
- **Longer-term declining trend**: Sept 2025 (3.94%) → Jan 2026 (3.58%) in auctions
- **Yield curve dynamics**: 10-year rising while short-term stable suggests steepening, not parallel shift
- **Q1 2026 forecast: 3.65%** (Trading Economics) - unattributed model but directionally consistent

**Weak Evidence:**
- Financial Forecast Center prediction of 3.37% - no credible methodology
- Philadelphia Fed forecast of 1.35% - appears erroneous or measuring different instrument
- Global bond market dynamics - indirect impact on U.S. 3-month bills
- Fed chair transition uncertainty - unlikely to impact 3-month yields in 8-day window

**Critical Reconciliation:**
The auction data (most recent: 3.580% on Jan 26) vs. secondary market quote (3.67% on Feb 2) shows a 9bp differential. This could reflect:
1. Auction vs. secondary market pricing differences
2. Upward drift in the week since auction
3. Different measurement methodologies

The 3.67% secondary market level appears more relevant for Feb 10 prediction as it's the most current.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window: 8 days (Feb 2 → Feb 10, 2026)**

**If halved to 4 days:**
- Extremely tight range expected: ±5-8 basis points
- Distribution would narrow significantly around 3.65-3.70%
- P10-P90 range might compress to 3.60-3.75%

**If doubled to 16 days:**
- Would cross into mid-February with potential for:
  - Early economic data releases (CPI, retail sales)
  - Fed speaker commentary ahead of March meeting
  - Greater technical/positioning adjustments
- P10-P90 range might widen to 3.35-3.90%
- Central tendency could shift toward 3.60% if declining auction trend continues

**Key Timeframe Considerations:**
- 8 days is long enough for minor technical adjustments but short enough that structural factors dominate
- No major scheduled catalysts in this window
- Weekly auction cycle means one potential data point (likely Feb 9 or 10)

## (d) Justification for Distribution

**Starting from Outside View (3.42-3.85% range):**

**Factors warranting UPWARD adjustment from outside view:**
1. **Current level (3.67%) is ABOVE recent auction (3.580%)**: The 9bp premium suggests secondary market is pricing in either:
   - Continued modest upward drift seen in past month (+6bp)
   - Risk premium vs. auction clearing levels
   - Technical factors (supply/demand imbalances)

2. **Recent monthly trend is UP (+6bp)**: While longer-term trend is down, the most recent momentum matters for 8-day forecast

3. **Longer yields rising**: 10-year up 8.8bp in January suggests term premium expansion, which could keep short-term yields elevated

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD adjustment:**
1. **Auction trend clearly declining**: Sept (3.94%) → Nov (3.75%) → Dec (3.73%) → Jan (3.58%) shows persistent downward pressure
2. **Fed on hold with easing bias**: Market expects eventual cuts, creating downward pull
3. **3.67% is above fed funds midpoint (3.625%)**: Typically reverts toward midpoint during stable periods

**Synthesis:**
The tension is between:
- **Short-term momentum** (upward: +6bp monthly, secondary market premium)
- **Medium-term trend** (downward: auction trajectory, Fed easing expectations)

For an 8-day forecast, short-term factors should dominate, but the strong auction trend warrants keeping probability mass in the 3.50-3.65% range.

**Adjustment to Outside View:**
- Shift central tendency UP slightly from 3.64-3.69% to 3.66-3.70% to reflect current 3.67% level
- Keep lower tail at 3.45-3.55% to reflect auction trend continuation
- Extend upper tail to 3.90% to account for potential risk-off or supply pressure

Probability calibration:

**Central Scenario (60% probability): 3.62-3.75%**
- 3-month yield remains anchored near current 3.67% level
- Minor fluctuations within ±8bp range
- Fed funds rate (3.50-3.75%) continues to provide floor/ceiling
- No major surprises in 8-day window

**Downside Scenario (25% probability): 3.45-3.62%**
- Auction trend continues, pulling secondary market down
- Technical factors or modest flight-to-quality
- Convergence toward recent auction level (3.58%)
- Would require some catalyst (weak economic data, geopolitical event)

**Upside Scenario (15% probability): 3.75-3.95%**
- Continuation of recent upward drift accelerates
- Supply pressure from Treasury issuance
- Risk-off moves pushing longer yields up, dragging short-term
- Less likely given Fed on hold and no immediate catalysts

**Distribution Construction:**

**P1 (3.35%)**: Extreme downside - major flight-to-quality event, sharp risk-off
**P5 (3.48%)**: Significant downside - auction trend accelerates, technical breakdown
**P10 (3.54%)**: Modest downside - convergence toward auction levels begins
**P20 (3.60%)**: Below current but within recent range
**P40 (3.66%)**: Slight decline from current 3.67%
**P60 (3.70%)**: Slight increase, continuation of recent drift
**P80 (3.77%)**: Upper end of likely range, sustained upward pressure
**P90 (3.84%)**: Significant upside - supply pressure or risk premium expansion
**P95 (3.91%)**: Major upside - unexpected hawkish repricing
**P99 (4.05%)**: Extreme upside - major market dislocation

**Key Calibration Points:**
- Median (P50) ≈ 3.68%: Slightly above current to reflect upward drift bias
- Mean ≈ 3.69%: Close to median, slight right skew from tail risk
- 80% confidence interval: 3.60-3.77% (17bp range, consistent with 8-day volatility)
- Mode ≈ 3.67-3.70%: Cluster around current level

Checklist:

1. **Target**: DGS3MO value on Feb 10, 2026 (8 days out), units = percent
   ✓ Analysis focused on 3-month Treasury yield, correct timeframe

2. **Outside view base**: 3.42-3.85% (±15-25bp from current 3.67%)
   ✓ Final prediction (3.35-4.05% at P1-P99) rooted in this base, widened slightly for tail risk

3. **Consistency**: Implied median ≈ 3.68%; mean ≈ 3.69%
   ✓ Makes sense - slight increase from current 3.67% reflecting recent upward drift

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Current secondary market: 3.67% (factual, Feb 2)
   - Recent auction: 3.580% (factual, Jan 26)  
   - Fed funds range: 3.50-3.75% (factual anchor)
   - Monthly trend: +6bp upward (factual but short sample)
   - Auction trend: declining from 3.94% (Sept) to 3.58% (Jan) (factual, strong pattern)
   ✓ All verified from authoritative sources

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected Treasury auction announcement or supply shock in 8-day window could push yields UP sharply (toward 4%+), violating assumption of stable technical environment. Alternatively, surprise Fed speaker signaling faster cuts could push DOWN toward 3.4%.
