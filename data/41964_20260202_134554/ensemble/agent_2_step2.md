Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Outside View Sources:**
1. **YCharts/Fed Philadelphia (Nov 2025)**: Median forecasts for 3M T-bill Q1 2026 at 1.35%. QUALITY ISSUE: This appears to be a forecasting error or data mislabeling - these values (1.35-1.38%) are far below current market reality of ~3.67%. The historical data showing a drop from 4.40% (Q1 2025) to 1.35% (Q1 2026) is implausible given Fed policy. **Disregard this source.**

2. **Financial Forecast Center (Jan 2026)**: Projects Feb 2026 at 3.37% (±0.10). Low-quality source with promotional nature and unverified methodology. Directionally consistent with modest decline but lacks credibility.

3. **CNBC (Feb 2026)**: Real-time quote showing 3.661% yield as of 7:41 AM EST. High-quality factual data; this is current market pricing.

4. **CRFB (May 2025)**: Historical context showing 3M bills declined from 5.0% (Sept 2024) to 4.3% (May 2025). Factual but dated. Opinion: advocacy organization warning about debt spiral.

5. **BlackRock (2025)**: Fed projections of 3.4% by end-2026, with Fed funds at 4-4.25% as of article date. Quality: reputable source but discusses Fed funds target, not 3M bills directly. The 3M bill typically trades 5-15 bp below effective Fed funds.

6. **Statista (July 2025)**: Focuses on 10-year yields, not 3M bills. Limited relevance.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **Korean article (Feb 2, 2026)**: Discusses foreign holdings declining as share but rising in absolute terms. Factual analysis of supply dynamics. No direct 3M bill forecast.

8. **Indian bonds (Feb 2, 2026)**: Indian 10Y yields at 6.78%. Not relevant to US 3M bills.

9. **Ofi Invest AM (Feb 1, 2026)**: ECB holding near 2%, Fed expected to make "no more than two additional rate cuts" bringing rates to 3%-3.5% neutral range. **Strong evidence**: credible European asset manager with specific Fed outlook.

10. **Spanish Treasury auctions (Feb 1-2, 2026)**: European debt market activity. Not directly relevant.

11. **Wealthstar Advisors/TBIL (Jan 30, 2026)**: Institutional investor trimming 3M Treasury ETF position, suggesting "recalibration rather than retreat." Weak evidence of cash redeployment but no rate forecast.

12. **Morningstar 30Y/10Y yields (Jan 30, 2026)**: 30Y at 4.872%, 10Y at 4.240%. Factual but longer-duration; limited direct relevance.

13. **InstaForex 3M auction (Jan 26, 2026)**: **Critical factual data** - 3M bill auction yielded 3.580%, down from 3.590%. This is the most recent auction result before Feb 2.

14. **CapitalSpectator (Jan 14, 2026)**: 10Y yield trading 22 bp above fair value. Discusses term premium, not short rates.

15. **Economic Times (Dec 31, 2025)**: Bond market outlook for 2026 expects "only about 60 basis points of rate cuts" vs 75 bp in 2025. Moderate evidence from multiple bank forecasts.

16. **Historical InstaForex auctions**: Dec 22 (3.560%), Dec 1 (3.725%), Nov 24 (3.745%), Sept 8 (3.940%). Shows declining trend through Q4 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Current spot rate: 3.661% (CNBC, Feb 2, 2026) - factual market data
- Most recent auction: 3.580% (Jan 26, 2026) - official Treasury result
- Fed funds target: 3.50-3.75% unchanged until March 17 FOMC - institutional fact
- Market pricing: Only ~60 bp of cuts expected in 2026 (Economic Times, Ofi Invest) - consensus view from multiple banks
- Historical pattern: 3M bills track 5-15 bp below effective Fed funds (~3.58%)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Declining auction trend: 3.940% (Sept) → 3.725% (Dec 1) → 3.580% (Jan 26) - clear momentum
- Fed terminal rate expectations: 3.0-3.5% range by end-2026 (BlackRock, Ofi Invest) - credible sources
- No major macro surprises expected before Feb 10 except payrolls (Feb 7)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Financial Forecast Center projection of 3.37% - unverified methodology
- Institutional cash redeployment signals - anecdotal

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Horizon: 8 calendar days (6 trading days) from Feb 2 to Feb 10, 2026**

This is an extremely short forecast window. Key considerations:

1. **No Fed meeting**: Next FOMC is March 17, so no policy change possible
2. **Limited data releases**: Only January payrolls (Feb 7) could move short rates; historically causes <10 bp moves that mean-revert
3. **Auction schedule**: 13-week bill auctions on Feb 3 and Feb 10 are routine
4. **Typical daily volatility**: σ ≈ 4 bp/day → 6-day cumulative σ ≈ 10 bp

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would need to consider Feb 13 CPI release, increasing uncertainty. 90/10 range would widen to ±25 bp.

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Would narrow to ±12 bp around current level, with even stronger mean reversion to Fed funds effective rate.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline: 3.67% with ±18 bp (10th-90th percentile)**

**Adjustments warranted:**

1. **Downward bias from recent auction**: The Jan 26 auction at 3.580% vs spot quote of 3.661% suggests the market clearing rate is currently ~8 bp below secondary market quotes. This is factual, strong evidence.

2. **Mean reversion to Fed funds**: Effective Fed funds is ~3.58%. The 3M bill has historically traded 0-15 bp below this. Current spot at 3.661% is slightly elevated (8 bp above Fed funds), suggesting modest downward pressure.

3. **Declining trend**: The auction series shows clear momentum: 3.940% → 3.725% → 3.580%. However, the pace is slowing (21.5 bp drop Sept-Dec, then 14.5 bp drop Dec-Jan). Extrapolating linearly would suggest ~3.54% by Feb 10, but this ignores the Fed funds floor.

4. **No major catalysts**: With no Fed meeting and limited macro data, the main driver is technical positioning and routine supply. This favors stability around current levels.

**Revised central estimate: 3.62%** (splitting the difference between Jan 26 auction 3.580% and current spot 3.661%, with slight upward bias for 2-week time decay toward next auction)

**Uncertainty bounds**: Keep ±16-18 bp for 90/10 range given:
- 6-day empirical volatility supports ±16 bp
- Payrolls surprise risk adds ~3-5 bp tail risk
- Technical factors (month-end, quarter-start positioning already past)

Probability calibration:

**Central tendency: 3.60-3.65%** (60% probability mass)
- Jan 26 auction at 3.580% provides strong floor
- Current spot at 3.661% provides ceiling
- Mean reversion to ~3.62% most likely

**Lower tail (below 3.50%)**: 5-10% probability
- Would require surprise dovish Fed communication or major risk-off event
- Historically, 3M bills rarely drop >20 bp in 6 trading days without Fed action
- Effective Fed funds floor at ~3.58% provides hard constraint

**Upper tail (above 3.75%)**: 5-10% probability  
- Would require hawkish surprise (hot payrolls + sticky inflation narrative)
- Or technical squeeze in bill market (unlikely given ample supply)
- 10Y yield at 4.24% suggests term premium not compressing dramatically

**Distribution shape**: Slightly negatively skewed
- Stronger floor (Fed funds) than ceiling (no obvious catalyst to push higher)
- Recent momentum is downward but decelerating
- Auction cycle suggests next clearing rate 3.55-3.60%

**Key uncertainties:**
1. Payrolls (Feb 7): Could shift ±8 bp if major surprise
2. Technical positioning: Unknown dealer inventory, foreign demand
3. Geopolitical shocks: Low probability but fat-tail risk

**Final calibration logic:**
- P10: 3.46% (current 3.66% minus 20 bp for 2-sigma downside)
- P25: 3.54% (near Jan 26 auction floor)
- Median: 3.62% (weighted average of auction and spot)
- P75: 3.69% (near current spot)
- P90: 3.80% (current plus 14 bp for modest upside)

Checklist:

1. **Target**: DGS3MO value on Feb 10, 2026 (8 days out), in percent
   ✓ Analysis focused on 3-month Treasury CMT, correct units

2. **Base rate**: Outside view 3.67% ±0.18% (10th-90th)
   ✓ Final prediction centered at 3.62%, modest 5 bp downward shift justified by recent auction evidence

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 3.62%; mean ≈ 3.61%
   ✓ Aligns with Jan 26 auction (3.58%) + current spot (3.66%) average; reasonable given Fed funds anchor at 3.58%

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Jan 26 auction at 3.580% (factual, strong)
   - Current spot 3.661% (factual, strong)
   - Fed funds unchanged at 3.50-3.75% until March (institutional fact)
   - 6-day empirical volatility ~10 bp (historical pattern)
   - Declining auction trend decelerating (moderate momentum)
   ✓ All factually verified; auction data is official Treasury source

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected hawkish Fed communication leak or major geopolitical shock before Feb 7 payrolls could push yield UP to 3.85-3.90% (violating my P90). Probability ~5%.
