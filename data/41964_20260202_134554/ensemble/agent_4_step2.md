Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (abridged)
1. CNBC quote page (Feb 2 2026, 07:41 EST) – factual real-time spot: 3-month bill 3.661 %. High-quality for current level; no forward view.
2. TradingEconomics (pulled Feb 2 2026) – spot 3.67 %, model forecast 3.65 % end-Q1. Moderate quality, methodology opaque.
3. US Treasury methodology note – explains DGS3MO is 15:00-15:30 bid quote spline; primary, timeless.
4. Jan 26 2026 bill auction (InstaForex relay of Treasury data) – 3.580 % stop-out, shows demand still firm; factual, moderate quality (secondary but from primary release).
5. Bankrate recap of Jan 29 FOMC – target 3.50–3.75 %, policy on hold; factual, high quality.
6. AskNews analyst synthesis – consensus sees only 25–50 bp cuts by year-end; moderate evidence of expectations.
7. Morningstar “Data Talk” – 10- and 30-year yields drifted up about 5–9 bp in Jan; factual, low relevance but signals mild upward pressure.

(b) Evidence weighting
Strong: current spot 3.66 %, Fed target 3.50–3.75 % (structural anchor), no FOMC before Feb 10.
Moderate: recent bill auction 3.58 % (implies bid side < spot), slight upward drift in longer rates (supply concerns).
Weak: AI forecast site saying February average 3.37 % (poor track record).

Net: small downward pull from auction/expectations, small upward pull from deficit/supply; neither overwhelms.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Horizon = 8 calendar / 6 trading days. Front-end daily σ ≈ 4 bp; 6-day σ ≈ 10 bp. If horizon halved, σ ~7 bp; if doubled, σ ~14 bp and macro releases (CPI, February FOMC minutes) would matter more.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view median = current level 3.66 %.
Data-driven drift expectation = −2 bp (slightly softer after NFP if labor market cools) → inside-view median 3.64 %.
Add 80 %-range of ±0.18 % (≈2× expected σ plus fat tails). Asymmetric right tail (supply shock, hot payrolls) so upper tail slightly fatter.

Probability calibration

Implied median = 3.64 %; mean ~3.66 % (fatter right tail). Distribution matches 6-day volatility history and qualitative risks.

Checklist:
1. Target: Daily FRED series DGS3MO yield on 2026-02-10, percent.
2. Outside view median 3.66 %.
3. Consistency check OK: median 3.64, mean 3.66, coherent with justification.
4. Key evidence: a) Spot 3.66 % today. b) Fed target 3.50–3.75 %, no meeting before 2-10. c) Recent bill auction 3.58 %. d) Consensus only gradual cuts in 2026. e) Mild upward pressure from heavy Treasury supply.
5. Blind-spot: Non-farm payrolls shock >350k with wage spike could lift yields >30 bp quickly (pushes outcome up).
