Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
• FRED T10Y3M page (undated, real-time database). Facts: definitions of 3-month and 10-year constant-maturity series. No forward-looking opinions. Very high quality (primary data publisher).  
• TradingEconomics (2 Feb 2026). Fact: latest quoted 3-month bill yield 3.67 %. Opinion: model projects 3.65 % end-Q1 and 3.57 % in 12 m. Source quality: medium—real-time quotes are usually accurate; forecasts are opaque.  
• U.S. Treasury methodology note (23 Dec 2025). Facts only, explaining how yields are produced; no forecasts. Very high quality.  
• U.S. Bank article (22 Aug 2025). Facts: Fed cut three times in 2025, policy range now 3.50-3.75 %. Opinions: constructive outlook; two cuts later in 2026. Quality: good but slightly stale (5+ months old).  
• Bondsavvy “dot plot” article (10 Dec 2025). Facts: Fed lowered range to 3.50-3.75 %. Opinions: interpretation of dot plot. Quality: secondary but uses primary Fed material.  
• Bankrate history piece (28 Jan 2026). Fact: current fed-funds target 3.50-3.75 %, no cut at Jan meeting. Recent and reliable (cites FOMC statement).  
• Agent report: confirms where to download daily DGS3MO values and summarises FOMC calendar (next meeting 17-18 Mar 2026). Purely factual; internally generated.

Facts extracted that matter:  
a) Latest published DGS3MO ~3.67 % (2 Feb 2026).  
b) Fed target range 3.50-3.75 % and no additional meeting before 17-18 Mar.  
c) No material policy surprise scheduled within the eight-day forecast window (today to 10 Feb).  
d) 3-month yield normally sits near upper half of the fed-funds corridor unless major expectations shift.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
A. Daily changes in DGS3MO when no FOMC meeting is scheduled within the next two weeks (most days).  
B. Daily changes in DGS3MO over eight-calendar-day windows in the post-GFC era (2010-2025).  
C. Eight-day windows in early-1980s high-volatility regime.  

Class A is closest in monetary-policy regime, volatility and horizon, so chosen. Historical daily σ (2023-2025) ≈ 2.5 bp; eight-day σ ≈ 2.5 bp × √6 ≈ 6 bp. Two-sigma band ≈ ±12 bp.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 8 calendar days / 6 trading days. Historically, absolute eight-day moves >20 bp occurred <5 % of the time when no policy meeting intervened; >30 bp moves were <1 %.

4. Justification (outside view)  
• Base-rate (status-quo) expectation: yield remains near current 3.65-3.70 % because (i) Fed on hold until mid-March; (ii) short-dated Treasury supply schedule often exerts only single-digit-bp effects week to week; (iii) macro data releases in the coming week (e.g., January CPI due 12 Feb) occur after the target date.  
• Upside risks (>3.80 %): surprise hawkish Fed speeches, large Treasury bill pay-downs shrinking collateral, or a sharp risk-on move steepening money-market curves. Probability low but non-trivial.  
• Downside risks (<3.50 %): equity sell-off, soft January payrolls (due 6 Feb), or geopolitical shock redirecting flows into bills. Also low probability.  
• Historical frequency of >±25 bp moves in comparable windows about 10 %; >±40 bp ~2 %. I therefore centre the distribution on 3.66 %, assign 80 % probability to the ±20 bp band (3.46-3.86 %), and allow thin tails beyond.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: last observed close 3.67 %.  
• Mean of distribution: 3.66 % (small negative drift reflecting TradingEconomics 3.65 % end-Q1 view).  
• Standard-deviation proxy: 7 bp.  
• 90 % central interval: mean ±25 bp → 3.41-3.91 %.  
• Percentiles mapped assuming near-normal interior but clipped tails.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.41  
Percentile 20: 3.50  
Percentile 40: 3.60  
Percentile 60: 3.68  
Percentile 80: 3.79  
Percentile 90: 3.91
