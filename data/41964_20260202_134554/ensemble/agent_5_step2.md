Analysis:

1. Clarify the target variable  
   • Daily FRED series DGS3MO (percent, to two decimals) for the observation dated 2026-02-10 (the close of business that day).

2. Source analysis (facts vs. opinions, quality, date)  
   a. CNBC quote page (02 Feb 2026, intraday): factual ­– latest 3-month bill yield 3.661. Very reliable for current level.  
   b. Treasury bill auction results (InstaForex wires 26 Jan 2026 and 22 Dec 2025): factual numbers (3.580 / 3.560). Primary data relayed by a secondary site; good for trend, not for methodology.  
   c. Morningstar “Data Talk” pieces on 10- and 30-year yields (30 Jan 2026): factual but longer-maturity only – minor relevance.  
   d. TradingEconomics live page (02 Feb 2026, not in prompt but checked): factual current 3-month = 3.67, opaque model forecasts. Facts strong, outlook weak.  
   e. Y-Charts / Philadelphia Fed survey (Nov 2025): forecast Q1-2026 average 1.35. Badly out-of-date and already proven wrong – discounted.  
   f. Financial Forecast Center (06 Jan 2026): predicts February average 3.37. Opaque AI method; moderate weight.  
   g. News flow on foreign holdings, Spanish / Indian debt, UAE sukuk, etc.: largely irrelevant to the 8-day horizon; ignored for magnitude but confirms no global shock.  
   Overall: the only high-quality, up-to-the-minute data are the current yield itself and the recent Treasury bill auctions. No authoritative forecast shows a huge move within a week.

3. Evidence weighting  
   Strong:  
   • Structural anchor – 3-month bill trades inside the Fed-funds corridor (3.50-3.75) unless policy expectations shift sharply.  
   • No FOMC meeting or major scheduled Fed speech before 10 Feb.  
   Moderate:  
   • Payrolls (06 Feb) can wiggle short-rate expectations a few basis points.  
   • Treasury bill supply schedule can move yields single-digit bp.  
   Weak:  
   • One-off geopolitical or market-stress events (very low but non-zero probability within 6 trading days).  
   • Third-party model forecasts (3.37) – methodology opaque.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   Horizon = 8 calendar / 6 trading days.  
   Post-GFC daily σ for DGS3MO when the Fed is on hold ≈ 2.5 bp; 6-day σ ≈ 6 bp. Moves >20 bp in such windows occur <10 % of the time; >30 bp ~1 %.  
   If the horizon were halved, σ ↓ to ~4 bp; doubled, σ ↑ to ~9 bp, widening the percentile spread by roughly 50 %.

5. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   • Start with outside-view median = last close 3.67.  
   • Small downward drift bias (market still prices ~50 bp of cuts by year-end) → subtract 1 bp.  
   • Retain historical σ = 7 bp to allow for data surprises.  
   • Allow a thin tail for >25 bp up- or down-moves (black-swans).  

   Resulting mean ≈ 3.66, 90 % central band ≈ 3.41-3.91.

Probability calibration

Distribution parameters: mean 3.66, σ 0.07, clipped with 2 % total tail probability beyond ±25 bp, then converted to the required percentiles.

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Target: DGS3MO % on 2026-02-10 – yes.  
2. Outside view median 3.67 anchored, adjusted to 3.66 – yes.  
3. Implied median = 3.66, mean = 3.66 – consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Current yield 3.661 (fact).  
   • Fed target 3.50-3.75, no meeting before 10 Feb (fact).  
   • Recent bill auctions 3.56-3.58 (fact, trend flat/down).  
   • Payrolls risk 06 Feb could swing yields ±5-10 bp (probable).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden risk-off shock (e.g., major geopolitical event) pushing bills below 3.30 – would make forecast too high.
