The series DGS3MO is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the market yield on US treasury securities at 3-month constant maturity, quoted on an investment basis. The title of the series is \"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 3-Month Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-01-29 and has a value of 3.67. The units of the series are \"Percent\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3MO).
