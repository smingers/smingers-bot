Analysis:
The value of the 3-month Treasury yield on 10 Feb 2026 will depend mainly on:  
• Current level and very-near-term path of the federal-funds rate (market expectations of the March 2026 FOMC meeting, potential January–February surprises).  
• Treasury bill supply/demand factors (early-February bill auctions, debt-ceiling considerations, Treasury refunding announcement released 5 Feb 2026).  
• Macroeconomic data released between now and 10 Feb 2026 (January payrolls on 6 Feb, CPI on 7 Feb) that could move short-rate expectations.  
Relevant information therefore includes:  
1. Real-time quotes and forecasts of the 3-month T-bill yield or the ICE/Bloomberg 3-month index.  
2. News stories or analysis pieces from major banks and financial media discussing expectations for near-term Treasury-bill yields or the front end of the curve following the 28-Jan-2026 FOMC meeting and in advance of the 19-Mar-2026 meeting.  
3. Coverage of the Treasury Quarterly Refunding and bill auction schedule (which can add upward pressure on the yield).  

Current articles from financial wires (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, FT) and bank research notes released in the past few days are most useful, so the searches focus on “forecast”, “outlook”, or “expect” rather than historic studies.
