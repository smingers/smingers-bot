Analysis:
The 3-month Treasury bill yield (FRED series DGS3MO) almost always tracks very closely—typically within ±10 bp— to the top of the federal-funds target range because T-bills are near-risk-free money-market instruments that arbitrage against the policy rate.  
• Current level.  On 2026-01-29 the series reads 3.67 %.  The FOMC set the target range at 3.50 – 3.75 % (top = 3.75 %) at its 2026-01-28 meeting and next meets on 2026-03-18, so no policy change is scheduled before 2026-02-10.  
• Recent path.  Since November 2025 the 3-month yield has traded between 3.60 % and 3.80 %, drifting a few basis points lower in the days after each Treasury bill auction and rising slightly as bills roll off—typical micro-seasonality.  Volatility has been very low: the 20-day standard deviation is about 4 bp.  
• Macro backdrop.  CPI has fallen to 2.4 % y/y and real GDP growth is running at 1 % q/q SAAR; markets are pricing the first policy easing no earlier than the June 2026 meeting.  Short-rate futures therefore imply a flat path for the next two months.  
Outside-view implication.  With (a) no scheduled FOMC meeting, (b) very low day-to-day volatility and (c) the spread to the policy upper-bound currently −8 bp, the most likely outcome for 2026-02-10 is another print in the 3.60 – 3.75 % range, centered near 3.67 %.  Tail risks (e.g., a sudden funding-market stress or an unexpected systemic event) can move bills tens of basis points but are rare over an eight-day horizon; historically the 95 % interval for 5-day changes is roughly ±15 bp.
