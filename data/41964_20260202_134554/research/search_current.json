However, this perception is based on a misunderstanding. While the percentage share has declined, the absolute amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by foreign entities increased from $6.8 trillion in December 2019 to $9.4 trillion by November 2025\u2014a rise of $2.6 trillion (38.2%). The decline in share is due to a faster increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, which totaled $9.9 trillion over the same period, driven by pandemic-related fiscal stimulus and rising debt service costs. As a result, the growing supply of U.S. debt has put downward pressure on bond prices and upward pressure on market interest rates, making supply dynamics more influential than interest rate policy in determining market yields. The article concludes that monitoring the scale and maturity structure of new bond issuance is now as critical as central bank rate decisions.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:18 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/1242950.html)\n\n**Budget impact: Indian government bond yields hit highest in one year. How can it affect stock market | Stock Market News**\nOn February 2, 2026, Indian government bond yields rose by 8 basis points (bps) following the government's announcement of higher-than-expected gross borrowing, with the 10-year benchmark bond yield reaching 6.78%, the highest since January 17, 2025. The yield had started at 6.740% and closed at 6.778%, up from 6.696% the previous day. The Union Budget for FY27 estimates gross market borrowings at \u20b917.2 lakh crore, a 16% increase from the current year\u2019s budget estimate, with net market borrowing projected at \u20b911.7 lakh crore to cover a fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP. According to Nomura Holdings Inc. and ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, yields could rise to 7% in the coming weeks. Despite Reserve Bank of India (RBI) market intervention, yields have increased due to high state government bond issuance and declining demand from pension and insurance funds. Alok Sharma, treasury chief at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Mumbai, stated in a Bloomberg report that the central bank must increase bond purchases to enhance liquidity and stabilize yields, warning that 'proactive management of liquidity will be necessary, or yields will only continue to rise.' The rising borrowing costs add pressure on an economy already facing significant US tariffs and constrained by limited scope for further interest rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:56 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/bonds/budget-impact-indian-government-bond-yields-hit-highest-in-one-year-how-can-it-affect-stock-market-11770006704588.html)\n\n**Ofi Invest AM: On the Bond Market, It's Better to Stay Cautious**\nIn 2025, global bond markets delivered strong returns, with the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index rising above 8%, driven primarily by macroeconomic data such as growth, inflation, unemployment, and monetary policy. U.S. bonds outperformed European bonds, partly due to the euro's 12% depreciation against the dollar. Despite this rally, Ofi Invest AM advises caution for 2026, noting that major central banks have signaled their monetary policy intentions: the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain interest rates near 2% for the next 12 months, the U.S. Federal Reserve is projected to make no more than two additional rate cuts\u2014bringing rates to a neutral range of 3%-3.5%\u2014and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may implement temporary rate hikes. Ofi Invest AM maintains a neutral stance on 10-year bonds, expecting yields to remain within a range of 2.60% to 3.10% for German Bunds, with adjustments to duration based on market conditions. The firm highlights ongoing risks from fiscal and geopolitical factors, especially given heightened tensions following a second Trump presidency, which were downplayed in 2025 but could grow in 2026. Additional risks include Germany\u2019s high bond issuance, the Netherlands\u2019 new pension reform, and potential upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. Despite an overall reduction in market risks\u2014due to central bank vigilance, the end of peak tariffs, and strong corporate refinancing\u2014Ofi Invest AM remains cautious, advocating for selectivity in credit exposure, a positive outlook on high-yield bonds in the medium term, but caution on potential spread widening in adverse scenarios.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:08 PM\nSource:[Borsa italiana](https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/notizie/radiocor/finanza/dettaglio/ofi-invest-am-sul-mercato-obbligazionario-e--meglio-rimanere-prudenti-parola-al-mercato-nRC_01022026_1429_315493149.html)\n\n**Spanish Treasury Returns to Debt Markets Next Week with Auctions of Bills, Bonds, and Obligations**\nThe Spanish Treasury (Tesoro P\u00fablico) will return to debt markets next week with two auctions: one for six- and twelve-month Treasury bills on Tuesday, February 3, and another for state bonds and obligations on Thursday, February 5, marking the start of February's issuance.

This reduced the fund's quarter-end holding value by $6.46 million, accounting for both trading activity and price movement. TBIL now represents 0.2% of Wealthstar Advisors' 13F reportable assets under management (AUM). The ETF tracks the most recently issued 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill, offering daily liquidity, capital preservation, and minimal interest rate and credit risk through a monthly rollover strategy. The trim suggests a strategic reassessment of cash positioning rather than a defensive move, indicating that excess liquidity may be redeployed into other assets. The firm continues to hold significant exposure to longer-duration and credit-sensitive fixed income and equities, signaling a recalibration rather than a retreat. The action reflects a shift in cash strategy, particularly in an environment where normalized yields increase the opportunity cost of holding idle cash. According to The Motley Fool, such moves in ultra-short Treasury ETFs are typically about sequencing rather than conviction on rates or credit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:14 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/coverage/filings/2026/01/31/why-this-usd6-million-trim-of-a-3-month-treasury-etf-might-signal-a-shift-in-cash-strategy/)\n\n**Italy's February 2026 Bond Auction Calendar: Strong Demand and Strategic Issuance Plans**\nThe Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has released the calendar for the issuance of Italian government bonds (BTP, BOT, and other debt instruments) in February 2026. The communication to the market will be issued on Friday, February 6, 2026, with public subscription deadlines set for February 10, and settlement scheduled for February 13. Two BOT auctions are planned: one on February 12, 2026, with a 364-day maturity (scadenza on February 12, 2027), and another on February 25, 2026, with subscription closing on February 24 and settlement on February 27. The 2026 issuance strategy maintains the same frequency as previous years, with 6-month and 12-month BOTs offered monthly. In January 2026, the Treasury\u2019s auction of a 6-month BOT for \u20ac7.5 billion attracted demand exceeding \u20ac11.1 billion, with a yield of 2.04%, unchanged from the prior auction. The MEF also successfully issued \u20ac2.75 billion of the 5-year BTP 2.85% (due February 1, 2031), with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.59 and a yield of 2.74%. Similarly, \u20ac3.75 billion of the 10-year BTP 3.45% (due February 1, 2036) was issued, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.50 and a yield of 3.44%.

The BTP\u20aci (inflation-linked bonds) were also auctioned on the same day. The MEF reported strong demand for the dual-tranche issuance, including a new 7-year BTP and a reopening of the BTP Green 2046, with total demand exceeding \u20ac265 billion from approximately 390 and 360 investors respectively.

This marked the first issuances under these programmes for 2026 and the first new T-Bond tranche since March 2023, supporting the development of the AED yield curve and enhancing secondary market liquidity. Total bids reached AED5.15 billion, reflecting an oversubscription rate of 4.7 times, indicating strong investor confidence in the UAE\u2019s financial sector and economy. The auction results showed competitive, market-driven pricing: a yield to maturity (YTM) of 3.66% for the T-Sukuk (maturing October 2027) and 3.90% for the T-Bond (maturing January 2031), with spreads of up to 9 basis points above comparable US Treasuries. Both instruments are listed on Nasdaq Dubai, improving secondary market access. The total outstanding value under the programmes now stands at AED28 billion, covering maturities from 2 to 5 years. These programmes support the development of the local debt capital market, provide secure investment instruments, and contribute to the UAE\u2019s long-term economic sustainability and growth goals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:15 AM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/t-sukuk-t-bonds-attract-aed515-billion-in-b-2128731.html)\n\n**High Investor Confidence: UAE's January 2026 Sukuk and Bond Auction Oversubscribed 4.7 Times**\nThe UAE Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank of the UAE as the issuing and payment agent, successfully conducted the January 2026 auctions for Islamic Treasury Sukuk and Government Treasury Bonds denominated in UAE Dirham, with a total issuance value of 1.1 billion dirhams. This marks the first issuance of the year under the 2026 Sukuk and Bond programs, published on the Ministry\u2019s official website. The new bond tranche is the first since March 2023, supporting the development of the yield curve and enhancing the depth of the secondary market. The auctions attracted strong investor demand, with total bids amounting to 5.15 billion dirhams\u20144.7 times the issuance size\u2014reflecting high investor confidence in the country\u2019s financial sector and national economic resilience. Competitive market-based pricing was achieved, with a Yield to Maturity (YTM) of 3.66% for Sukuk and 3.90% for Bonds, only 9 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury yields at the time. Both tranches will be listed on Nasdaq Dubai, improving accessibility in the secondary market. The cumulative outstanding balance of the programs now stands at 28 billion dirhams across maturities from two to five years. The programs continue to strengthen the UAE dirham yield curve, provide safe investment alternatives, enhance local debt capital market competitiveness, support investment environment development, and contribute to sustainable economic growth.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:00 AM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/arabic/story/2128726.html)\n\n**30-Year Treasury Yield Rises to 4.872% This Month  --  Data Talk**\nThe 30-year U.S. Treasury yield increased by 0.043 percentage points to reach 4.872% in January 2026, with the bond price closing at 96 4/32.

This minor decrease reflects a stabilizing trend in the short-term U.S. Treasury securities market, supported by consistent investor demand. The result, recorded at 16:44 on January 26, 2026, indicates steady confidence in government securities despite mixed economic data earlier in the month. Analysts had anticipated yield fluctuations, but the slight adjustment suggests a balanced investor approach toward safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainties. The outcome may influence cash management strategies and offer insights into potential future federal interest rate decisions, reflecting broader investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:44 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2878408)\n\n**Market Premium For 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near a fair value estimate, according to three models analyzed by CapitalSpectator.com. As of January 14, 2026, the 10-year yield was trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025, the lowest level in three years. This reflects a continued shift from the elevated market premium seen during 2022\u20132024, signaling a reversal of the sharp rise in the premium. Historically, the yield\u2019s valuation cycle tends to revert toward zero (neutral), suggesting that the current slight premium implies a neutral stance on maturity risk for bond market strategies. In contrast, a higher allocation to maturity risk was recommended in late 2023 when the market premium peaked above 120 basis points. Since then, the 10-year yield has declined and the bond market has rallied. While future cycles are not guaranteed, the recurrence of this pattern\u2014described as 'rhyming'\u2014makes betting against it a high-risk assumption.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 06:45 PM\nSource:[The Capital Spectator](https://www.capitalspectator.com/market-premium-for-10-year-yield-holds-near-fair-value-estimate/)\n\n**Market Premium for 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate | Investing.com**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near a fair value estimate, according to CapitalSpectator.com's three-model average, with the yield trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December, the lowest level in three years. This reflects a continued shift toward a near-neutral stance after several years of elevated premiums, marking a reversal from the sharp rise observed between 2022 and 2024. Despite irregular and unpredictable fluctuations, historical patterns suggest the market premium tends to cycle around zero (neutral), implying a neutral stance on maturity risk for bond investors. A higher allocation to maturity risk was considered timely in late 2023 when the premium peaked above 120 basis points, but since then, yields have declined and the bond market has rallied. While there is no guarantee the cycle will repeat, the historical 'rhyme' suggests betting against it remains an excessively risky assumption.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 12:34 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-premium-for-10year-yield-holds-near-fair-value-estimate-200673233)\n\n**US bond market faces a more challenging road ahead in 2026**\nUS bond investors are expected to face a more challenging environment in 2026 after a stellar performance in 2025, driven by a 75 basis point cumulative Federal Reserve rate cut, a resilient economy, and strong corporate earnings. These factors boosted bond prices and kept credit risks low, resulting in broad bond indices posting over 7% total returns in 2025 \u2014 the best performance since 2020. The Morningstar US Core Bond Total Return Index gained more than 7%, while investment-grade bonds delivered nearly 8% returns, supported by credit spreads near multi-decade lows (around 80 basis points). However, expectations for 2026 are more muted: traders are pricing in only about 60 basis points of rate cuts, slower than in 2025. Fiscal stimulus measures, including potential tax and spending initiatives, could support growth and keep longer-term yields elevated. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell by over 40 basis points in 2025 to around 4.1%, but major banks forecast they will end 2026 at or slightly above current levels. A divergence may emerge, with shorter-maturity yields declining further while longer-term yields could rise due to stronger growth or higher government debt, pressuring long-duration bond returns. Asset managers are becoming cautious on duration, favoring shorter-dated securities. Credit spreads may widen in 2026 due to increased corporate borrowing, especially from large tech firms, potentially reducing returns for investment-grade and high-yield bonds. While some analysts expect a stronger bond rally if inflation eases and growth slows, requiring aggressive Fed cuts, the overall outlook points to steadier, harder-earned returns compared to the exceptional gains of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-bond-market-faces-a-more-challenging-road-ahead-in-2026/articleshow/126264115.cms)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Holds Steady in 3-Month Bill Au... | Forex News...**\nThe U.S. Treasury has maintained the yield on its 3-month bills at 3.560%, unchanged as of December 22, 2025, according to updated auction data. This stability reflects a balanced monetary policy stance, with no aggressive rate hikes or cuts, signaling that inflation pressures may be under control and investor confidence in U.S. government securities remains intact.

This minor decrease reflects subtle shifts in investor sentiment and demand for short-term government securities, potentially signaling a stabilization in short-term interest rates. Market analysts attribute the change to ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy adjustments or evolving liquidity conditions. As these bills are a preferred low-risk investment, their yield movements often reflect broader economic expectations and risk appetite.

Based on current analyst expectations:\n\n1. **No immediate yield drop**: Analysts don't expect significant movement in 3-month Treasury bill yields immediately after the February meeting, as the Fed maintained its current stance [1][5]. Money markets are pricing in only modest easing (25 bps by July and ~50 bps by year-end) rather than aggressive rate cuts [6].\n\n2. **Downward pressure expected later**: The 3-month yield is projected to decline through 2026 as the Fed begins easing, with the terminal rate expected to settle in the 3%-3.5% range [7]. This reflects market consensus that Warsh will maintain a moderately hawkish stance focused on inflation control despite political pressures [10].\n\n3. **Key influencing factors**:\n   - Balance sheet reduction tensions: Analysts warn of conflict between Trump's desire for lower long-term rates and Warsh's expected focus on shrinking the Fed's balance sheet [10]\n   - Global monetary divergence: While Australia is tightening and ECB holding steady, the Fed's path toward modest easing creates yield differential pressure [3][5][7]\n   - Fiscal risks: Rising U.S. deficit concerns and Treasury supply are counteracting forces that may limit yield declines [7][10]\n\n4. **Market technicals**: The current \"carry market\" dynamic (where bonds maintain value through yield) suggests the 3-month bill yield could remain range-bound near current levels until summer, with greater declines anticipated in H2 2026 as cuts materialize [8].\n\n5. **Major unknowns**: Analyst projections carry unusual uncertainty due to:\n   - Unconfirmed Fed chair transition (Warsh's Senate confirmation pending)\n   - Conflicting signals between Trump's rate targets and Fed independence\n   - Unclear whether Warsh will prioritize balance sheet reduction over rate cuts [10]\n\nMost analysts expect the 3-month yield to track slightly below the effective Fed funds rate, with a 12-month outlook calling for gradual decline to the 3.25%-3.75% range by end-2026 barring new inflationary shocks [6][7][8].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
