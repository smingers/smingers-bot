However, it confirms that 3-month Treasury data is tracked by FRED and updated daily from official U.S. Treasury sources.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\n**Source:** U.S. Department of the Treasury  \n**Date:** December 23, 2025\n\n### Key Information:\n\n**Methodology for Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates (CMTs):**\n- These rates are commonly called \"Constant Maturity Treasury\" rates or CMTs\n- Yields are interpolated by Treasury from the daily par yield curve\n- Based on closing market bid prices on most recently auctioned Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market\n- Par yields are derived from indicative, bid-side market price quotations (not actual transactions) obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at or near 3:30 PM each trading day\n- CMT yield values are read from the par yield curve at fixed maturities including 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years\n- The Treasury par yield curve is estimated daily using a monotone convex spline method\n\n**Daily Treasury Bill Rates:**\n- These are daily secondary market quotations on the most recently auctioned Treasury Bills\n- Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n- The Coupon Equivalent (also called Bond Equivalent or Investment Yield) is the bill's yield based on purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year\n\n**Policy on Negative Yields:**\n- While negative yields may occur in secondary markets due to technical factors, the derived par yield curve for Treasury nominal CMTs will be floored at zero\n- This is consistent with Treasury not accepting negative yields in Treasury nominal security auctions\n\n**Historical Notes:**\n- The 1.5-month constant maturity series began on February 18, 2025\n- The 4-month constant maturity series began on October 19, 2022\n- The 2-month constant maturity series began on October 16, 2018\n\n**Note:** This article provides methodological background on how Treasury rates are calculated and published but does not contain specific rate values or forecasts for future dates.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/federal-reserve-interest-rate.html\">\n## Summary of Key

Funds by 2027\"\n\n**Source:** Bondsavvy  \n**Date:** December 10, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Fed Dot Plot Projections (December 2025):**\n- 19 FOMC meeting participants provided projections\n- Yearend 2026 projections varied:\n  - One group of 4 participants: no rate cuts in 2026\n  - Another group of 4 participants: one rate cut in 2026\n  - A third group of 4 participants:

Provide the complete set of daily observations for the 3-month Treasury-bill constant-maturity yield (series code DGS3MO) for 1 January 2026 through 28 February 2026.\n\nB. Provide the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting schedule for calendar-year 2026.\n\nThe latest search round gives us authoritative sources for both topics but does not yet supply every line item that must appear in the finished answer.\n\nA. DGS3MO daily values, 1 Jan \u2013 28 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 The St. Louis Fed\u2019s FRED series page for DGS3MO confirms that the data are available at daily frequency and are published by the Board of Governors in the H.15 release (fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS3MO) [source 2].  \n\u2022 FRED exposes a public, no-login CSV endpoint with the pattern  \n  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=DGS3MO&cosd=YYYY-MM-DD&coed=YYYY-MM-DD.  \n  However, the search snippets returned in this session do not contain the actual numbers for January and February 2026; the CSV still has to be downloaded or scraped.  \n\u2022 Therefore, while we now know exactly where the data live and how to pull them, we have not yet collected the 40 individual business-day observations that the user expects.\n\nB. FOMC meeting schedule, 2026  \n\u2022 The Federal Reserve\u2019s master calendar page (federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) was located in the new results [source 6]. This is the canonical source the previous analysis said was still missing.  \n\u2022 Although the snippet does not list the date pairs, the Federal Reserve\u2019s calendar pages always enumerate all eight regularly scheduled meetings in two-day blocks and link to statements/minutes once they occur. Ancillary pages in the results corroborate two of those date pairs:  \n  \u2013 27\u201328 January 2026 (press release and implementation note) [source 4]  \n  \u2013 8\u20139 December 2026 (December calendar page) [source 3]  \n  From institutional practice (and cross-checking with secondary calendars seen earlier), the full 2026 schedule is almost certainly:  \n  \u2022 Jan 27\u201328  \n  \u2022 Mar 17\u201318  \n  \u2022 Apr 28\u201329  \n  \u2022 Jun 16\u201317  \n  \u2022 Jul 28\u201329  \n  \u2022 Sep 15\u201316  \n  \u2022 Oct 27\u201328  \n  \u2022 Dec 8\u20139  \n  Nonetheless, to be absolutely accurate we should open the 2026 anchor on fomccalendars.htm and copy the dates verbatim. At the moment we have the authoritative page but not its exact contents in the transcript.\n\nSource reliability  \n\u2022 FRED and the Board of Governors are primary, official sources for Treasury yields and FOMC calendars/communications, respectively.  \n\u2022 Because both elements have now surfaced in official form, no secondary sources are required.\n\nWhat is still missing  \n1. The numeric DGS3MO values for every business day from 2026-01-02 (markets were closed 1 Jan for New Year\u2019s Day) through 2026-02-28, including dot (\u201c.\u201d) placeholders for weekends and the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on 19 Jan.  \n2. The full list of eight 2026 FOMC meeting dates copied directly from the 2026 section of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cMeeting calendars and information\u201d page, to remove any residual ambiguity.\n\nRecommended next steps / additional searches  \n\u2022 Programmatically or manually fetch the CSV: fredgraph.csv?id=DGS3MO&cosd=2026-01-01&coed=2026-02-28, then paste the results.  \n\u2022 Open the 2026 anchor of https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm and extract the eight date pairs exactly as shown.\n\nUntil those two pieces are gathered, the answer to the user\u2019s original query would still be incomplete.</Agent_report>\n"
