Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **Current Affairs (Dec 19, 2025)** - Interview with Joshua Cohen discussing the late-2025 shutdown. This is an opinion piece analyzing political strategy. Key factual element: mentions Google Trends data showing searches for Obamacare "never really went up" during the shutdown, while SNAP searches increased. The analysis is heavily opinion-based from a political theorist. Quality: Moderate for facts, low for predictions.

2. **WTOP News (Dec 6, 2025)** - Reports on Google's 2025 Year in Search. Key facts: "government shutdown" was #2 top news search in 2025, following a historic 43-day shutdown. Government funded through January 30, 2026. Quality: High for factual reporting of Google's official data.

3. **CBS News (Dec 5, 2025)** - Similar to WTOP, reports Google's Year in Search data. Confirms 43-day shutdown in 2025 and January 30, 2026 funding deadline. Quality: High for factual reporting.

4. **ABC News (date unclear, but references "second day" of partial shutdown)** - Reports on ongoing partial shutdown negotiations, Democratic demands for DHS reforms, and procedural delays. Appears to be from late January 2026 based on context. Quality: High for current events reporting.

5. **Delaware Online/The News Journal (Jan 30, 2026)** - Reports Senate returning Friday Jan 30 for vote, with House not returning until Monday Feb 2, 2026, making weekend shutdown "inevitable." Key fact: Last shutdown was Oct 1 - Nov 12, 2025 (43 days). Quality: High for factual timeline.

6. **Military.com (Jan 28, 2026)** - Previews Jan 30 deadline, explains the DHS funding dispute is the core issue. Notes risk of "partial government shutdown" is higher than full shutdown. Quality: High for explaining the situation.

**Agent Report:**
The agent attempted to find day-level Google Trends data for past government shutdown searches around early February deadlines (2018, 2019, 2026). Conclusion: Such granular historical data is not available in open-web sources and must be manually extracted from Google Trends. Quality: High for methodology, but unable to provide the requested quantitative comparison.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Google Trends for "government shutdown [year]" during actual shutdowns vs. near-misses** - Most relevant. The question asks about search interest change during a specific 10-day window (Feb 2-12, 2026).

2. **Search interest decay patterns after government funding crises** - Relevant for understanding how quickly interest drops after a deadline passes.

3. **Weekend vs. weekday search patterns for political news** - Potentially relevant given the Feb 2-12 window spans weekends.

**Most suitable reference class:** Government shutdown search patterns around funding deadlines, particularly distinguishing between:
- Actual shutdowns (sustained high interest)
- Averted shutdowns (rapid interest decay)
- Partial/weekend shutdowns (moderate interest)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 2-12, 2026)

**Current situation as of Feb 2, 2026:**
- Jan 30 midnight deadline passed
- House not returning until Monday Feb 2 (today)
- A partial/weekend shutdown appears to have occurred or is occurring
- The Delaware Online article (Jan 30) stated weekend shutdown was "inevitable"

**Historical patterns:**

From the sources:
- The Oct 1 - Nov 12, 2025 shutdown (43 days) generated massive search interest - "government shutdown" was #2 news search of 2025
- The 2025 shutdown was described as "longest in U.S. history"
- Previous record was 35 days (Dec 2018 - Jan 2019)

**Key insight from Agent Report:** While specific day-level data isn't available, the agent confirms that early-February shutdown deadlines (2018, 2019) did generate search spikes, but the magnitude and duration varied.

**Pattern expectations:**
- Peak search interest typically occurs at or just before the deadline
- If shutdown is averted quickly, interest drops rapidly
- If shutdown continues, interest may sustain or gradually decline
- The Current Affairs article noted that even during the 2025 shutdown, specific search terms (like Obamacare) didn't sustain elevated interest

## (d) Justification

**Key factors for Feb 2-12, 2026 window:**

1. **Starting point (Feb 2):** We're at or just past a funding deadline (Jan 30). Search interest for "government shutdown 2026" is likely elevated on Feb 2 given the weekend shutdown that occurred.

2. **Resolution timeline:** 
   - House returns Feb 2 (today)
   - If a deal passes quickly (within days), search interest would likely decline rapidly
   - The ABC and Military.com articles suggest this is primarily about DHS funding, not a full government shutdown
   - Senate already had bipartisan support (71-29 vote mentioned)

3. **Nature of the crisis:**
   - This appears to be a partial shutdown focused on DHS
   - The 2025 shutdown was 43 days; this one seems positioned for quick resolution
   - Political pressure exists to resolve it (National Shutdown protest mentioned, public fatigue from 2025 shutdown)

4. **Google Trends behavior:**
   - Search interest spikes at deadlines and during uncertainty
   - Once resolution is clear, interest drops quickly
   - The question uses a ±3 threshold, which is relatively narrow

5. **Most likely scenario:** 
   - Feb 2: Elevated interest (deadline just passed, House returns)
   - Feb 3-5: Resolution likely occurs (based on procedural timeline)
   - Feb 6-12: Interest declines as crisis resolves
   - Net effect over 10 days: Decrease from Feb 2 baseline

6. **Alternative scenarios:**
   - Negotiations stall → interest sustains or increases slightly
   - Quick Monday resolution → sharp decrease
   - No change would require interest to remain within ±3 points, unlikely given the resolution pressure

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True probability considerations:**
I need to avoid overconfidence. While the evidence suggests a decrease is most likely, unexpected developments could sustain or increase interest.

**(b) Previously established distributions:**
Google Trends data is normalized 0-100, with 100 being peak interest. The ±3 threshold represents a 3% change in normalized interest. Historical government shutdown searches show:
- Sharp spikes at deadlines
- Rapid decay after resolution
- Sustained interest only during prolonged shutdowns

**(c) Probability significance:**
- 70% confidence = 7:3 odds (fairly confident but acknowledging alternatives)
- 80% confidence = 4:1 odds (strong confidence)
- 90% confidence = 9:1 odds (very strong confidence)

Given the procedural timeline and political pressure for resolution, but acknowledging possible negotiation failures:

**(d) Rate of upsets:**
Political predictions have moderate upset rates. Unexpected developments (negotiation breakdowns, new controversies, public incidents) could change search patterns. However, the mechanical aspects (House returning, Senate already passed measures) provide some predictability.

**Calibration reasoning:**

- **Decreases (most likely):** 65% - The House returns today (Feb 2), creating conditions for resolution within days. Once resolved, search interest typically drops. The 10-day window allows time for this decline to manifest.

- **Doesn't change (within ±3):** 20% - This narrow band could occur if: (1) resolution happens mid-window, causing interest to decline then stabilize, or (2) the situation remains in limbo with moderate sustained interest.

- **Increases:** 15% - This would require either: (1) negotiations to fail and shutdown to extend/worsen, (2) a new related crisis to emerge, or (3) Feb 2 baseline to be unusually low (unlikely given it's right after the deadline). While possible, the political and procedural momentum favors resolution.

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 20%
Decreases: 65%
