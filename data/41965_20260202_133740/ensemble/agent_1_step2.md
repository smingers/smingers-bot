**Key Expert/Official Opinions:**
- **Speaker Mike Johnson** (Jan 29): "May inevitably be in a short shutdown situation," earliest House action "probably won't come until Monday"
- **OMB Director Russ Vought** (Jan 31): Shutdown expected to be "short," operations could resume "the same day" House passes bill
- **President Trump** (Jan 30): Called for "Bipartisan 'YES' Vote," warned against "long and damaging Government Shutdown"

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (warranting large shifts):**

1. **Mechanical timeline certainty**: Multiple independent sources confirm House reconvenes Feb 2 (today), Senate already passed funding 71-29 with bipartisan support, and procedural path is clear. This establishes high probability of resolution within days of Feb 2.

2. **Official statements on brevity**: OMB Director Vought's memo stating operations could resume "the same day" House passes bill, combined with Speaker Johnson's timeline, provides strong institutional signal that this is positioned as a technical/weekend lapse, not prolonged crisis.

3. **Structural difference from 2025 shutdown**: Current situation is partial (6 of 12 bills) vs. full government shutdown. Five agencies already have full-year funding. Historical pattern shows partial shutdowns resolve faster than full shutdowns.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

4. **Political pressure for resolution**: Trump's public call for quick resolution, bipartisan Senate vote (71-29), and public fatigue from 43-day 2025 shutdown create momentum. However, DHS reform negotiations could still stall.

5. **Google Trends historical pattern**: 2025 shutdown was #2 news search of year, but Current Affairs source noted specific terms (Obamacare) "never really went up" during shutdown, suggesting search interest is event-driven and decays when resolution clarity emerges.

6. **Weekend timing effect**: Shutdown began Friday night (Jan 30), with House returning Monday (Feb 2). Weekend shutdowns historically generate lower sustained search interest than weekday shutdowns due to news cycle patterns.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

7. **Betting market shifts**: Polymarket odds mentioned (9% to 80%) show market uncertainty but are volatile short-term indicators.

8. **Analyst predictions**: Unnamed analysts expecting "short shutdown" and "minimal impact" are speculative without methodology.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window: 10 days (Feb 2-12, 2026)**

Current date is Feb 2, 2026 - the day House reconvenes. The question compares Google Trends values on Feb 2 vs. Feb 12.

**Critical timeline:**
- Feb 2 (today): House returns, likely votes on Senate package
- Feb 3-4: If passed, Trump signs, shutdown ends
- Feb 5-12: Post-resolution period

**If timeframe were halved (5 days, Feb 2-7):**
Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" significantly (40-50%), as resolution might occur mid-window, leaving insufficient time for search interest to decline meaningfully below Feb 2 baseline. The ±3 threshold is narrow.

**If timeframe were doubled (20 days, Feb 2-22):**
Would increase probability of "Decreases" to 80-85%, as more time allows post-resolution decay to manifest fully. Even if resolution takes a week, remaining 13 days would show clear decline.

**Key insight**: The 10-day window is long enough to capture resolution and initial decay, but short enough that timing of resolution matters significantly.

## (d) Justification

**Shifting from outside view base rates:**

My outside view established:
- Decreases: 65%
- Doesn't change: 20%
- Increases: 15%

**Current factors justifying shifts:**

1. **Stronger resolution certainty than baseline**: The outside view assumed "political and procedural momentum favors resolution" but was calibrated conservatively. Current evidence shows:
   - House returns TODAY (Feb 2), not uncertain future date
   - Senate already passed bill with strong bipartisan support (71-29)
   - Official statements explicitly frame this as brief technical lapse
   - Two-week DHS CR already agreed, removing immediate crisis pressure

   This warrants shifting confidence UP in "Decreases" by ~10 percentage points.

2. **Partial vs. full shutdown distinction**: The outside view didn't fully weight that this is a partial shutdown (6 of 12 bills) with major agencies already funded. Historical comparison to 43-day full shutdown overstates severity. Partial shutdowns generate less sustained search interest.

   This warrants shifting confidence UP in "Decreases" by ~5 percentage points.

3. **Weekend effect on Feb 2 baseline**: Feb 2 is a Sunday (House returns Monday). The shutdown began Friday night. Weekend search patterns for political news are typically lower than weekday peaks. If Feb 2 baseline is already somewhat elevated but not peak, the comparison to Feb 12 (a Wednesday) could show decline OR stability depending on resolution timing.

   This creates uncertainty, warranting slight shift UP in "Doesn't change" by ~5 percentage points.

4. **±3 threshold is narrow**: Google Trends normalized scale means ±3 represents only 3% change. If Feb 2 value is, say, 60, then 57-63 range counts as "no change." Given resolution uncertainty timing (Monday vs. Tuesday vs. Wednesday), there's meaningful probability the decline hasn't exceeded 3 points by Feb 12.

   This warrants shifting UP in "Doesn't change" by ~5 percentage points.

**Counterbalancing factors:**

5. **Negotiation risk remains**: DHS reform negotiations could stall despite procedural path. Democrats demanding body cameras, warrant requirements; Republicans resisting policy linkage. If House vote fails or negotiations extend, interest could sustain or increase.

   This warrants maintaining some probability in "Increases" (~10%) and "Doesn't change" (~25%).

**Final shifts from outside view:**
- Decreases: 65% → 70% (stronger resolution certainty, partial shutdown effect)
- Doesn't change: 20% → 20% (narrow threshold and weekend effect offset each other)
- Increases: 15% → 10% (resolution momentum reduces risk, but negotiation failure remains possible)

## Probability Calibration

**Decreases (70%)**: This represents 7:3 odds that Feb 12 value will be >3 points lower than Feb 2. Justification:
- House vote likely Feb 2-3 (today/tomorrow)
- If passed, Trump signs immediately per Vought memo
- 7-9 days post-resolution (Feb 4-12) sufficient for search decay
- Historical pattern: shutdown search interest drops rapidly once resolution clear
- Partial shutdown generates less sustained interest than full shutdown

**Doesn't change (20%)**: This represents 1:4 odds that Feb 12 value stays within ±3 of Feb 2. Justification:
- Requires either: (a) resolution mid-window with stabilization, or (b) sustained moderate interest
- ±3 threshold is narrow (only 3% on normalized scale)
- Weekend Feb 2 baseline may already be declining from Friday peak
- If resolution delayed to Feb 4-5, decline may not exceed threshold by Feb 12

**Increases (10%)**: This represents 1:9 odds that Feb 12 value will be >3 points higher than Feb 2. Justification:
- Requires House vote failure or significant negotiation breakdown
- Possible if new ICE incident occurs or DHS reform talks collapse
- Trump and bipartisan Senate support make this unlikely
- Would need Feb 2 baseline to be unusually low (weekend effect) AND crisis escalation

**Confidence check**: Am I overconfident in "Decreases"?
- 70% feels appropriate given strong procedural evidence but acknowledging negotiation risk
- 80% would require near-certainty of Monday resolution (too strong)
- 60% would underweight the mechanical timeline and official statements
- Blind spot: If House conservatives revolt or new crisis emerges, "Increases" could materialize

**Calibration verification**:
- 70-20-10 split reflects high confidence in resolution but meaningful uncertainty about timing and threshold
- Small probability shifts matter: 70% vs 80% is difference between 7:3 and 4:1 odds
- The 10% "Increases" tail risk accounts for political volatility and negotiation failure scenarios

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Compare Google Trends value for "government shutdown 2026" on Feb 12 vs Feb 2. Increases if >3 higher, Decreases if >3 lower, else no change.

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view was Decreases 65%, Doesn't change 20%, Increases 15%. Final prediction shifts to 70-20-10 based on stronger resolution evidence and partial shutdown distinction. Shift is modest and justified.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (House returns today, Senate passed, officials say brief); Least likely = Increases (requires negotiation failure). This aligns with procedural timeline and official statements.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - House reconvenes Feb 2 (today) with clear procedural path (VERIFIED: multiple sources)
   - Senate passed funding 71-29 with bipartisan support (VERIFIED: official vote record)
   - OMB Director states shutdown expected "short," operations resume "same day" House passes bill (VERIFIED: official memo)
   - Partial shutdown (6 of 12 bills) vs. full shutdown (VERIFIED: appropriations status)
   - 10-day window allows time for post-resolution decay (LOGICAL: Feb 2-12 span)

5. **Blind spot**: House conservatives revolt on DHS reforms or new ICE incident occurs Feb 3-10, causing negotiation collapse and sustained/increased search interest. Would shift probability to Increases 30-40%, Decreases 40-50%. Mitigated by Trump/Senate support, but political volatility remains.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [10, 20, 70]
