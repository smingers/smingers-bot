Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**
1. **CRFB (Jan 29, 2026)**: High-quality policy analysis from a respected budget watchdog. Factual data on the Oct-Nov 2025 43-day shutdown and current situation. Opinion from Maya MacGuineas is expert but normative (shutdowns "should be avoided"). **Key facts**: 6 of 12 bills on CR, deadline Jan 30, previous shutdown cost $11B GDP.

2. **University of Arkansas (Jan 30, 2026)**: Internal guidance document. Factual but limited scope. Confirms shutdown began midnight Jan 30, expected to be "temporary" with House action "early next week." **Reliable for timing**.

3. **PilieroMazza Law Firm (Jan 29, 2026)**: Legal advisory for contractors. Factual on funding status and affected agencies. Notes partisan divisions over DHS/ICE as cause. **Reliable for context**.

4. **Delaware Online (Jan 29, 2026)**: News reporting with direct quotes from Speaker Johnson and Trump. **Strong evidence**: Johnson admitted "short shutdown situation" inevitable, House won't act until Monday (Feb 3 at earliest). Trump urged bipartisan support. Senate vote failed 55-45.

5. **North Jersey (Jan 29, 2026)**: News reporting. Confirms Senate composition (53-47 R), need for 60 votes, Democratic opposition over ICE. **Factual timeline**: shutdown begins 12:01am Jan 31.

6. **Economic Times (Jan 31, 2026)**: Aggregated reporting. Confirms 78-80% of government affected, ICE has $75B separate funding. Notes House returns Feb 2. **Moderate quality** - some speculation mixed with facts.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 31-Feb 1, 2026):**
7. Multiple sources (AFP, Hindustan Times, Military.com, etc.) confirm: Shutdown began Jan 31, Senate passed funding package Jan 30, House reconvenes Feb 2, expected to vote Monday. **Consensus across 15+ sources = strong evidence**. OMB Director Vought expects "short" shutdown.

8. **Key factual consensus**: 
   - Shutdown is partial (5 agencies already funded through Sept)
   - House vote expected Feb 2-3
   - Two-week DHS funding expires Feb 13
   - Previous 43-day shutdown created sustained attention

**Expert opinions with attribution:**
- Speaker Johnson: "short shutdown," House action Monday
- Trump: urged quick resolution, called shutdowns "damaging"
- Sen. Schumer: Democrats blocking until ICE reforms
- OMB Director Vought: expects brief lapse

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Timing mechanics**: House reconvened Feb 2 (TODAY per the question). Multiple sources confirm vote expected Feb 2-3. This means the shutdown is 1-2 days old as of the question opening. **Historical pattern**: Google Trends peaks at/before deadline, then decays. We are 1 day PAST the deadline peak. (Strong evidence for decrease)

2. **Partial vs. full shutdown**: Only 6 of 12 agencies affected. Previous Oct-Nov 2025 shutdown was likely broader and lasted 43 days, generating sustained attention. Current shutdown expected to be "short" per multiple officials. **Implication**: Less dramatic = faster attention decay. (Moderate-strong evidence for decrease)

3. **Resolution timeline**: Credible path to resolution exists (House vote Feb 2-3, likely passage given bipartisan Senate support 71-29). Even if delayed, two-week DHS CR creates hard deadline Feb 13. **Historical analog**: When resolution path is clear, attention drops quickly. (Strong evidence for decrease)

**Moderate Evidence:**
4. **Competing attention**: The question asks about Feb 2-12 window. No major scheduled events likely to spike shutdown attention (no State of Union, no debt ceiling crisis, etc.). Feb 13 DHS deadline could create late-window spike, but that's day 11 (outside resolution window). (Moderate evidence for decrease)

5. **ICE controversy**: The DHS/ICE reform debate (shootings in Minneapolis) is contentious but specific. Unlike 2019 border wall fight (broad symbolic issue), this is narrower. May sustain moderate attention but unlikely to drive major spikes. (Weak-moderate evidence for stability or slight increase)

**Weak Evidence:**
6. **Midterm politics**: Some sources mention 2026 midterms as context for Republican strategy. However, midterms are 9 months away - too distant to drive daily search behavior in this window. (Weak evidence, ignore)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Feb 2 (today) to Feb 12 (10 days).

**Key dates in window:**
- Feb 2: House reconvenes (TODAY)
- Feb 2-3: Expected House vote on funding package
- Feb 13: Two-week DHS CR expires (1 day after resolution window)

**Historical decay pattern**: In previous shutdowns, Google Trends typically drops 30-60 points in the 7-10 days after peak. The ±3 threshold is very narrow - only 6-7% of typical peak value.

**If timeframe halved (5 days, Feb 2-7):**
- Increase probability would rise slightly (less time for decay, House vote outcome still uncertain on Feb 2-3)
- Decrease probability would fall (less time for typical decay pattern to manifest)
- Estimate: Increase 35%, No change 15%, Decrease 50%

**If timeframe doubled (20 days, Feb 2-22):**
- Decrease probability would rise significantly (almost certain decay by day 20)
- Increase probability would fall unless new crisis emerges
- Feb 13 DHS deadline could create temporary spike, but decay would resume
- Estimate: Increase 15%, No change 5%, Decrease 80%

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates**: Decrease 60%, Increase 30%, No change 10%

**Current factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Timing precision** (STRONG): The question opened Feb 2, exactly when House reconvened. This means we're measuring from a point 1-2 days AFTER the Jan 30 deadline peak. Historical pattern shows decay begins immediately after deadline. The outside view of 60% decrease may be conservative. **Shift**: +10-15% to Decrease.

2. **Partial shutdown with clear resolution path** (STRONG): Unlike the 43-day 2025 shutdown (which the outside view reference class includes), current shutdown has:
   - 5 of 11 agencies already funded
   - Bipartisan Senate passage (71-29)
   - Clear House vote timeline (Feb 2-3)
   - Officials calling it "temporary" and "short"
   
   This makes current situation MORE likely to decay quickly than the reference class average. **Shift**: +5-10% to Decrease.

3. **Narrow ±3 threshold** (MODERATE): Google Trends daily values for political keywords fluctuate ±5-10 even in decay phases. The "Doesn't change" outcome requires landing exactly in a 7-point band (if Feb 2 value is 50, Feb 12 must be 47-53). This is statistically unlikely given typical volatility. **Shift**: -5% from No change, distribute to Increase/Decrease.

4. **Feb 13 DHS deadline** (MODERATE COUNTER-EVIDENCE): While outside the resolution window, proximity to Feb 13 could sustain attention more than typical shutdown. However, this is speculative and depends on Feb 2-3 vote outcome. If House passes funding quickly, Feb 13 becomes moot. **Shift**: +5% to Increase (hedge against unexpected stall).

5. **Lack of major catalysts in window** (MODERATE): No scheduled major events (presidential address, Supreme Court ruling, etc.) to spike shutdown attention Feb 2-12. Media cycle likely moves to other topics (tariffs, foreign policy, etc.). **Shift**: +5% to Decrease.

**Blind spots:**
- House vote fails or gets delayed beyond Feb 3 → could sustain/increase attention
- Major incident related to shutdown (TSA crisis, federal employee protest) → spike
- Trump/GOP leadership public fight over strategy → spike
- Unexpected bipartisan deal collapses → spike

However, multiple sources indicate strong bipartisan support for the Senate package (71-29 vote). House passage seems likely.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point (outside view)**: Decrease 60%, Increase 30%, No change 10%

**Adjustments:**
1. Timing precision (we're past peak): +12% to Decrease
2. Partial shutdown with resolution path: +8% to Decrease  
3. Narrow threshold makes "No change" unlikely: -5% from No change
4. Feb 13 deadline proximity: +5% to Increase
5. No major catalysts: +5% to Decrease

**Calculation:**
- Decrease: 60 + 12 + 8 + 5 = 85%
- Increase: 30 + 5 = 35% (but need to normalize)
- No change: 10 - 5 = 5%

Sum = 125%, normalize:
- Decrease: 85/125 = 68%
- Increase: 35/125 = 28%
- No change: 5/125 = 4%

**Confidence check**: Am I overconfident in Decrease?
- Historical pattern is very strong (3/3 prior cases showed change >3)
- Current circumstances favor decay (partial shutdown, clear path to resolution, past deadline peak)
- Main risk is House vote failure, but Senate 71-29 vote suggests broad support
- 68% = roughly 2:1 odds, which seems appropriate given evidence strength

**Final calibration**: The 68-28-4 split feels justified. The narrow ±3 threshold combined with typical post-deadline decay makes "Doesn't change" very unlikely. The main uncertainty is whether attention increases (House drama, Feb 13 deadline) or decreases (quick resolution, media moves on). Given we're already past the peak and resolution seems likely by Feb 3, Decrease is most probable.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Compare Google Trends value for "government shutdown 2026" on Feb 2 vs Feb 12; resolves Decrease if Feb 12 is >3 lower, Increase if >3 higher, No change if within ±3.

2. **Base rate**: Decrease 60%, Increase 30%, No change 10% - adjusted to 68/28/4 based on strong evidence we're past deadline peak with clear resolution path.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decrease (68%); Least likely = No change (4%). Makes sense - we're 1-2 days past shutdown deadline (typical peak), House vote expected Feb 2-3, historical decay pattern strong.

4. **Key evidence**: 
   - Shutdown began Jan 31, question opened Feb 2 (past peak timing)
   - Partial shutdown with Senate passage 71-29, House vote Feb 2-3 expected
   - Historical pattern: 3/3 prior cases showed >3 point change in 10-day windows
   - Narrow ±3 threshold unlikely given typical ±5-10 daily volatility
   - No major scheduled events Feb 2-12 to spike attention

5. **Blind spot**: House vote fails or delays past Feb 3, creating sustained drama and media coverage through Feb 12. Would shift toward Increase. However, 71-29 Senate vote suggests bipartisan support makes this unlikely. If wrong, probably due to underestimating partisan brinkmanship over ICE reforms.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
