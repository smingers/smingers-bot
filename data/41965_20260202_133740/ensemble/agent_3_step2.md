Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-12 (US Google Trends for “government shutdown 2026”), outcome is **Increases** if Feb 12 > Feb 2 by >3, **Decreases** if < by >3, else **Doesn’t change** (within ±3).

2) Outside view base rate (given)
Outside view distribution: Increases 4 / Doesn’t change 19 / Decreases 77.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)

- CRFB blog (Jan 29, 2026; advocacy/nonpartisan fiscal watchdog)
  - Use: credible background on shutdown dynamics and incentives; confirms funding deadline Jan 30 and prior shutdown history.
  - Facts: funding expiring; 6/12 bills under CR; prior Oct–Nov 2025 shutdown length/cost figures.
  - Opinions: argues for “Prevent Government Shutdowns Act”; reform advocacy.

- University of Arkansas Provost guidance (undated page but refers to Jan 30/31, 2026 shutdown; institutional guidance)
  - Use: strong factual confirmation shutdown began Jan 30/31 and expected to be temporary; but narrow scope and non-journalistic.
  - Facts: partial shutdown began; legislative posture; expectation of “early next week” work.
  - Opinions: operational expectations/contingency framing.

- PilieroMazza law-firm advisory (Jan 29, 2026; expert but client-oriented)
  - Use: reliable on procedural/contracting impacts, less so on political likelihood.
  - Facts: which bills funded/unfunded; prior shutdown references.
  - Opinions/speculation: assessment of partisan “cause” and what is “unlikely” in Senate.

- Delaware Online/USA TODAY-style coverage (Jan 29, 2026; mainstream reporting)
  - Use: strong on contemporaneous timeline; quotes named principals.
  - Facts: failed test vote; House recess logistics; deadline pressures; “short shutdown” discussed.
  - Opinions: politicians’ statements (Johnson/Trump) are strategic but informative about intent.

- North Jersey Media Group explainer (Jan 29, 2026; mainstream/local syndication)
  - Use: good for mechanics/timing and Senate vote math; somewhat headline-driven.
  - Facts: deadline timing; Senate seat counts; stated party positions.
  - Opinions: “odds growing” style language.

- Economic Times (Jan 27–28, 2026; secondary/aggregated; mixed reliability)
  - Use: reasonable synthesis but can overstate; still useful for pointing to market odds and operational implications.
  - Facts: scope estimates, some budget numbers; but some claims are harder to verify.
  - Opinions: “analysts expect” and investment advice portions.

- AskNews items (Jan 30–Feb 1, 2026; mixed outlets and languages)
  - High-value: AFP (Jan 30) and mainstream US outlets (Newsweek summary, Military.com, etc.) for timing and expectations that shutdown is brief.
  - Medium/low: foreign opinion pieces (e.g., 环球网 commentary) are more interpretive/ideological; still confirm event timing but less predictive for US search behavior.
  - Key factual thread across multiple items: shutdown began Jan 31; House vote expected Feb 2/3; DHS funded only temporarily (two-week) with an expiration around Feb 13 (noted in the “Deep Research Analysis” synthesis).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)

Strong evidence
- (S1) **Search interest for crisis terms typically decays after resolution** (historical pattern; strong predictive power for Google Trends).
- (S2) **Multiple independent reports confirm a partial shutdown started Jan 31 and is expected to be brief with House action Feb 2/3** (clustered, cross-outlet corroboration). This implies Feb 2 may be near the tail/peak; by Feb 12 baseline tends to be lower.

Moderate evidence
- (M1) **A second relevant deadline exists: DHS short-term funding expires ~Feb 13** (from compiled “Deep Research Analysis” and several summaries implying a two-week DHS measure). This can create a *renewed* news cycle near Feb 12, potentially lifting searches.
- (M2) **Political conflict is not fully resolved—DHS/ICE reforms remain contentious**. Even if the broader shutdown ends early Feb, continued negotiation can keep some public attention alive.

Weak evidence
- (W1) **Speaker/leader optimism about quick end** (political messaging; often true for short lapses but not guaranteed).
- (W2) **Contractor- and university-focused guidance** suggests “temporary,” but these are not measures of public salience/search volume.

Net effect on direction:
- Strong forces push toward **Decreases** (post-resolution decay).
- Moderate counterforce raises chances of **Doesn’t change** or **Increases** (Feb 13 deadline could re-elevate Feb 12).

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time to measurement end: ~10 days (Feb 2 → Feb 12).
- If timeframe were halved (~5 days to Feb 7): I’d expect an even higher **Decreases** probability (more likely we’re just coming off the peak after passage/signing).
- If timeframe were doubled (~20 days to Feb 22): **Decreases** would likely rise again because even a Feb 13 mini-spike would probably fade by late Feb unless there’s another lapse.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from outside view)
Outside view heavily favored Decreases (77%) on the assumption Feb 2 is near peak and Feb 12 is in the decay tail.

Inside view adjustment: reduce confidence in Decreases because **Feb 12 is immediately before a known follow-on deadline (Feb 13 DHS CR expiration)**, which can generate a second bump in searches. That makes “monotonic decay” less certain over this exact window. Still, I think Feb 2 is likely to be *at least as salient* as Feb 12 because it coincides with House return/vote/action while the shutdown is live or just ending—typically the highest-attention moment.

So I:
- Raise **Increases** materially (from 4 → low teens) to reflect a plausible “second spike > Feb 2” scenario (e.g., Feb 2 already post-peak/lowish, then Feb 12 ramps).
- Raise **Doesn’t change** (from 19 → high 20s) because a “down then back up” path can land within ±3.
- Lower **Decreases** (from 77 → ~60) but keep it the modal outcome.

Probability calibration
- Key uncertainty is the *relative amplitude* of (1) Feb 2 “shutdown live + House acts” attention vs (2) Feb 12 “another deadline tomorrow” attention for the specific query including “2026”.
- Blind-spot risk argues against overconfidence: if negotiations break down again or headlines warn of a renewed lapse, Feb 12 could match/exceed Feb 2.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options: Compare Feb 12 vs Feb 2 value; ±3 = Doesn’t change; >3 up = Increases; >3 down = Decreases.
2) Outside view: [4, 19, 77] used as anchor.
3) Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; consistent with decay pattern but moderated by Feb 13 deadline.
4) Top evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Shutdown began Jan 31; House acts Feb 2/3; peak attention likely around these dates.
   - Google Trends for crisis terms usually decays quickly after resolution.
   - DHS funding extension expires ~Feb 13, potentially creating a renewed Feb 12 spike.
   - Continued DHS/ICE dispute sustains some baseline attention.
5) Blind spot: A fresh escalation/failed DHS talks near Feb 11–12 could create a bigger second spike than Feb 2.
6) Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100; all 0–100; no percent signs.

Probabilities: [12, 28, 60]
