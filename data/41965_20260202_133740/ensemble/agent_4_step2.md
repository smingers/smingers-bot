Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)

1. CRFB blog (29 Jan 26) – Factual rundown of funding status, prior 43-day shutdown, bipartisan PGSA proposal.  Reliable, non-partisan.  
2. Univ. Arkansas guidance (30 Jan 26) – Confirms partial shutdown started 30 Jan; expects it to be “temporary, early-next-week” fix. Institutional memo, high factual value.  
3. PilieroMazza client alert (29 Jan 26) – Details which agencies lose funding and contractual effects; opinion that partisan divide makes Senate passage unlikely.  Specialist but credible.  
4. DelawareOnline live blog (29-30 Jan 26) – On-the-ground vote counts; Speaker Johnson quote: “short shutdown situation.” Local but factual.  
5. Economic Times, Hindustan Times etc. (28-31 Jan 26) – Multiple independent outlets describe shutdown start, stress that House vote 2 Feb likely ends lapse; all expect brief duration.  Consistent facts.  
6. Asknews batch (31 Jan–1 Feb 26) – Reinforces same timeline; some foreign commentary is analytical opinion, but key fact across pieces: House set to act 2–3 Feb, DHS funded only to 13 Feb if bill passes.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical Google Trends for “government shutdown [year]” show peak on deadline/start day, decay ≥50 % within a week (2013, 18, 19, 25).  
• House scheduled to reconvene 2 Feb with bipartisan will to end shutdown ⇒ story’s acute phase likely ends inside our 10-day window.  
Moderate evidence  
• Two-week DHS CR means a new cliff 13 Feb, one day after window – could lift searches again 11-12 Feb.  
• Statements from Speaker Johnson & OMB (“resolved by 3 Feb”) suggest short event, but political forecasts often miss.  
Weak evidence  
• Possibility of visible service disruptions (flight delays, payless Fridays) sustaining interest; largely speculative given expected brevity.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction window = 10 days (2 Feb → 12 Feb).  If window halved to 5 days, downward move more certain (less chance of 13 Feb hype).  If doubled to 20 days, second spike risk grows; “Increase” probability would rise ~10 pts, “Decrease” fall.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Baseline (outside view) 22 / 28 / 50.  
Current evidence strengthens “Decrease”: Feb 2 coincides with congressional action + peak coverage; multiple reliable sources expect resolution in 1-3 days, matching prior search-decay pattern.  However, the 13 Feb DHS deadline and chance that talks implode keep “Increase” materially above zero and prevent certainty.  Given low-volume query noise (±3 rule), I assign a modest 23 % to “Doesn’t change.”

Probability calibration  
Final distribution:  
• Decreases – 57 % (peak-then-decay most common and strongly supported)  
• Doesn’t change – 23 % (noise band, or plateau if shutdown lingers but interest stabilises)  
• Increases – 20 % (re-escalation, visible disruptions, or DHS cliff buzz on 11-12 Feb)

Checklist (short)

1. Options: Compare Google Trends value for exact term on 2 Feb vs 12 Feb; >+3 = Increase, −>3 = Decrease, else Same.  
2. Base rate 22/28/50; final tied to it with evidence-based shift.  
3. Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Increase – consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) historical spike-decay, b) House vote Feb 2-3 expected, c) two-week DHS CR ends after window, d) past shutdown search curves.  
5. Blind-spot: House negotiations fail, shutdown drags past 10 Feb causing sustained or growing searches – would push outcome to “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities sum 100, numeric, no % symbols.

Probabilities: [20, 23, 57]
