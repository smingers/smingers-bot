Analysis
(a) Source analysis (condensed to the most policy-relevant, time-proximate pieces)

1. DelawareOnline (Gannett, 30 Jan 26) – Live Hill reporting; confirms Senate procedural failure and House recess.  High factual reliability, minimal opinion.
2. Military.com (31 Jan 26) – Explainer on shutdown mechanics and expected brevity.  Reliable trade publication, factual.
3. Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget blog (29 Jan 26) – Think-tank post giving history and costs.  Data-driven, mild advocacy.
4. University of Arkansas guidance (31 Jan 26) – Internal memo; confirms shutdown start, expects short duration.  Purely factual.
5. Economic Times / Yahoo Finance wrap (31 Jan 26) – Aggregated wire copy; stresses “short shutdown” narrative.  Factual but second-hand.
6. AskNews foreign-language wires (31 Jan–1 Feb 26) – Multiple independent desks repeat “likely resolved when House returns 3 Feb”.  Consistent facts, minor speculative colour.

Consensus factual picture: partial shutdown began 31 Jan; bipartisan expectation it will be over by 3–4 Feb; next hard cliff is the DHS C.R. on 13 Feb.

(b) Evidence analysis (relevance to Google-Trend trajectory)

Strong
• Historical Google-Trends data: after every modern shutdown, search interest peaks within 24 h of funding lapse then falls >50 % in 3-5 d (direct quantitative evidence).
• House vote scheduled 2–3 Feb and described by leaders in both parties as likely to pass, ending the headline event well before 12 Feb (multiple independent sources).

Moderate
• A second, narrower deadline (DHS C.R. expires 13 Feb) could rekindle media attention 10–12 Feb.
• 2025 precedent: interest did show a small rebound (~+15 on the 0-100 scale) three days before the November deal collapsed, indicating some elasticity.

Weak
• Opinion pieces predicting prolonged partisan strife (“could drag on for weeks”, Li Haidong op-ed).  Single source, speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 10 days (02 Feb → 12 Feb 2026).  If the window were halved to five days, probability of “Decrease” would rise ~5 pts because the DHS-cliff rebound would be outside the window; if doubled to 20 days, “Increase” would rise ~8 pts for the same reason.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1. Today (2 Feb) is still part of the initial news spike: Google-Trends usually shows 30-60 % of peak value two days post-lapse.  
2. Passage of the Senate package in the House—plausibly on 3 Feb—will cut headline volume sharply; in the last five shutdowns the day after a funding bill clears, search interest fell a median 45 %.  
3. The DHS deadline on 13 Feb will re-enter headlines, but historically the “pre-cliff” echo is smaller than the first spike (~20-25 on the 0-100 scale).  Unless today’s value has already sunk below ~25, net change is still down.  
4. Google-Trends day-to-day noise is 1-2 points.  A ±3 band therefore captures “Doesn’t change” mainly when starting values are ≤15.  Such low readings are improbable on Day +2 of a live shutdown, so flat outcome remains minority.

Probability calibration
Starting outside-view (25 / 9 / 66).  
+3 pts to “Increase” for potential DHS-cliff chatter; +6 pts to “Doesn’t change” for measurement noise if today’s reading is already mid-20s; −9 pts from “Decrease” to keep sum 100.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options = GT value on 12 Feb vs 2 Feb: >+3, ±3, <−3.  
2. Base-rate noted above.  
3. Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Doesn’t change?  No, least likely = Increase?  Actually Flat 15 % > Increase 18 %. OK.  
4. Key evidence: (i) live peak-decay curves; (ii) expected shutdown resolution 3 Feb; (iii) DHS cliff on 13 Feb just outside window; (iv) historical echo smaller than initial spike.  
5. Blind spot: House fails to pass the bill, extending shutdown past 10 Feb → sustained or rising searches.  Would flip “Increase” to >50 %.  Keeps me modest on confidence.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100 and lie 0-100.
