# Summary of "What the Government Shutdown Actually Revealed for Democrats"

**Source:** Current Affairs  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Author:** Alex Skopic (interviewing Joshua Cohen of Ettingermentum Substack)

## Key Facts and Events:

- **Timing context:** The article discusses a government shutdown that occurred in late 2025, with Cohen noting Trump's approval rating reached an all-time low "right before the election the next week" and that at the time of writing, it stood at -13.

- **Democratic strategy during shutdown:** Democrats focused "almost monomaniacally" on material issues—specifically healthcare, insurance premiums, subsidies, and contrasting these with Trump's tax cuts—rather than using moralistic rhetoric about authoritarianism.

- **Political outcome:** The shutdown was described as "relatively politically successful" with Republicans blamed more than Democrats, though Democrats did not succeed in increasing the salience of healthcare as an issue, which was their stated intention.

- **Trump approval ratings:** Trump's approval went down at the end of the shutdown, reaching an all-time low. Previously, his worst approval points had been after "liberation day" and during Iran bombings (around -10); the shutdown brought him to -13, described as "uncharted territory."

## Google Trends Data Referenced:

- **Obamacare searches:** According to Nate Silver's analysis cited in the article, searches for Obamacare "never really went up relative to where they had been before" during the shutdown.

- **SNAP searches:** Searches for SNAP "did go up by a lot after we started cutting the benefits," suggesting this issue caught people's attention more effectively than healthcare.

## Opinions and Analysis:

**From Joshua Cohen (named source, political theorist/writer):**
- Democrats' strategy appeared influenced by pundit recommendations, particularly from David Shore and Ezra Klein
- Democrats "walked kind of zombie-like into doing the shutdown because Ezra Klein said that this was an important moment"
- Democrats "made fools of themselves" and gave the Trump administration "their buy-in for continuing the project"
- Democrats showed they weren't committed to the endgame, which should have been forcing Republicans to either remove the filibuster or make compromises
- The party has entered "a different era" controlled by pundits, moving from overconfidence to "crazy defensive crouch"

# Summary of Article: "Partial government shutdown expected to extend longer than anticipated"

**Source:** ABC News

## Key Facts and Timeline:

- A partial government shutdown entered its second day (as of the article's writing)
- The Senate voted 71-29 on Friday to approve a revised package of government funding bills, separating DHS funding from five other agency funding bills
- The DHS funding bill was put off for two weeks to negotiate Democratic demands
- House Speaker Mike Johnson initially hoped to vote on the funding bills on Monday under suspension of rules (requiring two-thirds majority)
- The House Rules Committee scheduled a markup on the Senate-passed funding package for Monday at 4 p.m.
- Johnson stated he is confident the package will pass by Tuesday

## Democratic Demands and Positions:

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated:
- Democrats will not help fast-track the Senate-passed funding measure
- Democrats demand reforms to the Department of Homeland Security, including:
  - Requiring ICE agents to wear body cameras (turned on)
  - Prohibiting agents from wearing masks
  - Ending roving patrols
  - Enforcing accountability measures
- Jeffries told ABC News: "We need a full and complete debate" and rejected a "my way or the highway" approach
- He emphasized: "The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today, not in two weeks."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated:
- Democrats will demand an end to roving patrols, enforce accountability, and mandate masks off and body-cameras turned on
- "If our colleagues are not willing to enact real change, real strong change, they should not expect Democratic votes"

Rep. Ro Khanna indicated he would vote against the DHS funding bill, citing concerns about ICE operations

## Republican Positions:

Speaker Johnson:
- Stated he will have "a lot of conversations to have with individual Republican members over the next 24 hours"
- Expressed confidence: "We'll get all this done by Tuesday, I'm convinced"
- It is unclear if Johnson has the necessary GOP support given his slim majority

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt:

# Article Summary: The News Journal - Government Shutdown Vote Timeline

## Key Facts and Timeline:

**Current Situation (as of Jan. 30, 2026):**
- Senate returns Friday, Jan. 30, 2026 at 11 a.m. for an anticipated vote
- Government shutdown deadline: Friday, Jan. 30 at midnight (article states this, though also mentions Saturday, Jan. 31 at midnight in another section)
- A bipartisan deal was struck Thursday evening between Senate leaders and President Trump to avert shutdown
- Senate adjourned Thursday at 11:18 p.m. without voting after the deal hit a snag

**The Deal:**
- Would fully fund the government until September
- Involves five of 12 annual spending bills (Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury)
- The controversial DHS (Department of Homeland Security) funding bill was removed from the broader package

**Why the Delay:**
- Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called it a "bad deal," causing negotiations to stall
- DHS funding has been contentious following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti (and Renee Good) in Minneapolis by federal agents last weekend
- Senate Democrats have demanded DHS funding be stripped in exchange for their votes

**Vote Requirements:**
- Senate needs 60 votes to avert filibuster (Republicans control 53-47, requiring Democratic support)
- Even if Senate passes the measures, the House must approve changes
- **House does not return to DC until Monday, Feb. 2, 2026** - meaning a partial government shutdown over the weekend is inevitable

**Context:**
- Last government shutdown was Oct. 1, 2025 to Nov. 12, 2025 (described as longest in history)
- A "National Shutdown" protest is taking place Friday, Jan. 30, nationwide protesting ICE funding, with activist groups encouraging no school, no work, and no shopping

**Named Source:**
- President Trump expressed support via Truth Social Thursday evening, stating: "Hopefully both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed bipartisan 'YES' vote."
- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Senate Republicans "need to get their act together" after storming out

# Summary of Article: Government Shutdown Risk Grows as Jan. 30 Funding Deadline Nears

**Source:** Military.com  
**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Author:** Douglas Lindsay

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Funding deadline:** January 30, 2026
- **Previous shutdown:** A record 43-day government shutdown ended in mid-November 2025 when both parties agreed to a continuing resolution (CR)
- **Current CR expiration:** The November CR extended funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026
- **House action:** The Republican-majority House recently passed a $1.2 trillion funding package combining several appropriations bills, including DHS funding, which would extend full-year funding through fiscal 2026
- **Senate threshold:** Bills typically need 60 votes to advance in the Senate
- **Budget process:** Congress must annually pass 12 appropriations bills; fiscal year runs October 1 through September 30

## Core Issue:

The primary dispute centers on **Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**, not the overall budget. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have vowed to block any funding package that includes DHS and ICE money without major changes. Democratic demands include:
- Stronger oversight of immigration enforcement
- Restrictions on certain ICE activities following recent fatal encounters between federal agents and civilians

Some Democratic senators have called for splitting DHS funding from the broader spending package to allow other agencies to be funded separately.

## Potential Impact:

- About half of federal government operations could be forced to stop or scale back if no funding deal is approved
- Essential services (national defense operations, air traffic control, public safety programs) would continue
- Mandatory spending (Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits) would continue as these are funded outside annual appropriations
- Discretionary programs could be suspended or delayed, including federal contract processing, research grants, regulatory approvals, and administrative services
- Federal employees could face furloughs or work without pay (though historically receive back pay later)

## Current Outlook:

The article notes that observers say the risk of a **partial government shutdown** (where only certain departments lack funding) is higher than a full shutdown. With just days remaining before the deadline, no resolution appears imminent.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Compare Google Trends spikes for “government shutdown [year]” around funding deadlines, especially early February periods; list day-level scores and duration of post-deadline drop.
The additional sweep of the web confirms – but does not quantify – the public-attention surges that surrounded the three early-February shutdown deadlines the user wants to compare.

1. Confirmation of the events and their timing  
   • 8–9 Feb 2018: the two-hour lapse that followed Sen. Paul’s overnight filibuster is listed in CNN’s longitudinal shutdown chart (CNN, 30 Sep 2025).  
   • 15 Feb 2019: the statutory deadline that ended the 35-day partial closure begun 22 Dec 2018 is likewise recorded by CNN (same source).  
   • 31 Jan–3 Feb 2026: NBC and Economic Times (surfaced in the previous round) describe the weekend lapse and 3 Feb reopening; CNN again notes it in the context of the 2025–26 cycle.  
   The dates therefore remain the right anchors for any Google Trends extraction.

2. What the newly surfaced pages add  
   • Pew Research’s December 2025 “Public Trust in Government” report references the Oct-Nov 2025 shutdown but provides only opinion-poll figures, not search-interest data (Pew Research Center, 4 Dec 2025).  
   • CNN’s “history of US government shutdowns” visual (CNN, 30 Sep 2025) supplies aggregate duration and fiscal impact but no search metrics.  
   • Google’s live “Trending Now” portal permits CSV downloads, yet only for the most-recent 24- to 48-hour windows; it does not expose historical daily series for the keywords in question (Trends.google).  
   • Business Insider’s 2018 “biggest news stories” list acknowledges that the twin January–February shutdowns produced search spikes large enough to rank No. 10 for the year, corroborating salience but not providing the numeric trace (Business Insider, 12 Dec 2018).  
   None of these sources offers the day-level 0-to-100 Google Trends values that the user needs.

3. Persistent information gap relative to the brief  
   Still missing for each episode:  
   • Daily “interest over time” figures (United States geography) for the query “government shutdown [year]” or the broader “government shutdown.”  
   • Identification of the exact peak day (value = 100).  
   • Enumeration of the post-peak decay until the series returns to baseline, so that spike duration can be compared.  
   No open-web document, dataset, or GitHub repository uncovered so far includes those raw numbers.

4. Why web search alone is unlikely to close the gap  
   • Google Trends’ public site only allows manual CSV download of one query and one time window at a time; journalists almost always embed screenshots rather than the file itself.  
   • The automatic CSV links (trends.googleusercontent.com/export…) expire quickly and therefore do not linger in caches or academic archives.  
   • The “Trending Now” feed does publish CSVs, but its horizon is hours, not years.  
   • Academic literature that uses Trends data (e.g., SpringerLink article on COVID-19 sentiment) typically distributes derived statistics, not the source file, and it focuses on different keywords.

5. Feasibility and concrete next step  
   Because the open-web corpus does not contain the needed data, the only viable path is direct extraction from Google Trends:  
   a. Visit trends.google.com → type the exact phrase (with or without year).  
   b. Set “United States, custom range” to a 90-day window centred on each deadline (e.g., 1 Jan–31 Mar 2019).  
   c. Click the three-dot menu → “Download CSV.”  
   d. Repeat for 2018 and 2026.  
   e. Load the three CSVs in a spreadsheet or Python (pandas) and compute:  
      – Peak date = first row whose value = 100.  
      – Post-peak decay = count days until the value stays ≤ 10 (or other threshold) for three consecutive days.  
   This manual or script-based pull (e.g., pytrends) is required; no further open-web searching is likely to surface a ready-made table.

6. Conclusion  
   The latest results reinforce the narrative importance of each early-February shutdown but still leave the core quantitative request unmet. Additional information is therefore required: the raw daily “interest over time” series exported directly from Google Trends for each window. Once those CSVs are in hand, the comparison of spike magnitude and decay length can be executed exactly as the original query specifies.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
