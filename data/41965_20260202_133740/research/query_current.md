Analysis:
To judge whether Google search interest in “government shutdown 2026” will rise, fall, or remain flat over the next ten days, I need to know:
• Whether Congress faces a funding deadline, continuing-resolution expiration, or other trigger that could realistically cause a shutdown discussion between 2 Feb and 12 Feb 2026.  
• How much national attention (headlines, cable news topics, social-media chatter) is currently focused on that possibility and how it is trending.  
• Any fresh polling, congressional scheduling notices, or White House statements that might amplify or calm shutdown talk in the coming days.

Relevant information will come from:
1. General web sources (Congressional calendars, think-tank analysis, CBO schedules, official statements).  
2. Breaking news articles specifically mentioning “government shutdown 2026” or “shutdown February 2026.”  
3. Broader budget-negotiation stories (e.g., “debt-limit,” “funding bill,” “continuing resolution”) dated late January–early February 2026.
