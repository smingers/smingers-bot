Analysis:
Google search‐interest for U.S. government shutdowns reliably spikes only when a funding lapse is imminent (typically in the two weeks immediately preceding the deadline) and then fades quickly after a deal is reached.  
• Historical patterns – “government shutdown 2018,” “government shutdown 2023,” and “government shutdown 2025” – show day-level scores that jump 30-80 points in the final week before a possible shutdown and fall by 20-60 points within ten days once the crisis is averted.  
• Today, 2 Feb 2026, Congress has already cleared a continuing resolution that funds the government until 26 March 2026. Major outlets (AP, Politico, Roll Call) are currently running only background pieces; there is no live countdown or intense partisan standoff. Hence, public attention is moderate (Trend score 49) but there is no catalyst likely to drive a larger surge in the next ten days.  
• Absent fresh drama, search interest usually drifts lower as general news moves on. A modest ±3-point band counts as “Doesn’t change,” but historically a cooling period after the headline passes produces drops of 5-15 points.  
• Upside risk (interest “Increases”) would require a sudden breakdown in budget talks or a new threat (e.g., leadership revolt) that re-ignites shutdown headlines this week—no indicator of that exists in the congressional calendar or whip notices released 1–2 Feb.  

Outside-view expectation: a gradual decline in search volume. Most likely resolution: “Decreases”; second-most: “Doesn’t change”; least likely: “Increases.”
