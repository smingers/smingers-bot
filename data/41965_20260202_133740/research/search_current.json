This marks the second government shutdown in less than three months, reigniting concerns over the frequency of such events. The shutdown reflects the dysfunction of the U.S. political system and the deep partisan divide over how federal funds should be allocated. Although Congress is theoretically required to pass the next fiscal year\u2019s budget by October 1, political gridlock\u2014driven by partisan conflict, lobbying, and public opinion\u2014often prevents timely approval. As a result, temporary funding bills are frequently used to avoid government closure. However, recent disputes over temporary bills have intensified, particularly regarding whether funding addresses each party\u2019s top priorities, leading to longer shutdowns. This erosion of public services has reduced trust in government. Despite expectations that the current bill would pass quickly, the delay in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) indicates the budget lacks completeness, signaling that future funding disputes will remain intense. Historically, bipartisan compromise made progress on contentious issues like healthcare and immigration more achievable. However, today\u2019s political climate resembles that of the pre-Civil War era, with extreme factions dominating both parties and moderates marginalized. This has increased political intransigence, especially in budget debates. The 2018\u20132019 35-day shutdown stemmed from disagreements over funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall; the 2025 43-day shutdown arose from disputes over extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act\u2014both touching on core issues of national identity and societal values. The current delay in ICE funding again reveals deep partisan divisions. With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the political significance of government shutdowns is heightened. In the past year, the Republican-led government\u2019s policies\u2014such as imposing 'reciprocal tariffs' to revive manufacturing\u2014have fueled inflation and higher prices, while aggressive immigration enforcement has increased social chaos and federal-state tensions. Efforts to reduce government roles in healthcare and social welfare have widened inequality. Economic nationalism, unilateralism, and militarism in foreign policy have reinforced perceptions of the U.S. as a source of global instability. The Republican 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) agenda, characterized by exclusionary policies and a focus on power, has not boosted public confidence but instead increased anxiety. Similarly, past Democratic policies that politicized globalization have also contributed to global fragmentation. Neither party\u2019s current approach satisfies the public, and their inflexible stances are expected to intensify. The Republican use of federal agencies like ICE to target Democratic-led states, aiming to alter voter demographics and portray Democrats as ineffective, may escalate into broader political conflict. In a Congress where Republican control is not overwhelming, such tactics represent a strategic effort to gain leverage. However, this strategy deepens national divisions and provides Democrats with stronger grounds to oppose Republican actions. Consequently, the 2026 midterm political landscape may become increasingly volatile, marked by political violence. The U.S. two-party system, now prioritizing opposition over public welfare, has strayed from its core purpose, foreshadowing continued cycles of political turmoil.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:34 PM\nSource:[\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://opinion.huanqiu.com/article/4QCYhEUMvBr)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown May End by February 3, House Speaker Says, Weather Could Influence Timing**\nU.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy stated on February 1, 2026, during an NBC television interview that he is confident the federal government shutdown will be resolved by February 3 at the latest, citing progress toward passing a funding bill. He emphasized that Republican votes are secured and criticized the Democratic Party for opposing the bill's passage. The temporary funding measure expired at 1:00 a.m. on January 31, 2026, triggering the shutdown. The Senate had already passed the fiscal year 2026 budget bill on January 30, but the House must re-pass it for it to become law. The outcome hinges on a vote scheduled for early next week, though weather conditions could potentially influence the timing of the vote and resolution.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 11:09 PM\nSource:[\u795e\u6238\u65b0\u805e](https://www.kobe-np.co.jp/news/zenkoku/compact/202602/0019975874.shtml)\n\n**Video | Explained: Is The US Government Facing Another Government Shutdown?**\nThe U.S. government is facing a partial shutdown beginning at 12:01 AM Eastern Time on January 31, 2026, after Congress failed to pass all necessary funding bills before the deadline. Unlike the record-breaking shutdown of the previous year, this one is expected to be short-lived, as lawmakers have a plan to pass funding legislation when the House reconvenes. Only certain federal departments will be funded, while others\u2014such as Homeland Security\u2014will remain in limbo. The shutdown is a result of legislative inaction, but its duration is anticipated to be brief due to the planned legislative response.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:31 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/videos/explained-is-the-us-government-facing-another-government-shutdown-1054541)\n\n**US government agencies shut down as Trump deal awaits House vote**\nThe U.S. government experienced a partial shutdown on January 31, 2026, after the House of Representatives failed to pass a funding deal before a weekend recess, despite President Donald Trump having reached an agreement with Democrats following the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. The shutdown affected agencies including the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Transportation, Health and Human Services, and Labor Departments, though critical services such as food stamps (via the Department of Agriculture), national parks, veterans' services, and the Justice Department remained funded through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2026. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought stated in a memo that the lapse was expected to be short, with operations potentially resuming the same day the House passes the bill\u2014likely Monday, February 1, 2026\u2014once Trump signs it into law. The Senate had already approved the two-week funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday, January 30, 2026, while negotiations continue on Democratic demands for body cameras, judicial warrants for searches, prohibitions on agent masking, and restrictions on broad immigration sweeps. This marks the second government funding lapse under Trump\u2019s second term, following a 43-day shutdown in the autumn of 2025, which disrupted food aid, canceled thousands of flights, and left federal workers unpaid for over a month. The current situation is less severe due to partial pre-funding, but uncertainty remains over whether the Bureau of Labor Statistics will delay the release of the February jobs report, scheduled for Friday, February 6, 2026, if the shutdown persists. Trump has signaled potential changes to his administration\u2019s deportation campaign, which polls show has become increasingly unpopular and may threaten Republican prospects in the upcoming midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:16 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-3997928)\n\n**What to know about the partial government shutdown and its impact**\nA partial government shutdown began on Saturday, January 31, 2026, primarily affecting the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Transportation, due to a funding lapse for these agencies. Unlike the record-length shutdown in the fall of 2025, this one is expected to be brief, as the House is scheduled to reconvene on Monday and is expected to quickly pass a funding bill. Congress has already passed half of this year\u2019s funding legislation, ensuring continued operations for key programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children), which will remain fully funded through September 30, 2026. SNAP serves about 42 million people, with an average benefit of $190 per person monthly. WIC is also fully funded. The shutdown was triggered by a dispute over the DHS funding bill following the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens, Alex Pretti and Ren\u00e9e Good, by federal agents in Minneapolis. Democrats demanded changes to immigration enforcement, including a code of conduct and identification requirements for federal agents, and sought to remove the DHS bill from the package. To avoid a prolonged shutdown, the White House struck a temporary two-week agreement to fund DHS at current levels while negotiations continue. The Senate passed a five-bill funding package on Friday, but it must be passed again by the House to become law. Essential services such as Social Security, Medicare, and FEMA disaster response will continue, with FEMA estimated to have $7\u20138 billion available for ongoing winter storm recovery efforts. However, FEMA\u2019s ability to issue or renew National Flood Insurance Program policies will pause, similar to the 2025 shutdown. Air traffic control operations will continue, but air traffic controllers will work without pay if the shutdown persists. Previous brief shutdowns, such as a nine-hour shutdown in February 2018 and a weekend shutdown in January 2018, had minimal public impact due to their brevity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:21 PM\nSource:[KRQE 13](https://www.krqe.com/news/national/what-to-know-about-the-partial-government-shutdown-and-its-impact/)\n\n**Partial Shutdown of the U.S. Federal Government Begins on January 31, 2026**\nOn January 31, 2026, a partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government began, due to the lack of approved funding for several agencies despite the U.S. Senate having passed a spending package the previous day. The House of Representatives, which is on recess, has not yet reviewed the Senate-approved legislation, with its next session expected on February 2. Until then, funding for parts of the federal government remains suspended. The key point of contention is funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration and border services. Experts estimate the shutdown could be short-term; if the House passes the package and the President signs it, federal funding could be restored within days.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:17 PM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/vlast/360091_vssha_nachalas_chastichnaya_priostanovka_rabotyi_federalnogo_pravitelstva/)\n\n**Government Shuts Down -- But the Military and Much of Washington Keep Moving**\nA partial U.S. federal government shutdown began on January 31, 2026, at midnight after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the deadline. The U.S. Senate had passed a bipartisan funding package on January 30, 2026, which would fund most federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year and extend Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for two weeks to allow continued negotiations on immigration enforcement policy. However, the House of Representatives was in recess and did not return until Monday, delaying final passage. As a result, agencies without current appropriations began shutdown procedures on Saturday. The shutdown is expected to be brief\u2014potentially ending by Monday or Tuesday\u2014once the House votes on the Senate\u2019s package and sends it to the White House. Military personnel continue to receive pay and are expected to carry out duties, with back pay guaranteed upon resolution. Most civilian defense employees may be furloughed or work without pay if the shutdown extends. Air travel is expected to face delays and slowdowns due to essential staff\u2014such as air traffic controllers, TSA officers, and Customs agents\u2014working without immediate pay, which may reduce staffing levels and cause flight cancellations and congestion. Commissaries, exchanges, and essential base services are expected to remain open or resume quickly. Military families are advised to allow extra travel time, monitor flights closely, and prepare for disruptions. Congressional and White House leaders emphasize a desire to avoid a prolonged shutdown, in contrast to the 43-day closure that ended in November 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:11 PM\nSource:[Military](https://www.military.com/daily-news/investigations-and-features/2026/01/31/government-shuts-down-military-and-much-of-washington-keep-moving.html)\n\n**US Government enters partial shutdown: What to know**\nThe U.S. government entered a partial shutdown on January 31, 2026, after the Senate passed a funding bill through September 2026, but failed to include provisions for new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was temporarily funded separately, allowing Congress to debate new limits on immigration raids, but the House has not yet acted, with a vote expected on Monday. The shutdown affects agencies including Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, while agencies such as the VA, USDA, DOJ, NASA, and FDA remain funded through separate enacted bills. Federal employees in essential roles must work without pay; nonessential staff are furloughed and will receive back pay after the shutdown ends. The crisis follows the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens\u2014Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, and Renee Nicole Good\u2014by federal agents in Minneapolis in January 2026, sparking bipartisan concern. Multiple videos contradicted initial claims that Pretti was 'brandishing' a firearm. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized that Democrats\u2019 demands\u2014ending 'roving patrols,' requiring warrants, mandating body cameras and identification, and establishing an enforceable code of conduct\u2014are not radical but basic law enforcement standards. House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated a fast-track vote may occur on Monday, though a two-thirds majority is required to suspend House rules. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a swift, bipartisan resolution, calling the shutdown 'long and damaging' and praising the Senate's progress. Russ Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed agency heads to execute orderly shutdown plans. The administration hopes the lapse will be short, with full funding to resume once the DHS extension and immigration reforms are finalized.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:43 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/us-government-enters-partial-shutdown-what-to-know-11446947)\n\n**Explained: Why the US Government Has Entered a Partial Shutdown**\nThe United States entered a partial government shutdown on Saturday, January 31, 2026, after Congress failed to pass a full funding package by the midnight deadline. While the Senate approved a stopgap bill funding most federal agencies through September, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was excluded and funded only for two additional weeks, triggering the partial shutdown. The dispute centers on immigration enforcement reforms following the fatal shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by a federal agent in Minneapolis, one of two such deaths involving immigration agents in January 2026. Democrats are demanding stricter oversight, including mandatory body cameras, bans on face masks, visible officer identification, limits on roving patrols, and judicial warrants for searches\u2014framed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a civil liberties test. The Senate passed the bill 71-29 with bipartisan support, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham lifting a procedural hold in exchange for a future vote on banning sanctuary cities. The House of Representatives, out of session until Monday, must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority, delaying final approval. The shutdown is expected to be brief and limited in impact, unlike the 43-day shutdown in late 2025, which cost the economy an estimated $11 billion. Agencies such as transportation, education, and defense are activating shutdown protocols, though essential services continue. Over the next two weeks, lawmakers will negotiate DHS reforms, with Republicans showing openness to some oversight measures but significant disagreements remaining. President Donald Trump has urged House Republicans to approve the deal to avoid escalation. The shutdown reflects a broader trend in Washington: funding agreements are increasingly used as leverage in political battles over policing, civil rights, and the exercise of state power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 10:55 AM\nSource:[Open The Magazine](https://openthemagazine.com/world/explained-why-the-us-government-has-entered-a-partial-shutdown)\n\n**U.S. government enters partial shutdown, but deal seen soon (US10Y:)**\nThe U.S. federal government entered a partial shutdown early Saturday, January 31, 2026, despite the Senate passing a funding package hours earlier.

According to CBS News, there is no desire in Washington to extend the shutdown beyond a brief period, unlike the 43-day closure that occurred in the fall.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:23 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/ssha-rozpochavsya-chastkoviy-shatdaun-cbs-1769847370.html)\n\n**U.S. Government Faces Crisis as Shutdown Looms Over Unapproved 2026 Budget**\nThe U.S. government announced a partial shutdown on January 31, 2026, after the midnight deadline for funding passed without Congress approving the 2026 budget. According to The Herald News, the shutdown occurred because Congress failed to enact the budget, which was expected to be finalized several days earlier. The government may resume operations once the House of Representatives approves funding, with the budget expected to be confirmed no earlier than the first week of February. The impasse was triggered by the fatal shooting of two protesters by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. This marks the second budget-related crisis in the U.S. within a year, as a similar shutdown in late 2025 left thousands of federal employees unpaid and prompted widespread work stoppages and protests.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:02 AM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6795150/)\n\n**Partial Government Shutdown Begins in the U.S. on January 31, 2026**\nA partial government shutdown began in the United States at midnight on January 31, 2026, due to the lack of agreement on funding for certain federal agencies.

The shutdown was triggered by a breakdown in negotiations over the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget, fueled by Democratic outrage over the killing of two protesters in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents, according to officials cited by AFP. While the shutdown is narrower in scope\u2014several departments such as the Department of Agriculture, national parks, veterans' services, and the Justice Department already have full-year funding through September 30, 2026\u2014key agencies including the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Transportation, Health and Human Services, and Labor departments will initiate formal shutdown procedures. The White House Office of Management and Budget confirmed these measures. Congressional leaders are working to secure support for a Senate-backed funding deal, with the House expected to vote early next week. If the House approves the bill early on Monday, government operations could resume as early as that day. This marks the second government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after a 43-day shutdown\u2014the longest in U.S. history.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 05:19 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/us-government-enters-partial-shut-down-as-budget-deadline-passes-talks-stall-101769836651833.html)\n\n**US Senate passes deal expected to shorten government shutdown**\nOn Friday, January 30, 2026, the U.S. Senate passed a last-minute funding deal supported by President Donald Trump, aimed at mitigating the worst effects of an impending government shutdown. The agreement followed Democratic outrage over the killing of two protesters by immigration agents, which had disrupted previous funding negotiations. Despite the Senate's approval, a government shutdown is still scheduled to begin on Saturday, January 31, 2026, because the House of Representatives was out of session and unable to ratify the Senate's agreement before the midnight deadline, resulting in an unavoidable weekend funding lapse. The deal is expected to shorten the duration of the shutdown once the House reconvenes on Monday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 11:46 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94MV7WE)\n\n**Will There Be a New Government Shutdown in the United States?**\nThe United States faces the possibility of a new partial government shutdown beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, January 31, 2026, due to a lack of agreement in the Senate on a federal spending package. This follows a 43-day shutdown in late 2025 and occurs less than three months later. The current impasse centers on Democratic senators refusing to approve funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), linked to the deaths of citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good during protests against immigration operations in Minneapolis. Democrats demand regulatory reforms and oversight mechanisms before releasing funds, while Republican leadership insists on passing the spending bill as a single, unified package. The Senate requires 60 votes to advance legislation, and with Republicans holding 53 seats, they need at least seven Democratic votes\u2014none of which have been secured. The House of Representatives is in recess, requiring any legislative change to be reintroduced there, reducing available time. If no agreement is reached, approximately 90% of discretionary federal spending will be affected, impacting departments including Defense, Treasury, Health, Labor, Education, and Transportation. The Treasury may halt tax refund processing during the filing season, and federal courts could suspend operations starting February 4, affecting judicial and immigration proceedings. However, some agencies will remain operational due to pre-approved budgets through September 2026, including the Department of Justice, FBI, NASA, Interior Department, national parks, Smithsonian museums, SNAP, USPS, and Social Security. Essential employees such as military personnel and air traffic controllers would continue working without immediate pay. Internationally, the shutdown could delay visa and passport processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, reduce administrative staffing, and pause systems like labor certifications and E-Verify for foreign workers. Media and financial analysts report an 80% likelihood of a shutdown, with Bloomberg and DL News noting increased movement toward safe-haven assets amid market volatility. The outcome hinges on a decision before midnight Friday, when current federal funding expires.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:53 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2026/1/28/habra-nuevo-cierre-de-gobierno-en-estados-unidos-582648.html)\n\n**Government Shutdown update 2026: How the next closure could be very different, and why Americans may feel it faster**\nThe U.S. government faces a potential shutdown in early 2026, with political tensions rising over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that Democrats will block any funding bill that includes DHS funding, citing concerns over immigration enforcement, particularly following a fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis during protests. Republicans argue that DHS funding is essential for border security and government operations. With the House of Representatives on break and not returning until February 2, a funding deal appears unlikely. Betting markets reflect growing concern, with Polymarket odds of a January shutdown rising from 9% to 80% in just days. According to Brian Gardner, Chief Washington Policy Strategist at Stifel, a partial shutdown is now most likely. Unlike the October\u2013November 2025 shutdown, some agencies like the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior may remain open due to pre-approved funding, but others\u2014including the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2014could close. Economists at Wells Fargo Securities note that shuttered agencies control about 90% of federal spending. A shutdown could delay federal paychecks, disrupt essential services, slow economic growth, distort key economic data, and negatively impact households, echoing the effects of the 43-day shutdown in late 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:21 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/government-shutdown-update-2026-how-the-next-closure-could-be-very-different-and-why-americans-may-feel-it-faster/articleshow/127705156.cms)\n\n**Government shutdown 2026 fallout: How your student loans, Social Security, and investments could be affected**\nA potential partial U.S. government shutdown by January 30, 2026, threatens critical federal services despite protections for core programs. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' benefits will continue uninterrupted due to permanent funding mechanisms. However, administrative functions will freeze: approximately 6,200 Social Security Administration (SSA) employees are expected to be furloughed, causing significant delays in non-essential services such as new Social Security cards, earnings record corrections, and disability claim processing\u2014wait times could exceed the current 190-day average. Student loan borrowers face delays in loan forgiveness, income-driven repayment adjustments, and error resolution due to staffing cuts at the Department of Education, while new grant awards may pause. Federal housing programs are affected: FHA and VA loans remain available but face extended approval timelines, and USDA loans\u2014critical for rural and low-income buyers\u2014are often suspended entirely during shutdowns. Mortgage rates may temporarily decline due to 'flight to quality' investor behavior, pushing Treasury yields lower, though delayed economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics could increase market volatility. Each week of shutdown is estimated to reduce quarterly GDP by 0.15%, and prolonged fiscal brinkmanship risks long-term damage to the U.S. credit rating, potentially increasing borrowing costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports a $601 billion cumulative 2026 deficit, driven by rising interest payments and shifting tax revenues. The current standoff in the Senate over Department of Homeland Security funding stalls progress, even after the House passed a $79 billion education and research package. Global pressures\u2014including record gold prices exceeding $5,000 per ounce and heightened tensions between Iran and Israel\u2014compound the economic fragility. While the S&P 500 has historically shown resilience during shutdowns, the current environment features a weaker jobs market and inflationary pressures from recent tariffs, heightening investor concern. Diversification and investment in hard assets like gold are recommended as defensive strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 12:45 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/government-shutdown-2026-fallout-how-your-student-loans-social-security-and-investments-could-be-affected/articleshow/127621678.cms)\n\n**NY Perspective: Timing of Discussion on the Need for U.S. Rate Hikes in 2026 Becomes a Key Theme**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (FRB) decided at its December 9\u201310 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to lower the federal funds (FF) rate target by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 3.50\u20133.75%, marking the third consecutive rate cut. Despite this, the FRB indicated a potential pause in rate cuts, citing that inflation remains somewhat elevated and emphasizing the need to monitor labor market and price trends. Three votes opposed the cut, which was within expectations. However, due to the impact of the government shutdown, detailed economic indicators were not fully available, leading market participants to express skepticism about fully accepting the FOMC's policy rate outlook. Looking ahead, the timing of when discussions on the necessity of future rate hikes will begin\u2014particularly in relation to the expected U.S. economic recovery starting around mid-2026\u2014has emerged as a key theme. The policy rate is projected to decline by another 0.25 percentage points by early 2026, but unless economic recovery is delayed, the rate-cutting cycle is expected to conclude by early 2026. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's upcoming monetary policy meeting is expected to proceed with a rate hike, though real interest rates will remain negative, preventing a sharp surge in yen buying. The yen's downward trend is expected to persist for the foreseeable future.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20251212/836064.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Temporary Spending Bill, Ending 43-Day Government Shutdown and Boosting Market Confidence**\nU.S. President Trump signed a temporary spending bill on November 12, 2025, following its approval by both the House and Senate, ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history\u2014lasting 43 days. The bill extends federal funding through January 30, 2026, includes a provision ensuring federal employees will not be laid off before the end of January 2026, and allocates funds to the Department of Agriculture, military construction, and Congress through September 30, 2026. Trump stated, 'With my signature, the federal government is now back in operation.' Federal employees began returning to work on November 13, and air traffic controller shortages are expected to ease, though backlogged cases from the shutdown will take days\u2014or even over a week\u2014for full resolution, with airport flight restrictions potentially lifting within a week. Analysts anticipate a positive market reaction, citing historical trends: after past shutdowns, the stock market has typically risen an average of 12.7% within one year. The Federal Reserve\u2019s likelihood of cutting interest rates is expected to increase due to upcoming economic data, leading to expectations of a weaker dollar and higher U.S. Treasury bond prices. White House Press Secretary Levitt confirmed that the October employment and inflation reports will not be released, but agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Census Bureau are expected to resume operations gradually.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 05:02 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/9138551)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown May End as Senate Passes Temporary Funding Bill; Markets Surge Amid Optimism**\nThe U.S. government shutdown, which had lasted over 40 days, is nearing a potential end as a temporary funding bill passed a procedural vote in the U.S. Senate with 60 votes in favor and 40 opposed, marking a critical step toward resolving the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The bill, which must still be approved by the House of Representatives and signed by President Trump, would fund the government until January 30, 2026, and reverse some recent federal layoffs, though it excludes the extension of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act\u2014a key Democratic demand\u2014instead requiring a vote on the issue by December. Optimism over the progress fueled a strong market reaction on Monday, November 10, 2025: the Nasdaq surged over 400 points in early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose over 300 points, and the S&P 500 gained 1.17%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.91%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSMC) ADRs jumped 3.05%. Major tech stocks led the rally, with Apple up 1.33%, Alphabet (Google) up 3.39%, Microsoft up 1.50%, Amazon up 1.39%, and Meta (Facebook) up 1.94%. Semiconductor stocks also advanced, with Nvidia rising 4.71% and AMD gaining 6.17%. The market rebound followed a recent tech sell-off driven by concerns over high valuations. A resolution to the shutdown is expected to restore access to key economic data on employment and inflation, helping reduce uncertainty around interest rate policy.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20251110004317-260410)\n\n**Government shutdown could delay key economic reports at an especially sensitive time**\nA government shutdown has delayed the release of the U.S. September jobs report, which was scheduled for Friday, October 1, 2025. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), responsible for compiling the data, is currently idled, halting the collection, processing, and dissemination of economic data. This delay leaves businesses and policymakers without critical information on labor market trends at a sensitive time, as hiring slowed sharply in recent months, employers cut jobs in June for the first time since 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August\u2014the highest in nearly four years. The Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates in September amid concerns over labor market weakness, will make its next rate decision in four weeks and relies on up-to-date data. Additionally, the inflation report scheduled for release on October 15, 2025\u2014used to calculate the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026\u2014may also be delayed if the shutdown persists. Inflation rose to 2.9% year-over-year in August, up from 2.7% in July, partly due to President Trump\u2019s tariffs. The BLS confirmed that during the shutdown, no economic data will be collected or shared, and once funding resumes, it will resume operations and issue a revised release schedule. Alternative economic indicators exist but lack the breadth and reliability of the federal government\u2019s monthly surveys of tens of thousands of households and businesses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558020/government-shutdown-economic-data-jobs-inflation)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown Risk Weighs on Stocks; Tech and Market Trends Highlighted**\nThe U.S. government shutdown risk pressured U.S. stocks, with all three major indices opening lower.

Global silicon carbide manufacturer Wolfspeed rose 28% after exiting Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and significantly reducing debt and interest costs. With the government shutdown looming, at least eight U.S. cabinet departments\u2014including Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State, Justice, and Veterans Affairs\u2014released shutdown plans, collectively requiring over 400,000 non-essential federal employees to be furloughed, accounting for more than two-thirds of federal workers. Despite earlier threats of permanent layoffs, few such measures were implemented. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s tariff policies triggered a surge in safe-haven demand, prompting the Swiss National Bank to purchase 50.6 billion Swiss francs ($63.6 billion) in foreign currency in Q2 2025\u2014the highest quarterly intervention in over three years\u2014driving a 7% rise in the Swiss franc against the dollar and a 2.2% rise against the euro. OpenAI reported that its 2025 first-half revenue reached $4.3 billion, exceeding its full 2024 revenue by 16%, but incurred a $13.5 billion loss, primarily due to $6.7 billion in ChatGPT R&D costs, $2 billion in advertising and marketing (nearly double 2024), $2.5 billion in stock-based compensation (nearly double), and $7.8 billion in operating losses. The company expects to meet its 2025 revenue target of $13 billion and cash burn target of $8.5 billion. Tesla announced plans to launch its third-generation humanoid robot in late 2025 and begin mass production in 2026, with Elon Musk projecting 1 million units annually by 2030. Tesla\u2019s board approved a $1 trillion executive compensation package for Musk, consisting of up to 423.7 million restricted shares (12% of adjusted shares), contingent on achieving 12 escalating performance milestones.

The Senate passed a last-minute package funding five agencies through FY2026 (Defense, Labor-HHS, etc.) and a two-week CR for DHS, but House inaction caused a funding lapse [1][7][8].  \n\n2. **February 2 House Vote Deadline**:  \n   The House reconvened on February 2 to vote on the Senate package. Failure to pass it by this date extended the shutdown. Passage required a two-thirds majority under fast-track procedures, needing Democratic support [2][3][5]. Democratic backing depended on White House commitments to ICE reforms (mask bans, body cameras, warrant requirements) [3][6][15].  \n\n3. **February 13 CR Expiration**:  \n   DHS operates under a two-week continuing resolution expiring February 13. If long-term funding with agreed reforms isn't passed by then, another partial shutdown will occur [7][9][12].  \n\n**Core Negotiation Sticking Points**:  \n- **Democrats** demand legislation mandating ICE reforms: no masks/unnmarked vehicles, body cameras, judicial warrants for operations, and a use-of-force code [5][8][15].  \n- **Republicans** oppose linking policy changes to funding; some counter-demanded defunding \"sanctuary cities\" [5][9][14].  \n- **House conservatives** resisted separating DHS from other funding bills [10][14], while **Senate Republicans** preferred 4-6 week DHS extensions versus Democratic pressure for 1-2 weeks to force negotiations [12][14].  \n\n**Current Impact**:  \n- 5 agencies have full-year funding; DHS-related shutdown causes furloughs, halted services (e.g., IRS closures, delayed housing aid), and requires federal employees to report for shutdown duties [1][4][6].  \n- Risks persist: House passage remains uncertain, and the February 13 deadline could trigger renewed shutdown [2][12].  \n\n**Limitations**: Real-time developments post-February 2 (e.g., House vote outcome) aren't captured here. Resolution depends on bipartisan compromise on DHS reforms [9][14][16].\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
