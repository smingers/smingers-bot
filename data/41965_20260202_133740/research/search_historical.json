Previously, his worst approval points had been after \"liberation day\" and during Iran bombings (around -10); the shutdown brought him to -13, described as \"uncharted territory.\"\n\n## Google Trends Data Referenced:\n\n- **Obamacare searches:** According to Nate Silver's analysis cited in the article, searches for Obamacare \"never really went up relative to where they had been before\" during the shutdown.\n\n- **SNAP searches:** Searches for SNAP \"did go up by a lot after we started cutting the benefits,\" suggesting this issue caught people's attention more effectively than healthcare.\n\n## Opinions and Analysis:\n\n**From Joshua Cohen (named source, political theorist/writer):**\n- Democrats' strategy appeared influenced by pundit recommendations, particularly from David Shore and Ezra Klein\n- Democrats \"walked kind of zombie-like into doing the shutdown because Ezra Klein said that this was an important moment\"\n- Democrats \"made fools of themselves\" and gave the Trump administration \"their buy-in for continuing the project\"\n- Democrats showed they weren't committed to the endgame, which should have been forcing Republicans to either remove the filibuster or make compromises\n- The party has entered \"a different era\" controlled by pundits, moving from overconfidence to \"crazy defensive crouch\"\n\n**Note:** The article appears to cut off mid-sentence and may be incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://wtop.com/tech/2025/12/google-reveals-top-search-trends-of-2025/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Google reveals top search trends of 2025\"\n\n**Source:** WTOP News  \n**Date:** December 06, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Government Shutdown Duration:** The article reports a \"historic 43-day-long government shutdown\" that disrupted air travel and left thousands of workers without paychecks.\n\n2. **Government Funding Bill:** President Trump signed a bill in November to fund the government through January 30 (presumably January 30, 2026, given the article's December 2025 date).\n\n3. **Google Search Rankings:** In Google's 2025 \"Year in Search\" report:\n   - \"Government shutdown\" ranked as the #2 top news search in the U.S.\n   - \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (described as President Trump's bill) was the #1 top news search and also appeared in the overall top searches list\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article focuses primarily on Google's annual search trends report for 2025, with the government shutdown being one of several major news topics that dominated American search behavior.

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called it a \"bad deal,\" causing negotiations to stall\n- DHS funding has been contentious following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti (and Renee Good) in Minneapolis by federal agents last weekend\n- Senate Democrats have demanded DHS funding be stripped in exchange for their votes\n\n**Vote Requirements:**\n- Senate needs 60 votes to avert filibuster (Republicans control 53-47, requiring Democratic support)\n- Even if Senate passes the measures, the House must approve changes\n- **House does not return to DC until Monday, Feb. 2, 2026** - meaning a partial government shutdown over the weekend is inevitable\n\n**Context:**\n- Last government shutdown was Oct. 1, 2025 to Nov. 12, 2025 (described as longest in history)\n- A \"National Shutdown\" protest is taking place Friday, Jan. 30, nationwide protesting ICE funding, with activist groups encouraging no school, no work, and no shopping\n\n**Named Source:**\n- President Trump expressed support via Truth Social Thursday evening, stating: \"Hopefully both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed bipartisan 'YES' vote.\"\n- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Senate Republicans \"need to get their act together\" after storming out\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/investigations-and-features/2026/01/28/government-shutdown-risk-grows-funding-deadline-nears-what-we-know.html\">\n# Summary of Article: Government Shutdown Risk Grows as Jan. 30 Funding Deadline Nears\n\n**Source:** Military.com  \n**Date:** January 28, 2026  \n**Author:** Douglas Lindsay\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Funding deadline:** January 30, 2026\n- **Previous shutdown:** A record 43-day government shutdown ended in mid-November 2025 when both parties agreed to a continuing resolution (CR)\n- **Current CR expiration:** The November CR extended funding for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026\n- **House action:** The Republican-majority House recently passed a $1.2 trillion funding package combining several appropriations bills, including DHS funding, which would extend full-year funding through fiscal 2026\n- **Senate threshold:** Bills typically need 60 votes to advance in the Senate\n- **Budget process:** Congress must annually pass 12 appropriations bills; fiscal year runs October 1 through September 30\n\n## Core Issue:\n\nThe primary dispute centers on **Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**, not the overall budget. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have vowed to block any funding package that includes DHS and ICE money without major changes. Democratic demands include:\n- Stronger oversight of immigration enforcement\n- Restrictions on certain ICE activities following recent fatal encounters between federal agents and civilians\n\nSome Democratic senators have called for splitting DHS funding from the broader spending package to allow other agencies to be funded separately.\n\n## Potential Impact:\n\n- About half of federal government operations could be forced to stop or scale back if no funding deal is approved\n- Essential services (national defense operations, air traffic control, public safety programs) would continue\n- Mandatory spending (Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits) would continue as these are funded outside annual appropriations\n- Discretionary programs could be suspended or delayed, including federal contract processing, research grants, regulatory approvals, and administrative services\n- Federal employees could face furloughs or work without pay (though historically receive back pay later)\n\n## Current Outlook:\n\nThe article notes that observers say the risk of a **partial government shutdown** (where only certain departments lack funding) is higher than a full shutdown. With just days remaining before the deadline, no resolution appears imminent.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Compare Google Trends spikes for \u201cgovernment shutdown [year]\u201d around funding deadlines, especially early February periods; list day-level scores and duration of post-deadline drop.\nThe additional sweep of the web confirms \u2013 but does not quantify \u2013 the public-attention surges that surrounded the three early-February shutdown deadlines the user wants to compare.\n\n1. Confirmation of the events and their timing  \n   \u2022 8\u20139 Feb 2018: the two-hour lapse that followed Sen. Paul\u2019s overnight filibuster is listed in CNN\u2019s longitudinal shutdown chart (CNN, 30 Sep 2025).  \n   \u2022 15 Feb 2019: the statutory deadline that ended the 35-day partial closure begun 22 Dec 2018 is likewise recorded by CNN (same source).  \n   \u2022 31 Jan\u20133 Feb 2026: NBC and Economic Times (surfaced in the previous round) describe the weekend lapse and 3 Feb reopening; CNN again notes it in the context of the 2025\u201326 cycle.  \n   The dates therefore remain the right anchors for any Google Trends extraction.\n\n2. What the newly surfaced pages add  \n   \u2022 Pew Research\u2019s December 2025 \u201cPublic Trust in Government\u201d report references the Oct-Nov 2025 shutdown but provides only opinion-poll figures, not search-interest data (Pew Research Center, 4 Dec 2025).  \n   \u2022 CNN\u2019s \u201chistory of US government shutdowns\u201d visual (CNN, 30 Sep 2025) supplies aggregate duration and fiscal impact but no search metrics.  \n   \u2022 Google\u2019s live \u201cTrending Now\u201d portal permits CSV downloads, yet only for the most-recent 24- to 48-hour windows; it does not expose historical daily series for the keywords in question (Trends.google).  \n   \u2022 Business Insider\u2019s 2018 \u201cbiggest news stories\u201d list acknowledges that the twin January\u2013February shutdowns produced search spikes large enough to rank No. 10 for the year, corroborating salience but not providing the numeric trace (Business Insider, 12 Dec 2018).  \n   None of these sources offers the day-level 0-to-100 Google Trends values that the user needs.\n\n3. Persistent information gap relative to the brief  \n   Still missing for each episode:  \n   \u2022 Daily \u201cinterest over time\u201d figures (United States geography) for the query \u201cgovernment shutdown [year]\u201d or the broader \u201cgovernment shutdown.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Identification of the exact peak day (value = 100).  \n   \u2022 Enumeration of the post-peak decay until the series returns to baseline, so that spike duration can be compared.  \n   No open-web document, dataset, or GitHub repository uncovered so far includes those raw numbers.\n\n4. Why web search alone is unlikely to close the gap  \n   \u2022 Google Trends\u2019 public site only allows manual CSV download of one query and one time window at a time; journalists almost always embed screenshots rather than the file itself.  \n   \u2022 The automatic CSV links (trends.googleusercontent.com/export\u2026) expire quickly and therefore do not linger in caches or academic archives.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cTrending Now\u201d feed does publish CSVs, but its horizon is hours, not years.  \n   \u2022 Academic literature that uses Trends data (e.g., SpringerLink article on COVID-19 sentiment) typically distributes derived statistics, not the source file, and it focuses on different keywords.\n\n5. Feasibility and concrete next step  \n   Because the open-web corpus does not contain the needed data, the only viable path is direct extraction from Google Trends:  \n   a. Visit trends.google.com \u2192 type the exact phrase (with or without year).  \n   b. Set \u201cUnited States, custom range\u201d to a 90-day window centred on each deadline (e.g., 1 Jan\u201331 Mar 2019).  \n   c. Click the three-dot menu \u2192 \u201cDownload CSV.\u201d  \n   d. Repeat for 2018 and 2026.  \n   e. Load the three CSVs in a spreadsheet or Python (pandas) and compute:  \n      \u2013 Peak date = first row whose value = 100.  \n      \u2013 Post-peak decay = count days until the value stays \u2264 10 (or other threshold) for three consecutive days.  \n   This manual or script-based pull (e.g., pytrends) is required; no further open-web searching is likely to surface a ready-made table.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The latest results reinforce the narrative importance of each early-February shutdown but still leave the core quantitative request unmet. Additional information is therefore required: the raw daily \u201cinterest over time\u201d series exported directly from Google Trends for each window. Once those CSVs are in hand, the comparison of spike magnitude and decay length can be executed exactly as the original query specifies.</Agent_report>\n"
