## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Actual post-earnings price action (Feb 1):** Stock closed $259.48 on Jan 30, up only 0.46% despite record earnings beat. This muted reaction after initial 2% after-hours pop indicates market skepticism. (Multiple sources confirm: Yahoo Finance, AskNews, Barchart)

2. **Memory shortage headwind:** CEO Tim Cook explicitly warned about margin pressure from memory costs "beyond Q2." This is direct guidance from the CEO, not speculation. (Yahoo Finance, multiple AskNews articles)

3. **Market environment deterioration:** S&P 500 down 0.43%, Nasdaq down 0.94% on Feb 2; broader tech weakness evident. (AskNews - multiple sources)

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Supply constraints confirmed:** TSMC production limits and component shortages noted by multiple analysts (JPMorgan, UBS, Morgan Stanley per AskNews). These create near-term uncertainty.

2. **Elevated trading volume:** 79.6M shares (68% above average) suggests high conviction moves, potentially profit-taking after earnings. (AskNews)

3. **Valuation concerns:** Forward P/E 30.9x vs market ~20x, with multiple analysts noting limited upside at current levels. (Motley Fool, AskNews consensus)

4. **February seasonality:** Historical +1.74% average with 57% win rate, but strength "fades after Feb 15" per EquityClock. (Outside view analysis)

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Analyst price targets:** Targets of $267-$315 are 12-month forecasts, not relevant to 13-day window. (Multiple sources)

2. **China growth:** +37.9% YoY impressive but represents Q1 results, not Feb outlook. (MacRumors)

3. **Institutional position adjustments:** Various funds buying/selling small amounts - normal portfolio rebalancing, not directional signal. (AskNews)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Period:** Feb 2 (Sunday) to Feb 15 (Sunday) = 13 calendar days
- Effective trading period: Feb 3 (Monday) to Feb 14 (Friday) = 10 trading days
- Baseline price: Feb 3 open (likely near $259.48 from Feb 1 close)
- Resolution price: Feb 14 close

**Key Events in Window:**
- Feb 9: Ex-dividend date ($0.26/share ≈ 0.1% yield)
- Feb 12: Dividend payment
- No other major catalysts scheduled

**Timeframe Sensitivity:**

*If halved to 5 trading days (Feb 2-9):*
- Would increase probability of Yes outcome to ~52%
- Immediate post-earnings momentum (even if weak) would dominate
- Ex-dividend drag wouldn't fully manifest
- Less time for supply concerns to weigh on sentiment

*If doubled to 20 trading days (Feb 2-Mar 1):*
- Would decrease probability of Yes outcome to ~42%
- EquityClock pattern of "strength fading after Feb 15" would engage
- More time for memory shortage concerns to materialize
- Q2 guidance execution uncertainty would mount
- March typically weaker than February seasonally

**Critical observation:** The 10-trading-day window sits in the "danger zone" where initial post-earnings enthusiasm has already faded (evidenced by muted Jan 30 reaction) but insufficient time exists for new catalysts to emerge.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 46% (below 50% due to weak post-earnings reaction)

**Factors requiring adjustment:**

**BULLISH ADJUSTMENTS (+):**

1. **Established baseline price:** We now know stock closed $259.48 on Jan 30, not in free-fall. The muted reaction is disappointing but not catastrophic. (+2%)

2. **Strong institutional interest:** Trading volume 68% above average suggests engagement, and some credible analysts (JPMorgan $315 target) remain bullish. (+2%)

3. **Services momentum:** $30B record provides earnings quality that may support valuation over 10 days. (+1%)

**BEARISH ADJUSTMENTS (-):**

1. **Confirmed market environment weakness:** S&P -0.43%, Nasdaq -0.94% on Feb 2 with tech sector under pressure. This is not speculative - it's happening now. (-3%)

2. **CEO's explicit margin warning:** Tim Cook's forward guidance on memory costs is direct, credible, and negative for near-term sentiment. This isn't analyst speculation. (-3%)

3. **Post-earnings momentum failure:** Stock up only 0.46% on Jan 30 despite record beat confirms market disappointment. The "sell the news" pattern is established. (-2%)

4. **Timeframe misalignment with seasonality:** The 10-day window captures only partial February strength, and EquityClock warns of fade after Feb 15. (-2%)

5. **Ex-dividend mechanical drag:** While adjusted prices account for this, the Feb 9 ex-date often creates short-term selling pressure. (-1%)

**Net adjustment:** +5% (bullish) -11% (bearish) = -6%

**Calibrated prediction:** 46% - 6% = **40%**

**Justification for large shift from outside view:**
The outside view 46% already incorporated weak post-earnings momentum. The new information confirms and amplifies this concern:
- We now have hard evidence of market rejection (Feb 2 tech weakness)
- CEO guidance is explicitly cautionary (not priced in previously)
- The baseline price ($259.48) is established, showing limited upside capture from earnings

The reference class (February seasonality) remains somewhat analogous, but the specific post-earnings context and deteriorating market environment make current circumstances materially worse than the average February period.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate check:** 40% implies in 10 similar situations, AAPL would close higher on Feb 15 than Feb 2 only 4 times out of 10. This aligns with:
- Weak post-earnings momentum (confirmed)
- Bearish market environment (confirmed Feb 2)
- CEO margin warnings (explicit guidance)
- Partial February seasonality capture
- Supply chain headwinds

**Confidence intervals:**
- 90% confidence: 30-50% range
- The true probability is unlikely below 30% (February seasonality and strong fundamentals provide floor)
- Unlikely above 50% given confirmed negative momentum and market weakness

**Calibration adjustments:**
- **+5% if overly pessimistic:** Could market stabilize and February seasonality dominate? Possible but CEO warnings and current weakness argue against.
- **-5% if overly optimistic:** Could supply concerns accelerate or market deteriorate further? Very possible given tech sector pressure.

**Final assessment:** 40% represents appropriate weighting of:
- Established negative post-earnings price action (strong evidence)
- CEO's explicit forward guidance concerns (strong evidence)
- Deteriorating market environment (strong evidence)
- Partial February seasonal support (moderate evidence)
- Strong fundamental results (acknowledged but already rejected by market)

The prediction leans bearish because the market has already rendered its verdict on the earnings (muted reaction), and new negative factors (CEO warnings, market weakness) have emerged without offsetting positive catalysts.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will AAPL close higher on Feb 14, 2026 than its Feb 3, 2026 open (≈$259.48)? 10 trading days.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view 46% based on February seasonality (57% win rate) adjusted for weak post-earnings momentum. Inside view 40% further adjusts for confirmed market weakness and CEO warnings. Rooted in base rate but current factors justify downward shift.

3. **Consistency:** "40 out of 100 times, AAPL closes higher on Feb 14 than Feb 3." This aligns with weak post-earnings momentum, CEO margin warnings, and bearish market environment partially offset by February seasonality.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Stock up only 0.46% Jan 30 despite record earnings beat (factual, confirmed multiple sources)
   - CEO Cook explicitly warned of margin pressure from memory costs (factual, direct quote)
   - Market weakness confirmed: Nasdaq -0.94%, S&P -0.43% on Feb 2 (factual, market data)
   - February historical strength fades after Feb 15 per EquityClock (factual, historical pattern)
   - Supply chain constraints confirmed by multiple analysts (factual, analyst reports)

5. **Blind spot:** Market stabilization + memory shortage concerns proving overblown could trigger relief rally. If broader market rebounds and Apple demonstrates supply chain solutions, the strong fundamental results could reassert themselves. This would make 40% look too pessimistic. Probability shift: 40% → 55%.

6. **Status quo:** Stock at $259.48 after earnings, near recent levels. Low volatility scenario favors modest decline given CEO warnings and market weakness rather than sharp moves. Status quo (slight decline) supports sub-50% probability.

Probability: 40%
