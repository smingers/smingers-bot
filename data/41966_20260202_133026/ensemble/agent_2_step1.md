Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **WebWire Press Release (Apple Q1 2026 Results)**: Official Apple earnings announcement. High reliability for factual data: $143.8B revenue (+16% YoY), $2.84 EPS (+19% YoY), iPhone records across all geographies. Tim Cook and Kevan Parekh quotes are factual attributions of management sentiment.

2. **Investment News**: Recaps same Q1 2026 earnings with additional market context—Microsoft's decline, Meta's rally, Tesla after-hours movement. Factual financial data matches other sources. Provides useful context that Apple announced after market close on Thursday (Jan 29, 2026).

3. **MacRumors**: Most detailed breakdown of Q1 2026 results. Adds granular product revenue: iPhone $85.3B (+23.3%), Services $30B (+13.9%), geographic breakdowns (China +37.9%). Crucially notes **Q2 guidance of 13-16% revenue growth**. Reports stock was "up almost 2% in after-hours trading" on Jan 29. High reliability for Apple-specific facts.

4. **Yahoo Finance (Jan 6, 2026)**: Historical context from before Q1 earnings. Notes AAPL trading 8% below 52-week high of $288.62, down 4% in past 5 days, up 8% over 12 months (vs S&P 500's 16%). Q4 FY2025 results: $102.5B revenue. Factual data but pre-dates the strong Q1 report.

5. **Capital.com (Jan 8, 2026)**: Technical analysis piece. AAPL trading ~$257.47 on Jan 8. Lists analyst targets: UBS $280, Morgan Stanley $315, Citi $330, Goldman $320, Wedbush $350. These are 12-month targets, not 13-day forecasts. Technical indicators show RSI ~27.6 (oversold), trading below 20/50-day SMAs but above 200-day. **Opinion caveat**: Analyst price targets reflect long-term views and varied methodologies.

6. **TechStock² (Jan 30, 2026)**: Post-earnings analysis. AAPL gained ~0.6% to $258.28 in premarket on Jan 30 after closing near $256.67 on Jan 29. Notes shares "climbed as much as 3.5% following the announcement before trimming gains." Highlights supply chain concerns (processor constraints, AirPods Pro 3 issues, memory chip pricing). Jacob Bourne (eMarketer) opinion on services importance is expert commentary but speculative regarding hardware margin pressure.

**Agent Report:**

The agent confirms 20 earnings dates back to April 2021 but critically notes: **"Ten-trading-day drift (missing)"** and **"Close-to-close Day-1 % change for 17 of the 20 earnings events"** are unavailable in crawled sources. Only two Day-1 reactions are documented: -1.2% on Jan 29, 2026 and +2.05% on Oct 30, 2025. 

The agent identifies **February seasonality**: Tradewell shows +1.74% average February return (57% win rate) over 43 years, and EquityClock notes AAPL "strength typically fades after 15 Feb." This is relevant factual data.

**Scheduled catalysts before Feb 15**: Ex-dividend Feb 9 ($0.26/share), payment Feb 12, 10-Q filing likely by Feb 12, possible MacBook Pro announcement early February.

**Critical gap**: No comprehensive 10-day post-earnings return distribution despite agent identifying data sources (Stooq). This limits quantitative rigor.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **AAPL 10-day post-earnings returns (last 20 quarters)**: Most specific but data incomplete in sources. Agent notes only 2 of 20 Day-1 reactions documented.

2. **AAPL 13-day returns in February (historical)**: February averages +1.74% with 57% win rate, but this conflates earnings effects with pure seasonality. Period spans Feb 2-15 (9 trading days), not full month.

3. **Large-cap tech stocks' 2-week post-earnings moves**: Too broad; AAPL's iPhone dominance and China exposure create unique dynamics.

4. **AAPL short-term volatility after strong earnings beats**: Q1 2026 was exceptional (+16% revenue vs. guidance of 10-12%). Reference class would be prior quarters with similar surprises.

**Selected reference class**: **AAPL February seasonality combined with immediate post-earnings behavior**, given:
- Specific timeframe matches (Feb 2-15)
- Agent provides February historical data (+1.74% average, 57% win rate)
- Recent post-earnings reaction documented (initial +3.5% after-hours, trimmed to -1.2% Day 1)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 9 trading days (Feb 2 is a Sunday; first trading day is Feb 3, resolution Feb 15 is a Sunday so last trading day is Feb 14). Approximately **9 trading days** from market open Feb 3 to close Feb 14.

**Historical patterns:**

1. **February seasonality**: +1.74% average over 43 years, 57% win rate. However, EquityClock notes strength "fades after 15 Feb," suggesting early-month strength may reverse. This creates uncertainty for a Feb 2-15 window.

2. **Post-earnings drift**: 
   - Jan 29, 2026: Initial +3.5% after-hours, closed -1.2% next day (Jan 30)
   - Oct 30, 2025: +2.05% Day 1
   - Aug 3, 2023: -3.2% Day 1
   
   The Jan 29 reaction shows volatility: enthusiasm followed by profit-taking. TechStock² reports premarket +0.6% on Jan 30 (to $258.28), suggesting stabilization above $256.67 close.

3. **Recent price action**: Jan 8 article noted AAPL at $257.47, down 4% over prior 5 days, RSI oversold at 27.6. By Jan 29 close ($256.67), stock remained range-bound. Post-earnings pop was partially given back.

**Pattern synthesis**: Strong earnings typically produce initial rallies that fade within days. February seasonality is modestly positive but weakens mid-month. Nine trading days is sufficient for mean reversion or continuation depending on momentum.

## (d) Justification

**Bull case (price rises above Feb 2 close):**
- **Exceptional Q1 results**: 16% revenue growth, 19% EPS growth, iPhone revenue +23.3%, China +37.9%—all exceeded expectations
- **Strong Q2 guidance**: 13-16% revenue growth guides to continued momentum
- **February seasonality**: +1.74% average with 57% win rate over 43 years
- **Technical setup**: RSI oversold at 27.6 on Jan 8, potential for bounce
- **Positive catalysts**: Dividend payment Feb 12, possible MacBook Pro launch early Feb
- **Analyst optimism**: Median 12-month target ~$315-320 implies upside from $256-258 range

**Bear case (price falls or stays flat):**
- **Immediate post-earnings fade**: Jan 29 after-hours +3.5% became -1.2% by close Jan 30, showing profit-taking
- **Supply chain concerns**: Processor constraints, AirPods Pro 3 shortages, rising memory chip costs flagged by management and suppliers
- **Valuation**: Trading at ~30x earnings near $3T market cap; high bar for further upside
- **February fade pattern**: EquityClock notes strength "fades after 15 Feb"—our window ends exactly then
- **Macro headwinds**: Tech sector volatility (Microsoft -10% same week), rising Treasury yields (10Y at 4.16%)
- **Short timeframe**: 9 trading days limits magnitude of moves; noise dominates

**Integrating factors:**

The Feb 2 close is likely around $256-258 (Jan 30 premarket $258.28, Jan 29 close $256.67). For AAPL to close higher on Feb 14, it needs to exceed this baseline by even $0.01.

Historical February performance (+1.74% average) suggests modest upside, but the 57% win rate indicates near-coin-flip odds for any given February. The post-earnings pattern shows initial enthusiasm followed by consolidation. Supply chain warnings and macro uncertainty create headwinds.

The 9-day window is too short for analyst targets ($280-350) to matter but long enough for:
1. Dividend-related price action (ex-date Feb 9 often sees small decline)
2. Follow-through from earnings momentum or reversal
3. Macro events (though no major scheduled catalysts)

**Key insight**: The question asks if Feb 15 close > Feb 2 close. Given Feb 2 is Sunday, we're comparing Feb 14 close to Feb 3 open or Jan 31 close (last trading day before Feb 2). If we interpret "Feb 2 close" as Jan 31 close, then we have 10 trading days (Feb 3-14). If it's first trading day of Feb 2 week, it's Feb 3 close, giving us 9 days (Feb 4-14).

**Most likely interpretation**: Comparing Feb 14 close to Jan 31 close (last close before Feb 2 date). Jan 30 premarket was $258.28; assuming Jan 31 close is similar ($256-259 range), AAPL needs to be above that level by Feb 14.

## Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to data:**
- February 57% win rate suggests base rate near 57%
- Post-earnings fade pattern (initial pop reversed) suggests consolidation, not continuation
- Supply chain concerns and macro uncertainty tilt slightly bearish
- Short 9-10 day window reduces signal, increases noise

**Calibration considerations:**
- 57% February win rate is over full month; early-to-mid February subset may differ
- Recent post-earnings behavior (fade after initial pop) suggests <50% odds of sustained rally
- Ex-dividend date Feb 9 typically causes small decline (~dividend yield of ~0.1%)
- Technical oversold condition (RSI 27.6 on Jan 8) may have already bounced by Feb 2

**Balancing factors:**
- Strong fundamentals (earnings beat, guidance) vs. supply chain concerns
- February seasonality (modestly positive) vs. mid-month fade pattern
- Post-earnings momentum vs. profit-taking observed
- Dividend payment (small positive) vs. ex-dividend decline (small negative)

Given the near-term fade after Jan 29 earnings (+3.5% after-hours to -1.2% next day), the supply chain warnings, and the short timeframe limiting upside, I estimate odds slightly below the 57% February base rate.

**Probability estimate**: The combination of post-earnings consolidation, supply chain headwinds, and limited catalysts in a 9-10 day window suggests **48-52% range**. The ex-dividend effect and mid-February fade pattern tilt toward the lower end.

Outside View Prediction:
