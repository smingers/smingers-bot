Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**
1. **MacRumors (Jan 29, 2026)** - High quality press release coverage. Factual Q1 2026 results: $143.8B revenue (+16% YoY), $2.84 EPS, iPhone at $85.3B (+23%). Tim Cook's "staggering demand" quote is executive opinion. Q2 guidance: 13-16% growth projected.

2. **Yahoo Finance (Jan 30, 2026)** - Reputable financial news. Confirms same earnings figures. Tim Cook's warning about "global memory crunch" impacting margins is a critical factual forward-looking statement from a named expert source.

3. **Investor.apple.com** - Administrative info about Feb 24 shareholder meeting. No predictive value for Feb 2-15 price movement.

4. **CNN Business (Jan 1, 2026)** - Year-ahead forecast article. Dan Ives (Wedbush) names AAPL as top 2026 pick (expert opinion). Multiple analyst targets: BofA $7,100 S&P, Deutsche $8,000. Historical pattern: 8% average gain after 15%+ prior year.

5. **Motley Fool (Jan 29, 2026)** - Opinion piece by Daniel Foelber. AAPL down 8.8% YTD as of Jan 29. Forward P/E 30.9x. Author's opinion: "decent but not compelling" - this is identifiable but retail-oriented analysis, not institutional research.

6. **Barchart (Nov 3, 2025)** - Pre-earnings optimism. Citi analyst Atif Malik raised target to $315 (expert opinion). Historical context only, predates actual Q1 results.

**AskNews Articles:**
7. **Defense World (Feb 2, 2026)** - Institutional ownership data. AAPL opened at $259.48 on Feb 1, market cap $3.81T. Consensus target $289.23. Factual institutional positioning data.

8. **Benzinga (Feb 2, 2026)** - S&P 500 down 0.43%, Nasdaq -0.94%, Dow -179 pts on Feb 2. Market-wide weakness context. AAPL specific performance not isolated.

9. **GuruFocus (Feb 2, 2026)** - Citi raised target to $269.01 (down from prior $315 mention in older article). Maintains "outperform." Projects FY26 EPS $8.97. Expert institutional opinion.

10. **Motley Fool (Jan 30, 2026)** - Post-earnings analysis. AAPL closed $259.48 (+0.46%) on Jan 30. Volume 79.6M (68% above average). Memory constraints and AI strategy uncertainty noted.

11. **Benzinga (Jan 30, 2026)** - Memory chip supply crunch confirmed. Micron positioned to benefit. Apple's Cook statement on rising memory prices is direct factual forward guidance.

12. **Barchart (Jan 30, 2026)** - JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee maintains Buy, $315 target. Forward P/E ~31x vs historical super-cycle levels. Expert institutional opinion supporting bullish case.

13. **Zero Hedge (Feb 1, 2026)** - Macro context: PPI rose 0.5% (vs 0.2% expected), Trump appointed Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair nominee (hawkish). Broader market headwinds.

14. **GuruFocus (Jan 29, 2026)** - Pre-earnings: options implied 4% move. Factual options market expectation.

**Quality Assessment:**
- **Strong sources**: Apple's actual earnings results (multiple confirmations), Tim Cook's memory shortage warning (CEO statement), institutional analyst targets from JPMorgan/Citi (named experts)
- **Moderate sources**: Market performance data (Feb 1-2), institutional ownership flows
- **Weak sources**: Retail analyst opinions (Motley Fool author), older pre-earnings speculation

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Earnings beat but muted response** - AAPL closed +0.46% on Jan 30 post-earnings despite 16% revenue beat. Multiple sources confirm stock opened $259.48 on Feb 1. This suggests positive news already priced in.

2. **CEO warning on margins** - Tim Cook explicitly stated memory costs will "negatively impact margins in Q2 and beyond" (Yahoo Finance, Jan 30). This is direct forward guidance from the most authoritative source, creating a known headwind.

3. **Broader market weakness** - S&P down 0.43%, Nasdaq -0.94% on Feb 2 (Benzinga). Materials, tech, financials led losses. Systematic risk factor affecting all stocks.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Institutional analyst targets** - JPMorgan $315 (Barchart, Jan 30), Citi $269 (GuruFocus, Feb 2), consensus $289 (Defense World, Feb 2). These are 4-11% above Feb 1 close of $259.48, suggesting upside but over longer timeframes (typically 12 months).

2. **High valuation** - Forward P/E 30.9-32x vs 10-year avg 22.2x (Motley Fool, Jan 29). Premium valuation limits near-term upside without new catalysts.

3. **Supply constraints** - Multiple sources note memory chip shortages limiting iPhone production (Yahoo, Motley Fool, Barchart). Could cap revenue upside in coming weeks.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Historical post-earnings drift** - My outside view noted 61% positive rate for 9-day post-earnings windows, but this is backward-looking and doesn't account for current valuation/macro context.

2. **AI partnership speculation** - Google Gemini integration mentioned (MacRumors) but no concrete near-term revenue impact quantified.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 9 trading days (Feb 2 close to Feb 15 close).

**Key dates in window:**
- Feb 9: Ex-dividend date ($0.26/share, ~0.1% mechanical impact)
- Feb 12: Dividend payment
- Feb 15: Resolution date

**If timeframe halved (4-5 days)**: Would increase probability of "Yes" to ~60-62%. Shorter windows have less time for negative news to accumulate, and immediate post-earnings momentum (Jan 30-Feb 1) was slightly positive.

**If timeframe doubled (18 days)**: Would decrease probability to ~52-54%. More time allows margin concerns and broader market volatility to materialize. Q2 guidance of 13-16% growth is solid but not exceptional, and memory cost headwinds become more relevant over longer horizons.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 58%** (weighted average of 56% all 9-day windows and 61% post-earnings windows)

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

**Downward pressure (-8 to -10 percentage points):**
1. **Valuation ceiling** - At 31-32x forward P/E, AAPL is at high end of historical range. Strong evidence this limits upside without new catalysts.

2. **CEO margin warning** - Tim Cook's explicit statement about rising memory costs is unprecedented specificity on a near-term headwind. This is strong evidence of a known negative factor not present in historical reference class.

3. **Muted post-earnings reaction** - Stock only up 0.46% day after massive earnings beat suggests market already priced in good news. Strong evidence of limited momentum.

4. **Macro headwinds** - PPI surprise, hawkish Fed Chair nominee, broad market weakness on Feb 2. Moderate evidence of systematic risk.

**Upward pressure (+3 to +5 percentage points):**
1. **Solid fundamentals** - Record revenue, 16% growth, strong China recovery (+38%). Moderate evidence of business strength, but already reflected in Jan 30 price.

2. **Institutional support** - Consensus target $289 (+11% from Feb 1 close). Moderate evidence of analyst conviction, but targets are 12-month, not 9-day.

3. **February seasonality** - Historical 57% win rate in February (outside view). Weak evidence as it's already in base rate.

**Net adjustment: -5 to -8 percentage points from 58% base rate**

The CEO's margin warning and muted post-earnings response are structural factors that make the current situation materially different from the historical reference class. The 61% post-earnings drift rate was calculated over periods when Apple didn't have explicit forward margin pressure from supply costs.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 58% outside view:
- CEO margin warning: -4 pts (strong evidence of near-term headwind)
- Muted earnings reaction: -3 pts (strong evidence momentum exhausted)
- High valuation limiting upside: -2 pts (moderate evidence)
- Macro weakness: -1 pt (moderate evidence)
- Institutional targets supporting: +2 pts (moderate evidence, but long-term)

**Calibrated probability: 50%**

This represents genuine uncertainty. The strong Q1 results provide a floor, but the explicit margin warning and high valuation create a ceiling. Over 9 days, random market noise dominates, and I have no strong directional conviction.

**Sensitivity check**: 
- At 50%, I'm saying it's a coin flip whether AAPL closes higher on Feb 15 than Feb 2.
- At 40%, I'd be saying there's a 3:2 odds against a higher close - that would require stronger conviction in downside catalysts than I have.
- At 60%, I'd be saying 3:2 odds favoring higher close - that would ignore the CEO's margin warning and muted post-earnings response.

50% reflects true uncertainty given offsetting factors.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will AAPL's closing price on Feb 15, 2026 exceed its Feb 2, 2026 close? 9 trading days.
   ✓ Analysis directly addresses this binary outcome.

2. **Base rate**: 58% from weighted historical 9-day and post-earnings windows.
   ✓ Final 50% is rooted to this, with -8 pt adjustment for CEO margin warning and valuation ceiling making current context different.

3. **Consistency**: "50 out of 100 times, AAPL closes higher on Feb 15 than Feb 2."
   ✓ This makes sense given offsetting bullish (strong earnings) and bearish (margin warning, high valuation) factors creating genuine uncertainty.

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Tim Cook warned memory costs will hurt margins Q2+ (strong, factual CEO statement)
   - Stock only +0.46% post-earnings despite massive beat (strong, market reaction data)
   - Forward P/E 31-32x vs 22x historical avg (moderate, valuation constraint)
   - Consensus analyst target $289, +11% upside (moderate, institutional support)
   - Broader market down Feb 2: S&P -0.43%, Nasdaq -0.94% (moderate, systematic risk)
   ✓ All verified from multiple reliable sources.

5. **Blind spot**: If Apple announces a major AI breakthrough or foldable iPhone launch date in next 9 days, stock could surge 5-10%, making my 50% look overly cautious. Probability of such announcement: <5%, so doesn't materially change forecast.

6. **Status quo**: Stock closed ~$259 on Feb 1-2. Over 9 days with 5.6% historical volatility, "no change" is within 1 standard deviation. Given no major catalysts scheduled before Feb 15, slight bias toward status quo supports 50% vs extreme probabilities.

**Probability: 50%**
