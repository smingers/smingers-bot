Analysis:

1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
Question resolves **Yes** if **AAPL’s official close on 2026-02-15 (effectively the last close before/at that date, via Yahoo Finance API)** is **strictly higher** than **AAPL’s close on 2026-02-02**.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)

- MacRumors (Jan 29, 2026) — High quality for Apple-specific facts (earnings transcript/press-release level details).  
  Facts: Q1 FY26 revenue $143.8B (+16% YoY), EPS $2.84 (+19%), iPhone $85.3B (+23%), Services $30B (+14%), China +38%, Q2 guide 13–16% rev growth, GM 48–49%.  
  Opinions: management’s optimism (“remarkable quarter”)—useful as sentiment, not as a price predictor.

- Yahoo Finance (Jan 30, 2026) — Good secondary reporting; mixes facts with narrative.  
  Facts: beat on rev/EPS; mentions Cook warning on memory crunch hitting margins.  
  Opinion/interpretation: “stock falls” framing; useful for how market digested the news (muted/negative initial reaction).

- Apple Investor Relations (shareholder meeting notice) — Primary source but not price-relevant for this 2-week horizon; mostly administrative.

- CNN Business (Jan 1, 2026) — Broad market outlook; medium relevance.  
  Facts: S&P 500 2025 return, strategists’ 2026 targets.  
  Opinion: bullish “AI supercycle / rate cuts” theses; too broad for a 9-trading-day AAPL call, but informs macro backdrop and risk-on/risk-off tone.

- Motley Fool (Jan 29, 2026; plus Jan 30 “market today”) — Mixed quality; generally accurate on facts but heavy commentary.  
  Facts: notes AAPL YTD underperformance, valuation discussion, earnings recap, volume.  
  Opinion: “not compelling,” “best play” style takes—treat as weak evidence.

- Barchart / GuruFocus / Investopedia pre-earnings options pieces (Jan 29–Feb 2) — Moderate quality for describing **market-implied volatility**.  
  Facts: options implied ~4% post-earnings move range; Citi/JPM target updates.  
  Opinion: target-price framing; 12-month targets are weakly informative for a ~2-week horizon.

- AskNews / DefenseWorld institutional holding blurbs (Feb 1–Feb 2) — Low-to-moderate value.  
  Facts: ownership changes (often stale—Q3 2025), analyst consensus counts/targets.  
  Opinion: editorialized “largest position” narratives; not a near-term catalyst.

- AskNews market wrap (Benzinga, Feb 2) — Moderate relevance for near-term tape.  
  Facts: indices down, PPI surprise, sector weakness including tech; contextualizes a mild risk-off impulse that can dominate short horizons.

- “Weekend roundup” (ZeroHedge/Newsquawk style) — Lower reliability / very noisy macro-geopolitical compilation. Use only for the broad point: macro/geopolitical headline risk is elevated; ignore specifics for pricing.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (material directional pull)
- None that *mechanically* forces AAPL up/down by Feb 15. This is a short-horizon equity direction question; most inputs are soft and noisy.

Moderate evidence (meaningful but not decisive)
- Earnings beat + strong Q2 guidance: Multiple reliable sources agree Apple printed record results and guided 13–16% YoY growth. This is a **supportive fundamental impulse** that often reduces left-tail risk over the next couple weeks (moderate upward pull).  
- Market’s immediate digestion was muted/partly negative (stock “edged lower” / “closed flat-ish”): suggests good news was partly priced, limiting upside drift (moderate downward pull).  
- Macro tape turned cautious (PPI hotter; uncertainty over rate-cut path / next Fed chair tone; tech sector weakness in market wrap): for a 9-session horizon this can dominate idiosyncratic fundamentals (moderate downward pull).

Weak evidence (small nudges)
- Dividend/ex-div mechanics (Feb 9 record/ex date; pay Feb 12): typically a small predictable price adjustment around ex-div; directionally slightly negative around ex-date but tiny versus daily volatility.  
- Analyst target prices / “Moderate Buy” consensus: 12-month horizon; weak for 2 weeks.  
- Institutional position-size news (often lagged filings): weak for this window.  
- Technical pattern articles: weak; can help narrative but low forecasting power.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Horizon: from **close Feb 2, 2026** to **close associated with Feb 15, 2026** (effectively last market close before/at Feb 15; likely **~9 trading sessions**).  
- If timeframe were halved (~4–5 sessions): macro/flow noise dominates even more; I’d move closer to 50/50 (less time for any post-earnings “drift”).  
- If timeframe were doubled (~18 sessions): fundamentals/earnings guidance and mean reversion would matter more; I’d edge slightly more bullish than today’s call (more time for “good earnings + guidance” to express).

5) (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from the outside-view base rate)

Outside view base rate given: **49% Yes**.

What’s new / most decision-relevant for Feb 2 → Feb 15:
- Apple’s earnings were objectively strong (revenue/EPS beat, strong guidance). That typically **reduces the chance of a meaningful near-term drawdown** absent a macro shock, and creates some probability of a grind higher as investors re-risk (pushes up from 49).  
- But the market reaction being “not impressed” (flat-to-down despite a big beat) is a real signal: it implies (i) valuation/positioning may be heavy, and/or (ii) forward concerns (memory cost/supply constraints) are salient (pushes down).  
- Macro is mildly risk-off (PPI surprise, rate-cut uncertainty, tech weakness). In a ~2-week window, macro beta often overwhelms single-name narratives (pushes down).  

Net: I see a small upward nudge from the earnings/guidance “floor,” mostly offset by the muted reaction + macro. Because the question is a simple “higher than” threshold (not “up by X%”), even small positive drift matters; I end slightly above my 49% base rate rather than below it.

Probability calibration
- Start (outside view): 49%  
- +3% for strong earnings + strong Q2 guide reducing near-term downside odds (moderate evidence)  
- -1% for muted/negative immediate reaction suggesting much was priced + margin/supply worry salience (moderate)  
- 0% net adjustment for dividend mechanics (tiny) and analyst targets (weak)  
=> Inside view: **51%**

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Yes if AAPL close on 2026-02-15 (latest close from Yahoo Finance) > AAPL close on 2026-02-02.  
2. Outside view base rate: 49% Yes.  
3. Consistency: “51 out of 100 times, AAPL’s Feb 15 close is higher than its Feb 2 close.” Plausible for a 2-week equity move.  
4. Key evidence: (i) record quarter + raised/strong guidance; (ii) management warning on memory costs/supply; (iii) macro risk-off tape (PPI/rates) and muted post-earnings reaction.  
5. Blind spot: a sudden macro shock (rates spike/geopolitical escalation) or a sharp AI/semis-led rally could dominate and make 51% look silly.  
6. Status quo: short horizon, high noise; stayed near 50% with only a slight tilt.

Probability: 51%
