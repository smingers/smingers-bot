Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
(1) MacRumors (29 Jan 2026) – Factual earnings numbers and guidance taken from Apple’s 10-Q; CEO/CFO quotes are company self-assessment (opinion). High data quality, very recent.  
(2) Yahoo Finance / Benzinga news flow (30 Jan – 2 Feb 2026) – Market-close prices, index moves, option-implied volatility; reliable for raw prices, but the framing (“investor caution”) is journalistic opinion.  
(3) GuruFocus & Motley Fool earnings write-ups (30 Jan 2026) – Repeat official figures, add analyst price targets; opinions come from Citi, JPMorgan etc. Identifiable experts → moderate weight.  
(4) DefenseWorld institutional-holding blurbs (1–2 Feb 2026) – SEC-filed holding data (factual) plus consensus rating statistics (compiled from FactSet; moderate quality).  
(5) CNN Business 1 Jan 2026 macro outlook – Broad 2026 equity forecasts from named strategists; useful for background drift but dated for a two-week horizon.  
(6) Zero Hedge weekend wrap (1 Feb 2026) – Mixed headlines; largely opinionated and anonymous—low evidentiary weight.  
(7) Technical-analysis pieces (TalkMarkets 9 Jan 2026) – Pure opinion, no forward-looking edge; weak weight.  

(b) Evidence analysis (strength rating in brackets)  
Positive toward “Yes”:  
• Post-earnings-announcement drift: Apple beat revenue/EPS and raised Q2 guide; academic PEAD literature + mega-cap precedents suggest mild upward drift over the next 10–15 trading days. (Strong)  
• Fresh analyst target hikes (Citi $269, Rosenblatt $267, Evercore $330) keep narrative constructive; upgrades usually correlate with short-term inflows. (Moderate)  
• Dividend-capture dynamics – record date 9 Feb; buying pressure tends to precede ex-div, the mechanical $0.26 drop is only ~-0.10 %. (Moderate)  
Negative toward “Yes”:  
• Macro wobble – S&P 500 has fallen three straight sessions on hawkish Fed-chair headlines and higher PPI. Short horizons are highly correlated with index moves. (Moderate)  
• Memory-chip inflation flagged by Tim Cook likely to cap margin enthusiasm; several articles highlight this risk and the stock faded after the beat. (Moderate)  
• Ex-div reduction ($0.26) on 9 Feb mechanically lowers the bar—but also removes one day of positive carry, so net effect ~-0.1 %. (Weak)  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 9–10 U.S. trading days (close 2 Feb → close 13 Feb).  
If the window were halved (≈5 days) I would trim probability 2 ppt (less time for drift).  
If doubled (≈20 days) I would raise probability 3 ppt but also widen uncertainty because new macro news would loom larger.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: A large-cap U.S. stock finishes higher over any random 10-day span roughly 52–55 % of the time; Apple’s own February seasonality (57 % monthly win-rate) nudges that to 55 %.  
Inside-view upward forces—PEAD after a decisive beat, ongoing analyst upgrades and a pre-record-date bid—outweigh, but do not swamp, macro headwinds and valuation concerns. Net +1 ppt for PEAD, +1 ppt for dividend-capture, -1 ppt for macro/Fed uncertainty → 56 %.

Probability calibration  
My final inside-view estimate: Apple closes higher on (or immediately before) 15 Feb 2026 in 56 cases out of 100. Small changes in inputs move the probability roughly 3–5 ppts; no single factor is strong enough to justify an extreme stance.

Checklist:  
1. “Will AAPL’s closing price be above the 2 Feb 2026 close on the 15 Feb 2026 reference close (≈13 Feb trading day)?” ✔  
2. Base rate 55 %; final 56 % rooted in modest inside-view tweaks.  
3. Consistency: “56 out of 100 times, AAPL will be higher on the target date.” ✔  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w): a) Earnings beat + positive guidance, b) Post-earnings drift studies, c) Analyst target raises, d) Pre-dividend buying, e) Fed/PPI drag.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden broad-market correction (>-3 %) before 13 Feb would swamp firm-specific drivers and flip outcome.  
6. Status-quo bias considered; kept forecast close to coin-flip.

Probability: 56%
