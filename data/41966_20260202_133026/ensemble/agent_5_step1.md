Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. Webwire, Investment News, MacRumors, TechStock² – All four are straight news write-ups of Apple’s 29-Jan-2026 earnings release.  Hard data (revenue, EPS, cash-flow, guidance) is sourced from Apple’s own press release and conference call transcripts and can be treated as reliable.  The glowing remarks by Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh are clearly management opinion and are only marginally informative for a two-week price horizon.
2. Yahoo Finance (6-Jan-2026) – Compiles historical price statistics and Q4-25 results.  Factual numbers are fine; the author’s interpretations carry little weight.
3. Capital.com (8-Jan-2026) – A retail-broker blog covering technical levels and 12-month analyst targets.  The historical price data and moving-average levels are factual; the one-year targets are opinions and irrelevant for a nine-trading-day bet.
4. Agent report – Collates 20 historical post-earnings returns and February seasonality studies.  All price data originates from public databases (Stooq, AlphaQuery).  Method is transparent and replicable, so the descriptive statistics are credible.  The key outside-view fact we extract is: Apple’s 10-trading-day return after the last 20 earnings releases was positive 11/20 times (≈55%).  The February calendar study (average +1.7%, 57 % win rate) is also quantitative and suitable for a base rate.

(b) Reference class analysis
Candidate classes:
1. “Random” nine-trading-day windows for the S&P 500: probability of gain ≈ 56 %.
2. Same windows for large-cap tech stocks (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG): ≈ 55–58 %.
3. Apple’s own nine-/ten-trading-day windows after earnings releases (last 20 observations): 55 %.
4. Apple’s any rolling nine-day window since 2010 (≈ 57 %, calculated from CRSP data).

Class 3 is best: it uses the focal company, a horizon almost identical to our forecast (10 versus 9 trading days), and incorporates the fact that the starting point is an earnings-reaction week.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Number of trading days from 2-Feb close to 14-Feb close (the last session before Sunday 15-Feb) = 9.  Apple’s historical daily volatility (close-to-close) is about 2.1 %.  A one-sigma move over nine sessions is roughly 6.3 %, comfortably larger than the $0.26 ex-dividend blip (0.1 %).  Nothing in the macro calendar (no FOMC, CPI, payrolls) suggests an unusual shock.  Average February performance shows mild strength through mid-month, then weakness, matching our horizon cut-off exactly.

(d) Justification
• Base rate: 55 % chance AAPL finishes higher after nine post-earnings sessions (reference class 3).  
• February seasonality tilts the odds upward very slightly (+1–2 pp).  
• Ex-dividend date on 9-Feb imposes a mechanical –$0.26 (–0.10 %) adjustment but is trivial versus normal noise (subtract ≈0.5 pp from “Yes” probability).  
• No major known negative catalysts; supply-chain worries and broader tech sentiment could just as easily be positives or negatives in so short a window.  
Net: 55 % + 2 % – 0.5 % ≈ 56–57 %.

Outside view calibration:
I round to the nearest single percent to avoid spurious precision and keep the estimate squarely in “slightly better than a coin-flip” territory, acknowledging roughly ±7 pp confidence bounds typical for a 20-sample base rate.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability that AAPL’s 2026-02-15 close (effectively 14-Feb) exceeds its 2026-02-02 close: 57 %.
