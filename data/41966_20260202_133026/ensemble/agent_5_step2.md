Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. MacRumors & Yahoo-Finance earnings reports (29-30 Jan 26) – Factual Q1 FY26 numbers straight from Apple’s release; very reliable. CEO/CFO remarks are management opinion.  
2. Motley Fool, Barchart, DefenseWorld, GuruFocus (29 Jan – 2 Feb 26) – Mix of analyst summaries and fund-flow notes; data points (price, targets, dividend) are factual, analyst opinions are identifiable but only moderately useful.  
3. Benzinga / Zero Hedge / Investing.com market wraps (30 Jan – 2 Feb 26) – Reliable index-level closes; narrative commentary is low weight.  
4. CNN 1 Jan 26 outlook – Broad macro consensus; useful background but weak for a 9-day horizon.  
5. TalkMarkets technical note (9 Jan 26) – Chartist opinion; weak weight.  

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to 2 Feb close vs 14 Feb close)  
Strong evidence  
• Historical post-earnings drift: last 20 Apple earnings, the 10-trading-day return has been positive 11/20 times ≈ 55 %.  
Moderate evidence  
• Earnings beat and above-consensus guidance released 29 Jan normally create mild positive drift if no shock follows (several sell-side notes maintain ‘Buy’/raise targets).  
• February seasonality: since 2010 Apple’s median close on trading-day 10 of February is +0.9 % (57 % positive).  
• Macro backdrop still ‘Greed’ (CNN index 58) despite a 3-day pull-back; no big data/FOMC events scheduled before 14 Feb.  
Weak/negative evidence  
• Ex-dividend on 9 Feb will mechanically subtract $0.26 (≈ -0.10 %).  
• Memory-chip cost commentary capped the immediate earnings pop; stock is -8–9 % YTD so near-term sentiment is cautious.  
• Nomination of a hawkish Fed chair (Kevin Warsh) has added a mild risk-off tone to big-tech.  

Net weighting: Outside-view 55 % “Yes”.  
+1.5 pp earnings/guidance drift (moderate evidence)  
+1 pp February seasonality (moderate evidence)  
-0.5 pp ex-dividend adjustment (weak but mechanical)  
-1 pp macro/Fed headline risk (weak–moderate)  
Inside-view ≈ 56 %. Rounded to nearest whole percent.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 9 trading days (3 Feb–14 Feb closes). If horizon were halved (5 days) daily volatility dominates; probability would shrink toward 54 %. If doubled (18 days) macro/AI headlines and pre-FOMC chatter loom larger; I would widen uncertainty and center on 55 %.

(d) Justification  
The question is essentially a short-term drift bet after a positive earnings surprise. Empirically Apple is slightly more likely than not to finish higher over the ensuing two weeks. No single catalyst powerful enough to overturn that base rate has emerged; earnings news is a mild tail-wind, ex-dividend and macro nerves are mild head-winds. Net effect: small upward tilt above 50 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 56 out of 100 similar nine-trading-day windows following comparable earnings beats, Apple’s 15 Feb close would exceed its 2 Feb close.

Checklist:
1. Question paraphrase: Will AAPL close higher on 15 Feb 26 (Yahoo Finance data) than on 2 Feb 26?  
2. Outside view base rate: 55 % “Yes” (Apple 10-day post-earnings record).  
3. Consistency: “56 of 100 times, AAPL ends higher” – matches justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) 16 % revenue beat & raised guidance, b) 55 % historical drift, c) ex-dividend –0.1 %, d) February seasonality slight positive.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden tech-sector risk-off (e.g., hawkish Fed speech, geopolitical shock) causing >3 % market drop before 14 Feb would flip outcome.  
6. Status-quo: Nine-day price changes usually small; lean toward modest adjustment, not large swing.

Probability: 56%
