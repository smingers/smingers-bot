<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize AAPL price reaction after its last 20 earnings reports; provide average and distribution of 10-trading-day returns post-report, note any February seasonality, and list major scheduled catalysts before 2026-02-15.
The coverage assembled so far lets us satisfy three-quarters of the original brief, but the numerical heart of the assignment—the series, average and distribution of 10-trading-day returns after each of Apple’s last 20 earnings releases—remains unbuilt.  Below is a consolidated status review, citing only material contained in the latest crawl.

1. Earnings chronology (fully sourced)
   • AlphaQuery lists the 20 most-recent earnings dates back to 28-Apr-2021, all after-close releases (AC).  The exact sequence is 29-Jan-2026, 30-Oct-2025, 31-Jul-2025, 01-May-2025, 30-Jan-2025, 31-Oct-2024, 01-Aug-2024, 02-May-2024, 01-Feb-2024, 02-Nov-2023, 03-Aug-2023, 04-May-2023, 02-Feb-2023, 27-Oct-2022, 28-Jul-2022, 28-Apr-2022, 27-Jan-2022, 28-Oct-2021, 27-Jul-2021 and 28-Apr-2021 (AlphaQuery earnings-history page—cited in prior round and reconfirmed).

2. One-day price reaction (partially populated)
   Optionslam supplies close-to-close moves for the two most-recent prints: –1.2 % on 29-Jan-2026 and +2.05 % on 30-Oct-2025 (Optionslam earnings-move table).  IBKR Campus had –3.2 % for 03-Aug-2023 (earlier round).  The other 17 events still need to be calculated from daily closes.

3. Ten-trading-day drift (missing)
   None of the new hits contains a ready-made 10-day return series.  However, Stooq hosts a freely downloadable, split- and dividend-adjusted daily file for AAPL that spans decades and is directly accessible in CSV format (Stooq historical-data page).  With that single dataset, both the day-one and the 10-day returns can be computed in a few lines of pandas or in Excel:
        Day-1 %  = (Close T+1 ÷ Close T–1) – 1
        Day-10 % = (Close T+10 ÷ Close T–1) – 1
   Once the 20 Day-10 observations are generated, mean, median, standard deviation, win-loss count and a six-bucket histogram (<–10 %, –10 % to –5 %, –5 % to 0 %, 0–5 %, 5–10 %, >10 %) can be produced in minutes.

4. February seasonality (complete)
   • Tradewell’s 43-year calendar study shows Apple’s average February return at +1.74 % with a 57 % win rate (Tradewell.app—captured previously).  
   • EquityClock notes that AAPL strength typically fades after 15 Feb each year (EquityClock technology calendar—earlier crawl).  
   Together these meet the “note any February seasonality” requirement.

5. Major scheduled catalysts before 15-Feb-2026 (complete)
   Company-specific
   • 09-Feb-2026 ex-dividend date, $0.26/sh; payable 12-Feb-2026 (Apple press release 29-Jan-2026—prior round).  
   • Form 10-Q for FQ1-26 is historically filed within 12 calendar days of the call, implying on or before 12-Feb-2026.  
   • Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman expects a MacBook Pro press-release launch “February through March,” with rumour sites pegging early February (MacRumors 01-Feb-2026—earlier round).  
   Macro/industry
   • No FOMC meeting, CPI release, non-farm payrolls, CES or Mobile World Congress falls inside the 02-Feb- to 15-Feb-2026 window (standard economic/event calendars reviewed earlier).

6. Information gaps still open
   a) Close-to-close Day-1 % change for 17 of the 20 earnings events.  
   b) The full 20-observation 10-trading-day return series along with the requested descriptive stats and histogram.

7. Data already available to close the gaps
   • Daily adjusted closes: downloadable free of charge from Stooq (AAPL.US Historical data page—Stooq).  
   • Earnings dates (timestamps) to align the calculation: AlphaQuery.

8. Next action required
   Download the Stooq CSV, perform the two straightforward calculations above, and compile the summary statistics.  No additional third-party source is necessary; the raw data and the methodology are in hand.

In short, the qualitative components—earnings calendar, February bias, and pre-15-Feb-2026 catalysts—are fully documented.  What remains is purely mechanical number-crunching from publicly available price data to generate the 10-day post-earnings return matrix and its distribution.  Until that numeric table is produced, the deliverable is not fully compliant with the original query.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
