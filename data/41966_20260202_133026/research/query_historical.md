Analysis:
The question hinges on AAPL’s price movement over a very short 9-trading-day window (Feb 2 → Feb 15).  The most useful historical context therefore includes: 1) whether Apple is scheduled to report earnings or hold a major event during that window (earnings releases often drive large moves); 2) how AAPL has behaved in the two weeks following its last several earnings announcements, particularly when those fell in late January/early February; 3) current analyst sentiment and news flow that could spark momentum in either direction; and 4) any macro or Fed events occurring before Feb 15 that traditionally influence mega-cap tech stocks.  Gathering this information requires a mix of basic web search (to confirm calendar events and analyst chatter) and a deeper, statistics-oriented agent query (to pull and analyze historical post-earnings price data and seasonal patterns).
