The S&P 500 also fell to 6,939.03, down 29.98 points. The downturn followed a stronger-than-expected December 2025 Producer Price Index (PPI) and the announcement by former President Donald Trump that Kevin Warsh, a known hawkish figure, would become the next Federal Reserve Chair. This shift increased uncertainty around future interest rate cuts, prompting investors to take profits. Sector-wise, telecommunications services rose while semiconductors and related manufacturing declined. SanDisk (SNDK) surged on strong second-quarter results and robust demand for AI data center memory chips. Apple (AAPL) rose despite concerns over memory price increases and supply constraints.

Silver producers such as Hudbay Minerals (HL), Coeur Mining (CDE), and Pan American Silver (PAAS) saw significant sell-offs. Footwear company Deckers Outdoor (DECK) surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year outlook, driven by strong performance in brands like UGG and HOKA.

CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that rising memory prices, driven by high demand for AI applications, would negatively impact gross margins in Q2 and beyond, stating, 'Beyond Q2, we do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly.' Micron (NASDAQ: MU), a key U.S.-based memory chip supplier for Apple\u2014having sourced 20 billion chips from the U.S. in 2025\u2014is positioned to benefit significantly from this trend. The company is a major producer of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI data centers, and its stock has surged amid a memory chip supply crunch. Micron's fiscal second-quarter earnings per share guidance nearly doubled analyst expectations, and the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 based on fiscal 2026 estimates.

However, JPMorgan senior analyst Samik Chatterjee maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing that AAPL is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 31x\u2014lower than its historical levels during prior super cycles. Chatterjee argues that Apple\u2019s long-term supplier contracts mitigate margin pressure from higher memory costs and anticipates strong future growth driven by a multi-year artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade cycle. He projects a price target of $315, implying nearly 24% upside from current levels. Additional catalysts include Apple\u2019s partnership with Google to integrate Gemini into its ecosystem, a planned Siri revamp, and speculation about a foldable iPhone launch by late 2026, which could increase average selling prices (ASPs) and boost share prices in 2026. Options traders also show confidence, with the upper strike price for contracts expiring mid-April set at $275.

Options Signal a Sharp Stock Move Ahead**\nApple (AAPL) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday, January 29, 2026. Options pricing indicates a potential stock movement of approximately 4% in either direction by the end of the week, implying a trading range between $247 and $266 based on the prior close near $256.

Based on Wednesday's closing price of $256, this could push the stock as high as $266 or as low as $247.

The rebound followed a period of declining momentum, which had raised concerns about iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014and rising component costs. Evercore ISI reaffirmed its 'outperform' rating and raised its price target to $330, citing strong premium iPhone demand, Apple\u2019s pricing power, scale advantages, and ecosystem strength as key drivers. Analysts note Apple\u2019s ability to absorb rising memory and storage costs through long-term supplier contracts and its in-house component strategy. However, risks remain: escalating RAM and storage prices could pressure margins, and China\u2019s iPhone sales trends are a critical watchpoint for market share and upgrade cycles. Investors are also focused on progress with 'Apple Intelligence,' the company\u2019s generative AI initiative, and its impact on user engagement and device upgrades. The upcoming earnings report will center on three key signals: iPhone demand trajectory, services revenue growth, and tangible advancements in AI integration. Apple continues to trade at a premium, making it sensitive to any shortfall in unit sales, margins, or AI competitiveness relative to rivals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 07:45 AM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/apple-aapl-stock-breaks-losing-run-analysts-bullish-before-earnings/)\n\n**Apple Approaches Potential Final Push Within An Ending Diagonal Structure**\nApple (AAPL) continues its upward trajectory in early 2026, consistent with prior technical analyses from October 15 and November 18, 2025. The stock has been trading steadily higher through the second half of 2025, confirming the broader uptrend remains intact. Price action has respected rising support levels, but recent developments suggest the rally may be entering a more mature phase. Technically, Apple is currently in a wave four pullback within an ongoing advance, a normal correction in an uptrend that could provide a base for another upward move. The key support zone is around $252, where a rising trend line from April intersects current price action. If support holds near $252, Apple could see one final rebound toward the upper boundary of the current ending diagonal structure. However, ending diagonal patterns often signal slowing momentum and increasing risk.

(AAPL) stock has traded in a narrow range between $268.47 (Nov. 7 low) and $286.19 (Dec. 2 closing peak) as of Dec. 30, 2025, with a current price of $272.93. Despite analysts' average price target of $287.74\u20145.4% above the current price, and individual targets ranging from $285.20 to $327\u2014AAPL has shown minimal price movement. The author argues that shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) put options has been the best strategy over the past month, citing a significant drop in premium values: from $2.27 and $3.40 to $0.13 and $0.61, respectively, for the $265.00 and $270.00 strike puts expiring Jan. 2, 2026. The author recommends rolling the trade into a new expiration, such as the Jan. 30, 2026, $260.00 put, which offers a 1.04% monthly yield ($2.70 premium on a $260 strike). This strategy allows investors to collect income while waiting for a potential upside, with the obligation to buy AAPL at a price nearly 5% below the current market value. The author's own price target is $325, 19% above the current price, based on strong free cash flow and FCF margins.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 11:44 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The company's 1-year total shareholder return stands at 11.7%, reflecting durable long-term performance. However, investor debate persists over valuation: the most popular narrative labels Apple as 'overvalued,' estimating a fair value of $177.34, based on a P/E ratio exceeding 28x\u2014well above the broader market average of ~20x. This high multiple is seen as unsustainable given Apple's mature product lines and market saturation. A separate SWS DCF model estimates a fair value of $219.41, still below the current share price, suggesting even fundamental cash flow analysis reflects a premium valuation. Despite this, strong service growth or unexpected innovation could challenge the overvaluation thesis and reignite investor momentum.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

(AAPL) shares fell about 1.5% after the company unveiled the iPhone 17, as analysts questioned the model\u2019s breakthrough appeal. Two weeks later, media reports highlighted strong demand, noting that orders for the new devices exceed those of last year\u2019s iPhone 16 series, Apple has requested suppliers to increase production, and the base model with a 120Hz display and A19 chip is attracting high demand. Positive reports of long queues at Apple Stores worldwide and extended delivery times\u2014Bank of America estimates an average of 18 days versus 10 days for the previous model\u2014have bolstered bullish sentiment. AAPL shares are rising this week while broader market indices decline. Technical analysis shows the 2025 price action forming a broad ascending channel. Until early August, the price consolidated below the channel\u2019s median; since then, buyers have gained strength, creating a steep growth channel with the median acting as support. The price rose from $240 to $250, with broad bullish candlesticks, close-to-high closing prices, and a clear bullish gap, indicating a buyers\u2019 imbalance and a support zone per the Fair Value Gap pattern. From a bearish view, the RSI is overbought and some shareholders may realize profits, but the upward trend could continue if strong demand for the iPhone 17, Apple Watch Series 11, and AirPods Pro 3 with AI\u2011driven features drives record quarterly revenue, especially during the holiday season. Bulls may target the upper boundary of the blue channel as a price objective.

Weakness here could pressure near-term stock performance.  \n\n2. **Services as Margin Hedge**:  \n   - With 2.5B active devices, services growth (+14% projected) may offset hardware margin pressures from component inflation [4][5][9]. This diversification is viewed positively by analysts [6][7].  \n\n3. **Valuation Headwinds**:  \n   - Trading at 30-32x forward P/E, the stock is seen as \"appropriately priced\" with limited upside without new catalysts (e.g., AI breakthroughs or foldable iPhone) [4][7].  \n\n4. **Key Catalysts to Watch**:  \n   - **AI Integration**: Post-Google partnership progress could justify premium valuation if execution improves [7].  \n   - **Component Cost Controls**: Rising memory chip expenses threaten margins; resolution would boost sentiment [5][7].  \n\n### Analyst Consensus  \n- **Rating**: \"Moderate Buy\" (1 Strong Buy, 22 Buy, 11 Hold, 1 Sell) [6][7].  \n- **Price Target**: Average $289.23 (Citi at $269) [1][7].  \n- **Risks Highlighted**:  \n  - Supply chain instability (especially memory chips) [5][7]  \n  - AI strategy ambiguity after talent departures [6][7]  \n  - China geopolitical tensions [5][8]  \n\n### Outlook  \nAnalysts project **neutral-to-positive near-term stock performance** contingent on:  \n- Successful navigation of supply constraints for February/March iPhone demand.  \n- Services growth absorbing hardware margin pressures.  \n- Clearer AI roadmaps to sustain premium valuation.  \nFailure on these fronts may cap upside despite strong fundamentals.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
