Below is a consolidated status review, citing only material contained in the latest crawl.\n\n1. Earnings chronology (fully sourced)\n   \u2022 AlphaQuery lists the 20 most-recent earnings dates back to 28-Apr-2021, all after-close releases (AC).  The exact sequence is 29-Jan-2026, 30-Oct-2025, 31-Jul-2025, 01-May-2025, 30-Jan-2025, 31-Oct-2024, 01-Aug-2024, 02-May-2024, 01-Feb-2024, 02-Nov-2023, 03-Aug-2023, 04-May-2023, 02-Feb-2023, 27-Oct-2022, 28-Jul-2022, 28-Apr-2022, 27-Jan-2022, 28-Oct-2021, 27-Jul-2021 and 28-Apr-2021 (AlphaQuery earnings-history page\u2014cited in prior round and reconfirmed).\n\n2. One-day price reaction (partially populated)\n   Optionslam supplies close-to-close moves for the two most-recent prints: \u20131.2 % on 29-Jan-2026 and +2.05 % on 30-Oct-2025 (Optionslam earnings-move table).  IBKR Campus had \u20133.2 % for 03-Aug-2023 (earlier round).  The other 17 events still need to be calculated from daily closes.\n\n3. Ten-trading-day drift (missing)\n   None of the new hits contains a ready-made 10-day return series.  However, Stooq hosts a freely downloadable, split- and dividend-adjusted daily file for AAPL that spans decades and is directly accessible in CSV format (Stooq historical-data page).  With that single dataset, both the day-one and the 10-day returns can be computed in a few lines of pandas or in Excel:\n        Day-1 %  = (Close T+1 \u00f7 Close T\u20131) \u2013 1\n        Day-10 % = (Close T+10 \u00f7 Close T\u20131) \u2013 1\n   Once the 20 Day-10 observations are generated, mean, median, standard deviation, win-loss count and a six-bucket histogram (<\u201310 %, \u201310 % to \u20135 %, \u20135 % to 0 %, 0\u20135 %, 5\u201310 %, >10 %) can be produced in minutes.\n\n4. February seasonality (complete)\n   \u2022 Tradewell\u2019s 43-year calendar study shows Apple\u2019s average February return at +1.74 % with a 57 % win rate (Tradewell.app\u2014captured previously).  \n   \u2022 EquityClock notes that AAPL strength typically fades after 15 Feb each year (EquityClock technology calendar\u2014earlier crawl).  \n   Together these meet the \u201cnote any February seasonality\u201d requirement.\n\n5. Major scheduled catalysts before 15-Feb-2026 (complete)\n   Company-specific\n   \u2022 09-Feb-2026 ex-dividend date, $0.26/sh; payable 12-Feb-2026 (Apple press release 29-Jan-2026\u2014prior round).  \n   \u2022 Form 10-Q for FQ1-26 is historically filed within 12 calendar days of the call, implying on or before 12-Feb-2026.  \n   \u2022 Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman expects a MacBook Pro press-release launch \u201cFebruary through March,\u201d with rumour sites pegging early February (MacRumors 01-Feb-2026\u2014earlier round).  \n   Macro/industry\n   \u2022 No FOMC meeting, CPI release, non-farm payrolls, CES or Mobile World Congress falls inside the 02-Feb- to 15-Feb-2026 window (standard economic/event calendars reviewed earlier).\n\n6. Information gaps still open\n   a) Close-to-close Day-1 % change for 17 of the 20 earnings events.  \n   b) The full 20-observation 10-trading-day return series along with the requested descriptive stats and histogram.\n\n7. Data already available to close the gaps\n   \u2022 Daily adjusted closes: downloadable free of charge from Stooq (AAPL.US Historical data page\u2014Stooq).  \n   \u2022 Earnings dates (timestamps) to align the calculation: AlphaQuery.\n\n8. Next action required\n   Download the Stooq CSV, perform the two straightforward calculations above, and compile the summary statistics.  No additional third-party source is necessary; the raw data and the methodology are in hand.\n\nIn short, the qualitative components\u2014earnings calendar, February bias, and pre-15-Feb-2026 catalysts\u2014are fully documented.  What remains is purely mechanical number-crunching from publicly available price data to generate the 10-day post-earnings return matrix and its distribution.  Until that numeric table is produced, the deliverable is not fully compliant with the original query.</Agent_report>\n"
