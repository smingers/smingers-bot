9. **Focus Bulletin/Brazil Central Bank (February 2, 2026)**: Projects exchange rate at R$5.50 per USD for 2026. Regional data, limited relevance to broad index.

10. **Deep Research Analysis**: Synthesizes analyst views showing consensus of "near-term upside pressure" from Warsh appointment but "volatility around CPI release." **Expert consensus from multiple institutions.**

**Key Factual Baseline Established:**
- Trading Economics: DTWEXBGS = 119.28550 in January 2026
- Statista: Broad USD Index dropped from 129 (Jan 2025) to 120 (Jan 2026)
- Current date: February 2, 2026
- Forecast date: February 10, 2026 (8 days ahead)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Recent level confirmation**: Multiple independent sources (Trading Economics, Statista) confirm DTWEXBGS around 119-120 in January 2026. This establishes a solid baseline for near-term forecasting.
2. **Structural USD weakness in 2025**: MUFG documents 9.4% USD depreciation in 2025, with Fed cutting 75bps and terminating QT. This represents a clear regime shift from USD strength.
3. **Expert consensus on continued weakness**: Both MUFG and Goldman Sachs (major institutions) project continued USD decline in 2026, though more modest than 2025.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Warsh nomination effect**: Multiple sources report this as USD-supportive, with DXY rebounding from ~95.5 to ~97.2. However, this is measured on DXY (6-currency basket) not DTWEXBGS (broad basket). The direction should be similar but magnitude uncertain.
2. **Short-term technical rebound**: Marketpulse and AskNews articles note USD bouncing from oversold levels, suggesting near-term stabilization or modest strength.
3. **Fed policy uncertainty**: Markets pricing only 2 rate cuts in 2026 vs previous expectations of more aggressive easing. This moderately supports USD.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **CPI release speculation**: Various sources mention upcoming CPI data as critical, but this is speculative about future data releases.
2. **Geopolitical factors**: Mentioned as potential USD support but highly uncertain and event-driven.

**Critical Gap**: No sources provide actual DTWEXBGS values between January 23, 2026 (when it was 119.2855 per question metadata) and today (February 2, 2026). The 8-day forecast requires interpolation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast Horizon**: 8 days (February 2 → February 10, 2026)

**If halved to 4 days**: Prediction range would narrow significantly. Daily volatility of ~0.3-0.4 points suggests 4-day standard deviation of ~0.6-0.8 points. The 10-90 range would compress to roughly 1.5 points instead of 2.5-3 points. Central tendency would shift closer to current interpolated level.

**If doubled to 16 days**: Prediction range would widen moderately. 16-day standard deviation of ~1.4-1.6 points would expand the 10-90 range to roughly 3.5-4 points. Greater weight would be placed on the medium-term trend (MUFG's projected 5% annual decline = ~0.5 points/month or ~0.25 points/2 weeks).

**Current 8-day horizon considerations**:
- Too short for structural factors (Fed policy changes, geopolitical shifts) to fully manifest
- Long enough for data releases (if any) to cause 0.5-1 point moves
- Dominated by continuation of recent trend + noise + Warsh nomination effect

## (d) Justification

**Baseline Anchoring**:
From question metadata, DTWEXBGS = 119.2855 on January 23, 2026 (10 days before today). Trading Economics reports 119.28550 for "January 2026" (likely end-of-month or average). This suggests the index has been relatively stable around 119.3 throughout late January.

**Trend Assessment**:
- 2025: USD declined 9.4% (DXY basis), translating to DTWEXBGS dropping from ~130 (Jan 2025) to ~120 (Jan 2026)
- This represents a clear downward trend that dominated 2025
- However, recent sources (late Jan/early Feb 2026) report USD stabilization and modest rebound following Warsh nomination
- MUFG projects continued but slower decline in 2026 (~5% vs 2025's 9.4%)

**Near-term Factors (Next 8 Days)**:
1. **Warsh nomination effect**: Moderate USD support, but much of this may already be priced in by Feb 2. DXY rebounded ~1.5 points, suggesting DTWEXBGS might see similar magnitude (+1-1.5 points from recent lows).
2. **Technical stabilization**: After falling from 130 to ~119, the index appears to be finding support. Absent major shocks, sideways-to-slightly-higher movement is plausible.
3. **No major scheduled events**: The 8-day window (Feb 2-10) likely contains no FOMC meetings or major policy announcements that would cause large moves.

**Probabilistic Reasoning**:
- **Most likely scenario (60% probability)**: Index remains in 119-121 range, with modest upward bias from Warsh effect and technical stabilization. Central tendency around 119.8-120.2.
- **Upside scenario (20% probability)**: Stronger USD rebound if positive economic data or additional hawkish Fed signals emerge. Could reach 121-122.
- **Downside scenario (20% probability)**: Resumption of 2025 downtrend if negative data or geopolitical shocks occur. Could fall to 118-119.

**Distribution Shift from Outside View**:
My outside view (based purely on 8-day volatility) centered at 120.2 with 10-90 range of 118.7-121.7. Current evidence suggests:
- **Slight downward shift in central tendency**: Given the index was at 119.2855 on Jan 23 and sources suggest stability around 119.3 in late January, current level is likely 119.3-119.5 rather than 120.0+.
- **Modest upward bias**: Warsh nomination and technical stabilization suggest slight positive drift over next 8 days (+0.3-0.5 points).
- **Maintain similar volatility range**: No evidence suggests abnormal volatility ahead.

**Revised central estimate**: 119.7 (current ~119.4 + modest upward drift of ~0.3)

Probability calibration:

**Central Tendency Calibration**:
- Current level (Feb 2): ~119.4 (interpolating from Jan 23 value of 119.2855 and stability reports)
- Expected 8-day change: +0.3 points (modest positive drift from Warsh effect and technical stabilization)
- Median prediction: 119.7

**Volatility Calibration**:
- Daily volatility: ~0.35 points (based on typical FX index behavior)
- 8-day standard deviation: 0.35 × √8 ≈ 1.0 point
- 10-90 percentile range: Median ± 1.28σ = 119.7 ± 1.3 = 118.4 to 121.0

**Tail Adjustments**:
- **Lower tail (1st-5th percentile)**: Account for potential shock events (unexpected negative data, geopolitical crisis). Could push index down to 117-118 range.
- **Upper tail (95th-99th percentile)**: Account for stronger-than-expected USD rally (aggressive hawkish Fed signals, risk-off event). Could push index up to 122-123 range.

**Distribution Shape**:
- Slightly positive skew reflecting modest upward bias from recent stabilization
- Moderate kurtosis to account for event risk (fatter tails than pure normal distribution)

**Percentile Construction**:
- 1st: 117.5 (extreme downside shock)
- 5th: 118.2 (significant negative move)
- 10th: 118.6 (modest downside)
- 20th: 119.1 (below-median outcome)
- 40th: 119.5 (slightly below median)
- 60th: 119.9 (slightly above median)
- 80th: 120.5 (above-median outcome)
- 90th: 121.2 (modest upside)
- 95th: 121.8 (significant positive move)
- 99th: 122.8 (extreme upside scenario)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: DTWEXBGS value on Feb 10, 2026 (8 days ahead), units: Index Jan 2006=100 ✓

2. **Outside view anchor**: Started at 120.2 based on trend extrapolation; adjusted to 119.7 after incorporating Jan 23 baseline of 119.2855 and evidence of recent stability ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 119.7; mean ≈ 119.8 (slightly higher due to positive skew). Aligns with current level ~119.4 plus modest 8-day upward drift. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - DTWEXBGS = 119.2855 on Jan 23 (factual baseline)
   - Trading Economics reports 119.28550 for January 2026 (confirms stability)
   - Warsh nomination creating modest USD support (expert consensus)
   - MUFG/Goldman Sachs project continued but slower USD decline in 2026 (structural view)
   - 8-day horizon limits extreme moves absent major shocks ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected major data release (e.g., surprisingly weak employment report) or geopolitical shock in next 8 days could push index down 1-2 points to ~118 range. This is my primary downside risk not fully captured in the distribution.
