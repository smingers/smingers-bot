Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Sources:**
1. **Trading Economics (Jan 2026)**: Reports DTWEXBGS at 119.28550 in January 2026, with historical high of 130.21420 (Jan 2025). Pure data source, high quality, current.

2. **FRED metadata**: Technical documentation only, no forecasts or current values. Authoritative but not actionable.

3. **Fed H.10 Summary**: Administrative notice about currency weight updates (last revised March 24, 2025). No opinions, high quality institutional source.

4. **MUFG Research (Jan 2026)**: **Expert forecast from named analysts** (Derek Halpenny, Lee Hardman). Projects USD decline of ~5% in 2026 (DXY -4.9%). Key facts: USD fell 9.4% in 2025, Fed REER at 115 vs long-term avg of 101. Expects 3-4 Fed cuts in 2026. High quality, current, explicit methodology.

5. **Goldman Sachs AM (Jan 5, 2026)**: **Expert institutional view**. Expects "modest" USD decline amid monetary easing and healthy global growth. Constructive on risk assets. High quality, though less specific on magnitude.

6. **Marketpulse (Elior Manier)**: Technical analysis noting DXY corrected ~10% from 110 highs to 98.00. Identifies 98.50-98.80 pivot area. Mixed view: bullish technical setup but bearish risks from Fed independence concerns. Moderate quality (single analyst).

**AskNews Articles:**
7. **Statista (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports Nominal Broad Index dropped from 129 to 120 (Jan 2025 to Jan 2026), ~7% decline. Attributes to policy uncertainty, rising federal debt. Current, factual.

8. **Multiple sources (Jan 30-Feb 2, 2026)**: Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair. **Key expert opinion (Richard Clarida, former Fed vice chair)**: Warsh could implement 2-3 rate cuts in 2026, more cautious approach. Dollar index rose to 96.93-97.21 after announcement, recovering from 4-year lows. Market pricing: 2 cuts expected in 2026, first possibly June.

9. **Focus Bulletin (Feb 2, 2026)**: Brazilian market consensus maintains USD/BRL at 5.50 for 2026. Tangential but shows stable EM expectations.

10. **Nick Giambruno analysis**: Opinion piece arguing dollar weakness masked by nominal gains. S&P 500 down 47% in gold terms since 2021. Speculative, no specific DTWEXBGS forecast.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current level anchoring**: DTWEXBGS = 119.28550 as of January 2026 (Trading Economics). This is our most reliable starting point.
- **Recent trajectory**: 7-9% decline through 2025 from ~130 peak (multiple sources confirm). Statista reports 129→120 for Nominal Broad Index.
- **Institutional consensus**: MUFG (-5% DXY for 2026), Goldman Sachs (modest decline), multiple analysts expect continued but slower weakening than 2025.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Fed policy shift**: Warsh nomination suggests 2-3 cuts vs market pricing of 2 cuts. Less dovish than Powell but still easing bias. Former Fed vice chair Clarida's view carries weight.
- **Technical levels**: DXY recovery from 95.5 to 97.2 after Warsh news shows near-term support, but longer-term trend remains down.
- **Valuation metrics**: Fed REER at 115 vs 101 long-term average suggests overvaluation, supporting gradual decline thesis (MUFG).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Geopolitical wildcards**: US-Iran tensions, EU defense spending mentioned but unclear directional impact over 8-day horizon.
- **Gold surge narrative**: Interesting structural argument but not directly predictive for 8-day forecast.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 8 calendar days (6 trading days) from Feb 2 to Feb 10, 2026.

**Key events in window**:
- Feb 5: ISM Services
- Feb 7: January payrolls

**No major catalysts**: No Fed meeting, CPI release, or ECB decision. Payrolls historically move DTWEXBGS by <1% in a day.

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Would tighten distribution significantly, σ reduced by ~30%, median stays near current level (119.3).

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would widen distribution, σ increases by ~40%, and structural bearish factors (Fed cuts, valuation) would have more time to manifest, potentially shifting median down 0.3-0.5 points.

## (d) Justification and Distribution Shift

**Base rate anchor**: 119.2855 (last observation, Jan 23, 2026)

**Directional factors**:

*Bearish (downward pressure)*:
1. Structural overvaluation: REER 14% above average
2. Consensus for 2-3 Fed cuts in 2026
3. 2025's -9% trend showing momentum
4. Technical: DXY still below 100, recent bounce may be temporary

*Bullish (upward pressure)*:
1. Warsh nomination less dovish than expected
2. Technical recovery from 4-year lows suggests near-term stabilization
3. Payrolls data could surprise positively

**Net assessment**: The 8-day horizon is too short for structural bearish factors to dominate. The recent Warsh-driven bounce (95.5→97.2 on DXY) suggests near-term consolidation rather than immediate resumption of decline. However, I do not expect a return to 130 levels.

**Adjustment from outside view**: The outside view assumed mean=119.35, σ=0.80. Recent news suggests:
- Slightly higher probability of stability/modest uptick due to Warsh effect
- But no evidence of major bullish catalyst to push above 120.5
- Downside still present but muted over 8 days

**Revised parameters**: Mean=119.40 (slight upward nudge from Warsh stabilization), σ=0.75 (slightly tighter than outside view due to lack of major catalysts, but wider than pure random walk to account for payrolls risk).

## Probability Calibration

Using Normal(119.40, 0.75):

- **Median (50th)**: 119.40
- **10th percentile**: 119.40 - 1.28×0.75 = 118.44
- **90th percentile**: 119.40 + 1.28×0.75 = 120.36

This implies:
- 80% confidence interval: [118.44, 120.36] (span of 1.92 points, ~1.6%)
- Very low probability of returning to 130 peak
- Very low probability of breaking below 118

**Tail adjustments**: 
- 1st percentile: Allow for extreme payrolls shock → 117.50
- 99th percentile: Allow for unexpected hawkish surprise → 121.30

The distribution remains anchored near current levels with modest uncertainty, reflecting the short horizon and absence of major scheduled catalysts.

Checklist:
1. **Target**: DTWEXBGS value on Feb 10, 2026 (8 days out, Index Jan 2006=100)
2. **Base rate**: 119.29 from Jan 23; outside view suggested 119.35±0.80
3. **Consistency**: Implied median=119.40, mean=119.40; aligns with near-term stabilization post-Warsh, modest structural bearish pressure
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Current level 119.29, (2) Warsh nomination→2-3 cuts not immediate collapse, (3) MUFG/GS consensus for gradual 2026 decline, (4) No major catalysts in 8-day window, (5) Technical bounce from 4-year low suggests consolidation
5. **Blind spot**: Surprise hawkish payrolls + hot wage data could trigger risk-off USD rally, pushing outcome to 120.5+ (would make forecast look too conservative on upside)
