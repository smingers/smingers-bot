Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (abridged)
1. Trading Economics DTWEXBGS page – factual Jan-2026 level 119.2855; high-quality primary data, updated weekly.  
2. FRED metadata – definition of the series; authoritative, no forward-looking content.  
3. Fed H.10 background note – explains annual re-weighting; reliable, structural, historical only.  
4. MUFG Jan-2026 FX outlook – named strategists; monthly horizon, expects 5 % USD drift lower in 2026; medium quality, some analytical bias.  
5. GSAM 1Q-2026 “Market Know-How” – institutional outlook, mild 2026 USD decline; credible but strategic (long-term).  
6. Marketpulse 31 Jan 2026 note – single analyst, near-term DXY bounce; short horizon, fair quality but DXY not DTWEXBGS.  
7. Asknews news-wire set (Feb 1–2 2026) – real-time reports of DXY moving from 95.5 to 97.2 on Fed-chair nomination; factual data, well-sourced; strongest near-term signal.  

(b) Evidence weighing
Strong:  
• Latest observed DTWEXBGS level 119.29 on 23 Jan 2026 (primary data).  
• DXY has risen roughly 1.7 % between 26 Jan and 2 Feb on Warsh nomination – confirmed by 4 independent outlets; Broad index historically moves in same direction albeit with ~60 % of DXY amplitude.  
Moderate:  
• MUFG & GSAM both forecast a modest USD decline through 2026 (-4 % to -5 %) – suggests downward drift later in year, but horizon > 6 months.  
• Fed leadership uncertainty keeps implied vol elevated – logical but indirect.  
Weak:  
• Trump rhetoric on “yo-yo” dollar, gold crash commentary, EM flows – anecdotal or long-term and therefore marginal for an 8-day window.  

(c) Timeframe analysis
Horizon to resolution: 8 calendar days ≈ 6 trading days.  One-week standard deviation for DTWEXBGS (2019-25) ≈ 0.8 index points; moves > 2 points in a week occurred < 10 % of the time and usually around Fed/CPI shocks.  If horizon were halved, st.dev ≈ 0.55 → distribution 30 % tighter; if doubled, ≈ 1.1 → 35 % wider, centre unchanged barring new macro shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view baseline: use last published value 119.3 with random-walk volatility (σ ≈ 0.8).  
Adjustment 1 (strong evidence): DXY’s 1.7 % rebound implies roughly +1.0 index-point translation for DTWEXBGS (historical β ≈ 0.6). Moves observed after 23 Jan push anchor to ~120.3.  
Adjustment 2 (moderate evidence): CPI release due 13 Feb, not before 10 Feb; Fed blackout period continues, limiting policy shocks; therefore skew from macro surprises is limited.  
Adjustment 3 (tail risk): geopolitics or surprise Fed testimony could swing USD ±2 pts; reflected in fat-tail percentiles.  

Inside-view median = 120.8 (adds 1.5 pts to 23 Jan level).  One-week σ assumed 0.8; convert to percentiles and widen tails by 30 % to account for fat-tails/unknowns.

Probability calibration
Implied distribution is quasi-normal with over-dispersion:  
10/90 band ≈ 118.2–123.2 (width 5.0) versus naïve normal 119.3 ± 1.3 (width 2.6), preventing over-confidence.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: DTWEXBGS daily close, 2026-02-10, Jan 2006 = 100.  
2. Base rate: 119.3, σ 0.8 per week.  
3. Consistency: median 120.8; mean ~120.8; justified by recent DXY bounce.  
4. Key evidence: a) 119.3 latest print, b) DXY +1.7 % last week, c) No major data before 10 Feb, d) One-week historical volatility 0.8.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden de-escalation of US-Iran tensions causing sharp risk-on and USD sell-off (would push value toward 117).
