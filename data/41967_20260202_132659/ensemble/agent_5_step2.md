Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, most weight first):
   • FRED DTWEXBGS raw file, last published value 2026-01-31 = 119.66.  Primary, factual, daily, no opinion → high quality.  
   • TradingEconomics snapshot (updated Feb-2026) shows Jan-2026 monthly average 119.29.  Factual, close in time, high quality.  
   • Recent FX-news flow (Al Jazeera, interest.co.nz, Statista, Marketpulse) all quote the ICE DXY or generic “dollar index”, not the Fed’s broad index.  Useful only directionally; quality medium.  
   • MUFG and Goldman Sachs 2026 outlooks (Jan-2026) are named-analyst research.  They foresee a modest 3-5 % dollar decline during 2026.  Long-horizon opinion → weak‐to-moderate evidence for the next week.  
   • Other Asknews items (Focus bulletin, rupee story, Argentina peso, gold crash, etc.) are tangential or anecdotal → weak evidence.

   Factual level vs. opinion: only the first two bullets provide hard numbers on DTWEXBGS.  All other articles are opinions; only the MUFG and GS pieces come from identifiable experts.

2. Evidence analysis  
   Strong:  
     – DTWEXBGS historical volatility (2010-25) shows σ_daily ≈ 0.25 index-points; 6-day σ ≈ 0.61.  
     – Six-day moves > ±1.5 occurred only 3 % of the time; covid-peak weekly swing was +2.3.  
   Moderate:  
     – Warsh nomination seen as mildly hawkish, pushing the dollar up 0.8 % in three sessions (DXY basis).  
     – Dollar’s gentle up-drift since mid-January (+0.4 index-point) appears persistent.  
   Weak:  
     – Sell-side 2026 forecasts call for a softer dollar later this year, but horizon mismatch (many months).  
     – Geopolitical headlines (Trump remarks, gold crash) are noisy and not specific to the coming week.

   Net directional pull: small upside bias relative to the latest print, but large deviation is unlikely.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   Forecast horizon = 8 calendar / 6 business days.  If the horizon were halved (3 days) I would cut σ by √(3/6) ≈ 0.71.  If doubled (12 business days) I would raise σ by √(12/6) ≈ 1.41 and slide the mean 0.1 higher for carry-over drift.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
   Outside-view mean = 119.70 (latest reading).  
   Inside factors:  
     • Warsh effect & firmer US data → +0.15.  
     • Event risk (Fed confirmation, payrolls 7 Feb) → widen tails by 15 %.  
   Resulting mean = 119.85, σ_effective = 0.70.

Probability calibration
Distribution generated from N(119.85, 0.70) then fat-tailed 0.3 both sides to guard against 3 σ shocks.

Checklist:
1. Variable: Fed DTWEXBGS daily value on 2026-02-10, index Jan-2006 = 100.  
2. Base rate: unchanged drift, μ = latest print 119.70, σ_6day = 0.61.  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈ 119.9, mean ≈ 119.9 – matches argument of slight upward bias.  
4. Key evidence: a) last official value 119.66; b) historical 6-day σ ≈ 0.6; c) mild hawkish surprise (Warsh); d) no major scheduled data before 10 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected geopolitical shock (e.g., Iran escalation) causing a >2-point safe-haven spike upward.
