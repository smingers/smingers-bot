Analysis:
The Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index (series DTWEXBGS) is driven mainly by relative monetary-policy expectations, interest-rate differentials, global risk appetite, and commodity/energy price trends that influence trade flows.  Since mid-2025 the dollar has strengthened again as U.S. growth has out-performed Europe and China, while the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut path has been repeatedly pushed back because core inflation remains sticky around 2¾ – 3 %.  In January 2026 the index rebounded to 119.3 after dipping below 117 in December.  For the 2026-02-10 fix, the key data points still ahead are: January CPI (to be released 2026-02-07), the February 2026 FOMC minutes drip, and ongoing signals from the ECB and BoJ about further easing.  A hotter-than-expected CPI would keep U.S. yields elevated and likely push the broad dollar higher, whereas a soft print could trigger some profit-taking.  Current 2-year Treasury yields near 4.65 % versus German Schatz at 2.65 % suggest the spread is still wide enough to cap meaningful dollar weakness unless we see a large risk-on rally.  Therefore the most relevant articles will be those that discuss: 
• Fed rate-cut timing after the January 31 FOMC,
• Market reaction to January 2026 CPI expectations,
• Eurozone and Japanese policy guidance,
• Any geopolitical or energy-price shocks that could move safe-haven flows.
