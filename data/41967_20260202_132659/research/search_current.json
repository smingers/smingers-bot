This marks a decline from the 4.06% projection four weeks prior. The market maintained stable expectations for the PIB (Gross Domestic Product), Selic interest rate, and exchange rate compared to the previous month. The projected Selic rate for 2026 remains at 12.25%, with a forecast of 10.50% for 2027. In January 2026, the Copom (Monetary Policy Committee) kept the rate at 15% per year. The exchange rate projection for 2026 stayed at R$ 5.50 per U.S. dollar, with a slight reduction to R$ 5.50 for 2027, followed by a projected increase to R$ 5.57 in 2028 and 2029. Economic growth expectations remained unchanged, with a projected PIB increase of 1.80% in both 2026 and 2027. The Focus Bulletin is published weekly by the Central Bank based on projections from over 100 financial market institutions, summarizing expectations for inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, and economic growth.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:04 PM\nSource:[Poder360](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-economia/projecao-para-inflacao-em-2026-e-de-399-diz-focus/)\n\n**Infographic: Value of U.S. Dollar Falls Sharply**\nThe U.S. dollar has depreciated by approximately 7 percent over the past twelve months, according to the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which dropped from 129 to 120 between January 2025 and January 2026. The euro strengthened by over 8 percent during the same period, with the exchange rate falling to 0.83 Euros per 1 USD as of January 28, 2026\u2014down from 0.96 in early 2025. Analysts attribute the decline to uncertainty over U.S. economic policy, rising federal debt, and shifting global investor sentiment, particularly following Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House in late 2024, which raised concerns about tariffs, inflation, and fiscal direction. The depreciation has reduced U.S. consumers\u2019 purchasing power and increased borrowing costs. Internationally, central banks in China and Europe have accelerated efforts to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the dollar, signaling a potential long-term shift in global financial architecture.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:25 AM\nSource:[Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/35764/value-of-us-dollar-relative-to-other-major-currencies)\n\n**Rupee Likely To Trade Around 92.50/Dollar By March-End: BS Poll**\nA poll conducted by BS indicates that the Indian rupee is likely to trade around 92.50 per dollar by the end of March 2026. However, a majority of respondents expect the rupee to appreciate further, reaching 90 per dollar by the end of June 2026. Aditya Vyas, chief economist at STCI Primary Dealer Limited, attributed much of the rupee's recent depreciation to capital outflows and negative market sentiment. He noted that while further depreciation is possible, it would occur at a slower pace, with the potential for a reversal in value during the year, based on indicators such as the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:40 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://m.rediff.com/news/commentary/2026/feb/02/rupee-likely-to-trade-around-92.50dollar-by-marchend-bs-poll/0b95ee28003a121f961bc04ae45e3723)\n\n**Dollar Stabilizes Amid Anticipation of Federal Reserve Policy Under Kevin Warsh**\nThe U.S. dollar stabilized in Asian trading on Monday, recovering from earlier losses amid ongoing market anticipation of the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy direction under incoming Chair Kevin Warsh. Despite a broad market downturn affecting gold, silver, and equities, major currencies showed relative isolation from wider volatility. The Japanese yen regained attention after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's remarks suggesting benefits of a weaker yen, conflicting with the Ministry of Finance's efforts to halt its decline, further pressuring the yen amid a strong dollar. Donald Trump's appointment of Kevin Warsh as the new Federal Reserve Chair triggered a sell-off in high-risk assets on Friday, coinciding with sharp declines in precious metals, but the dollar regained strength. The U.S. Dollar Index reached 97.21, up about 1% from the previous week\u2019s close. Richard Clarida, former Fed vice chair and global economic advisor at Bimco, stated Warsh could implement two rate cuts in 2026, possibly a third, though he may adopt a more cautious approach later depending on inflation trends. Market pricing indicates two expected rate cuts in 2026, with the first possibly delayed until June if Warsh receives Senate confirmation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:08 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2026/2/2/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d9%88%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d9%8a%d8%b3%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%b1-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%82%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%81%d8%af%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%8a-%d9%81%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%af%d8%a9)\n\n**Will Asia's investment homecoming last?**\nAsian equities have outperformed the US in 2025 and continued gains into 2026, with the MSCI All Country Asia ex-Japan Index up nearly 6% year-to-date in US dollar terms, significantly outpacing the range-bound S&P 500. This rebound marks a reversal from a decade of US exceptionalism and declining Asia exposure due to trade tensions, regulatory shifts in China, and persistent US market dominance. The recovery is attributed to coordinated policy easing by the Federal Reserve and China, sustained momentum in artificial intelligence (AI), and corporate reforms. Structural drivers include technology localization, deepening intra-regional trade, and governance improvements, supporting a long-term investment case for Asia. Chinese tech earnings are projected to grow 40% in 2026 and 20% in 2027, with reasonable valuations and strong liquidity. Investors are advised to maintain exposure to Asian investment-grade bonds (4.5-year duration) and emerging market sovereign bonds offering 7%\u20138% expected returns. Currencies are also favorable: core Asian currencies are expected to appreciate 2% on average against the US dollar, with the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar potentially rising 5%\u20137%, while the Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar, and Malaysian ringgit may rise 2%\u20133%. The Australian dollar is the top pick due to strong jobs, growth, and expected Reserve Bank of Australia rate hikes in early 2026. Japanese government bonds (JGBs) experienced a sharp long-end sell-off following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s election pitches, but this is not a 'Liz Truss moment'\u2014Japan remains a net creditor nation with a current account surplus near 4% of GDP and effective interest rates (0.6%\u20130.7%) well below the 2.5% nominal GDP growth rate, limiting immediate fiscal risk. Yields are expected to remain elevated before easing post-February 8 election, with 10-year JGB yield at 2% and US Treasuries at 3.75% by mid-2026. The yen may remain volatile until fiscal confidence returns. Japanese equities remain favored due to reflation and corporate reform. Geopolitical risks persist, with the 'Donroe Doctrine' and NATO strains signaling ongoing uncertainty. In Asia-Pacific investor surveys, 43% cited a 'Trump surprise' and 28% a 'geopolitical flare-up' as top risks. However, historical patterns suggest geopolitical shocks have short-lived market impacts, with eventual de-escalation. Strategic autonomy in supply chains, energy, and defense is becoming critical, benefiting chip localization leaders, nuclear energy in Japan, and European defense firms. Despite risks, the outlook for 2026 remains positive, with a core equity rally broadening and portfolios favoring diversification. The S&P 500 target remains at 7,700, supported by pro-growth policies and AI-led gains across financials, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. Eurozone earnings are expected to grow 7% in 2026 and 18% in 2027 due to industrial reshoring, electrification, and defense spending. A 5% allocation to gold is recommended, with a potential upside to $7,200 per ounce, favored for its stability and central bank demand. Copper and aluminum remain attractive due to structural undersupply.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/will-asias-investment-homecoming-last)\n\n**Trump's 'I Can Raise or Lower the Dollar Like a Yo-Yo' Statement Reveals Arrogant Ambition to Recreate the Plaza Accord**\nOn January 27, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the U.S. dollar index reaching its lowest level in about four years, stating, 'I just want the dollar to be at its own level. That\u2019s a fair way.' He suggested he could raise or lower the dollar 'like a yo-yo,' but claimed the current state was 'excellent,' praising the dollar\u2019s performance and the health of U.S. business. Trump criticized China and Japan, alleging they had consistently devalued the yen and yuan to gain unfair trade advantages, saying such actions made competition difficult for the U.S. Following his remarks, the ICE Dollar Index dropped sharply from 97 to 95.5, down from nearly 110 a year earlier. A lower index indicates dollar weakness, while the yen strengthened from 154.75 to 152.22 per dollar.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[JBpress\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\uff09](https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/93054)\n\n**USD in small recovery from 4 year low**\nThe US dollar rebounded from a four-year low, gaining broad-based strength against G10 currencies, with the dollar index rising nearly 0.5% on Friday despite ending the month lower. This recovery followed President Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair, succeeding Jay Powell in May, subject to Senate approval. Warsh is perceived as less inclined toward aggressive rate cuts and more focused on inflation, which influenced market reactions. Equity markets closed lower, the US Treasury curve steepened\u2014front-end yields dipped while longer-term yields rose slightly\u2014and gold prices fell below $4,800 per ounce, a drop of nearly 15% from the prior session\u2019s high. Money markets priced in a 25 basis point rate cut by July and 53 basis points of easing by year-end. The US Treasury\u2019s semi-annual foreign exchange report labeled the Chinese yuan as 'substantially undervalued' due to persistent large external surpluses and urged China to allow orderly appreciation, though no country was designated as a currency manipulator; Thailand was added to the monitoring list. In the Eurozone, GDP expanded 0.3% in Q4 2025, matching prior growth and outperforming expectations amid geopolitical uncertainty; the ECB is expected to hold rates at 2.0% with markets pricing steady policy through 2026. China\u2019s January PMIs fell into contraction territory, signaling weak economic momentum, while Japan\u2019s CPI, excluding fresh food, rose 2% year-on-year, prompting Bank of Japan Governor Ueda to signal close monitoring of inflation, with market pricing suggesting around 25bp of tightening by June and 50bp by year-end. New Zealand\u2019s fixed income markets ended quiet, with swap curves unchanged and government bond yields slightly lower. No major domestic data were released, but China\u2019s RatingDog manufacturing PMI and the US ISM manufacturing index were expected, with economists forecasting a slight rebound after December\u2019s 47.9 reading.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:42 PM\nSource:[interest.co.nz](https://www.interest.co.nz/currencies/137022/markets-digest-kevin-warsh%E2%80%99s-nomination-fed-chair-us-dollar-advances-treasury)\n\n**Causes and Future Outlook of the Gold Market Crash: The Logic Behind the Market Turmoil**\nIn January 2026, the international gold market experienced an unprecedented shock, with spot gold prices plummeting from above $5,000 per ounce to around $4,200 within a single month\u2014a decline exceeding 16%, the largest single-month drop since the 1980 oil crisis. This sharp fall challenged the traditional perception of gold as a safe-haven asset and triggered deep market reflection on its future trajectory. In 2025, gold prices surged dramatically, rising from $3,000 per ounce at the start of the year to surpass $5,000, with a total annual gain exceeding 70%. This rally was driven by a dual force: escalating geopolitical risks\u2014including U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and the Greenland sovereignty dispute\u2014and a global central bank gold buying spree, with central banks purchasing a record 1,500 tons of gold in 2025. However, in January 2026, a 'black swan' event occurred: a temporary ceasefire agreement was reached between the U.S. and major counterparties, and the Greenland sovereignty dispute was shelved, causing a sudden drop in safe-haven demand. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate hikes, pushing the U.S. dollar index from 102 to 108 within the month. The stronger dollar reduced the appeal of non-dollar-denominated gold, while the accumulated profit-taking at $5,000 triggered a cascade of sell-offs. Gold and the U.S. dollar index exhibit a strong negative correlation: rising U.S. interest rates increased the opportunity cost of holding gold, diverted capital to dollar assets, and raised the cost of gold for non-U.S. investors, dampening global demand. If nominal interest rates rise faster than inflation, real interest rates turn positive, weakening gold\u2019s traditional role as an inflation hedge.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:11 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260201/49214921.html)\n\n**Nick Giambruno: The Melt-Up Trap \u2013 Why Stocks Must Rise Until the Dollar Collapses**\nAccording to Nick Giambruno, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index is a key indicator of how average Americans perceive the economy, reflecting household financial conditions, job prospects, inflation, and future expectations. As of January 2026, the index is near a record low\u2014lower than during the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com crash, and the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s. Despite this widespread pessimism, stock market indices like the S&P 500 are trading near nominal all-time highs. Giambruno attributes this disconnect to the 'financial carousel' driven by relentless fiat money creation, which distorts market signals. He argues that measuring the stock market in gold\u2014rather than fiat currency\u2014reveals a different truth: the S&P 500 is worth only about 43 grams of gold today, down from 164 grams in 1999 and 82 grams in late 2021. This represents a decline of over 73% from its peak in gold terms and a 47% drop since 2021. Giambruno contends that the nominal rise in stock prices reflects currency devaluation, not real wealth creation. He warns that the illusion of prosperity will intensify, with stock prices rising further while real purchasing power erodes.

The currency rebounded from a sharp sell-off earlier in the week. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and euro, climbed 0.79% to 96.93. The euro fell 0.79% to $1.1874, while the Japanese yen declined 0.89% to \u00a5154.49 per dollar. The dollar\u2019s gains were fueled by stronger-than-expected U.S. producer price data for December, suggesting that companies have passed on higher import-related costs\u2014due to tariffs\u2014to consumers. Despite the recent drop, the dollar is on track for a 0.8% weekly loss against the yen, which had surged earlier in the week after Japanese policymakers hinted at potential foreign exchange market intervention to support the weakening currency, which had fallen to its lowest level in nearly 18 months.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 10:50 PM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/arabic/story/2128655.html)\n\n**Dollar Index Rises 0.73% on January 30**\nThe U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six major currencies, rose 0.73% on January 30, 2026, closing at 96.989 by the end of the New York foreign exchange session.

Former President Donald Trump's comment that the dollar's value is 'great' during a 10% decline in 2025 signaled to markets a tolerance for a weaker currency, triggering an immediate 1% drop in the dollar's value. The Federal Reserve\u2019s expected monetary easing has reduced the dollar\u2019s appeal to yield-seeking investors. Simultaneously, gold has surged approximately threefold since 2020, while long-term US Treasury bonds have collapsed, leading financial commentator Lukas Ekwueme to note that gold has effectively replaced US Treasuries as the primary global safe-haven asset. This shift in capital flows reflects a broader risk-off sentiment, undermining the dollar\u2019s status and accelerating capital rotation away from the greenback. Market analysts attribute the crisis to a confluence of political signals, changing monetary policy, and a loss of confidence in traditional financial havens.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[Bitnewsbot.com](https://bitnewsbot.com/us-dollar-hits-lows-as-gold/)\n\n**The Melt-Up Trap: Why Stocks Must Rise Until US Dollar Breaks**\nThe University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which measures household confidence in personal finances, job prospects, inflation, and future expectations, is near record lows\u2014lower than during the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com bust, and previous recessions. Despite this widespread pessimism, stock market valuations, particularly the S&P 500, are at or near nominal all-time highs. The article argues this disconnect reflects a 'melt-up trap' driven by persistent fiat currency debasement. Measuring the S&P 500 in gold\u2014a 'mirror of truth'\u2014reveals a different story: the index is worth only 43 grams of gold today, down over 73% from its 1999 peak of 164 grams and down more than 47% from its 2021 peak of 82 grams. In gold terms, the market has been in a deep bear market since 1999, with no sustained upward trend. The author contends that nominal gains are illusory and driven by currency devaluation, not real wealth creation. The article predicts that in 2026, the stock market will continue rising in nominal terms while the US dollar weakens further, but gold will rise even faster, making gold and gold-related assets the primary beneficiaries of this trend. The author concludes that positioning in real assets, particularly gold, will matter more than headlines in the coming years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:02 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-meltup-trap-why-stocks-must-rise-until-us-dollar-breaks-200673977)\n\n**'Everyone Thinks They Got Rich. They Didn't': Anthony Scaramucci Says The Dollar Stands Hollowed**\nFormer White House communications director and investor Anthony Scaramucci claimed on January 18, 2026, that inflation has eroded the value of the U.S. dollar, leading to a widespread illusion of wealth among Americans. He stated that the dollar has lost approximately 28% of its value over the past five years due to inflation, writing, 'Everyone thinks they got rich. They didn't.' Scaramucci argued that rising nominal figures\u2014such as home prices or salaries\u2014are misleading because they do not reflect diminished purchasing power. To illustrate, he compared a home purchased in 1962 for $16,000 (equivalent to 457 ounces of gold at $35 per ounce) to its current estimated value of $750,000, now equivalent to only 227 ounces of gold at $3,300 per ounce\u2014showing a significant decline in real value. He emphasized that 'you're not richer. The currency is weaker.' His remarks were supported by data showing the U.S. dollar index fell to 99.15 on January 19, 2026, down 9% from the previous year and below its 2022 peak of nearly 113, according to Trading Economics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 07:50 AM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/financial-advisors/26/01/49987492/everyone-thinks-they-got-rich-they-didnt-anthony-scaramucci-says-the-dollar-stands-hollowed)\n\n**2026 Dollar Outlook: Will the Strength of the U.S. Dollar Continue?**\nThe article analyzes the factors driving the U.S. dollar's strength since mid-2021, attributing it to stronger U.S. economic growth, higher real interest rates (nominal rate minus inflation), and the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) policy, which reduced the money supply by $2.4 trillion over three years, increasing long-term U.S. Treasury yields. Despite global central banks lowering interest rates after inflation was tamed, the U.S. remained an exception, maintaining high rates due to robust growth and inflation concerns. This interest rate differential, combined with increased safe-haven demand amid rising geopolitical risks, fueled the dollar's rise\u2014its index rising 22% from around 90 to 110. However, by December 2025, the dollar had declined nearly 10% year-to-date, with a 13% drop against the euro. Looking ahead to 2026, analysts expect the dollar to weaken or remain range-bound, as global economic divergence narrows and interest rate differentials shrink. The European Central Bank has stopped cutting rates, while the Federal Reserve has begun lowering rates and ending QT, reducing the U.S. yield advantage. Additionally, U.S. fiscal deficits and debt levels are expected to remain high, increasing dollar volatility. Furthermore, global central banks have reduced their dollar holdings to 56.92% in Q3 2025 (down from 70% two decades ago), while gold prices surged 70% in 2025, signaling a weakening dollar safe-haven status. A Reuters survey from November 28 to December 3, 2025, found most respondents expect a bearish dollar outlook for 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 25, 2025 11:54 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/opinion/20251225003229-262104)\n\n**Bitcoin Fell Short Of $100K When Inflation Is Applied Says Alex Thorn 2025**\nGalaxy Digital\u2019s head of research, Alex Thorn, stated that Bitcoin never truly reached $100,000 in real value when adjusted for inflation, despite its nominal peak of over $126,000 in October 2025. Using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from 2020 onward, Thorn calculated that Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high equated to $99,848 in 2020 dollars\u2014just shy of the $100,000 milestone. The U.S. dollar has lost approximately 20% of its purchasing power since 2020, according to CPI data, meaning today\u2019s dollar buys only about 80% of what it did in 2020. Thorn emphasized that inflation-adjusted analysis, which accounts for each annual inflation reading, provides a more accurate picture of real asset value. He noted that while Bitcoin\u2019s nominal price surged, its real value growth is lower when measured in constant 2020 dollars. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index has declined 11% in 2025, reaching a three-year low of 96.3, reflecting broader dollar weakness. Thorn\u2019s analysis challenges the popular narrative centered on nominal price milestones and highlights the growing importance of real value metrics in long-term asset evaluation.

According to a GMA Capital report based on data from the BCRA and the Market Expectations Survey (REM), inflation is the key variable determining the official dollar's ceiling. In the base scenario, with inflation projected at around 24%, the official dollar's upper band would start January 2026 at approximately $1,565, exceed $1,700 by mid-year, and close December 2026 near $1,915. In a pessimistic scenario with 30% inflation, the upper band could approach $2,000 by year-end. Conversely, in an optimistic scenario with 19% inflation, the dollar would close near $1,843. The report compares these projections to the previous fixed 1% monthly adjustment system, which would have resulted in an upper band of $1,720 by end-2026\u2014$195 lower than the base scenario under the new regime. The report concludes that economic nominalism will continue to drive the exchange rate trajectory, and without faster disinflation, the band will keep rising, setting increasingly higher ceilings for the U.S. dollar.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 21, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[El Intransigente](https://elintransigente.com/2025/12/el-mercado-advierte-que-el-dolar-oficial-podria-acercarse-a-los-2-000-en-2026/)\n\n**D\u00f3lar 2026: Projections Show Official Dollar Ceiling Could Approach $2,000**\nThe new inflation-adjusted exchange rate scheme (IPC T-2) set to take effect in 2026 will make the official dollar's upper band dependent on the evolution of the Consumer Price Index (IPC), according to a report by GMA Capital. The market is already factoring in the impact of this new regime, which replaces the previous fixed monthly adjustment of 1% with a dynamic mechanism tied directly to inflation. The report outlines three possible scenarios for the end of 2026 based on data from the BCRA and the Market Expectations Survey (REM). In the base scenario, the official dollar's upper band is projected to reach $1.915 by the end of 2026, compared to the previous fixed ceiling of $1.720\u2014a difference of $195.

The Federal Reserve's Trade-Weighted Real Broad Dollar Index, which measures the inflation-adjusted value of the dollar against 26 currencies based on trade competitiveness, is currently approximately 20% above its long-term average. Historically, such high readings have only occurred in the 1930s and 1980s.

Morgan Stanley forecasts the DXY index to decline to 94.000 in the first half of 2026 from 99.447 as of November 17, 2025, due to declining real yields\u2014especially if front-end real yields fall by 15 bps\u2014undermining dollar strength. Market uncertainty over the Fed\u2019s cutting pace, with expectations ranging from two cuts by midyear to a more aggressive path if labor conditions worsen, has increased risk premium, fueling early 2026 dollar weakness. However, if the Fed provides clear policy signals by summer meetings, the dollar could stabilize and rebound to 99.000 by year-end, supported by elevated fiscal issuance and the need for high nominal yields to attract global buyers. Cross-asset reactions to weaker U.S. labor data have already been pronounced: S&P 500 fell ~0.4% intraday, 10-year Treasury yields dropped 5\u20137 bps, EURUSD rose 30\u201345 pips, GBPUSD gained 20\u201330 pips, gold rose $12\u201318/oz, WTI crude dropped 0.5%, and credit spreads widened (IG OAS: +1\u20132 bps, HY: +4 bps). The base case assumes tactical dollar weakness in H1 2026 followed by stabilization in H2. Key triggers include upcoming nonfarm payrolls, jobless claims, and the March and June FOMC meetings. The alternative scenario\u2014two consecutive months of contracting payrolls and core PCE below 2% year-on-year\u2014could push the DXY below 93.000, steepen the yield curve by over 10 bps, and trigger broader equity weakness, stronger gold gains, and sharp EM FX outperformance. Investors heavily hedged against dollar downside face risk if the dollar stabilizes faster than expected. The strategic implication is to treat dollar weakness as tactical, favoring selective exposure to high-beta currencies and equities near 94.000, while remaining alert to shifts in labor data or Fed communication.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-dollar-faces-twostage-weakness-path-as-fed-uncertainty-builds-into-2026-200670294)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nBased on recent analyst commentary (mid-January to early February 2026), here's a comprehensive overview of perspectives on the **Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index** ahead of the January 2026 CPI release and evolving Fed policy expectations:\n\n### Key Catalysts Shaping Sentiment\n1. **Fed Leadership Shift**:  \n   - President Trump\u2019s nomination of **Kevin Warsh** as Federal Reserve Chair (replacing Jerome Powell) has been the dominant driver, with analysts viewing Warsh as **less dovish** than previously anticipated [1][4][5][8][9][10].  \n   - Markets perceive Warsh as focused on **inflation containment** and less inclined toward aggressive rate cuts, given his historical hawkishness during prior Fed tenure (2006\u20132011) [8][10]. This has strengthened the dollar index (DXY), which rebounded from a 4-year low (~95.5) to ~97.2 [3][4][7][9][10].  \n\n2. **Upcoming January CPI Release**:  \n   - Analysts emphasize this report as **crucial for confirming disinflation trends**. While December CPI showed modest easing (core at 2.6% YoY), hotter-than-expected PPI (3.0% YoY) has tempered optimism about near-term rate cuts [3][7][10][18].  \n   - Consensus expects a **\"hold-steady\" Fed** until mid-2026, with markets pricing only a 17% chance of a March cut and ~50 bps total easing by year-end [10][18]. A strong January CPI could further delay cuts, boosting the dollar [7][18].  \n\n### Conflicting Analyst Views\n- **Bullish Dollar Perspectives**:  \n  - **Hawkish Policy Reset**: Institutions like KBC Bank and Reuters note Warsh\u2019s nomination has reduced fears of premature easing, restoring Fed credibility and attracting capital inflows [8][10]. Paul Spirgel (Reuters) highlights this as a structural dollar support [8].  \n  - **Geopolitical/Safe-Haven Demand**: Escalating U.S.-Iran tensions and global instability (e.g., Taiwan risks) amplify the dollar\u2019s safe-haven appeal [5][9][10][18].  \n  - **Technical Strength**: The DXY broke above 97.0 resistance, with analysts eyeing 98.0 if CPI surprises upside [7][9].  \n\n- **Cautious/Bearish Considerations**:  \n  - **Political Uncertainty**: Investigations into former Chair Powell\u2019s testimony and Trump\u2019s pressure on the Fed create institutional risks that could undermine the dollar long-term [17][19][20].  \n  - **Global Divergence**: Potential ECB/BoJ policy shifts in 2026 (e.g., if Eurozone inflation softens) might pressure the dollar later this year [4][17].  \n  - **Overbought Signals**: The dollar\u2019s sharp rebound triggered overbought RSI readings, suggesting near-term consolidation risk [7][8].  \n\n### Critical Weaknesses in Current Data\n1. **Warsh\u2019s Unclear Stance**: Analysts admit uncertainty about Warsh\u2019s *current* policy views, noting his past Great Financial Crisis approach was criticized as overly rigid [8][10]. Markets await his Senate testimony for clarity.  \n2. **CPI Sensitivity**: January CPI data (imminent) could drastically alter expectations\u2014especially if core inflation falls below 2.5% or surges above 3.0% [7][18].  \n3. **Geopolitical Wildcards**: U.S.-Iran conflict escalation or de-escalation would rapidly impact risk sentiment and dollar flows [5][9][10].  \n\n### Conclusion\nAnalysts broadly agree the dollar index faces **near-term upside pressure** from Warsh\u2019s appointment and resilient U.S. data, but warn of **volatility around CPI release**. The consensus recommends:  \n- **Pre-CPI**: Tactical dollar longs, citing reduced Fed dovishness and safe-haven flows [1][7][10].  \n- **Post-CPI**: Reassess based on whether inflation aligns with the Fed\u2019s \"higher-for-longer\" narrative [3][18].  \n\nShould January CPI undershoot, markets may revive rate-cut bets, pressuring the dollar\u2014especially if political risks resurface [17][19]. Conversely, upside CPI surprise could propel DXY toward 98.0 [7][9].  \n\n**Citations**:  \n[1][4][5][7][8][9][10][17][18][19][20]\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
