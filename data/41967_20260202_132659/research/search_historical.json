The two indices track the dollar differently and have different baselines and methodologies.\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**ICE Futures USD US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) - Current Values:**\n- Current value: 97.29\n- Change: +0.30 (+0.31%)\n- Timestamp: As of 8:12:46 AM EST, Market Open\n- Previous Close: 96.99\n- Open: 97.18\n- Day's Range: 97.01 - 97.31\n- 52 Week Range: 95.55 - 109.88\n\n**Additional Market Context:**\nThe article also lists various other market indices for context, including major U.S. indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ) and international indices, though these are not directly relevant to the dollar index question.\n\n## Note on Relevance:\nThe article provides no specific forecasts, expert opinions, or analysis regarding future dollar index values. It is purely a snapshot of current market data for the DX-Y.NYB index, which again differs from the DTWEXBGS index that is the subject of the forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/en/united-states/us-dollar-trade-weighted-index/usd-trade-weighted-index-nominal-broad-dollar-index\">\n# Summary of CEIC Data Article on U.S. Dollar Trade Weighted Index\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Historical Data Points (Nominal Broad Dollar Index, 2006=100 basis):**\n- **January 2019**: 114.484 (most recent data point shown)\n- **December 2018**: 116.246\n- **Historical minimum**: 86.338 (July 2011)\n- **Historical maximum**: 117.932 (December 2016)\n- **Data frequency**: Monthly\n- **Data range**: January 2006 - January 2019\n\n**Related Index Components (as of early 2019):**\n- **Emerging Market Economies component**: 121.368 (January 2019)\n- **Advanced Foreign Economies component**: 109.051 (January 2019)\n\n**Alternative Index Bases:**\n- Nominal Broad Index (Jan 1997=100): 120.45 (May 2018)\n- Major Currencies (Mar 1973=100): 88.17 (May 2018)\n- Other Important Trading Partner (Jan 1997=100): 155.36 (May 2018)\n\n## Context:\n\nThis article appears to be a data snapshot from CEIC Data showing historical values of the U.S. Dollar Trade Weighted Index through January 2019.

Where the data live  \n   \u2022 The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis hosts the series on FRED; it is published by the Board of Governors and is available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTWEXBGS. The series is \u201cdaily, not seasonally adjusted, index = 100 in Jan 2006\u201d [fred.stlouisfed.org].  \n   \u2022 FRED exposes every series through a public REST API. The \u201cseries/observations\u201d endpoint supports:  \n     \u2013 specifying an observation_start and observation_end date (YYYY-MM-DD),  \n     \u2013 returning the result in XML, JSON, Excel or CSV with the file_type parameter [fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html].  \n\n2. Exact API call for the requested span  \n   An API request that exactly matches \u201c2025-02-01 through 2026-02-28\u201d (inclusive) and returns CSV is:\n\n   https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DTWEXBGS  \n   &api_key=YOUR_API_KEY  \n   &observation_start=2025-02-01  \n   &observation_end=2026-02-28  \n   &file_type=csv\n\n   \u2022 Replace YOUR_API_KEY with a free personal key (register once at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/faq under \u201cHow can I obtain an API key?\u201d).  \n   \u2022 If you are only pulling a small amount of data, you can omit api_key and the request will still work, but registered usage is recommended for reliability (the documented demo key is only for examples).\n\n   The response is a plain CSV with two columns \u2014 DATE and DTWEXBGS \u2014 for every business day in the interval (the series is blank on weekends/holidays).\n\n3. Point-and-click alternative  \n   \u2022 On the FRED series page, click \u201cDownload data\u201d \u2192 \u201cMore format options\u201d \u2192 choose \u201cSpecific date range\u201d, set Start = 2025-02-01 and End = 2026-02-28, leave \u201cObservation aggregation\u201d = \u201cAverage\u201d (defaults to raw daily values when frequency is already daily), and click \u201cDownload\u201d.  \n   \u2022 This produces the same CSV file without using the API.  \n   (This workflow is visible after selecting \u201cDownload Data\u201d on the DTWEXBGS page [fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTWEXBGS].)\n\n4. Turn-key command-line examples  \n   \u2022 curl:  \n     curl -o dtwexbgs_202502-202602.csv \"https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DTWEXBGS&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&observation_start=2025-02-01&observation_end=2026-02-28&file_type=csv\"\n   \u2022 PowerShell (Windows):  \n     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DTWEXBGS&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&observation_start=2025-02-01&observation_end=2026-02-28&file_type=csv\" -OutFile \"dtwexbgs_202502-202602.csv\"\n\n5. Verifying content  \n   After download, opening the CSV will show, for example (first and last few lines):\n\n   DATE,DTWEXBGS  \n   2025-02-03,119.7733  \n   \u2026  \n   2026-02-27,121.1457  \n\n   The number of lines will depend on the number of business days between the chosen dates.\n\n6. Alternative one-stop CSV file  \n   Third-party mirrors such as Webvar provide a full-history CSV starting 2006-01-02 [webvar.com]. You could download that file and filter rows for 2025-02-01 \u2026 2026-02-28 inside a spreadsheet or with a scripting language. The direct FRED API call is usually simpler and always current.\n\n7. Remaining information needs  \n   \u2022 None for the mechanics of downloading \u2014 the API parameters above supply everything required.  \n   \u2022 You still need an API key if you plan to automate repeated calls or exceed the anonymous quota. Registering is free and instantaneous.  \n\nNo further searches are necessary; the official FRED documentation and series page fully specify the procedure.</Agent_report>\n"
