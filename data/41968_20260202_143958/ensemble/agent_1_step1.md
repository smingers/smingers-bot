Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Federal Reserve Article (Jan 14, 2026):** This is a high-quality official source from Fed economists discussing the balance sheet trilemma. Key facts: Fed balance sheet reduced through June 2022-Dec 2025, with reserve management purchases beginning Dec 10, 2025. The last RPONTSYD data point (Jan 30, 2026) was 0.0 billion. This is factual, current, and authoritative.

**FRED Series Page:** Definitional source explaining RPONTSYD measures overnight repos in temporary open market operations, measured in billions USD, updated daily. High quality but purely definitional—no data values or forecasts.

**Fed Press Release (Jan 28, 2026):** Official policy statement maintaining standing repo facility rate at 3.75% with $160bn per-counterparty limit for reverse repos. Describes standing facilities (separate from temporary operations tracked by RPONTSYD). Factual and authoritative but doesn't address temporary OMOs.

**Economic Times Article (Oct 31, 2025):** Reports a $29.4bn repo operation, the largest since 2020, amid falling reserves ($2.8 trillion). Contains analyst opinions characterizing this as a "warning sign" or "quiet bailout." The factual data (operation size, reserve levels) is valuable; the interpretive framing is opinion-based and somewhat sensationalist. Date is ~3 months before forecast date.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive historical analysis showing RPONTSYD has been zero continuously from July 2021 through January 30, 2026 (most recent data). Key insight: With the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) operational since July 2021, the Fed has not needed discretionary overnight repos. No scheduled temporary OMOs for February 2026. High quality, factual summary with clear data provenance.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **RPONTSYD values during SRF era (July 2021-present):** Every single day = 0.0. Highly suitable—this is the current operational regime.

2. **RPONTSYD during ample-reserves periods (2010-2018):** Near-zero throughout. Moderately suitable—similar liquidity environment but pre-SRF.

3. **RPONTSYD during crisis periods (2008-09, Sept 2019, Mar 2020):** Large spikes ($50-215bn). Low suitability—requires crisis conditions not currently evident.

4. **RPONTSYD during year-end/quarter-end periods:** Historically elevated during funding stress periods. February 10 is neither quarter-end nor year-end, reducing relevance.

**Most suitable reference class:** The SRF era (July 2021-January 2026), where RPONTSYD has been consistently 0.0 for 1,675+ consecutive business days. The Standing Repo Facility has fundamentally changed the Fed's operational framework, making discretionary overnight repos unnecessary under normal conditions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days from today (Feb 2 to Feb 10, 2026).

**Historical patterns over similar 8-day periods:**
- Since July 2021: Every 8-day window shows 0.0 throughout
- Pre-SRF but during ample reserves (2015-2018): Consistently 0.0
- During stress periods: Can spike dramatically within days (Sept 2019: 0→$215bn in 2 days)

**Key observation:** February 10 is mid-month, not a typical stress date (not month-end, quarter-end, or tax date). The Economic Times article described a large October 2025 operation, but that was noted as exceptional and occurred during the final phase of QT before its December 2025 conclusion.

## (d) Justification

**Base case (very high probability):** RPONTSYD = 0.0 billion

The overwhelming evidence points to zero:
1. **Structural regime change:** The SRF has replaced discretionary overnight repos as the primary liquidity backstop since July 2021
2. **Perfect track record:** 1,675+ consecutive days at 0.0 through Jan 30, 2026
3. **No scheduled operations:** FRBNY has not announced any temporary OMOs for February 2026
4. **Timing:** Feb 10 is not a typical stress date
5. **Recent policy:** Fed ended QT in December 2025 and began reserve management purchases, suggesting ample liquidity

**Tail risk (low probability):** Non-zero value

Possible scenarios requiring intervention:
- Unexpected reserve drain or funding market disruption (similar to Sept 2019)
- Technical glitch or payment system issue
- Geopolitical shock affecting Treasury markets
- The October 2025 $29.4bn operation shows the Fed retains willingness to intervene when needed

However, these scenarios are unlikely within 8 days given:
- No current signs of funding stress
- SRF available as first line of defense
- Reserve levels stabilizing post-QT

The October operation was exceptional (largest in 5 years) but occurred during QT runoff—a different regime than post-December 2025.

Outside view calibration:

Given the structural regime with SRF and the unbroken 4.5-year streak of zeros, my base case is heavily weighted toward 0.0. However, I must account for:

1. **Black swan risk:** The September 2019 episode showed repos can activate suddenly ($0→$215bn in days) when funding stress emerges unexpectedly. Though unlikely in 8 days, it's non-zero probability.

2. **Historical upset rate:** In the SRF era, the "upset rate" for RPONTSYD being non-zero is 0% across 1,675+ observations. Pre-SRF during ample reserves (2010-2018), it was also near 0%. This suggests very high confidence in zero outcome.

3. **Distribution shape:** This is a highly skewed distribution. The modal outcome is 0.0 with very high probability (~85-90%). The right tail extends to potential crisis-level operations ($20-50bn+) with very low probability (~1-5%).

4. **Tethering to established patterns:** 
   - Lower percentiles (10th-60th): Should cluster at or very near 0.0
   - Upper percentiles (70th-90th): Small probability mass on modest interventions ($5-15bn) 
   - Extreme tail (>95th): Larger crisis operations ($20-50bn+)

5. **Confidence interval:** My 10th-90th percentile range should reflect that ~80% of probability mass sits at exactly 0.0, with the remaining 20% spread across possible intervention scenarios.

Given the question's upper bound is 20.53325 billion (which can be exceeded), I'll set:
- Lower percentiles at 0.0 (the overwhelming base case)
- Middle percentiles still at 0.0 (reflecting >50% probability)
- Upper percentiles allowing for small intervention scenarios
- 90th percentile accounting for modest but non-crisis intervention

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 0.0
Percentile 20: 0.0
Percentile 40: 0.0
Percentile 60: 0.0
Percentile 80: 0.0
Percentile 90: 8.5
