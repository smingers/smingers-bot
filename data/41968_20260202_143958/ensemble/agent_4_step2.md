Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. New York Fed operating-policy note (11 Dec 2025).  Primary document, high quality, factual.  Announces that overnight repos will henceforth be offered only as a standing, full-allotment facility; removes aggregate limits.  Does NOT schedule discretionary temporary open-market (TOMO) repos.  
  b. FRED metadata for RPONTSYD.  High quality, factual.  Defines the series that will settle the question: daily, billions of dollars, “Temporary Open Market Operations – Overnight Repos.”  
  c. FRED daily data (downloaded 2 Feb 2026).  Empirical evidence: every business day from 1 Jul 2021 through 30 Jan 2026 reads 0.0 billion.  
  d. Reuters/Investing.com wires (10 Dec 2025, 31 Dec 2025).  Reliable financial media.  Report Fed resuming PERMANENT reserve-management purchases and year-end standing-repo usage; none mentions a TOMO overnight repo that would appear in RPONTSYD.  
  e. Economic Times & BeInCrypto pieces (31 Oct & 22 Dec 2025).  Medium reliability, mix of fact and editorial.  Cite large “repo injections” but conflate standing-repo-facility usage or permanent purchases; no matching prints in RPONTSYD.  
  f. Asknews articles (2 Feb 2026) about Kevin Warsh, Fed balance-sheet politics, etc.  Opinion-heavy, not about overnight TOMO repos.  Low relevance.

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
  • Historical pattern: 0.0 billion on 900+ consecutive business days (structural, hard to change).  
  • No Fed announcement of a discretionary TOMO schedule; Fed currently relies on standing facilities and permanent purchases.  
Moderate evidence  
  • Year-end 2025 funding stress was met without triggering RPONTSYD prints, implying high bar for resuming TOMOs.  
  • Standing repo facility rate is only 5 bp over IOER, making SRF the preferred tool if stress suddenly appears.  
Weak evidence  
  • Opinion pieces suggesting hidden money-market strains or an imminent “pivot.”  
  • Speculation that new Fed leadership in 2026 might change operational preferences in the next few days.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 8 calendar days (6 business days).  Funding conditions rarely change regime that quickly outside extreme shocks (e.g., Lehman 2008, Sept 2019).  If the horizon were doubled to one month I would increase the non-zero probability from ~3 % to ~6 %; halved to three business days it would fall below 2 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: 0.0 billion with >95 % frequency in the post-2021 regime.  
Adjustment factors:  
+ 0.5 pp  Possibility of an idiosyncratic settlement glitch (e.g., Treasury coupon payment 15 Feb).  
+ 1.5 pp  Political uncertainty (new governors, potential policy mis-communications).  
– 1.0 pp  Recent year-end stress resolved without using TOMO repos.  
Net non-zero probability ≈ 3 %.  In those scenarios, size distribution is wide (1–20 billion), centre ~5 billion.  Expected value ≈ 0.12 billion; median ~0.

Probability calibration
I represent the heavy 0-mass by very small positive numbers up to the 90th percentile, then allow a fat right tail for the 3 % stress scenario.

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Target variable: RPONTSYD value, billions USD, for 10 Feb 2026 (daily close).  
2. Base rate: 0.0 b for 97 % of days since Jul 2021.  
3. Implied median ≈ 0.001; mean ≈ 0.12 – consistent with 97 % mass at zero, 3 % tail to ~5 b mean.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 900-day 0-print streak; (ii) Fed guidance that SRF is primary tool; (iii) Year-end 2025 stress did not move RPONTSYD; (iv) No quarter-end near 10 Feb; (v) Standing-repo rate already attractive.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden clearing-bank failure forcing Fed to run emergency TOMO; would push outcome up (10–50 b).
