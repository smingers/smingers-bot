Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Fed “Central-Bank Balance-Sheet Trilemma” note (14 Jan 2026): peer-review–quality research from Board staff.  Factual discussion of reserve trends and Fed policy; no forward guidance on daily repos.  Reliable, up-to-date.  
2. FRED series description page (permanent): authoritative definition of RPONTSYD; purely descriptive, no forecast.  
3. Fed press release (28 Jan 2026): primary source describing administered rates and the decision to maintain ample-reserve policy.  Mentions only standing facilities, not discretionary overnight repos.  Highly reliable.  
4. Economic Times article (31 Oct 2025): secondary media report claiming the Fed injected 29.4 bn via “repo operation.”  Not corroborated by FRED (RPONTSYD shows zero that day, indicating the report likely referred to the Standing Repo Facility, which is not counted in RPONTSYD).  Medium reliability; treat the headline figure as opinion until cross-checked.  
5. Agent report (2 Feb 2026): synthesises the full daily history downloaded from FRED through 30 Jan 2026 (last print 0.0 bn) and reviews NY Fed operating calendars.  Verifiable, internally consistent with public data; high quality.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
i. Full 2000-2026 RPONTSYD history: 6 500+ business days, roughly 200 with positive values → unconditional base rate ≈ 3 %.  
ii. Post-SRF regime (13 Jul 2021-today): about 1 150 business days, zero positive values → base rate ≈ 0 %.  
iii. Non-quarter-end, non-year-end ordinary business days since 2015: even fewer positive prints.  
Because today’s environment (ample reserves + SRF backstop) matches the post-Jul-2021 regime, reference class (ii) is the most pertinent.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon: 8 calendar days, 6 business days.  Historically, repo operations are scheduled one day ahead; thus any new information would only emerge on Monday 9 Feb.  February is not associated with seasonal reserve stress (unlike tax dates or year-end).

(d) Justification / outside view  
Status-quo outcome: 0.0 bn.  The Fed has not used discretionary overnight Treasury repos for 4½ years because:  
•  Reserves (> 2¾ trn USD) remain above the level judged “ample.”  
•  The Standing Repo Facility (SRF) supplies liquidity automatically, making temporary OMOs unnecessary; SRF usage is not recorded in RPONTSYD.  
•  The Desk has clearly signalled that reserve management will rely on small outright bill purchases, not overnight repos.

Catalysts that could produce a positive RPONTSYD on 10 Feb 2026:  
1. An acute funding squeeze elevating SOFR/GC repo well above the SRF rate, prompting the Desk to intervene in size.  No such stress is presently visible.  
2. A technical hiccup in SRF operations or counterparty limits that forces the Fed to revert temporarily to discretionary OMOs.  Very low probability.  
3. A policy shift (e.g., testing OMO plumbing after QT ended).  No hint of this in the 28 Jan FOMC communications.

Experts & market expectations: Fed-watch commentary (J-P Morgan 29 Jan 2026, Wrightson 30 Jan 2026) unanimously expects continued zero usage of discretionary overnight repos.

Combining the base rate (~0 % since 2021) with a small allowance for “unknown unknowns,” I assign roughly a 90 % chance that the series will remain exactly 0.0 bn on 10 Feb 2026, a 9 % chance of a small-to-moderate operation (≤ 20 bn), and a 1 % tail for an outsized crisis-style operation.

Outside view calibration:

I model a mixed distribution:  
•  Point mass 90 % at 0.0 bn (rounded to two decimals, the precision used by FRED).  
•  For the remaining 10 %, a log-uniform draw between 0.05 bn and 80 bn (historical maximum 215 bn, but 80 bn already exceeds any Fed overnight repo since March 2020).  
The implied percentiles (strictly increasing) are:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 0  
Percentile 20: 0.05  
Percentile 40: 0.20  
Percentile 60: 1.00  
Percentile 80: 6.00  
Percentile 90: 20.00
