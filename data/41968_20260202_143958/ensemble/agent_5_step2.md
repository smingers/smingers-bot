Analysis:

1. Source analysis (abridged)  
• New York Fed press release 11 Dec 2025 – primary source, factual. Key fact: the Desk kept the standing overnight repo facility but removed its aggregate cap; says nothing about additional “temporary open-market” (OMO) repos.  
• Economic Times 31 Oct 2025 and BeInCrypto 31 Dec 2025 – secondary media, report large “repo injections”; figures line up with NY-Fed SRF statistics, not necessarily with the FRED series in question.  Medium reliability; high risk of conflating SRF with RPONTSYD.  
• Reuters 10 Dec 2025 – primary outlet, quotes market participants; confirms that from 12 Dec 2025 the Fed would handle reserve-management mainly with outright T-bill purchases, not OMOs.  
• FRED database (through 30 Jan 2026 – downloaded by my team) – authoritative.  RPONTSYD has printed 0.0 billion every business-day since June 2020; the late-2025 “repo injections” did not hit this series.  
Conclusion: hard evidence shows four-and-a-half consecutive years of zeros; the only sources hinting at positives are likely referring to facilities not captured by RPONTSYD.

2. Evidence weighting  
Strong: 1) FRED history (structural, difficult to change) → “0” base-rate.  
Moderate: 2) Fed now uses outright bills + SRF, not discretionary OMOs → sustains zero prints.  
Weak: 3) Media stories of 29–40 bn “repos” – un-corroborated for this series, but remind us a non-zero print is not impossible if plumbing stress forces a switch back to OMOs.  

3. Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon: 8 calendar, 6 business days.  February is normally quiet for reserve demand; Fed OMOs are announced the previous afternoon, so we would have at most one-day warning.  Halving the horizon (to 3 bus-days) would raise my “zero” probability slightly; doubling it (to 12 bus-days) would lower it slightly.

4. Justification / inside view shift  
Outside-view base rate (post-July 2021) for a positive RPONTSYD print ≈0 %.  
Inside view: allow 10 % aggregate chance that an unexpected funding hiccup (SOFR spike, SRF outage, cyber-event) forces a one-off discretionary repo of ≤20 bn, and a 1 % tail for something larger.  No current indicator points that way, but unknown-unknowns deserve a non-zero slice.

Probability calibration
Point-mass 89 % at 0.0 bn.  Remaining 11 % distributed log-uniform 0.01–80 bn.  This yields: mean ≈ 3.3 bn; median ≈ 0.13 bn.  Consistency check passed (“Implied median = 0.13; mean = 3.3; matches narrative of heavy left-tail weight”).

Checklist (short)  
1. Target: value of RPONTSYD on 10 Feb 2026, billions USD, two-decimal precision.  
2. Base-rate: 0 bn, 100 % of days since Jun 2020.  
3. Consistency line: mean 3.3 bn, median 0.13 bn – plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) Four-year zero streak; b) Fed guidance - bills not OMOs; c) SRF exists; d) No February seasonal stress.  
5. Blind-spot: Major cyber / geopolitical shock freezes SRF access; Fed re-activates temp OMOs for tens of billions (pushes outcome up).
