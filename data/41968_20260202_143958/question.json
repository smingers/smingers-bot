    "description": "The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series RPONTSYD is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the aggregated daily value of US Treasury securities repurchased overnight by the Federal Reserve in temporary open market operations . The title of the series is \"Overnight Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Purchased by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-01-30 and has a value of 0.0. The units of the series are \"Billions of US Dollars\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTSYD). Below are the notes attached to the series:\n\n> This series is constructed as the aggregated daily amount value of the RP transactions reported by the New York Fed as part of the Temporary Open Market Operations.\n> \n> Temporary open market operations involve short-term repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are designed to temporarily add or drain reserves available to the banking system and influence day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.\n> \n> A repurchase agreement (known as repo or RP) is a transaction in which the New York Fed under the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Maker Committee buys a security from an eligible counterparty under an agreement to resell that security in the future. For these transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments, federal agency debt and the mortgage-backed securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies.\n\n`{\"format\":\"fred_value_at_time\",\"info\":{\"series_id\":\"RPONTSYD\"}}`",

It will paginate through the data found at the API endpoint `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=RPONTSYD`. This endpoint includes the latest data for the series. The latest revised data will be used when the resolution is assessed. The datapoint matching 2026-02-10 will be used to determine the resolution of this question.\n\nA datapoint matches if:\n1. The series is updated daily and the date of the datapoint is within 1 day previous to the resolution date.\n2. The series is updated weekly and the date of the datapoint is within 7 days previous to the resolution date.\n3. The series is updated monthly and the date of the datapoint is within 31 days previous to the resolution date.\n\nIf the datapoint is clearly skipped, or no datapoint is found after 2 weeks of checking then the question will be annulled.",
