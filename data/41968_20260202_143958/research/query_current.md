Analysis:
The RPONTSYD series has been at 0.0 since mid-2022, reflecting that the New York Fed has not run any overnight repo (temporary open-market) operations for Treasury collateral.  To judge whether the value might remain at zero or jump above zero by 2026-02-10, the key information we need is:
• Any recent (late-2025/early-2026) FOMC or New York Fed announcements about restarting, scheduling, or conducting overnight repo operations.  
• News stories or market commentary describing sudden funding-market stress (e.g., quarter-end liquidity strains, debt-ceiling episodes) that could prompt the Desk to resume repos.  
• Data releases or press releases from the New York Fed’s “Temporary Open Market Operations” page showing new operations executed after 2026-01-30.  

The searches therefore focus on: 1) official Fed communications about temporary open-market operations, 2) financial-market news on liquidity conditions and potential Fed interventions, and 3) any direct reports of executed overnight Treasury repos.
