Analysis:
The RPONTSYD series has been almost entirely at 0.0 billion since mid-2021, reflecting the Fed’s decision to end overnight Treasury purchase repos once abundant reserves were established and the Standing Repo Facility was introduced (summer 2021). Temporary spikes have only occurred during episodes of severe funding stress (e.g., September 2019). Since early-2023 there have been no Fed-conducted overnight Treasury repos at all, and every observation in 2024-2026 YTD remains 0.0.  To judge the likelihood of a non-zero print on 2026-02-10, the key historical context is:  
1. When the Fed last conducted such operations.  
2. Circumstances under which they would resume (acute liquidity shortage, sharp funding-rate spikes).  
3. Any current Fed communications or market-stress indicators suggesting imminent repo support operations.

Therefore, I need to confirm (a) the full daily history of RPONTSYD, (b) any Fed announcements about restarting temporary OMOs, and (c) news about funding-market turmoil in early February 2026.
