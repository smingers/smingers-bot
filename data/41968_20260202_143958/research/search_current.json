Warsh, a former Fed governor (2006\u20132011), has long criticized the expansion of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and advocates for reducing its size to allow market forces to determine interest rates. He opposes the idea of the Fed holding large amounts of mortgage-backed securities to keep rates low, a policy that conflicts with Trump\u2019s January 2026 directive to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Warsh\u2019s views align with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also favors reducing the Fed\u2019s role and shifting responsibility to the Treasury. Warsh proposes a new 1951-style accord between the Fed and Treasury to define an optimal balance sheet size. He believes that reducing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and allowing market forces to operate freely could lead to lower long-term interest rates. However, rapid reduction could strain bank liquidity, as the current ample reserves framework relies on high levels of Fed-held assets. Analysts at Barclays suggest Warsh might end monthly asset purchases, allowing financing costs to rise, or shift the Fed\u2019s portfolio toward shorter-term securities\u2014currently averaging over nine years in maturity. Despite his influence on the Federal Open Market Committee, Warsh faces resistance; JPMorgan analysts note that most Fed members support maintaining substantial reserves. BMO\u2019s Vail Hartman warns that a significantly smaller balance sheet would require a major overhaul of current banking regulations. The Fed began reducing its balance in late 2025, causing short-term Treasury market stress due to reduced demand. Warsh\u2019s vision for a leaner, more market-driven Fed could reshape U.S. monetary policy, but faces structural and political hurdles.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - French](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fr/kevin-warsh-and-feds-6-6t-balance-sheet-qe/)\n\n**What Can Kevin Warsh Do With the $6.6 Trillion Quantitative Easing Legacy Left by the Federal Reserve?**\nKevin Warsh, appointed by Donald Trump to lead the Federal Reserve in 2026, faces the major challenge of managing the Fed's massive balance sheet, valued at $6.6 trillion. While interest rates dominate public discourse, the real issue lies in the Fed\u2019s vast asset holdings accumulated since 2008 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Warsh, a long-time critic of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet expansion, has consistently opposed the aggressive quantitative easing policies of his predecessors. His views were reinforced when speculation about a rate cut caused bond yields to rise, the dollar to strengthen, and gold and silver prices to plummet\u2014evidence of market sensitivity to his stance. Warsh advocates reducing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet to allow Treasury Department-led fiscal management, arguing that the Fed should not maintain large asset holdings to suppress yields. This contradicts Trump\u2019s directive in January to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities to ease housing loans. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agrees with Warsh, and both aim to diminish the Fed\u2019s role in financial markets. Warsh\u2019s strategy is to restore market freedom by shrinking the Fed\u2019s footprint, though this risks raising long-term interest rates\u2014precisely what Trump seeks to avoid. On Bloomberg TV, Fed official Stephen Miran suggested that short-term rate adjustments could offset balance sheet changes. Warsh, who initially supported QE during his Fed tenure (2006\u20132011), later turned against it, citing its excess. He now calls for a new agreement between the Fed and Treasury, akin to the 1951 accord that ended wartime bond financing. He insists on a clear, jointly defined optimal balance sheet size. Analysts like Joseph Abati of SMBC Nikko note that the balance sheet\u2019s size reflects regulatory needs, and rapid reduction could disrupt short-term borrowing. By late 2025, the Fed began shrinking holdings, but this led to a $40 billion monthly drain on short-term Treasury bills due to rising government borrowing and reduced Fed purchases. Barclays strategists Samuel Earl and Demi Ho suggest Warsh may halt monthly purchases or shift to short-term bonds\u2014currently, the Fed\u2019s average asset maturity is over nine years, while its liabilities average six years. Despite his influence, Warsh holds only one vote on the Federal Open Market Committee. JPMorgan analysts note that while some Fed members may support his ideas, most still favor maintaining ample reserves. As noted by M. Hartmann of Bank of Montreal, a significant reduction would require a fundamental shift in the Fed\u2019s regulatory framework.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:15 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - Arabic](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ar/kevin-warsh-and-feds-6-6t-balance-sheet-qe/)\n\n**How Kevin Warsh Can Manage the Fed\u2019s $6.6 Trillion Balance Sheet Legacy**\nKevin Warsh, nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the world's most powerful central bank in 2026, faces the challenge of managing the Federal Reserve's $6.6 trillion balance sheet. While interest rates dominate public discourse, Warsh emphasizes that the true burden lies in the vast asset holdings accumulated since 2008 and during the pandemic. Warsh, a former Fed official who initially supported quantitative easing but later opposed its expansion, advocates for reducing the balance sheet and shifting fiscal responsibilities to the Treasury Department. He supports a new agreement between the Fed and the Treasury, similar to the 1951 Treasury-Fed Accord, to clarify the balance sheet's size. Despite his push for reduced Fed involvement, his views conflict with Trump\u2019s policy of lowering borrowing costs, including directives to purchase $20 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Warsh warns that shrinking the balance sheet could raise long-term interest rates, contrary to Trump\u2019s goals. Analysts note that while some Fed members may support Warsh\u2019s stance, the majority still favor maintaining ample reserves. The Fed\u2019s current framework, built post-2008, requires banks to hold sufficient liquidity, and reducing the balance sheet too quickly could disrupt short-term lending. In 2025, the Fed began reducing holdings, which led to market instability. Strategists suggest that Warsh may end monthly purchases or shift to shorter-term bonds\u2014currently averaging over 9 years in maturity\u2014to stabilize markets. However, Warsh holds only one vote on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and significant changes would require broad consensus. According to BMO\u2019s Bair Hartmann, a major shift in the Fed\u2019s regulatory framework would be necessary to drastically shrink the balance sheet.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - Japanese](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ja/kevin-warsh-and-feds-6-6t-balance-sheet-qe/)\n\n**What Kevin Warsh could do with the Fed\u2019s $6.6T QE legacy**\nKevin Warsh, appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Federal Reserve in 2026, faces the challenge of managing the Fed\u2019s $6.6 trillion balance sheet\u2014a legacy of quantitative easing following the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Warsh, a former Fed governor known for his criticism of the central bank's asset expansion, has consistently argued that the balance sheet's growth\u2014driven by quantitative easing (QE) during the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014has led to 'monetary dominance,' artificially suppressing borrowing costs and encouraging excessive risk-taking and fiscal irresponsibility. His proposed solution includes reducing the balance sheet, allowing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to manage fiscal policy, and establishing a new Treasury-Fed accord akin to the 1951 agreement. Market reactions to Warsh\u2019s nomination included higher long-term Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, and falling gold and silver prices. Analysts note that shrinking the balance sheet would be challenging: money markets are sensitive to liquidity changes, as seen in 2019 and late 2025 when funding strains prompted the Fed to pause quantitative tightening and resume buying short-term Treasuries. Current Fed policy relies on an 'ample reserves' framework to maintain stability, and a shift to a smaller balance sheet would require major regulatory changes. Barclays strategists suggest Warsh could influence policy by halting monthly Treasury bill purchases or rebalancing the portfolio toward shorter maturities, but he would need consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where not all members support his approach. While immediate policy shifts are unlikely, markets remain alert, with analysts like Gennadiy Goldberg stating that 'markets will remain on edge until Warsh makes his views clearer.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:25 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kevin-warsh-s-return-revives-tensions-over-fed-s-6-6-trillion-qe-hangover-13804349.html)\n\n**Caputo Secures U.S. Treasury Loan to Pay IMF, Conceal Reserve Shortfall**\nThe U.S. Treasury transferred US$ 808 million to Argentina's government to help meet upcoming debt obligations to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), through the sale of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). This transaction, executed on January 29 via the Exchange Stabilization Fund, enabled Argentina to pay US$ 833 million in interest due on February 1. Despite the government's public narrative of maintaining a record-high reserve level under Minister Caputo, this move contradicts that claim, as it involved using SDRs rather than depleting official foreign exchange reserves. According to sources cited by La Pol\u00edtica Online (LPO), the government avoided reducing its reserves by using pesos from the U.S. Treasury to acquire dollars through the existing US$ 20 billion currency swap agreement with the United States. The funds used may have come from Argentina\u2019s US$ 1.580 billion account at the Central Bank, equivalent to around $2.3 trillion in pesos. The strategy aims to preserve reserves and later repay the SDRs to the U.S. upon the pending US$ 1 billion disbursement from the IMF, contingent on approval of the second review of the program. Additional payments of US$ 990 million are due on February 28 for bonds issued to companies (Bopreal). February is critical as the IMF will conduct a technical mission to assess compliance with targets and reform progress. Furthermore, Argentina reportedly purchased US$ 1.1 billion in reserves in January following a policy shift that adjusted exchange rate bands to match inflation and launched a new purchasing plan. To maintain reserve targets and avoid deviation, the government secured a temporary loan from the U.S. Treasury, which will be repaid after the IMF review. Clar\u00edn notes expectations of Argentina returning to international markets to refinance debt, with a sovereign risk rating below 500 points.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[La Pol\u00edtica Online](https://www.lapoliticaonline.com/economia/caputo-tuvo-que-pedirle-otro-prestamo-a-bessent-para-pagarle-al-fmi-y-disfrazar-la-meta-de-reservas/)\n\n**Argentina Buys US$872 Million in SDRs from U.S. to Pay IMF Interest, Ahead of Key Review**\nArgentina purchased US$872 million in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the United States on January 25, 2026, to meet an interest payment due to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on February 1, 2026. The SDRs, a global reserve asset created by the IMF, are used by member countries to settle international obligations. This transaction, registered on the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s website but not yet reflected in Argentina\u2019s Central Bank (BCRA) or Treasury records, was a routine SDR purchase, not part of the bilateral currency swap agreement previously in place. The swap was fully canceled in December 2025 as part of a US$20 billion stabilization agreement announced in October 2025. The U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), managed by the Department of the Treasury, is the world\u2019s largest seller of SDRs. This marks the second such purchase in 2026\u2014previously, on October 10, 2025, the U.S. transferred US$872 million in SDRs, which was part of the swap. The current purchase is not tied to that agreement. The IMF\u2019s second review of Argentina\u2019s US$20 billion program, expected in February 2026, hinges on Argentina\u2019s performance, particularly its failure to meet the revised net international reserve target of -US$1 billion, instead ending 2025 at approximately -US$14.1 billion, a shortfall of over US$13 billion. The government plans to request a waiver and revise targets.

The U.S. Treasury's rising debt and unsustainable fiscal path\u2014where interest payments have already surpassed defense spending\u2014pose a major risk. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), net interest payments are projected to reach 4.1% of GDP by 2034, making it the largest single expenditure outside Social Security and Medicare. The Trump-era 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' (OBBBA) and new tariff policies are expected to push national debt to 120% of GDP by 2035. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that without a breakthrough in productivity, the bond market will soon hit a wall, potentially triggering a sharp rise in interest rates. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent FOMC decision, which ended in a 10-2 split\u2014marking the first time since 2008 without unanimous agreement\u2014has raised concerns about the Fed\u2019s independence. The new operating guidelines allow full rollover of maturing Treasury bonds and full reinvestment of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) proceeds into short-term Treasury bills (T-bills), which critics interpret as de facto quantitative easing to support the Treasury. This has led to speculation that while the Fed is not fully controlled, it is at least partially constrained by the Treasury. The Treasury has relied heavily on short-term T-bills\u201484% of new issuance in 2023\u2014far exceeding the recommended 20% benchmark, resembling a 'revolving credit' strategy. If the QRA signals a shift toward longer-term debt issuance, it could trigger a sharp rise in 10- and 30-year bond yields. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s 'term premium'\u2014the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds\u2014is rising due to concerns over supply absorption. This has significant spillover effects: a rising term premium increases risk premiums for emerging markets, including South Korea, and strengthens the dollar, tightening global financial conditions. According to BIS research, shocks from term premium increases affect emerging markets more severely than those from real economic growth. The term premium rise signals that even the safest asset\u2014U.S. Treasuries\u2014now requires a higher risk premium, leading to capital outflows from riskier assets.

This surge in borrowing, driven by year-end liquidity needs, marked the highest level ever recorded for the final day of a year. The increased use of the short-term repo facility (SRF) was anticipated, as repo markets became tighter toward the end of 2025. The Federal Reserve had previously ended a long-running balance sheet reduction program, but new purchases of required reserves initiated last month may help alleviate market tensions over time or at least prevent further tightening. On the morning of Friday, December 31, repo borrowing dropped to $3 billion. The December 31 borrowing consisted of $31.5 billion in Treasury-backed collateral and $43.1 billion in mortgage-backed securities. This figure surpassed the prior peak of $50.35 billion recorded on October 31, 2025, the end of a quarter. The New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk, authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), conducts repo and reverse repo operations to implement monetary policy and ensure market functioning, helping maintain the federal funds rate within the FOMC\u2019s target range. Repo operations involve the Fed purchasing securities from counterparties with an agreement to resell them later, effectively functioning as collateralized loans that temporarily increase bank reserves in the system.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 06:30 PM\nSource:[ISTO\u00c9 Independente](https://istoe.com.br/programa-de-recompra-do-fed-empresta-montante-recorde-no-ultimo-dia-de-2025)\n\n**Federal Reserve Injects $40 Billion in December as Global Liquidity Reaches Record High**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve injected $16 billion into the U.S. banking system on December 30, 2025, marking the second-largest liquidity operation since the COVID-19 pandemic. This was done through overnight repurchase agreements (repos), bringing the total value of Treasury securities purchased via repo operations in December to $40.32 billion. The significant intervention reignited concerns about hidden pressures in short-term financing markets and the implications of record global liquidity for risk assets, including Bitcoin. The surge in liquidity, according to BarChart, reflects rising stress beneath record global liquidity levels. The December 30 operation was slightly smaller in scale than emergency pandemic-era measures. Financial commentator Andrew Lockett expressed concern, noting that such a large injection suggests 'everything is fine' only on the surface. He compared the situation to banks holding assets they don't fully control, arguing institutions now require cash to cover obligations tied to commodity positions and collateral mismatches. The Fed's overnight repo facility allows qualified counterparties to exchange Treasury bonds for cash at a fixed rate, enabling the central bank to maintain control over short-term interest rates. While the Fed typically uses such operations near quarter and year-end, the $40.32 billion total for December stands out. Bluekurtic Market Insights described the activity as 'ongoing liquidity support,' highlighting sustained demand throughout the month. The prevailing view is that the increase reflects year-end balance sheet constraints rather than an acute crisis. Banks face stricter regulatory requirements during reporting periods, often reducing their willingness to lend in repo markets. When this occurs, institutions turn to the Fed for support. However, persistent reliance on central bank facilities is often interpreted as a sign of underlying stress or risk aversion among counterparties. Beyond the repo market, attention turned to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes. Analysts from Markets & Mayhem highlighted a key takeaway: the Fed's alleged 'non-quantitative easing' program could involve purchasing up to $220 billion in Treasury bonds over the next 12 months to ensure sufficient reserves in the banking system. Policymakers emphasized these purchases are intended solely for price control and liquidity management, not as a signal of monetary easing. Higher interest rates for a longer period are clashing with record global liquidity, yet Bitcoin's price has not reacted strongly. FOMC minutes revealed a cautious policy outlook, with most participants indicating further rate cuts would only be appropriate if inflation continues to decline as expected. Many warned that premature cuts could entrench inflation or undermine the Fed's credibility. As a result, markets pushed expectations for the next rate cut to at least March 2026, reinforcing the 'higher for longer' narrative despite expanding liquidity. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut remains low. Simultaneously, global liquidity reached a new record high, with data from Alpha Extract showing a rise of approximately $490 billion. This support stems from improving tailwinds, financial flows resembling hidden quantitative easing, and coordinated settlements across major economies. Experts in digital assets argue that 'global liquidity is accelerating' and that Bitcoin will follow. Historically, expansions in global liquidity have correlated with strong performance in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, the market response has been muted so far. Bitcoin continues trading in a narrow range between approximately $85,000 and $90,000, with low volume and low volatility. This disconnect may reflect the complexity of the current cycle, where abundant liquidity clashes with constrained policy rates, regulatory uncertainty, and lingering caution after a volatile year. Is the December liquidity surge a turning point? The Fed is quietly adding support under the financial system, despite insisting this does not signal easing. Nevertheless, the momentum of liquidity growth may be more significant than the terminology used to describe it.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 08:10 AM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Arabic](https://ar.beincrypto.com/fed-liquidity-injection-global-record-2025/)\n\n**Fed Survey: Central Bank's Repo Purchases Expected to Exceed $200 Billion in Next 12 Months**\nAccording to a survey by the Federal Reserve, respondents expect the central bank's total repurchase agreement purchases over the next 12 months\u2014part of measures to alleviate pressure in the money market\u2014to exceed $200 billion.

This follows about US$38 billion injected over the past 10 days as part of year-end liquidity management. Although Fed officials describe the move as routine, cryptocurrency investors view it as a bullish signal for risk assets. Repo operations involve The Fed lending cash to banks using high-quality collateral\u2014typically U.S. Treasury securities\u2014reversed within a day, aiming to maintain market liquidity, prevent spikes in short-term interest rates, and reduce pressure in capital markets. The December 22 operation, capped at US$6.801 billion, is notable as the first new liquidity injection repo since 2020, distinct from the permanent overnight repo facility established in 2021. On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced a shift to a full allotment framework, eliminating aggregate transaction limits and allowing individual bids up to US$40 billion, enhancing flexibility in managing interest rates and liquidity. Unlike quantitative easing (QE), which permanently increases the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, repo operations are temporary and self-correcting, with funds returned after the agreement ends. Analysts emphasize this distinction: the move reflects tight liquidity conditions, not a policy shift toward easing. The Fed also announced Reserve Management Purchases starting December 11, 2025, totaling approximately US$40 billion in Treasury securities, to ensure sufficient system reserves and meet seasonal liquidity demands. Despite being labeled routine, crypto investors interpret the influx positively, linking increased liquidity to favorable conditions for risk assets. Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have rallied during periods of central bank liquidity support. Analysts like TheMoneyApe note that more money in the system means easier financing, reduced stress, and better conditions for assets like BTC. While speculation exists about potential QE in early 2026, The Fed has not signaled such a move; it remains focused on maintaining tight policy to bring inflation back to its 2% target. The coming weeks will determine whether this December operation is a one-off or the start of sustained liquidity support. Market watchers will monitor Fed communications and data for clues on future policy direction in 2025. For now, the December operation demonstrates the central bank\u2019s readiness to address short-term market pressures without altering its broader monetary policy stance.\nOriginal language: id\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Indonesia](https://id.beincrypto.com/the-fed-repo-injeksi-pertama-sejak-2020/)\n\n**Federal Reserve to Inject $6.8 Billion in December 2025\u2014Why Crypto Markets Are Watching**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is set to inject approximately $6.8 billion into financial markets on December 22, 2025, through repurchase agreements (repos), marking the first such liquidity operation since 2020. This move is part of a broader effort to manage year-end liquidity pressures, with around $38 billion allocated over the past ten days. The Federal Reserve describes these actions as routine, but cryptocurrency investors view them as positive signals for risk assets. Repurchase agreements involve the Fed lending money to banks in exchange for high-quality collateral, typically Treasury securities, with repayment typically occurring within one day. These operations help maintain adequate market liquidity, prevent short-term interest rates from rising, and reduce stress in capital markets. Data from the Federal Reserve shows the daily average volume of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) reached $2.7 trillion in 2025, with over $1 trillion executed via repo operations, highlighting their critical role in market stability. The December 22 operation, capped at $6.801 billion, is notable as the first post-2020 repo injection, distinguishing it from the permanent repo facility established in 2021. On December 10, 2025, the New York Fed announced significant changes to overnight repo operations, removing aggregate transaction limits and shifting to a full allotment framework with a maximum bid of $40 billion per proposal, enhancing the Fed\u2019s flexibility in managing interest rates and liquidity conditions. Unlike quantitative easing\u2014where the Fed permanently purchases assets and expands its balance sheet\u2014repo operations are temporary and self-correcting, with funds fully repaid. Analyst ImNotTheWolf emphasized: 'This is not quantitative easing, nor money printing, nor a signal of easing policy because the money is repaid. But yes, it shows liquidity is still somewhat tight.' While these operations are technically non-monetary policy shifts, the increased demand for borrowing by banks suggests tighter liquidity conditions. Year-end pressures, including regulatory reserve requirements and balance sheet management, typically drive higher short-term financing costs and greater repo usage. The Fed also announced $40 billion in Treasury purchases starting December 11, 2025, to maintain adequate reserve levels and meet seasonal liquidity needs, reflecting a multi-pronged end-of-year strategy. Despite the routine framing, cryptocurrency markets reacted positively, as increased liquidity often supports riskier assets. Analyst TheMoneyApe stated: 'More money in the system means easier financing, less pressure, and better conditions for risky assets like $BTC and cryptocurrencies.' Some analysts speculate about potential quantitative easing in early 2026, though the Fed has not indicated such a shift. Currently, the Fed remains focused on maintaining a restrictive policy while working to bring inflation back to its 2% target. The coming weeks will reveal whether these December operations are isolated year-end measures or signs of more sustained liquidity support. Market watchers will closely monitor communications and data for signs of future policy direction in 2025. For now, the December repo actions indicate the central bank\u2019s readiness to address financing market pressures while keeping its broader monetary policy stable.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Arabic](https://ar.beincrypto.com/fed-repo-first-injection-since-2020/)\n\n**Investors expect relief in money markets as Fed resumes T-bill purchases By Reuters**\nThe Federal Reserve announced it will resume expanding its balance sheet by purchasing Treasury bills starting December 12, 2025, with an initial $40 billion in short-dated government bonds. This move aims to alleviate persistent liquidity strains in the U.S. overnight repurchase (repo) market, where borrowing rates\u2014measured by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\u2014have surged despite the Fed\u2019s earlier halt to quantitative tightening (QT). The repo market, valued at approximately $4 trillion, has seen elevated rates due to factors including increased Treasury bill issuance and a temporary buildup in the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) during the government shutdown, which drained reserves from the banking system. Analysts, including Robert Tipp of PGIM Fixed Income, noted that a growing balance sheet is necessary to support market arbitrage and maintain liquidity. Stephen Douglass of NISA Investment Advisors stated the Fed\u2019s decision to act now\u2014before the end of the year\u2014was driven by ongoing repo market pressure even after QT officially ended on December 1, 2025. The move is expected to reduce the risk of funding stress or repo market dysfunction ahead of the typically volatile year-end period. According to Investing.com, the decision was made earlier than many analysts anticipated, who had expected a pivot toward asset purchases in early 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/investors-expect-relief-in-money-markets-as-fed-resumes-tbill-purchases-4402049)\n\n**Fed to Pause Balance Sheet Reduction, Begin Bond Purchases in March to Stabilize Markets \u2013 BCA Research**\nBCA Research forecasts that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its balance sheet stable from next month through March 2026, after which it will begin increasing its holdings of government bonds via Reserve Management Purchases\u2014buying Treasury securities to manage liquidity and stabilize the banking system. This shift follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s announcement on December 1, 2025, that the era of balance sheet reduction has ended, with assets to remain flat until reserves transition from 'abundant' to 'ample.' BCA analysts Ryan Swift and Robert Timper estimate that monthly Treasury purchases will total $16.4 billion starting in March, necessary to stabilize the combination of bank reserves and overnight repurchase agreement (repo) balances. The Fed\u2019s repo operations typically remove liquidity from the banking system. The size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is closely monitored as it directly influences the supply of bank reserves and supports the Fed\u2019s ability to control interest rates within its target range. The analysts note that recent spikes in overnight interest rates\u2014particularly a temporary breach of the Fed\u2019s target band in October 2025\u2014prompted the reversal, echoing concerns from the 2019 liquidity shortage. Although current market conditions are not yet an emergency, BCA states the Fed is acting with 'great prudence and foresight' in responding to early signs of monetary market stress.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/economy/les-tensions-du-marche-monetaire-sont-emergentes-mais-pas-encore-une-urgence--bca-research-3152297)\n\n**Federal Reserve allegedly pumped $29.4B into US banking system. That's not the actual total**\nOn October 31, 2025, the Federal Reserve conducted $50.35 billion in overnight repo agreements, injecting funds into the U.S. banking system, which was misrepresented in social media posts claiming a $29.4 billion injection. The $29.4 billion figure reflects only Treasury securities purchased in repo operations, while the full amount included agency and mortgage-backed securities. On the same day, the Fed also conducted $51.80 billion in reverse repo operations, removing more money from the system than it injected, resulting in a net outflow of $1.45 billion. Although the repo injection was the largest since 2020 and the biggest since the creation of the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility in 2021, it was smaller than operations in 2019 and 2020. Reverse repo operations on that day were relatively small compared to the trillions seen between 2022 and 2023. The Federal Reserve emphasized that such operations are routine tools to ensure short-term market stability, not signs of crisis. Lorie Logan, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, encouraged banks to use the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility more often. The Fed also announced it would halt its asset reduction efforts starting December 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/federal-reserve-injecting-money-banking-system/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nThe evidence indicates that **the Federal Reserve has not restarted overnight Treasury repo operations in 2026 after a period of zero usage**. Instead, the restart occurred in late 2025, with operations continuing into 2026 as part of ongoing liquidity management. Here's the full context:\n\n1. **Restart occurred in late 2025, not 2026**: \n   - The Fed injected $40.32 billion via overnight repurchase agreements (repos) in December 2025 [11][13][15]. This was specifically noted as the second-largest liquidity operation since the COVID-19 pandemic and the first significant restart after minimal usage since 2020 [17][18].\n   - On December 22, 2025, the Fed executed a $6.8 billion repo transaction - its first liquidity-increasing operation of this type since 2020 [17][18].\n\n2. **2026 operations represent continuation, not restart**:\n   - News analysis throughout January-February 2026 [1][3][6][7] describes repo operations as part of the Fed's ongoing \"ample reserves\" framework, not as a new initiative.\n   - The Fed's standing repo facility remains operational in 2026 as a standard liquidity tool, with no indications of a \"restart\" event in this year [1][6].\n\n3. **Context for reduced usage**:\n   - The \"years of zero usage\" likely refers to 2021-2024, when the Fed's reverse repo facility peaked at $2.5 trillion (March 2021) then declined, with minimal repo operations occurring until late 2025 [10][13].\n   - This reduction phase ended due to year-end liquidity pressures and changes in banking regulations that increased demand for short-term funding [11][17].\n\n4. **Current status and purpose**:\n   - As of February 2026, the Fed continues using repos to manage short-term interest rates and address banking system liquidity needs, particularly around regulatory reporting periods [1][6][11].\n   - The Fed emphasizes these are routine operations distinct from quantitative easing, focusing on liquidity maintenance rather than monetary stimulus [17][19].\n\n5. **Limitations**: No reports were found of a complete cessation followed by a 2026-specific restart. The available information suggests a continuous operational framework since late 2025.\n\nIn summary: While overnight Treasury repo operations are active in February 2026, they resumed in late 2025 after reduced usage during 2021-2024. The evidence doesn't support a distinct restart event in 2026 itself.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
