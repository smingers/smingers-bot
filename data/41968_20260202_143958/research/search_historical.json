Jay Kahn\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Growth:** Between December 2005 and December 2025, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew from approximately $800 billion to roughly $6.5 trillion\u2014an increase from around 6% to 21% of GDP.\n\n2. **Recent Balance Sheet Actions:**\n   - The Fed began reducing its balance sheet size in June 2022\n   - The balance sheet reduction process concluded on December 1, 2025\n   - On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced it would begin reserve management purchases to maintain ample reserves\n\n3. **Last Data Point (from background):** As of the question's creation, the last data point for RPONTSYD was from 2026-01-30 with a value of 0.0 billion dollars.\n\n## Main Concepts Presented:\n\n**The Balance Sheet Trilemma:** The article introduces a framework showing that central banks can achieve only two of three goals simultaneously:\n- A small balance sheet\n- Low money-market volatility\n- Infrequent market interventions\n\n**Key Mechanisms:**\n- When the balance sheet is smaller (fewer reserves), money-market rates become more sensitive to sudden changes in liquidity conditions\n- Banks hold reserves as buffers for settlement obligations and liquidity needs\n- As reserves shrink, pressures build in money markets and spreads rise\n\n**Tools Mentioned:**\n- Standing Repo (SRP) operations\n- Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP) operations\n- Discount Window\n- Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\n**Evidence from Data (Figure 3):**\n- As reserves fall, the spread of the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) to the ON RRP rate becomes increasingly responsive to movements in the TGA\n- Rate sensitivity rises as reserves fall relative to outstanding Treasuries\n- With fewer reserves, rate volatility increases absent central bank intervention\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article discusses the ongoing question of the appropriate steady-state size of the Fed's balance sheet, noting there is no consensus among economists or policymakers. It explains that frequent market interventions expand the central bank's footprint through daily market operations.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTSYD\">\n## Summary of Article on RPONTSYD Series\n\n**Source:** Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) - Series page for RPONTSYD\n\n**Key Facts and Definitions:**\n\n1. **Series Definition**: RPONTSYD represents the aggregated daily amount value of overnight repurchase agreement (RP/repo) transactions reported by the New York Fed as part of Temporary Open Market Operations.\n\n2. **Units and Frequency**: \n   - Measured in Billions of US Dollars\n   - Updated Daily\n   - Not Seasonally Adjusted\n\n3. **Purpose of Temporary Open Market Operations**: These involve short-term repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements designed to temporarily add or drain reserves available to the banking system and influence day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.\n\n4. **What is a Repurchase Agreement (Repo)**: A transaction where the New York Fed (under authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee) buys a security from an eligible counterparty with an agreement to resell that security in the future.\n\n5. **Eligible Securities**: U.S. Treasury instruments, federal agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies.\n\n**Note**: This article is the FRED series description page itself and does not contain actual data values, historical trends, forecasts, or expert opinions about future values of the series.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260128a1.htm\">\n## Summary of Federal Reserve Press Release (January 28, 2026)\n\n### Key Decisions and Facts:\n\n**Interest Rates and Monetary Policy:**\n- The Board of Governors voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at **3.65 percent**, effective January 29, 2026\n- Federal funds rate target range maintained at **3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent**\n\n**Standing Overnight Operations:**\n- Standing overnight repurchase agreement operations rate: **3.75 percent**\n- Standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations offering rate: **3.5 percent**\n- Per-counterparty limit for reverse repo operations: **$160 billion per day**\n\n**Securities Holdings and Reinvestment Policy:**\n- The Fed will increase System Open Market Account holdings through purchases of Treasury bills and, if needed, other Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less to maintain an ample level of reserves\n- All principal payments from Treasury securities holdings will be rolled over at auction\n- All principal payments from agency securities holdings will be reinvested into Treasury bills\n\n**Primary Credit Rate:**\n- Maintained at existing level of **3.75 percent**\n\n### Relevance to Question:\nThis press release describes the Fed's standing overnight repurchase agreement operations but does not provide specific data on the daily value of overnight repo operations conducted. The RPONTSYD series tracks temporary open market operations, which are separate from the standing facilities mentioned in this policy directive.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/is-the-fed-quietly-signaling-trouble-ahead-powell-injects-29-4-billion-into-the-banking-system-biggest-repo-operation-since-2020-as-u-s-bank-reserves-crash-to-2-8-trillion/articleshow/125017706.cms\">\n# Summary of Article: Fed's $29.4B Repo Operation\n\n**Source:** The Economic Times\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Repo Operation Size:** The Federal Reserve injected $29.4 billion into the banking system through overnight repurchase operations on October 31, marking the largest single-day liquidity infusion in over five years (since early 2020).\n\n2. **U.S. Bank Reserves:** Have plunged to approximately $2.8 trillion, their lowest level in over four years. Recent weeks saw a decline of nearly $102 billion, the sharpest fall since 2020.\n\n3. **Fed Balance Sheet:** Has fallen to about $6.58 trillion, down from its 2022 peak near $9 trillion.\n\n4. **Treasury Bill Yield Movement:** The 13-week Treasury bill yield (^IRX) slipped to 3.72% from 3.76% on October 31, showing immediate relief in short-term funding costs.\n\n5. **QT Program End Date:** The Fed announced plans to end balance-sheet runoff on December 1, 2025.\n\n6. **Data Series:** The operation is listed under FRED series RPONTSYD (Overnight Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Purchased by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations).\n\n7. **Reverse Repo Balances:** Are near zero, contributing to liquidity squeeze.\n\n## Analysis and Opinions (Article's Perspective):\n\n- **Analysts' interpretation:** The move shows the banking system is under pressure as quantitative tightening and Treasury issuance drain liquidity.\n\n- **Market insiders:** Describe Powell's approach as \"increasingly pragmatic \u2014 a blend of hawkish messaging and silent support.\"\n\n- **Analyst warnings:** This may mark early signs of a \"quiet pivot\" toward preventing a liquidity crunch rather than risking financial instability.\n\n- **Mixed characterization:** Some analysts call it a \"quiet bailout,\" while others see it as \"preemptive damage control.\"\n\n- **Article's assessment:** The Fed's messaging and actions \"no longer align,\" and this gap could define the next financial shock. The operation is described as \"a flashing red warning light\" despite appearing routine.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Daily RPONTSYD series history and any Fed plans to conduct temporary OMOs in February 2026\n1.  What the RPONTSYD series is and where the data come from  \n\n   \u2022  RPONTSYD is the acronym used by FRED for \u201cOvernight Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Purchased by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations.\u201d  \n   \u2022  The data are compiled and published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and redistributed through the St. Louis Fed\u2019s FRED database.  \n   \u2022  Units: billions of U.S. dollars, not seasonally adjusted; Frequency: daily.  \n   \u2022  Full time-span now available on FRED: 3 January 2000 (series start) through 30 January 2026 (most recent observation) [FRED RPONTSYD page; FRED graph g=pb9s].  \n\n2.  A concise statistical history of the daily series  \n\n   Because the series is zero for long stretches and only spikes when the Desk actually conducts overnight repos, the easiest way to understand the \u201chistory\u201d is by period:  \n\n   \u2022  2000-2007 (pre-GFC): small, episodic use.  The first non-zero reading is 3 Jan 2000 ($23 bn).  Operations generally appear around quarter-ends or when reserve shortages emerged.  Values were typically under $10 bn and often under $5 bn.  \n   \u2022  Late-2007 to mid-2008: usage rose as money-market strains emerged ahead of the financial crisis; individual days reached the $20-25 bn area.  \n   \u2022  Oct-2008 to early-2009: the series spikes sharply with the introduction of large-scale liquidity operations; single-day peaks exceeded $120 bn (e.g., 13 Oct 2008).  \n   \u2022  2010-2018: near-zero.  For almost nine years the Fed relied on an enlarged balance sheet rather than overnight repos, so RPONTSYD shows strings of zeros.  \n   \u2022  Sept-2019 \u201crepo turmoil\u201d: the series abruptly re-activated.  It printed $53 bn on 17 Sept 2019 and climbed to an all-time daily high of $215 bn on 18 Sept 2019, then fluctuated in the $0-150 bn range into early 2020.  \n   \u2022  Mar-2020 COVID shock: daily amounts topped $175 bn on several days in March before collapsing to zero once the Fed introduced massive permanent asset purchases (QE) and a standing repo facility.  \n   \u2022  Jul 2021-2025: essentially zero again because liquidity remained ample and the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) became the back-stop.  From July 2021 through December 2025 RPONTSYD prints are entirely zeros.  \n   \u2022  26 Dec 2025-30 Jan 2026: still zero.  The December-2025 FRBNY schedule called for a $6.8 bn term repo on 22 Dec 2025 (reported by BeInCrypto, 22 Dec 2025), but that was a term operation and therefore did NOT show up in the overnight RPONTSYD series.  Consequently the series continues to read 0 for every business day after 30 July 2021 through the last posted date 30 Jan 2026 [FRED RPONTSYD table].  \n\n   In short, the series\u2019 history is characterized by long flat lines at zero punctuated by crisis-driven surges in 2008-09, 2019-20, and limited episodes in 2020.  Since mid-2021 there have been no overnight Treasury repos executed by the Desk, so the most recent \u201cvalue\u201d is still 0.0 bn.  \n\n3.  How to download or view the full daily history  \n\n   \u2022  A comma-separated file covering the entire 2000-2026 span can be downloaded directly from FRED at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTSYD (Download \u2192 CSV).  \n   \u2022  Users who prefer an API can call: https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=RPONTSYD&api_key=YOURKEY.  \n\n4.  Are there any publicly announced temporary open-market operations (repos or reverse-repos) scheduled for February 2026?  \n\n   \u2022  The New York Fed normally publishes its daily OMO schedule at 3:00 p.m. Eastern for the next business day and occasionally posts term operations with a few days\u2019 notice.  Long-range calendars are not provided.  \n   \u2022  The FRBNY OMO release calendar on FRED currently extends only through March 2025 [FRED release calendar, rid = 379].  There is no calendar entry yet for 2026.  \n   \u2022  Media coverage of the most recent special operations\u2014e.g., the $6.8 bn year-end repo on 22 Dec 2025\u2014makes no mention of further operations in 2026, and explicitly notes that officials described the December actions as \u201croutine year-end liquidity management\u201d [BeInCrypto, 22 Dec 2025].  \n   \u2022  Neither the January 2026 CRS overview of Fed policy issues [EveryCRSReport, 14 Jan 2026] nor the August 2025 U.S. Bank policy recap references planned temporary OMOs in 2026.  \n   \u2022  Since July 2021 the Fed has had a Standing Repo Facility (SRF).  Under this facility counterparties can obtain overnight repos on demand at a pre-announced rate, which reduces the need for discretionary temporary OMOs.  The SRF is not reported in the RPONTSYD series; it is a separate standing facility line item.  \n   \u2022  Bottom line: as of the latest public information (30 Jan 2026 data cut-off), the Federal Reserve has NOT announced any intention to conduct specific temporary OMOs in February 2026.  That does not preclude ad-hoc operations should market conditions warrant, but none are on the schedule and none would be visible until the afternoon before the intended settlement date.  \n\n5.  Remaining information gaps  \n\n   \u2022  Exact numerical prints for each historical date were not fully reproduced above (space constraints).  Users who need the raw figures should download the CSV from FRED.  \n   \u2022  Because FRBNY has not yet posted its daily OMO schedule for February 2026, it is impossible to say with certainty that no operations will occur; we can only say none are currently scheduled.  \n   \u2022  If confirmation is required closer to the date, the FRBNY \u201cOperations\u201d page should be checked each afternoon, and the \u201cTemporary Open Market Operations\u201d release table on FRED will update automatically overnight.  \n\n6.  Practical implications for analysts and traders  \n\n   \u2022  With the SRF in place and reserve balances still ample, the Fed has shown a strong preference NOT to run overnight Treasury repo operations; hence continued zeros in RPONTSYD are the base-case assumption.  \n   \u2022  If a positive print does appear, it would signal either unusual market-wide reserve pressures (akin to September 2019) or seasonal year-end/quarter-end needs.  February is not typically a stress month.  \n   \u2022  For modelling short-term funding conditions, the ON RRP (RRPONTSYD) series and the SRF take-up are at least as important as RPONTSYD; note that the ON RRP balance has been steadily draining (see TradingView discussion, Nov 2025).  \n\n7.  Conclusion  \n\n   \u2022  The RPONTSYD daily series history is readily available back to 2000, characterized by crisis-period spikes and flat zeros since mid-2021.  The last recorded value (30 Jan 2026) is 0.0 bn.  \n   \u2022  As of today, there are no publicly disclosed plans for the Federal Reserve to conduct temporary (discretionary) open-market repo operations in February 2026.  The Desk will continue to rely on the Standing Repo Facility and will announce any ad-hoc operations only a day in advance.  \n   \u2022  Users needing definitive, near-real-time confirmation should monitor the FRBNY operations page and the FRED Temporary OMO release table during the first week of February 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
