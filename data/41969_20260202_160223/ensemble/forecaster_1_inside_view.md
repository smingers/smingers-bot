- **Historical beat rate: 3 of last 4 quarters, average 3.75% surprise**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Earnings Catalyst Timing (Multiple sources confirm)**
   - Feb 4 earnings (day 2 of forecast period) is the dominant factor
   - Q3 2025 beat drove +8% single-day gain
   - 75% historical beat rate with positive surprise pattern
   - Causal mechanism: Clear aligner volumes growing in EMEA/APAC, new product launches (iTero Lumina, ClinCheck Live)
   - Weight: This is the primary driver for the 13-day period

2. **Recent Price Momentum (Factual data)**
   - Stock at $163.27 on Feb 1, up from $156.03 on Jan 1 (+4.6% in one month)
   - This represents positive technical setup heading into earnings
   - Weight: Moderate-to-strong, suggests market positioning for positive outcome

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

3. **Institutional Positioning (Sequoia Fund letter, Feb 2)**
   - Credible institutional investor (Ruane Cunniff LP) initiated position Q4 2025
   - Entry at "low-to-mid-teens multiple" suggests value thesis
   - However: Entry was likely at lower prices ($135-150 range based on Q4 timing)
   - Weight: Moderate positive signal but timing unclear

4. **Analyst Sentiment Mixed-to-Positive**
   - Consensus "Moderate Buy" with 11 buy, 6 hold, 1 sell (from Nov 2025 data)
   - Average target $176.70 (8% above current $163)
   - But: Wide range ($140-$205) indicates uncertainty
   - Weight: Moderate, directionally positive but not decisive

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

5. **Keybank Stake Reduction (Q3 2025)**
   - One institution reducing by 12.2% in Q3 2025
   - This is 3+ months old and likely unrelated to Feb 2-15 outlook
   - Weight: Minimal to none

6. **Market Share Concerns (Sequoia letter)**
   - Acknowledges competition and patent expirations
   - But: Sequoia still invested, believing in long-term leadership
   - Weight: Weak, more relevant to long-term than 13-day period

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 13 calendar days (Feb 2-15, 2026), approximately 9-10 trading days

**Critical Event Distribution:**
- Day 2 (Feb 4): Q4 2025 earnings after close
- Days 3-13: Post-earnings price action and consolidation

**If Timeframe Halved (6-7 days, ending Feb 8-9):**
- Would increase probability to ~72-75%
- Rationale: Less time for post-earnings profit-taking or reversal
- Immediate post-earnings momentum typically strongest in first 2-3 days

**If Timeframe Doubled (26 days, ending ~Feb 28):**
- Would decrease probability to ~60-63%
- Rationale: More time for:
  - Market rotation/profit-taking
  - New negative catalysts to emerge
  - Mean reversion after earnings pop
  - Broader market volatility to impact stock

**Volatility Consideration:**
- ALGN beta of 1.84 means high sensitivity to market moves
- 13-day period is long enough for significant reversals but short enough that earnings catalyst should dominate

## (d) Justification

**Factors Shifting Probability HIGHER from 68% base:**

1. **Confirmed Positive Momentum (Strong Evidence)**
   - Stock already up 4.6% in January, entering earnings with technical strength
   - This suggests market positioning for positive outcome
   - Shift: +3-5 percentage points

2. **Early Catalyst Timing (Strong Evidence)**
   - Earnings on day 2 means 11 trading days for gains to hold
   - Historical pattern: Q3 beat held gains through subsequent weeks
   - Shift: Already embedded in base rate

**Factors Shifting Probability LOWER from 68% base:**

1. **Recent Price Appreciation May Be Priced In (Moderate Evidence)**
   - At $163, stock has recovered significantly from $156 start of year
   - Some positive expectations may already be reflected
   - Shift: -2-3 percentage points

2. **Elevated Volatility Risk (Moderate Evidence)**
   - Beta 1.84 means any market selloff amplified
   - 13 days allows time for profit-taking even after beat
   - Shift: -2-3 percentage points

3. **Wide Analyst Uncertainty (Weak-to-Moderate Evidence)**
   - Target range $140-$205 shows significant disagreement
   - While consensus is positive, downside scenarios exist
   - Shift: -1-2 percentage points

**Net Adjustment from 68% Base:**
- Positive momentum: +3-4%
- Priced-in risk: -2-3%
- Volatility/time risk: -2-3%
- Analyst uncertainty: -1-2%

**Net: -2 to -4 percentage points**

**Key Structural Consideration:**
The Sequoia Fund letter (Feb 2, 2026) provides important context: a sophisticated institutional investor initiated a position in Q4 2025 despite acknowledging "market share loss inevitable." This suggests the market has already digested competitive concerns, and the focus is now on execution. This is a moderately positive signal but doesn't dramatically alter the earnings-driven probability.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base of 68%, adjusting for:

1. **Recent momentum is real but partially priced in**: The 4.6% January gain suggests positive positioning, but also means less room for surprise. Net effect: -1%

2. **Earnings catalyst remains dominant**: With 75% beat rate and average 3.75% surprise, the Feb 4 event is the overwhelming driver. Historical Q3 pattern (+8% on beat) suggests strong upside potential. No adjustment needed (already in base).

3. **Time risk is meaningful**: 11 trading days post-earnings is enough for profit-taking or reversal, especially with beta of 1.84. Adjustment: -2%

4. **Institutional confidence is positive**: Sequoia Fund entry provides credible validation of value proposition at similar/lower prices. Adjustment: +1%

**Calibrated Probability: 68% - 1% - 2% + 1% = 66%**

**Sanity Check:**
- 66% implies roughly 2:1 odds that ALGN closes above $163.03 on Feb 15
- This assumes ~70-75% chance of earnings beat, with ~85-90% conditional probability that a beat holds through Feb 15
- Conversely, ~34% chance reflects: (a) earnings miss/meet (25%), or (b) earnings beat but subsequent selloff (9%)
- This feels appropriately calibrated given high volatility and 13-day window

**Final Adjustment for Overconfidence:**
Given the binary nature of the earnings catalyst and my tendency to anchor on positive momentum, I should consider whether 66% is too confident. However, the evidence is genuinely strong:
- Confirmed earnings date (not speculation)
- Strong historical beat pattern (factual)
- Positive recent momentum (factual)
- Credible institutional validation (factual)

The main uncertainty is post-earnings price action over 11 days, which justifies keeping probability in the 60-70% range rather than pushing higher.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will ALGN close above $163.03 on Feb 15, 2026 (13 days from Feb 2)?

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view base of 68% was derived from 75% earnings beat rate and typical post-earnings patterns. Current prediction of 66% is closely aligned, with small adjustments for momentum already priced in and time risk.

3. **Consistency check**: "66 out of 100 times, ALGN closes above $163.03 on Feb 15, 2026." This aligns with my justification that earnings will likely beat (70-75% chance) and gains will mostly hold (85-90% conditional), offset by volatility risk.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Q4 earnings on Feb 4 with 75% historical beat rate (STRONG, factual)
   - Recent +4.6% momentum in January 2026 (STRONG, factual)
   - Q3 2025 beat drove +8% gain that held (MODERATE, historical pattern)
   - Sequoia Fund initiated position Q4 2025 at similar valuations (MODERATE, expert action)
   - Beta 1.84 creates two-way volatility risk over 11 post-earnings days (MODERATE, factual)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Earnings beat expectations but management provides weak 2026 guidance citing tariff impacts or ASP pressure, causing immediate selloff of 5-10% that persists through Feb 15. This would make the forecast look overly optimistic. Probability of this scenario: ~15-20%, which is embedded in my 34% "No" outcome.

6. **Status quo consideration**: Current price $163.27 is the reference point. Status quo (no change) would result in "Yes" outcome. However, with earnings catalyst on day 2, status quo is unlikely—expect either meaningful up or down move. The 13-day window allows some mean reversion, which I've accounted for with -2% time risk adjustment.

Probability: 66%
