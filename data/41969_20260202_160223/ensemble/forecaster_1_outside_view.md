## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 13 calendar days (Feb 2, 2026 to Feb 15, 2026)
- Trading days: approximately 9-10 days
- Critical event: Q4 2025 earnings release on Feb 4, 2026 (after close) - only 2 days into the period

**Historical Patterns:**

1. **Recent 2-week periods (Jan 2026)**:
   - Jan 16-30, 2026: $156.03 → $163.03 (+4.5%)
   - Jan 1-15, 2026: Opened $156.03, high $172.79 (+10.7% intraday)

2. **Earnings impact patterns**:
   - Q3 2025 (Oct 30): +8% single-day move on beat
   - Historical: Beat in 3 of 4 quarters with average 3.75% surprise

3. **Volatility metrics**:
   - Beta: 1.84 (highly volatile vs market)
   - 52-week range: $122-$232 (90% spread)
   - Daily moves of 1-3% are common

4. **Status quo baseline**:
   - If no earnings event: typical 2-week drift might be ±2-5%
   - With earnings: potential for ±10-15% move

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Higher Price (Yes outcome):**

1. **Earnings catalyst timing**: The Feb 4 earnings release occurs very early in the forecast period (day 2), providing a major catalyst. With consensus expecting $1.03B revenue (+3.9% YoY) and $2.99 EPS (+22% YoY), a beat could drive significant upside.

2. **Recent beat pattern**: ALGN beat estimates in 3 of last 4 quarters, with Q3 2025 showing +8% single-day gain. The average surprise is 3.75%, suggesting positive momentum.

3. **Positive setup**: Stock has recovered from $156 to $163 in late January (+4.5%), showing upward momentum heading into earnings.

4. **Analyst positioning**: "Moderate Buy" consensus with targets of $171-$190 (5-16% above $163 close) suggests room for upside.

5. **Operational improvements**: Management targets ≥100bp margin expansion in 2026, international volume growth, and new product launches (iTero Lumina, ClinCheck Live).

**Key Factors Supporting Lower Price (No outcome):**

1. **Already elevated**: At $163, stock is up 4.4% YTD and near the middle of its recent range, potentially limiting immediate upside.

2. **Earnings risk**: Any miss or weak 2026 guidance could trigger sharp selloff. Q1 2025 showed volumes up 6.2% but revenue down 2.5%, illustrating ASP pressure risks.

3. **Structural headwinds**: ASP compression, FX headwinds, tariff uncertainty (potential 25% on Mexican imports), and slow U.S. recovery remain concerns.

4. **High volatility**: Beta of 1.84 means downside moves can be equally dramatic as upside.

5. **Mixed analyst views**: While average target is $171-190, some targets are as low as $140, and one Motley Fool analyst rated it a "sell."

**Integrated Assessment**:

The question asks about a 13-day period dominated by the Feb 4 earnings event. Historical patterns suggest:
- Base case (no earnings): ~50-55% chance of any upward movement over 2 weeks
- With positive earnings catalyst: Could add 15-20 percentage points to base probability
- With negative earnings: Could subtract 15-20 percentage points

Given:
- Strong recent momentum (+4.4% YTD)
- 75% beat rate (3 of 4 quarters)
- Positive analyst sentiment (moderate buy)
- Early timing of catalyst (leaves 11 days for gains to hold)
- High volatility (can work both ways)

The probability should be above 50% (base random walk) but account for earnings risk.

Outside view calibration:

Starting with base probabilities:
- Random 2-week movement being positive: ~50%
- Historical earnings beat rate: 75%
- When ALGN beats, typical single-day gain: 5-10%
- Days remaining after earnings for gains to hold: 11 trading days

Key calibration points:
1. The stock needs to close above $163.03 on Feb 15
2. A modest earnings beat (+5-8%) would put the stock at ~$171-175, well above the threshold
3. Even a small beat (+2-3%) would likely hold above $163.03 through Feb 15
4. A miss could drop the stock 5-10%, putting it at $147-155, below threshold

Probability tree:
- Beat estimates (75% probability) → likely above $163.03 on Feb 15 (85% conditional probability) = 64%
- Meet estimates (15% probability) → 50/50 to be above $163.03 = 7.5%
- Miss estimates (10% probability) → likely below $163.03 (20% conditional probability) = 2%

Total: 64% + 7.5% + 2% = 73.5%

However, adjusting for:
- Recent positive momentum already priced in (reduces upside)
- High volatility could cause profit-taking even after beat
- 11 days post-earnings allows for reversal

Adjusted probability: 67-70%

Outside View Prediction:
68%
