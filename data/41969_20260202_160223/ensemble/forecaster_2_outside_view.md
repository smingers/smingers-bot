## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **13-day stock price movements for ALGN specifically:**
   - Most relevant but limited historical data in sources
   - 52-week range shows high volatility: $122-$232.20 (90% range)
   - Beta of 1.84 suggests high volatility relative to market

2. **Stock price movements around earnings announcements:**
   - Highly relevant given Feb 4 earnings
   - Q3 2025: stock jumped 8% on earnings beat
   - Historical pattern: beats estimates 3 of last 4 quarters
   - This is the MOST SUITABLE reference class

3. **13-day movements for healthcare/medical device stocks:**
   - Broader but less specific
   - Would need sector volatility data not provided

**Selected Reference Class:** Stock movements around earnings announcements for ALGN, with focus on the specific timeframe spanning an earnings release.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 13 calendar days (Feb 2 to Feb 15, 2026)
- 2 trading days until earnings (Feb 4 after close)
- ~8-9 trading days post-earnings to Feb 15

**Critical Event:** Q4 2025 earnings release on Feb 4, 2026 (after market close)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Recent trend: Stock down 35% over prior year (as of Oct 30, 2025)
- 2026 YTD through Jan 30: +4.41% (positive momentum)
- Feb 1 price: $163.27 vs Jan 30: $163.03 (essentially flat)
- Recent trading range: $161-$165 (narrow, suggesting consolidation before earnings)

**Earnings Impact Pattern:**
- Q3 2025: +8% jump on earnings beat
- Company has beaten estimates 3 of last 4 quarters (75% beat rate)
- Q4 consensus: $2.99 EPS vs $2.61 in Q3 (22.5% expected growth)

## (d) Justification

The question spans a critical earnings announcement on Feb 4, making this primarily a binary bet on:
1. Whether Q4 results beat/meet/miss expectations
2. Whether guidance for 2026 is encouraging
3. Post-earnings price action through Feb 15

**Bullish Factors:**
- 75% historical beat rate suggests probable beat
- Consensus expects strong Q4: 22.5% EPS growth YoY
- 2026 YTD momentum is positive (+4.41%)
- Stock has consolidated in narrow range pre-earnings (often precedes upward move)
- Recent Q3 beat produced +8% gain
- Analyst targets ($171-$190) suggest 5-16% upside from $163 level

**Bearish Factors:**
- Longer-term downtrend: down 35% over prior year
- ASP pressure and volume-to-revenue divergence persist
- Tariff uncertainty could weigh on guidance
- Even if earnings beat, stock could sell-off if 2026 guidance disappoints
- 13-day window includes 8-9 days post-earnings where initial pop could fade

**Base Rate Consideration:**
For a stock with beta 1.84 and recent 52-week range of $122-$232, a 13-day movement could easily be ±5-10%. The Feb 2 close needs to be established first, but assuming it's near $163 (the Feb 1 level), the stock needs to be above that level on Feb 15.

Given:
- 75% earnings beat rate
- Positive YTD momentum
- Expected strong Q4 results
- Historical +8% jump on last beat
- But tempered by longer-term weakness and potential guidance concerns

A reasonable base rate for a positive 13-day return spanning an earnings beat would be in the 55-65% range for a typical stock. For ALGN with high beta and recent positive momentum into earnings, this could be adjusted upward slightly.

## Outside view calibration:

The key anchoring points:
1. Historical earnings beat rate: 75% (3 of 4 quarters)
2. Recent earnings reaction: +8% on Q3 beat
3. General probability of positive returns over 13 days for high-beta stock: ~50-52% (slightly above random)
4. Boost from earnings catalyst with positive setup: +10-15 percentage points
5. Risk of post-earnings fade over remaining 8-9 days: -5 percentage points

Starting from 50% baseline (random walk), adding:
- Earnings beat probability boost: +12%
- Positive momentum into earnings: +5%
- Risk of guidance disappointment or fade: -5%

This yields approximately 62% probability.

However, considering:
- The narrow pre-earnings range suggests market uncertainty
- Even beats can result in sell-offs if guidance disappoints
- The longer-term downtrend creates overhead resistance
- Post-earnings volatility could go either direction

A more conservative calibration around 58-60% seems appropriate.
