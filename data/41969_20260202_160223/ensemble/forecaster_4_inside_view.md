Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (salient items only – cut-off 2026-02-02)
1. MarketBeat 2026-01-28 – factual: last close $163.03, earnings set for 2026-02-04, consensus EPS 2.99. Quality: good secondary aggregator, data traceable to company/analyst releases (moderate-high).
2. Yahoo/Zacks 2026-01-29 – factual: 3-of-4 beats, avg surprise 3.75 %; unchanged Q4 EPS estimate, details on segment momentum. Opinion: cautiously bullish tone. Quality: reputable screen of consensus (moderate).
3. Intellectia.ai 2026-01-30 – factual: stock up 4.6 % on earnings-date announcement; analyst distribution 7 Buy / 4 Hold / 1 Sell; avg PT $176.70. Quality: compiles sell-side notes, reliable for rating counts (moderate).
4. Seeking Alpha 2026-02-02 – opinion from Sequoia Fund letter: long-term bullish, bought in Q4 at “low-to-mid-teens” forward P/E. Factual: confirms continuing investor interest. Quality: primary investor letter (moderate, opinion-heavy).
5. DefenseWorld 2026-02-01 – factual: Keybank trimmed 12 % but institutional ownership still 88 %. Adds no near-term directional cue. Quality: SEC-filing based (moderate).
6. Historical price data pages (CNBC, Macrotrends) – factual: 52-wk range $122–232; beta≈1.8. Quality: high for raw numbers.
Irrelevant/very low weight: crypto price feeds, AMZN articles, Alcon, ALX Oncology, etc.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to price vs 02-Feb close)
Strong:
• Scheduled earnings (02-04) – large, binary catalyst inside 10-trading-day window, historically 3/4 beats → directionally uncertain but decisive for sign.
Moderate:
• Recent gradual up-trend: price now sitting 2–3 % above 50-dma, bullish short-term momentum.
• Sell-side consensus slightly above spot (avg PT $176.7) and rating mix tilting modestly positive.
• Historical “beat” frequency 75 % with modest surprise.
Weak:
• One mid-size bank trimming stake (Keybank –12 %).
• General macro index drift (S&P +0.65 % on 01-30) – negligible directional information.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window ≈ 9–10 trading days (02-Feb close ➜ 13-Feb close, as 15-Feb is Sunday).
If halved to 5 days (stops before earnings), probability would drop toward pure drift (~51 %).
If doubled to 20 days (runs past post-earnings digestion), variance dominates further but drift regains a tiny edge; probability would converge toward ~55–56 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Outside-view base rate (high-beta stock over 10 trading days): 51 %.
Adjust upward:
+3 %   Earnings beats slightly more common than misses (60 % rough probability) and positive reactions more frequent than negative when beats occur.
+2 %   Short-term positive momentum and analyst sentiment (moderate evidence).
Adjust downward:
-1 %   “Sell-the-news” risk – stock already at 20-day high; possible pull-back even on inline results.
Net inside-view lift: +4 –1 = +3 %.  
51 % → 54 %.

Probability calibration
With the above adjustments I expect that in about 54 out of 100 comparable situations, ALGN’s close on Fri 13 Feb 2026 (effective date for 15 Feb) will exceed today’s close of roughly $163. I therefore state:

Probability: 54%

Checklist:
1. Criterion: ALGN close on 2026-02-15 (Yahoo value, likely 02-13 close) > close on 2026-02-02.  
2. Outside-view base 51 %; final still tied to it.  
3. “54 out of 100 times, price finishes higher” – consistent.  
4. Key evidence: a) earnings inside window; b) 75 % beat history; c) analyst PT > spot; d) short-term upward momentum.  
5. Blind-spot: sizeable earnings miss plus weak 2026 guidance could drop stock >10  %. Would flip outcome and make 54 % far too high.  
6. Status-quo drift small; short horizon keeps probability near 50 %.

Probability: 54%
