Analysis:
The price movement over the next two weeks will be driven almost entirely by (a) the market’s reaction to Align’s Q4-2025 results and 2026 guidance, which should be released in early-February, (b) any ensuing analyst upgrades/downgrades, and (c) broader sentiment in the med-tech/orthodontics space. Therefore the most useful articles will cover the earnings release date, management’s commentary on 2026 demand, margins, scanner/aligner unit growth, and any post-earnings analyst notes or trading-desk chatter published in late-January or the first days of February 2026. I will focus my searches on these items plus any unexpected regulatory or competitive news that could move the stock within the 13-day window.
