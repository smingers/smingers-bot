Analysis:
To judge whether ALGN’s close on 2026-02-15 will beat the 2026-02-02 close, I want an outside-view sense of: (1) how the share price has behaved around recent earnings releases and macro turns, (2) what happened in the just-reported (or imminent) Q4 2025 results and management guidance, and (3) any scheduled catalysts (e.g., investor days, conferences, broader market events) before 2026-02-15. Historical price patterns and news flow around past quarters will give an empirical base-rate, while the freshest earnings headlines and analyst commentary will illuminate immediate sentiment.
