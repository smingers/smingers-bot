(ALGN) at a low-to-mid-teens multiple of forward earnings, citing the company's long-term growth potential. Align Technology, known for its Invisalign clear aligners, has experienced stagnation since 2021 due to weak patient traffic in orthodontic markets and increased competition following key patent expirations. Despite these challenges, the firm believes Align\u2019s integrated solution, global brand strength, and practice-level support will prevent commoditization and sustain its market leadership. The investment strategy reflects a long-term, value-oriented approach rooted in exhaustive primary research and a focus on high-quality businesses at reasonable prices. The Sequoia Fund remains a concentrated, long-only equity fund investing primarily in domestic mid- and large-cap companies. The investment was made in Q4 2025, with the shareholder letter published on February 2, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:50 AM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864835-align-technology-market-share-loss-inevitable-but-will-remain-the-market-leader)\n\n**Alzchem Group Shares Drop Over 2% as Citadel Raises Short Position to 0.50% - Market Watch**\nThe Alzchem Group share price closed at 153.60 EUR, down 2.29%, on a volatile trading day. The decline gained additional significance due to a rise in short-selling activity: Citadel Advisors LLC increased its net short position from 0.47% to 0.50% on January 29, 2026. This threshold of 0.50% is considered a psychological and market-attention marker, indicating heightened visibility and potential influence on market sentiment. Citadel\u2019s move suggests a tactical, data-driven expectation of near-term weakness, possibly due to valuation, market mood, or reduced buyer aggression. The short position is highly concentrated\u2014no other hedge funds are reported above the relevant reporting threshold\u2014making Citadel\u2019s actions a dominant force in shaping market dynamics. This concentration increases sensitivity to Citadel\u2019s moves, potentially amplifying downward pressure through self-reinforcing market reactions. Short positions can trigger increased volatility, faster sell-offs, and tighter stop-loss behavior. However, they also carry risk: a sudden price rebound could force Citadel to cover positions, creating a short squeeze. Key indicators to watch include whether Citadel increases its position further, how quickly the stock recovers from declines, the speed of intraday rebounds, and broader market sentiment. The article emphasizes that the move reflects a tactical shift, not a guaranteed prediction, and warns that short positions are vulnerable to rapid reversals. The article concludes that Alzchem now operates in a more volatile, tactically driven environment influenced heavily by a single major short seller.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:47 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/analysen/Artikel-SDAX_Flop_Alzchem_Group_Aktie_faellt_ueber_2_jetzt_mischen_Shortseller-19425323)\n\n**With a trading volume of USD 49.4 k BIG-USD trades -8.12 percent lower today**\nBIG (BIG-USD) experienced a 24-hour trading decline of -8.12%, closing at USD 0.0007 per token as of 03:01 PM Central Europe on Sunday, February 1, 2026.

(NASDAQ: ALGN), highlighting the company as a high-quality business with long-term growth potential despite recent underperformance. The fund\u2019s Investor Class (ARTQX), Advisor Class (APDQX), and Institutional Class (APHQX) returned 0.97%, 0.98%, and 0.97% respectively in Q3 2025, lagging behind the Russell Midcap Value Index\u2019s 6.18% return. Align Technology reported revenue of $995.7 million in Q3 2025, a 1.7% decline from the prior quarter and a 1.8% increase year-over-year. The stock lost 28.71% over the past 52 weeks and had a one-month return of -1.05%. Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund initiated its position in Align Technology on April 4, 2025, at $150 per share, citing market turmoil following the Liberation Day tariffs as an opportunity to buy at a reasonable price. The company, known for Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners, was once a 'COVID winner' with shares exceeding $700 in 2021 but has since declined due to growth deceleration, higher consumer financing costs, and increased competition from low-end entrants. The fund acknowledges near-term growth challenges but believes Invisalign, as a premium brand trusted by orthodontists, can continue capturing market share, which remains at approximately 20% of the over 20 million annual orthodontic cases. The fund holds 48 hedge fund portfolios as of Q3 2025, down from 54 in the prior quarter. While the fund sees long-term potential, it notes that certain AI stocks offer greater upside and lower downside risk. The stock closed at $156.03 on January 2, 2026, with a market capitalization of $11.31 billion.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 12:51 PM\nSource:[InvestingChannel](https://news.investingchannel.com/article/710090/do-you-believe-in-align-technologys-algn-growth-prospects)\n\n**Align Technology Inc (ALGN) Stock Price Prediction: 2025, 2026, 2030 * Benzinga**\nAlign Technology Inc. (ALGN) faces a challenging outlook, with analysts predicting a potential decline in its stock price by 2030. The company, best known for its Invisalign clear aligners, has seen its stock fall significantly, with a 1-year return of -38% and a 2025 YTD return of -34%. As of November 26, 2025, ALGN has a market cap of $10 billion, a trailing P/E ratio of 27.02, and a forward P/E ratio of 13.00. The stock holds a consensus 'Hold' rating from 19 analysts, with an average price target of $208.65 per share\u2014ranging from a high of $343 to a low of $140. The three most recent ratings suggest a near-term average target of $168.33. The bull case highlights strong demand for pediatric and teenage aligners, market leadership in clear aligners, and revenue diversification through imaging systems. The bear case emphasizes overreliance on Invisalign (which accounts for nearly all revenue), stagnant sales growth, declining net income, and increasing competitive pressure from lower-priced alternatives that could erode margins. CoinCodex forecasts modest gains in 2025, a substantial decline in 2026, and an extremely pessimistic outlook for 2030, citing declining revenue growth from Invisalign, margin compression, and insufficient revenue diversification. Despite a lower P/E ratio and a historically lower stock price post-pandemic rally, the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects remain constrained by limited innovation and weak revenue expansion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/money/align-technology-inc-algn-stock-price-prediction)\n\n**Agree To Purchase Align Technology At $110, Earn 12.9% Annualized Using Options**\nSelling a put option on Align Technology Inc. (ALGN) at a $110 strike price offers a 12.9% annualized rate of return, but only if the stock falls 17.4% to trigger the exercise of the contract, resulting in a cost basis of $104.80 per share before commissions.
