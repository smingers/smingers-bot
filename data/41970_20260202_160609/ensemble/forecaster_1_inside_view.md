- **OPEC+ policy**: Production frozen through Q1 2026; March 3 meeting to discuss Q2 unwinding

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Bearish)**:
1. **Multiple independent institutional forecasts converge on $55-62/bbl 2026 average** (Enverus $55, BloombergNEF $55, ING $57, Rabobank $57-60, Reuters survey $62). This represents 10-18% downside from current $66 level. Direct causal mechanism: structural oversupply of 3.2-3.8M bpd.
2. **Geopolitical premium unwinding confirmed by price action**: Feb 2 drop of 5% on Iran diplomatic news demonstrates market was pricing $3-5/bbl risk premium that is now evaporating.
3. **European oil majors cutting shareholder payouts 10-25%** signals industry expects sustained low prices. Corporate actions are leading indicators.

**Moderate Evidence (Mixed)**:
1. **OPEC+ production freeze through Q1**: Provides price floor support but March 3 meeting may signal Q2 unwinding, which would add ~2.2M bpd supply.
2. **Recent price trajectory**: Pulled back from $71 to $66 in one day suggests momentum shifted bearish, but 11-day timeframe may see consolidation rather than continued slide.
3. **China reserves building**: 1,095M barrels (+26M Nov-Jan) suggests strategic buying could provide demand support around $60-65 range.

**Weak Evidence**:
1. Trading forum opinions on $59-76 scenarios lack institutional backing.
2. Short-term technical levels ($64.33 resistance, $61.36 support) are noisy over 11-day horizon.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 2 → Feb 13, 2026) = ~8 trading days

**If Halved to 5-6 days**:
- Price would likely stay tighter around current $66 level (±$2-3 range)
- Less time for macro/geopolitical news to drive major moves
- Higher probability of mean reversion to $65-67

**If Doubled to 22 days (through Feb 24)**:
- Greater drift toward fundamental value ($60-62 range per expert forecasts)
- March 3 OPEC+ meeting would be imminent, potentially driving pre-positioning
- Wider distribution: P10 might drop to $57-58, P90 could reach $74-75

**Current 11-day horizon**: Intermediate timeframe where:
- Geopolitical premium unwind can continue ($2-3 further downside)
- But OPEC+ discipline and Chinese buying provide support near $62-63
- Volatility from macro data (US jobs, inflation) could cause ±$3-4 swings

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Starting Anchor**: My outside view baseline was $65.97 (Feb 2 close) with slight bearish bias.

**Compelling Factors Shifting Prediction**:

1. **Institutional consensus significantly below current price** (Strong Evidence): Five major institutions forecast $55-62/bbl 2026 average. Even accounting for Q1 seasonality being slightly higher, this suggests current $66 is 6-10% overvalued relative to fundamentals. Over 11 days, partial convergence toward $60-64 is likely.

2. **Geopolitical premium rapidly unwinding** (Strong Evidence): The 5% single-day drop on diplomatic news, plus cancelled Iran drills, indicates $3-5/bbl premium evaporating. Further diplomatic progress could remove another $1-2/bbl over 11 days.

3. **Corporate actions confirm bearish outlook** (Strong Evidence): European majors cutting payouts 10-25% is not speculative—it's concrete evidence that industry insiders expect sustained low prices. This validates institutional forecasts.

4. **Structural oversupply backdrop** (Strong Evidence): IEA's 3.8M bpd surplus forecast (largest since 2020) creates persistent downward pressure. While 11 days is too short for full fundamental repricing, it's sufficient for market to price in higher probability of $55-60 equilibrium.

**Counterbalancing Factors**:
- OPEC+ freeze provides near-term floor around $62-63 (China's strategic buying zone)
- 11-day timeframe limits drift; mean reversion tendencies exist
- Tail risk of geopolitical flare-up (Iran tensions reignite) could spike prices back to $70-75

**Adjustment Rationale**: 
While my outside view suggested $64-68 central range, the overwhelming institutional consensus for $55-62 average, combined with concrete evidence of premium unwinding and corporate pessimism, justifies shifting the distribution lower. However, the short 11-day timeframe prevents full convergence to $55-60 fundamental range. I'm calibrating for partial adjustment: median around $63-64 (down from $66) with wider tails to account for volatility.

## Probability Calibration

**Distribution Construction**:

**Central Tendency (P40-P60)**: 
- Current $66 level likely drifts toward $62-65 range as geopolitical premium continues unwinding
- Median around $63.5 reflects partial convergence to institutional $55-62 forecasts
- P50 = $63.50 (4% below current price, halfway to fundamental value)

**Downside (P1-P20)**:
- P10 = $59.50: Rapid premium unwind + weak macro data pushes toward OPEC+ support zone
- P5 = $57.80: Tail scenario of demand shock or dollar surge
- P1 = $54.00: Extreme scenario of major bearish surprise (OPEC+ discipline breaks, recession fears)

**Upside (P80-P99)**:
- P90 = $69.80: Geopolitical flare-up (Iran tensions reignite) or supply disruption
- P95 = $72.50: Major Middle East conflict or unexpected OPEC+ cuts
- P99 = $77.00: Extreme tail (Strait of Hormuz closure, major war)

**Key Calibration Decisions**:
1. **Negative skew**: P10-P50 span ($4) is larger than P50-P90 span ($6.3) to reflect fundamental downward pressure
2. **Fat tails**: Oil markets can gap on news; P1-P10 and P90-P99 spans are wide
3. **Anchoring adjustment**: Median $63.50 vs current $66 reflects 3.8% drift toward fundamentals over 11 days (conservative given institutional forecasts suggest 10-18% undervaluation)

**Sanity Checks**:
- 80% confidence interval (P10-P90): $59.50-69.80 = $10.30 range (16% of current price) → reasonable for 11-day oil volatility
- Implied mean ≈ $64.20 (weighted toward downside due to skew)
- P50 = $63.50 aligns with partial convergence to $60-62 expert forecasts

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Brent crude oil price ($/bbl) on Feb 13, 2026 per FRED DCOILBRENTEU series
   ✓ Analysis focused on 11-day forward price trajectory from $65.97 baseline

2. **Outside view base rate**: Started with $65.97 (Feb 2 close), slight bearish bias toward $64-68 range
   ✓ Final prediction shifted lower to $63.50 median based on strong institutional evidence, but maintains connection to current price anchor

3. **Consistency check**: 
   "Implied median = $63.50; mean ≈ $64.20; makes sense given institutional $55-62 forecasts suggest current $66 is overvalued by 6-10%, and 11 days allows partial convergence"

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Five major institutions (Enverus, BNEF, ING, Rabobank, Reuters) converge on $55-62/bbl 2026 average (10-18% below current)
   - Geopolitical premium unwinding: 5% drop Feb 2 on Iran diplomatic news, cancelled drills confirm $3-5/bbl premium evaporating
   - IEA structural oversupply forecast: 3.8M bpd surplus in 2026 (largest since 2020) creates persistent downward pressure

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: 
   Major Iran-Israel military escalation or Strait of Hormuz disruption within next 11 days would spike prices to $75-85 range, making forecast look overly bearish. However, diplomatic progress trajectory and cancelled drills suggest <15% probability.
