Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Market Data:**
- **FRED/TradingView (Jan 31, 2026):** Brent closed at $67.70. High quality, authoritative source.
- **TradingEconomics (Feb 2, 2026):** Reports Brent at $65.97 after a 5% drop from $71 intraday high. Real-time, factual data.
- **Multiple news sources (Feb 2, 2026):** Confirm Brent fell 4.8-5% to $65.69-$66.37 range on diplomatic news. Consistent across sources.

**Fundamental Forecasts:**
- **Enverus (Jan 13, 2026):** Forecasts $55/bbl average for 2026. Reputable energy analytics firm, but year-average forecast has limited relevance for 11-day horizon.
- **ING THINK (Jan 22, 2026):** Forecasts $57/bbl average for 2026. Similar limitation.
- **BloombergNEF (Jan 16, 2026):** Base case $55/bbl for 2026; extreme Iran disruption scenario could push to $71/bbl Q2, $91/bbl Q4. Named analysts (Yiwen Yin, Tai Liu). The disruption scenarios are relevant but currently deemed "unlikely" by BNEF itself.
- **EIA Short-Term Outlook:** Projects $56/bbl average for 2026 based on supply surplus expectations.

**Geopolitical Context:**
- **Chronicle-Journal (Feb 2, 2026):** Details US-Iran tensions; Brent hit $71 then corrected 5% on diplomatic signals. If breakthrough: $60-65 range; if breakdown: instant reversal. Factual timeline with analyst speculation.
- **Multiple sources (Feb 2, 2026):** Trump stated Iran "seriously talking" through Qatar/Turkey intermediaries. This is the primary driver of the Feb 2 price drop. Factual reporting.
- **AskNews articles (Feb 2, 2026):** Confirm the diplomatic development and 5% price drop. European oil companies preparing for lower prices, cutting buybacks 10-25%.

**OPEC+ Production:**
- **TradingView/Astana Times (Jan 28-30, 2026):** OPEC+ extended 2.2 mb/d voluntary cuts through Q1 2026. Next meeting March 3. Iraqi compensatory cuts of 614 kbd. Factual, authoritative.

**Market Sentiment:**
- **TradingView traders (Jan 28, 2026):** Multiple opinions cite $60-82 "equilibrium range" for Brent. Anonymous trader opinions - weak evidence.
- **Rabobank (Dec 12, 2025):** Forecasts Q1 2026 at $60/bbl average. Dated but from reputable bank.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current price anchor:** Multiple independent sources confirm Brent at $65.69-$66.37 on Feb 2, down from $67.70 on Jan 31 and $71 intraday peak. This is our starting point.
2. **Fundamental oversupply:** EIA, ING, Enverus, BNEF all independently forecast 2026 averages in $55-57 range due to supply surplus of 2-3.2 mb/d. Structural bearish pressure.
3. **OPEC+ discipline:** Confirmed extension of cuts through Q1 2026 by multiple authoritative sources. Provides floor support but not enough to offset surplus.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Diplomatic de-escalation:** Trump's statement about Iran "seriously talking" caused immediate 5% drop. If talks progress, further downside to $60-65 range per analyst estimates. Single event but with demonstrated price impact.
2. **Geopolitical risk premium:** BNEF estimates only $4/bbl war premium currently priced in (vs $31-47 during Russia-Ukraine peak). Room for both upside spike if talks fail or downside if resolved.
3. **Technical levels:** Multiple sources cite support at $60-61, resistance at $70. Moderate relevance for short-term trading.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Trader opinions on $60-82 range:** Anonymous, unverified.
2. **European oil company buyback cuts:** Reflects expectations but is a lagging indicator.
3. **Gold/commodity volatility spillover:** Mentioned in one source but indirect connection to Brent fundamentals.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 11 calendar days (Feb 2 → Feb 13), approximately 8 trading days.

**Short-term dynamics (11 days):**
- Geopolitical headlines can dominate: Iran talks could progress (bearish) or collapse (bullish spike)
- Normal price volatility: ~2.3% daily × √8 ≈ 6.5% range = ±$4.3 from current $66
- No major scheduled events (OPEC+ not until March 3, no major economic data releases)
- Current momentum: Just dropped 5% on diplomatic news; technical support at $60-61

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):**
- Narrower distribution, less time for geopolitical developments
- Volatility √4 × 2.3% ≈ 4.6% = ±$3 range
- Would center closer to current $66 with tighter confidence intervals

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):**
- Wider distribution, more time for Iran talks to evolve
- Would span into early March, closer to OPEC+ meeting
- Volatility √16 × 2.3% ≈ 9.2% = ±$6 range
- Greater chance of fundamental supply/demand factors asserting themselves

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** $66/bbl (Feb 2 close)

**Bullish factors (upside risks):**
- Iran talks collapse → instant reversal of 5% drop, potential spike to $70-75
- Unexpected supply disruption (Strait of Hormuz incident, weather)
- OPEC+ signals tighter discipline ahead of March meeting

**Bearish factors (downside risks):**
- Iran diplomatic breakthrough → further decline to $60-65 range per analyst estimates
- Fundamental oversupply narrative (3+ mb/d surplus) begins to dominate
- Strong dollar reducing oil demand
- European refiners signaling weak demand expectations

**Base case adjustment:**
The outside view of $65 ± $4.5 (90% CI: $57-76) remains appropriate but I'll make minor adjustments:
- Recent 5% drop on diplomatic news suggests market is pricing out some geopolitical premium
- Multiple credible sources cite $60-65 as target if talks progress
- But talks could stall, keeping current $66 level or allowing bounce to $68-70
- 11-day window is short enough that fundamental oversupply won't fully assert itself
- Technical support at $60-61 provides near-term floor

**Distribution calibration:**
- Center slightly below current $66 at $64-65 (modest bearish tilt on diplomatic momentum)
- 10th percentile: $58 (diplomatic breakthrough + technical break below $60)
- 90th percentile: $73 (talks collapse + geopolitical spike)
- Median: $65 (status quo with slight drift lower)
- Mean: ~$65.5 (slightly pulled up by fat right tail from geopolitical risk)

Probability calibration:

The 11-day forecast window is dominated by:
1. **Geopolitical headline risk (40% weight):** Iran-US talks are the primary near-term driver. Three scenarios:
   - Progress (40% probability): Drift to $60-65 range
   - Stalemate (45% probability): Range-bound $64-68
   - Collapse (15% probability): Spike to $70-75+

2. **Technical/momentum factors (35% weight):** Just dropped 5% with support at $60-61, resistance at $70. Normal volatility suggests ±$4 range from current level.

3. **Fundamental supply/demand (25% weight):** 11 days too short for structural surplus to dominate, but analyst forecasts in $55-60 range provide gravity.

**Distribution construction:**
- P10 ($58): Requires diplomatic breakthrough + break below technical support
- P20-P40 ($61-64): Gradual drift lower on continued diplomatic progress
- P50-P60 ($65-66): Status quo, range-bound trading
- P70-P80 ($68-70): Talks stall or minor geopolitical flare-up
- P90 ($73): Talks collapse, geopolitical premium returns
- P99 ($80): Major supply disruption (Strait of Hormuz incident)

The distribution is slightly left-skewed (median < mean) reflecting the asymmetry that diplomatic progress is more likely than collapse, but collapse has larger price impact.

Checklist:
1. **Target:** Brent crude $/bbl on Feb 13, 2026 (11 days out)
2. **Base rate:** $65 ± $4.5 (outside view from volatility analysis); adjusting for diplomatic momentum
3. **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ $65, mean ≈ $65.5. Aligns with current $66 minus modest bearish drift on Iran talks progress
4. **Key evidence:** (1) Current $66 after 5% diplomatic drop, (2) Analyst $60-65 target if talks progress, (3) $70+ if talks fail, (4) Technical support $60-61, (5) Fundamental oversupply narrative
5. **Blind spot:** Major Iran-related supply disruption (Strait of Hormuz closure) would push outcome to $80-90+, making my P90 of $73 look far too conservative. Probability ~5%.
