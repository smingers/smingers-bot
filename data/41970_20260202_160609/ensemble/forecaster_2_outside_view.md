**EIA STEO (Latest edition):** Highly authoritative U.S. government source. Forecasts Brent averaging $56/bbl in 2026 (19% decline from 2025) and $54/bbl in 2027, driven by supply exceeding demand and rising inventories.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent daily volatility (Jan 2026)**
From the agent report, Brent moved from $67.68 (Jan 20) to $65.46 (Jan 22) to $68.16 (Jan 23), showing 2-3% daily swings are common. Over 11 calendar days (Feb 2-13), this suggests potential range of ±5-8% from current level.

**Reference Class 2: Short-term continuation of current trend**
Current price $65.97 (Feb 2) after 4.83% single-day drop from recent high of $69.6 (Jan 29). The drop was attributed to reduced geopolitical risk premium and commodity selloff. If correction continues, could test December lows (~$60-61).

**Reference Class 3: Seasonal patterns and institutional forecasts**
EIA forecasts $56/bbl average for 2026. Trading Economics forecasts $70.42/bbl end of Q1 2026. February 13 falls in mid-Q1. Historical pattern shows Brent declined Nov-Dec 2025 then rallied in January, suggesting volatility around fundamentals.

**Most suitable reference class:** Combination of Reference Classes 1 and 2 - short-term technical dynamics around current price level, with awareness of fundamental pressures. The 11-day forecast window is too short for seasonal patterns to dominate but long enough for news-driven volatility.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 calendar days (Feb 2-13, 2026), approximately 8 trading days.

**Recent patterns over similar periods:**
- Jan 20-31 (11 days): Range $65.46-68.16, ended at $67.70
- Jan 9-22 (11 days): Range $66.62-68.16, high volatility
- Dec 16-30 (11 days): Range $60.55-63.34, upward trend

Over 8-11 day windows in recent months, Brent has shown:
- Typical range: $3-5/bbl
- Maximum observed swing: ~$7-8/bbl
- Direction often driven by single news events (sanctions, OPEC+ meetings, geopolitical developments)

## (d) Justification

**Key factors for Feb 2-13 forecast:**

1. **Starting point:** $65.97/bbl on Feb 2, after sharp 4.83% decline from $69.6 peak
2. **Fundamental backdrop:** Bearish - EIA projects oversupply, inventories building, $56/bbl annual average
3. **OPEC+ policy:** Stable through March (no surprise changes expected before Feb 13)
4. **Geopolitical risk:** Recently declined (Iran talks), reducing upside premium
5. **Technical position:** Recent sharp drop suggests potential for consolidation or modest bounce, but fundamental headwinds limit upside
6. **Time to next major catalyst:** OPEC+ meeting was Feb 1 (just passed), next significant driver likely later in month

**Synthesis:** The 11-day window is short enough that prices likely remain in the $62-70 range established in January, but recent momentum is downward. The sharp Feb 2 drop suggests profit-taking after January rally and reassertion of bearish fundamentals. Without new bullish catalysts, expect prices to consolidate in lower $60s range, with risk skewed slightly downward toward EIA's $56 average forecast but unlikely to reach it in just 11 days.

**Range considerations:**
- Downside floor: ~$60-61 (December lows, strong technical support)
- Central tendency: $63-67 (recent consolidation zone)
- Upside cap: ~$69-70 (recent highs, would require new geopolitical shock)

Outside view calibration:

Given the 11-day forecast window and recent price action:

**10th percentile (bearish scenario):** Continued correction toward December lows, driven by further unwinding of geopolitical premium and weak demand signals. Could test $60-61 range. Setting at $61.00.

**20th percentile:** Modest continued decline without panic selling. Around $62.50.

**40th percentile (below median):** Consolidation in lower-mid $60s after recent drop. Around $64.50.

**60th percentile (above median):** Stabilization near current levels or modest recovery. Around $66.50.

**80th percentile:** Short-covering bounce or minor positive catalyst pushes back toward recent range highs. Around $68.50.

**90th percentile (bullish scenario):** Unexpected geopolitical shock or supply disruption pushes above January highs. Setting at $70.50.

This distribution reflects:
- Median around $65-66 (near current price with slight downward bias)
- Wider range than typical 11-day window to account for recent volatility
- Asymmetric distribution with more downside tail risk (fundamental bearishness)
- 80% confidence interval of $62.50-68.50 (~$6 range, consistent with recent volatility)
- 90% confidence interval of $61.00-70.50 (~$9.50 range, capturing extreme scenarios)
