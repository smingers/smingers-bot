Analysis:

1) Target / resolution criteria (paraphrase)
- Resolve to the FRED DCOILBRENTEU daily value (Dollars per Barrel) for 2026-02-13 (Brent spot price, Europe).

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says + quality)
- Chronicle-Journal (2026-02-02): Reports Brent spiked to ~71 intraday on US–Iran brinkmanship, then corrected ~5% on diplomacy headlines; close cited ~65.69. Useful for “where we are now” and the causal story (risk-premium whipsaw). Quality: medium (news-style narrative; plausible numbers but not a primary market data provider).
- AskNews aggregation of Reuters-like reporting (2026-02-02, multiple outlets in RU/UK/TR): Brent down ~4.5–6% to ~65–66 after Trump said talks are “serious”; mentions reduced fear about Hormuz drills. Quality: moderate-to-good for near-term price direction; often secondary reprints but consistent across outlets.
- ING THINK Energy Outlook (2026-01-22): Forecast Brent average ~57 in 2026; expects sizeable surplus and pressure on prices/timespreads. Quality: high (named analysts; coherent macro supply/demand framework). For a 11-day horizon, it’s context not a pinpoint predictor.
- Enverus (2026-01-13): Forecast ~55 average in 2026. Quality: high (institutional outlook). Again more “gravity” than day-ahead.
- BloombergNEF (2026-01-16): Base case average 55 in 2026; disruption scenario: if Iranian exports fully removed starting Feb, Q2 average ~71; extreme scenario could reach ~91 late-2026. Quality: high; helpful for tail risk framing (Iran disruption is a key upside tail driver).
- FT-themed item in AskNews (2026-02-02): European majors preparing for lower prices / payouts; reflects analyst expectations of weaker H1 2026 oil. Quality: moderate-to-good (sentiment/positioning evidence rather than a mechanistic forecast).
- TradingView forum compilation (2026-01-28): Technical levels and speculative scenarios ($72–76 if cuts extended; $59–52 if unwind). Quality: low-to-medium (mixed authorship; trading opinions; use mainly to sanity-check plausible technical ranges, not to anchor the median).
- Reuters survey reference (via Lenta.ru, 2026-01-30): Consensus for Brent around ~62 in 2026 (average). Quality: moderate-to-good (survey methodology; still an annual mean, not a daily print).

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (bigger shifts)
- Clear, cross-sourced near-term catalyst: de-escalation headlines (US–Iran “serious talks”) coincided with an immediate ~5% selloff to mid-65s on 2026-02-02. This strongly supports that a meaningful chunk of the January rally was geopolitical premium that can unwind quickly.
- Structural “gravity” from multiple credible outlooks (ING, Enverus, BNEF base case, EIA-like narratives in the context): 2026 expected surplus/looser balances -> downside pressure, meaning rallies are more likely to fade unless supply is actually disrupted.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- OPEC+ maintaining voluntary cuts through Q1 2026: provides a floor and slows any move down toward mid/high-50s within just 11 days.
- Market is demonstrably jumpy: recent intraday moves around 4–6% imply wider-than-normal short-horizon uncertainty bands.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- Pure technical targets/supports from trading forums: useful for “what levels traders watch” (e.g., ~59–60 support, high-60s resistance), but not reliable enough to set central tendency.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: 11 days (from 2026-02-02 to 2026-02-13), roughly 8 trading sessions.
- If halved (~5–6 days): I’d tighten the distribution around current mid-60s levels (less time for fresh macro/geopolitical shocks); median would stay near spot.
- If doubled (~22 days): I’d widen tails and slightly pull the median down (more time for surplus narrative, inventories, macro risk-off, or a breakdown/renewal of Iran talks).

5) (d) Justification (updating the provided outside view)
Outside view (given) was centered ~65–66 with a mild downside skew:
- P10 61.00, P20 62.50, P40 64.50, P60 66.50, P80 68.50, P90 70.50.

Inside-view adjustments:
- Center slightly DOWN: The key new information right at the start of the window is the sharp drop on diplomacy headlines (risk premium being repriced lower). That makes it more likely we spend time in 62–66 than pop right back to ~70 without a new provocation.
- Keep (and slightly widen) the upside tail: Iran/Hormuz risk is binary and can re-enter prices fast; BNEF’s disruption scenario supports a non-trivial right tail even if “unlikely.”
- Keep a meaningful (but not extreme) downside tail: Oversupply forecasts argue that if risk premium continues to leak out and macro risk-off persists, low-60s (even high-50s) is reachable, but OPEC+ discipline makes a crash within 11 days less likely absent a broader financial shock.

Net: modest downward shift of the median vs the outside view, with a bit more two-sided tail width.

Probability calibration

- Trend-continued case (from Feb 2): drift/consolidate in low-to-mid 60s as geopolitical premium fades → pulls P40–P70 down about 0.5–1.5 versus the outside view.
- Status quo (no major new shocks): range trading around ~63–67.
- “YES” for upside surprise: renewed Hormuz incident / talks collapse / visible supply disruption → quick move back above 70, potentially mid-70s.
- “NO” / downside surprise: broader risk-off + stronger USD + inventory builds + no new disruptions → tests 60–62; high-50s is a tail.

Checklist:
1) Variable/resolution: FRED DCOILBRENTEU value on 2026-02-13, Dollars per Barrel.
2) Outside view base rate used: (61.00, 62.50, 64.50, 66.50, 68.50, 70.50) for key percentiles (10/20/40/60/80/90).
3) Consistency check: Implied median ≈ 64.5; mean ≈ 65.0; consistent with spot mid-60s + bearish fundamentals + geopolitical upside tail.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Feb 2 de-escalation headlines coincided with ~5% drop to ~65–66 (risk premium unwinding).
   - Multiple credible 2026 outlooks cluster around ~55–57 average (surplus “gravity”).
   - OPEC+ holding Q1 cuts supports prices and limits near-term downside.
5) Blind spot: A sudden, real supply disruption in/near Hormuz could gap Brent up sharply (push outcome higher).
