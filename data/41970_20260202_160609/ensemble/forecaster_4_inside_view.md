Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Chronicle-Journal 02 Feb 2026 – hard data: intraday high 71.00, close 65.69, explains the fall on de-escalation headlines. Single day report; high factual quality for price prints.  
2. Neftegaz / Obozrevatel wire 02 Feb 2026 – ICE futures quotes 66.02-66.37 during the same session, cause = Trump comment. Confirms Chronicle-Journal (strong, independent).  
3. TradingView forum 28 Jan 2026 – crowd technical views; contains recent spot around 67-70 and scenario tree to Mar-Q2. Medium quality, mostly opinion.  
4. Enverus Outlook 13 Jan 2026 – institutional forecast: 2026 Brent annual average 55. Opinion but from specialised analysts; long-term anchor.  
5. BloombergNEF 16 Jan 2026 – base-case 55 in 2026 with 71 possible if Iranian exports lost. High quality, gives conditional upside ranges.  
6. ING THINK 22 Jan 2026 – 57 average 2026, reasons: growing surplus. Good macro anchor.  
7. Reuters/OPEC+ 30 Nov 2025 and follow-ups – Q1 voluntary cuts of 2.2 mb/d kept through Mar 2026. High quality; structural support to prices.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Two independent live-quote sources (1,2) show Brent in mid-66s on 02 Feb.  
• OPEC+ supply restraint fixed at least until 01 Apr 2026 (institutional communiqués).  
Moderate:  
• Multiple research houses (Enverus, BNEF, ING) agree on 2026 surplus and 55–57 annual average → downward pull.  
• Geopolitical premium currently falling after US-Iran de-escalation but easily reversible.  
Weak:  
• TradingView retail wave counts, anecdotal storage chatter.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 11 calendar days (~9 trading days). 10-day historical volatility (Jan 2026) ≈ 2.4 % day → one-sigma 6 $/bbl in 10 days. If horizon halved, st.dev ≈ 4 $; if doubled to 3 weeks, ≈ 8–9 $. Directional drivers would still be the same.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside view base rate: “Price in 11 days ≈ today” → centre 66.  
Downward adjustments: persistent surplus narrative, fading war premium, stronger USD (moderate).  
Upward adjustments: risk that talks break down, any incident in Strait of Hormuz, limited OPEC spare capacity brought to market before Apr (moderate).  
Net: keep median slightly above today (66.5) with fat tails: 10 % chance ≤ 58.5 (accelerated détente, macro risk-off); 10 % ≥ 76.5 (fresh Middle-East flare-up). Distribution left-skewed relative to current spot but still wide.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈ 67, median ≈ 66.5 – consistent with justification and historical ±6 $ one-sigma range. Extreme tails (<1 % or >99 %) extend beyond the bounds supplied by the platform.

Checklist:  
1. Target: Brent Europe (FRED code DCOILBRENTEU) closing value 13 Feb 2026, dollars per barrel.  
2. Base rate: stay near current mid-60s; Jan–Feb 3-month range 60–69.  
3. Consistency: median 66.5; mean 67 → aligns with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: i) spot 65-66 on 02 Feb, ii) OPEC+ cuts lock supply until Apr, iii) consensus 2026 surplus pulling prices lower, iv) US-Iran détente shaved 5 % in one day, v) rapid re-escalation always possible.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden closure of Strait of Hormuz (e.g., mining incident) could spike Brent > 90, pushing forecast far too low.
