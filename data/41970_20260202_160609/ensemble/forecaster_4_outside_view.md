Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FX-Street (2 Feb 2026).  Headline claims “oil prices surged in January amid geopolitical tensions – Deutsche Bank”, but the body of the extract contains no data.  Thin factual content → low weight.  
2. EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (Jan 2026 edition, published 9 Jan 2026).  Long-standing, high-quality statistical agency.  Forecasts calendar-year 2026 Brent average at 56 $/bbl on the basis of an expected supply surplus.  Useful to anchor the longer-run fundamental outlook but not very informative for a price only 11 days ahead.  
3. TradingEconomics (2 Feb 2026).  Quotes the spot Brent settlement at 65.97 $/bbl and provides recent history (69.6 on 29 Jan).  Factual; near-real-time; high relevance.  The embedded price forecasts (70.4 end-Q1, 76.3 in 12 m) come from an opaque model → treat as low-credibility opinions.  
4. Astana Times (5 Jan 2026).  Reports OPEC+ decision to keep output flat through Feb-Mar.  Primary source statements; reliable for the production baseline and therefore slightly bullish versus the EIA’s surplus narrative.  
5. Yahoo Finance / Reuters (30 Nov 2025).  Same decision framed earlier; factual, reputable, gives context to OPEC discipline.  
6. Shafaq News (2 Feb 2026).  Details Iraqi compensatory cuts of 614 kbd through June.  Factual numbers, but small vs global supply → only marginally price-supportive.  
7. Agent report (dated 2 Feb 2026).  Reproduces FRED daily series 1 Nov – 31 Jan.  High-quality raw data; shows actual path from 60.6 $ mid-Dec to 68.2 $ on 23 Jan and 67.7 $ on 31 Jan.  Also summarises drivers; the causal discussion is largely opinion but consistent with other analyst notes.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential classes:  
i. Daily Brent moves over a two-week horizon (1987-2025).  Median absolute 10-trading-day change ≈ 2 $/bbl; 90th-percentile ≈ 7 $/bbl.  Good direct fit to the target variable.  
ii. Episodes immediately after large ±5 % one-day moves.  Those regimes exhibit slightly higher 10-day volatility (≈ 1.3× baseline).  On 1 Feb Brent fell 4.8 % → suggests modestly higher risk.  
iii. Short windows around OPEC+ meetings.  Next formal meeting is 1 Mar, so none in the forecast window.  Less relevant.  

I adopt class (i) with a 15 % volatility uplift to reflect the fresh 5 % drop and ongoing Middle-East risk.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution: 11 calendar days, 8 business days.  Using realised daily σ ≈ 2 % (since 2018) and the 15 % uplift gives σ ≈ 2.3 % per day.  Eight trading days ⇒ √8 × 2.3 % ≈ 6.5 %.  At the current spot 66 $/bbl that is ±4.3 $.  

(d) Justification  
Status quo price: 66 $/bbl (latest FRED obs 31 Jan 67.7; intraday 2 Feb 66.0).  
Fundamentals in the next 11 days:  
• Supply—OPEC+ holding steady; Iraqi compensatory cuts marginal.  
• Demand—no major macro releases likely to transform the near-term view.  
• Geopolitics—Red Sea shipping and Iran-US talks pose two-sided risks but large headline events inside an 11-day window are low-probability.  
Therefore the outside view is dominated by normal short-horizon price noise with slightly fattened tails for geopolitical risk.  I centre the distribution on 65 $/bbl (rounded middle of current quotes) with a 90 % interval roughly ±8 $.

Outside view calibration:
Chosen distribution: log-normal approximation converted to discrete percentiles.  Mean ≈ 65, standard deviation ≈ 4.5.  90 % interval (10th–90th) ≈ 57–76 aligns with historical 10-day extremes while leaving room for a sudden headline shock.  Tails beyond 51 $ or above 90 $ remain possible but <5 % combined based on post-2010 incidence of >15 % 10-day moves (<2 % of all windows).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 57  
Percentile 20: 60  
Percentile 40: 63  
Percentile 60: 66  
Percentile 80: 70  
Percentile 90: 76
