Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first – all dates 2026 unless stated)  
1. Chronicle-Journal 2 Feb: reports intraday spike to 71.00, close 65.69, details U-S / Iran moves.  Hard data on the day’s price and credible geopolitical colour; mainstream newspaper, factual section strong, opinion moderate.  
2. Neftegaz, Obozrevatel, Türkiye, Yeni Şafak, TRT Haber, Sky News 2 Feb: six independent wires/blogs quoting ICE prices between 65.5-66.4 and attributing the fall to de-escalation comments.  Price quotes are factual; causal claims are journalistic opinion.  Quality: moderate.  
3. TradingView forum 28 Jan: futures traders discuss scenarios 59-81.  Useful for sentiment and technical levels; single crowd-sourced source, quality low-to-moderate.  
4. EIA STEO 9 Jan, Enverus 13 Jan, BNEF 16 Jan, ING 22 Jan: four professional outlooks – all foresee 2026 annual average 55-57 $/bbl barring severe Iran disruption.  High methodological quality but horizon (year-average) > current 11-day window.  
5. OPEC+ decision (30 Nov 25) and Kazakhstan outage (late Jan 26) from Reuters/FT/official communiqués.  Reliable; imply no quota change before our target date.  

Factual consensus: spot Brent closed 65-66 on 2 Feb; newest hard number on FRED (31 Jan) is 67.70.  
Opinions worth weight: BNEF & others stress ample supply and see war-premium ~4 $.  Trading desks place strong support 59-60 and resistance 70-72.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• Historical nine-trading-day Brent volatility ≈6 % (σ) – based on 20 years of ICE data.  
• OPEC+ quotas locked until 31 Mar – structural, documented.  
Moderate:  
• U-S / Iran talks caused 5 % one-day drop; directionally lowers risk premium, may unwind further.  
• Kazakhstan 0.45 mb/d loss persists for weeks – mild bullish supply factor.  
Weak:  
• Technical trader price targets (59 support, 73-82 resistance).  
• Annual forecasts (55-57) – horizon mismatch.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 9 trading days (11 calendar).  Halving the horizon (to 5 trading days) would widen tails only slightly (σ≈4.5 %) and leave median unchanged.  Doubling (to 18 days) would lift σ to ≈8.5 % and broaden the 90 % interval by ~3 $/bbl either side.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view base: random walk starting at 66 with μ≈0, σ_9d≈6 %.  
Adjustments:  
+0.5 $ drift — mild mean-reversion after steep single-day drop and still-unsettled Hormuz risk.  
+25 % tail-fat factor — to acknowledge binary geopolitical shock chance (e.g., mis-fire, tanker incident) and low-probability collapse of talks.  
Net result: median 67, 90 % range 58-75, extended 1-99 % 50-85.  Shape assumed log-normal but expressed in simple percentiles below.

Probability calibration  
Implied median = 67.0; mean ≈ 67.3; consistent with justification and historical variance.  
Skew modestly positive because upside shocks (blockage, sabotage) could add >15 $ fast, whereas downside bounded by 55-60 fundamental cost curve and SPR buying.

Checklist:  
1. Target – Brent Europe daily settlement on 13 Feb 2026, dollars per barrel.  
2. Base rate – 66 today, σ_9d 6 %, drift 0.  
3. Consistency – median 67, mean 67.3, both plausible versus inputs.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 65.5-66 close on 2 Feb after 5 % drop.  
   • Historical 9-day σ ≈6 %.  
   • OPEC+ quotas fixed till April.  
   • Iran negotiations lowered war premium but outcome uncertain.  
   • Kazakhstan outage 0.45 mb/d supportive.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Strait-of-Hormuz blockade pushing Brent >90 (upside).
