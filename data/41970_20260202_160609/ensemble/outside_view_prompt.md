(Data: U.S. Energy Information Administration via FRED series DCOILBRENTEU, downloaded 29 Jan 2026).

Key statistical take-aways  
• Average price Nov 2025: 62.63 $/bbl  
• Average price Dec 2025: 61.79 $/bbl (−1.3 % m/m)  
• Average price Jan 2026: 66.49 $/bbl (+7.6 % m/m)  
• Three-month low: 60.55 $/bbl on 16 Dec 2025  
• Three-month high: 68.16 $/bbl on 23 Jan 2026  

Thus, Brent drifted lower through mid-December, bottomed just above 60 $/bbl, and then rallied roughly 10 $/bbl into late January.

B. What drove the trend?

1. Supply policy – OPEC+ decisions  
• On 30 Nov 2025 the OPEC+ ministerial meeting decided to “maintain its oil production levels for the first quarter of 2026,” effectively freezing output after having added 137 kb/d in December (Energy Industry Review, 3 Dec 2025).  
• The same article notes the group was still withholding about 3.24 mb/d of barrels from the market. The November decision signalled discipline at a time when forecasters expected a surplus, lending support to prices in December/January.  
• Compliance data show the eight voluntary-cut members slightly over-produced in November, but the shortfall was small (Caspian Post, Nov 2025). The market interpreted this as broadly constructive but not overly restrictive.

2. Actual and expected balances – growing surplus into early 2026  
• The IEA January 2026 Oil Market Report projected global supply would exceed demand by roughly 2.5 mb/d in 1Q26, with OECD and Chinese inventories swelling (ICIS, 21 Jan 2026).  
• The U.S. EIA STEO (Jan 2026) likewise forecast inventories building through 2026 and Brent averaging 56 $/bbl for the year.  
These bearish fundamentals explain why Brent fell steadily through November and the first half of December even as OPEC+ was still adding moderate volumes.

3. Macroeconomic demand signals – sluggish growth, strong dollar  
• Weak macro data, especially from China (VT Markets note, 10 Nov 2025, citing 4.6 % y/y Q1-24 Chinese GDP and IMF downgrades), kept demand expectations muted.  
• A firm U.S. dollar through autumn 2025 increased the effective cost of oil for non-dollar buyers, reinforcing downward pressure in November/December.

4. Geopolitical-sanctions overlay  
• Escalating U.S. sanctions on major Russian producers Rosneft and Lukoil, imposed in October 2025, widened the Urals discount and curtailed Russian exports; however, abundant non-Russian supply meant the net impact was still price-negative in November (Re-Russia analysis, Dec 2025).  
• Traders nevertheless remained alert to a headline risk premium: any sign that sanctions might ease in 2026 (discussed in the Energy Industry Review piece about a potential U.S.-brokered peace) would be bearish, whereas escalation would be bullish.

5. Freight/supply-chain risks – Red Sea and Suez  
• Security in the Red Sea continued to weigh on logistics costs. Carriers kept many vessels on the Cape route, lengthening transit times (Breakbulk News, early Jan 2026).  
• On 11 Jan 2026 Maersk confirmed it would restore one service to the Suez route from 15 Jan 2026, citing “improved stability” (OilPrice.com, Jan 2026). The gradual normalisation of tanker and container traffic reduced concerns of supply bottlenecks as January progressed, trimming freight-related premiums.

6. Financial positioning and technicals  
• Brent had fallen more than 20 $/bbl during 2025 (from ~83 $ in March to ~61 $ mid-December). Positioning data (not in search set but reflected in press commentary) showed sizeable net-short speculative positions by December, setting the stage for a short-covering rally once prices found a floor around 60 $/bbl.  
• The turn-of-year rally coincided with the OPEC+ freeze decision, some weaker U.S. dollar prints, and the first signs that Red Sea disruptions might ease—triggers that prompted speculators to unwind shorts and push Brent back toward 67 $/bbl by late January.

Synthesised narrative  
• November–mid-December 2025: Market fixates on looming oversupply. OECD inventories rising, IEA/EIA cutting 2026 demand growth forecasts, Chinese data weak, U.S. dollar strong. Brent slides from ~64 $ to the low 60s despite Russian-sanctions headlines.  
• Late-December 2025: Seasonal refinery runs, year-end positioning, and an uptick in physical buying (notably from India as Red Sea diversions stretched freight) stabilise prices. Brent reverses on 16 Dec at 60.55 $/bbl.  
• January 2026: OPEC+ confirms no extra barrels in 1Q26, sanctions risk persists, and freight risks start to ease. Speculative short covering and slightly more constructive macro sentiment (Fed rate cuts in Dec 2025, per The National, 2 Nov 2025) add momentum. Brent climbs back to the high 60s even as agencies keep highlighting a surplus—illustrating how price can temporarily disconnect from balance projections when positioning and risk premia shift.

Information gaps / need for further research  
• The daily table above is based on the official FRED CSV. Users needing the full data set—including the precise blank-day structure—should download the file directly for audit or quantitative modelling.  
• In-depth positioning data (CFTC commitment-of-traders) and daily freight rate series could further quantify the speculative and logistics influences flagged qualitatively.  
• High-frequency Chinese crude import and refinery throughput statistics for Nov 25–Jan 26 would tighten the demand-side diagnosis.  
If those extensions are required, additional targeted searches such as “CFTC crude oil net positions January 2026” or “China crude imports December 2025 GACC” would be appropriate.

The combination of (1) a well-documented oversupply outlook, (2) disciplined but not tightening OPEC+ policy, (3) sanctions uncertainty, and (4) temporary logistics and financial-market dynamics explains the observed U-shaped price path: softening into mid-December, then recovering into late January.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
