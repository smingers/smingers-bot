Analysis:
Brent crude (FRED series DCOILBRENTEU) trades daily and is driven by the familiar triad of (1) global demand expectations—linked to world GDP growth, winter heating demand, and Chinese import volumes; (2) supply policy—especially OPEC+ quotas, U.S. shale responsiveness, and any unplanned outages; and (3) geopolitics and macro-financial conditions—Middle-East security, shipping constraints, dollar strength and risk-on/off positioning.  

At today’s reading (2 Feb 2026) the most recent published value is 67.7 $/bbl for 26 Jan 2026. That level is in the lower half of the post-COVID trading range (roughly 60-100 $/bbl). Since mid-2025 Brent has been sliding because (i) slower OECD growth, (ii) fading Chinese stimulus, and (iii) a steady recovery in non-OPEC supply, especially U.S. shale and Guyana, which has offset modest OPEC+ cuts announced last autumn. Front-month futures for delivery in March-April 2026 are currently hovering near 68-70 $/bbl, indicating that traders do not anticipate dramatic moves over the next fortnight absent a new shock.  

Historically, two-week moves of ±10 % are not rare when there is large news, but with inventories comfortable and no major conflict escalation in the last month, the base-rate expectation for 13 Feb 2026 is “little changed”, perhaps 65-72 $/bbl. To bound the tails we note that:  
• Sharp upside spikes (>80 $/bbl) in mere days require events such as a large Gulf outage or a Red-Sea closure.  
• Sharp downside breaks (<60 $/bbl) usually coincide with a sudden global-demand scare or a coordinated OPEC+ quota abandonment.  

Therefore, the relevant historical context to gather now is: 1) the exact daily path of DCOILBRENTEU since November 2025, 2) any fresh OPEC+ policy or unplanned supply outages announced after 26 Jan 2026, 3) recent futures curve shape and inventory data, and 4) macro headlines (Fed, China, shipping disruptions) between now and 13 Feb 2026. These will anchor an outside-view distribution around today’s 67–68 $/bbl spot.
