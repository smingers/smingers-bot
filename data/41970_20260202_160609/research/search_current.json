Analysts predict that these companies will reduce share buybacks rather than increase debt to protect their balance sheets. Since 2021, the sector has reduced its outstanding shares by about one-fifth through buybacks, but this strategy is now being reevaluated as oil prices fell by roughly 20% last year and are projected to drop further in the first half of 2026. UBS analyst Josh Stone noted that the rationale for aggressive buybacks\u2014when stock prices were low and balance sheets strong\u2014no longer applies. He forecasts a 21% reduction in shareholder distributions across the sector. In contrast, U.S. peers ExxonMobil and Chevron reported their lowest annual profits in four years but maintained dividend and buyback commitments. TotalEnergies plans to cut quarterly buybacks by $500 million to $1.25 billion, while Equinor will reduce annual buybacks from $5 billion in 2025 to $2 billion in 2026. Shell is expected to lower quarterly buybacks from $3.5 billion to $3 billion. Analysts warn that the improved market valuation of European firms has weakened the case for aggressive buybacks, and structural disadvantages\u2014such as larger reserves and better growth prospects for U.S. competitors\u2014further pressure European players. Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Kuplent emphasized that European firms cannot rely on asset sales (like Eni\u2019s $8 billion in 2024) to sustain payouts, as such measures are not repeatable. Market expectations for fourth-quarter results have already been tempered, with consensus earnings forecasts down 12%. Kuplent anticipates a challenging 2026 for the sector after a year of cost-cutting and production efforts. As of January 30, 2026, Brent crude traded near $71 per barrel amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:37 AM\nSource:[ZN.UA](https://zn.ua/ukr/WORLD/naftovi-kompaniji-jevropi-hotujutsja-do-znizhennja-tsin-na-naftu-i-zhorstkoji-ekonomiji-ft.html)\n\n**Oil Prices Drop Amid Reduced U.S.-Iran Tensions and OPEC+ Production Pause**\nOil prices declined on February 2, 2026, after rising sharply the previous week. On February 2, 2026, at 11:30 MSK, April Brent crude futures on ICE Futures fell 4.26% to $66.37 per barrel, while March WTI futures on NYMEX dropped 4.52% to $62.26 per barrel. This followed a strong performance in the prior week: Brent rose 8.64% and WTI gained 6.78%. Natural gas prices in the U.S. also fell, dropping 16.93% to $3.617 per million BTU by 11:30 MSK on February 2, after rising 11.13% on January 30, 2025. European gas prices fell below $440 per 1,000 m\u00b3, with March TTF futures on ICE Futures trading at \u20ac34.875/MWh ($438.50 per 1,000 m\u00b3), down 11.23% from the previous day. The drop in oil prices was attributed to reduced tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as U.S. President D. Trump stated that Tehran was taking negotiations seriously, easing fears of a potential U.S. military strike. Meanwhile, OPEC+ ministers reaffirmed their decision to maintain voluntary production cuts in the first quarter of 2026, keeping output quotas unchanged from December 2025. U.S. stock indices closed lower on January 30, 2025: Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36% to 48,892.47, S&P 500 dropped 0.43% to 6,939.03, and Nasdaq Composite declined 0.24% to 23,461.82.

Brent crude futures dropped by $3.30, or 4.8%, to $66.02 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell by $3.23, nearly 5%, to $61.98 per barrel. Experts attribute the drop to statements by U.S. President Donald Trump indicating serious negotiations between Iran and Washington, which eased geopolitical tensions. Reuters reported that market participants interpreted these remarks as a de-escalation signal, reducing the geopolitical premium previously built into oil prices. Additional factors included the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which made oil more expensive for foreign buyers, thereby reducing demand and further pressuring prices. Meanwhile, the European Union is considering replacing price caps on Russian oil with a ban on insurance and transportation services, which could significantly tighten sanctions. Russia\u2019s oil exports remain constrained by existing price caps, and according to recent data, Russia\u2019s revenue from oil and gas trade in 2025 fell to the lowest level in five years. In response to potential trade tensions with the U.S., Indian oil refiners have adjusted their import strategy\u2014reducing purchases from Russia, their top supplier, while increasing imports from the Middle East.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:58 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/ekonomika-glavnaya/economy/ssha-obvalili-vartist-nafti-yaki-teper-tsini1.htm)\n\n**U.S. 'Crashes' Oil Prices: What Are the New Rates?**\nOn February 2, 2026, global oil prices dropped significantly: Brent crude futures fell by $3.30 (4.8%) to $66.02 per barrel, and U.S. WTI futures dropped by $3.23 (nearly 5%) to $61.98 per barrel. Experts attribute the decline to President Donald Trump\u2019s statement about serious Iran-U.S. negotiations, which signaled de-escalation and reduced geopolitical risk premiums. Reuters reported that this, combined with intelligence that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Navy would not conduct live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz, eased market tensions. Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar made oil more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to reduced demand and further downward pressure on prices. Meanwhile, the European Union is considering replacing the oil price cap on Russian crude with a full ban on insurance and transportation, which could significantly tighten sanctions. As of 2025, Russia\u2019s oil and gas revenues have fallen to their lowest level in five years due to the existing price cap. In parallel, Indian refiners, anticipating potential trade tensions with the U.S., are gradually reducing Russian oil imports\u2014still their largest source\u2014while increasing purchases from the Middle East.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:56 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ekonomika-glavnaya/economy/ssha-obvalili-stoimost-nefti-kakie-teper-tsenyi1.htm)\n\n**Good News for Fuel Prices! Sharp Drop in Oil Prices**\nBrent crude oil prices dropped sharply at the start of the week, falling from $69.85 on Friday to $66.15 by 11:30 AM (TS\u0130) on Saturday, February 2, 2026, marking a daily decline of over 5%. The primary driver of the drop was a statement by U.S. President Trump, who announced that Iran had engaged in 'serious talks' with the U.S., signaling a reduction in geopolitical tensions. This eased fears of oil supply disruptions, particularly concerning Iran\u2019s activities in the Strait of Hormuz. Additional factors included reports that Iran would not conduct live military drills in the Strait, further calming markets. Concurrently, the U.S. dollar index rose following the emergence of Kevin Warsh, dubbed the 'hawk' candidate, as a leading contender for the Federal Reserve Chair, which put downward pressure on oil prices. As a result, expectations for a fuel price reduction in Turkey emerged, though no official discount had yet been announced. In Istanbul\u2019s European side, gasoline was priced at 55.23 TL per liter and diesel at 57.37 TL per liter, with sector representatives indicating that refinery margins could absorb the oil price drop, potentially leading to lower fuel prices soon.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:46 AM\nSource:[T\u00fcrkiye](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/ekonomi/akaryakit-icin-mujdeli-haber-petrol-fiyatlarinda-sert-dusus-1767963)\n\n**Brent Crude Oil Futures Trade at $65.53 Amid OPEC+ Stability Commitments and U.S.-Iran Negotiation Hopes**\nBrent crude oil prices closed the day at $69.73 per barrel on Friday, after rising to a high of $70.09 earlier in the session. The decline in prices was driven by reports of ongoing negotiations between the United States and Iran, which reduced the risk premium in crude oil markets. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed in a Fox News interview that discussions were underway with Iran regarding its nuclear program, though he offered no optimistic conclusions. Previous price increases due to concerns over potential U.S. military actions against Iran and cold weather were reversed as news of diplomatic talks emerged. Additionally, OPEC+ members, including eight countries from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, reaffirmed their commitment to market stability during a virtual meeting on Saturday. The group emphasized full compliance with voluntary production cuts and the need to address excess output, with market conditions to be monitored monthly and the next meeting scheduled for March 1, 2026. OPEC+'s adherence to production stability is supporting the downward trend in oil prices. Technically, $69.37 is noted as a resistance level, while $59.20 is seen as a key support level for Brent crude.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:16 AM\nSource:[Yeni \u015eafak](https://www.yenisafak.com/ekonomi/brent-petrolun-varili-6553-dolardan-islem-goruyor-4793623)\n\n**Brent Crude Oil Futures Trade at $65.53 Amid U.S.-Iran Talks and OPEC+ Stability Commitments**\nThe Brent crude oil price was trading at $65.53 per barrel at 09:39 local time on February 2, 2026, representing a 6% decline compared to the previous closing price. At the same time, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was trading at $61.42 per barrel. The price drop was driven by reports of ongoing talks between the U.S. and Iran, which reduced the risk premium in crude oil markets. U.S. President Donald Trump stated during an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the U.S. was in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, though he offered no definitive conclusions. Trump also mentioned that the U.S. was deploying a 'very large fleet' toward Iran, larger than the one in Venezuela, and noted that India would likely buy oil from Venezuela instead of Iran, while China's door remained open. Last week's market volatility due to concerns over potential U.S. military actions against Iran and increased demand from cold weather conditions reversed as news of diplomatic engagement emerged. Meanwhile, OPEC+ members\u2014including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman\u2014reaffirmed their commitment to market stability during an online meeting on Sunday. They confirmed the suspension of planned production increases in March due to seasonality and stated that the current daily output of 1.65 million barrels could be gradually resumed depending on market conditions. The group emphasized full compliance with voluntary production cuts and the need to offset excessive output, with market conditions to be monitored monthly and the next meeting scheduled for March 1, 2026. OPEC+'s decision to maintain production levels is supporting the downward trend in oil prices.

Spot gold fell 7% to $4,480 per ounce, and silver dropped nearly 11% to $73.94, marking their worst day since 1983 and 1980 respectively. These declines followed Donald Trump\u2019s announcement on Friday that he nominated Kevin Warsh to succeed Jay Powell as chair of the US Federal Reserve, which eased concerns about the central bank\u2019s independence. The sell-off was exacerbated by brokerages increasing margin requirements during a volatile period, forcing investors to liquidate other assets to meet margin calls. Prior to the drop, gold had reached a record high of $5,594.82 per ounce and silver $121.64. Cryptocurrencies also declined sharply, with Bitcoin falling below $80,000 for the first time since April 2025 and trading at $75,142. Brent crude oil dropped from $70 to $65 per barrel. Asian markets reflected the downturn, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index down 3%. European markets were expected to open lower, with the FTSE 100 forecast to decline by 0.7%, and US S&P 500 futures showing a 1% drop.

The U.S. dollar weakened amid panic-driven capital outflows into gold and commodities, though it partially recovered late in the week due to profit-taking and rising liquidity demand. EUR/USD surged past its 1.1470\u20131.1830 range, reaching 1.2083 before retreating to 1.1850; support remains at 1.1820\u20131.1830, with upside targets at 1.1900, 1.1975, and 1.2000\u20131.2100, while a drop below support could lead to a decline toward 1.1700 and 1.1580\u20131.1620. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) fell to $80,944 on January 30, 2026, rebounded to around $83,000, and may attempt a correction toward $84,150\u201384,600, with further targets at $86,500\u201387,700 and $90,500\u201391,000; a breakout above $91,000 could trigger growth toward $95,000, while a drop from $84,600 or $86,500 could see a decline to $80,540 and potentially $74,500. Brent crude oil ended near $69.72, near the upper boundary of its long-term descending channel; a further escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions could push prices toward $72.70, $76.15, and $77.75, while a downward rebound could target $66.00, $65.00, and $63.50. Gold (XAU/USD) experienced unprecedented volatility, surging to $5,595 and crashing to $4,483 before stabilizing at $4,891; a downward correction may test $4,535\u20134,675, with strong support at $4,200\u20134,350, and a breakdown below that could lead to $3,350; resistance remains at $5,000 and $5,600, with the primary bull target at $6,000. Key upcoming events include the U.S. labor market report, business activity data, inflation expectations, European PMI figures, and ECB commentary. Baseline scenarios: EUR/USD remains cautiously bullish above 1.1830; BTC/USD is neutral-to-bearish below 90,500\u201391,000; Brent is cautiously bearish below 72.70; XAU/USD preserves bullish structure above 4,535\u20134,675.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 03:33 PM\nSource:[mql5.com](https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/767090)\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions Push Oil Prices to New Heights, But Hidden Risks Loom**\nFrom January 26 to January 30, 2026, the international crude oil market experienced a strong upward trend driven by escalating geopolitical tensions. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures recorded four consecutive daily gains starting Monday, closing at $65.51 per barrel on Friday, with a weekly increase of 7.28%\u2014the highest weekly close in nearly six months. Brent crude futures also performed strongly, briefly surpassing the psychological threshold of $70 per barrel, and finished the week at $69.64 per barrel, marking a 5.48% weekly gain. The future trajectory of oil prices\u2014whether they can sustain recent gains and move higher\u2014will depend on whether there are substantive changes in U.S.-Iran relations, the performance of global economic data, and technical-level battles in the market. In this volatile winter, crude oil market volatility is expected to remain elevated.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 12:13 PM\nSource:[China Finance Online](http://futures.cnfol.com/qishidongtai/20260131/31989249.shtml)\n\n**Amid Supply Concerns, Oil Records Monthly Gains of Over 16%**\nOil prices rose significantly in January 2026, closing near their highest levels in six months despite a minor decline on Friday. The benchmark Brent crude futures settled at $70.69 per barrel, down 0.03% on Friday but recording a weekly gain of 7.3% and a monthly increase of 16.2%. Similarly, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed at $65.21 per barrel, down 21 cents (0.32%) on Friday, with a weekly gain of 6.8% and a monthly rise of 13.6%. The gains were driven by escalating concerns over supply disruptions due to rising tensions between the United States and Iran. The data reflects sustained upward momentum in oil prices over the month, supported by geopolitical risks impacting global supply stability.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:30 AM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/economics/1476083/%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-16)\n\n**Oil Prices Surge Amid Geopolitical Tensions, But Analysts Warn of Reversion to Fundamental Weakness**\nIn early 2026, international crude oil markets experienced renewed volatility due to escalating tensions in Iran. Brent crude prices rose above $70 per barrel within a month, gaining over $10 per barrel\u2014the strongest rebound in six months. Analysts from Zhonghui Futures and Haizheng Futures warn that while the recent surge reflects high geopolitical risk premiums, the fundamental global oil supply-demand balance remains one of oversupply. The current price increase has already approached the peak risk premium seen during the June 2025 Iran-Israel conflict, when premiums reached around $15 per barrel. Both analysts emphasize that temporary supply disruptions\u2014such as the unplanned shutdown of Kazakhstan\u2019s Tengiz oilfield and short-term U.S. production drops due to extreme cold\u2014have been offset by high U.S. output, recovering port activity, and potential OPEC+ production increases in Q2 2026. Demand-side trends show structural weakness: gasoline and diesel demand growth is expected to be minimal (0.3% and 0.8% year-on-year in 2026, per IEA), driven by the ongoing shift to new energy vehicles. Analysts caution that if geopolitical tensions ease without material supply disruptions, the risk premium will unwind, leading to price corrections. They predict that oil prices will remain under pressure due to persistent oversupply, with price movements likely to follow a pattern of sharp spikes and rapid declines. Zheng Mengqi of Haizheng Futures warns investors to manage risk, noting potential for large price gaps in domestic markets due to holiday trading suspensions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 02:48 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202601313637691780.html)\n\n**Global Oil Prices Forecast to Decline to $62 per Barrel by 2026**\nAccording to Reuters, citing a January survey of 31 market participants, the average global price for Brent crude oil is projected to fall to approximately $62 per barrel by 2026. The survey forecasted a 2024 average price of $62.02 per barrel, with current spot prices slightly below $70. This marks an increase from the December 2025 forecast of $61.27, driven by heightened geopolitical tensions, including the detention of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, U.S. threats of military intervention in Iran, U.S.-EU disputes over Greenland, and ongoing conflict in Ukraine, all of which raised concerns about potential supply disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz. However, Reuters notes that the outlook for oversupply is likely to offset these risks. Expected recovery in oil exports from Venezuela in the second half of 2024, combined with potential increases in daily production from OPEC+ countries, is anticipated to stabilize Brent prices near $62 per barrel. In 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected the average Brent price to be near $69.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 01:50 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2026/01/30/mirovym-tsenam-na-neft-sprognozirovali-padenie/)\n\n**Brent Crude Oil Rises to $64.17 per Barrel Amid U.S.-EU Tensions**\nBrent crude oil prices rose to $64.17 per barrel by 14:29 Moscow time on January 20, 2026, an increase of $0.23 (0.36%) on the ICE Futures exchange. Meanwhile, WTI crude futures rose to $59.55 per barrel, up $0.21 (0.35%) on NYMEX. Market attention remains focused on geopolitical tensions involving Greenland, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a 10% import tariff on goods from European countries that did not support his plan to annex the island for national security reasons. In response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU nations are prepared for a coordinated response, with reports indicating that the EU is considering tariffs worth \u20ac93 billion on U.S. goods. According to Mukes Sahdev of XAnalysts Pty Ltd, markets are not pricing in a full-scale conflict between the U.S. and EU, suggesting a compromise is likely. However, in the event of escalation, the U.S. could gain the upper hand due to its economic and energy advantages. Additionally, rising U.S.-Europe tensions contributed to a decline in the U.S. dollar\u2019s value against major currencies. Warren Patterson of ING Groep NV noted that the weakening dollar provided some support to oil prices, despite a broader retreat from risk assets. Analysts caution that existing forecasts of a significant oil surplus on the market point to downward pressure on prices, while further escalation in transatlantic tensions adds another bearish risk.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/1068515)\n\n**Will Brent Crude Oil Prices Fall to $50 a Barrel in 2026? \u2013 Rabobank Forecasts Oversupply and Sluggish Demand**\nAccording to a recent report by Rabobank International, Brent crude oil prices are not expected to rise significantly in 2026. The report forecasts Brent crude to average $60 per barrel in the first quarter, $57 in the second and third quarters, and rise slightly to $59 in the fourth quarter. WTI crude is projected to fall to $56.5 in Q1, average $53.5 in Q2\u2013Q3, and reach $55 in Q4. Despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. trade tariffs, Brent crude prices have fallen nearly 17% over the past year to $61.5 per barrel. The main driver of downward pressure is a growing supply-demand imbalance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a record 3.8 million barrels per day surplus in 2026\u2014higher than the 2.4 million barrels per day oversupply in 2020. Experts suggest Brent crude\u2019s average price could fall to $55 or below in 2026 due to oversupply fears. Key factors include potential peace agreements between Russia and Ukraine, which could lift sanctions and allow Russian oil exports to resume normally, ending practices like ship-to-ship transfers and dark inventory. Additionally, increased production from South American countries like Guyana and Brazil will add unwanted supply, though partially offset by a projected decline in U.S. production from 13.61 million bpd in 2025 to 13.53 million bpd in 2026\u2014a decrease of 80,000 bpd. Rabobank forecasts an even steeper decline: 180,000 bpd in 2026 and 200,000 bpd in 2027 due to high break-even drilling costs and low prices. Demand remains sluggish, particularly for gasoline, which is expected to peak by 2028. This is driven by the rapid rise in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in China and Europe. OPEC+ is expected to respond with production cuts or market interventions. In November 2025, eight OPEC members paused plans to increase production due to surplus signals. Saudi Arabia has historically led coordinated cuts to maintain tight markets and high prices, preserving spare capacity and funding new field development. As stated by senior energy strategists Jo D\u2019Loura and Florence Schmidt, 'Controlling new supply with iron-hand discipline is the only way to keep prices high, given the current demand growth rate.'\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 09:56 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://hindi.business-standard.com/companies/oil-gas/will-brent-crude-oil-prices-fall-to-50-dollar-a-barrel-in-2026-id-492920)\n\n**Brent Crude Oil Price Today: $61.95 Amid U.S. Stock Decline and Geopolitical Watch**\nAs of 09:34 on December 10, 2025, Brent crude oil prices rose by 0.11% to $61.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil traded at $58.26 per barrel. The modest increase in oil prices was driven by expectations of a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. commercial crude oil stocks, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), which projected a drop of 4.8 million barrels, exceeding the market expectation of a 1.7 million barrel decline. This stronger-than-expected drop reinforced the perception of high demand in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer, the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is set to release its official stock data later in the day. Additionally, market pricing reflects an 86% probability of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which supports expectations of stronger economic growth and rising oil demand. Meanwhile, progress in peace talks between Ukraine and its European allies is being closely monitored; Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskiy stated that revised peace plans would soon be sent to the U.S., emphasizing that ending the war depends on Russia. A breakthrough could reduce geopolitical risks and put downward pressure on oil prices, while a delay or deadlock may increase risk premiums and push prices higher. The EIA also revised its 2026 average oil price forecast upward in its 'December 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook Report,' projecting a Brent crude average of $55.08 and WTI of $51.42 for 2026. The report also noted that U.S. daily crude oil production is expected to reach a record 13.61 million barrels per day in 2025.

The EIA also stated that global oil inventories are expected to continue growing, exerting significant downward pressure on prices. However, the report noted that OPEC+ production policies and continued Chinese strategic petroleum reserve accumulation could help limit the decline in 2026. Additionally, the EIA projected that OPEC+ production will fall 1.3 million barrels per day below planned levels. Meanwhile, Zhongcai Futures analyzed that the expectation of a European refined products shortage has been significantly reduced, contributing to the downward trend in crude prices, and forecast that oil prices will remain in a range-bound trading pattern amid geopolitical premiums and supply oversupply.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 01:52 AM\nSource:[\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://finance.huanqiu.com/article/4PTwe4Fcrx7)\n\n**Brent Crude Oil Prices Dip to $62.35 Amid Supply Surplus Fears and Geopolitical Uncertainty**\nBrent crude oil prices opened at $62.35 per barrel on November 25, 2025, down approximately 0.8% from the previous day's close of $62.85, after peaking at $62.95 the day before. At 09:40 local time, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil traded at $58.42 per barrel. The partial decline in oil prices was driven by concerns over a supply surplus in 2026, which is exerting downward pressure on demand. Despite ongoing uncertainty regarding Russian oil shipments, market outlook for 2026 remains 'looser' as many institutions forecast that supply growth will outpace demand growth in 2025, marking oversupply as the key short-term risk. Current price levels are therefore considered fragile. Restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on imports of Russian crude and refined products have led Indian refiners, including Reliance, to reduce purchases of Russian oil. Reliance stated it is evaluating the impact of these new restrictions, including new compliance requirements, and affirmed its intention to adhere to EU guidelines in refined product exports to Europe. As export channels to Europe shrink, Russia is increasing exports to China, with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak confirming discussions with China during the China-Russia Business Forum in Beijing. Goldman Sachs projected a global oil supply surplus of 2 million barrels per day in 2026, forecasting Brent crude could average $56 per barrel by then, citing the resumption of delayed post-pandemic investments and the end of OPEC+ production cuts as key drivers of supply growth. The bank also noted that a permanent recovery in the market is unlikely before 2027. Expectations of weaker market conditions in 2026 overshadow the limited support that potential Ukraine-Russia peace talks might provide, as a deal could lead to sanctions removal and the re-entry of Russian oil into global supply. However, oil markets are receiving support from rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at its December 9\u201310 meeting.

For 2025, the projected average price is $62.4 per barrel, down from the previous estimate of $64. In 2027, the price is expected to rise to $63.3 per barrel. The average Brent price in 2024 reached $80.5 per barrel. According to the EC report, 'oil prices remained low amid rising supply and ongoing concerns about global demand.'
