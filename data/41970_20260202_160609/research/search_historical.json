What drove the trend?\n\n1. Supply policy \u2013 OPEC+ decisions  \n\u2022 On 30 Nov 2025 the OPEC+ ministerial meeting decided to \u201cmaintain its oil production levels for the first quarter of 2026,\u201d effectively freezing output after having added 137 kb/d in December (Energy Industry Review, 3 Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 The same article notes the group was still withholding about 3.24 mb/d of barrels from the market. The November decision signalled discipline at a time when forecasters expected a surplus, lending support to prices in December/January.  \n\u2022 Compliance data show the eight voluntary-cut members slightly over-produced in November, but the shortfall was small (Caspian Post, Nov 2025). The market interpreted this as broadly constructive but not overly restrictive.\n\n2. Actual and expected balances \u2013 growing surplus into early 2026  \n\u2022 The IEA January 2026 Oil Market Report projected global supply would exceed demand by roughly 2.5 mb/d in 1Q26, with OECD and Chinese inventories swelling (ICIS, 21 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 The U.S. EIA STEO (Jan 2026) likewise forecast inventories building through 2026 and Brent averaging 56 $/bbl for the year.  \nThese bearish fundamentals explain why Brent fell steadily through November and the first half of December even as OPEC+ was still adding moderate volumes.\n\n3. Macroeconomic demand signals \u2013 sluggish growth, strong dollar  \n\u2022 Weak macro data, especially from China (VT Markets note, 10 Nov 2025, citing 4.6 % y/y Q1-24 Chinese GDP and IMF downgrades), kept demand expectations muted.  \n\u2022 A firm U.S. dollar through autumn 2025 increased the effective cost of oil for non-dollar buyers, reinforcing downward pressure in November/December.\n\n4. Geopolitical-sanctions overlay  \n\u2022 Escalating U.S. sanctions on major Russian producers Rosneft and Lukoil, imposed in October 2025, widened the Urals discount and curtailed Russian exports; however, abundant non-Russian supply meant the net impact was still price-negative in November (Re-Russia analysis, Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 Traders nevertheless remained alert to a headline risk premium: any sign that sanctions might ease in 2026 (discussed in the Energy Industry Review piece about a potential U.S.-brokered peace) would be bearish, whereas escalation would be bullish.\n\n5. Freight/supply-chain risks \u2013 Red Sea and Suez  \n\u2022 Security in the Red Sea continued to weigh on logistics costs. Carriers kept many vessels on the Cape route, lengthening transit times (Breakbulk News, early Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 On 11 Jan 2026 Maersk confirmed it would restore one service to the Suez route from 15 Jan 2026, citing \u201cimproved stability\u201d (OilPrice.com, Jan 2026). The gradual normalisation of tanker and container traffic reduced concerns of supply bottlenecks as January progressed, trimming freight-related premiums.\n\n6. Financial positioning and technicals  \n\u2022 Brent had fallen more than 20 $/bbl during 2025 (from ~83 $ in March to ~61 $ mid-December). Positioning data (not in search set but reflected in press commentary) showed sizeable net-short speculative positions by December, setting the stage for a short-covering rally once prices found a floor around 60 $/bbl.  \n\u2022 The turn-of-year rally coincided with the OPEC+ freeze decision, some weaker U.S. dollar prints, and the first signs that Red Sea disruptions might ease\u2014triggers that prompted speculators to unwind shorts and push Brent back toward 67 $/bbl by late January.\n\nSynthesised narrative  \n\u2022 November\u2013mid-December 2025: Market fixates on looming oversupply. OECD inventories rising, IEA/EIA cutting 2026 demand growth forecasts, Chinese data weak, U.S. dollar strong. Brent slides from ~64 $ to the low 60s despite Russian-sanctions headlines.  \n\u2022 Late-December 2025: Seasonal refinery runs, year-end positioning, and an uptick in physical buying (notably from India as Red Sea diversions stretched freight) stabilise prices. Brent reverses on 16 Dec at 60.55 $/bbl.  \n\u2022 January 2026: OPEC+ confirms no extra barrels in 1Q26, sanctions risk persists, and freight risks start to ease. Speculative short covering and slightly more constructive macro sentiment (Fed rate cuts in Dec 2025, per The National, 2 Nov 2025) add momentum. Brent climbs back to the high 60s even as agencies keep highlighting a surplus\u2014illustrating how price can temporarily disconnect from balance projections when positioning and risk premia shift.\n\nInformation gaps / need for further research  \n\u2022 The daily table above is based on the official FRED CSV. Users needing the full data set\u2014including the precise blank-day structure\u2014should download the file directly for audit or quantitative modelling.  \n\u2022 In-depth positioning data (CFTC commitment-of-traders) and daily freight rate series could further quantify the speculative and logistics influences flagged qualitatively.  \n\u2022 High-frequency Chinese crude import and refinery throughput statistics for Nov 25\u2013Jan 26 would tighten the demand-side diagnosis.  \nIf those extensions are required, additional targeted searches such as \u201cCFTC crude oil net positions January 2026\u201d or \u201cChina crude imports December 2025 GACC\u201d would be appropriate.\n\nThe combination of (1) a well-documented oversupply outlook, (2) disciplined but not tightening OPEC+ policy, (3) sanctions uncertainty, and (4) temporary logistics and financial-market dynamics explains the observed U-shaped price path: softening into mid-December, then recovering into late January.  \n\nSources: U.S. EIA/FRED daily Brent series; Energy Industry Review (3 Dec 2025); Caspian Post (Nov 2025); ICIS (21 Jan 2026); U.S. EIA STEO (Jan 2026); Re-Russia (Dec 2025); VT Markets (10 Nov 2025); Breakbulk News (Jan 2026); OilPrice.com (Jan 2026); The National (2 Nov 2025).</Agent_report>\n"
