## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Viral internet slang terms during major news events**
   - Suitability: High
   - Pattern: Terms spike dramatically during peak news coverage, then decay rapidly
   - Examples: Terms associated with political events typically spike 200-500% during peak coverage, then drop 50-80% within 1-2 weeks

2. **Parenting trend terminology on social media**
   - Suitability: Medium
   - Pattern: Slower burn, sustained interest over weeks/months as TikTok videos circulate
   - Less volatile than news-driven spikes

3. **Trump-related political catchphrases**
   - Suitability: High
   - Pattern: Intense spikes during specific events, rapid decay, potential for re-spikes with new events
   - Examples: "Covfefe" spiked massively then dropped within days

**Most Suitable Reference Class: Viral internet slang during major political/news events**

The Trump-Colombia incident (late January 2026) represents a major catalyst where "FAFO" was used by Trump himself, amplified by Elon Musk and other high-profile figures, creating a perfect viral moment. This is similar to other Trump-originated viral terms.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 13 days (Feb 2 to Feb 15, 2026)

**Key Timeline:**
- Jan 29, 2026: Guardian publishes FAFO parenting article (4 days before Feb 2)
- Late Jan 2026: Trump-Colombia standoff with FAFO going viral (approximately 3-7 days before Feb 2)
- Feb 2, 2026: Question opens (baseline date)
- Feb 15, 2026: Resolution date

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Trump-Colombia incident is approximately 3-7 days old by Feb 2
- Typical viral term lifecycle: Peak within 2-4 days of triggering event, then 50-70% decay over next 7-10 days
- FAFO parenting trend: Slower-burning but still recent (Jan 29 article suggests peak coverage around that time)

**Expected Pattern:**
By Feb 2, we're likely 3-7 days past the peak of the Trump-Colombia viral moment. The typical pattern suggests:
- Days 0-3: Explosive growth (already past)
- Days 4-7: Peak plateau (likely where we are on Feb 2)
- Days 8-14: Decay phase (50-70% drop)
- Days 15-21: Continued decay (Feb 15 falls here)

## (d) Justification

The question asks about changes between Feb 2 (baseline) and Feb 15 (13 days later).

**Key Factors Supporting Decrease:**

1. **Temporal position in viral cycle**: By Feb 2, the Trump-Colombia FAFO moment is approximately 3-7 days old. This places Feb 2 near or slightly past peak interest. By Feb 15 (another 13 days), we'd be 16-20 days post-event—well into the decay phase.

2. **News cycle dynamics**: Major geopolitical incidents dominate for 3-5 days, then fade unless new developments occur. Without new "FAFO" moments from Trump or other high-profile figures, interest naturally decays.

3. **Historical precedent**: Similar Trump-originated viral terms show sharp spikes followed by 60-80% drops within 2 weeks.

4. **Dual-source spike**: Both the Trump-Colombia incident AND FAFO parenting created interest in late January. By Feb 15, both sources will be "old news" (2-3 weeks old).

**Factors Supporting Stable/Increase:**

1. **FAFO parenting trend**: This represents sustained, TikTok-driven interest that could maintain baseline search interest.

2. **Potential for new events**: Trump's unpredictable behavior could create new "FAFO moments" between Feb 2-15.

3. **Meme lifecycle**: Sometimes terms enter broader cultural lexicon and maintain elevated baseline.

**Most Likely Scenario:**
Given we're likely at or past peak on Feb 2, and viral political terms typically decay 50-70% over 2 weeks, a decrease of >3 points (on 0-100 scale) by Feb 15 is most probable. The threshold of "more than 3" is relatively small, making a decrease highly likely unless the Feb 2 value is already very low (suggesting the spike has passed) or new events occur.

## Outside View Calibration

**Probability Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Base rates for viral term decay**: Studies of Twitter/Google Trends show 70-80% of viral terms decrease significantly within 2 weeks of peak.

2. **The ±3 threshold**: This is a narrow band. On a 0-100 scale, if Feb 2 value is 50, staying 47-53 represents only 6% of the total range. This makes "Doesn't change" relatively unlikely unless interest is already at a stable baseline.

3. **Uncertainty factors**:
   - Exact timing of peak unknown (could be Jan 28-Feb 1)
   - Possibility of new Trump "FAFO" moments (low but non-zero)
   - FAFO parenting trend sustainability unclear

4. **Historical upset rate**: Political viral terms are somewhat predictable in their decay patterns, but Trump-related phenomena have ~15-20% upset rate due to his unpredictability and media amplification effects.

**Calibration Logic:**
- If Feb 2 is at/near peak (60-80% likely): Strong decrease expected by Feb 15
- If Feb 2 is post-peak but still elevated (15-25% likely): Moderate to strong decrease expected
- If Feb 2 is already at new baseline (5-10% likely): Stable or slight changes possible
- New viral event between Feb 2-15 (10-15% likely): Could cause increase

**Final Calibration:**
Given the strong evidence that we're in the decay phase of a major viral moment, decrease is most likely. However, the narrow ±3 threshold and potential for new events create meaningful probability mass for "Doesn't change" and small probability for "Increases."

Decreases: 68%
Doesn't change: 21%
Increases: 11%
