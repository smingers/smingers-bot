Analysis:

1) Resolution / options (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-15 (US, Google Trends “fafo”), resolve **Doesn’t change** if 2/15 is within ±3 of 2/2; **Increases** if >+3; **Decreases** if <-3.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what’s factual vs opinion)

1. sloganscopy.com “FAFO Meaning 2026…” (Jan 21, 2026)
- Quality: Low-to-medium. SEO/explainer site; likely to reflect real usage but weak on measurement.
- Factual claims: Definition, platforms where used; asserts “steady interest” and common searches for “FAFO meaning 2026” (not well-sourced).
- Opinions: “less shocking than before,” “no longer niche,” interpretive tone statements.

2. CNN “The Trump administration is all memes and ragebait” (Jan 19, 2026)
- Quality: High (mainstream outlet) for describing comms strategy and documenting specific posts.
- Factual: Timeline including Trump sharing an image with “FAFO” (Jan 26, 2025) and broader meme-heavy government posting behavior.
- Expert opinion: Political communication scholars’ interpretations (credible, named).

3. Economic Times “Wall Street loves the laughs… acronyms… TACO and FAFO…” (date not shown in snippet; appears recent context in Trump 2nd term)
- Quality: Medium. Reputable outlet, but secondary reporting; still useful for “FAFO” appearing in finance discourse.
- Factual: Claims “FAFO” increasingly used on trading desks; describes meme-acronym ecosystem.
- Opinion: Framing that it’s “taking meme markets by storm” (headline flourish).

4. Economic Times “After FAFO, BAMF goes viral…” (late Jan 2026 context)
- Quality: Medium-to-high for describing the viral label attached to a discrete geopolitical episode; but “goes viral” intensity is somewhat editorial.
- Factual: Trump used “FAFO” in a Truth Social post re: Colombia deportation standoff; Musk used “BAMF”; Colombia accepted terms per WH statement.
- Opinion: Virality emphasis; origin stories partly recycled from other outlets.

5. Asknews “Fafo trades …” crypto price-update items (Jan 31, Feb 2, 2026)
- Quality: Low relevance. “Fafo” here is a micro-cap token ticker (FAFO-USD), not necessarily the slang term; could add noise if some searches are for the token, but volumes appear tiny.
- Factual: Price/mcap/volume (but not tied to Google search behavior).

6. FXEmpire / FinanceFeeds “FAFO narrative drives markets…” (Jan 13, 2026)
- Quality: Medium. Finance commentary; may seed a niche “FAFO” usage (they even redefine it in a finance/geopolitics framing).
- Factual: Market moves, mentions of narrative; but causality is interpretive.
- Opinion: Narrative framing and market interpretation.

7. (From your outside-view context) Guardian “FAFO parenting” viral trend (Jan 29, 2026)
- Quality: High (if accurately cited). Would be a strong “meme/parenting” channel that tends to spike searches for “what does X mean?”
- Factual: TikTok view/like counts; mainstream coverage.
- Opinion: Expert commentary about parenting styles.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria: 2/15 vs 2/2 level)

Strong evidence
- Viral-term lifecycle / decay pattern: The late-Jan Trump-Colombia + “FAFO parenting” coverage looks like a classic spike-and-fade setup. If 2/2 is near/just after peak, by 2/15 it’s often lower by >3. (This is structural/behavioral and historically predictive.)

Moderate evidence
- Continued institutional amplification risk (CNN): The administration’s meme-forward style increases the chance of *another* “FAFO”-tagged moment within the 13-day window, which would interrupt decay or cause a rebound. This moderates confidence in “Decreases.”
- Finance/trading-desk diffusion (Economic Times + FXEmpire): Indicates “FAFO” is used beyond one event (finance slang), which can prop up a baseline and reduce the expected drop magnitude.

Weak evidence
- SEO explainer claiming “steady interest” (sloganscopy): plausible but not measured; small nudge toward stability.
- Crypto “FAFO” token updates: could slightly add to searches, but the token appears illiquid/tiny, so likely negligible for US Google Trends.

Net: still downward pressure dominates (post-spike decay), but persistence/renewed-trigger risk is non-trivial, so I temper the outside-view confidence in “Decreases.”

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until resolution: 13 days (from 2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15).
- If timeframe were halved (~6–7 days): I’d expect a higher chance of “Doesn’t change” (less time for drift/decay) and a modestly lower chance of “Decreases.”
- If timeframe were doubled (~26 days): I’d expect “Decreases” to become more likely again (more time for decay toward baseline), unless repeated events keep re-spiking interest.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view base rates

Outside view base rate (given): Increases 11 / Doesn’t change 21 / Decreases 68.

Key inside-view adjustments:
1) “We might already be past the peak by Feb 2” effect: If the big late-Jan spike has already decayed by 2/2, then the next two weeks could be flatter (raising “Doesn’t change”). This is especially relevant because the resolution compares **2/2 vs 2/15**, not “peak vs 2/15.”
2) “Second spike” risk: CNN-style comms + Trump volatility increases odds of a fresh catalyst in a two-week window, raising “Increases” somewhat (or at least reducing “Decreases”).
3) But absent a new catalyst, decay remains the default: the reference class still fits; the ±3 threshold is small, so even moderate decay likely clears it.

So I pull probability mass from “Decreases” into both “Doesn’t change” (if already normalized by 2/2) and “Increases” (if another incident lands).

Probability calibration

- Most likely remains **Decreases**, but less dominant than 68% because (i) Feb 2 may already reflect post-spike baseline, and (ii) renewed-trigger risk is meaningful over 13 days.
- I also keep “Increases” meaningfully above zero because Trump/news shocks are exactly the kind of thing that can cause a >3 move in a short window for a slang/political meme term.

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: Compare Google Trends “fafo” US value on 2/15 vs 2/2; within ±3 = Doesn’t change; >+3 Increase; <-3 Decrease.
2) Outside view used: [11, 21, 68].
3) Consistency: Most likely=Decreases; least likely=Increases; aligned with post-viral decay but allowing re-spike risk.
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Late-Jan viral usage (Trump/Colombia + “FAFO parenting”) typically decays over 2 weeks.
   - Meme-heavy administration raises odds of a new “FAFO” moment within the window.
   - Finance discourse suggests a higher baseline (less drop) than a one-off meme.
5) Blind spot: A new major “FAFO”-branded incident (or coordinated media moment) between 2/2–2/15 could flip outcome to Increases.
6) Technical: Probabilities sum to 100; integers; no percent signs.

Probabilities: [13, 28, 59]
