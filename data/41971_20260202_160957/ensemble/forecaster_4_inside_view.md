Analysis  
--------------------------------------------------  
1. Paraphrased resolution: Compare the daily Google Trends value for “fafo” in the United States on 15 Feb 2026 with that on 2 Feb 2026 (data range 16 Jan–15 Feb).  
• >3 points higher → “Increases”  
• within ±3 → “Doesn’t change”  
• >3 points lower → “Decreases”  
Window to forecast: 13 days.

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, key take-aways)  
• Guardian (29 Jan 2026) – mainstream feature on “Fafo parenting”, cites 4.9 m-view TikTok video; factual virality metrics plus expert comment. High quality, recent.  
• Economic Times (24 & 26 Jan 2026) – two articles tying Trump-Colombia standoff and Wall-Street memes to “FAFO”; factual description of posts plus “went viral” language; medium quality.  
• FXEmpire/FinanceFeeds (13 Jan 2026) – market commentary branding geopolitics the “FAFO narrative”; opinion-heavy but factually notes media repetition; lower weight.  
• Sloganscopy explainer (21 Jan 2026) – SEO blog summarising meaning and Google Trends “steady interest”; low–medium quality.  
• Crypto-price feeds (30 Jan–2 Feb 2026) – ticker for a micro-cap coin named FAFO; tangential; low relevance.  
No live Trends data are available; thus we infer shape from the news cycle.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: slang/acronym searches spike shortly after mainstream coverage then decay within one–two weeks (seen with “rizz”, “bomboclaat”, “NPC”, etc.).  
Moderate evidence  
• Multiple independent sources (Guardian, Econ Times) show term went viral between 24–31 Jan, implying 2 Feb sits near the back-side of a spike.  
• Upcoming political events (likely State-of-the-Union c. 4 Feb) create a non-trivial chance of a fresh Trump meme using “FAFO”, which could rekindle interest.  
Weak evidence  
• FAFO-crypto headlines; possible noise in searches but volumes tiny.  
• Generic SEO blog claims of “steady interest”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
13 days. With half the window (≈1 week) the decay pattern would look sharper and boost “Decreases”; doubled (≈1 month) mean reversion is largely complete and noise could make “Doesn’t change” likelier.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside view) 31/28/41.  
Adjustments:  
+4 pp to “Decreases” – Post-viral decay pattern is strong; Feb 2 likely above eventual baseline; ±3 band narrow.  
–3 pp from “Doesn’t change” – ordinary weekday/weekend oscillations usually exceed 3 points.  
–1 pp from “Increases” – chance of renewed political meme, but no concrete evidence yet.  
Net inside-view probabilities:

Probability calibration  
Increases……30  
Doesn’t change…25  
Decreases……45  
(sums to 100)

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Options understood; resolution ±3 points.  
2. Outside view 31/28/41, anchored to meme decay class.  
3. Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Doesn’t change? (actually second-least); consistency OK.  
4. Key evidence: a) late-Jan viral peak; b) typical spike-and-decay; c) narrow ±3 band; d) possible SOTU trigger.  
5. Blind spot: Trump repeats “FAFO” in SOTU or Super Bowl ad → sharp renewed spike; would shift probabilities toward “Increases.”  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, 0–100 scale.

Probabilities: [30, 25, 45]
