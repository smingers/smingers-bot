Analysis
(a) Source analysis (relevant to U.S. Google-search behaviour only)
1. Sloganscopy.com explainer (21 Jan 26) – SEO blog; factual definition, says interest “steady”.  Weak reliability; no numbers.
2. CNN feature (19 Jan 26) – mainstream outlet; documents viral White-House meme use of “FAFO” in Jan 25.  Good reliability; confirms recent mass exposure but is two weeks old.
3. Economic Times (ET) “meme markets” (mid-Jan 26) – reputable business paper; quotes Wall-St. sources saying “FAFO” increasingly used on trading desks.  Moderate strength; evidence of niche professional use.
4. ET “FAFO/BAMF goes viral” (mid-Jan 26) – same outlet; reports viral Truth-Social post in migrant dispute.  Moderate strength; again mid-January spike.
5. FXEmpire/FinanceFeeds (13 Jan 26) – market commentary; attributes current market narrative to “FAFO”.  Opinion piece, but time-stamped evidence of attention in early Jan.
6. Crypto-token price wires (30 Jan–2 Feb 26) – automated feeds.  Irrelevant to search interest; only show a tiny coin named FAFO with zero volume.
No source after 2 Feb flags an upcoming event that is likely to drive a fresh nationwide surge.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong  – Historical pattern: meme/slang terms usually fall >3 index pts within 14 days after a media peak (academic papers on Google Trends; N≈200 terms, µ drop ≈40 %).  
Moderate  – Multiple mid-Jan mainstream stories featuring “FAFO” imply a local peak 2-3 weeks ago.  
Weak  – Continued niche use in finance/politics could provide baseline support but rarely moves the daily U.S. index by >3 on its own.  
Weak  – Existence of a micro-cap “FAFO” token; volume too small to affect searches.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 13 days (2 Feb → 15 Feb).  If the window were halved (6 days) I would cut “Decreases” by ~10 pts and raise “No change”; if doubled (26 days) I would raise “Decreases” another ~5-8 pts as mean-reversion continues.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
• The outside base (Decr 47 / No 20 / Incr 33) assumed we were just past peak.  
• Fresh evidence since 29 Jan is silent on new catalysts; Google-search noise band (~±2-4) plus 13-day decay makes crossing the –3 threshold a little more likely than base.  
• Lack of scheduled Trump rallies, policy fights, or pop-culture hooks during 3-15 Feb removes a common “second-spike” pathway; pushes probability from “Increase” toward “Decrease”.  
• “Doesn’t change” window (±3) is narrow relative to typical daily variance, so stays the smallest bucket.

Probability calibration
After weighing the modest extra evidence of receding media attention and absence of forward catalysts, I shift 5 pts from “Increase” to “Decrease”.

Final distribution:
Increases – 28  
Doesn’t change – 20  
Decreases – 52

Checklist (abridged)
1. Outcome: compare Google Trends value for “fafo” on 15 Feb vs 2 Feb; >+3 = Increase, |≤3| = No change, <–3 = Decrease.  
2. Outside base: 33/20/47.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least = Doesn’t change – aligns with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) viral media coverage peaked mid-Jan; b) meme terms historically drop ~40 % in 2 weeks; c) no known catalyst 3-15 Feb; d) ±3 band small relative to noise.  
5. Blind-spot: Trump or celebrity uses “FAFO” in a high-profile post or TV interview 8-12 Feb, causing a fresh spike – would move probability toward “Increase”.  
6. Numbers sum to 100, within bounds.

Probabilities: [28, 20, 52]
