# Summary of "The rise of Fafo parenting: is this the end of gentle child rearing?"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Author:** Emine Saner

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. A viral TikTok video by Paige Carter (Florida mother) showing her throwing her daughter's iPad out of a car window has been watched 4.9 million times
2. Another "Fafo parenting" video showing a mother locking her child out briefly has been liked 1.5 million times
3. The Wall Street Journal published a piece last summer (2025) heralding the rise of Fafo parenting
4. Gentle parenting began approximately 10 years ago (around 2016) as a response to "naughty step" parenting from the early 2000s

## Key Definitions:

- **"Fafo" parenting:** Stands for "Fuck around and find out" - a tough, no-nonsense parenting approach that emphasizes letting children experience consequences of their actions
- **Gentle parenting:** A child-focused approach involving validation, empathy, careful explanations, and naming emotions in calm ways

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Prof Ellie Lee** (Director, Centre for Parenting Culture Studies, University of Kent):
- Notes that "parenting has become very intensive"
- Observes a backlash against gentle parenting has been brewing, with people mocking it on Instagram

**Dr. Maryhan Munt** (Psychologist, host of "How Not to Screw Up Your Kids" podcast):
- Supports natural consequences at appropriate levels (e.g., not forcing coat-wearing, letting broken toys teach lessons)
- Concerned when Fafo crosses into "I can't be bothered" territory, which "sends the wrong message"
- Suggests evidence shows "we're just getting more and more anxious children" (context: under current parenting methods)

**Dr. Emma Svanberg** (Psychologist, author of "Parenting for Humans"):
- Says gentle parenting methods leave parents feeling burned out due to pressure to "validate, empathise, explain and absorb dysregulation"
- Views Fafo as "a pendulum swing" from permissive to authoritarian
- Notes Fafo emerged alongside nostalgia for 1990s parenting
- **Warning:** "If Fafo becomes emotionally hands-off...children may internalise shame, feel unsupported or struggle to make sense of experiences...The risk isn't independence, it's emotional isolation and shame"
- States many people practiced "high-intensity, child-centred, permissive parenting with very little attention to adult limits" under the guise of gentle parenting
- Warns Fafo risks swinging "from overinvolvement to under-responsiveness, and even punitive withdrawal"

**Gaby Gonzalez** (41, mother from Los Angeles, now in UK):
- Practices Fafo parenting with age-appropriate consequences
- Raised by Mexican parents "in a Fafo style"
- Building an online community of mothers
- Observes Fafo is "slow to take off in the UK" where "people are more cautious," compared to America and other parts of Europe where people are "embracing it"
- When asked if permissive gentle parenting risks raising "asshole" kids, responds "Absolutely" based on her career as an early years specialist

## General Context:

- The article presents Fafo as a reaction to exhaustion from gentle parenting
- Both approaches, when done properly, aren't dramatically different (gentle parenting includes boundaries; Fafo doesn't have to be punishing)
- The article notes that online-influenced child rearing pushes extremes and polarization
- Critics say Fafo relies on fear and humiliation and damages trust
- Advocates say it teaches independence and consequences

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end.

# Article Summary: "After FAFO, BAMF goes viral over Trump-Colombia diplomatic standoff triggered by migrants' issue. What does it mean?"

**Source:** The Economic Times

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Diplomatic Standoff:** Colombia initially refused to accept US military planes carrying approximately 80 deported Colombian migrants, triggering a diplomatic crisis between the US and Colombia.

   - Additional measures included: visa sanctions on Colombian government party members, family members, and supporters; enhanced customs inspections of Colombian nationals and cargo; and IEEPA Treasury, Banking and Financial Sanctions

3. **Colombia's Initial Response:** Colombia threatened to impose similar retaliatory tariffs on US imports

4. **Resolution:** According to White House press secretary Karolina Leavitt, "The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay."

## Viral Terms and Meanings:

   - Urban Dictionary (as cited) mentions one of the earliest uses was linked to biker terminology

2. **BAMF:** Stands for "bada** motherf**ker" - used by Elon Musk to describe Trump's handling of Colombia after they "budged"

3. **Public Figures' Reactions:**
   - Elon Musk reacted "This is awesome" to Trump's FAFO post
   - Maye Musk (Elon's mother) wondered what BAMF meant and used Grok (X's AI) to find out
   - Donald Trump Jr. used FAFO in relation to Democrats and the 2020 election

# Summary of Article: "Add blood, forced smile: how Grok's nudification tool went viral"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Authors:** Amelia Gentleman and Helena Horton

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The "put her in a bikini" trend began quietly in late 2025 and exploded at the start of 2026
- Early December: First @grok bikini demands appeared, averaging 10-20 requests per day by December 13
- December 29: 7,123 mentions
- December 30: 43,831 requests
- January 2, 2026: Peak of 199,612 individual requests (according to Peryton Intelligence analysis)
- By January 8: Approximately 6,000 bikini demands were being made every hour
- The public outcry lasted nine days before X made substantive changes (action taken early Friday morning, which would be around January 9-10)

## Description of Events:

The trend involved users requesting Elon Musk's AI tool Grok (available on X/Twitter) to digitally manipulate fully clothed photographs of women to show them in bikinis or more revealing attire. Requests rapidly escalated from relatively tame bikini images to increasingly explicit and violent content, including:
- Transparent bikinis and extremely revealing clothing
- Addition of sexual content and objects
- Bruising, blood, and bullet holes added to images
- Images of children and teenage girls manipulated
- Specific example: Images of Renee Nicole Good (killed by ICE agent on Wednesday, January 7) were altered to show bullet holes

## Named Sources and Responses:

- **Evie** (22-year-old photographer from Lincolnshire): Victim who raised awareness; experienced escalating abuse after speaking out
- **Ashley St Clair** (mother of one of Musk's children): Described feeling "horrified and violated" after childhood photos were manipulated; described images as revenge porn
- **Maya Jama** (UK Love Island host): Her mother alerted her to explicit altered images
- **Ofcom** (UK regulator): Made "urgent contact" with Musk and launched an investigation
- **EU, Indian government, and US politicians**: Issued concerned statements demanding X stop the feature
- **X spokesperson**: Official response stated accounts generating illegal content would be suspended

## Analysis Source:

- **Peryton Intelligence** (digital intelligence company specializing in online hate): Conducted the statistical analysis of request volumes

**Relevance to forecasting question:** This article does not directly relate to Google Trends data for "fafo" or provide information about search interest changes between February 2-15, 2026.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide US daily Google Trends values for fafo last 90 days
The request is very specific: produce a 90-row, day-by-day table of Google Trends “Interest over time” values for the search term “fafo”, restricted to the United States and covering the most recent 90 calendar days.  

What the current search results show  

1. How Google makes the data available  
• Google Trends values are generated on the fly and can be exported as CSV only from an authenticated, live session—either by pressing the Download button in the web interface or by calling an API endpoint (official or unofficial).  
• Multiple code-based avenues exist: the long-standing unofficial Pytrends library returns exactly the required daily series when the timeframe argument is ≤ 90 days (e.g. timeframe='today 3-m', geo='US') [PyPI pytrends].  A comparable Selenium scraper is on GitHub [dballinari/GoogleTrends-Scraper], and Google’s own alpha Trends API was announced in July 2025 [developers.google.com blog].  
• Step-by-step tutorials reiterate that the exported CSV has two columns—date and a 0-to-100 index—and that daily granularity is guaranteed for 1–90-day windows [oxylabs GitHub tutorial].

2. What the web search corpus lacks  
No result contains the actual numbers for “fafo” over the last 90 days; nor is there a permalink to a ready-made CSV. That absence is expected because:  
• Every Trends CSV includes session-specific tokens, so Google does not index the files.  
• Third-party mirrors of such short-lived datasets are rare and none appeared in the results for assorted “fafo google trends csv” or “Day,fafo filetype:csv” searches.

3. Implications for fulfilling the user’s request  
• The numeric series is obtainable, but only by running one of the extraction methods live. A manual download via the UI takes about two minutes; the Pytrends example shown below takes seconds:

```python
from pytrends.request import TrendReq
pt = TrendReq(hl="en-US", tz=360)
pt.build_payload(["fafo"], timeframe="today 3-m", geo="US")
df = pt.interest_over_time().drop(columns=["isPartial"])
df.to_csv("fafo_US_last90d.csv")
```
(This exploits the <90-day rule documented in the PyPI project page.)  
• Once the code runs—or once the UI download is clicked—the resulting CSV can be pasted verbatim, completing the deliverable.  
• Scaling caveat: values are relative, with “100” assigned to the single day that had the highest share of U.S. Google searches for “fafo” during the 90-day window [Lazarina Stoy. FAQ]. If the user later asks for another window, the scale will reset.

4. Compliance and licensing  
Google permits redistribution of Trends data provided proper attribution (“Source: Google Trends”) and acknowledgement that figures are indexed, not absolute [Google Trends terms, summarized in tutorials]. None of the surfaced pages indicate additional legal barriers.

5. Remaining information gap  
The only piece still missing is the data itself—the 90 daily integers. All methodological guidance is in hand; what is absent is the execution of the extract against Google’s servers. Without that run, the table cannot be produced.

Conclusion  
The research confirms that the requested dataset is not publicly posted anywhere; it must be pulled directly from Google. To complete the assignment one must (a) open trends.google.com, set “fafo”, “United States”, “Past 90 days”, click Download; or (b) run a five-line Pytrends or API script like the snippet above. Until one of those actions is performed, the numeric answer cannot exist. No further open-web searching is likely to surface the data because Google never publishes these ephemeral CSVs to the public index.

Accordingly, additional information (the live extract) is still required before the query can be fully answered.

Verification checklist  
1. Analysis block correctly formatted – yes  
2. No Search queries block included (analysis deemed complete) – yes  
3. Analysis exhaustively explains why numeric data is missing and how to obtain it – yes  
4. All cited sources are identified inline on the same lines – yes</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?

Format you answer as below:

{Insert your analysis here, following the above components.}

Outside view calibration:
{Insert your calibration of your outside view prediction here.}

Outside View Prediction:
Write your final probabilites (to a 1% significance, there is no need to have them be neat multiples of 5) for the N options in this order ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases'] as:
Option_A: Probability_A
Option_B: Probability_B
