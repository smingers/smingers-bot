Analysis:
The Google Trends series for slang terms like “fafo” (“fuck around and find out”) is typically quiet most of the year, punctuated by sudden spikes when a meme, song lyric, or sports-related quote goes viral. Over the last twelve months “fafo” has shown three such bursts (May-2025, September-2025, and late-January-2026), each peaking near 100 and then retracing toward the long-run baseline in the 15-30 range within about two weeks. Because the most recent peak appears to have occurred around 26-27 Jan 2026 (per the current 30-day chart) and the value has already fallen to 26 on 1 Feb, the outside-view expectation is a continued fade rather than a renewed rally—unless another exogenous meme drives attention. Daily volatility for this term is usually ±5–10 points, so a further 4-point drop by 15 Feb is more likely than a 4-point rise or a flat reading.
