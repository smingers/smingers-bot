Google has also introduced a grace period: users may download or delete their Fitbit data\u2014including activity history, health metrics, and long-term trends\u2014until July 15, 2026, after which data deletion will begin. The extension indicates Google's ongoing effort to transition users without abrupt enforcement. The company has confirmed that access to Fitbit-only accounts will be cut off regardless of device usage.

The company is set to release its Q4 2025 and full-year 2025 financial results on February 24, 2026, after the U.S. market close. This report will serve as a key indicator of whether the expanded portfolio delivers the promised operational stability and diversification. Investors are assessing the efficiency of the integration process, particularly whether the AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations) contribution from Spirit Realty Capital\u2019s assets meets expectations. The broader outlook remains challenging due to the sensitivity of the triple-net lease real estate sector to interest rate movements\u2014rising or sustained high financing costs could hinder the company\u2019s acquisition-driven growth strategy. Additionally, operational performance in retail and industrial sectors is under scrutiny, as shifts in consumer behavior or declining industrial demand could negatively impact lease renewals and property valuations. The February 24, 2026, release is expected to clarify these trends and shape market expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. According to a February 1, 2026, analysis by Aktien Check, Spirit Realty Capital\u2019s latest financials indicate urgent action is needed for shareholders, raising questions about whether to buy or sell the stock.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:35 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Realty_Income_Aktie_Integration_Fokus-19424927)\n\n**Energy, Savings, and Fees: What Changes on February 1**\nStarting Sunday, February 1, 2026, several new pricing changes take effect in France affecting energy, banking, and savings. Electricity bills are expected to slightly decrease due to a reduction in one of the taxes included in all subscriptions, resulting in an estimated annual saving of 10 euros per household. Similarly, gas bills will also drop as global prices decline. However, savings products face a setback: the interest rate on the Livret A, the most popular savings account in France, will fall from 1.7% to 1.5%, and the Livret d'\u00c9pargne Populaire (LEP) rate will drop from 2.7% to 2.5%, both due to declining inflation. This has led some, like Lo\u00efc, a commercial manager, to shift toward riskier investments such as cryptocurrency and real estate projects, stating he no longer relies on the Livret A for reliable returns. Meanwhile, banking fees are increasing by an average of 3%, a trend noted by Renaud, who finds the cost excessive and unjustified, especially without corresponding improvements in services. Finally, toll prices across France will rise by an average of 0.86%, the smallest increase since 2021.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:46 PM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.franceinfo.fr/economie/livrets-gaz-electricite-ce-qui-change-au-1er-fevrier_7778156.html)\n\n**What Changes Await French Citizens Starting February 1, 2026?**\nThe podcast hosted by Maxime Lledo and Philippe Crevel discusses key changes expected to take effect for French citizens starting February 1, 2026. The primary financial change involves a reduction in the interest rate on the Livret A from 1.7% to 1.5%, driven by an inflation rate of 0.9% in 2025 and prevailing interest rate trends. The hosts emphasize the need for French savers to diversify their investments, highlighting life insurance (assurance-vie) with euro funds offering around 2.7% capital guarantees. Additionally, electricity bills will decrease by 9 \u20ac annually due to the removal of a tax funding energy sector retirements. Gas bills are also expected to drop, linked to global gas price declines. Meanwhile, toll fees will rise by 0.5% to 1% depending on the concession, but at a slower pace than previously observed.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:05 AM\nSource:[Sud Radio](https://www.sudradio.fr/emission/sud-radio-vous-explique-1034)\n\n**Is the patent office becoming more patent-friendly?**\nThe U.S. patent system has shown a measurable shift toward being more favorable to patent owners, particularly in post-grant proceedings such as inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR), which are administered by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). From 2011 to 2024, IPR institution rates remained stable in the mid-60% range, peaking at approximately 68% in fiscal year 2024. Historically, once instituted, IPR and PGR proceedings resulted in the invalidation of 65\u201375% of challenged claims, leading to the PTAB being labeled a 'patent death squad.' However, a significant policy shift began on March 26, 2025, when the USPTO formalized discretionary denials\u2014decisions not to institute proceedings even when statutory thresholds are met. From January 21 to March 23, 2025, 31% of denials were discretionary, but this rose to 59% from March 26 to April 30, 2025, and to 77% from May 1 to July 1, 2025. By September 2025, institution rates had declined to approximately 35% due to increased discretionary denials. In January 2026, the USPTO designated several PTAB decisions on discretionary denial as precedential and informative, establishing binding guidance on factors such as parallel district court litigation timing (under the Fintiv framework), serial petitions, and procedural compliance, including real-party-in-interest disclosure. These changes have shifted leverage toward patent owners at the institution stage, although the PTAB remains a high-risk forum for challenged claims. The trend indicates a strategic effort to reduce the number of proceedings initiated while maintaining rigorous scrutiny on those that proceed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2026/02/01/patent-office-more-friendly.html)\n\n**The Safe-Haven Value Falters Amid Geopolitical Shifts and Economic Rebalancing**\nHouseholds are seeking alternatives to maximize their savings amid significant geopolitical shifts. Traditional safe-haven assets, which had reached historic highs, are showing signs of instability as uncertainty around the U.S. presidency and the Federal Reserve's direction subsides. Kevin Warsh, Donald Trump\u2019s chosen successor to Jerome Powell as Fed chair, helped stabilize the U.S. dollar with a more technical profile, leading to a rebound in the dollar and a decline in traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver. Bitcoin continues its downward trend, failing to prove its status as a refuge asset. Meanwhile, improved liquidity expectations have driven the Euribor lower, ending a five-month streak of increases since the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained interest rates near 2%. This offers a slight relief for mortgage holders and those seeking affordable financing, with inflation under control and no immediate signs of rate changes\u2014though the ECB\u2019s upcoming meeting will determine the next move. In Spain, the economy grew by 2.8% in 2025, though momentum is slowing compared to 2024, with household consumption and investment remaining key drivers. E-commerce has become a standard channel for purchases and services, but consumer complaints are rising\u2014particularly over delayed refunds, long wait times for size exchanges, and defective products. The Spanish Congress rejected the decree for pension increases in 2026, leaving the government to maneuver to secure a 2.7% revaluation in February\u2019s pension payments to protect the purchasing power of over nine million pensioners. Despite fears that AI may displace qualified workers, U.S. data shows that professions most exposed to AI are still growing strongly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:34 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/dinero/bolsillo/20260201/11454515/mercados-valores-refugio-trump.html)\n\n**Fitbit extends Google Account deadline to May 2026, with data deleted shortly after**\nGoogle has extended the deadline for Fitbit users to transition from standalone Fitbit accounts to Google Accounts to May 19, 2026, up from the previous date of February 2, 2026. After this date, users will no longer be able to access their Fitbit accounts unless they migrate to a Google Account. The migration process is quick and results in no data loss. Existing Fitbit account holders can still download their data anytime before July 15, 2026, after which the data will be permanently deleted.

The 'buy America' narrative gained traction, driving the US dollar higher and boosting stock indices\u2014particularly the DAX, which rose due to increased military spending and strong performance in defensive stocks like Rheinmetall, which surged over 20% in 2026 and approximately 150% from 2025. Geopolitical tensions escalated with the US seizing Venezuelan President Maduro and a Russian oil tanker, fueling demand for defensive assets such as gold, silver, the Swiss franc, and Japanese yen (despite yen depreciation from carry trade activity despite rising 30-year bond yields). This shift is attributed to a 'FAFO' narrative\u2014President Trump\u2019s intervention in the oil market and disruption of global geopolitical stability. The January 13, 2026, Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report showed a 50,000 job increase, below the projected 70,000, initially pressuring the US dollar, but it recovered to close the day in the green. Gold fluctuated but ended the day positive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 09:21 AM\nSource:[FXEmpire.com](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/fafo-narrative-drives-the-markets-in-2026-1572468)\n\n**\u201cFAFO\u201d narrative drives the markets in 2026 - FinanceFeeds**\nIn early January 2026, financial markets showed bullish momentum in gold and stock indices, particularly the DAX, driven by a resurgence of the 'buy America' narrative and rising geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. and Venezuela, including the seizure of President Maduro and a Russian oil tanker. Defensive stocks such as Rheinmetall rose over 20% in 2026 and nearly 150% since 2025, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) gained 4.5% on Friday. This shift has fueled demand for safe-haven assets like gold, silver, the Swiss franc, and Japanese yen\u2014though the yen was pressured by carry trade activity despite rising 30-year U.S. bond yields. The term 'FAFO' (Foreign Affairs, Foreign Oil) has emerged to describe President Trump\u2019s intervention in the oil market and its destabilizing effect on global geopolitics. The U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday showed a 50k increase, below the anticipated 70k, initially pressuring the dollar, but it closed the day in green. Gold also closed positively despite wobbling. Despite the weaker NFP, traders do not expect rate cuts at the upcoming FOMC meetings in January or March, with odds of rate stability increasing according to the FedWatch Tool. U.S. 30-year bond yields declined slightly, providing limited support for the dollar. The next key event is the U.S. CPI report on Tuesday, expected to show cooling inflation, though already priced in. Gold (XAUUSD) is in a strong seasonal uptrend window, having bounced off the 20-day moving average\u2014a key dynamic support\u2014indicating bullish momentum with no overbought signals, as it remains below prior all-time highs and the Bollinger Band upper band. The S&P 500 has lagged behind the DAX, with tech stocks underperforming compared to financial and industrial sectors. However, defensive and energy stocks are regaining strength post-escalation. Earnings from major financial firms like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock starting January 12 may influence market direction. The S&P 500 is expected to open flat, with potential acceleration later in the week as more data\u2014especially CPI and corporate earnings\u2014becomes available.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[financefeeds.com](https://financefeeds.com/fafo-narrative-drives-the-markets-in-2026/)\n\n**Council of Federation Approves Law to Increase Maximum Microloan Amount for Legal Entities**\nThe Russian Council of Federation approved a law on December 19, 2025, increasing the maximum microloan amount for legal entities and individual entrepreneurs from 5 million to 15 million rubles, effective April 1, 2026. The law also introduces stricter requirements for microfinance organizations (MFOs). The initiative was proposed by senators Anatoly Artamonov, Mukhambiy Ulbashev, Alexander Shenderyuk-Zhidkov, Vladimir Dzhabarov, Galina Karelova, and deputies of the State Duma. The change aims to modernize the outdated 2018 limit, expand access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), develop the domestic capital market, and meet market demand. Additionally, the law reduces the maximum interest rate on loans up to one year from 130% to 100% starting April 1, 2026. A transition period begins October 2026, during which MFOs cannot issue more than two loans to a client with a total cost exceeding 200% annually. From April 1, 2027, MFOs will be prohibited from issuing more than one loan to an individual with a total cost above 100% annually. Starting January 1, 2027, MFOs may not enter into new consumer loan agreements with individuals until four days after fully repaying a previous loan or credit with a total cost exceeding 100%. The Bank of Russia\u2019s board may adjust this threshold in case of significant market changes. Furthermore, MFOs are banned from restructuring consumer loan obligations via novation or adding unpaid interest, penalties, or other fees to the principal debt. These measures aim to protect borrowers and regulate the MFO sector.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 08:06 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/25960619)\n\n**CBRF Expects Continued Decline in MFO Market Profits in 2026 Amid Regulatory Reforms**\nThe Central Bank of Russia (CBRF) expects the trend of declining net profit for microfinance organizations (MFOs) to continue in 2026, according to Nikita Akimov, Deputy Director of the Department of Non-Bank Lending at the CBRF. He cited three upcoming reforms as key drivers: socialization measures (reducing interest rates and the number of loans held by individuals), the introduction of a Unified Biometric System (EBS), and the implementation of official income verification for calculating macroprudential limits. Akimov noted that companies already preparing for the official income requirement are experiencing reduced profitability due to significant investments in technology and operations. He stated that this trend is likely to persist into 2026, although no specific profit percentage forecast was provided. Data from the first nine months of 2025 already show a slight cooling in the MFO market, attributed to POS loan regulations and macroprudential limits on auto-loans. In the first half of 2025, MFO profits declined by 5% year-on-year, with more than half of companies reporting reduced net profit compared to the same period in 2024, totaling 25 billion rubles. A draft law, effective from July 1, 2026, to January 1, 2027, will prohibit MFOs from issuing loans with a total cost exceeding 200% annually to clients with two or more outstanding loans above 200% annually. From January 1, 2027, MFOs will be barred from issuing loans with a total cost above 100% annually to clients with existing debts above 100% annually, with a mandatory three-day waiting period after debt repayment before a new loan can be issued. The CBRF retains the authority to adjust the cost-of-credit cap under significant market changes. Additionally, the maximum total cost of consumer loans and short-term loans (up to one year) will be reduced from 130% to 100% annually.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/1060032)\n\n**State Duma Approves Stricter Rules for Microloans**\nThe State Duma has approved in first reading a new law that will tighten regulations on microloans from non-bank financial organizations (MFOs). Starting July 1, 2026, individuals will be limited to no more than two high-interest loans (over 200% annual interest). From January 1, 2027, only one such loan with interest above 100% annually will be allowed. A new rule requires a four-day waiting period after repaying a loan before taking out a new one. The maximum loan overpayment will be reduced from 130% to 100% annually. The law aims to prevent people from falling into debt traps, as many borrowers take new loans to repay old ones, leading to spiraling debt. The proposed changes are intended to break this cycle. Additionally, the maximum microloan amount for entrepreneurs will increase from 5 million \u20bd to 15 million \u20bd, to improve access to financing for small businesses. The regulator suggests slightly adjusting the implementation timeline: the two-high-interest-loan limit will take effect on September 1, 2026; the one-loan rule and the four-day waiting period will begin on March 1, 2027; and the increased loan limit for businesses will start on March 1, 2026. The law is being promoted as a measure to protect consumers while supporting small business development.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[Fishki.net - \u0421\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f](https://fishki.net/4928435-gosduma-odobrila-uzhestochenie-vydachi-mikrozajmov.html)\n\n**Online search interest in advisors sets record, reveals investor fear**\nGoogle Trends data shows a sharp rise in online search interest for financial advisors, peaking at 62 in the weeks before President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement and reaching a new record in August 2025. The trend reflects investors\u2019 growing concern amid market volatility, with a 2022 SmartAsset study indicating that over half of advisors cited stock\u2011market volatility as the main reason clients sought advice. Associate director Andrew Blake of Cerulli Associates notes that \u201ceverything sort of seems to be in chaos when it comes to rates and trade,\u201d and that this confusion drives investors to seek professional guidance. Data from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) and the Financial Advisor Confidence Outlook (FACO) show that individual investors\u2019 bearish sentiment tracks closely with advisor search interest, whereas advisors\u2019 outlooks are less correlated. The VIX index, measuring expected near\u2011term volatility, correlates moderately with advisor search interest, sitting between retail sentiment and advisor views. Filip Telibasa, owner of Benzina Wealth, explains that conflicting opinions on social media fuel uncertainty for retail investors, prompting more to contact advisors. Telibasa\u2019s own experience illustrates how improving online presence\u2014adding a direct calendar link and reducing friction\u2014can convert search interest into booked meetings, with his appointment volume growing from near zero to one or two per week. The article suggests that advisors who effectively position themselves online can capitalize on the heightened demand for professional financial guidance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:37 PM\nSource:[Financial Planning](https://www.financial-planning.com/news/financial-advisor-searches-hit-new-high-amid-surging-demand)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
