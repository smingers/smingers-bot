The Wall Street Journal published a piece last summer (2025) heralding the rise of Fafo parenting\n4.

Requests rapidly escalated from relatively tame bikini images to increasingly explicit and violent content, including:\n- Transparent bikinis and extremely revealing clothing\n- Addition of sexual content and objects\n- Bruising, blood, and bullet holes added to images\n- Images of children and teenage girls manipulated\n- Specific example: Images of Renee Nicole Good (killed by ICE agent on Wednesday, January 7) were altered to show bullet holes\n\n## Named Sources and Responses:\n\n- **Evie** (22-year-old photographer from Lincolnshire): Victim who raised awareness; experienced escalating abuse after speaking out\n- **Ashley St Clair** (mother of one of Musk's children): Described feeling \"horrified and violated\" after childhood photos were manipulated; described images as revenge porn\n- **Maya Jama** (UK Love Island host): Her mother alerted her to explicit altered images\n- **Ofcom** (UK regulator): Made \"urgent contact\" with Musk and launched an investigation\n- **EU, Indian government, and US politicians**: Issued concerned statements demanding X stop the feature\n- **X spokesperson**: Official response stated accounts generating illegal content would be suspended\n\n## Analysis Source:\n\n- **Peryton Intelligence** (digital intelligence company specializing in online hate): Conducted the statistical analysis of request volumes\n\n**Relevance to forecasting question:** This article does not directly relate to Google Trends data for \"fafo\" or provide information about search interest changes between February 2-15, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide US daily Google Trends values for fafo last 90 days\nThe request is very specific: produce a 90-row, day-by-day table of Google Trends \u201cInterest over time\u201d values for the search term \u201cfafo\u201d, restricted to the United States and covering the most recent 90 calendar days.  \n\nWhat the current search results show  \n\n1. How Google makes the data available  \n\u2022 Google Trends values are generated on the fly and can be exported as CSV only from an authenticated, live session\u2014either by pressing the Download button in the web interface or by calling an API endpoint (official or unofficial).  \n\u2022 Multiple code-based avenues exist: the long-standing unofficial Pytrends library returns exactly the required daily series when the timeframe argument is \u2264 90 days (e.g. timeframe='today 3-m', geo='US') [PyPI pytrends].  A comparable Selenium scraper is on GitHub [dballinari/GoogleTrends-Scraper], and Google\u2019s own alpha Trends API was announced in July 2025 [developers.google.com blog].  \n\u2022 Step-by-step tutorials reiterate that the exported CSV has two columns\u2014date and a 0-to-100 index\u2014and that daily granularity is guaranteed for 1\u201390-day windows [oxylabs GitHub tutorial].\n\n2. What the web search corpus lacks  \nNo result contains the actual numbers for \u201cfafo\u201d over the last 90 days; nor is there a permalink to a ready-made CSV. That absence is expected because:  \n\u2022 Every Trends CSV includes session-specific tokens, so Google does not index the files.  \n\u2022 Third-party mirrors of such short-lived datasets are rare and none appeared in the results for assorted \u201cfafo google trends csv\u201d or \u201cDay,fafo filetype:csv\u201d searches.\n\n3. Implications for fulfilling the user\u2019s request  \n\u2022 The numeric series is obtainable, but only by running one of the extraction methods live. A manual download via the UI takes about two minutes; the Pytrends example shown below takes seconds:\n\n```python\nfrom pytrends.request import TrendReq\npt = TrendReq(hl=\"en-US\", tz=360)\npt.build_payload([\"fafo\"], timeframe=\"today 3-m\", geo=\"US\")\ndf = pt.interest_over_time().drop(columns=[\"isPartial\"])\ndf.to_csv(\"fafo_US_last90d.csv\")\n```\n(This exploits the <90-day rule documented in the PyPI project page.)  \n\u2022 Once the code runs\u2014or once the UI download is clicked\u2014the resulting CSV can be pasted verbatim, completing the deliverable.  \n\u2022 Scaling caveat: values are relative, with \u201c100\u201d assigned to the single day that had the highest share of U.S. Google searches for \u201cfafo\u201d during the 90-day window [Lazarina Stoy. FAQ]. If the user later asks for another window, the scale will reset.\n\n4. Compliance and licensing  \nGoogle permits redistribution of Trends data provided proper attribution (\u201cSource: Google Trends\u201d) and acknowledgement that figures are indexed, not absolute [Google Trends terms, summarized in tutorials]. None of the surfaced pages indicate additional legal barriers.\n\n5. Remaining information gap  \nThe only piece still missing is the data itself\u2014the 90 daily integers. All methodological guidance is in hand; what is absent is the execution of the extract against Google\u2019s servers. Without that run, the table cannot be produced.\n\nConclusion  \nThe research confirms that the requested dataset is not publicly posted anywhere; it must be pulled directly from Google. To complete the assignment one must (a) open trends.google.com, set \u201cfafo\u201d, \u201cUnited States\u201d, \u201cPast 90 days\u201d, click Download; or (b) run a five-line Pytrends or API script like the snippet above. Until one of those actions is performed, the numeric answer cannot exist. No further open-web searching is likely to surface the data because Google never publishes these ephemeral CSVs to the public index.\n\nAccordingly, additional information (the live extract) is still required before the query can be fully answered.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1. Analysis block correctly formatted \u2013 yes  \n2. No Search queries block included (analysis deemed complete) \u2013 yes  \n3. Analysis exhaustively explains why numeric data is missing and how to obtain it \u2013 yes  \n4. All cited sources are identified inline on the same lines \u2013 yes</Agent_report>\n"
