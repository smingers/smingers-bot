Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**WIRED (Dec 10, 2024):** High-quality technology/culture publication documenting the immediate aftermath of Mangione's arrest. Key facts: merchandise proliferation within hours, social media account shutdowns/restorations, fan fiction emergence. The Network Contagion Research Institute quote is from an identified expert source. Date is ~14 months before the prediction window.

**Out of My Gord (Dec 17, 2024):** Personal blog/commentary site with lower journalistic rigor. Provides useful metrics (X followers growing to 500k, $130k defense fund) but mixes facts with editorial opinion. The NCRI quote is repeated from other sources. Date is ~14 months old.

**Livemint (Feb 25, 2025):** Reputable Indian business publication. Critical factual content: Google search spikes after Feb 21, 2025 court appearance (1,400% for "loafers," 350% for "outfits"). This establishes a clear pattern of court-appearance-driven interest spikes. Date is ~11 months before prediction window.

**CNN (Jan 30, 2026):** Tier-1 news source, highly reliable. Key facts: Judge Garnett dismissed death penalty charge on Jan 30, 2026 (3 days before prediction window opens). Trial dates scheduled (federal: Sept 8, 2026; state pushing for July 2026). This is the most temporally relevant source.

**ABC7 Chicago (Jan 31, 2026):** Reliable local news affiliate. Critical fact: Unexpected court summons for **February 6, 2026** - this falls within our prediction window (Feb 2-15). This is a major catalyst that could drive interest.

**NBC News (Jan 30, 2026):** Tier-1 source. Confirms Jan 30 ruling details, mentions supporters viewing Mangione as "folk hero," notes cheering in courthouse. Establishes ongoing public interest baseline.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis identifying six major spikes over 12 months tied to: court appearances (Feb 21, 2025; Apr 25, 2025; Dec 1, 2025; Jan 30, 2026), legal rulings (Sept 2025), and fashion virality (Feb 2025). Projects potential catalysts Feb 2-15: prosecution appeal decision, TV coverage, protests, documentary promotion. Quality is good for pattern identification but speculative on future events.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **High-profile criminal defendants' Google Trends patterns** - Most suitable. Cases like Tsarnaev, Rittenhouse, Heard/Depp show episodic spikes around court dates, then decay between events.
2. **Viral "folk hero" figures** - Less suitable; most don't have ongoing legal proceedings driving periodic interest.
3. **True crime subject interest decay** - Partially suitable; shows general downward trend but doesn't account for legal catalysts.

**Selected reference class:** High-profile criminal defendants with ongoing legal proceedings and significant public support/controversy.

Pattern: Interest spikes sharply around court appearances/rulings (100-300% increases lasting 2-7 days), then decays 60-80% over subsequent weeks until the next catalyst.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** Feb 2-15, 2026 (13 days)
**Key temporal factors:**
- Feb 2 is 3 days after major ruling (Jan 30) - typically still in elevated-interest tail
- Feb 6 court appearance is confirmed - falls exactly in middle of window
- Historical pattern shows court appearances drive 1,400% spikes (Feb 21, 2025) or significant multi-day elevations

**Historical comparison:**
- Post-ruling periods (after Sept 2025, after Jan 30, 2026): Interest remains elevated 3-7 days, then begins decay
- Court appearance days (Feb 21, 2025; Apr 25, 2025; Dec 1, 2025): Massive same-day/next-day spikes
- Between-event periods: Steady decline to baseline

**Critical insight:** The Feb 6 court date means we're comparing:
- Feb 2 value: 3 days post-ruling (likely elevated but declining)
- Feb 15 value: 9 days post-court appearance (likely in decay phase)

The question is whether Feb 15 will be higher, similar (±3), or lower than Feb 2.

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view strongly suggests **"Increases"** is most likely:

1. **Established pattern:** Every documented court appearance in the past year has produced a significant Google Trends spike. The Feb 21, 2025 appearance generated 1,400% increases in related searches.

2. **Timing dynamics:** 
   - Feb 2 (baseline): 3 days after Jan 30 ruling - interest elevated but declining from peak
   - Feb 6: Unexpected court appearance (per ABC7) - will drive major spike
   - Feb 15 (comparison point): 9 days after court appearance - likely still elevated above Feb 2 baseline

3. **Unexpected nature amplifies effect:** The ABC7 article emphasizes this Feb 6 appearance is "unexpected" and "notification did not specify a reason" - mystery/surprise typically amplifies media coverage and search interest.

4. **Multiple reinforcing factors:** Agent report identifies TV coverage (Feb 4, 11), potential protests (Feb 3-4, 10), documentary promotion (Feb 17 release means Feb 5-12 promotional push) - all additive to court-driven spike.

5. **Decay pattern works in favor of increase:** Even if Feb 2 is somewhat elevated from Jan 30 ruling, the Feb 6 court appearance will create a fresh, larger spike that should still be elevated on Feb 15.

**Key risk to "Increases" prediction:** If Feb 2 happens to capture a very high point from Jan 30 ruling AND Feb 6 appearance is anticlimactic (brief, procedural) AND Feb 15 captures full decay, we could see "Doesn't change" or even "Decreases." However, this requires multiple unfavorable coincidences.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True probability calibration:**
I must avoid overconfidence. While the pattern strongly favors an increase, unexpected outcomes happen. The ±3 threshold for "Doesn't change" is narrow - only 6-7 points of separation between outcomes on a 0-100 scale.

**(b) Established distributions:**
Looking at the six documented spikes over 12 months:
- 6/6 court appearances produced increases from pre-event baselines
- Typical spike magnitude: 200-1,400% depending on event significance
- Decay rates: 60-80% loss over 2-3 weeks post-spike

This suggests court appearances have ~100% reliability as interest drivers, but timing within the decay curve matters critically.

**(c) Small probability differences matter:**
- 70% vs 80% represents 7:3 odds vs 4:1 odds - substantially different
- Given the Feb 6 catalyst is confirmed and falls mid-window, confidence should be high but not extreme
- The ±3 threshold means we need Feb 15 to be >3 points higher than Feb 2, not just "higher"

**(d) Rate of upsets:**
In the reference class of high-profile legal cases:
- Court-driven spikes are highly reliable (~90%+ occurrence rate)
- However, magnitude and duration vary significantly
- Procedural hearings sometimes produce muted responses (~10-15% of cases)
- The "unexpected" nature of Feb 6 appearance cuts both ways: could be major development OR brief procedural matter

**Calibration reasoning:**
- Base rate for court appearance driving increase: ~85%
- Feb 6 timing (middle of window) favorable: +5%
- Multiple supporting factors (TV, protests): +3%
- Risk of anticlimactic hearing: -5%
- Risk Feb 2 captures unusual high point: -3%
- Narrow ±3 threshold creates edge cases: -5%

**Final calibration:** ~80% for Increases, ~12% for Doesn't change, ~8% for Decreases

The "Decreases" scenario requires Feb 6 to be a non-event AND Feb 15 to capture deep decay - unlikely but possible if the hearing is extremely brief/procedural.

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 79%
Doesn't change: 13%
Decreases: 8%
