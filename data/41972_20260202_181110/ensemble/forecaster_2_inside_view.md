Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Historical Context Sources (Jan 30 - Feb 1, 2026):**

1. **CNN (Jan 30, 2026)**: Tier-1 U.S. news outlet. Reports federal judge dismissed death penalty charge; Mangione still faces life imprisonment. Factual reporting with direct quotes from judge and attorney. High reliability.

2. **NBC News (Jan 30, 2026)**: Tier-1 national network. Confirms CNN facts, adds context about public support and "folk hero" status. Mentions supporters cheering in courthouse. Factual with some characterization of public sentiment.

3. **ABC7 (Jan 31, 2026)**: Local ABC affiliate. Reports unexpected Feb 6 state court summons with no stated reason. Factual, brief, high reliability for procedural information.

4. **BBC (Jan 30, 2026)**: International tier-1 outlet. Confirms death penalty ruling, adds detail about evidence admissibility and separate incident (fake FBI agent attempt). Factual, comprehensive.

5. **Multiple international sources (TIME, Rolling Stone, PEOPLE, AFP, Terra, etc.)**: All confirm same Jan 30 ruling. Consistent factual core across sources. Rolling Stone adds defense team criticism of AG Bondi; PEOPLE notes trial date (Oct 2026).

**Key Factual Consensus (Jan 30-31, 2026):**
- Death penalty dismissed Jan 30
- Unexpected state court hearing scheduled Feb 6
- Federal trial: jury selection Sept 8, opening statements Oct 13, 2026
- State prosecutors want July 1 trial date
- Evidence from backpack ruled admissible
- Separate incident: man arrested Jan 29 trying to impersonate FBI agent

**AskNews Articles (Feb 1-2, 2026):**

1. **Cryptocurrency price updates (Feb 1-2)**: Reports "Luigi Mangione" cryptocurrency token (LUIGI-USD) dropped -8.66% to -14.53%. This is a meme coin, not the person, but indicates ongoing cultural phenomenon. Weak evidence for actual search interest.

2. **International news (Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, German - Jan 30 - Feb 1)**: All report the Jan 30 death penalty ruling. No new developments beyond Jan 31. These are lagging indicators of the Jan 30 spike.

3. **Historical/cultural pieces (Sept-Dec 2025)**: 
   - Medium article (Sept 26, 2025): Discusses female supporters at court appearances
   - Shein controversy (Sept 11, 2025): AI-generated image removed from product listing
   - La Voz article (Dec 22, 2025): Deep dive into "mangionistas" fan culture, $1.3M raised for defense
   - The News International (Oct 29, 2025): Viral letter about jail playlist

These older articles establish baseline: sustained fan interest, cultural phenomenon, but are not current catalysts.

**Expert/Entity Opinions Identified:**
- Judge Margaret Garnett (factual ruling, not opinion)
- Defense attorney Karen Agnifilo (relief at ruling - professional opinion)
- Dr. Joseph Richardson/The Guardian (criticism of "white privilege bias" in support - expert opinion from Dec 2025)
- Network Contagion Research Institute (warning about online radicalization - expert opinion from Dec 2024)

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Jan 30 death penalty ruling**: Multiple tier-1 sources confirm. This is a major legal development that historically drives search spikes. However, the ruling occurred on Jan 30, and today is Feb 2 - we're already 3 days post-spike. Google Trends typically shows immediate spike then decay within 3-7 days for such events.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Feb 6 state court hearing**: Unexpected summons with no stated reason (ABC7, Jan 31). Could generate renewed interest if media covers it or if reason is revealed. However, it's a procedural hearing, not a trial or major ruling. Historical pattern: procedural hearings generate smaller spikes than verdicts/major rulings.
- **DOJ appeal decision due Feb 27**: Prosecutors must update court on appeal plans. Could generate interest, but it's 25 days away, outside our prediction window.
- **Ongoing fan culture**: La Voz (Dec 2025) documented sustained supporter activity, $1.3M raised, merchandise, court appearances. This suggests baseline interest remains elevated but doesn't predict direction of change.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Meme coin price movements**: LUIGI-USD cryptocurrency dropped 8-14% Feb 1-2. This could reflect waning retail interest post-Jan 30 spike, but meme coins are highly volatile and not reliable predictors of search behavior.
- **Shein/fashion incidents**: Historical (Sept 2025) evidence of cultural penetration but too old to predict Feb 2-15 movement.
- **Fake FBI agent incident (Jan 29)**: Bizarre story that got media coverage but is a side story, not a main catalyst.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction window**: 13 days (Feb 2 → Feb 15, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**
1. **Distance from Jan 30 spike**: We're 3 days post-major news. Historical pattern from reference class shows Google Trends typically peaks 0-2 days after major news, then decays over 5-14 days.

2. **Feb 6 hearing**: 4 days into our window. If it generates news, we might see a counter-trend bump. However:
   - It's a state court procedural hearing (lower impact than federal ruling)
   - No stated reason suggests routine matter
   - Even if it generates interest, the bump would need to exceed the Jan 30 baseline by >3 points on Feb 15 to resolve "Increases"

3. **No other scheduled catalysts** in the Feb 2-15 window.

**If timeframe were halved (6-7 days):**
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability (less time for decay)
- Would decrease "Decreases" probability
- "Increases" would require Feb 6 hearing to be significant

**If timeframe were doubled (26 days):**
- Would strongly increase "Decreases" probability (natural decay continues)
- Feb 27 DOJ appeal decision would enter window as potential catalyst
- "Doesn't change" would become very unlikely (too much time for volatility)

**(d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View**

**Outside view baseline:**
- Decreases: 42%
- Increases: 30%
- Doesn't change: 28%

**Inside view adjustments:**

**Factors supporting DECREASE (strengthen baseline 42%):**
1. **Temporal decay is already underway**: Jan 30 spike is 3 days old. Kyle Rittenhouse and similar cases showed consistent decay 3-10 days post-spike.
2. **No major catalyst scheduled**: Feb 6 hearing is procedural, unlikely to match Jan 30 impact.
3. **Media cycle has moved on**: International sources from Feb 1 are already lagging; no fresh Feb 2 reporting in mainstream U.S. media.

**Adjustment: +8% to Decrease** (42% → 50%)

**Factors supporting INCREASE (weaken baseline 30%):**
1. **Feb 6 hearing could surprise**: "Unexpected summons with no stated reason" suggests judge may address something substantive. If media covers it and it's newsworthy, could generate renewed spike.
2. **However**: Even if Feb 6 generates interest, the question compares Feb 15 to Feb 2. For "Increases" to win, Feb 15 must be >3 points higher than Feb 2. If Feb 2 is already elevated from Jan 30 residual, and Feb 6 causes a temporary bump that decays by Feb 15, we might end up flat or down.

**Adjustment: -5% from Increase** (30% → 25%)

**Factors supporting DOESN'T CHANGE (weaken baseline 28%):**
1. **Volatility is structural**: Reference class shows 70% of comparable periods had >3-point swings. Mangione's fan culture and media coverage pattern suggest high volatility.
2. **±3 threshold is narrow**: Google Trends daily movements for high-profile cases routinely exceed 3 points even without catalysts.

**Adjustment: -3% from Doesn't change** (28% → 25%)

**Final calibrated distribution:**
- Decreases: 50%
- Increases: 25%
- Doesn't change: 25%

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view established a 42% baseline for "Decreases" based on reference class behavior (high-profile defendants between major hearings, post-spike decay pattern). The inside view strengthens this:

1. **Temporal position**: We're in the decay phase of a Jan 30 spike. Historical analogs (Rittenhouse, Syed, Holmes) show 60-70% of post-spike periods trend downward over 7-14 days.

2. **Catalyst asymmetry**: The Feb 6 hearing is the only potential catalyst, but:
   - It's 4 days away (Feb 2 is baseline, Feb 6 is mid-window)
   - Even if it spikes interest, the comparison point is Feb 15 (9 days post-hearing)
   - For "Increases" to win, Feb 15 must exceed Feb 2 by >3 points, requiring either sustained elevation or a very late-window catalyst (none scheduled)

3. **Volatility cuts both ways**: The ±3 threshold makes "Doesn't change" harder to hit than the reference class ±4 threshold, but it also means small movements resolve to "change." Given we're starting from an elevated post-spike baseline, small downward drift is more likely than flat or upward.

4. **Blind spot consideration**: The biggest risk to this forecast is if the Feb 6 hearing reveals something dramatic (e.g., surprise plea deal, new terrorism charges, judge sanctions prosecutors). This could generate a fresh spike that persists through Feb 15. However, the "unexpected summons with no stated reason" language suggests routine procedure, and defense attorney Agnifilo said she'd respond "next week" to trial date request, implying she's not expecting fireworks.

**Confidence assessment:**
- 50% on "Decreases" reflects high confidence in decay trend but acknowledges Feb 6 uncertainty
- 25% on "Increases" is 5% below outside view, reflecting that Feb 6 is unlikely to generate sustained elevation through Feb 15
- 25% on "Doesn't change" is 3% below outside view, reflecting narrow ±3 threshold and structural volatility

**Alternative scenario**: If Feb 6 hearing is dramatic AND generates sustained media coverage AND Feb 2 baseline is low (already decayed from Jan 30), then "Increases" could win. Probability: ~20-25%, which aligns with my forecast.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends US interest in "luigi mangione" on Feb 15 be >3 points higher (Increases), within ±3 points (Doesn't change), or >3 points lower (Decreases) than Feb 2?

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view was Decreases 42%, Increases 30%, Doesn't change 28%. Final forecast is Decreases 50%, Increases 25%, Doesn't change 25%. Shift is justified by temporal decay position and catalyst timing.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Decreases (50%); Least likely = Increases and Doesn't change (tied 25%). Makes sense: we're 3 days post-spike, decay is typical, Feb 6 hearing is uncertain but probably routine.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Jan 30 death penalty ruling occurred 3 days ago; decay phase underway (strong)
   - Feb 6 state court hearing could generate renewed interest but timing/impact uncertain (moderate)
   - Reference class shows 60% of post-spike changes are downward (strong)
   - No other catalysts scheduled in window (strong)
   - Narrow ±3 threshold makes "no change" structurally difficult (moderate)

5. **Blind spot**: Feb 6 hearing reveals major development (plea deal, new charges, sanctions) that generates sustained media cycle through Feb 15. Would flip forecast to "Increases" ~60%, "Decreases" 25%, "Doesn't change" 15%.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [25, 25, 50]
