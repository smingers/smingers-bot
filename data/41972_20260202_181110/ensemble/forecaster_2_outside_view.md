Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**WIRED (Dec 10, 2024):** High-quality technology/culture publication documenting the immediate commercial and social media response to Mangione's arrest. Key facts: merchandise proliferation, platform responses, fan fiction emergence. The Network Contagion Research Institute expert opinion provides credible analysis of the phenomenon's unprecedented mainstream nature. Date: ~2 months after initial arrest, capturing the first wave of public interest.

**Out of My Gord (Dec 17, 2024):** Lower-tier blog source but provides specific metrics (X followers: 1,500→500k, $130k defense fund) that can be cross-referenced. Reiterates the NCRI expert opinion. Date: One week after WIRED, showing sustained interest.

**Livemint (Feb 25, 2025):** Mainstream Indian business publication reporting on fashion influence. Critical factual data: Google search spikes (1,400% for "loafers", 350% for "outfits", 500% for "ankles") following Feb 21, 2025 court appearance. This establishes a clear pattern: court appearances drive search spikes. Date: ~2.5 months after arrest, documenting second major wave.

**CNN (Jan 30, 2026):** Tier-1 news source. Key facts: Judge Garnett dismissed death penalty charge on Jan 30, 2026; federal trial scheduled Sept 8, 2026 (jury selection) and Oct 13, 2026 (opening statements); state trial pushed for July 2026; evidence ruling in May 2026. This is 3 days before our forecast start date—highly relevant for understanding immediate context.

**ABC7 Chicago (Jan 31, 2026):** Regional ABC affiliate. Key fact: Unexpected court summons for **February 6, 2026**—this falls within our forecast window (Feb 2-15). This is crucial new information. Date: 2 days before forecast start.

**NBC News (Jan 30, 2026):** Tier-1 source corroborating CNN's reporting on the death penalty dismissal. Adds detail about public reaction (supporters cheering, viewing him as "folk hero"). Date: Same as CNN, 3 days before forecast start.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis identifying six major spikes over 12 months tied to specific events. Key analysis: Feb 2025 "loafer spike" (fashion virality), Apr 2025 (death penalty announcement), Sep 2025 (terrorism counts dismissed), Dec 1 2025 (evidentiary hearing), Jan 30 2026 (death penalty dismissal). **Critical forward-looking catalysts for Feb 2-15**: (1) Feb 6 unexpected court appearance, (2) Prosecution appeal decision window (deadline Feb 27, typically announced 10-14 days early = Feb 13-17 range), (3) TV panel coverage Feb 4 & 11, (4) Weekend protests Feb 3-4 and Feb 10, (5) Documentary promotional activity for Feb 17 premiere.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **High-profile criminal defendants' Google Trends patterns:** Cases like Tsarnaev, Rittenhouse, Depp/Heard show episodic spikes tied to court dates, with decay between events.
2. **"Folk hero" defendants with social media followings:** Similar to Mangione's trajectory—initial spike, sustained baseline, spikes at legal milestones.
3. **Google Trends for individuals 12+ months after initial fame:** Most show declining baseline with smaller spikes at events.

**Most suitable:** Reference class #2 (folk hero defendants) because Mangione exhibits unique characteristics: sustained merchandise sales, fashion influence, active defense fund, and organized protests—indicators of maintained public interest rather than pure decay.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 13 days (Feb 2-15, 2026), measuring change between Feb 2 and Feb 15.

**Current context (as of Feb 2, 2026):**
- Jan 30 ruling (3 days ago) likely still generating elevated searches
- Agent report indicates Jan 30 created a "pronounced peak"
- Historical pattern: court-related spikes last 24-48 hours with rapid decay

**Key pattern from historical data:**
- Feb 21, 2025 court appearance → massive spike (1,400% search increase for related terms)
- Dec 1, 2025 evidentiary hearing → "mini-spike"
- Jan 30, 2026 death penalty ruling → "pronounced peak"

**Critical event within forecast window:**
- **Feb 6, 2026 court appearance** (4 days into our window)—this is unexpected and reason unspecified, historically these drive major spikes

**Expected trajectory:**
- Feb 2: Elevated baseline from Jan 30 spike (decaying)
- Feb 6: New spike from court appearance
- Feb 15: Likely lower than Feb 2 unless Feb 6 spike is exceptionally large OR prosecution announces appeal decision

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether interest will Increase, Stay Same (±3 points), or Decrease between Feb 2 and Feb 15.

**Factors favoring DECREASE:**
1. Natural decay pattern: All previous spikes show rapid decline after 48-72 hours
2. Feb 2 represents a relatively elevated baseline (3 days post-Jan 30 ruling)
3. No scheduled major milestones after Feb 6
4. 13-day window allows substantial decay from any Feb 6 spike
5. Historical pattern: peaks are followed by valleys

**Factors favoring INCREASE:**
1. Feb 6 court appearance could generate a spike larger than any residual Jan 30 elevation on Feb 2
2. If Feb 6 occurs when Feb 2 has already decayed significantly, Feb 15 could still be elevated
3. Prosecution appeal announcement (though more likely Feb 13-17)
4. TV coverage Feb 4 & 11, protests Feb 3-4 & 10

**Factors favoring STAYS SAME:**
1. Feb 6 spike exactly offsetting Jan 30 decay
2. Multiple small catalysts maintaining stable elevated baseline

**Critical uncertainty:** The relative magnitude of Feb 2 (post-Jan 30 decay) vs. Feb 15 (post-Feb 6 decay). Given that:
- Court appearances historically produce the largest spikes
- Feb 6 is unexpected (potentially more newsworthy)
- But Feb 15 is 9 days after Feb 6 (substantial decay time)
- Feb 2 is only 3 days after Jan 30 (less decay time)

The most likely scenario is that Feb 2 still has residual elevation from Jan 30, while Feb 15 has decayed significantly from Feb 6, resulting in a net DECREASE.

## Outside View Calibration

**Base rates to consider:**
1. Google Trends typically show mean reversion—spikes are temporary
2. In the agent report's six identified spikes, each was followed by decay
3. The ±3 threshold is relatively narrow on Google Trends' 0-100 scale

**Distribution considerations:**
- This is NOT a random walk—there's strong mean reversion in search interest
- Court events create predictable spikes followed by predictable decay
- The 13-day window is long enough for a full spike-decay cycle

**Probability reasoning:**
- DECREASE is most likely because: (a) Feb 2 has less decay time from Jan 30 than Feb 15 has from Feb 6, (b) historical pattern strongly favors decay, (c) no major events scheduled for Feb 12-15
- INCREASE would require Feb 6 spike to be exceptionally large AND sustained, or a late-breaking appeal announcement
- STAYS SAME requires precise offsetting—low probability given volatility

**Calibration checks:**
- 70% confidence in DECREASE feels appropriate given strong historical pattern
- 20% for INCREASE accounts for Feb 6 uncertainty and possible appeal announcement
- 10% for STAYS SAME reflects the narrow ±3 band and possibility of exact offsetting

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 20%
Doesn't change: 10%
Decreases: 70%
