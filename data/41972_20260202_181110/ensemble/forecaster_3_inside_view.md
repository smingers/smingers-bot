Analysis:

1) Resolution / options (paraphrase)
- Compare Google Trends (US) value for query “luigi mangione” on 2026-02-02 vs 2026-02-15 (per the provided Trends link).  
- “Doesn’t change” if Feb 15 is within ±3 of Feb 2; “Increases” if >+3; “Decreases” if <-3.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what’s factual vs opinion)

- CNN (2026-01-30): High-quality national outlet. **Facts:** federal judge dismissed death-penalty-eligible counts; evidence from backpack admissible; trial schedule; DOJ appeal update due by Feb 27. **Opinion/interpretation:** “galvanize supporters” framing—plausible but not a measured metric.
- NBC News (2026-01-30): High-quality corroboration of the same court ruling. **Facts:** same dismissals; evidence allowed; public reaction (supporters cheering). Minimal speculation.
- BBC (2026-01-30): High-quality international outlet corroborating dismissal + 30-day challenge window. **Facts** consistent with CNN/NBC; little conjecture.
- ABC7 (2026-01-31): Local affiliate; generally reliable on court scheduling. **Key fact:** Mangione unexpectedly summoned for **Feb 6, 2026** state court appearance; reason not given (unknown). The “unknown reason” is not evidence of significance by itself, but the event date is a concrete potential attention catalyst.
- AskNews “crypto price updates” (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02): Low relevance to the *person* query; “Luigi Mangione (LUIGI-USD)” appears to be a meme coin. Likely noise; could cause some incidental searches but probably small versus court-driven news.
- AskNews foreign-language rewrites / tabloidy aggregations (various, 2026-01-30 to 2026-02-01): Mostly derivative summaries of the same court ruling. Useful for confirming that the story is widely syndicated (breadth), but not independent new facts beyond the ruling and the “fake FBI agent” incident.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- (Strong, multi-source) **Major legal milestone just occurred (Jan 30):** CNN/NBC/BBC all confirm death-penalty path removed. Historically, major rulings produce a spike followed by mean reversion/decay in search interest over ~days to ~2 weeks.
- (Strong, historical mechanism) **Court events → search spikes → decay:** Your outside-view context already notes repeated “hearing/spike then fade” dynamics; this mechanism is common across high-profile criminal cases.

Moderate evidence
- (Moderate) **Feb 6 court appearance scheduled (ABC7):** within the window; likely to generate renewed coverage and a short spike. Magnitude is uncertain because the purpose is unspecified.
- (Moderate) **Appeal decision timing:** DOJ update requested by Feb 27 (CNN/BBC). That’s outside the window, but “will they appeal?” chatter could emerge mid-Feb; still speculative without a dated trigger inside Feb 2–15.

Weak evidence
- (Weak) Meme coin “LUIGI-USD” price articles: tangential; unclear it moves searches for the person meaningfully.
- (Weak) “supporter/fan” narratives: real phenomenon, but not a dated, discrete catalyst for Feb 15 specifically.

Net implication for the criteria (Feb 2 vs Feb 15):
- Feb 2 is very close to the Jan 30 ruling (only ~3 days). That increases the chance Feb 2 is still on an “elevated” post-ruling level.
- Feb 15 is ~16 days after Jan 30 and ~9 days after Feb 6. Unless there’s a fresh late-window catalyst, the default is lower interest by Feb 15 than Feb 2.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: 13 days (from 2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15; endpoint comparison only).
- If halved (to ~Feb 8): **Increases** becomes more likely because Feb 6 spike would be closer to the endpoint.
- If doubled (to ~Feb 28): **Decreases** becomes more likely due to additional time for post-hearing attention to fade and no trial until mid/late 2026.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view base rate)

Outside-view base rates given: Increases 20 / Doesn’t change 10 / Decreases 70.

Adjustments:
- I modestly *increase* “Increases” because the Feb 6 appearance is a concrete, in-window attention catalyst (moderate evidence) and could push Feb 15 above Feb 2 if Feb 2 has already decayed substantially and Feb 6 produces persistent follow-on coverage (less common, but possible).
- I also nudge “Doesn’t change” upward slightly because a ±3 band is not huge, and two offsetting effects (Jan 30 decay vs Feb 6 bump) can sometimes land near-flat by coincidence.
- Still, I keep “Decreases” as the modal outcome: Feb 2 is likely still relatively elevated from a nationally covered Jan 30 ruling; by Feb 15 most comparable news-driven spikes have typically cooled unless there’s a new headline right at/near Feb 15 (no strong evidence of that).

Probability calibration

- Consistent with mean reversion + “endpoint is far from latest big headline” logic, Decreases remains highest.
- Main uncertainty / volatility driver is the unknown significance of Feb 6 and whether something else breaks Feb 12–15 (e.g., surprise filings, leaked appeal decision, or another viral “fan” incident). That argues against extreme confidence (so I pull Decreases down from 70 to low-60s).

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options check: compares Trends value Feb 15 vs Feb 2; ±3 = “Doesn’t change”; >+3 “Increases”; <-3 “Decreases”.
2) Outside view base rate: [20, 10, 70].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Doesn’t change; yes—offsetting to within ±3 is less common than directional movement.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Jan 30 death-penalty ruling (CNN/NBC/BBC) likely elevates Feb 2 value.
   - Feb 6 unexpected hearing (ABC7) likely causes a spike but decays by Feb 15.
   - Typical search-interest mean reversion in high-profile legal cases.
5) Blind spot: A major, widely covered surprise on/near Feb 14–15 (appeal announcement, dramatic court development, or viral incident) could flip to “Increases.”
6) Technicalities: probabilities are integers, 0–100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [26, 12, 62]
