Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **WIRED (Dec 10, 2024) – “Luigi Mangione Is Everywhere”**  
- **What it says (facts):** Rapid, highly viral online reaction immediately after charges; merch proliferation; social platforms taking accounts down; review-bombing; TikTok/hashtag activity; look-alike contest; early fan fiction.  
- **What it says (opinions/interpretation):** Frames the phenomenon as “Mangione mania” and discusses contagion risk; cites Network Contagion Research Institute concern.  
- **Quality/date:** High-quality outlet; but it’s **old** relative to the 2026 forecasting window. Useful mainly for establishing that Mangione-related attention has meme-like, episodic spike behavior.

2) **Out of My Gord (Dec 17, 2024) – social media surge**  
- **Facts:** Reports large follower growth and fundraising numbers; notes platforms removing merch; notes prosecutor concerns.  
- **Opinions:** Emphasizes “information cascade” style dynamics.  
- **Quality/date:** Blog-level source; some facts may be correct but lower verification standards; also **old**. Useful only as qualitative evidence that attention can spike hard and fast.

3) **Mint/Livemint (Feb 25, 2025) – fashion/search spike after court appearance**  
- **Facts:** Claims large percentage jumps in specific searches (“loafers,” “outfits,” etc.) tied to a court appearance.  
- **Opinions:** “Unlikely influencer” framing.  
- **Quality/date:** Mid-tier business press; likely summarizing other reporting (WWD / tabloid pickup). Directionally useful: court appearances can produce sharp, short-lived search spikes, including “lifestyle-virality” spikes.

4) **CNN (Jan 30, 2026) – death penalty count dismissed; evidence allowed; scheduling details**  
- **Facts:** Concrete legal rulings; appeal-decision update deadline (Feb 27) mentioned; trial scheduling.  
- **Opinions:** Mentions supporter narratives; largely straight reporting.  
- **Quality/date:** High-quality; **very recent** and directly relevant. Indicates a “news hook” occurred just before Feb 2, 2026.

5) **ABC7 Chicago (Jan 31, 2026) – unexpected Feb 6 state-court appearance**  
- **Facts:** A **scheduled Feb 6** court appearance; July 1 trial-date push; next major state evidentiary ruling expected in May.  
- **Quality/date:** Local TV news; generally reliable for court calendaring; **very recent** and relevant because scheduled hearings often generate another discrete spike.

6) **NBC News (Jan 30, 2026) – similar to CNN on dismissed counts/evidence**  
- **Facts:** Confirms the legal development and adds color (e.g., impersonation incident).  
- **Quality/date:** High-quality; **very recent**. Reinforces that Jan 30 produced broad coverage, a classic precursor to a short-term attention decay pattern.

7) **Agent report (undated, but written for this question)**  
- **Facts vs speculation:**  
  - Plausible: interest is episodic and correlated with court milestones; Jan 30 ruling likely caused a spike; Feb 6 hearing is a potential catalyst.  
  - Less reliable: specific claims about Trends peaks, network rundowns, WHOIS/site launch, protest “save-the-dates,” documentary promotion timing—these are **not well-cited** and read partly speculative.  
- **Quality/date:** Mixed. Useful for hypothesis generation (what *might* move searches), but I would not treat the more granular claims as established facts without direct verification.

**Net from sources (outside-view relevant):** “Luigi Mangione” search interest behaves like a headline-driven series: sharp spikes around legal events and then reversion/decay, with occasional secondary spikes when a new hearing or sensational detail hits.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Possible reference classes for a 13-day Google Trends change (with a ±3 “no change” band):

1) **High-profile criminal defendant proper-name searches around court milestones**  
- Pattern: spike on ruling/hearing day(s), then decay over ~1–3 weeks unless another milestone occurs.  
- Suitability: **High** (closest match: same type of driver—court calendar/news coverage).

2) **General “viral internet villain/anti-hero” meme names**  
- Pattern: more volatile, sometimes multiple waves driven by culture content rather than legal calendar.  
- Suitability: Medium (Mangione had meme dynamics in 2024–25, but 2026 attention seems increasingly court-driven).

3) **Any proper name on Google Trends over 2-week windows**  
- Pattern: many are mean-reverting and noisy; ±3 is a tight threshold so “change” outcomes dominate.  
- Suitability: Medium (good for threshold intuition, but too broad).

**Chosen reference class:** (1) high-profile criminal defendant name searches around court milestones.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast window:** from **2026-02-02 to 2026-02-15** (13 days).  
- Typical behavior in the chosen reference class over ~2 weeks:
  - If Feb 2 is shortly after a major news spike (Jan 30 ruling), the base-rate expectation is **decay by two weeks later**, often enough to exceed small thresholds.
  - A **new hearing inside the window** (Feb 6 per ABC7) can create a countervailing spike. But even then, by Feb 15 the series often drifts downward again unless the Feb 6 event is especially dramatic or followed by additional revelations.

Given the “Doesn’t change if within 3” rule, the bar for “change” is low. In many news-driven series, a 13-day move >3 (up or down) is more common than staying within ±3.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

Starting from the base rate for a prominent criminal-case keyword shortly after a major ruling:
- **Status quo / inertia expectation:** attention fades after the immediate post-ruling burst. That points to **Decreases** as the modal outcome by Feb 15 relative to Feb 2.  
- **Countervailing factor:** a scheduled Feb 6 appearance is the kind of event that can produce a mid-window spike, raising the odds of **Increases** (or at least interrupting decay). However, because the comparison is end-point-to-end-point (Feb 15 vs Feb 2), a Feb 6 spike does not guarantee Feb 15 ends higher—often the spike is transient.  
- **Tight “no change” band:** ±3 is narrow, so even modest regression-to-mean or a small burst of new coverage can flip the outcome to Increase/Decrease rather than “Doesn’t change.”

So the outside-view expectation is: **most likely Decreases**, with a meaningful chance of **Increases** due to an in-window court event, and the smallest probability on **Doesn’t change**.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I anchor to a three-way distribution where “change” dominates because the ±3 criterion is tight for a news-reactive term.  
- I then skew toward **Decreases** because the most recent *known* major catalyst (Jan 30 ruling) precedes Feb 2, and attention commonly decays over a two-week horizon.  
- I keep **Increases** substantial (not tiny) because scheduled hearings sometimes generate renewed coverage, and endpoint comparisons can land higher if the second event is larger than the first or if follow-on commentary persists.  
- “Upsets” in this domain are common (a single unexpected filing, leak, or viral clip can swing Trends), so probabilities should not be overly concentrated.

Outside View Prediction:
- Increases: 26%  
- Doesn't change: 19%  
- Decreases: 55%
