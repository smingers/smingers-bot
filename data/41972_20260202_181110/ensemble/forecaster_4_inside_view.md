Analysis
(a) Source analysis (quality & recency, facts vs. opinion)  
1. CNN (30 Jan 26) – National outlet, straight reporting on death-penalty count dismissal; highly reliable, fact-heavy, very recent.  
2. NBC News (30 Jan 26) – Same ruling, corroborates CNN; reliable.  
3. ABC7 (31 Jan 26) – Local TV; factual notice of a 6 Feb state-court appearance; adequate reliability.  
4. BBC (30 Jan 26) – Confirms ruling, scheduling; reliable international source.  
5. Crypto-price wires (1-2 Feb 26) – Low-tier financial feeds; only show that a micro-cap meme-token named “Luigi Mangione” is drifting down; weak relevance.  
6. Misc. foreign-language pieces (AFP, Yahoo, etc., 30-31 Jan 26) – Re-reports CNN facts; strengthen independence.  
7. 2025 and earlier articles – Older context on past search spikes; useful only for historical pattern.

Factual consensus across (1-4,6):  
• Major news hook already occurred on 30 Jan 26.  
• Next scheduled hook: surprise hearing on 6 Feb 26.  
• No other dated events in 2–15 Feb window.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern for high-profile defendants: search interest spikes on ruling day then declines rapidly (multiple past cases + 2024-25 Mangione spikes).  
• Major spike likely happened 30 Jan – corroborated by five independent outlets.

Moderate evidence  
• 6 Feb hearing may create a secondary spike (single reliable calendar source, logical causal link).  
• Meme-like fandom occasionally produces viral aftershocks (historic but noisy).

Weak evidence  
• Micro-cap “LUIGI” token price drops – anecdotal, probably uncorrelated with Google searches.  
• Unscheduled leaks or viral TikTok trends – possible but speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 13 days (2 Feb → 15 Feb 26).  
If window were halved (6½ days), the 6 Feb spike would dominate and raise “Increase” odds.  
If doubled (~4 weeks), more time for decay and other news; “Decrease” probability would climb further.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside view) 26 / 19 / 55 (Inc/No chg/Dec).  
Inside factors:  
+ Minor upward pull: 6 Feb hearing may lift searches temporarily.  
– Strong downward pull: 2 Feb reading is still within 72 h of the 30 Jan burst; typical decay curve shows continued fall after Day 3; Feb 15 is nine days post-hearing.  
± Tight ±3 band means almost any genuine drift registers as “change”, so “Doesn’t change” remains lowest.

Net effect: Slightly lowers “Increase”, slightly raises “No change”, nudges “Decrease” up.

Probability calibration
Increases…………22  
Doesn’t change…20  
Decreases……….58  
(Sum = 100)

Checklist (abridged)  
1. ±3 GT units between 2 Feb & 15 Feb; Increase >+3, Decrease <-3.  
2. Used base 26/19/55; final rooted in it.  
3. Most likely = Decreases, least likely = Doesn’t change – consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) 30 Jan spike already passed; b) search decay pattern; c) 6 Feb hearing inside window; d) ±3 narrow band.  
5. Blind spot: unexpected viral content (e.g., leaked jail video) on 13-14 Feb could lift interest → Increase wins. Would shift 20 pts from Decrease to Increase.  
6. Probabilities 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [22, 20, 58]
