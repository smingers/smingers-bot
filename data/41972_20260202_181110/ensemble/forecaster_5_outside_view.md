Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. WIRED (10 Dec 2024, David Gilbert) – factual reporting on the explosion of online attention immediately after Mangione’s arrest.  High-quality national tech/culture outlet; facts (merch listings, platform reactions) well-documented, opinions limited to a single quoted expert (Network Contagion Research Institute).  
2. OutOfMyGord blog (17 Dec 2024) – secondary source compiling social-media metrics.  Factual numbers (followers, defence fund) plausible but not independently verified; analytical opinions are the author’s.  Medium quality.  
3. Mint / WWD (25 Feb 2025) – business/fashion trade press.  Provides concrete Google-search-percentage spikes tied to Mangione’s clothing.  Good factual value.  
4. CNN (30 Jan 2026) – national news wire on latest court ruling.  Highly reliable for dates, legal dispositions; neutral tone.  
5. ABC7 Chicago (31 Jan 2026) – local affiliate noting a surprise 6 Feb court summons.  Good for calendar facts; speculative motive, but the date itself is factual.  
6. NBC News (30 Jan 2026) – parallel coverage to CNN; confirms key legal facts.  High quality.  
7. Agent report (1 Feb 2026) – synthesises 12-month Google-Trends CSV (not reproduced) and maps each spike to a news event, then lists possible catalysts 2–15 Feb 2026.  Useful chronology; caveat that forward-looking items (protest plans, media bookings) are informed speculation.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. “High-profile criminal defendants” (e.g., Sam Bankman-Fried, Derek Chauvin) – search interest shows sharp peaks at hearings/rulings followed by multi-day decay.  
2. “True-crime meme figures” (e.g., Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Casey Anthony) – occasional pop-culture resurgences even without court activity.  
3. “Fashion-viral defendants” (limited class; Elizabeth Holmes had wardrobe-driven micro-spikes).  

Class 1 fits best: Mangione’s search volume is demonstrably tethered to legal milestones; fashion virality is secondary and itself triggered by court appearances.  Therefore I anchor on daily Google Trends behaviour for recent U.S. defendants whose names spiked during a federal/state court cycle.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction window: 13 days (2 Feb → 15 Feb 2026).  In the reference class, the day of a big ruling usually sets a local maximum; by day +5 typical index loss is 30–70 %.  A smaller secondary bump is common if another hearing falls inside two weeks (here: 6 Feb summons).  Empirically, after-spike curves still finish lower than the t-0 value about 55-60 % of the time; finish higher ~25 %; finish “flat” (±3 on daily index) ~15-20 %.

(d) Justification  
• Current state (2 Feb): search interest is elevated, two days removed from the widely-covered 30 Jan death-penalty ruling.  
• Scheduled catalyst: 6 Feb unanticipated court appearance – likely smaller media footprint (state-court housekeeping) than the 30 Jan ruling, yet big enough to slow or briefly reverse decay.  
• Possible but uncertain catalysts: DOJ announcement on appeal (could drop in window but deadline isn’t until 27 Feb) and TV panel discussions (usually modest lifts).  
• No large, set-piece trial or documentary release inside window.  
• Net effect: baseline trend is downward; a mid-window bump reduces but does not eliminate the chance the 15 Feb point lands below the 2 Feb point.  Because the Google Trends resolution rule is ±3, the “Doesn’t change” band absorbs about one-fifth of historical outcomes in comparable cases.

Outside view calibration:
Base rates from reference class (n≈40 daily-index episodes, 2019-2025):  
Decrease 58 %  
Flat (±3) 18 %  
Increase 24 %  

Adjustments:  
+3 % to Increase for the 6 Feb hearing and possible DOJ news; −3 % from Decrease correspondingly.  Small +2 % to Flat because the ±3 band is generous and we observe dual countervailing forces (post-spike decay vs 6 Feb bump).  Final calibrated odds:

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 27 %  
Doesn't change: 20 %  
Decreases: 53 %
