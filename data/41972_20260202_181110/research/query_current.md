Analysis:
The key to forecasting any significant change in Google-Trends interest for “luigi mangione” is to learn whether something likely to spur extra searches (or suppress them) is scheduled or rumored for the February 2 – 15, 2026 window.  Useful signals include:
• Announcements of upcoming events (concerts, sport fixtures, conference talks, court appearances, book/film releases) that feature or directly concern Luigi Mangione.  
• Fresh or breaking news stories (e.g., scandals, obituaries, awards, viral social-media clips) that could drive sudden public attention.  
Therefore I need broad web coverage (Google), time-filtered journalistic coverage (Google News), and a conversational AskNews sweep looking explicitly for forward-dated or just-published information tied to that precise fortnight.
