Analysis:
The term “luigi mangione” currently sits at 37/100 on the locked-scale chart for 2026-01-16→2026-02-01.  That is already a middling, non-zero value for a name that (so far) shows little evidence of wide public recognition.  Most personal names that are not celebrities exhibit very low, random “noise” on Google Trends; day-to-day swings of ±1-5 points are common, while sustained moves of >3 points over two weeks usually require a triggering news event (e.g., a viral video, obituary, sporting feat, or court case).  The outside-view questions therefore are:

1. Who is Luigi Mangione?  If he is a public figure (e.g., an athlete, musician, politician) we need to know whether any scheduled event falls in the Feb 2–15 window—concert dates, product releases, anniversaries, court hearings, etc.
2. Has his name ever spiked above ~40 before?  Repeated past spikes would indicate a volatile baseline and a higher probability of another >3-point move.
3. Are there any fresh news items (Feb 1 or earlier) hinting at imminent publicity?

If initial searches show no notable identity or upcoming events, the base rate for a >3 point change for a small, obscure name over 13 days is low; the “Doesn’t change” outcome becomes the default.  Conversely, if we discover that Luigi Mangione is, say, a promising Serie A footballer with a match on Feb 11 that might draw headlines, we would raise the probability of “Increases.”  Detecting negative publicity (e.g., legal trouble) would raise “Increases” or “Decreases” depending on timing.

Therefore the most relevant historical context is:
• Prior Google Trends curve for this keyword over the past 12 months (to gauge typical volatility and identify past catalysts).
• Biographical or news coverage establishing whether Luigi Mangione is a public figure with imminent exposure.
