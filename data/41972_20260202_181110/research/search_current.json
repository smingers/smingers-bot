Garnett dismissed two of four federal counts against Luigi Mangione on Friday, January 30, 2026:\n   - Dismissed: Murder through use of a firearm (which carried potential death sentence) and a related firearms offense\n   - Remaining: Two federal stalking counts (maximum sentence: life in prison without parole)\n\n2. **Legal Reasoning:** Judge Garnett ruled the murder charge was technically flawed because it can only be used in tandem with a \"crime of violence.\" Prosecutors argued Mangione's alleged stalking met that standard, but the judge disagreed.\n\n3. **Evidence Ruling:** Judge Garnett ruled that Mangione's federal trial can include evidence seized from his backpack at arrest, including a ghost gun, fake IDs, a notebook, and writings detailing grievances against the private health care system. Defense lawyers had argued the search was illegal.\n\n4. **Attorney General's Directive:** Attorney General Pam Bondi had directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Mangione in April (2025), marking the Justice Department's first attempt to do so in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\n5. **Separate State Case:** Mangione faces nine counts in a separate New York state case, including second-degree murder and weapons charges. He has pleaded not guilty. State charges carry possibility of life in prison. New York does not have the death penalty (statute declared unconstitutional in 2004).\n\n6. **Background on the Crime:** Mangione, 27, is accused of shooting Brian Thompson, 50, CEO of United Healthcare, outside a midtown Manhattan hotel on December 4, 2024. Thompson was heading to an early morning investor conference. Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on December 9, 2024.\n\n7. **Recent Related Incident:** A day before this ruling, a 35-year-old Minnesota man (Mark Anderson) was charged with impersonating an FBI agent in an apparent attempt to free Mangione from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\n\n8. **Public Support:** The article notes supporters could be heard cheering for Mangione in the courthouse hallways, viewing him as \"a folk hero who took a stand against the for-profit health insurance industry.\"\n\n## Quotes from Named Sources:\n\n- **Judge Margaret M. Garnett:** \"The analysis contained in the balance of this opinion may strike the average person \u2014 and indeed many lawyers and judges \u2014 as tortured and strange, and the result may seem contrary to our intuitions about the criminal law. But it represents the Court's committed effort to faithfully apply the dictates of the Supreme Court to the charges in this case. The law must be the Court's only concern.\"\n\n- **Karen Agnifilo (Mangione's attorney):** Called it an \"incredible decision\" and stated \"We're all very relieved.\"\n\n- **Attorney General Pam Bondi:** Called Thompson's death a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America\" and framed the death penalty directive as part of Trump's \"agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abc7news.com/post/unitedhealthcare-ceo-murder-suspect-luigi-mangione-unexpectedly-summoned-court-hearing-new-york-state-supreme-judge/18515801/\">\n# Summary of Article: Luigi Mangione unexpectedly summoned to court next week\n\n**Source:** ABC7 San Francisco  \n**Date:** January 31, 2026\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Court Hearing Scheduled:** New York State Supreme Court Judge Gregory Carro has summoned Luigi Mangione and Manhattan district attorney prosecutors to court on Friday, February 6, 2026.\n\n2. **No Stated Reason:** The notification did not include a reason for this unexpected court appearance.\n\n3. **Trial Date Request:** Earlier in the week, prosecutors requested Judge Carro set a July 1 trial date, citing \"compelling state interests\" in putting Mangione on trial before his federal trial scheduled for fall.\n\n4. **Original Schedule Change:** Mangione had not been scheduled to return to state court until May, when the judge was expected to rule on a defense motion to suppress evidence.\n\n5. **Defense Response Pending:** Defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo stated on Friday (during Mangione's federal court appearance) that she would respond next week to the district attorney's July trial request.\n\n6. **Expected Legal Arguments:** The defense is expected to raise double jeopardy concerns, arguing that the state and federal cases are largely the same.\n\n7. **Federal Charge Dismissed:** On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed a death-eligible federal murder charge.\n\n8. **Case Background:** Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges related to the \"assassination-style shooting death\" of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n9. **No Comments:** There was no immediate comment from either side regarding the unexpected February 6 hearing.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/luigi-mangione-will-not-face-death-penalty-judge-nixes-two-federal-cou-rcna256715\">\n# Summary of Article: Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after judge nixes two federal counts\n\n**Source:** NBC News  \n**Date:** January 30, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Court Ruling:**\n- U.S. District Judge Margaret M.

The decision stems from the dismissal of the most serious federal charges\u2014murder and firearms\u2014because the remaining charge of harassment does not meet the Supreme Court\u2019s legal definition of a 'crime of violence,' which requires intentional use of force. While harassment may involve reckless behavior, it does not qualify under current federal capital punishment standards. Despite the prosecution's request for the death penalty\u2014the first such request since the resumption of federal executions\u2014Judge Garnett emphasized her duty to uphold legal doctrine, even if the outcome appears 'strange' to some jurists. Mangione remains eligible for life imprisonment without parole on the federal harassment charge. The case is split across two jurisdictions: a federal trial, set to begin with jury selection in September 2026, focuses on harassment charges; and a state trial in New York\u2019s Supreme Court, where Mangione faces second-degree murder, illegal weapons possession, and document forgery charges. The federal government is evaluating whether to appeal the death penalty dismissal. The case has polarized public opinion: official institutions have condemned the murder, but some critics of the insurance industry have supported Mangione through fundraising efforts. The state trial\u2019s start date remains pending, though the local prosecutor has signaled intent to expedite proceedings.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:39 PM\nSource:[La Voz](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/mundo/giro-en-el-caso-luigi-mangione-asesino-al-presidente-de-su-obra-social-pero-no-enfrentara-la-pena-de-muerte/)\n\n**Luigi Mangione trades -14.53 percent lower on Sunday 1st of February**\nLuigi Mangione (LUIGI-USD) experienced a 24-hour price decline of -14.53%, closing at USD 0.0002 by 05:52 PM Central Europe on Sunday, February 1, 2026.

The man, Mark A., falsely claimed to be an FBI agent with a court-ordered release document. He presented only his Minnesota driver\u2019s license, no badge, and no weapon, but carried a steel blade resembling a pizza cutter and a stack of legal documents allegedly meant to challenge the U.S. Department of Justice. During his arrest, he remained calm, even giving a peace sign to onlookers. His defense argued he was mentally ill and that the attempt was not credible due to lack of real authority or equipment. The presiding judge deemed him a flight risk. The incident occurred just days before a key court hearing in which Mangione was ruled ineligible for the death penalty. Mangione, who is currently in custody, has become a controversial figure, with a growing fan following that includes sending him letters and organizing protests, while some supporters have gone as far as attempting to help him escape.

Anderson claimed to be an FBI agent and presented a forged court order for Mangione\u2019s release. When confronted by prison staff, he showed a Minnesota driver\u2019s license and threw legal documents at them. His bag was searched and found to contain a barbecue fork and a circular blade. Anderson, who had traveled to New York to apply for a job but was unsuccessful, is now facing charges for impersonating a government official. Mangione, who gained public attention due to his striking appearance and Ivy League background from the University of Pennsylvania, has consistently denied the murder charges, and the case remains under judicial review.

According to CNN, Judge Margaret Garnett removed the murder charge\u2014one of the only charges that could have allowed for the death penalty\u2014from the indictment. After the review, only two counts of stalking remained, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without parole. The court ruled that for a murder to qualify as a federal crime eligible for the death penalty, it must occur during another violent crime, and the stalking incidents did not meet this criterion. Earlier, it was reported that a man in New York attempted to free Mangione by impersonating an FBI agent.

The court, led by Judge Margaret Garnett, removed the capital punishment-eligible charge of murder from the federal indictment, deeming it ineligible under federal jurisdiction. The court concluded that for a murder to qualify for the death penalty under federal law, it must have occurred during another violent crime. The prosecution argued that the stalking episodes constituted such crimes, but the court rejected this, stating that the alleged acts did not meet the legal definition of violent crimes under federal standards. As a result, the charges of murder and related firearm offenses were dismissed. Remaining charges involve two counts of stalking, each carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without parole. Earlier, authorities reported that a man had attempted to impersonate an FBI agent, arriving at a New York jail with a fabricated court order seeking Mangione\u2019s release.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 01:26 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/incident/69638255/)\n\n**Luigi Mangione Death Penalty Ruling Sparks Heated Debate, As Lawyer Reveals They Are 'Very Relieved'**\nLuigi Mangione will not face the death penalty for the alleged murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, following a federal judge's ruling that dismissed the death penalty charge due to 'legal infirmities' under federal law. U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett stated the dismissal's 'chief practical effect' was to preclude the death penalty as a possible punishment, though Mangione still faces a potential life sentence without parole if convicted. The ruling is a significant setback for Attorney General Pam Bondi, who personally directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty, calling the killing a 'premeditated, cold-blooded assassination' and aligning it with President Trump's 'Make America Safe Again' agenda. Mangione's defense team, led by Karen Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, argued Bondi had a conflict of interest due to her past ties to Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm that represented UnitedHealth Group (UHG), and claimed she continued to receive financial benefits from the firm\u2019s association with UHG. They also alleged the death penalty pursuit was politically motivated, criticizing the 'perp walk' and media spectacle as a 'Marvel movie'-esque show designed for political theater rather than justice. The defense called the judge\u2019s decision 'incredible' and 'very relieved,' emphasizing they remain prepared to fight all charges. The case has sparked intense online debate, with critics accusing the DOJ of 'botching' the case and politicizing justice, while others supported the ruling, arguing the death penalty is inherently flawed and federal overreach is unjust. Jury selection for the federal murder trial is scheduled to begin on September 8, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:15 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/luigi-mangione-death-penalty-ruling-001542917.html)\n\n**Where the Case Against Luigi Mangione Stands**\nLuigi Mangione, a 27-year-old Ivy League graduate, was arrested on December 9, 2024, for allegedly shooting Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, in Midtown Manhattan five days prior. He faces multiple charges on both state and federal levels in New York and Pennsylvania, where he was apprehended. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The judge dismissed two of the most serious federal charges, including one that would have made him eligible for the death penalty\u2014marking a legal victory for his defense. His lawyers had also successfully had terrorism-related state charges dropped in September. Although the state of New York does not enforce the death penalty, and none of the Pennsylvania charges are death penalty-eligible, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April 2026 that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would seek the death penalty against Mangione, describing the shooting as 'a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.' This decision followed President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order to resume pursuing the death penalty, reversing President Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 moratorium on federal executions and subsequent commutations of most federal death row sentences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:44 PM\nSource:[TIME](https://time.com/7362693/luigi-mangione-charges-trial-death-penalty/)\n\n**Luigi Mangione Will Not Face the Death Penalty for CEO Murder**\nJudge Margaret Garnett, presiding over the case of Luigi Mangione, 27, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, ruled on January 30, 2026, that federal prosecutors could not seek the death penalty. The judge deemed the federal murder charge legally insufficient and dismissed it, but upheld the federal stalking charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Thompson was fatally shot in the back on December 4, 2024, outside a luxury hotel in New York City during the UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Mangione was apprehended on December 9, 2024, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a 9mm silenced handgun, clothing matching surveillance footage, and a notebook detailing his intent to 'eliminate' an insurance CEO. Some Americans critical of high healthcare costs and insurance company power have viewed Mangione as a 'popular hero.' He remains detained in a federal prison in Brooklyn. On April 25, 2025, Mangione pleaded not guilty to both federal and state charges. The federal jury selection is set to begin on September 8, 2026. The state trial has no scheduled date, but Manhattan\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s office requested the trial be set for July 1, 2026, in a letter submitted to the judge on April 28, 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:23 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/mundo/estados-unidos/luigi-mangione-nao-sera-condenado-a-pena-de-morte-por-assassinato-de-ceo-de-plano-de-saude,30cabe859b35af9e17875ba014fdc6c3rx3ltyn5.html)\n\n**Luigi Mangione, Suspect in Murder of U.S. Insurance CEO, No Longer Faces Death Penalty**\nLuigi Mangione, the suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, no longer faces the death penalty and instead risks life imprisonment.

The judge dismissed two federal murder charges that would have increased the potential punishment: murder through use of a firearm and use of a firearm with a silencer to commit a 'crime of violence.' These charges were dismissed based on legal grounds, as reported by Forbes. Mangione, who was arrested days after the December 2024 shooting on a Manhattan street, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges. He will still face two counts of stalking, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Jury selection for the federal trial is set to begin on September 8, 2026, with opening statements scheduled for October 13, 2026. Judge Garnett also ruled that evidence recovered from Mangione\u2019s backpack at the time of his arrest may be admitted during the trial. This ruling comes amid reports that a Minnesota man allegedly impersonated an FBI agent in a failed attempt to break Mangione out of jail, as reported by Breitbart.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:47 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2026/01/30/luigi-mangione-wont-face-death-penalty-if-found-guilty-judge-rules/)\n\n**Luigi Mangione No Longer Facing Death Penalty as Some Federal Charges Are Tossed**\nLuigi Mangione will no longer face the death penalty after Judge Margaret Garnett of the Southern District of New York dismissed two federal charges\u2014murder and use of a firearm\u2014on January 30, 2026. Mangione, 27, remains charged with two stalking offenses and could still receive life without parole. He is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4, 2024, outside a Manhattan hotel during an investor conference. He was apprehended five days later in Altoona, Pennsylvania, allegedly carrying a 9 mm handgun and a manifesto expressing a desire to 'wack' a health insurance CEO. The Trump administration, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, had sought the death penalty, calling the killing a 'premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.' Judge Garnett has set the federal trial to begin in October 2026. Mangione also faces a separate second-degree murder charge in New York State, with prosecutors aiming to start the state trial in July 2026, ahead of the federal case. He is currently detained at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is held alongside former Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. On January 29, 2026, a Minnesota man was charged with impersonating an FBI agent in a failed attempt to free Mangione using a pizza cutter and barbecue fork.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[PEOPLE.com](https://people.com/luigi-mangione-no-longer-facing-death-penalty-11896037)\n\n**Luigi Mangione Will Not Face Death Penalty in Federal Murder Case**\nLuigi Mangione, the 27-year-old suspect in the December 4, 2024, murder of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare\u2014the largest U.S. health insurance company\u2014will not face the death penalty in federal court, a federal judge ruled on Friday, January 30, 2026. Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed two charges that had carried the death penalty: murder and using a silenced firearm. Two remaining charges related to harassment and stalking of the victim remain, each carrying a potential life sentence. The judge stated the decision 'aims solely to eliminate the death penalty as a sentencing option for the jury.' Mangione remains under indictment for murder in New York State, where he also faces a potential life sentence. His federal trial jury selection begins on September 8, 2026, with trial proceedings set to start on October 13, 2026. The New York state trial date has not yet been scheduled. Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both cases. He is accused of cold-bloodedly shooting Thompson, 50, in a Manhattan street. After the attack, he fled and was arrested five days later at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, about 370 kilometers from the crime scene. Mangione has become, for some, a symbol of American public anger toward health insurance companies, which are accused of prioritizing profits over patient care. His court appearances have consistently drawn supporters, primarily young women.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94LE29E)\n\n**Right-Wing Judge Blocks Death Penalty for Murder Suspect Luigi Mangione**\nLuigi Mangione, accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, is no longer facing the death penalty after a federal judge ruled against it. The decision means Mangione now faces life imprisonment instead. Prosecutors are expected to appeal the ruling. The trial, which will proceed with jury selection on September 8, 2026, is being held in federal court. Mangione is also facing a separate life sentence trial in New York state, where he is accused of the same crime. He was apprehended after a five-day manhunt in a McDonald's in Pennsylvania.

Mangione, 27, faces four federal charges\u2014including murder via firearm, stalking, and a firearms offense\u2014for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The murder charge originally carried a death penalty, but Judge Garnett agreed with the defense that the stalking charges do not qualify as 'crimes of violence,' thus removing the death penalty option. Mangione now faces life in prison without parole. His defense team, led by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has criticized U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and former President Donald Trump for prejudicing the case through public statements, including Trump calling Mangione a 'pure assassin' and labeling supporters as domestic terrorists\u2014comments made after a New York state judge dismissed terrorism charges due to insufficient evidence. Judge Garnett had previously warned the Justice Department against public commentary. On January 23, a suppression hearing was held to assess whether evidence from Mangione\u2019s backpack, seized during his December 2024 arrest at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, would be admissible; Garnett ruled it would be. The federal trial is set to begin on October 13, 2026, if the death penalty is excluded. Meanwhile, New York State prosecutors, led by Assistant DA Joel Seidemann, have requested that the state trial begin on July 1, 2026, ahead of the federal trial, citing New York\u2019s interest in justice and public order. Agnifilo responded that the defense needs the remainder of 2026 to prepare and called the request unrealistic. On January 29, 2026, Mark Anderson, a Minnesota man, was charged with impersonating an FBI agent in an alleged attempt to free Mangione from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Anderson arrived with forged paperwork, claimed to have weapons, and was found with a pizza cutter and barbecue fork in his backpack\u2014items consistent with his prior employment at a Bronx pizzeria. He remains in custody at MDC Brooklyn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:52 PM\nSource:[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/luigi-mangione-death-penalty-dropped-1235507484/)\n\n**False FBI Agent Attempts to Free Luigi Mangione, Murder Suspect in 2024**\nLuigi Mangione, accused of murder in 2024 in connection with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, remains in prison as of January 30, 2026. A man named Mark Anderson, 36, attempted to free Mangione by impersonating an FBI agent and presenting a forged judicial order at a federal prison. Anderson is now facing federal prosecution in Brooklyn for fraud and impersonation. The attempt did not prevent Mangione\u2019s upcoming federal court hearing on July 1, 2026, which will determine whether charges three and four\u2014those that could lead to the death penalty\u2014will be dropped. Mangione faces dual legal proceedings: a federal case involving the FBI and a separate state case in New York, where the murder occurred. Despite being incarcerated, Mangione has gained significant support on social media, with some U.S. citizens viewing him as a hero. The outcome of both trials could result in two distinct sentences.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 01:36 PM\nSource:[MARCA](https://www.marca.com/tiramillas/sucesos/2026/01/30/falso-agente-fbi-intenta-liberar-luigi-mangione-acusado-asesinato-2024.html)\n\n**Luigi Mangione and His Fans: The Fervent Cult Around the CEO Killer**\nLuigi Mangione, a 26-year-old unknown man, allegedly killed Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, on December 4, 2024, in New York City. The murder sparked an unexpected wave of public sympathy and support for Mangione before his arrest, fueled by widespread dissatisfaction with the U.S. healthcare industry, which polls show is widely distrusted. During the five-day manhunt, internet users shared negative experiences with insurance companies, highlighted victims of denied claims, and began referring to Mangione as a 'vengeance hero' or 'hero'\u2014even offering public alibis and refusing to assist law enforcement. In response, insurance firms quickly removed executive photos from their profiles to prevent further retaliation. After Mangione\u2019s arrest and identity revelation\u2014described as a white, affluent, engineering graduate with a strong physical appearance\u2014he rapidly became a celebrity. His social media following exploded, forming a fervent online community known as 'mangionistas,' blending pop fandom, digital culture (memes, eroticization, merchandise), and activism against corporate power and the profit-driven U.S. healthcare system. Supporters have raised over $1.3 million through the 'December 4 Legal Committee' to fund his legal defense. The community, predominantly white, university-educated, and aged 20\u201335, has adopted green as a symbol (referencing Mario\u2019s brother Luigi) and displays it at all court appearances, often holding signs and chanting slogans. Their admiration extends to his clothing, which becomes highly sought after. Critics, including Dr. Joseph Richardson of The Guardian, argue this phenomenon reflects a 'white privilege bias,' noting that if Mangione were a young Black man, public perception would likely be drastically different.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 04:10 AM\nSource:[La Voz de Galicia](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/xlsemanal/personajes/luigi-mangione-fans-seguidores-fanaticos-asesinato-juicio.html)\n\n**Luigi Mangione stuns netizens with his jail playlist: Here's why**\nLuigi Mangione, a 27-year-old American charged with second-degree murder and weapons offenses in connection with the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has drawn widespread online attention after a handwritten letter dated June 3, 2025, surfaced on social media. In the letter, Mangione described his evolving music preferences while in solitary confinement at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, revealing he initially downloaded songs by Taylor Swift and Charli XCX out of curiosity, despite having no prior interest in them. He recounted how a fellow inmate, referred to as 'King,' intervened during a walk, criticized his playlist, and replaced all his music with tracks by Lil Durk. Mangione now listens to Lil Durk and, in a later note, expressed gratitude for currently listening to Rockwell's music. The letter also listed 27 things he is grateful for following his 27th birthday in May 2025, including support from family, friends, fans, and the Free Minds Book Club. Social media users, particularly on Reddit, reacted with humor and intrigue, praising the letter's authenticity and insight into Mangione\u2019s personality. According to his attorney, Mangione has maintained exemplary conduct, earning the informal title of 'ambassador' among fellow inmates. The letter has become a viral cultural moment, reflecting both personal reflection and public fascination with the case.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 11:26 AM\nSource:[The News International](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1354374-luigi-mangione-stuns-netizens-with-his-jail-playlist-heres-why)\n\n**Do Leftist Women Love Luigi Mangione?**\nOn September 16, 2024, three dozen women lined up outside Manhattan Criminal Court hours before Luigi Mangione\u2019s hearing, with one wearing a black T\u2011shirt that read 'Free Luigi' and another wearing a Luigi hat who told reporters, 'Whoever did commit that act, I really do see him as a hero and a martyr.'

Mangione was arrested after police found him carrying a false identity card under the name Mark\u202fRosario and a 9\u2011mm pistol identical to the weapon used in the killing, as well as a handwritten note saying \u2018esses parasitas merecem o que receberam\u2019. He faces federal, state and city charges that could lead to life imprisonment or the death penalty. Mangione has pleaded not guilty in New\u202fYork court. The case has sparked a massive online and offline support movement: according to researcher Joel\u202fFinkelstein, TikTok and Instagram hashtags such as \u2018destrua os ricos\u2019 rose 400\u202f% in the wake of the murder. Finkelstein notes that groups have mass\u2011produced memes, AI\u2011generated videos and sexualised merchandise to idolise Mangione. Other experts, including Gladys\u202fSharpp of Long Island and Jordan\u202fDunbar of the BBC, point to widespread frustration with the health\u2011insurance industry, economic inequality and the perceived beauty privilege of Mangione as drivers of the support. The mayor of New\u202fYork, Eric\u202fAdams, was photographed escorting Mangione from Pennsylvania to New\u202fYork, a move that critics say politicises the case. Mangione\u2019s lawyer, Karen\u202fFriedman\u202fAgnifilo, has complained that his rights are being violated, while a crowdfunding campaign for his defence has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. The trial is scheduled for 2025.
