## (a) Source Analysis

**Iranintl.com (Feb 2, 2026):**
This source provides detailed coverage of US-Iran diplomatic developments. Key factual elements include:
- Scheduled meeting between US envoy Witkoff and Iranian FM Araghchi in Turkey
- Trump's statement about ships heading to Iran
- Historical reference to June 2025 US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites
- Iranian domestic concerns about regime stability following protests

Quality assessment: Iran International is an opposition media outlet (Persian-language, UK-based). While it provides detailed reporting, it may carry anti-regime bias. The factual claims about diplomatic meetings and Trump statements appear credible and align with other sources. The internal regime concerns cited from Reuters adds credibility.

**Daily Sabah (Feb 2, 2026):**
Turkish perspective emphasizing Turkey's mediating role. Key facts:
- Protests peaked January 8-9, 2026
- Five rounds of nuclear talks stalled since May 2023
- US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites occurred in June 2025
- Potential Witkoff-Araghchi meeting in Turkey

Quality assessment: Daily Sabah is Turkish state-aligned media, so information favorable to Turkey's mediating role should be viewed skeptically. However, the timeline of protests and nuclear negotiations appears factual and corroborates other sources.

**WANA (Feb 2, 2026):**
Iranian state-aligned perspective. Claims include:
- Indirect talks likely to begin Sunday in Ankara
- US in "tactical retreat" (opinion, not fact)
- Israeli pressure on US to prevent agreement
- Khamenei's warning about regional war

Quality assessment: WANA is Iranian state media, so claims about US "retreat" and Iranian strength are propaganda. However, Khamenei's quoted statements and Israeli Channel 12 reports about Israeli conditions are likely factual. The article itself acknowledges "serious doubts" about claimed US shifts.

**Agent Report:**
Reports complete failure to obtain Metaculus question 41594's historical prediction data or even confirm the question's existence/wording. This is critical - we cannot analyze past community prediction movements without this data.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus meta-questions about community predictions on geopolitical crises**
   - Suitability: High - directly relevant question type
   - Challenge: Limited historical data on this specific format

2. **Metaculus predictions on US military action during acute crises**
   - Suitability: Medium-High - captures crowd behavior during tension spikes
   - Examples: Questions about US strikes on Syria, North Korea tensions
   - Pattern: Community predictions tend to spike during acute crisis periods, then decay rapidly if immediate action doesn't occur

3. **Forecasting crowd behavior on binary military action questions with short timeframes**
   - Suitability: High - captures psychological dynamics
   - Pattern: Crowds often overweight recent dramatic news, creating volatility

4. **Historical US-Iran crisis prediction patterns**
   - Suitability: Medium - captures domain-specific dynamics
   - Pattern: Multiple past escalations (2019-2020 Soleimani period, 2023-2024 proxy conflicts) saw prediction spikes that subsequently declined

**Most suitable reference class:** Metaculus community predictions on US military action during acute geopolitical crises, specifically examining how predictions move in the days following dramatic news but before resolution.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 days (Feb 2 to Feb 11, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**

1. **Target question deadline:** April 2026 (approximately 2 months away)
2. **Current situation assessment (as of Feb 2, 2026):**
   - Diplomatic talks scheduled/occurring in Turkey
   - Trump has moved from explicit military threats to "ships heading to Iran" + "talks going on"
   - No imminent military action announced
   - Crisis appears to be in diplomatic phase rather than pre-strike phase

3. **Historical pattern over 9-day windows during crises:**
   - Community predictions tend to be highly reactive to news cycles
   - In the absence of escalating military movements, predictions typically decline from crisis peaks
   - The June 2025 strikes on Iranian nuclear sites establish that Trump administration has already conducted military action, which may keep baseline probabilities elevated

4. **News cycle dynamics:**
   - Major diplomatic meetings in Turkey are occurring/scheduled
   - If talks fail dramatically, predictions could spike
   - If talks show any progress, predictions would likely decline
   - 9 days is long enough for multiple news cycles to influence the crowd

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether Metaculus community prediction will exceed 60% on Feb 11, 2026 for "Will US attack Iran before April 2026?"

**Key considerations:**

1. **Current trajectory suggests de-escalation, not escalation:** As of Feb 2, the dominant narrative is diplomatic engagement through Turkey, not imminent military action. Trump's rhetoric has shifted from direct threats to mentioning both ships and talks.

2. **Crowd psychology on military action questions:** Metaculus communities typically exhibit:
   - Recency bias: overweighting latest dramatic news
   - Mean reversion: predictions that spike on crisis news tend to decline if immediate action doesn't materialize
   - Anchoring on expert opinion and market signals

3. **The 60% threshold is quite high:** This represents 3:2 odds that the US will attack Iran within ~2 months. Given:
   - Active diplomatic engagement
   - No announced military mobilization for imminent strikes
   - Historical pattern where US-Iran crises often de-escalate after initial spikes
   - The June 2025 strikes may have satisfied some US objectives, reducing urgency

4. **Time decay factor:** With each day that passes without attack, the probability naturally decreases due to:
   - Fewer remaining days until April 2026
   - Diplomatic processes consuming time
   - Opportunity for de-escalation

5. **Uncertainty factors that could push predictions above 60%:**
   - Dramatic failure of Turkey talks
   - New Iranian provocation
   - Trump administration surprise announcement
   - Israeli pressure resulting in US action
   - However, these would need to occur within the next 9 days AND move the community substantially

**Base rate reasoning:** 
- If the community prediction is currently around 40-50% (typical for a plausible but not imminent military action), it would require significant escalatory news in the next 9 days to push above 60%
- If talks are ongoing and showing any diplomatic progress, predictions would more likely decline toward 30-40% range
- The meta-question resolves Yes only if the target question prediction exceeds 60% on Feb 11

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration factors:**

1. **No direct data on current Metaculus community prediction:** This is a critical limitation. Without knowing whether the current prediction is 30%, 50%, or 70%, uncertainty is high.

2. **Tethering to available information:**
   - The news cycle as of Feb 2 suggests diplomatic engagement, not imminent strikes
   - Historical patterns suggest crowd predictions decline when crises enter diplomatic phases
   - The 60% threshold is high and typically associated with imminent action expectations
   - 9 days is sufficient time for mean reversion if no escalatory news occurs

3. **Probability distribution reasoning:**
   - Scenario A (30% probability): Diplomatic talks collapse dramatically, new crisis emerges, community prediction spikes to >60% → Question resolves Yes
   - Scenario B (50% probability): Talks continue inconclusively, mixed news, prediction stays in 45-55% range → Question resolves No
   - Scenario C (20% probability): Talks show progress or no major news, prediction declines to 35-45% → Question resolves No

4. **Epistemic humility:** The lack of current Metaculus data creates substantial uncertainty. However, the outside view based on:
   - Crisis trajectory (toward diplomacy, not imminent action)
   - Historical crowd behavior during similar periods
   - The high bar of 60% threshold
   - 9-day timeframe for mean reversion

Suggests the probability the community prediction will exceed 60% on Feb 11 is relatively low.

5. **Calibration check:**
   - 25% = 1:3 odds against exceeding 60%
   - This reflects: high uncertainty from missing data, but base expectation that diplomatic trajectory will keep/push predictions below 60%
   - Not overconfident (avoiding <15%) given data gaps
   - Not hedged toward 50% given directional indicators

Outside View Prediction:
27%
