Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / alignment with resolution criteria
This resolves **Yes** if, at **2026-02-11 06:27:19Z**, the Metaculus community prediction for **“Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?”** is **>60.00%**.  
**Exception:** if the target question resolves before that timestamp, this question resolves to the same Yes/No as the target.

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date, facts vs opinions)
**NBC News (Feb 1, 2026)**  
- What it says: U.S. buildup; explosions in Iran (attributed to gas leak); tensions rising.  
- Quality: high mainstream; short segment, low detail.  
- Use: factual confirmation of tension; little forecasting content.

**Al Jazeera (Jan 31 / Feb 1, 2026)**  
- What it says: both sides signal talks; Trump references “armada”; Larijani says negotiation framework progressing; regional mediation (Qatar, Saudi, UAE, Turkey).  
- Quality: generally solid for regional diplomacy; factual quotes are useful; some narrative framing.  
- Use: credible evidence that diplomacy is active (pushes against extreme war probability).

**ABC News (late Jan / early Feb 2026)**  
- What it says: troop levels and carrier deployment; Iranian officials warn of strong response; Rubio frames buildup as “baseline”; background of June 2025 strikes.  
- Quality: high mainstream; mixes verified facts with casualty claims sourced to HRANA (not independently verified).  
- Use: strong on *observable military posture* and *public statements* (supports elevated risk but not necessarily imminent attack).

**BBC Verify-style piece (Jan 28, 2026)**  
- What it says: detailed OSINT on aircraft and base changes; quotes named experts (RUSI) suggesting strikes “sooner rather than later”; notes constraints and allied nervousness.  
- Quality: high—OSINT + identifiable expert commentary.  
- Use: strong evidence that capability/prep is real, which can move forecasters upward.

**PBS Washington Week panel (Jan 23, 2026)**  
- What it says: commentary that Trump may be preparing; “go big” incentive.  
- Quality: informed punditry, not reporting.  
- Use: weak-to-moderate; mostly opinion.

**Drop Site News “exclusive” (early Feb 2026)**  
- What it says: unnamed senior officials telling an ally to prepare for potential attack “this weekend.”  
- Quality: uncertain; could be accurate but relies on anonymous sources and a single outlet.  
- Use: moderate evidence *if* echoed elsewhere; alone it’s volatility fuel for prediction markets/Metaculus, but not rock-solid.

**AskNews items (selected):**
- **Fortune (Feb 1, 2026)** quotes Bob McNally (Rapidan) saying 75% chance of strike “days to weeks.” Quality: reputable outlet + identifiable expert, but still an expert subjective probability. Moderate evidence.  
- **WSJ / Anadolu summary (Feb 1, 2026)**: “U.S. must strengthen air defenses before attacking.” Quality: strong if accurately reflecting WSJ sourcing; implies *not yet ready for sustained retaliation environment* → moderates “imminent” narratives.  
- **Times of Israel blog (Feb 2, 2026)**: “Trump will not attack.” Quality: blog/opinion; weak evidence.  
- **Vučić predicts strike in 48 hours**: political speculation; weak.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted toward the resolution mechanism: Metaculus community >60% by Feb 11)
Key drivers of the *community prediction* exceeding 60%:

**Strong evidence (larger shifts)**
1) **Observable U.S. force posture + OSINT-confirmed preparations (BBC, ABC, NBC):** difficult-to-fake signals, raise perceived probability that an attack is a real option.  
2) **Prior precedent: June 2025 U.S. strikes already happened:** lowers “taboo threshold” for another U.S. strike; crowd may treat repeat action as more plausible than a first-time strike.

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)**
1) **Named-expert high estimate (Fortune/McNally 75% “days to weeks”):** can pull community upward, but Metaculus tends to discount single-expert point estimates.  
2) **Anonymous-source “imminent weekend” report (Drop Site):** could create short-run spikes; but reliability uncertainty prevents me from treating it as decisive.  
3) **Diplomatic talks signals (Al Jazeera; Trump/Larijani):** tends to cap probabilities and/or add mean reversion after spikes (pushes down).

**Weak evidence (small shifts)**
- Blogs, prophecy-style pieces, and non-expert predictions (Times of Israel blog; Vučić timing call).

**Important structural twist for *this* question:**  
If the U.S. actually attacks Iran **before Feb 11**, the target question resolves **YES**, and therefore **this question resolves YES regardless of the community %**. That adds a direct pathway to “Yes” besides “community >60%.”

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until our question resolves: ~**8.3 days** (Feb 2 → Feb 11).  
- Underlying target horizon: “attack before April 2026” (about **2 months** remaining).

If timeframe were **halved (~4 days)**: less time for Metaculus to digest/overshoot; I’d expect **lower** chance of >60% unless an attack occurs immediately.  
If timeframe were **doubled (~16–17 days)**: more opportunity for a talk breakdown or kinetic incident → **higher** chance the community crosses 60%.

### (d) Justification: updating the outside-view base rate (23%)
Outside view was anchored on “crowds rarely sustain >60% for war/attack questions absent kinetic events; diplomacy suppresses estimates.”

What makes the present case somewhat non-analogous (justifying an upward move, but not to a majority probability):
- **The U.S. has already struck Iranian nuclear sites (June 2025)**, so an additional strike is more thinkable than in most “will X attack Y” questions.
- **Credible force movements are visible and widely reported** (carrier, aircraft, defenses), likely increasing the Metaculus community estimate compared with a normal rhetorical crisis.
- **However, active mediation and talk signaling is also widely reported**, and the WSJ framing (“must strengthen defenses before attacking”) supports a view of *preparation without immediate launch*—this often keeps Metaculus in the ~40–60 band rather than pushing it cleanly above 60.

So I shift upward mainly because (i) the “imminent” narrative has some support, and (ii) there’s a real (even if small) chance the event happens before Feb 11, forcing a YES resolution here.

Probability calibration
I decompose the “Yes” probability into two routes:

1) **Route A: U.S. attack occurs before Feb 11** → target resolves YES → this resolves YES.  
- Given the mix of “imminent/weekend” reporting vs. countervailing “defenses not ready / talks ongoing,” I put this at **~7%**.

2) **Route B: No attack before Feb 11, but Metaculus community is >60% at the snapshot time.**  
- Conditional on no attack by then, I estimate **~31%** that Metaculus sits above 60% (i.e., crowd believes attack-by-April is more likely than not, despite negotiations).

Combine:
- P(Yes) ≈ 0.07 + 0.93 * 0.31 = **0.358** → **~36%**.

Checklist:
1) Criteria: Yes if Metaculus community % on Q41594 is >60% at 2026-02-11 06:27:19Z; if target resolves earlier, inherit its Yes/No.  
2) Outside view base rate: 23%.  
3) Consistency: “36 out of 100 times, either attack happens before Feb 11 or community is >60% at snapshot.” Reasonable.  
4) Key evidence: (i) OSINT-backed U.S. buildup (BBC/ABC), (ii) ongoing talks/mediation (Al Jazeera), (iii) WSJ ‘air defense not yet ready’ dampener, (iv) some ‘imminent strike’ claims (Drop Site/Fortune expert) increasing upside risk.  
5) Blind spot: a sudden kinetic incident (Iran hits U.S. assets / assassination / misfire) could spike Metaculus well above 60 quickly.  
6) Status quo: most crises de-escalate into talks; supports staying below 50% more often than not, keeping my forecast <50%.

Probability: 36%
