Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **Iranintl liveblog (Feb 2, 2026)**
- **What it says (facts as presented):** Reports (largely via Reuters/Axios/FT references) that U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran FM Abbas Araghchi *could* meet in Turkey; Iran signals some potential flexibility on enrichment in some accounts while senior adviser Shamkhani says shipping enriched uranium abroad is “off the table”; Trump claims “ships heading to Iran”; warnings from Iran that a U.S. attack could broaden into regional conflict.
- **What it is (quality):** A liveblog-style aggregation. It includes **some high-quality upstream sourcing** (Reuters) but also **unsourced/opaque claims** and fast-moving statements. Useful for situational awareness, weaker for precise inference.
- **Implication for our forecast target (community >60% by Feb 11):** The dominant theme is **active diplomacy plus deterrent rhetoric**, not unmistakable pre-attack indicators. That usually pushes community forecasts **away from near-certainty**.

2) **Daily Sabah / Reuters write-up (Feb 2, 2026)**
- **What it says (facts as presented):** Turkey mediating; U.S. sent another warship; Pentagon readiness; tensions tied to Iran protests/crackdown; nuclear talks context; importantly, it asserts **U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025** and that Iran claims enrichment work has stopped since then.
- **What it is (quality):** Reuters-based reporting is generally **high reliability** on “who said what / what moved where,” though still imperfect. This is the strongest source among the three articles.
- **Implication:** Even with prior U.S. strikes (June 2025), this does not automatically mean a further U.S. “attack” before April 2026 is >60% likely. It may raise baseline risk, but current reporting emphasizes **talks and mediation**.

3) **WANA (Feb 2, 2026)**
- **What it says (facts as presented):** Claims indirect talks likely in Ankara; asserts U.S. is in “tactical retreat”; predicts talks likely to fail; claims Israeli pressure for strikes; mixes reporting with narrative framing.
- **What it is (quality):** Explicitly partisan/advocacy-leaning outlet (“Iranian perspective”); contains **interpretive claims** that are difficult to verify. Treat as low/medium reliability unless corroborated.
- **Implication:** Provides a plausible pathway to escalation (talks fail → confrontation) but not enough to expect a community forecast to cross 60% within ~9 days.

4) **Agent report**
- **What it says (facts):** No usable Metaculus historical probability series was retrieved; therefore we cannot anchor to an observed trendline or compare “where the community is now.”
- **Quality:** Methodologically transparent. The key point is an **evidence gap**: we must rely on reference classes and typical community behavior rather than direct Metaculus data.
- **Implication:** Forces a more “outview” baseline: how often do communities push above 60% on near-term military attack questions without a very strong mobilization/trigger signal?

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Because the question is **about the Metaculus community forecast exceeding 60%** (not directly about whether the U.S. attacks), the best reference classes are about **crowd-forecast behavior**:

1) **Metaculus (or similar) community probabilities on “Will country X attack country Y by date Z?”**
- Typical pattern: communities are **conservative** and usually stay **below 60%** unless there are concrete, widely recognized pre-attack indicators (clear ultimatum + force posture + diplomatic breakdown + trigger incident).
- Suitability: High (closest to what we’re forecasting), though we lack direct historical series here.

2) **General base rate of major interstate attacks within ~2 months during crisis diplomacy**
- These events are uncommon; diplomacy often persists longer than expected; deterrence and off-ramps matter.
- Suitability: Medium (helps bound plausibility), but it’s one step removed from “community >60%.”

**Most suitable:** (1) community-behavior reference class, supplemented by (2) real-world base rates to keep the community-level inference grounded.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast window:** From **today (2026-02-02)** to the measurement time **2026-02-11**: ~**9 days**.
- **Target question horizon:** “before April 2026” (roughly ~7–9 weeks remaining as of Feb 11, depending on the exact cutoff).
- **Historical pattern over similar periods (qualitative):**
  - In many geopolitical questions, probabilities can swing sharply in days, but usually only with **high-salience triggers** (e.g., embassy evacuations, explicit authorization, troop surges, strikes, assassinations, downed aircraft/ship, definitive collapse of talks).
  - Here, the dominant near-term signal in the sources is **scheduled/anticipated talks** (Turkey mediation), which tends to **cap** community probability below “likely” unless paired with unmistakable strike preparations.

---

### (d) Justification for an outside-view prediction (community >60% by Feb 11)

**Status quo if nothing major changes in the next 9 days:** active diplomacy + elevated rhetoric + some military posture. In that status quo, communities typically do **not** price >60% for “U.S. attack Iran before April” because:
- “Attack” is a high-stakes act with many off-ramps; even in tense periods, the modal outcome is often **no attack in the next ~2 months**.
- The reporting emphasizes **possible meetings and negotiation frameworks**, not a clear countdown to strikes.
- To exceed **60%**, the community would usually need **new, widely confirmed** escalation evidence (e.g., talks definitively fail plus visible force flow plus explicit deadline/ultimatum plus credible trigger). The current information set doesn’t show that yet.

**Outside-view bottom line:** With diplomacy ongoing and no unmistakable trigger in hand, the base expectation is that the community forecast will remain **≤60%** by Feb 11. Crossing 60% is plausible but would likely require a discrete escalation headline between now and then.

Outside view calibration:

- I’m forecasting **P(community prediction > 60% on Feb 11)**, not P(attack happens).
- Outside-view anchor: on comparable “near-term war/strike by date” questions, the crowd is more often **sub-60** than **super-60**, absent very strong pre-attack signals.
- Given (i) only **9 days** for the community to move, and (ii) current news flow featuring **talks/mediation** rather than a decisive breakdown, I calibrate to a **low-to-moderate** chance of surpassing 60%.

Outside View Prediction:
**18%**
