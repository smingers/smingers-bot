Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, all dates 2026 unless noted)

1. NBC News video (1 Feb) – Short on-scene clip: confirms new U.S. force flows and explosions in Iran.  Reliable for “what happened”, weak on intent.  
2. Al-Jazeera report (31 Jan) – Straight newswire style; quotes Trump, Larijani, regional officials; good factual quality.  Shows simultaneous diplomacy + deterrence.  
3. ABC News (c. 30 Jan) – Long piece with troop numbers, casualty claims, many direct quotes; mainstream, high reliability for U.S. moves, lower for Iranian casualty figures.  
4. BBC verify (28 Jan) – Open-source imagery, named analysts; very solid for “military build-up is real”.  
5. PBS/Washington Week panel (23 Jan) – Commentary by veteran journalists; high opinion content, but from identifiable experts.  
6. DropSiteNews “exclusive” (early Feb) – Single-sourced claims of strikes “this weekend”.  Partly sensational, some corroboration by unnamed officials; treat as moderate reliability.  
7. Fortune interview with Bob McNally (1 Feb) – Named energy analyst gives 75 % attack probability “days to weeks”.  Moderate-strong: expert but talking probability, not fact.  
8. Wall Street Journal/Anadolu (1 Feb) – Cites U.S. officials saying air-defence gaps remain; reputable; weakly points away from very-imminent strike.  
9. Anadolu (Zamir) (1 Feb) – Israeli CoS expects attack 2 – 8 weeks out; named senior figure, so moderate evidence.  
10. Times of Israel op-ed (2 Feb) – Signed commentary insisting Trump will not strike; low weight, but gives counter-argument.  
11. Remaining Asknews articles (HuffPost-FR, Haberler, etc.) – Mostly re-package same facts; limited new data; weak weight.  

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• All major outlets agree on exceptional U.S. force build-up (BBC, NBC, ABC, Al-Jazeera) – pushes Metaculus upward.  
• History: Metaculus rarely crosses 60 % on “major-power attack” questions without a triggering incident – structural drag on probability.

Moderate evidence  
• Multiple expert statements claiming high near-term risk (McNally 75 %, DropSite “this weekend”, Zamir 2-8 wks).  
• WSJ officials stressing missing air-defences – suggests window is not “days”, tempers the above.  

Weak evidence  
• Anonymous betting chatter (KP.RU, Polymarket spike) – noisy, could evaporate.  
• Prophecy / astrology pieces – ignore.

Net effect: strong upward pressure from force posture + expert alarm, offset by credible reports that the U.S. is still locking in air-defence and exploring talks.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Target measurement in 9 days (-> 11 Feb).  
If the window were doubled (18 days) I’d raise the chance ~+6 pp: more time for either attack or sentiment spike.  
Halved (5 days) I’d cut ~-5 pp: too little time for opinion to crest 60 % absent shooting.

(d) Justification / inside-view update

Outside-view base rate (18 %) came from:  
• Historical Metaculus behaviour (rarely >60 % without combat under way).  
Adjustments:  
+7 pp  Exceptional, well-documented force build-up unprecedented since June 2025.  
+4 pp  Cluster of named experts talking 60–75 % odds in the next “days–weeks”.  
-3 pp  Simultaneous mediation efforts and U.S. admission that defences are not yet ready.  
-2 pp  Nine-day horizon is short; crowd usually waits for firmer triggers.  

Inside-view probability ≈ 24 %.  Round to 25 % for clarity.

Breakdown (rough cut)  
• 10 % U.S. actually attacks before 11 Feb ⇒ target question resolves Yes immediately ⇒ meta resolves Yes.  
• 15 % No attack, but news cycle pushes Metaculus to >60 %.  
• 75 % Neither happens (community stays ≤60 %).  

Probability calibration
Given current evidence, I expect that in 25 out of 100 similar nine-day stretches the Metaculus community prediction would exceed 60 %.

Checklist:
1. Restated question: Will Metaculus community forecast for “U.S. attack Iran before Apr 2026” be >60 % on 11 Feb 2026 06:27 UTC (or resolve earlier)?  
2. Base rate used: 18 % (historical crowd reluctance to cross 60 %).  
3. Consistency line: “25 out of 100 times, the community prediction ends up over 60 %.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Unprecedented U.S. force build-up; b) High attack odds voiced by McNally/Zamir; c) Reports of missing U.S. air-defence, implying delay; d) Active U.S.–Iran mediation in Turkey.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden Iranian provocation (e.g., missile strike on U.S. asset) within days could skyrocket probabilities—would push chance over 60 % quickly.  
6. Status-quo bias applied: 60 % threshold still unlikely to be breached in only nine days without shooting; nudged forecast downward accordingly.

Probability: 25%
