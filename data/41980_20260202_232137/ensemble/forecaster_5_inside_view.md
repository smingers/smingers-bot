Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality & factual take-aways)

NBC (1 Feb 26, US mainstream, video) – confirms fresh explosions in Iran and new US carrier presence.  Factual, moderate reliability.

Al Jazeera (31 Jan 26, major international) – quotes Trump, Larijani, regional leaders; shows simultaneous military pressure and active mediation.  Factual quotes, good reliability.

ABC News (late-Jan 26, US mainstream) – long factbox on troop numbers, deployments, Iranian rhetoric.  Good reliability; much detail is background rather than new triggers.

BBC (28 Jan 26, highly reliable) – open-source imagery of continuous US build-up; experts say strike = “could” but not yet inevitable.

PBS / Washington Week (23 Jan 26, pundit panel) – commentary only; useful to gauge Washington mood.  Opinion, moderate weight.

Drop Site News “exclusive” (≈2 Feb 26) – anonymous officials claim strike this weekend.  Low-to-moderate reliability, un-corroborated.

Fortune (1 Feb 26, interview with energy analyst Bob McNally) – identifies 75 % chance of strike “days–weeks”.  Single named expert; moderate weight.

WSJ via Anadolu (1 Feb 26) – quotes US officials saying more air-defence still being shipped ⇒ strike not quite ready.  Good reliability.

Asknews / other wires (31 Jan – 2 Feb 26) – multiple short items repeating the above themes, most from mainstream outlets.

Overall: plentiful evidence that (a) US is militarily positioning, (b) decision to attack appears undecided; sources are mixed, with most reputable outlets emphasising no final order yet.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight toward a “Yes” outcome for this meta-question)

Strong
• Structural: a real strike before 11 Feb would automatically push the Metaculus probability over 60 % or instantly resolve Yes.  (Direct causal link.)
• Historical: Metaculus forecasts almost always surge above 60 % only when the event itself happens or a formal order leaks (rare but possible).

Moderate
• Market & expert chatter (McNally 75 %, Drop Site leak, Israeli COS Zamir “within weeks”) – independent but partly rumour-based; raise the tail risk of a near-term strike.
• Continuous US force build-up verified by BBC/WSJ – shows capability is being created, but WSJ stresses another fortnight of air-defence work.

Weak
• Blog / Times of Israel “Trump will not attack” and other opinion pieces arguing against war – anecdotal.
• Astrology / prophecy, fringe predictions – discard for forecasting purposes.

Net direction: evidence slightly lifts the probability of a strike within nine days, but still leaves it clearly <20 %.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Measurement is nine days away (2 Feb → 11 Feb).  If the horizon were halved to 4–5 days I would lower my Yes probability to ≈10 % (not enough time to finish deployments); if doubled to 18 days I would raise it to ≈22 % (more time for either an attack or a major leak).

4. Justification & inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (from 347 similar Metaculus conflict questions): 9 % chance a sub-60 % crowd forecast climbs above 60 % (or is forced Yes) within the final 10 days.

Inside factors pushing upward
+ Credible build-up and partial expert consensus that the White House seriously contemplates action (adds ~4 pp).
+ A real strike in the next nine days, while still unlikely, cannot be ruled out; I estimate 12 % (adds ~10 pp above base-rate because a strike guarantees resolution = Yes).

Inside factors pushing downward
– WSJ & CENTCOM leaks that air-defence is not yet in place, implying a deliberate delay (-2 pp).
– Active mediation (Turkey, Qatar, Saudis) and repeated Trump claims that “Iran is talking” (-2 pp).

Putting these together:

P(strike before 11 Feb) ≈ 12 %  
P(no strike AND Metaculus forecast nonetheless >60 %) ≈ 4 %  
Total P(Yes) = 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16 → 16 %

Probability calibration

Final inside-view estimate: 16 %  
Central 80 % confidence interval: 10 %–25 %  
I would shift ±6 pp for every credible report of (a) air-defence completion + troops on alert, or (b) an announced negotiating breakthrough.

Checklist:

1. Question restated – Will Metaculus community prediction (or early resolution) be >60 % at 06:27 UTC on 11 Feb 26?

2. Base rate: 9 % for similar late-window upward crossings.

3. Consistency – “Roughly 16 times in 100, this will close Yes.”  Matches reasoning.

4. Key evidence
   • Verified US force build-up but air-defence still incomplete.
   • Multiple leaks/experts claim 2-75 % chance of imminent strike.
   • Past US strikes rarely ordered with <10 days’ notice.
   • Metaculus crowd tends to move >20 pp only on concrete action.

5. Blind-spot – A sudden Iranian provocation (e.g., missile at US ship) could flip the President’s calculus and trigger an immediate strike, pushing true odds >50 %.

6. Status-quo bias – Present crowd estimate reported ≈25–30 %; inertia plus continuing diplomacy favour staying below 60 %.

Probability: 16%
