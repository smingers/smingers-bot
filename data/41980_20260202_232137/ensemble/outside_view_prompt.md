You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 60.00% on 2026-02-11 for the Metaculus question "Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-11 06:27:19 is higher than 60.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 60.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-11 06:27:19, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

Query: Provide historical daily community prediction data for Metaculus question 41594 since January 1 2026 and summarize the five largest one-day changes; then list major real-world events related to US–Iran conflict or protests from Jan 15 2026 to Feb 2 2026 likely to influence forecasts.
The additional web-search passes brought in no new primary documents.  All five test strings returned “No usable content extracted,” which means we still have:

1. Zero numerical history for Metaculus question 41594 after 1 January 2026  
2. No confirmation that an API or Wayback snapshot for that question even exists  
3. No page title or wording for the question, so we cannot prove that the U S–Iran news flow would plausibly move its probability time-series

Because of this continued data vacuum, the first half of the original user request remains unanswerable: there is literally nothing to tabulate, so we cannot deliver daily community predictions or calculate the five largest one-day swings.

What we can do—based on the narrative assembled earlier—is describe the real-world events between 15 Jan 2026 and 2 Feb 2026 that would be most likely to influence a crowd forecast on a U S–Iran conflict or Iranian-protest question.  However, even that summary still lacks sourceable citations from the latest crawl because none of the search hits returned actual articles.  Consequently, the second half of the request can be written only as an unsupported outline, which is not acceptable under the requirement to cite evidence.

Remaining information gaps
• Metaculus data feed (CSV, JSON, screenshot, or archived HTML) for question 41594  
• Any article text, title, or URL for the January–February 2026 Iran conflict/protest events so the chronology can be sourced  
• Secondary outlets (Reuters, AFP, AP, BBC, NPR, etc.) to corroborate casualty figures, troop movements, and official statements

Conclusion: the project is still blocked by missing primary material on both sub-tasks.  Further targeted searching is required before a satisfactory answer can be drafted.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
