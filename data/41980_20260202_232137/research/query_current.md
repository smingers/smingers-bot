Analysis:
The metaculus community probability tends to react sharply to any concrete evidence of escalation—e.g., U.S. force deployments to the Gulf, leaks of strike planning, congressional or White-House statements, Israeli requests for support, or Iranian actions such as a nuclear “break-out” or attacks on U.S. personnel. Conversely, signs of de-escalation (diplomatic overtures, back-channel talks, troop withdrawals) usually drag the probability down. With the current cp sitting exactly at 60 %, a swing of only a few percentage points will decide this meta-question. Therefore, the most relevant news items between now and 11 Feb 2026 are:  
• any indication the U.S. is preparing or authorising strikes (carrier strike-group movements, CENTCOM statements, DoD budget reprogramming, leaks from NSC)  
• Iranian provocations that could trigger U.S. retaliation (missile/drone attacks on U.S. bases, threats to close Strait of Hormuz, accelerated uranium enrichment)  
• U.S. domestic politics (Trump’s public rhetoric, congressional resolutions, campaign-season calculations)  
• Israeli or Gulf-ally lobbying for joint action  
• Intelligence community or think-tank reports shifting expert sentiment.  

The search should therefore focus on very recent (late Jan – early Feb 2026) coverage of U.S.–Iran military developments, high-level statements, and expert analyses that forecasters would digest before updating their Metaculus predictions.
