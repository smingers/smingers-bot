Developments:\n\n### US Military Build-up\n- The US has been conducting a \"slow, steady and significant build-up\" of US military forces in the region since Trump's message to Iranian protesters that \"help is on its way\"\n- The US already maintains up to 50,000 military personnel in the Middle East, with around 10,000 based at al-Udeid Airbase in Qatar\n- US has bases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates\n\n### Tracked Military Movements\nAccording to BBC Verify and open source intelligence:\n- Scores of additional US military aircraft have arrived in the region over recent weeks\n- New structures appearing at al-Udeid Air Force Base, with experts identifying what appear to be new anti-air defenses\n- Arrival of F-15 fighter jets and refueling tankers\n- Drones and P-8 Poseidon spy planes operating near Iranian airspace\n- Transport aircraft believed to be carrying more air defense systems\n- RC-135s, E-11 A BACN, and E-3 G Sentry early warning and spy aircraft (same types present during Operation Midnight Hammer)\n- Britain has sent a squadron of Typhoon jets \"to boost regional security\"\n\n### USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group\n- Ordered to turn around from Indo-Pacific region and head to the Gulf\n- Carries an air wing of around 70 aircraft including F-35 stealth jets\n- Accompanied by three destroyers with Tomahawk cruise missiles and typically a nuclear-powered submarine\n- Evidence suggests it could be operating near Oman (as of Monday)\n- This is in addition to two US destroyers already in the region\n\n### Trump's Statements\n- Trump warned Iran that unless it makes a deal to limit its nuclear program, \"the next attack will be far worse!\"\n- Said a \"massive Armada\" was heading to Iran, \"ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary\"\n- Called for Iran to negotiate but said time was \"running out\"\n\n### US Air Force Operations\n- Conducting major exercise \"Operation Agile Spartan\" to \"demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower across the US Central Command area of responsibility\"\n\n### Background Context\n- Last June's \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" targeted Iran's nuclear facilities with over 100 aircraft including B-2 stealth jets\n- After those strikes, Tehran launched missiles at al-Udeid\n\n## Expert Analysis:\n\n**Stefan Watkins** (ship/aircraft tracker):\n- The arrival of early warning and spy aircraft \"might suggest\" strikes are \"coming sooner rather than later\"\n\n**Matthew Savill** (Director of Military Sciences at Rusi defense think tank, former UK government Iran policy official):\n- Current US military posture means they \"could probably go almost anywhere in Iran and strike almost anything, apart from the most deeply buried facilities\" (which would require B-2 bombers)\n\n### Potential Target Options (per Savill):\n1. **Military capabilities**: Iran's ballistic missile threat or coastal missile batteries to make retaliation harder\n2. **Regime centers of power**: Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias suppressing protesters\n3. **Leadership decapitation**: More difficult and dangerous; unclear what cumulative effect would be\n\n### Caveats (per Savill):\n- \"We could be witnessing the final death throes of this current regime, but the problem is that could take months or even years to play out\"\n- Trump must \"weigh the desire to be seen as decisive with the chances of actually achieving a decisive impact\"\n- Trump has shown willingness to use military force but prefers short, sharp, limited interventions rather than long, protracted conflicts\n- Trump has not ruled out a diplomatic solution requiring Iran to limit its nuclear program\n\n### Regional Concerns:\n- Iran still has significant stockpiles of short-range ballistic missiles and long-range drones\n- Some Gulf allies are nervous; some have already made clear they will not support more US strikes\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2026/01/will-trump-attack-iran-in-2026-2\">\n# Summary

U.S. President Donald Trump alternated between threatening military action\u2014announcing the deployment of a naval 'armada' to the Persian Gulf\u2014and expressing hope for a diplomatic resolution, dismissing Khamenei's warnings as rhetorical. Analysts suggest that in the event of an American strike, Iran's retaliation would likely be more intense than in June 2025, when it responded to Israeli-American airstrikes with measured attacks. Experts such as Amir Azimi of the BBC and the New York Times note Iran may abandon its previous calibrated approach, potentially launching more aggressive strikes against U.S. and allied bases in the region. Iran has reportedly doubled its missile production since the June conflict and deployed launchers in mountainous areas, making them harder to destroy. The threat extends to Israel, whose 'Iron Dome' defense system may be vulnerable during moments of high stress, as noted by Middle East specialist Gilles Kepel. Regional allies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have pledged not to allow U.S. forces to use their airspace or territory for attacks on Iran, aiming to avoid retaliation. Despite Iran's military capabilities, including advanced missile arsenals, experts such as geopolitical analyst Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Encel argue that Iran lacks the capacity to win a regional war. The Wall Street Journal reports that a large-scale U.S. attack is not imminent, as the Pentagon is reinforcing defenses with THAAD and Patriot systems across the region. Additionally, Iran's regional influence has weakened due to reduced support from proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis, who showed reluctance to retaliate in June 2025. Iran remains diplomatically isolated, limiting its strategic options.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:25 PM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/article/l-iran-menace-de-provoquer-une-guerre-regionale-en-cas-d-attaque-americaine-mais-en-est-il-capable_259919.html)\n\n**The Blogs: President Trump Will Not Attack Iran**\nAccording to an article published on February 2, 2026, by The Times of Israel, US President Donald Trump will not launch a military attack on Iran, despite earlier naval deployments near Iranian waters, including a US destroyer in the Gulf of Eilat and a so-called 'naval armada' positioned off Iran's coast. The destroyer departed at 9:10 PM the previous night after three days of idling. When questioned about the fleet's purpose, Trump reportedly said, 'Well, they have to float somewhere, so they may as well float there,' indicating a lack of aggressive intent. The article argues that Trump avoids military action against Iran because such a conflict would risk American troop casualties, which could destabilize his MAGA base\u2014especially given his campaign promise to avoid foreign wars. While Trump authorized B2 bombing runs against Iran in June 2025, those operations carried minimal risk due to prior Israeli disruption of Iran\u2019s air defenses, resulting in no casualties. Similarly, the January 3, 2026, operation in Venezuela to kidnap the president and his wife involved no fatalities due to meticulous planning and low-risk conditions. In contrast, a military strike on Iran would pose significant danger to US forces, particularly due to Iran\u2019s missile capabilities and the vulnerability of US aircraft carriers. The article also notes that over 30,000 Iranians have reportedly been killed and over 200,000 injured in Iran this month under the regime, but these casualties have not led to meaningful change. The author expresses pessimism about regional stability, citing Iran\u2019s continued rearmament and the persistence of threats from its proxies, echoing a 1993 prediction by former Knesset member Elyakim Ha'etzni that Israel would remain in a perpetual state of war or near-war, a prognosis now seen as tragically accurate for 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:42 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/president-trump-will-not-attack-iran/)\n\n**Vu\u010di\u0107 Predicts Iran Will Face Attack Within 48 Hours as Tensions Escalate**\nOn February 1, 2026, Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 stated in an interview that he predicted Iran would face a military strike within the next 48 hours, linking the timing to the release of Epstein-related documents. On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump told the media that he hopes Iran will reach a nuclear deal with the U.S., otherwise 'the world will soon see' whether Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei's warning is valid. Earlier that morning, Khamenei told Iranian citizens that if the U.S. initiates war, it would trigger a 'full-scale regional war,' and that the Iranian people would respond with firm resistance to any aggression. Trump said he was not surprised by Khamenei\u2019s statement but emphasized that 'if we don\u2019t reach an agreement, we\u2019ll soon find out if he\u2019s right.' Trump reiterated the U.S. military\u2019s large-scale deployment of forces near Iran, stating that the U.S. Navy\u2019s most powerful warships are 'right there, very close.' Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in an interview with CNN, said Iran no longer trusts the U.S. as a negotiating partner. He noted that some friendly regional countries are acting as intermediaries to rebuild trust between the two sides. He added that if Iran can continue uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes, 'any detail is negotiable,' and Iran is ready to achieve results through any format of talks. Amir-Abdollahian stressed that Iran\u2019s military is fully prepared and more thoroughly deployed than during the previous conflict, but clarified that 'preparation does not mean we want war\u2014we want to avoid war.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:43 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260202/49217358.html)\n\n**What Comes After SVO? The Words of Zhirinovsky Sound Like Prophecy**\nVladimir Zhirinovsky's predictions about future international conflicts have resurfaced in public attention, particularly regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Long before the start of the Special Military Operation (SVO), Zhirinovsky repeatedly stated that a large-scale war in Ukraine was inevitable and would mark a turning point in global politics. He forecasted that the conflict would proceed through several tense phases and conclude by 2026, framing it not as a regional issue but as a pivotal element in a broader global confrontation involving Russia, European nations, and the United States. He believed the Ukrainian crisis would test the resilience of Western alliances and lead to fundamental changes in the existing world order, including the gradual weakening of old political and economic structures and the emergence of a new international configuration. According to Zhirinovsky, the end of the conflict would serve as a starting point for a major realignment of global influence and a reevaluation of borders and alliance commitments in the post-Soviet space. Several of his past predictions have reportedly come true: the election of Barack Obama as the first Black U.S. president in 2009; the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (Euromaidan), which led to Viktor Yanukovych's flight; the annexation of Crimea in 2014; a 2022 prediction of Russia's return to greatness, with the SVO beginning on February 24, 2022 (though he was off by two days); the 2023 Israel-Hamas war and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; a 2016 warning about a potential assassination of Donald Trump, which occurred in July 2024; and the 2021 warning about unrest in Kazakhstan, which erupted in January 2022. However, some of his predictions did not materialize: he died on April 6, 2022, at age 75, before reaching 80 or running for president for the eighth time, and he also failed to predict the collapse of the United States or the absence of U.S. elections in 2024. The article was published on February 2, 2026, by Tsargrad TV.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:30 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/chto-budet-posle-svo-slova-zhirinovskogo-zvuchat-kak-prorochestvo_1539736)\n\n**Top energy expert says probability the U.S. will attack Iran soon is 75% as risk of major disruption to oil supply is priced in  --  'this one is real' | Fortune**\nAccording to Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy Group and former White House energy advisor, there is a 75% probability of a U.S. military strike on Iran within the coming days to weeks, citing escalating tensions following Iran's violent crackdown on protests that began in late December 2025. President Donald Trump has warned Iran against killing protesters and signaled support, while the recent deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the Middle East has heightened expectations of imminent action. Brent crude oil futures have risen 5% in the past week and 14% since the start of the year, breaking a year-long downtrend pattern. McNally emphasized that unlike past conflicts\u2014such as the limited 2025 U.S. strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities or the failed raid to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro\u2014this situation is different because markets are now pricing in the risk of a sustained disruption to global energy flows. Iran produced 4.7 million barrels per day in 2025, contributing 4.4% of global oil supply, with much of it shipped via a shadow fleet to China. The primary risk lies in Iran potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil and liquefied natural gas passes. Although markets assume the U.S. Navy can quickly neutralize threats like underwater mines, McNally argues this underestimates Iran\u2019s superior coastal geography and weaponry, noting the U.S. failed to fully suppress Houthi attacks in the Persian Gulf. Iran\u2019s supreme leader has issued a direct warning that any U.S. attack would trigger a regional war. Meanwhile, Axios reports that the Trump administration has signaled openness to backchannel negotiations with Tehran. McNally warned that if the Strait of Hormuz were blocked for more than one or two days, the LNG market would face a 'mother of all bidding' on spot cargoes, as the assumption of a rapid U.S. military victory may not hold in practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:53 PM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/02/01/us-attack-iran-probability-75-percent-disruption-risk-oil-supply-crude-prices/)\n\n**Wall Street Journal: U.S. Must Strengthen Air Defense Before Attacking Iran**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, the United States must strengthen its air defense systems in the Middle East before launching any potential strike against Iran. The report, published on February 1, 2026, states that the Pentagon is currently in the process of deploying additional air defense systems\u2014specifically, high-altitude THAAD batteries and Patriot missile systems\u2014to better protect U.S. forces, Israel, and Arab allies in case of retaliation or a prolonged conflict. Although the U.S. could execute a 'limited airstrike' against Iran if President Donald Trump issued an order today, officials believe the country is not yet adequately prepared to withstand potential retaliatory attacks. Satellite imagery confirms that the Pentagon has not yet completed the deployment of these systems in key U.S. military bases across the region, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Susan Maloney, a former U.S. State Department official on Iran policy, emphasized that air defense readiness is critical to protecting U.S. troops and assets from possible Iranian retaliation. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Washington is negotiating with Tehran but expressed pessimism about reaching a positive outcome. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that any U.S. attack on Iran would trigger a regional war. Iran claims the U.S. uses sanctions, pressure, and unrest to justify foreign intervention and aims to change its regime, threatening a 'comprehensive and unprecedented' response to any attack, even a 'limited' one. Israel and the U.S. accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, including electricity generation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:21 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A/%D9%88%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/3817310)\n\n**Khamenei warns US of 'regional war' if Iran is attacked**\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned the United States on February 1, 2026, that any attack on Iran would trigger a 'regional war,' speaking during the anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s return from exile in 1979. His remarks came amid heightened tensions following the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, jet fighters, and navy destroyers to the Middle East, coinciding with widespread antigovernment protests in January 2026 that began over the collapse of the Iranian rial and escalated into a direct challenge to Khamenei\u2019s rule. Iranian state media reported 3,117 deaths during the unrest, including 2,427 civilians and security personnel, though US-based rights groups claim over 6,000 were killed\u2014figures Al Jazeera could not independently verify. Khamenei labeled the protests a 'coup' orchestrated by foreign agents, accusing demonstrators of attacking police, government centers, Revolutionary Guard facilities, banks, mosques, and burning copies of the Quran. The US, under President Donald Trump, has repeatedly threatened military action, initially linking it to Iran\u2019s treatment of protesters, then shifting focus to securing a nuclear deal. Indirect talks between Iranian and American officials occurred in Oman in June 2025 before Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran, during which the US joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Despite aggressive rhetoric, both nations have confirmed open communication channels to prevent military conflict. On February 1, 2026, Trump stated that Iran was 'seriously talking' with Washington, while Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani affirmed Tehran\u2019s readiness for negotiations. Trump emphasized that Iran should agree to a deal with 'no nuclear weapons,' though he expressed uncertainty about whether Tehran would accept such terms, adding, 'But they are talking to us.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:28 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked)\n\n**Zamir Expects a U.S. Military Strike Against Iran Within Two to Four Weeks**\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir predicted that the United States may launch a military attack against Iran within two weeks to two months, according to Israel's Army Radio, which reported that Zamir emphasized during a recent assessment session that this is a period of uncertainty and that the attack is likely to occur within that timeframe. The radio also noted that there are no expectations of an attack in the immediate coming days and that the U.S. does not fully inform Israel about its decisions, excluding it from key strategic deliberations. Concerns in Israel include the possibility that former U.S. President Donald Trump might reach an agreement with Iran focused solely on nuclear weapons, without addressing ballistic missiles. Meanwhile, Israel's official broadcasting authority stated that Zamir held intensive discussions with senior U.S. officials over the weekend and claimed there is full coordination between Washington and Tel Aviv. A senior Israeli military official, cited by the broadcasting authority, stated that Israel cannot coexist with Iran\u2019s current ballistic missile capabilities. Tensions have escalated since mass protests in Iran began in late December 2025 over deteriorating economic and living conditions. Iran acknowledged public discontent and accused the U.S. and Israel of using sanctions, pressure, and inciting unrest to justify military intervention and regime change. In a prior conflict, on June 13, 2025, Israel, with U.S. backing, launched a 12-day attack on Iran targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites, assassinating leaders and scientists. On June 22, the U.S. attacked Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming they were 'eliminated,' prompting Iran to strike the U.S. 'Al-Adid' base with a drone. On June 24, the U.S. announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%BA%D8%B6%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86/3816914)\n\n**Will the US attack Iran today? A last-minute statement has come from Trump.**\nU.S. President Donald Trump made a statement during an interview with Fox News regarding escalating tensions with Iran, denying that a military attack would occur today. Trump stated that Iran is currently engaged in negotiations with the U.S., saying, 'Iran is talking to us and negotiating, so we will see what happens.' He referenced past failed negotiations, noting that the last time the U.S. demanded Iran dismantle its nuclear program, it did not succeed. Trump also claimed the U.S. has a 'large fleet' approaching Iran, stating it is 'even larger than what we have in Venezuela,' but did not confirm an imminent attack. He argued that informing regional allies about military preparations would be 'worse than sharing with the media,' suggesting strategic discretion. The context includes widespread protests in Iran, reportedly resulting in thousands of deaths, and claims that demonstrators were executed, which prompted Trump to threaten the Tehran administration and deploy naval forces. Despite U.S. and Israeli media reports predicting an attack today, Trump's statement implies the situation remains in negotiation and uncertain. The article was published on February 1, 2026, according to Haberler.com.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:13 AM\nSource:[Haberler.com](https://en.haberler.com/will-the-us-attack-iran-today-a-last-minute-19524198/?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=tavsiye_et)\n\n**Will the United States Attack Iran? With Trump, Anything Is Possible**\nThe article raises the question of whether the United States will attack Iran, citing the extraordinary concentration of American military forces in the Persian Gulf. It notes that the U.S. press is discussing multiple potential scenarios under consideration by the President, including decapitating the regime, destroying nuclear facilities and missile bases, and targeting the Revolutionary Guard. The article does not confirm any imminent attack, nor does it provide evidence of a decision being made. The topic is presented as a matter of speculation and ongoing discussion within U.S. media and political circles as of February 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2026/02/01/opiniao/opiniao/estados-unidos-vao-atacar-irao-trump-possivel-2163182)\n\n**U.S. Fleet Moves Toward Iran: Military Expert Svitann Predicts Potential Strike**\nThe United States is moving its fleet closer to Iran, according to military expert Roman Svitann, who spoke in an interview with 24 Kanal on January 27, 2026. He noted that the region now hosts up to a thousand aircraft, including 400 in Israel and over 100 aircraft associated with the U.S. aircraft carrier group. Svitann stated that the U.S. and its allies may launch an attack on military targets in Iran, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which he described as the militant wing of Iran's ayatollahs, while the Iranian army remains largely neutral. He emphasized that the U.S. is prepared to initiate strikes but is not yet ready to withstand Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile fire, which includes at least 1,500 remaining ballistic missiles. To counter this, Svitann predicted the deployment of additional THAAD anti-ballistic missile systems\u2014one already in Israel and another likely in the Persian Gulf. He warned that such an attack could lead to a sharp rise in global oil prices, negatively impacting Ukraine. Svitann also claimed that former U.S. President Trump undermined an Iranian uprising by failing to deliver on promises of support after mass protests, resulting in thousands of deaths and arrests. He concluded that a U.S. military strike on Iranian military infrastructure is a real possibility in the near future.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:04 PM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/geopolitics/ru/ssha-perebrasyvajut-avianoscy-storonu-irana-voennyj-jekspert_n2997258)\n\n**Will the U.S. and Iran Go to War in 2026? What Do Prophecies Say?**\nThe article discusses apocalyptic predictions about a potential global conflict, particularly focusing on a major war between the United States and Iran in 2026. It references various prophetic sources, including Baba Vanga, Living Nostradamus, and Nostradamus\u2019s quatrains, which suggest that 2026 could mark the beginning of a 'Third World War' originating in the Middle East or Asia. The article claims that a series of regional conflicts\u2014including Israel-Iran tensions, a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, and retaliatory missile attacks by Iran on U.S. bases in Qatar and Syria\u2014led to a temporary ceasefire brokered by Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Predictions also include the rise of 'invisible warfare' involving cyberattacks and drones, as well as the deployment of a massive naval fleet in the Persian Gulf, symbolized by the USS Abraham Lincoln. Nostradamus\u2019s Quatrain 77 foretells a 27-year war, widespread destruction, and 'red hail'\u2014interpreted by some as nuclear fallout. Astrological interpretations from Hindu, Islamic, and Christian calendars suggest that 2026 will be a year of upheaval, with the Hindu Vikram Samvat 2083 beginning on March 19, 2026, marked by the 'Raudra Samvatsar' (a destructive year) and the 'Angarak Yoga'\u2014indicating internal strife and external conflict. The article also notes that the Islamic Hijri calendar began year 1448 on June 17, 2026, with planetary alignments suggesting religious conflict. Despite these predictions, the article concludes with a disclaimer that such content is for informational and entertainment purposes only and lacks scientific validation, emphasizing that real outcomes depend on diplomacy and global leadership decisions.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 10:28 AM\nSource:[Webdunia](https://hindi.webdunia.com/astrology-articles/us-iran-war-probability-experts-predictions-126012700037_1.html)\n\n**Rocket Strikes on Officials and Generals: Predicted U.S. Attacks on Iran**\nAccording to KP.RU, U.S. betting markets have placed $8 million on the prediction that the United States will launch new strikes against Iran on January 31, 2026, with January 14 as the second most popular date. Analyst Boris Dolgov, a leading research fellow at the Center for Islamic Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, predicts that if President Trump proceeds with military action under the pretext of supporting protesters, the U.S. would conduct targeted strikes against Iranian officials, generals, and prosecutors accused by Western media and Iranian opposition of suppressing protests. The strikes may also target military installations such as Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) barracks and weapon storage sites. Dolgov suggests the U.S. may act in coordination with Israel. In response, Iran could retaliate by attacking U.S. military bases in Syria, Jordan, and Bahrain, or resort to extreme measures such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil export route. Iran is currently pursuing diplomatic engagement. Dolgov attributes the scale of the protests to a combination of factors: a well-fed, educated population (Iran ranks ninth globally in scientific and technological innovation), recent declines in living standards, and the appeal of Western consumer lifestyles promised after sanctions are lifted. He also notes that the U.S. has positioned Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah, as a symbolic opposition figure, though many protesters\u2014being young and unfamiliar with pre-1979 Iran\u2014may not be deterred by this. The article suggests that these conditions create a 'color revolution' environment in Iran.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 12:40 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27749/5196790/)\n\n**Israeli Assessments Predict Trump May Attack Iran to Force Negotiations Amid Protests**\nIsraeli official media reports that senior Israeli intelligence assessments estimate former U.S. President Donald Trump will launch a military attack on Iran to compel it to negotiate, citing deteriorating economic conditions and widespread protests in Iran since December 28, 2025. The Israel Broadcasting Authority stated that 'in Israel, they estimate that Trump will launch an attack on Iran to force it to negotiate.' According to Israeli security sources, at least 4,000 civilians have been killed during the protests. The Israeli security cabinet (the 'kabinit') was briefed on potential Israeli military plans against Iran on the evening of January 13, 2026. Key issues for negotiation include Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which Israel and the U.S. accuse Iran of pursuing for military purposes, while Iran insists its program is for peaceful uses such as electricity generation. Israel, the only unacknowledged nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, has sought U.S. approval to strike Iran, especially after reports that Iran is rebuilding its ballistic missile capabilities damaged in a previous conflict. U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed hopes for the collapse of Iran\u2019s regime since 1979. Trump, via the Truth Social platform, told Iranian protesters: 'Help is on the way' and urged them to 'continue protesting and take control of your institutions.' He announced the cancellation of all meetings with Iranian officials 'until the killing of protesters stops.' Meanwhile, countries including China and Russia have rejected any U.S.-led military intervention in Iran. In June 2025, Israel, with U.S. backing, launched a 12-day war on Iran, which was followed by Iranian retaliation before a U.S.-brokered ceasefire was declared. Israel and Iran remain arch-enemies, exchanging accusations of sabotage and cyberattacks for years.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 07:32 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AB-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6-/3798483)\n\n**U.S. Military Attack on Iran Probability Surges Past 50% on Prediction Market Amid Escalating Tensions**\nOn January 13, 2026, the Polymarket prediction platform reported that the probability of the United States launching a military attack on Iran had risen to 54%, exceeding 50% for the first time, up 9 percentage points in the past 24 hours. The likelihood of a U.S. military strike occurring by January 23 increased from 29% to 43%. Approximately $13.7 million has been wagered on the outcome. If the U.S. conducts a military attack\u2014via drones, missiles, or airstrikes\u2014on Iranian territory, including embassies and consulates, the market will settle on 'YES'; otherwise, if the attack is prevented, it will be a no-count result. Polymarket, which uses the CRYPTO: POL token, has previously faced criticism for profiting from conflicts and wars. Meanwhile, the probability that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will step down this month remains low at 20%. The surge in speculation follows a new travel advisory issued by the U.S. virtual embassy in Iran, warning U.S. citizens to evacuate due to escalating protests that have entered their 16th day. The advisory cites a significant risk of interrogation, arrest, or detention for U.S. passport holders or those perceived to have ties to the U.S. The U.S. virtual embassy serves as a diplomatic platform since the U.S. and Iran do not maintain formal diplomatic relations. According to the U.S.-based nonprofit Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 656 people, including 505 protesters, have died during the unrest. Iran claims foreign interference is behind the uprising, which began due to public anger over currency devaluation and hyperinflation. The Trump administration is reportedly considering various responses, including military action. Tehran has signaled both readiness for war and willingness to negotiate.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/49865102/50)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nEvery three months, participants in the Metaculus Cup use artificial intelligence to predict geopolitical events in hopes of winning a prize of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**AI Is Learning to Predict the Future -- And Beating Humans at It**\nMetaculus runs a quarterly forecasting cup in which participants predict geopolitical events for a prize pot of about $5,000.
