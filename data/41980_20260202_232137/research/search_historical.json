The reliability and independence of sourcing should be considered when evaluating these claims.\n\n## Key Developments:\n\n### Diplomatic Negotiations\n- **Indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. are likely to begin on Sunday in Ankara**, according to WANA sources\n- Talks would be at the level of Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff\n- Messages from the U.S. were conveyed to Iran through **Turkey, Qatar, and Russia** as intermediaries\n- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has reportedly authorized the start of negotiations\n- Negotiations expected to focus on the nuclear issue framework\n- Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt mentioned as potential hosts or mediators\n\n### U.S. Position Assessment (per WANA/Iranian sources)\n- WANA claims the U.S. has entered a \"tactical retreat\" from its public positions after Iran \"did not back down\"\n- The U.S. administration allegedly concluded \"it is unable to produce a credible threat against Iran\" at this stage\n- However, **serious doubts expressed about the authenticity of this U.S. shift**\n\n### Expected Outcome\n- **Most likely scenario cited: negotiations will quickly fail** due to U.S. \"excessive demands,\" leading to intensified confrontation\n- The U.S. is reportedly pursuing combined pressure strategy including \"conditioning Iran's domestic environment, creating political divisions, and intensifying public opinion pressure\"\n\n### Israeli Position\n- Israeli Channel 12 reported Tel Aviv has \"exerted extensive pressure on Washington to prevent the conclusion of an agreement and to push for a military strike against Iran\"\n- Israel reportedly set three conditions for any U.S.-Iran deal:\n  1.

All five test strings returned \u201cNo usable content extracted,\u201d which means we still have:\n\n1. Zero numerical history for Metaculus question 41594 after 1 January 2026  \n2. No confirmation that an API or Wayback snapshot for that question even exists  \n3. No page title or wording for the question, so we cannot prove that the U S\u2013Iran news flow would plausibly move its probability time-series\n\nBecause of this continued data vacuum, the first half of the original user request remains unanswerable: there is literally nothing to tabulate, so we cannot deliver daily community predictions or calculate the five largest one-day swings.\n\nWhat we can do\u2014based on the narrative assembled earlier\u2014is describe the real-world events between 15 Jan 2026 and 2 Feb 2026 that would be most likely to influence a crowd forecast on a U S\u2013Iran conflict or Iranian-protest question.  However, even that summary still lacks sourceable citations from the latest crawl because none of the search hits returned actual articles.  Consequently, the second half of the request can be written only as an unsupported outline, which is not acceptable under the requirement to cite evidence.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\u2022 Metaculus data feed (CSV, JSON, screenshot, or archived HTML) for question 41594  \n\u2022 Any article text, title, or URL for the January\u2013February 2026 Iran conflict/protest events so the chronology can be sourced  \n\u2022 Secondary outlets (Reuters, AFP, AP, BBC, NPR, etc.) to corroborate casualty figures, troop movements, and official statements\n\nConclusion: the project is still blocked by missing primary material on both sub-tasks.  Further targeted searching is required before a satisfactory answer can be drafted.</Agent_report>\n"
