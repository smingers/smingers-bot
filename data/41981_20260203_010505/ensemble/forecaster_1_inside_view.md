Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Real-time market data (Feb 3, 2026):**
- Trading Economics: 3.65% current, forecasts 3.56% end-Q1, 3.35% in 12 months
- CNBC: 3.642% (essentially identical)
- Quality: High for current values; forecasts lack methodology detail
- Date: Current as of Feb 3, 2026

**Recent historical context (Jan-Feb 2026):**
- YCharts (Jan 2, 2026): December 2025 = 3.55%, showing gradual decline from 4.33% in January 2025
- EBC Dollar (Jan 27, 2026): 2-year at 3.56%, 10-year at 4.22%, Fed at 3.50%-3.75%
- CNBC (Feb 2, 2026): Strong ISM manufacturing (52.6 vs 48.4 expected) pushed 10-year to 4.283%, 2-year to 3.576%
- Economic Times (Feb 2, 2026): Named expert Chris Rupkey (FWDBONDS chief economist) noted strong factory confidence
- Quality: High - multiple independent sources with named experts

**Key factual observations:**
1. 3-year yield rose from 3.55% (Dec 2025) to 3.65% (Feb 3, 2026) = +10 bp over ~2 months
2. Recent trajectory: +12 bp in past month (stronger upward momentum)
3. Yield curve positioning: 2-year (3.56%) < 3-year (3.65%) < 10-year (4.22%) - rational structure
4. Fed policy: Holding at 3.50%-3.75%, removed "downside risks to employment" language

**Expert opinions identified:**
- Chris Rupkey (FWDBONDS): Strong economic momentum, receding recession fears
- Kevin Warsh nomination: Market expects hawkish balance sheet policy (not immediate rate impact)
- TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg: Treasury refunding announcement (Feb 4) could pressure yields higher if auction sizes increase

**Upcoming catalysts before Feb 10:**
- Feb 4 (Wed): Treasury refunding announcement at 8:30 AM ET - could affect supply expectations
- Feb 6 (Fri): Employment Situation report - major data release
- No Fed meeting scheduled

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. Current yield at 3.65% with rational curve positioning (2-year floor at 3.56%, 10-year ceiling at 4.22%)
   - Multiple independent sources confirm
   - Structural constraint on movement range
   
2. Recent upward momentum (+12 bp/month, +10 bp since December)
   - Consistent across sources
   - Driven by stronger-than-expected economic data (ISM manufacturing 52.6)
   - Suggests near-term bias toward higher yields

3. Treasury refunding announcement Feb 4 as immediate catalyst
   - Named expert (Goldberg) specifically identifies this as yield-moving event
   - If auction sizes increase → upward pressure on yields
   - If unchanged → potential yield decline

**Moderate evidence:**
1. Employment report Feb 6 could cause 5-15 bp movement
   - Standard pattern for major data releases
   - Direction uncertain but volatility expected

2. Fed on hold with gradual easing bias
   - Removed recession language but maintaining rates
   - Market expects cuts later in 2026
   - Creates modest downward pressure over longer timeframe

**Weak evidence:**
1. Trading Economics forecast of 3.56% by end-Q1
   - Methodology unclear
   - Represents 9 bp decline from current level
   - More relevant for March than Feb 10

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window: 7 days (Feb 3 → Feb 10, 2026)**

This is an extremely short timeframe with two major events:
- Feb 4: Treasury refunding (immediate impact potential)
- Feb 6: Employment data (2-day lag to resolution)

**If timeframe halved (3-4 days):**
- Would only capture Treasury refunding impact
- Tighter distribution around 3.65%, likely 3.58-3.72 range
- Less time for mean reversion

**If timeframe doubled (14 days):**
- Would capture both data releases plus market digestion
- Wider distribution, likely 3.45-3.85 range
- More time for Trading Economics forecast (3.56%) to materialize
- Greater probability of external shocks

**7-day historical volatility:**
- Typical range: 10-20 bp in normal conditions
- With major data: 15-25 bp possible
- Current environment: Two catalysts suggest upper end of range

## (d) Justification for Adjustments from Outside View

**Outside view baseline:** 3.48-3.82 (P10-P90), centered slightly below 3.65%

**Adjustments based on inside view:**

**Upward pressure factors (shift distribution higher):**
1. Recent momentum: +12 bp/month suggests continued upward drift
   - Moderate evidence: Adjust median up ~3 bp to 3.66%
   
2. Treasury refunding risk (Feb 4): If auction sizes increase
   - Strong evidence for volatility: Widen upper tail by 5 bp
   - Expert (Goldberg) specifically flagged this
   
3. Strong economic data trend (ISM 52.6): Reduces recession fears
   - Moderate evidence: Supports higher floor, lift P10 by 2 bp

**Downward pressure factors (shift distribution lower):**
1. Trading Economics forecast (3.56% end-Q1): Suggests eventual decline
   - Weak evidence for 7-day window: Minimal impact
   
2. Fed easing bias over 2026: Market expects cuts
   - Weak evidence for 7-day window: Minimal impact

**Net adjustment:**
- Shift median up 3 bp to 3.66% (from 3.65% baseline)
- Maintain asymmetry but slightly reduce given recent momentum
- Widen upper tail to account for refunding/employment surprises
- Key range: 3.52-3.82 (P10-P90) = 30 bp width

**Critical consideration:** The 7-day window is too short for structural factors (Fed policy, long-term forecasts) to dominate. Instead, near-term catalysts (refunding, employment) and momentum effects are primary drivers.

## Probability Calibration

**Central tendency:** Current 3.65% with slight upward bias to 3.66% median
- Recent momentum (+12 bp/month) supports this
- Two near-term catalysts create volatility but directional uncertainty

**Distribution shape:**
- Slightly right-skewed: Upside risks from strong data/refunding exceed downside risks
- P40-P60 spread: 8 bp (3.63-3.71) captures most likely outcomes around current level
- P10-P90 spread: 30 bp (3.52-3.82) accounts for data surprises

**Tail considerations:**
- P1 (3.38%): Extreme risk-off event + dovish surprise + weak employment
- P99 (3.95%): Multiple hawkish surprises + major refunding increase + very strong employment
- These require multiple coincident shocks, hence low probability

**Volatility calibration:**
- 7-day standard deviation: ~10-12 bp implied
- Consistent with historical patterns plus two data releases
- Wider than typical week due to catalysts

**Key assumptions:**
1. No major geopolitical shocks
2. Treasury refunding has 50/50 chance of increasing yields vs neutral/decreasing
3. Employment data has symmetric uncertainty
4. Yield curve structure remains intact (3-year between 2-year and 10-year)

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** DGS3 value on Feb 10, 2026 (7 days forward), units = percent
   - Analysis correctly focused on 3-year Treasury yield over 7-day window

2. **Outside view anchor:** Started at 3.48-3.82 (P10-P90) centered at 3.65%
   - Final prediction shifted up marginally to 3.66% median based on momentum evidence
   - Maintained connection to base rate with justified adjustments

3. **Consistency check:** 
   - Implied median = 3.66%; mean ≈ 3.67% (slightly right-skewed)
   - Makes sense given recent upward momentum and near-term catalyst risks

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Current yield 3.65% with rational curve positioning (strong)
   - Recent +12 bp/month momentum from strong economic data (moderate)
   - Treasury refunding Feb 4 as immediate catalyst (strong)
   - Employment report Feb 6 adds volatility (moderate)
   - 7-day window limits structural factor impact (strong)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** 
   - Treasury announces major auction size increases Feb 4 AND employment data significantly beats expectations Feb 6
   - Would push yield toward P90-P99 range (3.82-3.95%)
   - Probability: ~5-10% for this combination
