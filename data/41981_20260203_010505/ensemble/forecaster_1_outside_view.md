- Quality: Procedural guidance only, no predictive value

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **7-day forward movement of 3-year Treasury yields (Feb 3 → Feb 10)**
   - Most specific and relevant
   - Historical volatility: Treasury yields typically move 0-20 basis points over 7 days under normal conditions
   - Current context: Relatively stable market conditions, no major Fed meetings scheduled

2. **3-year Treasury yields during Fed pause periods**
   - Fed is holding rates at 3.50%-3.75% with market expecting gradual cuts
   - This creates a ceiling effect on short-to-medium term yields

3. **Yield curve positioning (3-year relative to 2-year and 10-year)**
   - Current 2-year: ~3.56%
   - Current 10-year: ~4.22%
   - 3-year at 3.65% is appropriately positioned between them

**Selected reference class:** 7-day forward movement with yield curve constraints, as this combines the specific timeframe with structural market relationships.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 7 days (Feb 3 → Feb 10, 2026)

**Historical patterns over 7-day periods:**
- Treasury yields exhibit mean-reverting behavior over short periods
- 7-day standard deviation for 3-year yields typically ranges 5-15 basis points
- Major moves (>25 basis points) are rare absent significant news
- Current environment: No Fed meeting scheduled, CPI data not until Feb 11

**Key upcoming events before Feb 10:**
- Employment Situation report (Feb 6) - could cause 5-10 bp movement
- No other major catalysts identified

**Current market positioning:**
- 3-year yield at 3.65% is slightly above the 2-year (3.56%)
- Market expects gradual Fed cuts in 2026
- Yield curve is normalizing after inversion

## (d) Justification

The most reliable anchor is the current value of 3.65% as of Feb 3, 2026. Over a 7-day horizon without major scheduled Fed events, yields typically exhibit limited movement.

**Supporting factors for stability around 3.65%:**
1. Fed on hold at current meeting (Jan 2026), next decision likely weeks away
2. Market expectations already priced in (gradual cuts expected)
3. Yield curve positioning is rational (between 2-year and 10-year)
4. No major catalyst identified between Feb 3-10 except employment data

**Potential upside risks (higher yields):**
- Strong employment report on Feb 6 could push yields up 5-15 bp
- Unexpected hawkish Fed commentary
- Global risk-off events increasing Treasury supply concerns

**Potential downside risks (lower yields):**
- Weak employment data supporting faster Fed cuts
- Flight to safety from geopolitical events
- Technical trading patterns

**Historical context:**
- Recent trend: +12 bp over past month, suggesting modest upward pressure
- Year-over-year: -61 bp, indicating longer-term downward trend
- Trading Economics forecast: 3.56% by end of Q1, suggesting modest decline expected

The 7-day window is too short for major structural shifts, but employment data on Feb 6 introduces meaningful uncertainty.

## Outside view calibration

**Base case:** The yield should remain close to 3.65%, with most probability mass between 3.50% and 3.80%.

**Distribution considerations:**

1. **Central tendency:** Current value of 3.65% serves as the natural center, with slight downward bias given Trading Economics forecast of 3.56% by end-Q1.

2. **Volatility:** 7-day movements typically span 10-20 basis points in normal conditions. Employment data could extend this to 25 basis points.

3. **Boundary conditions:**
   - Lower bound consideration: 2-year yield at 3.56% provides soft floor
   - Upper bound consideration: Should remain well below 10-year at 4.22%
   - Hard constraints: 2.941% (given lower bound) to 4.9565% (given upper bound) seem extreme for 7 days

4. **Asymmetry:** Slight downward bias given:
   - Trading Economics forecast trending lower
   - Market pricing in future Fed cuts
   - Recent strength (+12 bp/month) may be exhausted

5. **Tail risks:** 
   - 10th percentile: Significant risk-on or dovish surprise → ~3.48%
   - 90th percentile: Strong employment + hawkish shift → ~3.82%

**Calibration check:**
- 80% confidence interval (P10-P90): ~34 basis points width
- This accounts for employment data uncertainty plus general market volatility
- Wider than typical 7-day range to account for unknown unknowns
