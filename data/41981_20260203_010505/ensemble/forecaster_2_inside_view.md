Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-quality factual sources:**
1. **YCharts (Jan 2, 2026)**: Reports December 2025 3-year yield at 3.55%, down from 4.33% in January 2025. Shows clear downward trend through 2025. Monthly data from Federal Reserve H.15. High quality, authoritative.

2. **CNBC (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports 2-year at 3.576%, 10-year at 4.283%, 30-year at 4.914% as of Feb 2. No 3-year quoted but provides curve context. Named expert (Chris Rupkey) notes strong manufacturing data. High quality factual reporting.

3. **Economic Times (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports 2-year at 3.567%, 10-year at 4.275%, 30-year at 4.903%. ISM manufacturing at 52.6 (vs expected 48.4). Discusses Kevin Warsh nomination and "bear steepening." Factual data reliable; opinion pieces on Warsh are speculative.

4. **MarketWatch/FinancialContent (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports 10-year climbed to 4.276%, 30-year to 4.907% on Feb 2. Largest one-day move of year. Strong manufacturing data cited as catalyst. Quality factual reporting.

5. **Morningstar (Feb 2, 2026)**: Discusses Treasury refunding announcement scheduled for Feb 4, 8:30 AM ET. TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg (named expert) suggests yields could decline if guidance unchanged, rise if altered. Expected borrowing $574B for Jan-Mar 2026. Moderate quality - expert opinion but forward-looking speculation.

**Recent market context from AskNews:**
- Multiple sources confirm yields rose sharply on Feb 2 following ISM manufacturing surprise (52.6 vs 48.4 expected)
- 10-year yield around 4.27-4.28% as of Feb 2
- 2-year yield around 3.56-3.58% as of Feb 2
- Treasury refunding announcement Feb 4 is next major event
- Payrolls report Feb 6 (delayed from shutdown)

**Interpolating 3-year yield:**
Given 2-year at ~3.57% and 10-year at ~4.28% on Feb 2, the 3-year yield likely sits around 3.63-3.65% (consistent with December's 3.55% plus the recent rise). The curve appears to be steepening with intermediate maturities rising.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- ISM manufacturing surge to 52.6 (Feb 2) - first expansion in 26 months - caused immediate yield spike across curve. This is a major data surprise with clear causal mechanism pushing yields higher. Multiple independent sources confirm.
- Federal Reserve removed "downside risks to employment" language, pushing out rate cut expectations. Structural shift in policy stance.
- Current 3-year yield estimated at 3.63-3.65% based on curve interpolation from reliable Feb 2 data.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Treasury refunding announcement Feb 4 could move markets if auction sizes increase beyond expectations. TD Securities expert suggests this could push yields higher, but outcome uncertain.
- Payrolls report Feb 6 - historically moves yields 5-15bp. Direction depends on surprise, which is unpredictable.
- Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair signals potential hawkish shift, but confirmation/impact timeline extends beyond Feb 10.
- Recent trend: 3-year yield declined from 4.33% (Jan 2025) to 3.55% (Dec 2025), but reversed sharply in late Jan/early Feb 2026.

**Weak evidence:**
- General "bear steepening" narrative - descriptive rather than predictive
- Speculation about Fed balance sheet policy under Warsh - too far in future to affect Feb 10 fixing

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 5 trading days (Feb 3-10, 2026)

**Key events in window:**
- Feb 4 (Tuesday): Treasury refunding announcement at 8:30 AM ET
- Feb 6 (Thursday): Non-Farm Payrolls report (delayed from Jan)
- Feb 10 (Monday): Resolution date

**If timeframe halved (2-3 days):** Would reduce uncertainty significantly. Only the Feb 4 refunding announcement would be in play. Distribution would narrow to σ ≈ 5-6bp rather than 9bp.

**If timeframe doubled (10 days):** Would include Feb 11 CPI report, adding substantial uncertainty. Distribution would widen to σ ≈ 13-15bp. More macro data points would accumulate, increasing potential for larger moves.

## (d) Justification for Prediction Shift

**Starting point (Outside view):**
- Historical 1-week σ = 9bp centered on current level
- Current level estimated at 3.64% (midpoint of 3.63-3.65% range)

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Recent momentum is upward** (Strong): The Feb 2 ISM surprise pushed the entire curve higher. The 10-year moved up ~4bp in one day. This suggests near-term momentum favors slightly higher yields. However, much of the immediate reaction has already occurred. *Adjustment: Shift median up 1-2bp to 3.65-3.66%*

2. **Two major data releases ahead** (Moderate): Treasury refunding (Feb 4) and Payrolls (Feb 6) are both high-impact events. Historical precedent shows payrolls can move 3-year yields 5-15bp. Refunding could add 3-8bp if auction sizes increase. These are independent events that could compound. *Adjustment: Widen distribution slightly, increase upside tail risk*

3. **Fed policy stance shifted hawkish** (Moderate): Removal of employment concerns language and strong data reduce near-term cut probability. This structurally supports higher yields, but most repricing likely already occurred. *Adjustment: Minor upward bias already captured in #1*

4. **Curve dynamics** (Moderate): Bear steepening means intermediate maturities (like 3-year) may rise more than short end but less than long end. 2-year relatively anchored near 3.57%, 10-year at 4.28%. 3-year has room to move toward 3.70-3.75% if steepening continues. *Adjustment: Increase 80th-90th percentiles*

**Distribution construction:**
- Median: 3.66% (up 1-2bp from current 3.64% on momentum)
- σ ≈ 10bp (slightly wider than historical 9bp due to event risk)
- 10th/90th percentiles at ±1.28σ = ±13bp, widened to ±15bp for fat tails
- Range: 3.51% (10th) to 3.81% (90th)
- Further widen tails for 1st/99th percentiles to capture extreme scenarios

**Sanity checks:**
- Lower bound 2.941%: Would require ~70bp drop - unprecedented absent major crisis. Assign <0.1% probability.
- Upper bound 4.9565%: Would require ~130bp rise - impossible in 5 days absent systemic shock. Assign <0.01% probability.
- My 1st percentile (3.40%) and 99th percentile (3.92%) stay well within bounds.

Probability calibration:

**Base case (50-60% probability):** 3.60-3.72%
- Current level around 3.64% holds or drifts slightly higher
- Refunding announcement is neutral to mildly hawkish
- Payrolls come in near consensus (no major surprise)
- Yields end week 3.63-3.70%

**Upside scenario (20-25% probability):** 3.72-3.85%
- Strong payrolls (+250k+) or hawkish refunding guidance
- Continued bear steepening pushes 3-year toward 3.75-3.80%
- Additional inflation concerns emerge

**Downside scenario (15-20% probability):** 3.48-3.60%
- Weak payrolls or dovish refunding surprise
- Flight to quality from equity volatility
- Yields retrace some of Feb 2 gains

**Tail scenarios (<5% each):**
- Extreme upside (3.85-3.95%): Major hawkish shock, compound surprises
- Extreme downside (3.35-3.48%): Crisis event, major dovish pivot

**Key uncertainties:**
1. Magnitude of payrolls surprise (±100k range plausible)
2. Treasury refunding guidance changes
3. Market positioning and technical factors
4. Spillover from equity or credit markets

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** DGS3 (3-year constant maturity Treasury yield) on Feb 10, 2026, in percent
   ✓ Analysis focuses exactly on this daily fixing

2. **Outside view base rate:** 3.64% ± 9bp (1-week historical volatility)
   ✓ Final prediction centered near 3.66%, rooted in base rate with modest upward shift for recent momentum

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.66%; mean ≈ 3.66%; aligns with current level + slight upward momentum from strong data

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Current 3-year yield ~3.64% (interpolated from Feb 2 curve data)
   - ISM manufacturing 52.6 caused immediate yield spike Feb 2
   - Treasury refunding Feb 4 and Payrolls Feb 6 are high-impact events
   - Historical 1-week σ = 9bp, widened to 10bp for event risk
   - Recent upward momentum but most ISM reaction already priced

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpectedly weak payrolls (e.g., negative print or <50k) combined with dovish refunding could push yield down 15-20bp to 3.45-3.50%, making my lower percentiles look too conservative. Conversely, compound hawkish surprises could push to 3.85%+.
