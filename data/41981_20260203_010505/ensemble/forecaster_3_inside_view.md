Analysis:

### 1) Target variable / resolution
Forecast the **FRED series DGS3 (3-year constant-maturity Treasury yield, investment basis), daily value for 2026-02-10**, in **percent**.

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)

- **FRED DGS3 series page (High quality; timeless metadata)**
  - *Facts:* This is the correct daily series; values can be revised.
  - *No opinions / no forecast content.*

- **YCharts “3-Year Treasury Rate (Monthly)” (Medium-high; last updated 2026-01-02; monthly, not daily)**
  - *Facts:* December 2025 monthly average ~3.55 with a downtrend from early 2025.
  - *Limits:* Monthly averages smooth daily moves; only weakly pins the daily Feb 10 level.

- **CNBC / Market coverage on Feb 2, 2026 (High for same-day market facts; low for forward forecasting)**
  - *Facts:* Feb 2 saw higher yields (e.g., 2-year ~3.576, 10-year ~4.283) tied to strong ISM and Fed-leadership uncertainty.
  - *Opinions:* “Timeline for cuts pushed out” is an interpretation; still plausible but uncertain.

- **Economic Times / MarketMinute narratives (Medium; some risk of over-narration)**
  - *Facts:* Cites strong ISM (52.6 vs 48.4 exp) and notes 3-year around ~3.63 on 2026-01-29.
  - *Opinions:* “Structural inflation regime” framing is speculative; directional but not a tight quantitative anchor.

- **Morningstar/MarketWatch on Treasury refunding preview (Medium-high; dated 2026-02-02; event-driven)**
  - *Facts:* Treasury refunding guidance Feb 4 may change auction sizes; higher supply would pressure yields upward.
  - *Opinion (identifiable expert):* TD Securities’ G. Goldberg: unchanged guidance could let yields fall; changed guidance could push yields up immediately.

- **Investing.com fixed-income sentiment piece (Low-medium; broad, technical/sentiment heavy)**
  - *Facts:* Reports investor sentiment and consensus ranges; not directly predictive for a single day 7 days ahead.
  - *Opinions:* Contrarian “bonds worth monitoring” is not a precise yield forecast.

- **Older/longer-horizon forecast snippets (e.g., Reuters poll mentioned in context; Medium quality for horizons of months)**
  - *Facts/opinions:* Useful as macro backdrop (slow drift expectations), but weak for a 7-day point forecast.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (moves my distribution meaningfully)**
1. **Current level anchoring:** DGS3 is ~3.64-3.65 around Feb 3 (from provided context/outside-view writeup and corroborating market reporting). Over 7 days, “today’s yield + typical weekly volatility” is the dominant predictor.
2. **Near-term event risk with clear mechanism:** **Feb 4 Treasury refunding guidance** (supply expectations) can move intermediate yields quickly; mechanism is direct (expected net duration supply → term premia).
3. **Recent macro surprise direction:** Strong ISM and “cuts later” repricing already pushed yields up; momentum/positioning can persist a few sessions.

**Moderate evidence (nudges the center / skew)**
1. **Feb 6 employment report risk:** A single data print can swing front/intermediate yields, but sign is two-sided.
2. **Curve context:** 2-year ~3.57 and 10-year ~4.28 implies 3-year plausibly in the mid/high-3.6s; that supports a median near current.

**Weak evidence (small adjustments only)**
1. Monthly YCharts trend down in 2025 (helpful background; weak for a specific day).
2. Broad “structural inflation / bear steepening” commentary (directional narratives; uncertain magnitude).

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast horizon:** From 2026-02-03 to 2026-02-10 is **7 days** (about **5 trading sessions**).
- **If horizon were halved (~3–4 days):** I would tighten the distribution modestly (less chance for a big macro/supply repricing).
- **If horizon were doubled (~14 days):** I would widen tails materially (more data releases, more opportunity for a trend to develop, higher chance of a risk-off/risk-on shock).

### (d) Justification (outside → inside)

**Outside-view base distribution (given in prompt):**
- Centered around current ~3.64 with typical 1-week moves of ~±5–15 bp (fatter tails for event weeks).

**Inside-view adjustments from current conditions (small, not a regime shift):**
- The week contains **two catalysts** that can raise realized volatility: **Treasury refunding (Feb 4)** and **jobs report (Feb 6)**.
- Recent newsflow is **net hawkish/growth-positive** (strong ISM; Warsh-related uncertainty perceived as hawkish by markets). That tilts risks **slightly upward** versus a purely “mean-reverting drift lower” story.
- However, **CPI is after Feb 10**, limiting the biggest scheduled inflation catalyst before resolution; that argues against extreme moves.

Net: I shift the distribution **slightly higher and slightly wider** than the provided outside-view percentiles, keeping the median close to current levels.

Probability calibration:

- **Status quo / persistence:** Starting point ~3.64-3.65.
- **My implied median (50th):** ~3.65 (between my 40th and 60th).
- **Skew:** Slightly **upward-skewed** tails (supply surprise or strong jobs) but still meaningful downside tail (unchanged refunding + weaker jobs + risk-off bid).

Checklist:
1. Target: DGS3 daily yield on 2026-02-10, percent.
2. Outside view base: Provided distribution centered ~3.62–3.66 with 1-week volatility.
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈3.65; mean ≈3.67 (mild upward skew). Plausible given catalysts.
4. Key evidence:
   - Current DGS3 level ~3.64-3.65 (anchor).
   - Feb 4 refunding guidance could shift yields via supply expectations.
   - Feb 6 employment report could swing rate-cut expectations.
   - Recent strong ISM / hawkish-leaning narrative pushed yields up.
5. Blind spot: A sudden risk-off shock (geopolitics/financial accident) would likely push yields **down** sharply.
