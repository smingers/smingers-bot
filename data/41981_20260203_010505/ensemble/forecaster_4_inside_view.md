Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight-bearing first)

1. Real-time quote feeds (CNBC bond page, Trading Economics, Bloomberg terminal snapshot – 2026-02-03 14:30 ET)  
   • Fact: on-the-run 3-year note trading 3.64–3.66.  
   • Quality: high for spot; same trading day as forecast launch; no opinions.

2. H.15 / FRED DGS3 history (latest published observation 2026-01-30 = 3.63)  
   • Fact: confirms resolution series & that FRED prints the previous business-day H.15 close.  
   • Quality: authoritative; no forward view.

3. CNBC, MarketWatch, Economic Times, Morningstar market reports (all 2026-02-02)  
   • Facts: ISM mfg 52.6 vs 48.4; Kevin Warsh Fed-chair nomination; 10y = 4.28, 2y = 3.57, 3y cash around 3.63.  
   • Opinions: hawkish leadership could keep yields high; identifiable economists quoted (Chris Rupkey, Gennadiy Goldberg).  
   • Quality: good day-of-market colour, moderate analytical value.

4. Calendar info (BLS Employment Situation due Fri 2026-02-06; Treasury quarterly refunding announcement 2026-02-04).  
   • Fact: both events precede the 2026-02-10 fixing and typically move belly yields 5–20 bp.  
   • Quality: schedule is certain, direction unknown.

5. Trading Economics model forecast (pulled 2026-02-03): end-Q1 2026 3-year yield 3.56, 12-m 3.35.  
   • Opinion/model; transparent methodology absent; treated as weak-to-moderate evidence of gentle downward drift.

6. Longer-horizon pieces (Reuters Nov-2025 poll, CapitalSpectator Jan-2026 “fair-value” model)  
   • Provide structural context that belly yields currently sit near neutral valuation; limited impact over one week.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• Present market level 3.65 (multiple independent live feeds).  
• Historical weekly volatility: ­1σ ≈ 7 bp, 2σ ≈ 15 bp; NFP weeks occasionally 20-30 bp moves (Board of Govs daily data 2015-2025).

Moderate evidence  
• Upcoming NFP & refunding supply often shift 3-year yields in same direction as 2-year (correlation ≈0.9) – inside-week risk enhancer.  
• Hawkish Fed-leadership narrative + strong ISM bias yields slightly upward near term.

Weak evidence  
• Trading Economics quarterly drift projection (-9 bp/month).  
• Commentaries on foreign ownership share (structural, not 1-week).

Net balance: centre stays near spot with a +-25 bp 90 % band.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 5 trading days.  Halving the horizon (to 2-3 days) would tighten the 80 % band to roughly ±10 bp; doubling (to 2 weeks) would widen it to ±30-35 bp and pull the median a few bp lower as CPI (Feb 11) enters the window.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base: “no-change” from 3.65 with historical 1-week σ ≈ 7 bp.  
Adjustments:  
+4 bp for risk of stronger-than-expected NFP and refunding-supply (hawkish skew).  
-2 bp for slow-drift lower path implied by swaps / TE model.  
Net shift ≈ +2 bp, but symmetric uncertainty dominates.  Final median 3.66; mean ≈3.67 given slight right-skew (up-moves often larger).

Probability calibration

• Distribution constructed as normal-ish with σ ≈ 11 bp, then modest right-tail stretch to capture event-risk.  
• 90 % interval 3.25–3.90, 98 % interval 3.10–4.15, allowing extreme surprises.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: DGS3 percent value on 2026-02-10.  
2. Base rate: today’s 3.65, σ ≈ 7 bp/week.  
3. Consistency: median 3.66; mean 3.67; aligns with rationale of slight hawkish skew.  
4. Key evidence: (i) live quote 3.65, (ii) NFP/refunding before fix, (iii) historical NFP week vol 15-20 bp, (iv) upward surprise ISM + Warsh nomination, (v) mild quarterly drift lower.  
5. Blind-spot: massive payroll miss or geopolitical shock causing >30 bp rally – would push yield below 3.25.
