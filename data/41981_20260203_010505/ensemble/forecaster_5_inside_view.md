Analysis
1. Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

• CNBC (2 Feb 2026) – Factual intraday quotes: 3-yr 3.642 %, 2-yr 3.576 %, 10-yr 4.283 %.  Large, well‐sourced news desk; high reliability for spot data, light opinion content.  
• MarketMinute / Morningstar story (2 Feb 2026) – Quotes 3-yr 3.63 % after ISM surprise; adds commentary on “bear-steepening”.  Data points are reliable, opinions come from unnamed desk strategists → moderate weight.  
• Economic Times (2 Feb 2026) – Same yields as above, plus macro context and Kevin Warsh nomination.  Data solid, forward-looking spin is journalistic → moderate weight.  
• Morningstar / MarketWatch (2 Feb 2026) – Preview of 4 Feb refunding announcement.  No 3-yr quote, but explains supply risk; author cites TD Securities.  Opinion from named sell-side strategist → moderate.  
• Y-Charts (month-end) – December-2025 monthly average 3.55 %.  Authoritative but lower-frequency, useful for trend.  
• FRED metadata – Definitions only.  
(Several other AskNews hits cover India, Spain, China, etc.; they have no direct bearing on U.S. 3-year yields and are ignored.)

2. Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Spot level today is 3.64–3.65 % (multiple independent real-time feeds).  
• Five-day realised volatility for DGS3 2021-25 ≈ 11 bp (FRED history) – stable across regimes.

Moderate evidence  
• ISM beat and Warsh nomination pushed all yields ~7 bp higher on 2 Feb – suggests mildly hawkish drift.  
• 4 Feb Treasury refunding announcement could move yields a few bp; TD Securities sees asymmetric upside if auction sizes are lifted.  
• TradingEconomics model (3 Feb) projects 3.56 % end-Q1-26 – indicates slight downward fundamental bias.

Weak evidence  
• Longer-horizon forecasts (CBO, Reuters poll) and foreign-bond stories – little relevance over one trading week.

Weighting: current spot and historical volatility dominate; macro/supply factors add ±3-5 bp skew at most.

3. Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon = 5 trading days (3 Feb → 10 Feb 2026).  Halving the horizon would cut expected σ ≈ √(2/5) → 7 bp and shrink tails; doubling to 10 days would raise σ to ≈ 16 bp and widen every percentile by ~50 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside view centre = 3.64 % (today’s close).  
Inside view tweaks:  
• Mild hawkish sentiment from ISM/Warsh +3 bp drift.  
• Possible supply disappointment (no auction size hike) –2 bp drift.  
Net drift ~0 bp → place median at 3.66 % (rounding to two decimals).  
Keep Normal-ish shape with σ = 11 bp but fatten tails slightly (+10 %) to reflect refunding risk.

Probability calibration
Implied distribution (μ ≈ 3.66, σ ≈ 0.11) with modestly fatter tails.  80 % interval 3.52–3.80 %.  Mean ≈ 3.66 %, median 3.66 % – consistent with rationale.

Checklist
1. Target: DGS3 daily yield (%), observation date 10 Feb 2026.  
2. Base rate: current spot 3.64 %, weekly σ ≈ 0.11 %.  
3. Consistency: median 3.66 %, mean 3.66 %; aligns with small expected drift.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Spot yield 3.64 % (hard data).  
   • Weekly volatility 11 bp (FRED history).  
   • ISM surprise & Warsh nomination raise yields (moderate).  
   • Refunding announcement risk (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected macro shock (e.g., surprise cease-fire or credit scare) moving yields >25 bp; would likely push outcome below my 10th or above 90th percentile.
