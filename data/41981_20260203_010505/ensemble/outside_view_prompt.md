# Summary of Article: "How Changing Interest Rates Affect Bonds | U.S. Bank"

**Date:** July 07, 2021 (Note: The article content appears to reference events from 2024-2025, suggesting the content may be more recent than the stated publication date)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Current Treasury Yields:**
   - 10-year U.S. Treasuries holding near a 4.00%-4.25% range
   - Since August, 10-year Treasury yields have generally stayed in a 4.00% to 4.25% range

2. **Federal Reserve Actions:**
   - Fed rate cuts occurred in 2024 and 2025
   - The Fed reduced interest rates at their last three meetings of 2025
   - As of January meeting, the FOMC kept the federal funds target rate at 3.50% to 3.75%

3. **Yield Curve:**
   - The 10-year Treasury yields 0.70% more than the 2-year Treasury
   - Average spread since 1977 is nearly 0.80%
   - The curve was inverted from mid-2022 to later in 2024

4. **Fiscal Policy:**
   - The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could increase federal debt by $3.4 trillion by 2034 (Congressional Budget Office estimate)

## Expert Opinions (Named Source):

**Bill Merz, head of capital markets research with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group:**

- "Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts pulled short-term bond yields lower. However, longer-term bond yields remained rangebound in recent months due to lower inflation expectations offsetting stronger economic growth expectations."

- "Economists predicted modestly higher inflation this year, and recent data confirmed those forecasts. Consensus now points to a gradual slowdown in inflation. Tariff price pressures appeared in business surveys and accelerating core goods prices, but these effects haven't been extreme."

- "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent does not plan to increase auction sizes for longer maturities. Rather, the Treasury indicates it will issue more short-term bills, where heavy issuance is unlikely to disrupt broad bond market pricing in the near term."

- "Recently, rate cuts pulled Treasury yields lower. Over the long run, bond buyers want to see federal cash flow support bond principal and interest payments, which would suggest lower spending or higher taxes."

- "Economic conditions can support continued earnings growth, creating favorable equity and real asset return opportunities."

## Additional Context:

- **Fed Projections:** Median Fed member projections anticipate one 2026 cut, while investors expect two additional cuts (this gap can create near-term bond market volatility)
- **Inflation:** Remains above the Fed's target
- **Treasury Issuance Strategy:** More short-term bills rather than increasing longer maturity auction sizes

### Key Analysis Points from Article:

**Reasons for Dollar Weakness:**
1. Market expectations of future Fed rate cuts despite current hold
2. Forward rate expectations suggesting lower yields ahead
3. Strong yen and euro movements (which mechanically lower DXY)
4. Policy uncertainty and investor concerns about White House messaging
5. President Trump commented he was not concerned about the dollar decline, causing investor unease

**Market Assessment:**
- The article characterizes this as a "repricing" rather than a crisis
- No signs of typical crisis indicators (disorderly FX drop, sharp inflation spike, or funding stress)
- The move reflects expectations of easier policy ahead and elevated policy risk premium

**Upcoming Data Releases:**
- January 2026 CPI scheduled for February 11, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. ET
- Employment Situation for January 2026 to be released on February 6, 2026 (including benchmark revisions)

**Potential Reversal Factors:**
- Firmer Fed tone pushing back on near-term cuts
- Stronger US economic data that lifts yields
- Calmer policy backdrop reducing risk premium

Query: Pull FRED DGS3 daily values Jan 2025-Feb 2026 and compute mean, stdev, last price
The user’s deliverable is three summary statistics (arithmetic mean, standard-deviation, last value) for the daily “Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 3-Year Constant Maturity” (FRED series code DGS3) over the interval 1 Jan 2025 – 29 Feb 2026 inclusive.

What the current search corpus tells us

1.  Series identity and metadata  
    •  The DGS3 page on FRED confirms that the series is expressed in percent, is not seasonally adjusted and is published at daily frequency (business days only) [FRED Graph page containing DGS3, source “fred.stlouisfed”].  
    •  Business-day gaps (week-ends and Federal holidays) are simply absent from the download files.  
    •  The page offers a “Download”-button that can export the data as CSV or Excel for any custom date span [same FRED page].

2.  Programmatic access is documented  
    •  The official FRED API endpoint /fred/series/observations supports the parameters series_id, observation_start, observation_end, frequency and file_type [FRED API documentation, source “fred.stlouisfed” in the search results].  
    •  A registered (free) API key is required, supplied as api_key=YOUR_KEY.  
    •  Example call (returns JSON):  
      https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DGS3&observation_start=2025-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&frequency=d&file_type=json&api_key=YOUR_KEY.

3.  No result set in the search dump includes the day-by-day numerical observations for 2025-01-01 → 2026-02-29, nor any pre-calculated mean, standard deviation or “last value”.  
    •  Some snippets show other tenor codes (DGS30, DGS5, etc.) or graph embeds, but none expose the required numeric table.  
    •  Therefore the raw data necessary for computation are still absent.

4.  Statistical specification details that remain ambiguous  
    •  Population vs. sample standard deviation: FRED itself does not prescribe either; the user needs to clarify whether the divisor should be N or (N-1).  
    •  Definition of “last price”: typical interpretation is the most recent available observation in the requested date window (normally the entry dated 2026-02-28 because 29 Feb 2026 is a Sunday, thus no trading day). Confirmation desired.

What is still missing

•  The actual observation list (roughly 280 business-day rows) between 1 Jan 2025 and 29 Feb 2026.  
•  Execution of a simple aggregation routine (in Excel, Python/pandas, R/fredr, etc.) to compute:  
  – arithmetic mean = Σxi / N  
  – standard deviation = √[Σ(xi – x̄)² / (N – δ)] with δ = 0 (population) or 1 (sample)  
  – last value = xN (the final date’s yield).

Next actionable step

The quickest, reproducible method is the FRED API:

curl "https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DGS3&observation_start=2025-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&frequency=d&file_type=csv&api_key=YOUR_KEY" > dgs3.csv  

Import dgs3.csv into your analytics tool and run the three computations.

If the user prefers a GUI, navigate to the DGS3 series page, click Download → “Customize data”, set Start = 2025-01-01, End = 2026-02-29, Frequency = Daily, and download the resulting CSV. The downloaded file already omits blank days, so no additional filtering is needed.

Clarifications to request of the user

1. Should the standard deviation be population (N) or sample (N-1)?  
2. Is “last price” strictly the last business day in range (e.g., 2026-02-28) or should the script try to interpolate a missing 2026-02-29?  
3. Deliverable format: just three numbers, or a small table that shows mean, stdev and last value with the date stamp?

Conclusion

All methodological information is in place, but the numeric data for 2025-01-01 → 2026-02-29 must still be downloaded from FRED. Once those observations are obtained, the requested statistics can be produced in a single pass. At present the key information gap is the raw daily yield values themselves.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
