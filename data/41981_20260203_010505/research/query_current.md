Analysis:
The yield on a 3-year Treasury note is driven day-to-day by expectations for the future path of the federal-funds rate, the supply of new notes, near-term macro data (CPI, jobs, GDP), and global risk sentiment.  On 30 Jan 2026 the FOMC left its target range unchanged at 4.75-5.00 % but signaled it could begin easing at mid-year if inflation keeps moderating.  Since then, the 3-year yield has traded around 3.6-3.7 %, implying markets already discount roughly 150 bp of cuts over the next three years.  To judge where the yield may print on 10 Feb 2026 we need fresh information on:
• Any dovish/hawkish Fed commentary in the days after the meeting.  
• Key data releases before 10 Feb (January payrolls on 6 Feb, CPI revisions on 7 Feb, and the January CPI report due 10 Feb at 8:30 am ET).  
• Treasury’s quarterly refunding details and auction results for 3-year notes (auction scheduled 5 Feb).  
News articles and commentary covering these events will give the best inside view of how traders might re-price the front end of the curve between now and 10 Feb.
