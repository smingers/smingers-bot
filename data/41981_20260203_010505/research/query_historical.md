Analysis:
The series DGS3 reflects the constantly updated 3-year Treasury yield, which is driven primarily by the market’s expectations for the federal-funds path, inflation, and term-premia.  In the month before our target date (10 Feb 2026) the key scheduled macro events are: the 28–29 Jan 2026 FOMC meeting (decision already known), the January CPI release on 5 Feb 2026, and the Treasury’s quarterly refunding announcement on 5 Feb 2026.  The 3-year yield typically moves 5–15 bp on a single strong data surprise, and daily σ over the last year has been about 6 bp.  For an outside view we should look at:  
• The level and daily volatility of DGS3 over the last 3–12 months.  
• How the 3-year yield responded to the comparable data releases in 2024-25.  
• The spread between the 3-year and the expected path of the fed-funds rate (e.g., via SOFR futures).  
Collecting those historical points will give a baseline distribution to anchor our forecast for 10 Feb 2026.
