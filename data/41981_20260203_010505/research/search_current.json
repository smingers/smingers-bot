The $30 trillion Treasury market has remained stable despite broader financial market turmoil and renewed concerns about the 'Sell America' trade. This stability is partly due to the Treasury\u2019s reliance on short-term T-bills, which accounted for over 80% of total issuance in 2025, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Investors are particularly focused on whether the Treasury will increase the sizes of auctions for securities ranging from 2-year notes to 30-year bonds\u2014changes that could increase supply, drive down bond prices, and push yields higher. The Treasury\u2019s current guidance, last updated in November, included preliminary consideration of larger auctions. If the guidance remains unchanged, TD Securities\u2019 Gennadiy Goldberg predicts yields could decline; if altered, he warns this could create immediate upward pressure on interest rates. The Treasury has already disclosed a $574 billion net marketable debt borrowing expectation for January\u2013March 2026, exceeding estimates from TD Securities ($561B), Deutsche Bank, and Jefferies ($555B). On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3.6 basis points to 4.28%, and the 30-year yield increased nearly the same amount to 4.9%, while major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. TD Securities\u2019 base case anticipates auction size increases beginning in late 2026, while Jefferies\u2019 Thomas Simons urged openness to potential surprises in the guidance. The announcement will follow the release of the ADP private-sector employment report by 15 minutes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:32 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20260202141/heres-the-one-thing-the-bond-market-is-hoping-to-avoid-on-wednesday)\n\n**Is the U.S. Treasury a true safe-haven amid volatile stock markets and shifting Fed leadership? With 10-year yields at 4.27%, how safe are Treasurys?**\nOn February 2, 2026, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields surged to 4.275%, while the 30-year yield reached 4.903%, driven by a sharp rise in the ISM Manufacturing PMI to 52.6\u2014well above the expected 48.4\u2014marking the first expansion in over 26 months. This data signaled a faster-than-expected rebound in U.S. industrial activity, reducing expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts. Concurrently, President Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair intensified market concerns, as Warsh is known for his 'hawkish' stance on the Fed\u2019s $6.6 trillion balance sheet and has historically opposed aggressive monetary expansion. Markets now anticipate a 'bear steepening' of the yield curve, where long-term yields rise faster than short-term ones, reflecting expectations of tighter financial conditions and prolonged inflation risks. Despite the U.S. Treasury\u2019s traditional status as a safe-haven asset, yields are rising\u2014not falling\u2014indicating that investors are reacting to strong economic data and policy uncertainty rather than risk aversion. Short-term yields (e.g., 2-year at 3.567%) remain elevated, while long-term yields are sensitive to fiscal policy, inflation pressures (e.g., 0.7% monthly producer price increase in December), and balance sheet runoff expectations. The market is pricing in two conflicting scenarios: eventual rate cuts if growth slows, and sustained high rates due to balance sheet discipline. Investors are now closely monitoring upcoming labor data\u2014JOLTS job openings and ADP employment report\u2014to assess whether economic momentum will persist. While Treasurys remain default-free, their price volatility has increased, making them safer than equities but more volatile than in past cycles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:28 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/is-the-u-s-treasury-a-true-safe-haven-amid-volatile-stock-markets-and-shifting-fed-leadership-with-10-year-yields-at-4-27-how-safe-are-treasurys/articleshow/127866980.cms)\n\n**10 Charts Outlining Holiday Price Action and Macro Signals in Fixed Income | Investing.com**\nThe article analyzes the current state of US fixed income markets through ten charts, highlighting that the bond bear market, which peaked in 2020, remains ongoing despite signs of potential reversal. The long-term US Treasury ETF (TLT) is still in a bear market, having underperformed since its peak, and has been 'dead money' for long-term investors. However, technical indicators suggest a possible basing phase, with TLT price index recovering from a logical support level. Sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish: short positions are elevated, individual investor bond allocations are at 18-year lows, and the consensus (68%) expects US 10-year yields to remain in a 3.5%-4.5% range through 2026. Despite this, valuations are trending toward cheap levels, creating a potential contrarian bullish setup. Global long-term government bond yields show similar patterns, with higher-for-longer yields likely due to a structural rise in the nominal rate of economic growth post-2020. Historical context suggests long-term yield cycles, but with possible compression due to accelerating global dynamics like technology, geopolitics, and debt. The article concludes that while macro and price confirmation are still needed, bonds are worth monitoring, especially as equities appear expensive and economic softening looms. The author emphasizes that investment decisions should be data-driven rather than intuitive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:40 PM\nSource:[investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/10-charts-outlining-holiday-price-action-and-macro-signals-in-fixed-income-200671251)\n\n**A Million-Ruble Idea with Oleg Bogdanov**\nIn the current Russian market environment, investors frequently report a lack of viable investment opportunities, as the stock market remains stagnant amid high uncertainty. With the Central Bank of Russia maintaining a high key interest rate, government bonds offer yields of around 14%, making them a popular choice. However, a unique instrument has emerged: 'Cherkizovo' launched retail-only bonds on the Moscow Exchange's 'FinUslugi' marketplace at the end of last year. These bonds offer a yield of 16.7%, calculated as the key rate plus 70 basis points, and are exclusively available to individual investors. The key feature of this instrument is daily interest accrual, with redemption at face value upon maturity.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:22 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8398794)\n\n**152 Billion Yuan of Treasury Bonds Reissued, Liquidity Abundance Supports Bond Market Sentiment, 30-Year Treasury Bond ETF (511090) Rises 0.41% in Morning Trading**\nOn February 2, 2026, the 30-year Treasury bond ETF (511090) rose 0.41% during the morning session, with a turnover of 1.8% and trading volume reaching 382 million yuan. Over the past year, the ETF's average daily trading volume was 8.315 billion yuan as of January 30, 2026. The Ministry of Finance announced the first\u7eed\u53d1\u884c (reissuance) of two types of book-entry interest-bearing bonds for 2026: a 1-year fixed-rate bond with a competitive bidding face value of 120 billion yuan, and a 30-year fixed-rate bond with a competitive bidding face value of 32 billion yuan, both to be auctioned on February 6, 2026, from 10:35 to 11:35. The People's Bank of China conducted a 750 billion yuan 7-day reverse repurchase operation on February 2, 2026, at a rate of 1.40%, with full bidding and winning, resulting in a net withdrawal of 755 billion yuan after 1.505 trillion yuan in reverse repos matured. According to Huabao Securities, liquidity remains ample due to a 900 billion yuan 1-year MLF operation on January 23, 2026, and the PBOC governor's reaffirmation that there is still room for RRR cuts and rate cuts, reinforcing expectations of policy easing. This supports bond market sentiment in both the short and medium term.

The 10-year benchmark bond yield rose by seven basis points, driven by concerns over elevated borrowing supply, with Nomura projecting weekly gross supply at Rs 37,000 crore, up from Rs 31,000 crore, assuming 47 auctions. State borrowing is expected at Rs 12.75 trillion, though risks point to a higher figure due to slower central consolidation. Despite soft inflation and an easing bias in interest rates, bond market participants expect yields to remain elevated between 6.60% and 7.00%, with limited room for decline without explicit central bank support. The Indian rupee rebounded by 0.5%, settling at 91.52 per dollar, its strongest single-day gain since December 19, 2025, supported by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dollar sales and mid-tenor buy/sell swaps to manage volatility. The RBI\u2019s intervention helped cushion rupee liquidity and prevent spillover stress into the foreign exchange market. Market participants now await the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting for further cues. Government securities worth Rs 5.5 trillion are set to mature in FY27, and the RBI\u2019s estimated Rs 1 trillion in government securities may enable bond switches to mitigate liquidity drain. The government plans to issue Rs 1.3 trillion in Treasury bills.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:31 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/govt-bond-yields-surge-to-one-year-high-rupee-rebounds-on-rbi-support-126020201164_1.html)\n\n**Why the Foreign Share of U.S. Treasury Holdings Has Declined: A Supply-Driven Illusion**\nThe share of foreign holdings in U.S. Treasury securities has decreased from 46.1% in December 2019 to 36.9% in June 2025, leading to speculation that foreign investors, particularly China and Europe, are selling off U.S. debt. However, this perception is based on a misunderstanding. While the percentage share has declined, the absolute amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by foreign entities increased from $6.8 trillion in December 2019 to $9.4 trillion by November 2025\u2014a rise of $2.6 trillion (38.2%). The decline in share is due to a faster increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, which totaled $9.9 trillion over the same period, driven by pandemic-related fiscal stimulus and rising debt service costs. As a result, the growing supply of U.S. debt has put downward pressure on bond prices and upward pressure on market interest rates, making supply dynamics more influential than interest rate policy in determining market yields. The article concludes that monitoring the scale and maturity structure of new bond issuance is now as critical as central bank rate decisions.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:18 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/1242950.html)\n\n**Budget impact: Indian government bond yields hit highest in one year. How can it affect stock market | Stock Market News**\nOn February 2, 2026, Indian government bond yields rose by 8 basis points (bps) following the government's announcement of higher-than-expected gross borrowing, with the 10-year benchmark bond yield reaching 6.78%, the highest since January 17, 2025. The yield had started at 6.740% and closed at 6.778%, up from 6.696% the previous day. The Union Budget for FY27 estimates gross market borrowings at \u20b917.2 lakh crore, a 16% increase from the current year\u2019s budget estimate, with net market borrowing projected at \u20b911.7 lakh crore to cover a fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP. According to Nomura Holdings Inc. and ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, yields could rise to 7% in the coming weeks. Despite Reserve Bank of India (RBI) market intervention, yields have increased due to high state government bond issuance and declining demand from pension and insurance funds. Alok Sharma, treasury chief at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Mumbai, stated in a Bloomberg report that the central bank must increase bond purchases to enhance liquidity and stabilize yields, warning that 'proactive management of liquidity will be necessary, or yields will only continue to rise.' The rising borrowing costs add pressure on an economy already facing significant US tariffs and constrained by limited scope for further interest rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:56 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/bonds/budget-impact-indian-government-bond-yields-hit-highest-in-one-year-how-can-it-affect-stock-market-11770006704588.html)\n\n**Spanish Treasury Returns to Debt Markets Next Week with February Auctions**\nThe Spanish Treasury (El Tesoro P\u00fablico) will return to debt markets next week with two auctions: one on Tuesday, February 3, for six- and twelve-month treasury bills, and another on Thursday, February 5, for medium- and long-term bonds and obligations. The February 3 auction previously allocated \u20ac6.0772 billion, with marginal yields rising to 2.002% for six-month bills and 2.048% for twelve-month bills. On February 5, four new debt instruments will be issued: a 3-year state bond with a 2.35% coupon, a 7-year obligation with a 3% coupon, a 7-year and 10-month inflation-linked obligation with a 0.70% coupon, and a 9-year and 9-month obligation with a 3.20% coupon. Reference yields for these instruments are 2.348% (3-year), 2.943% (7-year), 1.280% (inflation-linked), and 3.204% (9-year and 9-month). To date, \u20ac29.787 billion has been issued in medium- and long-term debt, representing 16.8% of the 2026 financing program.

Analysts had anticipated yield fluctuations, but the slight adjustment suggests a balanced investor approach toward safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainties. The outcome may influence cash management strategies and offer insights into potential future federal interest rate decisions, reflecting broader investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:44 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2878408)\n\n**Market Premium For 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near a fair value estimate, according to three models analyzed by CapitalSpectator.com. As of January 14, 2026, the 10-year yield was trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025, the lowest level in three years. This reflects a continued shift from the elevated market premium seen during 2022\u20132024, signaling a reversal of the sharp rise in the premium. Historically, the yield\u2019s valuation cycle tends to revert toward zero (neutral), suggesting that the current slight premium implies a neutral stance on maturity risk for bond market strategies. In contrast, a higher allocation to maturity risk was recommended in late 2023 when the market premium peaked above 120 basis points. Since then, the 10-year yield has declined and the bond market has rallied. While future cycles are not guaranteed, the recurrence of this pattern\u2014described as 'rhyming'\u2014makes betting against it a high-risk assumption.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 06:45 PM\nSource:[The Capital Spectator](https://www.capitalspectator.com/market-premium-for-10-year-yield-holds-near-fair-value-estimate/)\n\n**Market Premium for 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate | Investing.com UK**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near fair value, according to CapitalSpectator.com's average of three models, with the current estimate showing the yield trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025\u2014close to the lowest level in three years.

These factors boosted bond prices and kept credit risks low, resulting in broad bond indices posting over 7% total returns in 2025 \u2014 the best performance since 2020. The Morningstar US Core Bond Total Return Index gained more than 7%, while investment-grade bonds delivered nearly 8% returns, supported by credit spreads near multi-decade lows (around 80 basis points). However, expectations for 2026 are more muted: traders are pricing in only about 60 basis points of rate cuts, slower than in 2025. Fiscal stimulus measures, including potential tax and spending initiatives, could support growth and keep longer-term yields elevated. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell by over 40 basis points in 2025 to around 4.1%, but major banks forecast they will end 2026 at or slightly above current levels. A divergence may emerge, with shorter-maturity yields declining further while longer-term yields could rise due to stronger growth or higher government debt, pressuring long-duration bond returns. Asset managers are becoming cautious on duration, favoring shorter-dated securities. Credit spreads may widen in 2026 due to increased corporate borrowing, especially from large tech firms, potentially reducing returns for investment-grade and high-yield bonds. While some analysts expect a stronger bond rally if inflation eases and growth slows, requiring aggressive Fed cuts, the overall outlook points to steadier, harder-earned returns compared to the exceptional gains of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-bond-market-faces-a-more-challenging-road-ahead-in-2026/articleshow/126264115.cms)\n\n**10-Year Treasury ETF (511260) Sees Over 1 Billion Yuan Net Inflows in 20 Days, Capitalizing on Bond Market Trading Opportunities**\nThe 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) has seen net inflows exceeding 1 billion yuan over the past 20 days, positioning investors to capture short-term trading opportunities in the bond market. According to Xiangcai Securities, the Chinese bond market is expected to remain in a volatile state in 2025. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s 2025 rate cuts have narrowed the U.S.-China interest rate differential, China\u2019s monetary policy remains focused on domestic conditions, with interest rates already at historically low levels and limited room for further declines. The domestic economic fundamentals are unlikely to improve significantly in the short term, leading to a forecast that the 10-year Treasury yield will remain in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2026. With the 1-year deposit rate around 1%, further rate cuts are constrained, while increased government bond supply and earlier issuance are expected to alleviate the 'asset shortage' situation. As a result, a sustained bull market in bonds in 2026 is unlikely, prompting a strategic shift from 'buy and hold' to tactical trading to exploit short-term market disruptions. The 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) tracks the SSE 10-year Treasury Index, selecting government bonds with 7 to 10 years remaining maturity listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, maintaining a constant duration. Since its inception, the ETF has consistently achieved new net asset value highs, with strong historical performance: a 4.17% return over the past year, 14.04% over three years, 23.39% over five years, and a cumulative return of 35.77% since launch. Notably, the ETF has posted positive annual returns across all seven full calendar years since its 2017 inception, making it a potential tool for long-term asset allocation. Risk disclosures state that historical performance is not indicative of future results, and investors should review fund documents to understand risk profiles and suitability. The ETF\u2019s performance data from 2017 to 2025H1 shows mixed results relative to its benchmark, with returns ranging from -1.55% to 9.02% and benchmark returns from -1.01% to 8.09%.

This stability reflects a balanced monetary policy stance, with no aggressive rate hikes or cuts, signaling that inflation pressures may be under control and investor confidence in U.S. government securities remains intact. The consistent yield suggests a degree of predictability in short-term financial markets and indicates underlying confidence in the nation's fiscal health as the year concludes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 05:04 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2846633)\n\n**US 10-year Treasury yields priced for no inflation surprises, set to rise modestly: Reuters poll**\nAccording to a Reuters poll of over 50 bond strategists conducted from November 6 to 13, 2025, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are expected to rise modestly to 4.10% in three and six months, and to 4.21% within a year, assuming no significant upside inflation surprises. The current 10-year yield stands at 4.09%. Despite a projected $3 trillion in additional borrowing over the next decade due to President Donald Trump\u2019s recently passed budget, the anticipated surge in supply has not yet materially impacted market pricing. Market-based inflation expectations, as reflected in breakeven rates from inflation-protected Treasury securities, are lower than earlier in the year, coinciding with the absence of official inflation data during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended on November 12, 2025. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, noted that bond markets tend to overreact to short-term developments, suggesting the market may be over-indexing on recent inflation trends. He cautioned against positioning for near-term inflation moves, as markets will eventually correct to reflect more accurate inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge remains near 3%, above the 2% target, for over four years, and consumer inflation expectations have stayed elevated. Boston Fed President Susan Collins emphasized caution regarding future rate cuts, particularly ahead of the December 17\u201318, 2025, Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The two-year Treasury yield, currently at 3.58%, is forecast to decline to 3.50% in three months and 3.40% in six months. Despite internal divisions on the Fed, interest rate futures still price in three to four rate cuts by the end of 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!
