However, longer-term bond yields remained rangebound in recent months due to lower inflation expectations offsetting stronger economic growth expectations.\"\n\n- \"Economists predicted modestly higher inflation this year, and recent data confirmed those forecasts. Consensus now points to a gradual slowdown in inflation. Tariff price pressures appeared in business surveys and accelerating core goods prices, but these effects haven't been extreme.\"\n\n- \"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent does not plan to increase auction sizes for longer maturities. Rather, the Treasury indicates it will issue more short-term bills, where heavy issuance is unlikely to disrupt broad bond market pricing in the near term.\"\n\n- \"Recently, rate cuts pulled Treasury yields lower. Over the long run, bond buyers want to see federal cash flow support bond principal and interest payments, which would suggest lower spending or higher taxes.\"\n\n- \"Economic conditions can support continued earnings growth, creating favorable equity and real asset return opportunities.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- **Fed Projections:** Median Fed member projections anticipate one 2026 cut, while investors expect two additional cuts (this gap can create near-term bond market volatility)\n- **Inflation:** Remains above the Fed's target\n- **Treasury Issuance Strategy:** More short-term bills rather than increasing longer maturity auction sizes\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-economic-projections-2025-2028\">\n# Summary of CBO Economic Projections Article (September 19, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**GDP Growth:**\n- Real GDP grew 2.5% in 2024\n- CBO projects 1.4% growth in 2025 (0.5 percentage points lower than previously projected)\n- CBO projects 2.2% growth in 2026 (0.4 percentage points higher than previously projected)\n- Growth expected to normalize at ~1.8% per year beyond 2026\n- By 2028, output projected to be ~0.1% higher than previously estimated\n\n**Inflation (PCE Price Index):**\n- 2.5% in 2024\n- CBO projects 3.1% in 2025\n- CBO projects 2.4% in 2026\n- CBO projects 2.0% per year thereafter\n- Previous CBO projections: 2.2% for 2025, 2.1% for 2026\n\n**Unemployment Rate:**\n- 4.1% at end of 2024\n- CBO projects 4.5% in 2025\n- CBO projects 4.2% in 2026\n- CBO projects stabilization at 4.4% in 2027-2028\n\n**Interest Rates - 10-Year Treasury:**\n- Averaged 4.0% in 2023\n- Averaged 4.2% in 2024\n- CBO projects 4.3% average in 2025\n- CBO projects slow decline to 3.9% by 2028\n- Previous CBO projection: rates would fall more quickly to 3.9%\n\n**Interest Rates - 3-Month Treasury Bill:**\n- 5.0% in 2024\n- CBO projects 4.1% in 2025\n- CBO projects 3.5% in 2026\n- CBO projects 3.2% by 2028\n- Previous CBO projections: 3.8% in 2025, 3.3% in 2026, 3.2% by 2028\n\n## Named Source Comparisons:\n\n**Federal Reserve projections:**\n- PCE inflation: 3.0% in 2025, 2.6% in 2026, 2.0% long run\n- Unemployment: 4.4% by end of 2026, 4.3% in 2027, 4.2% in 2028\n- Federal funds rate: 3.6% in 2025, 3.4% in 2026, 3.1% in 2027-2028\n\n**OMB (Office of Management and Budget) projections:**\n- GDP growth: ~3% annually over next few years\n- PCE inflation: 2.4% in 2025, 2.0% starting in 2026\n- Unemployment: 4.1% in 2025, 3.9% in 2026, 3.7% in 2027-2028\n- 10-year Treasury: 4.3% in 2025 declining to 3.5% by 2028\n\n**Council of Economic Advisers:**\n- Appears to predict ~4% annual growth (less reliable - uses \"appears to\")\n\n## Key Drivers:\n- Tariffs reducing near-term output and increasing near-term inflation\n- OBBBA tax cuts and spending boosting 2026 output\n- Border and immigration changes expected to reduce labor force size and output\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on 10-year Treasury and 3-month Treasury bill projections.

Series identity and metadata  \n    \u2022  The DGS3 page on FRED confirms that the series is expressed in percent, is not seasonally adjusted and is published at daily frequency (business days only) [FRED Graph page containing DGS3, source \u201cfred.stlouisfed\u201d].  \n    \u2022  Business-day gaps (week-ends and Federal holidays) are simply absent from the download files.  \n    \u2022  The page offers a \u201cDownload\u201d-button that can export the data as CSV or Excel for any custom date span [same FRED page].\n\n2.  Programmatic access is documented  \n    \u2022  The official FRED API endpoint /fred/series/observations supports the parameters series_id, observation_start, observation_end, frequency and file_type [FRED API documentation, source \u201cfred.stlouisfed\u201d in the search results].  \n    \u2022  A registered (free) API key is required, supplied as api_key=YOUR_KEY.  \n    \u2022  Example call (returns JSON):  \n      https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DGS3&observation_start=2025-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&frequency=d&file_type=json&api_key=YOUR_KEY.\n\n3.  No result set in the search dump includes the day-by-day numerical observations for 2025-01-01 \u2192 2026-02-29, nor any pre-calculated mean, standard deviation or \u201clast value\u201d.  \n    \u2022  Some snippets show other tenor codes (DGS30, DGS5, etc.) or graph embeds, but none expose the required numeric table.  \n    \u2022  Therefore the raw data necessary for computation are still absent.\n\n4.  Statistical specification details that remain ambiguous  \n    \u2022  Population vs. sample standard deviation: FRED itself does not prescribe either; the user needs to clarify whether the divisor should be N or (N-1).  \n    \u2022  Definition of \u201clast price\u201d: typical interpretation is the most recent available observation in the requested date window (normally the entry dated 2026-02-28 because 29 Feb 2026 is a Sunday, thus no trading day). Confirmation desired.\n\nWhat is still missing\n\n\u2022  The actual observation list (roughly 280 business-day rows) between 1 Jan 2025 and 29 Feb 2026.  \n\u2022  Execution of a simple aggregation routine (in Excel, Python/pandas, R/fredr, etc.) to compute:  \n  \u2013 arithmetic mean = \u03a3xi / N  \n  \u2013 standard deviation = \u221a[\u03a3(xi \u2013 x\u0304)\u00b2 / (N \u2013 \u03b4)] with \u03b4 = 0 (population) or 1 (sample)  \n  \u2013 last value = xN (the final date\u2019s yield).\n\nNext actionable step\n\nThe quickest, reproducible method is the FRED API:\n\ncurl \"https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DGS3&observation_start=2025-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&frequency=d&file_type=csv&api_key=YOUR_KEY\" > dgs3.csv  \n\nImport dgs3.csv into your analytics tool and run the three computations.\n\nIf the user prefers a GUI, navigate to the DGS3 series page, click Download \u2192 \u201cCustomize data\u201d, set Start = 2025-01-01, End = 2026-02-29, Frequency = Daily, and download the resulting CSV. The downloaded file already omits blank days, so no additional filtering is needed.\n\nClarifications to request of the user\n\n1. Should the standard deviation be population (N) or sample (N-1)?  \n2. Is \u201clast price\u201d strictly the last business day in range (e.g., 2026-02-28) or should the script try to interpolate a missing 2026-02-29?  \n3. Deliverable format: just three numbers, or a small table that shows mean, stdev and last value with the date stamp?\n\nConclusion\n\nAll methodological information is in place, but the numeric data for 2025-01-01 \u2192 2026-02-29 must still be downloaded from FRED. Once those observations are obtained, the requested statistics can be produced in a single pass. At present the key information gap is the raw daily yield values themselves.</Agent_report>\n"
