Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds, and how reliable)
1) **Nasdaq earnings page (corrupted/incomplete extract)**
- **What it says (facts):** Nothing usable—page content appears broken.
- **Usefulness:** None for forecasting.
- **Quality:** Effectively unusable due to extraction failure.

2) **Yahoo Finance / GuruFocus recap of ServiceNow Q4 2025 earnings call (Jan 29, 2026)**
- **Facts:** Concrete operating/financial metrics (subscription revenue growth, operating margin, renewal rate, RPO, cash, buyback authorization, 2026 guidance ranges).
- **Opinions/interpretation:** Discussion of AI strategy, competitive landscape, and margin headwinds; these are partly management framing and partly reporter interpretation.
- **Quality:** Generally high for *what was said/reported* (earnings call recap), but it does not directly give a short-horizon (9-day) price move expectation.

3) **Motley Fool (Feb 1, 2026)**
- **Facts:** Claims about past performance, forward multiple, analyst distribution/counts, and cited price targets.
- **Opinions:** Strongly promotional tone (“could soar”), and relies on selective analyst upside framing; retail-investor media is not neutral.
- **Quality:** Mixed. The *existence* of bullish Street targets is informative, but the article’s implied upside is not directly usable for a 1–2 week horizon.

4) **TechStock² article about T-Mobile (Feb 3, 2026)**
- **Facts:** About T-Mobile price move, layoffs, and upcoming earnings.
- **Relevance:** Not directly relevant to NOW except as very light general market color.
- **Quality:** Fine, but largely irrelevant.

5) **Yahoo Finance video/article on Q2 2025 earnings beat (July 23, 2025)**
- **Facts:** Describes prior-quarter earnings beat, includes management-claimed AI metrics and adoption indicators.
- **Opinions:** Heavy CEO/management narrative (“one of one,” taking share, etc.). These are strategic claims, not independently verified forecasts.
- **Quality:** Useful background for business momentum narrative, but dated and not tailored to the Feb 3–Feb 12, 2026 window.

6) **Agent report (prices availability, events calendar, analyst sentiment)**
- **Facts (if correct):** No scheduled NOW events Feb 3–Feb 12; next earnings April 28. Analyst consensus skewed bullish; cites MarketBeat/QuiverQuant summaries; notes a GS downgrade to sell on Jan 12.
- **Caveat:** The report admits data gaps and relies on secondary aggregators; treat as plausible but not definitive without verification.
- **Usefulness:** The key outside-view-relevant takeaway is **“no scheduled catalyst in the window,”** which tends to push outcomes toward being driven by normal noise/market beta rather than discrete jumps.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)
We need a base-rate probability that **a large-cap/mega-cap-ish growth/tech stock** (ServiceNow) finishes **higher after ~9 calendar days (~7 trading days)** than it starts.

Candidate reference classes:
1) **All U.S. equities, 1–2 week horizon (7–10 trading days):**  
   - Pros: Simple and stable; strong base-rate.  
   - Cons: NOW is not “average”; it’s a higher-beta growth stock.

2) **Large-cap U.S. tech / software (SaaS) stocks, 1–2 week horizon:**  
   - Pros: Closer match on volatility/beta and sector factor structure.  
   - Cons: Requires more specific historical sampling; but still the right conceptual class.

3) **Post-earnings windows for growth stocks (1–2 weeks after earnings):**  
   - Pros: NOW recently reported (Jan 28), so there can be post-earnings drift or reversal.  
   - Cons: This becomes “inside-view-ish” and more conditional on surprise magnitude; for an *outside view* we should avoid over-conditioning on one event without robust stats.

**Most suitable for outside view:** #2 (large-cap tech/software over ~7 trading days), with #1 as a sanity-check baseline.

### (c) Timeframe analysis (how long, and what typically happens)
- **Forecast window:** From **2026-02-03 close** to **2026-02-12 close** (about **9 calendar days**, roughly **7 U.S. trading sessions**).
- **Typical pattern over ~1–2 weeks:** Equity indices have a small positive drift; for many liquid U.S. stocks, the probability of being up over a short horizon is usually **only modestly above 50%** (because drift is small relative to volatility).
- **With no scheduled company-specific events** in the window (per Agent report), the distribution is more “random-walk-with-drift” than “catalyst-driven,” which generally keeps the “up” probability near the low-to-mid 50s, not 60–70%.

---

### (d) Justification (integrating base rates with the provided context)
Outside-view logic:
- **Status quo / no-catalyst assumption:** With no earnings, investor day, or known major scheduled disclosure Feb 3–Feb 12, NOW’s move should largely reflect:
  1) broad market direction over the week,
  2) software/AI sector factor moves,
  3) normal idiosyncratic noise.
- **Base rate:** Short-horizon “up vs down” for liquid U.S. equities is generally close to a coin flip, but slightly tilted upward due to equity risk premium (positive drift).
- **Contextual tilt (still outside view, but consistent with sources):**
  - Recent earnings/guidance (Jan 28) described as strong; analyst sentiment skew remains mostly bullish (Agent report; Motley Fool cites high buy ratings). That *could* nudge the base rate slightly upward rather than downward.
  - However, the same materials also mention **margin headwinds** and at least one prominent downgrade (Goldman Sell), suggesting disagreement and limiting how far we should tilt.
- Net: With no imminent catalyst and only modest drift, I would not move far from ~52–55%.

---

Outside view calibration:
- **Anchor (generic base rate for 1–2 week horizon):** ~52–53% chance a stock is up over the interval (reflecting small positive drift).
- **Adjustment for reference class (large-cap growth/software):** could be similar or slightly higher in up markets, but also more volatile; volatility does not inherently change the *probability* of up vs down absent skew, but sentiment/momentum can.
- **Small upward nudge** for “post-earnings positive fundamental narrative + buyback authorization + generally bullish Street skew,” but restrained because (i) short window, (ii) conflicting views, (iii) market/sector can dominate.

**Calibrated outside-view probability (Yes): 54%**

Outside View Prediction:
**54%**
