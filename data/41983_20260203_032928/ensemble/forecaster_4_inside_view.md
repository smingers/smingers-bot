Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CNN markets blurb (no date stamp): purely factual price/technical level summary; decent but undated—treat as low-reliability snapshot.  
2. Tickernerd Jan-2026 report: combines hard data (quote, P/E, analyst counts) with clearly promotional tone; factual numbers reliable, forward opinions weak.  
3. Fortune 28-Jan-2026 earnings piece: reputable outlet summarising actual Q4 results and FY-26 guidance; high quality for hard numbers.  
4. Motley Fool earnings-call transcript 28-Jan-2026: verbatim remarks—excellent primary source for management facts/guidance, opinions are from management.  
5. Globe & Mail 2-Feb-2026 note on Goldman “Conviction List”: factual; single-day bump, moderate relevance.  
6. Nasdaq 29-Jan-2026 “software stocks crushed”: fragmentary, weak.  
7. Asknews macro/crypto/housing items: unrelated to NOW; ignore.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong: none (no structural rule change, no scheduled catalyst in window).  
Moderate (move probability ~±3-5 ppt each)  
• Negative post-earnings drift – price fell 4 % after beat; historical pattern of follow-through (Bernard-Thomas) for ≈1-3 weeks. (leans No)  
• Momentum/technical: still below 200-day SMA and near 52-wk low → bearish short-term sentiment. (leans No)  
• Fresh Goldman “Conviction List” upgrade plus 40/53 analysts at Buy; signals institutional support. (leans Yes)  
• $2 bn accelerated share-repurchase (announced 28-Jan) creates incremental bid over coming weeks. (leans Yes)  

Weak (±1-2 ppt)  
• Oversold conditions sometimes trigger mean reversion bounces. (Yes)  
• Sector beta: if S&P500 rallies, NOW likely follows; macro outlook for next week neutral-slightly positive after India-US trade deal headlines. (Yes)  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 7 U.S. trading days (close 3 Feb → close 12 Feb).  
Halving the window (≈3-4 sessions) would put even more weight on current momentum (slightly lower Yes%).  
Doubling (≈14 sessions) would allow buyback flow & mean-reversion more time to work (slightly higher Yes%).  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a large-cap tech stock being up over seven sessions ≈54 %.  
Adjust −4 ppt for negative post-earnings drift and bearish momentum.  
Add +2 ppt for buyback support.  
Add +0 ppt net for analyst sentiment (bullish, but little 1-week predictive power).  
Add +0 ppt for one-off Goldman upgrade (offset by recent Keybanc underweight).  
Net inside-view probability ≈52 %.  Uncertainty high; I assign a ±8 ppt 1-sigma error band.  

Probability calibration  
I expect that 52 times out of 100 in comparable situations (no catalyst, weak momentum, short window) NOW’s 9-day close would be higher.

Checklist:  
1. Will ServiceNow (NOW) close higher on 12 Feb 2026 than on 3 Feb 2026? 7 trading-day window.  
2. Base rate 54 % (large-cap tech up over one week).  
3. “52 out of 100 times, the close on 12 Feb is higher.”  
4. Key evidence: a) post-earnings negative drift, b) sub-200-day SMA bearish momentum, c) $2 bn ASR starts, d) Goldman upgrade.  
5. Blind-spot: macro shock or sector rally (e.g., Fed dovish remark) could swing market sharply up, making 52 % look too low.  
6. Status-quo is a coin-flip; short horizon and no catalyst justify staying near 50 %.

Probability: 52%
