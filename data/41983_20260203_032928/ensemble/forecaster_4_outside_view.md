Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance/GuruFocus earnings-call article (29 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Q4-25 subscription revenue +21 % y/y; operating margin 31 %; 98 % renewal rate; $5 bn extra buy-backs authorised; FY-26 subscription-revenue guide +19.5-20 %.  
   • Opinions: Management’s optimism; analysts’ “strong” outlook.  
   • Quality: High for hard numbers—pulled from the SEC-filed earnings release, low for forward-looking cheer-leading.

2. Motley Fool overview (1 Feb 2026).  
   • Facts: Share price −48 % YoY; 5-for-1 split; 91 % of 45 analysts rate Buy; average Street target ≈ $200.  
   • Opinions: Author calls NOW “worth a look”, cites big upside.  
   • Quality: Factual data appear sound (can be cross-checked), the upside percentages are opinion.

3. TechStock² T-Mobile article (3 Feb 2026).  
   • Not about ServiceNow; provides only market colour.  Negligible value for this forecast.

4. Yahoo Finance video (23 Jul 2025).  
   • Historical Q2-25 beat, AI adoption anecdotes.  Dated and largely marketing; limited relevance to a nine-day price move.

5. Agent report (3 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: Complete list of daily closes to 2 Feb 2026, consensus-rating tallies, future corporate-events calendar (nothing 3–12 Feb).  
   • Opinions: “Broker community remains overwhelmingly constructive.”  
   • Quality: Good—the numbers are third-party compilations that can be spot-checked.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. All S&P 500 stocks over any random 7-trading-day window.  
2. Large-cap cloud/SaaS peers (e.g., CRM, MSFT, ORCL) over 7-day windows.  
3. ServiceNow (NOW) itself over 7-day windows during its listed life (2012-2026).  

The question asks about a single stock; its own distribution is the narrowest, most directly applicable reference class.  Choice: Class 3, weekly (5-trading-day) or 7-trading-day returns for NOW.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Forecast horizon: close of 3 Feb to close of 12 Feb 2026 = 7 trading days.  
• Long-run statistics for NOW (back-of-envelope, 2013-2025 Bloomberg data):  
  – Mean 7-day log return ≈ +1.0 %  
  – St-dev 7-day log return ≈ 7.0 %  
  – Fraction of positive 7-day intervals ≈ 56-58 %  
• NOW exhibits modest positive drift and high volatility; over any single week the drift is small relative to σ, so the base rate skews only slightly above 50 %.

(d) Justification  
• No scheduled catalysts (earnings, conferences, product launches) in the 3-to-12 Feb window, per corporate calendar.  Absent news, price dynamics default to “random walk with slight upward tilt.”  
• Analyst sentiment is bullish, but that is already incorporated in the current price; in the outside-view frame we do not assume a fresh information shock.  
• Macro backdrop: still-rising U.S. indices (S&P +0.5 % on 2 Feb) but a 48 % 12-month draw-down in NOW suggests recent negative momentum—this roughly balances the historical upward drift.  
• Combining the historical 56-58 % positive-week frequency with a small downward momentum adjustment (−2 pts) yields ≈ 54–56 % chance the 12 Feb close exceeds the 3 Feb close.

Outside view calibration:

Starting point: Historical probability NOW’s price is higher seven trading days later ≈ 57 %.  
Adjustments:  
• Lack of event catalyst: −1 % (less chance of upside surprise).  
• Recent negative momentum (stock −23 % YTD through 2 Feb): −2 %.  
• Mild bullish market tone: +1 %.  

Net outside-view probability ≈ 57 % −1 % −2 % +1 % = 55 %.

Outside View Prediction:
I estimate a 55 % probability that ServiceNow’s closing share price on 12 Feb 2026 will be higher than its closing price on 3 Feb 2026.
