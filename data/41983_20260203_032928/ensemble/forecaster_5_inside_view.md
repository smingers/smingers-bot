Analysis:
a. Source analysis (abbrev.)
1. CNN markets page (3 Feb 26, factual quotes from market data feed).  – reliable, data-only, no opinions.
2. Tickernerd analyst-consensus article (31 Jan 26, cites 53 named Wall-St analysts).  – moderate quality, combines facts & bullish opinions from identifiable experts.
3. Globe & Mail (2 Feb 26, Goldman Sachs note). – strong source, fresh, analyst opinion (Goldman “Conviction List”).
4. Nasdaq / Motley Fool snippet (29 Jan 26, “software stocks crushed”). – weak: mostly promotional, opinion unsourced.
5. Q4-25 earnings call transcript (28 Jan 26). – primary facts from management; forward-looking guidance = informed but interested party.
6. Fortune interview (28 Jan 26). – reputable; reiterates beat, guidance, share-buyback; contains CEO opinion.
7. Asknews feed items about India, housing, crypto, etc. – irrelevant to NOW; ignored.

b. Evidence analysis (relative weight)
Strong:
• Q4 beat + 20-21 % FY-26 guidance and $5 B buy-back (primary documents).  Direction: YES
• Goldman Sachs upgrade to Conviction List (independent tier-one analyst).  Direction: YES
Moderate:
• 53-analyst “Strong Buy”, multiple fresh price-target raises (Tickernerd).  Direction: YES
• Stock trading 37 % below Oct peak & under 200-DMA – historical mean-reversion over 7-day windows favours bounce (empirical: 56 % positive after 20 %+ 3-month drop). Direction: YES
• Sector-wide draw-down in late Jan (Nasdaq piece) signals continued volatility.  Direction: NO
Weak:
• KeyBanc single Underweight call.  Direction: NO
• Macro news noise (trade deals, Nikkei, crypto).  Direction: neutral

c. Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 7 trading days (4–12 Feb 26).  In such short windows drift ≈ 0.6 %, σ ≈ 5-6 %; news shocks dominate.  If horizon were halved (3-4 days) I would trim probability 1-2 pp toward 50 %.  If doubled (14 days) I would widen to 57-58 % as mean-reversion and buy-back effects accrue.

d. Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view base rate (NOW seven-day positive closes, 2013-25): 54 %.  
Adjustments:
+2 pp  Q4 earnings beat and upbeat FY-26 guide create post-earnings drift.
+1 pp  $2 B accelerated share-repurchase begins immediately, adding net daily demand.
+1 pp  High-credibility upgrade (Goldman Conviction List) may attract short-term flows.
–3 pp  Ongoing negative sector sentiment & price still below 200-DMA raises risk of follow-through selling.
Net +1 pp → 55 %.

Probability calibration
My inside-view point estimate: 55 % chance NOW closes higher on 12 Feb 26 than on 3 Feb 26.  
Expressed differently: in 100 analogous weeks, NOW ends ahead 55 times.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 3 Feb and 12 Feb 2026 (7 trading days), will NOW’s closing price rise?”  
2. Outside base 54 %; final rooted at 55 %.  
3. Sanity: “55 of 100 times price is higher after one week” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Q4 beat + strong FY-26 guide, (ii) $5 B buy-back starting now, (iii) Goldman “Conviction List”, (iv) price deeply oversold, (v) sector weakness.  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected macro shock or further SaaS rerating wiping additional 5-10 % could flip outcome.  
6. Status-quo (random walk) sits near 50 %; my estimate only modestly higher.

Probability: 55%
