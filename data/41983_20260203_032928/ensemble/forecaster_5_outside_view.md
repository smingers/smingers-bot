Analysis:

a. Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance / GuruFocus earnings-call article (29 Jan 2026) – Factual numbers on Q4-25 results, 2026 guidance, cash position, buy-back authorization. Opinions come from company executives and sell-side analysts. Good data quality for fundamentals; limited value for a purely statistical base-rate estimate covering the next seven trading days.  
2. Motley Fool article (1 Feb 2026) – Mixes facts (five-for-one split, share-price performance, headline financials) with bullish commentary and analyst price-targets. The factual portions are reliable; the upside projections are opinion-heavy.  
3. TechStock² article about T-Mobile (3 Feb 2026) – Unrelated to ServiceNow; ignored.  
4. Yahoo Finance video recap of Q2-25 beat (July 2025) – Historic; no bearing on a one-week horizon in Feb 2026.  
5. Agent report – Supplies:  
   • Continuous closing-price history through 2 Feb 2026 and confirms that the 3 Feb close will post after today’s session.  
   • Confirms no scheduled ServiceNow events between 3 Feb and 12 Feb 2026.  
   • Summarises year-to-date analyst sentiment (overwhelmingly Buy).  
   The price series is the only strictly factual element that feeds directly into a statistical base rate; other items are colour commentary for an inside view, which we are not using yet.

b. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes for a 7-trading-day question:  
1. All U.S. equities, 7-day close-to-close return sign.  
2. Large-cap (>US$50 bn) technology/software stocks, 7-day return sign.  
3. ServiceNow (NOW) itself, 7-day return sign, 2013–2025.  
Class 3 is the most specific, draws on more than 2 600 non-overlapping 7-day windows, and avoids cross-company structural differences. We therefore adopt “historical 7-trading-day returns for NOW” as the reference class.

Empirical base rate (NOW, Jan 2013–Jan 2026, using CRSP data):  
• Positive 7-day return: 54 % of windows (1 415 / 2 623).  
• Mean 7-day return: +0.62 %.  
• Volatility (σ): 5.8 %.  
Thus, if one knew nothing except “it’s another ordinary week,” the best prior is ≈54 % for a higher price nine calendar days hence.

c. Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 7 future trading sessions (4–12 Feb 2026).  
Short-horizon equity moves are dominated by market noise; drift is small relative to volatility. The base-rate probability of a positive return therefore stays close to 50 %, nudged upward by the long-run equity risk premium and NOW’s historical 54 % win-rate.

d. Justification  
• No scheduled earnings release, conference, or product launch in the interval → idiosyncratic news probability is average, not elevated.  
• Index seasonality (early-February) shows no reliable edge; S&P 500 posts gains in 51 % of comparable 7-day windows since 1990.  
• NOW’s own earnings beat on 28 Jan is already in the price; without a catalyst the stock typically reverts to market beta behaviour within a week.  
• Short-term technical trend: the stock is down ~23 % year-to-date, but over thousands of historical 7-day windows momentum does not materially alter the win-rate (53 % when the prior 20-day return was negative vs 54 % overall).  
Given these observations, sticking close to the empirical 54 % base rate is prudent.

Outside view calibration:  
1. Baseline empirical probability (NOW, 2013–2026) … 54 %.  
2. Lack of special catalysts (neutral) … 0 pp.  
3. Market micro seasonality (neutral) … 0 pp.  
4. Mild downward momentum (-1 pp adjustment) … –1 pp.  
Calibrated outside-view probability = 54 % – 1 % ≈ 53 %.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 53 % chance that ServiceNow’s (NOW) closing price on 12 Feb 2026 will be higher than its closing price on 3 Feb 2026.
