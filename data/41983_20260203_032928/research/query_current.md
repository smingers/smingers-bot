Analysis:
The key nine-day window (Feb 3 → Feb 12) falls just after ServiceNow’s late-January earnings release (FY-2025 results were reported Jan 29 2026). Shares jumped on the print, so follow-up commentary from analysts—especially on revised FY-2026 guidance, GenAI products, federal-sector momentum and valuation vs. high-growth SaaS peers—will be decisive for short-term price direction. I therefore need very recent pieces (Feb 1-3) discussing:
• Post-earnings analyst upgrades/downgrades and new price targets.  
• Any fresh macro or rates-driven tech-sector sell-off/support that could move large-cap SaaS names.  
• Option flow or buyback announcements that could buoy the stock.  
• Broader S&P-500 tech sentiment ahead of CPI (Feb 10) and potential Fed remarks.
