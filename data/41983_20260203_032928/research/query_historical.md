Analysis:
The key to judging whether NOW will close higher on 2026-02-12 than on 2026-02-03 is understanding (a) its very recent price trend, (b) any imminent catalysts—especially the Q4 2025 earnings release (usually late-Jan/early-Feb), guidance changes, or macro/sector news—and (c) how the stock has historically behaved in the days immediately after its winter earnings report.  Therefore I need: 1) the exact or expected date of the forthcoming earnings announcement and any guidance; 2) analyst and news sentiment for early-Feb 2026; and 3) a short-term historical price series to gauge momentum/volatility around comparable periods in prior years.
