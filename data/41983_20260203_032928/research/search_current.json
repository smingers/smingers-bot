The Nifty 50 and Sensex are anticipated to see a gap-up start, supported by the Gift Nifty trading at 25,937\u2014795 points above the previous Nifty futures close.

This indicates a shrinking gap between asking prices and actual sale prices, suggesting sellers are setting more realistic prices. Gisborne had the largest discount at 5.9 percent, followed by Northland at 5.5 percent and the West Coast at 5 percent, while Taranaki had the smallest discount at 3.1 percent. Chief economist Kelvin Davidson attributed the trend to increased access to property valuation information, which has made it harder for sellers to set inflated prices and for buyers to secure undervalued deals through aggressive underbidding. He noted that prolonged flat property prices have led sellers to become more realistic in their expectations, with many now prioritizing closing sales over waiting for a market rebound. National stock levels rose 2.3 percent year-on-year in January 2026, the first time since 2014 that over 33,000 properties were available for sale in January, with Gisborne seeing a 15.1 percent increase in available stock. The data excludes auctioned properties.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:50 PM\nSource:[RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/585793/how-much-less-than-asking-price-are-house-buyers-paying)\n\n**Housing's power shift: Buyers regaining the upper hand**\nThe U.S. housing market is shifting back toward buyers after years of seller dominance, according to The Wall Street Journal. Nearly two-thirds of homes sold in 2025 closed below their original listing price\u2014the highest share since 2019\u2014with average discounts reaching about 8%, per Redfin data. Buyers are increasingly securing concessions such as cash for closing costs or mortgage rate buydowns. This shift is driven by a nationwide imbalance, with over 600,000 more sellers than buyers, despite overall home sales remaining near 30-year lows. High prices and elevated mortgage rates continue to deter many potential buyers, but those who do transact now benefit from increased inventory and stronger negotiating power. The market has become especially buyer-friendly in parts of the South, including Florida and Texas, where recent construction has expanded supply. With mortgage rates easing and price growth slowing, economists anticipate modest sales gains and a more balanced pricing environment in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:02 PM\nSource:[Baton Rouge Business Report](https://www.businessreport.com/article/housings-power-shift-buyers-regaining-the-upper-hand)\n\n**On Monday 2nd of February Eggdog trades 0.36 percent higher**\nOn Monday, February 2, 2026, Eggdog () rose 0.36% over a 24-hour period, closing at 03:20 PM Central Europe Time.

Meanwhile, international developments remain in focus: Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly intends to revise his negotiating stance with U.S. President Donald Trump due to alleged Ukrainian terrorist attacks, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed as lies.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/aktien/dax-aktuell-vor-silvesterpause-dax-zeigt-sich-im-verkuerzten-dienstagshandel-freundlich-15376105)\n\n**Market Forecast for December 29, 2025 \u2013 January 2, 2026**\nThe market outlook for the period from December 29, 2025, to January 2, 2026, reflects low liquidity ahead of Christmas holidays and limited significant macroeconomic data releases. According to broker firm XFINE, market focus centered on U.S. data, including revised Q3 GDP and PCE inflation figures published on December 23\u201324, which set the tone for trading. Price movements were amplified by positioning and profit-taking near year-end. EUR/USD ended the week up 63 points (1.1771 vs. 1.1708), validating a moderately bullish forecast. A retest of resistance at 1.1800\u20131.1820 is possible, with potential pullbacks to 1.1700, then 1.1650\u20131.1680, and further to 1.1575\u20131.1615. A confirmed breakout above 1.1800\u20131.1820 could lead to 1.1900\u20131.1915 and eventually 1.2000. However, holiday-related low liquidity may distort price action, so breakouts should be confirmed by follow-through. BTC/USD closed near $87,400, trading within a narrow consolidation range of $86,360\u2013$90,580. Volatility may expand to $83,800\u2013$94,500; a sustained close above $95,000\u2013$100,000 is needed to reverse the bearish scenario, currently deemed unlikely. A break below $83,800 could target $80,540. Brent crude rose to $62.17 before falling to $60.10, closing at $60.39. The $60.00 level remains a key support/resistance zone, with a potential rebound to $61.50\u201363.00, risk of return to $60.00, and further to $58.50 and the annual low of $58.17. A close above $65.00\u2013$66.00 would invalidate the bearish scenario and open a path to $69.00\u2013$70.00. XAU/USD reached $4,500 per ounce on December 23 and closed the week at $4,532, confirming a strong uptrend. Short-term corrections may target $4,350\u20134,380, but a break below $4,250 would temporarily invalidate the bullish case, risking deeper declines to $4,170\u20134,200. Bullish targets for Q1 2026 are $4,700, with a potential rise to $5,000 under favorable macro conditions. The overall market outlook is neutral with a modestly bullish bias for EUR/USD (if above 1.1680\u20131.1700), neutral for BTC/USD within consolidation, neutral with a modestly bearish tilt for Brent, and bullish for XAU/USD, with buying opportunities on rebounds from $4,350\u20134,380 and $4,250.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 08:18 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d](http://minfin.com.ua/ua/2025/12/29/165190918/)\n\n**XRP, ADA, SOL Slide Drop 3% As Charts Warn That Selloff Isn't Finished Yet**\nXRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) all declined by 3% to 5% on December 17, 2025, as technical chart breakdowns signaled that the ongoing selloff may not be complete. XRP fell 3.5%, breaking below the $2.33 volume node\u2014a key support level from September and October\u2014marking a shift from consolidation to continuation. Price is now testing the $1.85\u2013$1.90 support zone from April and June lows, but rebounds show weak follow-through, indicating defensive buying rather than accumulation. A daily close below this trendline would expose the $1.60\u2013$1.65 demand zone. Recovery requires reclaiming $2 and closing above $2.33. ADA dropped 4%, with all key EMAs bearish and sloping lower; the 20-day EMA near $0.42 capped rallies, and the $0.38\u2013$0.37 zone is now critical. A daily close below $0.38 could trigger a drop to $0.30\u2013$0.25, with $0.2299\u2014the all-time low\u2014becoming a potential target. SOL fell 5%, testing the lower boundary of a multi-week compression, with a descending triangle pattern and flat support at $122\u2013$124. Momentum indicators remain weak, and a daily close below $122 would target $112\u2013$105, where demand stabilized in early August. Reversals are corrective unless SOL closes above $134. Broader macro and policy headwinds intensified the sell-off: the U.S. Senate Banking Committee delayed the cryptocurrency market structure bill until early 2026, and Senator Elizabeth Warren urged scrutiny of PancakeSwap (CAKE) over alleged ties to Trump-linked World Liberty Financial (WLFI), with ongoing bipartisan talks but unresolved disagreements on financial stability, market integrity, and ethics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 07:35 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/12/49461076/xrp-ada-sol-slide-drop-3-as-charts-warn-that-selloff-isnt-finished-yet)\n\n**Gold Surges $53 Globally, Closes Near $4,270 in Strongest November Session**\nGold futures for February 2026 closed at $4,269.80 on Friday, marking a remarkable weekly performance described as 'impressive' and the strongest since a period of time. The price surged by +52.80 dollars (+1.25%) in a single session, closing just $5 below the daily high of $4,275.00, indicating strong buying pressure and minimal profit-taking despite significant gains. The daily trading range exceeded $83, with the price rebounding sharply from a low of $4,191.80, creating a 'bear trap' that attracted substantial liquidity. The breakout above key resistance levels at $4,200 and $4,250 has positioned gold near its annual peak of $4,398.00. Analysts confirm this was the strongest weekly close in recent memory, reinforcing a strong bullish market trend. They note that investors are making strategic positioning for December, with support now established between $4,220 and $4,225. The overall closing is highly positive, signaling continued upward momentum into the next week.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 03:23 AM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/366821)\n\n**Surprising Silver Decline: Failure to Hold $50 Reinvigorates Bearish Momentum**\nSilver futures for December 2025 resumed their sharp decline in early Tuesday trading, confirming the failure of Monday's cautious attempt to stabilize prices. Sellers broke the psychological barrier at $50, hitting a new low below Friday's trough, signaling further downside potential. The daily trading range of $49.348 to $50.138 indicates that Monday's effort to defend $50\u2014after a rebound from $50.120\u2014'failed completely.' Tuesday's session opened with strong selling pressure, breaking Monday's low and then surpassing Friday's low of $49.860. As of 05:59:25 AM, the current price at $49.620 is near the daily low, reflecting full seller control. Breaking Friday's low is described as a 'very negative technical signal,' confirming that the violent profit-taking rally, which began with a 4.67% drop on Friday after price rejection at $53.30, is not yet over. Analysts warn that the $50 level has now shifted from a key support to strong resistance, with the market expected to test the next support levels formed last week. The critical support zone is identified as the daily low of $49.348 and Friday's low of $49.860. A break below this zone and close below $49.860 would signal a resumption of the decline, potentially leading to targets at $48.70 or $47.80. On the resistance side, Friday's broken low of $49.860 and the psychological $50 barrier now form the decisive resistance zone. A positive outlook will only return if the price regains $50 and closes above it for several sessions\u2014a scenario deemed difficult given the current bearish momentum.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/365815)\n\n**Weak Rebound Above $50: Can Silver Support Hold After Violent Collapse?**\nSilver futures for December 2025 closed sharply lower on Friday, November 14, 2025, losing approximately 5% in a single session amid a violent price rejection at the daily high of $53.375, breaking below the $50 threshold to a low of $49.860 before rebounding to close above $50 at $50.686. The session\u2019s daily range exceeded $3.50, spanning from $49.860 to $53.375. The price initially attempted to extend gains, reaching a peak near the annual high of $54.395, but encountered strong selling pressure and profit-taking, triggering a rapid decline that broke through key levels at $53, $52, $51, and $50. Despite the rebound, the closing loss of -4.67% confirmed bearish dominance. Analysts interpret the 'violent rejection at the peak' as a strong negative signal, warning that failure to break through the annual high followed by such a large bearish close may mark the start of a deeper correction. They now expect the market to retest $50 as a critical support level.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 15, 2025 08:54 AM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/365567)\n\n**Gold Closes Weekly Positive Above $4,009, Reinforcing Bullish Outlook**\nGold futures (December 2025 delivery) closed the week with a clear gain, finishing above the psychological threshold of $4,000 per ounce, following a week marked by sharp market volatility. The precious metal posted a positive weekly performance, recovering from a midweek correction fueled by a decline in the strength of the U.S. dollar and sustained demand for safe-haven assets. The contract closed Friday at $4,009.80 per ounce, up $18.80 (0.47%) from the previous close. The session saw a wide trading range exceeding $54, with prices fluctuating between a low of $3,981.60 and a high of $4,035.80. The market initially faced mild selling pressure but found strong support near $3,980, triggering a strong buying response that pushed prices up over $28 before the close\u2014indicating a renewed control by the upward trend. Market analysts note that closing above $4,000 represents a key technical turning point. A London-based expert stated that 'investors successfully defended the $3,980 level, strengthening the prospects for continued upward momentum in the coming week.' The $4,000 level is now viewed as a new 'floor' after previously acting as a psychological barrier. The opening of next week\u2019s trading will be decisive in confirming this momentum. Markets will closely monitor the support zone between $3,980 and $4,000 as the key battleground between sustaining the positive trend or reverting to a downward correction. Traders are expected to target a breakout above Friday\u2019s high of $4,035.80, aiming toward the next resistance level at $4,077. This performance comes amid rising speculation of a U.S. interest rate cut in 2026, which enhances gold\u2019s appeal as a hedge against inflation and market volatility.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 03:19 AM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/364930)\n\n**Jin Hui's Take: Weekly Market Forecast for October 18, 2025**\nThe U.S. Dollar Index closed the week with a long-legged doji candlestick, and is expected to close with a bullish candle next week, indicating a potential shift from bearish to bullish sentiment. Key support levels are at 97.7 and 97, with resistance at 99.02 and strong resistance at 100. Before a breakout occurs, traders are advised to adopt a strategy of shorting at highs and buying at lows, with a preference for buying on pullbacks. On the daily chart, Friday saw a bottoming rebound, closing with a long lower shadow bullish candlestick. A buy entry is suggested near 98 on Monday, targeting a move above 98.5. Focusing on gold, the price stabilized around 4008 and surged nearly 400 USD, closing the week with a long-legged bullish candlestick. After nine consecutive weekly gains, technical indicators suggest a need for a correction. Weekly support is at 4060, where buying opportunities may arise. A significant downward move would require a confirmed break below 4008, though a drop below 4000 is not currently expected. The weekly resistance is at the recent high of 4379; if the price fails to surpass this level on a second attempt, short positions may be considered. On the daily chart, the price peaked near 4379, then dropped nearly 200 USD in a sharp decline\u2014unusual in magnitude\u2014before closing with a long upper shadow bearish candlestick. Daily resistance at 4335 offers a short opportunity, with the 61.8% retracement level near 4306 and another short zone near 4272 or 4282. If the market weakens, traders can consider shorting near 4272 or 4282. In case of strong volatility, a retest of the prior high at 4379 remains possible. If the price breaks above this level decisively, targets of 4500\u20134600 may be considered. Immediate support is at 4213, which acts as a key dividing line for next week\u2019s direction; a bounce from here could trigger a long position. If the market rises first, a long entry near 4227 or 4213 is suggested, targeting 4260\u20134270, followed by a reversal to short above 4270. If the price breaks below 4213, the Friday low of 4186 may not hold, potentially leading to a drop to 4150 or even 4050, where further long positions could be considered. Given the extreme volatility, caution is advised in trading. Trading strategy: On Monday, consider shorting near 4272 or 4282, with additional shorts near 4305\u20134315; if the price falls, consider buying near 4227 or 4213. Other levels should be referenced from the above analysis. Multiple trades were suggested on Friday, including a short above 4377 and a long above 4195, among others.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[China Finance Online](http://mp.cnfol.com/33642/article/1760835263-142062161.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
