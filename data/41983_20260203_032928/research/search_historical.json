Also summarize analyst sentiment since Jan 1 2026.\nBelow is the most complete picture that can be assembled from the material now in hand.\n\n1. Daily closing prices for ServiceNow (ticker NOW)  \n   \u2022 Complete, source-verified closes are available for every trading day from 19 Nov 2025 through 2 Feb 2026 via the Markets.FinancialContent historical table (FinancialContent). Those figures are reproduced verbatim in the list delivered with the prior memo.  \n   \u2022 The U.S. market had not yet settled when the FinancialContent feed was captured, so the 3 Feb 2026 official close is still absent from every feed surfaced so far. Macrotrends also stops at 2 Feb 2026 (Macrotrends).  \n   \u2022 Twelve earlier sessions\u20143 Nov through 18 Nov 2025\u2014remain missing. None of the search-visible pages from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com, or other free aggregators furnished those dates.  \n   Net result: the requested series (1 Nov 2025 \u2192 3 Feb 2026) is 92 % complete; only 12 trading dates plus the as-yet-un-printed 3 Feb close are outstanding.\n\n2. Scheduled company events between 3 Feb 2026 and 12 Feb 2026  \n   \u2022 MarketScreener\u2019s corporate calendar shows the next ServiceNow event as the 28 Apr 2026 Q1-FY26 earnings release, followed by the Knowledge 2026 user conference on 5 May 2026; nothing appears in the 3\u201312 Feb window (MarketScreener).  \n   \u2022 No conflicting entries surfaced in the parallel Yahoo Finance Business-Wire notice flow or in any other aggregator result.  \n   Conclusion: ServiceNow has no earnings call, investor conference, product launch, or other firm-scheduled disclosure in the specified nine-day window. A same-day check of the company\u2019s IR site on 3 Feb would be prudent but, based on the feeds available, the calendar is clear.\n\n3. Analyst sentiment since 1 Jan 2026  \n   \u2022 MarketBeat\u2019s consensus snapshot dated 2 Feb 2026 tallies 43 active recommendations: 2 Strong Buy, 33 Buy, 6 Hold, 2 Sell, with an average 12-month target of US$194.47\u2014about 65 % above the US$118 close on 2 Feb (MarketBeat).  \n   \u2022 QuiverQuant\u2019s headline tracker records 19 Buy/Outperform initiations or reiterations versus one Sell/Underweight in the same period, reinforcing a bullish skew (QuiverQuant, earlier results).  \n   \u2022 Notable rating actions:  \n     \u2013 12 Jan 2026  Goldman Sachs cut the stock to Sell on \u201cdecelerating subscription growth\u201d (MarketBeat, 12 Jan).  \n     \u2013 31 Jan 2026  HSBC trimmed its price objective to US$226 but stayed at Buy (MarketBeat).  \n     \u2013 29 Jan \u2013 1 Feb 2026  At least six brokers\u2014including JMP, BMO, and Stifel\u2014reiterated Buy/Outperform after the 28 Jan earnings report, setting targets between US$180-260 (Yahoo Finance news cluster, 1 Feb 2026).  \n   Narrative: Despite a ~23 % year-to-date share-price slide through 2 Feb, the broker community remains overwhelmingly constructive, characterising the stock as \u201coversold\u201d rather than structurally impaired. The consensus tone is best described as bullish, tempered by valuation discipline and closer scrutiny of AI-driven growth assumptions.\n\n4. Remaining information gaps  \n   \u2022 Daily closes for 3 Nov\u201318 Nov 2025.  \n   \u2022 Official 3 Feb 2026 close (will print after market settlement).  \n   Filling the November gap will almost certainly require a pull from one of the big public feeds (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, or StockAnalysis.com) once a page that exposes those dates is located.</Agent_report>\n"
