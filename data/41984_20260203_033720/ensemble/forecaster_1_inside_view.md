## (a) Source Analysis

**DW.com (Feb 2, 2026):**
High-quality German international broadcaster reporting on trilateral peace talks rescheduled to Feb 4-5 in Abu Dhabi. Key facts: US-Russia bilateral meeting in Florida preceded announcement, first round in late January yielded no breakthrough on Donbas, limited energy ceasefire agreed until Sunday only. Reports 15 miners killed in drone attack and multiple other strikes on Sunday. Zelensky and Witkoff quotes are directly attributed. This is current, reliable reporting on active diplomatic developments.

**The Guardian (Feb 2, 2026):**
Reputable UK source confirming talks rescheduled to Wednesday-Thursday (Feb 4-5). Key facts: energy ceasefire status disputed (Ukraine claims Jan 30-Feb 6, Kremlin says Jan 31-Feb 1), temperatures around -15°C straining power grid, Russian forces gained control of Zelene and Sukhetske villages. Reports 12 miners killed (slight discrepancy with DW's 15), overnight attacks in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. Elon Musk's Starlink anti-drone efforts mentioned. Recent, reliable source.

**Polymarket data:**
Market structure only, no current odds provided. Shows $8.3M volume on similar question (ceasefire before 2027). Resolution criteria require official announcement from both sides or wide media consensus. Created July 2025. Cannot extract prediction percentage, so limited utility for calibrating Metaculus community sentiment.

**Central News Agency (Feb 2, 2026):**
Reports Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) poll of 1,003 Ukrainians (Jan 23-29): 52% find complete Donbas withdrawal "completely unacceptable," only 20% expect war to end by H1 2026, 43% expect conflict beyond 2027. This is **strong evidence** - identifiable polling organization with clear methodology showing Ukrainian public skepticism about near-term resolution. Hrushetskyi (KIIS Executive Director) directly quoted.

**Dialog.UA articles (Feb 2, 2026):**
Multiple articles from Ukrainian source. Russian volunteer "Cesar" predicts ceasefire by end of 2026 (this appears to be misreported as "2024" in one instance - likely translation error). This is **weak evidence** - single individual's speculation. Another article reports Zelenskyy's meeting with negotiation team, emphasizing Ukraine's readiness for "substantive" talks. Factual reporting of official statements.

**Khaleej Times (Feb 2, 2026):**
UAE-based English source reporting Zelenskyy's statement that Russia "largely observed" energy ceasefire with no targeted strikes in past 24 hours. DTEK CEO warning about power shortage criticality. Reports second attack on coal mine. **Moderate evidence** of partial de-escalation, though limited in scope.

**Perth Now (Feb 2, 2026):**
Australian source confirming Feb 4-5 Abu Dhabi talks, Kremlin confirmation of rescheduling. Zelenskyy's quote about "lasting peace realistic" and bilateral security document with US being complete. Reports energy truce disputed timeline and Sunday miner deaths. Reliable corroboration of key facts.

**Medium.com article (Feb 2, 2026):**
General overview noting 12 miner deaths, severe winter conditions, Feb 4-5 talks scheduled. Mentions NATO diplomat warnings about security risks from discharged combatants. **Weak evidence** - general commentary without specific sourcing.

**RBC-Ukraine (Feb 2, 2026):**
Reports KMIS survey showing declining optimism: only 20% expect war to end by mid-2026 (down from 33% in Sept-Oct 2025 and 26% in Dec 2025), 43% expect conflict beyond 2027. Wall Street Journal scenarios mentioned. **Strong evidence** - identifiable polling organization showing trend of increasing pessimism over time.

**Tsargrad TV (Feb 2, 2026):**
Russian source discussing Zhirinovsky's past predictions, claiming he forecast conflict would end by 2026. **Weak evidence** - speculative, from deceased politician, Russian state-aligned media.

**Le Huffington Post (Feb 1, 2026):**
French source citing CSIS projection of 2 million military casualties by spring 2026. Reports UN HRMMU data: 2,514 civilian deaths in 2025 (up 31% from 2024). **Moderate evidence** - identifiable think tank (CSIS) with specific casualty projections suggesting prolonged conflict.

**TSN.ua articles (multiple dates):**
Ukrainian journalist Portnikov predicts 2026 will be year of "gradual diminishing" not resolution. Commander Fedorenko predicts war through 2026 into early 2027. **Moderate evidence** - identifiable Ukrainian military/analyst opinions suggesting extended timeline.

**AI prediction articles (Oct-Nov 2025):**
Multiple sources reporting GPT-5/ChatGPT analysis giving 25-40% probability of stable ceasefire/frozen conflict by 2026-2027, with 35-50% probability of continued high-intensity war. **Weak evidence** - AI predictions lack transparency in methodology and are several months old.

**TIME/elnabaa.net (Sept 2025):**
Articles about Metaculus platform's AI forecasting competition. Notes Metaculus correctly predicted Ukraine invasion timing. **Weak evidence for this question** - meta-discussion about forecasting platforms, not substantive analysis of ceasefire prospects.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **KIIS polling data (Jan 23-29, 2026)**: 52% of Ukrainians find Donbas withdrawal unacceptable, only 20% expect war to end by H1 2026, 43% expect conflict beyond 2027. Trend shows declining optimism (33% in Sept-Oct 2025 → 26% in Dec 2025 → 20% in Jan 2026). This suggests **downward pressure** on ceasefire probability predictions.

2. **Multiple independent sources confirming Feb 4-5 talks**: DW, Guardian, Perth Now, Khaleej Times all report trilateral negotiations scheduled imminently. This represents **active diplomatic process** that could generate positive momentum.

3. **Energy ceasefire violations**: Multiple sources (DW, Guardian) report attacks continuing despite limited ceasefire agreement, with 12-15 miners killed on the day ceasefire expired. This demonstrates **fragility of partial agreements** and Russia's willingness to resume attacks.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **No breakthrough on Donbas in first round (late January)**: Multiple sources confirm territorial dispute remains unresolved, Russia demands full withdrawal Ukraine finds unacceptable. This is the **core obstacle**.

2. **CSIS casualty projections**: Forecast of 2M military casualties by spring 2026 suggests **protracted conflict** trajectory from serious analytical institution.

3. **Zelenskyy's optimistic rhetoric vs. Ukrainian military assessments**: Zelenskyy says "lasting peace realistic" while Commander Fedorenko predicts war through 2026-early 2027. This **mixed signaling** reflects genuine uncertainty.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Various individual predictions and AI forecasts from months ago
2. Zhirinovsky historical predictions
3. General commentary without specific sourcing

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 3 → Feb 14, 2026)

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- Feb 4-5 talks occur in 1-2 days - **immediate catalyst**
- Target question asks about ceasefire "before 2027" - **~11 months remaining**
- Metaculus community will update based on Feb 4-5 outcomes within the 11-day window

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days)**: Would miss post-talks assessment period. Prediction would rely more heavily on pre-talks sentiment, likely **lower** probability of >40% as insufficient time for positive signals to propagate.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days)**: Would capture additional diplomatic developments, potential follow-up meetings, and clearer trajectory from Feb 4-5 talks. Could see **higher volatility** - either significant increase if talks produce breakthrough, or decrease if they fail. More time allows for fuller information incorporation.

**Critical consideration**: The question resolves based on Metaculus community prediction on Feb 14, NOT on whether ceasefire actually occurs. We're forecasting **crowd sentiment** about an 11-month horizon, not the event itself.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Outside View**: 52% (established earlier based on moderate diplomatic engagement with mixed signals)

**Factors Shifting Prediction Upward:**
1. **Active, scheduled trilateral talks (Feb 4-5)**: This is concrete diplomatic engagement with US involvement under Trump administration, which represents new variable vs. previous failed attempts. The Metaculus community will likely assign some probability boost to active negotiations.

2. **Long time horizon (11 months to Dec 31, 2026)**: A ceasefire "before 2027" gives substantial time for diplomatic progress. Even skeptical forecasters might assign 35-45% probability to an 11-month window.

3. **Partial de-escalation demonstrated**: Energy infrastructure pause (even if violated) shows some capacity for limited agreements, which could evolve into broader ceasefire.

**Factors Shifting Prediction Downward:**
1. **Ukrainian public pessimism increasing**: KIIS polling shows only 20% expect war to end by H1 2026 (down from 33% in Sept-Oct 2025), and 43% expect conflict beyond 2027. This **strong evidence** of declining optimism among those most affected suggests informed observers see low ceasefire probability.

2. **Core territorial dispute unresolved**: Donbas remains non-negotiable for both sides. 52% of Ukrainians find withdrawal "completely unacceptable" while Russia demands full cession. This fundamental impasse hasn't shifted.

3. **Ceasefire violations already occurring**: The limited energy agreement was violated immediately, demonstrating **lack of trust and enforcement mechanisms** necessary for broader ceasefire.

4. **Historical pattern of failed negotiations**: Nearly 4 years of conflict with no successful ceasefire achieved. Previous diplomatic efforts have consistently failed.

**Critical Insight**: The question asks about **Metaculus community prediction**, not actual ceasefire probability. Metaculus forecasters are typically:
- Well-informed and analytically rigorous
- Somewhat pessimistic on geopolitical outcomes (calibrated toward base rates)
- Responsive to concrete developments (Feb 4-5 talks)
- Aware of historical failure patterns

**Calibration Logic:**
- If current Metaculus prediction is ~35-40%, the Feb 4-5 talks could produce modest optimism pushing it to 40-45%
- If current prediction is ~25-35%, would need significant breakthrough to exceed 40%
- If current prediction is already ~45-50%, likely to remain above 40% unless talks fail dramatically

Given:
- Strong evidence of declining Ukrainian public optimism
- Moderate evidence of active but constrained diplomatic process
- Weak enforcement of partial agreements
- Long time horizon providing some basis for optimism

I estimate the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 14 will likely be in the **35-45% range**, with **roughly 50-55% probability** it exceeds the 40% threshold.

The outside view of 52% is reasonably well-calibrated given these factors. The declining optimism trend (strong evidence) pulls slightly downward, but the active diplomatic process and long time horizon provide counterbalance.

## Probability Calibration

Adjusting from 52% outside view:

**Downward adjustments (-7%):**
- KIIS polling showing declining optimism over time (strong evidence): -4%
- Ceasefire violations demonstrating enforcement weakness (moderate): -3%

**Upward adjustments (+3%):**
- Imminent Feb 4-5 talks likely to generate some positive updates: +3%

**Net adjustment**: -4%

**Final calibration**: 48%

This reflects:
- Roughly even odds (48:52) that Metaculus community will be above vs. below 40%
- Recognition that active talks provide some optimism but declining trend and violations create headwinds
- Acknowledgment that 40% threshold for an 11-month horizon is a moderately skeptical but not dismissive stance that sophisticated forecasters might adopt

Probability calibration:
48% probability that Metaculus community prediction will be >40% on Feb 14, 2026.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >40% chance of Russia-Ukraine bilateral ceasefire before 2027, as measured on Feb 14, 2026?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 52% based on active diplomacy with mixed signals. Final prediction (48%) remains close to this base rate with modest downward adjustment for declining optimism trend.

3. **Consistency**: "48 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 14 will exceed 40%." This reflects near-even odds aligned with genuine uncertainty about crowd sentiment given active but constrained diplomatic process.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - KIIS polling: Ukrainian optimism declining from 33%→26%→20% over 4 months (strong, factual)
   - Feb 4-5 trilateral talks scheduled with US involvement (strong, factual)
   - Energy ceasefire violated immediately, 12-15 miners killed (strong, factual)
   - Core Donbas dispute unresolved, 52% find withdrawal unacceptable (strong, factual)
   - 11-month time horizon provides basis for moderate probability (structural)

5. **Blind spot**: Feb 4-5 talks produce unexpected breakthrough announcement (e.g., framework agreement, extended ceasefire, territorial compromise). This could rapidly shift Metaculus community to 50-60%, making my 48% prediction look too pessimistic. However, given first round produced no breakthrough and core disputes remain, major breakthrough seems unlikely (~15% chance).

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is active but slow-moving diplomacy with violations. Status quo suggests Metaculus community will remain moderately skeptical (35-45% range). My 48% prediction for >40% threshold is well-aligned with this gradual process rather than dramatic change.

Probability: 48%
