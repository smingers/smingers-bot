Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Primary News Sources (Feb 1-2, 2026):**

1. **DW.com & Guardian (Feb 2, 2026)** - High reliability. Both report trilateral talks rescheduled to Feb 4-5 in Abu Dhabi after initial Sunday delay. Energy infrastructure ceasefire agreed but disputed timeline (Russia: Jan 31-Feb 1; Ukraine: Jan 30-Feb 6). Factual reporting with named sources (Zelenskyy, Peskov). **Key fact**: Despite ceasefire, Russian drone killed 12+ miners on Feb 2.

2. **Khaleej Times & Perth Now (Feb 2, 2026)** - Medium-high reliability. Zelenskyy states Russia "largely observing" energy ceasefire but attacking transport/railway infrastructure. Bilateral security agreement with US reportedly "complete." Factual quotes from identifiable officials.

3. **KIIS Poll (Jan 23-29, 2026)** - High reliability, identifiable methodology. 1,003 Ukrainians surveyed: only 20% expect war to end by mid-2026, 18% by late 2026, 43% believe it continues beyond 2027. 52% reject full Donbas withdrawal. **Strong evidence** of declining public optimism (down from 33% expecting mid-2026 end in Sept-Oct 2025).

4. **Polymarket** - Market structure described but no current odds provided. Volume $8.3M suggests active trading but no actionable data point.

**Forecasting/Analysis Articles:**

5. **Metaculus AI performance article (Sept 2025)** - Discusses AI forecasting accuracy on Metaculus but provides no specific data on current Ukraine ceasefire predictions. Low relevance to current question.

6. **Russian volunteer "Cesar" interview (Feb 2, 2026)** - Single source opinion predicting ceasefire by end of 2026 due to exhaustion. **Weak evidence** - anecdotal, non-expert.

7. **Ukrainian military analysts (Oct 2025-Jan 2026)** - Multiple sources (Fedorenko, Portnikov, Podolyak) predicting war continues through 2026-2027. **Moderate evidence** - identifiable military experts with consistent pessimistic outlook.

8. **AI predictions (Oct 2025)** - GPT-5 analysis assigns 25-40% probability to frozen conflict/ceasefire by 2026-2027. **Weak evidence** - speculative, dated, no clear methodology for this specific question.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **KIIS poll showing declining optimism**: Public expectation of near-term peace dropped from 33% (Sept-Oct 2025) to 20% (Jan 2026). This suggests deteriorating confidence in diplomatic progress, which would correlate with lower Metaculus predictions.
- **Ceasefire violations during talks**: Despite agreed energy infrastructure pause, Russia killed 12+ miners Feb 2. Multiple attacks on civilian infrastructure. This demonstrates fragility of any agreements and reduces credibility of imminent breakthrough.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Talks rescheduled but proceeding**: Feb 4-5 Abu Dhabi talks represent first direct trilateral format with senior US officials (Witkoff, Bessent). Positive signal but first round yielded "no breakthrough on territory."
- **Expert military consensus**: Multiple Ukrainian military analysts (Fedorenko, Portnikov) independently predict war continues through 2026-2027. Consistent with low ceasefire probability.
- **Territorial deadlock**: Donbas remains unresolved; Russia demands full withdrawal, Ukraine refuses. No indication of compromise emerging.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Individual predictions from non-experts or dated AI analyses
- Zhirinovsky's "prophecy" (Feb 2026 article) - posthumous interpretation of old predictions, highly speculative

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window**: 11 days (Feb 3 to Feb 14, 2026)

The question asks whether Metaculus community prediction will be >40% on Feb 14. This is a **meta-prediction** about forecaster behavior, not about the ceasefire itself.

**Key considerations:**
- Current spot prediction unknown but outside view analysis suggests mid-30s (30-38%)
- Abu Dhabi talks Feb 4-5 are the major near-term event
- Historical pattern: headline announcements produce +5pp bumps that decay by 50% within 2 weeks

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days)**: Lower probability of crossing 40% - less time for talks to produce positive signals, less time for news to propagate through forecaster community.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days)**: Higher probability - more opportunity for multiple news cycles, potential for second-round talks or concrete progress announcements.

**(d) Justification:**

**Baseline assumption**: Current Metaculus community prediction ≈35% (mid-range of outside view estimate)

**Factors suggesting upward movement toward 40%+:**
1. **Abu Dhabi talks (Feb 4-5)**: First direct trilateral format with senior US officials. Even without breakthrough, symbolic progress could generate +3-6pp bump
2. **Energy ceasefire holding (partially)**: Despite violations, Zelenskyy acknowledges Russia "largely observing" - suggests some diplomatic traction
3. **US bilateral security agreement "complete"**: If announced during talks, could boost optimism

**Factors suggesting limited movement or downward pressure:**
1. **Declining public optimism**: KIIS poll shows 43% expect war beyond 2027 (up from lower levels in 2025) - forecasters likely aware of this
2. **Ceasefire violations**: Feb 2 miner deaths undermine credibility of Russian commitments
3. **Territorial deadlock**: No indication of compromise on Donbas; first round had "no breakthrough"
4. **Expert consensus pessimistic**: Multiple military analysts predict 2026-2027 continuation
5. **Historical pattern**: Previous Ukraine peace talks have consistently failed to produce lasting agreements

**Scenario analysis** (assuming current spot = 35%):
- **No material breakthrough (60% weight)**: Talks produce communique but no concrete progress → drift ±2pp → final 33-37% → P(>40%) ≈ 0%
- **Symbolic progress (30% weight)**: Positive rhetoric, minor agreements → +4-7pp bump → final 39-42% → P(>40%) ≈ 50%
- **Unexpected breakthrough (10% weight)**: Territorial compromise announced → +10pp → final 45%+ → P(>40%) ≈ 100%

**Weighted probability**: 0.60×0% + 0.30×50% + 0.10×100% = **25%**

**Calibration sensitivity:**
- If current spot is 37-38%: Only need +2-3pp to cross → probability rises to 35-40%
- If current spot is 32-34%: Need +6-8pp to cross → probability drops to 15-20%

Given uncertainty about exact current spot and the moderate likelihood of symbolic progress from talks, I calibrate to **28%** - slightly above the scenario-weighted 25% to account for potential positive surprise from the high-level US engagement.

**Probability Calibration:**

My outside view established 25% ± 5% based on historical crossing rates and volatility analysis. The inside view evidence moderately supports this:

- **Strong negative evidence** (declining public optimism, ceasefire violations) suggests current Metaculus prediction may already be drifting downward from mid-30s
- **Moderate positive evidence** (high-level talks, partial ceasefire holding) provides realistic path to +5-6pp bump
- The combination suggests crossing 40% requires "symbolic progress" scenario (30% weight) AND current spot being toward higher end of estimated range (36-38%)

**Final calibration**: 28% reflects:
1. Base rate of 25% from reference class
2. +3pp adjustment for higher-than-usual diplomatic engagement (Trump administration direct involvement)
3. Uncertainty band acknowledging unknown current spot value

This feels appropriately calibrated: **28 out of 100 times**, given the current diplomatic context and 11-day window, the Metaculus community prediction would exceed 40% on Feb 14. This aligns with "possible but unlikely" - requiring talks to produce tangible positive signals without major setbacks.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >40% chance of Russia-Ukraine ceasefire before 2027, measured on Feb 14, 2026? (11 days from now)

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 25% based on historical crossing rates for Ukraine peace questions when spot is 2-6pp below threshold with <14 days remaining.

3. **Consistency**: "28 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction exceeds 40% on Feb 14." Reasonable given moderate probability of symbolic progress from Feb 4-5 talks but low probability of breakthrough.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - KIIS poll: Only 20% expect war ends by mid-2026 (down from 33% in Sept-Oct 2025)
   - Feb 4-5 Abu Dhabi talks: First direct trilateral with senior US officials
   - Ceasefire violations: 12+ miners killed Feb 2 despite energy infrastructure pause
   - Expert consensus: Multiple military analysts predict war continues through 2026-2027
   - Territorial deadlock: No indication of Donbas compromise

5. **Blind spot**: Abu Dhabi talks produce unexpected territorial compromise announcement (e.g., Russia agrees to phased withdrawal in exchange for neutrality guarantees). This could trigger +15pp spike, making my forecast look far too conservative. Probability: ~5-8%.

6. **Status quo**: Current situation shows modest diplomatic engagement but fundamental positions unchanged. 11-day window is short for major shifts. Slight nudge toward status quo (no crossing) is appropriate, but 28% already reflects this conservatism.

**Probability: 28%**
