Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (dates = 2026 unless stated)

1. DW, 2 Feb – Factual: Abu Dhabi talks rescheduled to 4–5 Feb; limited “energy-only” pause; fresh Russian drone strikes.  Opinion: Kremlin spokesman calls the pause a “good basis”; Zelenskyy says talks should lead to “a dignified end”.  High reliability, directly relevant.

2. Guardian, 2 Feb – Confirms delay, outlines cease-fire pause, lists fresh attacks and Russian local advances.  High reliability, relevant.

3. Khaleej Times, Perth Now, Dialog.UA (3 parallel wires), 2 Feb – Zelenskyy claims Russia is “largely observing” energy cease-fire, stresses optimism before talks.  Mixed (Ukrainian leadership self-report = factual but interested); still relevant.

4. KIIS poll (Central News Agency), 2 Feb – Methodological survey on Ukrainian public attitudes; factual numbers, moderate quality; indirectly relevant (end-state difficulty).

5. Polymarket description (no odds) – Factual, but not evidence of probability; weak relevance.

6. Other commentary pieces (Portnikov, Fedorenko, Podolyak, AI articles) – Opinion/analysis, some by identifiable experts; low-to-moderate relevance.

All sources are ≤48 h old, reducing staleness risk.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to Metaculus probability crossing 40 %)

Strong:
• Structural incompatibility over Donbas (multiple independent outlets, polling) keeps true cease-fire difficult → pushes probability downward.

Moderate:
• Resumed US-UA-RU diplomatic track with confirmed dates (DW, Guardian) → upward shift.
• Short energy-only firing pause actually observed for ~24 h (Khaleej Times, DW) shows parties can implement limited truces → small upward.
• Eleven-day window: Metaculus aggregates historically “sticky” (empirical platform behaviour) → whatever level the crowd already sits at is unlikely to swing >5 pp without a signed framework → favours status-quo.

Weak:
• AI and individual pundit forecasts of 2026 end of war – anecdotal, small weight.

Net evidence balance: slight tilt to status-quo with modest diplomacy optimism (+), offset by strong structural hurdle (−).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 11 days.  Metaculus community medians typically move 2–6 percentage-points in similar windows unless a step-change event occurs.  Halving the window (5 days) would further entrench inertia, lowering my “flip” probability by ~3 pp.  Doubling (22 days) would allow one full extra negotiation cycle; I would raise my “Yes” probability by ~5 pp because of higher chance of a visible breakthrough.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Base rate (outside view) for Metaculus prediction > 40 % was 54 % (assumed mean community estimate ≈ 42–45 %).  New evidence:

– Continued lethal strikes during “pause” & fundamental Donbas dispute (strong, −6 pp)  
– Concrete second-round high-level talks scheduled, US facilitation (moderate, +4 pp)  
– Observed but limited compliance with energy pause (moderate, +2 pp)  
– Short horizon sticky-probability effect (moderate, −5 pp)

Net adjustment: −5 pp → inside-view probability 49 %.  A final 4-pp subjective nudge downward (risk that the current Metaculus value is actually in the high-30s) gives 45 %.

Probability calibration

Outside-view anchor: 54 %  
Total evidence adjustment: −9 pp  
Inside-view forecast: 45 %

Interpreted: “About 45 times out of 100, the Metaculus community will show > 40 % on 14 Feb.”

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase – Will Metaculus crowd forecast of a RU-UA bilateral cease-fire before 2027 exceed 40 % on 14 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate stated (54 %).  
3. Consistency: 45/100 times criterion met – aligns with justification.  
4. Key evidence (i) Donbas impasse, (ii) scheduled Abu-Dhabi talks, (iii) limited energy pause, (iv) platform inertia, (v) fresh Russian strikes.  
5. Blind-spot – Surprise signing of a framework cease-fire 10–13 Feb could spike Metaculus to >60 % (would add ~15 pp).  
6. Status-quo bias checked; short horizon favours little movement.

Probability: 45%
