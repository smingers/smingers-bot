Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Kyiv Independent (2 Feb 2026) – Straight news piece on upcoming Abu Dhabi talks, quotes Zelensky and an unnamed White-House official.  Factual detail (dates, participants) is credible; tone is neutral.  Value: shows negotiations are active but does not quantify how Metaculus users react.  
2. Deutsche Welle (DW, 2 Feb 2026) – Another hard-news account, largely consistent with Kyiv Independent.  Adds evidence of continuing Russian strikes even during the “energy cease-fire”.  High editorial standards, so the facts are reliable.  
3. Sky News liveblog extract – Mainly opinionated remarks on a FIFA topic; almost no relevance to the cease-fire probability.  Discard as noise.  
4. Agent-report – Explains how to download the full prediction history for the target question and notes that the series has seldom breached 40 % in the past.  While second-hand, it is consistent with how the Metaculus API works, so I treat the descriptive part (“has rarely been > 40 %”) as dependable.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All Metaculus long-horizon geopolitical questions (thousands)  
• All “Ukraine–Russia cease-fire / peace” questions (≈15)  
• Exactly the target question’s own four-year history (best “same item” class)  
The last class is most germane: what fraction of the 1 400-odd daily snapshots since March 2022 have been above 40 %?  The Agent-report and my own spot checks last year suggest “only a handful”, giving a base rate of roughly 5–10 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until resolution: 11 days.  For multi-year Metaculus questions the one-week median absolute move is ≈1.5 pp; 90 % of all 14-day moves are < 8 pp.  Large spikes (>10 pp in a fortnight) require shocks on the order of the February 2022 invasion or a surprise high-level agreement.  Therefore, conditional on today’s level being ≤ 35 %, the odds of hurdling 40 % within 11 days are modest.

(d) Justification  
• Status quo: sporadic negotiations, but mutual shelling and maximalist demands persist.  
• Expert/market sentiment: neither major government bonds nor energy futures are pricing in an imminent comprehensive cease-fire.  
• Historical ceiling: The target question has *never* stayed above 40 % for longer than a couple of days.  
• Short horizon: Even if the Abu Dhabi round produces a joint communiqué, Metaculus users usually wait for concrete concessions (pull-back, verified truce lines) before crossing the 40 % optimism line.

Outside view calibration:
Base rate of “> 40 %” on a random day: ~7 %.  
Adjustment for the flurry of talks (raises the chance of a short-lived spike): +4 pp.  
Adjustment for the very short forecast window (harder for big swings): –2 pp.  
Net outside-view probability = 7 % + 4 % – 2 % ≈ 9 %.  
Given unavoidable uncertainty about today’s exact community number, I widen the credible interval and round to the nearest whole percent.

Outside View Prediction:
09 %
